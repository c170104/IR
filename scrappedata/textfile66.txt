He clambered out onto the fire escape, peering up at the doors to Mary's bedroom. The light was still off, so he shrugged to himself and sat down on the metal grate below him, poking his legs through the spaces in the railing. He gave a contented sigh and breathed in the calm, warm evening air with a smile. It had been a long day, and even while his body was tired, adrenaline still buzzed in his veins. The Double Dutch competition had left him with an excitement the likes of which boxing hadn't done in years, but he suspected that it may have had something to do with the people involved – or one of them, at least. He'd been out for a while when lights flicked on in Mary's room above and to his right. For a few seconds he watched the doors; then he began to whistle a cheerful tune. After a moment one of the doors opened and Mary poked her head outside to look at him, smiling. He grinned back and patted the spot on the metallic balcony beside him. Mary chuckled and wandered out, quickly slipping down the ladder between their balconies and coming to join him. She sat down close on his right, her hip resting gently against his, and pushed her legs out the railing to let them dangle next to Izzy's. He looked away from her again, back into the distance, and she followed suit. \"How'd you escape?\" she asked, smiling. \"I thought you might never get away from your dad. That look on his face? Like he was never planning on letting go.\" Izzy laughed. \"Boxing, Double Dutch. Doesn't matter which, he likes to see me win.\" He put his hands on his knees. \"I told him I was tired and needed rest. I wasn't lying, really.\" \"I hear you,\" she agreed with a nod. \"It's always exhausting after a competition. It's hard to go right to bed though. Still too hyped up from the win.\" \"Exactly.\" He paused. \"Also, there was someone I wanted to talk to.\" \"Oh yeah?\" she teased, glancing at him. \"Who's that?\" He smiled, turning to meet her eyes. Growing momentarily serious, he said, \"Hey, listen. I'm really sorry I bailed on you guys before. And I'm sorry I was rude to you. That wasn't cool.\" She shook her head. \"I forgive you. I get that things were hard with your dad and stuff, I should've been more understanding. And I'm sorry that you got made fun of at school when Rodney told everybody. I'm still really mad about that, actually. People are whack.\" Izzy shrugged. \"I'll work it out. And don't hold it against Rodney, he's dealing with a lot of his own problems. But I think he and I are square.\" Mary smiled and tipped her head. \"I heard what happened at the gym. The whole rematch and everything?\" \"Oh yeah?\" he asked. There was an edge of anxiety to his voice, as if he was concerned she wouldn't approve that he'd consented to another fight. \"I think what you did was pretty great,\" she answered, nudging his arm. \"I never woulda done it. And I still don't quite forgive him. But who knows? I've seen people change.\" She grinned. Izzy laughed, glancing down. \"Yeah, me too.\" She watched him for a moment, and he couldn't quite meet her eye. Amused, she bumped his arm again, jostling him playfully. \"We're square, too, by the way.\" \"Yeah?\" he asked. \"Cool.\" He returned his eyes to the buildings facing them. The very last colours of the sunset were still visible over the rooftops. They were quiet for a few minutes, watching the colours fade, both pleasantly aware of every spot their legs and elbows touched. After a while Mary broke the silence again. \"So did I see Chuck and Tammy holding hands earlier?\" Izzy laughed. \"Yeah, finally. They've been into each other for months.\" She grinned. \"I think they look great together,\" she said. \"Yeah, me too,\" he admitted. \"But I tease 'em both about it too much to say so.\" Mary giggled. \"Tammy's a cool girl.\" He nodded. \"Yeah, she is. She… she gave me some pretty good advice, too. About the Double Dutch. And stuff.\" \"Remind me to thank her,\" she joked. \"Yeah, yeah,\" Izzy muttered, shaking his head and laughing softly. \"Izzy, I'm glad you're on the team,\" she said, pressing slightly against his side. \"You're a good jumper, and you're fun. I like havin' you around.\" \"I like bein' around,\" he answered. After a beat, he grinned. He gulped and said, a little too fast, \"Hey, so, remember that time a little while back, when you kissed me?\" Quickly she turned her face away, not wanting him to see her embarrassment. \"What about it?\" she asked, wishing she couldn't feel the blood rushing to her face. He swallowed, smiling in a silly, apprehensive kind of way, and though Mary couldn't see the hesitation on his face, she could hear it in his voice and even in the silence that preceded it. \"Well, uh.\" He cleared his throat and started over. \"Uh, I was wondering if you wanted to try it again.\" \"Um.\" There was a pause as she searched for words. Izzy's heart thudded almost painfully in his chest as the silence stretched out between them and his confidence faded. He couldn't explain that moment of courage that had caused him to ask in the first place; for all he liked to get on Mary's nerves – he'd been doing that for years – this was new territory for him. He licked his lips nervously. \"Mary?\" \"Um,\" she repeated, slowly turning to look at him again over her shoulder. Izzy gulped again, casting his eyes down. Haltingly, he reached for her hand, taking it gently. He wasn't sure what he expected to accomplish with this, except perhaps to reassure her that he was serious. It seemed to help, though. \"Actually?\" she asked, sounding surprised. He glanced back up at her. \"Um, yeah.\" Finally she smiled, biting her lip. \"Yeah, okay.\" Izzy broke into a relieved grin and leaned toward her as she turned to face him properly again. Last time, she'd been so quick and he'd been so stunned that he hadn't had a chance to respond. Now she was surprised enough that it took her a moment to react, but he gave her a chance. Truthfully he didn't want to pull away, but after a slow moment he did. He stayed in close to her face, his right foot catching around her left ankle and keeping her near. He wanted to be as close to her as possible. They grinned at each other, both nearly laughing at themselves, and at each other, but it was a good feeling. \"So,\" he began, unable to chase the smile from his face, \"does this mean I get to call you my girlfriend?\" Her smile widened, despite her efforts to bite it back. \"Only if I get to call you my boyfriend.\" She extracted her fingers from his only so she could put her arms over his bare shoulders. \"Good deal,\" he sighed, succumbing to himself and dipping in to kiss her again, quickly, once, twice, three times. \"I'm not going to get tired of that,\" he added quietly, his eyes shut. \"I didn't think you liked me,\" she admitted, biting her lip. \"Why would you think that?\" he asked, opening his eyes and chuckling at her as he rested his forehead against hers. Mary looked down, embarrassed. \"Because until the incident a few days ago, you were considered basically one of the coolest guys at school. You probably could've had your pick of pretty much anyone.\" \"But I like you,\" he answered, grinning. \"Shouldn't you at least have gotten that from the look on my face after you kissed me? I don't think I was hiding it.\" Laughing, she smacked him lightly on the shoulder. \"For all I knew, you just thought it was funny that I had done it. I, the girl who had always claimed not to like you at all.\" \"And just now?\" Izzy asked, pressing his head against hers with a gentle playfulness. \"When I asked to kiss you again? Why the hesitation?\" \"For all I knew, you just liked kissing!\" she answered, trying to be annoyed with all the questions. She was still smiling though. \"I do like kissing,\" he teased her. \"I like kissing you .\" \"You like flirting, too, don't you?\" she laughed. \"I like flirting with you ,\" he answered, his tone just the same as before and his grin growing broader. She looked up into his eyes and had to fight down a rush of butterflies in her stomach when she saw the way he was looking at her. He pressed his smiling mouth to hers again, and she giggled at the way his ecstasy fought with his self-control. His kisses were short, then long, then short again, and his fingers wove through her braids as he put his hands on either side of her face, trying to hold her as near as he could get away with.

This time he looked up, with the smile that made Mary's heart skip a beat. \"You want something?\" he asked opening the window. Mary giggled. \"Seriously,\" he said again. \"'Cause I ain't got all night!\" \"I just wanted to say…\" Mary took a breath. \"You looked good out there tonight…\" Mary averted her eyes from Izzy's. \"Well, you didn't have to tell me that,\" he answered playfully. \"I already knew!\" \"Oh, really?\" answered Mary. \"'Cause I didn't see a mirror… or did it crack when you were looking into it?\" \"Oh, that was cold, Mary!\" Izzy stepped out onto the fire escape to sit next to her, their feet dangling over the city below. \"But I know your not…\" He scooted closer to her.

Mary giggled, then kissed Izzy gently on his cheek. \"Who did that?\" she asked doing the same thing that Izzy had done.

This time she held on longer. Izzy was stunned at first, but then he began to gently kiss her back. When they finally pulled away, a smirk played on Izzy's face. He closed his eyes, embracing the feeling of Mary's warm lips on top of his.

Izzy Daniels,nwith his arrogance and confidence blending into one. He was a jerk,nhe was my neighbor, he was my friend. He was the guy I was innlove with. Don't get me wrong,narrogant dudes with attitude problems don't turn me on, but Izzynwas different. He didn't care what anyone thought about anything.nStuff like 'doin' what everyone wants you to do' didn't fazenhim, 'cause it didn't bother him. He liked being different, andnhe lived to do what he loved. I guess that's why Inlove him. I didn't always lovenhim. Like I said, he was a jerk and everythin'. But it all changednone night, when he proved he wasn't exactly the way he seemed. Andnthat's when I realized I loved him. Izzy lived downstairsnin our apartment building. He'd lived there all his life, and sonhad I. We were officially acquainted in kindergarten, 'cause wenwere in the same class and I got stuck sitting next to him. He stuckna frog in my lunchbox. I dropped a spider on his head. We weren'tnthe best of friends. In fourth grade hendiscovered I had a balcony, and I went out on it all the time. Onennight he climbed out his window and stood on the landing beneathnmine. We stuck our tongues out and made faces at each other, but hentold me goodnight and I said the same. After that, we weren't quitenas mean to each other. But that wasn't it.nIt took years for me to fall in love with Izzy Daniels, and hencertainly didn't make it easy. After years of being brats to eachnother in school, I didn't really like him. Then in junior high henstarted dating, and I told him that he and every girl he'd gone outnwith was whack. They were too; pretty little things that 'bout hadncoronaries when they broke a nail, and they couldn't go to Izzy'snboxing matches 'cause they thought they were 'too violent.'nNow, if that isn't whack I don't know what is. I wasnforced to go to every single one of those things, and I personally liked to see Izzy fall on his butt during the match. Itnbrought joy to my life. He was equally fond ofnwatching me trip on the ropes when me and Shauna and Keisha jumped atnrecess, and made a big show of teasing me about it later. But that wasn't itneither. The day I realized I was in love with Izzy Daniels was whennwere in high school. Recently, he and his sister Karin had come tonwatch me and Shauna and Keisha at the city Double Dutch competitions.nHe'd gotten all excited about it, even though he tried to deny thenfact he'd liked it. Anyway, then he'd found us hangin' in thenstreet 'cause one of the jumpers, Yolanda, had ditched us for thenDutch Dragons, some whack team we beat in Regionals. But that came later.nIzzy proved to us he could jump, and he offered to practice with us.nHonestly, to watch Boxer Boy jump rope was just too good, so I agreednto let him practice with us to get us ready for Regionals. I remember the nightnlike it was yesterday. Izzy'd shown us some trippy jumpers, thesenkids jumping at the elementary school, 'cause he said my routinenwas boring and we needed to liven it up and have some fun. Afternwatching those kids, I had to agree. The schoolyard brought back oldnmemories of me chasing Izzy around at recess, threatening to kissnhim, and Izzy chasing me around, threatening to punch me. We spent anlot of time in the principal's office then. Then we were making upnrhymes about ourselves. Izzy, of course, was arrogant about it, butnhe was good. Then Rodney showed up. Rodney was thenneighborhood bully, always had been, and Izzy and I had teamed upnagainst him a couple times. One time Rodney called me names, and Izzynpunched him in the gut. Rodney then gave Izzy a black eye, and Inkicked Rodney in the shin. We ran off then, and I helped Izzy withnhis black eye. I stole a bag of frozen peas from the freezer and wensat on my balcony, swinging our legs over the edge, Izzy holding thenbag of peas to his eye and keeping the swelling down. Anyway, Rodney wasnharassing Izzy, but Izzy didn't want to fight. I had this suddennurge to do something, before Izzy ended up a bloody pulp ornsomethin', and I looked around for something to grab. There was anlittle water jug on a table near me, so I reached over and grabbednit. \"Hey Rodney, why don't you cool off?\" I said, and I dumpednall that icy water on his head. I then dropped the jug and we tooknoff running. We went running down the block, and Rodney came afternus. Us girls squealed and shrieked, the adrenaline pumping through mynveins so fast I could've outrun a cheetah. But Rodney fell behindnand we went streaking through the alley. As we were running, Izzynslowed down and did some fancy flipping. He was lucky he didn't getnbeat. \"Show off!\" Izzynlaughed and we kept running. We split up at thenpizza place on Third. Shauna, Keisha, and I had to go home to do ournhomework and stuff, and Shauna and Keisha live in the same directionnso they went one way. I went the opposite of Izzy, who had to stop atnthe store for something. I was in my room laternthat night, brushing my hair, when I heard Izzy go slamming throughnhis house. He has this weird habit of making this big entry when hencomes home, like it's a show and he's making sure everyone knowsnhe's back. He bangs open the front door, stomps or dances his waynup the stairs, slams open his bedroom door, generally imitating anstampede when he comes inside. Naturally I heard him, and I set downnmy brush and walked out onto my balcony. \"Hey Goofy!\" Incalled. The light flicked on in his room, and I heard the rustle ofnhis backpack as he set it on his bed or something. Then that fuzzballnmop of his poked out the window, followed by the rest of his head,nand he grinned at me. I grinned back.n\"Thanks,\" I said. Izzy chuckled. \"Fornwhat?\" I paused. \"Nothing,\"nI said. Then I changed my mind. \"Everything.\" I shook my head. \"Indon't know.\" Izzy laughed, pullednhimself out of his window while I casually strolled toward thenstairs. As he was climbing up the ladder, he said, \"So uh, thosenjumpers were pretty cool, huh?\" I smiled. \"Well,nwell, well, look who likes Double Dutch,\" I replied sarcastically. By this time Izzy wasnstanding in front of me. He looked over his shoulders. \"Who?\" henasked, though the smirk he was wearing said he knew exactly who I wasntalking about. \"You always havenjokes, huh?\" He chuckled again.nNormally, his laugh would've been grating on my ears, but the morenhe laughed, the more I liked the sound. Isn't that weird. \"Indon't know,\" he said, smiling. \"I guess I do.\" He looked upnto meet my eyes again. \"You know it's just… there's somethingnabout it.\" \"Better than boxing?\"nI asked. I shrugged. \"It's okay if you do. You know.\" The smile faded fromnhis face. \"It's complicated,\" he mumbled. \"My dad… boxing'snkind of his thing.\" I never realized hownmuch I liked Izzy's smile. His teeth were bright, and shiny, andnhis pale, plush lips framed them nicely. His smile was capable ofnlighting up a moment, or my entire day. When it faded from his mouth,nI missed it, and I wanted him to smile again. I started rambling,ntrying to ignore my newfound feelings. \"That's what I thoughtnabout ballet,\" I said. \"Every September, my mom would sign me up.nIt was like school started, so ballet started.\" I shrugged. \"Inthought she loved it. Then last year, I finally said, 'Mom, I hatenballet.' \" I looked up at Izzy. \"And you know what she said?\"nHis eyes met mine, and we stared at each other. My heart was racingnin my chest. \" 'Good, 'cause you look like a horse gallopingnacross the stage anyway.' \" We laughed again, and Inliked the sound of it more and more. Since I was in an observantnmood, I noticed how dark Izzy's eyes were. I remember when we werenlittle I compared them to mud. Now, though, I thought they were thencolor of bittersweet chocolate. It's my favorite kind, I dunno why.nBut that was the kind of vibe I was getting from him right then. Kindnof… bittersweet. After a moment, hensighed. \"But… boxing's all my dad really has.\" \"No,\" I murmured.n\"He has you.\" Izzy gave me a weirdnlook, raised his eyebrows and everything. \"Corny much?\" \"I'm just saying!\"nWe laughed again, Izzy's teeth catching the moonlight. I nevernrealized how cute he was. Oh man, I thought,nsomething's definitely wrong with me if I'm thinking IzzynDaniels is cute. But I did. \"Thanks,\" he said,nlooking at me again. \"But it's just not that easy.\" He just looked so cutenin that moment. I don't know, but the way he looked into my eyesnwith his bittersweet chocolate irises, and the way his lips curved upnin a slight, wan smile made my heart was pound so loud in my ears Inwas afraid he could hear it. In that moment, everything changed. Smiling slightly, Inleaned forward, placing a hand on his shoulder for balance, and Inpressed my lips to his for a split second. When I pulled back, thenadrenaline ebbed away, and I was shocked at what I'd just done.nIzzy wasn't doing much better in the surprised department; henlooked pretty shocked himself. I started to back away,na blush steadily creeping onto my cheeks. \"Um… I'm gonna gonwork on that new routine,\" I said slowly, heading for my window.n\"See you tomorrow.\" \"Bright and early,\"nhe mumbled. My ears were hot.n\"Yeah,\" I said, then I stumbled through the door and gentlynclosed it. Then I leaned against the glass and slid down till I wasnseated on the floor. My heart was racing, my face was on fire, and mynbreathing was shallow. I'd just kissed IzzynDaniels. I let the news sink in.nAfter sitting on the floor for a few minutes, I pulled myself up andnwandered around my room, stuck in a daze. My fingers brushed againstnmy vanity, and I realized something else. I'd kissed IzzynDaniels… and I'd liked it. With that in my head, Incouldn't help it. I wrapped my arms around myself and squealed. Inclicked a button on my stereo and instantly some hip-hop song wasnblasting through the speakers. Overcome with my happiness, I startednspinning around my room, lip-synching the words. For once Inimprovised, the adrenaline rushing back as I twirled and kicked andnswung my hair in time with the beat. Thirty seconds later mynmom was shouting, \"You turn off that music right now MarynThomas, and get in your bed this instant !\" I snapped off thenstereo and flopped onto my mattress, pressing my hands to my heart innan effort to slow it down some. It wasn't really working. Once my legs stoppednshaking, I changed into my pajamas and crawled into bed. As I wasnlaying there, staring at the ceiling, another realization hit me. I was truly, madly,ndeeply in love with Izzy Daniels. And I was okay with it. I snuggled beneath mynblankets, already looking forward to tomorrow. 'Cause that meant Inwould get to see Izzy again.

This is my new twoshot and I hope you like it! Disclaimer: I do not own the characters! Izzy Daniels jogged up the stairs to school, and the first thing that he saw when he reached the landing, were pink flyers taped to the door. Izzy frowned and walked over, pulling one off the wall. His eyes widened in shock as he realized that it was him. A sick feeling entered the pit of his stomach and he swallowed with difficulty, pulling another flyer off the wall. It couldn't have been Tammy Lewis, she had promised that she wouldn't! He took a short breath and then pushed open the door into the school. His eyes widened even more as he realized they were all over the walls and people had them in their hands. And they were all looking at him. \"Hey! I see him!\" Someone yelled. \"Can't believe he showed up,\" someone else muttered. Izzy bit his lip and pushed through the crowds of people. Two familiar faces turned up through the crowd and both of them were laughing, holding the flyers in their hands. Izzy clenched his hand into a fist as he realized they were laughing at him. Chuck Coley had his arm resting on Earl Jackson's shoulder. \"You look real good, Izzy,\" Earl snorted. Izzy glared at both of them and Chuck detected he wasn't quite in the mood for joking. \"Yo, what's up, Izzy?\" Chuck asked, still grinning. \"Absolutely nothing, I'm feeling great!\" Izzy snapped at them and pushed past. Chuck frowned in confusion, the smile on his face completely wiped off and even Earl looked a bit confused. Rodney Tyler and his side-kick, Devon James, suddenly appeared, proud grins on their faces. Izzy groaned inwardly. Why hadn't he thought of it before? Of course it was Rodney who had done it. He had known deep down that Tammy hadn't done anything! But, that hardly made a difference now…The damage had been done… \"I went with the pink,\" Rodney sneered, holding up a flyer. \"Nice touch, huh?\" Devon laughed as well and Izzy shoved past them. Mary Thomas glared at her locker, which was covered in pink flyers of Izzy. She swiped at the flyers and threw them on the ground. The laughing around her increased and she spun around to see Izzy running past, people laughing and pointing at him. He saw her out of the corner of his eye, but turned quickly, pushing open a door and running through. \"Hey, girl,\" Shauna Keaton said in a subdued voice. Mary turned and saw her two best-friends, Shauna and Keisha Ray, standing there. They also had flyers in their hands and dull looks on their faces. \"You know this is, like, totally our fault?\" Shauna muttered. \"If we hadn't asked him to join the team—or even fill in—then he'd be totally cool right now.\" Keisha nodded and sighed, looking the way that Izzy had just made a break for. \"He knew this would happen, that's why he didn't want to join,\" Keisha muttered. Mary felt sick in her gut as she got her books of her locker, slammed the door closed and stalked off. Izzy sprinted out of the school, the pink flyers still clenched in his hand. Mary watched him running from the second storey of their school. One part of her wanted to run after him and apologize for everything, and another part of her wanted to keep her distance, and just hide from guilt. She had been so nasty to him when he had told her about his dad and the boxing match. Like Keisha and Shauna had said, he couldn't just turn down his dad. He had risked everything for them—his reputation, his relationship with his dad, his possible boxing career—and then she had gone and shoved it all back in his face. Mary was certain that things couldn't get worse. Izzy shoved open the door of the house and dragged himself upstairs. His dad would be at the gym and not home until four, half an hour after Izzy usually got home. Izzy dropped onto his bed and flopped back, the flyers drifting out of his hand and onto the ground. He shoved his hands into the pockets of his navy hoodie as he stared up at the ceiling, positive that things couldn't get any worse.[Chapter 2] Right peoples, here's the second half of the story! Hope you liked it! Mary couldn't concentrate. She had been attempting to concentrate on her lessons all morning and she couldn't. Her mind kept replaying everything that had happened. She hadn't expected Izzy to come back to school, although deep-down she was hoping he would. He would be faced with much more mockery and teasing, and no-one wanted that. Finally, when the bell rang to signal lunch, she slipped out from the back of the school and jogged home. She climbed up the steps of the fire-escape and looked in on Izzy's room. He was lying on his back, staring up at the ceiling. Mary sighed and knocked on the window lightly. Izzy looked over at her and for a moment, Mary thought that he might get up and open the window, but then he rolled over and faced the opposite wall. Mary sighed and tapped on the window again. Izzy got up and walked over to the window. \"What do you want?\" He asked dully as he opened the window. Mary opened her mouth to say something, but she realized that she didn't know what to say. She had wanted to talk to Izzy all day, but she realized that she didn't know what she had wanted to say. That she understood, that she was sorry… \"I am so sorry Izzy!\" Mary finally said. Izzy sighed and shrugged. \"It's all good, it's not your fault,\" he murmured. Mary couldn't believe that Izzy was still being so nice about it. It was making it so much worse. She would've preferred it if he got angry at her, yelled at her…But he was being nice about it. \"It is my fault, Izzy! I should never gotten you to join the Double Dutch team! And I shouldn't have gotten mad at you when you went with your dad…I'm so sorry Izzy,\" Mary finished, biting on her lower lip. Izzy shrugged again and looked away. \"Izzy…\" \"It's fine, Mary!\" Izzy suddenly burst out. \"No it isn't!\" Mary cried. \"It's about as far from fine as it gets!\" Izzy sighed and climbed out the window, sitting on the fire escape beside her. Mary was surprised, but turned and sat next to him. \"Why are you being so nice to me? It's our fault—my fault—that you're in this mess to begin with. Why can't you just…yell at me…or something?\" Mary mumbled, looking down at the ground. Izzy smiled slightly and turned to her. Mary looked at him, guiltiness showing in her eyes. \"Would that make you feel better?\" He asked her lightly. Mary sighed. \"Not exactly,\" she muttered. \"Then I'm not gonna do it,\" Izzy replied. \"I like Double Dutch and I'm going to city with you…I like Double Dutch,\" he repeated in an undertone. Mary smiled and placed her head on his shoulder. Izzy wrapped an arm around her and nodded. \"I'm not going for you or the girls, I'm going because I want to…and no-one is going to stop me.\" \"Not even your dad or your mates?\" Mary asked softly. \"No, not even my dad or my mates,\" Izzy replied. He leaned down and kissed her softly on the mouth. Mary smiled. \"Um…Thanks,\" she murmured. Izzy grinned. \"You're welcome,\" he replied. They laughed and went back to sitting silently in each others arms. Finito! Please review! ","Summary":" Hey guys! This is my new twoshot and I hope you like it!

They are both were told that their friend from their hometown, Tuck, has passed away. Amanda and Dawson go back to their hometown to attend the funeral. They also go through his belongings since he left everything in their name. They have to choose who gets the house and who gets what since they are not a couple. The two of them go through things together and realize that they never stopped loving each other. But now it's time for them to go back to their reality. \"Wow I never thought it would be this hard to say goodbye.\" Amanda said. Dawson looked at Amanda with a worried look. \"Amanda just stay here with me now.\" Dawson said with his arms wide open. Amanda stared at Dawson for a couple seconds, and then said, \"I knew I still loved you. I told you I would forever. Why did you not talk to me while you were in prison?\" Dawson stared blankly as he thought of a way to describe his reasoning to her without sounding like an asshole. \"I know what I did was wrong, but I did not want to make you wait around for me. You had so much going for you. I knew you would eventually move on and find someone who made you happy.\" said Dawson as he began to tear up. Amanda immediately fired back as she also began to tear up. Amanda said \"You told me that we would be together forever, but you ruined that when you would not talk to me while you were in prison. We could have worked through all of this. Now look at us, I have to go back home to my family. You expect me to just give up everything I have at home?\" Dawson was not giving up on Amanda; he shot right back at her with thoughts of their future together. \"We can figure things out. You had mentioned earlier that you have wanted a divorce from your husband. I know it will not be the easiest transition, but if you truly still love me like you're saying you do then we can work through this, right? I am sure that your son will understand why you do not want to be with your husband. I am sure that he has seen that you are unhappy with your life. He can stay with us until he goes away to school like you said he was.\" \"Dawson, I love you but I also love my son. I want what is best for him. If I have to be unhappy so that he can live a happy life then I will do it. I have done it for long enough. Ever since you left me.\" Amanda began to look towards her vehicle and started walking away from Dawson. She spoke as walking away, \"I need to go now, Dawson. I knew coming here would be a bad idea.\" Dawson still was not giving up on Amanda. He started chasing after her and bursting out all of his ideas of their happy life that he wants to have with her. \"Amanda stop, please! We can get married and have children like we always wanted. We can try for a girl and name her, Bea. You are an amazing woman, look at you. But now we are here and now we have the chance to live our lives together again. If I could go back we would have never been separated.\" Amanda then stopped walking away from him. She began to look him in the eyes once again. \"Dawson, I never stopped loving you. I want to be with you. I will go home and tell Frank and Jared about this. I am going to leave the final decision up to Jared though. After all he is what has been getting me through these years. I will come back as soon as I know the answer. Goodbye Dawson.\" \"I understand completely, Amanda. I hope that the next time you come back here, it is so that we can begin to live our life together forever. I love you Amanda\" Dawson watched as Amanda drove away, crying. Making the Decision Amanda goes back to her family and tells her husband, Frank, how she feels about Dawson. \"Frank, we need to talk\" said Amanda Frank looked very confused on why Amanda so suddenly wants to speak. Frank then says: \"Okay, what is going on Amanda? You just got back and you are already being odd.\" Amanda begins to tell Frank how she feels about Dawson \"Do you remember when I told you about my high school sweetheart, Dawson?\" \"Yes I do\", says Frank Frank is now worried. \"Well Frank, I am sorry but I am still in love with him. I spent the week with him last week. I am not and have not been happy with you. He makes me truly happy and I want to spend the rest of my life with him.\" Frank is in shock that she is so unhappy with him and their life together. Frank then says \"Well, we will need to discuss this with Jared.\" They both call Jared down to talk to them. Amanda beings telling Jared by saying \"Jared, I am still in love with Dawson Cole.\" Jared is completely in shock that his mother is in love with another man other than his father. Jared tells Amanda, \"I just want you to be happy, mom. If you are trying to tell me that you want to get a divorce then you have my okay.\" Frank and Amanda agree to get a divorce. Jared is fine with their choice as well. Amanda tells Jared that she told Dawson that she would go back and tell him what the decision was. Jared says, \"Let me come with you. I would really like to meet this guy. I am sure he is as great as you have always said.\" Amanda is in shock and also thrilled that Jared is as happy as she is to move on in their life. The both of them then begin packing their belongings. They both get in the car and make their way to Dawson. They arrive at Tuck's house. Amanda gets out of the vehicle first. Dawson only sees Amanda. Dawson- \"Amanda! It is so great to see you!\" Amanda smiles and looks at Jared as he opens the car door. Amanda says, \"Dawson it is great to see you as well. This is my son, Jared.\" Dawson's smile gets even bigger than it was before. Dawson says, \"So, you are the famous, Jared. I have heard a lot of great things about you! It is nice to finally meet you.\" Jared smiles then says, \"I have also heard a lot of great things about you! It is great to meet you.\" Amanda chimes in and says, \"So Dawson, I hope you have room for two more in there.\" Dawson is now the happiest he has been in years. \"Well of course!\" says Dawson Amanda and Jared move all of their things into Tucks house. Three Weeks Later Jared is in his room packing and getting his things ready to go to college. Dawson enters the room to tell him some big news. Dawson says, \"Hey Jared, do you have a minute?\" \"Sure\" says Jared. Dawson-\"How would you feel if I asked your mother to marry me?\" Jared- \"That would be great! I know how much she loves you and cares about you. I am sure she would be the happiest woman on this planet if you asked her to marry you. Go for it! I would be more than happy to have you a part of our family.\" Dawson- \"Thank you so much Jared. I would like to have you there for the proposal.\" Jared- \"I would love to be!\" Dawson- \"Meet me outside in about ten minutes.\" Jared- \"Sounds good!\" Dawson leaves the room and makes his way outside. Amanda will be arriving from work any minute. Amanda is driving up the lane as Dawson goes outside to greet her as he always does. Dawson- \"How was your day?\" Amanda- \"Great, especially now that I get to see you.\" Dawson gets down on one knee. Dawson- \"Amanda, are you ready to spend the rest of our lives together?\" Amanda starts tearing up and bursts out with, \"Of course I am!\" Amanda stops suddenly for a minute and says, \"Dawson I have something to tell you. You know how I have not been feeling well lately? Well I took a pregnancy test the other day and it was positive. Then I went to the doctors today and had a sonogram; it turns out that we are having two babies. \"Wow guys that is great! I am really happy for you!\" Dawson is so excited; he is jumping with joy. Dawson, Amanda, and Jared all have a group hug. Dawson and Amanda both look at each other with a cheerful look. The both of them are so happy that they are able to finally live their lives together as they had always wanted. The three of them continue to live their happy lives. Jared goes away to college.

Don't you worry, I'm as cool as a cucumber.\" \"Good girl, let's not have a reenactment of Summer In The City okay? I'll be round in a taxi about 7ish.\" \"It was the heat! God!\" \"Yeah yeah, anyway wear something sexy, even though you always look sexy, my sexy little monkey.\" \"You're the biggest cringer. I'll see you later\" I giggled and hung up the phone. I was now frantic, running around my room pulling out old dresses and outfits from my wardrobe. I had no clue what to wear. It was 1:00pm, and knowing me, it would take me at least 4 hours to be ready, so I ran myself a bath. Oh god, I thought, I'm going to need some serious girl advice on what to wear. Although Bertie, Dom, and the others had all invited me out before and I'd not given a second thought about what I was wearing, this time it was different. Dan's going to be there. Yes, the Sex God himself, Dan Howell. I'd met Dan at a meet up before, and it was definitely the worst experience of my whole life. We were at Summer In The City, and Bertie had introduced me to Pj, Chris, Dan, & Phil. I thought I was in love with all four of them, I genuinely thought I was going to be sick with excitement. I'd been watching them all on YouTube for ages, and meeting them in person was even better than I expected. They were so lovely to talk to, and so fucking good looking. I was feeling rather hot and bothered. I was so overwhelmed by everything, all the screaming girls, the hot summer weather, and I hadn't eaten or drank much that day, and... I passed out. Yes. I fainted, and woke up in Dan's arms. Him and Phil helped me, whilst Chris and Pj went to get me some water. It was so embarrassing. I remember Dan's words after I'd woken up. \"I have that effect on women\" He smiled at me, making me feel as if I were going to faint again. \"It was the heat I swear\" I insisted, blushing. I looked deep into his chocolate brown eyes, and appreciated just how beautiful he was. He picked me up off the ground brushed me down, and we went off for a walk somewhere more quiet. We had a full blown conversation, and I think after a while he didn't think I was such a dork. Unfortunately, Bertie found us and came and dragged me off to help him find Dom, but Dan still gave me a nice hug, and jokingly told me to keep drinking water. He smiled and waved. I thought my heart was going to implode, he was unbelievable. Bertie told me he was a bit of a flirt, but no one had ever made my heart pound so much. Chapter 2. It was 6:59pm, and I was only just ready. After texting my friends asking for advice on what to wear and them being no help what so ever, I found my favourite LBD, and a nice pair of heels that I hadn't worn in forever. My hair was in big curls, I was wearing gold jewellery with a matching clutch bag. As I was applying the last of my lipgloss, my phone buzzed with text from Roy. get yo shit together home girl we're outside x I walked out into the cold to the taxi waiting across the street, walking like a retard. My heels were already pissing me off. God I hate being feminine sometimes, it kills, I thought. Dom opened the taxi door for me and helped me in. \"Fuck!\" Bertie's mouth dropped. \"What?\" I said as I sat down in the seat in between him and Dom. \"You...\" Bertie replied. \"Look amazing\" Roy finished. \"Aww thank you!\" \"Where did you get that dress from? I want one!\" Harrison joked, playing with my curls. \"Nob.\" I laughed at him. \"That dress is rather tight.\" Dom pointed out, as I watched his eyes slowly move down to my cleavage. I was used to the boys being the way they were, and their flattering/slightly perverted comments. After all, they were like brothers to me, no matter how insect it sounds. We arrived at the party, and walked out in style. I won't lie I felt like a Bond girls, but with three James Bonds walking beside me... The house was huge, with beautiful chandeliers and spiraling staircases. There was a massive chocolate fountain in the center of the kitchen, literally the size of a small car. Someone came over and offered us all a glass of champagne. We went round saying hi to everyone. I saw the back of someones head out the corner of my eye, and next to him was someone identical, I thought I was seeing double. Drunk already Ellie? But then they turned around. It was Jack and Finn. I gasped and turned to Bertie who was chatting away to a group of people. \"Bertie! It's Jack & Finn, oh my god, introduce me pretty please?!\" Bertie rolled his eyes, took me by the arm and walked me over to them. \"Jack, Finn! how you doing guys, haven't seen you in ages!\" They done that chest collision hand shake thingy that guys do. The twins looked just as beautiful in the flesh. I tried to play it cool, but almost spilled my champagne glass as Jack came and stood next to me. \"Yo Bertie Bert! Who's this lovely lady?\" Jack looked me up and down. \"This is my pal Ellie.\" \"Well hello.\" Jack grabbed my hand and kissed it, smiling at me. \"He's had a bit drink already\" Finn smiled. We talked to the twins for a while, and I became a little more comfortable around everyone at the party. We drank, and laughed, and joked with each other, and then Alfie, Marcus, Sam, and Caspar came to join us. I felt like it was all a big dream, hanging out with people I'd be watching on a laptop screen for months. They were just the best people to be with, so down to earth and relazed. Jack had his hand round my waste most of the time. I got all of their numbers (sidenote = OMFG ASDFGHJKL). I was telling them about my YouTube channel, and they asked if I'd ever be interested in being in one of their videos. I told them I'd love to, and Finn even asked if I'd like a cheeky nandos with them all later on in the week. I could have fangirled there and then, and drowned in a pool of screams and tears, but I simply said: \"That sounds very cheeky, I'd love to, I'll give you a text next week.\" and I gave them all a kiss on the cheek, and walked away. Bertie came and found me by the bar pouring myself another glass of champagne. \"Check you, getting their numbers!\" \"Oh Bert they are so perfect, all of them! I can't actually believe I had drinks with Jack & Finn Harries, Sam Pepper, Alfie Deyes, AND Marcus Butler! I swear I'm dreaming.\" \"You are SUCH a fangirl.\" \"I know, I know\" I grinned at him, and gave him a big hug. He squeezed me back, and started to slow dance with me. As he spun me around, I saw a group of people come through the front door. Everyone was there, greeting them. I couldn't quite make out who it was. But then I saw someone. They were wearing a black jumper with studs, and black skinny jeans with a studded belt, and trendy white shoes. He was tall and slim, the perfect body shape. And then I recognised him. Of course. It was Dan, with Phil, Chris, Pj, Charlie, Alex and Carrie, all walking in behind him. They all looked incredible. Carrie was in a beautiful flowery dress, clinging on to Alex, who was wearing the craziest pants I've ever seen. Phil looked flawless, as always, in a plaid shirt and skinny jeans. In fact all four of them were wearing the same skinny jeans as they were in the video \"Fantastic Foursome Twister\". Dan & Phil walked over to greet Ben Cook who was with a big group. I was still dancing with Bertie and I made him dance nearer to them. I could just about hear their conversation. They were talking about Becoming YouTube. I couldn't stop staring at Dan. He was probably one of the most under-dressed people here, but he still managed to look the most attractive. All of a sudden, Pj came running towards us. You could smell alcohol on him. \"Bertie! My baby brother oh Bertie.\" He flung his arms around him, almost knocking me over. \"Oh I'm sorry...Ellie! I remember you! You were the one that fainted that time!\" He spoke so loudly, Dan & Phil overheard and turned to look at me. My face went so red. \"Hi Peej, haha, yes, erm...\" Pj wrapped his arms around me and picked me up. Dan stopped talking to Ben and came over to us. \"Peej man, it's its only quarter to ten slow down!\" He pulled Pj away and smiled at me. I blushed as I took a sip of my champagne. \"Aww Dan, Daniel, Daniel Howell.\" Pj wrapped his arms around Dan and tried to kiss him on the cheek. Chris came round the corner and saw Pj. \"Oh Peej, what's he like. Ellie, hi! Remember me?\" He smiled. \"How could I forget you!\" \"Fainted at all recently?\" \"Nope, I've been drinking lots of water.\" I smiled and Chris grinned back. \"Chris, could you get me a beer?\" Dan asked. \"Get me one Christopher!\" Pj shouted and then wrapped his arms around Chris. \"Come on then we'll go get some more drinks, Bertie, Ellie, what can I get you?\" \"No thanks Chris man, I've gotta pee and go and find the boys\" Bertie said, he looked at Dan, and looked back at me and whispered, \"play it cool yeah\" and kissed me on the cheek and walked away. \"Right then, another champagne for the lovely lady?\" Chris smiled at me. \"Actually, can I have a vodka and coke please?\" \"On it. Come on Peej.\" Chris stumbled off, Pj by his side cheering and jumping about to Skrillex. It was just me and Dan. \"Hey.\" He smiled. \"Hey.\" I smiled back. \"You look nice, I think I have those heels.\" He joked. \"Don't think these would fit those big feet of yours\" I looked down at his shoes. He laughed and looked down too. \"You know what they say about boys with big feet.\" He said with a seductive smile. \"Big socks?\" \"Hell yeah.\" Phil came over to us, he also looked like he'd been drinking a bit. \"Oh hi! I remember you! You were the one at Summer In The City-\" \"That fainted yeah.\" \"Haha, aww sorry is it embarrassing?\" \"A little, haha.\" \"Dan, why aren't you drinking?\" Phil's speech was slightly slurred. \"I'm waiting for a beer actually, can you go and see if Chris has got me one yet?\" Dan seemed as though he was trying to get people away from us. Phil nodded and went looking for Peej and Chris. \"Have you tried the chocolate fountain yet?\" Dan asked with wide eyes. \"No not yet!\" \"Lets go.\" We both snuk over to the fountain and I dipped in a strawberry and he dipped in a marshmallow. \"Oh my god this is so good.\" He said as shoved another one in his mouth. \"I feel the urge to dip my whole face in it.\" \"Do it, yolo.\" \"Dan you did not just say that.\" \"I just did.\" After a while we both got full up on the fountain, and Dan went to get us both on drink, as Pj, Chris, and Phil had failed in doing so. We sat down on a sofa where it was a bit more quiet and less crowded. We were sitting together talking about YouTube and what he's hoping to do with his channel next, and all sorts of things. He asked me how my channel was doing, and was giving me editing tips and ideas. We exchanged numbers and stuff, and he then drastically changed the subject. \"So, you and Bertie eh?\" Dan said sipping at his beer. \"Oh, we're just really close friends.\" I replied. \"Fair enough, got your eye on anyone tonight then?\" \"Well, I did get a cheeky invite to go to Nandos with Jack & Finn.\" \"Oh you've met the twins then.\" \"Mmm yes.\" \"So, you're gonna go out with them then?\" \"I might do, why?\" \"Just wondered\" He looked away. I was curious as to where he was going with this. \"What about you, go your eye on anyone?\" \"Ha, nope.\" He said it almost sarcastically. \"Why's that then? No one here your taste?\" \"No, it's not that, I just...I dunno.\" I looked at him with a confused face. He smiled and then looked down and shook his head. \"What?\" \"You've got a bit of chocolate on your lip.\" \"Oh shit.\" I said hiding my face and going red again. He leaned over to me and lifted my chin up. \"It's cool I got it.\" He smiled and kissed me softly on my bottom lip. My stomach flipped. I thought I was going to hurl. Not in a bad way, like in a what-the-actual-fuck-dan-howell-just-kissed-me-I-can't-breathe-I-feel-sick-with-happiness kind of way. I giggled uncontrollably. \"What?\" He seemed shocked. \"Nothing, I just giggle when I'm nervous and talk really fast and just don't know when to shut up because it's been a long time since I've had any male confrontation and-\" Before I could finish my sentence he interrupted me with another kiss, kissing me a bit harder this time, and slowly moved his lips. It was a proper kiss now. I could hear my own heart beat, and my stomach was filled with butterflies. I put my arms around his neck, and he put his hands on my waist. He slowly slipped his tongue into my mouth. It felt so right, not too slimy at all. His lips were so soft and gentle, but he also moved his mouth with passion. I slipped my tongue into his mouth. We were really picking up the pace now. I felt the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. He grabbed my waist and pulled me in closer. I heard him let out a small moan as we stopped for a breath, then he carried on again. I ran my fingers through his perfect dark smooth hair. I could feel it inside me now. I felt urges that I couldn't even explain. I wanted him. I wanted him to be with ME, alone. He stopped kissing me after a good 5 minutes and pulled away, smiling like mad. I was flustered and overwhelmed. \"Now I can blame you if I faint.\" He laughed and slouched back into his chair and got out his phone to look at the time. \"When does the party finish?\" I asked slouching back onto the comfy sofa. \"I don't know, but me and Phil will probably go about 3:30-ish, where are you staying tonight?\" \"Erm, oh, I er, didn't actually think about that.\" \"Are you just gonna get a cab back home?\" \"I don't have money for a cab, I'll just walk.\" \"No don't walk! I'll give you some money for a cab.\" \"No don't be silly, I live too far it will cost too much!\" Dan paused for a moment. \"Come back with us for the night.\" \"What?\" \"Mine and Phil's place, we'll set up the sofa for you, I'd feel better knowing you were indoors rather than making your own way home, especially when you've been drinking. London's dangerous at night.\" \"Well, would Phil be okay with it?\" Just as I asked, Phil came over. \"Hey Phil.\" I smiled at him and patted the seat for him to come and sit next to me. \"Ellie! Hey girlfriend.\" He laughed as he sat down, poking his little tongue out. He was too adorable. \"Phil, Ellie doesn't have enough money for a cab to get home, is it alright if she comes back to ours and we set up the sofa bed or something?\" \"Of course! You don't even need to ask, you're welcome to come and see us anytime!\" \"Aww thank you.\" I gave Phil a hug. He giggled and threw my hands up in the air dancing to the music. \"So what have you two been getting up to then eh?\" Phil winked at Dan. \"Oh ya know, Dan's being practicing CPR on me just incase I faint again.\" I said, and smiled at Dan, he winked back. \"Is that code word for doing naughty things?\" Phil giggled again. \"You'd never believe this man is 27.\" Dan said as he turned to watch his best friend stand up and dance the macarena. For the rest of the night me, Dan, Chris, Pj, & Phil all drank, a lot, and danced and played drinking games and went and socialized with tons of people. It was mental. I'd never laughed so hard in all my life. We all played spin the bottle, and Pj & Chris were made to kiss, tongues and everything, and Jack & Dean (omfgitsjackanddean). It was like every fangirl's dream, and I was witnessing it. At about 4:00am everyone started leaving. We said bye to everyone, and I got pictures and hugs with all the YouTubers. Dan & Phil only lived in the block of flats 3 minutes away from the party. I was really drunk, and my heels were impossible to walk in, so Dan carried picked me up, and gave me a fireman's carry home. Phil was taking pictures all the way home, laughing and threatening to put them all on tumblr, even the ones where you could see right up my skirt. We finally got home and Dan put the kettle on, I immediately took off my heels and let out a sigh of relief. I walked into the living room and looked around. It was so weird, seeing them in their flat in their videos, then there I was, standing in their living, staying the night. ","Summary":" Chapter 1.

Era increíble la velocidad en la que pasa el tiempo cuando quieres que nunca acabe. Yo sabía cómo terminaría esto, pero no quería creerlo. Él me prometió que no estaría conmigo para siempre, yo prefería no pensar en eso. Odiaba la idea de no poder verlo junto a mí en la cama al despertar cada mañana. No quería pensar que no volvería a besarlo, a acariciarlo, a no volver a decirle cuanto lo amaba. Él me lo advirtió, sus palabras eran suaves y entrecortadas. Jamás había llorado tanto en mi vida, no quería perderlo, pero el destino ya estaba escrito. Y no podía cambiarlo. Sus padres jamás me quisieron. Ellos querían que Justin viviera los últimos años de su vida junto a ellos. Nunca les prestamos atención. Justin no quería a sus padres, según él eran una molestia. Levante mi cabeza mirando al cielo, las gotas de lluvia cubrieron mi rostro enseguida. Una pequeña y frígida sonrisa se asomó en mis labios. Era la primera luego de llorar una semana completa. Él dijo que debía de sonreír, y no dejar de hacerlo. Pero era imposible. Yo solo había asentido con la cabeza antes de que besara. No quería que este con él, decía que no quería lastimarme. Yo me arriesgue. Por el amor sentía por él. Y por el que estaba segura que el sentía por mí. Trate de darle los mejores 3 daños de su vida. Decidimos mudarnos a una pequeña casa en Newcastle. Plantamos rosas escarlatas en el jardín. Nuestra casa siempre olía a rosas. Conocerlo fue lo mejor que pude a verme pasado… Estaba terminando un trabajo para universidad, tenía que aprobar los últimos exámenes para recibirme completamente en abogacía. Estaba en Starbucks. A las 10:35 p.m. ya no había nadie en la calle. Estaba más que concentrada escribiendo en mi ordenador. Sentí unos pasos acercarse a mí, levante un poco mi vista y vi a un muchacho parado frente a mí. Tenía unos jeans negros, una remera blanca con el logo de la cafetería y una gorra de color verde. Cuando vi sus ojos… ¡Dios eran hermosos! Un color miel acaramelado con largas y finas pestañas. Perfectas facciones conformaban su rostro. Y sus labios… eran perfectos. Era la criatura más hermosa que pude haber visto en mi vida. El solo me sonrió y apenas pude corresponderle. La primera vez que lo bese, supe que no quería volver a besar otros labios que no fueran los suyos. Jamás voy a arrepentirme de haber tomado la decisión de quedarme con él. Aunque sabía mejor que nadie que sufriría, y era verdad. Fue y es el dolor más grande que pude haber tenido. No creo que haya algo peor. Justin estaba muerto, y nadie podía devolvérmelo. Ni tampoco los maravillosos momentos que pase junto a él. Justin era mi vida, y se ha ido. El reverendo Hellerman me hecho una mirada, mire hacia mi alrededor. Ya no había nadie en el cementerio. Avance hacia el cajón antes de que lo pusieran bajo tierra. Acaricie la fina madera de roble. Ya no podía distinguir cuando lloraba y cuando no. Las lágrimas formaban parte de mí, y no había nada que pudiera frenarlas. Gire sobre mis talones y comencé a caminar hacia la salida. La lluvia pareció terminar. Y por primera vez en muchos años, un luminoso arcoíris se cruzó en el cielo. Una leve brisa de viento pareció secar mis lágrimas, aunque sea solo por un momento. Una pequeña sonrisa se alojó en mis labios y deje de caminar. Lo sentía, sabía que estaba aquí, junto a mí. Lo sentía muy cerca, ¿nunca pensaron que tenían alguna conexión especial con una persona? Yo sí, y esa persona era Justin. Esboce una sonrisa más grande, cerré mis ojos y negué con la cabeza. Él estaba aquí. Lo sabía. La vida me ha enseñado muchas cosas, una de ellas, es que cuando tienes algo muy bueno, tienes que cuidarlo y conservarlo. Si encuentras a alguien que te complementa y te ama a pesar de todos tus defectos, repítele cada día de tu vida cuanto la amas, pasa tiempo con ella, no peles por tonterías, jamás dejes de sonreírle. Agradécele a Dios que estas vivo, y vive la vida. Si tienes una persona especial que te acompaña cada día, agradécele por ella. Tienes que vivir cada momento como si fuera el último, y jamás bajar los brazos. Lucha, lucha por lo amas, se fuerte a pesar de todo, y lo más importante, ten fe y cree. Justin me hizo feliz, aunque sea solo por 3 años. Solo espero haberlo hecho feliz a él. Él amaba la vida, tenía más deseos de vivir que cualquier otra persona. No hay día que no piense en él, y aunque no vuelva a besarlo, ni a verlo nunca más, sé que él está ahí, conmigo. Y que jamás me abandonará. Porque sé que me ama, y yo lo amo aún más. No sabía que iba a hacer ahora, o que me esperaba más adelante. Lo único que sé, es que jamás lo olvídate, y tratare de ser feliz como el me pidió. Y llevare siempre en mi corazón la última frase que me sito… \"Te amare por siempre…\" ","Summary":" Volví mi mirada hacia el cajón.

This is an assignment where we rewrite the ending so that it parallels the ending of To Kill a Mockingbird . I didn't really enjoy this movie, this is just an English assignment. Enjoy! Art and I were in the Klopek's basement. I was digging in the pile of dirt and dust we found, and Art was watching. He was acting very…different. I wonder. \"Why don't you come and help a guy, eh? Be a friendly neighbor?\" I suggested. This digging was hard work. I had already hit water and blisters were exploding all over my now calloused hands. How do miners do it? \"Nah, I'm looking at something over here,\" Art lied. I could tell. I looked over, and he was studying me with an odd glint in his eye. It was almost…malicious. Decided not to question his motives. I sighed and kept digging. This was tiring. This continued for the better part of an hour. I started to work even more fervently, conscious of Art's piercing eyes on my back. Digging some more, my shovel struck a hard, metal object with a high *ping!* sound. \"Art! I've hit something!\" I cried. Art rushed over. We both were staring at a pipe labeled, \"CAUTION: GAS PIPE. DO NOT MESS WITH UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE.\" We looked at each other with different expressions. Mine panicked; his with glee. \"RUN!\" I screamed. We both started sprinting out of the house in a fury. Art was ahead by a few feet, then when I least expected it, he turned around and shoved me into the hole I had dug. I landing with a painful thud, wincing. I stared at Art in shock. His crazed eyes said it all. Art killed the Knapps. Art killed Walter. Art was the murderer. Art was murdering me. He turned and ran away for his life. I realized how much time I had left and in my peripheral vision saw big movements to my right. I looked over and saw Dr. Klopek's head peeking out of a trapdoor and decided it was either blow up or go with him. I decided to go with the latter option. Dr. Klopek let me through and shut the door, right as the house exploded. We were tossed around in the…hallway? room? chamber? from the impact. As soon as the explosions ceased, Dr. Klopek and I stood up shakily. We were both pretty banged up. Dr. Klopek's usually perfectly quaffed hair stood up in tufts. He had cuts and the starts of bruises everywhere. I figured I was no different. Dr. Klopek's wounds weren't affecting his proper personality. \"Let's get out of here. I'm guessing you do not want to stay, yes?\" I nodded, the shock of the explosion not quite wearing off. We started down the tunnel. I decided the time was right to apologize to Dr. Klopek. \"Dr. Klopek, sir? I'm really sorry about your house, you see we, well, Art, Mark and I thought you Klopek's were—\" \"Murderers?\" I looked at him. I didn't expect him to finish my apology, and with what I was about to say anyways. Dr. Klopek sighed. \"I guess you deserve an explanation, especially with all you've been through today.\" I chuckled at this. \"I suppose.\" Dr. Klopek took a deep breath, and then started to explain everything to me. \"To start, you must know that I study thermodynamics – basically I study the transfer of heat.\" That makes sense. I guess that explains the steam and explosions coming out of his basement. \"These tunnels are explosive-proof because my experiments may go wrong, and I may need to make an escape at a second's notice. I use the furnace for my various experiments. Do you have any questions so far?\" I shook my head no. \"I found out that your friend Art is a murderer by accident. I am not going to go into details, but he used this house when nobody was living in it to store his tools and unfortunate victims. Then we moved in. I came down in the basement to put some boxes down here, and found Art storing bodies in a hole in the floor. He then tried to murder me. I escaped, but just barely. Then, of course, Art found out that I studied thermodynamics and like to experiment. He decided to strike up a bargain – I would not tell anybody about him being a murderer, and Art would let me use this basement for my experiments. I didn't have any choice but to accept these terms, otherwise he would kill me.\" Dr. Klopek shivered. I was stunned. I never knew Art was such a crazed lunatic. \"So what is with the bones in your backyard? My dog was digging them up!\" I asked. Dr. Klopek laughed. \"Oh, those are for our dog – it was trained by its last trainer to dig, that's why you can see us three digging holes to put bones from the pet store in the ground at night.\" I laughed along with him. That's who the grim reaper people are! We emerged from behind a bush in Ricky's yard. The fire department, ambulance, and police are parked up and down the street. Sirens are wailing. There are firefighters, paramedics, and officers scurrying around like chickens with their heads cut off. The neighborhood has been evacuated, all except for Art who is in front of two policemen waving his arms around, trying to tell them something. \"YES the Klopeks KILLED RAY! In the explosion! Well…YES why else would the house blow up? They were trying to kill him! And…UGH WHY DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND? When you go through the remains of the house you will find Ray! Among many others the Klopeks killed!\" Dr. Klopek and I looked at each other. I was all the evidence we needed to finally put a stop to Art's maniacal rant. We walked up to Art and the policemen. When they recognize me, the reactions are immediate. The officers are shell-shocked. Art's expression goes from shocked to furious to downright terrified, like his head is on a chopping block. Which, metaphorically, it was. I decided to break the tension in the air. \"Well, seeing I'm alive, I suppose that's all the evidence we need. Art is lying.\" Dr. Klopek nodded solemnly. The policemen pulled it together and cuffed Art's wrists. \"Mr. Weingartner, you are under arrest. We are taking you down to the courthouse for an immediate trial,\" one said. Art struggled on the way to the police car. Two other officers had to help to restrain him. When they finally shoved him in the car I took a sigh of exhaustion. A paramedic appeared in front of Dr. Klopek and I asking if we were ready to go to the hospital. We gladly consented. When we got into the ambulance one of the paramedics told me he was going to knock me out. I welcomed the blackness. When I came to I was in a hospital bed. I looked at the armchair next to the bed and saw Carol. \"Are you awake?\" she asked. I grunted a reply. Carol chuckled. \"Are you feeling ok?\" I grunted a reply. She laughed. It sounded like the tinkling of bells. \"If you want to know what happened, just say so,\" she said. I sat up. \"What happened to Art?\" \"It took some probing, but he eventually confessed to his murders!\" \"No!\" \"Yes! He has a life-long sentence in jail.\" \"Wow. What happened to the Klopeks?\" \"The City Council found out about Dr. Klopek's experiments. He's not allowed to do them anymore in his house, so they are giving him his own lab to conduct his experiments in!\" \"That's fantastic!\" Carol was quiet for a second afterward. I asked her why. \"Well, it came as a shock to everyone that Art was a murderer. I don't feel safe anymore,\" she whispered. I reached out and grabbed Carol's hand. She held it tight. \"We'll think about that later. After I get out of the hospital, let's go up to the lake. Everything is right. The real murderer has been captured. The Klopeks were proven innocent. We're safe. Let's take Dave up to the lake house.\" Carol sighed. \"That sounds great.\" Looks like there won't be much more chaos for a while.

We met at a train station in London and he helped me lift my bags on board. We got talking and when it got to his stop he gave me his number and the rest is history. Rob has a condition called Autism which makes him behave differently to other people. He gets angry easily and he likes his routine. He was bullied at school and his dad walked out on him. Sometimes when I go to bed early I can hear him crying in the other room. Rob and I were deeply in love and he had proposed to me. We were going to get married and have children; we even had names and everything. I didn't know that could all change with one stupid mistake. It was Friday afternoon and I was walking back home from uni, it was cold but the sun was shinning. I was thinking about my plans for the weekend and how brilliant it was going to be. Tonight I was going to my friend's house and then going to watch one of Rob's plays. He loved acting so much and was going for an audition for a Harry Potter film in a few weeks. I had promised to come for the opening night and he said he couldn't perform until he saw my face on the front row. Then Rob had found a cheap cottage in the country that we were going to spend the weekend in and I couldn't wait. Rob had told me that he was ready, ready to have sex. Rob's condition meant I didn't want to force him into doing things he didn't want to, so I waited til he made the move. And now he had. I had been home; Rob was at his rehearsal, got changed and headed for Sarah's house. I thought we would talk about our boyfriends, eat sweets and maybe watch a film but when I got there I could see the house was packed with people from uni. I pushed my way past them, trying to find Sarah and hear myself think over the music. I eventually found her completely wasted with a vodka bottle in her hand. \"What are you playing at?\" I asked \"Oh chill out Liv, can't a girl have a party\" she laughed and then stumbled away with some guy who was not her boyfriend. I glared after her and was about to leave when a group of my uni friends came up to me and we got talking. I thought if I stay for a drink and then get the bus to Rob's play which started at 8:30pm, it was 7:45pm. Loads of time. My head was fuzzy as I watched my friends laugh and joke. I poured another glass of vodka, I couldn't remember how many I'd had. Then a boy with brown hair and a cute smile walked past me and I immediately thought of Rob. \"Shit!\" I said as I looked at the clock on the wall. It was 9:15pm and it would take me a good 30minutes to get to the theatre. I pulled myself up, still drunk and squeezed past the partiers, out of the door. I ran quickly through the night imagining Rob's disappointment or worse anger when he'd seen I wasn't there. I saw the theatre doors and pushed them open. It was empty. Rob had said it was a sell out and that I was lucky to get a ticket. I checked my watch, 9:35pm. It should still be on. I headed for the stage door where I saw Tom, Rob's friend. \"What's happened, why has the play finished so early?\" I asked, slightly worried \"I don't know, Rob was already to go on really excited and he marched on stage and started looking at the audience for ages. He stood there for a while and then he starting kicking the scenery and swearing. We all tried to calm him down but he was starting to rip at the curtains. Eventually we had to return everyone's money and they all went home. Rob ran out of the theatre and no ones heard anything since.\" Tom replied almost calmly to my annoyance. Waves of guilt and worry washed over me and I rang his phone so much that night but no answer. I rang the police but they told me there was nothing they could do. I went home and he was not there. I only ever see Rob in films now. He got his role in Harry Potter and is now a huge movie star. I still ring his phone twice a day but no answer. I miss Rob and I will never forget him.

Wenn Janelle ihre Messer unbedingt will, kann sie es sich doch selber holen! Doch ich wusste damals noch nicht, was ich jetzt weiß und es war ja nicht so, dass ich Briggs noch nie beim wichsen erwischt hatte. Wir hatten zusammen gedient und auch hier war Privatsphäre ein Luxus. 2. Schublade vom Kasten hinten in der Mitte. Schnell aber leise steuere ich das Zielobjekt, eine alte, morsche Kommode die mir bis zur Hüfte reicht, an. Briggs, nebenan, ist lauter als sonst. „Verdammtes Scheißteil!\", fluche ich leise während ich versuche die klemmende Schublade rauszuziehen. Das Holz splittert als ich es endlich schaffe und mir entfährt ein kleiner, triumphierender Laut. Mit der handschuhlosen Linken durchstöbere ich den Inhalt, der aus Papier und seltsamen, klebrigen Substanzen besteht. Nirgendwo ein Messer in Sicht. Gott! Wo… „ …ahh.\" Ich bleibe wie angewurzelt stehen. Briggs…? „Uhgh. Sammy…!\" Ich bin aus der Tür bevor ich wirklich begreife was da drinnen gerade passiert. Briggs… Mein Kumpel, den ich seit Jahrzehnten kenne, dem ich mein Leben anvertrauen würde, … Wichst zum Gedanken an einen Typen. Einem Jungen! … Scheißmesser! Soll Janelle es sich doch selber holen. Jahre später habe ich den Vorfall schon längst vergessen und wenn ich mich wie ein Arschloch Sam Verhalte, dann nur weil er so verdammt weich ist. Weich kann tödlich sein. Wenn wir überleben wollen müssen wir uns abhärten. Dass bedeutet, dass wir Infizierte sofort erschießen sollten. „Nothing personal.\" Wen interessiert denn schon der Wunsch eines sterbenden Mannes, wenn man schon selbst mit dem überleben zu kämpfen hat? Anscheinend Sam, denn der rennt gleich heulend zu Sugar-Daddy und – er muss irgendetwas getan haben. Sam muss ihn irgendwie verführt haben. Briggs ist nicht schwul! Ich hab ihn schon dutzenden Male dabei beobachtete wie er Frauen abgeschleppt hat. Gott, er war verheiratet. 2 Mal! Sam… Sam muss irgendetwas getan haben. POVSam Auf der anderen Seite steht Briggs. Die Arme leicht geöffnet, Füße hüftbreit positioniert und Anspannung steht in jedem seiner Gesichtszüge geschrieben, als ich mich zum Springen bereit mache. Anstatt dem warmen Gefühl das man bekommt, wenn man bemerkt, dass sich jemand um einen sorgt, macht sich Wut in mir breit. Um Graydon hatte er sich keine Sorgen gemacht. So klein bin ich nun auch wieder nicht, dass ich dies nicht locker schaffen würde auch mit den schweren Winterklamotten! Ich unterdrücke den trotzigen Impuls, etwas Kindisches zu sagen – in Briggs Nähe kommt das Kind in mir erschreckend häufig an die Oberfläche- und springe. Direkt in seine Arme. Ich hätte es auch ohne ihn geschafft, doch wäre ich, was ich mir eingestehen muss, dann wahrscheinlich auf meinem Hinterteil gelandet. Mit beiden Händen hält er mich am Bizeps, der unter tausenden Schichten von Stoff verdeckt ist, fest. „You okay, Sam?\", „Hm.\". Ich drehe meinen Kopf nach oben um ihm ins Gesicht sehen und ihm sagen zu können, dass er mich jetzt los lassen kann. Doch da treffen sich unsere Blicke. Meine Nase, wegen der Kälte kann ich ihre Spitze schon gar nicht mehr spüren, nur ein paar Zentimeter von seinem kratzigen Kinn entfernt und ich frage mich wann sein Bart so grau geworden ist. Diese Momente. Momente in denen sich unsere Blicke fangen und er nicht wegschaut, in denen sich unsere Körper unglaublich nahe kommen und er keine Anstalt macht, sich zu entfernen. Wir die gleiche Luft einatmen. Diese Momente sind über die letzten Jahre hinweg häufiger geworden. Sein Bart wurde grau und etwas hat sich zwischen uns verändert, was natürlich völliger Blödsinn ist! Wir wissen es Beide: Nicht er hat sich verändert, sondern ich. Ich bin nicht mehr der kleine Junge aus der Eiswüste, den er vor dem Tod gerettet hat, sondern ein Mann. 22 Jahre, attraktiv, heiratsfähig. Und ich will es nicht wahr haben. Subtil distanziere ich mich von ihm, mache einen Schritt zur Seite, damit er mich loslassen muss, will er mich nicht mit Gewalt weiter an sich pressen. Ich schlucke und schau an ihm vorbei um zu sehen was Graydon eigentlich gerade anstellt und ob er die ganze Szene mitbekommen hat. Doch Graydon schaut nicht einmal in unsere Richtung. Neben mir positioniert sich Briggs neu um ein meine Richtung schauen zu können. Ein Auto. „Guys…What ist that?\" POVBriggs Die Zündschnur ist ausgegangen. „I'm gonna go…\", ich bin dabei mich aufzurichten und mich durch die Schildplatten zu zwängen als mich Sams Hand auf meinen Arm zurückhält. „What the fuck are you doing?!\". Langsam drehe ich mich zu ihm um und packe seine Schultern, starre in seine ängstlichen, tiefblauen Augen: „Listen to me,… listen to me. We're fine. I light it, I come back, we go home.\" „It's too late!\", Panik mischt sich unter seine Stimme. Er versucht sie zu verbergen, schluckt und starrt mir in die Augen, versucht mir telepathisch etwas zu vermitteln. Seine Lippe ist aufgeplatzt. Ich sehe ihn an und will ihn küssen. Der letzte Wunsch eines zum Tode geweihten Mannes. Langsam lehne ich mich vor. Weiche Haut, rote Lippen, dunkle, fragende Augen. Und ich weiß, dass ich es nicht tun sollte. Blitzartig schleudere ich meinen Oberkörper nach vorne und gebe Sam eine Kopfnuss, die ihn in sich zusammensacken lässt, ich hoffe bloß, dass sie nicht zu stark war, als mich aufrappele und durch den Spalt aufs Dynamit zu renne. Er will es nicht. Die Zündschnur lässt sich wieder einmal nicht anzünden und sie kommen immer näher. Unter ihnen kann ich den Anführer ausmachen. Ein Riese, sein Blick heftet, im Gegensatz zum Rest der Truppe, nicht auf mir, sondern auf Sam. Sam. Wenn er sich an mich zurückerinnert, soll er keinen alten Mann sehen, der ihn kurz vor seinem Tod sexuell Nötigt. Sondern den Mann, der seinen Leuten ein starker Anführer war, der ihn vor vielen Jahren vor dem Eis gerettet hat und ihn nun, mit seinen letzten Atemzügen, vor einer Horde Kannibalen rettet.

On the night of November 11, 2012, I watched a movie called \"Teenage Bank Heist\" and thought it was one of those really deep movies that ended badly for the villains, because morally whatever they do is always wrong and we all know that they deserve to be behind bars for the crimes they commit. Just in brief, the teenagers robbed the bank because one of the girl's father was kidnapped and was threatened to be killed if she didn't do as the kidnapper told her to do, which was rob a bank. Of course she decided to get a couple of other people in on the scheme with her, because her mind wasn't enough to pull off the crime. In the event of scheming, there were two good bank robbers and one really evil bank robber who was super greedy and shady who had planned from the beginning to get rid of the good bank robbers and keep all the money for her and her older boyfriend. In the end the girl's father was rescued, the bank robbers were killed, and the detective who was in on the investigation of the entire heist chose to have a heart and pinned the entire heist on the kidnapper's as being the robbers of the bank. Thought the story seems to end well and work on the good teenagers favor, the bad teenager and her boyfriend were eventually killed in defense by the good teenager who was trying to rescue her father. So not only were there three dead bodies (kidnappers), there are also two dead teenagers (bad kidnapper & her boyfriend). It was obvious that the girl would go to the extremes to rescue her father, even if it meant robbing a bank and furthermore, killing people. She was a stone cold criminal and so this is where I decide to continue my story with maybe a not so happy ending for her…I'll try to be realistic…..to be continued….. What About the others?: As the girl and her father return to the police station they tell there tragic story of how the girl had to wait patiently for her father's return, while the detective worked on the case of playing off the kidnappers as also being the robbers, the father continued to play victim as his daughter joined in on the act. Meanwhile, while back at the scene of the crime where the two other teenagers were shot and killed dead, the cops had found the teenager who rescued her father, prints on the door knob in the house questioning her position as a victim. It is quite obvious that the two dead bodies were murdered and she had forgotten to set it up as a domestic violence situation, which probably would've been more effective rather leaving them there without a story behind it all. Needless to say other detectives on the case got involved and busted all of them out and the girl served a few years in a Juvenile Justice center, the detective well, lets just say she won't be detecting for a while.

The last 4 years have been miserable I thought dating Monique would make me forget you but it made me realize how much I loved you and how much I needed you says Corbin.

So thank you for coming and I know she would have loved all of this says Keke as she finishes the eulogy. She walked out of the church with Corbin and Rose.

Its about time that we tell the press about our daughter don't you think says Corbin. Your right says Keke. Let's go says Corbin as he picks up his daughter. They headed to one of the magazines. They told them about Rose and how they were back together. Then they headed back to work. They were one happy family. In the middle of the interview Corbin pulled out a box with a ring in it and proposed to Keke. She said yes and they were finally be together forever.[Chapter 4] Epilogue (10 years later) Mom Isabella won't give me my homework back yells 14 year old Rose. Rose do you have to yell says 32 year old Keke who was 6 months pregnant with Corbin and her third child. Sorry mom but that assignment is really important and Isabella wont give it back says Rose. Rose she's 6 how can she cause so much trouble says Keke. You don't believe me fine but when I fail and dad tells me I cant go and film my show and they pass it on its on your head says the fourteen year. You see she had just been signed her own show and would being starting it soon. On one condition she had to keep her grades up.Keke walked over to her six year old. Can I have your sister's homework asks Keke? Yes mommy says the six year old. Thank you says her mom. That wasn't so hard says her mom. Whatever says Rose as she walks away? Something's had changed in the last ten years. Rose had grown jealous of her sister after being an only child for so long. When she found out about her sister she was excited but then she was born and then she didn't have the same attention she got from her parents like she use to. She had to admit she couldn't wait until she was filming because it was going to just be her and her dad along with Uncle Zac and Vanessa and their son James. Hopefully her and dad could bond cause she felt like she didn't even know him anymore. Knock ,knock says a familiar voice. She looks up from her desk. Hi dad says Rose. What's wrong asks Corbin? Nothing I'm just trying to finish my homework says Rose. Your mom thought something was wrong she thinks you're stressed or something says Corbin. No just want to get this out of the way says Rose as she holds up her homework. Well take a break and come down to dinner says her dad. Ok says Rose. (Dinner) So Isabella how was school asks her mom? Good but mom why can't I stay home with you asks Isabella? Cause mommy needs a break even though she loves you she wants you to learn says Keke with a smile. Can I be excused asks Rose? Hon you have barely ate anything says her mom. Not hungry can I leave she asks again. Go ahead. ( 1 month later) Rose we need to be on set in 10 minutes yells her dad. She walked down the stairs and headed out the door. They were in New York filming a show called Just being me for Disney. Her dad was her dad and Vanessa and Zac were playing her aunt and uncle. She was loving time away from her mom and sister even if they had to go back in two months when mom had the baby. She needed the break from them but her dad still couldn't seem to figure out what was wrong with her or he just didn't care to. (Set) Uncle Zac can I talk to you asks Rose. Sure thing Rose what is it he asks? Did you ever feel like your brother took all your parents attention when he was younger asks Rose? No why asks Zac? Cause ever since Isabella was born I feel like my parents don't love me the way they did and now that there is the new baby they won't have time for me at all says Rose.

That's ridiculous says Corbin. Corbin she left the set crying today because you thought the phone call was more important says Vanessa as she comes up behind them. I don't know what to say says Corbin. Just go talk to her and tell her you still love her says Zac as him and Vanessa walk off. Corbin headed back to their house and found all the lights off. Rose says Corbin he headed into her room. Her bathroom light was on and he notice something dark reflecting off the light. Rose are you alright asks Corbin. She didn't answer so he kicked the door in and found his fourteen year old daughter on the floor bleeding. He pick up his phone and called 911. Hang on baby hang on says Corbin. (Hospital) Family of Rose Bleu asks the doctor. That's us says Corbin. Relation asks the doctor. Her father says Corbin. She slit her wrist but lucky enough not enough to kill herself but her stomach was pumped of a sleeping pill. Can I see her asks Corbin. Go right ahead room 203 says the doctor. We will wait for Keke says Vanessa. Okay says Corbin. (203 two days later) She was still not awake but early morning two days later she started to stir. Daddy says Rose as she opens her eyes. Rose thank goodness you are alright says her dad. Like you actually care says Rose. Of course I care baby when I saw you on the bathroom floor I got so scared and all these thoughts went through my mind like I was going to lose you and all the things I haven't said to you. It doesn't help I don't talk to you any more either says Rose. Hun we are going to get through this and I want you to know that I do love you and I am sorry I haven't given as much as attention as I should be says her dad. Did mom come ask Rose?

Mom you're a great mom I just let jealously get to me and I forgot to enjoy my family. But im okay and we are going to be okay says Rose. Her mom kissed her head and then grabbed her stomach. O no says her mom. What says Corbin? The baby is coming says Keke. They went and got a doctor and sent her mother to the deliver room. Rose and Isabella stayed in the room waiting for news. Sis I'm sorry for causing this says Isabella. Bella know of this is your fault I just wanted to blame but I really can't cause it's not your fault. I love you big sister says Isabella. I love you too says Rose. There was a knock on the door. Uncle Zac says Bella. Aunt Vanessa says Rose. How are you asks Vanessa as she walks over to her niece. I am going to be just fine says Rose with a smile. Zac lifted Isabella up onto the bed and she snuggled next to her sister. They all fell asleep along with James. 10 hours later Corbin brought in the latest addition to the family. Elizabeth Vanessa Bleu she was beautiful. Daddy says the two girls she so cute says Rose.

So this is my first Jump street fic. To be honest I wasn't planning on doing this because I usually write slash, but writing a slash fic for Jenko and Schmidt would be too easy. I mean, really, we all saw 22 Jump street and let's face it, the fanfics are basically writing themselves with every single scene in that movie. It's way, waay too easy. But I got hit with an idea the other day so I figured why not. Besides I don't really think this is slash, I mean it is sort of in a way but I don't really think it counts as slash. I'll be honest there is an implied romantic relationship for Zook/Schmidt and of course Jenko/Schmidt but listing it as an absolute slash doesn't seem all that accurate to me. It's mostly just Jenko getting jealous cause Schmidt and Zook are hanging out. Anyway blah blah aside. Apologies spelling grammar and OOCness Disclaimer: I don't own either of the Jump street movies or claim rights to any of their characters, nor do I make any profit from this fic. \"You're here to what?\" \"Pick up Schmidt, is he ready yet?\" Jenko stared at the blonde on the other side of the door with a what-in-the-fucking-fuck expression on his face while Zook just stared back at him with that obliviously goofy grin, or rather around Jenko since he was now stretching up on his toes from side to side, craning his neck to see into the apartment with one hand braced on the door frame. \"Can I come in?\" Jenko blinked at his friend before shaking his head free of the shock induced fog it was in and tried for a smile, \"Yeah man, come on in.\" Zook's smile grew a little more when Jenko stepped aside and he walked in, looking a lot more comfortable in the apartment he shared with his best friend than he had been a few months ago. See a few months ago, Schmidt couldn't stand Zook and Zook couldn't say he had a lot of love for Schmidt either. The whole college \"let's investigate other people\" thing was still a sore spot for Schmidt and although Zook didn't really mind the fact that his supposed best friend and his pretend brother were narcs, that didn't mean that he found Schmidt to be anymore interesting than he was before. Which is why Jenko was so confused. Exactly where was Zook taking Schmidt? \"I'm sorry I just...\" Jenko said as he closed the door and turned to find Zook rocking back and forth on the balls of his feet looking down the short passageway that lead to their bedrooms while his hands lay shoved deep into his pockets. \"What are you doing here again?\" Zook shrugged, \"Pick up Schmidt.\" Jenko frowned, \"Pick him up to do what?\" \"Not much, we're just gonna go catch a movie and then... I dunno hang out at Callie's I guess.\" \"Callie's?\" \"It's this diner downtown.\" The blonde said dismissively and Jenko opened his mouth to ask exactly when they started hanging out at a diner down town when Zook spoke before he could. \"Is he in his room?\" Jenko blinked in surprise but still answered, \"Yeah I think he just got out of the shower.\" \"Yeah? I'll go check on him.\" Zook grinned and Jenko frowned as he just watched the freshman turn around and disappear into the hall, trying to figure out exactly how Zook would know where Schmidt's room was since he's pretty sure Zook's never gone further than their living room before when he heard a door slam and Schmidt give a slightly terrified shout. \"What the fuck?!-\" A loud wolf whistle rang through the apartment before Zook spoke. \"Damn Schmidt, guess those extra hours at the gym are paying off huh?\" \"What the- how did you even get in here?!\" \"Jenko let me in.\" \"O.K well could you please get the fuck out of my room so I can get dressed?\" \"Why? It's not like I haven't seen you naked before.\" \"Stealing my swim shorts at the pool and watching me get dressed are two different things Zook, now get out right now or I swear to korean Jesus I'll shoot you!\" \"You already promised korean Jesus you wouldn't try to shoot me again... Hey do you think the holes are still in that guy's house or do you think he had them covered up? We should really get a picture.\" \"I don't know, maybe-... Damn it Zook, would you please just get the fuck out of here so I can get dressed?!\" \"Yeah, O.K I just... Are you seriously wearing that to the theatre?\" \"What's wrong with it, Maya picked it out for me when we were still going out.\" \"Exactly, three months and you're still pussy whipped without getting any actual pussy.\" \"It's a sweater, Zook. What am I supposed to do stop wearing clothes just cause my ex-girlfriend happened to get them for me?\" \"Ye s .\" \"... O.K you know what, fine. I won't wear the sweater, now will you please leave so I can put something else on.\" \"Alright I'm going.\" The door opened, \"I see you took my advice about the wax.\" \"GET THE FUCK OUT!\" \"O.K! O.K I'm going!\" By that time Jenko was seated on the couch as he listened to the whole thing and one thought bothered him more than anything else. When the fuck did they go to a pool? Zook walked passed the couch with a huge grin on his face and Jenko turned to watch him walk right passed and head straight for the kitchen. The fridge opened a soft clink rang through the air and Zook reappeared twisting the cap off the bottle of a beer as he went and sat down on the couch on the left side of the living room. Zook took a swig of the beer and Jenko just watched him in complete fascination until the blonde suddenly looked up and stared at him like he just noticed he was there. \"Shit, this is so rude of me,\" Zook said as he gestured to the bottle and Jenko almost gave a sigh of relief thinking that Zook finally realised how weird this all was until- \"You want a beer?\" Jenko blinked in surprise and stared at the blonde as he got up off the couch. Would he like a beer? In his apartment? \"Uh... Ye-yeah, a beer's good.\" Zook smiled as he set his bottle down on the table and walked over to the kitchen and came back with another one a few moments later. \"So how's it going, man?\" Zook asked as he handed Jenko the bottle and sat down before reaching for his own, \"It feels like I haven't seen you in months.\" \"Yeah, I've been...uh, busy.\" Jenko took the bottle that was handed to him and stared at the cold green glass. Turning it in his hand as if it could explain what the hell was going on. \"Schmidt says you've got a girlfriend now, what did he say her name was? Melinda, Meranda-\" \"Melissa.\" \"Right, right.\" Zook said with a nod as he took another sip from the bottle, \"Schmidt says she's hot.\" \"Yeah, she's-she's pretty hot.\" \"You're taking her out tonight right? Schmidt hasn't gone out in a while not after what's her name dumped him you know.\" \"Yeah I know.\" 'I was there' Jenko added silently, trying to hold back the urge to growl. \"It's probably better this way,\" Zook shrugged as he took a sip from his bottle, \"Stacey was a bitch anyway.\" \"Yeah Stac- wait a minute...\" Jenko stared up at the blonde in complete confusion, \"Who's Stacey?\" \"Stacy you know, blonde hair, great ass.\" When all Jenko did was give him a blank stare the blonde rolled his eyes, \"Remember, Schmidt's rebound girl. They went out after him and Maya-... You don't remember Stacey?\" \"No.\" Zook just shrugged, \"Whatever, like I said, she was a bitch anyway. Schmidt could do better.\" \"Uh huh.\" Jenko said as he watched the blonde on the couch while his expression continued to twist in confusion until he spoke. \"Zook, how... When did you and Schmidt start hanging out?\" The blonde looked up and gave him his own look of confusion, \"What do you mean, man? We started hanging out a couple months ago, remember, I needed help with psych and you said Schmidt could probably help me out.\" Jenko blinked as the memory came back to him, as he vaguely remembered saying that to Zook a few months back in a bar over a couple of beers. At the time, Jenko didn't think that Zook would actually go for it but he did want his partner and best friend to get along. I mean, he didn't think much of Schmidt when they met either. Not even in the first weeks at the academy, but now Schmidt is one of the coolest people he knows. He knew that Schmidt and Zook would get along if they at least tried, but he didn't think things would go off this well. \"So you asked him for help?\" \"Yeah, got an A on my finals.\" Zook said with a grin, \"I'm not taking psych this semester though, so now were just hanging out.\" \"Oh, well that's great man.\" Jenko said with a smile as he twisted the cap off his beer and took a swig, he really did want his friends to get along. So this is great news right? \"I'm glad you're getting along.\" \"Yeah, I- woah, woah woah!\" Jenko froze in his just as he was about to put his bottle on the coffee table and just watched in complete wonder as Zook snatched a coaster off the corner of the table and put it where Jenko was about to place his drink. \"Mahogany.\" Zook shrugged and Jenko just stared as he put his drink down. \"Ohkay.\" \"Schmidt almost lost it when I did the same thing a while back, he didn't stop bitching about it till I got him a new poster.\" \"Poster?\" \"Yeah, Lamborghini veneno. Of course he had to frame it, but it looks pretty bad ass that way.\" Wait a minute. \"You gave him the poster of the lambo in his room?\" Jenko asked as he fought back the urge to gape, but who could blame him. Zook just blinked back, \"Yeah why?\" \"I dunno, I just like the picture\" my ass! Why the hell didn't Schmidt tell him about this, I mean, yeah it's just a picture and yeah it's not that big of a deal but still, what the fuck?! \"No reason, you're right it does look pretty badass that way.\" Jenko said with a forced smile while Zook gave a nod when Schmidt suddenly walked into the room, right by the couch. \"I'm glad to see you're using the coasters this time.\" \"Yeah, yeah. It's just a table Schmidtty.\" The blonde said with a roll of his eyes as he finished off the last bit of his beer. \"A mahogany table Zook. It's hard as a bitch trying to get ring stains off mahogany, you know how I know that?\" Schmidt asked as he leaned over the couch and Zook shrugged as he gave the older man a grin. \"You were born with a vagina?\" \"Oh, yeah O.K other than the fact that I was born a woman.\" Schmidt asked with complete and total utter seriousness until Zook cracked and started laughing making Schmidt crack up as well as he turned around and walked into the kitchen. \"Fuck you.\" \"Oh c'mon Schmidt! Schmidtty~\" Zook got up off the couch and took his bottle with him to follow the older man as he called in a teasing voice. \"Morton~\" \"Shut up Zook.\" Jenko just stared after his two friends feeling like he was a guest in his own apartment when there was a knock at the door and he got up to answer it and blinked in surprise. \"Hi Greg.\" Oh shit Melinda, I mean Meranda I mean- \"Melissa, hey. Look at you, girl lookin' fine as hell.\" Jenko said with a smile like he didn't totally forget about his date with his maybe girlfriend cause he was watching the bromance unfold in his apartment. The brunette blushed as she smiled back at him and tossed her brown curls over her shoulder, \"Are you ready to go?\" \"O.K in my defence, I didn't know that the gun was loaded at the time. So technically, I promised korean Jesus I wouldn't accidentally shoot you.\" Schmidt's voice rang through the air and Melissa rolled her eyes and spoke through grit teeth, \"Or are you still busy?\" Melissa didn't like Schmidt for some reason, Jenko could never figure out why. They seemed fine when they met. She came over while he and Schmidt were in the middle of a movie and asked if she could stick around, it was a Die hard marathon and it was awesome! But for some reason, Melissa was less than pleased when she left later that night. Jenko, honestly didn't get why. \"Well I-\" was he ready to leave? Was he really ready to leave Schmidt and Zook alone inside of his and Schmidt's apartment? Somehow the that idea didn't sit well with Jenko for some reason. Somehow he didn't feel right leaving them alone, like something was happening right under his nose and leaving them alone was like handing a serial killer a gun. Bad idea. \"We're watching Kingsmen right?\" Melissa frowned, \"Who's that?\" Jenko sighed as the girl walked into the apartment and walked up into the living room. \"That's Zook.\" \"Zook?\" Schmidt and Zook came into the living room and Melissa just stared in surprise. \"I don't even know why you'd have to ask, it's not like there's-\" Schmidt stopped and blinked in surprise as he stared at the girl and Zook tossed an arm around Schmidt's shoulder's. \"Melissa hey.\" \"Hey.\" \"Uh... This is Zook, he's a friend from a case Jenko and I were working a while back.\" Schmidt explained and the girl just gave a nod as her eyes went from Schmidt to Zook. Zook leaned forward and held out his hand and Melissa gave a strange little smile as she put her hand in his. \"Nice to meet you.\" \"Likewise.\" Melissa pulled back and just seemed to continue to stare at them when Zook suddenly spoke, \"We should go, or we'll miss the seven o'clock show.\" \"Yeah. We should go.\" Schmidt said with a smile while Zook snatched his keys off the table and they headed towards the door. \"Bye.\" \"Yeah bye.\" Melissa waved still watching them with that weird look in her eyes when Jenko panicked. Not that he had any reason to panic, I mean Zook and Schmidt hanging out was great. His best friends are finally getting along why wouldn't that be great? For some reason it wasn't, somehow this felt like highschool and Eric all over again, only this time it was worse. \"Hey! Hey, you know what would be...awesome?\" Jenko suddenly said making both Schmidt and Zook stop just before they reached the door. \"If we all went out together. I mean I haven't seen Kingsmen yet either so-\" \"Uh well I mean, aren't you and Melissa going out on a date?\" Schmidt asked with a frown as he gave the girl a quick glance and Jenko stepped forward to throw his arm around Melissa's neck with a smile. \"Yeah, but it'll be fun. You know all of us going out together. Right babe?\" \"Huh?\" Melissa said distractedly as she just kept watching Schmidt and Zook when Jenko's words registered and she suddenly grinned, \"Oh yeah, lots of fun. Like a double date.\" \"Yeah only you know, not a date...you know for you guys but a date for us.\" Jenko explained with a slightly awkward cough and Schmidt's frown deepened a little more while Zook just grinned. \"Sure, it could be fun. Schmidt?\" Schmidt gave his best friend a long hard stare trying to figure out what in the fuck was going through his partner's mind when he just let out a sigh and shrugged. \"Yeah, sure let's go.\" Schmidt said as he reached for the door and pulled it open when Zook suddenly leaped up onto his back and they both went stumbling outside. \"OW! Fuck! Zook get the hell off of me!\" Zook started laughing and Jenko suppressed a growl when a soft pair of lips suddenly pressed against his cheek and he looked down to find Melissa smiling up at him. \"What was that for?\" \"Nothing.\" The girl said as she walked on after the two she could hear laughing and talking outside, \"Why didn't you tell me that Schmidt got a new, friend?\" Jenko frowned, \"Zook's not new, we've been friends for a couple of years now.\" \"Really, well what do you know.\" Melissa finished with an odd tone to her voice but Jenko just ignored it as they walked out and he locked up the apartment. Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx The weirdness never stopped. It just got weirder. The diner was practically empty but that didn't stop the loud sound of laughter and talking from filling up the entire room. Noise that came from one table specifically. \"...this asshole thought it would be an awesome idea to just sneak in through the back.\" Schmidt explained as he gestured to the blonde currently wolfing down a cheeseburger beside him and Zook gave a grunt of amusement as he nudged Schmidt with his elbow. \"We had to climb over the fence they had blocking the alley way and then-\" \"And then you shot the lock open with your gun.\" Zook added with a full mouth Schmidt rolled his eyes. \"Who's telling the story here, you or me?\" \"I'm just making sure you tell all of it and you don't just talk about how I'm a bad influence on you.\" Zook said with an annoyed growl after he swallowed. \"That's exactly why your mom looks at me funny whenever I come over.\" Jenko resisted the urge to gape, \"Wait, you've met Momma Schmidt?\" \"Yeah they met a while back.\" Schmidt said shortly before turning an incredulous look on the blonde, \"My mom does not look at you funny.\" \"Yes she does. She looks at me the same way that old lady did that time on the subway, remember, when you forced me to go to the library uptown-\" \"Forcing you, you make it sound like I didn't help you get an A on that last test.\" Zook rolled his eyes as he put his food down on his plate and wiped his hands of on a napkin before he grasped a hold on Schmidt's shoulder's, \"O.K I'm sorry, you Morton Schmidt are the sole reason that I made it through psych last semester and for that I will be forever grateful.\" \"Thank you. It's nice to get a little appreciation.\" The older man said with a nod and Zook let go of his shoulders before tucking back into his food. \"You're welcome... But that doesn't change the fact that you're the reason why old lady rat face kicked us out of the library.\" \"Oh c'mon-\" \"Hey!\" Jenko cut in, just barely able to keep the growl out of his voice while Melissa just sat smiling beside him in the booth. Seemingly fascinated with what was freaking the hell out of her date. \"You were talking about the club remember?\" Schmidt blinked before he gave a smile, \"Oh right, so we get in the club, we're in this dark hallway and it's super weird cause there are like tons of people making out like all around us. But we go in a little further and we make it out to the front and it looks normal enough so we go sit at the bar and we ask the bartender for some drinks but then-\" \"This tastes weird.\" Zook suddenly said cutting into Schmidts story and Jenko had to swallow back a sigh of frustration. \"What tastes weird?\" \"This-here taste this.\" Zook said as he raised his fork and actually fed the food on the end of it. Fed him! What the hell?! Schmidt cringed, \"Yeah, too much vinegar.\" Zook frowned, \"Yeah?\" \"Uhuh. You know what-\" \"They are so cute.\" Melissa mumbled as she grinned at the two not even giving a little attention to her own food and Jenko couldn't help but snap, \"Schmidt story.\" Schmidt shook his head before giving his partner a smile. \"Where was I?\" \"You got drinks at the bar.\" Melissa chirped. \"Shit, yeah. So we're getting drinks at the bar and this guy walks up to me and he asks me if I wanna dance and I'm like 'uhh, I'm not really sure that's a good idea' and he says 'c'mon, it'll be fun' and he winks and gives me this smile, so I'm just like what-the-fuck but then I look around and see that the people in this club are all guys and they're all dancing and talking and some of them are making out and I suddenly realise oh shit we're in a gay bar.\" Melissa laughed while Zook gave a snort and Schmidt just barely held back a chuckle, Jenko on the other hand had to force a smile as his best friend spoke. \"I get up and I'm like 'yeah o.k' cause I knew if I said I'm not gay he'd ask me what I was doing in a club like that if I wasn't gay and I had no idea what to say to that. So he grabs my hand and pulls me into the crowd which was so weird cause when we stopped he put his hands on my hips which was awkward enough, but like half way through the song he got so close I could literally feel his dick in his pants and I just, kinda froze cause from what I could tell that thing was huge. I mean it's so big I swear he probably has to keep it taped to his leg or something when he jogs-\" Schmidt cut himself off as Melissa suddenly broke out in a fit of giggles and he had to stop himself from laughing while Zook laughed as well. \"I would have asked him if he did have to tape it to his leg but then he literally grabs my ass and like came up to my ear and he whispered, 'You know I like having a little meat on my bones and I'd love to take if I take this out for a little ride' and at first I just kinda kept still cause he was a really good looking guy, I swear like a Calvin fucking Klein model so I'm like-\" \"Damn I'm good?\" The girl supplied with a grin and Schmidt almost chocked on his laughter along with the blonde beside him as he spoke, \"Damn I'm super good, but then I remembered that I'm not gay, which actually kinda sucks cause Calvin Klein is probably twice as hot as all the girls I've ever dated combined, so then I was like well shit .\" Melissa let out a shriek of laughter and Zook dropped his food on his plate as he started laughing while a dark blush spread over Schmidt's face while he chuckled as he tried to finish telling the story. \"I start freaking out on the inside, I don't know what to do when superman over here finally shows up from where ever he disappeared to-\" \"I got cornered at the bar I couldn't help it, besides I looked away for like one minute and when I looked back you were gone, Louis.\" Zook said defending himself while Schmidt just rolled his eyes, \"Anyway, I'm just standing there practically shitting myself cause I don't want to make a scene but Calvin Klein's hands are getting dangerously close to things they shouldn't be close to when Zook shows up and suddenly shouts 'Hey! Get your hands off my boyfriend!' \" Melissa burst out into another fit of giggles while Zook laughed again and Jenko sat there with a gape. \"He said what?\" \"Get your hands off my boyfriend.\" Melissa supplied before looking back at Schmidt, \"Then what?\" \"It was the most embarrassing moment of my entire life, I mean worse than the Peter Pan thing in highschool, cause he was so loud the dj actually stopped the music and everyone in the club turned around and stared at us. But luckily we got out of there like ten minutes later so the torture didn't last too long. Oh my God-\" Schmidt looked back at Zook and gave a half hearted glare. \"I'm still going to kill you for that by the way.\" \"Korean Jesus, Schmidt.\" Zook said as he cleaned off his plate and wiped his hands on a napkin while the older man gave a snort. \"I think I'd be doing korean Jesus a favour by getting rid you, one less asshole to deal with.\" Zook grinned as he wrapped an arm around Schmidt's shoulders and planted a kiss against the side of the older man's head as he teased, \"Oh c'mon baby, you know you love me.\" \"Knock it off. That's the last time I let you talk me into anything.\" Schmidt growled out as he pushed Zook off of him and picked up his coffee which was probably cold by now while the blonde just laughed. Melissa gave a blinding grin as she looked at the two and if Jenko was paying attention he would have heard the girl quietly squeal right there beside him, if he wasn't already preoccupied with other things. \"Shit I think I got beard burn.\" Schmidt said as he rubbed the side of his face before looking up at Zook, \"I thought you said you were going to get that thing shaved.\" Zook just shrugged as he lifted the glass of mountain dew up to his lips and took a sip. \"I'll do it later.\" \"More like never right?\" \"You said you thought the beard was cool.\" \"Yeah, that's before you started getting beard burn all over me. Do you have any idea how hard it is trying to explain to my mom how I got beard burn on my back?\" \"How does one get beard burn on their back?\" Melissa suddenly chirped with interest although she there was an oddly teasing knowing tone in her voice and Schmidt sighed, \"One gets it, by having a lousy friend that keeps attacking him for absolutely no reason. Seriously, get rid of the beard.\" \"Fine I'll get rid of the beard.\" Zook said with exasperation, \"God, you're worse than my ex-girlfriend.\" \"Hey I'm nothing like Bridgette!\" Schmidt said indignantly while Zook just shrugged, \"Not her, the other one.\" \"Oh,\" Schmidt paused, \"Well I liked Hannah, so I choose to take that as a compliment.\" The blonde laughed and suddenly Jenko snapped, because seriously, What the hell?! \"Schmidt!\" All three of the other occupants looked up at Jenko while the older man practically ignored the blonde and brunette, \"Show me were the bathroom is.\" He tried to sound as casual as normal and not like he was having a major freak out on the inside. Zook arched an eyebrow at his friend, \"It's right through-\" \"Uh, you know what I'll show him.\" Schmidt said as he got up out the booth along with Jenko, instantly knowing that the calm look on his partner really meant 'I need to talk to you right fucking now!' . \"I need to use the bathroom anyway.\" \"Need to tinkle?\" Zook teased and Melissa laughed while Schmidt just rolled his eyes, \"Exactly.\" The blonde laughed as he led the way towards the bathroom completely oblivious of the brooding glare on his back until he was inside and suddenly spun around to face said brooding glare. \"What the hell?!\" \"What?\" \"What the hell is going on between you and Zook?\" Schmidt frowned in confusion as he stared at his best friend, \"Me and Zook? What are you talking about?\" \"You two are all... Couple-ey and shit.\" Jenko said with exasperation as he frantically waved his arms around him, \"It's like your dating or something!\" Schmidt blinked in surprise before letting out a chuckle as he made to walk around his friend towards the door. \"Very funny.\" \"I'm serious Schmidt.\" Jenko said as he grabbed a hold of his partner's shoulders and Schmidt gave him an incredulous look. \"You can't be serious. Me and Zook? Are you crazy?\" \"He was practically hanging off of you at the theatre and then you have all these stories that honestly sound like date stories and he fed you, he fed you Schmidt!\" Jenko listed off as he paced a little in the small bathroom between the urinals and the stalls. \"And I know he gave you the picture of the lambo in your room, and why the fuck didn't I know about the girl you went out with after Maya-\" Jenko stopped when Schmit suddenly stepped forward narrowing his eyes at his best friend as his eyebrows furrowed together in a tight line before he spoke. \"Are you high right now?\" Jenko rolled his eyes, while Schmidt just kept going. \"Was it the stuff from the Friedman case, I bet it's the stuff from the Friedman case. You're obviously hallucinating-\" \"Schmidt I'm serious.\" \"You can't be.\" Schmidt said with a look of disbelief before he folded his arms across his chest, \"Look that thing that happened in the club was an accident and I was joking about that Calvin Klein dude, I haven't come out of the closet O.K, there's nothing in the closet to take out.\" \"That's not what this is about.\" \"Then what is this about, because you're not making any sense?\" \"It's about you getting a new best friend!\" Jenko suddenly snapped and Schmidt's eyes widened as his arms fell down to his eyes as Jenko sighed, \"I mean, why didn't I know about the gay club thing or the taco bell guy with the gun or your ex-girlfriend Stacey? We live in the same apartment, your my partner for fucks sakes but somehow you're spending more time with Zook than me.\" \"You're the one who wanted me to hang out with Zook, remember? I was perfectly happy hating him but you said 'I really want you two to hang out' . O.K we'll we're hanging out and now I like him.\" \"That's when I thought that we'd still be friends if he was.\" \"We are still friends.\" Schmidt gave a sigh, \"You've just been busy and I really didn't think it would be this big a deal if I just hung out with Zook a little more. He's fun you know, like a younger brattier version of you.\" \"I just, fuck I probably sound like such a pussy right now.\" Jenko sighed as he raked a hand through his hair. \"We're supposed to be brothers you know and I just feel like were drifting apart and watching you two it was like Eric all over again.\" Schmidt almost flinched back at that, he remembers the Eric thing. It really wasn't pretty \"Look I'm sorry.\" Schmidt said as he stepped closer to his bestfriend, \"I didn't realise that I was spending all my time with Zook, I guess, you were always so busy with other things I guess I thought you wouldn't notice. We're still brothers, we'll always be brothers, Zook's just fun to hang out with and I got distracted. But I really am sorry, man. O.K? Forgive me?\" Jenko looked down at his best friend who had his hand out towards him and he let out a sigh as he took it before pulling Schmidt close for a hug, the taller man gave him a brief squeeze before pulling back. \"I'm not mad at you Schmidt, I'm just... acting like a bitch for no reason.\" Schmidt smiled as he pulled away, \"Nah, it's cool, I mean, I guess I could've at least told you why we stopped going to Dukes back, up town.\" \"Yeah why'd you start hanging out here?\" Jenko asked and Schmidt let out an exasperated sigh, \"Eric got out a few months ago on good behaviour.\" \"What? Shut the fuck up!\" \"Yeah he works at Dukes now, he's doing O.K he said he's going back to school but things were a little awkward the last few times Zook and I went there so... Yeah.\" Schmidt finished off with a slight shrug and Jenko just gave a nod as they both turned towards the door. \"Well damn.\" \"Hey Greg, Zook and I don't really look like we're dating, do we?\" Schmidt asked as he looked up uncertainly at his best friend and Jenko grinned. \"No I was just-\" \"Being a bitch?\" Schmidt supplied and Jenko laughed, \"Yeah being a bitch.\" The shorter man gave a smile as they left the rest room, \"You know Zook and I are going to camping this weekend, I figured you'd be busy with Melissa so I didn't ask earlier but do you want to go?\" \"Camping? You know Zook told me his dad owns a ranch, technically he's half cowboy, this isn't a brokeback mountain thing is it?\" Jenko teased and Schmidt laughed as he punched his friend's arm. \"Shut up.\" \"Because if it is, I'm getting my own tent.\" \"Oh yeah, cause either of us would make a move on you.\" \"Hey, I could get any guy I wanted, O.K.\" \"Sure, if we ever run into Calvin Klein again I'll make sure to give him your number.\" Schmidt said with a grin as they walked out to the front of the restaurant, Zook grinned up at them when they sat down and Melissa just sat there with an oblivious smile and Jenko smiled back. O.K so maybe he freaked out there for a second but, I mean he's better now. He just felt like he was losing his best friend and Jenko really didn't want to go through that. It was kind of stupid though wasn't it? Schmidt and Zook don't seem like a couple, Jenko just said the first thing that came to mind in the heat of anger and that's what he came up with. God, it's like he didn't learn anything from those human sexuality classes he took. Like Schmidt and Zook would ever go out. They wouldn't do that, right? Suddenly Melissa let out a quiet squeal pulling Jenko from his thoughts to find Schmidt laughing with a light blush on his face while Zook had his arm hooked around the older man's neck and whispered something in his ear. \"So cute.\" The girl sighed and Jenko froze. Oh shit. The End A/N: yeah so that's what that was. Tell me what you think please review. ","Summary":" A/N: hey! So this is my first Jump street fic. To be honest I wasn't planning on doing this because"},{"Movie":"21 Jump Street","Title":"Ces Petites Choses","Author":"Gloomy-Coco","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11104322","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Pairing : Jenko / Eric Blabla : J'aime trop Greg Jenko (j'aime encore mieux Channing tatum mais là n'est pas le sujet). En faite, en regardant pour la X fois 22 jump street, je me suis rendu compte que le personnage de Brad MacQuaid était juste excellent ! En particulier avec la scène quand Jenko découvre que Maya est la fille de Dickson ou encore celle quand il tripe et danse avec un arc en ciel, du coup j'avais envie d'écrire quelque chose centrée sur lui. Et puis étant donnée que j'adore Eric / Jenko, j'ai sortie ce petit one shot ! Peut être que je penserais à faire une série de one shot en attendant de sortir la plus grosse fic… qui tarde à venir… sorry sorry sorry ! Faudrait que je m'essaye à Schmidt mais surtout à Eric ! Et aussi un grand merci à Tayuya3 pour son message d'encouragement, du coup ça m'a vraiment boosté à sortir ça ! Nota : je vous recommande de lire «Sans encombre plus ou moins » pour comprendre le pourquoi du comment d'Eric/Jenko. Disclaimer : Evidemment 21 jump street ne m'appartient pas, je n'ai aucun droit, ne fait aucun argent, seule Miranda est mon OC (mais mineur évidemment) Si Greg Jenko devait définir sa relation avec Eric Valens, il n'arriverait pas à mettre un mot dessus. Non pas qu'il ne savait pas, mais qu'il n'y arriverait pas. Beaucoup de mots pourraient décrire se qu'il ressent pour le jeune homme… qui au final était du même âge que lui, même plus vieux… mais passons. Ca allait du vrai amour à la véritable haine. C'était ça entre eux, des extrêmes passions qui étrangement arrivaient bien à cohabiter. . . . « Sérieusement ? » Jenko était tranquillement assis dans le canapé de son… leurs salon, une bière en main et s'était maintenant tourné vers Erik qui était derrière lui dans l'encadrement de la porte de la cuisine. Lui aussi avait une bière en main et avait les bras croisé ne quittant pas des yeux le policier face à lui, silencieux. « Je ne comprend pas en quoi le fait de me voir physiquement changera quelque chose » continua Jenko en haussant les sourcils et en levant ses mains dans un geste d'…interrogation. Eric l'observa en se mordant la lèvre inférieure et roula des yeux avant de quitter sa place et de retourner dans la cuisine. « Le fait que mes parents veulent te voir physiquement - comme tu dis, ne te fait ni chaud ni froid ? » Demanda le détective de loin. Non Greg Jenko n'y voyait pas l'intérêt. En quoi voir la famille de son petit ami allait changer quelque chose dans leur relation qui était déjà très bien à son gout, en mettant en sourdine la petite voix qui lui disait qu'il avait tout simplement peur de décevoir… . . . Leur relation qui avait commencé sur des mensonges (Jenko avait encore du mal à penser le contraire en repensant à leur mission à Saigon High), s'était finalement mué en quelque chose de plus sérieux et de durable. Pour dire vrai, c'était bien la première fois que Jenko était dans une relation aussi longue et avec un mec. Certes il avait déjà vécu des relations dites constructives, particulièrement au lycée où il était un expert des relations \"sérieuses\" avec plusieurs filles, cependant jamais il avait vécu quelque chose qui s'apparentait à celle qu'il vivait avec Eric. Loin de là, la perfection. Bien au contraire. Le nombre de fois où Eric l'avait insulté et jeté ses affaires depuis la fenêtre telle une Drama Queen, pour au final qu'il finisse chez les Schmidts. Ou encore, les fois où Jenko s'était battu avec des mecs qui lorgnaient un peu trop sur les fesses du détective pour à chaque fois que ça se retourne contre lui, et Jenko en voulait à Eric de se laisser faire. Ils criaient rarement quand ils se disputaient. Les tons étaient souvent calme mais les phrases, elles, faisaient mal. Et en y repensant, Jenko se disait que leur 'haine' était souvent de trop… Néanmoins, qu'est ce qu'elle était comparé à l'amour qu'ils se portaient pour l'un envers l'autre… ? Rien. Mais ça, il se l'avouait quasiment jamais. . . . « T'imaginera jamais ce qu'Eric m'a demandé ? » Jenko et Schmidt prenaient un sandwich dans un Food truck, alors qu'ils étaient en patrouille en plein centre ville de Metairie. On était en printemps, et les températures étaient plutôt avancées, mais surtout c'était une bonne occasion de manger dehors. Le plus petit des deux regarda son collègue à travers ses lunettes de soleil alors qu'ils s'installaient autour d'une table devant la camionnette. « Et qu'est ce qu'il t'a demandé pour que ça puisse te faire…rire ? » Demanda Schmidt. « Il veut que je rencontre ses parents ! Non mais tu entends ça… ses parents ! » Et Jenko éclata de nouveau de rire. Schmidt s'était arrêter de manger et avait la bouche ouverte. Jenko, son meilleur ami, son collègue de travaille, son frère … n'était pas aussi bête de que ça ? Si !? « Ca ne te fait pas rire ?» Demanda Greg. Schmidt secoua la tête négativement, essayant de chercher une explication logique de cet élan de rire. Mais il avait beau retourner la question dans la tête, non il ne trouvait pas. « Attend » Jenko retira ses lunettes et s'était penché sur Schmidt. « Pourquoi je devrais voir ses parents ? » Schmidt haussa les épaules et fit de manière sarcastique : « Peut être…je ne sais pas… Parce que ça fait bientôt 1 an voir 2 ans que vous êtes ensemble ? Je dis ça, je dis rien ». Jenko s'était reculé comme brulé, ce qui provoqua un roulement des yeux de Schmidt. « Dude ! Ne me dit pas que cette explication ne t'a jamais frôlé l'esprit ? Généralement, dans un couple qui a fait un petit moment ensemble, la chose logique qui suit est la rencontre avec les parents de l'autre, pour montrer justement le sérieux ! » Schmidt fut surpris du comportement de Jenko, qui resta silencieux. « Fuck. Shit… Oh merde ! » Schmidt roula de nouveau les yeux. « Je suppose que tu t'es mit à rire comme tu viens de le faire face à Eric. » Jenko ne répondit pas et se prit la tête dans les mains. L'autre policier eu un peu de peine. « Tu sais qu'Eric va alors penser que tu ne veux pas que votre relation devienne sérieuse. » Schmidt ne voulait pas continuer à faire du mal, mais c'était plus fort que lui. « Pourquoi ? Comme tu dis ça fait 1 an voir 2 ans qu'on est ensemble, je ne veux pas le quitter ! » Fit Jenko voulant se défendre. « Alors pourquoi tu ri… ? » Tout simplement parce qu'il avait peur. Mais de nouveau, il fit taire cette petite voix au fond de lui. . . . Les doutes. Autres critères qui pouvaient décrire cette relation. Pas seulement des doutes sur le réellement fondement de se mettre en couple, mais plutôt sur lui. Jenko le savait, il n'était pas une lumière mais il avait l'avantage de croire en ses convictions et de s'y donner à fond. C'était plutôt quelqu'un de passionné qui essayait et se donnaient toujours les moyens de réussir, du coup quand les premiers doutes sont arrivés sur « Est ce qu'il était vraiment fait pour quelqu'un comme Eric ? », ses forces et ses convictions l'abandonnèrent. Pour lui, Eric était un peu comme Schmidt. Il était intelligent, drôle, à l'écoute, fonceur mais surtout incroyablement sexy ! Et Jenko, étrangement, ne pensait pas qu'il était la personne qui lui fallait. Le policier pensait que quelqu'un de plus… stable, intelligent aussi, serait à mieux pour Eric, pas un idiot comme lui. Et ces doutes se sont profondément encré en lui pendant un moment et l'ont même poussé à rompre avec Eric… pour le mieux, selon lui. Le mal être qui avait suivit cette rupture lui avait causé une boule au ventre de fait il mangeait très peu. Il pensait sincèrement à l'époque que c'était juste un ver digestif qui ne voulait pas quitter son intestin et quand on lui demandait pourquoi il était souvent triste et n'avait pas le moral, il répondait que c'était juste passager. Mais ce fut le manque qui fut plus difficile à combler. Il ne pensait vraiment pas que le fait qu'Eric ne soit plus dans sa vie allait autant le marquer. Il avait pourtant essayé de passer à autre chose, d'aller voir d'autre filles ou d'autre hommes. S'amuser ou autre, mais non, rien n'y faisait. Mais le pire dans tout ça, c'est que ça lui arrivait de croiser Eric dans les couloirs du poste, même si ils n'étaient pas aux mêmes étages, la coïncidence pouvait être une vraie de vraie salope. Dans ces moments là, quand ils se retrouvaient à quatre : Miranda, Eric, Schmidt et lui; Eric fixait Jenko pendant un temps le regard morne pour ensuite parler à Schmidt tout sourire puis Miranda le dévisageait mais le saluait quand même. C'est d'ailleurs d'elle que les choses finissèrent par s'arranger. Jenko le savait, sans elle Eric ne se serait jamais revenu vers lui, n'aurait jamais lutté pour lui prouver qu'il le méritait mais surtout qu'a eux deux, ils formaient les deux face d'une même pièce : indissociable. Miranda était même venu le voir seule. Ils avaient plusieurs fois discuté et bu un verre ensemble. La femme avait des efforts phénoménaux, malgré la première impression négative qu'elle avait de lui. Miranda et tout comme Schmidt. . . . « Je suis désolé. » Eric leva la tête doucement de son ordinateur posé sur son bureau pour voir son petit ami devant lui, habillé en tenu de policier. Il fronça les sourcils. Qu'est ce qu'il faisait ici ? « Désolé de… quoi ? » « Pour hier soir, je… je voulais pas me moquer pour la visite chez tes parents. Je ne veux pas que cela gâche quoi que se soit entre nous. » Eric s'était arrêté de taper sur son clavier et observait Jenko qui se sentait mal à l'aise. Après son déjeuner avec Schmidt il avait espéré que son comportement n'allait pas avoir de conséquence sérieuse avec Eric. Il voulait pas ressentir ce qu'il avait vécu il y a de cela quelque mois. Et Schmidt avait raison, il était temps de prouver qu'il tenait à Eric plus que les mots pouvaient dire. « Dit moi juste ce que je dois porter et amener. » Continua Jenko. Le détective avait un visage neutre, avant que celui-ci se mue en une grimace et qu'un fou rire le prenne. « Non mais tu as vu ta tête ! Greg… tu as vraiment cru que j'allais te faire rencontrer mes parents ?! » Jenko ne sut pas pourquoi pas, un frisson et une déception le gagna. Dire qu'il y a encore 24h, cela le réfutait de faire le grand pas, mais au final cela le déçu. Il fit une grimace pour cacher sa gène pour ensuite se déplacer vers Eric et le frapper au niveau de l'épaule. Une fois, puis une deuxième fois. Le plus petit fit un saut mais avait un sourire aux lèvres. « Désolé, mais je voulais juste savoir ta réaction si je te proposais cela. » Fit le détective qui se massa l'épaule. « Tu t'es cru dans un show tv à me faire ce genre de chose… » Eric ne le quitta pas des yeux et l'observa. Alors que Jenko s'installa sur la chaise en face de lui, Eric continua : « Tu aurais vraiment voulu rencontrer ma famille ? » Le ton était incertain mais on sentait l'espoir dans sa voix. Jenko le regarda a son tour avant de pencher sa tête sur le coté et de gratter l'arrière de son crane. « Et bien, c'est pas comme ci on était ensemble depuis 1 an voir 2. » Il leva les yeux sur son partenaire et se pencha sur le bureau comme ci il allait divulguer le secret derrière le monstre du Loch Ness « Il serait peut être tant d'officialiser les choses au près de nos parents non ? » Le regard que lui lança à ce moment Eric fit de nouveau frissonner Jenko. Il était doux et énamouré, et le policier jura en son fort intérieur de ne pas pouvoir l'embrasser – oui il était encore au poste entouré de plein de monde. D'ailleurs il fut surpris que personne ne prête attention à eux, quoi que… c'est pas comme ci il venait quasiment tout le temps à cette étage. « Tu sais que je ne pourrais pas te dire je t'aime, mais tu le sais. » fit Eric en susurrant. « Je le sais que trop bien. »Répondit Jenko sur le même ton flirtant. Ils ne se quittèrent pas des yeux avant qu'un raclement de gorge les fasse lever la tête en même temps. La coéquipière du détective les regarda en croissant les bras, le regard torve. « Encore entrain de vouloir forniquer avec vos regard ! » «Forniquer ? » Demanda Jenko en fronçant les sourcils. Eric roula des yeux et se recula sur sa chaise. « Dit donc Miranda personne t'as dit qu'il y avait pas plus tue l'amour que toi ! » Jenko s'était relevé de sa chaise et toisa la femme afro-américaine de son 1m85. « Moi aussi je t'aime Jenko » fit elle de manière ironique en soupirant « Maintenant back off ! » Et elle lui indiqua la sortie. Jenko lui fit un doigt sous le rire d'Eric qui s'amusait toujours à voir ses deux là se prendre le choux. Le policier se dirigea vers l'ascenseur au préalable ayant fait un clin d'œil à son homme et fit un bisou volé à Miranda qui discrètement lui faisait un sourire. . . . Brad Jenko n'était pas homme à s'embêter pour beaucoup de chose. Il n'arriverait pas à mettre des mots sur sa relation avec Eric Valens, même si il en avait, il ne sait pas si cela pouvait vraiment retranscrire ce qui se passait et ce qu'il vivait. C'était un mélange de tout, de petites choses au quotidien. Ces moments où ils allaient voir un match de basketball et Eric commentait chacune des actions le regard pétillant, ou alors cette fois où il s'était rendu à un concert et Erik avait passé ses bras autour de sa taille pour poser sa tête dans son dos. Jenko lui avait dit qu'il ne verrait rien comme ça du concert mais Eric n'en avait que faire, il était bien. Ou puis cette autre fois, où ils s'étaient retrouvé dans un bar et dans un élan d'excitation, ils n'avaient pas cessé de s'embrasser langoureusement pour finir au toilette et être à deux doigts de se faire surprendre par Schmidt... Rectification: ils s'était fait surprendre par Schmidt qui avait crié à « Saint Marie Joseph » et demandé de l'eau bénite dans ses yeux pour oublier ce qu'il venait de voir. Sur le moment ce n'était pas agréable, mais Jenko se rappelait du rire d'Eric alors qu'il remontait son pantalon et bouclé sa ceinture. Et rien que ça, ça lui faisait rappeler un bon moment. C'était ça qui faisait qu'au jour d'aujourd'hui, il était juste bien, heureux mais surtout in love . . . . Fin J'ai pondu ça en une aprèm, comme quoi en me remettant doucement à l'écriture,la motivation revient ! Finalement je suis resté avec Eric et non Erik. En tout cas, j'espère que cela vous a plus ! ","Summary":" Pairing : Jenko / Eric Blabla : J'aime trop Greg Jenko (j'aime encore mieux Channing tatum mais là "},{"Movie":"21 Jump Street","Title":"This little Things","Author":"Gloomy-Coco","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12423346","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Blabla : HIIIIIIIIII ! Guess who's back ! New fic... well translate fic from mine lol I have so much love for Greg Jenko (I love Channing Tatum much more though). In fact, after watching 22 jump street for the zillionth time, I've gone to realize that Greg Jenko's character was just so rich ! Especially with the scene when Jenko discovers that Maya is Dickson's daughter or when he « trips » and dances with a rainbow. I just wanted to write something Jenko-centric. And since I love Erik/Jenko ,I wrote this little one shot! Note: I recommend reading \"Without problem : more or less \" to understand why and how Eri(c)k/ Jenko. This little things If Greg Jenko had to describe his relationship with Eric Valens, he wouldn't be able do to in one word. He wouldn't want to anyways. Many words could describe what he felt for the young man ... whom in the end was the same age as he was, even a little bit older ... but no one was counting. It ranged from true love to burning hatred. It was like that between them, extreme passions that strangely happened to blend together well. . . . \"Seriously ? » Jenko was quietly sitting on the couch of his ... their living room, beer in hand and had now turned to Erik in the kitchen's doorway. He also had a beer in hand and his arms crossed, eyes not leaving the policeman in front of him, silent. \"I don't understand how seeing me in the flesh will change anything\" continued Jenko with raised eyebrows and raising his hands in a gesture of ... query. Eric watched, biting his lower lip and rolling his eyes before heading back to the kitchen. \"The fact that my parents want to see you in the flesh - as you say, makes you feel nothing at all ? \"Asked the detective in distance. No Greg Jenko wasn't seeing the point. He didn't see how seeing his boyfriend's family was going to change anything in their relationship. It is perfect as it is. Not listening to the little voice in his head saying he was afraid he would disappoint them. . . . Their relationship started that on a bed of lies (Jenko was still struggling to think otherwise by rethinking their mission in Saigon High), was eventually turned into something much more serious and lasting. Truth be told, it was the first time that Jenko was in a long relationship and with a guy. Certainly he had had some relationships, especially in high school where he was the expert of ' serious ' relationships with several girls. But nothing compared to what he has with Eric. Far from it. Way further actually. The number of times that Eric had insulted him and threw his things from the window such a drama queen, to the end he finished in Schmidts. Or the times Jenko fought with guys leered too much on the butt of the detective whenever it is turned against him, and Jenko wanted Erik to let it go. They rarely shouted when they quarreled, no, the tone was often quiet but the sentences, they, were cruel. And thinking back, Jenko would say that the 'hatred' was often present too ... However, what it was compared to the love they bore for each other ...? Nothing. But that any of them never said confessed anything about that. . . . \"You would never guess what Eric asked the other day? » Jenko and Schmidt were having a sandwich in a Food truck while they were on patrol in the center of Maitirie. It was spring, and the temperature was rather hot, but mostly it was a good opportunity to eat outside. The smaller of the two looked at his colleague through his sunglasses as they settled around a table installed in front of the van. \"And what did he ask that is making you laugh ...? \"Asked Schmidt. \"He wants me to meet his parents! Can you believe it ? His parents ! \"And Jenko burst out laughing again. Schmidt had to stop eating, mouth hanging opened; Jenko, his best friend, his colleague from work, his brother ... was that stupid, was he ? \"Isn't it hilarious ?\" Greg asked. Schmidt shook his head, trying to find a logical explanation for this burst of laughter. But he turned the question in his head over and over again and didn't found one answer. \"Wait,\" Jenko took off his glasses and leaned on Schmidt. \"Why should I see his parents ? » Schmidt shrugged and made sarcastically: \"Maybe ... I don't know ... Because it's been almost 2 years that you've been seing each other? Just saying . \" Jenko had steped back as burnt, which Schmidt to roll his eyes. \"Dude ! Don't tell me that seeing them never crossed your mind ? Generally, in a couple that has been a while together, the logic thing to follow is the meeting with the parents, precisely to showing the relation is serious ! » Schmidt was surprised by Jenko's behavior, who remained silent. \"Fuck. Shit ... Oh shit ! » Schmidt rolled his eyes again. \"Don't tell me you laughed at Eric's face as you did earlier ? » Jenko didn't answer and took his head in his hands. Schmidt did pity him. \"You know that Eric will think that you don't want a serious relationship. \" Schmidt said as a matte of fact. « Why ? As you say it's 1 year soon 2, we're together, I don't want to leave him » told Jenko wanting to defend himselves. \"Then why are you laughing ...? » Because I am scared . But then again, he silenced that little voice inside of him. . . . Doubt. An other word that could describe this relationship. Not doubts about them, more like lack of confidence in himself. Jenko knew, he wasn't the brightest of them all, but he had the advantage of believing in his convictions and give everything thoroughly. He was passionate, always trying to make everything right no matter what. But all this strengths where nowhere to be seen when questioning if he was fit to be Eric's happily ever after. For him, Eric was like Schmidt. He was smart, funny, a good listener, open-minded, go-getter. Only Eric was also incredibly sexy ! And Jenko, strangely, didn't think he was the one fit to be with him. Someone more ... steady and intelligent would be better for Eric, not an idiot like him. Doubts that were deeply embedded in him had pushed to break up with Eric ... for the better, he said. The time after the break up caused him a knot in the stomach and he ate very little. He sincerely thought at the time it was just a digestive worm that wouldn't leave his gut and when people asked why he was often sad and had no morale, he replied that it was just momentary. The hole left by Eric though, was impossible to fill. He didn't really think that the fact that Eric was no longer in his life would be that hard. Yet he had tried to move on, to see other girls and guys. Just for fun but that didn't work out. The worst part of it, was seeing each other in the office hallways. Fate had its ways to hurt you sometimes. The awkward moments between Miranda, Schmidt and both of them, where Eric stared at Jenko with dull eyes before talking to Schmidt and leaving … At least Miranda had been king to him. It's because of her, that things got better. Jenko knew, that without her, Eric would never have gotten back with him. They had struggled but eventually they were back together. Inseparable. Two faces of the same coin. Miranda even came to see him alone. They talked several times and had a drink together. The woman had made phenomenal efforts, despite the negative first impression she had of him. Schmidt had too. . . . « I'm sorry. » Eric looked up slowly from his computer on his desk to see his boyfriend in front of him, dressed in his police attire. He frowned. What was he doing here ? \"Sorry for what? » \"For last night, I ... I didn't want to laugh about visiting your parents. I don't want it to spoil anything between us. » Eric had stopped typing on his keyboard and was watching Jenko who was fidgeting. After his lunch with Schmidt he had hoped that his behavior was not going to have serious consequences with Eric. He didn't want to go through drama again. And Schmidt was right, it was time to prove to Eric that he was committing to this relationship. \"Just tell me what to wear and bring. \"Following Jenko. Eric had a neutral face, before it turned into a grin and a giggle escaped him. \"Oh man you should see your face! Greg ... did you really think I wanted you to meet my parents ? » Jenko didn't know why disappointment went through him. To say that it took 24 hours for him to master up enough courage to say this and it was all a joke. He made a face to hide his embarrassment then moved to Eric and hit him in the shoulder. Once, then a second time. The smallest made a little rise but had a smile. \"Sorry, but I just wanted to know your reaction if I offered you to. \"Told the detective who rubbed his shoulders. \"You are just so good at pulling pranks aren't you ...\" Eric didn't quit his gaze and watched. While Jenko sat on the chair in front of him, Eric continued: \"You really wanted to meet my family ? \"The tone was uncertain but we could feel the hope in his voice. Jenko looked at him before turning his head to the side and scratching the back of his skull. \"Well, it's not like it we are together for almost 2 years now.\" He looked up at his partner and leaned on the desk like this he would disclose the secret behind the Loch Ness monster \"It might be the time to formalize things to our parents, no ? » The look that Eric gave him this time, gave a shiver to Jenko. It was soft and enamored, and the officer swore in his soul that he would not kiss him - yes he was still in the police office surrounded by lots of people. Besides, he was surprised that no one was paying attention to them, whatever ... it's not like he almost had it all the time at this floor. \"You know I can't tell you I love you, but you know it. \"Said Erik whispering. \"of course ! » They never left each others' gazes before a throat clearing shook them off. The detective's team mate was watching them, arms crossed, a grim look on her face. \"Still in the process of wanting to fornicate with your eyes! » \"Fornicate ? \"told Jenko frowning. Eric rolled his eyes and leaned back in his chair. \"Hey Miranda , did no one ever tell you you are the worse cockblocker there is ! \"Jenko had risen from the chair and eyed the African American woman. \"I love you too Jenko\" said she sighed ironically, \"Now back off! » And she showed him the exit. Jenko gave her the finger under Erik' laughter. It always amused him to see these two bicker. The officer walked to the elevator, to having previously made a nod to his man and stealing a kiss. . . . Greg Jenko wasn't the man to be bothered by many things. He wouldn't put words on his relationship with Erik Valens even if he could, words wouldn't do them any justice. It was a mixture of everything from little things everyday. Those times when they were going to see a basketball game and Eric commented each share with a sparkling look, or the time he went to a concert and Eric had spent his arms around his waist to put his head in his back . Jenko told him that he wouldn't see anything like that from the concert but Eric had didn't care, he was good. Or the time, where they were in a bar, the moment got heated and they ended up in the toilets the toilet and Schmidt almost caught them … Well, they had been caught by Schmidt who had shouted \"Holly Molly\" and that he needed holy water in his eyes to forget what he had just seen. At the time they were embarrassed, but Jenko remembered Eric's laughter when he was buckling his belt. To say the least, he was content, happily in love. I'm so in love with this couple ! kill me.

There are probably, maybe some perks to being in love with your best friend, but Schmidt has yet to figure out what those perks are. It mostly just sucks, though, being in love with Jenko, because being in love with Jenko is, in all honesty, one of the worst things you can be. ii. Schmidt does not like men. He really, really doesn't. He likes women — ass and tits and legs that go for miles, but he also likes Jenko. That isn't so weird, right? Frankly, Schmidt thinks it would be strange for somebody not to be attracted to Jenko. (What? It's not like he can help but noticing his best friend's godly physique and really. They live together, for christ's sake. He's not gay. Not gay. Not.) iii. \"Hey, Jenko,\" he whispers across the room one night. Somewhere above the hum of the AC, he can hear the Yangs across the hall playing some fucking video game and making a racket. He really is getting too old for this shit. Jenko groans and stirs. \"Yeah, man?\" \"Do you think like, hypothetically, if we were to have sex right now, the Yangs would hear us? Hypothetically.\" He winces, wondering if he should just kill himself now if his entire life he's going to have this habit of blurting out the first thing he thinks of. \"Are you implying that you want to fuck?\" Even in the dark, Schmidt can tell he's got a shit-eating grin on his face. He kind of hates him. \"No! No, you asshole. I said hypothetically. It could easily be replaced with 'do you think the Yangs would hear if we were to start wrestling, or if a fucking octopus was inking in my mouth again.' For the love of Vietnamese Jesus, stop fucking overthinking things.\" He thinks he hears Jenko say something else, but he just rolls over, mortified, pulls his blanket over his head and goes to sleep. iv. Jenko won't take his nose out of his stupid fucking Human Sexuality textbook and if they weren't undercover Schmidt would shoot the goddamned thing right out of his hands. It's infuriating, really, sharing a room with someone who spent all four years of high school throwing gay slurs at him to suddenly calling people out for using the word faggot. He's gonna punch him in the face. Or dick. One or the other. Maybe both. v. Dickson is mad. Like, really, really fucking mad, and even though he's gotten shot at more times during this job than he can count Schmidt has never been more afraid for his life. It's not his fault, really. It's incredible that Dickson didn't mention that his (incredibly hot) daughter went to MC State. And to reiterate, Maya is hot as fuck and really smart and nice and she's female and very much Not Jenko — who is, Schmidt thinks bitterly, probably too busy sucking Zook's dick to congratulate him on getting laid — so it's all good. Or he thought it was. Until, of course, Maya turned out to be the captain's fucking daughter . He wonders if anyone would blame him for praying his heart out to Vietnamese Jesus. vi. Schmidt is not, by any means, an angsty person. Maybe in high school he was, with that godawful Slim Shady-era Eminem hair and the nasty habit of choking on his words — no he does not still have that fucking habit, thank you very much. But now he's been through high school twice and he's in college now and quite frankly he thinks most college students have better things to do than just lie around and angst all day. But he's gonna, because he's thirty and pretending to be a college student and it feels like it's a little too late to be having a sexuality crisis. But this is Jenko — his best friend, his pretend brother, his partner (which does, in all honesty, sound a little bit gay.) Practically his real brother. It's time to consult Jenko's Human Sexuality textbook. vii. Waking up to Jenko groping him through the comforter is a pleasant surprise, to say the least. And then less pleasant, because seriously, what the fuck? \"Dude, you're fucking drunk. Get the fuck off me.\" He promptly shoves an inebriated Jenko off the bed without even feeing bad about it. Okay, so he feels a little bad. Fuck you, conscience. viii. Its not the whole being physically attracted to Jenko thing that freaks him out because really, everybody is physically attracted to Jenko whether they'll admit it or not. Fuck, even Dickson is probably even attracted to Jenko. No, the thing that freaks him out is the whole becoming emotionally attached. He's just not sure if he should be this prepared to make this kind of commitment to a guy who made high school the most miserable experience of his life, and frankly, he's not sure Jenko is, either. Also, he's not gay. There's that, too. xi. It starts with him being possessive and snarky and ends with him attempting to drop kick somebody for playfully mocking Jenko's intelligence — the only one allowed to do that is Schmidt. Besides, Jenko isn't even that stupid. He isn't book smart, not by a long shot, but he's street smart, and besides, since when was somebody's worth measured in intelligence, anyway? By that logic, Schmidt should have had at least ten girlfriends by now. He's not overprotective, except maybe he is. Just a little. Jenko just laughs affectionately as Schmidt sits on the ground after his failed drop kick, clutching his elbow. x. Three nights after he has sex with Maya, he googles 'what do you do when all you want to do is fuck your best friend gay' but that search mostly just turns up a lot of porn. He sighs, defeated. Even the gods of Google know he shouldn't be feeling like this. xi. Sometimes, he looks over at Jenko and winces because he's going to have that fucking scar (well...scars, now) from where he took a bullet for Schmidt for the rest of his life and that's a debt Schmidt will never be able to repay, because he fucking sucks at taking bullets for other people. Jenko will always have his back, always be there to protect him, and Schmidt just wishes he could return the favor. xii. They get a dog together. As friends. Her name is Lizzie (Jenko wanted to name her Lambo, but Schmidt shut down that idea pretty fast.) They keep her for alternating weeks. They're both hopelessly in love with her. finally, Jenko says, \"we should just move in together.\" And, well. It's not like that would be anything new anyway. They lived together all throughout the HFS and WHYPHY cases, and all through police academy, and even nowadays they tend to crash at each other's houses anyway. So, in his moment of weakness, Schmidt says, \"Dude, gay. Let's do it.\" So, uh. That's that, then. xiii. Moving in together proves to be easier said than done. The thing is, Schmidt and Jenko aren't like the Yangs; they're the two most different people in the universe. Jenko likes to watch stand-up comedy, but Schmidt would rather watch Friends all day. Jenko likes mint ice cream (who in their fucking right mind likes mint ice cream?) while Schmidt prefers a Cherry Garcia because he's not a fucking idiot. Jenko makes too much noise making fucking protein smoothies for breakfast; why can't he just eat cereal like a goddamned normal person? They get a bunk bed, because why the fuck not? Jenko calls the top bunk as soon as the idea is even mentioned, so. And if they end up sharing one of the beds instead because Jenko is \"too tired\" to climb into his bunk (bullshit — the guy is like fucking Spider-Man and could get up there in a second if he really wanted to), then so be it. xiv. Schmidt never considered the fact that Jenko would be a cuddler, but looking back on it he isn't sure why. The guy is like a giant teddy bear, for fuck's sake. So since they live together now and all, they frequently engage in Platonic BFF Cuddling, because even though Schmidt isn't too keen on cuddling anyway, he'll take what he can get. xv. Schmidt googles 'help me I want to make out with my best friend' but the search returns hundreds and hundreds of people in the same boat with no real answers or help. xvi. Next time, he searches 'help me i made out with my best friend.' xvii. Nothing changes. Not really. Sure, there's lots more fucking involved in whatever the fuck this relationship has turned into but there's the same amount of joking and bantering and goofing off and straight up fighting as always. It's comforting, but only a little. xviii. \"I tried to take a bullet for you, man.\" \"Yeah, but you didn't.\" It just means he'll try even harder next time. He will take a bullet for Jenko. xix. Dr. Murphy, who is really fucking strange but also pretty smart, tells them about embedding. Somehow, Schmidt isn't surprised when Jenko assumes he meant they'd embedded on each other instead of anything having to do with the Cynthia Watson case. Schmidt thinks it's complete bullshit, though. Somehow, though, Jenko has managed to worm his way into every aspect of Schmidt's life to the point where he feels physically and emotionally lost without his best friend by his side. xx. \"Cate Blanchett\", \"best nightmare\", \"wifi/WHYPHY.\" Jenko is the most hopelessly confused person Schmidt has ever met, and it's annoying as fuck but also kind of adorable. Maybe it's why they're so good together. They're like Batman and Robin. (And fuck Zook, because every Batman needs his own Robin. There can't be two fucking Batmans. That doesn't even make any fucking sense. Fuck. Idiot.) xxi. SCHMIDT'S LIST OF PERKS OF BEING IN LOVE WITH YOUR BEST FRIEND: - awesome sex - shit gets weird but then after a while gets mostly not weird again - you already know everything about them which means you can embarass or blackmail them on a whim (regrettably, they can do the same to you — STEAL BACK AND DESTROY DEFACED WONDER YEARS CHILDHOOD PHOTO) - awesome sex He's still figuring things out, but for now, it's enough. the fact that there isn't more fic for these two is honestly tragic. i made sure i had 21 roman numerals in this because i'm a cheesy piece of shit.

Just so you know, this story is published as 'complete' because each piece/chapter can stand alone, and because I don't know if or when I'll ever add to it. All the same, if anything new occurs to me, I'll toss it up, so you're welcome to put the story on alert. Enjoy, my friends Izzy stood with his back to a row of lockers, an arm slung around Mary's shoulders. Around them stood Shauna, Keisha and Tammy, chatting and laughing just like on any other day. They were waiting for Chuck and Earl to show up; no doubt the two of them had gotten into some sort of goofy mischief. \"Hey Double Dutch boy,\" someone cackled as they walked past. Most people had let it go by now. News of what had happened at his rematch with Rodney had travelled fast, and surprisingly, every time Rodney caught someone still laughing about it, he told them off. All the same, a few sorry souls still hung onto it. \"Loser,\" the guy sniggered. \"Dude,\" Izzy called after him, spreading his arms wide and putting on a skeptical look as the kid stopped and turned to face him. \"Seriously? I won't even start on how badly you'd do in the ropes.\" He pointed at Mary, then at the girls around him. \"I've got a crazy hot girl and a solid group of friends. I'm a city champ and third in state at a sport I love. I'm not losing anything. Where are you?\" An uncomfortable expression on his face not even hidden by his attempted scowl, the kid coughed, turned and walked quickly away. \"That's what I thought,\" Izzy shouted, smiling.[Chapter 2] Izzy stood on the fire escape outside his window, hands cupped around his mouth. \"Hey gorgeous,\" he shouted. \"You up there?\" Mary opened her balcony door and stepped outside, smiling. \"What do you want, loverboy?\" \"You,\" he answered simply, grinning and dropping his hands. \"Dad took Karin to swimming lessons. The house is too quiet.\" Mary rolled her eyes and laughed, stepping over to the ladder and climbing down to see him. \"Here I am,\" she said. \"Good.\" Izzy clambered back through his window and then turned around, reaching outside to grab her wrist. \"Now come in here. I want to kiss you.\"[Chapter 3] It was only mid-afternoon, but Izzy was pleasantly sleepy stretched out on the couch this way. The TV buzzed softly from across the room. Nestled under his chin was the top of Mary's head, and her back was against him. He had his arms wrapped around her middle, and loved the way he could feel her slow breathing in front of him. She was already asleep. Her socked feet were entwined with his own, barely moving, and her calves were warm where they pressed against his. She had dozed off a while ago, succumbing to the irresistible comfort of her position. The TV hadn't been very interesting anyway. She sighed in her sleep, gently pressing back against him. Izzy sighed as well, letting his eyes drift closed as he tightened his embrace and pressed a kiss against the back of Mary's head.[Chapter 4] It wasn't so uncommon, any more, for Mr. Daniels or Mrs. Thomas to get up in the morning and find their child's bed occupied by not one but two teenagers. They weren't particularly concerned about Izzy and Mary getting up to anything they shouldn't, not least of all because there was no way such a commotion would go undetected; mostly, though, it was because they remembered what it was like to be young and in love and there was no arguing that that was what the two teens were. As parents, they thought it wisest to let the young couple be. Usually it happened when they'd been up late together, talking and wasting time, and had just fallen asleep that way. Sometimes it was planned, just because they liked sharing a bed. Little could be as lovely as sleeping soundly next to the person you loved. Once Izzy woke up surprised to find Mary tucked into his side. He'd gone to sleep the night before alone, and in only his boxers; it wasn't a sight entirely new to her, but he was self-conscious all the same – at least until he saw the thin nightie she wore. When his movements woke her, she smiled and explained that she hadn't been able to sleep, that she'd missed him, so in the wee hours of the morning she'd crept onto his balcony to try to get his attention. She'd found his window unlocked, so instead of waking him up, she'd just come inside and slipped into his bed. He smiled, scooped her into his arms, kissed her soundly. Next time she should wake him anyway, he said.[Chapter 5] \"Oh Mary,\" Chuck sighed. \"I'm so glad you got me into Double Dutch. I think it's my calling. I'm so in love with you.\" \"Izzy!\" Tammy cried back, gripping Chuck's hands. \"I love you too. You saved our team. We'd be incomplete without you.\" Izzy and Mary rolled their eyes and exchanged a glance. Clearly thinking the same thing, they clutched at one another. \"Tammy,\" Izzy cried. \"You're the best, most beautiful boxer of all time! Thank you for opening my eyes!\" Mary put a hand on Izzy's face. \"Oh, Chuck. I'm so happy you see past my tough exterior. Even though I could knock you out in two seconds flat, you're still the only one for me.\" Earl looked back and forth among his friends, a confused and disgusted expression on his face. \"And I thought you people made me sick before!\" ","Summary":" Heyo, Mouse here.

But in the 1st movie when Jenko said that thought he and Schmidt really were brothers,this came to my mind and I just had to write it. Now remember in this fic,what Captain Dickson said about going to Medical School,hasn't happened yet. So here my first 21 Jump Street Fanfic,Partners for Life,Brothers for Real. By the way I should say that this is my prequel to 23 Jump Street,which I will be writing. \"Alright just get it over with OK?\"pleaded Schmidt. Having tried to take a bullet for Jenko but failing,Jenko was gonna shoot him once in the arm just to be even. \"Don't worry buddy,it's not gonna hurt a lot.\"said Jenko,and he knew he was lying and smiling between his teeth. (Jenko)One, (Schmidt)Just graze my arm,OK. I don't want you to hit the bone. (Jenko)Two...Three( BANG) Jenko fired the gun at Schmidt,who jumped out of the way of the bullet,which ricocheted off the metal table behind Schmidt and he grazed Jenko's left arm. \"AAAAAHHH! Why am I always getting shot.\"Jenko shouted. Capt. Dickson came over and looked at the two and said,\"Jenko what are you doing? Stop dicking around. Congratulations you two. You managed to unf*** up the situation that you originally f****ed up.\" \"Thanks\"Schmidt replied as Jenko was hunched over in pain of his arm. \"I wish you could unf*** my daughter,but Imma let that be the past. Now if you two sons of b****s are done messing around,my family and I are headed for Long Beach,California for the rest of Spring Break. And I guess since you and Mia are dating,you guys can come with us if you want.\" The two best friends looked at each other and nodded. ***Holiday Inn*** Jenko and Schmidt were in their hotel room that they shared Mia. Dickson allowed her to stay in the boy's room as long as Schmidt didn't try any funny business on her. Or Dickson would taze Schmidt's nuts and then cut'em off. His exact words. The Dicksons said that they meet the duo at the beach,so Jenko and Schmidt were in the bathroom looking in the mirror when Jenko thought of something. \"Hey Schmidt, don't you think it's weird that we're best friends but we're not brothers?\" \"What do you mean?\" \"Well I mean we keep portraying brothers and we're close enough to be brothers,so why not be brothers?\" \"Jenk,I still don't know what you mean,man.\" \"What I mean is,why don't we become brothers for real?\"Jenko responded Schmidt was in shock. His partner,his best friend of four years,wanted to be his real brother. \"You'd really want to be brothers for real?\"Schmidt asked \"Yeah,man. It would be awesome. Plus if we'd have to go undercover again as brothers,it'll be easier and we won't have to lie about being related.\"Jenko said \"I'd f***ing love to,Jenk. But wouldn't we have to get new names?\"Schmidt asked \"What?\" \"Well as brothers,we'd have to have the same last name and s***. So what would we call ourselves?\" \"Well what's your first name?\"asked Jenko \"Morton.\"said Schmidt \"What?Dude no offense,but that name sucks dick.\" laughed Jenko \"Maybe so, but what's yours?\" \"...Gregg.\" \"Your name's Gregg?Dude that sucks even more than mine.\"said Schmidt \"OK,OK,OK,I've got it. Schmidt and Jenko McQuaid.\" Schmidt thought about it and decided in his head and said yes. I mean they already called each other by the last name like it was the first. So why not have the last names be the first? \"I love it,man. Oh but how are we going to become real brothers?\"asked Schmidt. \"There's a courthouse about half an hour from here. We can just go there and make it legal.\" \"Ok let's go!\" ***Long Beach Courthouse*** The duo went down to the courthouse and talked to a judge in his office,to which the judge pulled out a few papers which Jenko and Schmidt had to sign half of and the judge signed the rest. \"Ok. I now legally dub you,Jenko and Schmidt McQuaid.\" He said. Jenko and Schmidt walked outside the courthouse for the first time as real legal brothers. (Schmidt)So you have anything to say,Bro? (Jenko)Yep. Prepare for a life of being and brothers blue! (Schmidt) You wanna high five? (Jenko)F*** yeah,bro. They both jumped up in the air and shared their first air-five as brothers.

That gringo knew it And I knew it. This street, the 22nd one was not to be the last. I realised I was being asked a question. My name. I was scared. If they found out I wasn't Mexican… They'd kill me. I turned my head, summoned my demons, spirit and all the passion in my heart. It took some time. \"My name Jeff.\" They looked confused. \"My name Jeff\" I stared with blank eyed defiance,half fear half determination all… Jeff. \"My name Jeff\" It became palpable, I could feel the words rise out my mouth. \"My\" had a discernible taste, like a hot chilli (red because I ain't no inferior green chilli muncher). It felt like something i could roar out at someone. Next came the \"name\". I felt right and wrong to say, much like putting my identity itself out for display. On one hand it made me vulnerable, showed my weaknesses and all that I am. But on the other, it displays me. Me. It is the essence of who I am and if that is not something to be proud of , something not to challenge the world with, not matter the risk, then I don't know what is. Finally, that succulent Jeff. Jeff. Jeff. Jeff. Jeff. It's so sweet and tender yet so distorted and painful, like a fleeting kiss from lips made of fire or gently grasping a butterfly made of barb wire. The pain teeters on the edge, too much and it would sting, too little and you wouldn't feel anything. A euphoric knife's edge that no one can take from me. It takes up my whole being, forces me to concentrate on it like a knot in my stomach, a Gordians knot that must be unfurled and solved in my esophagus before it is allowed to thread between my teeth. The fear, the risk, the… Beauty that it elicits from me is nigh on indescribable, so much so that my efforts here are much like that of a 2 year old trying to convey the meta-analytical message of \"a picture of Dorian Gray.\" ( unless it's one of those little genius ones with the pianos and such; but they don't count for anything as they often don't make it past 10 before their obscura obliterates them.) All in all, this divine battle of the fates one must endure in order to convey such meaning is well worth it for the asceticism that one achieves. All it requires is a mob of Mexican gangsters staring you down as you pretend not to be a Gringo. The thrill of being caught plays into it but there must be something more. My partner, a dumpy man whose last name is appropriately \"Hill\", turns his portly frame towards me after spending some time attempting to disengage us from these mobsters. I had remained silent, the use of those holy trinity of words now becoming a savour experience. I would wait some time before I would speak them again. The words would haunt me for the rest of my life, soon leading me to start a cult movement of those who have heard the call. But that is for another day…. Jeff. Cont- AN: hey guys what did you think of my first fanfiction? I wanted to tackle a serious topic in one of the most serious fandoms. The exploration of one man's psychosis and how he uses it to garner followers is an idea I've wanted to write about. Channing Tatum's stunning persona and performance in 22 jump street really gave me something to pour my creative juices into. Let me know if you want me to continue or not and if I should change from T to M for some … lemon. That's about it, thanks for reading and please review![Chapter 2] Chapter 2: a resurgence of suppressed power It has been some time since it had happened last. 2 more adventures as well as some side escapades later and this was life now. No longer was it fast cars and stake outs. Our luck would run dry and we knew it. Not too soon after the final case, Mr Hill, much in the fashion that Watson did to Sherlocks materials after a study in scarlet; published a rather romanticised account of events as well as some accompanying CCTV footage. I was a bit miffed at first but the pudgy man had worked his way into my heart long ago and I couldn't bare to deny him. Then it happened. The footage from my revelation in that mobster den was put in as a side reel. It contained a power that I had hidden within, knowing that if the words got out that some, the chosen few would respond with revolution. My previous partner in crime busting and now occasional drinking buddy had released it, perhaps in ignorance, perhaps with the words subconsciously guiding him from the get go. Either way what is done is regrettably done. The forces of the trinity would inevitably converge and many would seek to misrepresent the word of Jeff. I was there at the so called ground zero. The general public saw a distorted version through the transient mirror of the Internet. Sure the words would still carry the majority of their power but the essential essence and aim of such will be devastatingly off and would lead to conflict and potential destruction. I knew that this would happen. The words told me. However, no matter how much it ached my being I dared not use the words that secretly convinced the mob not to kill us. I had no idea how strong they were and the act was out of necessity. It was dumb luck there was no one resonant at that place, or they would be on the same level as me. I bare this power and it screams to be let out. But it is a primal power, a beast and it shall not control me. It may totally destroy me over ttime from the inside but I refuse to allow myself to become a vessel for something else no matter what power it affords me. I know many would kill to live eternally as the antenna of Jeff but they must not have it. I would have carried this to the grave but it seems my partners famous blundering had lead to a catastrophic event. Second hand resonants would not have full power or control, my weak abilities have told me. Resonants are also very rare in the population, thus the medium would have to fan the wild fire flames of this disfigured word of Jeff and turn it into a spreading disease, eating away at the cells within. Little did I know, my name Jeff compilations would become that cancer and serve as a vector to change the metaphysical genetics of the general population. My own revelation making unknowing individuals new Jeffites fills me with a strange mixture of guilt and a sick pride. However this has left me in a precarious situation: If I was to hunt down those who it had profoundly effected, I would have three obstacles; I have no idea who they are with out using my powers My powers are limited and using self control and instinct will blur the line of right and wrong. The most dangerous ones who realised their potential will also know who I am due to my face and voice being the cause. They will see me coming and may even group up on me.

This was karma. After all those years of lying, to the police, to his fiancé- ex-fiancé to himself. Karma was finally coming back to bite him in the ass. \"You didn't go back for him\" that's what he had been mad about. Not about the 2 years he spent in prison, or his father's shop shutting down, no, Tobey was only angry because he hadn't gone back for Pete. Instead, Dino had continued past the finish line; won the race, not that it mattered any more; taken the money and lied to everyone that it had even taken place. Lied about ever having been there, lied about the existence of a third car, lied that he was in possession of said third car, he even lied to the girl he loved that he had nothing to do with her brother's death. If he could lie to her so easily, for so long then maybe he never really loved her at all. He felt his head hit something hard and smooth, the window, and it was only then he realised he was still in his car and he was still crashing, flying awfully close to the edge of a grassy bank. In the distance he saw a red car stop. He saw the red car that was tainted red with the blood of a kid and paint chipped, washed away by the tears of that kid's friends, stop. And it was only then he realised that the car had stopped and it had stopped because he had crashed. And then it did something he had never thought anyone driving that red Koenigsegg Agera would do (mainly because he thought only he would drive that car), it turned back. It came back, and it came back for him . The car was by his side in what felt like an instant and Dino realised he must have blacked out for a second. The thing that brought him back to the land of the living was the screech of rubber on tarmac as the Keonigsegg came to an abrupt stop in the street. He didn't remember when exactly his car stopped crashing, he didn't remember that last spin that had him suddenly jolting to a standstill in his seat. He didn't quite remember the tendrils of smoke and gasoline clawing it's way into his mouth, his nose; filling his lungs; making it impossible to breath. But he did remember calloused hands opening the car door, roughly unbuckling his seatbelt, hurriedly pulling him from the car. He remembered the resulting explosion, an explosion that would have probably killed him had it not been for Tobey. And when Tobey asked \"Are you okay?\" Dino wanted to verbalise the unspoken \"Thank you\" to the street racer, he wanted to scream the never before said \"sorry\" at the universe, he wanted to say anything that painted him as anything other than a jerk but instead all said was \"Yeah, I'm fine.\" And when Tobey didn't say anything, only looked at him a little longer, a little harder, he found himself unable to meet his eyes, wanting to avoid the man's scrutiny. Dino was ashamed, Tobey had always been the better racer, the better man, and now here he was saving his arch nemesis when Dino hadn't even turned back for his own fiancés brother. \"I'm fine!\" He repeated in a harsh tone, much more harsh then he had been aiming for. \"Good.\" And for a second Dino thought that Tobey was just honestly glad to see that Dino was okay, \"This is for Pete.\" The punch that followed whilst wasn't expected, wasn't a complete surprise either. He deserved that. He deserved more than that, much more. He could hear the sirens drawing closer, he saw the lines in Tobey's face crease up in panic, the way he stood up and legged it to the car, his car, the car he had sworn up and down didn't exist. The car was off like a shot. Dino looked to the skies as about a dozen police cars whizzed by at a much slower speed than Tobey had been going, one car slowed down and pulled up next to him. Of course. He had almost forgotten. Not only had he committed obstruction of justice and perjury, but he was also a murderer , or at the very least a man-slaughterer. Dino closed his eyes. \"I guess this is what I deserve. I've been dodging it long enough.\" He wondered, as the police dragged him to his feet and cuffed him, if it made Tobey feel better that the man he had set out to beat, the man he had been trying to convince everyone was evil, was a complete ass hole. If he had had some redeemable features, would Tobey have been more angry? Less angry? If he had apologised? If he had owned up to it and gone to jail as well? If he had just turned back?

Tobey is escorted from the cemetery the second the eulogies are over and barely has time to say his parting words to the rest of the crew before he's carted away to prison. Benny, bless him, yells after the cruiser with promises to visit when possible, but Joe thinks privately that they're all going to go maybe once or twice before it becomes too much of a bother. The state prison Tobey's been sentenced to is two hours away, and paying for the gas is going to be a bitch if they actually visit Tobey every weekend like Benny's suggesting. No one mentions it, not with Tobey going away and Petey just buried, but with Marshall Motor's foreclosing, the crew's got no choice but to head their separate ways. Joe and Finn give Benny a lift back to his place and then head back across the small town to Joe's place, where Finn is the unofficial second resident. The one-floor two bedroom house is where Joe lived with his abuelita up until she passed last year, and Finn's been crashing on a couch in the garage since before then. Now Finn just crashes on the couch in the living room, because he says he can't take abuelita 's old room, Christ's sake. It's not that Finn doesn't have his own people, but from what Joe understands, Finn's family doesn't approve of his lot in life, and for that, Joe's willing to put up with Finn's habits, which include singing cheery pop tunes in the shower and walking around the place acting like wearing clothes is a sin. That evening, Joe pulls their truck (it's his , technically, but the Beast is their baby, really –is as much Finn's car as it is Joe's) into the driveway silently. Silence; it' something Joe's comfortable with. He likes driving in silence, but silence isn't something that suits Finn all that much. Even when he's analyzing road maps and vehicle statistics, Finn is fidgeting, tapping pens or humming under his breath. Now, he just sits still in the passenger seat, hands in his lap. He hasn't even loosened the black tie of his suit. Joe cuts the engine. \"Petey's death has been hard on all of us, man. He's gonna be missed.\" Hell yeah, he will be. In the blurry week that's passed since Little Pete's death, Joe has already begun to notice the gaps in life where Pete should be. There are empty places in conversation for his quips and half-expectant silences where somebody says something as is waiting for his input. And then there's the horrified realization that the holes will never be filled. Little Pete is gone, and to add insult to injury, Tobey's gone off to prison for the foreseeable future, stripping the crew of his presence as leader. Finn doesn't say anything, but he sighs and says quietly, \"Yeah, I know.\" Joe claps him on the shoulder, and they climb out of the truck and head inside, kicking off their shoes at the door. Joe shrugs off his suit jacket, takes of his tie, and rolls up his sleeves. He isn't the sort of guy who can stand wearing a suit for too long. He head to the fridge and pulls out two beers, tossing one to Finn, who catches it silently. \"Microwave dinner or pizza?\" Joe asks. He can cook very little, but more than Finn, but he suddenly feels too weary to attempt to do anything with the stove. \"Microwave,\" Finn says shortly. They sit at the kitchen table as the microwave heats up their meals and Finn opens his can of beer. \"To Little Pete,\" he says quietly, and they toast to that. Over cheap microwave pasta, Finn says, \"So, I took a job in Detroit,\" Joe pauses in the middle of poking at his food, \"Yeah? Where at?\" \"An office,\" Finn says, \"I've got the tech experience for it, and it pays well…\" \"You're not going to last a week in an office,\" Joe says, because it's true . Finn isn't the sort to sit inside all day in a cubicle. He's a man who needs to feel the sun on his skin and the wind in his hair. \"Will too,\" Finn says stubbornly, \"It's a real fucking job, and I can keep it and actually support myself,\" \"What, so you're moving out?\" Joe says. He's not sure why he's being defensive about it, but they're both standing. \"Yeah, bro, I am,\" Finn says, eyes wide and brow furrowed. A scowling Finn is no better than a silent Finn and Joe is still tired. He finds himself wishing he could see Finn smiling and his usually easy going self. Finn has other plans. \"I'm going to Detroit,\" he says, \"That's hours away, and I've already found a place over there, I'm moving in tomorrow,\" \"You couldn't have mentioned this earlier?\" Joe snaps. \"What, during Pete's funeral?\" Finn retorts. They both fall quiet. \"Whatever, man,\" Joe says finally, \"It's not my problem if you wanna spend the rest of your life at a desk. What time are we heading out tomorrow?\" Finn seems to hesitate before he says, \"I've already got a lift, Joe, you don't have to,\" \"Oh.\" Something twists uneasily in Joe's stomach as he sits down, and suddenly he doesn't feel very hungry anymore. How can things be changing so fast? The crew is splitting up fast. Joe stands again and goes to his room, leaving his dinner behind on the table. He closes the door and his room is dark, but he doesn't turn on the light. He just slides to the floor, back against the closed door, and he leans his head back and closes his eyes. This isn't right, he thinks. Finn belongs working in a garage, among the smells of gasoline and the rooms that echo and the machines and the cars. He belongs with Joe, in Mount Kisco, with Benny and Tobey and P— But that's just it, isn't it? The crew's already been irrevocably split apart. With this bitter thought in mind, Joe climbs to his feet and opens the door again. Finn is sitting at the table, looking down at his food miserably. He looks up when Joe sits down again, surprise evident in his expression. Finn can't lie to save his life, and Joe can read him like an open book. It's not altogether difficult, with the way Finn's emotions play so clearly through his big green eyes. Joe feels a little bit guilty about storming out earlier like an angry teenager. There's something else, there, something warm that spreads from his stomach up through the rest of his body when he sees the way Finn lights up upon his return, but he can't put a name to the feeling. \"Wake me up before you go if you're heading out early,\" Joe tells Finn, \"And don't fucking think I won't call you in Detroit,\" Finn grins and it's all Joe needs to see. 732 Days Later … When Tobey calls fresh out of prison a day earlier than he said, he adds that he's got a Ford Shelby Mustang in his possession – the Ford Shelby Mustang, that Joe had last seen on showcase when they finished building it. \"We're on our way to San Francisco,\" Tobey says, not bothering to clarify who 'we' is, \"But if I'm racing this car in the De Leon, we need to fix it up a little. I've got Benny on board, but Joe, we need\" \"-Finn,\" Joe says. \"He's in Detroit, losing his mind in some office,\" He gives the address and says, \"He'll come, Tobey, the De Leon is too much to resist.\" When he says it, he knows it's true. He's been calling Finn every couple of days to tell him to come back –to demand it. Honestly, he didn't think Finn would last so long. They've seen each other once in two years, and spoken over the phone numerous times. Joe's been trying to convince Finn to come back to Mount Kisco and work at the garage he's found a job at, not too far out of town. Finn hasn't said yes yet, but Joe can tell he's wearing him down, and it was just a matter of time. The De Leon just speeds things up, no pun intended. Joe takes the Beast to Detroit, where he meets Tobey outside Finn's office building, and it's good to finally see him again. He looks a little worse for wear, and is a little more reserved with his emotions than he used to be, but he smiles when he sees Joe and introduces him briefly to the cheery blonde sidekick he's acquired. They fall into talk about cars and they look at the Mustang's lag when it pulls forward. For a moment, it feels like old times. Later, Joe directs Tobey to park outside of Finn's window, and calls Finn. The police chase begins and Joe goes up to the doors of the office at the same moment Finn walks out, grinning maniacally and stark naked save for his striped socks. Joe yelps when Finn throws his arms around him and plants a big wet kiss on both of his cheeks. He can feel Finn's junk pressed against his thigh, for Christ's sake. He thinks he might still be blushing when they head toward the Beast, and demands why Finn is naked in the first place. His answer –as a measure to makes sure he never comes back –makes Joe wants to grin as wide as Finn is, but he's got a reputation to maintain, so he just continues to scowl and bites out a line about underwear. He lends Finn a white T-shirt and jeans and they head out after Tobey to San Francisco. They've actually got a head start in the Beast while Tobey does his tricks to lose the cops, and Finn rolls down the windows as they speed out of Detroit and hollers a wordless expression of freedom into the wind. When they hit the highway, Joe makes the executive decision to roll up the fucking windows, but that doesn't stop Finn from being the cheeriest bastard in the world. \"God,\" he says, falling back against his seat, \"I felt like I was withering away inside,\" \"Yeah, well,\" Joe says, \"You don't belong in an office, anyway. Or a suit,\" \"The suit was pretty nice,\" Finn offers, \"I would've kept it on for you,\" \"I would've made you take it off,\" Joe says without thinking. There's a pause in the conversation and then Finn laughs, \"You were checking me out, I knew it!\" Joe slouches over the wheel and scowls. The toothpick he's perpetually chewing on splinter between his grinding teeth and he has to throw it out and take a new one from where he keeps extras in the cup-holder in a box. \"Was not,\" he mutters petulantly. Apparently the radio has been on this whole time, because Benny's voice suddenly crows, \"Was too!\" Joe turns off the comm-link hastily and can feel warmth creeping up his neck. Finn is giving Joe a look that for once, he can't read, but it's not a bad look, he doesn't think, so he doesn't ask about it. Joe watches Finn out of the corner of his eye when he drives, like he thinks Finn might disappear if he looks away, like he's still not sure he's really there. The thing is, Joe has missed Finn. Phone calls or not, Joe hasn't seen Finn in months and he'll die before his admits how much it took his breath away to see him again, walking out of the office building with a smile that could light up the heavens. Tobey wins the De Leon –of course he does –and promptly gets arrested again, but they all know he's going to be out soon. It feels like a weight has been lifted, and Joe realizes that Little Pete's death has still been hanging around them all this time, but now Dino's going away and it's all been done right; Petey's death has been avenged. Finn turns to Joe as Monarch gives his closing words on the screen they're watching and he says, \"Christ, Joey, we did it. He won the De Leon,\" he runs his hands through his hair like he still can't believe it and then he turns to Joe and grabs his by the face and kisses him, hard. It takes Joe's breath away and he just stands there like a moron, letting Finn kiss him with warm, dry lips. It feels like a punch to the gut when Finn pulls away, because he doesn't just lean back, he pulls away , stepping back several feet. \"Fuck, man,\" he says apologetically, \"I thought you –I don't know, it seemed like you…\" He shakes his head, \"I must've been reading it all wrong. Look, Joe, forget it, I\" \"-The hell are you doing?\" Joe manages to choke out in a very strangled voice. Finn looks away. \"Over there , I mean,\" Joe says, \"Get over here, you idiot,\" They meet in the middle this time, mouths and tongues and teeth clashing together desperately before they find rhythm. Standing there, arms wrapped around Finn's waist and Finn's fingers tangled in his hair –it feels right , and Joe knows he could get used to this. \"Don't work in a fucking office,\" he says in between kisses, \"Fuck, move in with me again or –I don't know…\" They're going to get their share of the De Leon prize and they could buy a better place –the possibilities are endless and overwhelming. \"I'm never leaving again,\" Finn vows with a laugh, \"God, I must've lost my mind to decide to leave you,\" \"Then don't,\" Joe says. \"Never,\" Finn says, and when he kisses Joe again, it feels like a promise.

After watching Need For Speed I felt the need to write something fluffy and this came up. I'm kinda rusty, so don't be too harsh if the characters are OOC or anything. Please do review, it helps me out a lot! Disclaimer: I don't own the characters in this story or Need For Speed for that matter. All rights belong to their respectful owners. \"I don't think you're ready for this jelly, I don't think you're ready for this jelly, I don't think you're ready for this when my body too bootylicious for ya babe.\" Tobey stepped inside his apartment, wearing a confused expression at the song, blasting from his stereo. Well, now it was their stereo. He hadn't thought he would ever hear this particularly girlish R'N'B song, sounding off the walls of his home. For his choice of music Tobey preferred more rock and hard rock, occasionally giving in to heartfelt ballads if he was in the mood. Well, he wasn't made of rocks, you know, he was still a man with feelings. He never did enjoy the mainstream pop songs on the radio but he learned to at least tolerate them and even a few beers can make the worst song ever into an enjoyable beat. Though, this wasn't the case today. The thing that kept him from rolling his eyes and yelling, \"Could you please turn that piece of garbage off?!\" was the soft voice singing along to the lyrics. Instead he arched his eyebrows in surprise. \"Well, that's new,\" he thought to himself. Tobey turned slightly to his right and placed his keys on the hanger, along with his jacket and listened closely. There it was again. Unmistakably hers but still sounding different from her usual voice. He smiled slightly and tried his best to move stealthily through the living room. To say it was 'untidy' would be a huge understatement. Tobey wasn't exactly the neatest person and his apartment was a proud example of what people would call a 'man lair'. That and the seemingly endless brown boxes with various labels (a result from her recent moving in) made the apartment look like a big garbage disposal. Fine, it may be an exaggeration but it was really bad . As he tried to maneuver between a box, containing fragile items (\"What the hell did she bring in that,\" he thought) and the couch, Tobey tripped on a shirt that was lying on the floor probably for weeks and nearly fell face first onto the box but he managed to keep his balance. He let out a breath of relief and continued walking cautiously. Although he highly doubted the she would hear him over that goddamn song, he still preferred a safe path in this endeavor, quickly making a note of all the times he picked the overly crazy and dangerous decision. He smiled at some of the memories, flooding into his mind, lots of them including Pete. His smile faded slightly. It had been months since his death and Tobey had considerably gotten better and had reached the point where his eyes wouldn't water just at the thought of him in that Koenigsegg Agera R, rolling too many times, catching flames, slamming against the bridge's wall and finally falling down on the small coast. She had helped him a great deal in moving on and being a sweet distraction to his worries. That thought brought him back to the present and he resumed sneaking up on her. Tobey followed the sound of her voice that was leading him to the bedroom. He acknowledged that she was trying to imitate the singers but he was still able to tell apart her voice from theirs. While they (whoever 'they' were) had seemingly powerful and generic voices, hers was definitely weaker but sweeter and more melodic. It perfectly matched how she looked and her naïve side but since they got together (and of course more comfortable with each other) she showed off her crazier side more. He found that he loved that one more but he was glad that she was used to him that much that she let herself crumble in front of him from time to time and show him her fragile side. That song was definitely not suited for her voice but apparently she thought otherwise and enjoyed herself. Tobey finally reached the bedroom, thanking her in his head for leaving the door open. He leaned on the doorway and admired the view in front of him with a smirk. Apparently, Julia had taken it upon herself to clean the apartment, starting from the bedroom and she was probably so bored that she decided to put on a song to amuse herself while tidying up. One thing led to another and now she was fully on singing and dancing while picking things up and putting them in an acceptable place. She was completely oblivious to her boyfriend staring at every single one of her movements, so she continued her actions without any shame. Although she was a good driver and had steady hands on the wheel (though Tobey would never tell her that), she was an absolute klutz in dancing. The main reason was probably that the floor was covered in obstacles (mainly clothes, figures, keys and other stuff) and she tripped nearly every second that she walked/danced; plus her arms (or arm, depending if she had one or two free arms) were flailing around like a penguin's. It was clearly hilarious but also adorable to Tobey. After some time he finally decided to speak up and end her little performance. \"Why didn't you tell me you could sing?\" he shouted over the music. Julia jumped and dropped a couple of books on the floor before quickly turning around with both a surprised and terrified expression on. That made Tobey smirk even more which angered Julia but she was too ashamed to act on it and instead just rushed to the stereo to turn off the music. The pro driver's smirk increased when he saw that his girlfriend had flushed cheeks the color of a tomato. Julia cleared her throat awkwardly and went over to the books she dropped to pick them up and place them on a bookshelf. \"You should really knock before you enter a room, you know. It's called manners,\" she retorted, trying to hide the embarrassment in her voice. \"The door was opened. There was nothing to knock on.\" Damn it. She couldn't think of anything smart to say back so she focused on arranging the books on the shelf. When she didn't answer, Tobey let out a small chuckle. \"Great,\" she thought, \"Now he's gonna tease me.\" Julia figured it would be best to distract him from that to avoid further embarrassment on her part but her mind went blank when she tried to think of something. The first thing that popped up was stupid and it would in no way distract him fully but she had no other choice. \"I rearranged a bit, hope you don't mind. I think the room opened up a lot more that way but I've got a lot of work before it actually looks like a habitable space. Don't even think of living like that again, I am not cleaning up after you. Though it does look like I have to do the same in the entire apartment.\" \"I'll help,\" Tobey replied, earning a bemused expression from Julia who now had the courage to turn around and look at him. \"Oh, really?\" \"Yeah, is that so unbelievable?\" \"Yes, actually, it is.' \"Why is that?\" he asked, moving closer and closer to her. While she would have enjoyed that in any other moment, now she was thinking frantically what to answer, just to prolong the conversation enough so he could either leave or start helping her without discussing her little stunt. \"Well, you're always in the garage or at a race or God knows where while I'm here, trying to move in and get my things unpacked,\" Julia finally said, putting her hands on her hips. Tobey hadn't stopped moving closer and Julia found herself retreating backwards until she slammed into the bookshelf. He smiled at that and kept moving closer until finally he put his arms on both of her sides, leaning on the wall behind her. Their faces were inches apart and both of them could feel each other's heartbeats, although Julia's was much faster. Tobey leaned in just enough to let their lips barely brush. At that moment she knew she couldn't hide anything. \"Say the word,\" he whispered, \"and I'll be here whenever you need me.\" Screw him. Screw him and his handsome face and his body pressed against hers and his tasty-looking lips, touching against her own when he talked with that low sexy voice. Screw him. She tried to regain her composure and sound confident but her voice betrayed her when she said, \"So, does that mean you'll help me?\" She barely even heard herself plus her voice was very high-pitched. Tobey smirked, just to tease her a little more and then closed the gap between them. Julia melted into the kiss. Her hands instinctively went up to his neck and dug into his hair. The gesture seemed to click something in him because his arms nearly suffocated her when he wrapped them around her waist. After some long seconds of passionate kissing they pulled out, panting, especially Julia. Barely able to form a straight thought she was positive that he had long forgotten about her singing and dancing. Tobey straightened up a bit, without leaving his gaze on hers and spoke. \"Of course. But you didn't answer my first question. Why didn't you tell me you can sing?\" Shit. ","Summary":" Hey, I'm back! Haven't updated in a long time.

Wait, no –he's always like that. Finn's grin widens when he sees Joe standing in the lobby. For all of Joe's talk, he's a prude at heart (okay, so maybe it is a little strange for Finn to be exposing himself to the entire building), and when he sees Finn, his eyes widen in horror and he starts backing away, fast . \"What the hell?\" he says shakily, still retreating from Finn, \"Where're your clothes , man?\" They make it outside without too much trouble, except that Joe is avoiding a well-deserved hug of gratitude, and it kind of hurts. Joe doesn't let Finn sit inside the Beast until he's put on a pair of jeans that are stowed under the passenger seat with a bag of Finn's old clothes that he vaguely remembers leaving at Joe's place over the years. \"Yeah, man!\" Finn shouts, slapping the Beast's dashboard as Joe starts the engine, \"We're back ,\" \"Put on your seatbelt,\" Joe grumbles. \"Tobey and Benny are cutting through the city –we'll take the freeway to get a head start. Jesus, man, put a shirt on,\" \"You like me like this,\" Finn insists, but he digs through the bag for a t-shirt anyway. He finds a navy button-down in the bag, too, and doesn't mention that it's not his, just puts it on. \"We going or what?\" he says, nodding toward the road. At this moment, Joe chooses to be a burrito of riddles, and he stares at Finn with an unreadable expression as he chews on his ever-present toothpick, \"Yeah,\" he says, and pulls the Beast off the side of the road. Joe is a silent driver, always has been. It's Finn's God-given duty to talk his ear off, and he does, complaining loudly about his office job and updating Joe on his days since the last time Joe called to check in on three days earlier. \"It's good to see you, man,\" Joe says when Finn draws a breath, \"Though I thought I wouldn't have to see your ugly mug until Christmas,\" \"Shut up, you love this face,\" Finn says dismissively. Joe mutters his denial, frowning at the road, because besides being inexplicably addicted to chewing on toothpicks, Joe is also deep on his journey along a great river known as Denial (Finn's an expert; he's Egyptian-American).Well, Finn's pretty sure that's what's happening, because he drops enough fucking hints, so Joe has to be ignoring Finn's clues on purpose. He's kissed Joe – twice –and sure, both of them were chaste mistletoe kisses from two years ago, but Finn's not just gonna kiss someone twice (especially not his best friend ) if he doesn't have some hopes of future boning occurring. And yeah, Finn would've been trying harder to get in Joe's pants except he'd only recently decided for sure he actually wanted Joe, and the timing had been awful. It's going to be put right, now, though; they're going to bring Dino down and Tobey's going to win the goddamn De Leon. He has to. \"Look,\" Joe says suddenly. The communication screen in the Beast lights up as the Monarch begins a new panel. Benny has apparently uploaded the aerial recording of Tobey's police chase and has sent it to the Monarch's site. The announcement is made: Tobey's the last racer to join the De Leon. Finn and Joe both let out triumphant whoops. \"We're in, brother!\" Joe says, grinning. He looks good when he isn't frowning, but Finn will admit that he doesn't mind the brooding, either. Joe grinning makes him look like a completely different person, but somehow he's still just Joe Peck. They pound fists and Finn revels in the sparkle in Joe's eyes. When he's not busy being an enigmatic Mexican wrap (and okay, Finn needs to give up on this metaphor), Joe lets his emotions play across his face clear as an HD movie. Finn likes to think he's a pretty straightforward guy, too, but he can't deny he's got things he lies about. \"Shit,\" Finn says, \"He's racing in the De Leon –for real. It's finally happening,\" \"Hell yeah, man,\" Joe says happily. Finn sits back contently and listens to the sound of the wind passing by outside of the car and feels the way the Beast's engine thrums under the seats. The last time he was on a long-distance ride with Joe was almost two years ago, when he'd found his job in Detroit and had forced Joe to drive him into the city and help him move into his new place. The trees along the highway pass in a blur of green and brown and Finn looks away from the window back to Joe, who's staring ahead, one hand resting lazily on the top of the steering wheel. They go on quietly for a while and then they check in with Benny and Tobey. They speed up to drive beside the Mustang and Joe smirks at Finn and his next words almost give Finn a heart attack because Joe doesn't flirt . He barely knows how ; Finn's seen him with girls –he just talks to them like he would the rest of the crew. Finn doesn't have time to be shocked, though, and he's got a job to do, so he just grins wide and says, \"Oh, you were checking me out!\" The Mustang speeds off after the refueling and the Beast takes the exit ramp, Finn stretches his arms out and feels the wind rushing through his clothes and hair. Something like excitement builds suddenly in his chest, and he just feels so free and so he yells out into the air, because it feels like the right thing to do. When Finn finally climbs back into the Beast, Joe's driving them into a town to refuel. He glances at Finn and smiles knowingly as Finn settles back into his seat, like he could hear Finn screaming his lungs hoarse outside –well, he probably could. \"You remember when you first moved to Mount Kisco?\" Joe says suddenly while they're at the gas station, filling up the Beast's tank. Finn startles a little. \"Yeah man,\" he says. Of course he remembers; he'd been the new kid on the first day of sixth grade and he'd made friends with Benny in first period. At lunch, he'd been introduced to Tobey and Joe, who at that time, had been chewing on the end of a pencil. The rest of the crew had all been in seventh grade at the time. \"I met all your dumb asses on the first day of school,\" \"You couldn't tell one car from another,\" \"I was eleven ,\" Finn protests, \"And I caught on quick enough, man,\" \"Yeah,\" Joe says, sounding fond, \"Yeah you did,\" He doesn't say anything else, so Finn asks, \"Is there a reason you're choosing to take a trip down memory lane right now?\" Joe switches the toothpick in his mouth to the other corner, \"Nah, brother,\" he says, \"Just thinking,\" Finn shakes his head, \"Whatever. Look, the tank's full, we'd better head out.\" They've got a schedule to keep on top of. Joe nods and they pile back into the Beast and then they're off. The thing about Joe is that when he's talking even when he's not. Finn knows the way he fidgets, because Joe practically speaks through body language sometimes. That's just them, though; to others, it sometimes appears that Finn is the mouth piece to their little duo, but that's not true. Joe, of course, can speak verbally on his own –quite articulately, too –but even when he's quiet, his stares and posture and the way he's chewing on his fucking toothpick speak his thoughts to Finn. Right now, something's on Joe's mind, and it has to be more than casual reflections on the past because Joe is chewing on his toothpick hard , and the line of his shoulders is tense. The crease between his eyebrows is a little deeper than usual, too. Joe saves Finn from having to ask what's wrong when he asks, \"You know what you're gonna do after this is all over, Finn?\" \"Nah,\" He's not going back to his old job, that's for sure. \"If Tobey wins the De Leon, we'll reopen Marshall Motors,\" he says. It's not even a question, because he knows that's what they'll do. Joe smiles a little and doesn't say anything. Finn's ready to rip his hair out because something's going on in that burrito brain of Joe's and Finn doesn't know what and it's killing him –slowly, and painfully. On the outside, he just continues to maintain a neutral expression. Later, when it's night and Finn's with Julia in the hospital in San Francisco, he waits outside the room even though Julia is awake because Finn's never liked to see people who have been in a car crash. When he sees the worry in Tobey's eyes as he approaches, it kills him a little inside, and he wonders what he would do if Joe was in Julia's place. Lose his mind, probably. He hugs Tobey perhaps a little harder than necessary, but Tobey doesn't seem to mind. When Tobey leaves, Finn stays with Julia, sitting in the room as she sleeps. Joe and Tobey are fixing up Dino's stolen car, and the De Leon is the next morning. Everything's coming to a rapid conclusion, and all that awaits is the final outcome of their efforts. In the morning, Finn meets Joe in the lobby of the hospital and they hijack a TV screen in one of the waiting areas to watch the De Leon broadcast. Joe is chewing on a toothpick faster than usual, which is the only sign he gives of his nervousness, but Finn barely slept, and he's jumpy with cafeteria coffee. \"Jesus, Finn, stop moving,\" Joe complains. \"If you're going to act like a hyperactive child, I'm going to hold your fucking hand,\" he warns. \"I'll hold your hand,\" Finn says petulantly. Joe levels him with one of his unreadable looks that has Finn breaking eye contact first, but just as Finn is looking away, Joe reaches out and snags his hand. Joe's hand is dry and his fingertips are slightly cold for no reason. \" Dude ,\" Finn pretends to complain. Joe interrupts, saying, \"I'm not blind, alright?\" Finn spends too long in stunned silence, trying to decipher his meaning, and Joe turns his attention back to the De Leon broadcast just as Tobey arrives on the scene and the race is about to begin. Joe is holding Finn's hand. He's holding it and Finn's got the De Leon to concentrate on, goddammit! \" Joe ,\" he says, pulling his hand out of Joe's grasp. Joe looks momentarily bewildered and then that damn look is back. He shrugs and turns back to the race and it's momentarily forgotten in all of the excitement. When Dino's car flips, Finn feels a surge of joy –not at Dino's mishap, but because of the other implications. It becomes real when the Monarch announces that Tobey Marshall is the soon to be winner of the De Leon. Finn gives a shout at the same time as Joe and they turn to each other, jumping in excitement and then they're hugging and Joe's arms are wrapped tight around Finn's waist. Ten minutes later, Tobey is under arrest and Finn and Joe are still celebrating his victory. \"Little Pete would be over the moon, brother,\" Joe says, grinning. He's lost his toothpick somehow. \"Yeah, well, he saw it coming, didn't he?\" Finn says. Petey would be crowing over Tobey's win for days on end if he were here. There's a sobering moment between them as their thoughts both turn to Little Pete, and Finn says finally, \"We should go check on Julia. She was probably watching the race, too, but just in case, we should let her now what happened.\" Joe nods. \"Right,\" he says. Finn clears his throat and turns to make his exit, already mentally berating himself for failing to seize a moment –because there had been a moment –and what had Joe meant earlier, saying he wasn't blind? A hand wraps around Finn's arm, stopping him from leaving and when he turns, he has a split second to register Joe coming toward him before his mouth, open with surprise, is covered by Joe's. It takes him a moment to register that Joe is kissing him –actually kissing him –Joe, who has never given any inclination of liking men (although, true, neither has Finn) is kissing him, open mouthed and with tongue and it's dirty — Finn doesn't let shock immobilize him for long, and he cups Joe's face and kisses back fiercely. When they break apart, Finn knows he's probably got a little bit of beard burn, and they're both breathless. For a moment, all Finn can think is that he's fucking glad Joe isn't that much taller than him, because it would be a pain if he had to strain to reach every time in the future. \"Just so you know,\" Joe says, smirking a little, \"I was checking you out.\" ","Summary":" Sometimes Joe is a mystery wrapped in an enigma tucked inside a burrito; other times, he's a grouch"},{"Movie":"Need for Speed","Title":"Need for Love","Author":"kayfulton87","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10225461","Passage":"[Chapter 1] \"He won, he won!\" I knew it!

Six months locked up, could have been a year. But he knows he's finally free, he knows he had brought justice to Petey's death and nothing could be better. Ten seconds later, the roaring sound he so loved was heard from a distance. He squinted his eyes to try and see the approaching car clearly. As it stopped right in front of him and the window was slid down, he leaned against the door and took a look inside as saw it was Julia. \"Get in... I'll drive\" she snapped. \"I've seen you drive and it's... terrifying\" he replied, walking up around the car. Julia smiled and took off her seat belt. She crawled up into the right seat as soon as Tobey opened up the door. \"You know there's a door, right?\" he commented. \"And where's the fun in that?\" Julia replied, grinning. Tobey chuckled and got inside. \"Come on, love birds\" Finn was heard after he finished making kissing noises. \"We're gonna get Benny out of the clink\" \"Yeah, Maverick's getting out early for good behavior\" \"Yeah, apparently he started some fitness program for the inmates or some shit\" \"We got five hours to get to Utah... let's go\" Tobey glanced over to Julia and smiled, his hands already on the wheel. Seconds later, that roaring sound was back on and he raced down the road. Couple of minutes later, Julia began glancing at him from underneath then quickly turning her head aside. She finally took a deep breath and asked him... \"So, how does it feel?\" \"What?\" he replied. \"To be out again?\" \"Like I never left\" he replied, holding onto the glimpse. Julia kept staring at him too and then whispered... \"You might want to keep your eyes on the road\" Tobey chuckled and turned his glance away. A couple of minutes later, Julia mentioned... \"Oh, I got you a change of clothes if you would like to... you know\" \"You do realize that I haven't wore these for six months, right?\" \"Yeah, but... they're starting to smell anyways\" Tobey chuckled... \"We'll take a rest stop up a mile away, we still have about four hours left\" \"With you driving, I think we'll be there in three\" With that comment, Tobey revved the engine slightly and then glanced back to her and said... \"Maybe two\" with a grin upon his face. And just as he finished that sentence, he pressed on the gas pedal further more. Julia gasped lightly before smiling herself. In a matter of minutes, they arrived at a gas station up a mile from where they were. Tobey grabbed a hold of the clothes that Julia had brought him while she took the liberty of going to buy them something to eat and drink. Shortly after, Tobey walked out the store and approached Julia, where she was sitting on the hood of the car. She held out a package for him... \"Hope you like turkey sandwiches... at least it says turkey\" Julia said. \"Thanks...\" he said, leaning against the car. They kept quiet for a couple of more minutes until they were ready eating. Tobey remained where he was, glancing from side to side. \"Hey, I never really got the chance to thank you for last time\" she commented. \"For what?\" he asked, looking at her. \"You know, coming back for me, risking getting caught...\" \"Yeah, well... it wasn't a choice to leave you there\" Julia smiled as a slight blush ran up her cheeks as she turned her head aside. \"And if I remember correctly, you did thank me for that when you came to visit\" \"Yeah, but there was always a barrier\" \"A barrier...\" \"You know, the glass windows, thousand eyes watching over you every move\" \"Huh... well, there's no barrier now\" Tobey commented, standing straight and turning her way where he was face to face with her. \"No, there's not\" Julia replied, looking straight at him. Grinning, Tobey placed his hands at her sides and leaned in. Brushing his lips against hers, he captured her mouth with his and kissed her softly at first then a bit roughly. They pulled apart a few seconds later. Julia kept grinning... \"You know, I'm kind of thinking that the whole barrier thing was an excuse\" Tobey said, their faces still inches away. \"Hmm, you think?\" Tobey chuckled and so did Julia. \"We should get going. I don't want our pilot to think we have forgotten about him\" Julia said, getting down from the car. In a matter of seconds, they were back into the car and already driving down the road. Halfway through the ride, Julia leaned her head against the window and shortly after, she was sound asleep. Seeing that, Tobey grabbed a hold of his jacket from the back seat and covered her with it. He smiled as he manages to touch her cheek for a brief moment before setting his eyes back to the road. Tobey could see Joe and Finn's truck in a distance right up as he was approaching the prison. From his side, Julia was stirring in her sleep and shortly after, he heard her say... \"Are we there yet?\" The sudden halt answered her question and she sat up to see Joe and Finn staring at them from the wind screen. \"Nice for you to join us\" Joe said. \"Or did you have to take a detour, huh?\" Finn continued, wiggling his eyebrows. Tobey shook his head and got out of the car, followed by Julia. Finn walked over to him and hugged him. Joe did the same to Julia and then switched. \"Nice to see you on the outside, man\" Finn commented. \"Good to be on the outside\" Tobey replied. \"How about our pilot, when's he getting out?\" Julia asked. \"Right about...\" 'whistles' \"Now, that's a great booty...\" Maverick was heard from behind them. \"... Now\" Joe finished. \"Which one are you talking about, exactly?\" Finn asked, already knowing the answer. \"Which one do you think... hey, Juliet, wanna go for a ride?\" Maverick commented once again, wiggling his eyes. Julia sniggered... \"What's up, man?\" Finn told Maverick, again with the hugging. They all took turns, leaving Tobey for last. \"Great to see you, man\" Maverick told him. \"You too...\" \"So, I think congratulations are in order. You smashed that race\" \"What, you had any doubts?\" Joe commented. \"A little, a little. Especially when you went back for that dofus, but... you came through\" \"Well, I didn't want to make the same mistake he did\" Tobey replied. Maverick nodded and then said... \"So, I need some news, I need some news... what's going on between you two?\" pointing at Tobey and Julia. They both glanced at each other and chuckled, shaking their heads. \"I'm just asking, you know... if you need any help, I've been working on some tunes...\" \"Here we go...\" Joe commented. \"Listen to this... 'Julia, your eyes sparkle like the stars... Oh, Julia, I'm not waiting for no odds. Julia, you're looking so damn fly...\" All four of them laughed before Finn said... \"Yeah, you need to work on that rhyming a little bit more\" \"Give it time, give it time... it'll sink in\" Joe shook his head and approached his truck. \"Come on, let's go. We have to get to the garage\" he said. \"You need a ride?\" Tobey asked Maverick. \"As much as I want to see that baby from the inside, I don't want to disturb what's going on right here, so.. I'm riding with y'all\" Maverick said, walking towards Joe's truck. \"Greeeaat\" Finn commented. Tobey chuckled before he and Julia got back inside the car.

It's just so easy for movie writers to make a villain out of someone without even trying. At least give him a storyline of some sort or something, give him some development. [sigh] This is Dino's catharsis. Nothing \"How did you feel when you would hit Anita?\" \" Nothing .\" \"How did you feel when she let you go?\" \" Nothing .\" \"How did you feel when you killed Pete?\" He blinked, his eyes vacant. \"Nothing.\" / The first feeling that tingled through his fingers around the wheel when the car flipped ferociously around the air was regret. Dino felt regret. It twisted inside him for a moment, only a second, before he felt its sharp edge twirl in his stomach. His eyes caught the red vehicle soar before him and the blade of regret deepened until he could no longer feel the emotion. Until Dino could no longer feel the regret twinge in his stomach, as the blood seeped through his shirt. He knew he had done wrong, but he could not go back and he could definitely not apologize. He was done for, he had completely, and utterly pass the line of recompensing. He blamed no one, but himself. Immediately, he felt disgust. His chest rose and fell, but the dagger that remained in his stomach made it hurt to breathe. The regret had taken the form of disgust, twisting and shifting every now and then in the tiny seconds he had felt something. He had killed someone. He had killed someone. It wasn't a hit, or a bullet through the leg, it was a vicious kill that left him dangling on a thread of disgust. It was only for a minute, but after, after, he felt something else. He felt...felt sorry? It was only for a moment. The car landed on the ground, ferociously, and was consumed in a fierce, ominous fire. It was the last he had seen of Pete, and he felt sorry. He had felt just as sorry when his hands landed on the brunette—Anita—and her cries filled the quiet rooms of his house. He feels sorry, he does, but it's not enough and he knows this. Dino can't just apologize anymore. He doesn't even want to. The car flickers in fire and Tobey stops. Dino doesn't. By then, his heart grew cold, the metal had dried. He knew that he was absolutely done for and that the most he could do was run, run and pretend that he hadn't felt anything. All he could do was pretend that he hadn't regretted anything he did, because then it would be easier. It would be easier to pretend, because he wouldn't get hurt, because it would be easier for everyone else to pin the antagonist tail on him, then to actually be able to understand that he had felt repulsive and that he usually does every single freaking day that goes by. Dino feels far from human. He feels like a ...monster . Suddenly, his fingers peel from the wheel and fall onto the fabric of his shirt—blood. He feels blood. He's bleeding. Dino then feels pain, confusion and pain. He's bleeding, and the blood streams continuously. It seems that through it all, the wound was actually there, meeting the tips of his fingers. / \"You really feel nothing?\" \"Of course.\" / —no one is capable of understanding that even the monster feels disgusting himself.

I'm surprised I'm even posting it with the amount of appreciation I actually have for it. There are a lot of moments in which the writing isn't as great as I thought it to be and I just decide against posting it. However, look at where it's gotten! It's on fanfiction, to my dismay. I'm like seriously worried about it being on here. There are a couple of scenes I didn't know how to get around, so I had to edit it like a thousand times. I should just probably let you read, right. Right. Warning! This story carries heavy tones of depression, violence, and mental instability, in other words, insanity. Hope you enjoy! TALLIES l. One. He sketches nimbly with a chopped pencil. The jail cement meets his eyes; his vision coming into contact with stains of grime, blood, and occasional chips indented. His bruised knuckles flex, as he presses the pencil against the wall. The pencil bitten by many teeth, some that may have bitten his arm or neck, hurts beneath his palm. He drags it down, creating a strange, crooked line, and he feels frustrated. He doesn't seem to do anything right. The tally looks back at him, faintly sloped on the wall. It vaguely smiles, it's eyes missing and nose gone. Dino feels already irritable. It's only a month and he's falling into insanity. Though he knows this is all consequence, his heart beats rapaciously in his chest from the blood pressure increasing through his veins. He's always been some kind of a psycho, a... monster. The title hasn't bothered him until now though. The stupid tally is smiling at him, it's amused. It's laughing at the small drops of sanity falling through his fingers. He feels so far from any control. His eyes clenched closed from the thick wall suffused with grim, explicit episodes that he's obligated to reel vividly like a movie. He shouldn't have killed Pete. He knows this, he tells himself this all the time around. His parents didn't raise him on such standards and he hardly made any gestures that he would grow up differently. He was a normal kid, there were hardly any loud signs he was going to be unstable, evil. There were a couple thoughts he had—destructive, violent, vicious—but they were small images that flickered at night, when he was bored. Most of the time, he had sports, homework, religious events—ones his parents would ritually attend—that filled his time. When he got that job, that offering, his days grew almost quickly of boredom or of destructive thoughts. He would sit across the computer screen, meetings or dates to assemble, and he thinks of Anita—she was just an assistant before—her hair, porcelain skin, perfection that needed to be scraped. He hated how beautiful and nice she was all at once. Dino had no patience for the resounding affects, the naivety, ignorance, or vanity she held in her heart hidden. He knew her flaws were better than his would ever be. She was perfect and he was not. Pete was clever and he was not. Tobey was powerful, great at driving, though his intelligence was lacking, and better than he would ever be. He hated that. He hates them, all of them. He even hates himself. Most of all, he hates the tally. It's happy than he will ever be, happy and he is not. \"Dino! Idiot!\" He grimaces, shoulders tensing. His palm had sweat with the pencil enveloped inside. He knew there was minimal fear in his eyes, but how could he avoid it—him? He hated feeling like this: powerless. \"Hey! Dino! You deaf or something?\" The voice is closer and he feels the sweat slide along his face. He hates feeling below everyone, below someone along his level. He hates it. The fear asphyxiates him like his own suicide and the pencil is tighter in his hand. The tally's smile increases. Before he knows it, the pencil is engraved in someone's chest and he feels gooey, cold blood soaking through his fingers. He hadn't meant to hurt him. He never does. ll. Two. The pencil in his hand is larger this time, slim, round, and maroon. It's led is thick like the edge of his fingers. He holds it firmly, still anxious like before. His eyes move to the new wall; he's been moved from the previous room. Yet, the cement wall is heavily brimmed with chips, scrapes, and grime. He's still living in some kind of personal hell, except this time alone. The pencil is his only sense of sanity. He's slipping fast and noticeably, like quicksand. No one talks to him, most are scared of the death he's inflicted on his cell inmate. He hadn't meant to do it, but it happened. He had drawn a pencil to the chest and the blood coated the orange attire like paint. It was just a pencil, how did he do so much damage? How does Dino do so much damage with things he cannot control? It's been two years and he's in metaphoric and literal confinement. He just wants to talk to someone. He just wants a friend, a real friend. He's always wanted a friend. In his time outside, he had always been famous and popular. Everyone knew his name, cars, and story, but they never knew him. No one was willing to know him. He had grown, over time, quiet, irritable, and brooding. His friends were his cars and even then, the cars did not like him. The cars constantly failed him, making his work look unskilled, pathetic. The cars even got him in here, alone and insane. His other friends—feelings, thoughts, memories—were all in his head. He was friends with power, the one emotion that fed to his survival. It was this feeling that zapped him to life. He never ever felt empty, but he still felt alone. Power wasn't enough to fill his time, it was destructive. He did things that were illogical. He spent countless hours competing, when he was no good anyway. He wasn't talented, wasn't skilled, he used hate to fuel his energy, most of the time. It usually always worked, but it never made him talented. The pencil in his hand presses against the wall. He makes a still strange, crooked line. It slopes like a disapproving frown. He's still some kind of a disappointment. The tally looks back at him, almost offended at the way it's drawn. He needs to make it proud, he needs to make people proud of him again. When he was a child, no one cared of a soccer game unless he won. His parents attended every game and applauded each one with enthusiasm, but he could tell that he had done terribly. He made no goals, he couldn't even pass the ball accurately. Soccer was something he couldn't play with talent, but with skill he was sure. In response, he would practice three hours prior to soccer practice alone and two after. Many saw the result of this and soon came to see that he was working harder, but also exceeding expectations. His parents, eventually, saw the work he was placing on himself and their enthusiasm changed into pride; they were proud of him now. It only lasted a while, his hamstring tore; he suffered from an avulsion. He was forced to leave soccer, his thigh was no good and his parents were concerned and disappointed. No one cared of him after nor before, things would remain that way for a while. He didn't care though, he never liked soccer. He just wanted people to be proud of him, and they had been. He guesses in time that feeling fades. Dino breathes. His own sigh unfamiliar to him. \"Brewster! Here's your meal!\" He hears behind him and he almost winces at how loud it is. He's not used to hearing voices, no one talks to him. This is the first voice today that he's heard. It almost sounds pathetic at how much he's enjoying it and how painful it is to hear. He turns quickly, eyes guarded. He wants to say something, keep him talking, but he doesn't know what to say. The man doesn't even want to talk, he's just doing his job. No one wants to talk to him. \"You 'kay, Brewster?\" Dino softens at this, a marshmallow at best. He just wants someone to talk to him. \"Brewster?\" He never meant to stab the man. He just had to get out of there. No one else would ever be so nice to him to give him the chance. Dino thinks that's the greatest friend he's ever had. lll. Three. The man ended in the hospital with a minor injury. The pencil jab was weak, no harm done. People think that it was an attempt for more isolation, but it was just the opposite. Dino just wanted to go outside. The minute he stretched the pencil against the wall of cement. He hears a boom outside his confinement. \"Someone's here for you, Brewster.\" He takes a breath. His emotions, thoughts, feelings go haywire. He's been in confinement for two years and three months. It's nothing like he knows will come, but it's all he can take. He can't take this isolation, he can't take the fear people get when they look at him. All he wants is all he needs. His fingers tap cautiously on the pencil and for a moment he considers stabbing the man, but he figures it's best to see who's here. When he is lead to the telephone area—after trucking around fearful and apprehensive glances—he's seated across from a familiar range of eyes. They're green irises swirled with grey, and blonde hair that reminds him vaguely of the person who got him here. \"Hey, Dino.\" Tobey. What is he doing here? \"How are you?\" The blonde sits across from him, phone against his cheek. He wears a stoic gaze, with hardly any emotion and Dino feels disappointed. He feels disappointed, though gratitude slivers softly through his eyes. He can't help but feel some sense of childish, unusual gratitude. He hates how much power he has over him, how much control is hanging on the other man's thread. He's so tired of being pathetic. He swallows his spit and places the telephone against his ear. \"Great.\" He knows how he appears, the opposite of his stated appearance. His eyes are heavy, dark circles coated underneath. The once crimson colored skin has taken a pale turn and his cheeks are sharper than usual. He can actually see the indent of his hipbones and the strange way his skin tries to stretch over it. He hasn't remembered eating and he doesn't feel like it anyway. Tobey sighs. \"Dino. I'm not—they told me you were going insane, alright? I know what you did and I really don't give—I don't care.\" He stops, noticing Dino's brief change in expression. The brunette is offended, ashamed mostly, that they brought the person he hates, because he's losing sanity. \"I—I don't like you. I don't care about you. You killed Pete, you hit Anita, and you never even looked back.\" Dino's eyes fade softly, his expectations and gratitude reaches disappointment again. He knows he doesn't deserve it. He knows he's messed up anyway, but it still stings. The blond notices this. \"Dino, I just—don't hurt anyone.\" Tobey practically softens, his reply sounding almost like a plead. \"Don't do anything worse,\" he stops, his tongue clicking, \"to yourself. You're already 25 years locked in, don't mess this up.\" Dino breathes. The telephone enveloped in his hand. The once stoic gaze he held faded into a bitter, almost sour, malicious grimace. Tobey felt the regret sink in at his next words: \"I already have.\" \"Dino, I—\" It's the last of what he hears, the last of any hope that maybe someone cares. The reality is, no one does. The only who can and will is himself. Suddenly now, that's all he needs, that's enough. llll. Four. He sketches quickly, with no grace or fine movements, four. His skin is original to its color, his sharp cheekbones have fattened and his eyes show something other than disappointment: pride. He no longer needs anyone to hold him up, to talk to him. His sketch across the cement is perfect, without skill, without talent. He doesn't need anything to make him special, because practice makes perfect, so why not? He holds the pencil in his hand. His inmate nears slowly, not a trace of knowledge in his expression. He hardly knows that Dino plans to use him, just to get out of here and demonstrate how he's changed. He doesn't need people anymore; Dino's got his pride on a shelf that blocks emotions out. It's better this way, he knows, no one is ever going to care about him. He's completely fine with that. He's completely fine with the pencil struck into his inmates chest—though the blood coats his fingers and he feels cold, he feels nothing—it doesn't bother him. He strikes him repeatedly, his fists harder than the last. Dino just wishes his parents could see this. He's finally lost it; his sanity is gone. He wished he could blame the pencil tucked in his hand, but the hands wrapped around the orange utensil would be at fault as well. Therefore, he would be at fault and the pencil would extend it's sharp end at the one to blame. He has no one to blame and needs no one. In life, you have no one but yourself. When he's greeted by the sun of the sky—after he's escaped and a knife lays by his side—he laughs because all he truly needed for salvation was himself. He needed no one. No one was going to help him and now, nothing is going to curb his actions. Nothing stopped him before, he was a ticking time bomb and no one stopped him. They saw the beauty he was capable of, they saw the talent he was able to do. Now, his tallies have struck the time and now he'll finish what he has to do. The knife enters his stomach viciously, like tart lime squeezed on his wound, and the blood coats his fingers, but this time it feels warm. His fingers continually drape over the attire, over the blood and he jabs the knife repeatedly until he feels the pain enter like acid. It's never felt better. \"Brewster! Brewster!\" He hears, but his eyes close. Dino finally sleeps. The tally on the cement is a perfect line that resembles his heart beats once they rush into the hospital. His body lays stoic on the mattress and his heart refrains from beating. He's alive, but not alive. No one knows the damage of the strange puncture and doctors run to and fro from his hospital bed. If Dino were awake, he would be filled with disappointment and disgust, his plan did not work. Suicide with a pencil was hardly easy, many of the nurses and doctors were amused at this, after he was diagnosed with depression and early Borderline Personality disorder. It was only logical that they had thought so, he spent so much time injuring and aching for affection like a child that it made sense. He just wished they didn't send him to an asylum for the rest of his life. This wasn't the plan, not on his fourth year. He guesses that trusting himself was wrong in itself. He doesn't know even what trust is. The pencil was disguised as his soaking knife, he lied to Dino. He lied to him just like everyone else. lllll. Five. He cannot draw on cement anymore, he's not allowed pencils. It gets him angry at first, the urge to count his days, but then he remembers these walls are bleak and pale. It's nearly impossible to write on cushions as walls. It's nearly impossible to pretend that everything is going his way, that someone will understand that he just wants someone real. He's a psycho after all, they wouldn't give him a platter of food without feeding it to him knowing what he could do about it. He writes tallies in his head, straight, vertical. No one visits him, so it's nearly impossible to conclude anything, but he looks beyond the window every now and then. He counts the dawns and when the moon rises. He keeps his chin up and his eyes locked on the window sill that illuminates every so often. The days pass without him, the sun sets without him. He finds it hard to breathe through the white that he sees, but sometimes he imagines the blood that coated his fingers, and he feels better. \"Dino. Are you feeling alright today?\" The redhead, slim lady speaks and he just wishes he had a pencil. No, he doesn't feel great, he wants to see something else other than this room. He wants to see the sun, he wants to speak to someone who won't write everything he says down. His knuckles crack and he wrestles with the thought of killing her. Dino feels like seeing her blood coat her hair, just as it did to his fingers. The lady notices his silence. \"Dino?\" He turns from her and looks at the window. His hands are strapped inside of this jacket. Half of him wishes to bash her head against that window high above, the other wants to burn her alive. He doesn't know which, but he decides it's nearly impossible anyway since his hands always fail him. Dino smiles. \"I'm great.\" \"Right.\" She says, warm and high. Her edged nose extends at him, almost like calling him a ridiculous liar. He wearily looks at her eyes. She knows. \"Do you want to kill me, Dino?\" \"Yes, sometimes.\" He answers, no hesitance or restraint in his words. He doesn't like her and she probably doesn't like him. He has no problem with that. There's a genuine feeling of indifference when it comes to her. He pushes the issue further. \"Do you want to know how I want to kill you?\" \"Dino, that—\" \"I want to bash your head against that window.\" He said, eyes cold, almost like icy water condensed into a pair of irises. \"And watch the blood trickle on your forehead, because your hair is just so long and red. I really like red.\" She doesn't say anything, only nods almost habitually. Dino assumes that maybe she deals with the insane day after day, and her state might just be just as insane. He sees the way she gazes at her paper and pen, as if taunting him. His bright grin puckers into a scowl, and he turns away to the window behind him. The lady is just another one of those people, the ones he exploits and does so cleverly. \"I just want a pencil.\" He tries, his eyes crestfallen like a puppy. The pen in his view taps against the paper. He fixes his stature to appear small and worthless, just to coax her by using what she thinks is a weakness. \"I don't want to hurt you. I don't care about you. You're just doing you're job. I just want to tally the time.\" \"Just?\" She urges on, her eyebrows arching. \"Just.\" She clicks her tongue and leans forward to pat him almost generously. Dino smiles. It doesn't take long to injure her, and she's sent to the infirmary quickly. Her nose was broken and her eye was horribly bruised. The doctors say there is some harsh damage to the skull, but Dino hardly did any damage and he didn't want to anyway. It's not needed for him to kill, he's not gaining anything, nor priding himself on something. It's not necessary, though he's glad he's done dealing with her. He just finds himself alone again, just like the first time. He thought this really wouldn't bother him, but somehow, the feeling tugs at his stomach. He feels so empty, the isolation and solitude bothers him all over again. He's not enough for himself. llllll. Six. He uses the window set across from him to tally the sixth year. It almost feels like a while. They schedule appointments once a week to make sure there's progress, but there never really is. It usually ends with a death threat and Dino's vicious goodbye. He's made it this far without losing his already hanging pride. The blue ink drags across the pale walls of his mind, soft as a couch. It forms a perfect line that slopes, almost gracefully, down the wall. He smiles gleefully. The tally smiles back at him. \"Dino Brewster!\" He hears behind him, angry at just the sound. Can't they see that he is busy? His time is a ticking clock and no one is going to stop it for him. He jolts his head to the side, demonstrating that he's heard. They probably don't understand that it also means to be quick, but Dino remembers that their ignorance is the reason he's here. He's much more deranged than they think he is. \"Someone is here to visit you!\" He breathes. He isn't excited. He's not excited. Dino, you are not excited to kill , he tells himself. He can't kill everyone now, besides they'll never let him out if he's insane. \"God, Dino.\" Tobey? He turns around and his stomach drops. He hadn't expected to see him again. There was this notion that he could care less and Dino found the situation redundant. The blond was still carrying that stoic gaze, but something was different. His eyes carried something else: sympathy, concern? Dino could care less of that now. He had taken the time to get over his childish needs of affection and care. Tobey didn't need to look at him with those eyes. No one had to anymore, not the nurses, nor the auxiliaries, not even himself. He was done with that. He had grown up. \"I'm sorry.\" The blond muttered, his stance apprehensive. \"I'm sorry, Dino.\" \"I thought you weren't.\" He chuckled, his voice full of amusement. He saw no sense in this conversation. Tobey was full of fake pretenses and that would never change. \"Now that I'm insane I get sympathy? God, you are so full it.\" \"I saved your life, so you would see that there are people who aren't like you. I'm not like you. Pete wasn't like you—\" \"Jesus,\" he sighed, annoyance laced through his words, \"we get it. Pete died and it was because I'm capable of no feelings and emotions. I get it.\" \"No, you don't.\" He started, his determination locked into place. Dino could see he pulled the ignition on and did so stupidly. He didn't want to hear him scold and chastise him for suicide. It was his insanity to deal with, not Tobey's. Didn't he have that girl from England or something? He couldn't occupy his time with that? \"If you did, you wouldn't have attempted suicide like a depressed sixteen year old.\" \"Is that what makes you angry?\" He leaned forward, his eyes narrowed into slits. \"I was close to ruining your heroic success into some teenage story that just doesn't sum up? Did it ever occur to you that maybe something's just not right in my head? That maybe that's why I act like some nutcase, not because I'm looking for your imbecilic attempts at charity? I'm neurotic, Tobey, deal with it.\" Tobey's words were thwarted, flattened, and effaced. He had expected some ridiculous response, some cheap, illogical excuse, but what he got was worse. He had been given a reason to forgive, he had been given a reason to sympathize. Tobey was silenced, with not a word to say. He noticed that he had been just a little off, that he had held something against someone who could not control it. His tongue sat still in his mouth. Dino chuckled. This is the first time that Tobey doesn't bother. \"I'm sorry then—\" \"I don't want it—\" \"Well, you're gonna have to take it. I'm sorry and you're right, but,\" he stopped, his breath needed, as he stepped forward, \"I'm the only person you've got.\" \"Got?\" He grew tense, his back had moved from the wall. \"They say that I should visit twice a week to help—\" \"Wait a minute, what? You're not coming. You're not—I don't need you.\" Dino sputtered, his straitjacket bothering him as he felt himself stiff. He couldn't believe this was happening, he couldn't process that this was a result. He had head-butted a couple therapists and given them a black eye, and this is what he gets. It sounds almost unreasonable if you ask him. There were other things, other methods they could try, not this blond headed idiot. He couldn't stand watching that stoic gaze that he wore so tediously, it was like watching Nicholas Cage for three hours. Dino felt rage, it was soaring in his stomach like a ticking bomb. \"You injured fifteen therapists! I think you need any other than nothing.\" He stated, his words had abruptly cut his thinking process. There was silence. \"It wasn't fifteen therapists—\" \"Yeah, I'm just making it easier for you to eat—\" \"You mean sugarcoating?—\" \"Same thing! I'm just—you killed a guy!—\" \"I didn't kill anyone, you piece of sh—\" \"Oh, I'm the piece of s—?\" \"—must be some kind of Greek torture to have to deal with your idiocy day after day—\" \"—at least I didn't try and kill myself with a pencil—\" \"You should have.\" lllllll. Seven. He's allowed to carry pens in his hands now. The doctors and nurses are at shock at his behavioral changes. He doesn't headbutt nurses or therapists that enter his room. He doesn't threaten anyone or glare with vitriolic eyes. He behaves just as they want him to. They praise him and award him for his good behavior and Dino chuckles just at the thought. Solely for his smiles, good words, and willingness of silence interruption, everyone thinks he's on a good stance. He's actually allowed outside of the straitjacket, instead of only when with therapists, he's free for the longitude of his time. They're giving him a pen again and he smirks smug. All he has to do is behave. The tally written across his sweat glistened hand is straight, much like a stoic glare. Dino pretends this doesn't bother him. The tally isn't mad at him. It can't be. \"Dino Brewster! Visitor!\" He hears behind the white door inserted through the wall. His shoulder goes tense. He knows what this means—a familiar blond is at his door. Tobey's here for a visit and the dread fills him. Seven months in and he's still not used to seeing him day after day. They talk and speak, but the words pass by like scripts given to them by writers. Dino wants nothing to do with him and Tobey neither. They don't mash, they don't mix, and each time they clash, he's reassured of the notion. It could take them twelve years to actually speak without the awkward air efflorescing around them. It's like the more they talk, the more they feed that wall between them. Dino would just appreciate that they stop forcing him to speak to that brooding idiot. The boots behind the door, loud as they clomp towards it, only push his vexation forward. The only reason he's behaving is because of Tobey... Great. He gets it now. \"Hi.\" Tobey strides in, in all his plaid glory and Dino groans. Those damn green eyes are just about near to pushing Dino towards suicide again. He can't stand him, nor his vacant, yet smug glances. The blond stands in the middle of the bleak bedroom and says not a word after. He usually takes a step towards the seat across from Dino, but, today, he only stands. His attire consisting of the usual dark jeans, leather jacket amongst plaid sweater, and the famous brown boots. There's this unsettling look in his eye: happiness? Dino doesn't know, but he moves his gaze from the man and pretends he doesn't feel a little appreciative of the actual not somber look in the other man's eyes. It swirls a sick feeling in his stomach and Dino tries to remind himself to keep his pretenses, to remember to hate Tobey. He hates him. He's not his friend. \"I—I don't like you. I don't care about you. You killed Pete, you hit Anita, and you never even once looked back.\" Dino's eyes grow stoic again and the feeling of gratitude eventually fades. He repeats the words over and over in his head. They have engraved in his memory like words on a tombstone and it's enough to send him back to the icy stance he had held before. \"Uh, I've heard about your progress,\" Tobey smiles with a sense of falsity, \"it's—congratulations.\" \"It must make you feel successful on your charity case, no?\" Dino retorts, his eyes narrowed into acidic slits. Tobey immediately freezes. \"What's your problem?! I'm trying to work at this and you act like a pompous schizoid. I don't want to fight with you, Dino. I don't want revenge. I finished that a while ago. I just—I just—.\" He stops, taking a breath. His eyes brimmed with frustration and something alike disappointment. Disappointment? He's disappointed?! His disappointment and frustration means nothing to Dino. It means nothing compared to being insane, socially anxious and deprived of genuine emotions given to him. It isn't anything compared to the number of people he's injured, just because he wants someone to listen. He doesn't understand that for six years Dino is confused, angry, depressed, sad, and guilt ridden and he doesn't even know why. He doesn't know why the pain is still there, why he still needs someone to call a friend. He doesn't get why his freaking emotions and tallies are still not enough. Dino doesn't understand why he feels so alone and so empty, even though people are trying to fix him nevertheless. He doesn't get it. He doesn't get it! HE DOESN'T GET — \"Dino, you alright?\" He hears softly, like a snowflake to his ears. \"I'm sorry. This is just driving me crazy—\" \"YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO BE CRAZY!\" He screams, his throat stinging and eyes wet. \"You think I enjoy missing a freaking screw? You think I don't wish I could just stop hurting everyone!? You have no idea what the hell is going on in here.\" Dino shouts, as his finger presses into his head as a gesture. \"Dino—\" Tobey tries, his eyes crestfallen. \"GET OUT! GET OUT!\" Dino roars, his breath faltering as he does. Is that it? Is that all Tobey was going to say? He was going to pretend he understands and then be on his way? He's a piece of falsity and fake pretenses. Dino's tired of having to hold his regrets high and having to pretend that he doesn't care. He's tired of holding this load over his head and constantly having to accept the trash that people give him, Tobey gives him. He doesn't deserve that crap. He doesn't deserve anything and he knows that. He just wishes he didn't feel like he was sinking into a deep, shallow hole. He wishes he didn't feel like maybe he does deserve this trash anyway. Pete died, Anita has scars, and he almost killed the guy who continuously fed him. He almost killed... Tobey. He always does stupid things to feel better and it never works. He never feels better and no one ever feels better either. He's just a piece of cynical hostilities and neurotic defenses. The mere fact of his insanity is what makes it harder for him to listen to anything anyone says anymore. He's tired of not being worth it. \"I'm sorry, Dino.\" Tobey finishes, taking a step back towards the door. He fills his eyes with a void and nothing sputters out. Dino wipes his own, before the man takes a halt before the door. \"I thought I hated you at first, when I first came—the jail visit. But, I thought about how I keep coming back and doing all this ridiculous junk I thought I hated and I realized—\" \"What?\" Dino asks with a bite. \"I care about you a lot more than I let on.\" The door shuts before he can say anything back. llllllll. Eight. A year passes and Dino hears nothing from Tobey again. The tally on his palm makes him flinch. His skin as pale as real paper, he smiles at how things strangely connect. The dark circles under his eyes, the collarbone that protrudes his skin, the hair that shrouds his chin in tiny particles, these things remind him and continually make him ponder towards how long he's been in here. It all comes as a connective tendon or tissue, straining over weak, unused muscle, towards Tobey. It plugs him, clicks in his head, how he had some sort of a friend, but it never dawned on him until he left him here alone again...without a friend. His only friends being, once again, his emotions and those tallies he loves to draw so much. He looks back at the one in his hand, taking in its strange gaze...it's strange length. It's not smiling at him, or frowning, or disapproving him. It's just there. The tally written across his skin, staring back at him, is just there. For the first time, it isn't judging him. It isn't talking to him. It isn't alive. His heart sinks like it's drowning. He closes his fist and pretends that it's asleep. Tally never sleeps, but he doesn't think about it. He can't think about it. Who is going to talk to him? Who is going to accompany him when he just wants someone there? Who? Who would even do that for him anyway? He's a murderer, an insane criminal, someone who jabs you with a pencil just because he wants friends. Therefore, why would anyone waste their time on him, especially when he's killed, beaten, injured, traumatized, and pushed everyone out just for the sake of himself? Who does that? If he wanted a friend, he could have just asked! The pity and the guilt and anger was illogical, because he would have ended alone anyway. He did end alone anyway, his crappy way of handling things got him here alone again. All of those therapists could have been his friends. Anita could have been a friend. Tobey...Tobey could have, maybe, sometime in the great, great, great future, been his friend. Pete. Pete could have been his friend. Pete could have had many friends. Dino winces, his eyebrows close. There's an unusual sentiment coursing through him, strange and peculiar to his senses, but he takes it in. He lets the urge of apology ride through his head, roll off his tongue. \"I'm sorry. Pete.\" It doesn't feel like much, and really it's not, but it makes him proud of himself. Not proud because he's done good in apologizing, not proud because he's had an epiphany, but proud, because he's done being contemptible. He's done being stupid on his actions. He's done hurting other people, because they're ignorant and they don't understand. He finds that the most change he had gotten was when Tobey was around and in return, all he did was scream at him for his held in emotions bottled up. It makes him sound like a rampaging adolescent, and to much of his dismay, that's what he was. He was a rampaging adolescent. His actions, however angry he was, never grew to help him over the course of the eight years in here. All of his actions and suicide attempts and angry threats and isolation, they all became some kind of personal punishment for how self-interested he was. The logical, less egotistical side of thinking in his head was the only one who saved him from utter chaos after he killed Pete. He knew he kept the car for something. Dino smiles. He kept the red car, unbeknownst to his ego, to get caught and save himself. lllllllll. Nine. Months pass and Dino feels different. His eyes radiate, from what the nurses say, with something other than despondency and vacancy. He holds something else in them that reflect against the mirror. He doesn't know what it is nor how it's supposed to feel, but it sure as hell gives him some relief. The reflection that stares back at him is a good one. It's fuller, the color back in its skin, the circles beneath his eyes pink. He doesn't see the prominent cheekbones anymore, poking out like a decaying corpse. He sees lighter eyes and a familiar smile. He sees a thicker jaw without hair cladding heavily across and scary, ominous bones protruding his skin. He sees himself and only himself. There aren't any tallies, or fuzzy emotions blocking his head—mostly because of the current medication, but nevertheless that. Dino sees something familiar, he recognizes something familiar. He sees the kid he was before he even knew what soccer was. He sees his best friend. Dino. Not Dino Brewster. Not the one who sells cars or plays soccer. Not the one who bullied kids in his class. Not any of that—all of everything that was wrong with him. Dino. Just Dino. It sounds like some kind of progress, a lot actually. Yet, Dino still feels far from fixed. There are days that he feels like he can't trust anyone, like someone, anyone hates him for just what he's done, judges him for what he did to everyone. Mornings where he just hates himself and wishes he could just stop breathing one day. He wishes he could be someone else, he wishes he wasn't Dino—someone better and brighter. If the day is extremely bad, then he's probably tried to bash his head open against the walls—even though the thought is impossible with the architectural design. He gets angry and irritated, and just finally cries with exhaustion of it all. Dino finally grows tired with himself and who he is, all his mistakes, all of his ridiculous flaws. If not, the moments avert to where he wants to watch the blood trickle on someone, just anyone. He threatens them, aching for just someone to burst their head open for him. He wants to see blood. Blood. Blood. It all plays and rolls like a blurred movie behind his eyes, flickering violently. He's far from fixed. Yet, sometimes, on some rare days, he feels like this—good. He feels okay and normal and far from anything that's happened in the last few days. There isn't a violent, self-inflicting thought he's had. He just feels good. Those days are the good ones, those are the ones he hopes for, the lack of thoughts in his head pounding ferociously are the best of days. He doesn't skip or smile, but he also doesn't cry. He also doesn't want to stab himself with a fork or impale himself in the gut with glass. Therefore, they let him go outside. His nurse believes him to be healthy enough now. The sun is blinding, but beautiful. It flashes in the sky amongst the cotton clouds, backdropped by a blue he hasn't seen in a while. Being in his room, the only time he sees the sky is through a small window. It taunts him on his bad days, laughing at him, but he doesn't think of it now. He stares at the blue blue sky and the perfect clouds that shape up above. The light of the day reflects against the grass, almost like shiny spikes on someone's head. It almost resembles his head, just that makes him laugh. Dino almost forgets that all years ago, these things bothered him. He hated the sun, the grass, the clouds, the sky. Now, he stares amongst the vibrant grass and sees the water drops still glisten on the tiny strands of vegetation. He absolutely revels in the sun. Everything about the world outside makes him feel good. He doesn't think he likes only getting thirty minutes outside. Dino sits back on the red bench. The breeze hits against his face, softly, almost cold. He sucks his cheek a little—a habit he lost in middle school. It always helped him heat up and was just a fun little feeling. His parents told him to stop it though, despite the personal enjoyment he took in it, they believed the habit to sound annoying, vexing. Dino never really cared. He still doesn't. As the cold wind sweeps across his face like a refreshing shower, he takes the time to internalize everything. Eight years and nine months have passed. He's still crazy and still brooding, but he's different. He's not a complete monster. \"You're really thinking.\" He hears a familiar voice, a woman. It's vague, because he hardly remembers, but it's there in the back of his brain. Someone. He tilts his eyes to greet black stilettos and then they greet her tight black dress. It's something different to see someone and he doesn't expect much, but he's surprised to see it's her. Pale skin, black hair, eyes that droop like rain—Anita. Why is she here? \"What are you doing here?\" He asks, shock and happiness all at once. He wasn't expecting her to visit, ever. He knew what he had done to her. He always does. The memories never leave him on his bad days. Dino's irises flash transparently, his emotions shine through. \"You really shouldn't be here.\" \"Your eyes say different.\" She says amusedly, her finger gestured at his eyes. She was always so clever. \"How are you?\" \"I'm...great.\" He replies, mostly unsure of how to describe his status at the moment. The dictionary never had enough words for him, even when he was small and all he ever did was talk with words too big for his little head. \"How are you?\" Dino looks at her. Her eyes swirling with patience. Her mouth curled into a lazy smile. She looks happy, beautiful, everything she wasn't with him. He gets slightly warm at just the feeling. The girl was never happy this way with him, she never would be. He was crazy, neurotic and even now, better off alone. He hit her if she ever made him feel anything less of the best. His words were even worse if she ever let him know he wasn't. Something told him he should have seen that insanity earlier on, but it was too late to contemplate. Watching her now, she was coruscating, better than he ever was. Her hair was shorter and shiny across her chest, wavy and curled like a haywire tally. He drifted his eyes downward and noticed her small tattoo engraved on her pinky. He doesn't ask, because he doesn't really care. She wouldn't answer anyway. \"I'm good.\" She nods. \"Okay.\" He nods as well. Anita notices quickly of the depleting conversation and just starts for what she has come for. He knows that it wasn't him. There was hardly anything here, especially since he killed her brother— especially that . \"Um, Tobey wanted me to check on you. He wanted to see if you were okay.\" He sighs heavily, regretting his senseless curiosity. \"Oh.\" \"Dino, he really cares about you—for some reason! He was curious about your condition as of the moment and I was,\" she clicked her tongue frustratingly, \"too.\" \"Oh.\" He said again, hardly sure of how to react at the moment. He was never good at feelings and all that, especially with someone he couldn't admit he missed. It was just degrading to himself and his ego and he wouldn't speak of it. \"I don't—this doesn't mean anything. I'm with someone.\" She quickly quipped, turning her eyes from him. Her hands settled on her lap. \"Okay.\" \"You should call Tobey. He really wants to talk to you and—\" \"Why?\" Dino slices, his response like acid. \"I'm not his friend. I'll never be his friend. I don't see why Tobey cares! I was here and he never called and!—\" \"He called every two weeks for you!\" She stopped him, her words like quick fire. There was a certain annoyance in her eyes, that flashed irritatingly at him. It was a gesture that spread throughout her like a pathogen, she was angry and she could not control it. He didn't know what she was so mad about though. Tobey hardly called, he hardly came in, and it's been a year since he has. There was no hint that they ever became friends. They hardly spoke like friends. Abruptly, her voice halted his thoughts. \"He couldn't talk to you, because you didn't want him to. He couldn't talk to you, because he wasn't so sure he cared—he was scared to sympathize for you. But, he cared, he's cared ever since you got sent here, because he just can't help caring about people. He just can't help that he cares, Dino.\" \"How did you know?\" \"What?\" She questioned, frazzled. \"How did you know that I didn't want him to? What if I did?\" Dino mumbled, holding his eyes to the straight, perfected grass. His irises were glassy to the girl beside him, whilst the thoughts in his head bounced like a rapacious earthquake. He needed to go back inside. He didn't know how to feel about all of this. His violent and self-inflicting thoughts were spiraling and it was hurting him. \"What if I just needed one call? What if I just needed someone? What if—I can't—I can't breathe. I can't breathe! I have to go.\" \"Dino. Dino, are you okay?\" His thoughts were racing like a collision of cars. He needed to get out of there. He needed to get this thoughts together. He needed. He needed space. The moment he stumbled off the bench, his feet moved instinctively. And he ran. llllllllll. Ten. It takes ten minutes for the nurses to find him shrouded in a corner behind the building. His knees tucked against his chest, hands clasped in his hair. He looked frantic, tears smeared across his face and his once pale cheeks reddened from the moments he constantly rubbed his face. Most of the nurses don't say anything, their worry for the man intensive. They believe him to be unwell; he's not responding and he seems to be stuck in his head, murmuring to himself with a vacant gaze. They calculate that his head is trying to cope with the recent news and it's not major, but it's \"imperative\" that no one visits him for a while. He could be dangerous and his long history of injuries make him infamous. Fifteen therapists, three cell mates, five doctors, and several uncounted for victims have him listed down as unsafe. It, his mental instability, is also the reason he might be locked in a mental hospital for the rest of his life. Ten minutes and they've calculated as much as the jury can in two months. Tobey sighs. His back resting in his chair, he feels his leather jacket heavy on his shoulders. He feels so damn sympathetic for the guy. It almost hurts, no bothers him, like it stung him that he wasn't in jail. Now it does, now Tobey doesn't want him to be in or out. He doesn't want him to be like this, but he doesn't want him free, innocent. He really just wants to not feel guilty and pretend that Dino is some sort of psycho by choice. Everything was so much easier to deal with when he was okay and not crazy. He knew which side was black and which was white. He understood that the antagonist, the real bad guy, was the one who was home free in his ridiculous mansion. Now, Tobey is questioning what's good and what's bad. Along all of those thoughts, he rolls in that Dino's not bad, but he's not good, and for some reason, it's by default, not be choice. He scratches his head every now and then thinking about it, but it's befuddling. Dino's so damn befuddling. It's not even that either, it's that little gap of humanity he sees in his eyes every now and then. He sees it—the human—in him when he arrives early on Wednesdays and Sundays, or used to. He would see it in his eyes, like little marbles of transparent glass, that he was angry. The man was angry, but only because he was excited that someone was here. He was excited that someone cared, genuinely. It would fix in his eyes like tiny swirls of different transparencies, but that was the one he wore the most: excitement. Tobey liked to call it the crusade, mostly because he hardly knew how to explain the different feelings through his eyes, but he knew it was a crusade of emotions. There was anger, irritation, excitement, vulnerability, fear, ache, but most of all, happiness. Happiness would radiate his cheeks like embarrassing frosting left from eating cake or something, and it would leave Tobey feeling so...good? He'd feel guilty, sympathetic, but most importantly, good. It was the reason he'd grown to care about someone he shouldn't have and it was like a lethal, life-threatening disease that made him soft and...caring. He didn't like that. \"He's really unwell. I don't think it's safe for you to come in.\" Except, sometimes, it made him feel like lying in the grey area of good and bad was okay. The first time he saw him, back about three years ago, he hated looking at him. He wanted nothing to do with him and he felt like a traitor to Pete just doing so. His own thoughts were meddling and he couldn't agree towards any sympathy. But, he felt it. He felt sympathy. He felt some kind of curiosity. He wanted to know what would happen to Dino, he wanted to know what was going on with Dino. It was the moment he realized he already cared all too much of a murderer, but it hardly mattered, because it was already happening and he was already caring. He had already cared about Dino. It happens too fast with him. He finds himself enveloped in other people's lives way too fast. It happened with Julia, Pete, Anita, the boys and now... Dino . He's invested in Dino. He's too concerned on Dino. It shocks him, merely because he swore he would never set eyes or even save his damn life again, but it surprises him because that's just what he's doing. He's saving Dino's life and he doesn't feel so bad. He doesn't feel so amazing either, but mostly, he doesn't feel so bad. It makes him feel okay, maybe even a little fulfilling, just because he likes having him for company. Yes. He does. There are moments when Tobey realizes there could be friendship, and it sounds so hopeful and so stupid, but then Dino closes himself like a trap door. He manages to disappoint Tobey and disappoint him in a way he doesn't even like—right on Pete. He disappoints him and gives him so many damn reasons to stop saving his life. Yet, he does. Yet, he wants to. He doesn't know how to make sense of things, make sense of himself. \"Sir, I think you shouldn't stay here. Dino will not—can't—take any visitors.\" He hears above him like a gentle nudge. It's a brunette with a pale white dress on. She seems to be urging for him to leave. For some reason, he just can't. \"When will he be well again?\" Tobey asks, his voice raspy from the months of colds and fevers he's had. His eyes are almost shaped like tired sideway teardrops. \"Well, we really don't know.\" She tells him, trying to be as giving and honest as she can. Her blue irises stared intently at the man. He felt like he was being calculated and checked up for some kind of disease right along with insanity just for all of this mess he's placed himself in. \"Dino's a very delicate case. His mind is like that of a young child. It's not sure how to take in too much information without his own analysis first. Usually it's to make sense of things, but for Dino, it's just to make sure he's protecting himself from what might be disappointment or embarrassment and altering it to prepare his neurotic defense mechanism.\" \"Oh.\" Tobey said, already feeling sympathy again for someone he supposedly doesn't like. \"Is there even a way to just...help him? \"Therapy, medications, but most importantly,\" she flashed her eyes coyly, \"you.\" He wasn't even going to ask about it. He knew that he was already big help, so it was something that he would probably shrug his shoulders to. Tell me something I don't know. He kind of wished Dino understood that though, that he's just trying to help him because he needs to—because maybe he wants to. \"So, are you staying this evening?\" She taps her feet knowingly, waiting for him to talk. \"Maybe. I think I'll just call later if I don't.\" lllllllllll. Eleven. Dino wakes just before the sun rolls up. He's confused, tired, and already angry. Most of what happened yesterday is a blur, he hardly remembers a thing. He just knows that someone made him cry like some pathetic loser and now he's here again, locked in the bed, in a ridiculous straitjacket. It happens so often that maybe he's just mad that it's today, that he thought he was making some damn progress and he never seems to. He never seems to be good enough for himself and maybe as time comes and days change, one day he will, but today he feels like a disappointment. They let him go, just a while after his checkup though. \"You look to be all set. Do you feel okay?\" It sounds like a simple question, but it isn't. He only feels okay on the good days, and he already knows that today is not a good day. He already knows she'll have to come in and strap him down just to keep himself sane, but he feels bad just telling her so. They struggle so much just to accommodate him and get him feeling good and well and everything someone is supposed to feel. He never feels that way though, so he just shrugs in her eyes, all small and weak. He can't do much else, because that seems to be out of his actual control. She presses a hand on his shoulder and smiles like the sun. Her blue eyes that resemble the skies flash at him. \"You've been doing amazing so far. Just, just hold up for a little while.\" Dino curls his lip upward. \"I'm trying.\" \"Good.\" She says, closing her teeth into a warm smile instead. \"That's all you need to do.\" He smiles, much to his dislike of it, and she lets him out. He doesn't notice much when he's walking out of the room, or remember anything. His body is soft, weak, and it pads against the floor like a mop. There isn't much on his mind other than sleep, but he assumes that's why he forgets as much as he does in the morning. If he wouldn't be such a lost sleep cause, he would probably be himself, a better himself he means. He slings his head to the floor, lethargic, and tries to remember exactly where he was supposed to be walking. Most of the nurses and doctors extended their hands at him like old friends he's taken upon hurting or something. He only sees it just as he shuffles his way to the corner, right in front of the office doors—Tobey. Everything hits him like a soft hit on the head with a pillow. Anita, feelings, Tobey, he cares, I was wrong, I was wrong? Dino narrows his eyes into slits. His feet remained on the same floor and he made no gesture he was going to move. He wouldn't do that to himself or Tobey, he knew that it would be better if he just decided on talking later. It was already embarrassing to be barefoot in a mental hospital and now with no sensation in his fingers and an almost stupid way to act yesterday, he's pushing it. Suddenly, Tobey turns. He had been wearing one of those infamous leather jackets. His tired eyes easing into a soft gaze. It's like he already knew, like he already feels bad. Well, of course he does. Those nurses, they tell him everything. Every time he comes back, there's something else he has to feel bad about, whether it's the psycho's tendency to cry or his tendency to snap at people like it's okay to be that defensive. It's hesitant, but Dino realizes then that it's even more awkward now if he leaves without talking. He can't pretend he didn't see him when he did, can't pretend he hadn't been watching him. Therefore, he walks slowly, carefully over to the blond, and holds his chest up. He's not a kid, he's not an adolescent. He's Dino. Not Dino Brewster. Just Dino. \"I'm sorry.\" He stifles out, still standing before Tobey. It sounds weird, especially out of him, but then he remembers Anita yesterday. He also remembers the nurse telling him that a friend had been waiting and he knew no one other than Tobey. It was like he just didn't want Tobey sometimes, with the obvious gestures here and there, and at first he didn't, but he realized who else could he want as a friend? Who else would even consider him visit worthy? Anita had only come to fill in his spot and even then she hadn't really enjoyed herself. He been purposely blinding himself so long to a friend he had already had. \"You were right.\" It sounds so ridiculously weird. He tries to settle in comfort, but it doesn't come. Instead, Tobey talks, his words with caution. \"Yeah, I know.\" Strangely, he doesn't anger himself at that. He laughs. His grin strange to his own face. He hasn't done that in years. There were a couple of moments that he could have doubled over in laughter, but he never knew how to. He never even knew he could feel. He never knew he could feel amusement just like everybody else, and now as the feeling runs through him like a soft shock, he smiles even wider. The words like gratitude on his tongue, he speaks softly. \"You didn't have to be here.\" \"I—I know.\" He shrugs. \"Okay.\" He decides on, taking a seat in the blue chair next to him. It was apprehensive, and made him feel anxiety, being this close to someone he's still just slightly guarded about. It wasn't going to be easy, but he remembered about Anita. He remembered about the nurse. He remembered about the cell mates he had. He remembered about the prison guard. It all snook back into him, to just trying, like the nurse told him. It wouldn't hurt to try, because it all stung more to lose someone permanently than to try. \"You didn't have to talk to me.\" Tobey adds, a smile etched into his face. \"I know.\" He copied, taking his eyes far away from the man beside him. He looked beyond the streaming halls, beyond the streaming doors. There were so many of his nurses, yet he hardly realized that he hadn't ever taken upon talking to them, not like Tobey. \"Okay.\" Tobey mocked, as he chuckled just at the gesture. Throughout the laughter, Dino never realized he hadn't tallied today. He had forgotten to draw the straight line across the palm of his hand. He had forgotten to count the days that stream. He had forgotten his supposed friend. If the tally would have been alive, it would have frowned. Glancing at the man who would have held him in his palm, finally in progress, it would have frowned in jealousy. However, the emotion would have been brief, Dino thinks, maybe the stupid slope would have smiled after. Maybe he would have been proud of him, not because he succeeded or he because he had won, but because he had a friend now. The tally would have finally smiled at him, because he wouldn't be the only one doing so, he wouldn't be his only friend. And, Dino, Dino would be okay. AN: I hope you guys enjoyed this. I really did, well enjoy writing it, I mean. Every time I write, I build some sort of a connection with the characters, which is why I wrote 10k of just pure Dino. I really loved his character and the potential they gave him, despite how messy the story and film really is. Also, I couldn't help inserting Tobey/Dino. I just love the idea of that friendship more than anything―two stubborn, brooding guys who refuse to be friends. It's amusing and inevitable, because the understanding is just there. Also, I felt like there was unresolved tensions in the movie between them. ","Summary":" AN: This story literally took me a whole month to write.

I haven't written in a while, I'm writing a Twilight fic right now. I'm here and writing a Jump In! fic, and I think this is the second one up, so I'm proud of myself. Anyway, have fun, and review me!! This story starts in August of 2006rnWe're going to say that Izzy is going to be 17. Izzy Daniels stood at his window, watching the new girl put her things in Mary's old room. Ever since Mary had moved three months ago in late May, he had been really lonely and longed for a person his age to talk to. He didn't expect the person to be a girl, be living in Mary's old room, or be a dancer. He didn't know what he was expecting. He guessed he wanted another Mary. The girl caught him staring. \"Hey!\" she called, smiling. \"What's up?\" \"Nothing.\" She looked at her surroundings, then said. \"Come on up and introduce yourself.\" Izzy thought about it, then took her offer, and climbed up the ladder. She sat on the stairs and smiled at him, waiting expectantly. Izzy sighed and said, \"I'm Isadore Daniels, but you can call me Izzy.\" He stuck his hand out for her to shake. She took it as he admired the milky color of her skin against his and as she replied, \"Annabeth Montgomery, but you can call me Anna. Nice to meet you, Izzy.\" \"Same to you, Anna,\" he told her. Her emerald eyes danced as she smiled that million-watt smile that he didn't clearly see before again. \"So, what do you do for fun around here?\" \"I double-dutch. Or I used to before the girl that used to live here moved. I box, too.\" He told her easily. \"Double-dutch?\" she questioned. \"I used to double-dutch when I was younger, but I stopped when I became more addicted to dancing.\" \"How long have you been dancing?\" he asked her. \"Since I was three,\" she said. \"I'm almost seventeen now.\" \"That's a long time,\" Izzy said, surprised that someone could stick with something for close to fourteen years. \"Yeah, it is,\" Anna agreed. She looked as if she were about to say something else when her mom called, \"Annabeth Marie Chase Montgomery! Get in your room and finish unpacking!\" Anna turned pink as she turned towards her door. \"Gimme a second, Mom, I'm introducing myself to the neighbors!\" \"You can introduce yourself at the housewarming party tomorrow. Get your butt in here, Annabeth!\" her mother sounded bored, like she had to tell her daughter this repeatedly all the time. \"All right! I'm coming!\" she yelled to her mother. \"Hey, come to the housewarming party tomorrow, kay? I'm gonna need someone to talk to. Bring your family and friends too.\" \"That'll be five of us, I think, is that okay?\" Izzy asked. \"Yeah, it's totally cool,\" she replied as she got off the steps and walked back toward her room. \"See you tomorrow, Izzy.\" \"Yeah...\" he said, distracted. \"Bye, Anna,\" he smiled. She smiled at him one last time, and went inside. End of Chapter 1[Chapter 2] Chapter 2 Izzy, Karin, and Kenneth walked up to the Montgomery house, and knocked. Anna opened the door and smiled politely. \"Hey, Izzy,\" she greeted. \"Is this your family?\" \"Yeah,\" Izzy said. \"This is my dad, Kenneth, and my little sister, Karin. Dad, Karin, this is Annabeth Montgomery.\" \"Please, call me Anna. Nice to meet you Mr. Daniels and Karin.\" \"It's nice to meet you, too, Anna,\" Kenneth said to Anna. Just then Anna's mom walked out to the foyer. \"Mom, this is Kenneth, Izzy, and Karin Daniels. This is my mother, Julia Montgomery.\" \"Hello, it's nice to know that Annabeth has been making new friends.\" Julia smiled the same million watt smile that Anna had. Anna cringed at her full name. \"Do you guys wanna see the upstairs?\" Anna asked Izzy and Karin as Kenneth went to converse with the other adults there. \"No, thanks,\" Karin said as she had just saw some of her friends. \"Sure,\" Izzy said. He didn't see anyone else his own age, and if Anna were to be his neighbor, he wanted to get to know her better. They walked up to Anna's room, which was weird considering Izzy had been in the room a thousand times. But he couldn't recognize it. Instead of being a bright sunshine yellow color, the walls were a dark purple color with splashes of orange, black, pink, yellow, and blue. Her name was painted in white on a section of the walls that had obviously been painted the same color green as her eyes to differentiate the room and make it seem more her personality. Ballet awards were spread on one section of the walls, with pictures of Anna in the different costumes, her smile the same one Izzy knew, and her flaming red hair up. Her bright eyes smiled along with her mouth, even when she was only three. At the top of the ballet wall was her latest ballet picture and award. It was clear that she had been the prima ballerina for a while. \"Third year being the prima,\" she said as if she were reading his thoughts. On another wall were different pictures and collages. Of celebrities, people, friends, family. He recognized her mother with her arm around a man that he didn't know. Anna had the man's face shape and facial features, only softer, as well as the emerald green eyes that Izzy had to admit, were mesmerizing. \"Your dad?\" he asked her. \"Yeah, but he passed away a few months ago. That's why we moved.\" \"Too many memories.\" Izzy said. It wasn't a question. \"Yeah,\" Anna agreed. \"Too many memories.\" Izzy never remembered clicking with someone so quickly. Even though Mary had been able to relate to the pain of losing a parent, it wasn't the same way. Her parents had just gotten divorced. Her dad didn't get cancer and die on her bed as she tried to call 911 like his mother had. But they never brought that up. \"Cancer. It's the worst six-letter word in the dictionary.\" Anna was saying, too quietly to mean him. \"Yeah, I know.\" he said, unthinking. \"Do you?\" she asked. \"Do you know what it's like to have your father in your arms, and have him crumple against you as your mother calls 911?\" she said. \"Kinda, only my mother collapsed onto my bed and I was the one that had to call 911,\" Izzy told her. She looked up at him in disbelief. \"It's amazing how much we have in common, well family wise. One parent, two kids, the parent lost to cancer, wow.\" \"You have a sibling?\" he asked. \"My brother,\" she said. \"He's twelve, and he's decided to go to bording school. He couldn't deal with the passing of our dad. It was too painful for him to handle.\" She sighed deeply. \"I can't blame him. It was either move to a new state, or go to a bording school in the same state where we were.\" \"Where did you move from?\" he asked, realizing he didn't know. \"Colorado,\" she replied simply. \"Must be a different setting in New York,\" Izzy said. \"We only moved here because relatives live here. And my dad used to live here, so we decided to come back.\" she sounded worn down from the subject. \"Anyway, when's your birthday?\" He was startled by the abrupt subject change, and without thinking, said, \"February 21. I'll be 17.\" She nodded. \"Mine's March 7, I'l be 17, as well.\" \"I know, you said you'd be 17 soon earlier.\" Izzy said. \"Did I?\" she seemed confused. \"It must be from the paint fumes,\" Anna muttered so quietly Izzy couldn't hear her.. \"I've been forgetting little things all the time lately. I bet it's cause we just painted the room.\" \"Oh,\" Izzy said. They went on to talk about various things, and discovered that they had a lot more in common than just their families, but a lot that was different to talk about. They talked until it was after dark and Kenneth came up to get Izzy to go home. \"Okay, Dad,\" Izzy said as he picked himself up off the floor. \"Lemme just say goodbye.\" Kenneth went downstairs as Izzy looked at Anna. \"Bye, Anna, I'll see you tomorrow,\" he said so his dad could hear. Then he whispered to Anna, \"If you ever need me just call my name from the balcony. I'll be able to hear.\" He smiled at her as he left the room. Anna went out to her balcony and waited while the window opened. \"Hey, Izzy,\" she called. \"Yeah?\" \"Goodnight.\" She could hear the smile as he said, \"Goodnight, Anna.\" End of Chapter 2[Chapter 3] Chapter 3 Anna liked her new neighborhood and the people in it. She walked around all the time and watched as kids danced, double-dutched, and just messed around. Most of the time, she was in her dance studio a few blocks away, practicing her heart out. She went to Juliard, the performing arts school in Queens. She got home later than everyone else in the neighborhood, and often saw Karin double-dutching with her friends, with Izzy supervising. Sometimes she joined them and sometimes she didn't. But Anna was constantly dancing. Even watching as her neighbors double-dutched, she would dance around them, practicing. Karin thought it was awesome and cool. Izzy called her \"Ballet Girl,\" and she called him the \"Double-Dutch King.\" He showed her all of his moves, and taught her how to speed jump. Anna showed him all the things she had learned in the thirteen years that she had been training, and proved her outstanding endurance as well as stamina. They went for runs together, went to the gym together. He went to her school performances, and she went to his double-dutching competitions. They spent almost every free minute together, and soon it was rumored that they were dating. Before Anna or Izzy knew it, four months had flown bye, and it was Christmas. Anna and Julia spent most of the day with family members, but they had Christmas dinner with Izzy's family. Anna and Izzy were both stressing out because of what they got for each other on Christmas Day. Anna gave Izzy his present first, and when he opened it, he gasped in surprise. It was a DVD and book, detailing new tricks to learn in double-dutching. \"Thanks, Anna,\" he said, enveloping her in a hug. \"This is awesome.\" \"Glad you think so,\" Anna million-watted back. Then Izzy got Anna's present from his room. She opened the present delicately and held back tears. \"Wow, Izzy, this is-- it's amazing. Thank you,\" she managed to choke out. It was another collage for her wall. Pictures of her, Izzy, Karin, Shauna, Mr. Daniels, her mom, and several other people littered the photographs. Pictures from her school productions, dressed in blonde wigs, brown haired wigs, black wigs, and her flaming hair, released and free, blowing in the wind were on it. And not to mention pictures of her cousins, grandparents, and dad. She threw herself in his waiting arms, and smiled at him. \"This means a lot to me,\" she told him. Karin started giggling uncontrollably. \"What?\" Izzy and Anna asked at the same time. \"Mistletoe,\" she giggled out. Anna turned pink, and Izzy lowered his eyes. \"Come on, Izzy, it's tradition,\" Kenneth told his son. Julia smiled at Anna, \"Come on, sweetie.\" Anna blushed as Izzy kissed her on the cheek. \"There, you happy?\" she asked. \"No,\" Julia said. \"On the lips, Izzy. That's what mistletoe represents. Lips.\" \"No, it doesn't.\" Anna shot back. \"Yes it does.\" \"Doesn't.\" \"Does.\" \"Doesn't.\" \"Does.\" \"Doesn't.\" \"Does.\" \"I'll just do it, okay?\" Izzy said, trying to break up the brewing fight. And he pressed his lips gently to Anna's own. Everyone's eyes widened in shock, and then Anna's eyes closed as she kissed back gently. A few seconds later, they broke the kiss at the same time, and smiled at each other. \"Awwwww,\" Julia and Karin cooed, as Kenneth smiled at them. \"Shut up!\" the two shouted as one. A few minutes later, Izzy and Anna were excused, and they left the house, watching falling snow. \"So, what does this mean?\" Anna asked. \"Like, where our relationship is? I dunno,\" Izzy replied. Anna couldn't look up at him after he said 'relationship.' Izzy was thinking about what he wanted, but he didn't want it to be weird. \"Do you wanna go out on Saturday? Like to a movie or something?\" \"Like a date?\" Anna asked. \"Yeah,\" Izzy admitted. \"Sure,\" Anna said. \"But I haven't really dated anyone before, so it's a little uncommon for me.\" \"Yeah, this would only be the second girl I've ever gone out with,\" Izzy told her. \"Yeah, well, Saturday sounds good. Do you wanna hang out on New Year's, too?\" Anna asked. \"Of course. We're going to Shauna's New Year's Eve party, right?\" \"I am, is it okay with your dad?\" Anna said to him. \"Yeah, it's fine with my dad.\" Izzy assured her. \"So, I guess we better get back,\" Anna suggested. \"Yeah, I guess we better.\" Izzy said. They were making the five minute walk back when in front of their block, Izzy suddenly grasped Anna gently by the shoulders and kissed her. Anna responded, and the two stayed out, not caring that people were muttering about that jump rope boy and dancer of different races kissing. It didn't matter. It was new love. End of Chapter 3[Chapter 4] Chapter 4 It was now the year 2008, and Izzy and Anna were still going strong for any couple. They had been together for over a year. They were going to be 18 that year, they were seniors in high school, and were happy together. Sometimes they got taunted, but most of the time, the neighbors respected the teenagers choice in companionship and most figured it would be over soon, saying how they remembered their first loves. But Izzy and Anna really had something good. Something different than anyone had ever expected. And they were both loving what they had. They still did their individual activities, they didn't stifle each other. The limiting time they had together made it even more special than it already was to them. Double dutch was now taking a huge part of Izzy's already busy life. The competition for city was coming up, then hopefully state. Anna had volunteered to be the Hot Chille Steppers fourth until they found someone, hopefully someone that could dedicate a lot of time to the team. Izzy was grateful for Anna's volunteering, it meant that she didn't have as much time to practice ballet, and she was doing it for him. Then came the day of Mary's return. \"Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow,\" Annabeth moaned as Izzy helped her up. She had been speed jumping again, and then had tried to learn how to transfer from that to hopping on one leg. She had gotten tangled, and tripped, hurting her ankle more than she expected to. Izzy gathered her in his arms, and kissed her lips gently. \"You gonna be all right?\" \"Of course, I only twisted it. I'll be fine in a little while. But maybe I should wait until tomorrow to try that again,\" she replied. Anna kissed him back and Izzy carried her to a nearby bench, where they sat for about five minutes before they heard a voice. \"Aww, dancer can't jump some rope?\" Izzy and Anna looked up in surprise. \"Mary?\" he said incredously. \"Yeah, it's me. Izzy, I missed you so much!\" She threw her arms around him and kissed him on the lips briefly. Anna got up from the bench and started walking to her house. \"Anna! You can't walk on that, you could really injure your ankle!\" Izzy excalimed, extremely concerned. \"I don't care. Leave me alone, Isadore Daniels.\" \"Anna...\"Izzy began. \"Don't you 'Anna' me! You cheated on me, Izzy! I don't ever want to speak to you again!\" And she huffed back to her house, limping all the way there. \"What was she talking about, Izzy?\" Mary asked. Izzy took a deep breath. \" I was dating Anna, for over a year this past Christmas. You moved close to two years ago, Mary. And after you didn't visit in seven months, I moved on. I had to. I couldn't wait for you forever. \"I'm in love with Anna,\" Izzy confessed. \"And now she hates me.\" \"Wait,\" Mary said. \"Rewind, and replay. You love her?\" \"Yeah,\" Izzy said. Mary looked lost and confused. \"What me and Anna had was really special. And I don't want to lose her.\" Izzy said with longing in his voice. \"I've never felt this way about anyone before.\" \"Not even me?\" Mary asked. \"I'm sorry, Mary.\" Izzy said. \"It was the first time I was really with somebody, puppy love.\" \"And this thing with this Anna girl isn't?\" Mary screeched. \"Mary, I'm going to be eighteen next month. You're only going to be seventeen in December. I'm graduating, and you're still a junior. What Anna and I have or had was special.\" \"Corny much?\" Mary asked. \"Maybe, but that's what happens when you're in love.\" Izzy said. \"You're not in love,\" Mary argued. \"It's just a silly little crush.\" \"Mary,\" Izzy told her in that patronizing way he had, \"It's not just a crush. Over a year of being together is not a crush. It's at least deep respect, and at the most true love. I'm truly in love with Anna.\" \"You can say that, but I know it's not true.\" Mary protested. \"When you kissed me, you difinitely felt something.\" \"No,\" Izzy said. \"I didn't feel anything but curiosity. I didn't know why you were kissing me when we hadn't been anything in close to two years. I moved on, Mary. And you should have, too. Goodbye.\" Izzy left Mary standing there, confused and lost. She didn't know what to say or do. Ten minutes later, the tears came, unstopping. She stood there and wondered what Izzy had found in Anna. She stood there, and wondered when her heart would ever mend. End of Chapter 4[Chapter 5] Chapter 5 Later that night, with his window open, Izzy could hear the shuffling of boxes. He didn't want to think about what it could mean, so he didn't bother looking out. Eventually, the sound of Julia's voice saying, \"Are you sure about this, Annabeth?\" made him peak out the window. Anna was sitting on a box, her long, red hair straight and her face illuminated by the moon and tears. \"Yeah, Mommy, I'm sure,\" she said. \"Annabeth, I don't want to lose you.\" Julia said. \"You won't lose me, Mom, I'm just going to go back to Colorado and finish my senior year. Then I'll be interning in Russia for the summer to learn more about ballet,\" Anna said. \"What about Izzy?\" Julia said. \"Aren't you going to tell him?\" \"Izzy doesn't matter, Mom,\" Anna told her. \"I saw another girl go up and kiss him openly, like they've done it before. We're done.\" \"Are you sure?\" Julia said, sounding shocked. \"That doesn't seem like Izzy.\" \"Oh, I'm sure. He won't even realize I'm gone. And if he does, oh well. If he can move on from me, then I can do the same courtesy for him.\" Anna said this positively, like she was looking forward to it. \"The school already knows I'm coming there, Jason still goes to school there. He's fourteen, I still can't believe it. He'll be happy to see me other than summer vacation. I'll come back before Russia, Mommy, I promise.\" \"Is the plane ticket booked?\" Julia asked. \"Yeah, and I forwarded all my transcripts this past marking period to the internship so I'm set.\" Anna sounded sure and tired. \"Okay, hon, well... You better get some sleep. You're plane leaves at 12:30 tomorrow.'\" \"I know. Goodnight, Mommy, I love you.\" \"I love you, too,\" Julia said as she kissed her daughter goodnight. An hour later, when the doors were still open, but Anna was asleep, Izzy climbed out his window and into Anna's room. He left a note in the ballet bag he knew had to be her carry-on for the flight, looked at Anna longingly, kissed her on the forehead, and left the room. Julia stood on the other side of the door, watching Izzy as he did what she knew he had to do. As soon as he was gone for ten minutes, she closed the balcony doors and looked at her daughter. \"He really loves you, Annabeth,\" she said quietly as she left the room once again. At The Airport Anna held on to her carry-on as if it could solve all her problems. It was her ballet bag, in the rare case that Izzy came, he could recognize her by the bag she held. She checked inside once again, and found an envelope with her name on it. iAnnabeth Montgomery/i it said in a messy scraw, that she could recognize as Izzy's. Sighing, she opened the letter, figuring she should at least pay him the courtesy of opening it. And her mother was at the bathroom, so she did have privacy. Anna, I'm sorry about Mary. She was my girlfriend over two years ago. She used to live in your house. When she moved, I was so lonely and wanted someone to talk to. You answered my prayers, Anna. You gave me a loyal friend and a wonderful girlfriend. I'm sorry I never told you sooner. I love you, Anna. I think I have since the first time I kissed you under the mistletoe. I wish that you didn't have to be reading this letter goodbye, but you are. I want you to know that I heard you talking to your Mom last night. I understand, though I wish you didn't have to go. Good luck in Russia, I hope you'll be the prima, prove to them all you can do it. Have a good time in Colorado. Tell your brother I said hey. Karin's got a crush on him from the summer, she still stares at his picture where his arm's around her. I want you to be happy, Anna. That's all that you need in life, to be happy. And you deserve to be happy. I love you Annabeth Marie Chase Montgomery. Never forget that. You know they say that if you love someone, if it's best for them, you have to let them go. And I guess I have to let you go then. Only the best for you, Izzy P.s. Don't ever stop dreaming. Anna cried in the middle of the letter. So he had heard her. And he loved her so much that he would let her go. \"Izzy,\" she croaked out to herself. \"Izzy, why didn't you tell me sooner?\" End of Chapter 5[Chapter 6] Chapter 6 Anna sat with her knees to her chest, still sobbing, but not as loud as she had before. People had been staring before, and she could barely take the pain of losing Izzy. It took leaving as a sign to finally say that she loved him, and she had no idea why she couldn't say that before. She guessed it was because she was stubborn. She was exhausted, and her plane was going to board in about a half-hour. Her mom had come back ten minutes previously with a turkey and cheese sandwich for her, in case she was hungry. Anna ate it greedily, having not had breakfast that morning. Her stomach had been in knots. And it still was. A half-hour later, she hugged her mother goodbye and boarded her plane, wishing she had another choice. But she knew it was what she wanted and needed above all else. She had to get away from New York, and when she came back, she had to be careful around Izzy. By the time she returned he would've found a new love anyway. There weren't too many people going to Colorado, so she figured she would sit with no one beside her on the plane. That was why she was surprised when a pleasant voice asked, \"May I sit here?\" Not looking up at the vaguely familiar voice's face, she nodded, and continued to look out the window. \"You know, Anna, Izzy really does love you. He's been depresed since yesterday,\" the voice said. Anna turned to face the person and saw... \"Karin, you really don't understand. And why are you on this plane?\" \"I'm coming with you, so you're not lonely.\" \"What about Izzy? Won't he be lonely?\" Anna said sarcastically. \"Not if he's on the plane, too.\" But Karin's not the one who answered. Anna looked up from the window again. \"Well, well, well, if it's not love letter boy,\" she said. \"Well, well, well, if it's not the runaway ballerina,\" Izzy said. \"What do you want?\" she asked bitterly. Anna had forgiven him, but she wanted to see his reasons. \"To stop you from going.\" \"Why?\" \"Because...\" he started, then sighed. \"Because I'm in love with you and if you're going, then I'm going with you.\" \"But everything you have is in New York,\" Anna said, shocked. \"But the person I love isn't in New York. She's on a plane headed to Colorado. And where she goes, I go, because I can't live without her. And I hope she knows that.\" Izzy finished. \"She does,\" Anna said, as she pulled him close and kissed him. End of Chapter 6[Chapter 7] So this is the end of Don't Give Up. It's been a long way for me, completing my first story, like posting-wise. I hope you like the ending! Chapter 7rnEpilogue Three years later, when Izzy and Anna were 21, Izzy proposed. Anna was visiting from Russia at the time and said yes. She never bothered to go back to Russia. Izzy and Anna were married on November 29, 2012, and went on their honeymoon to Australia. They decided to move to Brooklyn, New York, close to home, but not too close. After Anna and Izzy had their three daughters, Bella, Rosalie, and Lynna, and their two sons, Jacob and Evan, Anna got a job at a ballet studio, and ended up buying it from the owner. Izzy still did double-dutching and all of their kids were interested in it, as well as the girls doing ballet. Izzy also became a successful boxer, and by the time he was 35, the family never had to worry about anything. They were well-off and well-liked in their neighborhood. Their kids grew older and eventually all of them married, and moved around the Northeast part of the United States. Izzy and Anna lived happily, until Anna died of leukemia in 2058. She was sixty-eight years old. Exactly a month later, Izzy died of a broken heart. Izzy and Anna's story is one I like to tell to my own kids, and grandkids, who still visit regularly. They never had to wonder whether Aunt Anna and Uncle Izzy were good people, because they were involved in their lives. Some people called our family weird. I didn't. I called our family blessed. After all, Izzy was the best brother a girl could ask for. THE END A/N: I hoped you liked this one, I finished a story, EEEE!! So this story was basically Karin telling it to her grandkids and children and so forth. About my naming choices for their kids. Bella (Isabella Swan) and Rosalie (Rosalie Hale, in the Cullen family, married to Emmett) are two of my favorite Twilight characters, so I put their names in. I want to name one of my own children Lynna (it means waterfall) one day. Jacob's (Jacob Black, major character in New Moon, the sequel to Twilight) another character from Twilight, and same story with Evan as with Lynna. I hope you enjoyed! Love, Melissa ","Summary":" So I'm going to rant for about a minute.

My mind is pacing my heart is racing it's not joy it's not love it's that awful thing called pain as I sit thinking of the day I try to remember his face I can't even determine his race and don't know why jack is helping me but at least there someone to have my back he seems like a nice guy but with a cause. I'm trying figure out if I met jack before I think it was when I was prison I'm not sure, I called fin to see where he is shockingly said he is back in mount kisco and I'm in san Fran it's a long way but you got to do what you got to do , every guy hopped in his 5 second car and went driving to the highway its not a bad trip but the reason is and of course there was big problem this car is a car that presumably disappeared 4 months ago so I think it must be registered stolen. As jack explains to me that ive been in the hospital for abour six months now and he found out about me after three months of the accident I have no idea if should trust him but for now he is my only hope. its been 8 hours since we left to the open road we are about to enter Chicago I felt there was something wrong with jack when we entered Chicago I asked him why he was upset he explained to me he was in huge debts to the Chicago mafia and wanted to kill him so he had to join a race called the run which its prize was 25 million dollars his debt was 7 million dollars that's why they wanted him dead so bad after he got the money he gave it to the guy from the bank bill wayworth to put it in his saving account and pay the mafia but instead stole the money ran with it and is planning to join ideloneo the biggest race held illegally by the Italian mafia the prize is 56 million dollar I cant imagine how high his debt is to enter such a race which consisted of 350 street racers well its about time they became 352 we contacted sara a business pal and by the looks of it his ex girlfriend she said she will pay the entrance fee and will take 28 percent of the winning she said the race starts tomorrow so we rested in sara safe house because of jacks issue we woke up at 10 am got dressed we were back on the road we got these tablets installed by sara in each car I called fin to check if they will meet us along the route and he said yes he told me someone new joined the crew his name is Dylan and I will meet him soon enough I wasn't really worried but didn't want him to end up dead like pete, the starting line was at a subway stop everyone thought it was a rush hour because 352 car were blocking the road when the light goes green everyone becomes mean as soon it hit green all you could see was smoke it took me and jack about a minute to get out of the smokes since every car was from zero to sixty in seconds the first thing you could here were cop car sirens following us I couldn't believe they arrest 12 cars in less than 5 minutes I was number 312 and jack was 310 he has been in such huge events so he is use to it . it took me a struggle to pass my first ten cars in Chicago then it became easier over time jack was pacing he overtook 35 cars before leaving the state boundaries unlike me I passed 27 cars but there is always a first time for everything it was almost midnight and we were on our way to las vegas until a cop car hit jack and the car was out of the race since he coudnt move without wheels he had to run a mile until I got him now we are in one car I had to call fin so he can hooks up he said he had only my old ford mustang boss he said he could deal with it we stopped at gas station in Nevada springs so he can get the car, fin introduced me to Dylan I thought I saw a ghost I froze a little bit to see he looked exactly like pete turns out he is his cousin he told me he was really thankful for avenging pete and that he will stay with us for as long as it takes to get bill. Jack hopped In the car he was surprised of how well it was restored as if all the parts were original and that the car is brand new with a touch of this century he was glad to drive it felt like he is now ready to win this race. We have lost our lead we had to pass about 70 cars before getting to the borders of Denver we were number 335 and 336 because some racers where arrested on the way, we managed to pass the first twenty cars easily and then all the people who couldn't go pro were in our way it was hard to pass this racer called Gabriel bafter he was one nasty son of a bitch he couldnt go pro because he was known to bash peoples head after the race who over took him he was charged with multiple assaults in 2009 and was banned to enter any racing events in the us , now he is almost broke wife left and is trying to pay the divorce fee and his rent he entered this race to win her back but I don't know to what extent is he planning to get her back and then you have the rich playboy who entered just for fun james king is banned of driving in the state of Michigan because he was caught having sex with a mans wife and a prostitute and the possession of 4 pound of weed while driving since he is a spoiled rich brat he had gotten only 300 hours of community service and a driving ban from the state anyway he is out here to have some fun and get paid while doing it and finally there was bill wayworth number 100 we are gonna get him one way or another. The only place we ever enjoyed driving in was on Denver country side road way since no one owned fast cars in the country side it was a smooth trip we enjoyed the scenery of the countryside it was beautiful but cold it was freezing in the mustang jack was driving we didn't think that we would need a heater in mount kisco since we barely drove that car I told fin to get us some winter clothes and give it to us at dylans family ranch. We needed to eat and have our self some rest we get there dylans family had a lot of questions to ask me since they knew that I didn't kill pete and that I was prisoned although I was innocent we had a nice meal and we went to sleep for 6 hours. We woke up got dressed ate some food for breakfast and we were back on the road luckily every racer did the same thing except bill and the first 10 racers in the lead but we didn't have to catch up with anyone the finish line was at a pier in Miami Florida but they used this weird route which wasn't the easiest route to Miami. we were leaving denver borders until Gabriel bafter came out of no where and took out 7 cars by making them crash into supply truck which caused 4 people dead and 3 severely injured and shot out james kings tires which resulted his car flying in the air and crash landing on the side of the road , I couldn't just leave him to die that's make me the person dino Brewster is a cold hearted son of bitch so I stopped and I couldn't believe he was still alive so I spoke to sarah on the tablet to send me the nearest hospital to me which was 32 km away from the race route so I sat him in the back sit and went racing to the hospital I reached the speed of 170 km per hour in a minute and half in a neighborhood alleys till I got to saint jennas general hospital and told fin and Dylan to take care of him until he gets to the emergency room and then I went in a hurry to my car and drove away quickly I had to call the only person that can help maverick aka liar one although he is banned to fly planes in the us he now flies with a different alias I called him and asked him if he can hook my car to his plane so I can get back on the road faster he was at first worried and then was down to do it so in 15 minutes arrives and hooks me up to the plane it's a scary experience but I think we passed the stage of fear since last times plane hook up. We crossed triple the distance I could of got to in 7 minutes after 35 minutes In the air we got to were jack was and the look on his face was priceless seeing me hooked up to a plane but the most important thing is I had to get the cars wheel to spin at a speed of 210 km per hour so my car doesn't hit all the cars behind it , it was so close to fail until jack was behind my car pushing it until I could remove the hook ups and get my hand back on the steering wheel as soon as I removed the hooks pressed the pedal until it touched the floor and passed 5 cars in less than a minute it was amazing and jack was right behind me we were about to enter Alaska so I told jack we should pass more cars before alaskas check point so we took a shortcut which was jumping of a ramp which would save us about 25 minutes from the other racers I didn't like the idea it reminded me of detriots flying lotus stunt of course I took of the ramp it was fast I think we passed about 40 racers . we are now number 250 and 249 and we are about to hit the icy roads Sorry for not writing for so long I was very busy in the few months but now im back I hope you like this chapter from familiar faces and please follow it and leave a review ","Summary":" Need for speed : familiar faces After toby marshal finished his prison time Julia arrived to pick h"},{"Movie":"Need for Speed","Title":"Roads untraveled","Author":"Swato","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773951","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Auteur: Swato Pairing: Tobey x Pete tout au long de l'histoire ; mais Tobey x Julia à la fin ^^ Disclaimers: Les personnages et l'univers de Need for Speed ne m'appartiennent pas. Note: J'ai gardé le déroulement de l'histoire tel qu'il était. Ça va peut-être vous paraitre bizarre parce qu'à vrai dire je n'ai rien changé DU TOUT lol J'ai juste pris le parti de raconter l'histoire du point de vue de Tobey. Je vous laisse juger par vous même. Je vous avoue que cette fic a été un véritable défouloir pour moi, j'avais besoin de l'écrire. Je blâme entièrement Aaron Paul et son jeu d'acteur pour ce qui va suivre. Note 2: Pour ceux et celles qui me suivent sur les autres fictions (Hannibal, Harry Potter, Teen wolf...) je vais poster un petit mot sur mon profil, si ça vous intéresse de le voir. Note 3 : Si vous continuez de lire, je vais salement vous spoiler Need for Speed, cela va sans dire ;) . Pour ceux qui n'ont pas vus Need for Speed, petites précisions: Le Cessna: c'est un avion monoplan qui appartient à Benny. La course du De Leon: elle est organisée tous les ans par Monarch , un pilote mis à la retraite à cause d'un problème cardiaque. Lors de cette course, le gagnant remporte les voitures des autres compétiteurs. Monarch tient une sorte de station de radio, ils sont tous en réseau, me demandez pas comment :P Brewster Motors et Marshall Motors étaient en compétition directe dans le passé dans cette fic. Je ne sais pas vraiment s'ils l'étaient dans l'histoire originale. Je n'en parle pas dans ma fic, mais c'est mentionné: Dino a demandé à Tobey de l'aider à réparer une Mustang en lui promettant 25 % du prix de la vente de la voiture. Ils la vendent à un gars qui s'appelle Ingram par l'intermédiaire de Julia. Au moment de la vente, Pete se moque des compétences de pilotes de Dino. Dino propose de les départager dans une course. Et voilà ce qui se passe : . . Je vois l'eau et le soleil... je vois Tobey, regardant un phare. Je te vois, tu gagnes le De Leon ! ... Ce jour là, les flics mettent exactement vingt-trois minutes à rappliquer. La Koenigsegg Agera est sur le dos, pliée comme un pot de yaourt. L'eau du fleuve est glacée, mes genoux sont en sang depuis que je me suis effondré à coté de la carcasse, la fumée me brûle les yeux. Les mains crispées dans mes cheveux, les joues baignées de larmes et la gorge écorchée d'avoir trop hurlé, je regarde les flammes s'élever vers le ciel, les volutes noires, épaisses s'échapper de l'habitacle en emportant avec elles ce qui reste de mon meilleur-ami. ... Dans la salle d'interrogatoire, deux flics me bombardent de questions, un blanc, un black. Le crâne en compote, fatigué, je laisse mes lèvres vomir les réponses avec une honnêteté brute. C'est son enterrement et je suis là. Ou plutôt: je ne suis pas là. Mes paupières se ferment et son image brûle ma rétine, il est là, à coté de moi, sourire large, yeux bleus, une réplique arrogante nuancée par son air de faux ange et sa foutue coiffure à la James Dean : - Relax, je me coiffe comme lui mais t'es toujours mon héros. - ... où vous prétendez que la troisième voiture se trouvait ? La réalité me rattrape. Le flic me pointe le schéma que j'ai dessiné il y a une heure de cela avec insistance. Avec un soupir, mes doigts indiquent ce que j'ai déjà expliqué au moins une centaine de fois: - Ma voiture avait deux longueurs... d'avance. Et c'est... C'est là que Pete était et Dino était juste derrière. Dino a tapé son pare-choc arrière... fort, dans l'angle... - Dino a deux témoins qui disent qu'il était avec eux toute la journée, me coupe le flic black. - Et le propriétaire de Brewster Motors a rapporté deux Koenigsegg volées la semaine dernière, la votre et celle de Pete , appuie le second. Le piège se referme sur moi mais je ne pense qu'à l'enterrement. Je me demande si Anita me déteste, si elle croit réellement que c'est moi qui ait tué son petit-frère. Mon petit-frère. Plus que mon petit-frère. Je lève les yeux vers le plafond, une agonie sourde déchire mes entrailles, mes larmes débordent. - Il les a rapporté sept minutes avant que la police arrive sur la scène de crime, s'acharne le flic blanc. Une vague d'épuisement me submerge, ma tête vacille vers l'avant, j'en profite pour essuyer mes joues avec la manche de mon pull carcéral d'un geste éreinté, ma voix déraille lorsque je réponds: - C'est son oncle, ok ? Ils... mentent. Il était là. Un sursaut d'énergie me fait relever le nez du schéma, je plante mes yeux dans ceux du flic assis en face de moi. L'autre est déjà préoccupé par ce qui se passe par la fenêtre, il n'écoute que d'une oreille distraite. - Dino était là, j'insiste. Mais pourquoi on me croirait ? La troisième voiture a disparu. Sur place, il n'y avait plus que ma Koenigsegg au milieu de la route, restée sur le pont et celle de Pete en bas, bousillée, dévorée par les flammes. Je secoue la tête, des nouveaux sillons creusent mes joues. - Impossible que ce soit arrivé. Ce n'est pas arrivé... Pete qui me parle de ses visions, qui rie à une blague stupide de Benny, qui remet Dino à sa place avec sa fausse innocence, qui fait semblant de ne pas avoir de filtre entre le cerveau et la bouche mais qui le fait exprès, parce qu'il sait très bien que les remarques les plus insolentes passent inaperçues une fois drapées dans un manteau d'ignorance, qui joue aux jeux vidéo avec Beast, qui sourit comme si c'était noël derrière le volant de cette voiture à la con... Je secoue la tête, le regard perdu dans le passé, flics oubliés. - Pete... Ce n'est pas arrivé... ... Deux ans de prison, ça fait réfléchir. Ça laisse le temps à la haine de se créer une place, à l'envie de vengeance de prendre racine, bien profondément, entre les tripes et le cœur. Assez de temps pour prendre contact avec Ingram qui possède la Mustang que j'ai réparé de mes propres mains avec mon équipe, avec Pete. La sueur et le sang coulés vont finalement servir à quelque chose. Je sais que mon esprit est rongé par une colère froide. Une fois dehors, Benny me donne une accolade mais c'est à peine si j'en sens la chaleur, le monde a perdu ses couleurs, le premier burger que j'avale a un goût de cendre. Une seule pensée me dévore: récupérer la Mustang, obtenir un free pass pour la course du De Leon et retourner la bagnole de Dino comme il a retourné celle de Pete. Appuyer sur l'accélérateur et ne pas faire demi-tour, pas un regard dans le rétro, juste le rugissement du moteur et la sensation d'avoir vengé Pete dans les veines. C'est mon plan. Ça ne veut pas dire que c'est la bonne chose à faire. Mais qu'est-ce que j'en ai à foutre ? ... Comme tous les plans bien défini, il faut qu'il y ait des imprévus. J'ai tout prévu, une marge de temps pour les débordements, des pièces de rechanges, de la musique, de la nourriture pour le voyage, des bouteilles d'eau vides pour les envies pressantes. - Ingram ne va pas laisser un ex-détenus sous liberté conditionnelle seul... avec sa voiture. Mais Julia, l'emmerdeuse british à la langue bien pendue ? Non, elle, je l'avais pas prévu. Du tout. ... Dans la voiture, en route pour la Californie, Julia essaye de parler, je suis froid. Glacial. Je veux qu'elle dégage et avec l'aide de Benny, ça pourrait marcher. Il survole la ville avec le Cessna et me donne les itinéraires les plus risqués, me fait faire des figures dangereuses, j'évite de justesse plusieurs véhicules, la Mustang effleure une ou deux fois la catastrophe, je suis mort de rire. Bordel, ce que la route m'avait manqué. Julia hurle de terreur, me crie dessus, écorche mon nom avec son accent british, transforme \"Tobey\" en quelque chose qui ressemble à \"Taobi !\". Et après mon petit show, elle me lance un coup d'œil, de la déception pleins les pupilles. - Si tu penses que conduire comme un dingue va me faire déguerpir, tu te trompes. Elle n'a pas l'intention de partir. Je reste planqué derrière mes lunettes de soleil, le bitume s'étend devant moi à perte de vue. Mes yeux dévient sur mon poignet droit, là où je te garde, caché à la vue du monde mais pas à la mienne. Mes paupières se ferment une demi-seconde et je secoue la tête. Malgré toute ma détermination, les souvenirs remontent. C'est à l'époque où on avait encore des clients et où mon père était encore en vie mais trop occupé à signer de la paperasse pour se salir les mains. Pete est assis sur le capot d'une voiture, il s'essuie les doigts sur un chiffon pas tout à fait propre, il a une trace de cambouis sur la tempe et sur le menton, quelques blessures sur les mains. C'est le métier qui rentre. Je balance une clef dans la caisse à outils, elle rebondit et glisse en dessous d'une caisse. Un soupir agacé m'échappe, je rampe pour la récupérer mais je me cogne en voulant me redresser. Pete se marre nerveusement tandis que je jette la clef dans la caisse, mon humeur tangue, entre exaspération, colère, tristesse, dégoût... Pete me lance une moue contrite: - Désolé... - T'y es pour rien, bonhomme. Il me donne une tape affectueuse dans le dos, toujours aussi penaud. Je me perche sur le capot de sa Chevrolet Camaro 396, à coté de lui, et m'allonge, épuisé. Il m'imite et je sens son regard sur moi, attentif. Un sourire taquine mes lèvres, je le pousse d'une épaule contre la sienne: - Sérieusement, mec. Arrête de me regarder comme ça, c'est flippant. - Je pensais pas que ma soeur ferait un truc pareil. Honnêtement, soupire Pete. Une chape de plomb me tombe sur l'estomac. J'essaye de ne pas penser à la façon dont Anita m'a trompé. Avec mon concurrent direct de Brewster Motors en plus, Dino. Pete continue: - Je sais pas ce qu'elle lui trouve. - Il a les plus belles voitures de tout Mount Kisco, je plaisante. - Pour compenser son micro-pénis, à tous les coups ! Je ris et secoue la tête, un poids s'enlève de mes épaules. Pete se tourne vers moi, ses lèvres étirées en un sourire mais ses yeux inquiets: - Il essaye de te faire tourner en bourrique. Si elle est assez bête pour tomber dans le panneau, c'est son problème mais elle va vite le regretter. T'es meilleur pilote que lui. Le meilleur même. - Aaaww, Pete, je vais rougir ! Je pique ses cotes de mon index et éclate de rire lorsqu'il tombe sur les fesses à force de gigoter dans tous les sens. Je reste allongé sur le capot, il finit par réapparaitre et me bouscule gentiment. - Vois le bon coté des choses: tu m'as toujours. Je fronce les sourcils mais il a l'air sérieux. - Anita m'a dit que vous déménagiez à Manhattan. - Comme si ça allait arriver, répond t-il en reniflant avec dédain. Je reste ici, je me suis déjà arrangé avec mon vieux. On se débarrasse pas de moi comme ça, Tob', j'espère que t'es pas trop déçu. Un vrai sourire étire mes lèvres pour la première fois depuis un mois. - Je m'en remettrai. La sonnerie de mon portable me remet les idées en place, il fait noir, j'ai passé toute l'après-midi dans un état second. Beast m'appelle, je décroche. - Pete aurait adoré ce voyage. Une aiguille de plus dans ma poitrine. Mes lèvres s'entrouvrent, je parle sans vraiment savoir ce que je dis. Tout ce que je pense c'est que : ouais, il aurait adoré ça, il aurait bondi partout comme un gamin avant de me sauter dessus comme il le faisait parfois avant de hurler \"Le De Leon, Tob ! Le De Leon !\". Petey . Il me manque. Je raccroche. Julia remue, tourne la tête vers moi avec hésitation: - Je suis désolée pour Pete. Est-ce qu'ils se sont passés le mot ? Ça fait mal, arrêtez de prononcer son nom. Mes pensées dérivent vers Dino. C'est plus facile. De haïr Dino. Mes mâchoires se crispent, la colère remplace l'abattement et le vide: - Il l'a laissé là. C'est ce que je ne peux pas pardonner. Un éclair de compréhension passe dans les yeux de Julia. Elle comprend enfin pourquoi j'ai proposé ce marché à Ingram, son patron. Emprunter la Mustang pour faire la De Leon contre la moitié des gains si je remporte la course. C'est pas une question de fric. C'est une question de vengeance. Pour Pete. ... On va chercher Finn. Beast le convainc de laisser tomber sa boite d'informatique pour rejoindre la bande, direction Californie. Benny pique l'hélicoptère d'une chaine de télévision pour nous filmer pendant qu'on échappe aux flics au péril de nos vies, il s'éclate comme un fou, ça me réchauffe le cœur de le voir s'amuser. Je ne peux pas m'empêcher de flirter avec Julia, c'est une seconde nature chez moi, de flirter avec le danger. Leurs présences commencent à atténuer le froid, le problème, c'est que je ne suis pas sûr d'avoir envie de le lâcher. ... Julia sourit, je la vois sourire du coin de l'œil, malicieusement. Elle est belle quand elle sourit. Elle l'est encore plus quand elle se moque de mon jargon de mécano. Encore plus quand je me moque de son jargon de fashionista. Mais quand elle ouvre la fenêtre, se met à cheval sur la portière pour aider Finn à remplir le réservoir alors que la Mustang roule à 128km/h et qu'on est toujours sur l'autoroute, elle devient dangereusement sexy. ... Benny charge les vidéos et j'envoie les miennes à l'organisateur du De Leon: Monarch, objectif: obtenir un free pass pour la course. La Mustang va piquer son intérêt, il la voudra dans sa course, c'est une véritable légende sur roues. Les vidéos de mes manœuvres sont censés le ferrer, lui donner une bonne raison de nous envoyer une invitation. Et intrigué, il l'est. Ses paroles s'élèvent de la radio, des exclamations surprises et pleines de respect, d'excitation. Puis Dino appelle Monarch, passe en ligne et pisse sur mon honneur, trahi encore une fois la mémoire de Pete en m'accusant du meurtre. Dans le même temps, il met nos têtes à prix pour nous stopper. - Tu devrais appeler Monarch, te défendre, crache Julia. - Tout le monde connait mon histoire. Elle m'ignore et appelle Monarch, me défend, met le doigt sur les incohérences de mon comportement. Pourquoi briser ma liberté conditionnelle alors que j'ai fait mes deux ans de taule si ce n'est pour réparer un tort ? Si ce n'est pour rendre justice à Pete en confrontant Dino à ses actes ? Quand elle raccroche, Monarch est convaincu mais sur la réserve. Une invitation pour le De Léon arrive sur la console centrale, on est dans la course. - Merci, je souffle. - De rien, répond t-elle avec assurance, certaine d'avoir fait la bonne chose. Je l'envie. ... On s'arrête pour mettre de l'essence. Julia va à la station service pour échanger ses talons contre des chaussures plus confortables et sûrement se rafraichir. J'ai besoin d'une douche mais on n'a pas vraiment le temps. Un flic se pointe, je passe inaperçu grâce au pick up garé juste devant la Mustang. Julia ne passe pas inaperçue. Quand je l'appelle, je l'entends dire au flic que \"bien sur que non, je ne suis pas dans la Mustang grise qu'on voit à sur les écrans de surveillance ! Mustang ? Comme les chevaux ?\" avant de courir s'enfermer dans une chambre à l'étage pour lui échapper lorsqu'il demande à ce qu'elle l'accompagne jusqu'à sa bagnole. Que je suis entrain de trafiquer. Perchée sur le toit comme une chouette terrifiée, elle refuse de sauter, elle a peur, je sens ma poitrine se serrer. Pas moyen que je la laisse ici, alors que le flic va débouler. Quand elle atterrit dans mes bras deux minutes plus tard, elle est aussi choquée que moi. Ce n'est pas qu'elle m'ait fait confiance au final. Elle a glissé. Mais le résultat est le même: je suis là pour là rattraper. On se barre en vitesse, Julia frissonne un peu de partout, à cause de l'adrénaline. Je lui avoue qu'elle m'a impressionné. L'image de la british coincée a quitté mon esprit depuis longtemps, remplacée par cette fille courageuse et un peu frappa-dingue assise à la place du co-pilote. Le sourire tremblant de Julia me fait sourire. Je lui propose de prendre le volant, je suis crevé et elle n'a jamais conduit la Mustang à cette vitesse. Pas d'arrêt pour lui laisser la main, elle glisse de mon coté, remplace mon pied sur la pédale, mes mains sur le volant, glisse sur moi. Mes bras la stabilisent sur le siège, sa chaleur m'envahis, son odeur m'emplit les poumons. Un sentiment qui m'avait quitté depuis la mort de Pete refait surface et c'est aussi familier que douloureux. De la tendresse. J'ai l'impression de le trahir. - C'est bon ? Tu l'as en main ? - Ouiii ! - Bien ! Je répète le mot à l'infini alors que je passe à la place passager, amusé malgré moi par les étincelles dans ses yeux et par sa façon de tenir le volant, comme si elle avait de l'or entre les doigts, émerveillée. La sensation ne s'en va pas. Pire: elle s'installe. Je reste éveillé un moment, le temps de m'assurer qu'elle ait bien la situation en main, avant de poser ma tête contre mon bras replié contre la vitre. Mon rêve n'en est pas un, c'est encore un souvenir. Beast et Finn sont entrain de réparer l'Impala qu'un gars leur a apporté hier en les menaçant de les castrer s'ils faisaient mal à son bébé. Benny est de sortie avec son Cessna. Je suis seul, mon père s'est enfermé dans son bureau il y a deux minutes pour passer un coup de fil important. Pete débarque alors qu'il était censé se reposer. La course d'hier a été intense, l'agacement monte dans ma poitrine parce que je lui ai ordonné d'aller se coucher. - Petey ! Demi-tour, bonhomme, tu dors debout. Il secoue la tête et c'est à ce moment là que je remarque à quel point il est pâle. Inquiet, je m'approche et je pose une main sur son épaule, il s'écroule contre moi. Ses bras s'enroulent autour de ma taille et il me serre au point de faire craquer mon dos. - Wow ! Est-ce que ça va ? Mes bras se referment automatiquement autour de lui, je passe une main dans ses cheveux pour tenter de repousser sa tête dans l'espoir de voir son visage. Il ne se laisse pas faire, mon anxiété grimpe d'un cran. - Pete, qu'est-ce qui se passe ? - Je suis désolé... - Tu es désolé de quoi ? Il ne me répond pas. Je fronce les sourcils et essaye de lui tirer les vers du nez mais rien. Il est aussi muet qu'une tombe. Je me résous à ne pas le presser, je le garde contre moi le temps qu'il se reprenne, mort d'inquiétude mais déterminé à le soutenir. Lorsqu'il rentre chez lui, deux heures plus tard, ses yeux sont rouges et ne croisent pas les miens une seule fois. Dans la nuit, mon père succombe à une crise cardiaque. Le coup est violent. Aussi soudain qu'inattendu. Les gars sont là pour moi. Beast et Finn, plus maladroits qu'autre chose face à mon deuil, se contentent d'une tape réconfortante dans le dos, Benny d'une accolade plus longue que d'habitude. Pete... Pete ne me quitte pas. Il me faut trois jours pour comprendre. - Tu as eut une vision, pas vrai ? Pete prend une inspiration brusque. Ses yeux évitent les miens. Une boule se forme dans ma gorge, je manque de m'étouffer. - Tu l'as vu mourir, pourquoi tu m'as rien dit ? - ... tellement désolé, Tobey, s'étrangle t-il, entre deux sanglots. - Pourquoi tu m'as rien dit... Je craque. Pete est là et c'est à mon tour de me serrer contre lui comme si ma vie en dépendait. ... Quelqu'un cherche à nous faire tomber, compliment de Dino. Julia détruit une voiture à elle toute seule, elle est totalement folle. Mais puisque dix minutes plus tard, on se retrouve dans la voiture suspendue à un câble, soulevée par un hélicoptère US ARMY APACHE piloté par Benny, je pense qu'on peut dire que nous le sommes tous autant les uns que les autres. Malgré son acrophobie, Julia me fait confiance et me regarde dans les yeux lorsque je le lui demande. Pour détourner son attention. - De quels couleurs sont mes yeux ? - Ils sont très... bleus ! Répond t-elle, les yeux embués par des larmes de panique. - Ils sont très bleus ! Bien ! Ils sont beaucoup plus bleus que les tiens ! - Non ! - Si, ils le sont. - Ils ne le sont pas ! Rétorque t-elle, indignée. - Si ! - Ils ne sont pas plus bleus ! - Admets-le ! - Les miens sont plus bleus ! J'éclate de rire, l'adrénaline pulse dans mes veines, j'ai envie de l'embrasser. Je ne le fais pas, à la place, je me concentre sur la vue que l'on a du fleuve en contrebas, à plusieurs mètres de là. Julia respire fort. Je pose mes mains sur le tableau de bord, la vue est assez terrifiante. Wow. - Benny ! Ne nous fais pas tomber ! - Quoi?! S'écrie faiblement Julia. Je cède presque à la tentation de me pencher pour embrasser ses lèvres entrouvertes, son regard effrayé est hilarant. Je me retiens de rire: - Je plaisante, je plaisante ! Elle n'a pas l'air de trouver ça drôle. ... On comble les derniers kilomètres à la hâte, on est à la bourre. - Tu as 23 minutes de retard, m'annonce Julia. Je sors de la voiture aussitôt et me précipite à l'intérieur. C'est une sorte de bâtiment où se tienne des conférences, ce n'est pas le lieu de la course, juste le lieu de confirmation. Je monte les escaliers quatre à quatre et tombe nez à nez avec Dino. Il est surpris. Je suis perdu. Ma bouche se met à trembler malgré moi, mon poignet me brûle. Une rage mêlée de confusion s'empare de moi, je le dévisage. Il parle mais je ne comprends pas un mot de ce qu'il dit, je ne l'entends pas à travers le bourdonnement dans mes oreilles. Puis mes lèvres s'activent: - Tu n'as pas fait demi-tour pour lui. Un sourire cruel étire ses lèvres: - Je n'étais pas là, tu te souviens ? Ma colère monte, monte. Il continue de parler, je le plaque contre le mur. Je pense à Pete, déchiré entre son amour pour sa soeur et son amitié pour moi. Pete, qui avait essayé d'être cordial avec Dino au début avant de comprendre à quel point il était mauvais, corrompu. Pete, abattu par le fait que sa soeur soit amoureuse d'un pourri. D'un gars capable de laisser son petit-frère crever pour gagner une stupide course. Tout mon corps se met à trembler, je ne sais même plus si c'est de rage ou de peine contenue. Je le lâche après quelques paroles dédaigneuses de sa part. Je le remet à sa place et le laisse en plan, j'ai autre chose à faire. Je vais à l'accueil, donne mon nom pour confirmer ma présence à la course du De Leon et descends pour rejoindre Julia. Mon sang vibre encore de ma confrontation avec Dino, je claque la portière. Elle devine tout de suite qui j'ai croisé et ce qui s'est passé. Je m'accoude à la fenêtre et appuie ma joue contre mon poignet droit. Elle tente de me remonter le moral: - Tu dois oublier... Lâcher prise. Mon premier réflexe est de lui hurler dessus. Je ne le fais pas. Je crispe les mâchoires et je me tais, je ne la regarde pas. Ce n'est pas de sa faute si Pete est mort, elle essaye de m'aider. Ses conseils ne sont pas débiles. Mais oublier ? Non. Je ne peux pas. Lâcher prise ? Pas question. - Je pense... que tu as besoin de sortir de la voiture, d'une douche chaude, d'un bon repaaaas et d'un peu de repoooos... Son accent et la façon dont elle chantonne le reste me donne le sourire. Je sens le sien sans avoir besoin de la voir. Mes épaules se détendent, la glace qui s'était installé dans mon estomac se met à fondre. - D'un peu de nourrituuuure..., continue t-elle. Je te réserve une chambre d'hotel. - Je pense que ce serait mieux si tu restais avec moi ce soir. Elle me sourit et lève un sourcil. Je me repasse ma phrase en tête et me mords les lèvres. - Je veux dire... Ce serait plus sûr... Son sourire s'agrandit, elle penche la tête sur le coté. L'embarras me fait balbutier: - ... de rester avec moi. Hein ? Ouais. Elle penche la tête de l'autre coté et me regarde, taquine. Mignonne. Sexy. Tout à la fois. Je ris sans pouvoir m'en empêcher. Bon sang, cette fille. Je démarre la voiture. Et c'est là que tout vire au cauchemar. Un camion nous rentre dedans. La Mustang se retourne, fait des tonneaux, je perds le contrôle, les vitres se brisent, ma tête cogne contre le volant, le montant, le siège... Un vrai passage à tabacs. Finalement, la bagnole s'arrête de voltiger dans tous les sens. ... Je sors Julia de la voiture, elle est inconsciente. Beast et Finn viennent nous chercher. Je la garde dans mes bras tout le long du trajet. Ses cheveux blonds tachés de sang, les coupures sur son visage... L'angoisse ne me quitte pas, je la dévisage. Elle regagne conscience par intervalles irréguliers, ses yeux sont perdus, vagues, elle a l'air d'avoir mal, peur. Je murmure des trucs sans queue ni tête du genre \"ça va aller, tout va bien aller, on va à l'hôpital, ils vont t'arranger ça en un rien de temps\" alors que je n'en sais rien du tout. Je suis terrifié. ... Finn reste avec Julia à l'hôpital. J'ai confiance en lui. Je ne peux rien faire pour elle, elle est entre les mains des médecins, Finn m'appellera dès qu'il en saura plus. En attendant, il me faut une voiture. Anita me donne une opportunité que je n'avais jamais espéré avoir. Elle me donne la preuve que Dino était là le jour où Pete est mort: une Koenigsegg Agera rouge, la troisième voiture. ... A l'hôpital, Finn est devant la porte. Je lui donne une tape sur l'épaule et entre dans la chambre. Au début, je crois que Julia dort. Elle ne dort pas mais elle n'est pas hyper consciente non plus. Bras cassés, peut-être cotes cassées. Coupures diverses. Elle a l'air minuscule dans le lit, fragile. Les apparences sont trompeuses. Elle est loin d'être fragile. C'est la fille qui a enjambé une portière pour mettre de l'essence dans une voiture roulant à toute vitesse, la fille qui a sauté du toit du deuxième étage pour échapper à un flic, qui a conduit la Mustang par dessus un précipice, qui m'a fait confiance. Qui m'a aidé à replacer des couleurs dans un monde que je ne voyais plus qu'en noir et blanc. Je me penche vers elle pour qu'elle n'ait pas à parler trop fort et je ne peux m'empêcher de la détailler. Ses pupilles, si bleues, voilées par les anti-douleurs mais toujours aussi vives, intelligentes et malicieuses, ce grain de beauté près de sa bouche, ses lèvres... Elle me sourit, ses paupières vacillent tandis qu'elle murmure quelque chose que je ne saisis pas. Je la fais répéter, attendri. - C'est pour Pete, dit-elle lentement. Ses paupières s'ouvrent et ses yeux se plantent dans les miens. Et je sais. Rien qu'avec ce regard, je sais qu'elle a compris, qu'elle a vu clair à travers moi, comme dans un livre ouvert, sans aucun effort apparent. Je souris en ignorant l'émotion qui me serre la gorge, je hoche la tête. Je me penche plus près et je l'embrasse. Parce qu'elle sait , elle sait et elle est toujours là. Elle sait et je suis dingue d'elle. ... Je profite de la chambre d'hôtel que Julia m'a réservé. C'est une chambre simple, un lit, une table de nuit, un bureau... Je prends une douche chaude, je me change et mange un vrai repas. Je m'assois sur le lit, me lève et me poste à la fenêtre. Je remonte la manche longue de ma main droite et découvre le tatouage qui s'y cache. Le nom de Pete s'étale en lettre capitale, accompagné du chiffre 396, comme sa voiture. Je ferme les yeux. Si je me concentre assez, je peux presque sentir sa respiration à mes cotés, je vois encore ses yeux, sa coiffure à la James Dean et son sourire gigantesque. - Tobey... Je vois l'eau et le soleil.. Un frisson remonte ma colonne vertébrale. Je ferme plus fort les paupières. - Demain..., je chuchote. - ... je vois Tobey regardant un phare. Je te vois, tu gagnes le De Leon ! - Je me fiche du De Leon, Pete. Je serre les poings, s'il était réellement là, il s'indignerait. C'est sûr. - Tobey, c'est ma vision ! Tu bats Dino, tu prends sa voiture et tu gagnes ! - Je t'aime, bonhomme, dis-je en un souffle. Deux ans. Deux ans de prison, ça fait réfléchir. Ça laisse le temps à la haine de se créer une place, à l'envie de vengeance de prendre racine, bien profondément, entre les tripes et le cœur. Et ça permet aux sentiments qui étaient restés enfouis jusque là de se révéler. - Je te l'ai jamais dit parce que je le savais pas. Mes yeux me brûlent, le tatouage à mon poignet semble pulser à chaque battement de mon cœur, à vif. Je me force à rire, comme s'il était vraiment là. Mon rire ressemble à un sanglot. - J'ai rencontré une fille. Elle sait que je suis complétement paumé sans toi mais elle... elle s'en fout, ris-je. J'essuie mes joues trempées de larmes avec ma manche. - Elle est barge. Je l'aime bien. L'épuisement me tombe dessus d'un seul coup. Deux ans à garder ça pour moi, le fait de le dire à voix haute me donne la sensation de revenir au jour de l'accident. L'eau glacée du fleuve, mes genoux en sang, la fumée qui me brûle les yeux, les mains crispées dans mes cheveux, les joues baignées de larmes et la gorge écorchée d'avoir trop hurlé, à regarder les flammes s'élever vers le ciel, les volutes noires s'échapper de l'habitacle emportant avec elles ce qui reste du garçon dont je suis tombé amoureux sans même m'en apercevoir. Pas avant qu'il ne soit trop tard. - Tobey... Je vois l'eau et le soleil... Je souris. - Demain, je répète. Je rouvre les yeux et la manche de mon sweat cache le tatouage. Je dors huit heures d'affilées. C'est la première fois depuis l'accident que je ne rêve pas de Pete. ... Je conduis jusqu'au lieu de la course le lendemain, à la surprise générale. Je descends de la Koenigsegg Agera rouge et je toque à la fenêtre de Dino. Les mâchoires serrées, il l'abaisse. - Tu aimes la voiture que j'ai amené ? Parce que je sais que les flics vont l'adorer. Le voir confus m'apporte de la satisfaction. - Au fait, je crois que c'est à toi. Je lui balance la bague de fiançailles que Anita m'a glissé dans la main avant de me glisser à l'oreille \"je ne peux pas rester avec celui qui a tué mon frère et m'a menti pendant deux ans\". Je retourne à ma bagnole et me glisse derrière le volant. Les battements de mon cœur sont assourdissants, je tire la manche de ma veste vers le bas. - Vois le bon coté des choses: tu m'as toujours. Je prends une inspiration et me concentre sur la course. ... Les concurrents sont évincés au fur et à mesure, à cause des flics, d'une mauvaise manip, d'un temps de réaction trop lents. Je suis patient. Et ça paye. En première position, j'attends de voir comment Dino va réagir face à Texas Mike. Et ce que je vois ne devrait pas m'étonner. Il tape l'arrière de son pare-choc et le fait quitter la route en un tonneau. On ne change pas une équipe qui gagne, pas vrai Dino ? Je fais exprès de perdre du terrain dans le tournant, je le laisse me passer devant. Je prends une inspiration, me force à ne pas céder à l'urgence. Il ne reste plus beaucoup de bitume avant l'arrivée. Je peux le battre. Une ouverture se présente enfin, je me glisse dans la brèche. Je le vois me regarder avec fureur. Il veut m'écraser, me réduire à néant. Je place mon pied au dessus du frein, je le nargue, j'attends. Je suis patient. Dino finit par faire une erreur, il donne un coup de volant pour me faire faire une sortie de route. J'appuie sur le frein de toutes mes forces. Dino perd le contrôle, rentre dans un buisson, fait des tonneaux. J'accélère. Mes yeux s'attardent dans le rétroviseur. Et je me fige, glacé. Parce que ce n'est pas la voiture de Dino que je vois mais celle de Pete, enflammée, réduite en pièces. J'imagine la peur qui l'a saisi lorsqu'il a compris que rien ni personne ne pourrait le sauver. Mon pied s'abat sur le frein. Je fais demi-tour. Je sors Dino de la carcasse de la voiture, je l'appuie contre un poteau en bois et je m'assure qu'il va bien avant de lui coller mon poing dans la gueule. Pour Pete. La sirène des flics retentit. Je remonte en voiture. J'ai une course à gagner. ... Je m'arrête. Mes mains se détendent sur le volant et je ferme les yeux une seconde. J'ai gagné le De Leon. J'ai amené à la police la preuve que Dino était coupable, elle est là, je la conduis. - Descendez de la voiture, les mains en l'air ! J'ouvre la portière, je descends. Quatre bagnoles de flics m'attendent, je lève les mains au ciel et je fais ce qu'on me dit, je m'allonge par terre, les mains au sol. En relevant la tête, la vue qui m'attend me coupe le souffle. Un phare. Blanc, gigantesque. Le soleil... et la mer, à perte de vue. - Je vois l'eau et le soleil... je vois Tobey, regardant un phare. Je te vois, tu gagnes le De Leon ! Ma gorge se noue, une larme m'échappe. ... 178 jours plus tard, je sors de prison. Une Mustang rouge vif se profile à l'horizon, elle s'arrête juste devant moi. C'est la copie conforme de la précédente. La fenêtre s'ouvre, je me penche pour regarder à l'intérieur. Julia est au volant, elle attend que j'entre. Je la regarde avec un sourire au coin des lèvres, elle est magnifique, son t-shirt troué laisse apercevoir des parcelles de peau. J'ai envie de passer mes doigts au travers pour la toucher. Elle perd patience: - Entre ! Je vais conduire. Je secoue la tête: - Je t'ai vu conduire et c'est terrifiant. La dernière fois, on a fini pendu au bout d'un hélicoptère US ARMY APACHE. Non, merci. Je fais le tour et prends sa place. Je relève la tête. Contrairement à ma dernière sortie de prison, le monde semble empli de couleurs. . Fin . . Voilà les gens ! C'était ma petite fic Need for Speed, j'espère qu'elle vous a plu. N'hésitez pas à laisser des reviews pour me dire ce que vous en avez pensé ;)[Chapter 2] Auteur: Swato Pairing: Tobey x Pete tout au long de l'histoire ; mais Tobey x Julia à la fin ^^ Disclaimers: Les personnages et l'univers de Need for Speed ne m'appartiennent pas. Note: Je sais, je saiiiiiis. J'avais dit que c'était fini mais... J'ai pas pu m'en empêcher, je suis accro ! Donc voilà la suite et FIN (normalement \") Note 2: Spoil bien sûr. Note 3 : J'aborde des thèmes assez lourd, notamment le deuil et la dépression. Si ce sont des sujets qui vous défrisent... vaut peut-être mieux passer votre chemin... NAN JE DÉCONNE, VENEZ LIRE ! XD Bonne lecture ! . . Je détends mes doigts sur le volant de la Mustang et ferme les yeux une micro-seconde. Comme à chaque fois que je m'apprête à me lancer dans une course, il y a un temps de battement. Un instant pendant lequel aucun son ne me parvient, juste le battement de mon cœur dans mes tempes, le sang qui pulse presque douloureusement dans mes veines, qui m'aide à me sentir vivant. C'est encore mieux que de se défoncer. Je rouvre les paupières. Finalement, le départ est donné. J'écrase la pédale de l'accélérateur. ... - Ça ne peut plus durer, Tobey, déclare Anita en croisant les bras. Je croise les bras sur mon torse et pose mes pieds sur le bureau. Mon bureau. J'examine le pot de crayon avec intérêt, les crayons à l'intérieur sont tous penché du même coté, sauf un. Un vieux stylos usé, le bout est pété, je suis pratiquement sûr qu'il n'écrit plus. Anita soupire avec agacement, s'approche et vire mes pieds du bureau. - Tobey ! Tu m'écoutes !? - Je vois pas de quoi tu te plains. J'ai gagné, il me semble, je rétorque. - Ce n'est pas la question ! Tu te mets en danger. Exprès. Le ton de Anita me fait grincer des dents, je lève les yeux au ciel: - C'est un peu le but des courses de rues. - Non. Le but des courses de rues, c'était de se faire de l'argent. Tu n'as plus besoin d'argent maintenant que tu as le garage. Et je le sais parce que je suis ta comptable , si tu te souviens bien ! Je grogne et enfouis une main dans mes cheveux. Bon sang, pas encore cette discussion. Je regrette presque de l'avoir embauché, ce qu'elle est énervante ! Je n'aurais jamais dû écouter Julia. Jamais. - Lâche l'affaire, Anita ! C'est au tour de Anita de grogner. Elle s'affale dans le siège en face de moi sans grâce aucune, sans se soucier des apparences pour une fois. Elle enlève ses chaussures à talons avec une grimace de douleur. Mes yeux sont toujours fixés sur ce fichu stylo qui ne veut pas pencher du même coté que les autres. - Il y a des limites à ce que je peux blanchir, Tob'. Et ça me rend mal à l'aise, tout cet argent. Je renifle avec amusement en me disant que quand c'était Dino, ça ne la dérangeait pas tant que ça. Elle semble suivre le cours de mes pensées et rougit avant de lisser les plis sur sa robe. J'ai envie de lui dire \"retourne dans ton bureau, bordel de merde\" mais je me mords l'intérieur de la joue et me tais. Un silence s'installe. - Tu n'arrives même pas à me regarder, pas vrai ? Dit-elle doucement. Sa voix est emplie de pitié et ça m'horripile. Je relève délibérément la tête pour la dévisager, ses cheveux longs ondulent sur ses épaules, elle est légèrement maquillée, la couleur de ses yeux en ressort d'autant plus. Un coup au cœur. Je détourne les yeux. - Oh, Tobey..., soupire t-elle. Je serre les mâchoires. Elle ne lui ressemble même pas tant que ça. Pas la même teinte de cheveux, pas la même forme du visage, pas la même couleur d'yeux. Mais d'une certaine manière, ils sont liés, sa démarche, son comportement, quelques tournures de phrases, expressions... - Est-ce que tu as pensé à aller voir quelqu... - Retourne bosser, je la coupe. - Tobe... Je bondis sur mes pieds et contourne le bureau. Si elle ne quitte pas la pièce, ça ne me pose aucun problème de sortir. J'ai besoin d'air de toute façon. ... Je passe deux jours sans personne, avec la Mustang, la route, à rouler, rouler... C'est un drôle de tête à tête mais l'idée de retrouver Julia à la maison me serrait l'estomac. ... - Je veux être le premier à te demander ça: est-ce que t'as perdu la tête ? Tu veux vraiment nous faire travailler pour Dino Brewster ? Se révolte Benny. - Mec, tu veux pas travailler pour cette petite merde, insiste Beast. - Oublie cet imbécile à col roulé, okay ? Dis-lui que tu refuses, on se débrouille très bien sans lui ! Appuie Finn. Je vous ai pas écouté les mecs, je m'en veux tellement. Si je n'avais pas accepté de réparer cette foutue Mustang pour lui, Dino serait retourné à Manhattan et aurait trouvé quelqu'un d'autre, Pete n'aurait pas participé à cette putain de course et il serait en vie. C'est de ma faute si Pete est mort. Ma faute. ... Quand je rentre, personne ne me fait remarquer mon absence. Je vais dans le local, prends ma première douche depuis mon départ, me change et grimace lorsque mes doigts râpent sur ma barbe de trois jours. Ça attendra. Benny travaille sur sa transmission radio, Beast sur la voiture d'un client, Flinn s'acharne sur la pièce d'un moteur et la porte du bureau de Anita est fermée. Tout est comme d'habitude. ... - Deux jours , Tobey. Deux jours sans nouvelles ! Ou pas. Julia tourne en rond dans le salon, les mains en l'air comme si elle n'en revenait pas. - Comment tu voulais que je réagisse, exactement ? Au matin, tu me dis \"à ce soir\" et puis tu disparais pendant deux jours ! Est-ce qu'elle pense que ça va s'arranger en répétant \"deux jours\" sans arrêt ? Je me frotte les tempes en espérant que le mal de tête qui s'est installé à l'arrière de mon crâne va finir par s'en aller. - Je sais pas, je grommèle. - Tu ne sais pas, répète t-elle, incrédule. J'ai essayé de te laisser souffler mais là c'est trop. J'étais inquiète, tout le monde était inquiet ! On se demandait ce qui s'était passé, si tu étais quelque part en train d'agoniser, ou alors si tu étais blessé, tu imagines le stress pour nous ? Ça commence à me gonfler. - C'est bon, faut arrêter avec tes scénarios catastrophe, j'ai jamais été en danger. - Et comment j'étais supposée le savoir vu que tu ne répondais pas à ton fichu portable ? - Merde, Julia ! J'explose. Mon éclat à le don de la faire taire. Je secoue la tête, exaspéré. - J'avais envie de conduire, j'ai pris la voiture et je suis parti, c'est aussi simple que ça. Julia secoue la tête, se passe la langue sur les lèvres et lève les yeux au ciel pour regarder le plafond, entre colère et tristesse. - J'en ai tellement marre de tes conneries, Tobey. Tu ne me parles pas, comment je suis censée savoir ce qui se passe, ce que tu veux... Qu'est-ce que tu veux, bon sang ? Demande t-elle. Qu'est-ce que je veux ? Qu'on me foute la paix, déjà. Ce serait géant. Julia s'essuie les joues et je réalise qu'elle s'est mise à pleurer. La culpabilité me tombe dessus tout aussi brusquement. Je suis qu'un connard, je foire tout ce que j'entreprends. Je pourrais dire quelque chose mais ça ne fera qu'empirer les choses alors je la ferme. Julia prend une inspiration pour se calmer et plante son regard dans le mien: - Réfléchis et décide toi, Marshall. Parce que j'ai beau être patiente, je vais pas t'attendre indéfiniment. Et sur ce, elle prend sa veste de s'en va. ... Le lendemain, au bureau, je prend le stylo cassé et pose la pointe contre le papier pour signer un chèque. Il n'a plus d'encre. Il n'écrit plus. Je ne sais même pas pourquoi j'ai essayé, je savais très bien qu'il était inutile. Je le jette à la poubelle. ... ... Aïe... Putain ... La sueur, le sang et la douleur. Tout ça c'est bien réel. ... Il y a cette jolie fille qui vient parfois au café, elle s'installe toujours à la même place, bien habillée, élégante et peut-être un peu précieuse dans sa gestuelle. Elle ouvre un livre et sirote son capuchino comme si elle avait tout le temps du monde, les habitués passent à coté d'elle sans la voir, comme si elle faisait partie du décor. Comment ils font ? Elle a l'air spéciale. Je fais mes pauses ici et je la regarde. C'est en face du garage, ils passent de la bonne musique, le café est correct et pas cher. Il me faut un mois avant de trouver en moi le courage d'aller l'aborder, je m'assois en face d'elle avec une assurance que je ne ressens pas, elle relève les yeux des pages de son livre et hausse un sourcil, un sourire perplexe au coin des lèvres. Je jette un coup d'œil à la couverture de son bouquin: - Les hauts de hurlevent ? - Tu sais lire, me fait-elle remarquer avec amusement. Je lève les yeux au ciel avec bonne humeur et montre le livre d'un geste du menton. - Tu t'infliges ça volontairement ou c'est une lecture obligatoire pour tes études ? - Tu n'aimes pas ? - Tu réponds souvent aux questions des gens par d'autres questions ? - Seulement quand ils insultent mes choix de lecture, sourit-elle. Elle tourne une page et prend une gorgée de son café avec désinvolture. Bon dieu, ce qu'elle me plait. Je souris et me passe une main dans les cheveux: - C'est un bon bouquin. Même si je trouve la vengeance de Heathcliff assez mélo. Elle penche la tête sur le coté et me lance un coup d'œil par dessus les pages, intéressée. Le livre finit sur la table, fermé. Je tends la main: - Tobey. Elle sourit, ses yeux pétillent avec malice: - Je sais. Tu as une petite réputation dans le coin. Je baisse les yeux sur ma main tendue avec insistance, elle glisse la sienne entre mes doigts, délicate: - Anita. ... - Entre, j'en ai pour une seconde. Anita me fait entrer dans l'appartement avec une moue contrite. La télé est allumé et un ado est assis devant, une manette à la main, il se débat avec un jeu vidéo, une expression concentrée sur le visage. Anita suit mon regard et me sourit: - C'est mon frère. Pete ! Tiens compagnie à Tobey pendant que je vais me changer, tu veux ? Pete ne lève pas les yeux de son jeu, il lève les coudes comme si ça pouvait l'aider à mieux manœuvrer la voiture à l'écran. Anita disparait dans le couloir avec un sourire et je hausse une épaule. Quitte à attendre, autant me mettre à l'aise. Je m'affale à coté de son frère, il remarque enfin ma présence. - Oh, hey, me salue t-il sans interrompre son jeu. Tobey, c'est ça ? - Hm hm... Je le regarde jouer, un petit silence s'installe. Le silence ne me dérange pas, je n'ai jamais été du genre très bavard. Je fronce le nez: - Si tu prenais tes virages plus courts, tu gagnerais au moins une longueur d'avance à chaque fois. Pete m'adresse un rapide coup d'œil et prend mon conseil en considération. Au prochain virage, il gagne une place dans le classement. Un sourire content étire ses lèvres, il met sur pause et se tourne vers moi avec les sourcils froncés avant de me dévisager. Il est marrant ce gamin. Il me montre sa manette: - Tu veux jouer ? - Ouais, pourquoi pas. Il me passe sa manette et prend celle qui traine sur la table basse. - Tu vas t'en mordre les doigts ! - C'est ce qu'on va voir. On joue depuis dix bonnes minutes quand Anita revient dans le salon. Elle croise les bras sur sa poitrine et secoue la tête: - J'aurais dû savoir que vous présenter était une très mauvaise idée. Pete se marre et me donne un coup de coude: - Je vais te piquer ton petit-copain, Nita. Il est bon à ce jeu ! - Sûrement parce que c'est Tobey Marshall, répond t-elle avec un sourire. Le jeu se met soudainement sur pause, je me tourne vers Pete avec surprise. Il me regarde avec des yeux ronds comme des soucoupes, au grand amusement de Anita. - Tobey Marshall ? Comme dans Marshall Motors ? Demande t-il avec espoir. - Hmm... Je fronce les sourcils et envoie une œillade inquisitrice à Anita, elle me répond en détournant la tête avec un sourire. La traitresse. - Oui ? Je réponds. Ma réponse décroche la mâchoire de Tobey, il se laisse tomber en arrière sur le canapé avec un long soupir extatique. - Maintenant c'est officiel. Nita, tu vas devoir partager ton rencard avec moi maintenant. Garde partagée ? - Un week-end sur deux. - Un week-end sur deux et un jour de la semaine ! Marchande Pete en se redressant. Anita penche la tête sur le coté pensivement. Je me demande dans quoi je suis tombé. - Vendu ! Déclare t-elle avec un sourire. - Est-ce que je devrais flipper ? Pete et Anita se contentèrent d'éclater de rire à ma mine perdue. ... Le soleil tape fort mais le vent empêche de ressentir réellement sa chaleur, les vagues s'écrasent sur le sable, trop fort pour qu'on puisse aller se baigner. Allongé, j'étends les bras, le sable rappe sur ma peau, il est agréablement tiède. A coté de moi, Pete a fait un bonhomme des neiges version sable, il est au milieu, il ne manque plus que l'auréole et l'illusion serait complète. Quand j'ai appris qu'il n'avait jamais vu la mer, il fallait que je l'amène. Ma Ford Gran Torino nous attend patiemment sur la digue, Pete a passé le trajet à toucher à tous les boutons de la radio, excité comme une puce. Après avoir fait quelques pas dans l'eau, il s'est vite calmé avant de s'écrouler au sol comme un idiot. Et nous voilà. - T'as toujours voulu faire de la compétition ? Me demande t-il soudainement. Sa question me prend de court, je fronce les sourcils et y réfléchis. - Mon père tient le garage depuis que je suis gamin, c'est lui qui m'a mis le pied à l'étrier je suppose. - Mais est-ce que tu conduis parce que tu aimes ça ou... - J'adore ça, je le coupe. Ce n'est peut-être pas ce que je voulais faire quand j'étais gosse, je me souviens avoir entretenu une envie de devenir pompier ou alors policier ? Peut-être bien cowboy aussi. Mais me retrouver derrière le volant d'une caisse, rouler à fond ? C'est ce qui me faisait me sentir vivant. Pete me jette une poignée de sable qui atterrit sur ma main, je ris. - Pourquoi tu me demandes ça ? Je me tourne vers lui au moment où il hausse une épaule. Il a l'air pensif: - Je sais pas. Je me disais que vous aviez tous un avenir tracé d'une certaine façon. - Qu'est-ce que tu veux dire ? - Ben... Il se redresse sur un coude et replie les jambes contre lui pour me faire face. Ses mains jouent avec le sable, il trace des ronds dedans sans vraiment me regarder. - Vous êtes tous des pro de la mécanique mais vous avez chacun vos spécialités en quelque sorte. Benny vole et te donne les itinéraires, Beast et Finn s'occupent des détails techniques et tu pilotes comme un dieu. - Petey, je souris. - Nan, sérieusement, insiste t-il. Son expression se plisse, comme si quelque chose le chiffonnait. Je crois savoir quoi, je laisse un silence s'installer et joins les mains sous ma tête avec décontraction: - Ça nous a pris des années pour en arriver là. Benny n'a pas toujours été doué pour voler, ni pour me guider, Beast et Finn pareil... - Non, ce que je veux dire c'est que... vous savez où vous vous situez, ce que vous aimez faire. Sacré gamin, toujours extatique pour tout et n'importe quoi mais flippé pour un rien. - Encore une fois: ça nous a pris des années. T'es encore jeune, t'as le temps de découvrir ce que tu aimes faire. - J'aime conduire, répond t-il, la voix ferme. Je souris, il me fait penser à un mini James Dean, avec des rêves pleins la tête et une flamme dans les yeux que rien ne semble pouvoir éteindre. - Alors conduis. Le sourire qu'il me renvoi est ridicule. Je me lève brusquement, le soulève et le balance sur mon épaule pour aller le foutre à la flotte. Lorsqu'il réapparait à la surface en fronçant le nez et me faisant signer d'approcher, je m'exécute sans me poser de question. Ce n'est qu'en le voyant gonfler les joues et en recevant une gerbe d'eau salée à la figure que je réalise mon erreur. Il éclate de rire, je le pousse à l'épaule et il tombe sur les fesses, toujours aussi hilare. Impossible de ne pas craquer et de ne pas rire à mon tour. ... A force de traîner au garage avec nous, Pete en apprend plus que n'importe qui sur la mécanique, il est naturellement doué, comme s'il avait été élevé dans le garage avec moi. Pour son dix-huitième anniversaire, Beast, Benny, Finn et moi lui avons préparé une surprise de taille. Quand Anita arrive avec lui, mon père nous prévient et nous rejoint tous. Pete fronce les sourcils avec un petit sourire perdu et nous regarde tour à tour. - Quoi ? Demande t-il avec un rire dans la voix. On se décale pour dévoiler une Chevrolet Camaro 396 flambant neuve. - Bon anniversaire ! - Joyeux anniversaire, mon pote ! Les yeux de Pete s'écarquillent avant de chercher les miens, l'air de dire \"Sérieux ?\". Je souris et lui balance les clefs qu'il ne rattrape que par réflexe. Il s'approche lentement, comme si la voiture allait lui mordre les fesses ou disparaître. Il en fait le tour et l'effleure du bout des doigts avant de se pencher pour regarder le tableau de bord en se mordant les lèvres. Benny lui énumère tous les changements que nous avons fait dessus, Beast mordille son cure-dent en levant les yeux au ciel tandis que Finn bombe fièrement le torse avec un sourire idiot. Anita se poste à mes cotés, me sourit et entremêle ses doigts aux miens. Pete finit par réaliser et bondit sur tout le monde comme un chiot en manque d'affection. - Je pense que ça lui plait, rit Anita. - Tu crois ? Je rétorque en reniflant avec amusement. Pete se tourne vers moi, les yeux brillants, il prononce silencieusement \"meeeec\", fou de joie. Je lui montre la bagnole du menton: - Tu devrais la prendre et faire un tour avec elle. - C'est un \"il\", pas une \"elle\", mon pote, se plaint Benny. - Une minute, avant que vous partiez, j'ai encore un cadeau pour Pete. Je me tourne avec surprise vers mon père. Pete rougit: - Je pense que j'ai été assez gâté comme ça, Monsieur Marshall, proteste t-il. - Ne t'en fais pas, c'est juste une formalité, vraiment. Alors... Qu'est-ce que tu dirais de venir bosser ici après les cours ? De façon officielle ? Les gars se regardent entre eux avec un étonnement ravi. Pete en perd ses mots, j'avoue que j'ai du mal à trouver les miens aussi. - Vous... Vous m'embauchez ? Bafouille t-il. - Si ça ne nuit pas à tes études... - Ça sera pas le cas ! Affirme Pete en fixant mon père avec espoir. - Alors dans ce cas oui. Le regard qu'il a... C'est comme si c'était le plus beau jour de sa vie. - Merci, Monsieur Marshall ! - De rien, fiston. Passe dans mon bureau lundi, j'ai un contrat à te faire signer, sourit-il. Je souris à mon père qui se contente d'ébouriffer les cheveux de Pete et de me donner une tape affectueuse sur l'épaule. - J'ai du travail, je vous rejoins tout à l'heure, dit-il avant de retourner à son bureau. - Allez, mec ! On doit absolument l'essayer ! S'excite Benny. Pete sautille sur place et me montre les clefs avec espièglerie avant de se précipiter vers la portière conducteur de sa toute nouvelle voiture. - Tu viens !? Je me tourne vers Anita tandis que les gars s'entassent à l'arrière en se poussant et en grommelant. Elle me sourit et hoche la tête: - Vas-y, je serais au café d'en face, dit-elle avec un clin d'œil entendu. Mes doigts abandonnent les siens et je grimpe dans la voiture, à coté de mon meilleur ami. Accoudé à la fenêtre, le paysage de Mount Kisco défilant au fil des kilomètres de bitume avalés, mes yeux s'attardent sur le sourire béat de Pete lorsqu'il soupire: - C'est de loin le meilleur anniversaire de toute ma vie. ... Ouvrir les yeux ne m'a jamais paru aussi difficile. Bon dieu, qui a décrété que le soleil devait briller si fort ? Je grogne et plisse les paupières. Où est-ce que je suis ? Un rideau bleu délavé, une chaise dans un coin, c'est plutôt vide ici mais je reconnais une chambre d'hôpital quand j'en vois une. Je grogne une fois de plus. Alors ça y est, je l'ai eut ce fameux accident qui me pendait au nez. Il ne me reste plus qu'à évaluer les dégâts. J'examine mon corps avec la minutie d'un médecin bigleux, fronce le nez en voyant le plâtre qui recouvre ma jambe de mi-cuisse jusqu'aux orteils, mon regard remonte plus haut jusqu'à ma main dont l'index et le majeur sont collés et coincés dans une atèle. Je me sens des éraflures et des coupures un peu partout et j'ai un mal de crâne terrible, des nausées et si j'en crois les meubles qui font des vagues sous mes yeux, des vertiges aussi. En conclusion: il semblerait que mon coté gauche ait morflé. Ma question suivante est: mais bordel, qu'est-ce qui s'est passé ? Je me doute qu'une course a mal tourné mais je ne me souviens plus du tout de ce qui m'a cloué ici. Est-ce que j'ai merdé ? Est-ce qu'un connard m'a coupé la route ou rentré dedans ? Impossible de me rappeler. La porte s'ouvre au bout d'une heure, j'en ai profité pour appuyer comme un dingue sur la pompe à morphine. Ce qui m'entoure perd un peu en netteté mais je m'en fous royalement. Une infirmière entre, me dit avec le sourire que j'ai une commotion de grade 5 ( aucune idée de ce que c'est mais ça a l'air sérieux ), me montre la pompe à morphine ( merci, j'ai vu et j'en fais bon usage ) et m'informe qu'un médecin va passer me voir dans la matinée ( ok, génial ). J'ai du me rendormir. Forcément vu que quand j'ouvre les paupières pour la deuxième fois, un médecin me secoue comme un prunier en me promettant une batterie de test ( ça, c'est de la menace, mec ) et en me posant dix milles questions/minutes. Bon dieu, il faut que je descende qui pour avoir la paix ? ... Julia est là. De toutes les personnes susceptibles de me rendre visite, je ne m'attendais pas à la voir, elle. Elle me dévisage durement et le poids de son regard me hérisse les poils, il semble dire \"voilà, j'en étais sûre\". J'ai envie de lui répondre \"A quoi tu t'attendais en te mettant avec un pilote de course ?\" ou Comme si tu ne savais pas d'où viens toute cette merde\" ou encore \"Voilà, la vue te plait ? La porte est là-bas\" mais ma bouche reste close. A quoi bon ? Le médecin finit par arriver pour donner son topo. Pied et jambe cassés en de nombreux endroits, genou explosé, doigts cassés et articulations déviées, commotion cérébrale de grade 5 avec perte de conscience d'une journée entière, wow ! Et ma dernière question sans réponse: - Qu'est-ce qui s'est passé ? Le médecin jette un coup d'œil à Julia qui s'est postée dos à la fenêtre, les bras croisés et les yeux dans le vague, perdue dans ses pensées. - Vos amis vous ont amené ici suite à une tentative de suicide. Impossible. Tentative de suicide ? N'importe quoi. Ça me ressemble pas du tout. Je me tourne vers Julia, sourcils froncés: - Quoi ?! Elle semble revenir au présent, décroise les bras et se déplie comme une carte routière fatiguée, sans ordre. Les cernes sous ses yeux sont énormes, comment elle fait pour tenir debout en ayant l'air si épuisée ? Julia soupire: - Tu t'es mis au milieu de la route. Beast et Finn ont donné un coup de volant au dernier moment mais ils t'ont quand même percuté. Tu t'es jeté sous leurs roues, Tobey, crache t-elle, des larmes dans la voix. Le médecin lui lance un sourire triste, elle se détourne. Le choc m'envahit par vague. Je n'y crois pas. Moi ? Tenter de me suicider ? Ça ne colle pas. - Je suis pas suicidaire, dis-je avec fermeté. - Le déni est une phase de la dépression... Il n'y a aucune honte à... - Puisque je vous dis que je suis pas suicidaire ! Une douleur aiguë explose dans ma tête et mes derniers mots sont étouffés par un gémissement. Je ferme les yeux et me force à respirer par le nez. Il n'est pas impossible que je vomisse dans les minutes qui suivent. Le médecin bafouille, me dit de me reposer et qu'on en reparlera plus tard avant de poser un bassin à coté de ma tête. Je dois avoir viré au vert pour être si transparent. Julia me lance un dernière œillade avant de quitter la pièce. Mes doigts agrippent le lit médicalisé avec force. ... Beast, Benny et Finn trouvent le temps de venir me voir mais c'est gênant. C'est comme de se retrouver à poils devant une foule de personne et ses parents en prime. Ou alors de se faire surprendre par ses parents avec une jolie fille. Je donnerais tout pour être ailleurs quand Beast doit me tendre une serviette parce que j'ai dégueulé sur le sol avant d'avoir eut le temps de prendre le bassin, quand Finn se sent obligé de blaguer pour détendre l'atmosphère et quand Benny ne croise même pas mon regard plus d'une seconde. Un trou dans le sol, une autre planète, n'importe où. Mais ailleurs. ... Un psy passe dans ma chambre. Un putain de psy. - Vous ne pourrez pas quitter l'hôpital tant que je n'aurais pas défini s'il y a des risques que vous attentiez de nouveau à vos jours. - Je n'ai pas tenté de me suicider, je répète pour la millième fois. - Peut-être tentiez-vous de mettre fin à vos souffrances sans pour autant avoir consciemment en tête de vous tuer. Je ferais mieux de prendre mes aises. Ça risque d'être long. ... C'est le dixième jour de mon hospitalisation que tout me revient. Une nouvelle course. Je ferme les yeux, prends le temps de sentir le sang bouillonner dans mes veines à la perspective de ce qui attend dans les rues. Le moteur rugit quand j'appuie sur la pédale d'accélérateur. Les virages sont serrés, le trafic est intense, je me faufile sans me préoccuper du fait que je défie la prudence, que mes manœuvres sont dangereuses. J'ai l'impression d'être défoncé, dans un brouillard hors du temps. Je ne pense pas, à rien en dehors des voitures, des dangers qui m'entourent, je suis conscient et pas du tout à la fois, perdu dans un univers de vitesse, d'opportunités et de coups bas. Ça ne m'étonne pas quand je suis percuté de plein fouet par une Porsche et que la voiture se retourne. C'était presque écrit dans les étoiles. Beast, Benny, Finn, Julia... Ils ont menti. Je le savais. ... - Vous mentez tous. - On ne ment pas, Tobey, soupire Julia. Je la toise avec défi. J'attends qu'elle me mente, en me regardant droit dans les yeux. Et elle le fait: - Tu t'es jeté sous les roues de Beast, il a... - Il a fait une embardé mais il m'a quand même touché, hm ? Je récite. - Oui, c'est ça. - Je me souviens. Elle referme la bouche. Je la dévisage avec l'impression que je ne la connais plus. Julia se passe une main sur la figure et s'assoit sur le siège à mon chevet. Ses cheveux blonds sont emmêlés et ses yeux bleus paraissent brouillés. - Tu te souviens, répète t-elle bêtement. - Ça m'est revenu hier. La course, la porshe qui me rentre dedans... Ma voiture s'est retournée. - Tout le monde a paniqué, ils ont déserté les lieux et ils t'ont laissé pour mort sans te sortir de la, poursuit Julia. Quand on est arrivé, la Mustang commençait à prendre feu et tu étais toujours à l'intérieur. Les paroles coulent de sa bouche comme un aveu, elle marque une pause, perdue dans ses souvenirs. Je ne me rappelle que de la voiture qui se retourne et de ma tête qui heurte le volant. - On t'a fait sortir, Finn a éteint le feu... On savait que tu retournerais en taule si on appelait une ambulance en disant que tu avais eut un accident pendant une course alors Benny a bougé la Mustang et Anita a trouvé cette histoire de tentative de suicide. Julia s'essuie les joues mais elles sont sèches. - Tu avais besoin d'aide et ça semblait parfait alors on a tous suivi. Je ne regrette pas, s'il fallait mentir encore, je le referais. Quand on t'a sorti de la Mustang... J'ai cru que tu étais mort. Elle se replie sur elle-même, les bras enroulés autour de sa poitrine comme si on lui avait donné un coup de poing dans le cœur. A bout de souffle, Julia relève ses yeux bleus vers moi, elle donne la sensation de se noyer. - Tu ne conduis plus de la même façon, Tobey. Avant, tu mesurais les risques, tu choisissais tes manœuvres... Mais maintenant ? Tu fonces tête baissée comme si tu voulais... Je détourne le regard, elle s'interrompt. L'horloge murale nous assomme de son tic-tac, égraine les secondes et compte les minutes qui nous séparent de sa phrase restée en suspens. Les yeux fixés sur le mur en face de moi, je visualise ce qu'elle n'a pas prononcé, ma voiture emboutie contre un mur, le sol ou une autre bagnole, avec moi toujours à l'intérieur, réduit en charpie. Un barrage saute. Pas parce que je panique à l'idée de ce qui aurait pu arriver, non. Au contraire. Le barrage saute parce que pendant une fraction de seconde, l'idée de ma tête défoncée contre le volant apporte avec elle un sentiment d'intense satisfaction. Wow... Ok. Peut-être bien que j'ai besoin d'aide finalement. ... Le lendemain, je profite que personne ne soit là pour récupérer mes affaires. M'habiller n'est pas une mince affaire avec mon plâtre et ma main handicapée mais j'y parviens au bout d'un moment. Je me glisse hors de l'hôpital et retrouve ma liberté. ... Le vent est violent. La voiture que j'ai volé est garée un peu plus haut, sur la digue. Mes béquilles s'enlisent dans le sable, je les abandonne derrière moi et continue à marcher droit sur les vagues. Mes paupières se ferment et j'entends le rire de Pete, ce n'est plus qu'un écho. Je m'enfonce dans l'eau jusqu'à la taille, les embruns de la mer mouillent mon visage, forment des sillons sur mes joues. Une inspiration et je me laisse couler. Le calme m'envahit. Paupières closes, je débats silencieusement. Une pièce vient d'être lancée en l'air, j'attends de voir de quel coté elle va retomber. Pile, la vie ? Face, la mort ? - On se débarrasse pas de moi comme ça, Tob'. A qui le dis-tu, vieux. A qui le dis-tu. - J'espère que t'es pas trop déçu. Tu me connais, je peux jamais t'en vouloir. Je veux pas me débarrasser de toi, Petey. Je veux vivre avec ton souvenir à défaut de pouvoir t'avoir à mes cotés, bien vivant. - Désolé... T'y es pour rien, bonhomme. C'est de ma faute. Je m'en veux... Attendre la mort n'a pas l'air si mal, c'est calme ici. - Comme si ça allait arriver ! Pete... - Je reste ici. Mais pas moi ? - Nan, sérieusement. Rabats-joie. - Vois le bon coté des choses: tu m'as toujours. Un sourire étire mes lèvres. Sacré, Pete. Je donne un coup de pied au fond avec mon pied valide pour remonter à la surface. - Je m'en remettrai. ... Je rentre au garage en taxi. Le chauffeur a pitié du gars trempé qui galère avec ses béquilles. Il fait nuit quand j'arrive, je me glisse à l'intérieur sans faire de bruit mais personne n'est là. Je vais prendre une douche chaude et passe des vêtements secs. Au fond de la boutique, il y a une voiture que j'évite d'approcher et que personne n'ose toucher. Aujourd'hui, je m'avance assez pour la toucher. La Chevrolet Camaro SS 396 de Pete. Mes doigts l'effleurent, comme l'avait fait Pete avant d'oser monter et l'amener faire un tour. La peinture est nickel, Benny avait mis des heures à s'assurer qu'elle soit parfaite. Il y a un accro sur le capot, souvenir d'une course où elle a échappé de peu à un carambolage. J'en fais le tour et j'évalue ses imperfections mais elle en possède peu, Pete était prudent, il adorait sa voiture. Mon pied bute contre un pied de biche qui traine, mes yeux restent bloqués dessus. Ma peau commence à me démanger furieusement, quelque chose bout à l'intérieur de moi, ça vient des tripes et ça s'étend, me monte à la tête, amer et si acide que ça en devient douloureux. Puis avant que je puisse comprendre quoi que ce soit, mes doigts se referment sur le pied de biche et je frappe . Le pare-brise éclate comme si la vitre était faite en sucre cristallisé, comme dans les films. Ma main gauche brûle comme les flammes de l'enfer mais je ne m'arrête pas, je ne peux pas. Je frappe, frappe, encore et encore, le capot, les rétro, les vitres... Et quand ça n'est pas suffisant pour apaiser le monstre qui gronde dans ma poitrine, je hurle jusqu'à ne plus avoir de voix. Pete, Pete, Pete... Petey. Le pied de biche échappe de mes mains fatiguées. A bout de souffle, je m'assois au milieu des éclats et contemple mon travail. La démangeaison est partie, ma respiration se calme. La Chevrolet Camaro est méconnaissable, elle est en piteux état. Voilà comment tu nous as laissé tous les deux, Pete. ... Le lendemain, les gars débarquent à 8h30, j'ai débarrassé le sol de tous les éclats de verre. Beast mâchouille un cure-dent en me toisant avec prudence, Finn croise les bras sur son torse en levant le menton, tout sourire, Benny s'approche, volubile comme à son habitude et me donne une tape sur l'épaule: - Comment tu te sens, mec ? Beast grimace et Finn se crispe, ce n'est pas la question qu'ils redoutent mais bien ma réponse. Je prends une minute pour y penser. Ma main me fait un mal de chien, ma jambe est raide, coincée dans ce stupide plâtre, la terre a tendance à tourner aux moments les plus malvenus et c'est comme si je m'étais éclaté le crâne contre un mur. Pourtant... Un poids s'est enlevé de ma poitrine. Les gars attendent toujours ma réponse, je finis par répondre, honnêtement: - Mieux. ... Je passe la matinée à réparer la voiture de Pete, il y a du boulot, j'en ai pour au moins un mois. Et demi. Les gars sont venus me donner un coup de main pendant leur pause, silencieux mais avec un air entendu. La fatigue me tombe dessus soudainement, j'ai à peine la force de me traîner jusqu'au canapé dans le coin détente avant de sombrer. Lorsque je me réveille, je remarque que quelqu'un s'est donné la peine de poser une couverture sur moi, il est tard mais je suis sûr que je peux encore emmagasiner dix heures de sommeil de plus. Ce qui me pousse à me lever, c'est la voix que j'entends, pas loin. Je fais quelques pas avec l'aide d'une de mes béquilles, lourdement appuyé dessus à cause de la vague de vertige qui m'assaille. Aouch. Je m'appuie contre le montant de la porte. Anita est à la porte du garage, son sac à main sur l'épaule, prête à partir, Julia toujours à l'intérieur. Des fois, c'est bizarre de voir sa copine actuelle avec son ex. Surtout quand on ne sait pas si la copine actuelle est toujours d'actualité ou si elle aussi est devenue une ex. Anita m'aperçoit, elle me lance un petit sourire qui ressemble à une grimace, dit quelque chose à Julia et s'éclipse. Je reste là où je suis, pas certain de parvenir à lâcher mon ancrage pour le moment. Julia se retourne et son regard tombe sur moi. Elle joint les mains devant elle, hésitante. - Tu es réveillé. - Ouais. Je pose ma béquille contre le mur, Julia me dévisage. Un silence tendu s'installe entre nous, je me passe une main dans les cheveux et décide de le rompre. - T'avais raison. - Je sais, j'ai toujours raison, répond t-elle avec un sourire taquin. La tension réduit et je lui rends son sourire. Perdu dans mes émotions, j'ai perdu de vue une chose importante: j'aime Julia. Vraiment. Même si le fantôme de Pete sera toujours là, une partie de moi. Je vais devoir apprendre à vivre avec, mais Julia n'est pas obligée de faire la même chose. Elle penche la tête sur le coté: - Sur quoi est-ce que j'ai raison, cette fois-ci ? - J'ai besoin d'aide. Julia fronce les sourcils en se rapprochant: - Mais... tu as quitté l'hôpital..., commence t-elle avec perplexité. - Non, l'aide dont j'ai besoin, je l'ai déjà. Son expression s'éclaire, ses yeux se plantent dans les miens, toujours aussi bleus, plus bleus que les miens. Je remet une de ses mèches folles en place et le nœud dans mon estomac se dénoue lorsqu'elle ne me repousse pas. - J'avais juste... pas remarqué. Mes yeux accrochent la Chevrolet Camaro de Pete, ma gorge se serre. - Je sais que c'est hyper égoïste ce que je vais dire mais... Je croyais que j'étais tout seul. - Non, je comprends... La main de Julia se pose sur ma joue, mes yeux lâchent la voiture pour l'examiner. Sa bouche est pincée en une ligne fine, de tristesse, pas de colère. - Mais tu ne l'es pas. Seul, je veux dire, reprend t-elle, maladroitement. - Je sais. Je prends sa main et la retire gentiment de ma joue. Parce que ce que je vais dire n'est pas agréable à entendre, mais elle doit l'entendre. Ses sourcils se froncent d'autant plus. - Je ne sais pas si je peux être avec toi. J'en ai envie, mais ce serait dégueulasse de ma part de te retenir alors que je sais pas où je vais... ou si je vais quelque part, dis-je avec un petit rire dépréciateur. Julia ne se laisse pas démonter, elle me regarde avec attention, elle attend. Je ne sais pas comment elle fait, mais elle sait que je n'ai pas fini. Je montre la voiture de Pete de ma main défoncée, elle et moi tout aussi détruits l'un que l'autre. - Il est là... et il sera toujours là. Il ne va nulle part. Son regard suit ma main et s'arrête sur la voiture. Elle la fixe un long moment, en pleine réflexion. Je garde le silence, je me sens vidé et léger à la fois. J'ai déballé tout ce que j'avais sur la conscience, aux morts et aux vivants. Julia se tourne finalement pour me regarder, un brasier brille dans ses yeux. - Moi non plus. Je ne vais nulle part. Ça a le don de me surprendre. Je ne m'attendais pas à ça du tout. Qui accepterait de partager quelqu'un avec un fantôme ? Julia apparemment. Elle hausse un sourcils et penche la tête sur le coté, l'air de me défier de la contredire. Je ne peux que soulever mon bras pour la serrer lorsqu'elle se glisse contre moi, j'enfouis mon nez dans ses cheveux et je respire son odeur. - Je crois que je vais pas tarder à m'écrouler, si je reste debout, j'avoue à voix basse. Elle rit et passe un bras sous le mien pour me soutenir tandis que je m'appuie sur la béquille avec l'autre. - Allez viens, on rentre. Je conduis. Je grogne longuement pour lui faire comprendre ce que je pense de ses talents de conductrice. Julia sourit, je la vois sourire du coin de l'œil, malicieusement. Elle est belle quand elle sourit. .

Une review pour cette suite inattendue ? :) ","Summary":" Auteur: Swato Pairing: Tobey x Pete tout au long de l'histoire ; mais Tobey x Julia à la fin ^^ Dis"},{"Movie":"Need for Speed","Title":"Rekindling the Route Home","Author":"Littleditmiss","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10929023","Passage":"[Chapter 1] A/N: I'm British so I apologise for any inaccuracies regarding American prisons, states and landmarks. I should probably say that I read this trip cross country in Top Gear magazine and so I have used their route as a base of mine with a few adaptations. I don't own need for speed, the characters, cars (God I wish I owned the cars!) but I do own a copy of the DVD so... yay. This starts right at the end of the movie when Tobey gets into the Mustang. Sorry for babbling on, I hope you enjoy and please review! P.S: I think this will be a three maybe four-parter, I'm not going into all the details of the entire trip or I'd never finish and I have coursework to do. Day #1 Utah to Arizona. Julia slides over, her painstakingly straightened hair tickling her back as she flips her head to the left, watching as the recently released Tobey Marshall opens the door of her new red mustang and sits himself comfortably into the seat that she had only just occupied. She had known that he would have wanted to drive, it had been months since he'd found himself behind the wheel after all and his only real reference to her driving skills were while they were being ambushed and shot at, so she didn't blame him for being terrified at the thought of the blonde behind the wheel. So Julia had slid over, without complaint. \"Nice ride,\" Tobey says, his voice as horse and rough as she had remembered it, a small and signature smirk hitching at the corner of his mouth as his calloused fingers wrap around the wheel, his foot finding the gas and the Ford Mustang GT speeds off into the horizon. \"It's new,\" Julia's unique portrayal of a British accent speaks across the roar of the 5.0 litre V-8 engine, \"Isn't she beautiful? Almost as nice as the last Mustang.\" Tobey lets out a throaty laugh, \"Speaking of, was your boss pissed?\" Julia thinks back to when she arrived at her boss' office with her arm in a cast, having to explain to him that his legendary Shelby was no more, and not only that but if he wanted Tobey Marshall to be the one to fix it alongside his team, he'd have quite a wait. But either way, after he ranted and raved and cursed the sky, he calmed down and bargained that with or without Tobey, Marshall motors would be fixing up the remains precisely as they were – for free of course – and he still wanted his $4millon worth of prize winning cars, also built back up by the team that at the time only consisted of Finn and Joe. She hesitates before answering, \"You could say that.\" And they race towards Utah, mostly in silence with Finn's voice popping up every now and again with mile markers and unhelpful tips, not to mention the occasional inappropriate comment about Tobey and Julia refraining from pulling over and getting it on in the middle of the highway, which was greatly unappreciated by both parties, Finn totally oblivious to the fact that apart from that kiss in the hospital, and a collection of chaste moments when Julia visited Tobey in prison, the two hadn't exactly 'christened' their relationship. \"Beast on target, parked and waiting,\" Finn shouts over the communication line, only bringing more attention to the Mustang's lateness, \"and you've got twenty minutes to get here beauty, so step on it.\" As Tobey presses down on the gas and the red car becomes a blur in the landscape, Julia checks the time on her phone, \"Twenty three minutes actually.\" Joe scoffs, \"Yeah, yeah, whatever. Just be here.\" And thanks to Tobey's foot never easing and the roads being clear, they pull up outside the prison in what Julia names 'nineteen minutes.' The Mustang pulls up behind where Finn and Joe have haphazardly parked on the road opposite the heavily guarded exit. The drivers of the Super Duty make their way out of the vehicle, pulling Tobey into a hug and Finn sends a wink towards Julia as she sits herself on the hood of the car, the heat of the shining metal burning her through the black material of her ripped skinny jeans. Tobey, dressed in the same shade of purple jeans and white top he wore the day of De Leon, pulls away from the boys and jumps onto the hood next to Julia as Joe and Finn mimic the motion on their own black vehicle. They make small talk for two minutes, Finn asking how it feels to be back on the outside along with questioning if they were running late due to pulling into a layby to 'reconnect' as he had so lightly put it, and Joe goes deeper, ensuring Tobey's head was in the right place. But this wasn't like the last time, sure that pain of Pete's death still stuck with him, and would always stay with him, but he had justice now, and Dino was behind bars, that was enough for him. They had just brought up the conversation of the sparkling new red GT when they heard a familiar, and missed voice call to them. \"Damn, look at that booty on that beauty.\" Four heads whip towards the sound and see Benny standing behind silver wire in the shape of a fence as a door of the same material slides from in front of him and he is welcomed back into the world of free men. \"You checking me out?\" Finn asks the pilot, jumping off the car to grab him into a hug. Benny pulls away as the others move to stand, \"No man, I was talking about little miss full fridge over there,\" he says, pointing to Julia, \"You looking fine girl, did Tobey have to pull over on the way here?\" Julia laughs as Joe and Tobey walk towards Benny, Joe hugging the free man and Tobey smacking the back of his head, \"Welcome back man.\" \"Likewise, I heard you got a nice sentence for breaking parole and street racing, that's gotta hurt,\" he replies, walking over to where Julia stands in front of the Mustang, \"Your new ride?\" \"Yes she is,\" the blonde replied, \"You like?\" \"Me like,\" he replies, \"So where we heading? Please tell me everybody's got the week off so we can tear cross country in celebration of the epic win my boy here had at De Leon.\" Finn laughs the loudest, \"Well three of us already celebrated that the night it happened,\" he jokes. \"Two actually,\" Julia interjects, \"I was still in the hospital.\" \"I don't care man,\" Benny whines, \"Maverick says road trip, so we gon' have a road trip.\" The boys all look to Julia, knowing she was the only one with work to contend with, Marshall Motors hadn't been taking on any work other than Ingram's destroyed motors in the wake of two out of four workers being imprisoned, so another week wouldn't hurt. The blonde shrugs in response, \"I've got the week off.\" Benny's eyebrows wiggle as he speaks again, \"So you and Tobey can spend the whole week rekindling the fire?\" He questions crudely. \"You do realise that we haven't actually slept-\" Julia cuts herself short, realising what she had said without thinking. She tries to cover her embarrassment at the confession with a half-hearted cough, and fails. Miserably. Three mouths fall open, jaws dropping to the floor. \"You two haven't-\" Finn stumbles, \"-And I keep-\" \"When have we had time?\" Julia says, in almost a screech as Tobey stands on the other side of the Mustang to her silently. \"Tobey was arrested right after the De Leon.\" \"Before?\" Benny questions, \"I thought you two got together the night before the race?\" \"Yeah we kissed,\" the blonde female replies, \"And I'm sure we would have if not for the fact that I was in the hospital,\" and then, too low for the boys to hear she adds; \"Stupid truck.\" \"Look that's not important,\" Tobey interjects, waving his hands for everyone else to shut up, \"Where are we going?\" The four men share a knowing look, leaving Julia bewildered and looking between them for an answer. Joe takes the toothpick from his mouth and whispers \"Is it possible.\" Tobey nods, \"Maybe, we're already in Utah so we could work backwards and that's seven or eight days off of the trip.\" Finn shakes his head, \"You're not actually considering it right, we couldn't do it in seven days.\" \"Maybe not, but we could do it in ten,\" Joe replies, \"We'd miss the first six and go back to Mount Kisco when we get to New York so that's another day off the trip.\" \"I have a question,\" Julia interrupts their jargon, \"what the fuck are you talking about?\" Benny, Tobey, Finn and Joe all look between each other, silently deciding who should explain until Joe jumps up and speaks, \"I think I have his map still in the car, didn't have the heart to take it out.\" Then he disappears into the back of the black vehicle, returning with a large rolled up map and he straightens it out on the hood of the car, five people crowding around the map. Julia notices that it's a map of the USA and a thick red marker has drawn a maze around the expanse of land printed there, little asterisks and side notes plastered all over, leaving the thing looking like the most organised mess she's ever seen. Tobey speaks next, \"Petey always wanted to drive through every single state in sixteen days at the most, it was all he could talk about for ages. The five of us were going to do it one year and make sure we were in Vegas for his birthday, but we didn't get the chance,\" his voice cracks at the end and Julia gives the driver a reassuring smile, \"He was going to do the route again when he had settled down and had kids, take them to every state but take the time to see them that time. He made a route up and everything.\" Julia looks at the map again, \"Maine to Hawaii, 11,175.5 miles in sixteen days. It's ambitious.\" Joes pipes in, talking logistics, \"We'll cut out Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island at the start, so New York is the furthest we go. Then miss out Hawaii, California, Nevada, Oregon, Alaska, Washington, Montana and Idaho at the end since we've done most of them on the way to here. Then we'll go backwards to what Petey thought up, starting in Utah and ending in New York. In ten days or less.\" They all nod, \"Well I'm needed at work next Monday, so I have ten days exactly.\" Julia says, working out the days from the sunny Friday they were currently living. \"We better get going then,\" Tobey says, \"What's the plan for today?\" Benny speaks up, \"We need to go see the four corners thingy, Little Pete never shut up about that.\" Finn nods, then looks back to the map, \"Four corners thingy, then we get out of Utah and into Arizona where we shall stay the night before setting off into New Mexico in the morn.\" They soon make it to the place where the southeast corner of Utah meets Arizona, New Mexico and Colorado, stopping to take at least a million pictures of the landmark. At one point, the four boys all stand around the circle marking the difference, each one in a different state and Finn decides that he wants that photo printed off and stuck up in the garage, the others don't kick up a fuss. It was a symbolic picture really, so much more than what you see. Benny in Utah, Tobey in Arizona, Finn in Colorado and Joe in New Mexico, all in different states, different places, yet all of them are still together, smiling in the same direction. There are a few sombre moments when someone mentions how much Pete would've loved this trip, it had been his dream after all, but all in all the tone is light and fun, and soon they're back on the road again. Tobey drives the increasingly dusty Mustang with Julia as his right seater and Benny, Joe and Finn ride in the Super Duty, Benny moaning about not having his 'baby' to fly overhead, and instead being stuck in the back on the truck. They make quick headway, whizzing past a sign that read 'speed limit 45' at seventy miles an hour, dodging oncoming traffic like pros. Julia and Tobey make small talk as the Mustang crosses the border into Arizona, speeding down winding roads as the sun goes down and Finn's voice comes through the speakers, \"Motel twenty miles out, you guys gunna want one room or two?\" A warm flush of blood races to Julia's cheeks and the red spreads to her roots, a look of pure horrific embarrassment dispersing across her face. She stutters for a moment, words failing her as the blush on her cheeks never dies down. \"Just one thanks,\" Tobey says, as calm as ever and as Finn hangs up he turns to his right, \"It's safer if you stay with me, right?\" The familiarity of the question registers deep within Julia and she can't help the massive smile that spreads across her face, \"Was that your way of asking me to sleep with you?\" She asks mockingly. Tobey debates his answer, smirking as he takes a sharp left and Julia has to hold the dashboard to steady herself, and then he answers; \"Yes it was.\" \"Then why didn't you just say that?\"[Chapter 2] A/N: This is gonna be pretty speedy so I hope you can keep up and I don't screw up anything. Like I said in the last Authors Note, I'm British and not the smartest of people so I'm sorry if I accidently put that they drove through six states in a day when they could have only physically have done five of them. Please review - nicely. \"Four rooms please,\" Joe asks the middle aged man stood behind a wooden desk, typing away at an old fashioned computer. Finn takes a step forwards and drops a handful of crumpled dollar bills onto the desk, the precise amount for four rooms for the night, and suddenly everyone's glad he had the good sense to bring some cash as well as the credit card with all of the money from the De Leon. It was a rundown place, with a neon red sign saying \"motel\" only the 'o' was flickering and not florescent like the other letters. The building itself was painted a yellowing shade of white, with mould growing from every possible crevice. It wasn't ideal, not with its dusty windows and cracked paint, but it would suffice for the night. The bald headed man – who introduced himself as Tony – hands Joe four keys, each with a hefty feather tied to the end like some sort of makeshift key ring and points them in the direction of the creaky staircase, the route they would have to take up to the third floor. They move up the stairs slowly, each of the boys carrying a duffle bag that Finn had kindly packed for them before leaving, having a little common sense and foreboding, only he hadn't quite realised the scale of their trip, and so in three days they'd all be without clean clothing. Julia however had been slightly less and slightly more organised. She was carrying the same peach coloured overnight bag she had used for her De Leon trip, only this time she hadn't packed any other shoes and so the sky high Gucci boots she sported would have to do. Not to mention the fact that although she had brought an extra pair of pants – or as she called them trousers – she hadn't brought another top, or underwear, or nightwear, but she did remember her toothbrush. This is more than can be said for Finn's packing. Julia and Tobey take the first room they pass with a number corresponding that on one of the keys. She opens the door slowly, met with the smell of dank walls and dusty air, but the bed looks clean and cosy so she supposes it's not all bad. There's a small bathroom attached and Tobey excuses himself immediately to use it, saying there was nothing he craved more than a nice long hot shower. So Julia sits cross-legged on the bed, reading the an article in a motoring magazine she brought with her about Lamborghini going electric, which to her sounded like utter fraudulent bullshit. When Tobey returns, Julia is so into the article that she doesn't acknowledge his presence, not until he coughs slightly and she looks up, startled. He's changed into a deep red top, she notices, with light coloured jeans and wet hair to contrast, he looks comfortable, and at home despite the foreign room. He smiles down at her when she regains the ability to think after her startle, standing to meet him at the bottom of the bed. \"Feel better?\" She asks politely, oddly anxious about what the night could hold. He nods and takes a step forward, cocking his head to the side like he did the first time he ever kissed her, and then he does. It's slow at first, then his hand comes to rest on her cheek and she stumbles forward into him, her hands finding his muscular arms. And then he pulls away, watching her as she looks up at him breathless. The look she gives him makes him feel like he's still kissing her, all the while still dying of thirst for her lips on his. \"I've been waiting for six whole months to do that again,\" Tobey tells her, nothing but pure honesty registering in his blazing blue eyes, his black pupils obscuring a considerable amount of the bright iris. Julia feels herself blush again and slowly moves her hands so they're circling his neck, then without warning, she jumps, lacing her long thin legs around Tobey's waist and his hands move in perfect synchronisation to hold the top of her thighs, \"Well I've been waiting for almost three years to do that.\" Tobey smirks, \"you win.\" \"What's my reward?\" She teases, tightening her legs around him to no avail; before she knows it Julia is flat on her back on the springy mattress, the force bouncing her up and down. And then Tobey's on top of her, leaning down to capture her lips with his, \"this,\" he says into the kiss, securing his body weight above her. DAY #2 Arizona to North Dakota \"Do you guys have no respect?\" Joe says as the door to the room Tobey and Julia shared for the night swings open, he hands them both a flapjack he had brought from the garage next door before continuing, \"some of us were trying to sleep last night.\" Finn laughs and come up behind the Super Duty driver, handing the couple a cardboard coffee cup each, \"Yeah but we couldn't since there was this weird noise that went on and on and on…\" Tobey takes a sip of his strong black coffee through the plastic lid and takes in Julia's blush to his left, \"Maybe it was your subconscious trying to escape.\" \"Ha, Ha,\" Finn responds, sipping from his own cup, \"Sounded more like some form of torture being carried out in there,\" he nods towards the now closed door of the motel room with a smirk. \"Hey, what is up guys?\" Benny's voice interrupts from the other end of the corridor, his bright orange jumper brightening up the dirty white walls and stained carpet, \"And Julia, looking mighty fine as ever, you know I never put you down as a screamer.\" The casual mention of her responses to sex makes Julia cower down behind her coffee cup, it was true that she was a screamer and she already knew that, it wasn't the first time someone had picked up on it. But last night was exceptionally bad, probably because the sex was exceptionally good, either way she had kept all four of the guys awake last night, although Tobey was wide awake for an entirely different reason. She was wearing the other pair of pants she had packed, a tight fitting pair of light blue ripped jeans with her Gucci boots and mass of uncontrollable tresses up in a ponytail. And then, after explaining to Tobey her mishap of forgetting to pack a second top, she was given the dark red shirt he had worn for a very short while the night before, which she took gratefully, tying the hem so it wasn't so baggy and showed only the tiniest peep of snow white skin of her stomach. \"She's full of surprises,\" Tobey tells Benny, slotting his makeshift breakfast into his back pocket as Julia does hers and handing her his coffee, then he picks up both of their bags and follows the guys – bags in tow – down the stairs and to the front desk, where Joe hands Tony the keys and they're on their way. Everyone's stuff goes into the back of the Super Duty and they make a pact to stop at the nearest department store to stock up on what they'll need for the rest of the trip before jumping into their vehicles. Finn and Joe into the Super Duty with Joe driving, and Tobey and Julia into the Mustang, but Benny just stands between the two cars, looking lost. He turns to Tobey and smiles shyly, trying his best at a lost puppy dog face and then he spots an easier target and faces Julia, \"Hey Jules,\" he says feigning sadness. \"What is it Benny?\" She asks, rolling down the window from her passenger seat. \"Can I ride with you in the back of the pretty car?\" Julia turns to Tobey weakly, Tobey shakes his head, Finn and Joe plead her with their eyes, Benny shuffles forward to give the blonde a better look at his sad eyes, Julia sighs, \"I suppose you're going to want me to sit in the back, yes?\" Benny nods and Julia gets out of her car, moving into the back seat and strapping herself into the middle space so she can still she out of the front. Benny instantly smiles, taking the spot where she just sat and passing her back the coffee cup she had put down the side of the door. They exit Arizona as fast as they entered it, not giving it the time of day only being able to cross it off of the list, then they do the same in New Mexico, barely getting a tyre in before leaving once more on the states mostly unpaved roads. Then they're speeding through Colorado faster than the speed limit and Julia knows that they'll get back to New York way before the ten days is up. They make a quick stop in Colorado to see the Garden of the Gods but they don't stay long and soon they're in Wyoming, they stop for lunch and exit the state swiftly, almost turning back on themselves to get to Nebraska. They fly through, heading east towards Iowa, aiming to get to North Dakota before Tobey and Joe needed to stop for sleep, though at the speed they were travelling, they weren't exactly taking in the sights. None of them particularly cared though, this was just to say that they'd done it, for Pete. \"We're going so fast I think we're going to be home sooner than next Monday,\" Julia spoke from where she sat in the back seat of her own car. \"Yeah probably, we're not exactly seeing much of the US are we?\" Benny replied to her, twisting in his seat to see the blonde he was addressing, \"that a problem? You want us to stay around a bit?\" Julia shook her head, \"No it's fine, I like watching the world go by like this. But I think we should take the extra time to spend a day at Disney World when we get to Florida, I could see if they have any last minute rooms available for two nights. We could aim to get there just before bed and spend the following day on the rides and head out the day after,\" when no one spoke she added, \"If you want to that it, I just thought It'd be nice.\" \"We were barely planning to touch ground in Florida,\" Tobey replies, keeping his eyes on the road as he swerves past cars doing half the speed he's touching. \"That's fine then,\" Julia spoke, feeling slightly deflated, \"It was just an idea.\" Tobey clocked the woman's response and quickly added, \"Yeah it was good idea, Petey would've loved it.\" \"Yeah man but you don't-\" Tobey cut Benny off straight away, \"don't know why I was planning to dismiss it in the first place, you're right Benny, thanks.\" Tobey shot his friend the 'don't-say-it' look and Benny obliged. So Julia sorted out the logistics while Tobey talked Joe and Finn into it and they were all booked by the time they sped out of Nebraska and into Iowa where they kept to the border, sometimes leaping back into Nebraska to get to North Dakota through South Dakota by the time the sun set.

Yes, I'm on my way to meet Julie to see the Mustang.\" I say to my boss on the phone. I just got off my flight from England to New York. And now I'm driving my 1969 Chevy Camaro to Mount Kisco to see this Mustang that Bill Ingram, my boss, wants. I haven't been back to Mount Kisco since I left when my mom died ten years ago. \"Good. Good. I need you to make sure that this car is worth three million dollars. If you need to, drive the car. Got it?\" He asks in his English accent. \"Yes, sir. I'll call you with Julie after we look over the car. Goodbye sir,\" I tell him and I hit end call on my cell. I arrive at the party right as they unveil the silver Mustang with two blue stripes going from the bumper to the fender. I have to say this car is a beauty from afar. I look away from the car to try and find my blonde hair friend. I find her at the bar and I walk over to where she's standing. \"Julie, dear, is it that bad of a car that you're already drinking?\" I ask. She turns around and shakes her head. \"No, Abbie. But I haven't seen what's under the hood yet.\" She says in her thick English accent. I smile at her. We've been friends ever since we started working for our boss three years ago. We travel together looking for fast cars that are worth a lot of money. She's the pretty face and talker and I'm the driver and fixer-upper. We have two totally different personalities. She's the blonde hair girl everyone wants to know and talk too. I am the redhead that no one really takes a second glance at. She loves clothes and shopping. I love racing and working on cars. But even though we fight sometimes over stupid things, I couldn't live without her. \"Why haven't you looked yet? You know just as much as I do about things around car hoods.\" I ask her with a smirk. \"Well, I was waiting for you. But then I needed a drink so here we are. Get a drink and relax and enjoy yourself.\" Julie says handing me a flute of champagne with a smile on her face. So as I stand next to Julie, who has on a black dress and heels and looking nice as hell unlike me who has black skinny jeans, black boots, and a dark blue tank top on, looking around at all these people that most likely could not afford the Mustang that is being presented tonight. I see a guy who doesn't fit in at all. A guy that I've known since we were in diapers. He's about 5'10\", brown hair, and wearing a white leather jacket, light blue shirt, jeans, and black sneakers. He's standing around with a bunch of guys, most that I know when he looks over at me. He gives me an odd look before looking away when one of the guys, that I didn't know, nudges him in the ribs. I quickly finish the champagne and put the flute on the bar. It's going to be a long night. \"Ready to take a look at what's under the hood?\" I ask Julie and she nods grabbing her purse. We walk over to the car and I start walking around it as Julie starts talking to someone. The car has a nice look to it. I notice that they had popped the hood up from the way the some of the crowd oohs and ahhs. I walk to the front of the car and hear Julie rattle off all the parts of the engine. I smile at her as I step to stand next to her. I look over at the two guys standing in front of us. One looks to be barely old enough to drive and the other is the guy from earlier. They both look a little shocked at what Julie said. \"Wow. I didn't expect that.\" The kid says looking over at the other guy. \"Why because I'm a woman or because that I'm from England?\" Julie says looking a little pissed. \"Look what my friend is trying to say is that, we don't know a lot of women who knows their car's engine.\" The other guy says. His voice just like how I remember: deep and sexy. \"Well trust me. We both know that this car isn't worth three million.\" Julie says. And both guys look at me. \"It really isn't, maybe two million but not three,\" I say looking at the interior of the car. \"Hi, I'm Pete and this is Tobey. Nice to meet you guys.\" The kid says introducing himself and Tobey. I hold my breathe when Tobey looks me in the eyes. \"I'm Julie and this is Abigail. We are here to see if this car is worth the three million dollars that your man is asking for it.\" I nod my head when she says my name but I don't look at them. I continue to look at the motor. \"Well, that's what it costs, Jules! It's worth every cent of that three million dollars Ingram will pay.\" A guy says coming from behind is with a flute of champagne. He is a tan guy with spiked black hair and a black suit. This guy is Dino. A guy I used to know when Tobey, him, and I used to do everything together. I had seen him a couple of times to buy cars for our boss. \"Hello, Dino. I really think three million is too much for this car.\" I tell him as he kisses both of Julie's cheeks. \"Well, you are always downing my cars, Abbie. Hello, Pete. Tobey.\" He says looking from to slight glare at Tobey. They have always been at each other's throat since high school. \"How fast does it go?\" I ask. \"180.\"230.\" Dino and Tobey say at the same time. \"What do you know, Dino? Tobey has had the keys the whole time.\" Pete says. Julie and I laugh. \"Do we need to turn around and plug our ears, while you all get on the same page?\" Julie says with a smile. \"No, it will go 230 if Tobey drives,\" Pete says. I knew this but didn't want to say anything. \"Why don't we go to the track tomorrow and find out if the car will go 230? Then we can discuss the car being three million dollars.\" Julie says and when they all agree, she waves goodbye and walks away. \"See you tomorrow,\" I say starting to walk away when Tobey grabs my elbow. \"Abbie, did you forget to say hi to an old friend?\" Tobey says looking me in the eye. I just stare at me. What do I say to someone that you hated leaving behind and that you used to love? \"What? Cat got your tongue?\" He says with a smirk. \"No. I'm shocked that you got uglier while I was gone,\" I say with a smirk even though I'm dying inside. \"Wow. Okay. I think I deserve that.\" He says rubbing the back of his head. \"How's your dad? Last, I heard anything he wasn't doing so good.\" I ask and then quickly notice that was the wrong thing to ask, seeing the hurt look in his eyes. \"Uh. He died a while back ago.\" He says and I put a hand on his shoulder. \"I'm so sorry, Tobey. If I had known-\" \"What you would of come back? Dad wanted to talk to you before he died. But where were you? Huh? Nowhere to be found.\" Tobey interrupts me furiously. I give him a sad look. \"I'm sorry. I didn't know.\" I plead with him. He glares at me. I look at the ground wanting to cry. The man that taught me how to drive a car. The man that taught me how to race. That man was dead and I didn't even get to tell him goodbye. \"Is that Abbie I see? Oh, my god! It is!\" Finn yells while grabbing me into a hug. \"Hey Finn,\" I hug him back. I look over his shoulder. \"Hey, Joe,\" I say. \"Hey, Abigail.\" He says back. \"I gotta run guys. I'll see you tomorrow morning. Nice to see you guys and nice to meet you, Pete.\" I say walking away from the group. I need to get out of here. Too many memories and I just need to get back to my hotel room. I hope you like this new story of mine. The title is scheduled to change. I cannot for the life of me choose a title for this story. So if you have a title, message me or put it in a review. Everything I watch this movie, I always see this story in my minds eye. So I finally am giving up and writing it down. If you like it then I will put up the next chapter![Chapter 2] I wake up at around six in the morning and just lay in the bed, staring at the ceiling. Why did he have to be on the team that built the Shelby and Ford Mustang? Fate must be playing with me because the first day back to Mount Kisco and I ran into Tobey Marshall. I sigh as I get up and head to the bathroom to take a shower. As I am getting ready for the day, I think back to the day I left this tiny town behind. -Flashback- I wake up to a doctor standing over me. His face looks grim and I mentally prepare myself for what I think he might say. 'Abigail, your mother has passed away in her sleep sometime last night. I'm so sorry for your loss.' He says patting my shoulder and walking out the door. I sit there in shock as I just stare at the door he had gone out. Where am I supposed to go? I'm nineteen. I don't know what I want to do with my life yet? I get up from the chair that I was sitting on and slowly walk to mom's room. Nurses are gathering sheets that need to be washed and turning the machines off. I watch from the doorway and a nurse stops in front of me. 'Dear, are you alright?' She asks looking at me worriedly. 'Where's mom?' I ask in a hollow voice. 'She's already been taken down to the morgue. Do you want to see her?' I shake my head and slowly walk away. I am leaving this town and never coming back. I have to see Tobey before I leave. I don't want him to think I left because he is with Anita now. I walk to my beat up old car and drive to Marshall Motors. I quickly get out of the car and walk into the shop. 'Abs, what are you doing here? Shouldn't you be with your mom?' Tobey's dad asks me. 'No, sir. Mom is dead. Die last night sometime. Where's Tobey?' I ask quickly without emotion. I am trying really hard not to cry. Not now. Wait just a little longer. Once I'm on the road, I will let myself cry. 'Well, he's not here. He might be with Anita though.' He says wiping his hands on a dirty rag. 'Can you give him a message for me? Tell him that I'm not leaving because of him. Tell him that I love him more than he knows and also tells him that I'm never coming back.' I tell the old man. I quickly kiss him on the cheek and walk back to my car. I speed out of town and not looking back. -End of Flashback- I feel tears come to my eyes and I quickly wipe them away. I take a deep breath before pulling on my tan calf high boots. Today I have on a t-shirt, skinny jeans, and a flannel long sleeve shirt. I grab my keys and phone before walking out of hotel room. I get into my car when my phone rings. I look down before answering to find Ingram is calling. 'Hello, Abigail. Are you at the race track where the car is?\" He asks in a happy tone. \"Heading there now, sir,\" I tell him driving through town to the old racetrack outside of town. When I get there, Jules is already there and so is Tobey and the kid, Pete. I pull up beside Jules' car. I step out and head to where Jules is standing talking to the guys. I walk up and Jules smiles at me and I give her one back. \"Mornin' boys. So the plan is that I am going to drive the car. Get a feel for it and then Tobey here can get it to the top speed.\" I tell them and hold my hand out for the keys. \"There in the car,\" Tobey says and I nod my head. I walk to the car and climb in. I look around me feeling the leather seats. I sit and close my eyes. -Tobey's P.O.V.- \"What's she doing? Does she even know how to drive that much horsepower?\" Petey says next to me. \"She's getting a feel for the car. She's imagining herself drive it before she actually does.\" I tell him. Abigail would sit in a car before every race. This was how she got to know the car and feel the car. \"How do you know this?\" Julie asks looking at me. \"She's an old friend. We used to race together. My dad taught us everything that we know today.\" I say watch the woman that I used to know start the car and speed away. I still can't believe she's here and she looks just as beautiful as the last day I saw her ten years ago. -Abigail's P.O.V.- I drive a couple laps just to see what the car could do. I have to say the car drives beautifully and didn't seem to have a problem at all. I stop the car beside Tobey. I step out and throw the keys to Tobey. \"Let's see what you can do!\" I tell him walking over to Jules, who is ready with her radar gun. I watch Tobey get into the car and quickly drive away. Pete is sitting on the trailer swinging his legs around. I watch the radar as the car hits two hundred miles an hour and climbing. \"What are you guys doing? Huh!\" I hear Dino yelling. I turn around and watch him walking onto the track yelling. Tobey slides to a stop in front of Dino. We walk over to the car as Tobey gets out to some more yelling from Dino. \"You don't own this car! You don't get to joyride whenever you want to.\" Dino says. Tobey tosses him the cars. \"Top speed is a little over two-thirty,\" Tobey says with a smirk. \"Two-thirty four to be exact. According to this.\" Jules says holding the radar gun. \"Hey,\" Dino says with a smile not realizing we were there the whole time and saw everything. \"I missed watching you race Tobey. I feel like it might have gotten better since the last time I saw you.\" I say smiling at Tobey. \"I love this car and it's going to cost Ingram three million dollars,\" I say looking at the car. \"That's the price,\" Dino says with a smirk. \"Two point seven,\" Jules says with an evil smirk. I laugh inside because Dino looks pissed at the price but he nods anyway. \"Ingram will transfer the money when we get the car back to Ingram's shop. Put it back on the trailer and I'll send some guys to pick it up.\" I tell them as Jules gets into her car and drives away. \"Pleasure doing business with you,\" Dino says shaking my hand. \"Have a nice day,\" I tell them walking back to my car with the phone to my ear. \"The car is yours, sir,\" I say driving away.[Chapter 3] I do not own Need for Speed. I am driving back to the airport after filling out a ton of paperwork for Ingram on the Mustang when my phone rings. I look down and see an unknown caller. I give my phone a questioning look and answer it. \"Hello?\" I ask. \"Is this Abigail Miller speaking?\" A man's voice asks. \"Yes,\" I say. \"Do you know a Tobey Marshall?\" The man asks. \"Yes, I do. What's happened? Is something wrong with Tobey?\" I ask stopping the car on the side of the road. \"Ma'am, Tobey Marshall was arrested today for causing a crash that killed someone. Ma'am, we are contacting you because you are number one on his emergency call list. And we were just informing you about the situation. Mr, Marshall's court date is in four days.\" The man keeps talking but I stop listening. Tobey would never kill anyone. He's not the type of person to do that. \"Ma'am, are you still there?\" \"Yes, where is he being held at?\" I ask as I get back on the highway so I can find an off-ramp, so I can turn around. \"Mr. Marshall is being held at Mount Kisco County Jail.\" The man says. \"Okay. Can I visit him?\" I ask. \"Yes, Ma'am.\" The man tells me. \"I will be there in thirty,\" I say hanging up the phone. I scroll through my contacts and finding the one that I haven't used in a long time and hoping it's still a good number. I press the call button. It rings for two rings. \"Abs?\" The man asks. \"Hello, Joe,\" I say speeding to the jail that is holding Tobey. -At the Jail- I meet Joe at the jail and he explains what has happened. Apparently, Tobey and Pete were racing these illegal cars when Tobey's car went out of control and hit Pete's car. Causing Pete's car to go over the bridge and then burst into flames. We walk into the jail together and ask to see Tobey. We are led into a room with multiple chairs and tables. We sit down at a table when Tobey walks in, dressed in an orange jumpsuit and chains on his hands. He sits down in front of us and he looks like he is about to cry. \"Tobey, what happened?\" I asked holding my hands in my lap so I don't reach out and grab my old friend's hand. \"Dino. Dino did this and is making me take the blame.\" He says in a sad and small voice. \"Tobey, they said Dino wasn't there. He had an alibi and someone backed it up.\" Joe says. \"He just left him there. He didn't even stop. He hit Pete and just kept on driving.\" Tobey says with tears in his eyes. He looks up at me. \"Why are you here?\" He asks. I look at him. \"They called me. Apparently, I am your first emergency contact.\" I say looking at the table instead of his eyes. \"I'm sorry. I completely forgot that you were even on my contact list.\" He says as he starts picking at his fingernails. \"Well, we have to leave Tobey. We're going to try and clear your name. See you at the courtroom.\" Joe says and we stand to leave. \"Bye Tobey,\" I say looking into his blue eyes. We leave the jail and before I leave, Joe grabs my arm. \"You can't leave again. He was broken when you left last time and he just got fixed up before you came back. You can't do it again. You either stay or you leave and never come back, Abbie.\" Joe says in a serious voice and letting go of my arm. \"I'm going to stay. When is Pete's funeral? I want to be there for you guys. Especially Finn. You know how he gets.\" I say and I take a deep breath and let in out. \"I won't leave again. Not like I did before.\" \"You better not. Pete's funeral is tomorrow. Somehow, they made where he can be buried tomorrow. Meet you at the cemetery?\" Joe says walking to his car. \"Yeah,\" I tell him as I get into my car. I have a ton of phone calls to make. -At the Cemetery- I follow the group next to Finn, who is taking the death of his friend hard. Last time I saw him cry this hard was back before my mom died. I grab his arm and wrap my arms around it. I try to comfort him as much as I can. We pass by my mom's grave and I don't stop but by the looks of it, someone is visiting her because there are flowers next to her tombstone. I look away and continue to try to not fall in these heels. We gather around Pete's casket and Anita is sobbing while leaning against Dino. Dino doesn't even look sad. He sees me staring at him and I glare at him and he glares back. I look away when Finn starts to sniffle as the priest starts to talk. The funeral ends and I wait for Finn to start walking when Anita looks at me. She walks over and wipes her eyes. \"Why are you here?\" She asks giving me a glare. \"I'm just here for the guys. I didn't know Pete but he seemed to be a sweet and kind kid.\" I tell her while Finn stares down at me. \"You shouldn't be here. I don't care if you are here for the guys. But you shouldn't have come. Tobey killed my little brother and now you're back in town. This is just great.\" She rants on and I just let her because she just lost her little brother. \"Come on, Abbie. Let's go.\" Finn says pulling on my arm. I give Anita one last look and then follow Finn away from Pete's casket. -At the Courthouse- Benny, Joe, Finn, and I are sitting right behind where Tobey is sitting. We are waiting for the judge to tell us Tobey's sentencing. I want to comfort Tobey so much but I sit on my hands so I don't do something stupid. The judge looks at Tobey. \"Mr. Marshall, I am sentencing you to two years in prison for involuntary manslaughter for the death of Pete Walker.\" The judge taps his gravel and the police take Tobey away. I just sit there, not believing that Tobey is going to prison. ","Summary":" I do not own Need for Speed, I only own Abigail. \"Hello.

Pairing : Jenko x Eric, Mike x Adam et autres à venir Prologue « Si j'étais vous, je baisserais mon arme. » Jenko et Schmidt tournèrent doucement sur eux même pour voir les hommes de Herman le Pig pointer leurs armes vers eux et voir l'un des hommes tenir en menace Erik. Jenko voulu faire un geste vers eux mais l'un des hommes lui indiqua avec son arme de faire un geste en arrière. « Alors comme ça vous êtes des flics… Quoi que en te regardant on peut se poser la question ? » fit celui qui semblait être le chef en désignant Schmidt. Le plus petit des deux haussa les épaules pour toute réponse. « En tout cas c'était sur que tu n'étais pas un de ces mecs qui se mettent à poils pour ces femmes en chaleur.» « Hé ! Vous n'avez pas vu mon show spécial ! » Fit Schmidt en baissant les bras. « Je suis d'accord avec lui\", rajouta Jenko à ses cotés, \"grâce à ce numéro il a quand même remporté 1000$ en une soirée.» « Voyez ! » « Quoi que tu aurais pu mieux faire au niveau de l'hélicoptère ? Tu sais ' si vous ne coopérez pas on sort l'hélicoptère !' et hop tu sors l'engin ! » Continua Jenko. Schmidt se mit à rire, et lui et Jenko se mirent à discuter du comment ils pourraient améliorer leurs numéros alors qu'en face d'eux, la bande du Pig et Erik les regardèrent abasourdit. Avaient-ils oublié qu'ils pouvaient être à tout moment tué ? Le chef qui commençait en avoir marre qu'on lui manque de respect de cette manière, tira un coup en feu en l'air. Les deux policiers reportèrent leurs attentions devant eux. « Je vais vous trouer et ensuite trouer votre petite copine là et vous jetez à la mer. » L'homme qui prenait en joue Erik sera son emprise sur lui. Il enfonça le canon de son arme dans son menton, ce qui provoqua un crissement du concerné et de la part de Jenko qui n'appréciait pas de voir son homme dans cette position… Mais là, il ne savait pas comment faire pour pouvoir se sortir de là, car comme d'habitude, ils avaient oublié d'appeler du renfort. Malgré qu'Erik leur ait dit d'attendre, ils étaient partis comme ça… Leur seule chance était Mike et les autres. Mais même ça, il était peu sur qu'ils viennent. Ils étaient dans la merde… Quand tout à coup, un coup de feu se fit entendre, suivit d'autres. Schmidt en profita pour se mettre à couvert mais Jenko se jeta sur l'un des hommes en face. « JENKO ! » Cria Schmidt mais il vit son collègue se battre avec un des hommes en face. Merde, se disait le plus petit des policiers, alors qu'il fut confus par la scène qui se passait devant lui. En effet, il vit plus loin l'homme qui avait Erik le prendre avec lui pour quitter l'entrepôt et Jenko toujours à terre pour se battre. Que devait-il faire ? Que devait-il faire ? Alors qu'il allait se décider, il entendit de nouveau un coup de feu et le cri de Jenko qui suivit. Shit ! Shit ! Et Erik qui n'était même plus dans l'entrepôt. Dickson allait les tuer ! Sans réfléchir, Schmidt se jeta vers l'homme qui était sur son collègue. Il verrait pour le reste après mais la vie de Jenko était plus importante, enfin si il n'était pas trop tard… « SCHMIDT ! ATTENTION ! » Et de nouveau un coup de feu… Voilà un petit prologue et la suite sous peu... héhéhéhé ![Chapter 2] Genre : Humour, romance, crossover Magic Mike Pairing : Jenko x Eric, Mike x ?, Schmidt x ? Blabla de l'auteur : Bonjour à tous ! Me revoilà sur une nouvelle fic sur 21 jump street (enfin plutôt 22 ici) en crossover avec Magic Mike. Je sais, je sais j'aurais du faire une fic propre à de 22 jump street (chose que j'ai fait mais pas avancé, car je suis bloqué au niveau de la storyline, du coup j'ose pas vraiment la publier). Du coup en regardant Magic Mike récemment, mon inspiration a fait « ah ouaiiiisssssss ! » et nous y voilà. Nota : je vous conseille de lire «Sans Encombre,... », juste histoire que vous comprenez d'où est partie le Jenko x Eric et qui est mon OMF. Bonne lecture ! On prend les même et on recommence Jenko regarda son ordinateur face à lui les yeux vitreux et pas du tout inspiré. Voilà bien trois heures qu'il tapait ce rapport et il avait l'impression qu'il n'avançait pas. Il faut dire que cela n'était pas intéressant : une histoire de couple de vieux qui voulaient seulement prendre un plaisir en fumant un joint dans un parc. Cependant, après enquête, il s'est révélé qu'ils revendaient un peu à d'autre personne de leur maison de retraite. Rien de bien passionnant et d'affolant, pourtant ce genre de rapport n'aurait pas dû prendre autant de temps pour l'écrire, mais voilà, on parlait de Greg Jenko ici… « J'en ai marre ! » Fit le policier en faisant voler ses feuilles au-dessus de lui. Schmidt, sur le bureau en face de lui, lui jeta un œil curieux, avant de reprendre ses propres activités. « Si tu l'avais fait il y a une semaine comme je te l'avais conseillé, tu ne seras pas là à savoir quoi écrire à la dernière minute. » Sur ces dernières paroles, Schmidt reprit ses activités et Jenko soupira de nouveau. Il jeta un œil vers ses feuilles au sol à côté de son bureau et se leva pour les ramasser. Jenko maugréa, il avait décidé de rentrer dans la police pour les actions, l'adrénaline, vivre dangereusement pas pour écrire des rapports ! Il n'était plus à l'école ! Après tout sans ça il ne pouvait pas avancer mais alors qu'il allait prendre une feuille à terre, un pied se posa dessus. Le policier leva les yeux pour y croiser ceux de la collègue de son petit ami… super… « Toujours en train de trainer au lieu de travailler ? » L'afro-américaine toisa de haut Jenko, les bras croisés juste en-dessous de sa poitrine. Jenko lui jeta regard mauvais, avant de lui retirer son pied et de récupérer la feuille en question il n'était pas d'humeur à s'entretenir avec elle. Jenko retourna tranquillement à son bureau quand il vit une jeune femme accompagnée la Sorcière. Elle lui lança un sourire avant de lever la main pour le saluer, le policier ne sut pas comment réagir et lui répondit de manière hésitante. « Yo Miranda, qui est ce ? » Fit Schmidt en désignant la jeune femme à ses côtés. L'afro-américaine n'eut pas le temps de répondre que le chef Hardy sortit de son bureau pour appeler Jenko et Schmidt. Ce dernier jeta un œil vers la femme en question et lui fait un signe de la main, mais il vit qu'elle avait le regard fixé sur Jenko qui lui tournait le dos et allait vers le bureau du chef. Schmidt soupira. Il y en avait toujours que pour son collègue. « Tu n'es pas intéressé de savoir qui c'est ? » demanda Schmidt en jetant un œil en arrière et voir que les deux femmes étaient partis. Jenko à ses côtés, le regarda avant de hausser les épaules, non il s'en foutait… Le chef Hardy les reçu dans son bureau et ferma précieusement la porte derrière eux. « Gentlemen, prenez place. » Les deux policiers s'exécutèrent. Ils savaient ce qui les attendait, mais ils ne firent aucun commentaire en attendant ceux de leur boss. Il faut dire que depuis le succès de la mission dans l'unité de Jump Street au lycée Saigon High et le démantèlement du réseau de la HFS, les choses étaient devenus routinières… Ils pensaient sincèrement, enfin surtout Jenko, qu'ils allaient être affectés sur des missions plus intéressantes et être davantage respectés, mais ils sont tombés de haut. Entre la mission d'infiltration où ils devaient arrêter un trafiquant d'animaux qui s'est terminée par l'évasion du suspect et une autre mission où ils devaient toujours infiltré une école de cuisine française pour trouver un usurpateur d'identité qui a finalement réussi à s'envoler tel Jarod le Caméléon, on pouvait dire qu'ils n'allaient pas bien haut dans la réussite. Schmidt était persuadé que leur chef allait leur affecter sur des patrouilles à vélos et mettre des PV sur des voitures mal garé. Dieu qu'il pouvait parfois détester son métier ! A ses cotés Jenko restait étrangement calme et attendait les remarques du chef. Schmidt l'observait…Etrange… « Gentlemen sachez que si je vous ai convoqué, ce n'est pas dû à vos maigres réussites qui ne font évidemment pas la fierté du service, mais passons. D'ailleurs Jenko, où est le rapport sur l'enquête de la semaine dernière ? » Jenko s'agita sur sa chaise : « Fini. J'ai oublié de vous le remettre sur votre bureau. » Schmidt lui jeta un œil, mais se tut. Si le chef venait à découvrir la vérité, il devra assumer… « Bien. Je l'attends en sortant de ce bureau, mais ce n'est pas pour ça que je vous ai convoqué. Tout le monde ici, s'en foutez de la remise de Jump Street avant que vous débarquiez ici. Tout le monde, moi y compris aurait parié que vous aurez raté sur toute la ligne. Mais vous avez eu du bol, du coup nos services ont investi des sommes mirobolantes pour faire en sorte que Jump Street reste opérationnel, comme si cette histoire allait marcher ! » Jenko et Schmidt se regardèrent et firent un rire pour contenter leur chef. « Par contre, je ne comprends pas que la Commissaire ne saisisse pas qu'en vous renvoyant là-bas, ça sera pire. C'est toujours pire la deuxième fois. » Schmidt et Jenko se regardèrent un grand sourire aux lèvres. Ils allaient enfin retourner sur une mission intéressante ! Mais un raclement de la gorge les fit revenir sur leur chef qui leur fit une longue tirade sur les méfaits de la routine et de l'enracinement. Finissant sur le fait qu'il était en plein divorce. Le malaise fut total pour les deux policiers et particulier pour Schmidt quand Jenko essaya de prouver par un geste totalement déplacé que la routine pouvait se combattre en cassant des murs… Etait-ce nécessaire de faire un geste comme tel face à leur propre chef ? Un jour Schmidt comprendrait son collègue, mais pas aujourd'hui… « Je vais vous demander de vous taire. Juste une chose : faite la même chose que la dernière fois et tout le monde sera content ! » Et ils sortirent aussi vite qu'ils étaient entrés. Une nouvelle mission, ce n'était pas trop tôt ! « Cool, direction Jump Streets je suppose » fit Jenko bien content d'aller à l'unité. Schmidt racla sa gorge et lui rappela son rapport non terminé. Jenko soupira, mais fit à son meilleur ami qu'il verrait ça plus tard et sur ces dernières paroles et des grands sourires qu'ils se rendirent à l'unité située au 22 Jump Streets. xXx Quelques heures plus tard, alors qu'ils sortirent de l'église vietnamienne – qui était devenu maintenant le QG de l'unité de Dickson- les sourires n'étaient plus au rendez-vous… Loin de là. Au contraire, c'était maintenant des visages crispés qui apparaissaient sur leurs faces. La mission que Dickson leur avait donné était exactement la même que la précédente : un étudiant mort dû à une drogue appelée la Whiphi. Une toute nouvelle drogue qui faisait fureur au campus de MC State. Comme à Saigon high, la mission était simple : « Infiltrer les dealers et trouvez les fournisseurs » , Sauf que, dans les faits, ce n'est pas tout à fait ça. « Mais comment il peut nous donner ce genre de mission, on ne sait même pas danser ! » Fit Schmidt à Jenko qui secoua la tête tout aussi dépitée. Les deux collègues se dirigèrent vers leur voiture. Oui car, la particularité de l'étudiant mort était son activité nocturne pour arrondir ses fins de mois : strip-teaseur. Il travaillait au sein d'un club appelé le Xquisite et il y aurait de forte chance qu'il se soit procuré cette drogue au sein du club... … .. . Les deux policiers avaient été septiques lors des explications de Dickson et leurs véritables rôles dans l'enquête, jusqu'à que le petit ami de Jenko rentre dans le bureau et leur explique la situation. Dire que Jenko était content de voir Eric Valens détective au département des stups- dans le bureau de Dickson était loin de la vérité. Oh non, il n'était pas en froid avec lui, non, juste … Si leurs boulots pouvaient éviter d'interférer dans leurs vies personnelles, il serait plus que content… Eric leur avait donc annoncé que son équipe était sur cette affaire depuis peu et que lui-même avait réussi à être pris en tant que barmaid dans le club où l'étudiant travaillait. C'était un club qui avait un très bon succès, bien placé, attirant tout type de femmes et de jeunes étudiantes la recherche d'excitation et de plaisir. Eric était persuadé que le fournisseur se cachait au sein du club et qu'il devait sans doute engager des étudiants pour la revendre au sein du campus. C'était là que leur enquête devait déboucher, mais avant toute chose : ils devaient réussir à se faire embaucher là-bas. . .. … « Il ne pouvait pas nous donner une mission plus… simple, ou alors qu'on essaye juste de trouver le fournisseur et le dealer à distance… » « Schmidt... » « Ou alors juste infiltrer les étudiants et faire notre enquête tranquillement ! » « Schmidt ! » « Jenko ! Je ne veux pas me mettre à poil devant des femmes en chaleur, tu ne sais pas ce que c'est de se sentir humilier ! » Le plus grand des deux fit un soupir et roula des yeux alors qu'il mit le contact pour démarrer la voiture. Etudiant le jour, strip-teaseur la nuit. Cela allait être intéressant à voir.[Chapter 3] Blabla de l'auteur : Avant tout de chose j'ai refait mon chapitre 1, car j'ai vu qu'il y avait trop d'incohérence ( comment ça je le fais mille an plus tard ? euhhh sorry ). Deux : …Avec moi, si vous m'avez suivi sur SEPOM, vous comprenez que… j'upade peu… enfin j'essaye de le faire rapidement mais…ouais…lol Mais j'essaye de fair le maximun d'effort ! Bref ! Cependant j'ai écris des chapitres beaucoup plus loooooongs héhéhé Des rencontres inattendus Quand Greg Jenko arriva devant chez lui le soir il n'avait qu'une envie : c'était de se poser dans son canapé, une bière dans une main devant la télé et son homme à ses côtés. Mais c'est le silence et le froid qui l'accueillit quand il ouvrit la porte d'entrée. Il la referma aussitôt avant de sortir son téléphone et composer un numéro qu'il connaissait maintenant par cœur. « Hey ! » La voix d'Eric décrocha un sourire à Jenko. Il avait encore du mal à se l'avouer, mais il était devenu accroc à cet homme et il aurait du mal à s'en séparer. « Dis-moi, je pensais venir boire un verre chez toi et sans doute y passer la nuit, qu'en dis-tu ? » Depuis la mission à Saigon High, les choses entre Eric et lui s'étaient arrangés. Ils avaient décidé de reprendre leur relation depuis le début, avec des dates et autre rendez-vous pour mieux se connaître et voilà quasiment un an qu'ils étaient ensemble. Jenko avait encore du mal à y croire, car étant loin de vouloir se mettre dans une relation sérieuse, qui plus est avec un homme, c'était quelque chose qui ne semblait pas vraiment envisageable. Loin de là que l'idée le réfute, non, c'était juste que… ce n'était pas lui. D'ailleurs depuis qu'il était en couple, beaucoup de ses ex de courtes durées étaient venu prendre de ses nouvelles…Le karma pouvait être une vraie s*lope. « Greg, le double des clés que je t'ai donnés est là pour que tu ne me poses plus cette question . » Jenko ne répondit pas de suite, c'est vrai qu'Eric lui avait donné ses doubles de clés. Le policier avait clairement refusé de les avoir au début, même si dans les faits, ils passaient énormément de temps dans les appartements de l'un et de l'autre, mais le double des clés étaient la première étape avant l'emménagement ensemble, puis le mariage , puis la maison avec le chien , le bébé ! Il exagérait et il le savait très bien. Maintenant que le mariage gay était inscrit dans la constitution rien ne pouvait les empêcher de passer l'étape. Même si Jenko savait qu'Eric lui rirait à la figure s'il avait l'affront d'en parler, mais le policier ne niait pas qu'il lui fût déjà arrivé d'y penser… Seulement une fois… comme ça, un soir, avec au moins plus dizaine de verres d'alcool dans le sang. Il y avait aussi eu une deuxième fois, mais c'était plus l'idée de vivre avec le détective qui lui avait de nouveau effleuré l'esprit, lors d'un diner entre lui et des collègues, alors qu'il dégustait son 5e verre de champagne français. Ça devait être le champagne qui l'avait fait délirer. Quoi qu'il en soit, il devait garder ses idées pour lui. Il ne mit pas longtemps avant de se retrouver chez le détective. Celui-ci vivait pas très loin de chez lui dans un grand appartement dans le centre de ville. L'appartement était à l'image d'Eric : classe, organisé et chaleureux. C'est d'ailleurs dans cette ambiance que Jenko rentra dans l'appartement, qui contrastait au sien. Une douce musique envahissait les lieux et une bonne odeur lui chatouilla le nez. Jenko s'engouffra et ferma la porte derrière lui et mit les clés sur la commode à côté de la porte d'entrée. Son sac sur son dos, il avança dans le couloir qui déboucha dans le salon et c'est là qui le vit. Eric était tranquillement posé dans l'un de ses canapés, sa tablette en main sûrement en train de lire et sa bière posée sur la table basse. C'était une scène banale connaissant le détective, grand fan de lecture, mais c'était tellement domestique qu'un frisson parcourut Jenko sans qu'il sache vraiment pourquoi. Eric leva le regard vers lui et lui fit son plus grand sourire, puis il se leva, tout en déposant sa tablette et ses lunettes de vue. Il s'approcha de Jenko qui avait posé son sac au sol et qui avait maintenant passé ses bras autour d'Eric pour le serrer contre lui et poser ses lèvres sur les siennes. Ils s'échangèrent quelques baisers avant que Jenko posa un dernier baiser sur le front d'Eric. « Tu arrives à temps, j'allais bientôt servir le repas. » Eric se dégagea de son emprise et alla directement dans une autre pièce. Jenko en profita pour aller y déposer ses affaires dans la chambre du propriétaire. Jenko pourrait dire ce qu'il voulait, l'idée de vivre définitivement ici lui plaisait bien. XxX « C'était donc sur cette mission que tu bossais ? » Ils étaient maintenant posés sur le canapé, l'un en face de l'autre. Le couple se lançait une balle tranquillement. « Hum » répondit Eric vaguement « Dickson et mon boss m'ont demandé de me taire dessus, en attendant de voir si vous rejoignez l'équipe. » Jenko comprenait et fit un son pour qu'Eric le comprenne, mais depuis que le policier savait que son petit ami bossait dans un bar de strip-tease pour femmes, il n'était pas vraiment serein… « Et comment tu as pu être intégré dans leur équipe ? » Demanda Jenko en renvoyant la balle un peu plus forte que prévu. Eric la réceptionna surpris mais n'en tenu pas compte et la renvoya de nouveau « Oh, j'ai confondu l'un des strip-teaseur avec toi et sur un malentendu je l'ai dragué. » Jenko fit une pause avant de renvoyer la balle plus fort et Eric eut du mal à la réceptionner sans se faire mal. « Tu l'as confondu avec moi ? C'est quoi cette histoire ? » Jenko avait maintenant les sourcils fronçaient et attendait des explications. Eric se mit à rire face à la jalousie non dissimulé de l'homme en face de lui et renvoya la balle normalement. « Moi-même j'ai eu de mal à y croire. Je savais que je devais m'entretenir avec un mec du club du nom de Mike, sauf que le mec ne s'est pas montré avant un moment alors j'ai bu et j'ai cru que tu étais venu au club toi-même mais il s'est avéré que c'était la cible et donc Mike. » Jenko lança un long regard vers Eric qui continuait à rire, alors qu'il ne comprenait pas. « Tu verras » continua le détective mystérieux « ton sosie est en ville et tu seras étonné de le rencontrer toi-même. Sur ce je vais me coucher. » Eric allait se lever quand Jenko décida qu'il était plus intéressant qu'il reste avec lui. Il le rattrapa pour le plaquer contre le canapé et l'embrasser de nouveau. Le détective fit de nouveau un rire, avant de lui répondre et passer ses bras autour de son cou. .. XxX Le lendemain, Jenko et Schmidt durent déménager leurs affaires au campus de MC State. Les parents de Schmidt se proposèrent de les aider, toujours dans le rôle de jouer le rôle de la famille des étudiants qui faisaient leur première année dans cette grande université. « Je suis le premier de ma famille à faire de fausses études » fit Jenko fier en regardant le campus devant lui. Le couloir de l'université était rempli d'élève et de famille qui aidaient leurs enfants à s'installer, ces mêmes enfants qui allaient se diriger vers la fête la plus proche une fois les parents partis. Les deux policiers eurent à peine le temps de s'installer que leurs voisins d'en-face, deux jumeaux, virent à leur rencontre. Deux jumeaux identiques, qui avaient du mal à croire que Schmidt et Jenko étaient frère, d'ailleurs ce dernier eut droit à une remarque sur son physique de « vieux qui attirait les filles ». « Tu pourrais facilement te faire passer pour l'un de ces Sugar Daddy que les filles raffolent. » Fit l'un des jumeaux. Sugar Daddy ? Jenko et Schmidt se regardèrent ne connaissant pas du tout ce terme. Sans aucun doute encore un mot su que des jeunes, mais hors de question de le faire comprendre comme ça. Une fois les affaires installées, ils décidèrent de regarder leurs emplois du temps respectif : « Du coup si Eric participe à cette mission, il devrait être dans le campus non ? » demanda Schmidt alors qu'il finissait à déballer ses affaires. Bonne question se disait Jenko, mais il était incapable de répondre à ça. Il ne savait rien des détails de la mission d'Eric. L'un des mots d'ordre de leur relation était : ne pas mêler vie privée et le boulot, sauf si exception. Même si au fond Jenko aurai quand même voulu en savoir plus, Eric était par moment un peu trop… secret. « Sans doute… Pour te dire la vérité je ne sais pas. » Schmidt observa son collègue surpris, pourtant il savait que les deux hommes étaient devenus très complice : « Il s'est passé quelque chose entre vous deux ? » Jenko se détourna de ses affaires pour faire face à son collègue : « Non pas à ce que je sache, à moins qu'il t'est dit quelque chose ? » Schmidt répondit par le négatif et il continua à ranger sa chambre. Pour dire la vérité, Eric lui avait un message pour lui dire de ne pas prévenir Jenko s'il le contactait suivi du numéro de Miranda à utiliser en cas d'urgence. Schmidt savait que Jenko et la jeune femme ne s'entendaient pas vraiment, donc il ne voyait pas pourquoi il devait partager l'information. Les deux policiers reprirent leur activité de ranger leur chambre de tous nouveaux étudiants à la MC State. Les premiers jours passèrent sans encombre, ils essayèrent d'en savoir plus sur la WHIPHI « Work hard, yes, play hard, yes » ou alors sur comment trouver un boulot étudiant dans le milieu de la nuit, mais aucun résultat concernant l'un comme l'autre. C'était direct et pas du tout discret, mais ils avaient fait comme ça à Saigon high, pourquoi ça ne marcherait pas là ? La plupart des étudiants à qui ils avaient demandé, les avaient regardés bizarrement : « Vous êtes des poulets ? » « Vous êtes vieux pour ce genre de choses. » « C'est le directeur qui vous envoie ? » Étaient les questions qui revenaient le plus souvent. Schmidt et Jenko rirent à chaque fois, essayant de noyer le poisson mais maintenant ils étaient méfiés des autres étudiants et devaient faire profil bas… Ils devaient trouver une autre approche. xXx « To : Eric Tu ne m'as pas dit si tu étais sur le Campus ? » « To : Eric Eric ? » Jenko regarda son téléphone personnel tendu. Voilà 3 jours qu'Eric ne répondait plus à ses appels ni messages. Il essayait de se convaincre que cela avait un rapport avec la mission, mais il avait du mal à ne pas penser le contraire et croire qu'Eric faisait exprès de ne pas répondre. C'était possible. Cependant, il ne devait pas perdre de vu la mission en cours, si Eric voulait reprendre contact avec lui, il le ferait en temps et en heure. Surtout que les choses se débloquèrent quelque jour plus tard quand Jenko rencontra Zook, un blond au look surfeur et son pote Rooster lors d'un cours sur géopolitique. Tous deux faisant partie de l'équipe de football de l'université. Ça servait à rien de mentir, mais la première impression que Jenko eut des deux jeunes hommes n'étaient pas forcement valorisante, pas pour eux, non, plutôt pour lui. Il avait trouvé des gens aussi bêtes que lui, mais étrangement Jenko sentait que cette rencontre allait pouvoir le mener loin et en effet Zook et lui-même réussirent à s'entendre très rapidement. Jenko réussit à s'intégrer dans l'équipe de football et à attirer l'œil non seulement du coach ainsi que de toute l'équipe en tant que running back . Il courrait vite et avait la force dû à sa musculature, s'était impressionnant. Zook avait été bouche bée face à ce talent qui était nettement supérieur à Rooster, c'était sûr, c'était le destin, Jenko allait devenir un partenaire et un méga pote. Le blond faisait partie de ses nombreuses fraternités d'étudiants qui étaient logés sur le campus et suite à la prestation du policier lors de l'entrainement, Zook lui avait proposé de venir boire un verre pour le présenter à ses frères, mais il ne pensait pas qu'il aurait emmené son frère avec lui. Comment il s'appelait déjà ? Pete ? Zack ? … Non il était sûr que ça commençait par un D. Daniel ? « Hey Brad ! » Fit Zook en accueillant son nouvel ami « et… C'est quoi ton nom déjà ? » « Doug…Doug Macquaid » Répondit Schmidt en roulant des yeux. Certes il n'était pas aussi charismatique que Jenko mais il n'était pas invisible ! « Ok ok Doug ! Bon les gars, faites comme chez vous, on est là pour faire la fête ! » Un cri à l'unisson accueillit ses propos, alors qu'il entraîna Brad avec lui pour lui présenter d'autres gars de la fraternité. Schmidt souffla dépité, il fallait s'y attendre, cependant il pourrait en profiter pour continuer l'enquête et se procurer de la Whiphi, il ne pouvait pas avoir de drogue dans ce genre de fête ! Le policier tomba sur Rooster qui était en train de manger des apéritifs et remarqua de suite son tatouage… exactement le même que celui qu'ils avaient vu sur la photo de Dickson ! Mais le policier ne pouvait pas l'arrêter comme ça, ni même l'interroger dessus directement, il devait trouver quelque chose de plus…subtil dans l'approche. C'est pour cela qu'il décida d'y aller franco. Mais l'approche ne se fit pas du tout comme il s'y attendait… « Hey, Doug, n'est-ce pas ? Le frère de Brad ? » Non, jamais il aurait pensé que Rooster le mec hyper cool par définition – non mais vous avez vu ce nom, comment ne pas entendre la coolititude dedans – puisse se rappeler de lui. Ou était le piège ? « Yeah… » « J'ai vu comment Zook t'a parlé, te prend pas la tête vis-à-vis de lui, c'est un gars cool il a juste flashé sur ton frère. Un verre ? » Continua le décoloré de manière tranquille en mangeant. Ok, là ce n'était pas normal. Schmidt avait tous ses sens en alerte et attendait sur la défensive quand le coup allait partir, le moment où le joueur de football américain allait rire à pleine dent en disant qu'il était un looser ou alors quand il appellerait ses potes pour venir se moquer de lui. Mais rien… Rien n'arriva, seulement Rooster qui lui tendit un red cup. « Allez poto, fêtons ça ! Bienvenu à MC State ! » Schmidt et Rooster trinquèrent avant de boire cul sec. Peut-être que cette année, allait être enfin la bonne, se dit Schmidt en buvant. Il oublia le temps d'un instant le tatouage et Jenko. xXx Pendant ce temps-là, Zook et Jenko étaient en train de faire la fête en dansant et enchainant les verres, tous comme étudiant faisant partie d'une fraternité. Zook et le policier s'étaient trouvés énormément de point commun et s'étaient rapidement appelés frères, mais alors que Jenko alla se resservir : « Mike !? Qu'est-ce tu fais ici ! » Il senti des bras l'entourer et qu'on le serrait contre lui. Le degré d'alcool aidant il ne repoussa pas de suite la personne. Non, il attendit et fut surpris de voir un jeune homme devant lui, brun avec une mèche sur le côté, barbe de trois jours et aux regards bruns, cependant un peu plus petit que lui. Il était beau, c'était indéniable, mais ça s'arrêtait là. L'inconnu le fixa quelque peu perplexe avant d'ajouter : « Tu n'es pas Mike … ? » « Non mais j'aurais dû dire à mon père de m'appeler comme ça, ça m'aurait bien plus. » Répondit Jenko avec un sourire en coin charmeur. Le gars en face de lui se mit à rire : « Qui aurait cru que j'aurais vu le sosie parfait de Monsieur Magic Mike en personne. Ça donne des idées… » Le regard que lui lança le brun était sans équivoque que Jenko en frissonna. Il devait se stopper maintenant et vite. « Brad Macquaid » Jenko tendit sa main. « Adam, the Kid » « C'est un drôle de… nom… » Fit surpris le policier. « Mon nom de scène. Je trouve qu'il est pas mal quand je me présente aux gens. » Jenko bu dans son verre alors que la fête continuait autour de lui : « Tu fais carrière dans le théâtre ? » « Plutôt dans celle de faire mouiller les femmes. » Son étouffement passa inaperçu dans le brouhaha ambiant. Jenko continua de tousser sous le rire clair d'Adam. What the fuck ? « Je travaille au Xquistie, tu connais ? C'est le paradis pour les femmes qui veulent se libérer un peu en jetant leur agent sur des hommes qui leur font plaisir aux yeux, comme moi. » Jenko ne répondit pas. « Et un de mes… collègues , te ressemble comme deux gouttes d'eaux, on pourrait vous confondre pour des frères. Si ça te dit de venir voir un de mes shows… » Adam venait de s'approcher de Jenko pour littéralement se coller à lui et glisser une carte dans sa poche arrière : « Le lieu est sur la carte. » chuchota-t-il aux creux de son oreille. Adam se recula, lui fit un clin d'œil et disparut dans la foule des étudiants. Jenko, loin d'être perturbé – l'habitude d'être « du miel autour d'un groupe d'ours » disait Eric- récupéra la carte dans sa poche pour y lire : « Xquistie Strip Club- Le rêve à porter de main. » « Je devais m'entretenir avec un mec du nom de Mike (…) Tu verras ton sosie est en ville » Jenko se rappela les paroles d'Eric. Il tenait quelque chose. Adam the Kid et Magic Mike. Il devait absolument en informer Schmidt ! 8 pages rien que pour ce chapitre ! Pas mal d'idée me trotte par la tête. Mais surtout dans le developpement des relations entre les personnages. Jenko, Schmidt, Eric, Zook, Rooster, Adam et Mike, ça fait du beau monde ! en tout cas j'espère que ce chapitre vous a plus ! n'hesiter pas à laisser votre avis ;)[Chapter 4] Blabla de l'auteur : Aahhhh comment j'ai repris l'inspiration des grands jours ! J'en suis moi-même surprise. Continuons à toucher du bois pour que ça continue ! Trève de blabla et bonne lecture Magic… Mike ? Jenko retrouva Schmidt dans un beer pong avec Rooster et d'autres étudiants. Ils étaient tous bien souls mais vu l'heure avancé c'était normal. Dire que le policier était surpris était un euphémisme : il ne pensait pas qu'il verrait son collègue encore s'amuser ici mais plutôt déjà rentré au dortoir. Cela décrocha un sourire à Jenko, jusqu'à… : « Hé petit gros ! J'imagine bien que tu ne sais pas viser un trou mais dépêche-toi ! » C'était un étudiant du côté adverse qui venait de parler, sa remarque fit rire les autres autour de lui mais pas Schmidt et encore moins Rooster. Jenko allait intervenir mais de ne nouveau se stoppa quand il vit que Rooster avait fait le tour de la table et venait de frapper le gars. ... Hein !? Jenko ne bougea pas de là où il était, les gens avaient beau encourager et/ou essayer de stopper les deux étudiants, le policier avait les yeux rivés sur Schmidt qui… encourageait Rooster avant d'intervenir et se battre avec l'autre étudiant. Il fit demi-tour. Il préféra retourner boire un verre. xXx « Jenko… Je meurs. » Jenko lança son coussin sur Schmidt et lui pria de se taire. Lui aussi avait mal à la tête, lui aussi avait trop bu la veille mais contrairement à Schmidt lui ne s'était pas battu donc ni de bleu, ni mal partout. « Jenko… » « Encore un mot et je te donnerais une raison de vouloir mourir. » Schmidt répondit par un son avant de se mettre à crier alors que Jenko venait de sauter dans son lit pour le réveiller. Le jour était déjà levé et il était temps de se préparer pour aller en cours. Les deux policiers marchèrent tranquillement dans les allées du campus pour se rendre en cours. Jenko en profita pour parler à Schmidt de sa rencontre avec Adam, négligeant les détails sur sa façon non dissimulé de le draguer. Ils se mirent d'accord pour aller faire un tour ce weekend et voir ce qu'il en est. Jenko enchaina ensuite sur les évènements de hier soir. Schmidt leva les épaules, c'était cool et Rooster était cool, si Schmidt lui-même pouvait intégrer leur bande en passant par le décoloré, il fallait saisir sa chance. Jenko acquiesça mais n'était pas aussi sure, il était un ancien « jock » et faire croire à des loosers qu'il était cool pour mieux les humilier, il connaissait… Son téléphone vibra alors qu'il disait au revoir à Schmidt pour se diriger vers sa classe. Son cœur fit un bond. Plusieurs jours sans nouvelle d'Eric, il était temps… : « From : The Witcher . Est-ce que les choses avancent ? » Il regarda son téléphone dépité avant de le bloquer de nouveau et de le ranger. Eric voulait faire le mort. Jenko hésita en prenant place dans l'amphi, il regarda les autres élèves qui s'installèrent tout en jouant avec son téléphone puis le débloqua : « To : Eric J'ai rencontré Adam, The Kid, il travaille au club et il m'a pris pour le fameux Mike. On pense venir au club ce weekend. » Il l'envoya et regarda son téléphone. Il ne s'attendait pas à une réponse rapide, mais peut-être qu'il pourrait la provoquer si il essayait une autre méthode : « To : Eric A croire que je lui ai tapé dans l'œil vu comment il m'a collé au cul toute la soirée. » C'était faux . Con et totalement absurde. Il voulait rendre jaloux Eric comme toutes ses exs faisaient avec lui et il savait très bien que ça n'allait pas marché. Mais c'était normal de vouloir des nouvelles de son petit ami , quitte à … « Hey Brad ! » Zook et Rooster arrivèrent pour s'installer à côté du brun qui les salua d'une main. Il rangea vite son téléphone et écouta les nouveaux étudiant arrivaient raconter la fin de soirée. Jenko écouta d'une oreille, l'esprit ailleurs. xXx La semaine passa rapidement et le weekend arriva. Les deux policiers étaient au point mort dans leur enquête. Jenko continuait de fréquenter Zook et l'équipe de football mais Schmidt se faisait plus distant, il se méfiait toujours d'eux. Pourtant Rooster essayait de le convaincre de les rejoindre mais non, d'ailleurs la première suspicion sur Rooster du à son tatouage avait été écarté : ce n'était pas lui, le tatouage était différent. Autre chose durant cette semaine, c'était le rapprochement entre Zook et Jenko, ils étaient devenus rapidement une team à deux mais ce qui inquiétait le policier s'était les remarques de Rooster sur le couple qu'il formait. Jenko s'était tût, mais Schmidt lui avait fait la remarque aussi… Cela était de plus en plus flagrant l'attirance de Zook pour Greg Jenko. Certes il y avait de la bromance entre eux mais là, ça dépassait le stade pour l'un d'entre eux… « Donc tu connaissais Adam ? » avait demandé Zook alors que le groupe marchait dans les rue de Maitarie pour aller dans un bar. « Non, je l'ai rencontré à votre soirée, il m'a dit qu'il se produisait sur scène et je me suis dit… pourquoi ne pas aller voir, ça changera des traditionnelles soirées bière. » Fit Jenko pour justifier leur sortie dans ce club. Zook n'avait pas répondu mais l'avait regardé longuement. Savait-il que par « produire sur scène », il s'agissait d'un club de stip tease ? Les deux policiers ainsi que Rooster et Zook avaient décidé de passer la soirée du samedi soir en ville. Jenko leur avait dit qu'il voulait faire un tour au Xquistie pour : « Allons là où les filles seront le plus à même de nous accueillir » Le sous-entendu avait fait beaucoup rire les deux jocks mais Schmidt avait soupiré et rouler des yeux. D'ailleurs il ne sentait pas forcement à l'aise avec eux mais il n'avait pas le choix, il y allait en tant que Morton Schmidt pas en tant que Doug Macquaid… ouais, en tant que policier… voilà. Ils commencèrent la soirée dans un bar étudiant, où le groupe ne se priva pas de consommer. Même si techniquement, ils ne pouvaient pas mais le bar n'était pas très regardant sur l'âge et Schmidt et Jenko faisaient loin de faire leurs âges. Au cas où le plus grand des policiers utilisait sa fausse carte d'identité. Dire qu'il avait réussi à faire croire à Eric qu'il en avait une lors de leur première rencontre tous les deux. Avec le recul, Jenko était sûr qu'Éric ne l'avait pas cru, il était trop malin pour ça et surtout détective dans les stups mais ça ce n'était qu'un détail de l'histoire. Une fois bien alcoolisé et Schmidt un peu moins, ils bougèrent aux Xquistie Club. Ils n'étaient pas accompagnés et pour dire vrai ils avaient peur de se faire refouler à l'entrée. « Au pire on se fera passer pour des potes gays » était intervenu Rooster. Schmidt soupira de nouveau, Jenko le regarda surpris et Zook…regarda en biais Jenko pour voir sa réaction. « Et comment on fait pour « passer pour des potes gays » ? Hein ? On l'écrit au marqueur sur le front ? » Interpella sarcastiquement Schmidt en faisant les guillemets avec ses doigts. Rooster prit la mouche, il n'aimait pas trop qu'on critique ses idées même si elle était totalement idiote. « Hé, moi au moins je propose quelque chose ! » « Propose quelque chose qui s'apparente à de l'intelligence alors… » Jenko et Zook regardèrent l'échange en riant, mais les stoppèrent ne voulant pas que les choses s'enivrent. Après tout, ces deux-là s'entendaient plutôt bien et Zook savait que Rooster avait le sang chaud. Ils n'eurent aucune difficulté à rentrer dans le club. Non, parce que le videur crut que Jenko était Mike et fut surpris qu'il passe par la porte principale avant d'ajouter « ah t'es venu avec des amis », ils n'eurent aucun mot à dire mais surtout aucune entrée à payer. Cela intrigua encore plus Jenko, ce Mike lui ressemblait vraiment au point qu'on les confonde ? Bon il n'allait pas se plaindre d'être rentrée gratuitement mais quand même ! Ce qui surprit davantage le groupe, c'était le bar/club qui était bondé ! Toutes les places autour de la scène étaient prises, ainsi que toutes les autres tables. Certaines femmes étaient debout mais toutes, toutes semblaient surexcité d'être là ! Il y avait une ambiance électrique qui se diffusait dans la salle que le groupe d'étudiant sentit, d'ailleurs ils étaient les seuls hommes… Par chance, ils virent une petite table en retrait libre, sans doute parce qu'elle n'avait pas bonne vu sur la scène mais au moins ils pourraient s'asseoir. Jenko les laissa partir et se proposa d'aller commander à boire, il ne leur laissa pas le choix qu'il se dirigea vers le bar. Eric avait dit qu'il bossait au bar, donc il devait être la ! Il s'accouda au bar et regarda les barmaids très occupés, mais il arrêta vite de regarder quand il sentit qu'on s'asseyait à côté de lui : c'était Adam. Celui-ci il fit un grand sourire charmeur en abaissant son chapeau de cowbow. Jenko l'observa de la tête au pied, Adam portait un foulard autour de lui, une fausse ceinture avec des pistolets, un slip et un sur-pantalon en couleur peau de vache avec des franche… C'était tout ! C'était… sexy. Jenko ne pouvait pas nier qu'il aimait ce qu'il voyait. Mais de nouveau, ça s'arrêtait là. Si Eric le voyait maintenant il était un homme mort. « On apprécie ce que l'on voit, à ce que je vois. » Jenko sursauta. Il pouvait dès à présent écrire son testament : il était mort. « Ah Erik , on peut aussi plaire à la gente masculine, pas d'homophobie ici. » Fit Adam en riant en se tournant vers le bar. « Et puis j'aurais pas dit non à un show privé. » Stop. Qu'il s'arrête de suite . Jenko se tourna vers le bar et vit son petit ami lui faire face. Il avait les bras croisé sur son torse et avait plaqué ses cheveux sur le côté. Cependant il n'avait aucun regard mauvais, c'était une bonne chose. Enfin il espérait … « Erik prend sa commande, c'est offert par la maison ! » « Dallas va pas aimer… » Fit Eric. « Je payerais avec mes pourboires. Sur ce Brad, j'espère qu'on se verra après ! » Il tapota l'épaule de Jenko avant de se diriger vers les coulisses, il fallait absolument qu'il parle avec Mike. Il voulait voir sa tête quand il lui présentera son « jumeaux ». Jenko et Eric le regardèrent partir. « Il a 19 ans. » fit Eric juste après. « J'ai rien dit ! » Répondit Jenko scandalisé vers le barmaid qui roula des yeux. « Ton regard parle pour toi » continua le détective « 4 bières ? Je t'ai vu rentrer avec Schmidt et deux autres gars. » Jenko acquiesça et se tourna vers la table : ils étaient en train de regarder autour d'eux à part Zook qui lui fit un signe à qui il répondit. Il se tourna de nouveau vers le bar et observa Eric avant de parler : « Pourquoi tu n'as pas répondu à mes messages ? » Eric le regarda en biais alors qu'il servit les bières en pression : « Parce qu'on est en mission. » « Et cela nous empêche de savoir comment l'autre va ? » « Non, mais on sait jamais. » Eric posa deux bières devant Jenko alors que les femmes autour commençaient à s'impatienter. « 'On ne sait jamais' ? Eric , tu crois que des hackers professionnelle vont s'introduire dans nos téléphones et nous démasquer ? Vraiment ? » Une autre bière posée. « C'est pas toi qui disait de ne pas mêler vie privé et boulot ? » Continua Eric nonchalant. Oui, c'était lui qui l'avait dit mais pas au point de couper les ponts. « Oui c'est moi qui est dit ça, mais j'aimerais un minimum savoir comment va l'homme qui partage ma vie, c'est trop demandé ? » Eric s'arrêta dans son mouvement surpris des dernières paroles de Jenko qui le regarda droit dans les yeux. Il allait répondre mais vit le blond qui avait fait un signe à Jenko s'approchait d'eux, il posa la dernière bière devant le policier sans un mot et parti sous le regard étonné de Jenko : « Hé dude, besoin d'un coup de main ? » Jenko se tourna vers Zook et lui signala que tout était ok, mais jeta tout de même un œil vers Eric avant de partir, celui-ci était de dos et servait des clientes… shit. « Merci à toutes d'avoir patienté pour notre prochain numéro » Un homme grand et assez maigre arriva sur scène. « Sans plus attendre mesdames, laissez-moi dans les bras mais surtout dans les mouvements sensuels qui vont faire plaisir à plus d'une d'entre vous, à…MAGIC MIKE ! » Le public exulta de joie alors que les lumières s'abaissaient pour se focaliser sur la scène, et en particulier sur un homme qui était déjà là. Il était habillé d'un gros jogging, un top tank blanc et une casquette rouge : on ne voyait pas son visage. Le groupe de garçon regarda autour d'eux assez surpris, les femmes criaient toute et commençait déjà à jeter de l'argent sur scène alors que le show n'avait pas commençait. « Vous avez vu ça » fit Rooster « Il pleut déjà des billets alors qu'il a juste les lumières sur lui. » Ils acquiescèrent tous et regardèrent la suite du show qui les laissa bouche bée. Ce Magic Mike avait un déhanché et un style de danse qu'ils n'avaient jamais vu. Ses mouvements étaient sensuels et dynamique, il accordait parfaitement sa danse à la musique en faisant des poses lascives, il n'hésitait pas à serrer son groin pour montrer la taille de celui-ci. Ce qui en résultat davantage de cris et des toussotements chez Zook, Rooster et Schmidt, Jenko lui… regardait ça comme envouté. Le gars dansait bien, vraiment bien, on ne pouvait pas nier qu'il arrivait à capter la salle par sa gestuels et l'aura qu'il dégagea mais ses pensée s'envolèrent quand Magic Mike jeta sa casquette dans le public. Jenko s'étouffa. Schmidt et Rooster furent scandalisé. Zook avait la bouche grande ouverte. Le show continua encore quelque minute pour se finir sur un homme à moitié nu. Le groupe d'étudiant, ne firent pas vraiment attention à la tenue quasi d'Adam de Magic Mike , à l'heure actuelle c'était leur cadet de leur soucis. Ils s'étaient tous tourné d'un seul homme vers Jenko : « Hé , je suis tout aussi surpris que vous ! » Jenko se tourna vers la scène où Mike remerciait le public. Ce n'était pas son sosie à ce stade la, mais son frère jumeaux caché ! Il lui ressemblait tellement que ça faisait peur. Ses parents avaient-ils omis de dire quelque chose ? Jenko se tourna vers Eric qui croisa son regard avant d'hausser deux fois les sourcils avec un sourire goguenard « Je te l'avais bien dit ! » Jenko prit sa bière et la but d'une traite, pourquoi c'était toujours à lui que ce genre de chose arrivait. Je vous avouerais que j'ai eu du mal à savoir comment bien mettre en place le crossover. J'avais voulu quelque chose de cohérent tout en restant dans l'esprit Jump Street et avec une rencontre Jenko x Mike qui soit... plausible LOL et c'est en regardant de nouveau la liste de cast de Magic Mike et les infos que oui Adam n'a que 19 ans ! Et qu'il peut très bien avoir été à l'université. J'en dis pas plus. En tout cas j'espère que vous avez aimé[Chapter 5] Blabla de l'auteur : Je vais rien dire...Comme je n'ai pas eu de retour sur les dernier chapitres, je me dis que c'est OK de poster tard... LOL je rigole ! Le pire dans tout ça c'est que j'ai de vrais excuse pour ce retard mais je ne préfère pas en parler ici, quoiqu'il en soit désolé Bonne lecture :p Enfin l'introduction de Magic Mike ! Docteur Jekyll and Mister Hyde Jenko voulait fuir et le plus rapidement possible, mais les autres voulaient rester et voir si les jumeaux – car c'était décidé pour Schmidt, Zook et Rooster que Magic Mike et Jenko étaient des jumeaux séparé à la naissance – allaient pouvoir se rencontrer. Il accepta à regret mais il avait besoin de boire. Il alla prendre un verre au bar, en espérant pouvoir parler de nouveau à Eric qui continuait de servir. Ce dernier lui fit un sourire quand il croisa son regard et s'approcha de lui : « Un alcool fort ? » Jenko acquiesça et s'accouda en bar, il jeta un œil derrière lui vers la scène pour voir Adam performer avec un autre homme, grand plutôt bien musclé avec une barbe de trois jours et des cheveux mi long ondulé. Ces gars dansaient vraiment trop bien. Lui qui dansait comme un pied, voir ça le mettait mal à l'aise pour son égo. Sans parler de toutes ces femmes prête à payer pour voir ça. Ce n'était même pas le fait qu'il venait voir un show d'hommes quasiment nus qui le dérangeait, loin de là, pour Jenko s'était juste du diversement. « Tiens. » Jenko remercia Eric en lui tendant un billet. Il était drainé pour aucune raison apparente mais la fatigue avait aspiré toute son énergie. « Tu devrais rencontrer Dallas ou alors Mike lui-même » Fit Eric en passant un coup de chiffon sur le comptoir. « Pourquoi ça ? » Jenko bu sec son verre de whisky « Tu pourrais travailler ici » Le policier fixa Eric. Il en était hors de question ! Pourquoi devait-il intégrer le club ? Eric était déjà là et lui et Schmidt devaient rester au campus de toute façon. Bon, oui ils n'avançaient pas dans leur enquête mais Jenko le sentait qu'ils allaient tomber sur quelque chose de gros dans les prochains jours. Il fallait juste leur laisser un peu de temps. Le détective soupira, avant de croiser les bras sur son torse et regarder Jenko : « Est-ce que tu sais au moins qu'Adam fournit des élèves au campus ? » Jenko resta silencieux et rebut une gorgé de son whisky. Non, il n'était pas au courant, mais là, il tenait une information. Il s'était juste demandé qui était Adam et s'il faisait partie de la fraternité mais il n'avait pas creusé plus loin. Après tout il ne l'avait vu qu'une fois, et dans une étrange rencontre. Pas de là, à en faire un suspect. « Adam semble t'avoir dans son radar, tu devrais saisir cette chance. » continua le brun derrière le bar en regardant tout de même autour de lui si une cliente n'avait pas besoin de lui. Jenko leva un sourcil interrogateur, Eric lui sous entendait qu'il devait se laisser draguer par un gamin qui avait quoi ? 19 ans à tout casser ? Pourtant il savait qu'Eric était du genre jaloux même s'il ne le montrait pas… D'ailleurs aucune remarque sur ses messages ? C'était l'occasion de lui faire comprendre qu'ils étaient ensemble et que de ne pas continuer de se donner des nouvelles ne servait à rien. « Saisir ma chance ? Comme je l'ai fait il y a deux ans avec Erik Molson ? » Jenko su qu'il avait touché le point sensible quand il vit Eric rouler des yeux et maugréer quelque chose : « Je te le déconseille. » « Oui Daddy . » Jenko se mit à rire et bu une nouvelle gorgée. Il fit un dernier clin d'œil à Eric avant de l'observer longuement derrière son bar. Il n'était pas discret et il le savait, mais c'était plus fort que lui. Eric lui manquait. Il but le reste de son verre cul sec. Il ne devait pas rester trop longtemps loin des autres, sinon ça allait devenir suspect. Il n'aurait pas dit non à un baiser échangé au-dessus du bar mais ça c'était juste un aller simple pour rentrer chez lui et se faire virer de Jump Street. xXx Le club était maintenant vide alors que le groupe d'étudiant avait été rejoint par Adam et deux autres étudiantes dont l'une venait de fêter ses 21 ans. Jenko et Schmidt comprirent que Adam avait suivi des cours avec Zook et Rooster et du à ses faibles notes et son comportement, il avait été viré, mais il revenait de temps à autre sur le campus pour les soirées. Il continua sur le fait qu'il avait enchainé les petits boulots dans les chantiers avant que sa route croise celle de Mike et qu'il le prenne sous son aile. Puis les autres danseurs firent leur apparitions, Jenko voulait être partout mais sauf dans ce club. Tito, Ken et Richie se stoppèrent net en voyant Jenko. « Je vous avait dit que j'avais trouvé le sosie parfait ! » fit Adam en riant de leur réaction. Mais la réaction la plus étrange fut celle de Michael Lane lorsqu'il croisa le regarde de Greg Jenko. C'était tellement étrange, se disait Schmidt en voyant les deux hommes s'observaient. Personne ne parla, pourtant l'ambiance n'était pas tendue mais ce n'était pas tous les jours qu'on voyait ça. Deux hommes qui ne se connaissaient pas et pourtant qui se ressemblaient parfaitement comme deux gouttes d'eaux. Schmidt et Rooster, particulièrement faisaient des allers-retours avec leur tête pour essayer de chercher la moindre différence. « Holy shit , Mike, tu t'es dédoublé ! » Dallas venait d'arriver et regarda la scène tout aussi surpris. Il s'avança vers Jenko. « Je ne savais pas que Mike avait un frère caché, pourquoi tu ne m'a rien dit Mike » Continua Dallas en se tournant vers son protégé. « Peut-être parce que je ne le savais pas. » répondit Mike à son tour surpris. Jenko ne fit pas un mot. Il attendait patiemment que la soirée se termine, priant fort en son for intérieur qu'elle se termine maintenant ! « Surtout que c'est mon frère » Fit Schmidt de but en blanc. Il ne se gêna pas de continuer malgré le blanc qu'il avait provoqué dans l'assemblé « Oui, c'est parce qu'on se ressemble pas qu'on ne peut pas avoir le même sang » Ce fut maintenant des visages d'incompréhension qui se lissaient sur le visage du petit groupe d'assemblé. Ce fut le rire claire du patron qui détendit l'atmosphère : « Hé, on me l'a fait pas à moi. J'y crois pas » « Moi aussi j'y ai pas cru et pourtant… La nature fait de drôle de chose » intervient Rooster « Bon, c'est pas tout mais je veux être en forme pour aller m'entraîner demain.» Le décoloré se leva et remercia Adam, suivit de près par Zook et les frères MacQuaid : « Attendez, attendez ! » Dallas avait le flaire quand une occasion se présenter à lui, et là, il s'entait déjà les billets entre ses mains que cette opportunité allait engendrer : « Hé les amis c'est le week end ! Erik ! Ramène de quoi faire boire tout ce petit monde… » « Non mais monsieur le patron » Fit Schmidt « nous devons y aller !\" « Vous n'allez tout de même pas refuser un dernier verre pour fêter une occasion pareil ! » Les 4 étudiants se regardèrent alors que les autres strip teaseur discutaient entre eux et avec les filles, déjà lassé de l'évènement et du coup de la surprise. A part Mike qui jeta de temps à autre des coups d'œil vers Jenko. « La ressemblance est frappante non ? » glissa malicieusement Adam à l'oreille du danseur. « Tu l'as rencontré où déjà ? » « Ah la dernière soirée d'Omega. » Adam prit une gorgé de son verre ne quittant pas des yeux Mike à ses côtés qui continua de regarder la situation face à lui. Ca le déconcerter mais pas au-delà, il ne croyait pas vraiment au âme sœur et au sosie. C'était Mel qui lui avait dit un soir qu'on avait tous un sosie dans le monde qui nous ressemble comme deux gouttes d'eau. Il avait rit avant de changer de conversation. Ce gars devaient être ce fameux sosie, il ne pensait pas qu'il vivrait dans la même ville et encore moins qu'il pourrait se rencontrer. Mais pourquoi pas… « QUOI ! Hors de question ! » Adam et Mike tournèrent leur attention vers le groupe plus loin. Dallas faisait maintenant barrage face au groupe d'universitaire qui le dévisageait tous les un des autres. Mike s'approcha curieux de savoir ce qui les mettaient dans un tel états mais il eu rapidement sa réponse quand le patron du Xquistie se mit à parler : « Je leur ai proposé de travailler ici, mais ils sont têtu et ne veulent pas ! Pourtant je pensais que les jeunes d'aujourd'hui ne disent pas non à l'argent facile. » Evidemment que tout le monde resta silencieux. Eux… Ici ? Mike et Adam regardèrent le groupe. Le sosie de Mike pouvait très bien passé ici, quand au blond et au mec qui semblaient aimer faire parti d'une équipe de foot pouvaient faire l'affaire mais le dernier… le frère de Jenko – c'est ça ? - … loin d'avoir quelque chose contre les personnes ayant du poids, il le voyait mal être dans un club de strip-tease. C'était juste le code de la maison d'avoir des hommes un certain type de musculation et surtout de bon danseur. Mike sentit le regard de Schmidt sur lui et dévia le regard : « Je sais que tu penses que je ne peux pas faire partie du club à cause de mon physique » Mike se défendit et fit évidemment que non. « Qu'est ce qu'il y a Mike tu as quelque chose contre les gros ? » demanda Dallas suspicieux en buvant son verre. «Si t'as quelque chose contre mon frère on peut s'expliquer mec ! » Fit Jenko prêt à se battre, si ça pouvait le faire sortir de là, il ne dirait pas non. « Ouais, on peut s'expliquer ! » rajouta Rooster à la surprise de tout le monde mais surtout de Schmidt qui n'arrivait pas à comprendre le comportement du quaterback depuis quelque temps. Mike mit ses mains devant lui en signe de défense : « Wow j'ai rien dit ! Dallas fait ce que tu veux, moi je me casse, je suis claqué. A la revoyure les gars » Il prit Adam avec lui sur le passage de la sorti qui salua vaguement les autres resté derrière. Il indiqua tout de même aux filles de les suivre. Eric en profita pour s'approcha du groupe et mettre en place la deuxième parti du plan. Il savait que Schmidt mais surtout Jenko ne serait pas du tout d'accord mais sur ce coup là, il le remercierait plus tard : « Je crois que vous devriez écouter Dallas les gars, surtout vous deux » Il pointa du doigt Jenko et Schmidt « Ca rendrait raide dingue notre clientèle de voir le sosie de Mike sur scène avec lui, comme deux frère jumeaux, imaginez leur fantasme. Quant à toi, tu incarnerais le changement, on est en 2015 et les femmes en ont aussi marre de tout le temps voir la même chose. Montrer que le club fait aussi monter sur scène d'autre type d'homme nous ouvrirais un autre type de clientèle et puis soyons claire : vous allez dire non à de l'argent facile ? Quoi de mieux pour avancer quand on est point mort . Vous voudriez pas passer à coté d'une telle occasion ?» Les dernières paroles étaient un avertissement clair à leur enquête. Les deux policiers se turent alors que tout le reste de l'assemblé était d'accord avec les paroles de leur nouveau barmaid. « Bien les gars vous avez entendu Erik ! Venez demain signer votre contrat, on verra après pour les modalités. » Jenko et Schmidt soupirèrent. Que pouvaient ils faire de toute façon. Erik leur avait dit clairement qu'on allait les jeter de cette histoire si ils ne faisaient rien. Donc autant se plier et faire avancer l'enquête. Jenko pris le verre que lui tendit Dallas pour fêter ça et le bu cul sec. Vivement que tout cela s'arrête. Derrière Dallas, Eric fit un sourire satisfait face à cela, il ne vit pas Tito se placer à coté de lui et interpréter son sourire d'une mauvaise façon : « Je ne pensais pas que les gars du type de Mike te plaisait ? » Eric sursauta, pas du tout sûr de comprendre : « Ce petit sourire en coin veut tout dire. Je pensais bien que les hommes te plaisaient mais pas du genre de Mike, alors que tu as beaucoup mieux devant toi ! » Ca avait été dit de manière douce aux creux de l'oreille. Chose qui n'échappa à Jenko et qui du faire preuve de sang-froid pour ne pas s'énerver. Bien. Peut être qu'il n'aurait pas du accepter tout court cette mission. Les problèmes ne faisaient que commencer… xXx Adam et Mike se retrouvèrent bien vite seuls. Ils s'étaient bien amusés avec les filles, bu, fumer un peu et Mike les déposa chez elles, avant de se tourner vers le coté passager et d'embrasser la personne à ses cotés. « J'ai bien cru que je ne pourrais pas faire ça . » Adam se mit à rire, il avait bien vu que depuis un petit moment son petit ami voulait se jeter sur lui mais il s'était retenu et avait eu un moment d'oublie quand il vit Jenko mais maintenant il ne se gêna pas. « Désolé de devoir casser tes rêves mais il va falloir encore attendre avant d'aller plus loin. » « Pourquoi donc ? » Fit Mike qui repris la route, un main sur le genoux de plus jeune à a ses cotés. « J'ai promis à ma sœur de rentrer chez elle ce soir. Elle commence à me demander un peu trop souvent pourquoi je dors chez toi. » « Il suffit que tu lui dise et les choses seraient réglés. » Adam ne répondit pas. Il voulait lui dire mais il avait peur que sa sœur lui en veuille personnellement. Il savait qu'elle avait des vus sur Mike et qu'elle aimerait pouvoir que sa se concrétise dans le futur et lui, et lui il dépendait de sa sœur, il ne voulait pas qu'il l'a jette à la porte pour une histoire comme ça. « Pas maintenant. » répondit Adam. « Si tu veux. » Fit Mike déçu. Adam changea de sujet pour éviter le malaise qui commençait à s'installer. « Tobias m'a proposé une soirée bientôt et vu qu'il semble que nous ayons des nouveau collègues, on pourrait leur proposer de venir. » Mike ne répondit pas. Adam aimait trop éviter les vrais sujets et voilà que c'était encore le cas. Il en avait marre. Mais loin d'être du genre à dire les choses tels quels étaient, le jeune entrepreneur préféra conduire en silence : « Tu ne dis plus rien ? » Fit Adam alors qu'il voyait qu'on approchait de chez sa sœur. Mike s'arrêta brusquement en plein milieu de la route, même si il était très tot dans la matinée il n'y avait pas grand monde sur la route, mais ca n'empêchait que cela était extrêmement dangereux ! « Mike ?! » Mike se tourna vers Adam et resta impassible face aux klaxons autour : « Quand tu aura décidé de parler de nous et que tu me dise clairement pourquoi tu ne veux pas en parler à ta sœur, là je me remettrais à te parler. Maintenant sors. » Adam resta stoïque, avant de sortir de la voiture avant que celle ci redémarre en trombe. Le jeune brun sous l'état de l'alcool et la fatigue cria un grand Fuck you, dans la rue quitte à réveiller ses voisins. Sur le coup, il en avait plus rien à faire. Mais au fond il était blessé, c'était plus qu'une question de temps avant que Mike ne décide de le quitter. Bien sure qu'il savait que c'était de sa faute mais de la, à réagir comme ça… Peut être qu'il devait finalement réfléchir à ça. Oui mais une fois sobre et d'avoir dormis. Fuck you and fuck that.

We share a passionate kiss then pull away minutes later.

'Never Let You Go' With that I close my laptop and go to sleep smiling. Ep 6. Jasmine POV: \"THIS was absolutely the best night of my life.\" I ran upstairs to my room, opened my laptop and tweeted: BEST day EVER with the most amazing guy! 'Never Let You Go' With that I close my laptop and go to sleep smiling. (3 months later) Jasmine: Me and Justin are more than happy. Right now i`m at his house, watching movies. We are watching the Last Song. Justin is in his kitchen, making popcorn. -Jasmine`s cellphone rings* Jasmine: Hello? Jasmine`s Mom: Hi sweety, I have great news! Jasmine: *Sit up immediately* What is it? Jasmine Mom: Well you still have school to go to, but I was able to enroll you into a highschool in LA. Jasmine: Really? Jasmine`s Mom: Yes! And I worked really hard to get you in there, so you cannot back out! Jasmine: Okay mom! I promise I won`t! Anyways, whats it called? Jasmine`s Mom: Hollywood High Jasmine: Great! When do I start? Jasmine`s Mom: In a week. Oh and I already put money in the credit card for your school supplies. Jasmine: Kay. Thanks mom love you. Jasmine`s Mom: Kay, bye sweety, I`ll miss you. Jasmine: Bye. *hang up* Justin: *walks in with the popcorn* Hey, who was that. Jasmine: Oh my mom. Hey I have something- *Jasmine was cut off by Justin's phone ringing.* Justin: *He looks down at the screen before getting up.* I`ll be right back babe. I have to answer this. *He gives Jasmine a peck on the lips before leaving the room.* Jasmine: *wait there for about a minute before he comes walking in.* Justin: Hey sorry it was my... mom. Jasmine`s POV: He said that in a oddly way which make me think hes lying. But I forget all about it when he takes a seat next to me and starts the movie. He puts his arm around me and brings me closer to him so I cuddle more into his chest. Through out the movie I notice that Justin is texting someone. I try to see who it is but he keeps hiding the phone so I can`t really see. When the movie ends I`m slightly mad at Justin because he is STILL texting that mystery person. Jasmine: Justin! Who are you texting? Justin: *Looks up from the screen* Oh sorry babe, I`ll stop texting. *he closes his phone and puts it in his pocket.* *Jasmine smiles and Justin smiles too and then drives her home.* Jasmine: Bye, i`ll see you tomorrow? Justin: Oh no, I`m sorry but I need to help my mom with...stuff. Jasmine`s POV: I nodded not to sure of what he is saying is really true. I leaned in to kiss him when all of a sudden his cell phone rings. I pull back and frown with my arms crossed. Justin looks at the phone then looks back up at me with a sorry look. I shake my head as I open the car door and walk towards the house. I hear Justin get out of his car and run after me. Justin: *Grabs Jasmine`s arm and turns her around* Look, I`m sorry please don`t be mad at me. Jasmine: *Sigh* I`m not mad at you I`m mad that the whole time while we were watching the movie, you kept texting someone. Justin: *Hugs you* I`m sorry, I promise it will never happen again. Jasmine`s POV: I nodded as I hugged him back. Justin pulls away and gives me a sweet and passionate kiss. Minutes later we both pull away. I smile at him before you peck his lips once more then get out of his grip and walk inside my house. I look out your window to see Justin turn around while taking out his phone and walking into his car. I`m still wondering who he is constantly talking to. I just say hi to everyone then go upstairs and open my laptop. I sign on Skype and see Kat online. I immediately click on her and wait till she appears on the screen. Kat: Hey Jasmine! Jasmine: Hey Kat. Kat: Okay, whats wrong? Jasmine: *tells her everything that happened just a few hours ago.* Kat: Maybe he doesn`t want to tell you because its a surprise? Jasmine: Or maybe hes cheating on me. Kat: Hey! Justin may be a lot of things but he isn`t a cheater! He really loves you I see it on all magazines. Jasmine: You can`t always believe what they say in magazines. Kat: I know but I trust him, and you should to. He is your boyfriend and you love him. Jasmine: *nods now understanding what she`s saying.* Kat: Exactly and if he ever breaks your heart, trust me he won`t get away with it. You`ve got me, Demi, Dallas, Nick, Joe, and many more people to kick his popstar little girl ass! Jasmine: Hey! Thats still my boyfriend you`re talking about! Kat: *Laughs* Right, sorry I got carried away. Jasmine POV: I laughed too and we continued to talk for hours. Before I know it its time to go to bed so I say bye and go to sleep. The next morning I wake up and decide to go out, even if its by myself. I take a short shower and do my hair and put on some shorts, a stripe blue and black tank top with a black vest and black converse. I walked downstairs and see Demi with her keys in her hands heading out for the door. Ep 7. Jasmine POV: I laughed too & we continued to talk for hours. Before I know it its time to go to bed so I said bye & went to sleep. The next morning I wake up and decide to go out, even if its by myself. I take a short shower & do my hair & put on some shorts, a stripe blue & black tank top with a black vest & black converse. I walked downstairs & see Demi with her keys in her hands heading out for the door. Jasmine: Hey wait! Where are you going? Demi: oh, I`m going to hang out with the boys on the JONAS set. Wanna come? Jasmine POV: At first I didn`t want to because I know Joe & Demi are going to be all lovey dovey but then I remember that Nick will be there & I haven`t hung out with him in a while so I agree. Demi drives to the set & immediately I see Nick playing baseball with Joe & Kevin. Demi parks the car then we both walk out. As I walked towards the set, I notice that the Wizards of Waverly Place set was right next to it. I just shake my head as I continue walking. When I get there Demi runs to Joe & I walk over to Nick. Nick: Hey Jasmine! Jasmine: Hey Nick! I haven`t seen you in soo long! *hugs him* Nick: *hugs her back* So since Demi and Joe are probably going to be gaga over each other the whole time, & Kevin is gonna be with Danni, wanna hang out with me? Jasmine: *nods and smile* *hours later* Demi: Aww I see a cute couple hugging. Jasmine: Ooo where? Demi: Over there. *points at two people & Jasmine looks that way.* Jasmine: Hmm they look familiar. Demi: *Realizes who they are and eyes widen* Oh god. Jasmine: What? Who is it? Demi: Just look very closely and you`ll find out.. Jasmine: *Confused* Okay well the guy has blondeish hair & the girl has black hair. Hmm..well the girl is definitely Selena Gomez...& the guy.. *They both pull away from the hug and Jasmine can now see their faces clearly.* Jasmine: Oh my god! Its..Justin! What is he doing here? He said he had to help his mom today! Demi: Maybe he finished early? Jasmine: \"*You gave her a look* He would`ve told me...So he really was lying to me yesterday. Demi: Then see if he lies to you today. Jasmine`s POV: I know what she meant so I took my phone out of my pocket & dialed his number. As I was calling him, I watched him from the binoculars. He & Selena were laughing at something. After it rang a couple of times, he finally answered. Justin: *Still laughing* Hello? Jasmine`s POV: I wanted to yell at him so badly for lying, because I`m the type of girl who doesn`t let anyone push me around, but I kept my cool. Jasmine: Hey baby Justin: *Stopped laughing as he motioned Selena to keep quiet* Um Hi babe. What up? Jasmine: Oh I was just wondering if you were done helping your mom yet so we could hang out. Justin: *Getting nervous, he`s not used to lying* Um sorry babe but no, I actually have a lot to do. Jasmine: Well how about I go over there and help you out? Justin: NO! I mean no babe its fine I`ll just help my mom by myself. Its actually a really bonding moment. But I`ll talk to you tomorrow. Love ya. *hangs up quickly* -He didnt even wait for Jasmine to respond.- Jasmine: *frown as she close her phone and turns to Demi. Demi: I`m so sorry. He`s a lying idiot. Jasmine: *You nod but then you get an idea.* Hey if he gets to hang out with her then I can hang out with..who`d make him jealous?\" Demi: Ummm... Nick? Jasmine: *smiles* Thats perfect! But how do I make him see us? Demi: Well...we are on the same set. Why don`t we act like were playing or something and we pass the Wizards set? Jasmine: Perfect! Now we just need to wait for the guys to take a break. Jasmine`s POV: Just then i felt two strong arms pick me up and spin me around. I squealed and screamed. Nick: *Laughed as he put you down* Wow you`re a scardey cat. Jasmine POV: I looked at him and then I started chasing him. I tackle him to the floor, holding him down. Jasmine: Say you`re sorry! Nick: God! Okay I`m sorry! Ep 8. Jasmine: Say you`re sorry! Nick: God! Okay I`m sorry! Jasmine: *smiles before getting up and helping him up too.* They both walk over to Demi & Joe. Demi gives Jasmine the look to tell them. Jasmine: Okay guys, I need your help. *Both Nick and Joe look at her.* Joe: What is it? Jasmine: Well you see the Wizards of Waverly Place set over there? *They both nod.* Jasmine: Well Justin is there. He lied & said that he was helping him mom when hes really hanging out with Selena. Nick: Okay? Why do you need our help? Demi: Well we were thinking that if Justin can hang out with Selena, then Jasmine can hang out with Nick. *They all look at Nick, waiting for him to agree.* Nick: *Sigh* Fine I`ll help but what do I have to do? Jasmine: *Hugs him* Thank you! Oh & all we have to do is have a GREAT time & act like we don`t even notice them, pretty simple since you`re all actors. Joe: *Mumbles* I swear she`s gonna use that over us or whole lives. Jasmine: *heard what he said & hit him on the chest* Hey! I will not! Demi: Hey don`t hit my boyfriend! Jasmine: *hits Joe multiple times* Haha! Just did! Demi: *looks at Jasmine before she starts chasing her.* Jasmine: *screams and runs* Demi: *laughs as she continues to run after Jasmine.* Joe: *smirks & says to Nick* Ha man! TWO girls are fighting for me AND they`re sisters! Jasmine & Demi: *stop as they hear him and look at each other, nod & run to him. They both tackle him to the ground & start tickling him. He starts laughing hard trying to get you both off.* Nick: *laughing* Haha man! Now they`re gonna tickle you to death! Jasmine: *looks up at him & smirk* Nick: *his eyes widen as he starts to run away.* Jasmine: *gets off of Joe & jump on Nick`s back.* Nick: *holds Jasmine on his back* Haha! Wasn`t very smart now was it? Jasmine: *hold onto him tight as she screams* Nick! Put me down! Nick: *shakes his head as he starts running around.* Jasmine: Nickkkkk! Jasmine POV: He just keeps running & soon I see Joe walk up with Demi on his back, who was hitting him trying to make him let her go. Demi: Shoot! He`s strong! Jasmine: *nods as she start to hit Nick`s back.* Joe & Nick: Stop doing that! Jasmine and Demi: Not until you put us down! *Joe & Nick look at each other and nod.* *Both Jasmine`s & Demi`s eyes widen.* Jasmine: Oh you better not... *Joe and Nick take off. They run really fast with Jasmine & Demi still on their backs.* Jasmine: Ahhh! Nick! *holding onto him tighter.* Demi: *Laughs* Hey Jas, this is pretty fun. Jasmine POV: Pretty soon I started laughing too & the boys soon stop. Nick: *Frowns* Why are you laughing? Joe: Yea, you`re supposed to be scared. Demi: Well its pretty fun. Jasmine: Now giddy up! *She says as she hits Nick`s head.* Jasmine POV: We`re all laughing and having a great time before I see Justin, not too far away sitting on a chair next to Selena, laughing and talking. Jasmine: Stop! *Both Nick and Joe stop. Demi looks at Jasmine confused.* Jasmine: Justin is over there, just telling ya. *They nod & both Nick & Joe start to run again, slightly tired. Jasmine & Demi laugh* Demi: Oh hurry up! Jasmine: Come on! My grandma can walk faster then you! *They both just stand there taking in deep breaths.* Demi: Come on Joe! You can soo run faster than Nick! Jasmine: Nooo! Nick can run wayyy faster! Demi: *smirks at Jasmine* Wanna race? Ep 9. This is the ep I edited and rewrote. Hope you guys like! (P.s. I didn't rewrite much in this. They were supposed to breakup I just rewrote how they did it) Jasmine: Nooo! Nick can run wayyy faster! Demi: *smirks at Jasmine* Wanna race? Jasmine: Totally! Winner gets 10 bucks! Demi: Deal! *she shakes Jasmine`s hand* Jasmine: Ready! Set! Go! Jasmine`s POV: Nick and Joe take off and I hold on tight to Nick because he`s running pretty fast. Jasmine: Ha! Nicks on the lead! Demi: No Joe is! *They race all the way to the end of the place, which was where the Wizards set was.* Jasmine: Poned! Nick and I won! Nick: *trying to catch his breath* Nick and I? More like Nick! Jasmine`s POV: Me and Demi just laugh. Pretty soon the guys start laughing too. But we were all intrrupted by an angry voice, that belonged to Justin. Justin: What the hell is going on here?\" *they all turn to an angry Justin standing next to Selena.* Jasmine: *acts confused as she gets off of Nicks back* Justin? What are you doing here? *He just ignores Jasmine as he grabs her arm and drags her away.* Jasmine: *pull away from his grip* Well? What are you doing here? Justin: That doesn`t matter what matters is what you are doing here. Jasmine: I`m hanging out with my friends and sister, is there a problem? Justin: *now talking a bit louder* Uh yea, you`re on that guys back! Jasmine: *ignore what he says* Why don`t you answer why you are here! Justin: *angry and is now lying* I just got here! I JUST finished helping my mom! Jasmine: *angry too* You`re lying! I saw you here a long time ago! You never did help your mom did you! Justin: What? Now I can`t hang out with my friend? Jasmine: And I can`t hang out with mine? Plus you lied about it! Justin: *ignores the last part* No because he likes you more than friends! Jasmine: Just like she likes you more than friends! Justin: And? I can control myself! I`m not on her back! Jasmine: You can`t control yourself! Thats why you was hugging her! Justin: What? You`re spying on me now? *he quickly glances away to see Demi,Joe,Nick,and Selena looking at them listening* Jasmine: No! I just saw it cause I was hanging out with Nick and Joe since you were 'busy' helping your mom when you were really spending time with her! Justin: See this is why I didn`t tell you! I knew that youd be jealous! Jasmine: *getting more angrier* Me? Jealous of what? Justin: *is really angry now & isn`t paying attention to what hes saying* Jealous that I`m actually hanging out with a girl who is better than you! Jasmine`s POV: I stared at him with a lite angry, shocked look on my face. He stared at me intensly. I looked at him slightly laughing. But these were giggles of disbelief and anger. I then looked away and closed my mouth. Tears started to form in my eyes. Then he realized what he just threw out his mouth. Justin: *realizes what he said* Oh god, Jasmine I didn`t mean- *he touched your arm* Jasmine`s POV: I pulled my arm away quick. I glared at the ground, with a fed-up look on my face. I tried hard to talk threw my tears. \"Justin I trusted you. To tell me the truth. To never lie to me. To never say ANYTHING like you just did to me. But you proved me wrong\" two hot tears ran down my face. Then I looked at him. \"I don't know if your cheating on me-\" I started but I saw the look on his face, like he was about to say something. I looked back at the ground putting a finger infront of his face telling him to wait. \"But I don`t care\" I lowered my finger and looked at him with the most hurt look on my face. \"Don't call me, don't text me, don't ever try to communicate with me-we are through\" I with that I ran off crying, going who knows where. I was really hurt. I saw how Demi,Joe,Selena,and Nick, and everyone else in that big room stopped whatever they were doing to stare, and listen to us. I kept running. I could hear Justin screaming for me. I don't look back. Demi: Jas? Jasmine! Jasmine: *doesn't stop running* Demi: *Turns to Justin angry, still staring at him while she says:* Nick go find her, take her home. *she walks over to Justin, Joe following behind* Nick: *takes off* Justin: *trying to run after Jasmine but Demi stops him* Demi: Why the hell would you say that to my sister? Justin: *sigh* I didnt mean it Demi. Demi: *getting angrier* You know, I did nothing but support you! And you go off and break my sisters heart? *turns to Selena not far behind* And you! We used to be best friends. We've known each other since Pre-K, in Dallas. Both of you, don't lie, are you dating? *she turns to Justin* Ep 10. Justin: No way! Selena: Justin..! Justin: *sighs* This is our second date Demi: WHAT'S WRONG DID YOU JUST GET TIRED OF HER! *walking closer to Justin, balling up her fist* Joe: *holding Demi back* Justin: No! I-...I don't know *then he looks up at Selena* Selena I'm sorry. I'm in love with Jas. She's my one and only. I wasn't Thinkign when I asked you out. Can we just be friends? Demi: If thats ok with Jasmine. And right now...she doesn't even wanna be with-in yards of you Selena: Look I've gotta go. This is way too much drama for me. Justin, call me when you make up your mind k?(she's being a smart-ass when she says this) *Walks away* Demi: *glares back at Justin* I'm going to go see if Jasmine's ok. I really do hope you get a life Justin. I really, really do. *she turns, grabs Joe's hand and speed walks in the direction Jasmine went in* Justin: *standing there* With Jasmine and Nick Jasmine`s POV: I ran and ran and ran till I couldn't run anymore. I ended up in an old playground. I sat down on a swing and cried my eyes out. Why would he do this to me? Why did he say that? I never ever thought this would happen. I'm still deeply in love with him. I'll never let him go. I have no clue how long I was crying. I fell asleep on a bench. It was dark when Nick found me. \"We've be looking all over the place for you Jas\" he said. I didn't respond making him think I was sleeping. But I was up about 15 minutes before he found me. I was just laying there. Thinking. Thinking about what happened after I left. Thinking about what Demi might have did. Nick bent down unfront of me. He saw my eyes open through my hair. I didn't look up at him when he was infront of me. I still just layed there. \"Jas are you ok?\" he asked. HELL NO I WASN'T OK! I wanted to slap him for asking me such an obvious question. But still I just layed there. Speechless as a doll. I realized he just wanted to help me. So I said \"Can you talk me home?\" no emotion, noting else moving but my lips. \"Sure\" he said, and picked me up, and carried me to his car. He opened the passenger door and put me inside. All the emotion was ripped out of me. I was just staring blankly. I looked down at my fingers and started to play with them. Nick took out his phone before he pulled off. \"I`ve otta tell them I found you. Then he finished his text and drove off. It was silent. Till I broke out crying. I can't believe I broke up with him. My first love! Nick pulled over and hugged me. I didn`t hug back, but cried into his chest. I soon stopped but he didn't let go of me. Jasmine: Nick, maybe he`s right.. Nick: No way in hell is he right. Jasmine: No, I mean *looks up at him, still teary eyed* he deserves someone better then me. I mean I`m just a normal teenager while he`s this superstar. *Looks down* I`m not good enough for him. Selena IS better than me. Nick: *lifts Jasmine chin* Hey, Selena ISN`T better than you and any guy would be lucky to have you. You're smart, sweet.. Jasmine`s POV: I blush. \"Funny, Pretty, Talented-\" hell no..does he know I can sing? \"How?\" I asked. \"Demi showed me the video of you singing. Your amazing\" he said looking at me. I blush again. \"And if you've ever heard Selena sing in real life..she sound like a dieing animal\" I laugh. \"Nicholas be nice\" I said feeling better. My phone vibrates. It`s a text...from Justin... I'm cuming 2 ur house, please cum talk 2 me babe. I ask Nick if he could run upstairs while I talk to Justin when we get obeys and as soon as we get there I gave him the keys and he heads upstairs while I waited until Justin got to my house, got out of the car and walks over to me. Justin: *sightly crying* Jasmine, I didn`t mean what I said, please I was just angry. Jasmine: *sigh. I hated to see him cry, even if he did break my heart, I still loved him* Well Justin, sometimes when people are angry, they say the truth. Justin: *grabs her hands* Please, I`m sorry. Jasmine: *pull your hands away* Don`t be, cause you were right, She is better than me, infact way better. Justin: Jasmine- Jasmine: *cut him off* No Justin! You deserve someone better than me! I`m a no one! Go and date someone who is famous! Like Selena or Miranda! I`m sure that they`ll fit your taste. Justin: *now crying a bit more* I don`t want them! They aren't like you! I want YOU! I need you, I love you! Jasmine: I love you too, but thats what we need to do when we love someone, let them go. Justin: *looking down* No Jasmine. Jasmine: Goodbye Justin, I hope you have a good life. Jasmine`s POV: I gave him one last kiss on the cheek before I walked into the house & shut the door. I slide down the door as I start crying again. That was the hardest thing for me to do, break up with the guy I loved and what hurts even more is that I thought that he`d be there with me forever, and he`d never break my heart. But he did. I heard foot steps coming towards me and I know its Nick when he swoops me into his arms and takes me up the stairs. He lays me down on the bed and is about to leave when I talked up. Jasmine: *shaky voice* Nick, don`t leave me please. Nick: *nods before getting into bed with her and pulling Jasmine into his chest.* Jasmine`s POV: I cry into his chest as I cuddle into his chest. Minutes later I want to cry more but I know that Nick is still there so I don`t want him to see me crying, I look up at him. Jasmine: Nick, I`m sorry. Nick: *confused* For what? Jasmine: I know you hated Justin and you probably were trying to warn me not to go out with him because he`d break my heart, and I didn`t listen to you. So now you can tell me I told you so. I probably deserve it anyway. Nick: *hugs Jasmine* I`m not going to do that. And I didn`t hate him, I was just a little jealous I guess. Jasmine: *confused* Jealous? Of What? Nick: Well I thought he got all the girls I either dated or liked. I mean 1st Miley, then Selena, & then you. Jasmine: You liked me? Nick: Well yeah. Jasmine: *kisses his cheek* Thats so sweet but- Nick: I know you`re not ready for a relationship, don`t worry. Well just be friends. Jasmine: More like best friends. Jasmine`s POV: With that we hugged, but then I remember something, well more like a someone, Kat. I HAD to tell her what happened. So I took out my laptop and logged into Skype and clicked on her contact. She appeared on the screen and I immediately started telling her everything while Nick just sat there waiting. When I was done, she gave me a sorry look. Kat: Oh Jas, i`m soooo sorry! Jasmine: Don`t be..I did the right thing right? Kat: Of course you did! You NEVER let a guy break your heart! Jasmine: I know that but I still love him. Kat: Well you`ll forget about him when that cutie (refers to Nick) will help you get your mind off him! Jasmine & Nick: *blush a deep shade of red* Jasmine: KAT! Kat: Chill! I`m just kidding! Jasmine: *hears the chatter of Demi and Joe outside then a car door slam* Listen Kat, I gotta go Demi and Joe are here. Kat: kay kay, bye Jasmine POV: I signed off but I decide to tweet something before I closed my laptop: I thought I`d be a wreck without you, when in truth I won`t because I have people around me who care about me and love me. Goodbye for now. I loved you. 1 MONTH Jasmine`s POV: I keep trying to think that I`m over Justin when I really am not. I still love him and I never stopped. I`ve been hanging out with Nick more and we`re great friends. I still talk to Kat at times but I am more closer to Nick than her now. I`ve also dropped out of school because I've started up with a music carreer, and making songs. Nick talked to his manager about me and got me my own manager. Sooner than I know it I`m in the studio making \"Serious\". (If you haven't heard got on youtube and look up Jasmine V serious). I really becoming known and reconized. And you know that when you've got paparitzi following you around everywhere. Me and Nick are going on a thing today. I really don't know what to call it. We're going as friends. I was still getting over Justin. I couldn't afford another heartbreak. I was putting on my eyeshadow when something grabbed me by the waist and picked me up. I screamed and smiled. Who else? It was Nick. Jasmine: Nicholas! Put me down! Nick: *laughs as he puts her down* How did you know it was me? Jasmine: *straighten her dress* Cause there is a mirror right here! Nick: Oh.. Jasmine: *laughs* Nick: Well are you ready? Jasmine: Yes. Who let you in by the way? Nick: The door was unlocked Jasmine: *looks at Nick* So you let yourself in? *walks out the house and locks the door after Nick leaves out. Heads to the car and opens the door* Nick: *gets in* So, where do you want to go? Jasmine: I don`t know..O0O how about the movies! Nick: *starts driving* Sure. -Minutes later, they both arrive at the movies.- Nick: What do you want to watch? Jasmine: Um...how about Nightmare on Elm Street! Nick: *shrugs* Sure, whatever you want. *To the ticket lady* Two tickets to Nightmare on Elm street. Ticket Lady: That`ll be 13.30 Jasmine: *about to take out her wallet when Nick stops her.* Nick: Its okay, I got it. *He pays the lady* Ticket Lady: Nice boyfriend you got there. Paying for the tickets. Such a gentleman. Jasmine: *slightly blushes* Um..he`s not my boyfriend. Nick: Yea, were just friends. *slightly disappointed.* Jasmine: *notice and decide to give him a kiss on the cheek* Best friends. Nick: *smiles at Jasmine and holds her hand while grabbing the ticket.* Come on, lets go. Jasmine`s POV: We both walk away but I could hear the ticket lady mumble. \"Aw young love.\" I smile to myself as I walk into the movie theater. When the movie was done, I was walking out laughing, while holding onto Nick's hand. Jasmine: *laughing* Ahaha! The way he sneaked up on her then dashed her throat was so funny! Nick: *look at you weirdly* You Lovatos are weird. Jasmine: Hey! Just because I thought a girl dying was funny, doesn`t mean I`m weird! Nick: Yeah, yeah, come on lets go. They both walk to Nick`s car and he drives Jasmine home. Jasmine: I had an awesome time Nick. *smile* Nick: Well I`m glad of that. Jasmine`s POV: We both just smile at each other. Minutes later, we both snap out of it and he gives me a quick hug before leaving. I just smile to myself as I walk into the house. Demi pops out of nowhere in front of me. I jump, startled a bit. Demi: Were you just with Nick? Jasmine: Um yeah, why? Demi: I smell a cute couple! Jasmine: *rolls her eyes* Oh come on were just friends. Demi: Fine, whatever you say. I just wanted to tell you that were going to Grammys tomorrow. Jasmine: What? I don`t want to go! Demi: Oh come on why not? Jasmine: Oh, I don`t know maybe its something that rhymes with Bustin Jieber and Gelena Somez. Demi: Huh?...Oh I get it. Well Nick will be there with you, so will I & Joe & Kevin &- Jasmine: Okay, I get it. I`ll go but only if Nicks going. Demi: Then we better go dress shopping tomorrow. *walks off* Jasmine`s POV: I was in deep thought. Not ANOTHER awards show. At my first awards show, I met Justin, so its likely that I would bump into him or even him and Selena. I didn`t want to go but I had to prove to Justin that i`m strong and he can`t break me. I HAD to go to this awards show. I was ready for anything. (Next Day) Its tomorrow and I got up early to go dress shopping with Demi. I bought a short sparkly, silver dress with black high heels and a matching silver purse. I let Demi do my hair and makeup because she wouldn`t stop bugging me about it. She put red lipstick with purple eyeshadow and black eyeliner and a little bit of blush. I had to admit that she did a pretty good job and I looked amazing. I had on some jewelry and she curled my hair a bit, leaving some parts a bit straight. By the time she was done, it was already 5 o`clock. We were both in the living room waiting for the boys and Danni to come. 5 minutes passed and that`s when I heard the doorbell ring. Me and Demi got up immediately and opened the door to reveal Joe and Nick, both in tuxes. Nick was in a black and white one, slightly matching with your dress while Joe was in an all black tuxedo, matching with Demi's black dress. Joe and Demi walk off, leaving me and Nick standing there, looking at each other. Nick: Um, wow you look gorgeous. Jasmine: *blushes* Thanks Nick, you look very handsome. Jasmine`s POV: He smiles at me and took his hand out, waiting for me to grab it. I giggle before grabbing his hand and walking to the car with him. I think to myself about how I might be falling for him. And as much as I hated to admit it, Nick and Justin were alike in many ways. Before I knew it, We arrived at the Grammys and millions of cameras were flashing, waiting for me, Demi and the boys to come out. We get out and I`m holding Nicks hand while walking down the red carpet. I hear the paparazzi scream Nick`s and my name, asking if we were dating. I simply shook my head while Nick answered \"No, were just best friends.\" Pretty soon Nick and I are talking to an interviewer asking about our music and new thing coming up soon. We finish and I then hear the paparazzi screaming Justin`s name. 'Oh no' I think to myself. He was probably near me because I hear the paparazzi right next to me screaming his name too. Then I heard them scream Selena`s name too. My eyes pretty soon land on Justin and Selena, posing for picture, smiling. I can`t seem to get my eyes off of them, like my eyes were glued still to them. Pretty soon Justin looks over and locks eyes with mine. I look away and make sure Nick still got my hand. So we both walk off and start posing for pictures too. I still can`t get Justin off my mind so i`m starting to get frustrated with myself. Just then Joe walks over and whispers something in Nick`s ear. I could see Nick get mad. Nick: Joe, I`m not going to do it! Joe: Come on man its just a picture. Nick: I don`t care. Joe: Well we have to, dad said it could be better for our publicity. Jasmine: What are you guys talking about? Nick: *sighs* Jas, our dad wants all of us to take a picture with Justin. Jasmine: *frowns* No its okay, its just a picture. Nick: You don`t have to come with us if you want. Jasmine: No, I want to. *Jasmine, Nick, Joe and Kevin walk off to where Justin was standing with Selena. Demi and Danni already went inside to get to the seats.* Jasmine`s POV: I walk over by Justin and Selena still holding Nicks hand. I feel Justin scanning us. So when the picture finishes and everyone walks away, I stop Nick and kiss him on the cheek. I made sure Justin was still watching us. I turn around and walk with Nick into the building holding his hand tight. Me and Nick whisper and talk the whole time we wait. Justin is a row behind to the right. Me and Nick start to flirt, and I lay my head on his shoulder for a quick second. He put his arm around me. He whispers in my ear \"I really think Justins about to blow he hasn't stop staring at us since the red carpet\" I smile and glance at the crowd ahead of me but looking at Justin at the corner of my eye. While Selena was talking to David Henry beside her, he was looking dead at me. I hear an annoncment \"All of the presenters that will be going upstage today has an invitation under their chair telling them who they will be presenting with. We will began in 20 minutes\" the lady finished and everyone looked under their seats. Suprisingly I had one! I grabbed it excitedly. Demi who was sitting beside Nick looked at me. \"Wow girl! You're popular enough to be a presenter at the Grammys! I'm so proud!\" she said reaching over nudging my leg. Nick looked at me and smiled. I waved it in his face and bragged. \"Show off\" he said and rolled his eyes, I read the card \"You have been chosen to be a presenter this year! You will be presenting BEST SONG OF THE YEAR with JUSTIN BIEBER \" That`s just terrific![Chapter 2] You Broke My Heart Jasmine`s POV: I read the card, \"You have been chosen to be a presenter this year! You will be presenting BEST SONG OF THE YEAR with JUSTIN BIEBER \" That`s just terrific! \"You have between commercial breaks to find this person and come up with funny material. Good Luck!\" How come out of all people here, Justin is presenting with me? WHY! I bet they did this on purpose. They knew my love for Justin is still alive and that Justin moved on with Selena-did I cover that? No? Oh, well Justin and Selena are dating. It appears to be on EVERY FREAKIN' TEEN MAGIZINE! Me and Nick made it on one. Apparently you can't go to lunch dressed nice, with a friend who's a girl. Or you can't hold your friend who's a boys hand at the park. Or you can't even drive in the same limo to a party taking you friend who's a girl as a date too!...Omg. I SOUND FREAKIN CRAZY! Of course they think we're a couple, we show too much signs! But I'm falling for Nick. Hard. No denying that. I thought about all the times we spent together. Which is memories of everyday. Me and Nick are together constantly. Doing all kinds of things together. Skating, Skeeing, scubba diving, going on rollercoasters, singing, dancing, eating, shopping, partying watching movies or on TV, do homework together, even have sleepovers. Well that one time. It was pouring down raining and there was no power anywhere so I had to stay with Nick and Joe till the rain stopped. Which was the next morning. But it was fun! The JONAS parents weren't home so we just when crazy! I smile thinking about it. Then something, more like someone, snapped me out of my thougts. \"Hey Jasmine?\" a familiar voice behind me said. I turned around. Justin, barley smiling, waved at me. Then he put up the card he got saying I was presenting with him. \"Yea..\" I said failing to sound happy and excited and not angry and nervous. I smiled big, standing up to pull my dress down alittle because it was bunching up. Trying to look hot for him. It worked too. From the corner of my eye Justin was checking me out. I've wanted to fix my dress for 15 minutes I just didn't feel like standing back up. Glad I didn't. Then, still looking out of the corner of my eye I saw Selena turn to Justin and is about to start talking to him, but she looks in the direction he looking, sees me, then looks back at him, then back at me, then finally back at him. \"Justin!\" she said in disbelief of his obnoxiousness reminding him she was still there. Justin snapped out of it and looked at her. \"Yea?\" he said acting like he wasn't doing anything. \"You were totally checking her out!\" she said looking at him. He looked confused. \"Um I have a name\" I said still standing looking at her. \"Yes, I'm aware of that\" she replied being a smartass. If nobody does it tonight, I'm slapping her. \"Don't be a smart-ass\" I said and I sat back down. Well, nobody made a rule I have to be nice to my ex's girlfriend. I looked over at the crowd infront, again looking at Justin from the corner if my eye. He had his hand over his mouth but it was obvious he was chuckling. Then Selena said \"Justin can we talk?\". He looked at me \"I've gotta work on what we're gonna do for the show with Jasmine\" even though I'd been listening I acted like a wasn't when I turned and said \"Huh?\" then they both looked at me. Justin smiled, Selena looked annoyed as hell. \"I said I've gotta work on what we're gonna do for our presenting\" he said. \"Oh\" I said back. Then somebody walked up to me. It was some random guy. I think he worked and organized for the Grammy awards. RG: *whispers in Jasmine's ear* Jasmine: REALLY!-*quieter* really? RG: *Nods* come back stage during commercial one Jasmine: Sure! No problem! RG: *walks away* Jasmine`s POV: OHMYGOSH! I'm performing in place of Miley Cyrus! Unreal, Unreal! I just sat there in shock. I'm performing at the Grammy Awards! AT THE GRAMMY AWARDS! But it's sad Miley got sick at the last moment. BUT I'M PERFORMING AT THE GRAMMY'S! I'M THE FIFITH PERFORMER AT THE GRAMMYS! I think Nick had enough of the expression on my face because after staring at me for a long time he finally asked \"Soo..What did he say? Why are acting weird\". I looked at him as my smile grew bigger. \"I'm performing tonight!\" he looked at me shocked then he hugged me. \"Oh my gosh thats huge!\" said Nick. \"I know! I have to go backstage during commercial one, to get it organized. Apparently Miley was supposed to perform but she got sick. So I get to perform!\" I said smiling. Nick grabbed my hand a squeezed it. I got butterflies for some reason. Me and Nick have held hands thosands of times and I never felt like this. Even though I think I'm in love with the guy. Soon enough I was backstage getting my make-up done. I'm doing my new song \"All These Boys\". I have on a gold leather jacket with black buttons, a black plain t-shirt underneath it, some leather pants, and black leather knee-high combat boots. We already went over the dances: At the begining, me and two boys are dancing, second time chorus about 10 more boys come out and dance, then go off for the bridge, then come back for a solo break dance part. After awhile I come back in and dance with them then it goes back to final chorus, then the big finish. Then ten boys run off stage leaving the first two boys from the begining, they lift me up (a second time in the whole thing), flip me around, then still in the air I sit on their arms like a chair. The make-up artist finish my lip gloss and tell me to wait on the rightside of stage, and that my que will be up in 10 minutes. My hair is different from before, it was curled, but bigger and poofier. My lipgloss is pink, and so is my blush. I have on gold eye shadow and black eyeliner. I look hot, but I'm sooo nervous! The biggest stars sitting right in front of me watching me sing, and dance. Lord knows some of then are stuborn and will be drinkin' hateraid during my performance. Demi always tells me \"If they don't like it, their jealous they don't have it like you do\". I kept this in my brain since I was 5. During the commercial break Nick, and Demi come to give me support and words to make me less nervous. Then they take their seats when they start calling me to get in position for the song. The walls are closed. Some woman runs up to me and gives me a wireless mic you can fix to face to your mouth. I put it on while they said \"And we're on!\". Then I heard \"And now Jennifer Lopez and Ryan Seacrest\". Jennifer started \"This next performer is an amazing singer and extrordinary dancer\" then Ryan \"She started off her carreer in Febuary making her hit song 'Serious' \" then Jennifer \"And she blew us all away with not only her beauty but the beauty in her voice\" then Ryan \"Now here she is tonight singing her new song \"All these Boys\" Now both of them \"Jasmine V!\" and the crowd starts to clap loudly, then the walls open. I'm already in position. Here we go!

She waves and walks offstage* Justin: *standing up and clapping* Selena: *sitting down, just sitting there. Even though she had to admit it was amazing* Nick/Demi/Joe: Yay Jasmine! Woooo! *after about two minutes of standing ovation they go to break* Jasmine`s POV: I went backstage to change. Then Demi and Nick came backstage with me when I was back in my dress. \"Did you know you got a two minute standing ovation?\" Demi said hugging me. \"Yea Jas that was amazing\" Nick said hugging me next. I smiled thanked them and I went with them back to our seats. Justin tapped me on the shoulder and handed me something, some kind of paper, he also said \"That was fanomanal\" her smiled and so do I \"Thanks, can wait till you and Usher perform\" I whispered and we both went back to listening. I opened up the paper, it read Presenting Script Justin: Good evening everyone Jasmine: I hope you guys are having a good time Justin: Of course they are with your amazing performance! Everybody give it up for Jasmine one more time! (The people clap) Justin: And need I mention you look gorgeous tonight Jasmine: Thank you! you look not shabby youself, and your performance was ok. Omg Usher yours was like the Best! Justin: Wait how does he get The Best! but I get ok and not too shabby? Jasmine: *stares at him; Changes the subject* So tonight we'll be presenting \"Best Song Of The Year\" Justin: You...You just..changed the...ok! With the style,flare, and creativity they put together some rockin' music. Jasmine: Here are the nomanies for \"Song of the year\" (Idk what the nommines are) Jasmine: And the winner is...*takes the slip out the card but Justin takes it* Hey! Justin: Tell me I look sexy and that I did just as good as Usher in my performance Jasmine: Justin! Justin: Jasmine! Jasmine: *sighs* Fine! Justin you look sexy and you did just as good as Usher Justin: Thank you that means so much coming from you! Jasmine: *kisses Justin's cheek, but slips the card away at the same time* Justin: Hey! Jasmine: And the winner is...(says the winner) Jasmine`s POV still: I look back at Justin and smile. \"You like it?\" he asked. Selena looked at me, I could see hate and jealousy in her eyes. \"I love it\" I said and winked. And when it was our turn, I got Usher to wave at me, and a lot of laughs. Plus we got an aw because I kissed Justins cheek. Demi won! We both hugged her and she gave her speech. We walked off the stage. There wasn't much after that we had our last performers which was Emienem, Skyler Grey, and Dr. Dre, singing Doctor. And before I knew it we were at the after party. Selena, wasn't ok with that kiss on the cheek apparently. She bitch slapped Justin later on at the party. At least that's what I heard. Me and Nick are on the roof of the Party. Eatting, laughing, talking. \"Soo..that kiss with Justin..\" but I interupt \"Nick-\" but he finishes \"I'm just saying,\" he started, I said \"It was a kiss on the cheek, nothing big\" I looked at me and blinked, so I reached over and touched his hand, \"It was nothing\" and he shook his head and continued to eat. I didn't realize we were holding hands across the table, but I liked it. He kept squirming and trying to talk but every single time he stopped. \"Is everything alright?\" I ask him. He looks up from his empty plate. \"I'm trying to tell you something but, I can't get it out\" he replied. I squeeze his hand. \"You can tell me anything Nick, what is it?\" he looks at me. He got up and told me to stand up and face him. I did as told got up and looked at him about a foot away from him. Right now, this gives anyone coming up the stairs access to seeing us. He opens his mouth, then closes it, then thinks. He does that about three times. I'm looking at him smiling but worried, and anxious about what he needs to say. Finally he starts. \"Jasmine each day I see you, you open up a new world of beauty to me. Your laugh opens up my ears, your smile opens up my eyes, your voice makes me want to do nothing but smile. Each day...I fall even more deeper in love with you. Your the perfect girl. Your voice, your personality, your attitude, your confidence. You always want to help out. Your smart beyond your brain, your so funny yo can keep I whole room laughing for an hour, this world is so ugly sometimes but it turns beautiful because you are, At nights I looked up and matched each star with a reason why I love you; I was doing great, until I ran out of stars. You mean everything to me Jasmine. I'm in love with you\" he said looking deep in my eyes. I was speechless. Never, has a guy ever, said anything like that to me. My mouth was open slightly, but no words came out. After 5 minutes I was frozen. Then I found some way to smile, still no words though. \"Come on Jas, say something you're scaring me\" he said still looking into my eyes. I close my mouth still smiling, I step closer to Nick, and grabbed the back of his neck. With my hand I pushed his head to mine while I leaned in along with him, and our lips met. His hands slid up my waist, gently flexing his hands on my shoulders, then up my neck, meeting my cheeks. It seemed like both our tounges peeped out at the same time. Then his hands went back down to my waist. He pulled me even more closer to him. We did this for 10 minutes then pulled away for air. We were still the same position. I looked up at Nick who was smiling at me. I looked down laughing and blushing at the same time. He lifted my chin, making me look at him. \"Nick I love you too\" I said. Then he leaned back kissing me. It sooned turned into I make-out session. He lifted me up and sat me down on the table. He pulled away after he sat me down and kissed my neck. Since my dress was strapless, my chest was fully exposed. He kissed and sucked all over my chest. Then he went back to my neck. Oh my god it felt so good. If Demi knew I was doing this she'd kill me over and over and over again. Joe would do the same to Nick. Then his eyes locked mine and he went back to my lips. He pulled my bottom lip, then looked into my eyes again. He kissed his way across my cheek and got to my ear. He sucked and bit on the top part of it. After it was wet he blew on it. It felt hot. It felt nice. I had my eyes closed and I even let out a breath. He stopped and looked at me once more. He smiled. He kissed me on the lips. After about 30 minutes of making out the table started vibrating. It was my phone in my purse. We at first ignored the first vibration, then the second vibration happened. We both pulled away and looked at my purse. I quickly grabbed it and answered the phone. \"Hello?\" I said breathing heavily. \"Hey, where are you guys, we're leaving\" said Demi. I motioned for Nick to get ready. \"Ok we'll be right down\" and I hung up. I looked up at Nick and giggled. \"We've gotta go\" I said laughing. \"Ok\" he said. Then he walked over to me and kissed me pasionately. I pulled away and smiled. He smiled back and we left. When we found the car we belonged in and got in. The driver started driving. I wasn't aware of this but my ears are red as cherries, and my neck has red marks all over it. Nick told me. Omg thats why Demi is staring! \"Um hey Jas?\" Demi said. Oh god I prayed she would wait till we got home. \"Yea?\" I said and looked at her. \"Why is your neck all red?\" she asked me suspiciously. I looked at Demi nervous. \"I um...\" I looked at Nick. \"I hit my neck on a pole..\" said questioningly. She narrowed her eyes. \"Really now?\" she said. \"Yup\" I said. \"Ok and your ears? I haven't seen them that read since you got your ears pierced when you were five\" she said zooming in on my ears. \"People were um..yelling into my ears\" I choked. Nick looked at me. I was fighting back a smile. I could tell what he was screaming at me in his mind. 'REALLY! THAT'S WHAT YOU CAME UP WITH!'. Then Demi and Joe at the same time narrowed their eyes. \"Me, you, talk, when we get home\" Demi said. I just nodded acting cool as ice. But inside I was laughing like a maniac. When we got home Me and Nick get out quickly. We quietly, fastly mumble to each other 'Shecantellyourlying!' 'Whatdoyouwantmetodo?' 'Becool!' 'How!' And the rest were murmurs. We got to the door and quickly turned around and smiled at Demi. We got into the house and the boys went straight into the kitchen, while Demi dragged me upstairs to my room. She threm me on the bed, shut he door and locked it. She crossed her arms and stood infront of me. \"So tell me what reeally happend Jasmine. And I want the truth\" she said. I was so nervous. \"What I told you is the truth!\" I said fake smiling. She lifted an eyebrow. \"Ok! Well see Me and Nick were dancing and we got tired of the crowd so we got some food and went to the roof floor of the building. We ate and Nick was all squirming so I said 'Whats wrong?' and he took a long time to say it but he called me all these nice things and told me he was in love with me. I thought it was so sweet and I kissed him because I loved him back. And after that we made out, kissed, sucked, bit, ect. But no clothes were taken off\" I finish. need I remind I said all that extremly fast. Demi sighed suprised at me and Nick. She was processing everything in her brain. \"So you guys hooked up, at a Grammys AfterParty? Yall are dating right?\" Is the only thing she can ask. \"Yea, I guess\" I said. She inhaled and exhaled. \"Ok lets go our boyfriends are waiting\" she said, got up, and left the room. She didn't take it well, but she was dealing with it. Thank god.[Chapter 3] You Broke My Heart Still Jasmine's POV: \"Ok lets go our boyfriends are waiting\" she said, got up, and left the room. She didn't take it well, but she was dealing with it. Thank god. We went back downstairs to Joe and Nick. \"Congrats to both of you, first off\" Joe said. I looked at Nick. I can tell by the way he looked at me and shruged he was fighting back a smile. \"Um thanks\" I said and looked at Joe. Demi took Joe to the livingroom and they talked quietly. Nick motioned for me to come over, so I did. He pulled me in with his arms around my waist. He managed to squeeze me into his legs. ~Omg that didn't sound right~ \"So I have two questions\" Nick stated. \"Ask away\" I said. \"Will you be my girlfriend?\" he asked giving me a warm smile. \"Of course I will Nick\" I said looking at him happily. \"Second question, When we were making out didn't you feel that..that heat?\" he asked. His question stunned me but I didn't show it. \"Definitly. It felt amazing\" I said. He smiled and pulled me in for a kiss. I kissed back. We quickly started tounge kissing. And coincidentally they walked back in 10 seconds later, finding us kissing. We didn't notice till Joe got impatient and cleared his throat. We quickly pulled away, and I scrambled beside Nick looking at both of them. We were both failing not to laugh. They looked at us. I could tell they were being serious. \"So we need to obviousy, go over somethings\" Demi said. \"Because now, whenever someone's back is turned, your tounges are down each others throats\" Joe said. Demi shot him a look telling him to be easy. \"So at anytime at all did you guys think about going farther then-\" but me and Nick quickly said \"No!\" then there was a dead silence. Nick looked at me to say something. I quickly came up with something reasonable. \"Look Nick has the ring, and so do I! I would never do that, I swore. And so did Nick. Look we just got caught up in the moment ok. And even If we wanted to we couldn't because we have to wait. I'm telling the truth. And you both know it\" I finished. Nick looked up at me like 'Nice!' and I smiled waiting for them to respond. \"Ok\" Demi said. \"Yea you're right Jas\" Joe added. \"I know. Can we go up to my room now?\" I asked. \"No\" Demi said. \"You can stay down here though. We're gonna make sure you guys don't get 'Caught up in the moment' again\" Joe said mocking me. Nick rolled his eyes, Demi smirked. I got an idea. \"Ok guys. I just asked because I was saving you guys the annoince of our lovey-doveiness\" I say and grab Nicks hand. I take him into the living room. I looked at Nick and puckered my lips. He pecked them and turned the tv on. We all watched the movie \"Date Night\". I fall asleep with my head in Nicks lap and Demi falls asleep laying on Joe's shoulder. They fell asleep too. Man I can't wait to see whats up for me and Nick in the future. The next week had been the funniest, but embarcing week ever. Me and Nick were going for an interview on Ellen. She brought up us being together. There was no denying, we agreed. Then she brought up the picture of us on the cover of a magezine. The crowd watching 'aww'ed. Me and Nick saw the picture of Me and Nick kissing, thank god its when we first started and didn't get so into it. We told the story about where we were and how it happened. That picture was clear of all labels. But the picture with labels had a small bubble of me and Justin, me kissing him on the cheek. On the side it said \"Is Jasmine cheating already?\". When I saw that picture, it reminded me that I wasn't over him. But I can't show it. One of the other questions she asked is how that kiss happened. I responded \"Well Justin had wrote a script for us to do since my performance was last minute and I didn't get to discuss it with him, so yea, he wrote like this script, and I liked he liked it. So I did it!\". \"Ah-ha. Did you like the kiss?\" she said to me. I smiled and purposely gave ellen a look, then I quickly glanced at Nick who was waiting for me to answer. \"I mean I kissed Nick on the cheek all the time when we were friends-\" \"And when you kissed Justin it was just a friendly kiss? Wait,wait,wait,wait,wait so you and Nick weren't together till the after party?\" she said. \"Yea. That's how it went. But your other question, I mean I was avioding Justin where ever I went for like a month. So like after we like talked about it at the grammy awards, we both just let it go, and now were friends\" I finished. \"Wow, this is the type girl you'd want to meet and be with! You know?\" and the audience clapped and cheered. I smiled. \"You know, the bright smile, the beautiful face. Oh I meant to ask you, how do you keep your face so smooth?\" she said to me, making me and Nick laugh, AND the audience laugh. \"What? I'm serious! It looks so soft and silky- I bet Nick felt it, he might know, Nick is her face soft?\" she said and looked at Nick. Nick was luaghing but he responded \"Yea it's soft\" he said still laughing. \"Are her lips soft?\" Ellen asked. Nick had put his head down laughing. I laughed too, and SO DID the audience. After Nick stopped laughing he said \"Very\" and smiled and looked at me, like he wanted to kiss me, so I leaned in and we kissed for like 3 seconds. Leaving the audience clapping and 'Aww'ing again. \"Aren't they just the cutest thing\" Ellen asked the audience. They clapped, and cheered AGAIN. \"So speaking of kisses-guys show that next picture!\" she yelled to the people controling the screen thing. I couldn't believe it. IT WAS THE PICTURE OF ME AND NICK WALKING OUT THE AFTER PARTY WITH ALL THOSE HICKEYS ON MY NECK! Me and Nick blushed deeply and giggled, the audience screaming and clapping loud, while Ellen was just staring at us smirking. She started to laugh under her smirk. \"Care to explain?\" she said after the audience calmed down. I shook my head. He looked at me. \"I smell blushing\" she said looking at us. Thankfully she moved on. We finished the interview and I sang at the end. =3 MONTHS LATER= It's been three months and Nick and Jasmine are still together and their love for each other is stronger than ever. They've been interviewed by people and answer the questions they ask about the relationship, and they give full detail. Nick and Jasmine are working together on songs, Nick made a song for her on his new album for his show, and Jasmine is making a song about him. This day, Nick gets to finally hear it after 3 weeks. Jasmine's been hanging out with Justin and Nick's ok with it. Even though sometimes he gets suspicous that he tryingto steal her back, still being with Selena. Jasmine and Demi moved out of the old house to a huge condo with a pool and a game room and all of the other high priced stuff. They've been there for to weeks. Today Nicks over at Jasmine's, he stayed the night...with her..in her bed. Everybody was ok with that now. Nick's POV: I wake up to find Jasmine asleep. I smile because Jasmine sleeps like an angel in her sleep, so beautiful. She was laying to the left facing me, the she turned onto her back. \"Jas?\" I said. I got an idea. She'd never answer she's a really, REALLY deep sleeper. But she wakes up when I wake her up in a hot way, this I discovered last week when she wasn't budging to wake up so I kissed her hand and just kept on going up, up her arm to her shoulder then I skipped her neck to her cheek, and then I kissed her lips. She's already been awake before I reached her lips. So this morning I decided to wake her up like that again. She really only sleeps in underwear and panties. Which is so hot. She looks like a victoria secrets model. I pulled the covers off her, knowing it wouldn't wake her up, and I pulled up her shirt and went down to her stomach. I gently kissed all over her flat stomach for about a minute then her eyes flickered open. I looked up at her and smiled. \"Morning beautiful\" I said still smiling. \"Hey\" she smiled. Then she looked at her stomach. \"More\" she said just below a whisper. I looked at her smiled once more then I began to kiss her stomach again. Soon I started to suck it. She started to shift positions. I has doing that for ten minutes, then I began easing my way up to her neck. Being her boyfriend for 3 months I know all her sweet spots. One is under her chin to the left, and one is in the middle of her neck to the right. I sucked on excatly on those spots and she moaned softly. \"Nick\" she said quietly, knowing she can't be loud because Demi will get nosy. I started to suck harder. She started whimpering. I smiled and looked up at her, She looked up at me intimate and sexy. I kissed her. She kissed me back hungrily. We made out on her bed for about an hour. Then I pulled away staring at her. God she's gorgeous. \"How do I get so lucky?\" she said looking at me smiling. I went back down and pulled on her bottom lip with my teeth and my lip. \"You don't know lucky like I do Jas. I'm more than lucky, I'm blessed. Blessed to have someone like you as a girlfriend\" I smiled again. She went back up to kiss me again. \"I love you\" she whispered. I leaned down to kiss her again. \"I love you too\" I whispered back. Her smile got wider. She pushed me off her and started hitting me with a pillow. I soon grabbed a pillow and started hitting her. 30 minutes later we stopped fighting after I grabbed her by the waist and started sucking on the back of her neck. I knew she'd stop. Kissing is her weakness. That's gonna be extremely bad in the future but it's good for now. She did a 360 turn on me. \"That's so not fair!\" she yelled hitting me with a pillow. I coved myself close to the bed, She pushed me on the bed and strattled her legs ontop of me. Demi always comes in at the VERY wrong time. She walked in seeing us exactly like that. Jasmine scrambled off me and sat at the edge of the bed. \"I heard yelling and I came to check..but now I know why...\" Demi said looking at us. \"Demi we were just playing around\" She said. \"Yea not an hour ago\" Demi stated. \"Be cautious of your kissing noises\" Demi said walking out. I looked at Jasmine who seconds later turned to me. She laughed. And so did I. Me and Jasmine later on got dressed. We were in the living room watching \"Superman\". I had my arm her, while she was leaning on my shoulder taping at her phone. I wondered who she as texting. \"Hey umm I've gotta go to dance reharrsal for a concert Justins having in...Montreal. I'm the opening act. Justin said he's gonna pick me up, is that ok?\" she asked me. God did I wanna say no so bad. \"Yea it's cool\" I lied. She looked up at me and narrowed her eyes. \"Nicky please tell me the truth\" she said giving me that begging face. I didn't break me. \"I promise I am\" I said, leaned down and kissed her. \"Ok..\" she said Doubtfully. By the time Justin got there the movie ended. I was sleep. Jasmine shook me awake. She was in a different outfit, a tight t-shirt with a silver jacket over top, and some loose sporty booty shorts. \"Nick I'm leaving with Justin\" she pointed to Justin. \"Hey dude\" Justin said. \"Whats up\" I replied. \"Ok Jas, call you later\" I said still alittle tired. \"You better\" she demanded leaning down to kiss me. We kissed for about 10 seconds. I notice Justin was uncomfortable with this. It's so obvious he still likes her. I watched them walk out. Demi came out and sat beside me. \"Why don't you just tell her you don't like it when they hang together?\" she said looking at me. \"Because then I'd be being a jerk. It's her ex-boyfriend, they don't like each other anymore\" lied to her. \"Really? You don't think Justin still likes Jasmine?\" Demi said joking, but doubtful. I sighed. \"No, Demi\" I lied again. \"C'mon\" she got up and grabbed her keys plus her glasses from the coffee table. \"We're going to the dance studio\" and with that she pulled me up and dragged me out to her car. She opened up the door for me and I got in. She went around and got in the car. \"Why are you doing this?\" I said. \"Because you need to fight for her Nick. Jasmine's an easy girl. They used to date. Justin got the looks, the attitude, and the mind to get her back. And I KNOW you know that. You need to hurry because times running ou- I mean..forget it\" she said as she started to drive. I was about to say something but I left alone. I looked out the window, she was absolutly right. \"You know where your going?\" I said still looking at the window. I felt Demi look at me and smile. \"Of course\" she replied speeding the car up. \"So who's the dance director?\" I asked 5 minutes later. \"This lady named Montee, and Usher\" she replied. \"Usher?\" I said alittle shocked. \"Yea. He isn't busy doing stuff right now so he volunteered to help them for the 4 months\" she said, but when she stopped she looked frightened and alert. I didn't know what she meant by 4 months. \"What do you mean 4 months?\" I said looking at her. She slowly turned her head to look at me. I could tell she was trying to think up a lie. \"Because..um..the c-concert is in f-four months\" she said looking back at the road to see if the light was green. \"You're lying Demi I can tell. You stutter when you lie\" I said. She changed the subject \"Hey look! Justin's car! We must be here!\" she said quickly turning off the car and running out. I sped walked towards her direction. \"Come on Dem I don't know where I'm going!\" I said starting to run. When got inside I just left it alone. We went into a room oppisite of where Jasmine and the other dancers were. It had to be at least 20 of them including Jasmine and Justin There was a mirror in their room. We can see them but they can't see us, they're looking at a mirror. When we found to chairs to sit on and watch them, Usher just got finished talking. \"I don't wanna go in there because Justin might cut off his flirt with you in there\" Demi said quietly. They started. \"So everybody we're gonna start off with warm ups. I'ma test yall to see if you remember. Everybody 'hey daddy' \" said Usher finishing. Everybody got up from the floor from doing their stretches. I noticed Justin and Jasmine next to each other. \"Montee over here, don't help them\" Usher said to the female director. \"Sorry guys\" Montee said. \"He said no help!\" she said walking over by Usher at the side of the room. \"Hit it Malcom. Jasmine, Justin, to to the front!\" Usher said to the music person, after everyone got in position, and Jasmine and Justin went to the front. There was a V-shape of at least ten chairs across the room. The music started. There was a guy in each chair, with a girl hidding behind them. The guy was forwards but the chair was backwards. I was only focused on Jasmine and Justin. Jasmine's hands had slipped onto Justins shoulders, then chest while rising up. She leaned forward on Justins shoulder. They both flirtatiously smiled at each other. Jasmine walked around to the front of the chair and moved her hips in a large circle. then she turned around and Justins hands slipped around her waist. The song went on with then all over each other. It seemed to be that they remembered everything and Montee pointed them out to everybody to watch them. It was one move where they were close enough to kiss. They did about five more songs and were partners for everything. They took a break. I could here their conversation. Their stuff happend to be right next to the mirror. Jasmine leaned on the desk, and he stood infront of her \"So did you tell Nick yet?\" he said drank his bottled water. \"No, I'm waiting for the right time\" she said moving her hair from her face. What are they talking about! \"Well we're leaving in two weeks you're running out of time\" he said poking Jasmine's stomach. She smiled. \"I know. It's just, Nick's really picky with you. He thinks I can't tell whe he's bothered when I go places with you. But I can tell. I've just gotta wait until he's fonder of you. That's why I set that thing up for next week. We've gotta tell him together\" Jasmine said resting her hand on his shoulder. \"I can't believe we're going on tour together for 4 months!\" Jasmine said looking at herself in the mirror putting her hair in a ponytail. Everything just stopped. 4 MONTHS! On she's in for it when she gets home.[Chapter 4] You Broke My heart They worked on some of Jasmine's Songs, Then worked on some of Justin's songs. But they did alittle of each song. Jasmine had to call the studio and tell them she has to cancel for today. Nick was steamed, though he kept quite. Demi felt guilty for bringing him here, still they stayed till the end. Nick got up early to 'suprise' Jasmine when she got out. Jasmine's POV: \"Ok guys that's a wrap! See you all tomorrow!\" said Montee. \"Good job today Justin and Jasmine. Be prepared tomorrow because we're covering ALOT\" Usher said. \"See ya B-man\" Usher said, and him and Justin did their special hand shake. \"Bye Jas\" Usher said hugging me. \"Decuses Ursher\" I said clowning. He smiled. Me and Justin were he last one's out. \"So you talked to Selena yet?\" I said to him grabbing my bag, and water, while he did the same. \"Yea, we're meeting up Saturday. Thats the next time she's in town\" He said and started walking beside me. \"Oh. She doing alright?\" I asked him even though I really didn't care. I still love Justin. She still is with him. It won't change that she basically stole him from me,..Damn Jasmine! You're with Nick! He's your boyfriend not Justin. \"She said she's doing great. Man doesn't that suck? That as soon as she gets back, I leave? I mean we just found out like 3 weeks ago\" he said looking down. \"Well it'll be ok. You know how hard it'll be for me to be away from Nick? We've been together non-stop for 3 whole months. I don't even think he'll go with the idea of me leaving wi...\" I stopped after Justin pushed the door open for me. But I didn't finish because I saw Nick standing right there. I tried to play it cool. \"Um, hey babe! Whater you doin' here?\" I said stepping alittle closer to him. \"Nothing. Just, FINDING OUT THAT MY GIRLFRIENDS GOING ON TOUR WITH HER EX-BOYFRIEND WHO STILL LOVES HER!\" he yelled. I looked at Justin. He was looking the other way, and scratching his head. Jasmine: Nick we're just friends- Nick: That like each other! Jasmine: What? Nick: Don't act dumb! Justin: Ok Nick calm down Nick: *glared at Justin* DUDE IT'S OBVIOUS YOU STILL LOVE HER. IT'LL NEVER CHANGE. LETS GET ONE THING STRAIGHT MAN, SHE'S MINE NOW! YOU CAN'T STEAL HER BACK. SHE DOESN'T DESERVE YOU. YOU CHEATED ON HER!- *getting really red* Jasmine: Nick stop! Nick: You expect me to be ok with this!- Jasmine: Ok so he's still inlove with me, so what? Nick: Soo, he'll try to get you back- Jasmine I don't want you around him anymore, don't even hang with him. Jasmine: You know right now, you're missing a HUGE part of importance in a realtionship Nick: What's that? Jasmine: Trust. *it got dead silent* Call me after me and Justin stop making out *sarcastic* Jasmine's POV: I grabbed Justin's arm and pulled him to his car. I was pissed. This time I wasn't crying. I just held my head high and left it alone. Justin looked at me for a long time when we got in the car. I was looking at the highway, cars passing by quickly. It was calming the boiling water in my chest. I finally looked over at him. \"So I'm starving can we got get something to eat?\" I said. I could tell how confused he was at how casual I was acting. \"Why are you so calm?\" he asked. \"Because I'm leaving it alone. Justin, the last thing I need right now is drama\" I said looking at him pleading for him to drop it. He nodded and started the car. \"Where we off to?\" he pulled off. \"My house\" I said. \"We aren't going anywhere looking and smelling like this\" I said. Justin laughed. \"No denying\" and we both laughed. It was pretty late when me and Justin had left to eat. So we went to \"Late Night at Micheal's\". Yea sure it was fancy but it was closer to the house. I put on a black strapless dress, ripped on the sides, with a bow on the front. It might sound fancy but it was pretty casual. I had on 1 inch heels on, and my hair was in a long and straight, down my back with bangs in the front. Justin changed into a plain grey button up shirt and some black jeans, with a grey hat, and grey and black high top Nikes. And I had to admit, I had so much fun! When the waiter wasn't looking Justin shot spit balls at him. We even played that game we used to play when we threw stuff in each other mouths and the other had to catch it. I had worn Justin's hat the whole time! I was almost like a date. NO, no, you and Nick didn't break up, don't say that! When Justin took me home we hugged goodbye and he drove away, leaving me speechless. \"That was great.\" I moved my hair from my face and walked in the house. Nick was there. Just sitting there playing with his fingers. He heard the door and turned. Here we go! Justin: *dialing Selena's number while at a stop light* *to himself* Step 1: Remind her what she had. Step 2: Get rid of any other relationships you have going on. Selena I love you, but I loved Jasmine first and more. We're dying. It's just not gonna work *She answers* Selena: Hey babe. Where ya been? Justin: Hey just checking on you. We still on for Saturday right? Selena: Of course. Why is it something important? Justin: No I have to tell you something and I just prefer not to do it over phone. Jasmine`s POV: \"Hey\" I said and shut the door putting my bag left overs. I turned back around. \"Were you with him?\" he said firmly. I thought about it. If he's got a problem with Justin he's gotta deal with it. \"Yes, why?\" I said inconently. \"JASMINE THIS IS NOT FUNNY!\" he got up reaching his arm out. \"WHAT'S NOT FUNNY? THE FACT THAT MY OWN BOYFRIEND DOESN'T TRUST ME WITH MY EX! OR THE FACT THAT HE'S BEING A JERK AND NOT LETTING ME HANG AROUND WITH HIM!\" I said while walking up to him. Nick: Jasmine you're not understanding why I'm not ok with it- Jasmine: Ok then make me understand Nick: He's gonna try and steal you back, and I won't have anyway of controling it. Jasmine you don't understand. He's doing that 'Get my Ex back' thing. First he puts you on his side second he hangs out with you, takes you out to pl- Jasmine: I just asked him if we could go get something to eat! He didn't ask me! I wanted to eat so we went to get food! Nick: FOR ALL YOU GUYS KNOW SOMEONE COULD'VE BEEN TAKING PICTURES AND IS GONNA MAKE THIS WHOLE THING EVEN WORSE Jasmine: WHAT THING NICK! YOUR LOST YOUR TRUST IN ME, AND NOW YOUR BLAMING ME ON SOMETHING THAT'S NOT TRUE. IT'S NOT A THING NICK. YOU'RE JUST BEING A BIG JACKASS! Demi: *listening, thinking: Man Demi why'd you take him there! You just started things* Nick: JASMINE I ONLY DON'T TRUST YOU BECAUSE YOUR EASY! Jasmine: YOU'RE SAYING IT LIKE I'M SOME WHORE YOU PICK UP ON THE CORNER AND PAY TO HAVE SEX WITH YOU! Nick: I didn't me- Jasmine: I can't go through this right now Nick, I've got lots of other things to do than argue with my trust worthy boyfriend. See this is why I could get back in a relationship my heart was gonna get broken AGAIN *runs up to her room* Nick: *watches her, get angry at himself and punches the wall. Sits down and buried his head in his hands* Demi: *makes sure she's gone, and walks out to Nick, doesn't sit down* Nick I'm sorry this is all my fault- Nick: *gets up and grabs his coat* Please fix this *walks out shutting the door* Demi: *goes up to Jasmine's room* Jas? Jas open the door[Chapter 5] You Broke My Heart Jasmine`s POV: \"No!\" I scream to her. I'm on my bed, with my arms on my knees, and my head burried in my arms. I'm crying. \"Jasmine please!\" Demi yells outside the door. I look up and think about it. She could've drove Nick to the dance studio. His car was still there when I got back from the studio, but hers wasn't. It makes sense. She probaly did. God! She started all this dumb shit between me and Nick! I'm so mad at her right now. \"Go away! Your the one the caused all this shit in the first place!\" I yell. \"I know Jasmine I'm sorry! Please just let me explain to you...inside of your room\" she yells again. \"There's nothing TO explain Demi! You fucked my relationship, by being nosy! That's what this is all about. You don't have to explain. I'm smart enough to figure that out I'm not a dumbass\" I say now I've started crying. \"You knew that I didn't want Nick to know! It would start shit like this! Go see Joe or something, go but into some else's life and LEAVE ME ALONE!\" I yell. I pick up a shoe and throw it at the door. Now I'm going to sleep, The light hurts. So I'm turning over and crying till I put myself to sleep. Demi must've walked away because after I said that it got quiet. Finally I drift off to sleep... =The next day= I wake up. I feel like crap. My eyes are puffy, my hair is all over the place, and I've still got my dress from yesterday on. If you cry before you go to sleep you wake up with bags. Mine are extremely bad! I don't care, I've got people to take care of this. My phone is vibrating. At first I thought it was Nick but then I looked at the caller ID and it said 'Mom'. So I answered. \"Hello\" I said sleepy with a cracky voice. Ms. L: Oh no did I wake you up? Jasmine: No I've just had a rough night Ms L: Oh yeah that thing with Nick? Jasmine: What? How do you know? Ms. L: Demi called. She told me you hate her and that you're never gonna talk to her again because she ruwened your relationship Jasmine: Oh well that's 80% true Ms. L: Come on Jas you're a Lovato! *mood change to bummed* Even though you changed your last name Villegas and/or V instead of Lovato Jasmine: Mom you're still stuck on that? Its my middle name!, Ms. L: What kind of star changes their star name to their middle name? Jasmine: Rihanna, Drake, Jack Black, and hey Demi didn't keep her name Demitria Ms. L: Whatever, but hey. It's lonley here. I didn't make up my mind for the both of you to move in together if you're gonna be fighting. So make up Jasmine: No promises Ms. L: *sigh* I love you Jasmine: Love you more Ms. L: Bye sweetie Jasmine: Bye mom Ms. L: *hangs up* Jasmine: *hangs up and puts the phone down* Jasmine: My stomach is starting to growl. So I'm going downstairs to get something to eat. I change first. When I get to the kitchen I see Joe's here. Joe: Hey. I see you're taking this better than Nic- Jasmine: Don't mention his name to me Joe: Come on Jas. All you do with Justin is flirt, he's not wrong for feeling this w- Jasmine: Yea but he's wrong for not trusting me! Did he tell you what he said to me? He said I'm easy. It sounds like I'm some whore you pick up at a corner and pay to have sex with you. Joe it's not easy for me to except that my boyfriend, I'm leaving in 2 weeks, lost all trust in me because Justin still loves me. Joe: Ok would you be ok with Nick hanging out with Selena and going on tour with her? Jasmine: Of course. It's his career, he sings Joe: Ok what if Selena still loved him Jasmine: *unsurly nods* Joe: And he loves her back, and he's taking her out to dinner, and taking her side about the fight and- Jasmine: Ok!ok! No! But that's different because I don't love him back. Joe: *sigh* I know I'm Nicks brother and you think everything you say to me now, I'll tell Nick. I swear to you I won't say a word. But tell the truth. Don't you still love Justin? Jasmine: *takes her a long time to answer, looks away, tear forming* I don't want to Joe: *looks at her* Now everything about Selena and him, I'm saying to you is what he feels and thinks. That's the position you put him in Jasmine: *quiet* Joe: Now I understand you're under an extreme load of pressure, but that doesn't mean you go and do this to Nick. He got home yesterday, didn't say a word. He just went straight to his room and locked the door. I haven't seen him all day Jasmine: All day? What time is it? Joe: *looks at his watch* 4:13 Jasmine: WHAT? Omg Justin's coming to pick me up for reharrhasal! *runs upstairs* Joe: *sighs* =15 minutes later= Demi: And she just ran? Joe: Like kangroo Demi: Kangroos don't run they hop Joe: They go fast don't they Demi: Yea Joe: Then she hopped like a kangroo Demi: *laughs* Jasmine: *runs downstairs, in a new set of clothes, fresh as an apple. On her phone looking at a text from Justin. She smiles at her phone then puts it in her bag* Demi have you seen my sunglasses..no wait..I'm not talking to you Demi: Come on Jas! I'm sorry! Jasmine: *ignoring her* Ah. Here they are *picks up her glasses and puts them on, heads towards the door* Demi: Jasmine! Jasmine: *walks out, shuts the door* Demi: Open up the window! Joe: *opens the window* Jasmine: Justin I'm outside *on speaker phone with Justin* Justin: Ok I'm like 3 minutes away Jasmine: Mkay, hey where are we going after reharrsal that was so Important and secretive Justin: Can't say Jasmine: Come on tell me Justin: Nope, oh and did you bring extra clothes? Jasmine: Yea. Justin it better not be somewhere social because I've made Nick really mad. And didn't mean to. It's Demi's fault because if she would have never been so nosy and brung him to the studio then this wouldn't have happend Justin: Oh come on don't blame it all on your sister Demi: *quietly* Thank you Jasmine: Ok maybe it was me too Justin: And me. I flirt with you too much Jasmine: Oh I forgot to ask you somethin- Justin: I'm here *pulls up infront of her* Jasmine: *smiles and gets in* Hey *shuts the door* Justin: *pulls off* Demi: Damn it! He's taking her somewhere again! Joe: *sighs* Demi: Lets follow them Joe: Don't you want your sister to talk to you? Demi: Yea but I don't want her relationship to turn right Joe: Demi I don't either but if you ju- Demi: Come on Joe please!

Demi: Yup =at the end= Jemi: *already outside in the car waiting for Jasmine and Justin to come out* Jasmine:*just got finished changing, walks out the bathroom, Justin already changed and done* So where are we going?

Tricky handled the music and tone to high so I could hear. \"Arite roll it\" Tricky said to the people working the sound. Justin started to sing Everybody's laughing in my mind Rumors spreading 'bout this other guy Do you do what you did when you did with me Does he love you the way I can Did you forget all the plans that you made with me 'cause baby I didn't That should be me Holdin' your hand That should be me Makin' you laugh That should be me This is so sad That should be me That should be me That should be me Feelin' your kiss That should be me Buyin' you gifts This is so wrong, I can't go on, till you believe that That should be me That should be me You said you needed a little time for my mistakes It's funny how you use that time to have me replaced But did you think that I wouldn't see you out at the movies Whatcha doin' to me you're taken' him where we used to go Now if you're tryin' to break my heart it's working 'cause you know that That should be me Holdin' your hand That should be me Makin' you laugh That should be me This is so sad That should be me That should be me That should be me Feelin' your kiss That should be me buyin' you gifts This is so wrong, I can't go on, till you believe that That should be me I need to know should I fight for love or disarm It's getting harder to shield this pain in my heart That should be me Holdin' your hand That should be me Makin' you laugh That should be me This is so sad That should be me That should be me That should be me Feelin' your kiss That should be me Buyin' you gifts This is so wrong, I can't go on, Till you believe that That should be me That should be me That should be me That should be me That should be me And he stopped. I love this song. That was so sweet of him. So he does still love me. I knew it. \"What'd you think Jas\" Justin said. I got up and opened the door to the room. I hugged him. \"That was so sweet I loved it\" I said. He hugged me tightly. I really didn't wanna let go. He pulled away and smiled. \"I'm glad\" he said. I left the room to let him work on the song more. After about 40 minutes Tricky said \"Arite man that's wrap for today, go home man\" he said and let go of the mic button. And we all said good bye to each other and me and Justin left. \"So I learned how to cook this food. I have no idea what it is but it tastes really good. Wanna come with me to my house and help me cook?\" Justin asked me and the way down. \"Sure\" I said and smiled at him warmly. Justin lived in a normal house with his mom. When we got there his mom was out. Justin took the ingerdients out and we started to cook. Again. I was extremely fun I had a good time. I was amazed at how good it tasted I really didn't expect that. \"This IS good! Oh my gosh! Where'd you learn this!\" I said after I finished chewing. \"My aunt taught me\" he said putting a spoon-full in his mouth. \"How did your aunt teach you how to make it, but she didn't tell you what it's called?\" I said fishing around the food trying to get a good pick up on it. He shrugged and smiled still chewing. Which made me laugh. We finished eatting and having our conversation. Then we had to clean up. Justin wipped some flour on my cheek. I wipped some around his face. He threw at my hair. I covered my hands with flour and printed my hand print on his shirt. We went back and forth fighting with the flour. I flicked it at his face. He just stared at me shocked and I backed away laughing. Then he ran towards me and chased me around around the counter about 3 times then he caught me at the sink, wrapping his arms around my waist. I screamed and laughed. He turned me around and pushed me up against the sink smiling and biteing his bottom lip. He took out his phone and went to camera mode. \"Smile\" he said aiming it away to the both of us for a shot. 'click' it said. He lowered it back down and and looked at it. I was smirking with my head cocked to the side, showing my flour covered hair. He was leaning his head on mine while grin not too wide but not too small. You could see my white hand print on his shirt. I tapped his phone for about a minute. Then he put it away and said \"It is now on Facebook and Twitter\" he smiled. I leaned back against the sink, and he got infront of me. \"Jas I guess I never really got the chance to tell you but, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hurt you. I loved you. I still do love you, a lot. When I cheated on you, Jasmine I wasn't thinking. I guess I was just turning into an ass because I was getting so full of it. You know being famous and all. And I know you're with Nick and you don't want me anymore, I just wanted to let you know that, because I couldn't hold it anymore\" he said. At that moment I had forgotten all about Nick. He was pulling me into his trap. And I was so weak right then, I couldn't stop it. I was so close, he was so close, we were so close. \"Man I sounded like I'm saying I have to pee\" he smiled at me, I looked at him and burst out laughing. He soon did too. I could feel his breath on my lips. It was turning me on. We both stopped laughing and stared at each other. I quickly glanced at his lips then back at his eyes. His arms were still wrapped around my waist. We both leaned in. Then we kissed. It was magical like it was the most amazing kiss I'd ever had. Like I was dreaming and we were both in the same dream. He pulled me in tighter and my hands creeped up his chest. I was floating away. We both were. 5 minutes later something brought me back to earth. I had a boyfriend...he had a girlfriend. I'd been thinking about this the whole time. The thing that snapped us is that Demi and Joe burst through the door looking at us. We both pulled away and looked at them. \"Shit\" I said to myself, looking down.[Chapter 6] You Broke My Heart Joe: You sun of a bitch Demi: Joe Jasmine: Joe! Joe: JASMINE HE'S LURING YOU IN! HE MAKING YOU LOVE HIM- Jasmine: I never stopped! *tears forming* Justin: Really? Jasmine: *looks at him* Yea *looks back at Demi and Joe* And the more and more I think about it the more I realize I'm using Nick. To replace Justin. He's my first love. And I can't let go if him, no matter what I do. Everyday with Nick's just been I lie! *starts to cry* When I tell Nick I love him, I'm really telling Justin I love him. When I kiss Nick. I'm thinking of Justin. And I feel horrible because he loves me and I don't love him back. I was just using him for a replacement. God I am such a bitch! Demi: *goes over to comfort her* Joe: *looks away and sighs* Jasmine: *cry into Demi chest* I'm sorry Demi: It's ok Jas. You didn't know till I thought it through. Think about it, this whole situation would be waaay worse if you KNEW you were using Nick. Justin's your first love. And you'll never forget him, I know it. But do you realize what he did to you? He cheated on you Jasmine. I KNOW you aren't stupid enough to go out with a cheater- Justin: I said I'm Sorry! Demi: There's nothing else you can say for cheating on my little sister? All you're gonna say is sorry? Jasmine could be scarred for life by this and all you've got to say is sorry? Justin: Fine. *squeezes his eyes shut then opens them back up. Looks at Jasmine* Jasmine you're the best thing that ever happend to me. And I'll understand if you don't take me back. There's no excuse for my actions, and cheating on you was beyond stupid. I was being brainless, to let someone like you go. I guess I didn't look deep enough to see what I really had. A beautiful, smart, funny,talented,goofy,lovable,independent,entertaining,and fun girl. You've got it all. And I had it. But from my stupidity I gave it all away. And I want it back. I want you back. Please Jasmine, I say this out of all honesty, and senserity, I'm sorry *a tear falls* Jasmine: *wipes her eyes, says this from her high crying voice* I forgive you *runs over to him and hugs him* Joe: Give me a break! Demi: *looks at him* From the looks of this, I don't think she's staying with Nick. You don't believe him? Joe: No! Justin: *pulls away from Jasmine still in tears* What can I do to prove to you that I'm not lying? Joe: Break up with Selena right now over phone Justin: I'm breaking up with her tomorrow Joe: Well then I guess you can't prove it at all! Justin: I'm not you Joe I don't break up with people over phone Joe: You know what you little girlfriend stealing, wanna be- *walking towards him* Demi: Joesph! *grabs his arm* Joe: *calms down* Jasmine, I'm not against you realizing you were using my brother and that you don't love him anymore, but I AM against you taking this jackass back! Use your brain Jasmine, be respondsible and smart. You're not a little girl anymore *walks out* Demi: *looks at them* I'm sorry, he can be over protective about Nick. *looks back out the door and sighs* I guess I've gotta go. It's you're choice Jas, use it wisely *walks out shutting the door behind her* Jasmine: *looks down crying (still in Justin's arms)* Justin: Jasmine,Jasmine,Jasmine. It's alright baby Jasmine: *tears away from Justin while saying* NO! Everybodies saying I'm making a mistake. I'm inlove with a mistake I.. Justin: No! Jasmine you know when I first met you, my family told me you're too perfect for me. And I believed them. That you were perfect, and that you were perfect for me, and that you were too good for me. I ignored my family because I loved you alot. If you love me enough you'll do the same Jasmine: ...I do love you, a lot, a whole lot but, it's my sister I can't..- I can't just ignore her Justin: *gets close to her and wraps his hands around her waist* Jas.. Jasmine: *cries into his chest* Justin: *hugs her tighter* -10 minutes before- Nick: *gets a text from Joe, reads it, gets up and drives to Justin's house* Jasmine: *crying* I just don't want to hurt him Nick: *Listening* Justin: You won't if you tell him the truth and not a lie *lifts her head with his hands, looks in her eyes* Look I love you Jas *wipes her tears* It'll be fine, don't cry Jasmine: *looks in his eyes, smiles* Ok *sniffles* I love you too Justin: *kisses her* Jasmine: *kisses back* Nick: *kicks the door open* I knew it!

Justin: Friends. *hugs her* Selena: *leaving out* See ya round Justin: *smiles* Wow that was easy Jasmine`s POV: I walk up to the JONAS house. I was determined to talk this out to Nick. My hands were sweaty. I wiped them on my jeans and stood there looking at the door. I was about to knock when the door quickly cracked open. Kevin: Who's with you and why are you here? Jasmine: I'm by myself and I need to talk to Nick. Why are you acting like a police officer/detective? Kevin: Practicing for a role Jasmine: Oh.

Then I'll sit here and wait *sits down on the floor infront of the door* Nick: *hears her, sighs, then gets up and opens the door* Jasmine`s POV: I looked at him and got up. I walked in the room and he shut the door. After a half hour of trying to get him to understand, he understood. We're friends. Everything is back to normal. Except one thing... Later on that day I was still at the JONAS house and I found out something amazingly exciting. JOE'S PROPOSING TO DEMI IN 2 WEEKS! Demi and the camp rock crew are having a performance in New York the same day me and Justin have one there in the afternoon. Before the show ends he's going to propose to her infront of the crowd live. Their gonna be on 'Good Morning America'. Demi is 19 and Joe's 20. She'll be 20 when the wedding comes and he'll be 21.

The only Jonas left to get married is Nick...Oup, I feel bad again![Chapter 7] You Broke My Heart This story has alittle bit of graphic stuff in it so yea. Just a heads up. Jasmine`s POV: Me and Justin met up Sunday. We took a walk in the park, then we went to this carnival. Sure there were a couple interuptions from our fans, and the paparazzi but the date was absolutly perfect. Just like our old ones but better. I told him I'm putting him on parole because of his little mishap, so he has to be the one in a million boyfriend. Yesterday he had to come pick me up for dance reharrsal. Then after that we had to go and get styled for all of our concert outfits, then go to the studio and record, and THEN intersetingly we went tour bus shopping. The bus is purple and light blue with Justin on one side, and me on the other. So today It is exactly 2 days until I leave. They made the tour longer to 6 MONTHS! I might as well make the best of it with everyone before I go. Even though I was wacked from yesterday, I spent time with Demi, Maddie, and my mom today. I'd be on tour with Justin, Scooter, Lawrence(manager), and all our back up dancers. Justin's mom would visit us every once in awhile. Demi might pass by sometimes because she's got to finish her camp rock tour. And my mom says that it's time for me to be on my own. Maddie's visiting from San Jose` and I most likely won't see her for awhile. We went out to eat then we went to see a movie. Right now, I'm laying on Demi's bed with Maddie putting her to sleep. I'm texting Justin too. Mom's staying the night here with me and Demi, and of course Maddie is too. She just turned 5 last month. So u got all ur stuff packed? ~Jas Yup.

Thanks\" she said and got up and walk towards her door. \"Night\" She said walking in. \"Night\" I say Just before she shuts the door. I look around and and shut the lights off. I walk to my room and shut the door. I put my Pj's on and jumped into bed. 1 more day. ~In Her Dream (flashback basically) Demi shifted her backpack on her shoulders, and wipped her hair from her face. She was on her way to her old school to pick up her 7 year old little sister Jasmine. By herself, even though there was a lot of kids that go to her school and are in her nieghborhood. She had been a stranger to all of her friends since her father got back 3 months ago. He had ran off somewhere but still she didn't know where. He was returning the same. Abusive. But he was even worse now. He drinks, and smokes, and even is on crack. He had came home drunk the night before drunk and had punched Demi on her face. That's why the whole day she'd been keeping her face down, either holding her cheek or putting the hood of her jacket up. Her father had hit her hard. Really hard. She's used to getting a brown or red bruise marks, but this one was a mix of purple, brown, red, and yellow. It looked disgusting. And her being not the skinniest girl in school, would make her be even more picked on then usual. She had one best friend. And that was Selena Gomez. She was much smaller and skinnier, and alittle bit more shorter than Demi. She was the only one that stuck by her through her abuse. Demi had been being abused since 2nd grade. She was now 10, in the 5th grade. But she'd known Selena since she was 3. She was like a shadow to everyone but Selena. Selena knows her true potetial and why she's always like this. Selena best friend swore to Demi she'd never tell a living soul. Though they were old enough to say best friend swore stuff is silly they'd still used it. (For those of you who don't know what a best friend swear is its when you say \"I promise I will never tell anyone, for the rest of my life about_because you are my true best friend\" and then you grabbed ring fingers and waved them around 6 times. Yea its a little kids thing my little sisters told me) Demi and Selena believed that one day they'd be famous singers and actors. They were both really talented at acting, Demi had a better stronger voice than Selena but she could still really sing. Selena was alittle better at acting then singing anyways. They both just auditioned for this new show \"Barney and friends\". If you got casted you'd be flown to Dallas to be on the show. Demi got to the school and spotted Jasmine talking to three of her friends. There was one girl she didn't reconize but she didn't ask. She just said \"Come on Jas we gotta get home!\". She yelled at the bottom of the three step stairs. Jasmine glanced up from her friends paiger and smiled. Then she said goodbye to her friends and went to join her sister. \"So how was your day?\" Demi said to her. Jasmine looked down at her feet and said \"Fine\" then she looked up at Demi \"There's a new girl in school, and her name Jessica but she likes it when people call her Jessy. Today at lunch she sat with me and gave me her tuna while she gave me her peanutbutter jelly. She's really nice. She told me she liked the scratch I had on my arm\" Jasmine said. Demi, after this, got quiet. \"I had to go to the nurse today. Mrs. Love sent me. I started to cry because my lip really started to hurt. It was bleeding again\" Jasmine finished getting sad. Demi was still quiet. Guess who she'd got that busted lip, and scratched arm from. Her dad. Demi wasn't the only one that got abused. Her little sister did too. Her mom and dad would fight and he would hit her also. That's why the night before she got punched because she was defending Jasmine. Jasmine saw 5 dollars sitting in her mom and dad's room. She moved it for some reason. She thought she was saving the money from being eattin by her stuffed dragon. Jasmine was playing her little game. he always played with her stuffed animals. She'd only moved the money to the dining room table, which wasn't far because they live in a very small apartment on the bottom floor of the apartment building. So her dad got home drunk again, though he was looking for the money. When he saw the money on the table he got really mad. Jasmine told him she moved it because she was playing her game. And he got pissed and punched her, busting her lip. When Demi heard the scream of pain coming from her sister she rushed into the small living room. \"Dad!\" Demi yelled and ran over to Jasmine. Demi saw that she was bleeding but she still held on to her, hugging her. Her father was about to hit Jasmine again before Demi came. Then he got mad at Demi and slapped her in the face extremely hard. Twice. Then he put the money in his pocket and left out. Demi was crying too. Scared to death. Jasmine's lip continued to bleed while she was still in her sister's arms. Demi quickly picked Jasmine up and carried her to the bathroom. She was still crying herself but she had to take care of her little sister. So she wipped her tears away when she sat Jasmine down on the edge of the tub. She ran some hot water on a wash cloth and gave her it to put on her lip. Jasmine stopped crying. Demi smiled and wipped Jasmine's tears from her eyes. \"It's ok Jas. Don't cry\" she said. Then she hugged Jasmine again. Jasmine hugged back and looked at Demi. \"Are you ok?\" Jasmine said sniffling. \"Yea I'm fine\" Demi said smiling at her. Jasmine had gotten that scratch in her arm a week before because she accidentallly tripped over the broken glass and it scrapped her arm. Jasmine stopped and crossed he arms about 3 minute away from the house. \"Daddy's just gonna hurt me again\" Jasmine said looking down. Demi sighed, taking a long time to respond. She couldn't promise Jasmine their dad wasn't going to hurt her but she could get her to go by something. \"Jasmine how about when we get home, I'll braid your hair in that long ponytail you want. And I'll get you cookies\" Demi squated and looked at Jasmine. Jasmine was unsure but she reached out her hand and Demi got back up and grabbed. They continued to walk. Sure enough when they got home teir mom and dad were fighting again. Jasmine couldn't help herself. She hated to see them fight. And when she saw her father start to strangle her mom, she lost it. She ran over to her dad and started banging on his leg, Demi failing to stop her. She screamed \"Stop it Daddy stop it!\". He let go of Mrs. Connor and looked at Jasmine. He got really frustrated with her and snapped. He grabbed her by her hair and dragged her towards the steps. \"Daddy no!\" Demi screamed. \"JOHN!\" Mrs. Conner worried. But it was too late. Her threw her down the 14 step staircase. The house was still small, but it had a basement. Jasmine flipped and turned and twirled down the stairs. She started to cry as she went down. He watched her and then turned back around. \"Why would you do that!\" Demi looked at him. He walked over to her and eyed her closly. \"Why'd I do this?\" then he pushed her down on the floor and kicked her in her stomach. Demi suddenly felt an extremely painful crack in her stomach. He looked his wife. She was to scared to say anything. \"I'm going to a bar\" he picked up his keys and looked around. \"Clean this place up.\" Then he walked out. \"Demitria..Demitria are you ok baby?\" she ran over to her. Demi was struggling to get up and speak but she managed. \"Jasmine, check on Jasmine\" she got up. Then Mrs. Connor got alert and ran down the stairs to Jasmine, Demi sickly following. \"Jasmine! Jasmine sweetie!\" Mrs. Connor said pulling her up. Jasmine had a big bleeding mark on her forehead, and...she was unconscious. \"Oh my god! Demitria c-call 911!\" she yelled. Demi was in so much pain she started crying half about her stomach and half about Jasmine. But she ran over to the nearest phone. Come this was her little sister. She'd be in any kind of trouble and pain to keep Jasmine safe. She called 911 and they got there within 7 minutes. They carried Jasmine out on a strecher and lifted her into an ambulance truck. Demi was next to her. She told them about her stomach. Mr. Connor has done a lot to them. But he's never knocked them unconscious or, considering what the ambulance guessed, caused broken ribs. When they got to the hospital, they were both carried to the children's emergency room. Jasmine went striaght to an operation room but Demi went to a different side of the building for exray's. Mrs. Connor waited in the waiting room for any results. She thought for the next hour, about how she'd still been with her abusive husband. That she needed him and his extra work because with out it, with out him, they'd be broke. She had hidden a big jar of cash in her room deep in her closet. It had to be at least 250 in there. So she could leave. She just didn't have the guts to. Though 6 months ago he had left to his other family in west florida. The Connors had lived in Miami. He had a different family in west florida. He started cheating on Mrs. Connor when Jasmine was only 4. He had lived a different, happier life with them. Until this lady wanted a divorce. After that he'd been angry and abusive. A year ago he had gotten back together with her but he didn't get re-married to her. The truth is they got hitched in Las Vegas when he was supposed to be on a business trip but really he'd been really been at strip club getting lap dances. And he stumbed upon Shelia. That was her name. Mrs. Connor had found that out the one night she got her work schedule mixed up and she was down stairs asleep and he brought her to the house. He didn't know that she was there though so he took Shelia to their room and started to do the do. Mrs. Connor thought she heard bouncing upstairs and went to check on it. She didn't open the door but she could tell they were having sex. And when she had found out that he was cheating on her she became angry at him. She didn't tell him or yell at him about how she new, she just left it alone. And he kept on cheating on her then soon he got Shelia pregnant with twins. She found this out by the phone call she answered when Mr. Connor was working on the lawn outside. When Jasmine was five about to turn six the call was from Shelia's mom saying Sheila was going into labour. That's why six months ago he left to help out with the kids. And 3 months ago he returned. He wa even worse than before. He got extremely violent. He was like this because he found out the twins weren't his. All this time she'd been with him, he was being unfaithful. And he was abusing not only her, but Demi and Jasmine. That's why she hoped and prayed that Demi had gotten into this show. She'd been flown out to Dallas for free and she'd be the mother of a child on a very famous kids show. And half of the money would go to her. AND she would be very very VERY far from her abusive hopefully, ex-husband. And that's when, after that long hour of thinking about how Demi might get the part, they called. \"Hello?\" she said out of her scarcity. \"Yes, hi, is this Gabrielle Connor?\" an unfimilar voice said. \"Yes this is she. W-Who's this?\" Mrs. Connor stuttered. \"This is Kathy Parker. I'm the producer on the show your daughter auditioned for. I was calling to tell you that Demitria has gotten the part as Angela in the show. She did an amazing job. And we'd really like it if she could be in the show\" \"Oh my-Oh my godness! I-I-W-we except! Yes! Yes!-I-I mean yes we'd like that very much. Thank you Kathy. Thank you very much\" \"Your very welcome. We'll call you when we get your time and date to fly you out. You have a nice evening Gabrielle\" \"You too. Goodbye\" and they hung up. Mrs. Connor gasped in excitment. She was really going to move to Dallas! And be away from her husband. She was filing a divorce the next day. Just then the doctors came out. This one was for Jasmine. \"Hi, I'm Dr. Dane. I've just gotten results from Jasmine. She had to have 4 stitches, plus she has a twisted ankle and a very very badly strained knee. She is a comma right now. This could last for a couple of days. But I promise you she''ll regain all of her memory by next week. The surgery was successful, you can go see her\" he grazed his hand to invite her to the room Jasmine was in. Mrs. Connor ran to the direction he showed her to. And soon she was in a blue room decroated with beach balls and boats. Jasmine was laying on the bed peacfully, asleep. Mrs. Connor sobbed as she sat next to Jasmine holding her hand. Demi doctor came in and told her that Demi had 2 cracked ribs and that they had went in and taped them up stopping them from any future damage. Mrs. Connor was relieved by this. They said that she'll only be there until the next day and after that she should only feel temporary pain becaus eof the medication they put her on. They brought her into the room with Jasmine and kept her there. The next morning Jasmine still haden't waken up and Demi had been taken for a walk around the building. Mrs. Connor didn't go home, they told her she could stay. They did some test on Jasmine the next day and said her brain molocules are coming back toghether which is a good sign. They said that shows she will be able to speak whenever she wakes up. Demi returned from her walk with the GMS nurses,That meant Give Me Strength, They were basically personal rehab childrens nurses. And they helped her regain her strength. They found Mrs. Connor on the floor crying. The 2 nurses got her up and calmed her down. Then she told them everything about her husband and how he'd done this to Demi and Jasmine. They explained to her that they would tell the police and he would be arrested. Usually she'd keep her husband a secret but she'd be leaving soon and he couldn't do or say anything to her to make her stop. He'd be in jail. And she was getting a divorce too. Jasmine still slept through all of this. When the nurses left she prayed that Jasmine would wake up soon. And she did later on that day. Mrs. Connor was sitting on the chair inbetween her daughters half thinking half watching TV while Demi was laying down on her bed watching spongebob when suddenly they both heard a moaning noise. They looked up and saw that Jasmine was squirming trying to get up. They both ran over to Jasmine's bedside. Demi felt stronger now because she had 2 nurse from GMS. Jasmine's eye slowly opened. Then she looked alert when she saw her mom and her sister standing there looking at her. \"Who are you?\" she looked at her mom. \"Who is she?\" she looked at Demi. \"Where am I?\" she looked around suspiciously. \"Your in the hospital sweetie. And I'm your mother. That's Demitria. You call her Demi. She's your older sister\" Mrs. Connor finished with watery eyes. \"Really?\" Jasmine said looking at them. This made her close her eyes and think. She started to get a headache, thinking too much. Mrs. Connor could tell this was too much for her and grabbed Jasmine's hands and squeezed them. Jasmine stopped and opened her eyes with a painful look on her face. \"Stop it you're gonna mess up her brain cells even more than they already are\" Jasmine looked at Demi then back at Mrs. Connor. \"So if you're my sister, and you're my mom, where's my dad?\" and then everything got quiet. Demi interrupting. \"He did this to you Jas. Her threw you down the stairs in our house and you were knocked unconscious. I'm here too because he kicked me in the ribs and cracked two of them\" \"Oh no. Are you ok?\" \"Yea I think\" \"Well what about me? Am I gonna be ok? Whenever I think my head starts to hurt and I can't even remember your name's even though you just told me 3 minutes ago\" Jasmine looked at them worried. \"Jasmine you'll be ok. It'll just take alittle more time ok?\" Mrs. Connor said trying to be strong not to cry. Jasmine shook her head. Then she looked up again curiously. \"What's my name?\" and the words stung Mrs. Connor's ears. She let out a short sob and then turned around and wiped her eyes. \"Jasmine\" she said crying. \"Jasmine...Lovato\" and then Mrs. Connor turned around. Demi looked at her. \"We're Lovato's now. Not Connors\" she finished smiling at Demi. Demi smiled back and Jumped up and down. \"And your sister Demi, she's going to be an actress\" she looked at Demi shocked face. \"Yea they casted you as the role of Angela!\" and then Demi hugged Mrs,...Ms. Lovato excited. \"And we're all going to move to a different city when you get better. When both of you get better\" she smiled again sweetly. Then her phone rung. It was Ms. Gomez. \"Hello?\" \"Hi Mrs. Connor! Did you get the news about Demi yet? Because Kathy Parker just called and said Selena got casted as Gianna, the 2nd role!\" \"Yea I got the news earlier. Demi's Angela! So we'll all be living in Dallas together!\" \"Great! So How's Jasmine ad Demi doing?\" \"Well Jasmine just woke up. Demi's able to walk again. Are you guys on your way?\" \"Yes we are. I was just calling for a warning\" \"Ok. Thanks Mandy I'll see you soon\" \"Ok bye\" and they hung up. \"Selena's going with usss!\" Ms. Lovato said to Demi. Demi's jaw dropped as she looked at her mom happily. \"Who's Selena?\" Jasmine looked at them. \"She's my very best friend in the whole wide world\" Demi said walking back up to her bed. Jasmine shook he head. \"Sorry. Doesn't ring a bell\" and Demi then got back on her bed. Later that night Jasmine was sitting in her room staring out the window. Her mom, Demi, Ms. Gomez, and Selena went to the hospital food court to get something to eat. Jasmine was thinking about her father. Even though she really wasn't supposed to be thinking at all. She still couldn't help it though. Why would he throw her down the stairs? Just then the door to her room flew open. There was a man there she thought she'd never seen before. She got alittle afraid at how he kept on staring at her not doing anything. Then he walked it and stod over her bed. \"Hi?\" she said frightened. He started to rub her stomach gently. Jasmine felt uncomfortable. \"Do you feel better baby?\" he looked at her. She tried to push his hand away. \"Um yea I guess. Who are you?\" she struggle trying to get him to stop touching her that way. \"I'm your daddy. Stop trying to push me away. I'm just gonna make you feel good ok?\" he started to rub her alittle for faster and violently. \"Please stop it\" Jasmine said feeling scared. He went down to kiss her violently. She screamed in the kiss. Then he got on the bed over top of her. He pulled away 10 minutes later. Jasmine was now crying. He looked at her and smiled. \"It's ok baby\" then he felt her tensly. He found the tie for her hospital dress and untied it. Jasmine didn't have anything on so this left her naked. He started to rub her again. \"Please Stooooop!\" she yelled, crying. He didn't stop though. He went down to her private area and felt it. She cried even more. He started to finger the little 7 year old. She cried in pain. \"Stop it that hurts!\" then she slapped him. He took his finger out and felt his face, burning. He smiled to him self and got off her. She tried to get away put she was to weak to move. Her medication made her drowsy. He came back with tape. He taped her arms to the arm rest of the bed. Then he taped her legs to the bottom of the bed. \"Now that'll keep you still wont it?\" then he got back over top of her and began to finger her again. Jasmine felt frightend and uneasy. She was crying really light, but really hard. He did it harder and this made he scream in pain. She couldn't do anyting about it. Then he started to lick her flat chested area. He sucked on her nipples and she whinned miserably. He started to undress himself as he kept on fingering her and sucking on her flat breast. She was still crying too. He soon didn't even have underwear on and Jasmine got beyond uncomfortable and scared. They she felt it. He had stuck his penis into her. She screamed loudly. End of dream Jasmine's POV: I woke up at about 4:16 screaming. This made my mom, and Demi run into the room. I began to cry. Thinking about the time my father had raped me in a hospital room at my worst condition. \"He raped me-h-he raped mee-e-e-e\" I said crying trying to talk. This left Mom and Demi confused. \"Who raped you Jasmine?\" Demi said. \"D-daddy\" I said to her. \"Did you have a dream about that?\" mom asked me holding my hand. I nodded. \"Sweetie we moved so far away from that man. He can't hurt us anymore. It's been year's since that day, why are all of a sudden thinking of it now?\" my mother asked me. \"I dont know!\" I yelled. \"Ok well why don't you sleep with mom tonight ok?\" Demi said to me putting her hand on my shoulder. I nodded again and got up. Then I went to the guest room with mom. I fell back to sleep this time dreaming of Justin and Me at our wedding. I happy non-scary dream. A dream hopefully of the future. No more past stories.[Chapter 8] You Broke My Heart Justin's POV \"Hey babe, Im on the tour bus we're on our way\" I texted her. I just said goodbye to my mom. Then Ryan and Cody. I was gonna miss them so much. Luckily I'll won't be away from them too long. It was 10:04 in the morning. There are fans these crazy fans chasing the bus and I'm the only one that noticed. \"Aye Kenny, can you lose the girls? Their gonna track Jasmine down if they keep following\" I yelled to Kenny, the driver and our bodyguard. \"Sure Justin\" he yelled back. After that there was a huge swerve and we ended up on a highway. \"Scooter remind me why we got a huge bus with our picture on it?\" I said. \"Don't worry we'll be on the highway the whole time\" he assured me then going back to his iphone. \"K Im jus getin my stuff outside, Lawrence txtd me earlier n sed he'd meet us in Colorado. So I'll c u in a few xoxo\" Jasmine texted me. I smiled. Whenever she texted me xoxo she wanted to kiss me. \"You're really in love with her huh?\" Scooter said obviously seeing my smile. \"Yea. Deeply\" I said smirking. \"Ok J. Don't break this dude. I've known you for 4 years man. And I've seen you jump from girl to girl. You're lucky she took you back after your little stunt. I just don't-\" I stopped him getting irritated by this lecture \"Want me to mess up? Scooter I've been in love with this girl for 7 months now, I'd kill myself if I messed this up. She's my first ever love and I never ever in my entire life felt this way about a girl. There's no way in hell I'd mess this up. No way.\" I said to him seriously. \"Ok dude. I'm just saying\" he said then going back his iphone again. \"And I'm just saying, Jasmine's too good of a girl to let go. I just want people to know that this time, I know that. It runs through my brain everyday\" I said. Then he put his phone down, got up, and sat down next to me. \"Ok. Justin I just want you to understand, love has it's ups and downs and that not everything in a relationship is perfect. You've gotta hold on to Jasmine this time Justin. And I'm not saying this as an adult, I'm not saying this as your manager, I'm saying this as your friend. Dude you're like a little brother to me, I have to watch after you. Jasmine's way to special a girl to treat her like you treat all your other little girlfriends. If you and Jasmine get in a fight you'll mope around for a whole week. But those other girls are just lent you flick off your shirt. I can tell Jasmine means a lot to you-\" I didn't let him finish \"She does. And I'd do anything to make her happy. Man, you've gotta stop babying me like I'm a child. I can handle this stuff. You just aren't giving me a chance to show you how much I love this girl. I mean, she's smart, funny, beautiful, thoughtful, fun, talented, unique, goofy, sensitive, real-not fake, and amazing. That's exactly what I want. And I have it, I love it, I see it everyday. Our relationship maybe isn't perfect. But she sure as hell is. Scooter I love her. I won't do anything to make her broken-hearted and left out. I love her\" I said almost in tears. He rubbed my back. \"Ok man\" he said and we went into to a bear hug. \"Ok Justin we're here. It looks like Jas needs some help with her bags. Lets go help\" Kenny said getting up. Kenny was a huge guy. I couldn't believe how fun he was. Me and Scooter got up and walked outside. There was the girl of my dreams. With her hair in her natural crinkly out style. And she had on soldier green shorts, and a taffy pink tank top. Her pink pearl earrings and silver butterfly necklace made her stand out in her casual outfit. She was giving her mother a hug when I got out. Maddie ran up to me and gave me a hug on my leg. She was crying. I picked her up and started walking over to Jasmine and her Mom. \"Well hello there beautiful!\" I said to her giving her a kiss on the cheek. This made her stop crying and laugh. \"Why are you leaving! I don't want you and Jasmine to leave!\" she yelled holding on to me. \"Well we'll see you in 2 weeks! We have to go! You know how many people like me and your godsister's voice? We have to go! I tell you what. We're gonna bring you back that barbie doll you wanted ok?\" I said to her wiping her tears. \"But it's in North Carolina!\" she yelled happy. \"Well we're going there\" Jasmine said forcing her suitcase shut when I finally got to her. She was walking towards the bus. \"Hey bae\" she said leaning in for a quick but sweet kiss. \"Ew!\" Maddie yelled and squirmed out of my arms then ran to Demi. Jasmine laughed as she loaded a bag on to the bus. \"How was your night?\" she wiped her hands on her pants and threw her arms around my neck. I slowly slid my hands around her waist and put my forehead against hers while we were both backing up to a spot where nobody could see us. \"It was amazing. Mostly because I dreamt of you\" I smiled at her. She blushed. \"And yours\" I said. \"It was peachy\" she said a little low and weird. Something's up. \"What's wrong Jas?\" I said pulling her closer to me. \"Nothing I just,..Nothing\" she said looking away. \"Jasmine\" I shifted her head to face me then I returned my arm around her waist. \"You know I hate it when you lie to me. What's wrong baby?\" I said. \"I-I'll tell when you're ready\" she said. \"Tell me what?\" I asked her curious. I can tell she forced that smile on her face then she kissed me. She knew I'd forget about it. And I did. We kissed for about a minute until Demi called for us. We were on the opposite side of the bus so they couldn't see us. Then Demi went around to the side we were on. \"Could you 2 stop sucking each other tongues off for a freaking second and help!\" she yelled then walked away. Jasmine turned back around to me. I looked at her weird. She giggled \"Demi gets cranky when she has to wake up before 11:00\". \"Ohhh\" I said and pecked her lips again. \"Come on!\" Then she ran to the other side of the bus. I chased her. \"I know this might sound crazy but I don't wanna leave anymore! I'll miss everybody too much!\" she said while she put more bags on the bus. \"How many bags do you have exactly. They've already put your outfits in your closet, your make-up in your drawers, your pj's in your bens all of it! In your room what could these bags possibly be!\" I said joking with her. \"Ever heard of just being prepared!\" she yelled. \"We're gonna be gone for six months! You never know what you might need!\" she said walking back into the house. \"She's amazing\" I said walking over to her mom joking again. \"Well that's how I raised her! Smart isn't she\" she said and winked at me. \"I'm gonna miss you Mrs. Gabby\" I said getting closer to her. \"No ser un niño de chupar!\" she said hugging me. Being with Jasmine for all this time I know what most of the Spanish her mom speaks is. She call me a suck up \"What! I'm not being a suck up!\" I yelled pulling away from her. \"I'm just joking! But don't try anything on her. You know she's-\" \"I won't try anything. I promise\" I said serious. \"I'm gonna miss you too boy. I'll visit at times. You kids have fun though\" she said patting my back. I kissed her on the cheek. She giggled. That's when Jasmine came out, in her silly acting mode. \"OHMYGODNESS your cheating on me with my MOTHER! Oh I can't believe you'd do this to me!\" she said turning her back to me. I came up behind her and hugged her. \"You know my heart's eyes are only on yours\" I said. She turned around and smiled at me, then she took my hat off and put on her head. I didn't want her to see my hair cut yet! Her face expression changed quickly. \"Oh my goodness! Ohmygod! Justin! Baby! You-You gotta hair cut!\" she yelled hugging me tight. Then she let go and looked at it more. \"You like it?\" I said already knowing her reply. \"I FREAKIN LOVE IT!\" she yelled again. I kissed her. \"Thank you\" I said. \"Ok! Everyone this is not the official goodbye! I'll see you in two weeks!\" she yelled. We got on the bus and waved goodbye to everyone. The bus pulled off. This was gonna be a looooong trip to Colorado! Jasmine's POV \"Come on Colorado lemme hear yooouu!\" I yelled into the mic. Everyone went crazy. The music started, here we go!

Then he went out and did his thing, did amazing, and we left to go to Nashville. I was beat. I took a shower after Justin, then after Scooter and Lawrence fell asleep me and Justin snuggled up together and watched a movie until we fell asleep. The next morning Justin got a call for Ellen's producers, She wants me and Justin on the show again next month. Since she had a whole bunch of other celebs ahead of us. We stopped at an ihop and got it to go. South Nashville is crazy about us too! There were fans that spotted the bus and ran over to it and started banging on the door. I couldn't be more annoyed by that right now. I was still tired. But I still got my ass up. Me and Justin were sleeping together because we kinda drifted off and then didn't wake up. So Scooter go mad and said we were 'too young' when we do it all the time. After we finished eating breakfast Justin had to do his singing practices. And Usher was on the phone with someone so I had to wait. But now I'm taking the time to write a new song. I got my notebook out and started to write. It's gonna be about Justin. Lets get writing. I was...I was searchin' searchin', no. I was lookin' lookin', no. I was...runnin'! I was runnin', runnin', um, lookin for somebody but..but...I always..end up with nothin' nothin', wasn't..just a, just a matter of time when...just a matter of time but I know my prince was runnin',...comein'.

Just a matter of time but I know my prince was comein' comein'. And now I know I found you, cause you had me at hello, hello, hello uh\" I sang. Usher looked up and smiled at me. \"What?\" I said. He just kept smiling at me. \"Did you write that?\" he asked me still smiling. \"Yeah, I just wrote it up, why?\" I said. He was STILL smiling when he got up and started to help me with the song. Usher was a good song writer. I absolutely LOVED what we came up with. After about an hour and a half we had it. The whole thing finished. We even added some music and back-up with Justin's electric piano. Justin wanted to hear it so we did it for him. He sat in a chair in front of us and stared. Usher started to play the piano. And put on the backround music. I was Running, Running Looking for somebody but I always end up with Nothing, Nothing Just a matter of time and I knew my prince was Coming, Coming And now I know I found you Cuz you had me at Hello, Hello, Hello uh Tryna follow rules but I don't know the protocol Should I make this move or are you even interested at all Am I right, am I wrong if my instincts are honest Then welcome to my heart Yeah I was trying fill this empty space Looking for someone who can take this pain away And still somehow I'd end up feeling lonely And then I met you, then I met you Oh I was Running, Running Looking for somebody but I always end up with Nothing, Nothing Just a matter of time and I knew my prince was Coming, Coming And now I know I found you Cuz you had me at Hello, Hello, Hello uh Standing on this wall I don't know how to catch my breath Can you tell I'm watching Can you feel this beating in my chest It's for you babe Don't know why it took so long To tell you welcome to my heart Yeah I was trying fill this empty space Looking for someone who can take this pain away And still somehow I end up feeling lonely And then I met you, then I met you Oh I was Running, Running Looking for somebody but I always end up with Nothing, Nothing Just a matter of time and I knew my prince was Coming, Coming And now I know I found you Cuz you had me at Hello, Hello, Hello And the stars must have aligned For my lucky chance at love If I met you at this moment This could be the right time now Looking in your eyes I say welcome to my heart Oh I was Running, Running Looking for somebody but I always end up with Nothing, Nothing Just a matter of time and I knew my prince was Coming, Coming And now I know I found you Cuz you had me at Hello, Hello, Hello uh Hello my love I'm so glad I met you Hello my love I won't forget you Hello my love, my love, my love Hello, Hello, Hello uh Justin looked at me and smiled. \"That was for me?\" was all he managed to get out. \"Yeah I guess. I mean I was just goofing around so-\" Usher interrupted \"No, Jas you gotta get this to a studio. That was tight\" he said at a silly attempt to slang. I shook my head assuring him it wasn't that good. I laughed. \"But I'm serious, that was really good. You know who would be a good producer for this song?\" he asked Justin. \"Uhh tricky?\" he guessed. \"No...hmm..oh Ryan Leslie!\" Usher bursted out. \"Oh yeah. Yeah Jasmine he's a really good music producer, plus that music is his type. Usher can you get him on the phone?\" Justin looked towards Usher. \"Yea let me see if I can get to his studio\" he said, got up, and walked to the guest room in the bus. Justin got up and sat closer to me. He grabbed my hand and kissed me. This was passionate and perfect. Plus it was extra sweet and soft. He kissed me for about 10 seconds then pulled away. \"What was that for?\" I said feeling dizzy. \"You wrote that awesome song for me. Thank you\" he said and kissed me again. THIS turned into a make-out session. Until Usher came in. It was awkward because when we pulled away he was just staring at us, and then we stared back and he never talked...so neither did we! \"You guys need a camera\" he said making me and Justin laugh. \"Anyway yo, I got Ryan on the phone and next week after the Miami show we're gonna meet him at his studio. Now I'm gonna go hang with Kenny,...but you never know when I'm watching...\" then he slowly slipped away. I looked at Justin again. \"Sooo..wanna go to the beach?\" he asked me then went down and started kissing my neck. I giggled \"Stop! Umm..sure, I'll go put on some beach clothes\" I said got up and walked out. Before that I looked back at him and winked. He smiled. \"Sexy ass\" he said. He's such a flirt. ~at the beach Me and Justin played in the water for a while then that's when the paparazzi ambushed us with their pictures and questions. Me and Justin managed to escape to the other side of the beach. It was soo romantic. He carried me through the water and held my hand when we were walking on the sand. We sat down after awhile and watched the sunset. \"You look freakin hot in that bikini Jas\" he said checking me out. \"Well you and your abs steal the show!\" I said laughing. He layed me down and put his arm around my waist. Then he stared into my eyes. Hard. \"I don't think I'll ever want any other girl Jasmine. You're perfect. You could never top any other girl in the universe. I love you so much\" he said. I could read his eyes. He really meant what he said. I started tearing up. \"I love you too Justin. Way more than you think\" I layed on his chest. \"I know you do\" he kissed my forehead. Then shortly after we saw a crowd of flashing lights and loud talking people. It was the paparazzi again. \"Shit\" Justin said helping me up. I got up to and we ran to the nearest shack and hid till they walked away. Then we went through the short cut out of the trees and grass and went back into the bus. Omg! Joe's here! Joe's POV \"JOE!\" Jasmine screamed as she came into the bus. \"What heck are you doing here!\" she ran over to me and hugged me. \"I came here to see my soon to be baby-sister!\" I said hugging her back. And I really needed to tell her about the offer Kenny Ortega said to me about her. He told me he thought Jasmine would be good in one of his movies he's thinking about putting together. Me and Demi went out with Zac, Vanessa, Corbin, and Ashley the other day. And Kenny wanted to go to the restaurant with us. So we took him and got a VIP table for 7. While the girls were catching up, I was telling the guys about how I was going to propose to Demi and the Camp Rock concert next week. Then we got into the conversation of Jasmine. He told me he thought Jasmine was a talented young girl and that he'd love to meet her one day. Then he told me he would be in San Jose' on Saturday. And at that moment I remembered Jasmine would be performing in San Jose' Saturday night. That's why I'm here now. I need to tell Jasmine about the movie. \"Well that's sweet of you!\" she said pulling away still in my arms. \"Baby sister?\" Justin asked Drying his face off. \"Oh I forgot to tell you! Joe's proposing to Demi next week at their camp rock concert on 'Good morning America' \" she said to him turning around. \"Oh. Congrats man!\" he said hand shaking me. \"Thanks. Anyways Jas, me and Dems went to hang with the hsm crew the other day and me and Kenny got to talking about you. He told me he thought you were really talented and said you'd be good as the main role in one of the movies he's making\" I flexed out my arms and gave her that asking look. \"Omg! Are freaking kidding!\" she said covering her mouth. \"Kenny FREAKIN Ortega! Said I..would be good..as a role..in his movie!\" she yelled again. She was hurting my ear. \"Yes!...Stop yelling!\" I said. \"But wait! there's more! He's gonna be in San Jose on Saturday just like you are. And he's gonna be at your concert, then he's gonna meet with you afterwards to talk. Sound good?\" I grabbed her shoulder and looked at her. \"Um..yea! Omg I can't believe it. Kenny Ortega wants me to be in his movie!\" she ran to Justin and scream into his chest. He gave me a yikes look. I laughed. Justin tried to talk with her still hovering him. \"So do you know what the movies about?\" he struggled. \"No idea. But I do know it's a PG-13 love story\" I said. \"Damn it! There's going to be teenage sexual interaction in it!\" he sweared. \"Um...maybe there just a lot of cursing\" Jasmine said finally pulling away from his chest. \"Yea...maybe..\" he said mysteriously. It's fun to watch a young couple like them. They've got to learn to deal with on-screen relationships. Demi learned to be ok with Chelsea. I learned to deal with Sterling. We have to have enough trust in each other. And we do. It's always good and strong enough. That's how I finaled my decision of proposing. \"Ok soo..where are we meeting? What time too?\" she asked pulling away from Justin and going to grab a drink. \"Well, I gave him your number. And he should call you when he's ready. And I know your patience Jas you just gotta wait, k?\" I said walking over to her. \"...hhuuu! Ok\" she hugged me. \"So I'm kind of curious Joe. How'd you find us?\" he asked. \"Well I called Scooter earlier and he told me you guys were in Nashville and I was pretty close to here, so he directed me to the bus and I just waited for you guys to come back\" I finished. The truth is I wasn't alone. Demi came with me. She's got a suprise. She completely died her hair. It's not black anymore, it's brown with blonde highlights. She looked amazing, and she was going to be at the restaraunt we might go to. \"Ohhh\" they both said. \"So do you guys like, wanna go to dinner or something?\" I asked. They both looked at each other then said \"Sure\". \"Great we can go to the Milia's on 4th street\" I said informing them. \"Cool. Haven't been to Milia's in ages!\" Jasmine said. \"Me and Demi had an Aunt down here and we we'd come spend the summer with her. We went to Mila's almost every night\" she said. \"I was at the Mila's in Virgina when you were doing your single show. The food was awsome\" Justin added. \"Yea Demi told me about you guys and your aunt. She thought it'd be a good idea to bring back memories. Well, atleast, the good ones\" I said. Oops I didn't mean to say that out loud. Justin looked at me confused while Jasmine didn't mouth it or say it out loud, but she made that 'Joe!' face. \"What bad memories did you hav-\" he started to say, but in order to move the subject Jasmine said \"So Demi's here?\". I looked at her. \"Yea\" I said. She nodded and quickly scattered off to her room to change. \"I'll be back\" she said as she walked. Jasmine's POV There is absolutly no way I'm telling Justin about my dad. For all Justin knows right now is he's dead. And Justin would never ever ask me about him again. That's why I'm so nervous about getting into bed with him. I think he'll try to rape me. Even though I KNOW Justin would NEVER do that to me, I can't seem to get the idea out of my head. I was completely shocked when we went to meet up with Demi. Her hair was brown with blonde highlights! She looked gorgeous! I went and hugged her then the waitress took us all to a VIP section. I sat next to Demi and Justin sat across from me. Joe sat across from Demi on the right side of the booth. There was a little girl that had to be about Maddie's age, and her mother sent her over ot get all our autographs. \"What's you name sweetie?\" I asked her as I took her the pen and notebook. \"Madison\" she replied shyly. I smiled at her and said \"I know, I have a little sister back in L.A. and her name is Madison too\" I said while writing out: Madison you're adorable, stay Natural. -Jasmine Villegas Then I passed it Demi, she passed it to Joe, he passed it to Justin, then he gave back to Madison. She smiled and said 'thank you' then she ran back over to her mother. Her mom grabbed her and looked back up at us then smiled and waved. We waved back. The waitress came to take our orders. I got the steak and mashed potatoes. Demi smiled at me because that's what I used to get when we were little. Demi ordered French toast and eggs, which is what she used to get when we were little. We all had a nice conversation, and we caught up with each other. Next thing I knew we were walking out giving each other hugs. \"I'll see you next week!\" I say to Demi hugging her tightly. \"Ok. Make sure you get there on time, I'm performing my new song at the begining of the show\" she said. I nodded and say \"Bye Dems\" then walked over to Joe \"And I will see you and your crazy old brothers next week too?\" I asked him resting my palms on his shoulders. \"Yes you will\" he said then got lower \"I can't do it without you there, so make sure you're there Jas\" then he hugged me and I kissed him on the cheek. I whispered \"Promise\"[Chapter 9] You Broke My Heart ~In Jasmine's Dream The Lovato girls have been in Dallas for 4 months and have been happier then ever. Demi and Selena are doing great working on their show. And the Lovato's and Gomez' are all staying in the same house together. Even Ms. Lovato has gained $1,345 from court with her ex-husband, who has been sentenced 8 years in jail. One day Jasmine was sitting at her normal lunch table with her friends and she saw a little brown-haired asain girl at the end of the table eating alone. Jasmine had already known she was the new girl. She was 7 years old and didn't talk much. But she was very smart. Jasmine dragged her lunchbox along with her and slid down to the end of the table where the little girl was. \"Hi!\" Jasmine said enthuiasticly. \"Hi!\" the little girl chanted back. \"What's your name?\" Jasmine asked. \"My name's Jazzy. Mejia. Jazzy Mejia\" she thought out loud. \"Oh. Nice to meet you Jazzy Mejia\" Jasmine said and put her hand out. \"Wait,\" Jazzy stopped \"Don't you have to tell me your name before we shake?\" she asked. \"Oh yeah! My name's Jasmine. Lovato. Well I used to be Jasmine Connor but my Mommy gotta divorce with my daddy and now me and my sister are Lovato's. My sister is Demi Lovato from off of \"Barney and friends\" and I got to be on there with her for an episode\" Jasmine said not purposly braging. \"Oh! That's where I know you from! My little brother Chau, loves \"Barney and friends\"! We watch it all the time. Oh my goodness I can't believe I'm talking to a famous person!\" Jazzy yeped. Jasmine laughed \"You're funny\". \"Oh thanks\" Jazzy said laughing along realizing how crazy she was being. \"Jasmine!\" Jasmine's friend Kelly yelled at the other end of the table. Jasmine looked at Kelly then turned back to Jazzy. \"Come sit with us Jazzy\" Jasmine insisted. \"Really?\" she asked. \"Well yea!\" and Jasmine pulled Jazzy by the wrist and dragged her(gently) all the way to the other end of the table. And since that day Jazzy and Jasmine have been best friends. They were always together and stuck by each other. They loved all the same things and did everything together. They were the victorious example of 'BFFLs'. They basically called each other sisters. And when they moved out of elementray school, obvious guess, they went to the same Middle school. Jasmine got to meet Jazzy's cousin Ralfey. He had moved to L.A. a week after Jasmine and Jazzy met. By then Selena had moved out and got different kind of acting roles in L.A. Though when Jasmine was 11 the Lovato family also moved to L.A. because Demi gotta a role as a guest star in some show there. After the move Jasmine never saw Jazzy again. She got small roles in tv shows and a backround character in Demi's videos but that's it. After that she was pretty normal. Then, there was that one awards show. Where she met the guy of her dreams... ~End of Dream Jasmine's POV *the next week in NY* I was waken up by a gorgeous face in front of me, meeting his lips to mine. I kissed him back lightly. Then he pulled away. \"Good Morning girl of my dreams\" he said. I smiled. \"Good Morning, guy of my dreams\" I say back. We were both in his room and under the covers. We were up late last night watching movies. I got all the way up and kissed him again. I noticed he was just wearing basketball shorts. His abs were out and about. Turning me on. I also notice I didn't have anything on but a t-shirt and some booty pj shorts that could be underwear. He moved his hand to my upper waist and rubbed on the spot he was on. I reached up and wrapped my arm around his neck, then pulled him down. We were both laying down on the pillow, making out. He deepened the kiss and started to put his hand up my shirt. Had to stop it. I rolled over on top of him and pulled away. \"You gotta good way with me don't you. Damn Justin, I turned on!\" I said tracing around his face. \"I am too\" he said laughing. I kissed him one more time then got up and went to the bathroom. I had to stop it before it led on to something else. I'm still not ready for the sex part of the relationship. I looked out the window and gasped. We were in the big city! New York! I loved New York because the clothes are great and everybody comes here! Plus Justin told me he had a suprise for me. I looked at the time. It was 6:27 in the morning. I was gonna miss Demi and the guys interview at 7. Oh well I'll be at the concert part on time if I rush. I got in the shower, then thought about what nice looking clothes I could change into. This was a VERY special occasion. When I got out of his bathroom in my bra and underwear, Justin looked up at me and smiled. \"Sexy,sexy\" he flirted. \"You perv!\" I screamed throwing a pair of boxers at his face. I ran out of the room and tried to run to my room down the other side of the bus, but Justin caught me. Then he flipped me around and stared at me. \"I love New York\" I said to Justin. \"Me too\" he said. \"I wonder what the veiw of it at night time looks like. I bet it looks amazing. I've never seen a veiw of New York. I really want to though, I guess I just never got a chance to\" I said. I noticed our lips were oftley close to each other. Justin must have to because he took the chance and started to kiss me again. We're making out in a bus living room, half naked. We're dead. I reach up and chug on his hair lightly. He tightened his grip on my waist. At first his arms were just resting, now he's holding me. He pulled away and started sucking on my neck. I breathed. 1/4 of me wanted to push him away. But the rest of me was telling me not to. It felt so good, and I forgot all about my past problems. But then I realized where we were and what we would look like if someone walked in on us. I was about to stop it but it was too late. A half sleep Scooter walked in from his room and paused. Me and Justin didn't know until he dropped his phone. He was just staring at us shocked. And me and Justin both know. Whenever he's shocked or suprised at something, he gets angry the next second. We were right. \"WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TOO DOING!\" he asked turning red. The room was filled was silence. Me and Justin looked at eachother then we both ran to our rooms. Let's just say, what just happend...has been majorly forgotten. We convinced he was dreaming. He was already half sleep. And didn't know what was happening. Phew! So glad I got away with that! At about 7:08 the car we were supposed to arive in showed up beside the bus and honked. Me and Justin rushed out of his room then into the car. The driver hurried to the 'Good Morning America' studio and we rushed in. Lucky for us, when we pulled up, they had just gotten onstage. Joe's POV I wait in the trailer for the signal for me to come out. There are so many people around the trailer and the stage I couldn't even look at what was happening. There was still no sign of Jasmine yet. The guys and Selena are trying to calm me down, oh did I mention Selena and Demi made up?, and tell me she'll be here but I'm getting worried. I can't do it without Jasmine here. \"Look guys, stop! It's final! If Jasmine doesn't come then I'm not proposing!\" I yelled. \"Oh hell yea you are! Dude you've prepared for this forever and your not just gonna give up!\" Nick said. \"And plus, why do you even need Jasmine here?\" Kevin asked. \"Because with Jasmine here I feel a lot more confident and stronger. And Jasmine is like my little sister. She motivates me and tells me everything will be ok. I need that. From her \" I finished. \"Well you got it Mr. Jonas\" I heard a relieving voice say. I turned around to see Jasmine standing in front of the doorway with Justin behind her, his arms wrapped around her waist. I let out a sigh of relief, got up, and went to hug her. \"I'm so sorry I'm late! Me and Justin...overslept-Kevin! Nick! Selena!\" she moved on to the others. I looked at Justin and squinted my eyes. He knew what I was saying. He shook his head and smiled. I reached out my hand and hand shaked him. \"Nice man\" I said low. \"We didn't get far though\" he assured me. \"Good. Next time you wanna do those things, do them when I'm not going to propose to my girlfriend live on television\" I said joking. He laughed \"Sure thing\" he said. I soon had to go out on the stage with the guys a perform 'heart and soul'. Then Demi came back out with the rest of the cast and did 'We can't back down'. Then me and Demi finished off the show with 'Wouldn't Change a Thing'. The guys were doing the instuments so that made me feel a bit less nervous. And every once and awhile during the song I look at the window of the trailer for Jasmine. She was right there giving me her award winning smile, letting me know, it was gonna be ok . When the song ended I braced myself. One thing I wasn't being is revealing and obvious. The audience cheered and Demi was saying her 'I love you's and her 'Goodbye's. But before she walked off the stage I said \"Well, hold on,hold on,hold on wait. Nick can you bring a stool for Demi?\" I asked Nick. He grabbed a stool and put behind Demi so she could sit on it. As he did it she looked at him with a confused face. Nick caught her stare and smirked at her. Then he winked. \"Ok so I don't want to take up too much of your end time, so I'll try to make this quick\" I say to the audience. Kevin walked up to me and took my mic. The camera crew gave me a mic to attach to my shirt before the show, so the audience could hear me, and I've have free hands. I pulled it out and put it on my shirt. Demi squinted her eyes and sat down on the stool. I looked over at the trailer one more time before the big question. Jasmine was right there . I turn back to Demi. Demi POV As the audience settled I looked at them with my 'What the hell is going on?' face. I said into the mic \"I have no clue what he's doing, seriously\" I looked out at everyone. Joe was smiling at me. I didn't say this into the mic I said it to Joe \"What are you doing Joe?\" I ask him. He walked up tp me and kissed me for a couple of seconds. This made everyone 'aww'. Then he pulled away and smirked \"You'll see\" then he talked into the mic again \"So as you all might know me and Demi have been dating for 5 1/2 amazing years..\" he started. Everybody clapped at this. I put my mic in my lap. \"And yes, Demi is the love of my life, I've never seen or heard of a girl as amazing as her. I couldn't ask for a more perfect relationship. She's truely stolen the key to my heart..\" he stopped and stared at me with his deep eyes. The audience 'aww'ed even higher. I smiled at his comment. \"And I really,..really\" he took my hand \"hope we can be together for the rest of our lives. So Demi, I love you, with all my heart...and I want to marry you..\" he said reaching into his back pocket. I gasped. The tears were forming already. He was proposing! I cover my mouth and a tear escaped from my eyes. He got down on one knee and opened the box. He talked into the mic again \"Demetria Devonne Lovato, will you do me the honors of becoming Demetria Devonne Jonas?\" he looked up hopefully. The Audience was going crazy, clapping and cheering. I was still stunned. I looked at the ring and started crying. I heard the audience start chanting 'Say Yes! Say Yes! Say Yes! Say Yes!'. Then I looked back at Joe and saw his warmest smile ever. When ever he smiled sweet he was nervous as crap. I'm taking too long to answer and he thinks I'll say no. I was still crying and I couldn't get words out. So I just nodded and jumped out of the chair to hug him. The audience 'aww'ed again and clapped. He hugged me back and pulled away so he could put the ring on my finger. I looked at my hand and let another quick breath out, still kind of crying. I looked at him and kissed him with all the passion I could. He pulled away and guided me to the trailer. Jasmine's POV \"Ok whoever knew about this is getting killed!\" Demi said as she walked into the trailer. We all broke out into small claps. I ran up to Demi and grabbed her hand so I could lift it up and show all the girls. She wiped her eyes and smiled as she flatend out her hand for a better view. \"Sorry Demi but we all knew. Too bad! You can't kill like 26 people in one day. Plus it'll be noticable\" Megan stated. \"Hey Dems, Moms outside you should go say hi to her. She saw the whole thing\" I said. Demi nodded and and went out the backdoor to the trailer. When she left I turned to Joe and hugged him. I put alittle force in it and he kinda lost his balance, but he hugged back. \"I told you she'd say yes, what reason did she have to say no?\" I whispered. He shook his head. \"No reason I guess\" then he pulled away. \"My soon to be official sister. Like it's gonna change, you were already like a sister to me in the first place\" he said. I smiled at him. Afterwards, Me, Justin, Demi, Joe, Nick, Kevin, Selena, and Danielle went to brunch. Me and Justin had a show that we need to prepare for, so we needed to leave alittle early. We said goodbye to everyone, because we wouldn't be seeing them for another month or two. When I said goodbye to Demi I talked to her and told her to be safe and that I'd see her soon. Same to Joe. Then me and Justin took off. \"What's up New Yoooorrkk\" I screamed into the mic Ohohoh Woohoh Woohho It feels like we've been out at sea, whoa So back and forth that's how it seems, whoa And when I wanna talk you say to me That if it's meant to be it will be Whoa oh no So crazy is this thing we call love And now that we've got it we just can't give up I'm reaching out for you Got me out here in the water And I I'm overboard And I need your love to pull me up I can't swim on my own It's too much Feels like I'm drowning without your love So throw yourself out to me My lifesaver (Lifesaver, oh lifesaver) My lifesaver (Lifesaver, oh lifesaver) Whoa (Justin) I never understood you when you'd say, whoa Wanted me to meet you halfway, whoa Felt like I was doing my part You kept thinking you were coming up short It's funny how things change cause now I see Oh whoa So crazy is this thing we call love And now that we've got it we just can't give up I'm reaching out for you Got me out here in the water And I I'm overboard (overboard) And I need your love to pull me up I can't swim on my own It's too much (it's too much) Feels like I'm drowning (ohh) Without your love So throw yourself out to me My lifesaver (Justin & Jessica) Oh It's supposed to be some give and take I know But you're only taking and not giving anymore So what do I do Cause I still love you (I still love you baby) And you're the only one who can save me Whoa, whoa, whoa, oh I'm overboard And I need your love to pull me up (pull me up) I can't swim on my own It's too much (it's too much) Feels like I'm drowning without your love (I'm drowning baby, I'm drowning) So throw yourself out to me (I can't swim) My lifesaver (Lifesaver, oh lifesaver) My lifesaver It's crazy crazy crazy (Lifesaver, oh lifesaver) Lifesaver oh (Lifesaver, oh lifesaver) My lifesaver (Lifesaver, oh lifesaver) Yeah Justin gave me hug and said into the mic \"Give it up for Jasmine V everyone!\" and walked off the stage. It took Justin a long time to be finished, but he did really good. I watched him on the big screen in our dressing room. When he came back he changed into a nice looking dress outfit on. \"Justin where are we going?\" I asked him. \"On a date\" he replied. \"You don't usually dress up that nice\" I said. \"Well this date is special, and I'm taking you somewhere special so dress nice\" he said. I smiled at him. \"I'm gonna be waiting by the exit, take your time\" and then he slipped out of the room. I went and searched through my bag for something nice to wear. Where could he be taking me? Well this is New York City. There are A LOT of sites to see. As I think about it I realize my outfit has to be REALLY cute. I searched through my bag faster, I found a cute flowy blue dress with silver rinestones in the middle of it(in my profile). I picked out some cute matching stilettos and earrings. Then I put on some lip gloss, blue eyeshadow, and blush. I checked myself in the mirror on last time. I looked hot. When I walked out of the room to the exit, I saw Justin waiting with his hands in his pockets looking around. When I got closer to him he looked up and smiled. \"You look hot\" he said grabbing my hand and leading me out. \"Thank you\" I say. We got into a limo and pulled off. When we pulled up at the place, Justin dug out something purple and shiney looking out of his pocket. \"What's that?\" I asked. \"It's a blindfold. Here I'll put it on for you\" then he got closer to me and put the blindfold on me. \"This reminds me of our first date\" I say smiling. \"That's the point\" I he got out and open the door for me. \"What?\" asked as he grabbed my hand and guided me to some place. \"Today marks our 60th date\" he said. I felt us step onto an elevator. \"Oh, why didn't you tell me! I didn't get you anything!\" I whinned. \"Don't sweat it\" he stated. \"This was my idea, I didn't tell you on purpose\" he said. \"Oh\" I stopped. I heard him slightly giggle. The elevator was still going. Even though I couldn't see it I feel it. \"You sure you can't see anything?\" he asked. \"Yes Justin!\" I yelled. \"You sure? How many fingers am I holding up?\" he asked. \"I remember this too\" I turned to him. I knew he was right there. I leaned in and kissed him lightly. We continued to do this until the elevator stopped. Justin pulled away, but his forehead on mine, and whispered \"We're here\" then he took my hand again and led me out to someplace breezy. I think we were outside. He walked me somewhere where a ledge was. It felt hard and stiff. It was some type of wall. I'm pretty sure we were in front of a ledge. He wrapped his arms around my waist and whispered in my ear \"Ok take it off now\". I quickly took off the blindfold. I couldn't believe my eyes. It was a huge and perfect view of New York City. I gasped of disbelief. It was even more than I imagined. \"Oh wow\" I whispered. The lights go out and away you go. Green and red lights illuminate the lift shaft and the speed is breathtaking. This is only the beginning. I can even see the empire states rather than be on the top looking at another sky rise. It was slightly unnerving when the wind picked up and everything seemed to move quicker. Then there was the busy streets filled with people trying to catch taxies because they've got heavy shopping bags in their hands. Or the funny frustrated people driving waiting for the traffic to pick up. It was truely astonishing to see. And it was very romantic. Still with my jaw dropped I looked at Justin and smiled then I looked back at the city. \"You like it?\" he asked. \"I love it Justin,\" I turned back around and put my arms around his neck, \"Thank you baby. This is even more amazing than I had imagined it to be, It was so sweet of you to do this for me. I love you\" I said looking deep in his eyes. \"Love you too. But one more thing..\" he said. He slid his hand slowly from my waist and grabbed my hand. I flash of nerve shot through me. He took me to a candle lit table and pulled out a chair for me. \"Oh my goodness\" I said breathless. \"This is the food we made together a couple of weeks ago\". \"Yes it is. And I still don't know the name of it\" he said, making me laugh. We sat down and ate the food. We talked about all of our other dates we had. The conversation was held for about two hours. Then Justin took out a long red box and reached out for my hand. I took it and looked at him. He stood up, and we walked to the wall connected to the ledge. So now I've got full balance on the wall instead of being on the ledge. \"Jasmine, I know I've told you this a thosand times, but I love you. And I think you're amazing. I've been in love before, but not like this. Not as strong as this. I've never had butterflies in my stomach because I was looking at a girl. But I do with you. All the time. And everytime we kiss, those butterflies turn into trapped dragons. I'm just so lucky and blessed to be with a girl like you. You're just like what I've been dreaming of my whole life. I mean it when I say you're the girl of my dreams. You're the only girl I think about. The only girl I want to be with. My heart chose you and it doesn't want anyone else. So now I want to give you this..\" he opened the box to reveal a golden key necklace with diamonds on it. I inhaled out of my mouth sharply, but slowly. \"Wha-What is this?\" I took the box. \"It's the key to my heart\" Justin said sweetly. I looked up from the necklace and stared at him. I tightened up my lips in order to stop myself from crying, though my eyes were already watery. \"And you get to have it\" he said. He grabbed my waist and pulled me off the wall. Then he turned me around and moved my hair so he could get the necklace on easier. I could tell he was having trouble. I reached behind my head and pulled up hair. He reached from behind me and grabbed the box. The cold necklace was wrapped my neck in a quick second. I grabbed it and lifted it up to look at it. It was absolutly gorgeous. \"Justin...this is..beautiful\" I said having a hard time speaking. \"Just like you are\" he stated. I turned back around. I put my forehead on his and stayed there for a second. \"You are the worlds best boyfriend, Justin. Never will I meet a guy as sweet as you\" I say. He smiled and looked at my lips a couple times. I smiled. He was waiting for the right moment to kiss me. I got even closer. \"Go ahead. I don't see anything stopping you\" I said sexily. He smiled and kissed me. At first we started off slow and tender, then Justin deepend and intensified it. We got alittle more into it, and he pushed me back against the wall. After about 30 minutes of kissing, Justin started to play with my dress strap. Not take it off, just play with it. I wasn't uncomfortable with it, I just wanted it to stop. Even though I was seriously enjoying it. I really want to have sex with Justin I just can't get that stupid raping thing out of my head. The second he tried to lift up my dress, I got extremely nervous and pulled away. Then I said \"My! Look at the time! We should be getting back to the bus right now!\" I rushed towards the elevator and pressed the button like 50 times. Justin looked confused as he walked over and got close to me. I looked at him quickly and glanced out at the city again, removing hair from being in my face. \"Jas, it's 9:54\" Justin started \"You seemed like you were enjoying it, what happend?\" he said grabbing my chin so I could look at him. \"Nothing. I just, realized it was late and that their gonna be looking for us\" I said looked away again. \"Jasmine you don't make eye contact when you lie. Tell me what's up\" he looked down at me trying to get me to look up at him. I did. I didn't know what to do. Should I tell him? Or should I keep my mouth shut? I looked at him for awhile. Then the elevator finally got up, and opened. I walked in, with him following me. I looked at the floor and said \"Are you ready for me to tell you?\". He got in front of me and put his forehead on mine. \"Whatever it is, yes. I'm your boyfriend you can tell me anything\" he said. I took a huge breath and said \"Ok how about I tell you when we get to the bus?\". He nodded and smiled. I smiled back and softly pecked his lips. When we got into the bus Scooter and Lawrence were already sleep. We checked. Justin grabbed my hand and led me to the living room. We sat on the couch in silence. I just stared at the floor. I was thinking of a way to tell him. Should I explain it to him then tell him, or should I just burst out and say it and if he wants to know he'll ask. I haven't talked about this in a really long time. And I don't know if I've still got the same effect I used to. Whenever I even thought about it I couldn't stop crying. Considering what happend when I dreamt about it, I think I'll have a hard time getting it out. I can tell Justin was getting impatient, but in a worried way. \"Jas?\" he said. I looked away from the floor and at him. 5 minutes already passed. I started to open my mouth, but no words came out. It seemed like the tears were blocking them. I pushed them out. \"W-when I was...\" my trail of words stopped again. The tears wouldn't let them free. I pushed them out again. \"A little girl I...m-my dad...\" my trail of words stopped again. I sighed in frustration, then the tears immediately started. I looked down and burried my head in my hands. I took a couple deep breaths and kept on talking. \"M-my dad was..abusive, and..O-One day my were fighting and..\" I cried even harder \"I tried to s-stop it and\" I breathed \"he got f-frustrated with me,and pulled by the hair...threw me down the stairs...knocked me unconcious\" I cried harder, then stopped myself again. \"I-I lost my memory and...\" I breathed, then started crying again. I couldn't stop myself. I talked, still crying \"One d-day, my dad..\" I breathed and stopped crying \"My dad came to see me...and I didn't know who he was\" I looked at the ground \"and he kept on...touching and feeling on me...I didn't like it\" it seemed like I was talking to the floor, because I couldn't look at Justin while explaining this. \"Then he started...taking of my hospital dress\" I burst out crying again, but still I talked \"and then he\" I had a difficult time getting the words out. \"He..\" I still couldn't get out \"He r...\" this time I forced it out, and you could hear it \"HE RAPED ME!\" I screamed, crying. I cried into my hands. Justin grabbed me and pulled me into his arms. I cried onto his chest for a long time. Justin was stroking my hair. I once I cooled off a little Justin said \"Jasmine you know I'd never rape you\". I nodded on his chest. \"If you want to wait baby take your time, I'll be ok, it's not the end of the world, if you don't wanna have sex yet then-\" I quickly looked up and said \"No Justin! I do! So badly-I just-everytime I even think about sex I think about what happend to me when I was little. I know you won't rape me, my mind is telling me so. It's me conscience that's making me question about it\" I sniffled. He smiled and wiped my eyes. \"Well what can I do to change you conscience's mind?\" he played with my hair. \"Well..we can always just...try it out...no stress, or interuptions...\" I seductively smiled at him. \"Well lets try it out now\" he flirted. Then we bot went in for a kiss. This had to be the most intense kiss me and Justin ever had. Soon we started frenching., and after awhile Justin pulled away and took my shoes off. We were both smiling the whole time. Then we started to french again. Then we got really into it. Justin, without breaking the kiss, picked me up bridal style and carried me to his side of the bus. Once he shut the door, it was like a night walking through a garden of pleasure. There was smooth music in the backround. And Justin was slow and gentle. He didn't rush. It was amazing, and spontanous. It wasn't painful at all. This was the best night of my life. Tonight Justin definitly taught me the difference between rape, and making love. Never again will the memory of my horrible father be brung back into my mind.[Chapter 10] You Broke My Heart Jasmine's POV I woke up the next morning, weak, and strained. I fell asleep and Justin's chest, while he had his arm around me. 'Love Faces' was on low volume in the backround. I smiled and put my chin on Justin's chest so I could look at him. He was sound asleep. I traced on his six pack to wake him up. He slowly opened his eyes and looked at me. \"Hi\" he said drowsy. \"Hey\" I huffed. \"You know we might get killed today right?\" he smirked. I knew. There was NOWAY Scooter and Lawrence slept through THAT. I shrugged and said \"uh\". He giggled, and pucker his lips. I smiled and got up to peck his lips. I leaned to the floor and grabbed my bra and underwear. It HURT. I guess this is the painful part of sex. I slipped them on under the covers and got up. Justin found his boxers and slipped them on. I laughed as we got out of the bed. Justin peeked out the door for someone, then he shook his head. I quietly snuck out and ran to my room. With I every step a said \"Ow\". This hurts! I heard Justin laugh, teasing me. I gently shut the door. Then as soon as I turned around I saw Demi staring dead at me. I half screamed then I covered my mouth. \"Hey\" she said. I shook my head and backed out of my room slowly. \"Come here Jasmine\" she said forcefully. I whinned and walked back in, then shut the door. Uh-oh ~Hour and a half later \"Ok, Demi! I get it. But I was only doing it so my memory of dad would be erased all the way, and not just a bad memory I remember from 9 years ago, I want to be able to talk about it and shrug like it means nothing anymore. I'm sorry I had sex ok. And I know I'm too young and that I shouldn't be doing these things but, Demi. I'm going to be 17 in just 4 months! You gotta cut me some slack for being 1. In the mood, and 2. Madly in love with this amazing guy. Don't tell me you're engaged to Joe and haven't lost your virginity to him\" I said. She stared at me for a second then said \"Look,this isn't about me! It's about you not getting pregnant\". \"For the billionth time WE USED PROTECTION. We knew what was gonna happen, and we knew we needed to be protected. Condom mistakes is only for no warning. I had a warning\" I said. \"Wait, he knows about dad?\" she said. I nodded at her. She sighed. \"Ok. I'm done yelling, lets just get to work\" she said grabbing my laptop and opening it. \"What work?\" I asked walking over to my drawer to get some pajamas. I was starting to feel awkward. \"My wedding dress...\" she said. My whole body stopped. DEMI WAS LETTING ME HELP HER PICK OUT HER WEDDING DRESS! \"Your letting me help!\" I screamed. She nodded. \"Remember Jazzy? Mejia?\" she asked and smiled. \"Yes!\" I yelled. \"And remember when we played vow or pow? The game where you had to vow something and if you didn't you got punched by her little boxing mit toy?\" she asked again. \"Oh yeah! And you vowed-\" she finished for me \"I'd let you help me pick out my wedding dress because you went through with my dare\" she smiled again. I squealed and ran back over to the bed, with my pj's on. We searched up for awhile and found the most beautiful dress. (in my profile) It was flowy, but flat all white and the back is very long. I'm in love with the dress we picked out! We're gonna have to show mom and the bridal party though. They'll love it too! Just then Justin entered the room. He looked suprised that Demi was here. \"Hey Justin. Heard you been swipin' cards\" she said. I snorted and looked down. \"Stop it Demi\" I said under my attempt to stop myself from laughing. \"What?\" she said then looked back at Justin. \"Ever of a V-card? Everyone gets them. Jasmine's been complaining she lost it. Did you take it?\" she asked serious. I was cracking up but silently. \"I'm pretty sure he did Demi\" I said. \"I knew it! Ok, Come on. Give it back to her...Oh wait. You can't. It's in your-\" but I stopped her before she could say another word \"Ok Demi! That's enough\". \"Look I'm sorry Demi but,\" Justin started but Demi said \"I'm over it\". Justin came in and sat next me, then grabbed my hand. After awhile I said \"Wait, I just realized something. Our next stop is San Jose' and the bus is moving. Demi your coming with us?\". She looked at me and smiled. \"Yes, I wanna see how you and Kenny Ortega's meeting goes\" she said. \"Oh. Yes!\" I say. Demi looked at me then at my chest. Her face got interested. \"Where did you get that?\" she pointed to the necklace Justin gave me. \"Justin gave it to me for our 50th anniversary of dates. Because he's the very best boyfriend ever\" I say then turn my head to kiss Justin. We kissed for about 10 seconds then Justin pulled away when he realized Demi was just glancing at us. I turned around to look at her. I smirked and said \"Sorry\". \"I'm good\" she said. I grabbed my phone and tweeted \"Never Let Love Get The Best Of You, You Should Always Try To Get The Best Of Love ;)\" They get to San Jose' and perform, and now Jasmine is meeting Kenny at \"Fahrenheit Restauruant & Lounge\" for the meeting. Demi and Justin are hiding in descise at a table far away. \"Ahh Jasmine Villegas! Man you're even more gorgeous in person! That concert was outstanding, you've gotta true talent\" Mr. Ortega said. I smiled as we hugged. \"Thank you Kenny\" I say. I had on a sparkly black dress with a flowy part on the back off it, then I had on some gray combat heels. I wanted to just be me. \"So lets order our drinks and get down to business\" he sat down. \"Ok!\" I said excited and sat down. The owner of the restaurant walked over to us. \"Good evening Mr. Ortega and Ms. Villegas, my name is Rodney, I am the owner of the restaurant. Let me just start off by saying it is an absolute honor for the both of you to be at my restaurant. Kenny my daughter loves high school musical, she has the bags, the bed, lotion, the perfume, the dolls, and all 3 dvds. That movie is glued to her head. And Jasmine...there isn't a day I've come home and 'Jealous' isn't on full blast in her room. She can't stop listening to that song. Her and her mother were just at you and Justin's concert. I can't wait to get home and hear all about it\" I smirked. \"Yea it was amazing. Your gonna get quite the mouth full\" Kenny laughed. So did Rodney. \"Why don't you give her this.\" I say and grab my napkin from off the table. \"What's her name?\" I asked. \"Lauren\" he replied. I dug in my purse and got a black marker and my un-opened new lip gloss from my lipgloss line, then on the napkin I wrote 'Dear Lauren. I hear you're a true Jasminator. Thank you so much, and remember I love you just as much as you love me. This lipgloss is to my not yet released lipgloss line . The flavor is coconut strawberry. It is absolutly delish! Hope you enjoy. Jazzy V' . Then I signed the lipgloss, wrapped the napkin around it and gave it to him. \"There you go!\" I smiled. \"Thank you Jasmine. She's gonna die when she gets this. She's been waiting for this lipgloss line for ages\" He said. I giggled. \"So what will your drinks be for tonight?\" he asked taking out his notepad. I looked at Kenny. He chestured for me to go first. \"I'll have some water\" I say. Kenny scanned the menu \"I'll have a Lychee Martini\" he said. I looked over at him quick. \"Oh no, am I driving tonight?\" I joked. Kenny and Rodney laughed. While he was still laughing, Rodney said \"Your drinks will be right out. Boy, you're as charming as you look Jasmine!\" he walked away. I giggled once more. \"So Jasmine, would you prefer a kid-ish funny role, or a more dramatic serious role?\" Kenny said when he stopped laughing. \"Well, um, I kinda decided I wanna do something my fans wouldn't expect. So you know, the goofy roles or the 'I'm perfect' roles, are what people would expect me to do. I'd perfer a more serious dramatic role. Cause it gives me that look that lets people know, I'm not just Justin Bieber's girlfriend, or that it's not all about the goody-good things I do. And that I'm serious about my singing career just as much as I am with my acting career. And that I'm sweet but I can act out a role extremely oppisite to my real personality. You see where I'm going?\" I asked. He nodded \"Yea. You'd like to also attract the adult audience, and let them know you're more than what you appear to be. From what I understand this isn't going to be your first time on screen?\" he asked. \"Uh, yea. I did a couple of minor roles before. But yea. I'd love to be the dramatic one\" I say. \"Well that's great, because we wanna turn this possible movie into a Tyler Perry teen love story\" I stopped in my position. He nodded. \"We thought it'd be a great combination of his style, and mine\" he said. I snapped back and said \"Wow...so he'd be the producer, or the director?\" I asked. \"The director. I'd be the producer\" he said. Just then Rodney walked up and gave us our drinks \"Here you are\" he sat them down \"Let me know when you're ready to order\" he walked away. I sipped my water. \"So when are the auditions?\" I asked. \"Two weeks from now\" he said. \"But I think I really like you for the leading role, because you're exactly what I pictured you as. The leading roles name is 'Misienia' but throughout the movie everyone calls her 'Missy'. I'd love it if you were Missy. Your perfect for the role\" he said. \"Well, I'll make sure I practice so they'll cast me as her!\" I smiled. He picked the menu back up. \"I think I'm getting the 'Pan Roasted Duck' \" he said. I picked the menu back up \"I want the 'Fire Grilled Hanger Steak' \" I say. The rest of the evening we talked, laughed, and ate. Kenny was quite an entertainer. His jokes were really funny. I had a good time, and I can tell he really liked me. I have a good feeling about this movie. That's what I told Justin and Demi. They felt confident too. Later that night we went for a walk. That's when I told them all about it. \"I think you're gonna get the part\" Justin stated. \"Yea. He seemed so secure about you as the lead role\" Demi added. \"Don't get your hopes up guys! Kenny said 'But it's Hollywood. Just because someone likes you doesn't mean you automatically get the role you wanted'. I took him up for that. I know this movie could shoot me way to the top, I just don't want to seem so-...s-so...\" I stopped in my words. I saw a man sitting on a park bench staring at me. He looked so familiar. Like I I've known him before. I stared at him. Deep and hard. Until he looked away. Then it came back to me. Could it be? \"Jasmine?\" Demi said waving her hand in my face. I smacked it away and looked at the man again. \"Oh my god\" I said under my breath. The man looked back over at me. He looked shocked. He got up from the bench and started to walk over. I grabbed Demi's wrist and backed away. With every step forward he made, was a step backwards I made. \"Stay away from us!\" I screamed. \"Jasmine what's-\" Demi started but ask but once she looked at the man coming this way she said \"Oh-Oh MY GOD\". She stopped for a minute. I kept pulling her but she wouldn't move. She shook her head and said \"Stay back!\". Then she turned around quickly and grabbed my arm, and as soon as she did she made a break for it, taking me with her. \"Jasmine, Demetria!\" he yelled from a distance. We kept running. We weren't staying anywhere near that man. Our father... Justin's POV I looked at Jasmine and Demi running away. Then back at the man walking over to us. Kenny walked closer to him, and blocked him. \"Get out of the way, I need to talk to my daughters!\" he yelled. \"You aren't going anywhere near those girls, do to the fact their running away from you, hey man! Stop it!\" Kenny yelled. He was trying to get past Kenny but he was failing. This is the guy that raped and abused Jasmine. Should I calm him down and lay down the law? Or should I punch him as hard as I can? I'll go with the punch. I punched him so hard, he couldn't get back up. The blood from him lip was dripping to the ground. I bent down and said \"You raped my baby. You shouldn't even be able to look at her\". Then I got up and ran away. When I got back on the bus Jasmine was crying her eyes out, holding herself, swaying back and forth wildly. Demi was crying too except she was trying to calm Jasmine down. She held Jasmine close and brushed her hair. Jasmine kept shaking her head and saying \"Don't let him hurt me again Demi, please don't let him hurt me again\". It hurt to see Jasmine like this. Just one look at her father and she's breaking down. I went over to the girls and squated down. Then I said \"Calm down girls it's gonna be ok. He's gone now\" I rubbed their legs softly. \"Justin, I, I gotta go call Joe. You..(sniff) you calm down Jasmine..O-Ok?\" she got up and quickly ran to Jasmine's room. I got up and sat next to Jasmine. I put my arm around her and 'shh'ed her. I brushed her hair away and wiped her tears. Her mascara was messed up, and sloopy. She couldn't stop crying. I held her until she fell asleep. She shivered in her sleep. I felt like going back to find that guy and doing more than punch him. He caused this. And Demi hasn't been out of the room since she left me with Jasmine. I was getting worried. Jasmine told me that Demi had cutting problems when she was younger. And she cut herself all when her dad got back, and started hitting her again. Jasmine also said Demi had an eatting disorder when she was younger. I didn't wanna wake up Jasmine, so I dug in my pocket and grabbed my phone. I dial Demi's number. She didn't answer. I got really worried, because I couldn't hear Demi on the phone or making any type of noise. Jasmine started shivering again. I started rubbing her again and saying \"Shhhh\" so she would calm down and go back to sleep. Once I was sure she was sleep, I picked her up and carried her to my room. I put the covers over her and kept the lights dim. I also left the door cracked a little so she didn't feel scared. Then I tip-toed across the bus to Jamine's room. I slightly opened up the door to see where she was. There was no blood. No still body. All I saw was Demi at the bottom of the bed watching the TV closely and smiling a little. It looked like a really old tape that was being filmed by an adult at a birthday party. There was grown people in the backround talking and kids running around with water guns. And the main thing the camera was on was two little girls. The baby, I'm guessing, was turning one and the other little girl had to be at least four. I figured it out. The 1 year old was Jasmine and the 4 year old was Demi. They looked the same. And I kinda guessed quick for Demi because she still wears glasses today. And with Jasmine, well, I've seen pictures. She was an adorable baby. You could always look into her eyes and see it was her. She's still got the same amazing smile. ~Video \"Demitra, are you gonna give your sister her present?\" Mrs. Lovato said standing next to some man. Demi looked at the guy. \"Daddy do you think she'll like it?\" she said. The guy nodded and said \"Vaya por delante la miel. She'll love it\". Then Demi wobbed over to Jasmine and handed her a doll. That doll looked familiar. \"Ha-happy birthday Jazzy\" she said. Jasmine took the doll, looked at it and smiled. Then she forced herself up and gave Demi a hug. Demi looked up at her parents shocked. Her parents looked excited. The father looked up at the camera person and said \"Dalila te va esto?\". The lady behind the camera said \"Si! Si!\". In the back I noticed there was white and black kids just running around together. I guess that's what Jasmine meant when she said She's not only Latina. She's 50% Latina, 30% white, and 20% black. The rest of the video went on and they sang happy birthday to Jasmine, then Jasmine couldn't blow out her candles so Demi did it for her. I walked into the room and sat next to her on the bed. \"Ms. Lovato was hot\" I said. Demi smiled and looked at me. \"I know right\" she said then looked back at the video. \"You scared me a little\" I said putting my hand on her knee. \"You haven't come out the room in a while. Now I see why. You were watching old videos\" I said to her. She nodded. \"I miss these days. When we were a happy family. My mom and dad loved each other so much. Me and Jasmine used to love spending time with them. Together. But once we got older my dad turned into a lunatic. They got divoriced. We moved to Dallas. He went to jail. And we never ever saw him again. It's only shocking because we thought for the rest of over our lives, we'd never see that basturd again. Who knows what he's capable of today. Jasmine is completely tramatized. I mean, who'd wanna see the person that raped them, after what 10, 9 years? I surely wouldn't\" Demi said brushing her hair back. \"He almost cracked her skull open and perminantly damaged her brain. She's still got that mark from when she was 6. He cut her upper thigh-\" \"Is that what that was?\" I asked. Since I had sex with Jasmine I know what her full exposed body looks like. When I took off her dress, and panties, hehe, then we um, let's just say I flipped her over and...yea, and when I did I saw this long scar across her thigh. I didn't say anything though. \"Yup. He got kinda pissed Jasmine ran out the house with nothing on, so he grabbed the nearest weapon and cut her. He'd been drinking\" Demi said. She inhaled sharply and exhaled smooth. \"Where is she now?\" Demi asked. \"She's in my room, under the covers, sleep\" I responded. \"Justin, Jasmine's dated a lot of guys. And I mean, a lot. But she's never acted the way she acts with you, with her other guys. She must be truely, deeply in love with you. I mean it's been 2 weeks since you guys got back together and you're stronger then ever. She had an interview with 'FairLady' Magezine and she wasn't uncomfortable talking about you. She was cool about it, she didn't get nervous, I just-I just wanna tell you that if I could pick out a guy for Jasmine, it'd definitly be you, Justin\" she smiled. I smiled back at her \"Thanks Dems\" I said. \"So what happend after we ran?\" she asked. \"I punched him\" I said wiping my nose with my thumb and looking the other way. I looked back at Demi and smirked. She smirked back at me. \"Ok, carry Jasmine back in here, I'm getting kind of tired. Plus she's spent enough time in your bed already\" Demi squinted her eyes. I smiled and got up. Before I walked out I said \"I love you Demi!\". She looked at me and rolled her eyes. Jasmine's POV I woke up in my bed, facing Demi. We were moving. We must've been on our way to Miami. I dreamt about my father. He acutally sat down and talked to me, he apoligized and told me he loved me. But there was a voice coming out of nowhere saying \"Don't Believe Him Jasmine! He's a Lie!\". I couldn't make up my mind, and then everything started turning. Next thing I knew, I was awake. It's 4:45 AM. Everyone's asleep. I knew that something like this would happen. I came prepared. I bought this thing online called Amnesia+. It's a small machine when you have to put water in the side and set the time you want to forget. So I could click the last 3 hours, the last 4 hours, the last 5 hours, and I'd forget what happend in those last hours. I thought it was amazing how it could do that. Though it came with few side effects. Cold symptoms Cough Flu-like symptoms Lower respiratory infection Shortness of breath Sore throat Stomach bleeding Stomach pain Upset Stomach (indigestion) Vomiting Serious allergic reactions Swelling of the face, lips, tongue, and/or throat Difficulty breathing Difficulty swallowing Dizziness Excessive bleeding Facial flushing Fast heartbeat Heart attack High blood pressure Increased levels of potassium Low blood pressure And finally, Fainting (syncope). See not a lot...anyways I've already put in the water and set the forget timer for 7 hours. Now I've gotta wait for 1 minute and then take it. I waited then I took the cup out and drank it. The instructions said that I had 'to take a long nap, or resume a sleeping setion. The chemicals in Amnesia+ will awaken you'. Morning Justin's POV I woke up, took a shower, and walked out to the living room where Scooter and Demi were. \"We in Miami yet?\" I said looking at my watch. Scooter looked up. \"We're close\" then he looked back at the TV. \"Still no Jasmine?\" I said and looked at Demi. \"She seemed too tired. She wouldn't budge when I shook her. So I'll just wait and see if she's still asleep when we get to Miami\" Demi said. \"Hey you guys never really explained what happend\" Lawrence walked in with coffee. We explained \"Jasmine was abused?\" Scooter said shocked. \"We both were\" Demi said. \"Wow\" Lawrence shook his head. \"Wait, you guys were out in public?\" Scooter looked up with wide eyes. \"Yea, why?\" I said. \"Justin...you guys were out in PUBLIC. I know you're not forgeting the word paparizzi!\" Scooter yanked his face. \"Shit\" Demi said under her breath. \"You know what guys? I've been down this road way too many times to be afraid now. I'll be asked about it, she'll be asked about it, Demi you'll be asked about it and then everyone'll forget about the whole thing\" I said camly. \"Justin's right\" Demi said agreeing with me. \"Everyone will get over it and stop talking about sooner then we know it\" she added. Scooter and Lawrence sat there for a second and thought. \"Ok. We agree\" Lawrence said shrugging. \"Yea you guys won't be the only ones with problems. Other celebrities will too\" Scooter said shifting in his chair. All of a sudden, Jasmine's bed room door opened. And out she came, on her phone, texting. She looked beautiful. \"Morning everyone!\" she looked up from her phone. \"Hey Jas. You doing alright?\" I asked walking up to her, resting my hands above her hips. \"I'm doing-\" she started, then pecked my lips and finished \"Great. And how are you Mr.?\" she put her hands on my shoulders. I acted a bit shocked. She was oftley happy, for what had happend last night. \"Well I guess I'm good now that I know you're okay\" I smiled and kissed her a little longer this time. She pulled away \"Why wouldn't I be okay?\" she smiled. I looked at her confused but smiling. I loved her smile. \"You know because of the whole thing with your dad..\" I said. She looked at me confused and dropped her arms. \"What whole thing with my dad?\" she all of a sudden got serious. \"The thing that happend last night\" I still had my hands on her upper hips. She stared at me for a second. \"I'm lost. What happend last night?\" she said looking at everyone. \"Jazzy we saw dad\" Demi said spaced out but worried at the same time. \"What are you guys talking about?\" Jasmine asked. We all just sat there for a second and looked at her. Why was she acting like she had no idea what we were saying? Is she trying to forget about it and in order to do that she has to act like it never happend? I'll go along with it but I've gotta ask about it someday. \"Nevermind Jas. Scooter are we here yet?\" I changed the subject. Scooter looked at both of us and blinked. Then he looked out the window. \"Kenny's parking behind the hotel now\" he said, then turned back around and looked at us again. \"Ok, we should heading out.\" Jasmine said and went into her room. We all look at each other. \"Maybe she's trying to block it out, and not bring it up\" I whispered. \"Maybe..\" Demi said. Jasmine came out with a bag. \"I've got my outfits, lets go!\" she said and opened up the bus door. We all went into our rooms and got our bags full of clothes then followed Jasmine. For some reason, I found Jasmine's outfit amazingly sexy. I hope I'll be able to get her in private, so we can do things... We got to our hotel rooms. Demi's room was connected to ours by door, and Scooter and Lawrence are across the hall. Demi said Joe was on his way up to the hotel. Him and the guys had a show here. Once we set all of our things down, me and Jasmine went to go check out our rooms. We went to her room first, which was awesome. Then we went to my room, which looked the same just a different color. While Jasmine was looking at the flat screen, I snuck up behind her and hugged her from the back. She smiled and placed her hands over mine. \"You know...now that we're alone...\" I said flirty. She turned around in my grasp and said \"JUSTIN DREW BIEBER. WE WILL NOT DO THE DO IN THIS NICE HOTEL ROOM!\" she said smiling. \"Ok..we don't have to do the do!\" I said rocking back and forth. She looked at me and smirked. \"Fine by me\" then we both leaned in a kissed. I deepend it. She deepend it more...man I'm already getting hot.

And bring Justin if you can Jasmine: Most likely Ellen: Ok hun, talk to you soon Jasmine: See ya! *taps the phone* Justin: *falls beside her* That was Ellen? Jasmine: *nods* she wants us to be on the show next Saturday Justin: Oh that's nice- *quickly resumes kissing her neck* Jasmine: *giggles* Later that night Jasmine's POV I was staring in the mirror, looking at the hickey on my neck. I was going threw my make-up bag to find some Cover and Clear, and blush, so I can cover it up. I was going out to dinner with Demi, Joe, and Justin and the last thing I need is, \"Jasmine what's that\". I wasn't mad at Justin for creating it. I actually enjoyed every second of it. I love how Justin knows how to make me go insane and he's not even trying. I love how quickly we can turn each other on. I love the way it feels when his lips touch any part of my body. I love anything about him and everything about him. I went back into my hotel room to change. I picked out a short black dress, sparkly on one side and chiffon on the other. I thought it'd be nice to have a heart theme going on. I put on a heart necklace, a heart ring, heart earrings, and a chain bracelet with two hearts on it saying 'Guess'. I finished getting dressed and took some curlers into the bathroom with me. I curled my hair and put pink strawberry lipstick on with clear gloss over it, then I put on mascara, eyeliner, eyeshadow, and blush. I finished, went back into my room to get my purse, then and walked out to the hotel living room waiting for Justin. He takes FOREVER to finish his hair. I find it unbelieveable that he cut it, but still takes a longtime doing it. I looked around and thought 'Man this place is nice'. I caught the view of myself in the mirror. I gasped and stood up. I saw my whole body including my feet. I looked hot! And tall. I wasn't really used to wearing 3 inch heels. I smiled and posed in the mirror. I went in my purse and got out my phone. I unlocked it and went to camera. Then I posed for the picture puckering my lips and putting the peace sign up. It flashed and I brung it back down and looked at it. I tapped \"Post to JasmineVillegas .com\" then I went on twitter and tweeted \"Bouta Go To The Capital Grille Restaurant In Miami With (a)ddlovato, (a)joejonas, (a)justinbieber. #LivinFancy\" then I put the link to my picture. As soon as I pushed tweet I felt to arms rap around waist from the back, then a chin rest on my shoulder. Who else would it be? It was Justin. I turned my head slightly, but not looking at him. \"Hey Sexy\" he whispered in my ear. \"Hey\" I said turing all the way around to face him. He pushed me back alittle bit. \"You look beyond beautiful\" he checked me out. He looked hot . He had on a black dress shirt with a bowtie, and some grayish pants, with high top sneakers and a purple watch. \"And you look fine \" I said wrapping my arms around his neck and pulling his lips closer to my mine. He slid his hands across my waist and folded his hands above my butt. He smiled with his teeth \"Really?\". I nodded \"Mm-hm\" and pecked his lips. \"I'm seriously attracted to you right now\" I giggled. \" Really? \" his voice got deeper. I nodded again and said \"Uh-Huh\" while leaned in and we kissed again. This time it was longer. I deepend it, he deepend it more then his hands went lower and grabbed my butt cheeks then squeezed them. I giggled in the kiss and pulled away. \"Justin stop being a perv\" I laughed. \"Can't help it, you turned me on again\" he smiled. \"Well what if Demi walked through the door just then?\" I asked and tilted my head. He shrugged and continued to kiss me. He removed his hands for my ass cheeks and went up to cup my cheeks. I pulled away and we rest our foreheads against eachothers. I looked at his lips. Oh my goodness my lipstick kind of rubbed off on him! I laughed and covered my mouth. I couldn't control my laughter when I said \"I'll go get you a paper towel babe\". Then a speed walked into the kitchen. I looked back at him, and he was looking in the mirror gasping. I giggled and kept walking. Once I got the paper towel I went back into the living room finding half of it already off due to him being impatient and rubbing it off with the back of his hand. He only just put it on his hand. And then he sat down and started licking \"Here, let me help you\" I bent down and rubbed it off for him. \"Is this strawberry?\" he asked licking his lips. \"Yea?\" I nodded. He but his head back and said \"Lick it off\". I smiled at him with my doubty face. \"Justin why are you being so dirty?\" I said. \"Because you look HOT\" he smiled with his teeth again. \"But what if Demi and Joe-\" \"The Door's locked\" he said already knowing what I was going to say. \"What about the other-\" \"Locked it\" he said and grabbed my knees, then kind of spread them apart. He pulled me down to sit on his lap frontwords. I smirked at him. He smiled. \"Go ahead\" he said so seductive and soft. I stuck my tounge out and lightly licked around his lips about 5 times, then I stroked both of his lips up and down. He slid his hands up and down my thighs while I did it. I smiled at him looking him deep in the eyes. When I finished I sucked his lips one at a time. Then I looked at him with my 'satisfied' face. He kissed me and pulled away and said \"Oops I put it back on\". I narrowed my eyes. \"You did that on purpose!\" I bunched up my lips. \"You can't prove it\" he shook his head. \"Oh well\" I shrugged and scrubbed his lips. He kept backing away and moving his face. I laughed while he did. \"What you get!\" I said. \"See now I gotta redo my makeup\" I kissed him on the cheek and got up. I dug in my purse and got out a wet wipe. I wiped off the last bit of it on my lips and put on the lipstick and the gloss again. Justin placed his hands on my hips and rested his chin on my shoulder again. Then he started pecking at my neck. \"Hey, hey, hey calm it down little boy, I've already got one hickey\" I jokingly nagged. \"I'm sorry you're just so attractive\" he continued kissing my neck. I breathlessly giggled. Then Demi and Joe knocked on the door. We both turned and walked to the door. ","Summary":" You Broke My Heart Hey guys!

One Disclaimer: I don't own anything except my OCs,and the fact that Jenko and Schmidt are brothers in my fics. And remember, Turn Your Head And Cough! ***MetroCity Medical School*** Two security guards stand in front of two glass doors which lead to the campus cafeteria. \"I've said it before and I'll say it again... THIS IS BS! \" screamed Schmidt. \"Bro,calm down.\" Jenko said to his new brother. \"No! I don't wanna calm down. You wanna know why? Because the same thing that happened before happened again.\" Schmidt replied \"What are you talking about? We're just two kick ass handsome cops who're on their next job.\" \"We're two cops who got tricked...twice!\"Schmidt said loudly They were so into the argument that they didn't notice the cafeteria doors open and hitting both of them in the face. As they regained their composure,they noticed three Asian students standing under a tree smoking. Two males and one female. \"Hey Jenk,you see what I see?\"Schmidt asked pointing towards the students. \"Yep,let's do this, bro!\" Jenko replied as they ran towards the tree. Once they reached the tree,the trio of students froze in their tracks. \"Hey kids,how's y'all's day going?\" Jenko asked in a fake casual voice. \"Um...fine,\" the female said.\" \"This is a great School,huh?\"Schmidt said to which they nodded,\"Did you read the catalogue for this school.\" \"Yeah,I did.\"said the one with big spikey hair. \"Well did you read the fine print,where it said that smoking on or within a two block radius of campus is strictly prohibited!\"said Jenko sternly. And at that,the trio took of running in three different directions. Fortunately with being in this kind of situation before,Jenko and Schmidt pursued the students. Schmidt chased after the girl and Jenko ran after the kid with spikey hair. Surprisingly for someone his weight,and due to his new workout schedule with Jenko,Schmidt was actually able to keep up with the girl. He finally cornered her at a wall which she kept on running towards. When it looked like she was about to run into the wall,she actually ran up the wall,flipped over Schmidt's head and landed gracefully on her feet. Schmidt stood there mouth agape,stunned at what he had just seen. Meanwhile Jenko,still chasing Mr. Spikes,(A/N:That's a little named I picked out for him. Hope you like it.)had finally gotten close enough to apprehend him. Which he did by leaping off of a bench and landing right on Mr. Spikes' back. \"You have the right to suck my dick,pal!\"Jenko yells victoriously \"Thats-a not the correct-a rights!\"Mr. Spikes whined \"Well that's what I'm saying,I'll say the real right when my partner gets he-,speak of the devil there he is now.\"Jenko said seeing Schmidt running towards them. \"Hey Jenk!\"Schmidt screamed while bending over panting. \"You ok bro?\"Jenko asked \"Yeah...Just had a girl flip over me,had my stomach and nuts kicked in,\"Schmidt replied,\"You read'em his rights yet?\" \"Nope,not yet. Wanna do it with me?\"Jenko asked with a mischievous smile. \"Hell yeah I do!\"Schmidt replied happily \"YOU ARE UNDER ARREST! YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT! ANYTHING YOU SAY WILL BE HEL-\" They were interrupted by the sound of a gunshot. They turn towards it to find the girl Schmidt chased pointing a gun to the sky. She then smiled and said,\"Til next time,boys.\" After that,she ran off campus. Suddenly a mini cloud of smoke blinded both Jenko and Schmidt. But when the smoke cleared,they saw that Mr. Spikes was gone. \"This is bad.\"Jenko stated \"Yeah,the Deputy Chief isn't gonna be happy about this.\"Schmidt added So what do you think of 23 Jump Street so far?\" Please like and review and stay tuned for the next chapter. Ninja-Boy out! ![Chapter 3] Heyo everybody! I'm not dead and I'm not done writing. I've just been taking some time off,but I'm back now and I'm better than ever.

One Disclaimer: I don't own anything except my OCs,and the fact that Jenko and Schmidt are brothers in my fics. And remember, Turn Your Head And Cough! *MetroCity Police Department(Deputy Chief Hardy's Office)* It was once again quiet in Hardy's office as he looked back and forth between Jenko and Schmidt. He just stared at them with his usual deadpanned look. \"Why can't you two just be like normal cops?\"he asked \"Because we're not normal,sir. We're jus-\"Jenko tried to say but was cut off.\" \"It was rhetorical question, Jenko.\"Silence once again filled the room. It wasn't until he saw Schmidt holding a Ziploc bag of ice on the private area of his pants that Hardy broke the silence again. \"Schmidt,why are you icing your testicles?\"he asked in his deadpanned voice. \"Oh um...I was chasing my perp and confronted her,and then I-\" Schmidt replied, but he too was cut off. \"Did you just say \"her\"?\" Hardy asked,\"Was your perp a girl,Schmidt?\" \"Yes,sir,\" Schmidt said,\"She was a Chinese girl. And as I said, I had her cornered,but she ran up the wall,flipped,landed behind me. And when I turned around,she kicked in my genitals and my stomach... Sir.\" \"Look,I don't have to tell you about the last case you did.\" Hardy said,\"So I'm just gonna say it...Get back to Jump Street.\" ***23 Jump Street Condominiums*** \"What did I tell you, bro?\"Jenko said with grin \" Shut the f*** up ,\" Schmidt replied, \"You don't have to rub it in.\" As they walked inside,they noticed that their surroundings were very fancy/expensive. \"Damn!\"Schmidt exclaimed,\" It must've caused the department a sh*t ton of money to rent a place in here.\" \"Hi we're here to see Captain Dixon,\" Jenko said as they walked up to the front desk. \" \"I beg your pardon?\" The desk clerk askeb(A/N:The Desk Clerk is played by Ken Jeong.) \"I'm Officer Jenko McQuaid and this my brother Officer Schmidt McQuaid.\" \"Hold up, your partner is also your brother?\" \"Yeah\" \"That's cool. I know two cops who are partners, but they're also brothers-in-law.(A/N:Ride Along 2) \"Cool what's your name?\" Jenko asked \"Oh I'm AJ,\" \"Nice to meet you, AJ.\"Schmidt said as they shook hands,\"But we really need to find Captain Dickson.\" \"Can I ask why?\" \"Well,we're part of a rebooted 80's police program young looking officers. We're part of the Metropolitan Jump Street Division!\" Schmidt stated \"Wait,you guys are Jump Street,\" AJ asked,\"Why didn't you say so! Go down the hall,get in the elevator on the left and you'll know what button to push.\" \"Ok, thanks AJ!\" Jenko said \"See ya AJ!\" Schmidt said \"No prob,guys!\" When the two brocops walked into the elevator, they saw an assortment of buttons. But one stood out from the rest. It was labeled \" 23JPSTPD \". \"Well AJ was right. The button really stands out.\" Jenko said \"Personally, I think it's too conspicuous.\" Schmidt replied pushing the button \"I don't think it is a bit much\" Jenko retorted as the elevator doors closed. What do you guys think of the new set chapter of 23 Jump Street? More will be coming this week,so stay tuned and please review. Reviews = Motivation Motivation = More Chapters and stories. By the way, did anybody notice Men Jeong's cameo as AJ from Ride Along 2 in here? I'll be making more cameos in my Jump Street fics. Until Next Chapter,Ninja-Boy Out! ✌[Chapter 4] Heyo everybody! I'm not dead and I'm not done writing. I've just been taking some time off,but I'm back now and I'm better than ever. I've been getting lots of reviews and requests to continue Stranded Geniuses,so I'll continue that one next after this chapter so keep your shirts on. Since 22 Jump Street came out two years after 21 Jump Street,I decided to make my own sequel. So please sit back,relax,and enjoy 23 Jump Street: Medical School. One Disclaimer: I don't own anything except my OCs,and the fact that Jenko and Schmidt are brothers in my fics. Also,I decided to make my Jump Street Fics a bit more suitable for kids and teens. So they're gonna be rated PG-13! And remember, Turn Your Head And Cough! Once the elevator doors opened,Jenko and Schmidt were amazed at how large this place was. There were multiple rooms and hundreds of employees with logos on their shoulders which read,\" JS Police Department,\" with the JS on top and the Police Department on the bottom,with the Police part on top of Department label. The walls were painted a bright shade of blue with a red trim. And right in the middle of it all was a big glass office for Dickson,just like the previous department. As the brocops looked up they saw Him standing up looking down at them. \"Hey everybody,\"Dickson said trying to get everyone's attention to which nobody answered, \"HEY!\" Everyone looked at him after that. \"Let's welcome back Jump Street's two best officers,Jenko and Schmidt!\" The whole department was filled with applause and cheers. \"Alright,'dats enough. Everybody back to work!\"Dickson said. And they all did. \"Welcome back to Jump Street,punks!\" \"Hey Cap,it's good to see you,\"Jenko said shaking the captain's hand \"Back at you,Jenko,\"Dickson said returning the handshake,then turning towards Schmidt,\"Now you,I'm still upset with you about what you did to Maya,but like I said,Imma let dat be da past.\" \"Thank You,sir.\"Schmidt said with a sigh of relief. ***Dickson's Office*** The three cops walk into Dickson's office and sat down. Once Jenko sat down,he started laughing. Then his laugh began to build up from a normal human laugh to an annoying hyena laugh. \"Dude,what're you laughing at?\"Schmidt asked \"It's just that,(haha)the last time we were in the Captain's office, he tased in the nuts after,(hahahahahaaaa)after he found out that you banged his daughter!\" \"Jenko,if you don't stop laughin',these cashews ain't gonna be the only nuts roasted in this office!\"Dickson said pointing to a container of cashews on his desk. And with that,Jenko stopped laughing immediately. \"Now let's get down to business,\"Dickson said hand them two case files labeled: VCR,\"There's a new drug out,as usual,but it's different from the others.\" \"How's it different?\"Schmidt asked looking at the case file. \"Because doctors are making them.\"Dickson replied Jenko was looking at the file and found the name VCR again and found it peculiar that it kept appearing. \"Cap,what does the VCR stand for,\"He asked,\"Are they smuggling the drugs in VCRs?\" \"No dummy! VCR is the acronym for the drug,Vercurelax. Vecuronium Bromide mixed with Lidocaine. It stops pain so that you can relax,then it nums you're whole body with pain to the point of death.\" Jenko and Schmidt's eye went wide as they looked at each other. \"Now as far as we know,\"Dickson continued,\"A man named Hank Douglas was injured in a car accident and was given a dose of this. He was dead within 15 minutes of injection.\" Jenko and Schmidt saw the picture of a man with chocolate brown hair and green eyes,who was obviously Hank and a woman who must've been his wife with blonde hair and blue eyes. \"And that's his wife,Shina Douglas. She was found OD'd in their apartment two days after her husband died.\" \"So what do we do?\"Jenko asked \"We been searching for the source of VCR and we tracked it to HMS( Harvard Medical School )in Boston,Massachusetts.\" \"We're going to Boston?\"Schmidt asked \"Yep,\"Dickson said \"As students right?\"Schmidt asked again \"No,as lunch ladies,\"Dickson replied sarcastically,\"Of course as students,man. God Damn!\" \"Sorry sir,\"Schmidt apologized \"And Jenko,\" \"Yes sir?\" \"No relationships with the teachers,got it?\" \"Yes sir!\" \"Now you two know the drill. Infiltrate the dealer,Find the supplier.\"Dickson said. So how's it going so far? For those of you who don't know,Vecuronium is used to paralyze a man and stop his or her breathing, in conjunction with a sedative and potassium chloride to stop his heart. I had to learn a lot of studying for this so I hope you guys like it. Til next chapter,Ninja-Boy out![Chapter 5] Hey everybody! I'm back again with another chapter! Sorry it took so long,but I had to do a lot of research on medicine,different types of drugs and what they can do,and on Harvard Medical School,just so it can be as accurate as possible for you guys. Also it can be awesome as it was in the movies. So anyway,here the next chapter. The ride to HMS was nice,considering it was in an SUV. And the fact that they weren't even driving. They had a Chauffeur! Since they had given the department a good reputation,the government had given Jump Street carte blanche once again,(which is why they were able to afford a condo as an office). And since they had carte blanche,Dickson had rented them a guesthouse near campus. The SUV slowed down and stopped in front of a Light Blue House with a red trim and a red door. The porch was laden with plants and had a porch swing on the left side of the door. And it was adressed 2357 \"This is the guesthouse that we're staying in?\"Jenko asked out loud. \"Apparently,\"Schmidt replied,\"But you gotta admit it's pretty generous of the government to give us carte blanche again.\" \"Yeah. And even more so for Dickson to set this up for us.\" \"Can't argue with that,bro.\" \"Well let's go in.\"Jenko said As the brocops walked in,they took in the beauty of the house. The living room was completely furnished with a couch,a recliner,and a 43\" plasma TOSHIBA TV. The kitchen was even better,with it's pantry and refrigerator,both of which were completely stocked with food. \"Oh,this is sOOoo tight!\"Jenko said excitedly \"You said it,man.\"Schmidt said in agreement,\"Now let's go unpack.\" ***Six Hours Later*** After a long tie of unpacking,settling in,and naming all their things(including all the new gadgets they were given),the brocops decided to go over their ID's. (Schmidt)\"Ok, now just to recap, I am-\" (Jenko)\"-My little brother,Doug MqQuaid.\" (Schmidt)\"And you are-\" (Jenko)\"You big brother,Brad MqQuaid.\" \"Correct! You got it,Jenk,\"Schmidt confidently,\"Well I think we should get some shuteye,we have a big day tomorrow.\" \"Ok.\"Jenko replied ***Later That Night*** The night had been nice and quiet for the past two hours. However,unlike Schmidt,Jenko hadn't slept a wink. His brain had been racked all night,scared of what could happen tomorrow. \"Hey Schmidt\"he called Schmidt stirred a bit,but didn't answer. \"Hey Schmidt,you awake?\"he called again. \"Yeah\"Schmidt replied groggily. \"Sorry,bro. It's just that something's been bothering me.\"Jenko said. \"What's up,bro?\"Schmidt asked more aware and awake. \"Well it's the fact that the last two times we did this,something happened to one of us that pulled us apart.\"Jenko explained. \"Oh well,don't worry about it,man. I promise nothing is gonna break us apart this time.\" Schmidt said comforting his brother. \"Thanks,Schmidt.\" \"No problem,Jenko.\" \"Good Night,\"Jenko said closing his eyes. \"Good Night,\"Schmidt said smiling. With the horrible thought out of his head,with the help of his new brother,Jenko was finally able to get some sleep. And with that,the brocops slept peacefully,unbeknownst to what the day had planned for them tomorrow. So there's the 4th chapter. FYI,the 2357 adresses is a reference to the title 23 Jump Street. On a phone dialpad ,the 5 stands for a \"J\",and the 7 stands for the \"S\",so 2357 (aka 23 Jump Street). See you guys later![Chapter 6] Hey guys! I'm back with another chapter. It's gonna be Jenko and Schmidt's first interaction's with the people at HMS. So,classic first day sit Back,relax,and enjoy the chapter. BEEP!BEEP!BEEP!BEEP!BEEP!BEEP!BEEP! The blaring sound of the alarm clock caused Jenko to slowly open his eyes and lift his head. He rubbed his eyes and looked around until he found the clock,picked it up and threw it at the wall. The noise made Schmidt jerk up. \"What the hell was that?\"he asked. \"That was the alarm clock,\"Jenko replied in a groggy voice,\"I had to turn it off.\" \"Oh,okay.\"Schmidt said before retreating back under the covers. ***Bathroom*** The two bro-cops were in the bathroom,brushing their teeth while reciting the Miranda Rights. \"Anything you say can and will be held against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you can not afford an attorney,one will be appointed to you.\" \"Glad you finally can remember The Miranda Rights,Jenk.\"Schmidt said complimenting his brother. \"Thanks bro.\" \"Okay so first day at medical school,how're gonna play this out,Jenk? One-strap or two-strap?\"Schmidt asked \"Well just for the novelty of it,let's two-strap it.\"Jenko replied flipping his backpack on. \"Alright.\" \"Hey do you know when our interview is?\"Jenko asked \"Um,it's at 10:30. And it's at 11:00.\"Schmidt said \"I don't think we're gonna make in time.\" \"Don't worry. We'll make it.\" So with their backpacks on,the brothers headed downstairs. \"How're we supposed to make to the campus in time with only 30 minutes?\"Jenko aksed \"Well,since the department has carte blanche,I asked the Captain to get you something.\"Schmidt said notifying his brother. \"Oh yeah,what is it?\"Jenko asked again \"Go look outside and find out.\" When they went outside,Jenko's jaw dropped. What he saw before them was a canary yellow Lamborghini. Shrieking like a 3-year-old school girl,Jenko ran towards his dream car.\"IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL!\"He said in high-pitched voice while hugging the Lambo. \"Yep,and it's all yours.\" \"Nah bro,this is too nice. This is our new car,\"Jenko said as he started crying,\"I love you,Schmidt\". He said that with so much happiness that he skidded across the hood and picked Schmidt up and hugged. \"Love ya too,Jenk. Now let's get going. You ready to drive her?\" \"Hell yeah!\" So they got in and sped off to the campus.[Chapter 7] p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 24px; font-size: 18px; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 24px; padding: 0px; color: #555555;\"I wanna start by saying that I LOVED the first two movies.

Finn smirked a little. \"Actually, make it three.\" Joe obliged his request. \"No, two. Two is perfect.\" \"You wanna make up your mind?\" Joe called up to him. \"What is it, two, three, or four?\" \"Exactly.\" \"You know I'm gonna hurt you, right?\" Finn laughed at his friend's annoyance. \"Two.\" \"Thank you.\" Tess smiled from her computer. She loved listening to Joe and Finn's banter. It never failed to be entertaining. \"Guys,\" Pete called coming into the room with his tablet. \"Joe, you gotta check this out, man.\" \"Yo,\" Joe said as he walked over to the boy. \"Monarch's on fire. Tess, you too.\" Tess took her computer off her lap and joined the others watching Monarch's latest webcast. \"Cretin, go ahead,\" the man said to a caller. \"Monarch, this is Darryl from East Orange,\" the caller said angrily. \"Why would you let a redneck trust fund baby into the De Leon? He doesn't deserve to be in a winner-takes-all race with multi-million-dollar cars! Come on, Monarch!\" Monarch sighed and rolled his eyes. \"Caller? Do I get to talk?\" Darryl continued his rant on the phone while Monarch tried desperately to get a word in. \"Darryl, have your parents ever smacked you upside the head? See, this is a case where sometimes you just need to beat kids. Darryl, Darryl, it's my show. I get—Shut up!\" Darryl finally stopped talking. \"Listen to me! Darryl, one important question. Have you ever even driven a race car? That's what I thought.\" He pushed a button, and Crazy Darryl was gone. \"Let me explain to all of you people out there how this works one more time. It's my race. It's the De Leon. I created it. It's rarefied air, kids. It's beautiful. I decide who gets in and who does not get into the race, okay?\" Benny came barreling into the garage from the paint room where he had been spray-painting a new car red. \"What y'all talking about?\" He looked over Pete's shoulder at the tablet to watch Monarch continue his show. \"The Flyin' Hawaiian just took down Steve Heavy Chevy in the Arizona desert.\" \"Tobey could easily beat those guys,\" Tess remarked. \"We all know it.\" \"You got that right!\" Pete smiled. \"…an invitation as a wild card,\" Monarch continued. \"Okay? That's important. Wild card. Maybe. I'm not saying he's in, I'm saying he might be.\" \"Alright, I've heard enough,\" Tess sighed. \"If Monarch knew what was good for him, he would let Tobey race in a heartbeat.\" The boys smiled as everyone went back to their work stations. Tess held out her bag to Finn. \"Gummy worm? They're the sour kind,\" she said in a singsong voice. Finn took one from the bag. \"Do you ever eat any other kind?\" \"Depends on what project I'm working on and how desperate I am.\" She pulled out another gummy worm. \"Here, catch.\" She tossed the gummy worm to Finn, and he managed to catch it in his mouth. \"Ooh, nice one! Now do me.\" Finn took out a gummy worm from the bag, and Tess opened her mouth to catch it. When Finn threw it, it hit her cheek and fell on the ground. \"That was a terrible throw!\" she laughed. \"You're just mad you missed!\" Tess laughed as she headed to the entrance of the garage to find the leader of the team. \"Tobey!\" she called. \"You ready for the race tonight?\" \"As ready as I'll ever be,\" he smiled at her. \"You got your programs all good and ready?\" \"Never leave home without them. Prize is supposed to be pretty good tonight.\" \"So I've heard.\" \"You've got it in the bag.\" \"I'm glad you think so highly of me.\" \"Of course I do, Big Bro.\" Tess had been a part of the team for around three years. She hardly ever worked on the cars, but Tess was a valuable asset to the team in that she was an incredible hacker. Tess had computer skills that the other boys could never even dream of having. Give her a computer and she could do almost anything. Most of the time, she used her programs to figure out the best way to modify the cars they were given that Tobey would use to race. Other times, she could hack into other places and computers and find out what exactly their competition was. Similar to how Pete and Tobey considered each other brothers, they also considered Tess a sister. Tess came in the middle: older than Pete but younger than Tobey. She loved them even more than family and would do anything for them. When it came to her and Finn, they had been shamelessly flirting with each other for the better part of the last three years, but nothing had ever come of it. Their relationship never advanced past 'friends who flirted', even though everyone teased them about it. That night, the team drove down to Mt. Kisco Drive-In where the latest race was taking place. Tobey pulled up with Finn, making sure to let all the girls admire his latest race car. Pete got up off the hood of his own car. \"Tobey,\" he smiled. \"Pete,\" Tobey smiled back as he got out of the car. \"You good?\" \"Good.\" \"Are you ready?\" \"Yeah.\" \"You know, Monarch gave you a shout-out,\" Benny told Tobey. \"Then he crapped on your car.\" \"Yeah, I know, I heard,\" Tobey said dryly. \"Never mind that,\" Pete said as he put his hand on his shoulder. \"While Monarch was talking about you, I had a vision.\" \"All right, here we go,\" Finn remarked as he rolled his eyes. \"Quiet, okay?\" Benny smiled. \"I happen to like his visions. Pete, proceed, please.\" \"I see water, and the sun, and—\" \"Your sister in a bikini,\" Finn interrupted. Tess rolled her eyes as the other boys laughed. \"Shut it. I see Tobey looking at a lighthouse. I see you, and you're gonna win De Leon.\" \"Really?\" \"Hey,\" Tobey said to Pete. \"Thanks for the vote of confidence, Petey, but I got my hands full trying to beat Jimmy Macintosh and you tonight, so…\" \"Jimmy Macintosh isn't in the right head space tonight,\" Tess told the guys. \"Fight with his girlfriend going on. Shouldn't be too hard to beat him.\" Tobey chuckled a little. How that girl managed to hack into all those peoples' computers, he still didn't know. He was a little wary of her digging into people's personal lives, but she had told him that she didn't go digging any farther than necessary. Now whether that was actually true … All of their heads turned as a car approached the drive-in with two very familiar people inside. \"Oh, man,\" Pete said quietly. \"My sister and Dino are here. She didn't tell me she was coming home, guys. I'm sorry.\" Tobey and Tess stared at the two people stepping out of the car. \"No, it's fine.\" \"Coming with Dino isn't,\" Joe said, looking over at Tess. \"What's this fool even doing back here, man?\" Benny asked. \"Maybe he just came to watch how a real racer drives,\" Finn joked. \"The guy raced Indy,\" Tobey said. \"It doesn't get more real than that, Finn.\" Tess scoffed. \"Oh, please. You can drive circles around him, and we all know it.\" Pete's sister/Dino's fiancée, Anita, started to walk over to them. \"Let's go, Tobey. You don't need that distraction.\" \"No, it's fine.\" Benny looked at his watch. \"All right, boys, the race is gonna start soon.\" \"Ben, you should head up,\" Joe said. \"I just wanna let you know I'm going because I want to and not because you told me to. Just know that.\" \"Okay. Way to put your foot down, Benny.\" Everyone laughed as Benny, Joe, and Finn walked off to prepare for the upcoming race. \"Hey, give me a second,\" Tess said to Joe and Finn. She walked over to Anita and tightly hugged her. \"Hey, Anita.\" \"Hi, Tess,\" Anita smiled. \"It's really good to see you again. You look wonderful.\" \"Thank you. You do too. I hope it's not awkward with Dino here…\" Tess smiled to mask the disdain she felt for Dino. \"Not at all.\" \"Oh my Lord, Tess, you're taking forever!\" Finn said as he came up behind her and picked her up. \"Finn!\" she shouted. \"I was talking!\" \"I know, and we need to go get ready!\" \"I guess I'll see you later, Anita!\" Anita smiled and waved to her. \"Okay, put me down!\" she ordered. They both laughed as they arrived at Joe's truck, AKA The Beast. Tess looked back at Dino who was signing autographs. \"I can't believe I used to date that guy.\" \"Why did you even date that guy?\" Finn asked. \"I ask myself that every day.\" Tess really liked Anita and considered her to be one of her best friends. Dino, however, was another story. She had dated him a couple years ago before he got engaged to Anita. Looking back, it had been one of the stupidest decisions of her life. Dino only cared about two things: winning and money. She'd tried to tell Anita that, but the girl wasn't convinced. Tess secretly wished that Anita and Tobey would get back together, but it didn't look like that was going to happen any time soon. They all drove down to the finish line and set up their equipment for the upcoming race. Joe called up Tobey on his cell phone. \"How are you feeling?\" he asked. \"Good,\" Tobey answered. \"Have you got the roads locked down?\" \"The road is clear. We are at the finish line, and Benny is in the Cessna.\" Joe hung up the phone and took out his walkie-talkie. \"Liar One, you standing by?\" Benny groaned from inside his plane. \"Ah, here we go with this again.\" \"I wouldn't have to use that handle if you stopped telling people you flew Apache helicopters.\" \"I took an Apache for a joyride, okay? That's all I said.\" \"I know that's what you said. We just don't believe you.\" \"Hey, man, look, just because I'm a crew chief doesn't mean I don't know how to fly. You gotta have guts of titanium alloy to do what I do. So I need a little respect. A little R-E-S-P-E-C-T.\" \"All right, enough messing around. What's the status…Liar One?\" Finn and Tess looked at each other as they laughed. \"Clear,\" Benny said unamused. \"And this is 'Maverick'. Call me Maverick, or I will kamikaze this into your fat head.\" Finn and Tess put on their headsets so they could hear Tobey and Benny. Finn set up everything on the screen on the side of the Beast while Tess readied everything on her computer. During each race, Tess recorded various racing tidbits that they could use in future races. If one part of a car worked better than another, she wanted to remember that and let Tobey know so he could fix up another car with that part. She also liked to make notes of things Tobey and Pete did well and things they could improve on. Dino walked up to the two of them. \"Mind if I watch?\" He looked over at his ex-girlfriend. \"Tess.\" \"Dino.\" Finn awkwardly stood between them as the tension in the air thickened to a point where he really wished he could be absolutely anywhere else. There was rarely a time where Finn couldn't lighten the room with a small quip, but this was one of those times. Joe joined them as the racers formed at the starting line. The videos on the front of Tobey's and Pete's cars were working perfectly. The passing train blew its horn and the race began.[Chapter 2] \"Okay, gentlemen, please be advised, I got traffic ahead. Repeat, I got traffic ahead,\" Benny's voice came across their headsets. The four of them watched the video on the Beast as all of the racers weaved in and out of traffic in order to be the victor of the night. \"That was close,\" Dino remarked after witnessing Tobey's close call with another vehicle. \"He got lucky.\" \"It's not luck,\" Joe answered. \"He's patient.\" Dino looked over at Tess and she raised her eyebrows with a smug look on her face. She knew that Tobey was a better driver than Dino, and deep down, he knew it too. For someone in a major fight with his girlfriend, Jimmy Macintosh actually really had it going tonight. He was in the lead for a good majority of the race with Pete behind him and Tobey coming in last. After many twists and turns throughout alleys and garages, Tobey managed to squeeze past Pete. Tobey rounded a corner right behind Jimmy and ended up nearly running over a homeless man. The man got out of the way just in time, but his shopping cart was a goner. \"Benny!\" Tobey yelled from his car. Benny laughed. \"You bodied that guy's grocery cart.\" Tobey was neck and neck with Jimmy now. He was almost at the finish line. Tobey went through the exit of the last tunnel while Jimmy went through the entrance. Tobey gunned the gas and managed to come out just before Jimmy did. \"Yes!\" Tess screamed excitedly. \"Whoo!\" Finn cheered. Tess happily hugged Finn as they cheered for Tobey's victory. \"Sweet!\" Benny said from inside his plane. \"Hey, yo, Father Joseph, make sure you save me a beer, buddy. Hello?\" \"Relax, Liar One,\" Tess laughed. \"We'll save you a beer.\" \"That's not funny, Tess.\" \"I find it hilarious.\" Tess ran up to Tobey as he stepped out of the car. She happily jumped on him and hugged him. \"Great win, Big Bro!\" \"Thanks, Little Sis.\" The group all went back to the garage to celebrate Tobey's victory. Tobey pulled out a few cans of beer and everyone clinked cans before taking small sips. \"That's what we do!\" Joe exclaimed as he fist-bumped everyone. \"That's right. Benny, my man.\" \"I thought you had him, brother,\" Tobey said quietly to Pete. \"Nah, I had him in the turns.\" \"Where were you?\" Joe asked Benny. \"We missed you, brother, we missed you.\" \"What do you mean?\" Benny replied. \"I was flying, watching your butts.\" \"You were flying?\" \"Flying?\" Tobey asked in mock surprise. \"I didn't see him flying.\" \"Y'all gonna play me like that?\" Benny asked, unamused. \"I didn't see him flying,\" Finn said. \"Did you see him flying?\" Joe asked Tess. \"Nope, I didn't see him flying. \"Maybe you should ask the shopping cart guy if he saw you flying up there,\" Tobey said coyly. \"OHH!\" everyone laughed in unison. \"Shots fired!\" Benny laughed. \"Boom, boom! So I'm supposed to watch out for cops, fly the plane, make sure you got a clear lane, and look out for homeless people coming out of the shadows?\" \"Yes,\" Tess answered bluntly. \"I didn't get that memo, I'm sorry.\" Their heads turned as a familiar car pulled up to the garage. Everyone's smiles quickly disappeared as Dino got out of the driver's seat and began approaching the group. \"He has a lot of nerve showing up here,\" Tess muttered. \"Nice driving,\" Dino said to Tobey. \"I'm impressed. Tobey Marshall. The man to beat in Mount Kisco.\" He sighed as Tobey got up from his chair to face him. \"Sorry about your old man. I know you were close.\" \"You, uh, lost, Dino?\" Tobey asked coldly. \"What?\" \"I mean, I haven't seen you around for a long time. I figured, you know, you must be lost.\" \"So, nothing has changed. After 10 years, you wanna just pick up some locker room fight.\" \"What do you want?\" \"I wanna see you build a real car.\" \"I got plenty of cars to build, Dino.\" Dino took a look around the garage smugly. \"Yeah. How's that going for you?\" Tobey took an angry step forward, but Dino held his hand out. \"I didn't come to insult you. I came to make a business proposition. It could be a game-changer for you.\" \"Are you handing out dreams now, Dino?\" Pete asked with a suave smile. \"I've seen a hundred custom racing shops since I left this town. I still haven't seen work as good as yours.\" Tobey gestured to his friends behind him. \"That's these guys. Not me.\" \"I have a very special car that needs to be finished.\" \"What kind of car are we talking about?\" Joe asked. \"Ford Mustang.\" Joe raised his eyebrows. \"A Mustang?\" \"Ooh,\" Finn said sarcastically. Dino looked at him pointedly. \"It's the one Ford and Carroll Shelby were building when Carroll died.\" Tess's eyes widened a little as they all glanced at one another. The Carroll Shelby? His car? \"How did you get it?\" Tobey asked. \"Mr. Shelby and my uncle, they were close,\" Dino told him. \"You finish building my Mustang like you rebuilt that Gran Torino, I'll give you a quarter of what we get for the car.\" Pete went up next to Tobey. \"A quarter?\" \"The car is worth 2 million. Minimum. That's $500,000 in your pocket. Forget about the past, Tobey, hmm? It's history. I'm here to make peace.\" Tess raised her eyebrows a little, knowing full well that sentence wasn't over. \"And money.\" There it was. \"Don't answer me now. Just think about it.\" Dino started to leave the garage. \"I don't need to think about it,\" Tobey said. \"I'll do it.\" \"I'll get the car here tomorrow,\" Dino said without turning around. He got back into his car and drove away from the garage. Benny watched Dino drive away and then turned back to Tobey. \"Okay, um, I just wanna be the first to take the floor here and ask you, have you lost your mind? You're gonna have us work for Dino Brewster? Word?\" \"What are you thinking, Tobey?\" Joe asked. \"You don't wanna have anything to do with that piece of crap.\" \"I gotta second with Joe on this one,\" Tess added. \"And, look, if this is about Anita, trying to get her back or something, do it another way, homie,\" Benny continued. \"Write a poem or something. Okay? I'll help you out. 'Dear Anita, nothing is sweeter than Anita. I really a-need-a…Anita.\" Tess snapped her fingers as they all laughed. \"And I just came up with that just now. Just now!\" Finn came up to Tobey with his usual smirk. \"Yo, forget about that fool and his turtleneck. All right? Just tell him you're out. We're doing fine without him.\" \"We're not,\" Tobey said quietly. \"Okay. We're not doing fine.\" \"What are you talking about?\" Tess asked. Tobey awkwardly rubbed the back of neck as he walked a few feet away from them. \"Um…look, uh…I'm behind on the loan. That guy from earlier…that guy is from the bank. And he's just gonna keep coming back.\" \"Tobey, why didn't you tell me?\" Tess said. \"I've got some money saved up that I could give you.\" Everyone in the group gave her a pointed look. She rolled her eyes at them. \"No, I did not hack to get it. Geez, you guys don't give me any credit.\" Pete stood up and looked at the man he considered a brother. \"Tobey, if you say we need him, then I'm with you.\" \"Wait,\" Finn interjected. \"We made five grand tonight.\" \"It's gotta be enough to make the payment,\" Joe added. \"What about next month?\" Tobey said desperately. \"We'll figure it out. We always do.\" \"This time, it's different, okay?\" He walked back over and picked up his jacket. \"If you guys don't show up tomorrow to work on that car, we're gonna lose this place.\" They all watched Tobey leave the garage dejectedly. \"Hey, come on, guys,\" Pete told them. \"This is Carroll Shelby. This is an opportunity of a lifetime.\" \"We're doing this,\" Joe said. \"All right? For Tobey.\" \"Agreed,\" Tess put in. \"For Tobey.\" \"9:30 tomorrow. Don't be late.\"[Chapter 3] Everyone got to the garage bright and early so they could be ready for Dino to drop off the car. While they waited, Pete and Benny played Benny's new video game. Unsurprisingly, it was a racing game. Pete was winning by a landslide. Tess was lounging on one of the reclining chairs, her feet hanging over the armrest as she ate out of another bag of sour gummy worms. She dropped one of them into Finn's mouth as he fiddled with his bass guitar. \"You're cheating, man,\" Benny said, attempting to disrupt Pete's focus by hitting his controller. \"Quit cheating!\" Pete laughed. \"You just can't keep up.\" A truck pulled up to the garage with a covered car on the back of the bed. \"Here we go!\" Tobey exclaimed. The two boys immediately stopped their game as everyone got up to go see the car they were to work on. \"Yeah!\" Finn exclaimed excitedly. \"All right, all right, all right,\" Tobey muttered to himself. The man driving the truck took the tarp off the famous Mustang. Despite the fact that the car was merely a skeleton, excitement hit every single person on the team. \"Where's the rest of it?\" Benny asked. Tobey laughed as he hit Pete's chest. \"We got a lot of work to do. Tess, you got those programs ready?\" Tess ate one of the gummy worms without taking her eye off the Mustang. \"Do you even have to ask?\" It took a few weeks, but when the team was done with the car, it couldn't have been more amazing. Tess had used one of her programs to figure out how to get the most out of the car and make it the best modified racing car out there. It had pretty much everything a racer needed. And the fact that it was the Carroll Shelby's car made everything that much better. This was by far the best car the team had ever worked on. Using her techno knowledge, Tess built up a great presentation for the gathered crowd at the big reveal party. She had some holographic mustang horses running in place in the center of the room. Then the horses morphed into shards of glass and floated over to where the car was. It outlined the car for a few seconds before the room went black and everyone could hear the engine revving. As the tarp came off the car, strobe lights went crazy all around it. Once the tarp was completely off, the strobes stopped and showed the modified Mustang in all its glory. Everyone applauded as the light came up. The team all high-fived one another. \"Sick set-up, Big Sis,\" Pete praised. \"Thanks, Little Bro,\" Tess smiled as she closed her laptop. Those in attendance went up to the car to admire the team's handiwork and decide if it was worth bidding on. As Tobey and Pete talked to various people who were interested in buying, Joe, Finn, and Tess headed over to the bar. \"Do you like that car over there?\" Finn asked a woman who was several inches taller than him. \"Yeah, it's nice,\" she answered. \"Yeah. We built that.\" \"Oh. So, you're a mechanic.\" The woman sighed disinterestedly and turned away from him. \"That was real smooth, bro,\" Joe remarked. Finn leaned onto the bar and looked at the two women sitting next to Joe and Tess, also much taller than he was. \"Hey. Do you like that car over there?\" \"Okay. Excuse me.\" Joe walked away from the bar as Tess smiled. \"We built that. We're mechanics. We're not afraid to get our hands dirty. Do you know what I mean?\" The two women turned away from him as well. Finn cut his losses and went over to yet another woman. \"Do you like that car over there?\" Tess smirked and hit Joe on the chest. \"Watch this.\" She went over to where Finn was striking out again. \"Mechanic, huh?\" the latest woman said with disdain. \"Yeah,\" Finn answered with a smile. Tess seductively put her hands on Finn's arm and shoulder and smiled at him. \"I happen to think mechanics are very hot. I mean, all that time working on cars makes them so buff and strong.\" She turned to the women. \"You would not believe the muscles on these guys.\" She turned back to Finn. \"Call me sometime.\" As she started to walk away, she said quietly in his ear, \"You're welcome.\" Tess walked back over to Joe and smiled. When they looked at Finn, he now had several women around him feeling his biceps. \"Girls are much more interested when they think they have competition,\" she smirked. Joe smiled a little. \"And you're not jealous at all?\" \"Of them? No.\" \"Not even a little?\" Tess gave him a pointed look. \"Despite what you all may think, Finn and I are just friends.\" \"Mm-hmm.\" \"Besides, I don't think he'd be interested anyway.\" \"What makes you say that?\" \"Well, look at him.\" Finn was now surrounded by girls who were all laughing like he was the funniest person on earth. \"Those are more his style.\" \"They're all taller than him.\" Tess laughed. \"Maybe so, but that's who he's interested in.\" \"Yeah, but Tess—\" \"Joe? Just drop it. There's nothing more between me and Finn.\" Tess went over to Pete and Tobey who were looking at their handiwork. \"'Sup, Big Sis?\" Pete smiled. \"Helping Finn score with the ladies. I swear, that man would be lost without me.\" \"We'd all be lost without you,\" Tobey told her. \"I know.\" A petite blonde woman wearing a slimming black dress walked up to the three of them. She looked at the car and then back at them. \"How fast does it go?\" she asked, revealing she had a British accent. \"Uh, fast. Very fast,\" Pete answered. He extended his hand for her to shake. \"Pete.\" The woman smiled and shook his hand. \"Aren't all Mustangs fast?\" \"Well, this one was built by Ford and reimagined by Carroll Shelby, the greatest performance car builder in American history.\" \"She's not from around here, Petey,\" Tobey said quietly. \"So she probably has no idea who Carroll Shelby is.\" \"Hey, give her some credit,\" Tess told him. \"She may very well know who Carroll Shelby is.\" She turned to the woman. \"I'm Tess.\" \"Julia,\" the woman answered. \"But why is it so fast?\" \"It's 900 horsepower, baby,\" Pete smiled. \"Is that a lot?\" \"Are—Are you kidding me?\" \"Petey,\" Tobey muttered. \"Look, miss, this isn't the kind of car you can just go to the mall and buy. Trust me when I say it's one of a kind.\" Julia nodded a little. \"Can I see the engine?\" Pete raised his eyebrows with a smirk. \"Sure,\" Tobey said. Pete pulled out his keys and popped the hood on the Mustang. The three of them walked over to it, and Pete proudly lifted up the hood for Julia to see what was under it. Julia smirked. \"5.8 liter, aluminum block, SVT supercharger, and racing headers. Yeah, it's quite nice, actually.\" Pete, Tobey, and Tess all exchanged surprised glances. \"Told you to give her some credit,\" Tess said to the boys. Pete smiled as he walked over to stand next to Tobey and Tess. \"I wasn't expecting that.\" \"Nor was I,\" Tobey answered. \"Why?\" Julia asked sharply. \"Because I'm a woman? Or because I'm from England? Mr. Shelby's first Cobra was built using an AC body made in England. It had a Ford 260 CID V8 engine. Of course, you already knew that. Life can be full of surprises.\" She smiled broadly at the three of them. \"I find life to be full of people who think they're smart because they have a fancy accent,\" Pete said. Tobey grimaced at his friend's words. \"No offense.\" \"Some taken.\" \"I really love Piers Morgan.\" Tess smiled and shook her head. \"So, this is how it goes, is it?\" Julia said. She looked over at Tobey. \"You're very quiet, very tough, and then you're just constantly cracking these hilarious jokes. At least you've got this girl with you who has her head on straight.\" Tess smiled at Julia and smirked at her 'brothers'. \"Hey, Jules,\" Dino said as he walked up behind the blonde woman. He awkwardly kissed her on the cheek. \"Three million is way too much for this car, Dino,\" Julia told him. \"Well, that's what it costs. Let's see what Ingram thinks.\" \"I am what Ingram thinks, and he thinks two at the most.\" \"Well, three is the number.\" \"Three is absurd. That's why nobody has bid on it.\" \"That's the best car I've driven since Indy.\" \"You haven't driven it, Dino,\" Pete put in. \"Tobey's had the keys the whole time.\" Tess and Julia laughed at his joke. Tess knew for a fact that it was true. Dino hadn't driven the car once. \"Do you want me to turn around and plug my ears while you all get on the same page?\" Julia said as she continued to laugh. \"What's the top speed?\" \"180,\" Dino answered. \"230,\" Tobey said at the same time. \"230?\" Julia asked. \"He's talking about a theoretical top speed,\" Dino explained. Julia looked over at Tobey. \"I know that you don't really talk, but maybe Mr. Strong-and-Silent could be a little less silent.\" \"She'll go 230,\" Tobey told her firmly. \"Top NASCAR speed ever was 228.\" \"This car is faster.\" Julia stared him down for a few seconds. \"8:00 a.m., tomorrow at Shepperton. You get anything close to 230 out of this car, Ingram is going to buy it on the spot.\" \"For 3 million,\" Dino interjected. \"Give or take a million. Mostly take. Good night, lads. And lady.\" \"Bye,\" Pete smiled. Tess looked in the direction Julia had gone. \"I like her.\" \"230?\" Dino said in disbelief. \"Are you crazy? What if I can't get the car there?\" \"Well, maybe you can't, but I can,\" Tobey told him. \"I'll drive.\" \"Don't even think about driving that car.\" Tess shook her head again. Every day, she asked herself what she had ever seen in that guy. She put her hand on Tobey's shoulder. \"Go show him who's boss. I have other commitments tomorrow, but promise you'll call me as soon as you can, and let me know how it went. Okay?\" \"Sure thing.\" \"Promise?\" \"I promise, Little Sis.\" \"Knowing you, I think tomorrow's going to be a good day.\"[Chapter 4] Tess was lounging on the sofa in the garage, waiting for Tobey and Pete to return. Her laptop was sitting in front of her as she fiddled with her latest designs. She hoped that she could share her ideas with the others when they celebrated selling the Mustang. After all, Tobey was sure to get the care up to 230. She had no doubt about that. Her phone buzzed next to her, and she saw that Finn was calling. She closed her laptop and stood up from the couch as she answered the call. \"Hey, Finn.\" \"Tess, it's Pete.\" Tess smiled a little. \"Uh-oh. What did he get himself into now?\" \"Tess.\" \"I swear that boy is always getting into trouble.\" \"Tess!\" \"What?\" \"Pete's dead.\" All of the air left Tess's lungs in one short exhale. She refused to believe that she had heard that correctly. Today was supposed to be an amazing day. A day where Tobey broke records and proved Dino wrong. It couldn't be the day Pete died. \"What?\" she asked shakily. \"What are you talking about?\" \"He, Tobey, and Dino were racing, and Dino tapped the back of Pete's car. It caused Pete's car to go out of control. It caught fire and ran off the bridge. And…now Tobey's been arrested because Dino drove off and there's no evidence that he was ever there. They think Tobey's the reason Pete died.\" Tess took the phone away from her ear as tears filled her vision. \"Tess? Tess?\" The phone slipped from her grasp and fell to the ground. Finally, all of the oxygen returned to her lungs, and she began wailing and crying and screaming. She sank to her knees, unable to stand any longer. Her fists hit the ground again and again until they were all bruised up. Tears flowed down her cheeks faster than they ever had or would again. Her little brother was dead. Everyone gathered at the cemetery as Pete's coffin was to be lowered into the ground. All the members of the team were in attendance, their eyes misting with tears but none of them allowing any to fall. The same didn't go for Tess. She was freely sobbing even harder than Anita. Tobey wasn't there. He had been sentenced to two years in prison for vehicular manslaughter. Everyone believed that Tobey was responsible for Pete's death. Tobey Marshall, the sweetest guy Tess had even known, was believed to have killed their little brother. \"Fear not, for I am with you,\" the preacher read. \"Be not dismayed, for I am your God. Behold, all those who were incensed against you shall be ashamed and disgraced. They shall be nothing. Those who war against you shall be as nothing. For I shall hold your right hand, saying to you, 'Fear not, I will help you'.\" Dino put his arm around Anita, acting like he had had nothing at all to do with Pete's death. The entire time, Joe glared daggers at him. First, he had broken his best friend's heart and now he had killed his other best friend while letting another go to prison. That was three hurt friends at Dino's hand, and that was three too many. Tess was wearing a knee-length black dress, and her hair was pulled back by a black headband. The team members had never seen her look so…feminine. Under different circumstances, most of them probably would've given her a hard time since she never dressed up at all. But if this was what it took…they wished more than anything that Tess never had to dress up again. Soon everyone began to disperse from the gravesite. Tess looked over at Dino and fury flooded every cell in her body. She furiously began storming over to him. \"Tess, stop,\" Benny said. Tess didn't stop. Nothing could make her stop. Dino looked her right in the eyes as she came over to him. Without any warning, Tess socked him hard on the cheek. The other members of the team rushed over to her and began to pull her back as she screamed at him, \"This is your fault! It's your fault! You did this! You did this! It's your fault!\" Finn firmly pulled her towards him, and she fell against him, sobbing against his chest. Benny and Joe gently put their hands on her back and shoulders as she cried. Joe glared at Dino once more, angry at him for hurting Tess yet again. Dino rubbed the place where Tess's fist had made contact. He quickly began ushering Anita towards their car. \"What did she mean that this is your fault?\" Anita asked. \"Everyone handles grief in different ways,\" Dino told her. \"Tess looks for someone to blame.\" Anita nodded a little, but there was something in the back of her mind that told her that Tess had a different reason for attacking Dino. The group headed back to Tobey's garage for a couple of beers. Anything to ease the pain. \"That was stupid, Tess,\" Benny said to the girl. \"I don't care.\" \"You shouldn't have punched him at Pete's funeral.\" \"Why not?\" Tess furiously demanded as she turned to face him. \"He deserved it! We all know that Dino's the one who's responsible for killing Pete, and yet he's out roaming free while Tobey is in jail!\" \"Pete and Tobey knew the risks when they started racing.\" \"Not these kinds of risks! They never could've prepared for this! Dino should never have been at that funeral! He killed Pete!\" \"He didn't mean to.\" \"Oh, so now you're defending him?!\" \"No, I'm just saying that Dino didn't plan for this to happen.\" \"Well, he just left my little brother there to burn while my big brother got escorted off to prison! I will never forgive him for that!\" \"Tess, we'll figure this out one way or another,\" Joe said. Tess shook her head. \"No, forget it. I'm done.\" She began to walk out of the garage. \"Wait, what do you mean?\" Finn called after her. She angrily spun around. \"I mean I'm done! I'm out.\" With that, Tess turned her back on the garage and her team. \"Hey, Little Sis,\" Tobey said from the other side of the glass. \"Hi, Tobey,\" Tess said into the phone. \"How are you holding up?\" \"About as well as you it looks like.\" Tess nodded a little. It was true, she looked awful. It had been a little over a year since Pete's death, and things had not improved even a little in her life. Her appearance usually didn't look very great ever since that day. She hadn't gotten much sleep in months nor had she been eating very well. It had started to show after only a few weeks. Her body had gotten even thinner than it already was, and she constantly looked drained. Her coworkers could see her eyes watering every now and again as she sat at her work station, but no one could say anything to ease the pain. Ever since she had walked out on the team, almost all communication with them had stopped. It wasn't really intentional, it had just happened. She had visited Tobey a couple times in prison. She wanted to go more, but with work and her constant state of depression, she never got around to it. \"How are you and Finn?\" Tobey asked. Tess scoffed. \"Only you would be here and ask me about my relationship status.\" \"Well?\" \"Uh, we see each other in passing at work, and we used to get lunch together sometimes, but lately…we haven't really talked much. Everything just…changed.\" \"My garage?\" \"Just been foreclosed…\" She lightly put her hand to the glass. \"You don't deserve to be in here.\" \"Yeah…\" \"If we could just find evidence that Dino was there, then we could get you out of here. I tried to hack into his server to see if I could find anything, but he has a million firewalls up that would take me years to get through. And I don't know if the information is even on that server.\" \"A computer you couldn't hack into? I never thought I'd see the day.\" Tess gave him a small smile. \"Well, Dino knows me and what I can do. He knows how to keep me out. I'm sorry, Tobey. I feel like I've failed you again.\" \"What do you mean 'again'?\" \"I should've been there that day…\" \"Tess, you didn't even know about the race. I never called you.\" \"No. But Pete did. He wanted me to see you guys beat Dino. If I had just gone…\" \"Tess, look at me. I'm glad you weren't there that day. Because you would've just gone to prison too. Prison's no place for someone like you. And you would've seen Pete…\" He faltered a little bit at the mention of their little brother. \"I wouldn't wish that sight on anyone, especially my little sister.\" Tess sighed heavily, knowing he had a good point. \"I miss you.\" Tobey put his hand to the glass, and Tess put her hand where his was. \"I miss you too. Just hang on a little longer, okay?\" \"Okay. See you later, Big Bro.\" \"Bye, Little Sis.\" Tess met up with Benny during her lunch break after he had called her insisting that they had to meet. \"Are you all nuts?!\" Tess exclaimed when he told her the team's latest plan. Apparently, Tobey was going to race again as soon as he got out of prison in a few weeks. His plan was to do anything it took to get into De Leon and prove his innocence. Tess was all for proving that Dino was the one responsible for Pete, but not like this. \"The last time he raced, Pete died, and he went to jail!\" she continued. \"He's going to break parole as soon as he gets out and go racing ?!\" \"Come on, Tess. Joe and I are on board already.\" \"And Finn?\" \"Well…no, not yet, but—\" \"Yeah, because he finds this as ridiculous as I do! Benny, I've already lost one brother. I'm not about to lose another one.\" \"Tess—\" \"No! If you guys seriously want to do this, you're going to have to do it without me.\" She turned and stormed back to her job, refusing to give Benny a second glance.[Chapter 5] Finn was putting information on his computer in the cubicle at the accounting firm where he worked when Joe's face filled his phone screen. His eyes widened a little as the set ringtone began to play loudly. Before anyone noticed, he quickly pressed the 'Decline' button. Only a few more seconds passed before the phone rang again with the same ringtone. Finn quickly answered the phone before he got in trouble. \"Dude, stop calling me, okay? We've already had this conversation.\" \"Grab Tess and go to the window,\" Joe said bluntly. \"No.\" Finn's eyebrows furrowed as he processed what his friend was telling him what to do. \"Why?\" \"Just grab Tess and go to the window. Quit being a little jerk.\" Finn sighed and stood up from his chair. \"You're the jerk.\" He quickly made his way over to the IT department where Tess worked. It was no secret that she absolutely hated her job. Everyone knew that she should be the head of the department because the actual head was a moron. Tess could do pretty much everything on a computer better than he could. What was worse was that he never listened to what she had to say and believed that he was always in the right. He was the most impossible man to work with. \"Hey,\" Finn said as he got to Tess's work station. \"Come on.\" She looked up at him hardly. \"I'm working.\" \"Just come on.\" He grabbed her arm and yanked her out of her chair. \"This better be good,\" she muttered. The two of them went over to the window and looked at the ground below. Right in front of the building was the Mustang they had built two years ago and behind it was the Beast. The Mustang engine was revving causing all heads in the vicinity to turn at the loud noise. Finn and Tess looked at each other in confusion. A police car pulled up next to the Mustang. It stayed there for a few moments as the police officer conversed with Tobey who continued to rev the engine. \"Finn, are you both there?\" Joe asked. \"We're here,\" Finn answered. \"All right. Don't mind the cop. That's not the problem. Watch how the car leans as he pulls away. That's our problem.\" Joe gave the OK sign to Tobey, and the Mustang sped off around the block. Tess and Finn watched in amazement. The car handled pretty nicely. But not nicely enough. \"The car is loose,\" Finn remarked. \"Yeah, I know,\" Joe said. \"Thank you for that. If Tobey runs that setup in De Leon, he won't finish, let alone win.\" Finn pulled the phone away from his ear and looked at Joe's video chat on the screen. \"He's in?\" Joe smiled. \"Maybe. Look, we have a plan.\" \"And what does that mean?\" \"It means we know what we're doing. Get your butts down here!\" Finn looked at Tess and smiled broadly. \"Uh-oh,\" she said with a small smile herself. \"What are you thinking?\" Tess followed Finn as he walked back through the halls of the accounting firm. He whipped off his tie and then took off his shoes revealing the multi-colored socks he had on. \"Finn!\" one of their coworkers called. \"Finn, you okay, buddy?\" \"Uh, Finn?\" Tess said. \"What are you doing?\" Finn didn't answer her. He continued walking down the hall as he whipped off his business jacket and threw it on the ground. Then to her surprise, he whipped off the blue button-up shirt he was wearing. \"Oh, my—Finn, what are you doing?!\" \"Quitting.\" \"Okay, well there's a more formal process you go through for that.\" \"Come on, Tess, lighten up.\" Tess glared at his backside and quickly pulled him into one of the empty rooms next to them. People passing by peeked in curiously, wondering why she was in there with a shirtless man. \"'Lighten up'?\" Finn shrugged his shoulders. \"Just come on.\" \"Okay. Not everyone is as comfortable with their bodies as you are. I mean, look at you. You look amazing.\" And it was true. Finn did have a rather defined chest that she definitely didn't know he had. His tanned skin really accented it all too. Finn took a small step closer to her. \"Checking me out?\" Tess glared at him and didn't respond as she clenched her jaw. She was not in the mood for his little quips. Finn laughed lightly. \"Tess, you're young, you're hot, you've got a sexy bod. Come on. Live a little.\" When she still didn't say anything, he asked, \"Can you honestly tell me that you actually like this job?\" Tess looked up at him. \"You know, I did always hate having to wear these heels.\" She undid her heels and let her feet sink into the ugly brown carpet. \"And I really don't like wearing pantyhose.\" She took the pantyhose off her legs. \"You know, I really hate this whole get-up.\" The two of them smiled at each other as they both exited the room. Tess undid her black business jacket and shrugged it off to reveal her black cami underneath. She then took that off as well so that just her lace bra was showing. The two of them tossed the cami, blue shirt, and black jacket to a man and woman standing in the hallway. \"Casual Friday,\" Finn remarked. As Finn undid his belt and took off his pants revealing his blue boxers, Tess shrugged off her tight black pencil skirt. By now, the two of them were in the accounting firm hallway in just their underwear. Finn looked over at the woman they had passed. \"Jacki. Oh, Jacki.\" \"No. Finn—\" Jacki started. Finn went up to her and took her head in his hands before kissing her full on the lips, standing on his tip-toes to do so. He wrapped his arms around her body, forbidding her from stopping the kiss too soon. Tess let out a small laugh as he pulled away, deciding to ignore some kind of stabbing feeling in the bottom of her stomach. \"I've always wanted to do that,\" he confessed. Jacki looked at him sharply. \"Tess!\" Tess turned to find the head of the IT department storming over to her, his tablet in hand as always. She wondered if Candy Crush was on there like it usually was. After all, he never did any real work. \"Put your clothes back on and get back to your computer this instant!\" Tess smirked and began walking over to him. \"Your CPU is from the Stone Age, the amount of syntax errors you make in an hour could make a person with perfect vision go blind, and I can create a whole Web browser from scratch faster than you can eat all those Twinkies and cupcakes hidden in your office. You are an idiot!\" She grabbed his tablet from him and smashed it against the wall where the screen shattered completely. She turned around and smiled at Finn. \"I've always wanted to do that !\" As she walked back over to him, she took her hair out of her tight ponytail and let it fall down around her shoulders. They continued down the hall when Finn stopped and pulled down his boxers. Tess's eyes widened as she smiled and looked up and away. The entire office gasped behind them. \"Have a nice day, you miserable dirtbags!\" Finn said to his coworkers. He looked over at Tess, but she shook her head. \"I'm stopping here.\" Finn turned and continued down the hall. Tess ran after him and jumped on his back…being extra careful to not let her legs go anywhere below his waist. For the first time in two years, she laughed. Really laughed. Finn set her down as they got to the elevator. When it opened, he took her hand and they joined an older woman who gasped when she saw the two young adults. \"Our friend is running the fastest Mustang in the world at De Leon on Sunday and the setup is all wrong,\" Finn said to the woman. \"I'm in accounting,\" the woman said quietly. \"Oh,\" he sighed in sympathy. \"Don't you feel like you're dying inside?\" \"Yes.\" \"I recommend quitting while you can,\" Tess told her. \"And get creative when you do it! It's totally worth it!\" The elevator doors opened again, and Finn grabbed Tess's hand as they bolted out to find Joe while the woman awkwardly went in the other direction. \"Where's the Beast?\" Finn asked his friend. Joe froze as he saw the two of them in their state of undress. \"What the…Where are your guys' clothes?\" \"Did you miss this?\" Joe started running away from Finn who chased after him. \"No, I didn't miss—Don't touch me, man. Stay away! We gotta go, let's go.\" \"You missed me, didn't you?\" \"No.\" Finn jumped on him. \"Get off!\" Tess laughed as she followed the two of them out to the front of the building. \"I've got the shaved bird and the queen bee,\" Joe said to Tobey over the phone. \"We're jumping in the Beast.\" \"All right, we're behind,\" Tobey told him. \"We got 28 hours to get to Cali.\" \"Copy that.\" A woman walking into the building froze at the sight of Finn and Tess. \"Good morning,\" Finn said casually. \"So why the heck are you guys naked?\" Joe demanded. \"To make sure we'd never come back. \"I'm sure you could've done that another way.\" \"That's what I told him,\" Tess said. \"But look where we are now.\" \"Let's be clear, though, you're not wearing my underwear.\" Tess and Finn smiled at each other as they hopped into the Beast and drove down the road so they could meet up with Tobey and the Mustang once he lost the cops.[Chapter 6] \"So we got into your place and swiped some new clothes for you,\" Joe said, tossing back a change of clothes for Tess. \"How did you get into my apartment?\" Tess asked in disbelief. \"It's not that hard for me to pick a lock.\" \"That's so scary. Did you get my laptop too?\" \"You wouldn't be any use to us without it.\" \"Gee, thanks. Love you too.\" Tess threw on her skinny jeans, the loose t-shirt with 'Work Hard, Dream Big' on the front in large letters, and her black converse shoes. It was a thousand times better than wearing that awful business get-up. \"WNKW with a question for Tobey Marshall,\" Benny's voice came across the Beast's radio from the news station helicopter. \"On a scale from one to ten, how crazy hot is your passenger?\" \"Wait, passenger?\" Tess asked. \"Yeah, Julia came along,\" Joe answered. \"Really?\" \"She didn't really give us much of a choice.\" \"Like my new wheels?\" Benny continued. \"Awesome, right?\" \"What happened to the Cessna?\" Tobey asked. \"Flight restrictions in the city, man. But it's all good. I borrowed my buddy's little bird. Let me get a hard right. Y'all lucky, I almost got my hands on that Apache from Great Lakes Army Air Base, but, uh, Colonel Gatins was sweating me hard.\" \"Here we go again,\" Joe said into the radio. \"Not talking to you, Beast.\" Finn took the radio from Joe. \"Roger that, Liar One.\" \"Finn, you're back in the crew for all of 10 minutes and you're already up my skirt talking crap. Man, you're gonna rue the day you started calling me that.\" \"What, did you all of a sudden go to college, fool?\" \"Wow. What a really ignorant thing to say. Man, are you ignorant.\" \"Is it gonna be like this the entire way?\" Julia's voice asked. Tess grabbed the radio from Finn. \"You get used to it. Hey, Julia.\" \"Hi, Tess.\" \"I'm glad you're back, Little Sis,\" Tobey smiled as he tried to avoid the police cars. \"As much as I hate to admit it, I'm glad to be back.\" Tess opened up her laptop in the back of the Beast and hacked into Tobey's video feed so she could see where he was and what he was doing. \"Hey, Liar One, eyes on the road,\" Tobey told Benny. \"Wow!\" Benny exclaimed as he almost hit a bridge. \"I did not see that!\" \"Benny, were you looking at girls' butts again?\" Tess asked. \"You're such a pervert. People like you are the reason we have feminists.\" \"That's rather hurtful, Tess.\" \"But it's the truth, Liar One.\" \"All right, between you and Finn, I'm going to slap you both upside the head.\" The three passengers in the Beast laughed together at Benny's reaction to the nickname he hated so much. \"All right, Beauty, this is gonna sound insane, but I need a two-lane grasshopper in order to get these guys off your back,\" Benny told Tobey. \"Roger,\" Tobey answered. \"What's a grasshopper?\" Julia asked. \"You may wanna close your eyes for this.\" \"Is it worse than 'Bus, bus, bus'?\" \"You got this, Tobey!\" Tess told the driver of the Mustang. \"All right,\" Benny said. \"Now, just aim for the trees. Spread your wings, Beauty!\" Tess watched from her computer as Tobey drove up the hill and flew across two lanes of traffic before landing in the grass on the other side and getting back on the road. \"Hey, hey!\" Benny laughed. Tess smiled. \"That's my big brother.\" \"What just happened?\" Julia asked in amazement. \"You're amazing. I can't believe we're alive.\" \"Okay, got to go,\" Benny muttered. \"Time's up in the bird.\" \"That was amazing. You're amazing. We are amazing.\" \"Liar One, are you tracking that air bear heading to I-94?\" Tobey asked. \"If he spots me, it's game over. We're gonna need to switch to plan B.\" \"Plan B adds an hour to the trip,\" Finn said. \"No choice, we're gonna have to make up that time.\" \"Roger that,\" Joe answered. \"Plan B it is.\" \"Beauty will go bingo on that route, so we're gonna have to hot fuel and top off.\" \"Hot fuel, coming up! Whoo!\" Joe smiled and looked over at Finn. \"Get out there, skinny boy.\" \"Oh, you were checking me out!\" Finn joked. Tess rolled her eyes again as he climbed out the window and on top of the moving truck so he could refuel the Mustang without stopping. The Mustang pulled up next to the Beast. Finn readied the fuel pump in the back and then leaned over to reach the gas tank on the Mustang. Unfortunately, he couldn't get the door to the gas tank open. Julia climbed out of her own window and the scarf tied around her head flew off from the wind, lost forever on the highway. She reached over and pounded on the door until it opened. \"Closer!\" she yelled to Tobey. Tobey moved the Mustang over closer to the Beast until she could grab the fuel nozzle from Finn. She then took and it and jammed it into the gas tank before giving him the OK sign. \"Whoo!\" Finn exclaimed as he began to pump gas into the moving Mustang. \"I got this! Go inside!\" Julia climbed back into the Mustang and rolled up the window. \"Hey, Beast, take the shoulder,\" Tobey said to Joe. \"I'll go with you.\" \"Roger that, Beauty,\" Joe answered. The Beast and the Mustang moved over onto the shoulder of the highway so they could drive past a large camper in the other lane. \"I need eyes on that bear in the air, Liar One,\" Tobey said. \"What's your 20?\" \"Still on the ground, Beauty,\" Benny told him. Finn finished pumping the gas and removed the nozzle from the car before closing the door to the gas tank. \"You're good!\" he yelled, giving a thumbs-up to Julia. \"Yeah, yeah!\" The Mustang powered ahead of the Beast and took the exit that would lead Tobey south and off the cops' trail. \"Thanks, boys!\" Tobey exclaimed. \"Beauty is a redneck.\" \"Roger that,\" Joe answered. \"Beast loves a redneck.\" Finn climbed on top of the Beast and faced forward, letting the wind whip through his clothes and hair. \"Whoo! YEAH!\" Tess poked her head out the back window. \"Alright, Evel Knievel, get back in here before you kill yourself!\" Finn smirked and got back into the passenger seat of the Beast. \"If that's not on your bucket list, put it on there.\" A police helicopter drove above them heading down the highway, looking for Tobey. Tess smiled. They were going to be disappointed. Joe picked up his radio. \"Bear in the air is fangs-out down I-94. Beauty, you are safe and sound.\" \"Joe, give me your phone,\" Tess said. \"I'm going to use it as a hotspot so I can get Wi-Fi.\" \"Oh, come on. You're gonna use up all my data.\" \"Hey, you wanted me along, so let me do what I do. Phone. Now.\" Joe begrudgingly pulled out his phone and handed it to her. \"My password is—\" \"Oh, I know your password already. I hacked your phone within the first two days I met you.\" \"Wait, what?\" \"Well, I had to know who I was getting involved with. I hacked all your phones.\" \"Wait, what ?\" Finn exclaimed, spinning around in his seat to look at her. Tess just smirked at him with a knowing smile. She unlocked Joe's phone and then set up a hotspot. She then connected her laptop up to the phone and pulled up Monarch's live webcast. \"Kids, I'm looking at something that I can't quite believe,\" the racing mogul said as he looked at his news feed. Tobey, Joe, and Benny had all uploaded videos to his computer of Tobey driving the Mustang all around the city…including his incredible 'grasshopper'. \"I mean, my inbox is white hot. I got a bunch of trolls sending me footage of something that is mind-blowing. I'm looking at footage of a car that supposedly disappeared. That's the same car that Ford and Shelby were building when Carroll died. I'm looking at a gorgeous ghost. And I think that's Tobey Marshall inside there, driving a chariot of the gods. So I bow down to Tobey Marshall.\" Tess smiled up at Joe and Finn. \"Dino Brewster is on the line right now.\" The smile quickly left her face. \"Ugh…\" \"Dino! Dino, Dino bambino in San Francisco. You need to see what I'm looking at. I'm looking at some aerial footage of Tobey Marshall flying across the country with the cops in tow in a phantom Ford that will make your bowels loose.\" \"Tobey Marshall doing something stupid and reckless again?\" Dino asked over the line smugly. \"Didn't that guy just get out of prison for manslaughter?\" Tess gritted her teeth angrily. Dino was practically rubbing it in their faces that he had gotten off scot-free for killing her little brother. \"Whoa!\" Monarch exclaimed. \"Dino, Dino, bambino. Hey, accidents happen in racing. Nobody knows that better than you, Dino, remember?\" Dino laughed. \"I just don't wanna see him race at De Leon. You know, in fact, I'm willing to give up my…I'm willing to give up my Elemento to anyone that puts a stop to Tobey Marshall.\" \"What?!\" Tess exclaimed. \"He's seriously stooping that low?\" \"Dirtbag,\" Finn muttered. \"He's just scared because he knows that Tobey is a better racer than he is.\" \"Wait a minute,\" Monarch said. \"Wait a minute, did you just say what I think you said? That car is one of three in the world. You're willing to give away your Lamborghini to stop Tobey Marshall?\" \"Yes, I am,\" Dino replied. \"And I'm gonna post some pictures online so everybody knows exactly what they're looking for.\" Pictures of the car Dino was giving away and Tobey's Mustang surfaced on the webcast. \"He's not lying,\" Tess told the others. \"The pictures are up for everyone to see.\" \"This is too good,\" Monarch continued. \"This is too good. I got star-crossed lovers hauling their butts across the country. I got Dino Brewster, who just painted a huge bull's-eye on their butts. Oh, man. Christmas came early, wing nuts. The thing you gotta understand is, racing is an art. Racing with passion…Dude, that's high art. Man, I can feel love and vengeance and smell motor oil all swirling together out there. We got supernatural Mustangs, we got personal vendettas. I have no idea where this is going. I just know I like it. I like it a lot!\" Monarch pressed a button and took a caller. \"Go ahead.\" \"Monarch, this is the blonde female sitting right next to Tobey Marshall,\" Julia's voice came across. \"Wait, is that Julia?\" Tess asked in surprise. Monarch scoffed. \"Really? Okay. We got a girl with a fake British accent, claiming she's sitting next to Tobey Marshall.\" \"Uh-oh…\" Monarch put on an overdramatic British accent to mock Julia. \"Having a spot of tea, are you, dove?\" \"There were three cars in the race the day that Pete died, that's a fact,\" Julia told him sharply. \"And anyone that says that Tobey is responsible for Pete's death, answer this. Why jump parole in New York knowing that you are going to be re-arrested and do serious time unless you are innocent and hell-bent to right a wrong? He did the time, he paid the debts, why would he risk it? Next time you talk to Dino, you can ask him that question.\" Tess smiled at her fellow passengers. \"I knew I liked her.\" \"I like this girl!\" Monarch exclaimed. \"Yeah! Yeah! Yeah, the British are coming. I gotta tell you, I'm moved. I am. The whole thing just went right here to the old ticker. I gotta pop one of these.\" He took a couple of the pills sitting on his desk. \"Yeah. This is getting good. I believe you, you crazy little tart. Tobey Marshall versus Dino Brewster. That's a deep rivalry right there. Yeah. I hear you, honey. I hear you. The two of you out there, flying across the country at killer speeds to prove something while you're tearing up the American asphalt. Born to run, baby. Born to run. Tobey Marshall, welcome to the De Leon.\" \"YES!\" Tess yelled as she put her hands to her mouth. Everyone in the Beast began cheering loudly. \"That's it, cretins, De Leon is full. But if you want Dino Brewster's Lamborghini, you're gonna have to chase down that Mustang to get it. Wow. The race before the race. I love it.\" Monarch laughed before pressing another button and ending his webcast. The invitation popped up on the screen Tess had hacked into. \"He just got the invite!\" she told Joe and Finn. She reached up and grabbed the radio. \"By the way, Julia, I loved the way you told off Monarch!\" \"Beauty!\" Benny exclaimed from his Cessna. \"Congrats on the wild card to the rodeo, my friend. Your route is clear to the Nebraska border. Darkness is upon us, so the eyes in the sky will be shut for a while. But I'm gonna leapfrog ahead and meet you guys at Record Breaker.\" \"What's your 20, Liar One?\" Finn asked. \"Flat-hatting you! Ha ha!\" Everyone in the Beast flinched as Benny soared right over top of the large truck before flying directly in front of them on the road. Finn and Tess started laughing. \"Special delivery,\" Benny laughed. \"I hope you ladies didn't soil your panties down there.\" \"I hate it when he does that!\" Joe exclaimed. \"That's what I thought. Keep talking that crap.\" \"Nice to see you haven't changed, nimrod,\" Finn said to him. \"Okay, listen. I don't know who 'nimrod' is, but I'm pretty sure he lived in the 50s. All right? My handle is Maverick. You better ask somebody.\" Tess laughed as she shook her head. She hadn't realized just how much she missed spending time with the team until they were all together again. With a contented sigh, she closed her laptop and turned off the hotspot on Joe's phone. \"Alright, I don't know about you guys, but I'm exhausted,\" she told her passengers. \"I'm going to get some sleep back here.\" She set her laptop on the floor of the truck and stretched out across the backseat. Before long, she was out cold.[Chapter 7] As Tess slept in the back, Joe noticed that Finn kept glancing at her every half-hour. Joe smiled a little. \"Hey man, I know we usually don't have serious conversations…but why don't you just tell her how you feel?\" Finn once again looked back at Tess's sleeping form. How could he tell her how much he cared for her after what she had seen him do with Jacki? Although the team always joked about it, there really was something more between them. Neither of them had ever fully admitted it to themselves. He knew how beat up Tess was about Pete's death and Tobey going to prison. Every time he tried to call her and ask how she was doing, he chickened out. Even at work when he passed by her, he wouldn't say anything, despite the fact that he was worried sick each time he saw her look just a little bit thinner and a little bit wearier. The two of them hardly ever did anything but joke around. The fact of the matter was that he wasn't sure he knew how he was supposed to comfort her. He had proven that at Pete's funeral. Today had been the first day he had ever seen her really smile since Pete died. He had forgotten just how beautiful her smile really was. And her laugh…It was like music to his ears. Music he hadn't heard in far, far too long. Tess awoke a few hours later when Joe stopped at a gas station. Finn was conked out in the passenger seat. \"Perfect,\" she said. \"I'm starving. I'm gonna grab something to eat.\" \"Make it quick,\" Joe told her. \"We gotta make sure we get there before Tobey does.\" Tess ran inside and grabbed a sandwich and a bag of chips. She quickly scarfed it all down which was something she hadn't done with food in quite a while. Then she began heading back out to the Beast. Joe rubbed his eyes drowsily as he finished pumping the gas. \"Joe,\" Tess said gently. \"You look exhausted. Why don't you let me drive for a few hours? I've just had the best sleep I've gotten in two years.\" \"I don't know, Tess…\" \"Tobey's never going to forgive you if you drive while you're tired and get us all killed.\" Joe laughed lightly. \"I suppose you're right.\" He handed her the keys. \"You better get us there okay.\" \"Relax. Contrary to the stereotype, I am a wonderful driver. I have to be if I'm working around you guys all the time. I'd never hear the end of it.\" Joe traded places with Tess and slept in the backseat for the next few hours. Finn rubbed his eyes as he awoke from his own sleep. \"Welcome back to the land of the living,\" Tess said. \"Wait, Joe let you drive the Beast?\" \"What does it look like?\" \"Joe never lets me drive the Beast.\" \"I guess he just loves me more than you. I am a lot more lovable.\" \"Keep telling yourself that.\" Tess looked over at him for a second with a smile. It was nice to be back to their old shameless flirting days. The two of them continued talking with each other for a while as Tess continued down the highway. \"Beast!\" Tobey exclaimed over the radio. \"I need you to meet us at the Bonneville International Speedway and fast!\" Tess picked up the radio. \"Roger that, Beauty.\" \"Tess?! Are you driving the Beast?\" \"Okay, how hard is it to believe that I can drive this truck?\" \"No, it's just that Joe is usually so picky about who drives that thing.\" Tess smirked at Finn. \"So I've heard.\" Finn pulled up the Speedway on the Beast's GPS. \"Get off Exit 4 and then just keep going down.\" \"Exit 4? I'll need to speed things up a little then.\" Tess gunned the gas and sped down the highway. Finn lurched in his seat from the sudden propulsion. She changed lanes several times and maneuvered past all the cars around her. The sudden jerks of the truck caused Joe to wake up in the backseat. \"Tess, what are you doing?!\" \"Hold on,\" Tess smiled. Tess veered off on Exit 4 way faster than anyone should drive on an exit. She was forced to take a hard right which made Finn and Joe smash into the side of the car. She drove down the road for a couple miles before making another hard turn onto the Speedway. Tess floored it down the long road much to the protests of the other passengers. After all, the road came to a complete end after only a couple miles. Finally, Tess slammed on the brakes and swerved the truck at the end of the Speedway just before she hit the water. Joe hopped out of the truck as fast as he could and began inspecting every inch of it. \"Joe, it's a truck,\" Tess said as she and Finn got out. \"Get over it.\" \"That is the last time you drive the Beast,\" Joe told her. \"I'll have you know that you were asleep for almost the entire time I drove! Tobey said we needed to get here fast, so I got here fast! And do you see a single scratch on this truck? I don't think so!\" She hopped up into the bed of the truck then climbed on top and looked up at the sky. \"That cloud kinda looks like a horse,\" she remarked. Finn climbed onto the truck and sat next to her. \"That one looks like a rabbit.\" \"No, it doesn't.\" \"Yeah, see, there's the ears, and there's the tail.\" \"Dude, it looks more like a piece of cotton candy than a rabbit.\" \"You have no imagination.\" Tess scoffed as she looked up again. \"Oh, that one looks like a…car hanging from an army helicopter.\" Joe and Finn looked up and saw a huge army helicopter flying over to them with the Mustang attached to it by a couple of cables hanging down from it. There was only one person who could be capable of that… \"I guess we can't call him Liar One anymore,\" Tess laughed. Tobey stuck his fist out of the passenger window and starting cheering. \"Yeah!\" Finn yelled. \"Whoo!\" \"Yeah, Tobey!\" Joe called. \"Hey, Benny! We believe you, baby! We believe you, Maverick!\" Benny brought the helicopter over to the very end of the Speedway and touched the Mustang down on the ground. \"Look at me!\" Julia screamed excitedly from the driver's seat. \"We're good!\" Tobey called up to Benny. \"Whoo!\" The cables released from the Mustang and the helicopter flew upwards. Tess hopped off the truck and ran over to the Mustang as fast as she could. Tobey got out of the car just as she got over to him and practically tackled him into a huge hug. She firmly wrapped her arms around his neck as he wrapped his arms tightly around her small waist in the first contact they had shared in two years. Everyone smiled as 'brother' and 'sister' were reunited once more. \"Are you guys okay?\" Joe asked as Tess finally released him. \"Yeah,\" Tobey answered. Two army planes soared past the helicopter. \"Looks like I'm gonna have to go away for a while, y'all,\" Benny said from the helicopter. \"But Benny always comes back. Godspeed, boys. Godspeed.\" \"Hey, Tess,\" Tobey smiled. \"Swiped these for you.\" Tess laughed as he tossed her a bag of sour gummy worms. \"You can thank Julia for those.\" \"Thanks, Julia,\" Tess said. She smiled and hugged Tobey again. She had really, really missed him. Tobey looked over at the Mustang that was now caked in red dirt from the previous car chase he and Julia had gone through. \"Well…\" \"Yeah, I mean, we can make a run, but…\" Joe started. Tobey turned back to the others. \"Let's do our best.\" He started to walk away, but Joe stopped him. \"We heard about your cop friend getting chained back in Nebraska.\" \"Benny's gonna be in the brig in about 10 minutes,\" Finn added. \"There's an APB out for your arrest in at least 10 states right now.\" \"What's your point?\" Tobey asked. \"Maybe we should rethink the plan.\" Tobey looked at his fellow team members and at his worn Mustang. He met eyes with Tess, but he couldn't fully read her expression. He then turned back to face Joe. \"Dino took everything from me. From us. Including Pete. Pete got put into the ground, and Dino went off to sunny California like nothing happened. You boys do whatever you think is right…but I'm never gonna stop.\" Tess looked at the others. If she knew one thing, Tobey was going to do this with or without them. And if he was going to do this, she wanted to be there for him. \"We're doing this,\" Tess said, echoing Joe's words two years ago when they were going to work on the Mustang in the first place. \"For Tobey. And for Pete.\" Joe nodded a little. \"For Tobey and Pete.\" \"For Tobey and Pete,\" Finn added.[Chapter 8] Finn fueled up the Mustang again using the pump in the back of the Beast, and then they all hit the road again. Joe got behind the wheel of the Beast, forbidding Tess from driving it again. Tess stretched out across the backseat and opened up her laptop. After setting up a hotspot again on Joe's phone, she left open the video feed from Tobey's Mustang and started researching certain devices that she knew she would need in the very near future. Late that night once the Beast had reached California, a small ding sounded on Tess's computer. \"He just checked in,\" Tess told the others. \"Start time is 9:00 AM, location is Mendocino Highway 85.\" \"So this is really happening,\" Joe said. \"Tobey's finally racing De Leon.\" Tess sighed. \"I really wish Pete were here for this.\" \"Yeah. We all do.\" \"Beast,\" Tobey said over the radio. He let out a painful groan. \"We've been hit.\" \"Wait, what?\" Tess exclaimed. She closed her eyes as realization hit her. \"The bounty…\" Joe picked up the radio. \"All right, we're on our way. We're on our way. Track them.\" \"I'm on it,\" Finn said. He quickly pulled up the Mustang's location on the truck's GPS. \"Where is he?\" \"He's up on California and Mason. Make a left.\" \"Tess, what do you see?\" Tess furiously typed information onto her computer to gain access to the Mustang's video feed again, but all her attempts failed. \"I-I don't know. I-I can't see anything. The camera on the Mustang must've smashed.\" She started breathing quickly, fearing the worst. Joe floored the gas and drove to the crash site as fast as he could. \"Units, be advised, getting report of a vehicle roll-over,\" the police scanner said. \"115 Nob Hill.\" When the Beast turned onto the street, they saw Tobey carrying an unconscious Julia down the road. \"Oh my…\" Tess whispered. \"Open the door,\" Joe ordered. \"We gotta let them in.\" Tess quickly shut her laptop. The Beast slowed and Tess opened the door for him. \"Yo, we gotta move,\" Finn said quickly. \"Cops are coming. Came in over the scanner. We gotta go! Come on, man. We gotta go.\" Tess helped Tobey get Julia into the backseat before he hopped in himself. He held Julia in his arms as he began stroking her hair. Tess looked at her two friends. Tobey's face had a couple of cuts, but Julia had been hit hard. Her face was bleeding heavily and she was drifting in and out of consciousness. Tess held her hand as she looked up at Tobey. She looked out the window and saw the overturned, smashed Mustang with smoke pouring from the destroyed vehicle. It was a miracle they had even survived. \"Tobey, you guys good?\" Finn asked. \"We need a hospital,\" Tobey told him keeping his eyes on Julia. \"Find a hospital,\" Joe said quickly. \"Find a hospital.\" \"I'm working on it,\" Finn answered. He searched for hospitals on the GPS. \"All right, I got a hospital on Hill. Make a left.\" \"Tobey, I'm so sorry,\" Tess said quietly. \"I never thought Dino would go this far.\" The Beast pulled up right in front of the Emergency Room. Finn bolted out of the truck and went over to the paramedics who were walking towards their ambulance. \"Wait!\" he cried. \"We need your help!\" Tobey carefully got Julia out of the truck and carried her over to the awaiting stretcher the paramedics had readied, Joe and Tess right behind him. \"What's her name?\" one of the paramedics asked Tobey. \"Did she ever lose consciousness?\" \"Uh, Julia,\" Tobey answered numbly. \"Yeah, she's-she's been in and out.\" Tess and Finn helped the paramedics push the gurney inside. \"You two stay with her, all right?\" Tobey said. \"We will,\" Finn told him. \"Take care of her.\" Tobey and Joe ran back to the Beast before anyone found out who Tobey was. The last thing they needed at the moment was him getting arrested. \"We need you two to wait out here,\" the paramedic said to Tess and Finn. \"We're going to take a look at her.\" Tess and Finn reluctantly watched Julia get wheeled away before heading over to the Waiting Room. Tess collapsed onto one of the chairs and held her head in her hands. That part of her that had been showing itself ever since Pete's death screamed at her for getting involved with racing again. It berated her for knowing the risks, especially with Dino's arrogance in the way, and getting back together with everyone anyway. The other part of her knew how much fun these past two days had been. It had been exhilarating to strip in the accounting firm with Finn. It had been amazing to tell off her idiot boss and smash his tablet. It had been exciting to help Tobey and Julia escape the cops. It had been fun to talk with Finn and have their infamous banter with one another. It had been thrilling to drive the Beast for the first time. It had been wonderful to eat and sleep normally again. But now sitting in the Emergency Waiting Room, she began questioning if it was all worth it. If they hadn't done this, Julia would be fine and so would Tobey. The cops wouldn't be hunting the two of them down. Sure, they both survived this time, but what about the next psycho who followed Dino's orders? Tess didn't know if she could handle losing Pete and Tobey. Finn came and sat down in the chair next to Tess but didn't say anything. What could he possibly say to her in this kind of situation? He knew how reluctant she had been to get back into the swing of racing, and he couldn't even imagine what was going through her head at the moment. Exhausted from everything that had happened, Tess leaned her head back against the wall and nodded off. Soon, Finn followed suit after watching the most uninteresting news station on the Waiting Room TV. \"Excuse me, who's here for Julia Maddon?\" a nurse asked as she stepped to the Waiting Room. Finn hopped up from his seat which caused Tess to wake up. To her embarrassment, she realized that she had been sleeping on his shoulder. \"We are,\" Finn quickly answered as they both went over to the nurse. \"She's got a broken arm, and we're waiting to give her a CAT scan to further assess the damage.\" \"Can we see her?\" Tess asked. \"We just moved her to Room 104. You can go on back, but she's resting for right now, so please don't disturb her.\" The nurse left, and they both went through the hallways until they found Room 104. Not wanting to wake Julia up, they waited outside her room for Tobey to arrive. It was nearing daylight when he appeared at the end of the hall. He quickly came up to them and gave them both quick hugs. \"How is she?\" Tobey asked. \"Arm is broke,\" Finn answered. \"Waiting on the CAT scan.\" Tobey sighed heavily. Then he slowly opened the door to Julia's room and went inside. \"This is all so messed up,\" Tess sighed. \"It got messed up two years ago and has been messed up ever since.\" Finn sighed. \"I know. I'm gonna go find a bathroom. I won't be long.\" Just a few minutes after Finn left, Tobey exited the room with a small trace of a smile on his face. Tess slowly went up to him. She gently put her hand to his face and lightly ran her finger over his cuts. \"Oh, Tobey…\" \"I'm okay, Tess.\" \"What are you going to do about De Leon now?\" \"I, uh, I found a car.\" \"Where?\" \"Let's just say Anita has decided to reevaluate her relationship.\" He pulled out the large diamond ring she had given him. Tess smiled a little. \"Look, tomorrow, can you just do me a favor and wear an earpiece?\" \"Communication isn't allowed in De Leon.\" \"Tobey, I'm a tech geek.\" She pulled out a small earpiece she had made Joe stop for after they had met up with Tobey on the Speedway. \"This is an undetectable piece of technology. You can hear me and I can hear you. And it's not like I'm going to be feeding you information. It's just that if anything happens, I need to know that you're safe. Please.\" Tobey let out a small sigh. But he knew how worried Tess was about tomorrow, and he didn't blame her. After what had happened with Pete, she didn't want the same thing to happen to him. \"Alright,\" he conceded. Tess smiled again and hugged him tightly. \"Kick his butt.\" Tobey smiled at her and left to prepare for the race. Tess watched him walk down the halls with determination in his step she had never seen before. Then she opened the door to Julia's room and stepped inside. \"Feeling okay?\" she asked. \"I've been better.\" \"That's the thing about Dino. He constantly surprises me with how low he's willing to go to get what he wants. You know, he's my ex-boyfriend.\" \"You dated Dino?! Why?\" \"That's the question of the hour. So how was riding with my big brother for 45 hours straight?\" \"To be clear, he's not actually your brother, right?\" \"No. We're just so close, it's almost like we are brother and sister.\" \"Oh. We had a rough start, but he eventually warmed up to me.\" \"Oh, did he do that thing where he drives around like a complete maniac in the hopes that you'll get out of the car?\" \"Yeah, how'd you know?\" \"They did the same thing to me. I love these guys as if they were family, but their opinion of girls and cars could really stand to get an update.\" There was a pause before she continued, \"You know, Tobey really cares about you. I've never seen him look at someone the way he looks at you.\" Julia smirked. \"I could say the same for you and Finn.\" Tess rolled her eyes. \"You and the rest of the guys. Like I told them, Finn and I are just friends.\" \"Mm-hmm. You don't strip with someone to quit your jobs unless you feel at least a little something towards them.\" \"You do if your boss is an idiot.\" \"Okay,\" Julia said in a sing-song voice that clearly meant she didn't believe her.[Chapter 9] Finn, Tess, and Joe went outside the hospital where Joe had parked the Beast. They pulled up Monarch's webcast on the large screen on the side of the truck so they could follow Tobey's status in the race. Tess put in her earpiece. \"This is, by far, the best De Leon I've ever put together,\" Monarch said excitedly. \"This is my David, man. This is my Pieta. This is my Soup Can.\" \"Tobey, can you hear me?\" Tess asked into her earpiece. \"Loud and clear, Little Sis,\" Tobey answered. \"Good. We're all set up here, so we can see how the race is going. I'll only check in when necessary. You've got this.\" \"We've got our lineup,\" Monarch continued. \"Each driver takes his spot at the starting line. In the first row is English Paul in a Bugatti Veyron and Dino Brewster in his Lamborghini Elemento. Row two is the Gooch in a Saleen S7. Texas Mike is in the McLaren P1. The third row has Johnny V in his GTA Spano. I'm looking at $7 million in cars and thousands of horsepower. Winner takes all. Losers, y'all can walk home. No sign of Tobey Marshall. I don't really know what all that's about, but I…Hold up. Wait, hold on.\" Tobey's new car pulled up into his designated spot. \"Wait a minute, now. A sixth car has just arrived, but I can't, uh…\" The door opened and Tobey stepped out of it. \"Tobey Marshall just stepped out of a red Agera. Well! Maybe the little tart was right about there being three Koenigseggs the day Pete died.\" Tess's mouth dropped open. \"Tobey, you didn't tell me the new car you got was the one from that day two years ago!\" \"Doesn't that just put salt in the wound?\" Tobey answered. Tess smirked. The next time she saw Anita, she was going to hug and praise her for finally seeing Dino for who he truly was and helping them get their revenge. \"You like the car I brought?\" Tess heard Tobey ask Dino over the earpiece. \"Because I know the cops will. Oh, and by the way, I think this belongs to you.\" He tossed Anita's engagement ring through the car window. \"Nice one,\" she said to him. The racers got in their cars and prepared. \"Tobey, you've got this,\" Tess said encouragingly. \"I know you do. Go show them that you don't need to race Indy to be a real racer.\" The cannons boomed and the race began. Tess could hear the engines revving in her ear as all of them took off to be the winner of the famous De Leon race. \"Tobey Marshall and Johnny V are battling for fifth,\" Monarch said, giving the viewers of his webcast a play-by-play. \"You got it, you got it, you got it,\" Joe said as all three of them watched the moving dots on the screen that represented each car. \"And Johnny V is off the road.\" Tobey moved up to fifth place on the side of the board where all the racers names were. \"Tobey Marshall's gonna roll the dice and try to split the Saleen and the P1.\" Tobey's dot moved forward in between the two cars and pushed ahead into the next place. \"And he does it. Ladies and gentlemen, Marshall's guts have just been located and there's a lot of 'em. Texas Mike in the McLaren is now fifth, Tobey is now running fourth. Dino Brewster, you better watch yourself, son.\" The three members of the team watching the Beast laughed as Tobey moved ahead in the race. After all this time, Dino was finally going to get what was coming to him. \"I've got flying cops. I've got flies in the ointment. I got CHP in the air all over the course. You add cops to the race and people get…Racers should race, cops should eat donuts!\" Tess rolled her eyes. The poor guys were just doing their job. And what they were doing was illegal… One of the dots disappeared from the track and the name faded as it got pushed to the bottom on the sidebar. \"The Gooch in the Saleen has been totally taken out. I can't believe what I'm seeing. British Paul holds first, Dino is still in second, Tobey Marshall moves into third.\" \"Yeah, boy,\" Finn said. \"All right, brother, keep it going,\" Joe added. The dots continued speeding down the set track until another one faded and moved down the sidebar. Dino's dot lagged behind the others. \"Uh, I'm hearing over scanners the Bugatti has just got taken out,\" Monarch said. \"Man. Wait a minute…Wait a minute, Tobey Marshall has somehow just taken the lead. Dino Brewster is running last in third place? Are you kidding me?\" \"Yes!\" Finn exclaimed. \"Come on, boy!\" Joe urged. \"Keep it going! Hold that lead! Hold that lead!\" Monarch looked at the camera. \"And then there were three.\" \"Doing great, Big Bro,\" Tess said into her earpiece. \"Keep it up!\" Tobey didn't answer, but Tess didn't want him to. He needed to focus on winning and beating Dino. \"They're coming up to the race marker to the bridge. Tobey is clearly running first. I can't believe it. The blue collar kid from Mount Kisco is trying to wear Cinderella's slipper.\" The three of them cheered and Joe and Finn clapped one another's hands. \"By the way, these cop cars, they top out at about 130.\" \"Hold them back, baby!\" Joe yelled. \"Hold them back!\" \"Good luck catching up, Smokey. I'll tell you who wins.\" The car in second place suddenly faded and joined the others on the sidebar while Dino took the car's place. \"The Elemento just flicked the P1 into a roll. We're down to Tobey Marshall and Dino Brewster. This ain't just about racing.\" \"You bet it isn't,\" Tess muttered. Dino's car sped up to Tobey's. All of them knew Dino wouldn't hesitate to do anything to Tobey's car in order to win, even if it meant killing him. He had proven that two years ago. \"Don't do it,\" Joe said firmly. \"Tobey, don't let him do it.\" Dino's dot sped past Tobey's. To the outsider, it seemed like it was a mistake on Tobey's part. But Tobey didn't make mistakes in racing. He knew that he couldn't have Dino directly behind him. \"Tobey Marshall just let the Elemento get by him,\" Monarch said in disbelief. \"Nice move,\" Joe remarked. \"That kid better wake up. Wake up, Tobey! Wake up and smell that $2 million Lambo in your pocket.\" \"Don't do it, brother. It's not worth it. You can beat him.\" \"Pete,\" Tobey said desperately. \"I need you, pal.\" Tess put her hand to her earpiece. \"I'm here, Tobey…We both are.\" \"Okay, let's go.\" Tobey's dot sped right next to Dino's dot. After a tense few seconds, Dino's name faded. \"Oh, jeez!\" Monarch exclaimed. \"Dino took a swing and missed and flipped the Elemento! Dino Brewster is out! Down goes Dino!\" Joe, Finn, and Tess began cheering and jumping around and hugging one another. This was it. Tobey was going to win the race! \"Tobey is the last man standing! He's gonna win the De Leon! He's gonna win the De Leon! The Marshall kid from Mount Kisco! He's gonna make a milk run to victory! Tobey is the last man standing! He's gonna win the De Leon! I can't believe what I'm seeing! The kid from Mount Kisco! The blue collar kid! Whoo!\" Suddenly, Tobey's dot came to a complete halt. \"Wait! Wait.\" \"What are you doing?\" Finn asked. \"Why are you stopping?\" Joe added. Tobey's dot started going backwards in the direction of Dino's red dot. Tess nodded knowingly. \"He's going back for him,\" she said to the others. \"Why?\" Finn asked. \"Because if he doesn't…he's no better than Dino.\" Tess listened over her earpiece as Tobey ran over to Dino's car and opened it. \"Come on,\" Tobey said. \"Come on.\" There was a small explosion as Dino's car went up in flames. \"Hey, you okay?\" Tobey asked. \"Yeah,\" Dino said coldly. \"I'm fine. I'm fine.\" \"Good. This is for Pete.\" There was the sound of a punch and Tess smiled. \"Give him another one from me, Tobey.\" \"And this is from Tess.\" Another punch sounded on her earpiece. \"Now go win this thing.\" Tobey ran back to the car and Tess could hear the engine revving as he sped off once more. They watched the screen as Tobey's dot began moving again. Finally, the cannons went off as he crossed the finish line at Monarch's lighthouse. Tess moved away from Joe and Finn. \"You did it,\" she said quietly into her earpiece. \"You won.\" \"We did it,\" Tobey answered. \"I'm so proud of you, Tobey. Pete would be too.\" \"I…I'm at the lighthouse.\" \"Just like he saw in his 'vision'. Guess he wasn't so crazy after all.\" \"The cops are right behind me. I'm in a lot of trouble for breaking parole and racing. Looks like I'm gonna have to be separated from you guys for a little longer.\" Tess nodded as her eyes watered. \"They got the evidence now. We've finally proven your innocence. Dino can't fight his way out of this one.\" Tobey sighed. \"Just a few months, okay? I love you, Little Sis.\" \"I love you too, Big Bro.\" Tess heard the car door open. Then there was a sharp crackle as Tobey destroyed the earpiece under his heel and buried the remains in the gravel. She quickly wiped away the tears on her cheeks before Finn and Joe noticed. Then she walked back over to them and looked at the screen on the Beast. \"Well, now, hold on, cretins,\" Monarch said. \"I'm hearing over the scanners that the Koenigsegg does indeed belong to Dino, and that's the missing evidence that killed Pete. Huh. Well, then it looks like Dino, Dino bambino is going away for a long, long time. Well, kiddos, it looks like Tobey himself is gonna enjoy three hots and a cot in the pokey for illegal street racing. Mmm, mmm, mmm. I don't know, Tobey. A few months in jail to prove your innocence. Was it worth it, kid?\" Joe and Finn hugged each other again, elated at Tobey's victory and Dino's defeat. Tess was silent, but they knew she truly was excited that her 'brother' had finally won the race they always dreamed of him winning.[Chapter 10] That night, Joe, Finn, and Tess rented two rooms at a motel on their way back to New York. Julia told them she was going to get a car from Ingram once she was discharged from the hospital and work with him until Tobey was released from prison in six months. There was a knock on Tess's motel room door late into the night. She got up from her bed and went to go answer it. There stood Finn. \"Hey,\" she said with a small smile. \"What's up?\" \"Just watching some Parks and Rec .\" He looked at her newest pack of sour gummy worms she was eating out of. \"They had some in the vending machine around the corner. I bought three.\" Finn smirked a little. She ate so many of those things, he often wondered how she hadn't gotten diabetes yet. She had changed into a pair of gym shorts and another oversized t-shirt. Her hair had been tossed up into a messy bun. She didn't look extravagant at all. Yet he still found his breath hitching in his throat. When he looked up at her, he noticed just how red her eyes were. It was clear she had been crying for some time. \"Are you okay?\" he asked. Tess scoffed. \"I'm fine.\" Finn stepped inside as she moved back over to her bed. \"Tess, I know we only really joke around, but really…are you okay?\" Tess was silent for a few moments before she turned to him. \"I'm furious with Tobey for racing again. I mean, I know that it was really the only way that we could prove his innocence and get justice for Pete, but…I just got him back. And now he's gone again. I know it's only for six months, but that's six more months that I don't get to see him and spend time with him.\" Finn looked at her sadly. Tess had been silent for the entire car ride to the motel, listening to her headphones and staring out the window. He knew from the start that she was upset about Tobey going to prison again. He and Tobey were best friends, but Tobey and Tess shared a different kind of bond with one another. They were closer than actual brothers and sisters. She had barely gotten to see him in the past three days after not being able to see him for two years. And now she was right back where she started. Last time, Finn hadn't been there for her when she needed someone the most. But he was not going to let that happen again. He smiled a little as he came up to her. \"I've got a way to make you feel better. Come on.\" He took her hand and led her out of her room. \"Where are we going?\" Finn didn't answer her. He led her around the motel and towards the outdoor pool. After opening the gate, he escorted her inside. \"Finn, I don't have the proper attire for this.\" \"Who cares?\" She looked over to find him coming towards her with a devious smile. \"No. No, Finn, I'm in my clothes. Don't! No, Finn—!\" She was cut off as Finn pushed her into the pool. When she surfaced, he whipped off his shirt and laughed as he did a cannonball next to her. She shielded herself from the splash. He started laughing again as he came back up. \"I hate you!\" Tess exclaimed. Finn splashed her which forced her to retaliate. That beautiful music reached his ears again and it sounded even better than before. He went underwater and swam over to her. Before she knew what he was doing, he grabbed her foot and pulled her under with him. Tess then swam over to him and pushed his head under. He slipped an arm under her knees and another around her waist and began carrying her around in the water as her arms encircled his neck. There was silence between them, the only sound being the light splash of the pool water. Finn drew closer…and closer to her… \"Excuse me, the pool's closed,\" the one of the employees said sharply to the two of them. \"Find somewhere else to make out.\" Tess pressed her lips together in embarrassment as they swam over to the ladder. She got out of the pool first followed by Finn. They held in their laughter until they were out of the pool area and away from the stiff employee. \"Thanks,\" Tess said as they started walking back to her room. \"I really needed that.\" \"Sorry we couldn't be in there longer.\" \"Hey, if that guy wasn't such a stick in the mud, we probably would've been fine.\" They made it to her door, and Tess walked inside. \"Good night, Finn.\" \"Night.\" Tess took a quick shower and changed into a tank top and some sweatpants. She had just finished drying her hair when there was a knock on the door again. As soon as she opened it, Finn took her head in his hands and pressed his lips to hers. Tess tensed up in surprise. When Finn pulled away, she looked at him with wide eyes. Then she went up to him and kissed him again. All the anger and hurt she was feeling melted away as their lips danced across one another. Joe walked back from the Beast towards his and Finn's room when he passed Tess's open door and saw her kissing Finn. He smiled and made a triumphant fist before walking into his own room. \"How you doing, Little Sis?\" Tobey asked from the other side of the glass. \"I'm not bad. I've got so much I wanna tell you!\" \"How about you start by telling me about you and Finn?\" Tess rolled her eyes. \"How'd you find out?\" \"Joe told me when he visited. I heard it was the night of the race?\" \"Yeah. I was in a really rough spot that night after everything that happened, and…he was there for me.\" \"It's about time.\" Tess laughed lightly. \"Whatever. I have some good news. Anita helped me get onto Dino's server. I sold everything in his garage. So he's in for a fun surprise when and if he ever gets out of prison. And since I did it from his computer, there's no way it can be traced back to me.\" Tobey laughed. \"I knew you wouldn't let him go that easily.\" \"The profits all went to getting your garage up and running again. Joe, Finn, and I are going to keep it running until you're out. Uh, we changed the name of it. It's now Marshall and Coleman Motors.\" Tears came to Tobey's eyes. \"It's great, Tess. Pete would be thrilled.\" \"Yeah. I miss him.\" \"I do too.\" \"Stay safe in there, okay?\" \"I will.\" \"Love you, Big Bro.\" \"Love you too, Little Sis.\" \"See you in a couple months.\" Tobey walked out of the California jail a free man. When he looked down the road, he saw a bright red Mustang driving up to the entrance. It stopped right in front of him. He looked inside the window to find Julia in the driver's seat. \"Get in!\" she told him. \"I'll drive.\" \"I've seen you drive, and it's terrifying.\" Tobey walked over and got into the driver's seat as Julia squeezed over to the passenger's side. The two of them shared a loving look with one another. Finn imitated kissing from inside the Beast. \"Come on, lovebirds. We need to get Benny out of the clink.\" \"Maverick is getting out for good behavior,\" Joe told them. \"Yeah, apparently he started some fitness program for the inmates or something.\" \"I've got a way we can kill time on the way there,\" Tess said from the middle seat in the back. She turned Finn's head to her and kissed him. She continued kissing him as she moved from the backseat into his lap in the passenger seat. \"Ugh, get a room,\" Joe complained. Tobey smiled. \"Finn, you're my best friend, but if you break her heart, I'll break your neck.\" Everyone laughed, but no one doubted that Tobey would stay true to those words. \"We got five hours to get to Utah,\" Joe said. \"Let's go.\" The Mustang and the Beast took off on the ultimate race that they all loved so much: the race against time. ","Summary":" Because this category needs a finished story, and I love Finn. \"Give me four clicks of compression"},{"Movie":"21 Jump Street","Title":"Without problem ? More or less -English version-","Author":"Gloomy-Coco","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9004026","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Blabla: well this is my first English fic ! I'm little excited and afraid, because English is not my native language and some sentences in French are not translate in English. Anyway I hope you like it. Tell me more ! Blabla 2 : I'm the only one who see the scene between Jenko et Erik during the party ? No way ! This story contains slash and relationship between man/man . Now you know ! Main pairing : Jenko/Erik Special thank you to my beta! (Chouby ) Prologue \"Erik… Please\" \"Why? Don't tell me that you don't feel the pool too…\" \"It's not that…\" Erik slid closer to Jenko and blew against his neck, brushing him lightly. The older held himself for dear life but he was mere seconds from pouncing on the other. Oh God how he wanted to bend the younger over the couch and snog him for all his worth. And that was exactly what he shouldn't do ! Resist Jenko, resist man, you can do it! \"Brad…\" And now he was using that honey-silked voice, molding is young body to him. Whispering crudely what he would like to do with him. Jenko never thought someone like him could say these things aloud. Well, for his age he wasn't all white and fluffy, but still. The younger was rilling him up and he wasn't unaffected. Judging by the growing bulge in his pants. \"Oh I see that you're feeling the heat…\" Erik said, smirking at him. For Jenko that was the straw, the line had been crossed ages ago and he was mere instants - yes instants - before he would tip. And there was nobody to distract him for getting out of trouble. He jerked out of the other's embrace, startling Eric. He started pacing the room like a caged animal. \"Erik, I really can't! What will Doug thing of this !?\" \"I don't see what business Doug has here…\" Erik replied bewildered, and somehow disappointed. \"Well, if you take it like this.\" The young man got up from the couch, going towards the exit door. On his way there he stopped and got on his tippy toes, flush against Jenko. \"Pity though.\" he breathed once more, against the older's already sensible neck. Stepping back and giving him a heated stare. The one that had been driving the policeman crazy for the last months. \"Fuck it\" Jenko snapped. It was all Erik could register before he was thrown against the wall and the older crashed his lips to his. Somewhere in the back of his mind, Jenko knew he was probably going to get into big troubles for this. Problably going to get evicted from the case. But all thoughts flew away when he heard the groan surging from the student. Fuck![Chapter 2] thank you to my Beta and sorry for the late! but I wanted to finish the French version before :) Hope you like it ! A High School like no other Jenko was rather enthusiastic of the mission that they had been given him and Schmidt. Infiltrate a high school and dismantle a drug trafficking. What he especially like about this mission was obviously that they had to go back to high school. High school, an era that seemed so far away but so close too because he had kept only good memories of it. Perhaps not for Schmidt but that, was another story… Surely the first day he screwed up by hitting the kid, but how could he know he was gay eh ? In his time, well when he was at high school, gay people… could be spotted ... right away … Far from being cliché but let's call a cat, a cat. And now he paid more or less the consequences, he had to follow science course. Saying he wanted to shoot himself was the least of it. He just wanted to jump out of a window. Already a month, and the two infiltrated agents had no lead. Captain Dickson had been clear, \"infiltrate the dealers and find the suppliers\", no more no less. They still had to find the suppliers, it wasn't that easy a fit. Jenko thought those nerds from science could help him get a lead, but no luck there. They were quite difficult to get close to. Well there was Curly Hair, what was his name already? Zack? But he hadn't got any information yet. \"Brad, please, can you come help me to put up the projector?\" Jenko gained focus and looked around. Why him?! His teacher was looking at him with a big smile, fluttering here eyelashes. Mme Griggs, from the first day she had been on him, and she wasn't discreet at that. And nobody in his class was saying anything. It's true that he stood out in this class full of nerds. He was seductive, enough to die for actually but that wasn't an excuse! He was supposed to be 18, had she no shame? He got up and went to the teacher who was holding the projector, she handed it to him making sure to graze his fingers suggestively. \"Miss…\" said Jenko uncomfortable. \"Yes Brad?\" Should he just tell her like that? He turned to the class and saw that the other were looking past it like there was nothing going on. Hello! Someone help!? \"No… No nothing…\" \"Great, you can prop it here\" Jenko sighed, but he installed her thing with a big fat fake smile. Schmidt's job was to infiltrate the band of cool people. These peoples noticed them since the first day, and unfortunately Jenko had punched one of them. Oh how bad a start of the year was that. Jenko and his thoughtless action… Schmidt could write a novel out of those. However in the past years he could say that Jenko had become his best friend, they were one side of the same piece. Schmidt the brains, and Jenko the muscles. A great team, but a team who wasn't going anywhere with their case. Schmidt had theatre class. The kind of activity he already didn't like in high school but now it was even worst! Because he had no choice but to attend. But he wasn't complaining, Molly was in these lessons too. This young blonde with not such a fancy style, not really sexy either, but who immediately caught the eye of the policeman. But he wasn't allowed to cross that line. Plus she already had a boyfriend. He's been in those classes with her for a month already but he hadn't got up and talked to her yet. But today he would make that change, maybe she would give him some information too ... \"Hey!\" Molly turn over and just stared at him. Here goes nothing! \"I… I know that you don't know me and that other people think…\" Schmidt kept stuttering. Molly was looking at him with no real interest but the policeman kept going. However in the end, Schmidt succeeded and got not only the dealer's number but also smile from Molly! Finally a head start! They will be able to move on now. He rapidly sent a text to Jenko. He still had trouble with this sms thing. No, he wasn't old fashioned but a call was frank and direct unlike a texted message. Well, that's what he thought. When Jenko received the text, he thought that finally the cavalry was here! He said a big fuck you at his exam without regret, obviously. And his teacher was still trying to seduce him shoving her ass in his face, and again nobody to see! When he'll quit this high school, he would show them through simple that their teacher was paedophile. Or maybe he'd just arrest her. That's a better idea… But no time to dwell on that, he quickly left the classroom to join his teammate in the hallway. They ran towards the computer room, Schmidt telling Jenko how he got the number, not telling him about Molly of course. What a surprise when they discovered who was the dealer in this high school. Head of jocks. Erik.[Chapter 3] Where Schmidt and Jenko take the HFS and Jenko meets Erik totally by chance ... An eventful beginning What Jenko didn't except, as didn't Schmidt, it's that when he'll see Erik to get some information on the trafficking, they would have to take drugs. Ok ! They had to buy some, but certainly not consume and especially not in front Erik. But the worst of it, they didn't think they would have to go through the 5 steps of HFS and the results were rather … eventful. Between the beginning where they had tried to get each other to throw up - a nightmare - and then when they saw the teacher during the first two steps, Jenko couldn't decide what was worst. After that, the two cops got split, Jenko went back to class and showed through a series of «4 » how molecules were bound together, and he finished with a big « fuck you », extremely proud of what he done. Schmidt, wasn't any better. He took part in the school's athletics team training, and inevitably it was a mess. However Erik's band noticed him. Jenko fished Schmidt out of the lake at the end of day. « What the hell went on ? » Schmidt looked at Jenko sitting next to him « we'll be lucky not to get fired. » « I don't know… » Jenko had his head in his hands, and was trying to somehow recover from the last emotions. « Hahahah you guys rock ! » The two cops looked up to see Erik, big smile, followed by his band mates. Jenko raised his head to meet the eyes of Erik who held his stare. « Dudes, you're so cool ! » Molly said laughing, taking with her, her boyfriend and the rest of the hoard. « Dude, you heard that ?! » Said Schmidt happy « we are cooooool ! » But Jenko wasn't listening, still watching Erik who was looking back from times to times. What was happening ? « I don't understand this high school » There was one thing that Jenko had noticed since he was in this high school, it was that this Erik had been watching him. Was he suspicious of something ? He had already called them \"cockroaches\" when they came to collect the drugs, asking them if they were cops and yes, they had freaked out. But even before that, he had felt the glances that were not so discreet… . . . Two days later, Jenko and Schmidt had to make a report to Dickson, as expected it went bad. They had drawn up a dashboard, a rather good one too, a bit like in the detective series, with colorful lines and pictures. It had impressed even themselves but unfortunately their leader wasn't of the same opinion. Dickson laughed at them and got angry asking if they had found the suppliers. To add to that, Fugazy and her teammate bragging to them about the investigation they had just wrapped. Cool. Finaly Jenko took the decision to focus once again on the science club. These pimply nerds could still teach him something right? Schmidt was doing a good job well and it started to get on his nerves. But speaking to them, and forcing his way into the classroom, the only thing Jenko learned was that they liked to play Bakugan and one of them could track cellphones. Cool ... « Let's throw a party !\" Was the idea Schmidt came up with at lunch. Jenko looked at him, not really getting it. \"Shouldn't we just infiltrate them ? \"Replied the tallest glancing at the table wherer Erik's band was sitting. He was surprised to meet the eyes of the younger, grinning at him. \"Are you listening to me !?\" Jenko turned his attention to his colleague. What was happenning to him ... ? \"No, a party will be just the perfect thing, I'll tell Molly who'll tell Erik ect ect\" \"What about your parents? \" \"Don't worry about it! \" Instead Jenko had every reason to worry, even though the evening was the golden opportunity to put a tracker in Erik's cellphone. In the evening, Jenko decided to go out for a bit and let Schmidt handle things for the party with Molly. He didn't really want to be there. And a little bit of jogging wouldn't be too much right now. He got dressed quickly and after telling Schmidt's parents that he was going out, he left the house. The couple were quite the über-dotting parents, they were taking him as their son too. Otherwise they were lovely, no doubt about it. After thirty minutes he stopped near a gas station, a beer would do him good. Jenko came into the station, took a beer can, paid and left quickly. \"Brad ?\" Jenko stopped short from taking a big gulp of his beer. Shit ... Erik was there at the station for a refill. What a strange coincidence ...! They stared at each other for a moment, Jenko didn't know what to say that could get him out of this uncomfortable situation. \"You old enough to buy alcohol ? \"erik asked, gesturing to the beer. \"Haha ... no ... You know ... Fake ID\" He said as an excuse, but this kid was a little too smart for him. erik finished refilling and walked past Jenko to pay. \"You buying me a beer ? \" Shit ! Once payment for the refill and the pack of beer, erik suggested he the officer. On their way there they stopped at a park \"It doesn't surprise me, you having a fake ID. You like a guy who'd do anything to get what you want. \" Erik said amused, taking a large sip. \"I don't know what you're talking about ...\" Jenko avoided his eyes. \"I felt that since the day I met you !\" \"Look, I'm sorry for that time, I didn't know ... How could I know he was gay?\" erik laughed out loud when he slumped against the backrest of the bench. \"It is not me you should say that to but Tommy! \" \"You people are weird in this school ...\" Erik stared at him, and sighed before continuing: \"You know, Brad, I'm sorry ... You and I, we didn't start on the right foot didn't we ?\" There were few people in the park at this time, a lot of people walking their dogs, kids smoking weed thinking no one could see them. Erik had scooted close to Jenko on the bench, the later felt it and turned to him surprised \"I would not have given you HFS like that, knowing that we were still in school but it was too tempting! \" \"You got us in trouble anyway! I don't even know why the Principal didn't get us kicked. \" \"Maybe because he didn't hear about this ...\" \"Oh yeah? With all the mess that I and Sch ... Doug did, I don't see how! Doug ended up in the lake. \" \"Oh, believe me, he did not hear. Am I forgiven? \" Erik had that smile on again, that warm inviting smile he gave only to Jenko. The officer swallowed. He was not blind, he could see that the student was flirting with him and he couldn't deny it, erik was cute and charming. But he wasn't even 18 yet so stop! Jenko was of this kind of person people liked to call bisexual. Even though he was, he wasn't a pedophile ! This school was making him go crazy. He took a deep breath and stood up, creating some distance between him and. Suddenly Erik's phone rang. The later excused himself before answering, but his expression was revealing, it couldn't be good ... \"Yes ... Ok, I'll be right there! \" erik stood up and lead to his car \"I'll drop you off ?\" Jenko needn't be said twice, but he remained silent. He should seriously think about this ... Once home, he went to Schmidt's room to annoy him! What a surprise seeing that he was still on the phone with Molly, it was just too tempting. Ending his call he turned to Jenko angrily: \"Dude ! Where the hell were you? \" \"Nowhere, just took a little lap. \" Schmidt looked at him suspiciously, before shrugging and leaving the room at the call of his mother. Jenko sighed before throwing himself on his mattress. He began to think about erik and how they had said goodbye... Shit ![Chapter 4] A/N : First, i'm sorry for being late. I sent my english version to my beta, and she took some time to fix it. Because well... i'm really bad to write in english. Second,i'm not really aware about american basketball team and their name. So i'm sorry about this ! :( Where Erik offer a night out to Jenko A Dangerous Game A few days passed, and the investigation slowly advanced. The two cops particulary gave their all in learning more during the party. Meanwhile, Jenko kept hanging out with the nerds. In fact he was suprised to see that he could actually stay with them. They weren't bad guys but, as he learned at the police academy : you must be able to adapt whatever the situation is. Yeah, though he knew he wouldn't have been able to do such a thing back in high school. However, there was one thing that made him increasingly uncomfortable and not knowing what to do. He should talk to Schmidt maybe, but he was afraid that his teammate won't undestand the situation. Or have him explain that it was just a phase, just like him and Molly. Yeah... That he couldn't comprehend. Seriously ? Molly ! Not only she was a kid, but she really had nothing special. He would have understood if it had been Kat, one of the pompom girls. A pretty brunette, with perfect measurement. But Molly… Well, it's Schmidt that we're talking about, nothing to wonder about. So, Molly was average and no need to say that she never tried to hit on his colleague, not as Erik. The later wasn't even discreet anymore. When Jenko had the misfortune to pass by him in the hallway, the young dealer always jumped on the opportunity to shove him against a wall and talk to him. Although we could not clearly call it flirting, there still was something in his eyes that meant... everything . Jenko was totally taken aback, still Erik was someone interesting. He was the president of the journal club and was a fan of the Atlantic, the basketball team of the city. He loved traveling and cooking. Italian food was his speciliaty, he also hinted that he'll cook for Jenko one day. To that the officer had answered that pizza was enough for him. He should have stay silent. Jenko got out of the chemestry class a bit tired, following the small group and his bag hanging at his shoulder. He had tried to understand the course about molecular fractions, but yeah, taking a bullet would have been easier. The program of today's students was quite high... or maybe he was a total dumbass. He preferred the first option. \"Brad! We're going to the rest room for a Beyblade game, you come with us? \"Zack asked while stepping out the classroom. \"No, he's already taken . \" The small group turned and saw Erik in front of them, a small smile on his face. Jenko stared at him, but he had no time to say something, the others had already left. \"Taken? \" Finally replied the policeman raising his eyebrows. \"Well yes ... \" said Erik. Then he showed two tickets. \"Two tickets for Atlantic against Eagles DC\" \"And? \" \"And... I thought we could go together? \" Pushed Erik crossing his arms, still smiling. \"Well, why not?\" Said Jenko without thinking. He recovered quickly though, when something crashed in his head, \"but the Atlantic's game is today! And in two hours right ? \" Erik shrugged : \"So what? Believe me, I had been struggling to dig up these tickets. \" Around them, the students continued their come and go. Jenko looked around him. Where was Schmidt when we needed him the most? He really wanted to go to the basketball game though. The Atlantic against the Eagles, a qualitative match for the regional championship! Two great teams none the less. The only black spot were the lessons. If he skipped and was caught, he would be in big trouble. Furthemore, he had a class with the Other. She would notice that he was absent, for sure. While Jenko was deep in his thought, Erik kept staring at him nervously : \"Something's wrong? Don't tell me you're afraid to skip!\" \"But I can't! And why don't you take Molly, or one of your buddies huh? \" Erik looked at him straight in the eyes, he was getting close, too close , then he say softly: \"Because I want to go with you .\" Jenko shivered. This kid was eighteen and offering him a date. Dammit! The ring pulled him out of his reverie, he couldn't afford to get into trouble just for a basketball game, even if he awfully wanted to go ! \"What class do you have? \" \"Mrs. Griggs and believe me, she'll notice it pretty soon if I'm not there\" \"That's the science teacher right? Ok. Wait here for me. \" Then he took the direction of the class room, he turned and made a sign to Jenko not to move. However, the policeman didn't take long before seeing Erik back to him, smiling. Had he managed to negotiate? Or something like that? Jenko was already suspecting that the young man had a contact with the school principal or the administration. He had him say so during one of their conversations. But anyway he will have the opportunity to ask him later. \"So? \" Asked the policeman. \"Well, we can go, I don't want to miss the beginning of the game\" And Erik walked towards the exit. Thus, Jenko caught his arm, frowning. \"What about Griggs? \" \"It's ok. Maybe if we get close enough I'll tell you my secret, but for now, let's go shall we? \" \"Your car or mine? \" \"I saw that you own a rather luxurious one, despite the CO2 emissions and the dangers it can ...\" Jenko interrupted the young man by pulling him by the arm. Maybe this afternoon would do him good, and then it will allow him to get closer to Erik. Only in the professional way, of course ! The game of Atlantic against Eagles DC was beyond their expectations. Synchronised, exciting with two teams whom gave their all and so many dunks. Both teams were known for their very tall players, as well as their many 3-point baskets. Sitting on the front row, they had been able to watch the best of the game, and Jenko loved to discuss with Erik on the various techniques of the players. The young dealer was passionate. Jenko watched him smiling gently while Erik shared his thoughts on the latest action, however, when their gaze met, Erik never let it go. They looked with a smile as the crowd cheered a player behind them. Jenko felt his heart beating too fast, then Erik rewarded him again with that warm smile of his, which only him had the secret. Only the whistle managed to pulled them out of their world. No word was exchanged after that. The match ended with the victory of the Atlantic. The team had trouble pulling this victory. While Erik and Jenko were getting out of the building, still dazed by the good game they had just seen, the police received a phone call: Schmidt. \"Yes? \" \" Dude, where are you ? Someone told me that you had to leave urgently because the volunteer firefighters needed you? \" Jenko turned to Erik with a darting glance, this one looked Jenko back before shrugging innocently as if he was aware of nothing. Little liar. \" Dude since when you're part of the firemen ... Anyway, where are you? \" His teammate went on, on the phone. Should he said that he had skipped classes to go see a game with Erik? Jenko knew his teammate, he wouldn't take the news lightly, more like if Jenko had betrayed him or something that comes close. That's when Erik took the opportunity to move close to him, in his personal space. Jenko looked him up, Erik and his fucking smile that disturbed him. Fuck \" Jenko? \" \"I ... I had to leave. Came back at home as you can! I'll call you later! \" \" What? Well, but ... \" And he cut the conversation. Erik was always close to him, which made him take a step back. Was the young man really aware of what he was doing? Erik kept observing him a moment without asking what his brother wanted - because he was convinced that Erik perfectly knew that it was Schmidt on the phone. Jenko was going to say something when someone hailed the young dealer behind. The officer turned to see in front of him one of the players of the Atlantic, a young African American of his size. The player approached Erik before taking him in afraternal embrace. \"Pete! Very good game, not easy to face the Eagles but good job \"Erik was happy to see the newcomer. \"Thanks man! I'm glad you came ... and not alone . \" The tall Pete turned to Jenko and gave him a grin. Jenko looked at him stunned. Had he missed something ? Erik kept looking at him intently before speaking: \"Pete, meet Brad McQuaid, my boyfriend. \" Uh? Wait. WHAT? Jenko had his mouth wide open while Pete looked him up and down before taking Erik aside to speak about a few things. The policeman watched them ... Stop! Erik did not just introduced him as his... no way! ! He had misunderstood, hadn't it? After ten minutes, the player took his leave but not without greeting Erik with a new fraternal embrace then turning to Jenko to shake his hand. However, he turned a last time towards the two men to shout : \"You have good taste, my friend! \" Erik pointed his thumbs up to approve. It was too much for the policeman. He threw himself on Erik a moment after, pulling him by the shoulders: \"What was that? You ask me to skip school to come to see a basketball game ... \" \"Don't tell me you didn't like? \"Interrupted the youngest. \"... Then you introduced me to one of your friends as ... as your boyfriend ? Not to mention the last few days. What are you looking for exactly? What is wrong with you !\" Erik's arrogant smile was gone. It was as if he dared not to say what he wanted, what he was keeping from Jenko. Jenko continued to look at him intently though, but Erik remained silent. \"Just... to know you.\" Replied the youngest after a moment. \"Know me ... by acting like that ? \" No, he would not say ' by hitting on me'. Erik shrugged his shoulders again, but soon his arrogant smile reappeared, he took advantage of the fact that Jenko had stuck him to turn the situation to his advantage. He put both hands on the policeman's hips who instantaly froze. Then he got close, against him even, and looked up. \"Yeah, you know... to learn more about you» Then he stood on the tip of his feet and moved his face to Jenko's. As for the policeman, he was paralyzed. Yes it was obvious that Erik was going to kiss him soon, moreover he was now in his arms... No, correction, Erik had pressed himself against him! There was the difference ! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! He had to stop it! Immediately! He swallowed before pushing the younger gently, straightening him by the shoulders. He lowered his head to take a breath. Damn, he almost gave in! \"No!\" Then he looked down at Erik whose face was... blank. Merely, as if he was disappointed. But Jenko knew he had well done. \"Aren't you supposed to have a girlfriend? \" \"Who? Molly? \" Erik suddenly laughed. \"Not really. She does what she wants as I do what I want. And do you think I didn't notice how your brother's attached to her? As for me ... \" He leaned back on Jenko to kiss him quickly, leaving no time for the officer to act: \"I always get what I want! \" And at this he was gone, hands in pockets, leaving a stunned Jenko, totally dumbfounded and gaping. What should he do now seriously? The officer ran a hand over his face. He was totally lost. Thanks for the reviews, and people who read this ! wow thank you ![Chapter 5] Let's get the party starting The preparation of the party was fast enough, as Schmidt had thought, the rumour had well circulated. Molly had spoke of it around her, to Erik, to Tommy - yes the policer had finally managed to remember the names of the little gang around. And very quickly, half of the school was aware of it. However, who said good party, said alcohol, things to smoke and especially good music. The first two were pretty easy to get and with little trouble. A trip to the Liquor store, to provide a barrel and no need to show their IDs. As for drugs, a ride at the police reserve and it was completed. However they had hesitated between weed or cocaine, but hey, it was kids we were talking about, and they did not forget it ... They were not going to add more problems to their situation. They had already violated several rules of Dickson, better not push further. As for Schmidt's parents, they were easily expelled , which astonished Jenko. One had offered them a night out in the city and they hardly complained. If it had been his folks, Jenko would have had to negotiate and still without the certainty that his father would have falled into the trap due to his military education. After having check that they had everything that they needed, they began to prepare various drinks with rhum and observed out of the corner of his eye his teammate, this one was lost in his thought. He had noticed that recently Jenko was acting weird and getting pretty close to Erik. He wondered how, moreover. He had happened to see Erik and Jenko discussed within the school's corridors: Jenko at his locker, storing his notebooks and Erik chatting by his side. Had they became friends? But Schmidt had noticed something else, the young dealer often observed his teammate. Perhaps had he suspected that Jenko was a policeman. The young man was smart ... handsome and too smart . A ringing phone drew him out of his thoughts: it was Jenko's phone. Schmidt saw the fond smile the taller had when he looked at the name of the person who called. A girlfriend? Jenko excused himself before leaving the room and going into the garden. A private conversation? Ok, now Schmidt wanted to know! Jenko had a girlfriend and he didn't even tell him? How had he managed to find one anyway? Even though that was Greg Jenko we talked about, the guy who, back in high school had all the girls he wanted... even if he couldn't go to the prom. Schmidt approached the garden to spy. He saw Jenko pacing, a nervous hand in his hair, but a small smile on his face: \"So you can jump on me like the last time? No I'll pass. \"He heard and then Jenko laughed. \"No, I'm busy, I have to help Doug tonight, I remind you that this is my house too. \" Schmidt keep observing. Jenko seemed nervous, like himself was with Molly. Had he really found a girlfriend? He'd just call him by his fake name, so it has to be someone from high school. Despite what Dickson had formally told. Jenko, however, was someone who respected the rules. Who could it be? The person would probably be there tonight, he'll just have to track him. Jenko returned a moment later, and told his teammate he was going out, something he forgot it seemed. Schmidt didn't pushed further. This story intrigued him, but he stopped thinking about it the moment he he received a new text from Molly. Oh Molly ... . . . When the evening came, the party went in full swing! The two teammates were rather proud of them, they had managed to bring a lot of people. The word to mouth had really be effective. They were now surrounded by a tribe of high school students drinking, smoking, dancing, kissing and probably making love somewhere in the house. But Jenko didn't know that. He saw in a corner of the kitchen the Nerds starting to warm up for the party, and he continued to observe the small world quietly while drinking his beer. There were pretty girls who didn't hesitate to wink at him and some looking even more suggestive. Not that surprinsing with the way they were dressed. Even if he were able play with some of them, he only had in mind a certain dealer. He took a huge sip to forget. Erik, besides being beautiful and smart, was also especially tough. After the basketball game, Erik was left with his friend – Pete the player. It was not that bad in the end, Jenko wouldn't have seen himself stuck in in a car with the high schooler after what had just happened. He had let him kiss him after all! And he did like it ... Eventually he ended up in a bar, where he had drank to his heart content, and then he'd met Kat? Or Leen? He couldn't remember the name, but before returning to the Schmidts he had managed to finish the evening in good company. The next day Erik came to apologize and to make amends invited him - again - at the restaurant. An Italian restaurant, whose owners knew him well enough. Erik hadn't tried anything during their night out, they had discussed and learned to know each other. Jenko discovered, in addition to what he already knew, that Erik was often home alone because his parents had hardly the time to worry about him and that he was dealing because he was bored. A very lonely boy, who hid this side of him behind big smiles and charms. Jenko saw Schmidt approaching him so he put his beer in a corner: \"Erik isn't coming? \" \"Do we still have some chips? \"Asked Jenko not wanting to think about him now. \"Is it your playlist? To dance? \"He went on his way into the living room while the nerds used the famous vase of the policeman's mother to drink. « Doug Doug !» « Hey Paul, Blart, Molly, Cop ! » Jenko turned his head to see the small gang of Erik came in, as if they owned the place. He nodded a little at the group of nerds to report that their target had arrived. Tonight he had to put a chip in Erik's phone so he could track his conversation in the future and get close to the supplier. He hadn't talk to Schmidt about that, yes, but he would later. He approached the small group while Molly introduced Schmidt to Erik, then the latter turned to Jenko who suddenly pulled him in his arms. To that, Erik had a look of surprise mixed with embarrassment. Indeed, Jenko had never so far shown any sign of interest toward Erik. Jenko stepped back but the youngest didn't take his eyes away from him and gave him a questioning look. Molly began to speak about the mainstream decoration of the house, Indian influence she said. The taller of the policeman was so eager to shut her off: it's better than your style, look in the mirror before you start talking next time . But he refrained. He must get his hand on that phone first. He made a second signal to the group while Zack pushed him against Erik so he can get the phone and quickly go in the room. Erik made a surprised move before watching Jenko leave, somewhat annoyed at the older's behavior: \"Your brother sucks. \" he said to Schmidt, always looking towards the stairs. \"Worse\" added Tommy, always vindictive of his first meeting with Jenko. Schmidt tried with difficulty to pacify the tensions and to persued them to stay by offering to visit the house. At the same time, Jenko and his small group were trying to install the chip, but Jenko was afraid that Erik decides to leave. Erik had warned him this afternoon that if he came, he wouldn't stay long, even if he could make an exception if Jenko insisted. However, it was out of the question that Jenko begs the youngest. He was a cop and he would get what he wanted. But things did not go as planned. While Zack had almost finished to implanted the chip, Jenko heard loud noises coming from the living room. He went down and saw Schmidt busy fighting students? In their living room? And without thinking he threw himself on the first comer. No way was he going to let these guys come in the party, fuck things up, without doing anything. And hell with the fact that he had hit a minor, they had it coming! Not like one of Dickson's agents were here anyway. The issue ended with Schmidt sliced in the back and everyone shouting in glee when Jenko removed the piece of glass. Students nowdays... But at least, Zack had been able to finish to put the chip and Jenko had put back the phone in Erik's pocket as if nothing happened. While the party continued and everyone was dancing and having fun, Jenko landed on the stairs and was about to light a joint. An eternity since the last time he smoke and it was an opportunity to be able to taste it again. As he took his first hit, he saw Erik, glass in hand sitting next to him on the stairs. \" Who would have thought that your brother could organized insane parties ! \" Jenko smoked again before passing the joint to Erik who took it with a 'thanks': \"Who were these guys anyway? \"Asked the policeman. \"Guys who want to share the market I suppose.\" Erik was smoking, trying to make circles with the smoke. Jenko took a sip observing: \"They're in high school? \" \"No, at Kennedy. \" So this traffic was targeting several high schools... Was Dickson aware of that? Or maybe was it the high school where girls from Jump Street were going ? \"Anyway, whatever, I won't share what I have! Having the monopole is good. \"And winked at Jenko. Then out of nowhere, a pretty brunette appeared beside Erik and Jenko: \"I'm sorry Erik but can I take you Brad? \"She asked timidly. The two men looked surprised, then Erik passed back the joint to Jenko: \"Why? \"Said Erik frowning. \"To dance!\" And she grabbed Jenko's arm to take him with her. The officer let her and didn't resist, considering the level of alcohol and drug going through his veins. She led him on the dance floor and they began to dance. The brunette didn't take away her eyes as she began to thrust against him while cercling his waist with her arms. He couldn't say how long they danced or even when Jenko decided to thrust back against her in a lascivious dance. But then she decided to kiss Jenko and the policeman heard his name and that, repeated several times. He looked up and saw Schmidt making signs to come. Strangely Erik was beside him, arm crossed, watching him intently. Jenko apologized to the brunette and go to join his teammate: \"What is it? \" \"No more booze, can you go fetch some ? \" Jenko glanced at Erik next to Schmidt, but his face was blank and he was shut unlike Molly and his friends beside him laughing noisily. \"Ok ok, I'll go get it. \" Then he took the direction of the basement. Going through the living room he saw Roman lying on the kitchen table her navel filled with tequila being licked by a highschooler. He laughed. The better if they had fun too. The policeman arrived at the basement, he hurried to take a barrel so the party could goes on, but when returning to the house he saw Erik against the doorframe. He sighed, but strangely know that he was alone again with Erik, wasn't that bothered or uncomfortable. Proof that he was well drunk and high. Jenko put the barrel on the floor and approached the dealer. \"A Dance? What a subtle way to try to sleep with you \" mocked Erik against the doorframe. Jenko raised his eyebrows before grinning: \"Jealous? \" \"Absolutely not! \"Denied Erik looking away \"Moreover, I can also ask for a dance can't I? \" \"I don't dance that well...\" \"Yeah, you keep telling yourself that.\" Erik continued sarcastically, he took off the door to approach Jenko while smoking. He was now facing Jenko and raising the joint he said: \"shotgun ? \" The officer frowned, shotgun? He knew it had to do with the joint, but the youth nowdays have developed all new methods he didn't know. Seeing how lost he was, Erik explained him the basis: he would take a deep breath into the joint and blow it through Jenko's lips who will inspire it at once. This would allow him to have a tenfold effect. Jenko rather curious agreed, but Erik told him that he had better to be at the same level to do this. Jenko was well over two head compared to Erik so ... Jenko looked around and saw an old couch, he invited Erik to sit. \"Ready? \"Asked the younger. \"Okay ... but what do I do? \" \"Nothing, just inhale ok? \" Jenko approved while Erik sat in front of him, took the joint in his mouth, put their lips very closer to each other and covered the sides with his hands for the minimum smoke to escape. The officer was somewhat skeptical but when he breathed the smoke blown by Erik, it went straight to his head and had an instant effect which disturbed him. He pulled back in a leap and started coughing hard. Facing him Erik stared smiling, before starting to laugh. The sound was good to heard. Jenko didn't know if it was the influence of drugs or alcohol or just an impulse or maybe Erik's eyes staring at him with desire, but all his good reasons were gone for a ride while he approached the youngest for a kiss. Erik put his arms around his neck and clung on to Jenko to the point of lying on the couch on top of him. Their kisses were already irregular, erratic, when Erik licked Jenko's lips with the tip of his tongue. Jenko answered in no time by licking back in Erik's mouth. He couldn't control himself, as he let his hands travel to the youngest's body, slipping under his shirt and gently caressing the skin. Erik had left the policeman's lips and was now kissing his neck while rubbing against Jenko. Fuck , thought Jenko. He was getting hard. But he couldn't stop it, no he wouldn't . And now Erik's hands began to go down, way too low, he thought, but his hands were already yanking at Erik's ass and... \"GET OUT OF MY HOUSE IMMEDIATLY OR I'll CALL THE COPS! \" Erik got up quickly following by Jenko, both stared in utter surprise, while some shouts were heard outside. Oh my god, what was it now? Jenko just had the time to see Erik hurried out of the basement. He held his head in his hands. For fuck's sake. I have nothing against Molly. Absolutely nothing, but she is a nullity that touches infinity. And so commonplace ... Jeez! A real head slap! Ah, I just read that the kid that Jenko hits early in the movie is called Juario not Tommy ... But in the film he calls him Tommy ... Go figure. I'll stay with Tommy ![Chapter 6] Wowowowow ! I'm so sorry ! Ok i don't know how to start...First, thanks to waiting and for the review ! Thanks a lot ! Then, well, I don't have any excuse, maybe that my school and my internship take all my time and I take my time for translate... BREF 22 jump street is out in USA ! LUCKY GUYS ! I must wait AUGUST for see it in France, but I'm happy because I expected to see it for writing the sequel of this story, but stop with the blabla and please tell me what do you think of this (short) chap! Distance A disaster ! This is how you could sum up the party they had yesterday : A disaster. Jenko had barely slept and woke up with a headache. Schmidt was no better ... He looked like the death, like a corpse just out of the grave. And the fact that both teammates has to endure the anger of the policeman's mother wasn't helping. A disaster. \"Look what they did? They drew a penis on a 8 year old child!\" \"Mom ...\" Tried Schmidt in vain through his mother's rage. Jenko looked at the scene blankly. Tired and somewhat jaded. After exiting the garage, he went to see what was happening and was surprised of seeing Schmidt's parents return from their night out much sooner than expected. You should have seen mother Schmidt: a real bull loose in a red clothes shop. Jenko even thought she was going to hit one of the highschooler. The very reason they all went out without asking ! While Jenko ran with Schmidt to escape the wrath of Demonia, they met Erik who congratulated Schmidt for his evening. The dealer kept calling him a cool guy to eventually ask him to be a part of his HFS traffic. After what, Erik had cast a long look at Jenko, which was mainly focused on the officer's lips before saying his goodbye and leaving. Jenko would have sworn that the boy wanted to kiss him again. But he had also felt something else during the scene: pure and simple jealousy. Erik had shown a real interest in Schmidt, had total trust in him to include him in the deal. And Jenko could say what he wanted, he saw it as a bad omen. Jenko growled, holding his head in his hands: they had kissed! And more ... he had kissed a minor ! What was he going to do? \"Jenko… are you okay? \" He looked up and saw Schmidt and her mother staring at him strangely. He got up from the couch and went to their bedroom without a word. He had to sleep again, he would take care of the cleaning later. However he felt his cellphone vibrate, he took it and saw the name Erik appears on the screen. A text message. What's better to resist the temptation that to giving in . EM He was going to kill that kid to end all problems. Ok he might go to prison, but there was good ways to hide a body, wasn't there? He threw his cellphone away on the mattress as he rushed over for a well deserved nap. However it was short time before Schmidt joined him and told him how he was happy to have won the dealer's trust. Could we stop talking about Erik for 5 minutes! Jenko took the pillow and put it on his head. He had had enough ! . . . Three days later, the policemen returned to the Police Station. They had to make a report to their superior, not Dickson but Chief Hardy. They took the opportunity to go on fire room to relax and lay off the stress due to the wrath of Demonia. They then took a break, Jenko turned to Schmidt and informed him of his brilliant idea: to put a wire on Erik's phone. But strangely the news wasn't taken as well as he thought. Schmidt didn't dare look at him and judging his face, he totally disapproved. \"What is it?\"Jenko asked not sure he understood. \"Dude ... I don't know if it's a good idea. What if he finds out? \" \"Impossible\" Objected Jenko putting his gun on the counter next to him. \"I don't know ...\" The taller observed his teammate. He had noticed that Schmidt and he slowly drifted away. And it became more distinct since Schmidt began to pretend to be Erik's dealer. His teammate became a cool guy! He had always dreamed of being one and inevitably, he had begun to ignore Jenko. In high school they were barely talking, and Dickson tended to congrats Schmidt more than him ... He was passing for the looser of the story. The more reasons to be angry and jealous. While Jenko put his belongings in his locker, he saw right next to him Erik's little group welcoming Schmidt with joy. He looked way, not wanting to be noticed even if he had none but one wish, going towards them. He then met Erik's gaze who was frowning in silent questioning. Jenko ignored him, slammed the door of his locker and left. Since the incident in the garage, he hadn't had the opportunity to talk with the young man. He avoided him like the plague. Didn't respond to his phone calls nor his messages. Erik had even dropped by Schmidt's, but Jenko had fled the house pretending to go for a jog. He didn't want to have a confrontation. To say what anyway? Listen , we kissed and I liked it , we do it again anytime you want? Not happening! He had only to endure a few months more and he would be able to say goodbye to Mrs. Griggs, his science courses, this weird school and especially Erik! . . . It was almost 2pm at Saigon High and Jenko was going down the stairs to the handicrafts' room when a hand grabbed his arm. Jenko stopped and sighed. He knew who it was. The officer had thought he wouldn't see him for a while. He turned and saw ... Mrs. Griggs? He straightened up not thinking to find her in front of him. Jenko cocked his head, frowning: \"Miss? \" \"Brad ... Hmm ... I ... I corrected your last exam and I wanted to tell you I'm worried about your grades. Are you sure that you're really supposed to be in the applied sciences course?\" She was right. His grades were catastrophic but he didn't really care. Schmidt used to help him but now... She was still looking at him with that little smile: \"If I can help you for anything » She said, going into his comfort zone. Jenko rolled his eyes. Why everyone wanted to approach him like that? \"Miss...\" \"Don't worry Madam.\" They both turned to see Erik just in front of them, arms crossed, an accusatory look directed at Mrs. Griggs. This one embarrassed of being caught, ran a hand through her hair before doing a small gesture towards Brad and leave. Jenko didn't wait and tried to leave without a word but Erik began to follow him: \"A thank you isn't going to kill you! \" \"I haven't asked you to help me.\" Jenko pondered and urged to enter the building but the dealer was still following him, more, Erik suddenly stood before him which forced him to stop. \"What's up with you?\" Erik asked , folding his arms and shaking his head . Jenko looked to the side and let out a sigh of annoyance: \"I should be the one saying that! Sch ... Doug became your best friend since when? \" Erik looked startled for a second before a smile appeared on his lips: \"Are you jealous? \" \"What are you talking about?\" Jenko looked everywhere except in front of him. \"You are! Damn! Your brother is a cool guy to be trust and he easily sells all the goods I give him ... \"Erik frowned, realizing something, but returned his attention to Jenko. \"But tell me Brad, why avoiding me like that? Is it because of what happen...? \" \" SHH!\" The policeman interrupted him \"Forget what happened would you? \" \"Why ? \" Jenko growled. He was going to kill him! \"Listen, Erik ... Please, don't make this difficult. We were drunk, we weren't in our right minds and… that's it! \" \"You can tell whatever you want I know you liked it as much as I did. \" \"Yes b… NO! Shit . \" Erik laughed, but quickly frowned when he heard his name called a little ahead of them. Molly and his group came to meet him. Jenko also saw his brother amongst them, who stared at him. The blonde approached them and looked at her boyfriend and the policeman, not sure if she understood what was happening. She pressed Erik to follow her: \"What are you doing with him…?\" \"It's none of your business. \"Erik said coldly. And then they left. Jenko sighed but he saw that Schmidt was still looking at him, hesitating to approach. He quickly looked away when Tommy called. Which wounded the policeman the most. Jenko headed towards the chemistry room, maybe the Nerds would be able to distract him and put his head out of his thoughts.[Chapter 7] Hey Guys ! I'm back with not one BUT TWO CHAPTER ! Hope you like it and like always thank for your reviews and for read this ! I would like to publish more quickly but unfortunately between my beta and I, things are pretty slow ... (btw thank you to her yet) (MERCI GRACE !) oh another thing, it will have the presence of an OC but it's still a little character ... or not. héhéhé. Secret for a Secret Part One It was the weekend, and Erik had offered to Schmidt to go for a trip at the mall. Which the officer had gladly accepted. It had been a month now that he had become a cool guy! And in addition he got the lead role in the play, Peter Pan's part, but it also shared the lead with Molly! Moreover, they had exchanged a few texts about their outfits during the show. It was funny. He got along really well with the girl. Sometimes he regretted not being born 7 years later he would have been popular and with a girlfriend as was Jenko at the time ... Jenko with which he distanced himself. His new friends didn't like him and didn't stop to criticize him. Lately though these critics irritated Erik who started pointing it out. Schmidt knew he had to take Jenko's side but he couldn't do it. He would stay silent and let others say what they wanted. This story between Erik and Jenko intrigued him more and more however and he was going to talk to Molly about that, maybe she would know more than him. \"You're sending messages to Molly?\" Schmidt turned to Erik at his side. They were now in a shoe store and strolled in the aisles. \"I ... no ! \" Erik laughed lightly before putting his hand on his friend's shoulder in a gesture of friendship: \"Don't worry dude, I'm not the possessive type. Molly and I are in an open relationship. Of course we hook up from time to time but nothing else. \" Schmidt stared him, trying to notice any contradictions but no, Erik gave him free way with Molly! Amazing! At last, he went back down to earth when he realized he couldn't do anything. \"And anyway, I got my eyes on someone else,\" Erik whispered softly staring into the empty, forgetting that Schmidt could hear him. He watched his friend looking at him with a mysterious smile. \"Schmidti ! Schmidti ! \" The policeman looked up to see Phyllis, the neighbor and friend of her mother, not far from the aisles. As often said Jenko, coincidence could sometimes be a bitch, like now. He saw Erik watching him as well as his friends. He had to get out of there, and quickly! He went to meet his neighbor, and whispered to be quiet but she continued to call him. He was now facing her and trying to silence her but she couldn't stop talking. She was going to blow up his cover and Erik who was approaching to see what was happening… Shit! Shit! He had to do something and fast, and the first thing his brain advised him to do was to hit the old woman, which he did. His parents were going to kill him, literally, but he had no choice, had he? \"She tried to grab my penis!\" He cried out as the group walked toward him. It was madness clear and simple but desperate times call for desperate measures ! He passed for a true... and he didn't know what to say about that. The vigil was trying to stand his neighbor up while Erik, Tommy and Amir insulted her. Schmidt would apologize to her later, he would even bring flowers if she wanted. They quickly left the mall and went to Taco Bell. \" Wow, this is the first time I heard an old woman sexually harassing a teenage in a shop\" said Tommy disgusted while driving. \" Oh, you know, old women today have no longer any shame ...\" Replied Schmidt. \"Man I 'm starving!\" he said trying to change the subject. Besides him on the back seat, Erik didn't say a word too concentrated at sending texts. He had a soft smile on his lips. It would be his new girlfriend Schmidt supposed. He wanted to say something but he did not really know what to say, however Amir talked first: \"Still sending messages to this girl?\" \" Mind your own business!\" Erik replied without stopping his tapping. \"A while now that Erik hide things from us. He doesn't want to tell us anything about this chick ... \" Informed Tommy at Schmidt \" He spends all his time writing texts, and when we told him he's in love... \" \" Shut up I'm not in love!\" Erik spat. \"…That's how he reacts. Dude ! You should see you, seriously. \" Schmidt nodded, but he felt Erik's eyes on him. Should he say something? \"Something wrong?\" Schmidt asked in the end. \"You, Mcquaid, are really weird.\" And he returned his attention to his two friends in the front. Schmidt observed Erik, what did he mean by that? After the stop by Taco Bell, they went to Erik's. Schmidt was pleasantly surprised by the immensity of the place. Erik was fucking rich! But why would he deal then? Schmidt followed him in the garden where Molly was waiting for them, she greeted him with a big hug. What a nice girl ! They small talked before being interrupted by Erik who kissed Molly. There couldn't be a more awkward situation ... But the officer did nothing as it was apart from an embarrassed laugh, and following the others inside. Back at Jenko, the officer went to Zack's, stopping once to buy a pack of Redbull and answering to some of Erik's texts. They were discussing the last game of the Atlantics, and the way the tournament went now. Soon, Jenko's favorite team, the Wasps , will met the Atlantics , and Erik tried to prove him by A plus B that his team was the best. He also learned by Erik that Schmidt had been assaulted by an old woman in shopping mall. Seriously, she tried to grab his balls? What with that story? Erik had finished their conversation with a \" can't wait to see you alone \" Jenko hadn't responded. Distance. Taking some distance was the keyword. He invited himself at Zack's little house. His parents had built a small house in their garden, where he could entertain his friends without problems. The beginning of evening went very well, they set on the chip and heard Molly ask Schmidt - subtly; to bring her to the prom this year. Which astonished Jenko in a way, not the fact that Molly was so bolt, but that Erik didn't go. As for Molly, who seriously would want to go to prom with her ... except for Schmidt of course? It made Schmidt wondered why Erik had not invited her, she just replied with a \"cause he thinks of bringing someone else. \" The Nerds wondered who it could be. Erik was quite a popular guy, known to all so if he was going out with someone else, people would have known quickly. Jenko cleared his throat and chose to remain silent. He still hoped that Erik wouldn't ask him to come. However he was happy for his teammate that he finally managed to ask Molly to accompany him. 7 years after that prom-disaster, Schmidt was finally able to go to the prom with the girl he liked. Jenko mood quickly fell however when he heard the rest of the conversation and the question of the supposedly drunk girl: \"It's true that you and Brad are brothers?\" Jenko held his breath waiting for the answer with some trepidation: \"He has been adopted, he was from a dodgy family and I always have to help him. He can't do anything.\" What sparked laughter from the group. Zack, Delroy and Roman turned to Jenko who looked the screen hardly believing what he heard. Schmidt was just now mocking him in front of others. And he kept talking about the fact that he was someone uninteresting and dumb. Jenko couldn't believe his ears. He knew that celebrity could go to the head but he thought Schmidt was someone down on earth. Someone who didn't care for what people say. He had been heavily disappointed. What's worse than being betrayed by the one person who we trust the most? The only person you could give your life for… well it seemed. Delroy went to shut the thing off when he saw Jenko's face but Erik's voice could be heard and the policeman asked him to leave it: \"You're not cool dude.\" Silence was heard on the other side. \"I ... I don't see how?\" Stuttered Schmidt. \"Your brother might not be the smartest, he screwed up with Tommy and hang out with weirdos but he's a good guy. \" The silence was persistent, cut after a moment by Molly who laughed nervously: \"he's your friend now? \" \"Whether he's my friend or not is not the point. I had the opportunity to chat with him and the bit we talked was a good laugh. \" \"Laugh?\" it was Tommy \"He hit me because I'm gay! \" \"Yes, yes but I think it was because he's been schooled in France, something like that. They aren't like us those people. \" The Nerds and Jenko were speechless. Especially the cop. He would never had thought something like that, Erik took his defense in front of his friends ! His own friends who thought he was dumbass! \"I just have one thing to add though. He's your brother Doug, and even if he was adopted, there is nothing more important than family. \" \"Wow\" said Zack after a moment, \"I never thought Erik could be ... nice. Did you hear that Brad ... Brad ? \" \"Hm!\" The officer had a big goofy smile on, having trouble to hide his joy. While he was still upset at Schmidt, what he thought of the young dealer raised a bit. Right now he only wanted to hug Erik and say \"thank you dude.\" Maybe more... Jenko cleared his throat to snap out of it.[Chapter 8] Secret for a Secret Part two Half an hour later, Jenko decided to take the leave and head back home. Tomorrow he would go at Jump Street to do some report. He didn't really want see Schmidt tonight, and as soon as he thought that, he received a text from Erik: Free? EM. He stared at his phone before answering: Yes? GJ Ok I know that right now you're avoiding me, but would you like to stop by ? EM Wasn't he supposed to be with his group of friends ? He looked at the clock, 11pm already ? Students nowadays had lost the notion of time. Still, if Erik asked, that would mean he was alone, Jenko thought. Should he go or not? It was a good opportunity to avoid Schmidt, but on the other hand he was going straight to the belly of the shark. He tapped his message: The address? GJ Whatever. He'll improvise. It's not like they would fuck or anything else. . . . Once he had the address put on his GPS, it took only twenty minutes to arrive at Erick's massive house. He wasn't surprised, the young dealer had told him that his parents were very rich but spent most of their time outside, forgetting they had a son. His parents, therefore, shouldn't be there. He parked in front, and decided to take a few minutes before going. He knew he shouldn't be here right now. He had called Schmidt's parents to tell them not to worry about him, but it didn't solve the problem. He left his car and went ringing. Erik seemed to have waited at the door because he opened quickly and threw himself at Jenko to kiss him without any warning. Jenko should have pushed him and not hugging him in turn to answer the kiss. Not took the opportunity to deepen the kiss. Erik meanwhile, had his arms around the neck of the policeman who was carrying him now. Erik's legs under his arms and wrapped around his waist. A more pleasant and convenient position. Erik was now a head taller than the cop and had laid his hands on Jenko's cheeks while resuming the kiss. They split after a moment to look at each other straight in the eyes. Only fondness could be seen. Well… Fuck , thought Jenko, his mind completely elsewhere. Erik had a big smile, he had left Jenko's lips to kiss his neck with craze. He wasn't going to give him a hickey like this, in the porch was he ? The porch ?! They had kissed like that right outside the Erick's house… Jenko turned his head and saw passersby unbelievingly looking at them \"Erik ...\" But the youngster only answered with mouthed sounds too concentrated to fuck, yes literally fuck his neck. \"Shit Erik we are in the street !\" But the dealer didn't give a shit, too busy making a huge hickey on Jenko's neck. Oh no no no no no! Jenko panicked. Jenko went forward and closed the door behind them with his foot. He hurried to take Erik further inside, walking in the dark - Erik blocking his view still busy kissing his face. Was he under influence or something? With the way he behaved, Jenko wouldn't have been surprised if it was. The police arrived at last in what seemed to be the living room and threw his bundle on the couch. \"WOW!\" Said Erik falling head first in the sofa. Jenko inhaled deeply as Erik stood up slowly and sarcastically said: \"Thank you!\" \"I had to, you were actually giving me a hickey on the street! Imagine if cops had pass by? \" \"I would have told them to go fuck themselves.\" Jenko rolled his eyes. Be polite and tactful . He approached Erik and sat down next to him while the latter handed him a beer, beer he had apparently already prepared since it was already on the coffee table in front of them. They clinked glasses and drank then Erik began to tell him in detail the incident of this afternoon. The previous issue already forgotten. It became like that between them, they slipped, didn't talk and continued to act like nothing happened. Jenko wouldn't complain, he liked it the way it was. They weren't going to be a couple or anything anyway. It was hard enough for him to say if he was attracted by Erik or no, if in addition they had conversations about it, Jenko wouldn't survive. Jenko put his head in his hands: he would soon loose hair with this story. How couldn't he not be attracted to Erik? As time went by, since some month now even, they hung out, chatted like tonight and yes, the attraction was there. Erik was far from being this arrogant bad boy he wanted to show to the others. And to tell the truth, they had both begun to forge a bound, and frankly, it hurt Jenko to have to lie to him like that. To think that at the end he will handcuff Erik and read him his rights. Well, if he knew them by heart by then of course. Erik would end up in jail, and people would welcome him and Schmidt for their investigation. He will go on with his life, stop drug dealers, thieves and write reports. Erik's sincere laughter would no longer ring in his ears, the endless debates on the Atlantics and the championship will end, and the texts would stop. No one to invade his personal space without permission, subtly flirt with him. Subtle as in ironically of course. Erik wouldn't take him in one of the many places only known by him, nor try to kiss him when he had the chance to and tell anyone who would listen - out of high school of course -that he was his boyfriend. The officer sighed, staring his beer. He was lost. \"Brad ...?\" He looked up and saw Erik looking at him worried. He was so lost in thought that he had forgotten where he was. \"You're alright?\" Erik asked again. Jenko stared at him. In 3 months, his life agent would come back, no more Jump Street, no more Erik. He would probably be blamed for what he was going to do, maybe even get fired, but no one needed to know right? He put down his beer, took Erik's hand in his own and slowly approached him. His fingers gently brushed Erik's cheek, before putting his forehead against his. Jenko kissed him softly in a single touch. He was happy to feel a smile against his lips. The officer kept on, running a hand through brown hair, he was now kissing the cheeks of the youngest who had closed his eyes to enjoy the contact. Jenko lightly stroked the other's cheek as Erik opened his eyes. He had been warned. Dickson had been clear, but to hell with it, he had transgressed half of rules already anyway. These was his last coherent thoughts as he leaned Erik on the sofa... . . . Jenko turned to tighten his torso against the back of Erik. He felt comfy. He buried his head in the younger's neck and sighed. They had slept together, and he didn't regret it. It wasn't amazing, but he had a good time. He never thought Erik was quite experienced on that side ... Odd. Anyway as soon as it concerned the young dealer everything was odd. However, sometime later, Jenko felt something against his forehead. Metal, hard and cold, and the sound of a snap. Bang This had the instant effect of waking him immediately. Jenko suddenly opened his eyes to see a woman before him. A woman pointing a gun at his head. \"WHAT THE HELL!\" He yelled. He tried to get up but the woman in front of him told him to stay calm: \"Don't move or this time you will be the target!\" His first reaction was to raise his hands. What was this madness ! Erik beside him was completely awake, he didn't see how he couldn't be with the shot that had been fired. Erik looked at Jenko then at the woman in front of him before beginning to panic but not for the same reason ... The officer took the time to detail the woman, a rather pretty African-American, a good 5ft 8 with curly hair that cascaded down to the shoulders. \"Miranda!\" Said Erik beside him. \"Miranda drop your weapon! \" \"Can I know who you are?\" She asked at Jenko, squinting her eyes without paying attention to Erik. \"Maybe if you drop your gun I will answer\" Tried to parley Jenko his hands still in the air. She didn't seem inclined to the discussion: \"Yes, you probably want me to point somewhere else\" and she lowered her weapon to Jenko's knob which made him began to panic. The young woman wouldn't listen and continued to ask the identity of the officer. \"Fuck Miranda! \" The two adults turned to Erik who was now standing naked on his knees: \"Holy shit, you're naked!\" She said astonished eyes wide open, but the gun always pointed on Jenko's parts. Erik shook his head, not the least embarrassed by his nakedness: \"Obviously, since we just fuck!\" Jenko sighed heavily, rolling his eyes. Was he serious when saying this? Tact, today's students didn't know what it was ?! HELL ! He was going to punch him, regardless of the consequences. \"Oh really Sherlock ? Of course she knows! She's pointing her fucking gun on my junk! \"Jenko got angry. \"And who this is? \" She wouldn't let the matter go ! Erik stayed strangely silent... \"Brad! Brad McQuaid! \"Jenko finally answered. He didn't like at all the fact that she continued to point her gun at his limb. She had already shot before, and she could do it again. Especially because for some reason she didn't like at all to see Jenko in bed with Erik. \"Brad huh? \"Miranda said again,\" You know that he's 17 B.R.A.D ? \" she insisted on his name. She seemed angry. \"Me too! \"Retorted Jenko moving his head as if it was obvious. That only triggered the young woman. She re-cocked her weapon, \"Are you fucking with me?\" \"MIRANDA! \" Erik was annoyed. Jenko turned to the younger and saw a nameless anger crossed his eyes. She looked one last time Jenko before putting down the gun and leave the room with a heavy step followed by Erik who picked up his boxers and clothes to get dressed quickly and follow the woman in the hallway. To say Jenko was lost was an understatement. What just happened? And who was that berserker? An ex-girlfriend? He followed suit when he heard their voices a little further, they spoke softly, not wanting to be heard: \"Why did you bring him here?\" Miranda. \"It's fine\" tried to reassure Erik, \"there is nothing to worry about. Relax \" \"Relax? Relax? Hell, and if he knows that you brought him here huh? You know he has agents everywhere! I'm willing to cover your back but don't push it either! And even more since you are already sleeping with him ! \" What could imply that conversation? Who was that 'he' they were talking about? \"We had both consenting ...\" \"You want to drown the fish, isn't it? You forgot what you're supposed to do here. Don't forget, tomorrow there is the pinata to provide and ... Oh, we're no longer alone \" Jenko sighed, well he wasn't cut for spying missions. He approached them slowly, Erik had a little sorry smile while Miranda glared. \"Things have calmed down...? \"The policeman asked cautiously. Erik nodded, even if the woman didn't seem to agree. After a moment Erik decided to introduce everyone: \"Brad, I want you to meet Miranda ... Miranda, Brad, a ... a guy from school! \" Both turned to Erik puzzled. What was that?! \"Miranda? And there's something else I need to know about Miranda? \" She remained silent, as Erik. Jenko felt that, whoever was this girl, he wasn't supposed to meet her. Which intrigued him greatly. Was she the supplier? Did she had links with HFS? He looked at the clock: nearly 3:30. Erik's parents didn't seem here and this woman, because she was far from being a teenager looking at her closely was maybe 27 years or nearly 30. \"Something wrong with my face? \" \"No, on the contrary, really pretty ... But to have aimed at my balls, I'd gladly mess it up a little bit ! \" Miranda gasped, Erik refraining himself from laughing. He approached Jenko and led him back to the room. Once the door closed, Erik spoke: \"Sorry, you ... you weren't supposed to meet. \" \"And can I know who is she? She nearly killed me! \" Erik shook his head: \"We all have our little secrets haven't we?\" he went on. At this moment, Jenko could have sworn Erik knew . He swallowed and decided not to ask for more. He took his things and decided to leave. It was for the best, however Erik didn't let go that easily, and kissed him again before he leaves. He absolutely had to talk about it with Schmidt, he didn't know how without exposing what had happened between him and Erick, but he would find a way. This Miranda was definitely directly or indirectly one of Erick's accomplice and surely a major one... What's the first name of Jenko : Richard or Greg ? Because IMDB and Wikipédia says to different name...[Chapter 9] That's it, I've seen 22 jump street. I didn't think it was so gooood, I really loved it! I ask, I never know: I search a beta French / English, this is the reason for which I also publish shortly. My betas are very busy. :( thanks for reading and the review ! Coming out The next day was difficult for Jenko, he was back in Schmidt's house by four in the morning and had to stay silent to be unnoticed. Once in Schmidt's room, his teammate asked him haf sleeping where he had spent the evening, but Jenko hadn't answer and went sleeping. But once at Jump Street things were more difficult. He was irritable, he had slept little and had to endure Schmidt's laughing loudly to his new best friends' jokes. Add to that, the other two girls on the team had come to talk about their latest achievements, but the real reason for his nervousness was that he was filled with remorse. He had had sex with a minor... He took his head in his hands. At the time, he had no care and delved right in. But now ... now that his brain was less foggy, it was a different story. And if Dickson knew, he was a dead meat ! « Ha ha ha! Erik is the funniest guy ever » giggled Schmidt. Jenko sighed. He tried in vain to prepare for his lecture on \"molecules are our friends.\" It seemed he really did take pleasure in studying this subject, even if it wasn't so at first. But the laughs from outside where really bothering him. He was this close, this close to losing his shit. \"Schmidt! Jenko! In my office immediately! \" For Dickson to be calling them this way, was a bad sign. They joined their boss in his office, and got the lecture of their life. Dickson was angry and with reason, they still hadn't found the suppliers and had no leads on the case. He was threatening to fire them. The two officers had vexed look. However, Jenko made a remark: \"I taped Erik's phone yesterday and apparently one of the suspects is a fan of pinata\" This was followed by silence and the chief asking : « Is that a code for sex?\" Schmidt looked confused, but Jenko continued: \"I'm sure I'm onto something. \" And not to change, Dickson banged his fist on his desk before to dismissing them immediately. The two officers left the station, Jenko on edge. His one and only desire was to go home, change and job. It would do him good but obviously Schmidt could not leave him be: \"Pinata? Really? \" They both went to the car: \"You remember the bug I put, I could listen into a conversation Erik had last night\" Even if the truth was that he had heard from Miranda herself, but Schmidt didn't need to know that. \"Besides, I have also heard another conversation. You seem to have had a lot fun last night. \"He spat these words and Schmidt stopped in front of the passenger door:\" Did you… hear it all ...? \" « Yes all of it! It's great to know you can be mocked like that \" Schmidt didn't know what to say, after all he couldn't deny any of it. While he was sorry he couldn't look for dumb in front of his friends. He thought that Jenko would have understood that. Once in the car, Jenko continued questioning Schmidt : \"Did Erik tell you ... about a woman called Miranda? \" Schmidt turned to him with raised eyebrows: \"Miranda? No I don't know a Miranda? Who is she? \" \" That's what I'm asking you ... Forget it! \" He started the car. This woman was perhaps the supplier he was so desperate to find. That would explain her panic when she saw the police officer. . . . Jenko listened attentively to what Zack was saying in front of him. He was giving him the latest information for the lecture. Delroy and Roman added some to it. If everything went well he could easily get more than average the marks, if not he would turn some of his charm on Mrs. Griggs. He gave a high five to his new friends, he felt rather proud of himself. \"Brad, your cell phone is ringing. \"Zack remarked. \"Oh, thank you,\" but his smile faded when he saw it was Erik's name displayed. He got up and walked away from the Nerds: \"Yes? \"He replied. \" If I follow your schedule, you have a free period right now, don't you? \" \"Yes but I have to work on my lecture for tomorrow. \" \" Ok, but I won't take long. Can we meet ? Room 201 in 5 minutes. \" Erik hung up on him before he could say anything. Jenko turned to the others before getting his things and leaving them, saying some emergency came up. He had to discuss this with Erik. Room 201 was a room for acting classes, wasn't it? Opening the door of the room, Jenko saw costumes everywhere, the lights were off and the shutters down. He gently closed the door and called Erik, this one showed his head just a moment later: \"Hey,\" said the younger softly. He approached Jenko and was about to kiss him, but Jenko stopped him. \"Erik ... please\" \"Why? Don't tell me you've changed your mind ... again \" \" That's not it...\" Erik enlaced Jenko, breathed against his neck and gently brushed the tips of their lips. The oldest did nothing but resisting the pull of that mouth with all his might. He did want to cave, push the young student against the couch and kiss the hell out of him. But he was certainly not going to do that! Jenko resist, resist, you can do it! \"Brad ...\" Erik was using that sensual voice, sliding his body against his. Whispering crude words to him. Jenko never thought that a young man could be that straight that age, he wasn't a saint but not at to that extent. Well, judging by the ever growing bulge in his pants he was quite affected by those words. \" Oh, I can see you are showing some interest ...\" Erik said chuckling. It was quickly becoming too much for Jenko, had been for quite a while actually and he was seconds - yes, seconds away from giving in. Shit! And right now nobody could be of help for him! He stood up suddenly, surprising Erik, who looked stunned. Jenko paced up and down the room. \"Erik I can't ! What will Doug think of all this! \" \"I don't see what Doug has to do with anything...\" Erik say stunned and somewhat disappointed. \" If you see it that way… \" The young dealer decided to leave but not before stopping near Jenko. Getting on his tippy toes he whispered sensually, \"What a shame ...\" He pulled back and stared into his eyes one last time smirking. That look, that was the look that had been driving the officer nuts for months now ... \" Fuck it! \" And on these words Jenko grabbed Erik, pressed him against the wall and captured his lips in a heated kiss. And to say it was only yesterday they were sleeping together, they were once again at it. Suddenly noise could be heard. They both stopped and the door was being opened, Oh shit! \"It's here ! Hurry up ! \" Molly ! Molly was entering the room ! Erik looked at him panicked, if they were both caught in here ... They were scanning the room for a place to hide when Jenko lifted Erik and finally entered the cabinet to their left. \"Molly, are you sure this is a good idea? \"The voice of Schmidt followed by that of the blonde. They both opened their eyes in surprise inside the cabinet, Erik trying to hold in his laughter. \"We'll just try two or three suits, nothing more. Go hurry up! \" Jenko was holding his breath, but he was about to have a hard time not making any noise. The younger having decided that their hideout was the perfect place to continu where they left it … He had a mischievous look on his face, and was biting his lower lip. Oh no ... \"Erik this isn't the time ...\" he whispered. But the youngest took no heed, gently kissing Jenko's neck while running a hand through his hair. The lack of room brought their bodies really close to one another, and Erik was taking advantage cheerfully. Jenko tried his best to remain stoic and focus on what was being said between Schmidt and Molly. He could hear the blonde laughing while talking about a dress ... As for Schmidt… as for Schmidt… Shit ... did the kid just say he wanted his penis where he thought ? He grabbed Erik's shoulders to bring some room between them but the only effect was to make a big thud against the cabinet's door. « Did you hear that? \"Molly said alerted. Of course she heard that mouthed Jenko. Couldn't he stay quiet too! Jenko glared at Erik who didn't seem the least bit bothered. He did stop caressing Jenko for a second. Silence, cut a moment later by Schmidt: \"Tell me Molly, can I ask you something ...\" \"Of course, you know you can tell me everything! \" Jenko rolled his eyes, what an idiot. He could see from where he was, her so caled innocent face and hair touching. He also noticed how Erik focusing on what was being said all of a sudden: \"Don't you find something odd between Erik and Brad? I mean I have nothing against their friendship, but ... \" \"I'm glad not to be the only one with these thoughts! \" The men in the cabinet shared a surprised look. They made no noise and focused on the conversation: \"I don't know what is happening. I tried to ask Erik but he just told me it was none of my business. You know ... \"She did a nervous laugh\" The way he acts, it's like he wants to date your brother. \" Silence. \"What do you mean ...? \"Schmidt asked surprised. \"Well ... he wants to fuck him, be his boyfriend ... something like that. He's always missing these days ... \" You could hear the pain in the girl's voice. \"Molly, Molly ... I'm sure Erik loves you, plus you know with the traffic it is normal that he's always missing . \" Tried in vain to reassure the policeman. Another silence followed his statement, but Jenko wasn't paying attention to what was being said anymore, he focused all his attention on Erik who seemed lost in his own thoughts. Was he feeling guilty about cheating on his girlfriend? Jenko didn't particularly like Molly, but nobody deserved to be cheated on. He heard Schmidt and Molly return to what they came there for, and felt Erik's forehead against his. \"I will stop things with her ...\" he said softly. \"What ? \" \"I'll break up with her. \" And he gently kissed Jenko who preferred not to ask, for fear of raising a subject he certainly didn't want to deal with with the youngest. But strangely those words made him feel something, like a relief ... he let Erik kiss him, and began to gently answer the kiss, pressing their bodies close together. hahaha just a friendly reminder that i have nothing against Molly[Chapter 10] Disorder Later in the week, it was D-day for the two policemen of Jump Street. One had to go to class for a presentation on Carbon nitrate and the other in front of the whole school for the premiere of Peter Pan. But before that, Jenko was quietly taking his lunch with Erik, who was laughing about a story that the officer was telling him. The day before the two young men went out, Erik had taken the police officer to a bar, his parents knew the owners. It seemed Erik knew everyone in town. They took part in a championship game in an atmosphere filled with joy and beer. They even saw the young leader's basketball player friend with whom they had had a good time, and in the end, Erik and him had finish at the youngest's crib ... \"What is that ? \"Asked Jenko pointing Erik's bracelet as he quietly ate his vegetables. Erik raised a questioning look, then smiled: \"It's your brother who gave it to me. A friendship bracelet, isn't cool ?! » Jenko rolled his eyes, only Schmidt could do these type of things. He shrugged and continued eating: \"But you know what would be really cool ? A love bracelet . \" Erik whispered his last words while leaning towards the oldest. \"Don't even think about it. \" Snapped back the policeman, his eyes still fixed on his plate. \"Why? I mean where did this idea come from ? … Oh yes I know. Glee. Fuck Glee ! \"Erik laughed, then after a while he quickly took leave of the policeman, he had an affair to settle with Tommy. Jenko watched him go without a word and turned his attention back to his plate. He felt guilty. He couldn't get Erik out of his head and it went from bad to worse. Last night, he thought about clearing things out with the young dealer, yes once again, but Erik didn't let him speak and took him to his place. He was feeling the weight of guilt. Because let's face it, he loved spending the evening as a \"boyfriends\". He didn't hesitate to kiss the youngest from time to time during the evening and hug against him while watching the game, like ... - Yes it was strange to say - like a normal couple. Jenko looked at his watch, his course and his presentation were beginning soon. He dropped his tray, adjusted his bag on his shoulder and headed for the classroom. But surprisingly, he was grabbed suddenly and pushed against a wall. Jenko barely had the time to say anything or react when a pair of lips came against his. The surprise quickly past when he recognized Erik, Jenko answered to the kiss with fervor. He woved an arm around the other's back to tighten against him, and Erik wrapped his arm around his neck. \"It would have bothered me not to be able to kiss you before the end of the day, but especially to wish you good luck with your presentation\" said Erik, walking backwards with a smirk on his pretty face. He kissed the police officer once more on the corner of the lips before leaving. Jenko sighed but he was pretty happy. It was in a good mood that he joined his classroom and he suddenly had the motivation to do his presentation. He sent a message to Schmidt to wish him good luck for his show and say that he would be sitting first row. They were a bit closer these last days, Jenko made efforts despite the fact that he still little angry against his teammate. Once in front of the room, he cheered himself up before joining the small group of nerds. Nothing could spoil the end of the day. Well, that's what he thought … How come he was with Schmidt, trying his best to blow up vehicles in a chase on the highway ? A h . Y es. The piñata. . . . \"Watch Out! \" Screamed Schmidt to Jenko while the latter made drifted to the left to avoid the car in front of him. Jenko turned and looked if the bikers were still there. And of course they were. The head and the ZZTop's doppelgänger were still pursuing them. Shortly before they had managed to lose two bikers sending them respectively against a tank of oil and gas tank, and to the two officers' surprise no vehicles had exploded. Now they found themselves running on the highway, Schmidt sending messages to Molly and Jenko struggling with his skinny jean. Trying to find a new car. . . . Things were going pretty well : his presentation on Carbon Nitrate seemed to catch the class' interest. \" Interest \" was a big word but that wasn't the point. Ms. Griggs and Zack were sending him encouraging looks. He was going to see the end of it. After all the police officer hadn't prepared his speech for nothing ! Plus he had better have a good mark, not the best but something above a D. He was glancing at Ms. Griggs when he saw his boyfriend through the porthole , passing by with Tommy and guess what: a piñata. He didn't think twice before bolting and here they were … on the highway. But before this fast and furious like chase, there was theft of the car and tailing Erik to the place where he was exchanging the piñata with a group of bikers. Bikers who proved to be the same as those he had stopped several months in a park and by extension, were also the reason they came to Jump Street. Coincidence could be a true bitch when she wanted. Jenko was so not, liking the way their leader was talking to Erik. \"So these were the suppliers ? This biker gang! \" whispered Schmidt. Jenko glanced at him before getting his attention back to what was going on. When the gang decided to take off, the two police officers hid in the car somehow, and Jenko had an idea: \"Suck my dick\" \"Fuck this shit ! \" exclaimed Schmidt trying to get up, but Jenko held him down. He wasn't the one wearing the Peter Pan costume, so he was the one deciding. A brief explanation ... This little event was nothing compared to what they would face afterwards. Their old quarrel came back as they followed the gang and parked after them. \" I lead Jenko! If we approach like this we will be seen. \" \"But if we stay behind they'll see us too, it will be suspicious ! \" \"Get your foot off the clutch\" got mad Schmidt. If Schmidt wasn't his colleague but especially his best friend Jenko wouldn't have hesitated to hit him. He was so infuriating, plus he wouldn't give an inch in any argument. Even though Jenko was as stubborn as him, it was not an excuse ! And the unavoidable came, they crashed in to one of the Harley's, thus turned the whole gang against them. That's while they found themselves just 20 minutes later, running on the highway trying to find a new car. And the following events weren't better. After hardly finding a car, they were still being chased, trying to blow up tanker trucks, and gas trucks ... at least. The two police officers failed to understand why nothing was exploding ... like in the movies. It was true though that they wasn't in one to begin with. Just when they thought they had lost them, the Leader, dangerously near them pointed a gun at them. The driving Jenko was shouting at Schmidt to shoot, to get rid of him anyhow, just to take the man out. However, seconds were passing by and nothing was happening. Jenko had no choice but to shoot instead of Schmidt and although he had saved them, he was met only with insults and grief from his teammate. All the way till school ... \"Listen dude! \" Said Jenko catching Schmidt's arm to stop him \"you're too into it \" \" What do you mean? \" \"I saw your application form for college ! » But this did nothing to calm Schmidt down, explaining that even Erik was applying, not understanding one bit what Jenko was trying to tell him. They were growing apart not only as teammates but as friends too. \"You do what you want, but I ain't following you. » And Schmidt left Jenko to go to the presentation room, knowing that he was already late, but he still wanted to save what was left. He had little success in high school and it was not Jenko who would take away his moment of glory. As for the latter h stood up for a while, disappointed yet again by Schmidt's behavior, but this disappointment engendered anger that moved him into the first trash. He glanced over to where Schmidt had just left and an idea came to his mind. Jenko knew in his mind that his idea wasn't good and that he was heading for disaster, but he didn't care! It was anger that dictated his steps now and he was thirsty for vengeance. He hurried to the presentation room and the backstage. He heard people's exclamation of surprise, Schmidt had to get noticed as usual. And indeed when he got behind the scenes he saw his teammate on stage and his thirst still very present, he rushed on stage ... The crowd went crazy, some were pointing fingers at them and only shame made him stop. Schmidt was insulting him and the others were laughing at them. What had he just done? Among the crowd, Jenko saw Erik taking part in the festivities and laughing with his friends. It hurt him. But Jenko had no time to feel anything when he saw the headmaster approach him and Schmidt, shouting in a loud, booming voice : \"YOU ARE EXPELLED ! » Jenko turned to Schmidt, who looked stunned. Had he heard that right ? Expelled ? No way ... They were going to be crucified by Dickson. But before the curtain closed on them, Jenko saw Erik's face. Hilarity was far gone, he was blanc. Not a really interesting chapter since I'm just replaying a scene from the movie, but well. We must do what we must , pray for me that my beta sends me the next chapter rapidly Thank you all for reading and leave comment *heart*[Chapter 11] Hi guys ! I'm so so so sorry for the delay ! Oh gosh ! As I said before, I have one beta that can help me with my French / English translation and she was really busy in recent months. Myself, I finished translating this fic but I am not bilingual and I really don't want to publish with many fault and error, so I prefer to wait before publishing (I want that the chapter was clean for you :)) I hope you enjoy this chapter ! thank you again to read me and leave review ! That makes me very happy ! thank you ! *heart* Backed into the corner Dickson wasn't saying anything. No shouts, no insults. However you could see the depth of the disappointment in his eyes. He thought these young recruits would do well despite their bullheadedness and thoughtless actions, but unfortunately he was wrong to trust them. \"You aren't shouting. \"Asked Jenko. \"No.\" \"No insult ? No nothing ? \" Pressed Schmidt. \"I'm just going to fire you. \" Dickson had just told them they could take their business and leave. Worst of all was how calm he was when saying it. The two police officers knew if he wasn't the one grilling them out, the chief Hardy would gladly do the honors. Jenko, followed by Schmidt left the office to get their stuff without a word. They felt the stares of the other team members, both of pity and indifference. In the end they were feeling good her in the Korean Church. The girls maybe never stopped teasing them, but always in good nature. Jenko put his belongings in a box that was strangely there. \"Will you be ok ? \"He looked up to see Fugazy in front of him, leaning against his desk, her face concerned. \"We messed up, how do you want me to be all right ? \"Jenko continued packing his things. He didn't like the way she was flirting with him since the beginning of the mission. The blonde gently placed her hand on his arm and lowered her face to talk quietly. \"Want to come at mine's tonight ? \" Fugazy had left her numbers on his desk since day one, with a not spelling \" call me \". However Jenko had never used it. The only time it had crossed his mind Erik had been there to dissolve it. \"No, that's ok, plus I have to go get my stuff from Schmidt's parents. \" The blonde's shoulders sagged, then she got up to continue her activities. Jenko and Schmidt went out simultaneously from Jump Street. Without looking the other, they went opposite directions. Even if the last still wanted to try to talking, Jenko was too stubborn to hear anything. And the stubborn one was thinking that Schmidt wouldn't want to make a move anyway. Same fools. Once in his car, Jenko sighed. It had been two days since the theather incident and Erik had been harassing him for the past four. He wasn't answering. From Erik : \" What is this bullshit rumor that you got yourself fired ? \" From Erik : \"Were you really fired, you asshole ? \" From Erik: \" We need to see each other ... \" From Erik: \"Please, Brad ! » From Erik: \"...\" From Erik : \"Fuck you McQuaid ! Call me back ! » But Jenko wasn't a coward. He started his car headed to Erik's. Seeing the time, the other was most likely at home. Jenko just hoped he was not with his bunch of friends. He parked, looked around and walked towards the gate, but instead of ringing the bell to make himself known, he reached the young man on his phone. \" Brad ! You bastard ! Why the fuck are you only calling back now ?! \"Erik replied without letting the first ring tone. \"Calm down, we need to see each other. \" \" Of course we do ! \" Jenko could hear his sigh of relief \" Where are you ? \" \"In front of your ...\" The line went dea. Jenko barely had the time to be startled that the door opened on an angry Erik. He pulled Jenko to him, closed the gate to push the unceremoniously against the wall. Jenko let him do what he wanted. Stay calm and finish this quickly was his mantra: \"You get yourself fired from highschool and no longer give me news ? Why the hell would you do that ? \"Started Erik irritated, completely bystepping any salutations. Jenko looked to the side, inwardly taking a breath. Erik's tone was borderline. \"From what I could see you had a good laugh with it,\" he replied earnestly. Erik stepped back a little surprised. \"You were just ridiculous. \"Said the younger, face closed. \"And Doug ? \" \" Doug! If you want news from your best friend ask him yourself. Fuck you Erik I'm not here for that ! » Jenko ran a hand in his hair. He didn't think saying this would make him this uncomfortable. This relationship had meant more than he thought. \"You and me are over.\" He dropped out of the blue. Erik stared at him, not understanding: « What ! » \"You heard me well. \" Silence followed, before Erik started shouting again : \"You fucking asshole, are you fucking kidding me ? I just broke up with Molly for you ! And now you're leaving me ? Don't you dare tell me you can't assume us or something the likes ? \" Erik was shouting now, waving his arms: \"I ...\" \"Don't you dare ! \" Jenko warned him by pointing Erik by the finger. Erik frowned before laughing hateful way. \"Were you seriously thinking I was going to say that I love you ? How could I even like a bastard like you ! How could I even imagine that I had finally found a good guy! Little piece of... \" Jenko stay silent about this surge of anger and rage. Did he really deserve all of this? He knew he had screwed up and on many points, but he thought Erik would take this well. As well as it could be, Erik and him hadn't commit to anything. Had they ? The officer observed the boy in front of him. He sensed that there was something else. \" What's wrong ?\" He asked after a moment. Erik showed his back to him and stopped talking. Silence again before the youngest started to speaking : \"Why do you care ? Get out if you have nothing more to say.\" The indifference in Erik's voice hit a string in the officer. There really seemed to be something wrong with the younger one. A single break-up should not go to this extent right ? Well, now who cares? Jenko was no longer a part of Jump Street. He had been fired from Saigon High, his unit and now his former boyfriend 's house. He looked back once at Erik's back before leaving. The temptation hugging the other boy was becoming too strong. Damnit, he had really screwed things up. Once in his car, he violently hit the steering wheel. Why was this all happening to him ? All because he was jealous of Schmidt, because they hadn't given him as much credit as his teammate. Jenko hadn't liked that he was undermined like that, it had been a blox to his ego and now he was paying the consequences. They had often told him in high school that he was hotheaded, he always did things as he wanted. And going to the police academy, he wanted to prove to everyone that he was worth better than that. He was a wall of muscles but he was also brains. He wasn't a genius like Schmidt but he did have some up there. He really did everything to make this mission a success, taping Erik's phone was a success ... half success ... but still a success and what he get in return: nothing. He had wanted to make it up to the head Hardy for the release of Domingo and his gang. He had wanted to make it up to Schmidt for what he had done to him all those years. He also wanted to prove to his father that he was a man who could succeed. But most of all, he wanted to prove to himself he was a good man. And again , he had failed. And what about Erik ... He needed him quickly out of his mind. This too, he had screwed up. On one side he was relieved he would not be the one to handcuff the younger later on, but knowing that he would end up in prison was bothering him still. \"Fuck it !\" He still had to get his things from the Schmidts. . . . Annie tried somehow to pledge for her son. She apologized to Jenko and tried to convince him to stay, in vain. Jenko, as much as he liked his teammate's parents couldn't afford to stay. Everything was over. \"He feels guilty you know, but he is as stubborn as a rock.\" Said Annie gently accompanying Jenko to the exit. \"I know. Dont' be to harsh on him too.\" He took in his arms the woman who welcomed him these last months. Thanking her and apologizing for all the problems that he had caused her. Like the party fiasco. It actually happened already 5 months ago. 5 months he hooked up with Erik ... Jenko took his things and walked to his car. He raised his head to Annie yelling at Schmidt on the first floor while pointing him. A moment after that, Schmidt was runningr towards him, probably to apologize. Jenko put his bags in his car before turning to his teammate : \"You know, what I think is crazy is that I thought we were real brothers in the end.\" But the smallest barely had the time to say two or three words that Erik's car appeared. He was driving and next to him was Amir. Jenko frowned and glanced toward Schmidt surprised: \"Get in\" said with a firm but anxious voice the young dealer. \"Why should I ?\" Said Jenko defiantly. \"Get in the fucking car\" Erik yelled. \"Not until you ask nicely. \"Jenko still had resentment towards Erik, he did sit through a barrel of insults for no reason. He saw the young man throw him a side look before swallowing difficulty and saying a \" Please .\" Schmidt gladly got in the car and encouraged Jenko to do the same. However, in 5 months, Jenko had begun to know Erik and something was wrong. What was that feeling this afternoon before he left? He had never seen him like that, so worried, anxious and on the defensive. And the way he spoke to them, had he finaly discover they were not Brad and Doug McQuaid ? Jenko glanced toward the visor, and crossed Erik's black look. I wanted the scene between Erik and Jenko to not be overly dramatic. All this anger is justified ... Well. However, I'm glad I wanted to show Jenko's sense of guilt. For me, it's not just Mr. muscles, he's more than that and it has not shown enough in the movie #TeamJenko[Chapter 12] Look... Yes... ! It's a NEW CHAPTER ! I didn't realize the last time I updated this fic was TWO YEARS AGO ! Helllllllllllllll Shame on me ! I'm really happy to say that this fic is finished to be translate ! *clap clap clap* You know what I did for my beta (I love her) for her to finish to translate ? Ask her again again again again and pay ticket to see SOAD in France in August ha ha ha ! SO ! I'm going to upload this chapter today, next chapter tomorrow and next next chapter day after or maybe all today... wait and see Long chapter is long. 7 pages, I thought about splitting it in two but I told myself it's better to do one shot ! / ! / ! SMUT, SMUT PRESENT / ! / ! Love The drive wasn't long. No words were exchanged, however, Jenko had cast glances toward his teammate sitting beside him on the back seat and seeing Schmidt, he was just nervous as him. \"Can I know where you are taking us\" Jenko had attempted earlier. \"Shut up! \" Was Erik's only answer, never taking his eyes off the road. Fortunately Jenko still liked the young man, if it hadn't been the case, he wouldn't have hesitated for a second to make him swallow his insult back. His concern for him was also one of the reasons for the silence treatment. Finally they arrived at the riverside, in a deserted place. Erik pulled up and asked the two police officers to follow him a little bit further, even though Amir was still leaning against the car. Jenko and Schmidt stood aside and waited. What was this all about? \"Four days ago, my suppliers had trouble with cops. They were chased on the highway... » Jenko swallowed and felt his teammate do the same, they casted a nervous side glance at each other. Fuck… \"It was an impossible mess ! There's no way to get arrest by these fucking cops! \" All of a sudden Erik took out two guns, explaining that they were Springfield 45 and even the police didn't have better gun. Jenko and Schmidt were in panic ! Did Erik uncover everything and planned to kill them ? « You, » He told Jenko « I'm sure you know how to use a gun!\" No no no no ! They couldn't even call for back up ! And what was this scene ? Jenko turned his head and saw the sea behind them. So Erik was going to kill them and throw them in the water... \"Erik listen\" tried in vain Schmidt. But Erik wasn't listening and continued with his panic attack : \"You know what they do to guys like me in prison eh ! That rhymes with grape ... grape. » Jenko watched Erik and couldn't help feeling pain for him. He knew what Erik would suffer in prison and it revolted him, but what could he do ? Justice was justice, and Erik couldn't avoid going in jail. However, now what mattered was that he and Schmidt avoid getting themselves killed. Erik continued to chant, panicking and pointing his weapons at them. An accidental shot was so fast gone. It was then that the young dealer turned to them, a calmer look on his face: \"After seeing the mess you left in the theater I realized one thing ...\" His tone was darker and his look desperate. Oh shit ! Said Jenko to himself, it's over ! \"I realized that you were really close ...\" said Erik with a sigh. And he gave them his guns. Jenko could hear his neighbor's sigh of relief. He fell himself relax too. Hell, it was close and Schmidt who was very close to spilling everything too ! Erik pulled back and continued to explain that the day of the ball, Domingo and his band would come to retrieve some other piñatas, but he was afraid that they would try something against him. So he needed Jenko and Schmidt to serve as his bodyguards. The young dealer guided them to old cans made available to help them to train with the guns. They had to be ready on time, but the two officers had no difficulty, what impressed Erik but also Amir who was still behing, leaning on the car. \"Wow ! Guys ! Where did you learn that ? \"Say Erik flabbergasted. \"Oh you know ... beginner's luck ! » Erik began to applaud, visibly relieved and happy. He also gave a high five to the policemen. Jenko watched him afterwards. So that's what put him in such a state ? Bloody Erik ! The latter feeling that he was being starred at turned to Jenko and gave the letter a true warm smile. Then he bit his lower lip not leaving Jenko's eyes. Jenko was beginning to feel a tingle, it's been so long sin- « Let's go ! » Erik and Jenko turned like one man to Schmidt who looked at them suspiciously at what he had just seen. Jenko cleared his throat before moving a hand through his hair and following Erik to the car. What if Schmidt was suspecting them? Erik walked them up to their home and thanked them before leaving. Both officers were left alone on the sidewalk in front of the house of the smaller one. \"Well, I suppose you're going to stay in the end ? \"Asked Schmidt hesitantly. Jenko nodded at him. They had things to catch up. \"Tomorrow, we'll be back at Jump Street and will notify Dickson. But before that ... could you help me with my stuffs ?\" Schmidt gave him a smile before the two teammates high fived: They were back on track ! While Jenko was putting order in his, his phone vibrated: From: Erik \"Thank you and sorry.\" Jenko had a smile and threw himself on the mattress before responding to the message: From: Greg \"You could have told me that this was what was bugging you.\" The answer wasn't long to come. From: Erik \"Didn't I tell you everybody has secrets? Come to my house tomorrow, I owe you a meal.\" Jenko looked at the response somewhat doubtful. Was he not supposed to have more or less broken with the young drug dealer's heart? He turned his phone several times in his hands before replying that he would come. Erik's answer arrived soon: I can't wait . Me too thought Jenko, if he could he would go straight to his home but he knew that Schmidt would have one too many questions. He had seen on their way back that his teammate kept casting side eye glances to him and Erik, plus the latter kept looking at Jenko in the mirror. « Dude, I'm really glad we are reconciled. \"Jenko looked up, as he lay on the mattress to see Schmidt on near the doorframe. « Yeah ... Thanks Erik. Any news from Molly? » He suspected that the girl was still holding the same grudge against his teammate with the Peter Pan gate. She was more mad at him but Jenko didn't care, he did care for his friend though. « No, she doesn't want to hear anything from me. » « Oh ! » Schmidt walked to his bed and threw himself on it, he lay looking at Jenko. Then after a while he began to speak: \"And you with Erik? » Jenko glanced at him more than surprised. He remained silent for a moment before speaking: \"What do you mean ? Me with Erik ? » \"I know something is going on between you two...\" A shiver ran through the body of Jenko. \"... or more like he is hitting on you. It is slightly disturbing, I thought he was going to kiss you earlier. » Well Erik would have if he could get away with it. But Jenko shrugged in response. Not denying, not confirming. Maybe he would confess to his teammate that something had actually happened between them once everything was finished, but for now it was not necessary. He turned in his mattress ready to sleep. Only a few days and everything will be over. xXx The next day, Schmidt and Jenko returned at Jump Street to apologize, and then they told Dickson the new plan. The lieutenant had hit on his desk, shouted, insulted, but still allowed them to follow their investigation. Chief Hardy also had put in his two cents, saying that they had no more room for error. In the late afternoon, Jenko went to Erik's. He had managed to escape from Schmidt by claiming he had business to do in his apartment. Schmidt shrugged, but Anna had looked at him suspiciously. He didn't like that sixth sense some women had, moreover when she escorted him to the door, she had slipped softly: « What is her name ? » « What ? » And she gave him a big smile, slipping him that he shouldn't forget to protect himself ... like he was a teenager. It was also one of the reasons he loved Schmidt's mother: open and attentive, although sometimes she was a little weird. The ride to the Molson passed by quickly. Jenko entered the residence, passed through the garden to get to the living room and saw with surprise that there were people in there. Indeed, in the living room were Erik's friends that the officer had met during their many hangouts. He greeted everyone, quite happy to see them. It wasn't high school students, but students at Berkeley who also had no problem with the fact that Erik was in a relationship with a guy. If he remembered well, one of them was gay himself However, approaching the owner of the house, who was in the middle of the large living room, beers in hand and a big smile looking at him; Jenko really didn't know how to react. Erik came to him, sticking almost against his chest and greeted him. Jenko questioned himself : should he kiss him ? But the question remained unsolved when he heard their names being called, the game was starting. Jenko had totally forgotten that the championship season was going on. With everything that was going on lately he hadn't had the opportunity to follow anything. The officer approached the couch to sit and was surprised to see that after that Erik moved next to him, bringing his back against his chest while laying his head in his neck. As if it was nothing ... Jenko raised his eyebrows surprised, but again, his thoughts didn't go very far when one of the guys handed him a beer. The officer thanked him before uncapping the bottle, launching the cap on the coffee table and kissing Erik's forehead before putting his arm around his waist to get him impossibly closer. Erik just twinned their fingers together. Again like it was nothing. Why question everything? Jenko was there to chill. The rest of the evening went well: Game watching and pizza eating. Jenko had whispered asked to Erik where was the famous meal that he was supposed to prepare for him. The latter laughed, responding that when he started cooking (Italian), his buddies crashed his house to watch the game. The youngest promised they would catch up once they were alone... Erik raised his head to put his lips on Jenko's. First, just a peck before kissing him again and enjoying the kiss. That got them a pillow in the face from the others in the room. The officer loved and hated the teasing smile that the young dealer was giving him. Oh, he had no doubt he was going to sleep at Erik's tonight, but ... he couldn't undo the fact that he was lying in that relationship. Two hours passed before the others took their leave. They were taking off to a pub in town. They had offered to Jenko and Erik to follow but the latter had driven them away, wanting to be alone with his boyfriend . While Jenko stretched at his full length on the couch with Erik above him, he remembered a story. \"Looking back, why did you come and talk to us that day? We had just landed and Sch - Doug had a crush on Molly, but ... I thought to myself, why? » Erik looked down at him and laid his head on his arms that he had crossed on Jenko's chest. « Why not? »He replied nonchalantly. Jenko sighed, rolling his eyes before pinching his boyfriend 's side. \"Hey! \"Erik laughed and began fidgeting « Maybe because I knew you were going to have problems from day one. Dude! You came with the most polluting XF parked in a disabled parking spot. You thought this was the in 80's didn't you? Only old people do that! \" Ok, he was 7 years older than Erik but that was no reason to say he was has been. Jenko redoubled his tickling of the young dealer before taking him in his arms and putting him on top of him. Erik stopped laughing but had a frank smile on his face. Jenko tightened his arms around his waist to tighten against him and kiss him again. Erik was quick to respond to the kiss passionately and started rubbing himself against the him, grabbing his ass and pulling him closer. Jenko groaned into the kiss when he felt that Erik was becoming as hard as him through his jeans. The movements became rushed as the heat rose and clothes were disappearing. Shirts were removed, belts unbuckled, zips opened. \"Are you sure no one will disturb us? \"Said Jenko hot breaths gushing when Erik put began stocking him on top of his briefs. \"If you are wondering about Miranda ... ah ... She ... she ... fuck Brad ...\" Jenko was doing the same thing Erik was while sucking on his neck \"Nobody. No One. \"Gasped the young man as he left the policeman do what he wanted. Jenko was elsewhere. Eyes closed, enjoying the friction when all of the sudden Erik stood. Leaving him cold on the couch: \"What the fuck! Erik! » But the young man came back a moment later and threw himself on Jenko on the couch, after placing two things on the table: lube and a condom. The policeman had no time to take in account what was what that Erik had his head above his crotch. He lowered his pants and boxers, letting out his hard cock which stood facing the young man's head. He did not hesitate a second before taking it in his mouth and licking it hungrily. Jenko growled his pleasure, hands in his taking, urging him to take him further. \"Damn! How can you be so good! \"He groaned, while Erik was accelerating his. Those lips were doing wonders but he had no intention of coming this fast. He jerked Erik off his cook and threw him on the sofa. Jenko took off his pants and boxers and settled at full length on him. He connected their bodies and started to rub their lengths together. The kiss was hot and passionate. He reached for the lube and squeezed some on two fingers. He paused the kiss, looked in his man's eyes before getting thos two deep inside of him. He was rewarded with a deep groan that aroused him impossibly further. Erik was biting his lips, he looked like sin and Jenko was living off that sight. He added another finger. \"Fuck ... Brad ... you ... ah ... you would rather not put another ... oh ... fuck ... thing. » Jenko smiled, taking pleasure in watching the younger while stretching him further: \"Why don't you touch yourself while I'm getting you ready. \" He said, voice teasing. Erik did as he as told. He brought one of his hands on his very hard penis and began to stroking it long and hard, not leaving the Jenko's eyes. Jenko was becoming harder and harder. Fuck! Placing the condom on his rod was challenging and Erik placing his ass near his dick while still stroking himself wasn't helping get anything done. Jenko began touching himself to. Jenko raised legs Erik against his hips and entered him slowly. It was soft and rhythmic. The youngest was scratching his back. It was burning and passionate. Cries and moans invaded the room. Jenko loved it when Erik moaned against his ear and whispered things to him, biting his lobe, enticing him. The deepest sounds warned them of their upcoming orgasms. They collapsed on the sofa in a pile of limbs, Jenko starring at the ceiling. Thinking he just had sex with a high school student was nowhere near his mind. \"What' up? \"Asked the youngest, smiling up at hi, obviously very happy with their little exchange. \"Nothing. \" \"Really? \" Erik leaned over to kiss him gently and place a hand on his chest. \"Fine. I'm taking a shower! \" Erik was about to rise when Jenko held his arm and brought him closer to him to hold him in his arms. It was usually Erik's move, the emotional one. Jenko never initiated. But this once he just wanted a moment with him. Caress him, kiss him and bash in this feeling. \"Brad? \"Erik's voice was worried as he tightened the embrace. \"Shh, just enjoy. » ... It was most likely the last time they would be like this. AND THAT IT FOR THE DAY 3 I'm waiting for your feedback ;)[Chapter 13] And the last chapter before the epilogue... Yes, in two part, because... because it's better ! Enjoy ! Exposed - part one The days before the ball were morose for Greg \"Jenko\". He had decided to stop seeing Erik, in order focus on the mission because he and Schmidt were betting big. He didn't want to return to traffic, they deserved to get to a higher grade and the only way to do that was to succeed in this mission. He just now thought that Erik could say in his statement that he had taken advantage of him... He could even talk about rape if he was out for revenge. Seeing how he got money, he could hire the best lawyers and Jenko would sink right alongside him … Yes, that made him highly uncomfortable. He really missed him and that evening was magic. Under a fluff, they had talked, laughed, cuddled, had sex again before falling asleep in each other's hands. No one to wake them up in the morning. Perfect evening. Now he was in Schmidt's bathroom, trying to tie his tie for the ball. The other was there too. Both of them were somewhat nervous. \"Give it to me, you'll choke yourself at that rate.\" Said Schmidt, taking the tie for himself and handing Jenko his bow tie. \"Your gun is hanging, someone could see it\" It was now Jenko's turn to help Schmidt. They would stop at anything to stop this dealing ring, that's how they had taught. \"Dude, do you think we'll do it? \"Asked the smaller unsure of himself. Even if Erik had asked them to be their bodyguards, they had been taught to always have some kind of back up. \"I have some contacts that could help us...\" Jenko said before making some calls. They hadn't thought of coming to the dance tonight but now they would. \"But we also need bridle and a limo! Otherwise that won't do! \"Said Schmidt following Jenko through the house. \"Sure, but we can ask the girls to help us. \"Jenko answered by taking his phone and dialing a number. Schmidt followed him into his room not getting it. What girls? Fugazi and her team mate? They did not like him so he did not see why they would help them. \"Yes Bella, it's Jenko. You're not at the office are you? \" Schmidt did get it now. Jenko was talking about Cinnamon and her girl friends, the prostitutes they used to see in the police station. Moreover, Schmidt always wondered if they weren't spending more time at the post office than in the streets. They were always smiling and didn't seem disturbed in the least by being arrested. Plus they were nice and funny. Schmidt sat on his bed and watched his teammate call to rent the limo and ... doves ? \"Dude! \"Schmidt tried in vain but Jenko wasn't listening and asked a dozen of them. Was it really necessary? Jenko replied that nothing was too good for prom night. After all they didn't get to go to prom so they would give everything to this one. Well, Schmidt shrugged, if they had to risk their lives they might as well be the stars of the evening. Suddenly Schmidt caught something in the living room as he passed in front of the photo wall. One photo in particular caught his attention. A picture from middle school. He was overweight and had a curly tuft on his head. However on the photo he was not alone, he was next by another young man who had his head hidden with a soccer ball. Schmidt always wondered why his parents kept this photo but now that he thought about it, that photo did not seem as alien as before to him, he couldn't pinpoint why ... Jenko coming by cut him off his thoughts. High Five, they were going to smash this ! Xxx Indeed the made quite an entrance. Rock star like. The limousine, doves, the girls & the Nerds. They were fabulous and those outside were looking at them with envy. Although some questioned the age of the young ladies, but the look Jenko gave them remind them silenced. Both the doormen at the entrance let them in without problem. Tonight's theme was \" An evening in Tijuana \" and all the students were happy to found themselves there and dance to celebrate the end of the year. The small group split apart and Jenko tried not to get noticed. He was trying to avoid the headmaster but stumbled upon someone worse: Mrs Griggs. \"Brad, Brad what are you doing here? You're not supposed to be here, the headmaster said ... Oh no, this is a no no, really not good ! \" She wasn't making any sense. \"I'm glad to see you but it is bad. Stay . \" Jenko laughed to hide his incomprehension and the embarrassment of his young science teacher. It was funny to see her like that, in the end he was more sorry for her than anything else, but when she slapped him for no reason, he wondered if it wasn't better to just arrest her. But she's disappeared as quickly as the slap on his cheek came. \"Wild eh? \" Jenko turned to see Erik big smile on his lips in front of him. Hands in the pockets, he was clad in a suit that probably cost half in yearly pay. \"Hey. \" \"Hey. \" They stood at a safe distance, but they could not leave each other's gaze. Then Erik walked past Jenko telling him to follow him, they passed through the crowd, but no one paid attention to them. To see the state of some students, the officer was sure more than one had consumed either drugs or alcohol. Or both. They came to the drinks' table and Erik poured a glass for Jenko telling him that it was non-alcoholic. \"Did Molly say something ? \"Jenko had not yet had the opportunity to ask his boyfriend how the girl had taken their break up. Moreover he did not want to pinpoint he was a no show for Erik these past few days. \" No. She just asked if I left her for you.\" Erik quietly drank his glass by scanning the room. Jenko gasped in his glass. Had they been that obvious for Molly and Schmidt realize the truth? Although they were often together these past few months, but that did not necessarily mean they were ... yes, a couple. \"And ? \" The policeman asked waiting. \" And what ? I said yes, of course. \" Erik shrugged and ran his hand along Jenko's back discreetly. Certainly, where they were, nobody could see them but he still would have liked for his drink to be alcoholic. He just shrugged his head. \"You know, I was thinking that once the transaction is finished, the holidays will be here ...\" said the youngest. \"We could go a week or two in Europe ? We would go to France, you said you spent some time there. \" Jenko looked down at his neighbor. He preferred to remain silent and was really happy to see Tommy head over, telling them that Domingo and his gang would be arriving soon. The officer followed them but Erik's question was making a loop in his head. How could he tell him that at the end of today he would head to prison. Obviously if things had been different, he would have gladly accepted but there... They took Schmidt in the crowd who was talking with Molly. Looking at her, the poor girl was dancing alone and seemed drugged. But there was no room to worry about her. However, more time was passing, things just got worse. Jenko would have preferred to take care of Molly. Because once again things did not go at all as planned. First, when they returned to the hotel room and saw that it was Mr Walter the supplier Schmidt was flabbergasted. Not thinking that this simple teacher could be a drug dealer. Was a teacher's salary that low that he had to be a drug dealer? Bullshit! While the two officers had found him strange the first time they had seen him, they never suspected anything. And Erik had said something that put Jenko ill at ease: \"How will you make friends with this behavior, we must give a chance to every guy dude. \" But the young man was quickly put back in his place. If he knew... However, what surprised them more was when Molly arrived much later - probably between the third and fourth phase of HFS - completely berserk. Shouting against Schmidt and tapping against the door that he was a fucking cop, a fucking liar and a fucking jerk. You just had to see Domingo's and his gang's face at the time. Not to mention Erik's. \"Dude ! You are a fucking cop !\" His anger had turned to Schmidt \"And you gave me this bracelet\" Jenko rolled his eyes as the youngest vanity. And things escalated quickly after that. Was it when Molly came in the room? Or when two of the ZZTops turned out to be undercover agents and shots began to be fired from everywhere. Jenko barely had time to see Erik disappear in a side room and Mr Walter took Molly as a hostage. It was hell. Shots fired from left to right and them, Jenko and Schmidt, were behind the sofa trying to survive. \"Let's make it baby\" it was said in the move and Schmidt looked at his teammate disillusioned not expecting it. They were not going to die in here! \"We need to get out of here man! \" That's what they tried to do after that, leaping above their couch heroically, weapon in hand, defying whoever tried to aim for them but unfortunately Schmidt tripped in sofa and fell miserably. The two police officers were cornered, when they heard: \"Throw your weapon son of a bitch, if you don't want me to shoot you! \" That voice ... \"Ah! You too you are ... \"A new shot was heard and the sound of a body that fell heavily to the ground. It came from the next room. From where the two policemen were, they could see arms on the floor. Guessing very well that the man was dead. Jenko looked into Schmidt's eyes who was as surprised as him. Yes, they both recognized that voice . tututututututu Part two coming soon[Chapter 14] And the part two of the last chapter of this fic ! Enfiiiinnnnnn Hope you like it ! Exposed-part two Jenko and Schmidt got up slowly, fearing a stray bullet but to their surprise nothing was heard. No shots or screams or anything, except Erik who returned into the room holding a gun in hand. Erik? A weapon in hand ? \"What the ... Erik! \"Said Schmidt approaching him more than surprised by this turn around situation\" Duudee you killed a guy! \" Erik turned to them, surprised as well, obviously he did not expect to find them there. Schmidt took him by the shoulders: \"It's okay dude, are you going in to shock ? \" \"Schmidt ...\" Said gently Jenko who also seemed put out next to him. \"I would never have done such a thing,\" continued the smallest police to the attention of Erik who was left speechless and spent his gaze to Schmidt to Jenko eyes wide open. Jenko frowned. What was happening ? Since when Erik did knew how to use a gun? It must be said that when the young dealer had come to see them, he did not seem to know how to handle a gun and was completely panicking. \" Schmidt! \"This time Jenko was sure something was wrong! He forgot that he had just called his teammate by his real name, not the fake name. But he soon had the answer when he heard \" Eric! Eric! You hear me ! \"Coming from a walkie-talkie The room was silent until Erik opened his jacket to get out a walkie-talkie under the dumbfounded eyes of Jenko and Schmidt. \"Yes, I'm listening Miranda ...\" \" We heard shots. How are the other agents ? \" \"They had Tom and Doug. As for Schmidt and Jenko they're fine. The situation turned red. The main suspect had an hostage and Domingo and his team are on the run. I'm going after them. I will keep informed. \" And he cut off during the conversation. Miranda ? \"Listen! I do not have time to explain, we must move quickly! \"Told Erik heading towards the exit. \" NO ! \" Shouted Jenko who had just come out of his lethargy and had to understand what was happening. \"You're a fucking cop ! A COP ! \" He raised his arms to the sky disappointed \"Why you did not tell me ! \"Jenko came close to Erik to shake him by the shoulders. \"Let me go Jenko, they will escape us! \" \"Jenko ! \" Erik and Jenko turned as a one man to Schmidt who appointed to a guy from Domingo's who tried to escape, the one Schmidt threw his gun to knock him out. Jenko pushed Erik and did not hesitate for a second to get in the back of the man who fell to earth. A silence followed the shot. \"Great homie ! \" congratulated Schmidt still stunned by the gesture of his colleague. \"Can we go now ?\" Erik called them out somewhat jaded. And the three cops left the hotel room. On the way Schmidt reminded Jenko he had just killed his first man. Which caused him to vomit on the oldest one. Erik rolled his eyes at them. They crossed the ballroom and saw their own photo. Schmidt stopped to look. Seven months had already passed, time passed quickly, but he was shot out of his reverie by Jenko who pushed him towards the exit. Once in the parking lot they saw Domingo ride in a limo, they tried to stop it by shooting the car, but barely missed, they escaped. Schmidt rushed to their limousine and managed to climb over the hood, but he did not really have time to goat at to his teammate who had cornered Erik. He pinned against the car and looked him straight in the eye: \" Your name ! \" barked Jenko annoyed Jenko, his hands on Erik' shoulders. \"Jenko ...\" Tried to calm down Schmidt somewhat worried. \"Detective Eric Valens \" Erik replied, with a grin. \"Why did not you tell me ! You know that I have been worried for weeks ... \" \" What are you talking about ? \"Schmidt asked suspiciously. \"Jenko was my boyfriend. \" Eric replied nonchalantly turning his head to the other agent. \"WHAT! I knew it... \" \" Fuck ! But did you not have a thought about my state all that time ?! \" Jenko said annoyed by holding his head in his hands\" I thought I was a pedophile, that I had commited rape, I could already picture myself in prison. \" \"Jenko, do you want Molly dead ? \"Eric got mad,\" I do not think you want to leave the Police like this huh? \" Jenko pulled back to stare Erik. Schmidt behind the wheel and Eric on the back. Schmidt looked back, before saying softly to his teammate: \" You have… …. You know ... together ? \" \"Believe me, you do not want to know. \"Replied the raven, who had heard with a smile. \"Shit ...\" \"START\" said Jenko annoyed looking straight ahead. Schmidt started the engine and the a chase started through the streets of Metairie. Walter's limousine followed by Domingo's and finally by the policemen's. After a time the chief of the band tried to shoot them. The bastard's aim was killer ! While Schmidt took a wrong turn, the two policemen in front heard a thump on the back, but they did not took it into account. It had to do something against Domingo! \"Eric! Can you not do something? \"Turned Jenko in the heat of action, but no answer came to him. He turned to look and saw Eric down against the seat but strangely this one was not moving. Then, in moving to the quarterdeck he saw that something was wrong: Eric had lost consciousness. He had taken the luminous ball against the head. Jenko watched and sighed heavily. Detective Eric Valens eh ? After about twenty minutes of chase, a lesson about on atoms explosive by Jenko - something that took completely unprepared Schmidt, both officers successfully detonated the limousine stopped Domingo and stop Mr Walter's in stride. However, the sports teacher wasn't caving. After managing to get out of the limo, he shot the arm of Jenko who lost his weapon. The biggest screamed and turned to his teammate: There remained only him to master the situation. Schmidt took to turn his gun and pointed Walter, but he had taken the body of Molly as a shield. \"Go Schmidt you can do it\" encouraged Jenko whose arm continued to bleed. But the officer was afraid and if he shoot Molly ? However, he had no choice. He had to. To Molly, for Jenko, but especially for him. If he failed to shoot, he could never become the policeman he wanted. He too could become as charismatic as Jenko and forget any he was no longer Schmidt, one we laughed and did not have the stature of a policeman. Make them forget that he was invisible. His hand trembled. Walter went threatened Molly. Jenko continued to bleed and encouraged. A single shot part ... ... And in the middle of the crotch. Walter then made a sound not very masculine before he's releasing Molly and withdraw into himself. \" Ah ah ah ah ! \" Schmidt turned to Jenko who gave him a big smile - finally something that approached the grimace, saw suffering in his shoulder. But despite all that, the most important had happened. Yes! They managed their first mission! Their first arrests ! Jenko and Schmidt threw as one man on Walter to arrest him and handcuff him to finally dictate the Miranda law. In the end, all was well that ended well . . . . After going through the doctor box Jenko waited quietly on the hood of the limo. The reinforcements came a moment later and agitation was put around it. They had just finished his bandage off and he watched Molly and Schmidt, the young woman had a blanket around her shoulders, obviously in shock. Their first mission! \"Congratulations.\" Jenko turned and saw Erik before him ... or should we rather say ... well ... Eric . He stared at the bottom to top. The brown was still wearing his costume, but this time a badge was clearly visible around his neck. Confirming that he was well and truly one of the house. Jenko did not a word while Eric approached him. \"Listen Jenko ... I had to keep quiet for the sake of the mission. You saw that it was an undercover right? \" said Eric to justify its conduct from the beginning. On that point, he was right, but Jenko is still mad. Actually, he was confused and didn't manage to assimilate information. How would he really take ? \"Detective ? \"ask Jenko surprised after a moment pointing with his good arm the badge. \"Yes, the division of narcotics, but I often collaborates with the Jump Street unit, it must say that ... I have the assets to\" Eric replied in a big reassuring smile. Jenko watched and smiled in turn. \"But ... They left you alone for Molly? And could you keep your real name? \"If asked Jenko. \"There are things that a detective can do and not an agent, and then if I can reassure you, we have not slept together. I told her that I was vows of chastity. \" \"And Miranda? \"Following Jenko on the lookout for questions, it must be said that he had much in mind right now. All that seemed incredible, but the conversation going it seemed more coherent. \"My teammate. You were not supposed to see her that night. She ... sort of panicked. But you will see it is adorable. \" If Jenko could avoid her, he would be grateful. The officer watched Eric upwards, then shook his head. He could not deny to himself he was still attracted to him. Also now that he had plenty of space ... The detective moved closer and put his hands on the thighs of Jenko: \"However, now that you're relieved not to have made statutory rape, and therefore not to find you in jail, nothing prevents us to continue us. \"Eric had slipped his last two words approaching the police. Without waiting for a response from Jenko, Eric kissed him gently but the last is not held, grabbed him by the waist to the stick against him to properly embrace adult to adult. He would think the consequences later, ie the fact that his colleagues looked at the scene with the big eyes of surprised ... Near to Molly and Schmidt, they watched the scene a little further ahead, mouths open in surprise. \"Why ... Erik kiss Brad ? \"Molly was stunned. \"I am still under the effect of HFS? \"And she turned to Schmidt who shrugged not knowing what else to say. Eric stepped back when he heard his name called in the distance. The hot look, he did not leave the Jenko eyes while walking backwards. He imitated a phone with his hand and made to Jenko \"Find my number and call me! \" Jenko watched him go, biting his lip. Finally, was it really necessary to get away from Eric? But at least now, he had no need to worry, no criminal record, no radiation, no judgment and certainly not in prison. Nevertheless, Eric still need to pays! It was then, when turning to his teammate, he saw Schmidt kissing Molly. Definitely. \" So ? \" Schmidt came to see his teammate, once the nurses asked him to let Molly rest and sat beside him. \"You could go to jail ...\" noted Schmidt. Jenko looked slanted \"you don't come to kiss a minor? \" Schmidt laughed followed closely by his teammate. They gave a high five. They looked each other with a big smile before a realization suddenly hits Schmidt. \" Fuck ! \"Cried the smallest of the police by jumping from the hood of the car. Jenko turned to him while his teammate took the head in his hands while still insulting the world. \"Eric ... Eric fucking Valens ! Eric I pee in my pants in college fucking Valens crying out loud! FUCK IT! \" Jenko still do not understand the behavior of Schmidt. The latter turned to him waving his arms: \"Duuuuude ! I was at the same college that Eric! He was in the football team and spend time complaining! It was the best but ... \" \"Seriously ? \"Interrupted the Jenko. And Schmidt began to tell how in college, they hated but stayed together and how his mother loved Eric before he moved. Jenko went white while Schmidt realized that all along the mission he had been had. The two policemen looked annoyed before making a \"fuck\" in unison. Thus ended this first mission. And that's it ! There juste miss the epilogue and a long blabla, and I finished this fic for good By the way, don't I had said that I recently came across the information that Dave Franco and Johan Hill had already played together. So is was just perfect to place in this story ) Go more than the outcome![Chapter 15] When I thinking this fic was load in 2013... ah la la, I hope the next time, I didn't wait this long to update, now I'm better in english (I work with in environnement whom I force to used english everyday and as I read fanfic in english everyday too... because many of my fav ship doesn't have fic in french... bref) - I hope i didn't have to wait this long (love my beta) to upload- Again: thanks a lot to read and review this fic ! send you many heart - Epilogue Every mission must come to an end. Three weeks had gone by since agents Schmidt and Jenko arrested Mr Walter and the rest of Domingo's gang. Dickson had later handed their first act of arrest to the applause of the Jump Street team, but the downside was that they would be sent on a mission in University. Schmidt had had a big smile and Jenko - again - had wanted to jump off a bridge. Oh no no no ! . . . Jenko parked his car in the police parking. He was happy to return to the post office, he missed it. Everything was as always, such as Cinnanom and her friends, always faithful to the post. Jenko greeted them in passing, promising to come back a little later. The girls wanted the details of his new romantic conquest that everyone was talking about in the hallways. He went up to the third floor of narcotics. Yes, everyone was aware of the passionate kiss exchange on the hood of the limo at the end of the mission. Every single police officer was present at the time. And those who weren't heard of it. \"Hey, but is it not that handsome gentleman? \" He was greeted with Maddie, the secretary of this floor. This old girl who loved relook younger and spent his time this file nails. Jenko approached her: \"It's been a while. \" \"Must I say I don't often see you here. \"Said the secretary,\" What brings you by ? \" \"Well, do you know where I could find Detective Valens ? \" Maddie overly chewed her chewing gum. \"And what do you want with Valens ? \"Her tone had become more suspicious, too much for a secretary. \"Maddie ... please! \"Jenko gave his best smile, leaning on the desk of the secretary, but he knew it was not enough. Oh no, he liked this woman, but a kiss was out of question. \" Here then ! \" Jenko jumped. This voice. Why people could not point out their presence by a simple \"hello\" or something. He turned and saw Miranda in front of him, arms crossed with a look of hatred mixed with suspicion that she kept for him specifically. Miranda, Eric's team mate. The policeman approached her, hypocritical smile: \"Miranda, my dear!\" She analyzed him, the look still on here face: \"And what do you want with Eric this time ? \" \"Just to see him. \" She stared at him before making a big sigh and to indicate a closed office down the hall. Their captain was on a two weeks' vacation, Eric had moved his business there for some time. Claiming he wanted calm because he was extremely irritable these recent weeks. Miranda asked him if he knew anything. Jenko replied in the negative. He thanked her and headed there. To tell the truth, he had not given any news to Eric for three weeks. This was his personal revenge. But he still hoped that vengeance would be of no real consequences because he really wanted to continue something with him ... The last three weeks were also morally hard to Greg Jenko. Learning that Eric was a DEA agent was too much. He had pictured himself in the judges' office, facing Eric's lawyers to answer the charges of rape and other offenses against minors. Having to explain, losing any credibility but especially losing his job ! Certainly he was extremely relieved that any of these things were not going to happen but he had felt somewhat betrayed. Because he was worried about Eric and his future, he was attached to him and even too much ... Yes, after learning the truth, he had gone and seen other people but it was mostly thinking: he really wanted to know who was this Eric Valens guy. Because even though everything seemed to be a lie, there was probably some truth in there. And with Eric Valens, the only real problem he could find was the omerta on office relationships but then they would not be the only ones breaking this law. Jenko arrived in front of the door and saw the plate attached above: Captain Holster. He knocked twice and the adolescent voice of the detective replied. Jenko was especially pleased with his effect when he saw the look that gave Eric him, a mixture of surprise and delight: \"Well, well, Brad Mcquaid, oh I mean Greg Jenko . I didn't ask a for a stripper I think not ... \" Jenko slowly entered the office, not understanding the stripper reference and closed the door behind him. \"Yet it would have been happy to show you my talents. \"Said Jenko. Eric stared at him with raised eyebrows, before putting his pen on the desk and standing up from his chair to approach his colleague. His office was given on other offices and from where he was, he saw Miranda looking at him while shaking her head. Eric waved his hand before closing the blinds. \"To what do I owe this visit officer, did I do something wrong?,\" said the young detective teasing Jenko in turn. The lattest took him by the waist and squeezed him against him \"I don't know, you tell me. \"Jenko replied in the same manner. Eric gave a hearty laugh before looking up at him and becoming more serious: \"Three weeks is a bit long without giving any news ...\" Jenko looked on the somewhat embarrassed side, Eric always against him: \" I am sorry. The end of the mission, all the paperwork, all that ... \" Eric nodded even though the biggest felt he could not believe a word. Eric also put his lips against him while looking at: \"Any other lies of this kind Agent Jenko or will you finally shut up and kiss me? \" Jenko laughed, but that did as he was told. He lifted the smaller by his thighs, sitted him on the table and embraced him. Ouch, he thought, those lips had really missed him. \"But tell me, Eric ... did you ever noticed that Schmidt and you were in middle school together? \" Eric pulled back and arched her eyebrows in surprise before a smile. \"Obviously. I thought my cover was about to be burned when I saw you but you have to believe that Schmidt has a short memory. I still afraid that his mother would see me and recognize me. \" That would have been a funny situation it that ever was the case. This could have been fun to se mama Schmidt react to that. \"But hey, we're not here to talk about that ...\" And Eric jumped him again. Jenko did not notice that his heart was pumping like crazy, too busy thinking that yes, after all, he wanted to try making things work with Eric Valens. From where she was, Miranda had not taken her eyes off the office and when she saw the blinds move abruptly, she sighed, rolling his eyes. They were incorrigible! \"What is happening there? \"Asked Maddie by her side, she also saw the most suspicious movements of the blinds. Miranda gave her a sideways glance before lifting her hands to heaven: \"Believe me: you do not want to know. \" Then she took her leave. To say that in a few months she would be on a mission again with Eric and the too other agents. Her head was pounding already. And that's it. Clap de fin.
