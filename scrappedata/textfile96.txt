This is from a movie that came on ABC onrnnight, no big thing, but I thought it was kinda interesting,rnexcept it was one of those movies that just did not end well. (Evenrnthough it was most likely based on a true story) still this is howrnit REALLY should have ended. Yes I have received MANY complaints tornput this in paragraphs so I finally Found some free time and gotrndown to it... Gwyn satrnstaring off at the land, while she thought of Philip II, the rightfulrnheir to the throne, the man she served while he fought for hisrncrown, and the man she would serve to defend it, but he was also thernman she fell completely in love with, much a surprise to herself.rnShe was dressed regally in a, slightly tight, white gown with herrnhair, decorated with a gold head band of flowers, resting on herrnhead for Phillip's coronation, and she was slightly surprised, yetrnalso excited when suddenly he spoke to her from behind her. Whenrnshe looked at him her heart skipped a beat, and unknown to her so didrnhis. He never wanted her to not want him and never wanted to notrnneed her, he needed a way for her to always be with him, if hernmarried her he would lose his throne, so he made her promise tornserve him the way her father (Robin Hood) served his father (Richardrnthe Lionheart) she promised, and then watched his coronation withrnpride and joy, she had helped put the right man on the thronerninstead of Prince John ruling England. Over the years theirrnlove never faded and secretly Phillip was going to arrange it so hernwould marry Gwyn, either to change the law (for it was prettyrnsilly marring for money and titles instead of love) or give her land,rntitles, and money for her to be noble enough for him to marry. Onernday , nearly five years after Phillips coronation Gwyn received arnroyal invitation, her hands shook just thinking about Phillip, shernslowly opened it up to read: Dear friend, It is my most humblernwish that you join me at my palace tonight, and please wear somethingrnamazing (as you always seem to anyhow) for me... Your KingrnPhillip II She stood in near shock, what could he want, why isrnshe supposed to be dressed nice. Then she realized she hadrnnothing really \"amazing\" since she still lived herrnnormal life, though she did have a large sum of money that Philliprnhad \"supposedly \" rewarded her with. She took enoughrnthat would pay for an \"amazing\" gown and adornments and herrnsmall but powerful dagger incase some fool would actually rob therndaughter of Robin Hood. After the afternoon was spent short with herrnshopping she returned home to make ready. As she called for arncarriage since she would not be riding in this for fear that shernwould be disheveled before even seeing Phillip. She seemed to floatrnup the stairs into the castle and guards had to look twice tornrealize that she was a trusted friend. As it happened Phillip plannedrnto make her Lady Gwyn tonight and wed her within a few months, sornnobility crowded the halls when Phillip did spot Gwyn he was sorn\"amazed\" that he could scarcely believe this was hisrnhero and lover. She saw his stare and blushed while she walkedrntowards him. As she reached five feet before him she stopped andrnas custom, curtsied, \" Your highness\" she spoke softly andrnsmiled as she raised back up and looked into his beautiful eyes. \"rnMy lady, you must have received my invitation for you DO lookrn\"amazing\". Phillip replied as he reached for her handrnand kissed it gently. \"Attention everyone!\" silencernfilled the room the minute he spoke. \"I have asked you all herernfor a very special honor. Yes there has been someone that helpedrnus long ago, alright maybe not that long ago, but without her,\" Atrnthis word Gwyn became very nervous and there was no hiding it. \"Irnwould not be here, Prince John would have been King and I would stillrnbe in France.\" \"booooooo\" was the reaction from therncourtiers. \"Gwyn, only daughter of Robin of Locksley, kneelrnbefore your King!\" Still in shock she slowly dropped to herrnknees and bowed her head before him \" I now declare you LadyrnGwyn of Locksley!\" cheering rang around the room she stood andrnsmiled at Phillip as he smiled back, and took her hand drawing herrncloser \" Stay late I must talk to you in private\". As hernpulled away from her he smiled and she became worried and nervousrnabout what he must talk to her about. The party ran on withrndancing, feasting, and gossiping. When everyone finally left Gwynrnstayed on the other side of the room from Phillip, and he staredrnat her as he walked over, when he was sure no one was watching hernswooped her up in his arms and kissed her passionately. \" Irnhave been wanting that all night.\" he whispered in her earrngiving her chills. \" Gwyn I wanted to talk to you aboutrnus...\" before he could continue she said \"I thought wernhad this discussion about five years ago...\" then herninterrupted her \" that was different, you weren't noblernthen.\" knowing he had a point she held her tongue and waited forrnhim to do what he had to do. He got on his knee and took her handrn\"Gwyn, I know now I wanted to this ever since I tackled you tornthe ground because I thought you were some boy trying to steal myrnhorse,\" they both chuckled at that fond memory of their meeting \" then I realized you were a beautiful women trying to stealrnmy horse, but you stole my heart instead. Gwyn will you be my Queen?\"rnShe was shocked although she knew he would try this someday. Shernthought of how much she DID want this, and how much she wanted tornbe with him more, but she did enjoy riding her horse to fight thosernwho would mean harm to her King and all of England. \"Alright,rnbut only one condition.\" she spoke so softly she didn't hear herrnreply but he must have heard her \"What?\" Shernreplied with more strength this time \" Only if I can still be asrnfree as I have been these past five years.\" He considered itrnand knew his advisors would want the queen to have bodyguards withrnher every second, and how she would not enjoy it but he wouldrnhelp her with that because he knew how well she could take care ofrnherself. \" Alright, but you do realize you will havernbodyguards some of the time just not all of the time, you may bernpretty skillful with your bow but not ALWAYS with your brain\"rnhe lovingly joked at her. \" I remember hearing of an incidentrnwhen you thought you could defend yourself against nearly twentyrncastle guards, and ended up having to surrender and be rescued byrnyour father.\" \" Ohhh, alright then I will help my poorrnlittle boy rule his kingdom\" she joked back and they shared arnkiss to seal their agreement and she didn't notice until tenrnminutes later he had placed and engagement ring on her finger.

Too bad,rnthough. :( A Proposal and a Promise Philiprnfollowed Prince John back up the aisle of Westminster Abbey. \"Givernme my father's crown, sir,\" the young man announcedrncurtly. John looked as if he had just been sentenced to execution. \"This is ridiculous!\" he cried, already wellrnaware he had lost. Prince Philip signaled for the two nearest guardsrnto restrain his uncle. \"History will ignore you!\"rnshouted John. Gwyn was there to take the crown off his head, Johnrnglaring half-madly the entire time. The girl, however, took no noticernas she presented the headpiece to Philip. \"I am inrnyour service, your majesty,\" she said with a humble bow of herrnhead. The prince took it and held it high for all in the Abbey tornsee. Everyone- nobles, guards, priests- cheered. Gwyn couldn'trnhelp but join in. England would be safe once more. The threat of KingrnRichard's brother would linger over the land no longer. Prince Philip finally turned to his uncle, who appeared onrnthe verge of shock. \"You are hereby banished from England. Ifrnyou are found within these borders ever again, you will be capturedrnand hanged. Do you understand?\" John's eyesrnflashed up and he glared at the boy with as much hate as he couldrnmuster. \"You have no idea the greatness of this mistake. Butrnthe people will see in time. You will ruin this country! You-\"rnBut Philip waved his hands for the guards to escort the man out,rnPrince John struggling the whole way. One of the priestsrnhurried up the aisle with a pillow in his hands and held it up whenrnhe neared Philip. \"The, uh, crown, please if you, sire,\"rnthe man reminded, bowing his head to appear not as bold as hernmight've sounded. The prince returned the nod and gently setrnthe headpiece on the pillow. \"We did it, Gwyn,\"rnsaid Philip, turning back to her. He started. She wasn'trnthere. He quickly scanned the crowded room for the short, boyishrnhaircut, but it was nowhere to be found. The excited crowd was stillrncheering and all the noises drowned out the prince's calls ofrn\"Gwyn!\" Gwyn had slipped out of the Abbey beforernJohn had been removed. Now that one issue had been resolved, anotherrnone of similar importance had come to the forefront. Just as the girlrnreached her horse, she saw many men who had helped free Robin Hoodrnhurrying toward Westminster Abbey. Gwyn swiftly mounted the horse andrnnudged it in the direction of the small group with clicks of herrntongue and kicks to its sides. \"Uncle Tuck!\" sherncalled to the slightly plump friar leading the charge. The girlrnpulled her steed around again so it trotted in the same direction asrnthe man. \"Uncle Tuck, where is Froderick? Is he still in thernforest?\" \"Oh, no,\" the friar replied with arnshake of his balding head. \"I expect by now he's backrnhome. It wasn't a serious wound, Gwyn, really it wasn't.\"rnBefore he could ask about the situation at the Abbey, the girl hadrnalready spurred her horse into a gallop. No matter the speedrnof the beast, it was never fast enough. Why did she have to live sornfar away from Westminster Abbey? Gwyn thought it would take days tornreach her home. She wouldn't take anyone's word for it-rneven Friar Tuck's. She had to see Froderick for herself. Thernonly memory in her mind was of him diving in front of Prince Philiprnin the wood and taking the arrow. He had saved the prince'srnlife, keeping the heir to the throne alive so Prince John would havernno claim. But he had been wounded himself. Gwyn had had no time tornstick around and discover the seriousness of the arrow, but she wasrngoing to find out now. The girl was practically dismountingrnwhen the small, familiar collection of houses came into view. Sherndidn't even take her own horse to the stables- she jumped offrnand tossed the reigns to a friar passing by. Gwyn bolted all the wayrnto Froderick's room where she found another friar exiting,rnclosing the door behind himself. \"Is he well?\"rnquestioned Gwyn quickly. The man, who was holding a bowl of water,rnnodded. \"The injury is not too serious. He just needs time tornrest and heal in his own time.\" Of course, that was hisrnway of telling her to leave Froderick alone and stay out of his room.rnGwyn donned a meek expression and gave a humble bob of her head. Thernfriar smiled, figuring she would obey him, and walked toward thernkitchens. Only when Gwyn could no longer hear his footsteps did shernenter. Froderick looked sleeping comfortably in his bed. Hisrnright arm had been put in a sling and it made his chest look deformedrnunder a clean linen shirt. His other arm was on top of the blanketsrnand his hand was clenched around something small. In the eight yearsrnhe had been with her family, she had never seen him like this. It wasrnalmost frightening that he had been wounded. \"You fool !\" the girl cried, slamming the door behind her.rnFroderick was startled awake as she marched over and threw her armsrnaround him. \"You crazy fool!\" \"Gwyn? Ow-rnmy shoulder- let go!\" he shouted back. Gwyn released him andrnproceeded to find a chair to set beside the bed. \"So Irntake it your father is safe?\" said Froderick as the girl satrndown. She smiled. \"Yes, my father and Will Scarlett arernsafe, Prince John is banished from all of England and Prince Philiprnwill probably be coronated tomorrow.\" Froderick shiftedrnuneasily. \"I guess I should get used to calling yourn'your majesty,'\" he almost mumbled. To hisrnsurprise, Gwyn started laughing. \"No, silly,\" shernsaid with a shake of her head. \"Nothing of the sort. I am butrna commoner, as you know well.\" The girl's smile wanedrnand a sad expression lingered on her face. At Froderick'srnimmensely happier look, Gwyn's smile returned, though somewhatrnforced. \"I can't believe I missed all that. Itrnsounded like an exciting night,\" the boy said at last, breakingrnthe silence. Gwyn gave a shrug. \"Nothingrnextraordinary. But I can't believe you dived in frontrnof that arrow!\" So much amazement clung to her words that shernalmost sounded mad. \"What were you thinking? You'vernnever done anything like that before!\" \"Neverrndone anything that brave, you mean,\" replied Froderick quickly,rnstaring at her with mingled sadness and seriousness. \"Well...rnyes,\" she admitted at last as she tucked her hair behind anrnear. How Froderick hated her hair so short. It was so different andrnstrange looking. He hated it so much he liked it. \"But,\"rnGwyn spoke up, \"because you did, Philip is still alive and canrntake the throne. You may have single-handedly saved all of Englandrnfrom Prince John's tyranny.\" Her smile was infectiousrnand Froderick found himself grinning, too. \"So it'srna good thing I wasn't thinking then?\" he asked. Gwynrnlaughed again. \"A very good thing.\" The boyrnreached over and took her hand in his- which was awkward because hernhad to stretch his good arm across his body. \"Gwyn, ifrnI was brave like that all the time, would you like me better?\"rnThe girl vented a growl as she rolled her eyes. She withdrew her handrnand used it to lightly slap Froderick across the face. \"Stoprnit, I'm serious,\" Gwyn ordered. \"I like you justrnfine- I always have.\" \"Yes, but not in thernway-\" \"Are you hungry, Froderick?\"rninterrupted the girl quickly, standing up. Slowly, he nodded. Herndefeatedly ran a hand through his hair as he watched her leave. Whyrnwas he always saying things like that? Just as Froderick was planningrnsomething smart to say, Gwyn poked her head back into the room. \"You have another visitor.\" Prince Philip walkedrnin, nodded to Gwyn, and took the seat next to the wounded boy. \"Your highness,\" acknowledged Froderick with arnrespectful bob of his head. \"You're... you'rernvisiting me, sire?\" \"Yes, I come to offerrna proposition,\" the prince said in a formal air. - Gwynrnhurried around the kitchen, collecting a tray, dishes and silverware.rnShe knew every square inch of the place by heart and could findrnanything faster than the cooks. The few friars that happened to bernvisiting the kitchen at that late hour watched the womanrnsuspiciously; No one had really seen Gwyn since she had cut her hairrnand ridden off after her father. Once they realized it was RobinrnHood's daughter and not some starving thief, they continued tornstare at her insanely short haircut. Gwyn, though, didn'trnnotice. She was busy inspecting what had been made for the last meal.rnIt was cold and mostly made of pig liver. The girl vented a sigh.rnFroderick hated pig liver. However, he had always complemented Gwynrnon her vegetable soup. She never figured out why he praised somethingrnso mundane when the cooks were known to randomly prepare greatrnfeasts. This time, though, she was glad it was so easy. AsrnGwyn went across the room to fetch a pot, she finally noticed thernsmall crowd of friars staring at her. If they were just going tornstand there, they might as well be put to work. \"UnclernWilliam, would you please find me some vegetables... and UnclernThomas, if you would please cut them for me...\" And pretty soonrnthe entire group was under her command. The kitchen was bustling withrnas much activity after midnight as it was during the day. Withrnso much help, Gwyn had the soup ready in no time and she scooped somernout into a bowl. Along with earlier side dishes from dinner, she hadrna tray loaded with a full-coarse meal. Gwyn thanked all thernuncles as he left the kitchen. The girl didn't see a singlernsoul as she headed back for Froderick's room until she reachedrnhis door. There she ran into Friar Tuck, who had just returned fromrnWestminster Abbey. \"Are you still up, child? I thoughtrnyou would be sound asleep by now,\" commented the man. Gwyn gaverna shrug. \"I am more interested in Froderick'srnhealth than my own.\" A smile cracked on the old friar'srnface. \"And I'm sure the boy will be delightedrnto hear it.\" He paused and scanned the tray of food. \"Soup?rnThey didn't tell me they made soup...\" \"Oh,rnsome of the uncles and I made it just now,\" Gwyn replied,rnfighting back an impatient tone. She was two feet away from the doorrnand stuck there. \"For Froderick?\" \"Yes,rnuncle.\" At that Tuck's smile grew. \"Isrnit, now? Well, I shall hinder you no longer. Your father will be homernsoon. In a much better mood than he's been of late. Byrntomorrow, Froderick will be a real hero. Might not get much time withrnhim then,\" Tuck said. Gwyn cast him a questioning glance at thernunusual way he was talking. As the friar walked away, she could'vernsworn she heard him say something about \"young love.\" Gwyn dismissed those words with a shake of her head andrnentered the room. Froderick was alone. \"Have you beenrnwaiting long?\" she questioned as she made room on the bedsiderntable for the tray. \"No, the prince left only minutesrnago. He went with Friar Edmund to find a room for the night, ifrnyou're wondering.\" Gwyn sat in the chair next to his bedrnand gave him no answer. Her expression, however, clearly told himrn\"stop it.\" \"Vegetable soup? With thernonions and the celery...\" Froderick went on, observing the foodrntray. \"And the cabbage and potatoes and the bit ofrnsalt,\" added Gwyn with a knowing grin. \"You'rerntoo good to me,\" he said as he grabbed the tray. The girl hadrnto help him set it on his lap and he began shoveling spoonfuls intornhis mouth. Froderick nearly choked as he gave a severe hiss of pain. \"Well, it's still hot,\" Gwyn said almostrnreprimandingly. After a short pause, her voice returned to normal.rn\"So, what did Prince Philip say?\" Froderick then seemedrnto be taking an unnecessarily long time chewing his food. Finallyrnhe said, \"Just that he wants me to be on his council when he'srnmade king.\" \"Really? Oh, Froderick, that'srnfantastic!\" cried Gwyn with a huge smile. \"I am so happyrnfor you- it sounds exciting.\" \"It is, it reallyrnis great,\" the boy said in an unconvincing tone, absentlyrnpoking at the vegetables with his spoon. \"But I.. I'llrnbe going off to Spain for awhile.\" Froderick was slightlyrndisheartened that Gwyn still appeared excited. \"Spain?rnHow wonderful! How long will you be gone?\" \"Irnguess until I'm fluent in Spanish. That could take years,\"rnthe boy replied. Why did Gwyn still look happy? He wouldn'trnsee her for years and she was grinning like mad. Froderick went fromrnpoking the vegetables to viciously slashing at them. \"Irnthink it will be easy for you,\" the girl spoke up with a smile.rn\"Seeing as how you conquered Latin so quickly. You learned itrnmuch faster than me.\" \"Well, that's justrnbecause you never studied,\" said Froderick, shrugging. Gwynrntried to appear offended but couldn't hide her grin. \"Irnhope you write,\" she said at last after Froderick had eaten arnfew more bites. \"Of course. How else will your Latinrnimprove?\" \"You are not writing to me inrnLatin!\" protested Gwyn with widening eyes. \"Or Spanish.rnIf you do, I won't read them.\" The girl folded her armsrnacross her chest and stared playfully determinedly at him. Froderickrnshook his head. \"I'll pray for the poor soulrnwho becomes your Latin tutor,\" he said reverently. Gwyn startedrnlaughing again. Slowly the giggles died down and her smile waned asrnrealization struck her. \"I suppose archery won'trnbe quite as fun without you,\" sighed the girl. Froderick smiledrnto himself; she had finally gotten it. \"How can it getrnany worse for you? You always won,\" he replied with a mouthrnhalf full of food. \"You won sometimes,\" Gwynrnadded quickly. Her friend's head snapped up at that; hernclearly remembered the last time she was in his room- to stealrnclothes, no less- she had told him she let him win at archery. \"Let's not talk about that,\" saidrnFroderick before shoveling more soup into his mouth. \"Howrnis your arm, by the way?\" the girl asked at last, true concernrngrowing on her face. Froderick wiggled his arm a bit under his shirt. \"It's really the shoulder that was hurt. But tornheal best, I shouldn't use my arm at all. So for awhile Irnshall probably need much assistance,\" he said in a much morernlighthearted fashion than Gwyn would have expected. \"Wellrnthen, let me be the first to volunteer for the cause.\" \"Therncause?\" he repeated. \"The cause to help yournrecover,\" the girl said simply. Froderick laughed while tryingrnto swallow a spoonful of soup. He almost choked. \"Ifrnthat be the case, I might never want to heal.\" Immediatelyrnafter, an awkward silence settled over the both of them, making Gwynrnstare at her folded hands and Froderick at his nearly empty bowl. \"I always find myself saying things like that, don'trnI?\" he spoke up at last, somewhat quietly. Gwyn looked at himrnas if she was at a loss for words. \"Well... you, um...rnyou say what's on your mind and that is a good quality... Irnguess,\" she ended meekly. \"You're justrnsaying that, but you really don't think so, do you?\"rnFroderick questioned, staring straight into her eyes. \"If Irnalways knew what to say- if I could always say something smart- wouldrnyou like m-\" He was cut off when Gwyn leaned forward andrnclapped a hand over his mouth. \"I know what you'rerngoing to say. Don't say it ,\" she ordered. Onlyrnwhen Froderick gave a faint nod did she let go. \"You reallyrnneed to stop doing things just for me. You don't have tornchange to please me or my father or the uncles or anyone. Just startrndoing things for yourself. And for the love of King Richard, build uprnsome confidence, man!\" Froderick returned the food trayrnto the side table, thinking over her advice. \"Do something forrnmyself,\" he mumbled as he began trying to push his bed coversrnoff of him. Gwyn had to help for it was slow going with only onernhand. He climbed of bed, muttering, \"build some confidence...\" \"Where are you going?\" the girl asked quickly asrnhe headed for the door. \"To do something for myself,\"rnreplied Froderick without a glance back at her. Both curious andrnworried, Gwyn followed him out of his room and to the outside. Thernwaning moon cast a bleak glow over the landscape, making nothingrnappear warm or inviting. Froderick was only noticeable by his cleanrnwhite shirt; everything else blended in with the growing shadows.rnGwyn followed him all the way to the edge of the small cluster ofrnhouses where a few trees lined the road. A little further on, thernforest started. The girl wondered where he was heading inrnsuch a determined march. She would've asked him again, but shernfeared she would awake sleeping friars. Froderick stoppedrnhalfway between the houses and the forest, right next to a knarledrntree with many low-hanging branches. He seemed to be inspecting therntree as he waited for Gwyn to catch up. \"What arernyou doing?\" she hissed quietly; being outside at night justrnmade her want to whisper. Froderick replied in the same quiet tone.rn\"Remember this?\" \"I remember climbing itrntogether when we were younger. I was fascinated with it because itrnwas so tall and easy to climb. But why-\" \"Yourngave me this here,\" the boy interrupted, opening his hand tornshow a plain silver ring. It was the only thing that was enhanced byrnthe moonlight. \"My mother's,\" smiledrnGwyn. \"Were we playing we were getting married?\" \"Yourntold me that out of all the places of the country- towns, cities, orrneven Westminster Abbey- you wanted to get married right herernunderneath this tree.\" Gwyn couldn't help but smile atrnthe reminder, which in turn brought to her mind several more sillyrnchildhood memories. \"Well, Gwyn, so do I,\" thernboy said, breaking her thoughts. She looked up at him with a fadingrngrin. \"What exactly are you saying?\" In reply,rnFroderick reached out with his only usable arm, pulled her closer byrnher neck and kissed her. Gwyn had kissed him often, but theyrnboth knew it had meant nothing. They were just friendly littlerngestures of hers. But now, he wanted Gwyn to know this meantrnsomething. Froderick was trying to convey all his feelings for her inrnone kiss- and she got it. The girl didn't know howrnlong it took her to pull back. She was stunned and confused and shyrnand angry and embarrassed all at once. Gwyn wanted to punch him, yetrnat the same time she wanted him to kiss her again. Whatrnsurprised her even more was that Froderick didn'trnapologize. \"What I am saying, Gwyn,\" the boyrnspoke up after what seemed like forever, \"is that I don'trnwant to have lied to Prince Philip wen I told him we were betrothed.\"rnHe talked in a whisper, but in the soft darkness it seemed almost toornloud. \"Betrothed?\" Gwyn practically gasped. \"Yournwant... you want...\" \"I want to marry you,\"rnfinished Froderick, his manner exuding confidence. He brushed somernhair out of her face and tucked it behind her ear. \"But...rnyou are going to Spain and I shall be joining my father and helpingrnhim. I'm truly sorry, Froderick. I cannot,\" the girlrnsaid quickly. Her friend's newfound boldness surprised her sornmuch that she was unsure how to react to everything. \"Betrothedrndoes not mean that we have to get married tomorrow. It can be after Irnreturn from Spain. Will you at least think about it?\" pleadedrnthe boy, desperately grasping her arm. \"Froderick,rnlisten to yourself- what has gotten into you?\" He wasrnsilent for awhile, just gazing into her eyes, which he thought werernthe most beautiful shade of brown. The boy stared as if they wouldrnopen up right into her mind and give him the key information hernneeded to win her over. \"You know well. I love you,rnGwyn.\" Again she tried to pull away, but in the end she onlyrndiverted her gaze. Froderick continued uneasily, \"There isrnnothing in the way. We are both of the same status, your father wouldrnbe fine with it, we-\" \"Stop, please,\" therngirl interrupted as she looked back at him. A few tears were slowlyrncreating trails down her cheeks. \"Why don't yournfeel the same? What hinders you?\" questioned Froderick, hisrnvoice betraying his confusion. Gwyn wiped one tear streak from herrnface, then quickly passed a hand under her nose, sniffling. \"Irnjust do not believe we could work. I've grown up with you- Irnsee you as a brother.\" \"Then why do I see you asrnmore?\" questioned the boy. Gwyn wiped the other side of herrnface free of tears while giving a limp shrug. A sad expressionrnovercame Froderick's features. \"You wouldrnrather marry Philip, wouldn't you?\" \"No...rnI don't know... I can't!\" she replied, venting anrnexasperated sigh. \"I know I am not marrying the Prince,rnFroderick, believe me.\" Again she diverted her gaze. A longrnsilence followed, when all that could be heard was the wind faintlyrnrustling the leaves. \"I will never be good enough forrnyou, will I?\" the boy asked. Gwyn's head snapped backrnand she wore an apologetic expression. \"Oh, Froderick-rnyou're wonderful. Really, you are, and any woman would bernlucky to have you as a husband-\" \"But I don'trnwant any woman. I want you,\" he interrupted. Gwyn'srnexpression grew slightly pathetic and she took hold of his shirt. \"I don't know how to respond to that. We getrnalong perfectly... most of the time... and you'd think wernwould make a perfect match, but...\" \"Butrnwhat?\" The girl's mind raced. Why was she comingrnup with so many excuses? Stupid excuses, no less. Gwyn gave arndefeated sigh. \"But nothing. This is all just so unexpected.\"rnShe let Froderick kiss her forehead and wrap his good arm around herrnshoulders. \"You're right. It is extremelyrnlate... or more like extremely early... and we've both beenrnthrough much today. Maybe tomorrow will be better.\" They beganrnwalking back toward the houses. \"Don't ask merntomorrow,\" Gwyn suddenly spoke up, her whisper shattering therndelicate silence. The boy stopped walking immediately and stared atrnher, hurt. Before he could say anything, she added, \"Ask mernwhen you return from Spain. I'll have had plenty of time tornthink it over by then.\" \"You know that may takernyears. In that time, you-\" \"In that time, I willrnbe riding with my father. You have my promise that I will deny everyrnother possible marriage proposal until your return,\" she toldrnhim flatly, staring straight into his eyes. Froderick was satisfiedrnwith the answer and started walking again. \"You wouldrneven deny Prince Philip's proposal?\" Gwyn immediately,rnthough playfully, jabbed him in the ribs with her elbow. \"Stoprnit. He would not ask me to marry him.\" \"Hernwill.\" At Froderick's definitive statement, the girlrnkept silent until they reached his room. When he removed his arm,rnGwyn finally answered, \"Yes, I would even deny Prince Philip'srnproposal.\" The boy couldn't stop a wide grin fromrnspreading across his face. \"I shall look forward to myrnreturn all the more now,\" he said before kissing her hand. Gwyn looked at him differently now; he seemed to have reachedrna whole new level of maturity in the last few hours. Maybe the arrowrnhad poked some insight into him.

In her hands was a box…that was glowing. \"Well open it for goodness sakes!\" said Sharon impatiently. She leaned forward even more as Jenny started to open the mysterious box. Ryan and Sam crowded in closer as well. Jenny slowly opened the box with mixed feelings. She was really excited that she found the treasure this time, not Ryan who was usually the one who found all the interesting stuff. She was also nervous. What if its something bad…like a curse, or what if it was nothing but a piece of junk…then everyone will laugh at me. The box was now fully open and everyone peered in to see where the glowing was coming from. At the bottom of the box was a small ring with a weird symbol on it. Sharon leaned in to grab the ring. Jenny slapped her hand and gave her a glare. \"We cant touch it. We don't know what it can do? What if it's a portal the some other world? What if it contains poison?\" \" I don't care what it can do. Just let me see it. It's so pretty its…\" \"Look! What's that?\" Ryan said pointing to a scrap of paper that was hiding underneath the ring. \"Grab that paper. It might hold all the answers to our questions.\" Ryan reached into the box and cautiously pulled out the paper. He unfolded it and began to read; Dear treasure seekers, You have found something very special…but very powerful. In your hands is the ring of Araag, the king of the Island in the Sky. This ring is the portal to another world. Use it wisely and with care. Do not lose this ring of yours for if you do you will not be able to return. I give you one final clue, the ring will only glow so long and when its dark no more travel can be done.

I wonder how it takes us to another world.\" \"Be careful now. We don't want you flying away and leaving us all behind.\" Sam said moving closer to Ryan. All four kids moved in closer together. \"Let's all hold hands so when Ryan grabs the ring we'll all be connected.\" They each grabbed each other's hands. Slowly Ryan reached into the box and pulled out the ring. Ryan slipped the ring over his finger. Lights began to flash and swirl around the four kids huddled together.

The faces and eyes of the figures moved and cried in the silence as the flames danced with the shadows that moved and swayed like human hands. The doors to the chapel groaned, and a small ray of light only cast by the moon lingered onto the cold stone before the doors cried their testimony and clicked shut. Two dark silhouetted figures hovered by a lantern, seeking its light to remove the grim tales that were told on the walls surrounding them. As the wanderer approached the heavy air tightened with the tension of silence. In hushed tones the monk and abbot attempted to disband their personal silence and remove the presence of their guest with mere thought. However, the silence grew thick when the end of the discussion neared. The intruder studied the walls that disobeyed the eyes with shifting light, watching the lips of Mary move as she cried and her eyes flicker in mournful sorrow. At last, the large round eyes of the abbot flicker to the stranger, and a swift comment is made to the lesser. As the darkness crept upon the monk the moment he left the serenity f the lantern, his pace became erratic and hurried, rushing to be free of the shadowed and watching paintings that glared down at him. \"What do you seek, my son?\" the abbot asked, his voice betraying the grievances he held for the uninvited. The hooded and cloaked man turned from the enrapturing images, and lifted his face to look at the tight-fisted abbott. The piercing blue eyes locked onto the portly abbot, and froze his soul. In those eyes, there was the history of the world staring at him, haunting him. Despite the glaring eyes of the Lord, the abbott was roused to cross himself in front of what must be a demon. What else could possess such eyes? \"I seek a way out, Father. A path different from the one I follow.\" His voice seemed to erupt from his chest, shaking the still air and chilling the soul of the abbot. His voice, as cold and rough as it was, hit the soul as though it brought forth all the shame of one's heart into remembrance. The abbot straightened, and he closed his heart to the pain the stranger's voice brought into mind. \"I know you. You who bring pain and fear into the world. You who have nothing and need the world to live. Your past is cold, even brutal, and full of treachery, yet you live. No one's your friend and everyone's your enemy. You know too much, even when you know nothing at all. You stole the precious valuable worth nothing, and they call for your death. No one wishes to see your face, so you hide it. There's nothing ahead and your world behind, what is it you search for? You are pointless, as is your life. Why do you still try to continue?\" The hooded figure seems to laugh as he answers his voice dark and dreary. The abbot froze at the sound, chilling and almost childish. Frightening in the dark, yet musical to the ears as the soul longed to hear more. His eyes matched the abbot's again, once more stilling the blood in his veins. \"I've made it this far. Death is just another lesson in the game.\" \"And what is this 'game' you speak of?\" \"Something you call life.\" ToD (me :) ) : Those who don't know, this is me (Ralise) who started this and is now revising and editing to make it better and finish it on a different account.

He had a calling that Gwyn was in danger, captured in the Tower of London. \"Will,\" he called, nervously. \"What is it, Robin?\" \"It's Gwyn, she's in trouble.\" \"How do you know?\" \"I just do. Run to the fort. You should see Nirvana, her horse.\" \"Yes, Robin. But are you sure?\" \"I'm sure.\" &*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*& Gwyn was shivering in the freezing dungeon. Her head was placed in a cubicle, and she was being laughed at by the sherrifs that stood throughout the Tower of London. The Sherrif of Nottingham grinned vily. \"Don't you realize that without your father, Robin of Locksley, you're nothing?\" Gwyn looked at him, narrowing her eyes. \"When my father comes, you'll all be hung.\" \"Out of all the necks in this tower, Miss Hood, the one you should be worrying about is your own.\" Gwyn looked town, bitter and frightened at the same time. &*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*& Robin and Will rushed toward the Tower of London. Will had been very confused as to how Robin knew so well where she was, but he dared not ask. \"Will, how much longer do we have?\" \"10 miles.\" \"Giddup,\" he instructed to Nirvana. \"Will, what is it?\" \"Our Gwyn. I never really had a chance to meet her since she was just a little thing, I can't bear the thought of never seeing her again.\" \"You'll see her again, it's only a matter of time.\" Will however, looked doubtful...\"You're a fantisist, aren't you?\" \"No, I'm an optimist. &*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&**&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*& Gwyn was thrown into the recreational room in a flash. Before her eyes stood the rack, the most cruel, fierce torture machine of that time. She tried to run back, but was once again stopped by guards. The Sherrif of Nottingtam grabbed a fierce hold on her wrists, and her thin body struggled to be let free. But she was finally thrown onto the table, and stretched out to a mark. \"Where is your father?\" \"I told you, I don't know!\" \"Maybe this'll recharge your memory.\" He stretched the rack furthur. Gwyn was screaming with pain, wanting to be let out of the device more than anything. \"Remember now?\" \"No! I told you I don't know, and I mean that I don't know!\" \"This could be a high-charging crime. Faliure to cooperate with a sherrif could result in the Gullotine. \"You can't do that!\" \"Oh, can't I?\" In an instant the rack was stretched out to the tightest mark. Gwyn could feel the pain and anger surge inside of her intensely. If the Sherrif of Nottingham were anyone else, she would've shot him through the heart with her bow and arrow. &*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&**&*& \"Ah, here we are,\" declared Robin Hood, leaping off Nirvana and petting her. In an instant Mr. Hood and Mr. Scarlet head up to the tip of tower, and shot down the guards with their arrows. They flung open the door, and Robin was speechless to what he was seeing. \"Gwyn!\" He exclaimed as he saw that Gwyn had been placed in a stock, preparing to have her head chopped off by the mechanical ax known as the Gullotine. Tears were streaming down her face, as she knew she couldn't do anything about it. She never had the chance to look him in the face, because she was facing the opposite direction. \"Father, I love you,\" she said, and she sang in a sweet yet powerful voice: Shed not one tear My dearest father I must die soon In one swift moment The blade will fall then My head will chop off Please turn away then Don't see it drop off 'Tis a far far better thing that I do now Then I've ever done before Have no illusion It's the solution 'Tis a far far better thing that I do now Then I've ever done before Robin shook his head. \"Don't think that, Gwyn. You'll be all right, in the end, good always prevails over evil.\" \"Not this time, Father, not this time.\" Gwyn suddenly had a thought. What about Froderick? She never had the chance to tell him that she had loved him. &*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*& Froderick stood out in front of the Tower of London. He found out through the Grapevine that Gwyn was there, and he was detirmined to rescue her. On his way in, he saw Robin Hood, Will Scarlet, the Sherrif of Nottingham, several guards, and saddest of all, Gwyn, being put under the Gullotine. Froderick's eyes grew wide. \"MISS GWYN!\" Gwyn's eyes were closed, she didn't want to see herself die. The blade was hanging by a rope. The Sherrif let go of the rope, and the blade came rushing down quick as lightning. Froderick lept in and pulled the rope up and let the ax hang in the air. Gwyn, expecting she would be in heaven now, opened her eyes. \"Froderick! You saved my life!\" \"I had to. I wasn't about to let my best friend get killed.\" Robin and Will rode off, not wanting to be killed. The Sherrif looked back at Gwyn and Froderick ferociously. Froderick freed Gwyn of the contraption, and they both grabbed their bows and arrows. \"Surrender now, or your life will be full of regrets,\" Gwyn said, scowling at the Sherrif of Nottingham. He nodded, showing his cowardly side. Gwyn and Froderick smiled at eachother. They knew he was a coward, all bark and no bite. They stole two horses and rode on back to the shire.

The mustiness of mould and damp earth, overlaying something more putrid, something more... dead, for lack of a better word. One was close. The question was, how close? A telling scuff behind her told her that the answer was too close. They had no grace, these things, no sense of fluid movement. They moved along at a pace that couldn't be described as anything more than a shuffle. Yet the bastards still somehow found ways to sneak up on you. In one flowing movement, Terri raised the baseball bat in her hands and pivoted on the spot, swinging with all her might as she turned. For one brief moment, she had a glimpse of lank hair and a greying, rotting face filled with stained yellow teeth converging on her before red exploded across her vision. It staggered slightly, but still kept coming. One hit was never enough, no matter how hard you swung. Terri repositioned her feet and struck out again. More blood and matter sprayed her front. It went down on the next hit, enough of the head having been destroyed. Three blows. She was getting better at this. It had started off much easier to kill the rest of these walkers than the first ones she'd had to stop. The images of those two had been etched in her mind for weeks, making all the others seem like nothing in comparison. Now, the images had faded. She'd been separate from everything for so long that she couldn't remember so well anymore. The faces of all the kills just blurred together now. In the end, none of them mattered. They all met the same fate at the end of a baseball bat. Terri shouldered the bat with one hand and used the other to wipe away the worst of the goo from her face, her chest, her hair... She needed to find a water source soon. Right now, she was a walking scent beacon. But she still had no idea where exactly she was. A few hours back, she'd had the horrible idea that she was actually going in circles. It would certainly explain why she hadn't come across a city or even a town for several days now. But with it still not becoming daylight for quite a while yet, she had no way of telling. No choice but to keep heading in the direction that she hoped was straight on. As soon as she felt the first signs of fatigue start to show, she knew she had to stop. It was like those big signs you'd see alongside the freeway. ' Tiredness can kill. Take a break. ' Travelling alone amongst a world of walkers required just as much alertness as driving. Even more so. One little slip due to slower reactions could very well cost Terri her life. She stopped walking as soon as she came to a small cluster of trees that she reckoned she could climb. She couldn't remember the last time she'd come across a town - trees were the only things stretching up from the landscape around here, not buildings. She'd left the highway quite a while ago. Terri awkwardly tucked the baseball bat into the tight waistband of her tartan jeans as securely as she could and began her climb. The trees weren't as easy to scale as she would have liked, but that was the idea behind her choice. If it was a difficult climb for her, then it would be even more difficult, and hopefully impossible, for something that didn't have the ability to think. Once she was up high enough to feel safe, she carefully manoeuvred herself so that she could remove the rucksack she'd been wearing and slip it over a branch higher up still. Secure, but out of her way. When Terri had been forced to flee her family home in Pittsburgh, she hadn't had the chance to grab anything besides her brother's old baseball bat. The clothes on her back, the junk in her pockets and the makeshift weapon were all she'd escaped with. The rucksack was something she'd acquired later on from another escapee like herself, though one who'd been wounded beyond help. To say he'd been bitten would have been an understatement. He'd been half eaten. Bleeding profusely from deep wounds at his collarbone, abdomen and both arms, Terri had found him crawling alongside an abandoned road. He couldn't have had more than hours left to live... or turn. When he'd seen her, he'd begged her to get him to a hospital, a doctor, any kind of help. Instead, Terri had killed him when his head had been turned to put him out of his misery, bludgeoning him to pulp like she'd already had to do more times than she would have liked. She didn't even know where she was; let alone the location of the nearest hospital. And with her dead cell phone, she had no way of contacting anybody. This had been the kindest outcome for the lone traveller. Plus the man's demise had benefitted Terri more than he'd ever know. She'd taken his rucksack for good measure and discovered that the man must have been some kind of backpacker. Though clearly not prepared for a world as far gone as this, he'd at least been prepared for a long stint as a nomad travelling through the countryside. Terri had lightened the load by casting aside anything she could spare. She kept nothing but the ample supply of water and dried food packets, a pocket knife, a burnt out flashlight and what she could condone carrying from the medical kit. She retained the painkillers, antibiotics and bandages and ditched the splints and ankle supports. If she was unlucky enough to injure herself so that she needed either, then she'd have no chance of survival anyway. The ability to move freely was her best advantage right now. She positioned herself with her back to the tree trunk and wedged her feet against a thicket of branches, securing herself until she was sure that she wouldn't fall. She laid the baseball bat across her lap, both hands resting on top of it, and closed her eyes. Maybe just once, she'd dream about how things were, how her life had been before this apocalypse of horror... Terri woke up a few hours later as abruptly as if somebody had just shouted in her ear. It was actually due to her sense of self-preservation. Clutching the baseball bat so that she wouldn't drop it, she turned carefully to look down. Three walkers were gathered around the base of the tree. Too stupid to understand how to climb, they clawed at the trunk in desperation of not knowing how to reach their food. Great. It wasn't the first time Terri had woken to a sight like this, but just once, she'd like to have a nicer wake-up call. She pulled the rucksack down from the branch above her and slung it over her shoulder before climbing a way further down, the baseball bat tucked safely under one arm. Once she was low enough to jump without hurting herself, she flung the rucksack away from the tree as hard as she could in an attempt to distract the walkers. It worked. They all turned to look as the rucksack made a loud flump as it hit the ground further away. With their attention elsewhere, Terri gripped the baseball bat in one hand and leapt down, landing straight on top of the biggest walker. The impact took them both to the ground. But of course, Terri had the advantage of quick thinking and was on her feet again in one movement, kicking the walker's head hard as she jumped off of him, in the hopes of him staying down just those few seconds more. Another was already advancing on her. She hit him around the side of the head with the baseball bat, knocking him away to give her a feet extra feet of space. She then turned towards a smaller, female one that had approached from behind, moving in between Terri and the tree. Terri swung the bat as hard as she could, crushing the walker's head between it and the tree. The impact caused its head to crack gruesomely along one side, making it look as easy as if she'd ripped open a seam in some old clothing. Terri twisted again to see that the other two were advancing from the other side. She pivoted and used all of her strength to kick the one closest in the abdomen, knocking him backwards into the second and giving her more space again. She then turned back to where the female had recovered, but still hadn't moved yet and swung again, slamming her head against the trunk once more. This time, blood splattered up against the tree and the walker went down for good. The other two were going to be harder. There wasn't enough room between them to take care of one without the other getting in the way or getting to her first. Terri tried a different tactic, shoving the baseball bat into her waistband again and scrambling back up into the tree. With the small time frame she had, she was only able to make it to the lowest branches, but that was all she needed. She hung onto one of the studier branches and swung her legs back and forth, attempting to kick the walkers in the head. One tried grasping at her leg with clammy, rotting fingers, so she kicked him hard in the face with the heel of her shoe. There was a satisfying crunch and a gush of cold blood as her foot connected, breaking the walker's nose. They didn't seem to be able to feel pain, but good hits at least made them stagger. She tried to do the same to the bigger walker, but it didn't seem to have the same effect. She kicked out at him several times, but on the third kick, the baseball bat dislodged and fell before she could even try to save it. Shit . Terri tightened her grip and swung herself back again. The first walker had closed the gap again and her feet connected with him a second time. This time, she tried using him as a ground to push herself forward with more force. As she swung, she stretched both her feet out, driving them into the face of the bigger walker. It still didn't do any damage, but it had at least knocked both of them further back, giving her breathing room again. She dropped down between them on all fours like a cat, hastily retrieving the bat in the same movement. Walkers didn't seem to have the brain functions to pick things up, but the last thing you wanted was for them to get between you and your weapon. That had been close. Maybe next time she wouldn't try and be quite so creative. She straightened up and lashed out with the baseball bat at the smaller walker. The other was definitely the bigger threat, but he'd be easier to take out if she didn't have to concentrate on keeping this one at bay too. Easiest first. She stood her ground between the two of them, stopping to turn around every now and then to clobber the bigger walker around the head to force him back, but still mostly focusing her energy on the first one. It keeled over with its skull shattered after four blows, blood soaking Terri's shoes where it fell. Her old Converse had served her well over the years, but they'd certainly seen better days. Of course, shoes were the last thing on her mind right now. She jumped over the newly fallen body and turned to face her final opponent. The last walker staggered towards her, stumbling as its feet caught on its fallen comrade. It didn't have the thought process to try and step over or around it. Just like Terri had hoped. As the walker swayed and bowed its head forward to her level, she raised the bat above her head with both arms and then brought it crashing down onto his skull with all her might. There was still some life force left in it - or whatever it was that reanimated these fallen corpses - but the power behind Terri's drive naturally brought the walker to its knees. Up close, she could see a little more of what his face must have looked like before he'd turned, the almost buzz cut hair before it had grown over with mould and dried blood. He'd probably been a bodyguard or some kind of security in his lifetime. In the end, it hadn't helped him. Terri sometimes saw walkers as who they had been if she got a good look at them. Having an idea of what they'd been like as a living, breathing human should probably have made it more difficult to kill them... But it didn't. Something about them trying to take a bite out of her didn't make her feel quite so remorseful. Taking the advantage of the walker being at her height, she swung again and again, not giving it time to even raise its head. It finally fell still with the sixth hit. The big ones were always harder to take down. Bloody brain matter oozed from the deep craters in its head. \"Whoever said that three against one was bad odds?\" Terri muttered to herself. She stepped back and wiped the baseball bat clean on a patch of grass that hadn't suffered the fate of any gross walker fluids. Three more down. Part of her kind of wished that she'd kept count of how many walkers she'd taken out. Another part of her didn't care to know. It was probably better for her sanity that way. It was already a struggle at times to hold onto it. The whole fight had only lasted several minutes, but it felt more like hours. Her nap felt almost pointless now. All the action had sapped a huge chunk of her energy and her arms and hands ached from swinging the bat around so much. But if there was one thing she was now, it was awake. And alert. She decided to keep moving. She didn't feel this area was so safe anymore. There were probably more walkers where these three had come from. If she tried taking a nap here, there was a chance that she'd wake up to the same thing all over. She really didn't need a vicious circle right now. She could rest up again later if she needed to. Preferably elsewhere. She also knew she was better to keep going whilst she could. Her food supply wasn't quite as ample anymore. Unless she found another city, then she probably only had enough for a few more weeks. She could ration, but not too much. If she didn't make sure she ate enough, then she wouldn't have enough energy to fight. And then she'd be dead anyway. Keep moving. That was the key. Whereas any town or city would do right now, the bigger goal was to get to Detroit. Her only family left were in Detroit. They were still alive - they had to be. Terri had been telling herself that over and over. Even though she kept suffering the same horrible fear that she was the only one left at all. That she was completely alone in this horrible, dying new world. Yet, as she kept walking, she soon heard a sound that finally gave her the glimmer of hope she'd been sorely needing. It was the sound of a car engine in the distance. No... It sounded like something bigger than a car. Maybe a truck. She couldn't tell how far it was, but from the slowly quietening sound, she knew it was moving further away. She wasn't stupid enough to try chasing it on foot. But it didn't matter. It had given her what she needed - the first confirmation of other life in over a week. Feeling considerably more upbeat, Terri continued in the direction that she'd heard the engine, in hopes of it leading her towards a town or city. She still had a few hours of darkness left, so maybe if she was close to somewhere, she'd actually be able to see city lights. Keeping the thought at the front of her mind as motivation, she plodded on. She hadn't come across anymore walkers since her rather rude wake-up call and for that she was grateful. Now that she felt she might actually be close to something, she didn't want to stop. She didn't want anything to get in her way. She just wanted to keep going. But of course, it was never that easy. After a little while, she started to hear more noises around her. But these weren't the sounds of a nearby city; they were the familiar sounds of walkers. She was sure of it. She'd followed a dirt track for a while, but now she was moving amongst trees and bushes again. Plenty of cover to keep walkers hidden from her view. Terri chose the most open trail she could see and kept moving, the baseball bat held tightly in both hands, slowing her pace only slightly as she slipped into full alert mode. She rounded a thicket of bushes and found a lone walker with his back to her, staggering along in a drunken zigzag. She could probably have gotten past without it even noticing her, but she was more concerned that just leaving a walker to its own devices without killing it would come back to bite her on the ass later. Maybe even literally. She crept up behind the walker, taking care to step as quietly as possible, and took a sudden swing at it. The awkwardly aimed blow broke the walker's neck, leaving its head drooping at an odd angle. A broken neck didn't stop it from being hungry though. It turned to face Terri, groaning between cracked lips and mismatched teeth. She wasted no time in hitting it twice more, obliterating the head in seconds. She'd tried to bring as little attention to herself as she could, but apparently, that was impossible. She could hear more footsteps against the grass, so she quickly took cover by edging back round the cluster of bushes, trying to gage where the sounds were coming from. She suddenly heard an audible click directly behind her. Without hesitating, she spun on her heel, putting all of the momentum from the twist into the swing of the bat. There was a clatter as the bat met a pair of hands, the impact knocking a gun out of their grip and sending it disappearing into the bushes. Wait... A gun ? Walkers definitely didn't carry guns. Terri lowered the bat just an inch and looked up into eyes that were just as surprised as her own. Eyes that were very much alive. This wasn't a walker at all. This man wasn't dead and rotting. He was living and breathing and completely human . Without quite knowing what else to say, she blurted out, \"You're alive.\" \"No shit,\" he replied through clenched teeth, clutching his hand. \"Sorry,\" Terri apologised guiltily, having gotten too used to walkers not being able to feel pain. \"I thought you were one of them.\" He ignored her. \"I think you broke one of my fingers.\" \"Sorry, but you snuck up behind me,\" Terri protested. \"What did you expect me to do?\" \"Yeah, well, I thought you were one of them too,\" he replied, flexing his fingers. One of them now sat an awkward angle. \"It's not my shooting hand at least; be grateful for that. What are you doing out here? You get lost or something?\" \"I came from Pittsburgh,\" Terri explained. \"I'm just looking for a city right now, but I don't know where I am.\" \"Err, lady, you're about a mile outside of Pittsburgh.\" \"What?\" Terri exclaimed. \"But that can't be possible; I left Pittsburgh about two weeks ago!\" \"Then you need a better map. Trust me, I just got the fuck out of Pittsburgh. It's right over that way.\" Terri stared in the direction he was pointing. She couldn't believe it. She knew that she'd gotten a little turned around after she'd managed to find Cleveland and she knew she'd felt like she'd been going in circles for the last day or so, but she'd had no idea she'd been heading back towards the place she'd been trying to get away from in the first place. What absolutely shitty luck. \"Well, that's just fucking perfect!\" she suddenly shouted in frustration, swinging the baseball bat at the thicket of bushes and sending leaves and twigs cascading everywhere. \"Two weeks and I'm right back to where I goddamn started!\" \"Hey, just shut up a second!\" the guy hissed at her. Terri lowered the bat and turned to glare at him. Who was he to tell her to shut up? But then she realised that he was listening for something. \"What is it?\" she whispered. \"Stenches.\" \"Stenches?\" Terri repeated. She'd not heard that one before, but she guessed the name was appropriate at least. The guy ignored her again. \"I need my gun. Did you see where it went?\" \"Err...\" Terri hesitated and pointed sheepishly towards the bushes. \"I think it went in there somewhere?\" The guy glared at her furiously. \"Are you fucking kidding me?\" \"I'm sorry, alright? I already told you it was because you snuck up on me!\" Terri argued, forgetting to keep her voice down. She knew straightaway that she'd made the wrong move. A walker - or stench, she guessed - suddenly staggered up behind the guy, practically appearing from nowhere out of the bushes. She didn't waste any time in thinking. \" Duck !\" Luckily, the guy had quick enough reflexes and instantly dropped to the floor. Terri swung the bat hard across the space where his head had been only moments before. Her swing hit the stench instead, knocking it backwards a few steps. She quickly sidestepped around the guy on the floor and bludgeoned the stench twice more. It keeled over at her feet, soaking her already gross Converse even more. Moaning sounds behind her told her that more walkers had approached behind her. She turned to find that the guy was trying to fight them off just with kicks and punches. It was brave, but foolish. Fists weren't hard enough to do any real damage to them. Any kind of blow would hold them back to some degree, but fighting at close quarters would only make it more likely for you to get bitten. \"Watch out!\" Terri shouted. The guy ducked out of the way and she struck out at one of the stenches he'd been grappling with. She then quickly pivoted to hit the other one. Another two had already approached the scene. With Terri being the only one armed, they were outnumbered. She'd just have to focus on driving them all back to keep them both from becoming breakfast. It was difficult with somebody else being in the way, but she managed to create a wider circle of space to move in. Hopefully, that'd give her the room to make some cleaner shots and start picking the stenches off one by one. At least the guy was smart enough to listen whenever she told him to get out of the way. She succeeded in taking one down without any mishaps, but as she drew the bat back to start on the next one in line, another stench moved up behind her with speed she'd never seen from any of them before. As it grabbed for her, she lost her grip slightly on the baseball bat and the stench knocked it out of her hands. Oh, shit... She didn't have the time or room to pick it up again. She'd fallen prey to the critical rule of never letting a walker get in between you and your weapon. Just as Terri was sure that they were done for, the guy barrelled in and struck the stench in the side of the head with a well aimed punch. He hit it so hard that the stench staggered several feet. There was an audible crunch, which Terri had a horrible feeling was another of the guy's fingers, rather than damage to the walker. She didn't have any time to waste on remorse. She dove for the baseball bat, using it to sweep the walker's feet out from underneath it by striking it on the back of the knee joints. As it went down, she alternated between using the bat and her foot to smash its head into the ground. With only two walkers left, the odds were much more evenly stacked. One was a badly decaying female who had clearly been dead and walking for far too long. The other was a boy who couldn't have been any older than seventeen before he'd turned. They were both small of build and were both much easier to fell than the others. By the time the massacre was over ,Terri found herself breathing much more heavily than usual. She hadn't taken on that many at once before. The energy from her earlier nap was definitely gone now. She looked over to the guy to see that he was cradling his hand again. It looked like she'd been right about the crunching sound she'd heard. \"You didn't break anything else, did you?\" she asked in concern. The guy shook his head. \"Nah. Same finger. If it wasn't broken before, then it is now.\" Terri opened her mouth to apologise, then realised there was something more important for her to say. \"Thanks.\" \"Find my gun for me and maybe we'll call it even.\" Terri had a feeling that he hadn't particularly enjoyed taking the minor part in the fight. Though she didn't really fancy crawling around through the bushes in the dark, she couldn't really argue with him after he'd saved her. She nodded and handed him the baseball bat. \"You keep watch then. Do I get a name before I go crawling around on the ground for you?\" \"Cholo.\" \"I'm Terri. But just for saving my ass, you can call me T.J.,\" she said lightly, using the nickname she'd always preferred anyway. She then got down onto her hands and knees and disappeared into the bushes. The branches were thick and made it incredibly dark, but by feeling around extremely carefully, she managed to find the cool smoothness of the gun. As she picked it up, she heard shuffling sounds ahead on the other side of the bushes. Footsteps. Not more walkers... She quickly scrambled forwards towards the sounds in case Cholo hadn't heard them, the brambles catching her hair and digging into her scalp in her haste. She tore herself free and crawled out of the bushes to find herself looking straight up into the barrel of another gun. She instantly dropped the one she was carrying and raised her hands in front of her face, partly in surrender and partly out of instinctive protection. \"Wait, don't shoot!\" she exclaimed hurriedly. It felt like déjà vu as she saw surprise register in the man's face. Then Cholo came running round, having heard the commotion. \"Wait, Fox, it's okay!\" \"Shit. Sorry, I thought you were one of them,\" the guy apologised, lowering his gun. \"No worries; I thought the same,\" Terri dismissed. At least she hadn't caused an injury this time. She scrambled to her feet and passed the gun to Cholo. It didn't look like a normal gun; it weirdly looked more like a hot glue gun. She wondered what was inside it. \"So what are you doing out here?\" asked the guy who Cholo had called Fox. \"I got a bit lost,\" Terri admitted. \"A bit? Apparently she's been wandering around outside of Pittsburgh for two weeks,\" Cholo laughed. Terri chose to ignore him. \"So where are you guys headed now? Back into Pittsburgh?\" \"Nah. Me and Foxy here took Dead Reckoning when the big man wouldn't pay up for my services,\" explained Cholo. \"Came out here to try and blow up the Green, but stenches did it for us.\" \"Wait, wait...\" Terri backtracked, trying to process everything she'd just heard. \"You tried to blow up Fiddler's Green?\" Cholo shrugged. \"Didn't need to in the end. Last we saw, it looked like the place was going to hell anyway. Maybe I'm glad they wouldn't let me in. Otherwise I'd have ended up just like the rest of 'em.\" \"You wanted in?\" Terri asked, surprised. He didn't really seem like the kind of guy to mix with most of the stuffy types who lived in Fiddler's Green. Well, had lived. \"Yeah, why, what's it to you?\" \"No reason,\" said Terri quickly, though her mind was suddenly racing with ideas as she tried to pull a plan together. \"So what happened to Dead Reckoning? You wouldn't be wandering around out here if you still had it.\" Dead Reckoning was a heavily armoured truck that groups would occasionally take out, under permission from the higher-ups, as a protective mode of travelling when going into neighbouring towns to collect supplies. \"Ah, it got hijacked,\" said Cholo offhandedly. \"Some self-righteous assholes thought they could put it to better use.\" \"Apparently, they left us a T-Bird and some weapons back down that way though, so that's where we're heading now,\" added Foxy, pointing in a direction to the right of where Terri had first come from. Terri took it all in interestedly. \"Where are you gonna head now then?\" \"Gonna try our luck with an outpost in Cleveland,\" said Cholo, inspecting the barrel of his gun before sticking it into an impressive looking holster that was strapped to his leg. \"And no; we don't take passengers.\" \"There's nothing in Cleveland,\" Terri pointed out. \"I've been there - I found the outpost. It's completely dead.\" \"Wait, you were in Cleveland?\" Foxy repeated. Terri nodded. \"Before I got turned around. That's where I've just come from.\" \"Shit,\" Cholo swore. \"Well, now what?\" asked Foxy. \"I guess we could go back the other way and try for New Jersey...\" Terri hastily put two and two together in her head, based on what she'd heard. From the sounds of it, the two guys - Cholo especially - were mostly interested in money. She was guessing that the 'big man' Cholo had referred to was Paul Kaufman, the man who'd taken charge of Fiddler's Green. She didn't know what kind of 'services' Kaufman would have been paying him for - probably something illegal - but when Cholo hadn't received that payment, he'd been willing to blow up the Green for it. Yeah, it definitely sounded like money was important to him. Money she could do. She'd learnt several times over already that it wasn't going to be easy to get to Detroit on her own. And that wasn't even including her clearly poor sense of direction. But right now, she'd been given the perfect opportunity to rustle up a couple of... tour guides, to put it one way. \"How about past Cleveland instead?\" she piped up. \"If you guys take me where I need to go, I'll pay you for it.\" Cholo pointedly looked her up and down. \"With what money?\" Terri conceded that she didn't exactly look the picture of wealth right now with her torn and blood-soaked clothes. She pulled a rather battered but still working credit card out of the pocket of her jeans. \"As long as I can find a working ATM machine, then I still have access to all my funds. I'll pay you whatever Kaufman was supposed to pay you. I'm guessing he's the guy you were out to get revenge on, right?\" Cholo raised his eyebrows. \"Kaufman owed me over a hundred and eighty grand. You really think you can offer that kind of money?\" Terri fixed him with a steady gaze. So it had been something illegal then, to have amounted to that much. That was pretty much what she'd expected. It sounded like Cholo was the kind of guy most people would stay away from. Now Terri knew she had to hire him. Nice guys finish last , as she'd always been taught. She couldn't afford to finish last now. Someone who wasn't so nice was exactly what she needed to get her through an apocalyptic world of walkers. \"I lived in the Green. I can pay you whatever you want,\" she said confidently. \"What makes you so high-rise to be accepted into the Green?\" \"You heard of Malcolm Russo?\" Terri prompted. \"Yeah. He's the guy who was running for Mayor before everything changed,\" Foxy replied. \"Well, he's... was... my dad,\" explained Terry, having to correct herself mid-sentence. It sounded weird to her - it still hadn't quite sunk in yet. She hastily brushed away the feelings it threatened to trigger and pressed her point. \"So are you in or what?\" \"How far past Cleveland are we talking?\" Cholo questioned. \"...Detroit?\" said Terri hesitantly, knowing it was still somewhat of a long shot. Foxy snorted. \"No way. Even with a full tank of gas, a T-Bird wouldn't get you that far, not when you have to loop around Lake Erie. We don't know what's out that way. How do you know it's not so overrun with stenches that you can't get through on foot?\" \"It's a chance I'm willing to take,\" Terri persisted stubbornly. \"Besides, if we can find a boat to hijack, we can cut across Lake Erie and save on a huge chunk of time.\" \"No way, man.\" Foxy shook his head. \"Cleveland was one thing, but Detroit's just crazy.\" He looked towards Cholo, who didn't say anything. \"Bro, you're not actually considering it, are you?\" \"I dunno, man. It's not like I'm just going to come into money by going anywhere else,\" he replied, looking thoughtful. He turned his attention towards Terri. \"Two hundred grand. And the money for a lease on a nice apartment somewhere, away from all the stenches and shit.\" \"If you can actually find a place like that, then you've got it,\" Terri agreed happily, holding out her hand. Cholo eyed her warily before shaking her hand. \"Fox. You really not coming?\" \"I think trying to get to Detroit's insane,\" said Foxy. \"I'm out, bro.\" \"Foxy, you've been with me a long time, baby. I'm not gonna make you come with me,\" said Cholo. \"Take the T-Bird and go find Riley. You'll be able to catch up to Dead Reckoning with a set of wheels.\" Foxy clapped him gratefully on the shoulder. \"No way will you get to Detroit on foot the whole way. Let me at least take you back into the city. If you can get past the stenches and grab your ride, then that'll give you a head start.\" Cholo returned the gesture. \"It's a plan, baby.\" Terri raised her eyebrows. \"So what ride are you promising, seeing as you're giving away the wheels you already have?\" \"How about a motorcycle?\" Terri suddenly grinned. \"In that case, you're forgiven.\" Finally, things were starting to look up. Maybe now she'd have a real chance of getting to Detroit after all. Breaking a finger, killing some walkers and bartering a few chips was all it had taken. Whoever said that playing nice would get you anywhere? XXX Author's Note! Yup, another new story. What excuse do you want me to give this time? xD Because on this one I actually have quite a few! Firstly, zombie movies. I friggin' LOVE zombie movies. George A. Romero is clearly the daddy of zombie movies and I totally loved his comeback with Land of the Dead when I was a teenager. I was in the mood for some zombie stuff a few weeks ago and of course that was what I chose to put on, it being probably my favourite zombie movie - though kind of on par with Shaun of the Dead. Aaand I got totally hooked again. As with everything I seem to watch/read/play nowadays my mind just started exploding with ideas and alternate plot lines. Soooo I bring you this! This is set after Cholo got shot (though I haven't mentioned that yet) and just before he gets bitten. So you could say that Terri's appearance saved him ;D And my god, I'd discovered my absolute love in writing... Writing zombie smashing scenes is the most fun thing EVER. You have no idea how much I friggin' enjoyed writing this! Also another thing about Land of the Dead: John Leguizamo. Enough said. Or is that just me? Oh and there's even an Easter Egg this time! Spot the Bonnie Tyler reference I just couldn't resist using and you're officially awesome |D ","Summary":" The smell hit her before anything else.

He could feel the swift and incessant pangs of hunger in his body, and all he could think about was sinking his teeth into thick, juicy flesh. Or even freshly plucked intestine would do. He wasn't picky. In reality Big Daddy didn't know why he felt so hungry all the time, or why he chased certain creatures and not others. He knew there were scores of tasty food - walking food bags, he liked to think of them - just waiting for him and his \"friends\", but he didn't know where they were, exactly. Speaking of those walking food bags... Big Daddy shambled off the porch where he was standing and watched as the food bags hooted and shouted loudly, as they rode those rather mysterious lumps of metal that emitted smoke, noise, and lights. Above him, sparkles of bright light sliced through the night sky, but unlike the others, Big Daddy wasn't affected. As the food bags jabbed those sticks of death at his comrades, Big Daddy howled with rage. His eyes flashed and he longed to hold one of those food bags in his grasp and squeeze them until their blood flowed through his fingers. Big Daddy growled and tried to shake at least one of his \"friends\" awake, to snap them out of the trance those lights had on them. No luck. He seized the nearest \"friend\" by the hair and a split second later, a staccato of bangs issued from the food bags - damn them all to hell - and he was left holding the severed head of his \"friend\". Another cry of agony slipped from his lips, and he vowed to hunt the food bags to the ends of the earth. Big Daddy dropped the severed head and stomped on it, slightly relishing the thick crunch of bone and the squelch of blood as it oozed onto the pavement. He looked at all the \"friends\" who surrounded him, and together they made a silent promise: to find and exterminate all food bags in retribution for the destruction of their kind. The age of humans will end. The age of zombies will begin. ","Summary":" Big Daddy was hungry, so very very hungry.

I would like to note that this story completely ignores Survival of the Dead, and instead follows Night of the Living Dead in which zombies are briefly shown eating creatures other than humans. I subscribe to the theory that zombies are perfectly willing to chow down on any living or recently-killed animal, but find humans to be the easiest prey to catch. For those who were not required to slog through classic American literature in school, the title is play on the Faulkner novel As I Lay Dying, from which I have shamelessly stolen the basic premise, although I will not attempt to replicate the writing style. Riley Denbo entered through the door of the small, ancient farm house on the outskirts of Rivière-du-Loup that he'd taken as his own. After knocking the snow from his boots, he placed them in front of the fireplace to dry out. The coals from that morning's fire still gave off enough heat to keep the room, if not comfortable, than at least somewhere above bone-chillingly cold. It was the work of a few minutes to get the flames going properly again, and soon Riley was able to shrug out of his heavy overcoat and hang it up. Wearily, he sank into his armchair, propping his feet up on the hearth and waiting for the feeling to return to his toes. He reached for the bottle of applejack, pulling the cork and pouring a few ounces into a waiting glass. He took a generous swallow, feeling the liquor warm his insides as the fire worked from the outside, and silently toasted the local bootleggers who had hung on to the old technique of freeze distillation. Riley never used to drink, but he had found that a couple of glasses could sooth the aches and ward off the chill without being enough to cloud his mind. Making booze wasn't the only pre-mass production craft that had been revived along with the dead. Other than his guns and some of the cookware and spices in his kitchen, nothing in Riley's home had originated more than ten miles from where he sat. His clothing was homespun wool and sheepskin leather with bone buttons. His furniture was locally made and cunningly held together with wooden pegs, no nails or screws required. More wool stuffed his mattress and his chair cushion. Even the bottle and glass were hand-blown in a shop in town. The people were so self-sufficient that Riley had found himself with little that he could contribute. Three or four times a year at most, he took Dead Reckoning into Quebec City or Montreal in search of things like tools and medicines that couldn't be produced locally. His technical skills were even less in demand, he knew less about spinning wheels and horse collars than he did about brain surgery, and there were plenty of shade tree mechanics perfectly capable of keeping the community's few remaining vehicles running. And after the events of his last day in Pittsburgh, he'd lost what little interest he had in killing stenches. He didn't mind. Not being needed or having anyone relying on him made for a pleasant change. Even Charlie had adapted to the simpler way of life, no longer needing Riley to take care of him, but their friendship was as strong as ever. Riley still needed to do something to contribute to the community, and the only thing left open was manual labor. The day had been spent helping haul hay out to the pastures, where the snow had buried any grass the sheep might have grazed upon. The sheep were the reason for the town's survival, providing not just food and clothing but also a barrier to the undead. Any walkers that wandered into the region got distracted by all of that meat on the hoof instead of continuing into town and attacking people. Patrols would find them chasing sheep, or busy eating on the rare occasions when they caught one, and pick the stenches off from a safe distance. Herds of sheep were pastured in an arc around the town, with the St. Lawrence River on each end. And because sheep can be taught to stay within their pasture without wandering off, Rivière-du-Loup was truly a \"world without fences\" and Riley was content to help keep it that way. A second glass of the potent apple liquor had banished enough of the soreness from Riley's muscles that he was ready to contemplate making dinner. He was in the kitchen, trying to come up with a 127th different way to cook mutton, when Slack burst in through the door. \"Riley! You need to come into town, Charlie is sick.\" \"How is he?\" \"It doesn't look good, the doctor is with him now.\" Riley quickly got into his coat and boots and followed Slack outside to the truck she and Charlie used for patrols. They rode in silence into town, passing through the open gate in the wall protecting the central core. The wall was a legacy of earlier times, it hadn't been needed in years. It was still maintained, more as a fallback position in case of a raid by marauders that were still rumored to wander the countryside than to keep out stenches. The gates were never closed, except for the periodic check to make sure they still moved freely. Riley stepped out of the truck before it had completely stopped in front of the hospital. He hurried inside with Slack rushing to catch up. He started to head for the patient wards, but Slack grabbed his arm and turned him towards the psych wing. That was a bad sign. No longer used for mental patients, the new purpose of the locked rooms was to treat people who were likely to die. Anyone who died and came back were contained until they could be properly disposed of. He moved down the corridor with quick strides to where Dr. O'Doull was waiting for him. \"How bad is he?\" \"It's pneumonia. I told him to stay home, keep warm, and rest, but he insisted on going out. He collapsed a few hours ago and was brought here.\" \"Is there anything you can do?\" \"I'm doing everything I can. I've got him on oxygen and antibiotics, but I suspect the fire that burned his face also damaged his lungs. It apparently wasn't enough to incapacitate him but I doubt he did much jogging.\" Riley thought back. \"I don't think I've ever seen him move faster than a brisk walk.\" \"Right. With the pneumonia on top of any earlier lung injury, he's not getting enough oxygen. I need to put him on a respirator, so I'm going to start up the generator and intubate him. You can visit with him until I get back, but wear a mask. We don't need an epidemic.\" The doctor left, and Riley took a surgical mask from a box by the door and tied it on over his mouth and nose. He entered the room, letting the door swing shut behind him and hearing the lock engage. Charlie lay on the bed, not strapped down although the bed was equipped with restraints. Charlie looked up as Riley entered. \"Riley. You plannin' on robbing a train or something?\" \"Just didn't want you to smell the alcohol on my breath and think I was developing bad habits.\" Charlie looked around. \"Figures I'd end up here. Just look at this face, you can tell I belong in the loony bin.\" Riley sat on the edge of the bed and clasped Charlie's hand. \"If there is anything I can do for you, just let me know.\" \"Take me home. This is a great place, and I'm glad you brought me here, but I want to see home one more time.\" \"It's a promise.\" At that point Dr. O'Doull returned wheeling a piece of arcane medical equipment. \"Okay, Charlie, I need to sedate you for this.\" \"Is that really necessary, doc?\" \"I was on a respirator once,\" the doctor said. \"Trust me, you don't want to be awake for this.\" \"If you say so doc.\" He turned his head to look at Riley. \"Guess it's time to say goodnight.\" \"I'll see you when you wake up.\" Riley waited patiently while the doctor went about his work. In less than half an hour, Charlie was asleep and had a tube down his throat helping him to breathe. \"What are his chances?\" The doctor looked uncomfortable, but answered, \"Fifty-fifty that he makes it through the night. If he doesn't show improvement by then I doubt he'll last the week.\" \"Are you sure the antibiotics are still good? Are they the right kind? I could go looking for more.\" \"I have the right kind, I ran a culture to make sure. And that last batch of cipro you brought in was still effective a month ago. There's nothing left to do but continue the treatment and pray.\" Riley left before he said something that might offend the doctor's Roman Catholic beliefs. He mentally cataloged resources and sketched out a construction plan as Slack drove him back to his home. She accompanied him inside and busied herself in the kitchen while he sat staring into the fire. She served him a plate of stew which he ate mechanically, knowing that he should thank her but not being able to bring himself to speak. Luckily she knew him well enough not to take offense. As she cleaned up after the meal, he sat staring at the nearly full bottle in front of him, more tempted to drink until all the pain went away than he had been in years. He was about to give in when Slack abruptly plopped down on his lap and proved she knew a more pleasant and less toxic way to distract him from his troubled thoughts. The next morning saw Riley hard at work inside Dead Reckoning. The useless fireworks launcher had been removed shortly after they had arrived to make room for more cargo, since Rivière-du-Loup lacked the fleet of vehicles that had normally gone on scavenging runs back in Pittsburgh. Riley was reinstalling the launcher's housing, having traded the working parts for some needed materials and the use of a MIG welder. The haggling had been long and frustrating, made worse by Riley having to rely on dimly-remembered high school French. The doctor, himself a recent immigrant from the US although not so recent as Riley and his crew, was the only one in town who admitted to speaking English. And living alone out in the country had denied Riley the full immersion in the local tongue that the others had gotten. Even Charlie was more fluent in the Quebecois dialect. He was finished by mid-afternoon, and stepped outside to find Pillsbury and Pretty Boy waiting for him. \"What are you up to in there?\" Pretty Boy asked. \"I promised Charlie that I'd take him home.\" \"Even if the doctor releases him, he probably won't live that long.\" \"I promised,\" Riley repeated. \"If I can't take him back alive, I'll take him dead.\" \"So that's what you've been doing,\" Pillsbury said, \"Building a cage.\" \"If you want to call it that.\" \"Then we're doing with you,\" Pretty Boy said. \"I don't think that's a good idea.\" \"Hey, the baby is weaned, I can fit back into my armor again,\" Pretty Boy patted her stomach, \"And Mrs. Galtier will take care of little Cholo until we get back.\" Riley looked at Pillsbury. \"Are you going to allow that?\" \"Nothing I can do to stop her. Never should have married her, but there are no proper Samoan women around. Or even any improper ones.\" Pretty Boy punched him in the shoulder, almost hard enough for him to feel it. \"Watch it buddy, I could trade you in for three men closer to my size and get change back.\" It turned out Slack had been loitering around the corner. \"I'm going too. I'd like to see what's happened since we left. I wonder if Cholo made it?\" Riley looked around, wondering if anyone else planned to join the party. \"If you're looking for Anchor, forget it. His little French wife put her foot down, much to his relief I'm sure.\" They spent the rest of the afternoon loading supplies and checking systems, making sure everything was ready to go. Riley sat at Charlie's bedside late into the night, carrying on a long, rambling, one-sided conversation before falling asleep in the chair. He stayed for the next two days, not leaving Charlie alone for more than a few minutes at a time. Late in the third night, he was shaken awake by Dr. O'Doull. \"His blood oxygen level is dropping fast. It's time.\" He and the doctor had prepared for this, and they put the plan into action. They slid a back board under Charlie's unresisting body and strapped him tightly to it, leaving only the chest restraint loose so as not to impede his breathing. They had barely finished when Charlie died. The doctor set about unhooking him from all of the medical devices, leaving only the breathing tube. \"Please, doctor, remove that too.\" \"With it in place he won't be able to bite.\" \"I'll take that chance.\" He removed the tube, and Slack, Pillsbury, and Pretty Boy arrived soon after, having been informed by the doctor's assistant. The four of them carried Charlie out to where Dead Reckoning was parked in front of the hospital. He reanimated on the way, but the straps held him securely. They took him inside, where the small enclosure waited. They set the board on end in the doorway to the cell and released the restraints, quickly pulling the back board away and shutting the door before Charlie could turn around. Riley had cut a hole through the sheet metal facing the front of the truck, and covered it with expanded metal mesh. Charlie stood at the opening, his lifeless eye looking out. Riley stood there returning his gaze as Pretty Boy started the engine and drove south out of town.

A/N: Written for Ruuger for M/M Rares. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to finally write this pairing; I so adore them. There were bruises covering Riley's torso as they rode Dead Reckoning off into the night. Charlie had noticed Riley's small wince, thank you very much, as Riley boarded both their ride and their home. Charlie was relieved that Riley wasn't more badly hurt and also that they were both finally going to Canada, but more so the former, since there would be no point in going north if Riley wasn't going with him. Instead of shooting Riley a look that Charlie knew wouldn't come across as he would have intended, even if Riley would know what he meant, he stuck close to his friend so Riley would know that hiding anything from Charlie was an impossibility. Charlie would have said 'not yet' to Pillsbury's 'we can go now' if he knew Riley would not have blushed under the attention. Riley would just have to deal with him later. Sooner rather than later. When the two of them were away from prying eyes, Riley sat down on his small bunk and kept his hands out of the way as Charlie knelt down in front of him. There was something too familiar about Charlie lifting up Riley's shirt so he could inspect his chest and admire his shoulders, all while he checked for broken bones and the extent of the bruising. It was a source of nothing but stress for Charlie as he could only watch and have Riley's back as his friend was thrown into one situation after another. He couldn't tell Riley to stop everything and move away from all this, even though Riley had reached that conclusion himself before Cholo messed everything up. He also couldn't tell Riley to stop fidgeting as Charlie tested him for everything from a sprained ankle to a concussion. It hadn't taken long for Riley to realize that this was something that had to be done to put Charlie's mind at ease, so sit back, relax and endure Charlie's thoughtful, careful ministrations was what he did. It also gave them an excuse for intimacy and comfort. If Riley was bold enough to shoo the others away, needing a moment to himself, he never told or - Charlie supposed - expected Charlie to do the same. Being with Charlie was like being alone, Riley always said to everyone who asked about their inseparability, including Charlie. Even though Charlie had never had a family, he wondered whether that's what family was: someone you could be alone with. Either way, Charlie wasn't about to question Riley's perfectly fine behavior that everyone labeled as completely not normal behavior. If he started questioning it then it might go away, and Charlie didn't want the time he got to spend with Riley and away from everyone else to go away. If Charlie was lucky, and he usually was, Riley would remove his shirt and lie down flat on his back on the bed when Charlie was finished. Charlie would take that as his cue to remove his jacket and lie down next to him, staring up at nothing and waiting for Riley to do something else, not that he expected him to. This was what Charlie wanted: more days to just lie there on that bed next to Riley, not thinking about anything in particular, danger getting farther and farther away from them. Eventually, Charlie would work to make up for the silence and start talking or ask a question here or there that came to mind. Riley would either answer or say nothing, which was all the same to Charlie. Riley's lack of words never disappointed him or made him feel like he was ignored. There was something in him that told Charlie that Riley was always listening. Charlie didn't need an answer, he just needed Riley. Someone he could protect. Someone who would blanket him from the rest of the world without question. Sometimes, like tonight, Riley would turn over on his side and face Charlie. He would recognize this as one in a string of nights that he both hated and loved, hated because of the pain and guilt between them, and loved because he would feel anything with Riley, as long as he shared whatever it was with Riley . A hand would land on Charlie's cheek, thumb brushing against the extensive scar tissue. Riley's eyes would reveal nothing at first, but Charlie could recognize the half-hidden love when it came from Riley. He recognized it because it was the same in him. The first time Riley had done this: touched him, stared so openly at him, Charlie had looked down and then away. He hadn't been able to understand why Riley would want to touch him, knowing that his skin wasn't soft or smooth and that there was nothing appealing about him that he could see, knowing that the very sight of him usually caused people to point a gun at him or gag when realizing his similarity with the stenches. Riley never looked disgusted or like he wanted to pull his hand away. The words he chose always pained Charlie to hear. He hated when Riley wasn't extra careful but he hated it almost as much when he became sad and thought about the fire. Only Charlie should have to remember that, only Charlie should be forced to suffer the nightmares and the memory of the agony and the scent of his flesh burning. Riley should never have to say he was sorry. Sorry for what? Sorry that he hadn't gotten to Charlie faster, a complete stranger that Riley risked his life to save? That was his Riley. The Riley he protected. The one that no one, not stenches or Cholo, would take away from him. There was Slack too and he liked her a lot. She always had a smile for him and never veered away when she realized that she was walking or standing next to him. He realized that if he and Riley were to ever split away from the group, that he would be okay with her coming with them. Riley seemed to like her and get along well with her, and Charlie knew that the three of them made a good pair. When he told Riley this he had laughed and handed Charlie his soup can to eat the other half of. He hadn't understood why Riley had laughed at that, whether the notion of Slack coming with them was laughable or whether the idea of Riley and Charlie both leaving the group together was. It wasn't pity that played a hand in Riley agreeing to keep Charlie around, Riley was too smart for that. It also wasn't entirely the idea of someone to watch Riley's back either. That hadn't been sure to Charlie for a long time until Riley had stripped himself bare, both figuratively and literally, in front of Charlie and somehow without words, told Charlie everything that he wanted and every fear that he had that he was doing the wrong thing, leading Charlie where he had no right to take him. Charlie had shushed him and Riley had stood stock still and stared at him, wide-eyed, not because he had been hushed but because Charlie was telling Riley he wanted him to lead him, in every way. In every way that didn't matter compared to the rest of the world but mattered to them. Riley never talked unless words had to be said, but he always answered Charlie truthfully. The 'I love you' hadn't come till later. Long after numerous apologies and nights of sitting up and listening to the silence around them, permeating the world in places where there were no stenches. Riley didn't say it tonight, tonight was when he thought about his hands, burning, clutching Charlie's coat and pulling him out of the fire. Charlie knew what was eating at Riley because he had told him once, and now Charlie could always read it in the slight slump of his shoulders and the sharp line in between his brows. \"I'm sorry.\" \"You saved me. Don't...,\" Charlie almost stuttered. \"Don't say sorry.\" \"Some things you just can't help, Charlie.\" \"We can help each other.\" Riley turned his head away and chuckled, never voicing the words 'not what I meant.' He knew what Charlie knew and would never assume otherwise. He never thought Charlie was stupid like everyone else said he was, like Charlie knew he was. The first time Charlie had asked him and every time after Riley had just said that he was 'different,' that was it, and Charlie really found himself liking the sound of that. Right now though... right now he didn't have to think about any of those things. He made a motion for Riley to turn over on his other side and Riley did, but not before he smiled knowingly at Charlie and patted his cheek lightly, one of the very few gestures that always led to an erratic thumping of Charlie's heart. Charlie removed his own shirt then and pressed himself up against Riley's back, arm draping itself across Riley's chest, hand tucking under Riley's arm. They laid there, the last of the fireworks erupting outside the walls of Dead Reckoning. Charlie realized then and there that the fire, as bad as it had been, had lead him to this. Had led him to Riley. As Riley's head turned back towards him, Charlie could just make out in the near complete darkness that there were pieces of starlight in Riley's eyes. Starlight brighter than any star flowers Charlie had ever seen.

A/N: Pretty dark stuff, but I don't think it's too bad. Involves rape. The good guys shall triumph though, never fear. Set as if they'd never gone to Uniontown. Summary: When Kaufman goes too far and rapes Cholo one night, Riley decides it's time to step in and help his second in command. -ooOoo- The fairly large box of documents that Cholo had been commissioned to collect and bring to his employer was heavy in the raven-haired man's arms as he stood calmly on the escalator, listening to the familiar hum of the machinery. He drummed his fingers on the cardboard for a moment, then stepped off the escalator and strolled down the hall, boots clicking on the linoleum as he walked. When he arrived at the door to Kaufman's penthouse, he jerked his chin at the watchman, a coy smile playing upon his lips. The guard swiftly opened the door, ushering Cholo inside before firmly closing it behind him. A shiver danced down Cholo's spine for some reason he couldn't explain, and he hesitantly stepped further into the flat. \"Hey, boss.\" He called, voice echoing about the large, bright room. \"I brought you those papers you wanted.\" Cholo said, striding over to the armchair where Kaufman was sitting. The older man slowly stood and accepted the box, eyeing Cholo coldly. \"I expected this sooner, Mr. DeMuro.\" He said stiffly. \"I know, sir, it's just I've been busy with all the other jobs you've given me, and-\" Kaufman cut Cholo off by brushing him aside and making his way over to the mini-bar in the corner. Cholo watched Kaufman as he poured them both drinks, adding some sort of white powder into one of them. \"What's that?\" Cholo inquired curiously, smoothing his hands over the front of his jacket. \"Just a little something I picked up yesterday. It makes the drink a lot more…suited to your tastes.\" Kaufman responded airily, motioning for Cholo to come towards him. Cholo immediately obeyed, taking his drink and sipping from it eagerly. \"Mmm. That is good, boss.\" Kaufman smiled somewhat nastily. \"You're welcome, Mr. DeMuro.\" Cholo suddenly felt woozy. He took a step backwards as Kaufman's smile became a malevolent, mocking leer of triumph. Cholo stumbled slightly, the glass slipping from his fingers and shattering upon the floor. White lights flashing before his eyes, Cholo felt the ground drop out from beneath his feet as he swayed, then collapsed. Kaufman's smile brightened. -ooOoo- When Cholo came to, the first thing he realized was that he was naked. And in bed. A bed that wasn't his own. The next thing he realized was that there was someone in bed beside him. That person was also naked. It was Kaufman. The other man was fast asleep, snoring loudly. Cholo's eyes widened and he unsteadily scooted away from his employer. The small movement set the muscles in his legs on fire. Cholo made a small noise of pain in the back of his throat at this new development, cringing back even further from Kaufman. Slowly, his drug-hazed brain made the connection. Cholo realized that Kaufman, for his own nefarious purposes, had drugged and raped him. Bile rose in Cholo's throat as he frantically scrambled to get out of Kaufman's bed and find his clothes. Each article of clothing was tossed onto the floor along with Kaufman's, and with each passing second Cholo felt sicker and sicker to his stomach, the pain in his legs and ass not helping. There was a bit of dried blood on the sheets and on the insides of his thighs, also indicating that Kaufman had been far from gentle with him. Oh God, oh God, oh God, please no, please, oh God… Cholo thought as he hurriedly stepped into his jeans, discarding his boxers, which had been torn down the seam in Kaufman's haste to disrobe him. Cholo struggled to pull his shirt over his head, then shrugged into his jacket. Being in the same vicinity of Kaufman became too much for Cholo, the room heavily scented with the musk of a man's release, and the dark-haired man uneasily made his way to the door. As he opened the door and stepped out of the penthouse, he felt his stomach lurch, and he promptly vomited all over the watchman's shoes. \"Sorry.\" Cholo muttered hoarsely, wiping his mouth on his sleeve and stumbling barefoot down the stairs. The guard stared after him, eyes wide, but Cholo paid no attention to him or any other person as he exited Fiddler's Green and stepped into the crisp morning air.[Chapter 2] Cholo was limping when he arrived at the guardhouse under the river, ignoring the others looking at him curiously. Foxy, the man who had been his best friend for as long as he could remember, was the first to approach him. \"Hey, bro, where were you last night? We had a great time at the bar, you missed a whole lot of crazy-ass shit!\" Foxy called, grinning like a loon as he sauntered towards Cholo. Cholo swallowed dryly and said, \"I was-uh…with someone.\" Foxy's grin brightened as he assumed Cholo was referring to a prostitute. \"Awesome, bro.\" He said, clapping his hand over Cholo's shoulder and leading him to the unofficial coffee break room. Cholo sat numbly at the table in a folding chair, brow creased together with pain as his legs continued to ache painfully. \"Yeah.\" He muttered as Foxy set a steaming mug in front of him and sat across from him in another folding chair. \"So, bro, what's up for today?\" Foxy asked, folding his hands behind his head and kicking his feet up onto the table. \"Nothing.\" Cholo replied shortly. Foxy's eyes narrowed and his grin slowly melted into a concerned frown. \"You okay, bro?\" \"Sure.\" Cholo said quietly. \"Man, that chick did a number on ya' last night!\" Foxy joked weakly, eyes still focused on Cholo's face. Cholo didn't reply as he pushed his coffee aside and stood up. \"I'll see ya' later then?\" Foxy called after him as Cholo soundlessly walked out the door, pulling his jacket closer around him. \"Hey, bro, where are your shoes?\" Foxy asked, standing as well and beginning to follow his friend. \"With the chick.\" Cholo snapped bitterly as he shrugged a gun over his shoulder and toed into an extra pair of boots. Not bothering to lace up the boots, he turned on his heel and stalked off, emotions boiling up before he could suppress them. Within seconds, Cholo broke into a run and stormed up the stairs, shoving a younger guard out of the way and running full speed into the open air. Cholo ran long and hard until his legs seemed to be on fire and his lungs felt as if they were about to burst. Gasping for air, Cholo bent over and began dry heaving. Soon he was on his hands and knees, struggling to regain his breath. He felt dizzy, as if he couldn't control which direction he was looking, and collapsed sideways into the dirt. Closing his eyes, Cholo lay there for a few moments, breathing in shakily. Suddenly, a concerned voice cut through the air. \"Cholo?\" Footsteps echoed towards him, and then someone knelt beside him, tossing a gun to the ground at his side. \"Cholo, what the hell happened?\" It was Cholo's superior, Riley Denbo. Cholo let out a soft groan, and he weakly curled up even further into a ball. \"Go away.\" He said half-heartedly. \"Hey, what happened to you?\" Riley repeated, cautiously resting a hand upon Cholo's shoulder. Cholo shrugged that shoulder rather feebly. \"Nothing.\" \"Hey, Riley, who's that?\" Another voice asked from a small distance away. \"It's Cholo!\" Riley called as footsteps approached behind them. \"Oh. What's wrong with him?\" Charlie asked, eyes wide as he fingered his gun. \"I don't know.\" Riley said quietly as he shifted his weight behind Cholo and gently rolled the other man over. Sighing shakily, Cholo opened his eyes and gazed up at Riley's worried face. \"Hey, Denbo.\" He greeted hoarsely. \"Hey, Cholo. Are you okay?\" Riley asked, eyebrows raised quizzically. \"I'm fine.\" Cholo muttered, accepting Riley's help and sitting up. \"No you aren't. Why are you lying on the ground in the middle of nowhere?\" Riley asked, eyes narrowed stubbornly. \"I'm tired.\" Cholo lied pathetically, refusing to meet Riley's gaze. \"So you decided to sleep on the middle of the street on the way to the bazaar?\" Riley asked sarcastically. \"Come on, let's get you inside.\" He slipped his arm around Cholo's waist and helped hoist him up onto his feet. Cholo shrugged him off and stood, crossing his arms over his chest in self-defense. \"Leave me alone.\" He snapped, turning and walking away a bit unsteadily. Cholo closed his eyes against the pain in his legs, which was slowly creeping up to his ass as well. His steps faltered, and he stumbled slightly. \"Shit.\" He hissed under his breath. Riley was at his side in a flash. He grabbed Cholo by the shoulders and looked him straight in the eye. \"Tell me what happened Cholo.\" He ordered firmly, eyes narrowed suspiciously. Cholo swallowed, then looked to the ground. \"I went to deliver something to Kaufman last night.\" He began reluctantly. \"And…he drugged me…and when I woke up…he…\" Cholo trailed off and looked out over the river that he could see in the distance. \"Kaufman raped me.\" Riley's eyes went wide as saucers. \"Kaufman…raped you?\" He choked out. Cholo nodded jerkily, wrapping his arms tightly around himself. \"Holy shit.\" Riley said softly, running his hands through his hair. \"Shit, Cholo, I'm so sorry.\" Charlie watched them, eyes wide. \"Oh, my God.\" ","Summary":" Title: Bitter Sweet Pain Author: VenusEvilOverlord Fandom: Land of the Dead Pairing: Cholo/Kaufman,"},{"Movie":"Princess Of Thieves","Title":"Heir of Thieves","Author":"WizMonCruWil","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11563941","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Chapter 1: Gwyn's New Life and Froderick's Offer Gwyn was despondent as she galloped through the English countryside. She had to get as far away from Westminister Abbey and the palace as possible. Why was her home at such a distance? Yes, she knew Sherwood Forest was the safe haven of the Merry Men – the group she now co-commanded with her father, the famous Robin Hood. Still, she and her horse were exhausted. Her emotions did not help alleviate this much. Gwyn was returning from Prince – no, King – Phillip's palace. The newly crowned ruler whose life she had helped protect from Prince John and the Sheriff of Nottingham had wished to speak to her. A letter had arrived a few days previously announcing this intent. There were no details, just that he requested \"an audience with your Ladyship.\" In retrospect, Gwyn wondered why the vague wording of the document had not produced any suspicions in her. She trusted the King, so she had figured it was something important that he need not reiterate to her in person as well as in writing. Once she had arrived in London and at the castle, King Phillip had greeted her warmly. He did not waste words and got right to the point. It was something that he had already told Gwyn just after his coronation, when they had parted on the assumption that they could not be together. That had been several months ago, and already King Phillip had grown resentful of this barrier. He was King, he said, why should he not have everything he desired? He was prepared to pursue what he wanted, and what he wanted was her, Gwyn, as his Queen. He did not care who he would have to run over to get what he wanted – the Church, the Courts. He just knew that he was prepared to do whatever it took. Before Gwyn had had a chance to politely and respectfully decline the King's offer (though she was flattered and wished things could be different as well), the King had closed in and kissed her. At first, she was unsure what to do, but finally relented and returned the affections. It was all very innocent at first, but then the King had begun to escalate things…very quickly, too quickly for Gwyn's liking. She now began to do what she should have done from the beginning, if she had only had her wits about her and kept her usually strong resolve. Her resistance was not unnoticed by Phillip, but he too had a strong will. He knew what he wanted…and as King, he would get it. So, he had picked a slightly struggling Gwyn up, carried her to his master bedroom and continued kissing her in his bed. A battle of wills now turned into a battle of strength. Gwyn was strong, thanks to her bow training and her missions with her father. She put up a good fight, but the King was stronger. He managed to strip Gwyn of all her clothes, and began to perform sexual acts on her. Gwyn squirmed and twisted, but could not break free. She wished to cry out, but could not because of Phillip's relentless kisses. Eventually, the combined raping and her resistance tired her out and she became limp from sheer exhaustion. Phillip had won, and now continued to assault her body freely. He finally let her go once he had satisfied his urgings, but ordered Gwyn to keep the visit quiet, or there might be consequences. Gwyn had only nodded numbly; she was certain she was in shock. Only after she had spurred on her horse beyond the palace gates did she begin to emotionally break down. At long last, the girl could now see the abbey and surrounding farm and compound that was her home in the distance. It was on the edge of Sherwood Forest. Not many people were even aware that the abode harbored many outlaws, but the forest served as a convenient escape route and hiding place in case of an attack. The welcome sight made Gwyn push her horse harder and she burst into the compound at a flying pace. She dismounted clumsily in front of the stable before the horse had even halted. The entire lower half of her body felt as though it was on fire, from both the long ride and the King's penetrations. Stable hands took care of her horse as Gwyn slowly walked up to the monastery home. Inside, the friar brothers and other members of her Merry Men extended family were bustling about. Friar Tuck was the first to notice her. \"Ah, Gwyn, there you are, my girl!\" he chortled. He gave her a hug, which Gwyn indulged. She was surprised at how she stiffened slightly at his touch. Friar Tuck noticed this, however, and quickly deduced that something was not right. He stepped back to get a better look at her. \"What troubles, girl?\" \"None, Uncle\" Gwyn hastily replied, but Tuck was not convinced. As if he could read her thoughts, he followed up with \"Did everything go well with the King?\" The very mention of this was enough to make Gwyn come unglued; she collapsed into Tuck's arms, wailing. \"No-oooo! He- he raped me!\" Tuck looked speechless, and it was only then did he realize the once busy kitchen was eerily quiet. All the other brothers were staring at the poor distraught girl hugging their leader. \"What are you all looking at?!\" Tuck roared with an angry temper uncharacteristic of a servant of the Lord. \"All of you, report to the Chapel for afternoon prayer immediately. Silent intentions until I get there!\" The brothers hustled out of the room as Tuck guided Gwyn upstairs, half-supporting her. He went along the hall, poking into room after room until finally he found who he was looking for. \"Robin!\" he bellowed. \"We have an emergency here!\" Gwyn peeked out from among Tuck's robes to see her father and Will Scarlet turn to face the new arrivals. Robin's stoic gaze quickly melted to one of concern when he beheld the sight before him. \"Good heavens, Gwyn! Are you alright?\" he asked. Gwyn shook her head. For some reason, she could not bear to again utter the words she had told Friar Tuck, so she was relieved when Tuck took it upon himself. \"The King raped her when she had her audience with him today.\" Robin looked stunned, but Will looked enraged. He ran to a table and seized his bow, declaring something about him and Robin marching on the palace themselves and getting themselves an audience with the King. Robin, however, held him back. \"No, Will. If we spoke up, Phillip could make us outlaws again and turn the Sheriff of Nottingham loose on us. We would be back to how we were living under Prince John. Power is on the King's side here. I am just as angry as you are, but I do not think we can do anything.\" They were interrupted by Froderick, one of the prospective monks and Gwyn's childhood friend, who came in carrying a full pail. \"I finished milking the cows, Friar Tuck,\" he announced, but stopped short when he saw Gwyn's state. He rushed over to her as quick as he could without spilling the milk. \"Gwyn, what's the matter?\" Friar Tuck interrupted. \"Store the milk away first, Froderick, then you can return and we will tell you what is going on.\" Froderick, eager to learn what was ailing his best friend, did as he was told immediately. When he returned, he was quickly filled in. He was angry at the King's actions, and vowed to resign his commission on his Majesty's council in protest. Robin reiterated what he had told Will, and Gwyn quietly concurred. \"I will not let you give up your future and earned success for my sake, Froderick,\" she declared. Froderick glanced at her and looked as though he wanted to say something, but kept silent. Tuck soon stole away to supervise the brothers in afternoon prayer, though he allowed Froderick to miss the service so he could help Gwyn. Maids helped Gwyn change out of her clothes, but forebade her from bathing given what had happened to her. Once she was changed, Robin, Will and Froderick helped the girl to bed. As she fell asleep, Gwyn wondered if her life would ever be the same again. Gwyn's question was answered for her sooner than she expected. About 6 weeks after the raping, she discovered that she was pregnant with Phillip's child. Everyone was in awe that the heir to the throne of England was in their presence, even if he (or she) was not born yet. Gwyn created a new routine for herself. She kept herself as busy as possible, doing many chores for as long as she could during her pregnancy. She would eventually have to go on to bed-rest, but she did not want to think about that just yet. Froderick helped her immensely and was almost always at her side except in sleep. Gwyn was grateful for his company, as ever, and he comforted her when she lamented over her diminishing physical mobility. One day in the third month of her pregnancy, Gwyn rose to feed the animals in the barn. Her biggest chore was to milk the cow. Froderick was up at the same time. Already, it was getting somewhat harder for her to move about, so Froderick supported her as they trekked out to the stable. He guided the cow out front and set up the stool before helping Gwyn onto it. She smiled at him gratefully. As she began to milk, Froderick leaned up against the barn wall, opened up his copy of the King James Bible and began to read. He was reading the Holy Book in multiple languages – Latin, Spanish, French, among others – so as to better serve the King when he carried out his commission in foreign lands. Occasionally, he would quiz Gwyn on the languages and their various conjugations – a task that she always tried her best in, but could apply herself more to. Today was no exception. \"Vais, vas, va, allons…\" she began, stumped. \"Allez, vont,\" Froderick finished for her. He sighed, slightly amused. \"How can I tutor you if you don't study?\" \"You're the future missionary, Froderick. French serves you, not me,\" Gwyn retorted. \"The only thing that will serve me is housekeeping so I can better raise my child.\" She was slightly annoyed and frightened of the task before her. Froderick gave a small smile. \"Back to French before you sour her milk.\" Gwyn gasped in mock indignation and twisted the cow's utter around, sending a spray of milk into Froderick's face. She giggled at his reaction. \"Sweet enough, brother Froderick?\" she teased. In response, Froderick tried the one tactic he knew would get her. Gwyn saw it coming and tried to stop him, to no avail. \"No! No- no! Oh no!\" she cried and laughed, as Froderick grabbed her and the two tripped and rolled down the slight embankment, laughing. They ended up with Gwyn on top of Froderick. Breathing heavily, Gwyn was not concentrating. So, she was surprised when Froderick suddenly closed the gaps and kissed her full on the mouth. She gasped in surprise before Froderick's lips solidified their hold on her. His arms encircled her lovingly. His hands drifted lazily down her back and sides until they rested on her dress right on her butt. \"Mmmmmm…No….no….\" Gwyn gasped into Froderick's mouth. She was reminded of her interaction with King Phillip, and started to have a panic attack. But then, Froderick, squeezed that area of her body. He held her gently, and his mouth danced across hers. Slowly but surely (though oddly), Gwyn found herself staring to relax. This was Froderick ; he would never hurt her. All at once, Froderick's tongue flicked out, demanding entrance. Gwyn was so taken aback, that she consented immediately and his tongue squirmed inside of her maw. Froderick deepened the kiss and Gwyn even began to kiss him back. Just when she was beginning to get used to the feel of him, they broke apart. Gwyn was stunned. A part of her wanted to punch her friend, but another part of her was just begging for him to kiss her again. She brought herself back to Earth as Froderick began to speak. \"I've been thinking,\" he said. \"That child of yours is going to need a father. And…I am in love with you, Gwyn. I have been for a long time. I would be willing to marry you, if you'll have me. I could still do my commission, but I would not pursue the priesthood. I could earn the title of Deacon and still be with you and take care of the baby. What would you say to that?\" Gwyn wanted to cry. Froderick was willing to alter his entire future just for her. She was so grateful to him for what he had done for her. Right now, her feelings for him were unsure, but maybe she could learn to love him as a husband and not just a surrogate brother in time. She would give herself to him, a nice and decent man who would take care of her and her child. She gave him a peck on the lips. \"Yes,\" she whispered, before Froderick pulled her flush against him and engaged her lips once more. A week later, Gwyn was adjusting the saddlebags on her horse. Her father had agreed to let her accompany him on one last mission before she would be confined to the compound for the next 6 months. Froderick was also leaving to fulfill his commission in Spain. The horses were guided out to the front gate. Froderick was chatting with Friar Tuck. \"So, Mr. Deacon-to-be,\" Gwyn asked. \"When am I going to see you again?\" \"Probably not for a couple months,\" Froderick replied. Gwyn smiled. \"Then I'll never need to live this down.\" Before Froderick realized what was happening, she had grabbed him around the waist, pulled her to him and gave him a big kiss. It was the first one between them that she had initiated. Froderick got over his surprise and returned the affection. They broke apart and he bid her good-bye. Robin had a small smile on his face. Everyone mounted and took off in opposite directions: Robin, Gwyn and the Merry Men one way, and Froderick in the other. The first party had barely gone a mile when they heard hooves behind them and a voice calling out \"Wait!\" Gwyn slowed her horse and turned. Froderick was galloping full throttle toward her. He stopped in front of her, grabbed her face and gave her a giant kiss of his own. Then, he turned and galloped back the way he had come, shouting \"I love you!\" as he went. Gwyn smiled. For the first time in awhile, she felt things were going to turn out fine. The mission did not take long, and the Merry Men had returned within the month. 3 months after that, Froderick returned from Spain a full-fledged Deacon. Gwyn was overjoyed to see her fiancé again and he told her all about his time there. He had had to deliver a report to the King, but he had gone about it as though nothing was wrong, as hard as that was for him. Interestingly, the King had not asked about Gwyn at all. At 6 months pregnant, this news left Gwyn angrier than she probably would have been otherwise; mood swings were beginning to kick in. At 7 months pregnant, Gwyn and Froderick were married in a quiet ceremony in the monastery of Sherwood Compound and Farm. The bride looked beautiful and Froderick was almost bursting with pride. Friar Tuck officiated, and Robin seemed happy to be giving his daughter away to a man whom he trusted. The kiss was magical. Gwyn and Froderick spent their honeymoon in nearby Canterbury, but Gwyn felt she was of no help to her husband because she was now on bed-rest. She and Froderick did not have intercourse, because the rape was still fresh in Gwyn's mind. Also, Froderick was afraid he might hurt the baby for some reason, which Gwyn thought was cute. At long last, 9 months was reached, and a healthy baby boy was born. Gwyn had thought long and hard on a name that would be appropriate for the great Robin Hood's grandson. \"Conrad,\" she said at last. Froderick snapped his head up and frowned. He knew why she had picked that name, and it probably served as half of a reminder, half not. Conrad had been the name of King Phillip's valet, who had been murdered while protecting his master as they traveled to claim the throne of England. It was also the name Phillip had gone by to hide his identity; the name Gwyn and Froderick had known him as for a short time. Still, Froderick wanted to respect his wife's decision and knew he wanted to be the best father possible to this baby, even if it was not his biologically. But that was something the couple would keep to themselves. Right now, a family was created and complete. That same night, the Sheriff of Nottingham paced in his quarters. A rider had given him the news weeks ago, but he wanted to have information as soon as it became available. Suddenly, he heard movement downstairs and approached the balcony. \"What?!\" he demanded. A messenger, newly arrived, looked up. \"You gave me orders to inform you the moment the child was born, my Lord,\" the messenger said. The Sheriff came down the stairs and looked through some scrolls. \"Shall I order a price on the infant's head my Lord?\" \"Equal to the prices set on his grandfather and mother\" the Sheriff snarled. He turned back to face them. \"Robin Hood shall not have a grandson, to plague Nottingham with his legacy.\" \"Very well, my Lord,\" the messenger sighed. \"That will be 10,000 pounds then on the head of the infant…Conrad of Locksley.\"[Chapter 2] Chapter 2: Conrad of Locksley, Heir of Two Kingdoms The sun shone against the peaceful grass in the English countryside. Suddenly, a horse's hooves trampled the green stalks. The beast flew as if it did not touch the Earth, supporting the laughing 15-year old youth on its back. Conrad of Locksley whooped as he spurred on for Sherwood Compound and Farm. He had just left the Forest behind him and was now making great time across the vast, empty plains. He slowed down yards away from the compound gates and entered the stable yard at a moderate trot. Dismounting, he brought his steed to the stable and gave him a pail of water. He was just about to fetch a pail for himself when he heard a familiar voice calling. \"Conrad? Conrad? Conrad Froderick Locksley, you answer me right this minute!\" Conrad sighed. His mother had a temper like no other woman alive. His grandfather told him she possessed the same temper of his late wife. \"Yes, Mother? I'm here!\" Conrad called. Gwyn appeared in the stable doorway. She stopped short. It was always startling to see how much her son resembled his father. Thankfully, there were enough of her features in him that no one important had yet suspected he was the (albeit illegitimate) heir to the throne of England. His actions also obscured his true heritage. Conrad had taken to thieving, like his mother and grandfather before him, like a pig to slop. The boy had a keen and natural yearning for adventure and thrills. This sometimes frightened Gwyn, if that fright only came from her motherly instincts. She had turned out like her father just as much as Conrad was turning out to be like her. The legacy of Robin Hood was being passed down to a third generation. Conrad had been finally allowed to accompany the band of outlaws on a small mission two years ago, and even then under the watchful eye of his mother. The Merry Men had already taken to giving their leaders (including Conrad as an unofficial one) titles. Robin was the \"Prince of Thieves\"; Gwyn was the \"Princess of Thieves\"; and Conrad was the \"Heir of Thieves.\" Only a small inner circle knew the almost chilling implications behind these cheeky nicknames, especially in the case of the latter. Conrad approached his mother with an air of pride that seemed just like Phillip's. \"I brought back some venison,\" he declared, presenting a dead turkey. \"Shot it in Sherwood Forest at 50 paces, on my word of honor. Should be able to feed us for a week.\" Gwyn could not help but smile, despite the fact that she was reluctant of her son's hunting adventures. The Sheriff of Nottingham and his supporters worked as illegal vigilantes in the area, rounding up outlaws and carting them over to York, where some members of the high courts there still favored Prince John. \"Bring it inside, and the brothers will store it in the cooling shed. Then, go find your father. You're nearly late for afternoon prayer.\" Conrad did his best to hide his disdain for any religious services. He only endured them because his mother ordered him to, and his father enjoyed them so. He loved his father, Froderick, and was very proud of his status as a Deacon. The lad also respected how much the man loved his mother. However, Conrad knew the life of the faithful was not for him. He would lead the life of his mother and grandfather; it was in his blood. He could feel it! The boy made his way to the small chapel in the back of the compound. His father was already there, on bended knee, praying. He only snapped out of his reverence when the door clanged shut. \"Conrad, my boy!\" Froderick called. \"You're just about on time! Friar Tuck and the others should be here soon.\" Conrad went over to kneel by his father. They folded their hands and began to recite the Lord's Prayer together, first in English, then in Latin – the deacon's favorite language. Conrad could not fathom how his father could be fluent in half a dozen tongues; his mother said it was an inherent gift. Others joined them by degrees, and the service lasted for nearly an hour. At long last, bells in the chapel steeple released them for the evening meal. Meals at Sherwood Compound and Farm were always crowded, loud and delicious. All of the food came from right out of the Earth, created by human hands. Froderick said that connecting to the Earth in this way gave one a deeper awe and appreciation for God's creation. All Conrad knew was that \"God's creation\" produced good meat. Father and son slipped into chairs on either side of Gwyn. Gwyn frowned in what Conrad knew to be mock disapproval. \"I would like dining with you better, my love, if you didn't wear your robes to meals,\" she teased her husband. Froderick shot a glance at her and smirked. \"Would you like me better if I just grabbed you, threw you down and kissed you from head to toe?\" he retorted. And he did just that, kissing Gwyn passionately. Some of the Merry Men chortled. Gwyn didn't care, as she melted into the kiss, and gave a tiny whimper when they broke apart. She adored kissing her husband more and more as the years went by. \"You are most bold, sir,\" she smiled. \"Most bold, indeed.\" Friar Tuck clapped his hands. \"Alright, everyone. No more necking at the Lord's Table. Who wants to say Grace?\" Will Scarlet volunteered that night. Then, everyone began to dig in. Some of Conrad's turkey venison had already been procured for the meal, and Robin even commented on how delicious it was. Conrad proudly took claim for the fresh meat; he was never happier than when he could tell his grandfather of his adventures. Robin's praise meant the world to him. \"50 paces, you say? A crack shot, just like his mama's old man,\" the aging rogue laughed. \"Your mother couldn't hit anything from that far away at 15, could you, Gwyn?\" Gwyn just stuffed some vegetables into her mouth to avoid answering. All too soon, it was time for bed. Conrad bathed as he always did at night and got dressed for the night. Gwyn soon came in and kissed him goodnight; Froderick followed suit. It was a ritual that Conrad endured for his parents' sake. But one ritual he did not mind at all was asking his father for a bedtime story. Tonight was no exception. Froderick feigned slight annoyance at his surrogate son's request. \"Aren't you a little old for bedtime stories?\" he asked. When Conrad avoided the question, Froderick relented and asked what story he wanted to hear. The Deacon already knew the answer. It was the story of the Battle of Sherwood Forrest, in which he had dived in front of the Prince (soon to be King) and taken an arrow to the chest for him, saving the Prince's life. As always, Conrad would ask to see the scar the arrow's tip had left, and Froderick would proudly show it. Then, it was lights out. But before that could happen that night, Conrad had a question he wished to ask his father. \"Father? When I was getting ready for bed just now, Cressida the old maid came to gather my clothes. She looked at me and said she thought I looked a lot like the King. Is that strange? I'm not related to his Majesty.\" Froderick frowned. He was torn. He wanted his son to know the truth – that he was not really his son. But, he also was reluctant to reveal that information. He was proud to be considered Conrad's father in all but blood, because it tied him further to Gwyn, whom he loved deeply. So, he simply replied, \"Sometimes the Lord makes us in the likeness of other people – people whom we have never met or share no kinship with. It means we are destined for great things.\" He bid Conrad good night and retired to his quarters and the bed he shared with Gwyn. His wife was just finishing dressing. The two got into bed together and held each other in the darkness. Froderick finally worked up the nerve to tell Gwyn about the earlier conversation. \"Gwyn?\" \"Hmm?\" she sighed, snuggling closer to him. \"Conrad asked me an interesting question at bedtime tonight.\" \"And what was that?\" Gwyn sighed, half not paying attention, as she began to trail kisses, licks and love bites down her husband's neck. \"He asked me how he could look like the King but not be related to him.\" Gwyn stopped what she was doing and looked him full in the face. \"Did you tell him anything?\" she asked. \"No,\" Froderick admitted. \"I wasn't ready.\" \"We will tell him in time,\" Gwyn dismissed. \"But…out of curiosity, when will you be ready?\" Froderick thought for a moment. \"Soon,\" he promised her. \"And by that, I mean in a few years, when he's grown.\" Gwyn smiled and rolled on top of him. \"Good. Because I'm not ready to give him up just yet either…and he's actually mine.\" She stopped when she saw the expression on Froderick's face. She sometimes forgot how much it hurt him to remember that Conrad was not actually his child. He wanted children to actually call his own in every sense of the word. She knew that. She felt terrible that she had not been able to give him any, and almost felt that she could not. Maybe he felt the same too. But, there was nothing that said they could not try. She decided to be brave and take the chance. She had had sex with her husband before, but it had never been with the intent to try and conceive. Froderick deserved her to go that extra mile after all he had done for her and Conrad. She pulled back his shirt until his scar was revealed and kissed it gently. She even lightly sucked on the cut. \"Froderick, I do love you,\" she said softly. She gave a small peck on the lips. Then again, longer this time. The kiss soon became more intense, and the passion grew in rough spurts. At last, Gwyn paused just long enough to slip her nightgown over her head; she was now naked. She and her beloved husband began to make deep, passionate, sexy love. The climax for both of them was brilliant, and they fell asleep in each other's arms; each other's tastes on their tongues and their scents filling the room.[Chapter 3] Chapter 3: Will Stutely is Captured The next spring morning, all of the brothers and Merry Men sat down to breakfast on Sherwood Compound and Farm. Conrad helped himself to hard-boiled eggs the chickens had just hatched that morning, and a fresh glass of milk squeezed from the cow. Just then, Robin tapped his own glass to call for silence. \"We have another mission,\" he announced. \"We will be traveling via Sherwood Forest to Canterbury to investigate claims of corruption by the social elite. There will be plenty of thieving involved, but it could get messy, so be armed.\" Gwyn smiled. She was fond of Canterbury, as she had honeymooned there with Froderick after they were first married. As such, it worried her that the poor might be suffering there. \"Also,\" her father continued. \"I believe it is not dangerous enough for our youngest recruit to not join us.\" He winked at Conrad, then faced his daughter. \"What say you, Gwyn?\" Gwyn swallowed a bite of food before replying. \"Provided he stays close to me, that should be fine.\" Conrad was excited. He was not allowed to go on every mission, so the sporadic adventure with the Merry Men was most welcome. As soon as the meal was over, everyone split to gather supplies for the journey. Conrad guided his, Gwyn's and Robin's horses from the stable and tied them to the front gate. Then, he ran back to the tool shed to collect weaponry. He and his family always carried bows and arrows, their weapon of choice. But, he also supplemented with a medium-sized broadsword attached to his belt. When he returned, he saw most everyone was prepared and ready to go. Froderick, Tuck and some of the other brothers were waiting with them. Conrad embraced his father, and the latter placed a peck on the boy's forehead. \"Be careful, son,\" the deacon warned. Then, he kissed Gwyn goodbye. \"Love you,\" they both echoed. Everyone climbed aboard their steeds and trotted off in the direction of Sherwood Forrest. \"Be safe!\" Froderick called as he watched his family and their followers gallop away. The ride through Sherwood Forrest was always pleasant. It never ceased to amaze Conrad – the sights, the sounds. Robin also never failed to notice this, and would chuckle at his grandson's rapture. \"There's nothing to see, boy,\" he would tell Conrad. \"I used to live here in these woods, you know, many years ago. Riding through the wilderness is a far cry from having to survive in it.\" About midday, the band reached the other edge of the trees and galloped across the plains. Canterbury was but a few miles away. Just when they could see the city in the distance, Robin slowed. \"We'd better store our horses somewhere safe and enter the city on foot. We'll have the element of surprise on our side if we do it that way. But, where to put the beasts?\" \"There, Master,\" said Much the Miller's Son. A mill was close by. \"I know the family that lives there, and they're no friend of the rich. I bet if we ask, they'd be glad to store the horses for us.\" The Merry Men approached the mill, and Robin met with the merchant out front. The miller was glad to meet the famous Robin Hood, and promised to store the steeds and keep their presence here to himself. The band then continued to approach Canterbury on foot. It was not a long hike, as they would only have to traverse three hills and an open field. It gave Conrad some time to chat with his mother. At last, they reached the front gates. Everyone pulled hoods over their heads to disguise themselves and went inside. Robin warned everyone to keep their eyes and ears open. They progressed through the streets and the main square, where merchants were hawking their goods. Just then, Will Stutely spotted a poor beggar woman being bullied by some men in dark robes. They were taking some alms from her. \"Leave that poor woman alone!\" Will called as he approached. Before the men could react, Will had swiped the coins back from them. He tried to flee, intending to return the money to the lady when he had lost these men in a sure pursuit. But, one of the men was quick. He tackled Will Stutely and then through back his hood. It was one of the Sheriff of Nottingham's deputies! \"You're under arrest for thievery and defying the rule of law!\" The commotion was quickly noticed by the common people; the Merry Men among them. Conrad wanted to rush forward. If he were beyond the crowd he could hit that bastard straight in the eye with an arrow at 20 paces, easy. But, Gwyn held him back. \"No, son!\" she told him. \"They'll nab you too!\" The deputies tied up Will Stutely and began to cart him away on a horse. Robin managed to steal another in the confusion, as only a master robber could, and pursue them. But the Sheriff's deputies were too fast and out ran him with little effort. Defeated, Robin let the beast go free and jogged back to Canterbury. \"Couldn't catch him,\" he hissed to Little John and Will Scarlet. \"Out of here quickly! Get the horses and make haste back to the Farm!\" The Merry Men and Gwyn and Conrad raced back to the nearby mill and retrieved their rides. Then, the band galloped at a furious pace back across the plains, through Sherwood Forest and to their home beyond. Froderick was tilling some crops when they approached. \"Halloo, all!\" he called, giving his wife a kiss in greeting as she dismounted. \"How'd the mission go?\" \"We broke up some corruption, but Will Stutely got nabbed by some sly fellows in black. We think they work for the Sheriff,\" Little John reported. \"There's only one place they'll go with him,\" Robin added. \"York. They'll try him there, and most likely hang him. We have to get there by morning tomorrow!\" He turned to his Merry Men, 140 strong. \"This mission does not require all of you – just some of our best fighters. Little John, Will Scarlet, Much, Gwyn, Allen-a-Dale – I want you all to accompany me. Oh, and Tuck – could you spare an extra staff and join us?\" \"I may be old,\" the friar said, \"but I've still got a spring in my step!\" Arthur-a-Bland, George-a-Greene, David of Doncaster and Gilbert with the White Hand also volunteered. \"I want to go too!\" Conrad said. Gwyn rounded on him. \"Absolutely not! You were ready to hit that one man with an arrow, and he could have grabbed you as soon as look at you! This is much too dangerous; no place for a boy your age!\" \"I can help, Mother!\" Conrad protested. \"11 souls can't rescue Will Stutely. Make it an even dozen, and we might have a chance!\" \"You asked for my permission, but my answer is no,\" Gwyn stated firmly. \"And that is final! You will stay here with your father until we return. Understood?\" Conrad was fuming, but he could not talk back with Froderick right there. So, he simply mumbled \"Yes, ma'am.\" Gwyn softened and planted a kiss on his forehead. \"You'll be much safer here,\" she assured him. She turned to Froderick, who pulled her into a tight embrace and gave her a long kiss. \"Be careful,\" he implored her. Gwyn shut him up with another kiss. \"Don't worry,\" she replied. The chosen members of the rescue party mounted their horses. It was a long ride to York so they would have to leave right then if they had any hope of recovering Will Stutely alive. They galloped off into the evening. Conrad watched them go sadly. Then, he followed his father into the monastery to prepare for evening prayer and dinner. That night, when everyone was fast asleep, Conrad stole out of bed. He slipped out the window, across the rooftop and dropped to the ground. When he had reached the stable, he quietly roused his horse, gathered supplies and mounted him. Then, he took off into the night after his grandfather's party.[Chapter 4] Chapter 4: Rescue at York and the Truth Comes Out Conrad rode through the night, not even stopping to rest himself or his horse. His beast was a trooper and did not complain. The speed proved to pay off, and they made great time. As the sky was beginning to gray, Conrad could make out a fleet of horses in the distance and deduced it must be the rescue party. He clicked the reins and spurred his horse onward, faster. At last, he overtook the back of the pack. Their own horses' hooves covered the sounds of his own and Conrad hoped that he might be able to blend in at the rear until they got to York. However, that was probably too much to hope for, and not to be ultimately. Gilbert with the White Hand glanced back at one point and spotted the lad. \"Conrad?\" Before the youth could strike a deal with the man, who was nearly Robin's equal in archery, to keep his presence quiet, Gilbert called up, \"Master! Stop! You might want to take a look at this!\" The rest of the party stopped and turned. Reactions were mixed. However, Gwyn was furious and steered her ride so that she was directly across from her son. \"How dare you disobey me! Your father must be worried sick by now!\" Her temper had always unnerved Conrad, but this time, he did his best to hold firm. \"I wanted to help, Mother. And trust me, I think you will need it.\" He did not care if this sounded arrogant, especially in the presence of outlaws with far more experience than he. Before Gwyn could argue back, Robin placed a hand on her shoulder. \"I'd let it go, Gwyn. We should be thankful for his help. But,\" he added, and here he faced his grandson. \"You must stay with us, keep calm, and do exactly as I say. Or anyone else, for that matter. Do I make myself clear?\" \"Transparently,\" Conrad responded. His grandfather nodded, satisfied, and turned his horse around. \"Onward, men!\" The sun had scarcely finished rising into the sky when the rescue party made their final approach to York. This time, Robin did not pause to hide the horses; he had no intention of doing so. The plan was to rush the gates as one on the beasts, and begin to attack. Dismounting would come later once they had located Will Stutely. Robin loaded his bow. \"CHARGE!\" he roared, before spurring his horse into a breakneck pace. The others followed suit, and began to fire. Several guards posted at the gate were felled. Conrad loaded an arrow and fired. His aim was perfect as the arrow passed through the iron gate and sliced through the ropes supporting it. The gate rolled up with a clang. The Merry Men thundered across the drawbridge and into the main square. They were in the nick of time, for they could see Will Stutely at the gallows. The stool was kicked out from under him and he began to be strangled by the noose. Gwyn quickly let an arrow fly and it sliced the noose in half. Will Stutely collapsed to the ground, where he was quickly scooped up by Little John. The party was just about to reverse their path and make their escape in a classic hit-and-run when guards suddenly poured out of the nearby garrison and quickly surrounded the band. Gwyn instinctively shielded Conrad with her arm. \"Don't move!\" she ordered him. The guards were about to close in when a voice called out. \"Stay!\" said an officious looking man sitting at a nearby platform with other nobles. Gwyn quickly did a double-take. It was Phillip, the King! What was he doing at the planned hanging of Will Stutely? Conrad also got a good look at his Majesty. It struck him how much he did resemble the royal monarch. The King drew closer to the outlaws. \"Gwyn? Is that really you?\" Being addressed thus made Gwyn stiffen. How dare he call her by name, as if they were old friends and nothing had happened! \"Yes,\" she replied coldly. Phillip's gaze shifted from her to the boy she was defending. He blinked in surprise. He deduced almost immediately the truth and then smiled. \"Come now, Gwyn put your weapons down. Do you really think I would harm our own son?\" Robin set an arrow in the notch of his bow. \"You will die before you touch either of them, you raping heathen! I don't care if you are the King!\" But Conrad was not paying any attention. He felt as though his head was swimming. Did his Grace just say… our son?! \"I knew there was more to us than I realized!\" the youth blurted out. The King nodded. \"Yes, my boy, your mother loved me, and I her. We did have intercourse, but I never dreamed something would result from it.\" \"You mean after you raped me!\" Gwyn shot back. \"You knew I could not be with you, and you wanted me anyway! I wish you had no connection with Conrad!\" Phillip blinked. \"You named him… Conrad?\" Gwyn averted her gaze and mumbled something about not wanting to forget but also forget. Conrad, however, was fuming. The King raped his mother?! And got away with it besides?! There were a lot of things Conrad was now not sure about. But there was one thing he knew beyond a shadow of a doubt: this man was no father of his. But His Majesty was now speaking to him again. \"Conrad,\" the ruler pleaded and he actually knelt before him. \"You are the answer to a prayer. My Queen and I have been unable to produce an heir. Now we don't have to – you're him! You are the rightful heir to the throne of England. If you come with me, you can have anything and everything you want. You could be King someday!\" Conrad thought for a moment. He could live a life of wealth and luxury. He could do whatever he wanted. But, then he looked at his mother. Her eyes were pleading. And, the boy realized the life of a monarch was not the life he had always dreamed of. \"I'm sorry, your Majesty, but I already am the heir to another throne: my grandfather's realm of robbers and criminals. I am the Heir of Thieves, like my mother and grandfather before me. And I already have a father – his name is Froderick.\" Phillip looked stunned. He was about to ask Gwyn for an explanation, but then straightened. He could not change the lad's mind, so he said, \"All of you, get out and take your friend with you before I sick my guards on you.\" The Merry Men did not need to be told twice. They broke the ranks of the guards and galloped out of York. Conrad stole one last look at the man who was responsible for his existence. Somehow, he knew, they would never meet again.[Chapter 5] Chapter 5: A Newcomer is Welcomed All the way back to Sherwood Compound and Farm, Conrad bombarded his mother with questions. Gwyn had no choice but to supply the answers, and actually seemed happy to do so. It must have been hard for her, Conrad rationalized, to keep such a secret for so long. She told him everything, from her audience with the King gone wrong just a few months after the new ruler took the throne to falling in love with and marrying Froderick to her pregnancy and Conrad's birth. It was a fascinating story, to say the least. It took the rescue party most of the day to travel back home, and they finally reached Sherwood Compound and Farm a while after dark. Everyone else was already asleep; there were no lights on in the buildings. The rescue party stored their provisions and some of the Merry Men helped Will Stutely to the table so they could administer any necessary medical help. Robin retired with only a mumbled good night, and Gwyn and Conrad also went upstairs to go to bed. As they parted ways at their respective doors, Conrad said, \"Thank you, Mother, for telling me.\" She nodded and wished pleasant dreams before disappearing into her room. Conrad slipped to the door and secretly watched as his mother lowered herself next to her husband. She kissed his cheek and whispered \"I love you,\" before sinking into her pillow. Conrad tiptoed back to his bed, collapsed on the comforter and fell asleep at once. A few weeks later, exciting news spread across the farm: Gwyn was pregnant again. This time, it was certain that Froderick was the father. Conrad noted how happy his father was. Initially after he had learned of his origins, he would have to stop himself, but then he had given up. What he had told the King was true: Froderick was his father, the only one he had ever known. The King did not deserve to be referred to with any paternal titles after what he had done to Gwyn, as far as Conrad was concerned. Froderick was certainly happy, but also nervous. He had experienced this before with Conrad's birth, but the feelings had been different because the boy had not been his. There was more trepidation that this was his actual child now. Also, memories of Gwyn's first pregnancy and her rape re-surfaced as the months progressed. Strange, that he should have these fears and his wife not. This was made perfectly clear to him one night. Froderick awoke from a horrible nightmare screaming. \"No! No! No!\" he was yelling. He was clutching Gwyn's back as he firmly grasped her naked breast. As he came into consciousness, he could hear his wife's soothing voice. \"It's okay, Froderick, I'm right here,\" Gwyn reassured her husband in an attempt to calm his breathing. She placed her hand over the one on her breast and interlaced her fingers with his. \"What was it this time?\" \"Phillip raped you again…after I left for Spain…pregnant,\" was all Froderick could get out. \"Oh Froderick.\" Gwyn pressed her naked body back against him. \"Phillip didn't rape me when you were gone on your commission, did he?\" \"Nnnnh\" he murmured and she felt him shake his head. \"And how do you know that, Froderick?\" She hated to press the point, but she knew by now that his irrational nightmares required a reasoned and logical argument. \"Pregnant already,\" was all he said. \"That's right, Froderick. I was pregnant already when we were together that first night in your room.\" She took a deep breath and continued. \"Phillip didn't go with me to Canterbury. Who did, Froderick?

And who did I marry?\" she asked as she arched against him, rubbing herself against hid growing arousal. \"Me,\" he whispered as he kissed her neck softly. \"And whose baby is growing inside me?\" Gwyn slid their joined hands from her breast to her abdomen as she spoke. \"Mine,\" Froderick practically growled into her ear, causing her to shiver as he slid his hand down her belly to cup her between her legs. There was a time she would have scolded him for such possessiveness, but that was before she knew what fears lay in his heart. \"Yours, Froderick.\" She rolled over to face him and began to press gentle but insistent kisses on his face. \"I'm yours, Froderick.\" She kissed along his jaw. \"Only yours.\" She placed another kiss to the hollow of his neck, licking her way to his chin. \"Always yours.\" She met him in a deep and passionate kiss, allowing his mouth to devour hers. Gwyn grabbed the sides of Frodeick's head and forced him to meet her eyes. \"I love you ,\" she told him fiercely. \"Mine,\" he responded with equal ferocity. \"I love you,\" he declared as he ran his hands along her back to her bum and pressed against her. \"Don't let go, Froderick. Don't let me go,\" she begged as she melted into his embrace. \"Never, I'll never let go,\" he promised before rolling her onto her back and showing his wife how much he loved her. A couple of months later, Gwyn had reached the end of her pregnancy. When she went into labor, Robin, Froderick and Conrad were notified immediately. Conrad was ecstatic to behold his half-sister after the delivery. Gwyn finally decided to call her Anna. Her middle name became Marian, after her grandmother. Now the family was complete with a Prince, Princess, Heir, Deacon and Infant of Thieves.

When Mia walks into the bar with Sebastian in their fantasy world (AKA La La Land - I couldn't resist), it's clear that the bar isn't Seb's. There's a different pianist on the stage. That gave me the impression that Sebastian had given up his dreams to follow Mia - hence this little plot bunny. Enjoy! I might write more of this later. Back in LA where we met almost five years ago, Sebastian and I take a night out on the town. We left our little boy at home - it was hard to leave his curly bedhead behind, considering I don't get much time with him with all the shooting I've been doing. Still, a night out with Seb was really what I needed. And what better place than the bar he's always loved? We walk in, the blue neon lights on the wall illuminating the little entryway. My mouth twists a little. I always feel bad when visiting here, even though Seb still loves it. Something in the way his eyes crinkle bothers me… I can't help but think that I was the one who extinguished his dreams. This all could have been Seb's, or Chicken on a Stick, whatever he wanted. He gave it all up on that park bench in front of the planetarium. To be honest, I lied when I told him I felt shaky about the audition. I had a feeling that it was my big break, that I was going to get the part no matter what. I just didn't want to face that reality. I didn't want to leave the love of my life. No one ever made me feel the way Seb did, even through our horrible argument and my breakdown. It was the truth. So when he told me, without hesitation, that he'd follow me to Paris and find some little jazz hole to play in, I smiled and didn't protest. It was all I could do - the shaky, recovering artist I was back then couldn't do anything more. She was too selfish, confusing love with her own happiness. Now, I sometimes wonder if I would have still made the same choice if I could go back. Maybe I'd let Seb have his way for once - force him to have his way. I can't count the number of sleepless nights I stumbled home after grueling rehearsals in Paris to his warm arms. I wish I could repay him his selfless favors. His jazz career in Paris never flourished, unfortunately. And every time I bring up the idea of starting up again now that we're back in LA, he brushes me off and remarks that he couldn't spend the time away from our little boy. I look at him now, smiling softly as he looks up at the jazz pianist on the stage. His hand rests warmly on my thigh. I can't help but wonder if he wishes his fingers were on the keys - the same that he played so long ago. After the set, Seb's old friends come by and ask him to play a bit for some fun. I encourage him to go, but he shakes his head slightly and refuses. \"There's a little curly-haired boy we've got to get home to,\" he says with a chuckle. My heart buckles, just a little bit. Our son, my career… they're the pride reflected in Seb's eyes now, not the passion for jazz I used to love. It's difficult to watch sometimes. In the end, I just smile, hold onto his arm and let him drive us home. When we walk inside, Seb immediately heads to our son's crib and gives him a kiss. The little boy grabs onto his dad's finger, squeezing tightly. My heart aches, only a little, imagining where those fingers might've been had I been less selfish.

I doubt that anyone will ever read this, but to those who will, I raise my glass to you. Quote of the Day: Laney: When people are in love, they sing duets. Corey: It's, uh, like a rule. — Groj Band Sebastian didn't know why, but as he looked at his wife part of him felt like they belonged to another time and place. She was standing near the ocean with their son, the two of them now tired and relaxing by the shore. The day had been long, though not long enough years later when he would look back on this moment, and there was something inside of him that stirred when he saw the silhouette of his wife and son canvas against the setting sun of Los Angeles. There was always something beautiful about California, and despite all the troubles and broken dreams that he and Mia had faced in this strange and dreamlike place, California would always be his home. He had left once before when Mia had been given the chance to achieve her dream in France, but Sebastian would be lying if he said that part of him wasn't glad that they were finally back in the place where the two of them had first met. If Mia was supposed to be believed he had been charming and perhaps even a little bit enchanting with his music the first time that she had ever seen him, until he blew her off after her first words to him had been to compliment his playing. Sebastian supposed that he could laugh about it now since they had found each other in the end, but sometimes he still felt like slapping himself for being such a dick to the woman who would one day be his wife. Somehow everything in his life ended up working out, and although he knew that it was silly, for some reason there was a small part of him that had always felt like the city lights and almost non-existent stars of Los Angeles shined specifically just for Mia and himself. Almost as if she could tell that he was watching her, Mia turned in that moment to look over at where he had been silently sitting for the past ten minutes or so. Her eyes met his, like they had so many times in the years that he had known her, before Mia began to walk in his direction. As she walked towards him, Mia glanced over at their boy to make sure that he was safe where she had left him. As Sebastian watched, it wasn't hard for him to tell that Mia was torn between either finding her way back to him, or continuing to watch the horizon with her son. He almost laughed, Sebastian being able to do nothing else but smirk when his wife was finally standing before him. \"What are you thinking about?\" Mia asked as she sat beside him on the blanket that Sebastian had spent the better part of the afternoon resting on. Before he answered, Sebastian shot a quick glance over at his wife. Although they have been together for a few years now, having her stand this close to him was still something that he would never get used to. She was the most familiar thing that he had in his life, and yet at the same time she would also always be the world's greatest mystery. Sebastian wondered if that's how all marriages were, or if maybe this was something that was uniquely Mia's. \"Life mostly,\" Sebastian said after a long moment, as he spun a pencil in his hand that ten years ago would have been a cigarette, \"with a little planning here and there.\" \"I know it's not jazz,\" Mia replied, eyes never having left her son the moment that she sat down next to Sebastian, \"but how does that John Lennon song go?\" Sebastian closed his eyes as he laughed. If there was one thing that he as a married man had come to learn after all these years, it was the fact that more often than not his wife was usually right. John Lennon was no Thelonious Monk, but Sebastian could respect a great musician when he heard one. He knew the song that she was talking about, the song being a favorite of Mia's, and as he looked over at his son sitting by the ocean and watching it intently, Sebastian supposed John Lennon had had the right idea all along. Twirling his would-be cigarette once again, Sebastian shook his head, the jazz artist knowing that his wife would take this as a victory. \"Life is what happens while you're busy making other plans.\" This time Mia gave a smirk of her own, the woman knowing what Sebastian would refuse to admit out loud, even if not so deep down he already knew the truth. She nudged her husband in his side, both pairs of eyes still trained on their son. \"And what were you planning, Seb?\" it was a long time before Sebastian answered her. He almost didn't know how to put his thoughts into words, but after a moment's reflection Sebastian suppose that it was actually pretty obvious. There was something that he was hoping for when it came to the future of his family, when it came to the future of his son, and as he watched his son and the ocean on the horizon, there was a strange inkling in his soul that told him that perhaps this future wasn't so far-fetched. As he wrapped his fingers around Mia's, Sebastian couldn't help but wonder about just what it took to breathe life into the quiet hopes that one was afraid to say out loud. \"I want him to love music the same way I love it. I want him to love jazz, and be a better musician than I ever could be.\" His wife thought for a long moment, before she nodded, Mia never looking away from their son. She agreed with parts of what he said, but at the same time Sebastian could still tell that she disagreed with others. She smiled, her voice almost a whisper. \"He'll find something he loves as much, if not more, than jazz,\" Mia's words sounding almost like a song, \"maybe it will be jazz. Maybe it'll be something else. Whatever it is, he'll be a dreamer one day.\" This time, it was Sebastian who nodded. The future was something special, and the world was for their son to take. \"Here's to the fools that dream.\" Here's to my first and last La La Land story. Farewell.

Sorry for such a long time without writing, but this movie inspired me to put this little plot bunny to paper. Enjoy, and please review! (Yes, even flames welcome.) We'll Always Have Paris Sebastian feels his breath catch in his chest as his eyes catch hers; eyes that he hadn't seen in five long years. Mia – with a ring on her hand. His heart stutters. He should have known that this could have happened. After all, it had been five years since their last time together, on that park bench by the planetarium. She moved on, as did he. But that didn't stop it from hurting. The heat from the stage lights felt more like a searchlight, having finally caught him in an unexpected moment. He sees her shift under his gaze, her form tense in nervousness. He is too- his palms gripping the microphone stand like it was a lifeline. Not knowing what else to say, he quickly said the first thing that came to his mind that she would understand was for her. (\"Welcome to Seb's\" – that was the best that he could come up with? What happened to the quick witted retorts that they had exchanged so easily?) He moves slowly over to his piano, delicately placing his fingers of the ivory that had been his close companion. Sighing in resignation, he plays the only thing that he can… their song. He dares not look up at her, not when he's so engrossed in his music. He might lose his nerve and stop in the damn middle. Sebastian imagines what it might have been like, had they stayed together. What if… that eternal question. What if he hadn't been such an ass that night she stumbled into the restaurant? God, if he had known that night what they could have been, he would have kissed her and never let her go. Would things be perfect? Hell no, and they never would have been. But at least they would have had each other. In the end, they both ended up getting what they wanted. He got his club, and she got her career as an actress. But he still felt that they lost something of infinitely more worth. He can feel the song (and his fantasy) ending, and he desperately dances his fingers across the keys, trying to keep that spark of another life alive. Please, he begs, don't let it end. But he knows the answer to that even before he finishes his thought. It has ended, and you can't change the past. Best move on before any more hurt can happen. He let his fingers bring one last hopeful note out into the silent club, and then resigns himself to reality as his song ends. Life isn't a fairy tale, he notes remorsefully. You can't have that happy ending, not in this city. The stars may be glittering above, but only the lucky few reach them. Sebastian looks slowly up, his eyes searching for hers across the dark expanse separating them. He only finds an empty seat. She had gone, and he hadn't even noticed. He supposes this was how Rick felt when Ilsa walked into his bar in Casablanca. (He fondly remembers Mia pointing out the famous window ledge on the movie lot). In the end, they were always going to be separated. However, they would always cherish the time that they had together. \"We'll always have Paris,\" the oft-quoted line stated. How funny that he and Mia had theirs separating them. Sebastian prepares himself to start the next song, when he sees her standing in the door to the outside world. He stops, then smiles at her, silently thanking her for all that they had. She gives him the slightest ghost of a smile, and then leaves to join her husband. He fee;s at peace, knowing that they had that last moment that was only theirs. Now, it was time to move on. He motions to his band, striking up their next tune. \"We'll always have Paris…\" Yes, he pondered. They most certainly would.

She drove back to the place she called her home, but it felt anything but. It was a 2 story tall mansion, decked out with everything anyone could ever want due to her fortune in the acting world, but the place always felt empty to her. She would walk the empty halls every night, looking out into the sky full of stars, searching for something she no longer had. Mia decided that wasn't how she was going to spend her night tonight. She drove back into town and walked around the streets she once knew so well. As the city began to light itself up, the sign in front of her captured her attention. Seb's. It was his place. The one she named. Like a moth drawn toward a flame, she began towards it. As she got closer, music began to make its way to her ears. It was a soft tune, just enough to making you sway. When Mia opened the door, she was shocked. The place was packed, but everyone was silent. The music flooded Mia's ears. It began with a soft tune, drawing her in. As she made her way towards the front, she realized why it was so capsizing. It was her song, her's and Sebastian's. He sat upon the stage, hunched over the piano, a spotlight focused on him. His eyes were closed, his neck was bent, and his fingers danced across the white and black keys as he swayed with the music. Mia couldn't move, paralyzed by the scene. She watched as she drowned in the music. She didn't even realize the song was finished until the applause cut through the silence of the crowd. Sebastian stood up and and smiled to the crowd. His eyes swept the room, landing on hers, and all the noise in the restaurant seemed to diminish. They stood there, fixed on each other. Blue eyes staring into green and back, making Mia's heart speed up. After a moment Sebastian gave her his small trademark smile and returned his attention back to the crowd and then to his piano, continuing on his night's performance. Mia sat down at the bar and watched as he played throughout the evening. As the crowd diminished, Sebastian's songs seemed to slow, taking on the sleepiness of the night. The soft melody created a pathway for his customers to find their way home in the dark. When the last song came to a close, everyone had filed out of the restaurant. The spotlight upon Sebastian faded out and the lights in the restaurant began to take on a soft glow. After the last note had been played upon the piano, Sebastian sat straight up and looked towards the bar, finding Mia easily. Mia smiled warmly at him, stood up, and made her way over to him. They met in the middle, looking into each other's eyes. In his, Mia found the warmth and foundation she had been missing in the years they had been apart. In hers, Sebastian found the happiness and love that had been absent in his life for so long. \"Mia,\" he said, and she melted. Her face split into the most genuine smile she's had in a long time. The sound of her name on his lips brought back so many memories. \"Funny we keep bumping into each other, huh?\" she asked, the smile never ceasing. \"Yes, it definitely means something,\" he responded, taking her hand and leading her out of the restaurant. As soon as they stepped out Mia pointed at the sign above the restaurant. The sign she designed. \"I can't believe you kept my idea. How were you able to do all this? It's amazing.\" He turned around to look at the sign with her. \"I kept up with the band for the second year. After that I had enough money saved up to buy the place out and I made it my own. As for your sign, I kept the design on my nightstand. It reminded me of you.\" Their hands still intertwined, Mia stepped in front of Sebastian and looked directly into his bright blue eyes. \"You…?\" she started, but she couldn't find the words. Instead she leaned up on her toes and kissed him. It was a good, proper kiss. One filled with emotion and meaning she could not put into words. As if he registered what she was trying to tell him and understood, he let go of her hand and wrapped his arms around her waist, deepening the kiss. When they broke apart, Sebastian smiled down at her. Then his eyes darted to the side. \"Isn't this your car?\" he asked. When she nodded, he pulled back his sleeve to look at his watch. \"Well, it's pretty late. Maybe we should get going. I'm still at the same place.\" She stood frozen for just a moment at what he suggested, but then she walked over and unlocked the car. She climbed into the driver's seat, knowing the road ahead was made for both of them, and that it would take them both where they wanted to go, together. So, I never liked the way they ended the movie, so here's my version. I hope to build off of it, but due to the way I ended the chapter, don't be surprised if I don't update all that soon. Enjoy!

This is a tale of woe and fish men, except there isn't much woe and to be perfectly honest with you, this is not a world wherein fish men are especially ubiquitous, they're more of a carrot on a stick type deal to lure you in. SO, if a tale of woe isn't up your alley, then keep reading for the fish men. Although, I must reiterate that fish men probably won't appear in this chapter for the benefits of pacing and creating enigmas. When will the fish men appear? You may ask. We don't know either. For these are the mysteries. Also, I should probably establish that this is being written by someone who has seen La La Land and was very much enchanted by its ostentatious and opulent splendour. However, much of the creative input stems from someone who refuses to watch La La Land on the grounds of \"it being for pussies.\" Milton Blumquist and Monster-Mash Graveyard-Smash Chapter One We take you now to the magical city of Lost Angle-Knees, renowned for its incredibly vibrant and influential Shrimp-jazz music scene, and probably some other jazzy tap dance endeavours. It would make sense that such an effervescent environment would galvanise the growth of some equally effervescent characters. Ryan Gosling is one such jivin' duke; he's the cock of the walk; the man about town; the guy known for being a guy you'd want to know. When he's not dancing a jig down the Boulevard of Bulbous Salutations (this is both a metaphorical and absolutely literal location) he's fingering a serious C# arpeggio on his sentient foldable piano-pal; Beef Oven. So, there he is, our plucky protagonist, down enjoying an ice-cold Um-Bongo in Cathy's Cleft House , everyone's favourite quaint tea-teashop and inter-dimensional brothel. He was in a bit of a sour mood at the world, his good temperament tarnished by memories of the Great War, when all of a sudden, he was approached by a face he never thought he'd bear witness to again. The enigmatic stranger perambulated over to the quiet corner booth currently being occupied by a lachrymose Gosling, sipping contemptuously at his icy beverage, as to reflect his current outlook on life. \"Hey there old pal, you're looking glummer than a hamster in a wellington boot!\" to which Gosling, begrudgingly drew his brooding attention away from his Um-Bongo, taking every measure to make it absolutely clear that this was indeed, an emotionally taxing adjustment of limbs. However, when he gazed upon this monolith of pulchritude standing before him, Gosling shed his sour emotions and his face lit up with glee. Like a child falling down a wishing well, he was overwhelmed with exhilaration and, perhaps even a hint of fear, for this lustful titan of sweet vocal harmonies was none other than his oldest compatriot, mysteriously vanished seven summers past, and thought to be dead in seven separate dimensions. Yes indeed, it was Tolentino Carillion Knight, known to the authorities simply as Mister Knight. He grasped Gosling's hand with a grip like the crushing jaws of a manticore, leaving Gosling feeling as if he'd been hung out to dry by a housewife with big meaty gorilla hands. \"What seems to be stirring your pasta, Mr Rasta?!\" Mister Knight harnessed the power of his a-cappella quartet and spoke in the voice of four heavenly souls that Gosling could have sworn temporarily materialized behind him in a flash of light like a gun's muzzle flare. Somewhat taken aback by this esoteric display of avuncular concern, for of course Mister Knight is older than the stars, Gosling attempted to articulate a response, but could only manage \"wop.\" Mister Knight laughed in a, parental sort of way, then gracefully swept his moustachioed frame into the seat opposite Ryan. Beef-Oven, who was currently nestled under the table observed this exchange with a curious expression plastered across his keys, and released a nervous tune which roughly translated to \"Why, who is this charming fellow, sire? He's really hammering my soundboard with that mellifluous sound of his.\" Gosling COMPOSED himself (comedy – get it because he's a music man) and offered no reply to his piano-pal, instead diverting his attention to Mister Knight. Gosling then delivered a monologue so powerfully moving and ineffably heart-wrenching that it cannot be recounted by writers of our humble standing. However, the general gist is thus: Gosling is tremendously sorrowful over the recent monopolisation and unmitigated bias of music distribution which has recently been implemented by the fish lord Frootmig. This city, once a bountiful gallimaufry of contrasting eclectic music genres has now been solely defined by its rigid bailiwick of Shrimp-jazz. Gosling later expostulated that he feels ostracized by his absence of gills in a society wherein one's gills can determine one's grandiosity. Gosling ended his emotional ejaculation by expressing his desire for an expedition into musical worlds so far unexplored and achieve musical enlightenment. Mister Knight, shed a solitary, iridescent tear that trickled down his craggy features and fell to the floor where a flower grew, and was promptly engulfed by the veracious hound of the neighbouring brothel. In this moment, Mister Knight knew that he and Gosling were one and the same, their souls intertwined in an intimate dance of destiny, for the ageless mountain sage that is he, also felt a shrimp jazz related injustice, permeated by the tingling sensation on his serpentine tongue. He too knew that there was more to the world than the choruses of the crustaceans; the solos of the sea-dwellers; and the polyphonic paradiddles of the poisonous prawn people. Mister Knight didn't feel the need to say anything, for everything had already been said, so he thrust his ring encrusted hand towards Gosling and engaged in a handshake, a handshake that would be a precursor to how their lives would change forever. And so, our lion-hearted protagonist has been re-acquainted with the one man who can change their reality. Who knows what the future has in store for them because we don't. With this, Mister Knight silently stood up and left. Gosling knew what to do, for he knew that Mister Knight does not follow the codes of the normal man. Snapping his fingers to alert Beef Oven they were leaving, he placed the remainder of his shrimp currency on the table as a sign of contempt to the shrimp overlords, but also to pay for his Um-Bongo because that was the currency. Gosling stumbled out of Cathy's Cleft House into the gloomy night and found Mister Knight standing under the rose-pink glow of a magical street lamp, mournfully humming the tune to 'City of Lars (Ulrich)'. He was disdainfully glaring at the giant ivory letters up on the distant hillside, once proclaiming the proud name of this city, now spelling out the message 'FISH MEN RULE'. \"Those snake strangling scallywags! They're drunk with power as well as the fetid alcoholic ichor and mucilage they heartlessly consume\". Gosling, not quite sure how to respond to this profound double entendre, simply nodded with a \"wop\". Mister Knight, replied in a grave tone of voice \"We must find another genre, superior to that of the shrimp-jazz, only then can we be liberated from the despotic rule of the oceanic oligarchy!\" \"Yes!\" retorted the Gosling, \"Then I can truly become the music man I have always known myself to be!\" Beef Oven, feeling left out quickly composed a jubilant tinkle-tankle on his 54-key body, which probably translated to something along the lines of \"I concur wholeheartedly my amigos! Let's kill those fuck fish!\" Then proceeded to play the hit song 'Another Night of Moon' as a sign of new beginnings. And so, our heroes are sufficiently motivated to embark on a life changing musical orientated adventure of unprecedented unbelievability.

Welcome to my \"La La Land\" story! I recently watched the movie again and I wanted to write a one-shot about the ending. While I wanted Mia and Sebastian to end up together, I think it was nice that the movie was showing that sometimes people don't end up together. Life gets in the way, and I really enjoyed that. This short scene I wrote is after Mia looks back at Seb as she's walking out of the club. They definitely share a moment, so I created a scene that would follow this. I hope you enjoy! Happy reading!) Seb glances up from his piano to see Mia walking toward the exit. She turns back, and her eyes meet his. There's something flickering between them—that old spark that could light fires. They both imagine how different their lives would be if they hadn't broken up five years ago. He would have followed her to Paris for her to film her big picture. He would have worked in nightclubs, performing the best jazz music made famous by French musicians. After her film wrapped up production, they would have returned to the States and he would begin to work on opening his own nightclub, effectively called Seb's after giving in to Mia's request that \"Chicken on a Stick\" is too \"out there\" for Los Angeles. She would have continued to make films and then they would have gotten married at the Griffith Observatory. They would have their first child by now, perhaps expecting another one. Life would have been different, but maybe that was all just a dream. They were supposed to break up in order to have the lives they have now. Seb catches her eye again, and this time, he stands up from the piano. He whispers to his musicians to keep playing to entertain the guests, and then he saunters over to Mia, who is beginning to turn back to the hallway leading toward the front door of the club. \"Mia, wait,\" he says, reaching out to catch her hand in his. She turns to him, but avoids his eyes. \"I-It's good to see you again,\" he tells her, meaning every word. It is good to see her, almost too good. She hasn't changed at all—her impeccable beauty still stealing his breath away. \"I agree. It's nice to see you, Seb,\" she responds, still not looking directly at him. He turns his body to look around the club. \"Did you enjoy this place?\" She releases a breath and nods her head. \"Yeah, it's great. I knew you could do it, Seb.\" \"Same to you. I knew you had the talent. You just had to believe in yourself.\" She finally looks at him, raising her eyebrow. \"You follow my career?\" \"It's kind of hard not to when your movie poster is plastered on the side of my building,\" he says with a smile. She blushes, looking down at her heels. \"Oh. That.\" \"Hey.\" She looks up into his eyes. \"Don't be embarrassed.\" \"Who says I'm embarrassed?\" she asks. \"Your eyes.\" Her eyes burn into his. He takes one step toward her, but she lets go of his hand. She runs her fingers through her auburn hair, and turns back to her husband, who calls to her from the door. \"I guess that's my cue,\" she says. \"I guess so,\" he echoes. He glances back at her and smiles. \"It really was nice to see you.\" \"Of course. It looks like you got everything you wanted, Seb,\" she says. \"Almost,\" he whispers. Her eyes dance up to his, realizing what he means. She turns back to the hallway and nods her head. \"Well, goodbye, Seb. Congratulations on your club,\" she says as she begins to walk away. \"Goodbye, Mia,\" he whispers, watching her walk away. Her husband wraps his arms around her waist, opening the door for her. She turns back and looks at Seb—one last time. He raises his hand in a wave, and she smiles before walking out into the Los Angeles heat. He turns back to the club and approaches the stage, humming a familiar tune. City of stars, are you shining just for me? A/N: I hope you enjoyed this one-shot of Sebastian and Mia.

I was extremely distraught, and actually cried. Me. I cried . That's huge, people. This starts after the Movie Marker 5 years later . 5 years later... Mia's insanely high heels clacked loudly against the pavement as she strode toward her favorite coffee shop. It was a building that held millions of memories for her, much like the rest of this city. Memories of searching after her dream, a working her butt of serving rude customers, of experiencing the jazz she truly liked. Of- Don't think his name . Mia cut her thoughts off roughly. She approached the counter at an even faster pace. \"Medium decaf, please.\" The cashier gave her a wide eye, wondering look. Mia wondered for a moment what dreams this young girl had bubbling up inside of her as she served coffees and kept up a polite smile. Don't give up on you're dreams. She thought, giving the girl a smile. They might come true. Another server, this one a man, set a coffee down in front of her with a flattering smile. \"On the house.\" He said. \"Don't be ridiculous.\" Mia laughed, shaking her head and handing him money. She made sure to place a generous tip in the cashier's jar, and, smiling at the girl's breathed, \"Thank you...\", walked out the door toward her waiting golf cart. Mia sipped her coffee as they drove. It had been a year and three months since she had gotten back to L.A. Now, whenever she walked the streets, she saw wide eyed stares, heard excited whispers, and realized time and time again that she was no longer the same hopeful barista that she used to be. She was an actress. She was famous . She was still alone. Mia shook herself, cutting her thoughts off yet again. That kind of thinking always led to the same person, the same person who had haunted her dreams for 5 years, someone she knew was forever going to be out of reach. Seb- Don't. \"I'm home!\" Mia yelled, as loudly as possible, into her silent mansion. She had moved all over the world during her time as a big-name actress. Every place she went, she had the same though. Maybe this will be better. Maybe here will be home. It never was. Slurping up the last dregs of her coffee, Mia tossed the cup in the trash, and slipped off her heals. She pulled on familiar black flats, instead, blocking memories the whole time. The shoes were so worn they almost had holes, but Mia couldn't bare to give them up. They, like the city, like the coffee shop, had too many inlaid memories for her to let go. She had worn these shoes the day she had her callback audition, the day- when he- The day she had her callback audition. Three hours later, Mia was in her room, pulling on more suitable evening wear and curling her hair. There was some sort of party tonight, one that she didn't really care to go to, but would probably be good for the media or something. It wasn't like she really had anything occupying her evenings, anymore. Finding that the 4 time she had almost thought of him , Mia roughly tore off her flats and pulled back on her uncomfortable heals. She got into her car, still a Prius (wouldn't buy anything else), and pulled out of the driveway. Once she was on the highway, the traffic slowed to a near stop. Mia bounced her forehead lightly against the steering wheel. \"I did not miss this.\" She muttered to herself. It was more that, once again , this brought back to many deep set, painful memories. Traffic... honking horns... Se- No. No, no, no, NO! Mia gripped her steering wheel so tightly her knuckles went white. She had to get out of here. Making a spit second decision, Mia flicked on her blinker and yanked her car off the highway. The traffic cleared up almost immediately as she sped along a now quiet road. She would just park somewhere, get dinner, forget about the party, forget about him. Like that was possible. Mia strode down the street until she came to a restaurant that caught her eye (and stomach). There was bobby, playful jazz and the sound of voices pouring out through the colorful door. That, and the delicious smells of food, was enough to pull her in. As she turned the corner to get into the restaurant, Mia looked up to see what the place was called, not having noticed the name outside. Her heart froze in her chest. Seb's . It had to be a coincidence. There was no way- It couldn't be- But at the same time, it couldn't not be him. Mia's eyes filled up as she saw the apostrophe turned into a music note, the bright circle surrounding the word cutting off a few letters. It was so familiar . It was her design . It had to be him. Mia walked slowly into the building, wanting to scream, wanting to run, wanting to cry, but at the same time, wanting to jump for joy. He had gotten it. He had gotten his dream. They both had. Except they didn't get each other . A waitress handed her a cocktail, and Mia took it with numb fingertips, falling into a seat as she scanned the band. It was his band. So where was he? And then she saw him. He looked no different then when she had left. His broad shouldered posture was hunched over the piano, clad in a black suit. His blond hair was neatly combed, a few strands falling into his intensely concentrating face. He hadn't changed. But what if he has ? Mia though, her entire body going cold. What if he had changed? For all she knew, he had a life, a girlfriend, a wife , and she wasn't allowed to just crawl back into it after all these years. How could she handle that? The song ended, and the audience burst into applause. Mia couldn't move, even when an annoyed waitress asked her what she would like to eat. Sebastian stood and introduced the band. Then his eyes fell on her. He opened and closed his mouth a few times, unable to concentrate on what he had been about to say. Mia stared right back, tears still burning in her eyes, because the memories were surrounding her. There was no going back from this. \"Welcome to Seb's.\" Sebastian muttered into the mic, all animation gone as he took a seat at the main piano. Then he started to play, and Mia started to cry. It was their song. The one that he had played a million times before, seated at the piano in her apartment. The song that she had heard him play when she first met him. The song that he had taught himself, using a small record player. The song that he loved more then any other that he had ever played. The song that had made her fall in love with him. The audience exploded as he stood and took a bow, but once Mia had blinked out of her trance, he was gone. She panicked, suddenly. How was she supposed to cope if she didn't see him again. What if that was it? What if he had left, unable to talk with her? What it- A hand rested on her shoulder, and Mia whipped around. Her eyes shot up to blue ones, and her heart stuttered. \"Seb- Sebas-\" \"Hi.\" Sebastian breathed. He was so close she could touch him- so close she was, his hand still resting gently on her bare shoulder. \"Hi...\" Mia breathed back. She couldn't make any other words come out. She couldn't even blink . \"Funny how we keep running into each other.\" The response came out of her mouth before Mia could stop herself. It had been a conversation that had kept her company every dark, lonely night when she couldn't stop thinking about Sebastian's arms around her. When she couldn't fight the memories in the dark and they would rip at her heart until she ached from the inside out. \"Wonder if it means something?\" He pulled her up and hugged her, so tight it almost hurt. What he said next was so quiet she almost didn't hear it. \"Probably.\" Author's Note: That is so much better, in my opinion. TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK PLEASE!

Either they were anything but reliable, bailing on you at last minute to an attend an audition. Or they were TOO good, meaning that when you really needed them, they were already booked up for the night. On the one night you needed them as well... Mia had had a last minute call from one of her favourite casting agents, who was in town for just one night. This proposed movie was going to big, a potential award-winner if the writer's history was anything to go by. But David was out of town, visiting his sister in Albuquerque who was going through a nasty divorce. So Mia, to put it lightly, was kind of screwed. Strutting through her living room on her high heels, she aggressively plumped one of her sofa pillows in frustration, as Ella played on the floor nearby with her stuffed rabbit and some building blocks. \"You ok baby?\" she asked the tiny toddler. Ella gave a giggle, babbling happily. \"Yea' Mommy.\" Mia wrinkled her nose, so in love, turning away…. just as there came a sudden knock on the front door. She looked up. She wasn't expecting anyone, not at this time on a Friday evening anyway. Mia, blinked a couple of times, before moving over to the front door and hurling it open. But she stopped wide eyed as she took in the person stood on the doorstep...jacket thrown casually over his shoulder. \"Seb?\" she said in what was almost a whisper. What was he doing here? After all this time. She had seen him two months ago in his bar...for the first time in five whole years. And even that had brought back memories. But now, with him standing here...mere inches away from her...it was like an entire lifetime had come flooding back. He gave her a sad sort of grin. \"Hey Mia,\" he murmured. She stopped, her breath catching in her throat. This wasn't love anymore, this was something else...a sort of yearning for a life that could have been... But she was happy now. Happier now than she'd ever been before. And so was Seb by the looks of him. He was handsome, healthy and tanned. Somehow perkier than he had been all those years ago. \"W-What are you doing here?\" she managed to stutter. But he gave an easy sigh, continuing with that soft smile of his. \"Just thought I'd look you up...\" he said glancing up at her porch. \"It's been a while, right?\" Mia chuckled involuntarily. \"It's been five years,\" she said in a slow voice. \"Really? Five years? Has it actually been that long?\" said Seb shaking his head. Mia nodded, giving him a smile. \"Mmmhmmm,\" she said, placing a hand to her hip. \"Five years And you're STILL wearing that polyester suit?\" Seb gave her a playful frown plucking at his pants. \"I'll have you know that this is wool,\" he retorted, as Mia gave a laugh. His face brightened at the sound. There were some good memories there in that laugh... Her eyes traveled over his face. That same old stupid face... \"You wanna come in?\" She asked in a gentle voice, stepping aside. Maybe this was a bad idea, but it was too late now. Seb even looked at her a little tentatively for a second, before giving a nod and sliding past her. \"This is a nice place,\" he uttered glancing around casually. \"Your husband must be rich.\" Mia smirked, folding her arms across her chest. \"Actually I'm the rich one…David's just my sweet piece of arm-candy,\" she said in a playful tone. Seb glanced at her for a moment smirking back, before tearing his eyes away and stepping a little further into the room. But he stopped suddenly in his tracks as his eyes suddenly landed on Ella, still sat on the rug, playing happily. For a moment he didn't move, merely stood there staring at the teeny toddler. But before Mia could speak to fill the long silence, Seb had swept over to Ella, his face full of utter joy. \"Well, who is this gorgeous girl?\" he said in a sweet voice, as the tiny child looked up at him, her mouth hanging open. Seb, flinging his jacket over the side of the couch without asking, crouched down beside Ella giving her a wide grin. Mia smiled to herself, watching the pair of them. \"You wanna say hi, baby?\" she said in a kindly voice, gazing at her two year old daughter. Ella seemed to pause for a second before listening to her Mom and giving a small wave. \"Hai,\" she uttered in a quiet voice, suddenly coming over all shy. At this, Seb seemed to melt. \"Her name's Ella,\" said Mia, lifting a hand to her neck self-consciously. \"And she turned two just last week. Didn't you sweetie?\" But Ella was no longer paying attention. Instead her focus was on Seb as he began to help her build a small tower out of brightly coloured building blocks. \"You think this should go there?\" Mia her heard him ask the tiny girl. \"Make it look like a castle fit for a princess?\" Ella giggled giving a nod. \"Yea'!\" \"Yeah!\" repeated Seb happily. Mia chuckled. \"You're a natural with her,\" she commented, taking a step towards the pair as Seb settled himself more comfortably on the rug beside the toddler. The pianist flashed her a grin. \"Well...\" he said cheerily. \"...if you're ever looking for a sitter-\" Thanks for reading.

Disclaimer: the author doesn't own the characters No longer a princess Gwen sat on the bench looking up at the stars. She missed Philip but knewrnthat in three days, she would be able to see him again. For the last three yearsrnshe and her father, Robin Hood, had been in France. Today they would return tornNottingham and then to the palace in London. She could barely sit still. \"What's bothering you child?\" William asked, sitting next to her.rnWilliam was her father's best friend and on all the trips Robin Hood took,rnWilliam came too. \"Philip\" she answered plainly. But William could tell she wouldrnhiding emotions behind her words. For three years they have been apart andrnthough Gwen lived each day fully, she always seemed distant. \"I don't wantrnto be a spinster when I become too old to ride and fight, but I can't give up onrnhim.\" Now he understood. She wanted to marry, to have a family, to teachrnher children and have them ride with her like she rides with her father, butrnPhilip is the king. The two of them had long before resolved that theirrnrelationship will go no farther than friendship. Meaning, she would marryrnsomeone else. \"Gwen, you should talk to your father about this.\" William finallyrnsaid gently. She nodded. The next day the group arrived at Nottingham. They were greeted by manyrnvillagers. Since Prince John was captured and stripped of his title, the arearnhas become more peaceful. Gwen found no comfort in her home, instead she wishedrnthat life wasn't so complicated. Many of the friends she grew up with, girls andrnboys, have married and some already have babies. All of them looked so happy andrntheir lives seemed complete in a way Gwen's life wasn't. That night she met withrnher father and spoke to him about her problem. \"Gwen, my dear, I don't know what to say. I also would love to haverngrandchildren and a big family. You and Philip are meant for each other. Yourrnmother was a noble and I was only a commoner, but we managed to find love.rnTitles mean nothing. You have to abilities to be a great queen and a greatrnmother.\" her father finally said after Gwen told him everything. \"Butrnfollow your heart.\" The next day passed peacefully. Edward showed up that day. He had also beenrnout of the country in France, though a different part. Together the old friendsrnshared many memories and spoke together the entire evening. She found out thatrnEdward was going to be married to a Frenchwoman in the spring and had returnedrnto tell the town. Even Edward found someone that he could share a life with, butrnnot she, she couldn't share a life with Philip. Everywhere she looked she sawrnmarried people, it consumed her mind until everything she thought about leadrnback to Philip. When the third day came, the day she was to meet him again, shernwas shaking. In her heart she longed to see him, but her mind knew that when sherndid, she could never go away again. \"....and I present the King of England, His royal Majesty, KINGrnPHILIP.\" the announcer called over the thunder of applause. It seemed thatrnin the last three years, with Gwen gone, the girls of the country have beenrnswarming over Philip. At this dinner, many young maidens attended. All battingrntheir eyes at the king and flitting with him when given the chance. He sat atrnthe head of the table, of course, with Gwen's father on the right, and Gwen nextrnto her father. So far, she was lucky and had been able to avoid looking at him,rnthough it became harder and harder as she heard his voice more. When she thoughtrnthat she was going to burst, the musicians started to play music and couplesrnwent on the floor to dance. Finally she couldn't stand it anymore. She walkedrnover to his chair and was about to ask him to dance when she noticed he wasn'trnthere. She frantically looked around the room, making sure he wasn't dancingrnwith someone when she noticed someone leaving the room. Quickly she walked out of the dining hall, unnoticed by all but her father,rnwho hid his smile under his hand. She followed the person in front of her, halfrnconvinced it was Philip and half thinking she was mentally insane, not noticingrnshe was following him down many stairs. Finally, the figure turned a corner andrnas she followed someone grabbed her arms and slammed her against the wall. \"Well, if it isn't the princess of thieves. I wonder what she's doingrnhere.\" the man who grabbed her sneered. As he dragged her into therntorchlight she saw that he wasn't Philip. She wasn't sure who he was, onlyrnknowing from his voice that he wasn't going to be nice and let her go. Insteadrnhe half dragged her into a small room far below the earth. Normally she would bernfighting him, but the effect the food at the dinning hall was making herrnunusually tired. The room was dry and surprisingly well light and comfortable. Many torchesrnhung on the walls and the room was filled like a common room would be, withrnchairs and mats. It seemed like a place a group of people would meet in. WhenrnGwen realized this her heart sank. First Philip was gone and now she's in a roomrnwhere a gang meets. The man who brought her here was leaning against thernopposite wall studying her. He looked young and resembled the boys that some ofrnthe girls in her town/village would flirt with. \"The door's open.\" She said plainly, trying to stay wake. \"I know. But you aren't going to leave yet.\" He answered just asrnplainly, sounding very different than before. \"You act as if you have known me for years.\" She repliedrndefensively. How could a boy she never saw before know how she would act. \"Perhaps I have. The Dark Riders know much about you and yourrnfather.\" He retorted walking closer to her. She become aware that she nornlonger felt tired. Instead she felt ready to fight as adrenaline reached throughrnher. The Dark Riders, they are the largest and strongest undercover group inrnEurope. What are they doing in England? I heard most of their jobs were inrnSpain. She mused. Even Father hasn't been able to track even ONE of their people. I can't believe I have one of them in front of me. If I couldrnover power him...... and her thoughts ended as she fell onto the ground. Thernsleeping drought put into her soup had taken affect. Just as she was going tornhit the ground, the young man caught her and placed her on one of the seats. \"Buen* trabajo * \" a voice hissed as a black cloaked humanrnwalked into the room. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ * Good job* Spanish- I think that's right. I'm not really good at Spanish. Well??? LIKE IT??? ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~[Chapter 2] Disclaimer: the author doesn't own the characters No longer a princess Gwenrnwoke up with only slight headache. The first thing she noticed was she lay on arnbed made of down, not straw as she was accustomed to. Looking around her, shernpicked up only a few hints of light coming through cracks above her. From allrnthe years on the road, she could easily tell the time was day. As her eyesrnadjusted to the little light, she noticed the room she was in was small and heldrnmany other objects, pots and pans, some bags of flour, and so forth. She wasrnonly being in the room. Finally her eyes turned back to the lights in thernceiling, at least what she thought was the ceiling. When she realized what wasrnabove her was actually a heavy cloth, the entire room bounced causing to pots tornclang. Suddenly,rnthe present came to her. She was in a wagon riding on a very smooth road. Gwenrnsighed and laid back down. The past came back to her in a swarm. She recalledrnthe boy and the party. She wondered what was happening. What happened doesn'trnmatter. All that matters is that I get back. What about the Dark Riders?rnThey wouldn't just leave me here in the back unguarded. Would they? Well I'mrngoing to try to leave. They may have thought they know all about me and Father,rnbut they're wrong. Shernstood up slowly and walked slowly to the end of the carriage. Well, she tried tornwalk. Now I know why they didn't leave a guard with me. I can't get anywherernwith these chains around my ankles. Stumped about this new, and veryrnunwelcome, turn, she sat on one of the barrels. After bouncing on more rocks,rnGwen became more and more angry at herself and her situation. She kicked herrnchains making a loud noise. The entire carriage halted to a stop. Gwen's musclesrntensed. Some low muttering was held from the front. She shielded her eyes asrnsomeone opened the back curtain. \"Well,rnit was time to stop anyways.\" The person called to her much too happily. \"Yournagain.\" She replied narrowing her eyes when they became used to thernlight. \"Yes,rnit's me. Come on out. You've been asleep for... how long was it? Oh yes, about 2rndays now. That sleeping potion was very effective, maybe a bit too much.rnAnyways, it's nearly noon.\" He cheerfully ushered her out as he undid herrnchains. Outside she noticed the road was narrow but very even. Surrounding thernthin road were so many trees she couldn't see the end of the large wood. Afterrnshe fully absorbed her surroundings, she noticed that the boy stood too close tornher. Quickly, she backed away, right into someone else. This someone else wasrnstill robed in black and looked at her with menacing eyes. \"Whatrndo you want with me?\" she asked ready to run. \"Thatrnyou will find in time. Also, you are now in the outskirts of Ireland. You don'trnknow these forests. Don't try to run. Besides, one can never tell what lurks inrnthe dark woods of this land.\" the boy said as he brought some food. Shernaccepted what was handed to her and ate the dry bread in silence, listening tornthe others talking quietly in a language she didn't understand. Finally theyrnreturned to the wagon. Over the next day, she spoke to the boy, though he rarelyrnanswered her questions directly. She was able to learn his name was Miguel. Hernwas raised in Spain, though he was English by birth. He never told her why shernwas taken, only that she and her father had been watched from a long time now.rnHe didn't say much about his own life or the Dark Riders. Thernnight of next day, they reached a small town. Miguel took her through some darkrnlanes and eventually to a dark house. She tried to run, but the rope around herrnwrists and neck were very affective. She was roughly handed over to anotherrnrobed man, this one in dark blue. With a short farewell and a bright smile,rnMiguel left. Shernwas handed from person to person like this for the next few weeks. Eachrn\"owner\" was less gentle than the last one. Soon she found herselfrnwishing she could see Miguel again. After 4 people, she was brought to Spain.rnFinally, her last \"master\" undid her blindfold and pushed her into arnroom. Unlike her last few rooms, one being the bottom of a boat, this room wasrnvery bright, complete with warm bath ready for her. She sighed as she steppedrninto the warm waters. Though none of the robed ones had hurt her, none of themrntalked to her. They brought her only enough food and left her alone the rest ofrnthe time. None of my questions have been answered. Okay fine. Two of myrnquestions has been. My question about why I've been handed from person to personrnhas been. But that answer is easy- To keep people from tracking me. Also, thatrnguy was able to tell me I'm in Spain. Which isn't good at all. Father will neverrnfind me. Her thoughts drifted off and snapped about when the doors opened. Arngirl, about half Gwen's age, entered. \"Hello.rnI'm Sofia.\" the small brunette said as she curtsied. Sofia brought somernoils and helped Gwen wash up. \"Irndidn't expect anyone here to speak English.\" Gwen stated as she climbedrninto the bed. \"I'mrnyour lady-in-waiting. But you will need to learn Spanish my lady.\" Sofiarnsaid. \"Lady-in-waiting?\"rnGwen asked puzzled. \"Yes.rnEvery queen needs one. The king will go crazy if his wife doesn't have arnlady-in-waiting.\" the pre-teen answered giggling. Slowly, Sofia gave Gwenrnthe answers she wanted. So... They want me to be their queen. Queen of thernDark Riders. They must be crazy. Why would they want me? I don't know any ofrntheir customs. True, Father taught me well, but they must have another girl torndo the job. \"Anyways,rnthe Dark Riders aren't as bad as you think. I grew up in this place. It's justrnlike any life...\" Sofia kept going on. At long last Sofia left and Gwenrnwent to bed. According to Sofia, and all she said, the Dark Riders are justrnlike the Merry Men. Still, I need to leave soon. I can't live here, not as arnwife to some insane king. And with that last thought, she fell asleep. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Um..............rnwell that was a long time. sorry I didn't post. Hope you like it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!rnplease review! the button is right there!!!!!!!!!![Chapter 3] ONE MONTH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I can't believe I've been here for ONE MONTHrnand not a SINGLE opportunity to escape with. These Dark Riders are much betterrnat this than I can bring myself to believe. Everywhere I go there are guards. Irncan't get any privacy. Nothing. Curse them. True their land is beautiful. No one in England would believernthat the Dark Riders have headquarters in the caves of a waterfall. It may bernnice to waking up to the sound of water rushing, but Spanish is much harder tornlearn then I thought. Luckily Sophia is here. Otherwise I would have lost myrnmind long ago. At least they let me visit the nearby fort every week, though guards comernwith me of course. The peasants seem to know that the Dark Riders live at thernwaterfall, though none of them are foolish enough to wander in. The nobles seemrnto just overlook the facts, so much like Prince John. The performers are betterrnhere than back at Nottingham. That may be because I'm too used to the jugglersrnback home. Oh Father, it's been a month. Are you looking for me? No one here haven'trntold me anything about you. They seem to want for me to forget about England.rnFat chance. I would give anything to be back. Today more than ever. I just metrntheir king. I thought he would be like Philip was, young and bold. Instead, Irnfaced a middle-aged man with two previous wives. According to what Sophia toldrnme, his first wife was a born Dark Rider. She died giving birth to her firstrnchild, who later died from an illness. The second wife was her sister, who wasrnkilled because she was sleeping with another man. Both those women werernfighters, like me. They were both skilled at swords, but no unmarried woman wasrnleft that could be a suitable wife. So they found me. They think I will make arngood queen after all the training I've been though. I confess that I stayed this long not because I couldn't find a way tornleave but because maybe, deep down, I wanted to know what the King was like. Butrnnow I know I'm leaving. One way or another. Father, I'm coming home. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Well that was fun. that was all Gwen's PofV. Also I don't know if that wasrnconfusing. if it was tell me in a review Kitera-Matar: Thanks for everything. hope like this chapter too. Hope you will tell yourrnfriend Nicoletta: THANKS!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm glad you like it.[Chapter 4] Author's note: I felt that the last chapter was very...confusing. So Irndecided to make everything a little clearer. Disclaimer: The author doesn't own any of the character (except that ones shernmade up). But she does own the Dark Riders. No Longer a Princess Chapter 4: Details about the storyline The Dark Riders : A Spanish undercover group. They are thernlargest but most well hidden group of their type in Europe. There are 4rn\"headquarters\" one in Ireland (Gwen was there), one in France, and twornin Spain (one near the Atlantic coast, the other by the Mediterranean Sea). Thernlargest grouping of Dark Riders are in the caves of a waterfall by thernMediterranean, with about 500 men. The other headquarters have about 300 menrneach. Very few Riders live outside of these headquaters. The main focus of the group is to undermine the government andrnlive in their own world. They only involve \"outsiders\" when absolutelyrnnecessary (as in Gwen's case). Not one of them have been captured. Theyrnlive off of their own cunning and skills. Various rumors make these people soundrnworse then they are. True they steal, but only jewels and gold. They hunt theirrnown food and farm their crops. Women are trained to fight and defend the area when the men arernout hunting. But they are still treated under men. Children are consideredrnadults when they can live on their own. All the boys are trained to be fightersrnof the cause; all girls are trained to be wives and mothers (except the queen).rnTo be a noble, one has to earn the privilege, instead of by birth. Noblesrnare treated nearly the same as commoners. The King of the Dark Riders isrncurrently King Howard. He leads the men, while the queen leads the women. He isrnabout 29 years old (middle-aged for that time). And he had two wives before (onernafter the other died). But of the 5 children (1 with one wife, 4 with thernother), three died of illness, one died at birth, and the last one was killedrnwhen hunting. So they are left without a heir. Gwen was brought into the kingdom because of the lack of queen.rnHer main skill is archery, while the other queens were skilled in swords. Most locals know of where these people live, but they turn thernother cheek because no one wants to try to capture these people. Capital of the Riders : Is in the caves a of waterfall,rnand the surrounding area. Inside the caves are the storage, and where the royalrnfamily and the nobles live. The surrounding area is like any village, with huts.rnSome area is kept clear in the caves, so when under-attack, the people can hide.rnEverything is kept very intricate, the area is made so that under any type ofrnattack, there is a defense. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Hopefully, that cleared up anything. I'm going to update againrnthis week and add something that's actually a chapter. I normally updated onrnbreaks (right now is mid-winter). The last chapter (the one with Gwen thinking)rnwas what goes on in her mind. She wasn't writing or anything like that. I didn'trnknow how else to tackle it. Now for the reviews: Kitera-Matar : I love how you keep posting every chapter.rnIt helps me keep going, knowing that someone likes it so much they keeprnreading. Tigress-of-Shang : I'm not sure I want Philip to save thernday, but I don't like Philip that much. He's too much of an unoriginalrncharacter. Actually, except of the ending, the whole movie was predicable.rnAnyways, I want to make it that Gwen realizes...WAIT!...I can't tell you what'srngoing to happen. ^_^ Keeli : I'm glad you like it. I'm not sure about romance.rnI've read lots of romance fanfics, but actually writing it...I'm not sure *yet*.rnAlso, about that about that website, I found some with pictures, but they werernmainly reviews. But nothing that you would be looking for. SORRY! Elizabeth Martin : I was afraid that Gwen's character wasrnchanging too much from the original in the movie. (I don't own the movie, it'srnmy friend's, I just watched it once about 2 months ago.) But it's good to knowrnthat it's not happening.[Chapter 5] I'm really sorry that I haven't posted any chapters because I really don't rnknow how to continue the story. I'm having a bit of the a writer's block and the rnfact that the last time I saw the movie was last year doesn't help. Until I see the movie again or get some sort of motivation I'm leaving the rnfic as is for a while. Hopefully, but spring break (3 weeks) I will know what to rnwrite. Thanks to Kitera-Matar for reviewing. I love how you give me good rnadvice w/o being offensive. THANKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Please bear with me for the time. I'll try all the blockbusters in my area to rnfind the tape!!!!!!!!!!!!! ~Girl of Grace P.S. Keeli - I updated to respond to your review. I have to WHOLE plot rnready in my mind, but the problem is I don't know how to write it. rnAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ","Summary":" *****Kristen thanks for your review.

Okay you don't have to bennice, but you should be, unless I've dissed on your work then younare totally aloud. Chapter one: Her horse is falteringnunder her, but she can't stop she has to get to the king and wornnhim. She has been riding hard for many days and she knows she willnnot be able to make it if her horse goes lame, but still she pushesnhim. She whispers in his ear \"Come on boy just a bit further, thennyou can rest.\" And on they go. When they reach thencastle however all she can get out to the guard is \"King. Danger\"nbefore falling into blessed unconscious. She falls from her sweating,nweary horse as a crowed gathers round and one of the guards runs offnto get King Philip. He would want to know about Robin Hood'sndaughter and her condition wile the captain will want to know aboutnthe danger. The king had beennworking on several official documents all morning, and had gone tonday dreaming about Gwyn and what she was doing at that moment, andnwhat she and he would be doing at this moment if he were with herninstead of cooped up in this stuffy castle. Just then a guard camenbursting in, \"Your Majesty, Lady Gwyn has just arrived in quite anstate. She fell from her horse right after she told us you were inndanger. She is being brought to the guest chambers know and thendoctor has already been summand. Philip was on his feetnimmediately, and was rushing to the guest chambers. Oh no what'snwrong with Gwyn is all he could think of he totally ignored the partnabout the danger. In fact he was planning to inflict great pain onnwho ever had had the audacity to hurt his Gwyn. (A.N. I know I'mnsuch a hopeless romantic) Unfortunately, thencastle was very big and the guest chambers were on the other side ofnit, and there were constantly people getting in his way and askingnhim unimportant and stupid questions. So it took a wile for him tonget there, and when he finally did the doctor was just leaving Gwyn'snroom. \"Well, is she alrigh? What's wrong with her? Is she goingnto live? Did she tell you who did this to her?\" Philip said all innone breathe. To which the doctornanswered \"Yes, she's going to be alright. Its just exhaustion. Nonshe did not tell me who did this to her, because she is still asleep.nNow take a deep breath, is there any thing else you wish to know yournmajesty?\" \"Yes there is onenmore thing. Can I see her now?\" \"Yes you may, but donnot wake her, she needs a lot of rest. If you promise not to do thatnyou may see her.\" \"Yes I promise,nthank you doctor.\" And with that he disappeared into the room. Hensat on the edge of the bed and softly brushed some stray hair out ofnher face saying \" You should know better then to do this, and ifnyou do not get better soon, I will never forgive you\" with that henkissed her on the forehead and lay down next to her softly. He laynthere content until he also fell asleep. Mean wile outside thenroom………. \"Make sure they arennot disturbed by anyone and tell the council and the court that thenking will be unavailable for the rest of the day. And if I hear anyngossip about this I will know who to blame for it, but I trust yournloyalty.\" Sated the doctor wile looking suspiciously at the guards. \"Yes sir\" theynsaid together and saluted, then two went and stood by the door, wilenthe other went to relay the message. Satisfied the doctornwalked off thinking I hope prince John is not back, that would benvery bad[Chapter 2] Disclaimer: I do notnown Princess of Thieves, or any of the characters. (Sheesh this couldnget really annoying) AN: I would like tonsay I'm sorry for the spelling errors in my last chapter. Sorry, Inwas writing it at 11 o'clock at night, and plus my spelling isn'tnvery good to begin with. But I will try and have one of those peoplenwho can spell look over my chapters before I post them. And thanksnfor pointing it out to me KeitaWolf ,nand thanks for the complement. Chapter 2 Itnwas early in the morning the next day, and Gwyn was just stirringnform a deep sleep. She was tired though and didn't want to get outnof bed quite yet, so she snuggled up to the warm body next to her.nWait, warm body? Instantly she was out of bed and standing with onlyna night shirt on. This woke up Philip, who sat up and asked \"Whyndid you have to wake me up to? I was having a very pleasant dream.\"nHe yawned and started to get up, and then noticed that Gwyn was anlittle wobbly on her feet. \"Besides you shouldn't even be up.nHere let me help you back to bed.\" He went to her to help her, butnwas pushed away. \"Nonthat's alright,\" she said, \"I'll be fine.\" She started tonwalk towards the wardrobe, but didn't quite make it. She trippednover the rug by the bed and would have landed face down on the floornif Philip hadn't been close and caught her. \"See,nyou are in no condition to be out of bed yet,\" he said wile liftingnher up (to her annoyance) and putting her on the bed. \"Now justnwait here and I will go fetch the doctor. But you have to promise tonstay. Promise?\" Philip asked wile mock glairing at her. \"Yes,nI promise, but you must also bring your captain of the guard andnFroedrick. You all need to hear what I have to say. My father shouldnbe coming soon so you should also leave a message for him, on were tonfind me.\" \"Isnthat it?\" asked Phillip sarcastically \"Yes, for now that'snit\" Gwyn said with a slight smile \"Your wish is myncommand.\" \"Good answer\" \"Inshall return\" Philip said and he left the room. Then when the doornwas shut he said to the guards, \"No one is to enter or leave thisnroom, until I return. Is that clear?\" \"Yes your majesty,nit is crystal clear,\" Stated the guard on the right. \"Goodnthen I shall be back. Oh and, have some food sent up, I missed dinnernand I don't intend to miss breakfast. And Gwyn should eat somethingnas well,\" Philip ordered the guards before walking off in search ofnthe doctor and the captain. Mean wile back onnthe road……….. \"I hope Gwyn made itnto the palace alright,\" stated Will looking at Robin guiltily. \"Infeel really bad about letting her make such a trip so fast, but shenwas the only one young enough to make that trip without to muchndamage.\" \"Yes,nbut we must also make haste, because the king will also want thendetails of Prince Johns plan. And we must see if she made it to thenpalace alright,\" said Robin as he kicked his horse into a trot. They arrived at thenpalace soon after, and were directed to the guest quarters. Therenthey found Gwyn lying in bed with the king sitting in a chair next tonher with the captain of the guard behind him, wile an older man theynassumed was a doctor examining Gwyn. \"What's wrong withnyou girl?\" asked Will, wile Robin went over to hug his daughter. \"Nothing, theirnfussing over me for no reason,\" Gwyn stated looking quite annoyed. \"Nonit is not for no reason, you are suffering from exhaustion andndehydration\" said the doctor who was also looking annoyed. (AN: Inknow they didn't have those words back then, but I couldn't thinknof anything else to use) Justnthen the captain of the guard, Laurence, cleared his throat. Everyonenturned towards him, \"If you don't mind I would like to hear aboutnthe danger that supposedly, by king is in?\" \"Oh,nGwyn you haven't told them yet? Then what was the point ofnexhausting your self to get here early?\" asked Robin. \"I didn't thinknyou could move as fast as you did,\" Gwen paused before saying, \"oldnman,\" she said with an evil grin. Everyone else in the room wasntrying to hide their grin. \"Inwill get you back for that latter, little girl. But first we mustnrelay our news,\" said Robin wile slightly glaring at his offspring.n\"It all began wile in a tavern.\"[Chapter 3] Disclaimer: I do notnown Princess of thieves or anything of the characters. But I do ownnall the other stuff, so don't you go stealin' from me. I willnhunt you down and take it back. No just kiddin. Hope you like thisnchapter. AN: Special thanksnto Appollina and Aria Vanyel for their help on some things, andnlistening to me think out loud. Chapter 3… \"What do you meannthere's a spy?\" The captain and Philip said together. \"Well it seems henwas left here when Prince John escaped, and has been gatheringninformation for him and the sheriff all this time,\" Robin explainednlooking very serious. \"That makes a lot ofnpossibilities. I don't even know were to begin,\" said the captainnwith a frown. \"The castle still has most of the original staff. Innfact the only new people are a new cook and myself.\" \"Well,\" Robinncontinued, \"it seems our dear prince is planning to attach at thenChristmas feast.\" \"Well that gives anlot of time to plan how to stop him and bring him to justice once andnfor all,\" stated Philip determinedly, \"considering its now onlynSeptember.\" \"Yes it does yournmajesty,\" agreed the captain, \"now if you will excuse me I havenplans to make,\" he said as he bowed and walked out the door. \"Come on Will, wenshould go to. Good day to you your majesty. And please take care ofnthat daughter of mine,\" said Robin with a smile. \"Do not worry sir,nshe'll be well taken care off,\" said the king with a smile of hisnown as Robin and Will left. Gwen didn't carenwhat was being said about her, she had long ago fallen asleep. Philipngot up as soon as Robin had left and went to Gwyn. He smoothed hernhair from her face and kissed her gently on the forehead. To bad Inhave to leave, I could stay with her all day, but I am still the kingnand have duties to attend. and with that thought he walked out thendoor and into the hall. When he shut the door behind him and turnednto the hall, he found Frodrick standing in front of him. \"OhnFrodrick, in all the excitement, I forgot I had, no Gwyn had, sentnfor you. I'm sorry, but you'll have to wait though, she fellnasleep during the meeting, and the doctor says she needs her rest.nYou can go in their and wait though.\" \"No, that'snalright your majesty, I'll come and see her when she awakes,\"nFrodrick assured him, \"I would like to, however discuss ournrelations with Spain.\" \"All right, I'mnbusy right know, because I am behind on paperwork, but as soon as Inhave time and its alright with you, well discuss it,\" promisednPhilip. \"Thank you yournmajesty,\" said Frodrick with a slight bow. But just as he begannto leave Philip said, \"oh, and Frodrick. Please do not call me yournmajesty unless we're in court. You saved my life and I consider youna friend and friends do not call friends 'your majesty', okay?\" \"Yes yournmaj….Philip I will try. It's just hard when almost everyone elsencalls you that. But I will try,\" and with a smile and a wave he wasngone down the hall. Philip watched himnleave and then let out a long sigh, and trudged off to his writingnroom to get back to the business of being king. As he was sitting atnhis desk he thought I hope Gwyn is better by this evening, so I havensome one to talk to at dinner instead of that boring old duke. Butnnow is not the time to think of pleasantries, I have work to do andnwent diligently back to work. Later that evening…….. It was about time forndinner and Philip decided to go see if he was going to have an escortnor not. When he reached the door he took a moment to straiten himselfnout, the guards saw this and tried not to smile. The king noticed,nbut decided not to mention it. He knocked on the door, because henknew that just to walk in would be dangerous to his health. When henheard a soft \"Come in\" form the other side of the door he enterednwithout a second thought. As soon as he enterednthe doors slammed behind him and the bar was set in place, lockingnthe guards out. Then suddenly a knife was at his throat. That'snwhen he saw that Gwyn had been tied up and gagged. This he could tellnwas not going to end well.[Chapter 4] I'm sorry that Inhaven't updated lately. My computer's mother board died, and thennmy disc died, and then my friend's jump drive got stolen. Its beenna bad couple of months for the technology around me. That and theynset up a new program in my computer class so that when you shut itnoff it will revert back to the way it was at the beginning of thenday. All of the newly added stuff will be gone, and so the stuff Insaved on it got erased over Christmas vacation. So that is some ofnthe reasons for not updating. That and I've had writers block. Butnno worries I'm writing the new chapter as we speak. Thanks fornreviewing. Love, G-flea[Chapter 5] Disclaimer: I do notnown Princess of Thieves AN: So I finally gotnto a computer, and I finally got a new jump drive, so its all good.nAnd to answer mizukimarr910 no I haven't done anything badnrecently, that I know of. Or at least not anything really bad. Chapter 4: \"Sonnice of you to stop by your majesty,\" said a slurred voice behindnhim. \"We thought you would never come and that we would just havento settle for the girl, but you dropped by at just the right time.\" \"Howndid you get in here?\" Philip asked \"Ohnone of the nice guards told us when the guard on this door changed,nand then let us in in-between shifts. If he was trusted enough to benaloud to guard this door or yours he would be here for you to meet,nbut your captain is smart and the guard isn't that trusted, but henwas still able to get us in here\" \"Younwon't have that spy for long, the captain will soon figure out whondid it and there will be new company for those in the dungeon\"nPhilip said with a smile. \"That'snfine he will just escape with us, they don't know your in peril yetnso he still can get in and out of here with out much question.\" Just then Gwyn somenhow got one of her arms loose form the chair she was tied up in. Thenman behind her ran around to tie her back up, but she had also gottenna leg out and kicked him in the balls. He went down, but not for longnenough to get the rest of the ropes untied. She struggled, but he outnweighed her and got her pined down and tied back up again. Damn,nthought Philip, she almost had it. Philip looked at Gwyn, \"I'mnsurprised you got in here with out a sound, if she wasn't so tirednit wouldn't have been so easy for you. Besides what kind of mannhurts a defenseless woman to prove how strong he is? I'll tell younwhat kind, the weak kind. You have no chance in this venture, we willnwin and you will be sent to the dungeons for such treason againstnyour king.\" Thenman pressed the knife harder against Philips throat, \"You are notnmy king, you are a pretender who sent my king into exile. And fornthat he has plans for you that I will not spoil by killing you, butnhe did say we could do what ever we wanted to the girl as long as shenwas alive when we arrived,\" he said wile pushing Philip into anchair and tying him there. \"And I think that once we're out ofnhere we will take full advantage of that,\" he said with a leerntowards Gwyn. \"Yountouch her and I will kill you, even if I die in the process. I willnstill live long enough to dance on your grave before I die,\" Philipnyelled at the kidnapper wile straining against the ropes. Thenguards heard the yelling and knocked on the door, \"are you alrightnyour majesty?\" one of them yelled. Thenkidnapper's partner took out a knife and put it to Gwyn's neck,n\"Tell them every thing is fine or she dies.\" Philipnlooked at Gwyn and saw that she was scared, but when she saw himnlooking at her se glared at him. The look told him that if he gavenhimself up to save her it wouldn't matter if she lived, she wouldnhate him forever. He knew that she would say that the country needednhim more then her, but he knew that without her he wouldn't be muchnuse to his people. Plus Fredrick would probably kill hi anyway. Thennhe thought of something. The captain had said he had put a couple ofnhis best men at the door. They would know who had entered through thendoor, so he said \"Its alright, Gwyn just fainted, but the doctorsnhelping her now. And tell the captain that we may be a little laternto dinner.\" \"Yesnyour majesty, and what may we tell the captain is detaining you?\"ncame the reply through the door. Yes,nthought Philip, they caught on to it, but from the looks of things,nthe kidnapper had noticed something to. So he would have to bencareful about the next thing he said, \"Tell him that Gwyn wouldnlike to see to her horse now that she is better, and that after wenare through we join him at dinner to further discuss the news thatnRobin brought back.\" \"Yesnyour majesty, right away.\" And they heard two pairs of feet runningnoff. \"Yountold them something didn't you?\" asked the kidnappers when thenfootsteps were far enough away. \"No,nif I had they would have come bursting in here and some people wouldnbe very dead,\" answered Philip \"Finenlet's get out of here before they come back,\" said the kidnappernthat was guarding Gwyn. He cut her ropes, but kept a knife to hernback. The other did the same for Philip and they all started headingnout of the room. As they walked past the guards post the samenkidnapper said, \"It was very stupid of those guards to leave thendoor unguarded. I thought your captain was stricter then that.\" Justnthen the two guards came out of their hiding palaces just behind thentwo kidnappers putting knives to the now would be kidnappersnthoughts, \"He is,\" said one. \"That'snwhy we didn't leave,\" said the other. \"Now drop your weapons.\"nThere was the clank of mettle hitting stone and Philip and Gwyn movednaway. \"Are you all right your majesty?\" asked one with concern,nbut also with his eye on his prisoner. \"YesnI think we are,\" said Philip. Then turning to Gwyn he said, \"Inwould have died before letting them touch you, even if it meant younwould hate me, because with out you I wouldn't have been able tonlive anyway.\" Gwynnlooked at him and then said, \"I know, and I love you for it.\"nThey kissed and they kissed so intimately that the guards just turnednand walked away with the prisoners in hand, both knowing that thencaptain was going to be very happy to get the identity of the soncalled spy out of these two, and that soon they would have a newnqueen if things kept going the way they were going.[Chapter 6] Declaimer:nI do not own The Princess of Thieves. Sorrynit keeps taking me so long to update, I'll try and start updatingnmore. Chaptern5: \"Gwyn….. …..Gwyn?\" Fredrick said with a littlenshock in his voice as he came upon the couple. Gwyn jumped away from Philip in surprise. Philip justnlooked calmly at Fredrick and said \"Fredrick you have the mostnaggravating timing of any man I know.\" \"I'm s-s-sorry sire; b-b-but the captain sent me tont-t-tell you that if you are done s-s-stopping assignations,nw-w-would you please meet him in the d-d-dungeons.\" Fredricknstopped for a second and collected himself before asking \"Whatnassignations does he mean sire?\" \"I'llntell you about it while \"his majesty\" goes and sees what thencaptain wanted to talk about\" Gwyn said kissing Philip on the cheeknand taking Fredrick's arm and pulling him towards the kitchen. \"Andnwhile were at it I want to get some food, and unconvinced kept menform dinner. Do you think that the cooks would be willing to give mensomething?\" \"YesnI think they will but you will have to tell me what happened and if Inneed to tell people to start planning a wedding,\" said Fredricknloosing his stutter as he teased Gwyn. Gwynnhit him playfully on the arm as they continued toward the kitchen.nPhilip watched with a smile on his face. He was already planning thenproposal in his mind. But he totally refused to think of the wedding,nthat was far too much planning for him, a mere man. But he did thinknthat he would ask Fredrick to be the best man. He hadn't made anynreally good friends besides him and it would make Gwyn happy. Philipnturned and headed toward the dungeons to see what the guards and thencaptain had gotten out of the would-be-kidnappers. He knew gettingninformation would not be easy, because he had told his guards therenwould be no more torturing the prisoner and the new captain agreed.nEven with the resent rule change the dungeons were not the happiestnplace. The feeling of death would always linger here, and Philipnhated being down here. But the captain would not have asked for himnif the information wasn't troubling or valuable. Asnhe entered the interrogation room, formally know as the torturenchamber, he one of the men that had tried to capture him tied to anchair and a little more bruised then when he last seen him, butnotherwise fine. The captain leaning against the wall with a look ofndisgust on his face, he looked up when Philip came in. \"His name isnVetch, he has just told us which guard helped him, who sent him, andneverything else he knows,\" the captain informed his king. \"Andnhow exactly did you get this information out of him\" Philip asked. \"Anfew casual threats and a search of his pockets which revealed thenletter with his orders. The dunce didn't think to get rid of it.nMakes me think how he ever learned to read.\" \"Yes,nthere seem to be more of those out there then you would think. So whonwould do this?\" \"nWell the guard that helped I already had a suspicion on, but it wasneasier keeping track of him then killing him for treason and maybengetting one that was smarter, apparently he was a little smarter thennI thought, or just found out the guard rotation on accident. As fornthe man that gives these men their orders, well its one of PrincenJohn lackeys.\" \"Theyncame earlier then expected,\" Philip said while thinking out loud,n\"He getting bolder, and so soon after we chased him out with hisntail between his legs. I take it you are sending out some men to trynand find him?\" \"Yes,nbut it will not be easy he is a snake and as such can hid under somenof the slimmest rocks. But we will find him, and this time he willnnot get away,\" the captain said with fierce determination. \"Good,nbecause I want him in this dungeon or dead before the wedding.\" \"Thenwedding?\" the captain looked confused, \"whose wedding?\" \"Whynmine if she says yes,\" Philip said wile walking out with a smile onnhis face, leaving everyone in the room, except the guard that hadnapprehended the man, with a look of shock on their face.

The palm trees were dancing in the light breeze. There was a late 70s Cadillac Eldorado cutting through traffic, blue in hue. The slick haired man behind the wheel was miles away. He was tapping his steering wheel methodically, humming to himself; his horn-rimmed shades hanging from his nose. He pressed them up to the bridge and then slapped the turn signal, changing lanes once again. He scatted along to the jazz radio. The digital radio read-out spelled 103.9. \"This is barely jazz.\" Sebastian mumbled to himself. He turned the dial to The Mix 106.7 . He was meeting a work associate Jonny Tay at the bar in Fairfax for an afternoon meal. He had almost made it when a bad accident on Rosewood had him gridlocked. He honked generously with traffic, thinking quietly that he was joining in on everyone's angst. Finally, someone turned around the accident and made some space for the Cadillac to clear by. He took the opportunity to lay the hammer down and fly clear of Rosewood, and take Clinton instead. Just as he made the turn, a rich bimbo in a Mercedes AMG came out from the other lane, and nearly hit the left front fender. \"I'm drivin' here !\" Seb shouted out the convertible. The young woman gave him a finger wag and he returned it, displaying a gold ring to the world. Once he was clear of the accident, it was a smooth trip leading all the way into his afternoon meal. There were a few new acts planning to perform at Seb's in the coming week, and Jonny Tay was anxious to get more lined up. \"Business is better than it's ever been, man. We have to capitalize while we can.\" The young dark haired and tattooed man said. \"You assuming we're going under at some point?\" Sebastian said while drinking a tall radler. \"You gonna run me under, Jonny?\" \"Seb, you know I'd never do that. I'm working for you. I'm just doing some club promotion. How do you expect to buy a nice place if were always in the basement?\" \"The basement's a nice place.\" He said, gulping down more beer. \"It's simple and easy. People know where we are.\" \"But they don't know who we are.\" Jonny chomped off a large piece of chicken from a wing. \"And they will.\" \"And they will.\" Sebastian smirked, looking forward towards the television above the bar where commercials were running through. \"You wanna go see that new movie Eleanor this weekend?\" Jonny began. \"No, I don't\" Seb's neck stiffened. \"Ya getting on my nerves with all these movies.\" \"Cripes man, I only asked you twice.\" Sebastian paused a moment while drinking. \"Sorry.\" He put the glass down. \"No movies right now.\" \"Well alright. You got any plans this weekend?\" \"None that can't be changed for something good.\" \"There's a promotion party for that new movie with Jude Law and Kathrine McElroy, A Future Not My Own. Saturday night in the Hills.\" Jonny took a swig of Canadian and ate another wing. \"I guess I could make my way up there.\" He smirked. \"There a piano there?\" \"Think they have an Essex or something. I talked to the event organizer if they needed a band.\" \"And?\" Sebastian said, with his face beginning to glow. \"No, they have one.\" He put his drink down quickly and smugly laughed. \"Some day, I'll play a party. Again. And not in a red leather jacket.\" \"When the world loves jazz again.\" Jonny mused. \"Won't be long buddy.\" Seb placed his hand on Jonny Tay's shoulder. \"Won't be long.\" \"I'm gonna be late again. Again!\" She shouted, alone in her Mercedes. Two cups of coffee, neatly placed in her cupholders, were both almost empty. She picked one up and gulped it down. \"Great. And I need another coffee.\" The woman ran her hand through her red tussles of hairdo. Her eyes widened. \"I forgot to go to Tania for hair.\" She pressed the voice button on the steering wheel. \"Mercedes, Call Tania Ramos.\" \"Calling Tania Ramos.\" The cars monotone female responded. After telling Tania to meet her for an emergency appointment in 20 minutes at the Warner Brothers studio, Mia was caught gridlocked on Rosewood, heading west towards La Cienega. \"Come on.\" She huffed. \"Why does this only ever happen when I need to be somewhere? God conspires against me!\" Suddenly a car pulled out of the way and the way cleared for her to rush through. \"Finally!\" She shouted. Depressing the accelerator, the car bolted off the line. From behind the wreck on Rosewood, a big blue Cadillac rushed into oncoming just long enough for Mia to spot it. She immediately slammed on the breaks and smashed her hand into the horn which blared loudly. The empty and half full cups of coffee flew out of the cupholders, flying into the dashboard, and splattered lukewarm coffee all over her car, including her Vera Wang dress. The man in the car screamed something intelligible out the air of his convertible. Mia lifted her middle finger to him and scoffed. \"You ruined my damn dress!\" She didn't bother to turn her head. \"What an idiot.\" She continued. The rest of her drive to the studio was fairly uneventful, as she tried to clean coffee from the dash and salvage her dress. \"Blot, not wipe\" She repeated to herself. Upon pulling into the parking lot, a grip was waiting in a club cart. \"Mornin' Mrs. Dolan.\" He said as she approached on foot. \"What happened to your…\" \"Don't ask.\" She said curtly. \"Just take me to the shoot.\" She threw herself down onto the seat and put her sunglasses on. \"I hate LA drivers. This is why I moved to New York. Everyone should move to New York.\" The grip smiled as they drove towards the coming days' long shoot on Soundstage 5. The day also consisted of a partial shoot along Wilshire before Grand Ave. That was supposed to last 4 hours but ended up last 6 and causing major delays to traffic (Which Mia regretted as memories of her hating film shoots reappeared in mind). As the shoot closed and she made her way back towards the parking lot, Mitchell Hardisty, one of the producers ran up behind her. \"Mia,\" he huffed, catching his breath. \"I was hoping you'd come to a get together this weekend, in the Hills.\" \"What for?\" She continued walking towards her car. \"Promotional, for that new movie. Uhh… The Future Not My Own or something like that.\" \"Oh, the one with Jude Law.\" She remembered. \"Yes, anyway, there are a few collaborators who'd like some representation. Free drinks, right?\" \"Alright,\" She smiled. \"You've convinced me. I'll be there.\"[Chapter 2] Another Day of Sun Chapter Two \"No, sweetie, it's just a gathering sort of thing. It's not what you imagine when someone says Hollywood Party .\" Mia smiled, calming her scornful husband at the activity. \"How's my little darling?\" \"She's good.\" David replied. \"She misses her mother, a lot.\" \"I miss her too. I'll be home soon for a break in filming.\" \"Why don't we just come and visit you? The two of us.\" David piped up. \"You'll be without me most of the days!\" She cooed. \"I'm so busy, David. I don't have time to see you both.\" \"Alright.\" His voice resounded in the speaker. \"Love you.\" \"Oh, David.\" Mia sighed. \"Don't be like that.\" \"Be like what? Tell you I love you?\" \"You know what I mean. Don't be like that.\" \"Alright. Well, I do love you. And I want you to come home soon during one of your weekends. Fly back to New York.\" \"Okay. I'll book it soon. Love you both.\" \"Bye Bye.\" David hung up the phone. There was a long winding road that lead up to the Hollywood house where the party was being held. It was nestled just far enough away that you could see Venice Beach over the rolling hills, but not so close that you could hear the beachgoers echoes in the night. It was an mid-century house, something Mia didn't like much; edges on everything. Even the rear patio pool had tight edges everywhere. There were guests in well dressed suits and dresses, a band playing soothing music in the corner; a very average party in all. A few well-known faces were amongst the crowd, some certainly that would turn heads at a regular get-together, not so much in Hollywood. Kathrine McElroy was surrounded by a plot of guests, all with beverages in hand laughing loudly. Mia was making her way through the stragglers; some said hello and looked on. A man approached, with messy hair and circular shades. \"Mia, how are you?\" He said. \"Paul.\" She smiled brightly and gave him a hug. \"It's been a while.\" \"Almost a year! Since Eleanor was almost done at least.\" He brought a drink to lips. \"How's your new thing?\" \"It's going well.\" She looked around. \"We're more than hallway done now,\" A waitress came by and gave Mia a champagne. \"How's David and your little one?\" The musical ensemble switched to play some big band songs. \"Good. They're relaxing at home in New York while I'm here all alone.\" \"You know my studio is always open to you,\" The young man smiled charmingly. \"I see my date, Mia, lovely talking to you. I'll come find you later.\" And with that, Paul whisked himself across the yard to meet a very tall and thin woman with an olive complexion and dark eyes. Kathrine McElroy spotted Mia as well, and came to her side quickly, asking her about Eleanor and how she enjoyed the director (with whom McElroy had previously worked). Mia made small talk briefly, and thanked her for the invitation. Kathrine wasn't the kind of woman you didn't thank; she had a swing around Hollywood that could turn even the most fearless producer or director against you. It's how Scotty Johnson got blacklisted last year and hasn't had work since. The prestige of Hollywood comes with its perks and pitfalls all the same as the rest of the worlds business. A tall man, lacking any hair on his head and face lest a pencil thin peppered mustache, walked up to Mia as she sat down poolside. \"I'm Reggie\" The man said without further introduction. He was in his late 60s, early 70s, Mia guessed. His eyebrows were thick and greying. Crowsfeet were very visible beside his smiling eyes, and he had many wrinkles on his cheeks too. His skin was a rich brown, almost like a dark wood. His voice was thick and he spoke like the gravel of a hundred years of smoking. As she thought this, he pulled a du Maurier from his pocket, and snapped open a gold lighter. \"What's something like you, doing here?\" He lit the cigarette and inhaled deeply. \"What do you mean.\" Mia smiled inquisitively. \"You aren't from here,\" the old man pulled the cigarette from between his thin lips. \"I can see it.\" \"I'm from Boulder City, originally.\" \"Missouri?\" The man looked over to her. \"Nevada.\" Mia finished. \"Only town when you can't gamble.\" \"Can't gamble in Panaca either.\" Mia smirked, sipping her champagne. \"Never been.\" He inhaled on the cigarette. \"No one has.\" Mia laughed. \"What brings you here? Little out of your depth.\" \"The sax.\" \"The what?\" \"The sax. The Saxophone.\" Reggie smirked. \"My friend put together the band. He loves that 70s groovy music. The big band but the synthesizers combined.\" \"Sounds… unique?\" Mia laughed. \"It is.\" Another inhale on the cigarette. \"Not something you hear everyday. That band, Saint Motel, sort of picked up on the vibe.\" \"Never heard of them.\" \"They're pretty good.\" There was a brief pause in their conversation. Reggie simply smoked and Mia drank. She observed around her that a few people had become inebriated and were being ejected from the party as more flocks of people were pushing into the backyard. Kathrine McElroy was nowhere to be seen, many of the well-to-knowers had disappeared somewhere; either gone home or somewhere more secluded. Somewhere in the distance there was a piano playing. At first, it was a distant noise that combined with the background hum of partygoers. It was rich in tone, thick of body. It sounded of another time, Mia thought. She sat up from beside Reggie, looking about to see whence the tickled ivories came. The people around her obscured any trace of her view. \"It's in the office space.\" Reggie noted. \"Behind us.\" \"Who's playing? Steinway himself?\" \"Sounds like a lonely man.\" Reggie took a final drag on his cig. Mia frowned. \"Why do you say that?\" \"The notes. They're sad. Unrequited love or something.\" Reggie stood up. \"I've gotta go back. See you later, tomato.\" He clicked his tongue and winked. Mia's lips moved just enough to display a smile. She stood up, moving through the crowd to the door of the house, behind her. The piano became louder. As she closed the door, she could distinguish the notes. It was in a rich key. Not G, nor D. Not C, or E minor. It was in something divine, like F sharp minor, or A or B flat. Something thick like chocolate and sad like rain. It was something beautiful. As she made her way through the house, she could see a lone man, sitting at an Essex grand. It was close to 6 feet, all black lacquer with a red-topped stool. The tone wasn't bright. Mia hated bright pianos. It was smooth. Like vermouth of some sort. As she drew closer the music became softer and she recognized the notes. They sequenced together like something from a memory. The memory drew closer, like a burst of colour and smell. It's Lipton's, five years ago. It's a blue dress and a call in from the street to a sweet and sour story ballad. It's a brush of the shoulder after a compliment, it's careening out the door to I Ran somewhere far away. He was wearing a cream suit, with a brown silk shirt. His shoes were patent leather, his hair was well clipped in a modern style. He had a silver square ring on one finger, a gold on the other. \"Hey stranger.\" Mia said, quietly. Driftin' Blues was played through the stereo speakers of Sebastian's Cadillac as he was driving up Mulholland Drive just before it turns into Encino Hills. The sun was dipping below the sea on the far horizon, and the breeze cooled his face in the open night air. He was glad to be attending another bash in the Hills; it had been a while for him. His cellphone rang, \"Are you here yet?\" The voice boomed. \"There's no parking.\" \"There's always parking.\" Seb jammed the phone between his shoulder and cheek, reaching with his right hand for the glove compartment. He pulled a map from the deep box. There was silence over the wire for a moment. \"Park on Mott Road South, go through the two boulevards and the house is at the end of the curve.\" \"Thanks buddy.\" Jonny hung up the phone. Seb drove the Cadillac up to Mott Road South and parked behind Jonny's car. He locked the doors and waltzed between streets, dodging cars as they sped by into the sunset. The big modern house was lit up like Christmas, many people were pushing through the front door. Seb avoided the crowd and went around the side of the house. \"Whatya doin.\" A voice rang from beside the entrance gate. \"Taking the short cut.\" Seb said, approaching the large bouncer. \"Ain't no short cuts. Take the front.\" \"Look pal, I know Kathrine. Just let me in.\" \"Everybody here knows Kathrine, that's why they're here. Now go through the front.\" The man pointed angrily. Seb scoffed and turned, walking to the front of the house, and the squeezing through the door with a throng of guests in black suits and ladies in red dresses. Some were rejected, some accepted. That's how it worked. There wasn't much for Seb at the party. He said hello to Kathrine McElroy for a brief moment and then she was whisked away, not to be seen again. There were a few familiar faces from the music industry; Reggie Carlisle, the old blues man, was talking to a tomato on the other end of the pool, Stuart Longmire, Keith's manager, said hello and offered him another run. Seb turned it down, shuttering after reliving the past momentarily, and Paul Mangano who ran Mia Dolan's career said hello as well. The crowd was overwhelming Seb and he looked anxiously for a door. There was one 20 yards to his 4 o'clock and he mad a dash after slipping away from some useless conversation. The house was empty though some stragglers hung about the exits and around the stairwells looking for the bar which was coincidentally outside and as far from them as could be. There were not many rooms as the mid-century houses sort of ran each room together in open air. However, there was a more obscured section of the house around the opposite end of the pool. It had a large sliding door which lead into a small alcove office. At the other end of the office was a large black piano. Seb ran his hands over the wood, looking inside of the box to see the internals. He pulled the red topped stool from under the keys and sat down swiftly. His fingers laid on the ivory, but did nothing. Nothing came to him that inspired him. He sighed. Thinking. One arm came up, and he rested his face upon his arm, looking down towards the sharps. Their song came to him. At first, he played just the right hand, slowly and quietly. He smiled, thinking of Lipton's. The left hand came shortly after and the song came together once again. He drew it out, adding a few bars to the octaves of minors running into majors. Everything was beautiful once again, when Seb sat down at the piano. Everything was still golden. He let himself go, his body swinging, and his eyes closed while he sat at the piano. He moved with the song. \"Hey stranger.\" The sullen voice came from behind him. His hairs stood on end, and his right hand smashed a discord of notes together. \"How long you been standing there.\" He managed. \"Long enough.\" She moved methodically over to the side of the grand piano. \"You still play that song.\" \"Every now and then, yes.\" He said. There was a brief pause in the air. \"How's your movie?\" \"Which one?\" She smiled. \"I'm here filming another one.\" \"They blend together, I guess.\" His mouth smirked, his eyes were empty. \"They do.\" She sat down beside him on the piano bench. \"How's Seb's?\" \"Doing well.\" He turned to look at her. \"We get more and more people every weekend.\" \"That's good, that's good.\" Mia stood up at the floor to ceiling windows that looked out upon the party. \"Nice place. Not the Van Beek though.\" \"I egged that place twice. They still serve tapas.\" \"The nerve.\" Mia smirked. Sebastian stood from the piano and walked beside her, looking out onto the partygoers. More were flooding in from the gate. \"They'll cave some day. After the 3rd time I rip that sign down, they'll cave to my demands.\" Mia looked to him warmly. \"I'm sure.\" She replied softly. \"How's uh….\" Seb started. \"He's good.\" Mia smiled. \"David. He's good. We've been apart a lot this part while.\" \"C'est la vie.\" Seb added. \"You got a little girl I heard too.\" \"Yes, her name's Cameron.\" \"I see you both in the paper a lot.\" Seb turned and began walking towards the sliding door where he entered. Mia said nothing but followed Seb. \"Do you have someone?\" She asked, matching his pace. \"Just the piano.\" Seb smirked. \"She's all I need. She doesn't talk back either. Although she is a little indecisive sometimes.\" Mia laughed quietly. They booth stood in the empty entrance hall under a hanging light. \"You're okay?\" Mia asked. There was a short silence. \"I'm always okay.\" Another silence. \"I'm gonna take off.\" Seb concluded. He hesitated and added, \"Can I walk you to your car?\" \"I'll walk with you instead. You walked me to my car last time. \" They exited the house swiftly, waltzing down the brick walk until the sidewalk, where they turned down the street. The sun was gone but there was the consistent bright glow that LA leaves in the night sky. \"Where are you living?\" Mia asked. \"Same place, just more décor.\" Seb quipped. \"I hope you aren't still in your parent's basement in Boulder City.\" Mia laughed. \"No, we live at the Chateau Marmont while we're here.\" \"A real low-class establishment. You should consider moving up in life.\" Seb smirked. \"I know, did you know Scarlett Johansson and Benicio Del Toro hooked up in the elevator? Or so says the French barman.\" \"No but I heard Zeppelin had a bad streak in the 70s there.\" \"Of that, I have no doubt.\" Mia giggled. They continued to walk in silence for a few minutes; their shoes clacking softly against the pavement. \"Do you still think of me?\" Sebastian asked, without looking to Mia. His eyes kept looking on. Mia turned her face to look into his eyes. \"Sometimes.\" She added nothing. He was still looking forward. \"Do you.\" \"Sometimes.\" He briefly looked to her, and then kept going. The night air was warm, the street lights were glowing. \"What a waste of a lovely night.\" Seb said, slowing down as he approached his car. \"You got a new car?\" \"Cadillac.\" \"It suits you.\" She quipped. \"Where's yours?\" \"On the other side of San Rafael.\" \"So, the other direction completely.\" Seb smirked. \"So, I got lost? What can I say.\" \"You need a ride?\" She stood there a moment in silence. Seb walked around the car, opening his door and sitting down to the plush white leather. He put the key in and roared the V8 to life. \"Boat's gonna push of the dock. Speak now or forever hold your peace.\" Mia looked to him. She grabbed the handle and opened the door, sliding into the seat. \"Where are we going?\" \"Mel's Drive-In.\" \"What about…\" Seb turned pointing behind him. He stopped, smiling and leaned back. \"Mel's it is.\" ","Summary":" Another Day of Sun Chapter One It was an unusually warm day in the city that never sleeps. The palm"},{"Movie":"La La Land","Title":"City of Stars","Author":"LondonaLozzy","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12386139","Passage":"[Chapter 1] I know there's a plan for everyone, but sometimes I don't understand what the message is, or what the point is. Maybe we're not supposed to understand. Maybe we just have to take the course that we think is right for us and hope that someone comes along who sees the bigger picture. I've always struggled knowing what to do with my life, where I wanted it to go. All I did know, all that I was sure of, was that I loved to sing. Not pop, rnb or even hip-hop. It was jazz. Jazz and swing. My Mum had always been a music buff, old jazz standards from the 40's being her first love. I wasn't raised on the music of Michael Jackson, Queen or Whitney like most people my age. I was brought up with Louis Armstong, Sarah Vaughn, Duke Ellington and my namesake Billie Holliday. It was this style that I lived on, that I fed on. It was my passion. Growing up in a small town in the middle of England I struggled to find my place, my place in the world. As I got older and adulthood loomed I started to feel trapped. I didn't know what I wanted or where I wanted to go. I just knew that, that wasn't it. Being there, living there wasn't what was meant for me. Like for most people if you blink long enough life begins to pass you by. It feels like seconds have passed, but in reality it could be years. When I was 23 I met him, my first and only serious boyfriend. His name was James and he totally swept me off my feet. He treated me like a princess, like I was his everything. I got caught up in him, in the things he'd say, in the things he'd do. I thought he was the one, that he was my purpose, my future. For the first year everything was great, perfect in fact. After that though, things started to change. We'd go weeks without talking, never mind seeing each other. When we did finally meet it was fraught with arguments and tears. I wasn't happy, he wasn't happy. One night, the night it ended, he came to my flat, complete with a bunch of roses and a forced smile on his face. He'd said it was to surprise me, and surprise me he did. You see, that same night I'd planned to meet some girlfriends in town. We were going to go to a few bars, maybe a club or two. I needed a pick me up. I'd got all dolled up, did my hair, my makeup. I even brought a new dress. When I opened the door and greeted him dressed to the nines, clearly not missing him at all, all he could see was red. He was convinced that I was seeing another guy and would not listen to anything I had to say. It was like something clicked in his head and he wouldn't be happy until I'd been punished. The unimaginable pain I felt when my jaw hit the hall cabinet after he hit me was unlike anything I could ever explain. The subsequent punches and blows that came after only adding to that. He didn't apologise, showed no remorse. He just dusted himself off. Dusted himself off and left. Laying on the carpet, blood caked in my hair, and bones broken throughout my body all I wanted to do was give up. I just wanted it all to stop. Vision blurred and ears ringing, it could have easily ended right there. But then, through the darkness and the fog I could hear a sound, beautiful music. I'd plugged my iPod in whilst I was getting ready, the songs blaring through the house as the horror occurred. As I listened in, trying to decipher the tune I was greeted by the vocal stylings of the one and only Ella Fitzgerald. She was singing Cheek to Cheek. A song about being so in love with someone, that just dancing with them melts away all your troubles, make you feel as if you're in heaven. Wanting to stay awake long enough for someone to find me, I concentrated on the lyrics, put all of my effort into focusing on them rather than what had just happened and how horrible I felt. It was then, right in that moment, as Ella's silky and buttery voice soothed over me, that I decided I was worth more than this. My life was meant for something, for someone. I wanted to feel a love like Ella feels in that song. A love so great that just a simple action like cheeks touching can be total bliss. That's what I had to fight for, what I had to live for. It was jazz that saved me. Jazz that healed me, and jazz that ultimately led me to where it would all change. It led me to L.A.[Chapter 2] Whatever it is that's meant for me, I have to stop trying to figure it out. I have to let it stay unresolved for at least a little while. I have to stop trying to fast forward to the 'answer' scene in the movie of my life. I have to trust the present scene of 'no answer yet'. Allow the question itself space to breathe. I have to relax. To live in the now. Now being the 105/110 freeway in Los Angeles. It's been 4 months since the incident with James, and it couldn't feel further away. Once I was physically healed and on the mend I did not hesitate in packing everything up and making the move to the U.S. I'd lived my whole life obsessed with American culture, the music, the movies of the 50's. I was half American as well, my Dad's family originating from Boston. That meant I had a dual nationality passport. I could go for as long as I wanted. It was somewhere I always knew I could make a life for myself. I just had to work out what part of America I was meant to end up in. My parents had been fully supportive when I said I wanted to make the move, travelling around the country until I found somewhere to settle. They just wanted me to be happy, to move on from what had happened. If letting me go was going to do that then they were more than willing. I just had to make sure I kept in touch. That was their one condition. As soon as I landed, I headed to a dealership and brought the best car I could afford with the money I had. Mum and Dad were taking control of the sale of my flat, so until that all went through I had to be careful with my money. Once out on the open road I just drove, drove to wherever the wind took me. There was no rhyme or reason to the places I ended up. I was just searching, searching for something, for someone. I just didn't know what or who it was yet. Good Morning, Good Morning It's great to stay up late Good Morning, Good Morning to you Driving along the freeway as I headed into Los Angeles I was happily greeted by the melodic voice of Debbie Reynolds. The song from Singing In The Rain bursting through the speakers as I turned the radio on. It was almost as if I was being greeted to the city, welcomed. One of Hollywoods most famous musicals was beckoning me to come closer and I couldn't be more excited. When the band began to play the stars were shining bright Now the milkman's on his way and it's too late to say good night So, Good Morning, Good Morning Sun beams will soon smile through Good Morning, Good Morning to you Singing along to the upbeat tune I nearly missed my exit that would take me into the centre of the city, the Hollywood sign now visible off in the distance. It felt different, coming to L.A. Special. I had a feeling this wasn't going to be a fly in visit like so many other cities before it. This was going to be a longer stay, maybe permanent. I just had to figure out why. For the first couple of days I booked into a motel whilst I looked for a rental near the city. I eventually settled on a small 1 bed apartment half way between Santa Monica and Hermosa Beach. It wasn't exactly a palace, but it was mine. For now at least. Each day I would drive to a different part of the city, trying to find work as a singer and make myself a bit of money. Before long I had become just another statistic in L.A. Another person looking to make their name in the city of stars. It was never about being famous, not for me. I just wanted to sing songs, songs that put a smile on people's faces, brought them together. It didn't matter where it was or why it was. All that mattered was that it meant something, something to me.

It's a metaphor.\" \"Their clothing's a metaphor?\" 'No, the wolfs' disguise. It's setting up the next book in the franchise, with Red Riding Hood and the Wolf and Grandma. See, the bears could warn Grandma before the wolf arrives, so when Red is introduced shes not just an innocent little girl but the forgotten daughter of a King...there's rival kingdoms, and only one girl has the key to peace...the bear used to be an honored member of one kingdom – he was an entertainer at court, I could work up a backstory where the bear didn't fit in at home, wanted to see the world, met a traveling jester, maybe joined a circus... But when the King was assassinated, the bear was captured and escaped, now he has to bring all the other storybook characters together to save the kingdom...It's all part of the same world but the Bear protagonist is tying it all together. It's Grimms Fairy Tales meets The Magnificent Seven .\" Carlo Falsetrope (pronounced 'fells-troope'. It's British.) couldn't believe this was the ninth time in eleven months he'd met with studio brass to pitch his concept. He knew the drill, by now: Announce yourself at reception, who directs you to an office never lower than the fourth floor. Hope no one else is in the elevator as you want to straighten your tie and check your fly; even though you just did that before entering the building. As you step out of the elevator, another desk where you repeat the 'announcement-and-directions' process and are told to sit as it will be 'just be a minute'. Many awards, posters and photos of smiling screen stars in the reception area as reminders of worship at the cult of celebrity; although over the months Carlo had noticed many of the photos had been replaced with newer, more currently popular stars, reminders that in the land where everything is worshiped, nothing is valued. Following a half-hour or so of waiting, you're directed to an office where a secretary (who more often than not seems surprised at your arrival) checks the schedule and offers you a chair. This time you're asked if you'd like a bottle of water so you know you're getting closer to someone with enough influence to budget for waiting-room-refreshments. At some point within the next ten to forty minutes an assistant arrives to conduct you to the person(s) actually scheduled for the meeting. You don't know what to do with your bottle of water - should you leave it here, for the secretary to deal with – or take it with you? Which is more rude? What if I hadn't drunk it all? If I waste water, in the middle of a drought (LA is always in the middle of a drought) will that influence their decision on my project? Swig down the last of the water and pray your bladder will hold until the end of the meeting. Enter the office: A large picture window with shades kept closed; high-fashion furniture designed for status, not comfort; and, for leaders in the business of creativity, usually the most constrained, uninspired and impotent use of space. Actually, within the sequence of months Carlo had been to these meetings, the series of producers, directors, show-runners, and other deal-makers had, themselves, all began to look alike. One of the suits leaned forward with a degree of interest; or at least of recognition. \"Like that Ogre series but with bears? Universal did well with those. Brought in big numbers. A lot of it had to do with the voice talent, I think.\" \"And a couple of spin-offs, but I think those ended up doing better on Video\", interjected the suit lounging on a sofa in the corner. Carlo wasn't certain who made the decisions, and who was just sitting in under the illusion of importance. \"Not exactly like that, but I see your connection...\" Carlo added. \"We don't want to do anything like that.\" said the first suit. \"We think Ogres have run their course.\" \"This isn't an ogre ; it's a bear .\" Carlo knew he'd lost them. Probably when they started comparing potential box office based only on what had been produced, and not on any story that could be successful. \"Large, gruff, furry. Same thing. I don't think you have what we're looking for right now. But thanks for coming in. Pam at reception can validate your parking.\" When Carlo arrived back at is apartment – he'd made good time this afternoon, about twenty miles from the studio to home in just over forty-five minutes – he took off his suit jacket and collapsed on his sofa, the only surface in the living area not covered with papers, books, rejected scripts of his own and produced works he was studying; and realized he had about a half hour or so before he needed to start out to that party in the Hills. Just young would-be actors and other film-types, but 'be and be seen', you know. Within a few minutes he'd drifted off to sleep; which quickly became an extended dream of the many different meetings, set-ups and premises he'd taken his original idea to in the past few months: Uncle ursus: Carlo's original 'Fourth Bear' concept that tells the Goldilocks story from the point of view of the bears. There may have been a fourth bear – we don't know. Maybe a visiting uncle? What's his story? Does he still live in the forest, or he's just dropped by on his way somewhere else? Maybe he's on the run and looking for a hide-out? Why? – does he have a mysterious past? Possibilities are endless. So many questions to address. Create a lot of buzz. Could be a franchise. So far every exec Carlo had talked with couldn't: A: See how the lead would accept a role that required him to remain in a bear suit without ever revealing his face; or B: Justify massive CGI costs that would blow the budget. Four (paws) for Freedom : War scenario with a bear that's been trained to infiltrate and destroy enemy positions, but is now suffering from PTSD; and his companion / trainer who's recovering from the death of his former partner who was lost on a recent mission. Plus the trainer is recently divorced and has two adopted special-needs children. At first the man / bear team don't trust each other, but through a series of close-calls, personal introspection, and a growing connection between the children and the bear, the partners find that together, the two are more effective than either one alone; and through the power of love, the four create a non- traditional family based not on how the world judges them, but on who they are on the inside . Before the concept was even under serious consideration, PETA notified the studio they would in no way agree to allowing a bear on set with live explosives. Particularly around children. Come'onna Pine House: Sitcom featuring a family-owned Italian restaurant, set in a tiny town at the edge of a forest and where the head chef is...a bear! And the family isn't Italian, but newly- arrived-to-America immigrants not from Italy, but a city of an entirely different ethnicity – so they don't know anything about Italian food OR 'small town' living, so it's up to the bear (and his three friends) to both cook the food and help the humans adapt to their new 'out-of-place' home – all while not letting the customers, or townsfolk, know bears are running the kitchen...and providing valuable life lessons! Wacky results ensue. In every meeting, feedback seemed to be centered around 'who would go to a restaurant where the cook's a bear? Wouldn't there be hairs in the food?' Wasn't a problem for rats , Carlo thought. The Bearverly Hillbearies: When an elderly animal-lover dies, he donates 30 acres of prime real- estate to the local zoo under the condition the zoo must keep and maintain, not sell, the land. Zoo decides to use the property as an animal nursery and hospital; among the the first animals to arrive are four baby bears. Lots of possibilities for comedy when neighbors who have never set foot outside of a city and are more accustomed to wild parties than wild- life realize who's moved into the neighborhood; and heart-wrenching drama when the audience is caught in a life-and-death struggle with sick / injured animals who may, or may not, survive to the next episode. Dr. Quinn: Medicine Woman meets Wild Kingdom. Feedback was the idea is too derivative; and after pitching the concept to three producers, Carlo received a Cease and Desist Order from CBS. Fairly Bear: A little different than the direction Carlo had originally intended, but in this one the 'bear' is a young, undercover (human) woman investigator who is forced to go out on her own because none of the three men she worked with believed she could do the job. Her name? Fairly Beare. She's not a bear, but she has a pet bear that she takes everywhere on a leash – and her trademark MO? She sets the BeareTrap . Possibility for PG-rated innuendo with double- entendre of bear/bare. There's been some interest, but studio lawyers always question the insurance necessary to maintain a bear on-set, and the whole 'Beare ' name wouldn't make sense without an actual bear . Case File: H.A.I.R.Y.: Harry was a normal guy until one day, he woke up to find he'd been turned into a bear! At least that's what he sees – to his wife, two children, and everyone else he's still a man, but he stumbles through life with, in his mind, the body of a bear. Psychological suspense drama – what secret is Harry hiding that has convoluted his mind to think he's a forest creature – or has he been chosen to fulfill a purpose only he can achieve? And who can help him find his true self...and uncover his hidden destiny? In the style of Wes Anderson, but unexpected twists of Hitchcock. This one looked promising. Yahoo had been discussing launching new on-demand options - Yahoo Instant Personal Entertainment Service (YIPES) – and at one point they'd even had a meeting with Marjorie to discuss contracts. Until corporate changes at Yahoo and new management wanted to take things a 'different way'. When the phone rang Carlo noticed he'd been asleep for less than fifteen minutes. \"Carlo? It's Marge.\" Marjorie Michelson, Carlos' agent. Always in there pitching, unlike some reps who you don't hear from unless you call them. Sometimes Carlo thought he was letting her down. \"How'd it go?\" \"No go\", Carlo replied sleepily; but it didn't matter as he'd had this conversation many times before. If he wasn't fully awake for the first few seconds he could just answer on auto-pilot. \"What did they say?\" \"Not what they're looking for. Seemed to think it had something to do with ogres.\" \"Ogres?\" Marjorie confusedly replied. \"Yeah, somehow the conversation got onto established properties and by then I'd lost them.\" \"Sorry. Maybe next time. Give you any encouragement – different approach, maybe take things another way, get you another meeting?\" \"No, I don't think they see the potential. I mean, seeing everything from the perspective of the bears? What's not to like? Even Mia says there's not much she can do...\" \"That's right, you know Mia Dolan, don't you?\" \"Oh, we go way back. Well, my friend Tracy introduced us at a party a couple years ago, but she was stoked about the whole 'Fourth Bear' concept. We still talk.\" Still talks to Tracy , Carlo meant. The closest he'd got to Mia was at an awards ceremony last year when she was waiting to be escorted toward the front of the house and Carlo was standing in line to have his ticket checked. Still gave him a few minutes of face-time with her, though. \"And she can't get you a meeting?\" \"She's mostly doing RomComs and Musical Drama. Different offices.\" \"Didn't you have a treatment where the bear falls in love with the girl?\" \"Yeah, ' My Den or Yours? '. But Mia doesn't think audiences are ready for a bear / girl romance.\" \"Disney did OK with ' Beast '.\", Marge answered. \"He was a Prince all along. Not the same thing.\" \"So\", Marge changed the subject, \"I've been following up on a project that's come across my desk from Japan...\" \"Japan?\" This caught Carlo by surprise. He wasn't even certain they had bears in Japan. \"Yes, Kobotumi Studios. Been around for decades, but not well-known. Most of the commercial work in Japan has been done by their three largest studios. Kobotumi has worked on mostly educational, corporate films. ' We All Work Together in Happiness ' and things like that. Now they want to move into entertainment, develop their own properties.\" \"Hmm\" Carlo considered. \"Yeah, tell them at Kobayashi...\" \"Kobotumi\" \" Kobotumi , I'll be happy to talk with them about...what do they want to talk to me about?\" Marge hesitated, releasing a less-than-encouraging sigh. \"They said they're looking for a 'traditional meaning conveyed through the fresh Western concept'. Not exactly certain what that means. You know, Carlo, the Japanese market expects certain standards...\" \"Sure, I could pitch them the fourth bear. Already been to every other studio in town, and taken the original idea into so many different directions I'm sure there's something the Japanese might like. About the only thing left is to make the bear a a grizzled ex-cop whose team – the other three bears - were killed and now he has a grudge...hey, Grizzled , that's not bad...\" \"Maybe it's time to drop the four bears, Carlo. Move on to something else. How about dragons? Dragons are hot, now. Or cats. Always a market for cats.\" \"Bears are versatile. Easy to anthropomorphize. Can be both cuddly and frightening. Consistent. You always know where a bear stands. Cats and dragons, you never know what side they're on. And bears are the same size as humans so no question about where they get their clothes. All those ducks and mice and rabbits in coats and hats, and we never know where those clothes come from . Kinda creepy. Besides, I've already got a treatment and outline of the other story...\" \"Yeah, the Western with the bear who makes clothing that solves peoples problems? Weren't people talking about that at one point...?\", Marjorie continued, patiently. \" ThreadBear \" Carlo responds with enthusiasm. \"Enchanted bear and his three traveling companions journey among America's western frontier weaving magical clothing that unravels the problems of people he encounters along the way. See how his creating clothes, is a counterpoint to unraveling the problems...\" \"Yeah, that's fine. We set up a couple of meetings on that. Whatever happened with those?\" \"Fell through. Maybe I shouldn't have pitched it as ' Route 66 meets Quantum Leap meets The Magicians '. Disney said it was too Dreamworks and Dreamworks said they already had an itinerant bear. I pointed out that's a panda in ancient China, but no-go. \"Maybe a little too ' Kung-fu -ey'\" Marge replied. \"I'll set up the meeting and get back to you. Anything on your schedule I should be aware of?\" \"Anything on my schedule\", Carlo answered; \"you probably already know about.\" Carlo studied the contents of his closet. Hollywood is a casual town and most of the clothing he owned was a combination of: Non-threatening colors; short sleeves; unstructured collars; Dockers; and shoes with no laces. He reached for his one business suit – dark blue with subtle maroon pinstripes - and was sorry he'd had the pants on each of his casual jacket-and-slacks outfits cut down into shorts. It made sense at the time – most of the 'meetings' in LA start out as brief conversations at pool parties or meet-and-greets, and it's important to fit in. You never know when there might be someone in the crowd. Since moving to Southern California from his hometown of Mudsplatt, New Hampshire (pronounced 'Mauds -platte'. It's British.), his wardrobe wasn't the only thing he'd had to update. In the two weeks between her scheduling the meeting with Kobotumi; and the actual meeting; Marjorie had reminded him – more than once – that Japanese business practices are more formal and they hold to a level of professionalism in all industries, creative enterprises notwithstanding. So on her 'encouragement', Carlo had decided to approach this more as a job interview than a pitch session. \"Kobotumi's set up a temporary office suite while they explore opportunities. I texted you the address – get it?\" Carlo checked his phone for Marge's message. \"Yeah, right here. Hmm, that's an expensive part of town.\" \"Yes, Carlo – it is . Just a few lower-level executives and staff officed there now, but if there's something they are really interested in some of the decision-makers fly in from Tokyo. But everyone you meet probably files a report, so remember, in this situation being on your best behavior isn't just polite – it's required. And frankly, there's not many more places we can go in LA, as long as you insist on sticking to your bears. I don't want to say this is one of your last chances, but...\" \"I get it, Marge\" Carlo confirmed. \"When they meet me, those Kobotumi execs won't even know what to say.\" \"I hope you mean that in a good way.\", she sighed.[Chapter 2] Before he had even approached the receptionist's podium, the young, pretty Japanese girl looked up and said: \"Mr. False...Falls... ?\" Recognizing she was becoming flustered and uncomfortable, Carlo offered: \"Fells-troope'. It's British.\" \"Ahh!\" replied the receptionist, with a deep bow. \" Felts-troupe . Kobotumi is honored. Please be seated. Mr. Takagowa and the committee will see you in only a few moments.\" Returning the receptionists bow as best as he could remember seeing that action performed in the movies, Carlo was thinking Sure , I know the drill. No elevator. Glad I checked everything before I came in. The seating area was tastefully furnished with finely-crafted wood and leather chairs set into small groups around tables of pebbled glass tops on rough stone pedestals. Between each grouping were carefully-arranged plants and, along one wall between the entrance doors and receptionist podium, a rock garden with statue of a crane. The only image on the wall was the Kobotumi corporate logo – a stylized version of the name with the 'K'; 'b'; and two 'o's' forming an old-style movie projector from which the remaining letters extended outward in a cone, as a film being projected. Carlo had just made himself comfortable; in his experience he'd be sitting here at least thirty minutes; when to his left a door opened, revealing another young Japanese woman as attractive as the receptionist, carrying a small tray. Approaching Carlo, she bowed; lifted the lid of the small container on the tray; and with a pair of tongs removed a steam-warmed washcloth, presenting it to Carlo. Not quite certain what this indicated; if the staff of Kobotumi had concerns of diseases being brought in from outside (he'd seen both young and old wearing filtering masks for just this purpose), he unfolded the towel and swabbed it along his hands and face, returning it to a small dish the young woman provided. She then, again with tongs, lifted and offered to Carlo a dry washcloth which he used to dry his hands, replacing it to the same small dish. Without a word, the young woman bowed and returned back through the door. Almost immediately a third woman, even more striking than the other two, emerged carrying another tray. On this, Carlo noted as she arrived, was a tiny container of water – as small as the 'airline' liquor bottles people seem to love; a small ceramic cup; two mints on a decorative oval plate; a single flower stem set in a miniature glass vase; and yet another towel, folded into a pyramid, sitting on a plate of its own. Setting the tray on the nearest table, the young woman bowed; opened and poured the water into the cup (there was just enough to fill the container; not a drop more or less); offering him the filled cup and, as soon as he had drunk the small amount, handing him the napkin which he dabbed across his lips before placing it back on its small plate which she was holding in anticipation. She then presented the plate holding the two mints to Carlo who took them both, at which point the young woman replaced the dish to the tray, bowed, and retraced her steps. Carlo hadn't even finished his mints and had to swallow one still almost whole when to his right a door opened and a young Japanese man exited, extending his hand toward Carlo. \" Falsetrope-sama , I am Eijirō Tamura. If you prefer, you may call me ' Dave '. It is an honor.\" He then bowed. It's a wonder the Japanese don't have more lower-back problems, Carlo considered. \"Please, follow me\", Enhero...Eniro... Dave continued. \"We have been anticipating your arrival.\" Within a few steps, Carlo found himself within the doorway of a room containing an oblong table in polished black; actually, an egg-shaped table, rounded to the back, tapering forward to a more pointed angle which was roughly directed toward the oversized windows framing a walled garden. At the base of the table; the bottom of the egg; sat an older man distinguished by the feathering of white in his hair. Behind him sat, to one side, a young woman with notepad and digital recorder; at his other side was a man, similar in age to Carlo, attentively sitting toward the edge of his chair. To the left of Mr Distinguished and proceeding clockwise, Carlo noted: - A middle aged man with a striped necktie; - A middle aged man with a solid necktie; - An empty chair (now toward the point of the egg); - Another empty chair; - A man, younger than Carlo, throwing caution to the wind by wearing a necktie which included a pattern . 'Dave' closed the meeting-room door, stepped forward and gestured with an open palm toward those sitting at the table. \" Falsetrope-sama , please make the introduction of ('Dave' proceeded to indicate from the base of the table continuing clockwise): Bochou no Takagowa ; kachou no Matsuda ; kachou no Chiba ; and douryou no Kubo . Douryou no Kubo requests for him you apply the name ' Sonny '. As each man was introduced, he succinctly nodded from his upper body in what appeared to be the seated version of a bow. Carlo noticed the young man and woman either didn't require, or warrant, an introduction. At the same instant 'Dave' introduced the man who for some reason wanted to be called 'Sonny', he leapt to his feet and in two strides was standing, after a quick bow, with hand extended in front of Carlo. \"Four Bear!\" Kubo ; uh, Sonny cried out with more enthusiasm than would be expected; and more than Carlo had received from any meeting he'd been to in a year. Or, ever . Carlo reached out to accept Sonny's handshake which he gratefully welcomed in a uncertain grip; but to reinforce his enthusiasm, Sonny grabbed Carlo's wrist with his left hand and pumped the handshake two times to be certain. \"Please excuse douryou no Kubo \", Dave offered apologetically. \"He is filled with much excitement about working on this project; and has not before been in the United States.\" \"Sure, uh, no problem\" answered Carlo, extracting himself from the handshake and taking the seat Dave had indicated. After scanning the room and its occupants to see all was in order, Dave himself sat in the last remaining chair, to Carlos' left. \"So\", Carlo began. \"I understand you're as stoked about bears as I am?\" The young man behind Mr. Distinguished – who Carlo now knew as ' Bochou no Takagowa '; softly uttered a brief sentence, in Japanese, beside the older mans ear. The only word Carlo recognized was 'stoked'. Takagowa did not reply, nor even acknowledge that he had been spoken to. The young woman dutifully wrote on her pad. \"Please excuse, Falsetrope-sama \" Dave interjected apologetically. \"It is custom for he holding the position of highest honor to first speak. However as bochou no Takagowa is less skilled in English and wishes to rely on his translator only for non-important information, he has, for this meeting, transferred the responsibility to kachou no Matsuda and kachou no Chiba\". As Dave concluded, he again gestured toward the two men he'd just named. Carlo already felt like he'd made a mistake that might end the meeting right there. \"Oh, sorry, I didn't know. First time meeting with the Japanese, and you know...\" Kachou no Matsuda shot Carlo a look that conveyed either anger or pity. \"Mr Falstrope; is use of that title permissible?\" Uh, sure . That's my name . Carlo replied: \"Yes.\" \"Very good. Please to use as my name Mr Matsuda ; and my co-director Mr Chiba . It will produce a more pleasant conversation with less need for formality.\" Seems pretty formal to me , Carlo considered. \"Kobotumi Film has, for many generation, produced film of highest quality for industrial, technical, and educational presentation. General Manager Takagowa-san is, in fact, the grand-nephew of one of the founders of our company. Kobotumi has now determined there is great opportunity in film for entertainment; precisely, film which conveys the cultural and fabled history of Japan in a colorful manner; story which many of the current generation no longer hold honor.\" Mr Matsuda looked toward Mr Chiba who nodded in agreement. General Manager Takagowa listened to his translator with no reaction. The young woman dutifully wrote on her pad. \"Kobotumi has determined that you are well-schooled in yōkai and respectful of its many forms. We are honored.\" All those around the table, including the translator, bowed at the upper body. The young woman continued to dutifully write on her pad. \"Mr Falstrope\", spoke Mr Chiba; \"We find great joy in your concept of Bear spirit as yōkai to be both revered and feared. It is bear who some believe can guide men who are lost, or destroy men who deceive. We have great interest in character to serve as guide to stories of yōkai and Japanese culture to modern generation. Please tell how your character of 'Four Bear' would serve for our purpose.\" Carlo couldn't remember any concepts he'd come up with that had anything to do with bears as spirits, or who could guide or destroy men. Or even what a 'yōkai' was. But apparently these men were aware of some of his work (how, Carlo couldn't imagine – maybe treatments passed from one producer to the other, he thought. Better than being passed directly to the wastebasket); but he was here and they were interested, so he'd do his best. He glanced toward Dave anticipating some signal to speak. Almost on cue, Dave gestured with an open palm. \" Mr Matsuda ; Mr Chiba \" Carlo began, looking toward the two men; bending into a slight bow while trying to rotate his upper body to acknowledge everyone (and receiving nothing in response other than a zealous smile from Sonny); \"I've...\" - taking a deep breath - \"...always wondered why in every story we're supposed to believe only what we're told. Cinderella and a glass slipper? – you can't walk, let alone dance in glass shoes. Uncomfortable and dangerous. Red Riding Hood and a wolf? Only one animal in the entire forest that can speak, and he's out to get Red and her grandmother? What's his problem? Snow White? – don't even know where to begin. So I asked myself, what about those three bears and the little girl. There's a lot we don't know. There could have been a fourth bear, and...\" Carlo struggled to think of a concept that would in some way satisfy the 'history and culture of Japan' angle. And to allow the translator a few moments to catch up conveying his interpretation of the pitch to Mr Takagowa, who was listening with no reaction. \"...so why not, and I'm just throwing out ideas here, what if the Fourth Bear is actually the Spirit of ancestral Japan, traveling in the form of a bear, searching for humans who have the compassion and honor to see beyond his wild and dangerous appearance, and the wisdom to be open to the teachings of culture and history? Maybe in the past there had been three other spirits who appeared in the form of bears – because throughout the world bears are recognized and symbolic – but each time those bears had been ignored, or maybe even killed, dishonoring the Spirits and their message. So now it's the responsibility of our Fourth Bear , within the world of colorful fable; to guide man back to an understanding of the stories of a people; of a nation; meanings which serve to enlighten the most observant, humble, and respectful of men. Something like...\" Carlo hesitated, trying to think of existing properties he could combine and compare. But nothing came to mind. \"Something like nothing's that ever been done before . What do ya' think?\" Around the table men shifted in their chairs to better gauge each others understanding. Mr Matsuda and Mr Chiba looked toward each other and nodded; Dave looked toward Sonny; Sonnys head swiveled between Carlo and the other four men, his smile saying all he couldn't (probably because he didn't speak English). In their final gesture, each of the men patiently looked toward Takagowa, who remained sitting with no reaction as his interpreter completed the translation and moved back into his position slightly behind, and to the side, of the General Manager. At his other side, the young woman continued to dutifully write on her pad. \"Mr Falstrope\", General Manager Takagowa began, \"with great expectation has Kobotumi Film desired to hear your story of Four Bear. Your work when brought to attention of Kobotumi Film was received with much enthusiasm. We find the image of Four Bear to be filled with much honor.\" Carlo braced for questions; criticism; or indifference. But the only response was the generous amount of head-nods and smiles he received from Mr Matsuda; Mr Chiba; Sonny; Dave; the translator; and even the young woman who had momentarily set aside her notepad. General Manager Takagowa remained sitting with no further reaction. As Dave rose from his chair, gesturing first toward Carlo; then toward the door; Carlo stood to leave, briefly hesitating to bow in response to the seated-bows generated by his departure. As he exited the room the only feedback Carlo could later report to Marjorie was the vigorous discussion in Japanese he heard as the door closed behind him. He wasn't sure they understood everything; they seemed to think 'Four Bear' was a fleshed-out character rather than a concept; and their complete lack of any follow-up questions or feedback meant Carlo had no chance to expand upon or define his pitch. Maybe something to do with the translation. But at least they had been considerate enough to maintain a polite amount of interest. When the phone rang Carlo noticed he'd been asleep for less than fifteen minutes. He'd just come back from one of those 80's themed parties that are all the rage. If he'd known the 80's would be so popular now, he would have paid more attention to the stories about how 'Totally Righteous' that decade was. \"Carlo? It's Marge.\" \"Oh, hey. What's up?\" Carlo answered, somewhat sleepily. \"I've got something that's come across my desk from Japan...\" \"Japan?\" Carlo replied, suddenly awake. \"From Kobotumi\", Marge continued. \"It's a contract for what they're calling: ' Four Bear: The Spirit of Japan descends from the forest as Historical Guide to Man and Defender of Culture.' Maybe it will be better in translation. Anyway, the offer is Head Writer and World Development for three seasons of an animated series; thirteen twenty-three minute shows per season; with hour-long bookends at each season...\" \"Uh... huh \", Carlo heard himself say. \"...and option to extend. Plus conceptual development for a feature animated film to follow along the same ' Four Bear ' lines...\" \" UhHuh\" \"...and first-rights for a potential theme park partnership featuring ' Four Bear Cultural Village '.\" \" UH-HUH .\" \"Uh-huh?\" Marjorie repeated. Is that all you have to say?\" \"Wow.\" Carlo blurted out in surprise. \"I thought the meeting went well, but I had no idea...\" \"I'd say the meeting went very well. Congratulations. We'll go over the paperwork, and have to meet with Kobotumi a couple more times, but for now, you need to celebrate. But take it easy; it seems the entire cultural history of Japan is locked in your brain, somewhere.\" \" Wow. \" Carlo mumbled in bewilderment. \"Oh, and there's two notes clipped to the contract. One's on Kobotumi stationary; from the office of a 'Mr Takagowa'. He writes: ' It is with great expectation of a happy partnership. Please accept our deepest consideration and respect .\" Carlo thought the last time someone said something that nice to him, it was probably his mother. \"This other one\", Marge continued, \"is...kinda odd. It's from a notepad with cartoon characters printed around the edges. It says: ' I am humble in enthusiasm by the joy that awaits us .' It's just signed 'Sonny.' Do you know what that's supposed to mean? Is it something I should be aware of? Something I might need to confirm or deny?\" \"What?...Oh, no, that's just the show-runner. Very excited about the project. Doesn't speak English. Nothing to it. Just lost in translation.\" Carlo hoped his carry on would fit in the overhead. He'd heard of all the airlines, JAL was among the most accommodating, but he'd never been abroad and didn't know what personal space he might have on the plane. Or even in what section he'd be sitting. Other than a couple of trips to Tijuana (that he'd rather forget), he'd never been outside the US. But Kobotumi said they needed him for three months, or more, of development, revisions, and world-building...and as they were paying for the flight...and a furnished apartment ...in addition to his contractual agreements...Carlo was... stoked. Exiting the cab that had left him off at LAX International Terminal, he approached the ticket counter and handed his paperwork to the attractive young woman wearing the JAL uniform. \"Mr...False...\" she began, looking at his ticket. Fells-troope , Carlo prepared to interject. \" FELLS-troope\" the attendant corrected. Is that British? I see we have you in Executive Business Class to Tokyo. We wish you the most pleasant and rewarding journey.\" The...End?

She just got the news of the death of Amy Dudley, Robin's wife. „Wife\" she whispered low to herself and the word was all bitter in her mouth. She was found dead at the end of the stairs of their country house. Was it Robin who put her aside, hoping that he could now marry her? Didn't he know that by this act, he would loose all his fellows and friends at court? That they now might loose every chance to marry? She did not need to call for him. She knew he'd show up really soon. I looked away then I looked back at you, You tried to say the things that you can't undo, If I had my way I'd never get over you, Today's the day I pray that we make it through. Make it through the fall, make it through it all. And there he was. Elizabeth looked up as he rushed in the room. He dropped onto his knees before her. \"Elizabeth\" he began, gasping for breath. She raised her eyebrows, keeping her cool. \"Yes?\" \"Elizabeth… I know what you believe, but it was not me who murdered Amy.\" He looked up at her in the eye. \"It wasn't you.\" Her voice was calm and she was nearly smiling. \"No.\" He was still looking at her, afraid of her further reactions. \"Oh. And then, who do you think it was?\" The sarcasticm of her voice chilled him to the bone. He could not bear listening to it. He got up to his feet and said, so loud that it was nearly yelling, \"Please believe me! You know that I nver, ever lied to you, not since I saw you when you were eight, for God's sake!\" Now that was true. She remembered. \"Yes, I know this. Please stop shouting at me.\" He looked at her. \"I am sorry\" he whispered softly. She bit her lip to stop the tears welling up in her eyes. And I don't wanna fall to pieces I just wanna sit and stare at you. I don't wanna talk about it And I don't want a conversation I just wanna cry in front of you. I don't wanna talk about it 'Cause I'm in love with you. \"It really was not you?\" she asked, her voice softened, tears shining in her eyes. \"No.\" He answered, sitting beside her. \"I promise.\" He drew her onto his knees, ans she didn't resist but buried her tear-stained face in his neck. He held her tight and stroked her copped hair. She sobbed and gave a sigh. You're the only one I'd be with till the end. When I come undone you bring me back again. Back under the stars, Back into your arms. \"But then who could it be?\" She asked a little later. \"I don't know\" He replied. \"It could have been only an accident. Or\" He added as his face darkened \"Suicide.\" \"But why would she have done such a thing?\" She asked, so innocently that he looked at her, surprised. \"You know it well, Elizabeth, just as well as I do. I had never spent my time with her while she was my wife. Every time I could have been with her, I've been with you.\" She somehow suddenly forgot how to breathe. \"Did I cause her death?\" He slid his arms around her. \"We both did it.\" He said, with his voice low. Wanna know who you are, Wanna know where to start, I wanna know what this means. Wanna know how you feel, Wanna know what is real. I wanna know everything, everything. She looked up at him.\"I am so sorry\" she said, a tear rolling down her face. \"So am I\" he replied simply. \"Do you miss her?\" She asked, afraid of what the answer may be. He shaked his head. \"\"It's such an awful feeling\" he said. \"While she was alive, I didn't really cared of her while she loved me so much. She even cut the sealing wax from my letters and collected them in a box… And I never truly loved her back\" He broke off as he felt he'd burst out crying. He didn't though, but tried to soothe the weeping Elizabeth. \"Ssssh\" he whispered into her hair. \"It'll be all right. Please don't cry.\" In a moment, she pulled herself back together. \"Listen\" she said \"you ought to leave the court for a while, only until all the gossips and scandals subside.\" \"I don't want to leave you\" he said quicky, and she could hear the fear in his voice. \"I know\" she replied quietly. \"Please don't make it harder for me.\" Pulling himself under the tightest control, he nodded, swallowing. \"Go to Kew palace, and wait for my calling for you\" she commanded. \"Yes, your Grace\" he bowed his head, making her smile. Then she threw herself into his arms, wrapping hers around his neck. He gave her a kiss, long and bittersweet. \"Will you write to me?\" Robin asked with Elizabeth still wrapped in his embrace. \"I will.\" She answered. \"Now, please go.\" She followed him with her eyes as he walked out of her chamber.

It's set after her lady-in-waiting, Isobel, is killed by the poisoned dress. We all know Elizabeth's heart lies with Robert Dudley, but I liked the idea of a Walsingham/Elizabeth pairing too. Of course, I don't own any characters and am just a fan of the movie. His black cloak trailed after him like a second shadow. He knew every corner of the castle, knew of every whispered conversation. He had spies in every corner of the kingdom. Walsingham was the Queen's protector – her chief spy. Even though his eyes were everywhere, he had missed a crucial plot. Simple, but deadly – a poisoned dress made of French silk – a gift from Mary of Guise in Scotland. Queen Elizabeth sat at her desk, the candles burning brightly around her. Though the night was late, she could still hear the church choirs singing hymns for her lady-in-waiting, Isabel. Elizabeth rubbed her tired eyes. The dress had been meant for her, though she doubted she would have ever worn it. She was not foolish enough to accept even so innocent a gift from a foreign enemy. But to see a favored lady die so cruelly in it while being seduced by Lord Robert- Angrily, Elizabeth stood from her desk and began to pace the floor, her large skirts swooshing around her. She was alone in the cold room, her ladies she had dismissed hours earlier. She needed the privacy to think. She needed time to grieve for her friend and time to marvel at the betrayal of one she had recently held so dear to her heart. Pacing did not ease her tumble of angry thoughts. She needed someone she could talk to. Someone who she could trust completely. Out of the corner of her eye she thought she saw a shadow move. \"It was a stupid, foolish plot,\" she grumbled aloud. \"How could Mary know it would work?\" \"It was a shot in the dark, Your Majesty.\" Walsingham slid out of the darkness. He bowed, but she could still sense her eyes upon her. He watched her as much as he watched her kingdom. It should have unnerved her. Instead, it secretly thrilled her. Elizabeth sat down again at her desk. \"Isabel was a silly fool who loved pretty things. But she didn't deserve to die in such a horrible way.\" \"I must remind Your Majesty, that she wouldn't have died if she hadn't met Lord Robert. The sweat awakened the poison.\" The queen turned her head and threw a glare at Walsingham for reminding her again of Robert's betrayal. He simply returned her look. The heat dried from her eyes. She turned back to her desk. \"I did not think he would be so stupid. Why couldn't he have just gone back to his wife?\" Walsingham moved closer to the desk, a shadow growing in the candlelight. \"He has already grown so much under your affection. Once he had tasted that power, he could not leave. Everyone despises him, spurns him, yet he stays here in case you once again train your golden light upon him.\" \"How can I?\" she whispered miserably. \"First he lies to me about his marriage and then betrays me with one of my ladies. Cannot he realize I could never marry him now? I am no longer a mere lady with a few estates. I have a kingdom to care for, a people to govern. I am a queen. No matter how much I love him, I cannot be with him.\" Walsingham had slipped silently behind Elizabeth's chair. She could feel him standing there, as if trying to guard her from her own black thoughts. She marveled that she could speak to him of such things as love. Walsingham was no mere subject. He was her sworn protector. He would never betray her heart, no matter how much money was thrown at him by Spain and France. \"My heart does grieve for you, Majesty.\" She straitened in her chair. He had placed his hand on the back of her chair. It stood merely inches away from her neck. She wondered how it would feel on her skin. Cold and stiff or warm and strong? \"If only I could protect your heart as I do your kingdom,\" Walsingham said. Elizabeth closed her eyes. \"Yes, I wish you could. I know, in your hands, my heart would never know sadness or despair.\" Walsingham shifted closer to her chair. She could sense him move and place another hand on her chair. A blush rose unbidden onto her cheeks as she imagined those same hands around her waist. She wondered if his lips would follow the curve of his neck. Her breath hitched a little in her throat as she imagined it. Elizabeth was no foolish romantic, but deep inside she craved a loyal, passionate lover as much as the next woman. \"I would do anything to keep you safe,\" he murmured. His voice was so close. She wondered how it would sound in a whisper in her ear. \"You are my most loyal servant, Walsingham. I will never forget that.\" \"I will never give you reason to doubt it.\" \"No, I don't think you ever will.\" The tension was thicker than ever now. She wanted nothing but to feel his hands on her skin, his kisses on her lips. She wanted to throw away all conventions and give herself bodily to him. He would soothe her heart and tormented mind. He would make her forget all of Robert's kisses and caresses. He would show her what true loyalty and love meant to a queen. She could command him to do whatever she wished, of course. She somehow sensed that he would obey anything of her – even if it risked compromising every moral fiber of her soul. The words were on the tip of her tongue. In fact, she had unconsciously arched her neck towards, exposing more of her flushed skin. She had only give the word and the tension would break. He would then devour her body and soul. Instead, the moment passed unspoken. Elizabeth opened her eyes and Walsingham still stood unseen behind her. She was not ashamed of her thoughts. She knew those desires would burn deep down in her soul for years to come. But Walsingham knew her better than she knew herself. She realized to be with her was a line he could not cross. He could best serve her as her silent dagger through the kingdom. This would ultimately be the best way to ease her unsettled heart. \"I must see to this French conspiracy, Majesty,\" he said quietly. \"It was a foolish move, but Mary of Guise will not pause long before finding another way to kill you. She will stop at nothing to gain your throne for her daughter.\" \"I know you will learn the secrets of her dark plans. Do what you must to stop her from harming up ever again.\" \"I will not fail you, my Queen.\" \"No matter what it takes.\" \"Yes, Your Majesty.\" With a final sweep of his black cloak, Walsingham left Elizabeth's chamber. She released a long deep breath. Already she felt lonely and cold without him standing guard near her. She knew not to despair. Even away on a secret mission, he would still keep watch on her. He could be thousands of miles away and she would still feel his eyes upon her. It would have to be enough to sustain her. She would soon see him again, hear his voice and share her thoughts with him. It was the only intimacy she could have with him, but it was enough. As Robert's betrayal had shown, she could trust no one else who could see the beatings of her heart as easily as the clouds in the sky. Breathing easier, she bent over her paperwork, counting the days until Walsingham would be back at court again. The turmoil and grief still raged about her, but her heart had been soothed. She would be able to carry on, despite however many storm clouds gathered at the distant horizon. She had her most loyal protector by her side, watching the shadows for every danger to her person and her kingdom.

Please tell me how it goes! Surrendering She had never been very good at surrendering, it had to be said. Heavens, she couldn't even surrender to a Spanish armada or, in her younger days, a lunatic sister who was likely to kill her. No wonder, then, that she hadn't been able to surrender to a man. A lowly earl at that; it's usually nothing short of royalty that she finds herself having to contend with. The latter thought brought something like a smile to her lips. It felt odd amid the layers of recent mourning and she stopped, casting eyes out of the window and back onto the dirty waters of the Thames. His presence, a challenge as she had often felt it was, had been a rare thing, something wonderfully rare. And there would be no more of it. Even as queen the power to raise the dead was beyond her. She had even now been speaking to the people. She was their queen, their leader, why should she not? It was she who had brought them safely through the war with Spain and they loved her for it. They threw their hats at the sky and cheered for God to save her. Imperiously, she had told them to remember him, and they would, she was sure of it. They would remember Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester who made a mess in Holland but who stood firm against the Spanish when they came to England. Very well for them, she thought, but they would never remember him as she did. They couldn't remember her Robin as she did. She remembered so much about him. The way he half-strutted about court, pleased as punch with himself for one absurd reason or another. He'd hold his head impossibly high sometimes, as if to challenge her even with his manner, not just his words and actions. And his eyes, those eyes. They'd watched her pushed through Traitor's Gate, ascend to a throne in Westminster and bounding down corridors at Greenwich, at Richmond. Well, maybe not so much bounding of late- \"Youth's a stuff will not endure\"- but walking, together, around her residences. And other times too. She'd find him, she'd find him in his rooms, adjoining hers. After all, she had the body of a weak and feeble woman, what was to be expected? She was the queen, she could have had him killed if she'd chosen but she still hesitated to wake him from sleep. He never seemed surprised to find her standing over his bed, as if sleep to him was just dozing off to wait for her. They'd hold each other, yes, as tightly as she could bear, lying there on his bed. He'd even touch her sometimes, like they were real lovers. She may have had the stomach, but not the heart, never the heart of a king. Her heart was so firmly a woman's that, with his hands on her, it rose into her throat until she nearly cried. And then she'd have to stop him. She'd always have to stop him. Lest she surrender altogether. Sitting down now and lost in thought, she found herself weeping. She had not wept since she had lain over his body, though he had told her not to. She had wept not for his soul, no. He had his faults, sure as any man did, but it was a good enough soul. It was for them she wept, for the soul that they had seemed from time to time to share. And she wished as she wept that she's had the courage to surrender to him while she'd had the chance. She wished bitterly that she'd married him, she wished for anything, anything other than this. She'd loved him, though he'd told her of his affections a thousand more times than she'd hinted at hers. She still did. She loved him fiercely and so she wept thus.

AN: My imagination as to what happened after Elizabeth storms out on Robert Dudley. \"I am NOT YOUR Elizabeth, I am no man's Elizabeth\"! Francis Walsingham along with every other person in the court of Queen Elizabeth Tudor watched as she shoved Robert Dudley away and stalked toward the exit. She turned and faced all of them regally and in full control. \"I will have one mistress here and No master!\" With that she turned and stalked out of the room leaving the pathetic and weak Robert Dudley standing in the room, Francis gave the weakling a glare of contempt and went after his queen. Was the woman stalking back to her room the same terrified girl who had come to the throne all those years ago? The one he had found in an old room crying while staring up at her father's portrait after being humiliated by Mary of Guise, who had helped into her next course of action? The power she expelled. I hardly recognize her now. Francis thought with pride. Robert Dudley had kept Elizabeth tied to him and had put her throne and realm on the line, Walsingham despised the man he had no tolerance for weaklings who couldn't help Elizabeth triumph, who couldn't see past what they could gain. Elizabeth turned; \"why do you follow Sir Francis?\" She wasn't happy nor was she totally angry, now was the time to try to get her past Robert Dudley, before the scandal of his deceased wife could drag Elizabeth down. \"It is my business your majesty...\" \"To protect me against all things...\" she finished with a twinkle in her brown eyes. A guard opened the door to her bedchamber and after she went in first nodded at Walsingham to follow. \"I am proud of you my Queen.\" Francis said. \"Proud of what?\" \"The way you commanded yourself in front of the court.\" Elizabeth sneered; \"Robert Dudley is no longer such a pleasurable diversion for me, he is showing his true colors. I got rid of him this time but in the future I fear I may cave.\" Francis came closer, \"You should not consider that action\". He caught himself before the world must had escaped, \"You have come a long way my Queen.\" Elizabeth nodded; it was due to the man standing in front of her, her Moor as she called him. More and more she wanted him by her side and not Cecil. \"What if I cannot resist Robert?\" She looked up to see Walsingham a few inches in front of her. Shocked as Walsingham gripped her shoulders, she was even more stunned as his lips came to hers. His lips were soft and commanding but he didn't pry her lips open as Robert had done. She felt the anger bubble up in her, how dare he use the Queen's person this way? Elizabeth shoved him and wondered why she didn't call for her ladies or her guards, \"How dare you touch our person this way? What kind of man are you Francis Walsingham?\" His eyes grew hard, \"One who does what it takes to keep the realm and his queen safe, someone who knows how to get the job done. How can you resist Robert Dudley? The anger you felt at what I did, use it on him, think also of the many times he has failed. Use all the anger and flame your heart with it, use it as refuge and desire to be the queen England needs. I will always be with you.\" Elizabeth knew one thing in that moment, Cecil had been right to bring this man into her court. His kiss burned on her lips and she wanted to feel the same determination he did. She wanted the power he exuded. She wanted another kiss. That shocked her, she needed to reign in her emotions as they had made her have errors in judgment, but tonight Walsingham had kindled an even stronger flame, and she could admit how appealing she found him. \"Yes Sir Francis you will be by my side.\" She was proud of the authority she had in her voice. \"Your majesty I have important business to attend too and I will be absent from court for a few days, it is something that cannot be avoided.\" Her curiosity spiked, \"very well Sir Francis go safely.\" He bowed and left the room. Elizabeth looked at herself in the mirror, could Francis have fallen in love with her? Two days later word of the death of Mary of Guise came like a mighty wind.

She seated at the highest table of honor, he at the lowest. Her current lover knelt down beside her to whisper in her ear, and as he did so, the man across the hall's eyes were like knives in her breast. She impatiently brushed off her current lover and he retreated with pleading dog-like eyes that followed her as she stood and crossed the room. She stood before him and offered her hand solemnly. He nodded, and now under his gaze she felt a stab of pain in her gut, and at the same time a rush of heat flood her body as she anxiously awaited his hand to touch hers. \"It's time for our dance,\" she proclaimed confidently, and yet tears almost welling to her eyes at the momentous words she had just spoken. He nodded once more, and now his hand made contact with hers and she practically sighed with relief and her eyes slipped closed in release for a second before she reclaimed herself. Hands clasped tightly they took the dance floor. It seemed an eternity that they were the only couple that danced, but within moments the floor was flooded with partners weaving in and out. A labyrinth of dancers trading partners, exchanging pleasantries. She of course, as always, saw only his eyes, darker than the ocean, looming above her and she would melt in them. His hand hot on her back, scorching through the fabric of her dress, his fingertips pressing into her. She wasn't sure how much she dared to give in, how much control she could let slip before she slipped entirely into a future that she could not accept as her own. I will be a failure, she whispered to herself. \"Why do I let you torture me so?\" He murmured into her ear. She started, realizing she had spoken her previous thought aloud. \"Why do I allow myself to be treated like this?\" His breath was sweet on her face and she felt dazed by the familiar, intoxicating smell of him, of the air that he breathed, the things that he touched. The things like her. The formal dance pattern they made in this public arena was not enough. She knew it, he knew it. And that was the fascinating nature of the game they played, of what she had pronounced to be their dance. She had said it was time for their dance . And now as she clung to him she didn't mean it. Suddenly she was fully in his arms, inappropriately close and yet no one seemed to see, no one seemed to care. She almost laughed at the freedom of feeling him completely pressed up against her. She was overwhelmed with warmth, the solidness of his body. As always she melted against him the second their pelvises aligned and this time she allowed the sigh from earlier to escape her lips. \"Is this really our last dance?\" He whispered. Moisture sprang to her eyes again and this time the tears beaded along her eyelids but she refused to blink and let them fall. And so he was swimming before her through their lens, and blurring, and becoming like the version of him that appeared in her dreams, the version of him almost without a face, but always a body, always his body. She forced a brittle smile. She ran her hands up his chest and into his thick black hair. \"Yes.\" ","Summary":" They gazed at each other across the hall.

Everyone moved out of the way as the stately but angry woman came striding past, her temper was legendary; cross her at your great risk and even then the fate of that person would be most uncertain. Elizabeth Tudor found herself alone, although a queen was never truly alone but right now she was battling rage, grief, and humiliation. Everybody knew not to approach. How could Bess do this to her? How could Raliegh betray her? She was surrounded by betrayal, ever Sir Francis's brother had had it out for her. Bess had come to her as a child and become her favorite, she had even seen Bess as her own child, she was now at the age where she could no longer bear a child of her own, a sacrifice she had made and regretted. Bess had become with child by a man, not just any man, but by Raleigh. Raleigh; Elizabeth's mind spat out the name with sorrow and contempt. For almost five years she'd known him and she had loved him. She had made him Captain of her Royal Guards, and he'd been running around with Bess. Why hadn't she seen it coming? Why had she lost all control of her heart? She had banished Bess from her life and put Raleigh in the dungeon. They would suffer from their separation and that was the only comfort Elizabeth could find in all this. She remembered wanting to beat Bess up badly, she probably would've inflicted blood if Francis Walsingham hadn't stopped her. Elizabeth looked out the window at the sunny sky. For a long moment she forgot everything, the execution of Mary, the spanish and the betrayal of two people she had adored. Francis, the one person she could truly count on. He had been with her from the moment her reign began, and that was nearly thirty years ago. Elizabeth opened her eyes as she recalled Francis telling her to have mercy on Bess. How she had told him to go be with his brother. William Walsingham had been in the plot to get rid of her, Francis Walsingham had been betrayed by his brother. They were now bonded in a new way. Elizabeth now knew she wanted to see Francis and told one of her other ladies to tell Francis to come to her. Elizabeth sat in her garden trying to gain some calm in herself, she didn't want to snap at Francis anymore. Francis Walsingham stood by the entrance watching her, William had been sent to exile to France, and Francis felt pain he would never see his brother again. How William got into the mess he did would forever torment Francis. The Queen's lady announced his arrival and Francis walked next to her, his walk was not as fluid and graceful as it once was, his health had been turning against him these last few years. Elizabeth told him to sit next to her and he did, his face was weathered and showing its age, just like hers she thought sadly to herself. She had begun to get concerned by his health. She had noticed his walking troubles. \"You are not well Francis.\" It wasn't an insult. \"I still have some fight in me.\" Francis smiled. \"I know its the same for you.\" Elizabeth smiled; \"My Moor I cannot imagine life without you.\" \"I've given it to you gladly.\" Elizabeth sat closer and slowly put her hand on his shoulder, \"I'm sorry I yelled at you earlier.\" Walsingham nodded; \"you are right about my brother being a traitor.\" \"He's your family Francis, I know putting him in the tower was hard. I don't blame you for his betrayal.\" Walsingham banged his fist on his knee, \"I should've seen it somehow, before the asassian pointed the weapon at you!\" Elizabeth grabbed both of his shoulders, \"I didn't pay close enough attention to the matter of Mary Stuart, my own relative, I too have been betrayed by family and other loved ones..\" Elizabeth bit her lip and trailed off. Francis stood up along with her, \"You took a chance with your heart as everyone does.\" He stroked her face, \"I'm sorry you're hurting.\" Thier lips were mere inches from each other, \"I'm sorry you're hurting to Francis.\" The kiss that ensued was tentative but sweet, Elizabeth had dreamed of this man so much in the beginning of her reign, but time changed her and she banished those dreams, tried to forget the desire she felt for a man who could never be hers. They came for up for air but didn't pull away, \"I loved you from the start Elizabeth but I knew I could never tell you. I married Ursula because she reminded me of you.\" Elizabeth stroked his face, \"I loved you from the start and here we are all these decades later, older but still connected. Time could never destroy our loyalties.\" \"I'll always love you.\" He whispered. \"And I you.\" She whispered in return. She wanted to forget everything, \"I'm going to my chambers to rest, will you lie by my side Francis? Even if its just for an hour I want to pretend we can be together.\" He nodded knowing he had to seize a chance he would never have again, under the guise of private matters of state they retreated into her chamber after making everyone else leave and laid next to each other and embraced. They talked about anything they could think off, but the recent betrayals would intrude and tears would be shed, darkness had come outside when Francis sat up, \"I must go.\" \"I know.\" Elizabeth reached up and they kissed again before she ended it reluctantly. She watched him close the door behind him and after a few more minutes let her ladies into the room. They helped her get ready for bed and she tried to sleep knowing things would be tough for awhile. The months passed and the spanish invaded, she let Raleigh out to help in the fight and afterwards return home to Bess and the son they had. But one month later her joy over victory would turn to anguish as Francis's health turned against him and he was soon taken from her. But she would always have their one afternoon together.

Oblivious drunken joy shone through the murky depths of the commoner's eyes. \"We are saved!\" I ignored the words. They meant little to me. All I knew was that if this man didn't release me I would be promised the sound thrashing of Sara's wicker rod. \"Long live Queen Mary! Long live the Queen,\" he bellowed into the streets at the drunkards meandering their way home from the local pub. \"Please sir, I must get home,\" my efforts were futile, the man would sooner have let go of my hands at that time than thrown himself upon the mercy of the constables. \"Girl, you've got to live! How 'bout a round at Schmeckle's? That'll warm your rosy arse up,\" he roared at his lascivious joke, oblivious to my growing concern. \"What's your name lass?\" \"Miss Blythe! Girl, where did you wander to?\" A steadying hand latched on to my stooped shoulders. \"And who the bloody Hell are you?\" \"Oh Miss Blythe is it? Well, well Miss Blythe. My lady,\" he doffed an imaginary cap in what he apparently thought was a mocking salute. \"And who would you be my lovely?\" Sara Trothen disgustedly spat on the man's boots. \"None of your ugly business filth.\" His attention had already been drawn away, down towards the end of the lane, fixed attentively on the swaying bustle of a fine lady. \"I must bid ya adieu misses. I'm afraid I have just found myself unable to return your eager affections. But alas lass! You being but a wee child, it would never have worked out,\" he consoled me with a fond pat on the head. And before Sara could even blink in astonishment at his audacity, he was strolling down Mercy Lane without even a backward glance. The man was truly and utterly foxed. Sara was tugging at my braids by the time the drunkard had rounded the corner. Rather painfully I might add. \"What the 'ell are you thinking Avis? Mixing with swill like that? Why, you could have been ravished!\" My hair felt like it was being pulled out of my head by the tufts. \"Stupid gal! Can't even leave you alone one measly second without you wandering off…\" I neglected to mention that I had in fact not wandered off, she had. The mere question of who had indeed committed that atrocious wrong paled in comparison with the question that stood between me and my raging curiosity. \"Sara, who's Mary?\" Sara crossed herself as if she had just seen the devil himself. \"Queen Mary you'll be callin' her now lass,\" she nodded her head in assent as if she was convincing herself. \"The bastard? What about Edward?\" I ducked my head for the swing that narrowly missed cuffing my head. It was almost instinctual, as if I knew that with questions came the necessity of a blow. \"Queen Mary girl! Don't you be callin' the blest Queen of England a bastard if you favor you're neck!\" Sara stooped down to my level to peer fiercely into my own wide eyes. \"You don't understand now Avis, but to be calling that great lady anything but where respect is due is called treasonous. You don't live very long if you're accused of that my dear. You like your house?\" I nodded my vigorous assent. \"And your dolls, you like 'em too?\" Once again I felt my head bobbing as if on its own accord. \"What about your mum and pa lovey? Do ya like 'em too?\" This time I tentatively gave the affirmative. \"Well, I'd be leavin' off disrespecting Queen Mary if I was you. Cause that great lady ain't got a lot of patience, and to the Tower you go if you but utter a squeak against her high and mightiness,\" with that last sage piece of advice, Sara picked herself up and dusted her skirts out with a long suffering sigh. With the single mindedness of the young, I had immediately taken a dislike to Mary. As I imparted my opinion upon Sara, I was only granted a scoff of amusement. \"Oh, to be young and dull like you.\" With one last lingering glance around her, she gathered my limp hand up and I was gratefully carted home. That was the first time I had realized that there was a world outside of my cozy manor life. For the next seven years I was often prone to eavesdropping by the scullery maid's chamber, in the hope that a morsel of news from the court would drift my way. But alas, nothing of import ever did. That is, until the day a golden age of England was finally permissible to dare to believe in.

The aunt who inspired her to chase her dream. She has told me a bit about all in her family but she talks most about her crazy aunt. She told me the way they both would re-enact scenes from their favorite movies and the beautiful summers they spent together in the small old movies section of the little library across her home in Boulder City.

Will they like it? What if they don't?\" she asks hurriedly and holds on to my arm. \"They will love it.\" We sit in my car and I drive. I look at our joined hands and then at her face. She's smiling looking out of the window. The smile warms my heart and my mind wanders to the night we danced in the moonlight. She looked so beautiful in the yellow dress. I can still remember the exact notes we danced to, the exact steps we danced to and the way the light from the lamppost sparkled off her pale skin and… \"You're smiling.\" I look over to her and see amusement dancing off her as her mouth twitches. \"What?\" I ask. \"You were humming. And smiling.\" She answers as she leans over seat and faces me. I kiss the back of our joined hands. \"I was remembering the 'The Lovely Night' that caused us to rediscover our animosity towards each other and rename it as something more appropriate such as….love.\" \"Wow that is very thoughtful.\" She gives me a grave look. And then we burst into laughter. I look over and see that I've stopped us in front of the Griffith Park. She climbs out and we walk over to a sunny bench and sit down. I glance around at the trees and the setting sun. Life is going to give us both a new chance to pursue our dreams. All the elation I should have been feeling, all the excitement that should have been coursing through my veins like electricity turned in a gloomy mist of ice and dropped into my stomach and I started feeling light-headed. The warm sunlight that should have felt amazing in the winter evening felt burning into my skin. I looked over to her face and saw her looking over to the city that was all too famous for the endless love and breaking hearts. She will be going to Paris. A throbbing ache started to settle into my chest as I fought to keep my voice straight and eager and not dull and anxious and quivering. \"So, when do you find out?\" I didn't explain but she understood what I meant. \"They said in a couple of days.\" She paused and looked at me. \"But I'm not expecting to find anything out.\" She said. Great. The undervaluing over-modest Mia is back. \"You're gonna get it.\" I said as a matter of fact. \"I really might not. I don't want to be disappointed.\" She said with half a smile. The sparkle in her eyes was gone. I hated my sour voice that might have caused it. \"You will get this. I know these things. I know.\" I said and fought to keep my face straight and calm. I flexed my fingers repeatedly and looked over again at the trees surrounding us. My eyes squinted a bit at the glare of the sun and I took a few quick breaths. Even those trees know that when winter arrives, they will have to shed all their leaves and start afresh. They also know that when the spring arrives, the leaves that grow on them again will never be the same they had to lose. \"Where are we?\" she asks. I look at her face again and hold my right hand closed in a tight fist. She looks like she has aged ten years in that moment. The tiny freckles that ride alongside her eyes look prominent and her pained green eyes look at me searching. She leans on her elbow and frowns. \"Griffith park.\" \"Where are we?\" she asks again slowly and I fight hard with myself not to take her in my arms and never let go. \"I know.\" I take a deep breath and stop a shudder that runs through me. I clear my throat and speak without emotion. \"I don't kn-know.\" I close my eyes for a second and tell myself to do what I've been trying to do since the day I met her. Because if I don't, she will never find her dream or live it. All of this would have been for nothing. I gather all the courage and motivation I had felt when I had decided to drive through all the four hundred miles to get her to do this audition. She deserves this. \"Once you get this,-\" \"If I get this—\" \"When you get this, you gotta give it everything you got. It's your dream.\" I say firmly, but gently. She half nods slowly reading my face of emotions while I try to keep my face devoid of any. \"What are you gonna do?\" she asks. \"I gotta follow my own plan, you know, stay here. Get my own thing going.\" She nods again and looks down. She looks like she is going to cry. I can't let her change her mind. So, I attempt at humor. It always saves the day for me. \"You will be in Paris, Good jazz there, and now, you love jazz. Right?\" \"Yes.\" She laughs. \"I guess we will just have to wait and see where this goes.\" Her face settles into a grim smile and as she glances at me. Her eyes reflect so much pain that I did a double take. Am I making a mistake? This is what we have to do? Right? This is what we need to do, right? I was so lost that I could not believe what I heard next. \"I'm always gonna love you.\" She says her voice heavy. She looks like she is about to cry. \"I'm always gonna love you too.\" I say immediately and then think what we just said. Was it a goodbye? My chest constricts till I feel I am not able to breathe. But looking at her again, I realize this is at least as hard for her as it is for me. Isn't it? I look around again. I tell myself that we will see each other again. What did I just think? See each other? Oh my God. I can't even talk to myself now without making myself all the more miserable. \"Look at this view.\" I point my fingers towards the scattered trees and the observatory in front of us. She laughs again. \"I've seen better.\" \"It's the worst.\" I say. \"Yeah.\" We respond together and then laugh. I wrapped an arm around her and she laid her head on my shoulder. I kissed the side of her head and buried my face in her hair and closed my eyes. The sweet scent of strawberry engulfed my senses and the ache in my chest deepened. Is this really our last time together? \"I love you.\" I said. My voice came out like a whisper and my throat constricted and a tear escaped. I wiped it away quickly but she had seen it. \"Sebastian?\" I opened my eyes and saw her tear stained face looking back at me. \"Mia.\" We lunged forward at the same time and our mouths connected for a needful kiss. I poured all my emotion and love in the kiss. She pulled back once to whisper against my lips \"I love you too.\" My heart leaped and I tugged at her lips. She rested her forehead against mine and said, \"Come with me.\" That had been my thoughts once when I heard she had to go to Paris. But my dream is here. In Los Angeles. \"I can't.\" I whispered. \"I have to make my dream come true too.\" She did not respond further and nodded once. I pulled her closer against me. \"Wanna come home with me?\" \"Yes.\" She said.[Chapter 2] Chapter 2 \"Hey brother! How are you?\" Keith greeted me as I entered his studio. Mia has her audition results due today. We visited a couple of places to rent for my own club yesterday. Every one of them was more than I could afford at this time. To start afresh with risk in mind, I guess you have to have an income. A previous income and enough savings so that when your venture fails or in my case, jazz really dies, you don't feel shanghaied of your means to survive. That was the reason I was here. \"Good man. Really good. So when does the tour start?\" I ask. \"A couple of days from now and it will be a three continent tour. America, Europe and Australia for six months.\" \"Okay. The messengers are climbing high I guess.\" \"Yeah man, and half of the success belongs to you. Our channel on YouTube is full of praise for the \"The Keys Man\", the fans love you Sebastian. I love you too man, seriously you are the best I've seen in my entire career.\" Keith patted my shoulder and I nodded. I did not want to jump high in the air and pump my fist and shout. For me, it works differently. Though I feel elated at Keith's words, I also know that the same people who praise you and give you ridiculous nicknames will not even recognize you outside the YouTube channel, unless you have the balls to take the risk and do something for yourself. \"So, let's practice.\" I say as I move over to my seat in front of the two piano sets, one the real one and the other the electronic. We practice for the next four hours. Keith sings really well, I have to give him that. After the success of the west tour, even the other band members have started to acknowledge me. At least that is good. Because it is really difficult to play in a band whose drummist or saxophonist or trumpet master ignores you most of the time. I reach home to find Mia sitting and staring at an envelope on the dining table. Envelope? Letter? The letter! \"Mia?\" \"Sebastian.\" She comes over and hugs me tightly. \"Is that the letter from Brandt?\" \"Yes.\" \"What does it say?\" \"I haven't opened it yet.\" She murmurs in my ear and slowly pulls apart. \"Let's open it then.\" I say and walk over to the table. She sits on my lap and holds my arm tightly. I look at her face to see her panicking. She is biting and moving her tongue over her lower lip and her forehead is creased heavily with frown. \"Hey, you are going to get this okay? It's good news inside it.\" I say as I tear open the envelope and remove the letter. She does not even attempt to read it and sits quietly breathing frantically. She got the role. Oh my god. Brandt even sent an airplane ticket to Paris for tomorrow. I read the content quickly and decide to play dumb. \"Wha-what is it?\" she asks quickly. \"It does not say much. Just that you have to pack your bags tomorrow.\" I say and try hard to control my glee and maintain a neutral expression. \"Oh.\" She slides off my lap. \"You're going to Paris.\" \"Okay.\" She says without thinking. Then she turns. \"What?!\" \"You are going to star in an Amy Brandt film.\" I say. She jumps and snatches the letter from my hand and reads it. Tears run down her cheeks as she finishes the letter and I pick her up and kiss her. She puts an arm around me and wipe her tears with my thumb and kiss her forehead. \"I said you'll get it. You're going to be a superstar.\" She nods and rests her forehead against me as she whispers. \"Thank you.\" \"For what?\" I ask equally softly. \"For being there for me, for taking me to this audition, for putting up with me.\" She kisses me with fervor and breaths heavily. \"Nah, you are very easy to put up with you know. Just had to drive a couple hundred miles.\" I smile and wink and she laughs. \"I'm so happy for you.\" \"Let's make dinner.\" She says. \"I thought we should go out to celebrate.\" \"I want to spend my last evening here.\" She says with excitement in her voice. Last evening. My expression drops suddenly and the energy and warmth in my nerves suddenly turn into ice. I try to force a smile and say yes but my throat constricts. \"Sebastian.\" She comes to me and hugs me. Great. I've ruined her mood. I try to diffuse my anxiety. \"It's not like you won't talk to me. Right? You'll call me. Right?\" I manage to say. \"Yes. Every single day.\" \"I love you.\" \"I know. I love you too.\" She says and tugs me to the kitchen. I can't help but smile after listening to her sincere reassurance. It fills me with a determination. I want our happily ever-after's to start as soon as possible for which I will work hard with The Messengers and save as much as I can to start my own club. I already have a name for it. A smile tugs at my lips at the memory behind it. \"Sebastian, will the audience like me?\" Mia asks as we head into the kitchen. \"Fuck them.\" \"You always say that.\" She says and we both burst laughing.[Chapter 3] Chapter 3 I am sitting on a wooden bench in the makeshift studio that has been where our band had been rehearsing for the upcoming show. It has been five months since Mia called me. She used to call every day for the first month after she began working in her first movie. Then her calls decreased in frequency and I couldn't really blame her. Calling every day might have been a bit too much. But after that she used to call once in a fortnight and it gradually stretched to once in a month. I used to try calling on her cell, but it was never a good time for her to talk so we had decided that she will be the one to call when her shoot is over. But when I tried to call her at midnight when I didn't hear her voice for two continuous months, and an unknown voice greeted me, I thought that I should have probably dialed a wrong number. But upon checking the number, I realized that I should not have dialed in the first place. This was my last concert and I am returning home when I see that the lights in my apartment are on. Sophia. GOD! I pull over and I am just about to turn the knob when the door opens and Sophia hugs me. I hug her back and enter. A wonderful aroma of ravioli greets my over exhausted senses and I am taken aback. \"You cooked dinner for me?\" I asked incredulously. \"Yep.\" She answers and ushers me to the small kitchen and I am immediately brutally assaulted by mouthwatering aroma. \"Am I missing something?\" I ask with a frown and hint of amusement. \"Don't look so surprised, I have fed you a number of times.\" She says as she serves me a plate. I start eating without another word. \"Yeah. But nothing more than a sandwich.\" I say and stuff another mouthful. She serves me a glass of red wine. Okay. Seriously. What is the occasion? \"You are finally doing what you always wanted to do. Your own club. I'm so happy for you.\" She says lovingly answering my unspoken question. I rise and give her a quick hug and a kiss on the cheek. I so love my sister. \"So what are you naming it? Have you decided yet? And where is it located?\" \"I bought the place which was very cruelly being converted into a Samba-Tapas place. And the name has been decided.\" I smile fondly at the memory and a sudden pain erupts in my chest and I drop the fork. \"What is it Seb?\" Sophia asks as she sits beside me, her face concerned with worry. I sit up straight. I decide to seek her opinion. \"Soph, I need to tell you something.\" And I launch into the explanation of the last six months that conspired with me and Mia. She does not say anything for a long time. Finally, she says what I was worried she would say if told her everything. \"Sebastian, if she wanted to, she would have talked to you and this silence has an indication and you know what it is as well as I do. So, accept it. Move on. Work on your dream just like she is. Otherwise this sacrifice you both made for each other by sacrificing each other from your lives will be in vain.\" When she stops talking I rise and take the dishes to the sink. After keeping the dishes back, I realize that the hole in my chest has grown too big and the pain has become unbearable. But when I reach my room after a dull good night to Sophia, my eyes dart to the hand drawn poster for my club lying on the bedside table beneath the lamp. The apostrophe is really the best I've ever seen. I smile fondly and I don't realize when the pain in my chest becomes a spark. A source of energy with a stone determination to turn every single day from tomorrow an achievement and victory worth the pain.[Chapter 4] Chapter 4 I finish the final notes of my new song and turn to the audience to take a short bow and scan the faces for the reactions. I need not have bothered as a big applause erupts and I release the breath I did not know I had been holding. Even after three years of performing at my own club in front of all my colleagues and a new audience every day, I am nervous as ever as I finish my favorite piece. As a ritual, I name all of my artists and thank them for the night and finally leave the stage for the others to take over. I enter my home and plop down the couch and close my eyes. I am stirred awake with the ringing of my phone from my pocket. I sit upright and take my phone out of my trousers' pocket. I smile at the caller id and pick up. \"Hey mom. How are you?\" Mom calls me every week on a Saturday. \"I am fine. Tell me about yourself. How was your week?\" she asks and I can imagine her grinning over the other end. \"It was good mom. I got six contracts for weddings and one for some pichi kaka party of a businessman at his company. And the audience loves my club as usual. I am happy.\" I say as I recount in brief the turn of events for my club. This year has been simply the best for my club and satisfaction settles deep into my heart at my mother's next words. \"This is wonderful Sebastian, I'm so happy for you. I've never been prouder of my son. You deserve to be truly happy.\" She sounds elated and my heart soars. \"And by the way, I have some news to share with you. The girl you loved so dearly, Mia, the actress, is getting married tomorrow to an English guy. I told you these actresses are never to be trusted. If she loved you as much you loved her, she would not have forgotten you so easily now, will she?\" I sigh heavily. I have been preparing myself for this for the past four years. Then why is it so difficult to accept it in reality? A well-known dormant smoking fissure opens fresh in my chest and I am forced to close my fist as tightly as possible but the pain does not subside but grows. I am helpless. \"Mom, it's been a long time and surely it was time for both of us to move ahead in our lives. I don't blame her. She is a really busy woman.\" I say and try to control my breaths which seem as ragged as my voice and my mother catches it. \"Yeah. I see son, both of you have moved ahead in your lives so well. Congratulations. Your love was just seasonal. A spring essence of romance which was everything but deep and true.\" my mom said and I blanched. \"I am tired mom. May I go to bed now? And I promise mom after I am fully established, I would focus more on my personal life.\" I state as innocently as possible and a yawn escapes my mouth at the same time and fortunately mom (I can almost see her grumbling) bids me goodbye. I go to bed and close my eyes trying to get some sleep before my performance for the upcoming wedding tomorrow. I don't know when I start humming the music of ' City of Stars' and walk through the thin fabric of reality into my wonderful fantasy of dreams where happiness is not too foreign an emotion for me. \"That is not so bad.\" I rise from the piano stool and head towards the door. \"Not bad is great.\" I say as I walk out. I head out towards the street and walk towards the shady coffee shop which has been my early morning salvation for the past couple of months. My club is at the epitome of its popularity and now I even get paid to exhibit advertisements for movies and plays, the currently being one of Mia's biggest hit from the last month. I have seen all her films and am proud of her to say the least. I have successfully convinced myself for the best and am genuinely happy for her sake. The decision we took five years ago has been the best of our lives and we both have risen and achieved our dreams in the most passionate and desirable way possible. As I head to the stage for my performance, a brief sense of anxiety and uneasiness hits me and I stagger and halt for a moment to collect my breath which is heavy and uneven. I don't know what caused it and why but I don't have time to dwell on it. Heading to the stage I stand in front of the stage mic and thank each of my partners for a great job this evening and one by one introduce them to the audience with a cheer. \"Carl Bennett on the sax!\" the audience roars and my mood lightens immediately. I speak further \"Javier Gonzalez on the trumpet.\" The audience cheers again. \"The lovely Nedra Wheeler on bass. The one and only Clifton 'Fou Fou' Eddie on drums! \" I turn around a bit and point \"and a little too good on the piano, so good that he's gonna own this place if I'm not careful, Khirye Tyler, everybody.\" I say enthusiastically with a grin and claps roar enormously. I turn back to the audience and my eyes rest on a person whom I've not expected to meet again in this lifetime. My heart skips a beat and my throat constricts. Air gushes out of my lungs in a swift and I am left staring, unable to breathe, unable to speak standing in front of an audience which is holding on to each of my words. I don't know when the claps died down and suddenly everything I had to say is forgotten and looking down I manage to speak in almost a whisper into the microphone \"Welcome to Seb's.\" I barely register Khirye standing back and gesturing to the piano bench to which I head on out of habit unable to focus, breathe or register my actions. I sit in front of the piano and press my palm onto my thighs and fidget. I try to breathe but my breath comes so heavy that my hands start shaking. I sit still unable to move my hands to the keys for a long time and I barely even register when my fingers start playing my song, our song, or as it used to be. My fingers dance upon the keys playing the notes which I have never played in my club in front of an audience before in the last five years. This song has been my sacred song which I play every day within the four walls of my home. This had been my retreat. My sanctuary of solitude and seclusion for every night. My eyes well up. My subconscious starts bringing her face to the forefront of my mind and my mind is miserably flooded. Her eyes were still the sparkling emerald green. But they were devoid of luster. It may be because of sitting in the dark. Her forehead was creased and eyebrows were drooping slightly. She is worried? Because of me? But there is no reason to be. She is happy. She's has a family. She looked grave and unhappy. It's untrue. I must have imagined it in the dim lights of the club. The corners of her eyes were crinkling like she was about to cry. I cringe and curse my subconscious for bringing such imageries. It is then I hear the loud applause. I turn towards the audience and my eyes immediately dart towards her table. She is speaking to a person on her right. Her husband. Abruptly, before even the applause died, they both get up and turn towards the door. Right. She regretted coming here. She is leaving without even a goodbye. But I don't need another goodbye. I am happy with one I got five years ago. I can live with just one. I glance towards the door and see her standing and we stare at each other once again. I smile. It is better to let go. Get up and go to her. Talk to her. Just say something. I ignore the voice inside my head and attempt a smile. I don't know whether she smiled in return because she looked away and left after two more seconds. It is probably for the best. Because I don't know if I would have felt better or even worse after talking to her. I turn back to the audience and begin my next song with a cheer. \"Alright, one, two, three…\"[Chapter 5] Broken. Promises to Keep. Part two Chapter 5 Mia was sitting in the passenger seat of her car which her husband was driving extremely aware of the change in demeanor in Mia. She seemed awfully unaware and lost in thought. She had barely spoken a word after leaving from the club they had visited. He had tried to engage her in small talk like they would often do when they travelled. She had replied either in vague monosyllables or not said anything at all. He knew that Mia was an extremely reserved person and she never talked about anything too much, not even about herself but this time something did not feel right to him. While her husband was pondering what was wrong, Mia had only one thing on her mind. Sebastian. One look at him and she had started questioning all the decisions she had made over the last few years. The pain which emanated from his eyes as he welcomed her to his club broke her heart all over again. The way the skin near his mouth broke into an all familiar mix of freckles as he tried to smile forcibly brought tears to her eyes. And when he began to play his song, the special, sacred song, their song, she felt like a knife had twisted in her gut. The knife which had been stabbed all those years ago. The wound which had been bleeding all these times. The hole which never had sealed even after all these achievements in life. All the love from her parents, friends, her fans from all over the world and above all her husband had not been enough to aid her wound to heal. The beautiful moonlit night after the hideous party. The face she adored with all her heart. Abruptly, she had begun to imagine what her world would have been like with Sebastian. If only they had kissed at their first meeting at the restaurant. If only they had never parted ways and headed towards the future together. In Paris or in Los Angeles. Together, come what may. They could have a modest but wonderful home together. That could have been their future together. But it was all what could have been. A fantasy. In that moment, she had realized that she had fulfilled her dream to be the successful actress she had always wanted to be since her aunt first took to her to the library. But she had nothing to look forward to anymore. Everyday has the same monotonous glow like that of a prisoner in a cell. Except the bars weren't always there. They were handmade by her. Suddenly her door opened and she jumped. \"Everything okay baby?'' David asked. \"Yeah. 'course it is.\" She replied and looked around hurriedly to find that they had reached home. Already? But we had just left his club She did not realize when David put an arm around her and they walked into the living room. Her eyes caught sight of their two-year-old daughter. She bade goodbye to the sitter and picked Jessie up and went to the balcony. She was looking up to her with her big wide emerald eyes. She began to hum. City of stars… Are you shining just for me? There in the bars and through the smokescreen of the crowded restaurants… It's love, yes all we're looking for is love from someone else… A rush… a touch… A glance… a dance... Look in somebody eyes… That lights up your sky… To open the world and send it reeling… The voice that says I'll be here… And you'll be alright…\" She stopped humming and saw Jessie chuckling at her with inquisitive eyes. She kissed her softly on the forehead and asked, \"Like the song, Jessie?\" to which she clapped her hands and Mia laughed. The carefree, heartful laugh that she had not had in a long time. There was mirth in Jessie's eyes that regarded her mother with interest. They both laughed in symphony and it all came back reeling to her. \"You want to hear the real thing, baby?\" she asked to which Jessie nodded vigorously. She carried her to the bedroom and quickly left her on the bed to fetch her phone. She searched for the recording and found it. Mia took her in her lap as she hit the play button. A deep male voice blared softly from the speakers as she put the phone on her bedside table. The beautiful music of the piano greeted them and Mia closed her eyes and leaned back to the bedpost. She didn't know when she started singing in sync to the song and a warm feeling erupted in her chest. The warmth grew and a joy she hadn't felt in years made her heart fluttery and her cheeks flushed as she sang without a care in the world. Her happiness doubled when she heard Jessie singing with her. \"What is that noise?\" called a male voice as the door opened to reveal David in pajamas ready for bed. He looked…annoyed? She pressed the pause button. \"David?\" \"You were singing?\" he asked incredulously. \"Yeah…\" she flushed again. \"So…?\" \"But you have never sung before…\" \"So? I felt like singing today. What's the matter David?\" \"Nothing. I thought you hated all this…\" he seemed to be searching for words. \"I never said I hated singing or dancing. I just have never felt like that in a very long time.\" Mia declared defensively. \"You dance too?\" David was stupefied. \"Yes. So?\" Mia was angry now. \"No…nothing…it's just that I happen to know so little about you.\" David said in a low voice looking hurt. Mia cursed her mouth inwardly and tried to apologize. \"I'm sorry David. I didn't mean to hurt you. I don't like to talk much about myself.\" \"I know, Mia, which is the problem with us. Why don't you like—\" \"Look David, I'm tired and I've shoot tomorrow. I really need to sleep.\" Mia said trying to stall the argument before it becomes inescapable to dodge. \"What?! Just now you were— \"David was almost half shouting when Mia went past him carrying Jessie. He stood there motionless unable to comprehend anything. He liked calm, reserved Mia better. Besides, he really did want to know the name behind that voice that Mia was singing with in the recording. With an audible thump, Mia sat on the wooden chair, cursing the sun for the sweat dripping, tired to the bone state she was in after finishing just half the shoot for the day. The scorching heat of the noon was really draining her. She clutched a water bottle in one hand and sat back to look around the set. A number of people were milling about the entrances eager to peek a look at the shoot. She shook her head and smiled when she saw some people trying to push past the security and climb over the make-shift fences. Finishing her drink, she stood to walk to the ice box to grab another when her eyes met a sparkling sapphire blue and her mind was stunned into silence. Sebastian? She half walked, half ran to towards the entrance. Is he really here? She almost tripped on her own long gown when she came abruptly to a halt in front of the crowd which was cheering her name. Eyes searching frantically, she finally found him as he came to the front of the crowd, jostling in his way and a serene smile on his face. Without another thought, she held out her left hand to which after a second of surprised look he took and climbed over the temporary fence not taking his eyes off hers. \"How are you, Mia?\" he asked softly as they walked towards the set not letting go of each other's hands. Mia was still in a daze. He really was in real, walking beside her, talking to her. She focused on his deep voice and let it absorb. The glaring sun had suddenly turned into a soothing essence of pleasure carefully instilling a sense of calm in her. For the first time since the previous evening, she felt at ease again. \"I'm…okay…how are you doing Sebastian?\" she asked glancing at his face. \"Well, you tell me. How was Seb's?\" he asked with a hint of playfulness. \"It was really wonderful. Your musicians are good. And you were amazing. As ever.\" She spoke softly and he realized that she was speaking from the heart. \"Thanks. I…I ah…really wanted to hear you say that for a long time. I just couldn't make myself to believe that I really would see you again and…\" Sebastian stopped when he realized that his voice was coming out as a hoarse whisper. He had promised himself that he would keep his emotions in check after deciding to visit her set. He did not want to make her feel uncomfortable. But deep down he knew that he was deliberately torturing himself by coming here. Little did he know that the same errant feelings were being shared by Mia too. \"Hey did you want to catch up or something?\" Mia asked finally after debating internally for a dozen times. \"Yeah…but don't you have to…\" he gestured towards the set with his hands. \"I can take a break…and no you don't have to hide in the bathroom or something.\" Sebastian laughed. He could see the man with whom Mia was talking to, supposedly the director of the movie, rattled to his brains. When she came back and they held hands once again without a word, he commented,\" Your director looks pretty frustrated.\" \"Let him be for a while. He is not very easy to work with.\" She said and he laughed again. \"Okay.\" They walked to a nearby restaurant for lunch, each of them talking about all their struggles in the last few years. Once seated in an isolated table, Mia gathered the courage to ask what she had been meaning to since the last evening. \"So, how are you Sebastian?\" \"I am good. The club is fine. I'm doing gre—\" \"I mean how are you doing Sebastian?\" she asked again in a gentle voice. He blinked and sat straighter. He turned to look out of the window, not wanting to meet her eyes. \"I…ah…am okay. Mom, dad and Sophia are all happy with what I am doing, so, yeah. Everything is great!\" Sebastian said with a forced exclamation. He finally looked into her eyes and saw that one emotion that he did not expect to see there. Pain. Unmasked, raw, unhealed gaping sea of pain which made him feel the sudden, sharp pang in his chest that he had not desired to feel ever again. \"Mia?\" he said in a state of shock. She looked away and let out a sharp breath. She had not expected these emotions from the past to resurface at this point of time. Over the years, she had taught herself to never lose the battle over her feelings. All the deeply hidden sensations coming back to haunt her at once left her breathless. \"I…I'm good…just some memories.\" She said in what she thought was a convincing tone to which Sebastian nodded feebly. In reality, he felt terrible for causing them both so much pain and opening an old, forgotten and rusty door of memories. He hated to ask but he had to know. \"How long are you here?\" Mia looked up from her reverie and saw him trying to maintain a straight face. She cleared her throat tried to reply slowly, but the unescaped sobs that had filled her throat made her voice come out as a hoarse whisper. \"A week, at most.\" At most…a week at most…at most… Sebastian repeated like a mantra in his head. After that, all will be the same as it was in the last five years. Lunch was served and they ate in silence. A thought had been eating away his mind since he had seen Mia leave his club the previous night. Taking a gulp of water to clear his throat, he decide to voice it. \"Mia, you don't regret walking into my club yesterday, do you?\" Mia had not seen that coming. Why would he think that? Then she remembered the haste in which she had exited his club. She cursed herself inwardly for giving him such an impression. Oh no. He thinks I hated seeing him again. \"No. Not ever. No, Sebastian, you can't even begin to understand how wonderful it felt to see you again when I had not expected to see you or talk to you or listen to you play that song again…not in this lifetime. \" Sebastian wanted to ask her so much. But all those questions were submerged by the warmth that filled his heart when she told him the exact way he had felt when he saw her in his club. \"You liked the song?\" he wanted to hear her say yes again and again. \"I loved it Sebastian. The way I felt in there watching and listening you play that song was not something I have experienced much in a few years, except when Jessie was born.\" Before he could stop himself, he blurted out. \"Who's Jessie?\" \"Jessie is my daughter.\" Mia said holding his gaze and feeling a smile curve upon her face on the thought of her beautiful baby girl. \"Oh.\" He did not know how to feel upon this revelation. Not wanting to stretch an uncomfortable silence, he said \"How old is she?\" \"She's two years old. You want to meet her?\" Mia asked. The spark in her eyes and the happiness radiating off her was infectious and Sebastian could not help but grin and present his proposal. \"Why not? You two can come to my club. I can play. We—\" \"We can sing. She loves our song.\" Our song Sebastian was both thrilled and confused. \"Our song?\" \"Oh. I have a recording of our City of Stars in my phone. I played it for her yesterday and she loved it.\" Sebastian was trying hard to hide his happiness but was failing miserably. \"Then you two must surely come to my club. The club is empty from three to six. I bet she will have a great time.\" \"Of course, she will. We will be there at three. I have to go...um…see you soon.\" Mia said as they came near to her shoot location. Sebastian watched her hurry back and realized that he felt full of life for the second time in the last five years. The first time was when he had successfully realized his dream and his parents and Sophia had told him that they were proud of him. But this- this feeling of elation and inner joy did not even come close to that first time. It was unearthly, divine, inexplicable feeling of pure bliss.[Chapter 6] Chapter 6 \"She looks just like you, Mia.\" Sebastian said softly looking into Jessie's eyes as he makes them sit on a couch near his piano. \"Hey Jess, wanna hear me play?\" A smile from the little girl was all he needed to start playing. \" City of stars, are you shining just for me?\" Mia leaned on the piano and started singing. The feeling of old times did not bring nostalgia this time. It brought warmth and joy to the soul. Jessie was watching both of them with wide eyes. At the end of the song, the sound of her loud applause brought them both to the present. Grinning ear to ear, they both came to stand beside her. Attempting to humor the little girl, Sebastian bent down on one knee and started singing to her. Mia was both surprised and immensely delighted to find how much her daughter liked the man whom she loved with all her heart, even though she knew him for a few minutes. \" The sun is nearly gone… The lights are turning on… A silver shine that stretches to the sea…\" Mia sat on the piano bench and pointed to the space beside her. The look in her eyes told Sebastian to let's revisit the old days. Thus started their tap dance and the beautiful song that accompanied had all three of them enthralled to the core. The only difference was that back then, they would have done anything to abdicate each other's company. But now, they would have done anything to be in each other's company. Lunch in the empty club was heaven and Mia and Sebastian enjoyed it to the fullest. They danced and sang some more after lunch and when the time came for her to go her shoot, both of them felt the same dejection. When she was ready to go, they found Jessie fast asleep in the comfortable couch beside the piano. Mia was in a dilemma what to do when Sebastian rose without a word and covered the sleeping little girl's body with a blanket and adjusted her head on a thin pillow so that it may not pain when she wakes up. Coming back to Mia, he asked in a soft whisper. \"She can stay till you come back. When will your shoot complete?\" Mia could only stare at him in pleasant surprise as her love for Sebastian grew another notch. His love towards her daughter even though she knew how painful it must be for him made her giddy and lightheaded. She did not know why, but she felt so guilty at that moment that she decide to say everything she had been meaning to since the moment she met him again. But one look at his face and the pain and the sorrow holed up deep inside her broke free and she hugged him hard. Tears fell freely and deep sobs escaped involuntarily from her throat as she tried to speak her heart. \"I didn't know what do to, Sebastian. My dad, mom everyone told me to let go. They said you would not do anything in life and that I shouldn't live in the past. She even erased all of my L.A. contacts and set me up with David who already had asked me out. I couldn't call you, I couldn't contact you by any means…\" \"What happened then?\" Sebastian held her in his arms as calmly as he could without breaking down himself. It was fortunate for him that she could not see his face. \"I began to like him. He was just a guy in the production house when I had done my two movies. Everyone pushed me forward. He was smart and charming and cared for me. Everything had began to look up again…\"she drew a sharp breath. \"Mia, do you love him?\" \"Yes. But no as much as I lov-\" He pulled himself away and lifted her chin gently to look her in the eyes. \"It does not matter. You love David. You have a family. You have a wonderful daughter and you are on the top of your career as you can ever be. There is nothing to cry about. There is nothing to mourn for.\" Sebastian spoke gently and held her at an arm length looking into her eyes. He wiped her wet cheeks and gently straightened the stray hair from her face. Stroking her back, he spoke, \"You have to live your life as you have been living for these past years. We decided to move ahead in our lives five years ago. Look where we are now. .Successful. You have a life. I have a life. We—\" \"Do you?\" Mia spoke in a soft whisper. \"Do you what?\" \"Do you have a life? Are you happy? You met my daughter. Where is your family?\" \"I-ah…I've been busy. I got too much on my plate.\" Sebastian rubbed the back of his neck and frowned. \"That's not the point. We were talking about you. You—\" The way Sebastian avoided the question made the frustration and disappointment she was feeling turn into anger. \"I am talking about you, Goddammit! Answer me.\" \"Answer what?\" \"Where is your family? Your wife?\" she said angrily. \"What?! Mia, I'm not married. I—\" \"Why didn't you?\" This was the breaking point for Sebastian. \"Because all of us are not like you. I was not damn eager and….and excited to marry and have a family like you…because people like me, they don't forget every goddamned beautiful thing that happened so fuckin' easily and move on. Because losers like me like to dwell in a fantasy which is a fuckin' wonderful sequel of the past.\" He was breathing hard and the moment he finished, a raging guilt caught his chest in flames. \"You never lost hope, did you? You waited. For me. I never called. I never…visited…instead I…I— \"Mia whispered almost to herself. The tension in the air was almost palpable. She had never felt so horrified and guilty in life. Up till now, Sebastian had done his best to avoid bringing himself into the story. He had never wanted to make her feel this way. But for once he decided to go with the truth. For once, he decided to think a bit about himself too, to do the wrong thing. So he spoke, before his subconscious could take control once again and make him forcefully do the right thing again. \"Yes. I kept my promise. If you remember what it was.\" He spoke quietly and watched her face for her reaction. He immediately regretted it. Mia's expression changed from anxiety to confusion and finally to a look of comprehension causing her eyes to grow wide. She opened her mouth to speak but could not find her voice. You will never understand, but I have kept my promise too. She wanted to speak voluminously of her heart, to shout to him till he understands that the way he felt was mutual but could not. It was too late. And, besides, she cannot betray David. He was a good man. She had a family and responsibilities. \"Sebastian, I— \"she was interrupted by the ringing of her phone. Sebastian stood with his head down and waited patiently. Mia left for work shortly after she hung up. He went to sit beside the couch on which Jessie was sleeping. Taking the stool with him, he sat leaning against the couch and began gently stroking Jessie's soft copper blond hair and closed his eyes only to drift into a dreamless sleep. Mia had just sat down in her car after exhausting herself to the bone when her phone rang. Taking a large gulp of her ice-cold water and said without looking, \"Hello?\" \"Mia? Where are you this late and where is Jessie?\" came the concerned and a bit annoyed voice of David from the other end. \"She's with me, David. Shoot just got over. I'll be late. Don't wait up for me.\" Mia said stifling a yawn. \"Wait. What? You took Jessie to your shoot? Where are you?\" David sounded really angry now. \"Yes. She's with an old friend now. She—\" \"Which friend? You never said you knew anyone in Los Angeles.\" Came a suspicious and angry voice from the other end but Mia was not listening. She was too tired. \"We met today in the afternoon for lunch. She fell asleep in his home. I'm going to pick her up. Bye.\" Mia said and hung up before David could prod her further. She really did not have any energy left for arguments today. She quickly told the driver to take her Seb's. As she was passing through the busy L.A. traffic, she mused on the heated words they had exchanged that afternoon. She could have prevented all of that, had she been a bit clear headed. But when memories and dismay and repentance and regret came rushing into her heart like a tornado that never spares anything in its way, she had no choice, and the years of hidden feelings of despair and frustration poured out of her in a way she had never thought was possible. This vulnerability that possessed her whenever she was with Sebastian was known to her in a very foreign manner. Mia decided to end the night with the wisest decision she could make. She had finally realized something that was buried deep into her conscience which she never wanted to acknowledge. One last thing to do and hence save herself from jeopardizing both their lives. It was time for good-bye. Again.[Chapter 7] The one thing that Mia loved about this city was that it never slept. It was seldom quiet or dark in the streets of L.A. But it was the last thing that could make her feel better against the looming feeling of emptiness that was growing inside her and eating her chest out. She had just gotten out of her car when the music reached her ears. It was the solo piece of jazz piano which had the unnatural power to tug at her heart's strings like nothing else could. Sebastian was playing. A number of people were milling about the entrance of Seb's. She parked her care in a daze and entered inside taking the club taking slow steps. Reaching out to an empty table in the front, she sat down, all her plans forgotten. The music, the atmosphere in the club soothed her raw nerves and filled her with a glowing warmth that she had not expected to experience again, not after what she had decided to do tonight. But sitting at the small table in the dim light, watching Sebastian play, Mia could not help but feel that emotion again which had been clawing at her heart, the feeling which made her feel afraid and made her stomach clench as if what she had done couldn't ever be undone. And though she was still wallowing in unknown but bubbling guilt, Mia was never unaware of the way a few streaks of Sebastian's golden-brown hair would fall in front of his face and the way he would never care but keep his eyes closed as he played his heart out to the listeners, and that doomed fate of her existence which had proclaimed in all its authority that she would never experience it again, brought tears to her eyes and her heart broke all over again. She had vowed to herself not to endure herself to this torture again, yet here she was never wanting to leave again. A hand on her shoulder made her turn only to find Sebastian motioning her to come with him. Her mind utterly blank and her heart reeling, not knowing what to do, she went with him. A modest sized living room came into view and the lunch and all their conversation and Jessie came flooding back to her with a jolt. That was when she saw her little girl on the couch in front of the open T.V. She was sleeping with a medium-sized pillow under her upper back and neck and her small hands were closely hugging the backrest of the couch as if it was her own stuffed toy. Jessie was sleeping like the very same way she used to when she used to lay down on that couch. With him. Together. Mia couldn't speak. Whatever she wanted to say died had succumbed right there in her throat. \"She had dinner and I told her you would be coming for her soon. She wanted to see me play so I switched on the T.V. so she could see the club performance.\" Sebastian explained quietly. Mia remained silent for a long time standing beside the couch, gently stroking her daughter's head with her fingers. Holding back her tears had never been so hard and Mia didn't look at him the entire time he had spoken. Taking her daughter in her arms, she turned back to him. With a courage that she did not knew she had inside, she spoke, her voice thick, \"I am leaving tomorrow.\" Sebastian took in the words slowly, letting them sink in. When the reality of those words dawned upon him, his eyes widened. His hands dropped to his sides and he opened his mouth but closed it immediately. It had to happen after a few days. So, why not now? He tried hard to let his face be as expressionless as possible. \"Okay.\" He did not know what else to say to her. An all too familiar pain was boiling in his chest and swallowing his insides. His throat had constricted upon itself preventing him from speaking any further. She was saying goodbye in her own way. At least this is a little less painful than hearing the actual words. If she would have said anything more, it would have been his undoing. \"Okay.\" Mia whispered as she turned to leave carrying Jessie. Her mind was screaming at her to leave. Deep in her conflicted heart, she knew it was telling the truth. She knew where the night would go from there if she hesitated for even a single moment. The moment she turned her back on Sebastian who was looking anywhere but at her, her breathing quickened and vision began to blur. She didn't know if it was the tears that was increasingly making her eyes see black or what Sebastian was saying from behind her. The only thing she knew was that she had to reach her car as quickly as possible, and drive back. Her head began to pound hard and a blaring noise was beginning to deafen her ears making her mind fuzzy. She briefly registered Sebastian's voice calling behind her as her brain went into a overdrive and her eyes closed on their own and she felt her knees give out. Mia fluttered her eyes open to find herself in strange bed but in a not so strange room. She looked around briefly and sat upright removing the covers to settle her feet on the floor. Her head still hurt a bit as she started walking around rubbing her eyes and yawning. She walked around to the door to another room and laid her eyes on the sight that made her day. On the couch-turned-bed under the covers was her little girl curled upon the man who still held her heart, both sleeping so peacefully that it made her heart ache with both happiness and guilt. She didn't know how she could feel the two of them at the same time. Jessie lay cozily with her head lying on Sebastian's chest, both of their eyes closed but their breathing quite rapid. As she tiptoed to their side, Jessie stirred briefly and then snuggled further into Sebastian, her small hands holding him as tightly as they possibly could. Walking back into the room where she had slept, she searched for her purse. She found it on the small bedside table and quickly fished for her phone. Taking her phone, she went back quickly and clicked a picture for the pair of them. A small touch into the heart on the top of the screen and the picture was saved in the favorites in her gallery for as long as she wanted and her heart forever. But looking back at the picture she clicked, her attention was drawn to the notification bar indicating twenty missed calls and an equal number of messages. All from David. Oh, My God. What will he think? Hyperventilating again, she almost pressed the call button when she realized it was way too early in the morning. \"Mia? Are you okay?\" Mia turned so fast that she stumbled a bit. Sebastian held her elbow to steady her. \"We both thought we tricked you!\", he said, his mouth curved up in a hint of a smile and his forehead creased in worry. Mia hated that she was the reason that the frown was there. She avoided his gaze and picking a strand of hair and tucking it behind her ear, she spoke quietly, \"Sebastian, I need to go.\" \"Yeah, I know. Come on, I already made breakfast. Jessie is awake.\" Awake? When? Mia was confused. Moving to see the couch, she saw Jessie's emerald eyes looking back at her. She looked at his face while he was looking over at her daughter. And, once more two things simultaneously rose to a new high inside her. One was heart-warming adoration and the other, agonizing guilt. Her eyes began to pool with tears again. \"You didn't have to do that, we cou—\" she began but stopped seeing the tender scene unfold in front of her eyes. Sebastian lovingly picked Jessie up cooing her and went to the other end of the small room into a small kitchen cum dining, her daughter giggling all the way while she followed the pair of them. He set her up upon a wooden chair and laid her napkin on her lap. \"Good girl.\" He said and kissed her cheek almost lovingly. Mia sat down on the other end of the table with a smile that did not reach her eyes. Part of her wanted to go home but a much larger part of her told her to enjoy and savor the moment till it lasts, which was not going to be long. Seeing Sebastian feed Jessie, she was thrown into a world of fantasy where everything was set right by the almighty time. She could not help but reminisce at the beautiful days they spent together in his home, the singing and the dancing and the heavenly music from his piano and their happiness. All a wonderful fantasy of life that could have been. The life that should have been . Her subconscious whispered quietly. Seeing the pair of them, and her daughter so delightful and giggling without a care in the world, she could not help but compare David with Sebastian. Never before had she seen Jessie so unfazed and unafraid and enjoying so much. David never made her laugh like that. Neither does he make you feel like that. \"What exactly is this place?\" Mia asked to take her mind off thoughts. Sebastian turned from Jessie to speak to her and it was in that moment that Mia saw such spark and energy in his eyes that she had never seen before. The spark of love and devotion which melted her insides and tore away a piece of her heart again. \"Yeah. I call it my crash-room. I stay here for the night whenever I feel too tired to drive home or...\" he stopped talking and averted his gaze taking a mouth-full of eggs. She wanted to hear the other end of the 'or', but decided against it. She ate in silence just enjoying watching the pair of them laugh themselves off with each other. Or whenever you don't feel like going home. Her subconscious completed automatically. It was after she had finished her plate when she heard him speak to her. \"When do you leave?\" \"I don't know. The flights were booked by David.\" \"Okay.\" Not another word was spoken. Sebastian saw them off to her car and waited in the bright morning sun for full five minutes staring into the distance where Mia's car had disappeared. He chuckled in a low throaty voice to himself reveling in the fact that this time it surprisingly didn't hurt that much. Must be good then not knowing the 'when', chuckled his mind to him. David was beyond furious when Mia arrived home with Jessie. First her strange demeanor since the night after they arrived in L.A., and now her disappearance had made him question himself. How much did he actually know about Mia? She never talked to him freely. She says she loves him, and he knew it was true. Then why is she so distant? He did not even know about her pre-acting life, because she never talked it about. And now she spends the night with their daughter away from home. Where? And why would she won't tell him? Mia let Jessie into her room and sat on the chair beside David. After two minutes of fruitless staring, Mia broke the ice. \"I am going to Nevada, to my parents' home for two days. I completed three days' shoot yesterday to have some time off. I leave at ten.\" She said in a no-nonsense manner, only then did she meet her husband's eyes to see him stunned and speechless. She felt guilty again. Here he was waiting for an explanation on where she was the night before and here she was proclaiming her plans of Nevada to him. \"Why?\" the question came out before David could stop himself. \"Why? Are you asking me why I want to meet my parents?\" Mia asked deadpan. \"We could go together.\" \"No. I am going by myself.\" \"Why didn't you come home last night?\" \"I was with an old friend of mine and I fell asleep. We slept in his home, had breakfast this morning and came home straight after that.\" Mia said truthfully, leaving the fainted-out-of exhaustion-and-heartache part. \"Asleep. You mean with your friend with whom you were last night?\" David blurted before he could stop himself. Mia was thrown out of sorts for a moment with the comment. She could not process the thought of her husband accusing her of adultery. Right in the face. And then all the frustration, depression and anger returned with an uproar shaking her insides with cold, deadly fury. If her stare alone could kill, she could have sent David in his grave for that remark. Instead, without a word, she slapped him across the face with all strength she could muster. \"You think I slept with a man when my daughter was with me? Well this explains how my husband sees me in the real. A 'slut' of an actress. Right? Like a man on the street would.\" She spat in his face and turned to leave. David got up and held her elbow to stop her. Mia could see it in her eyes that he wanted desperately to have some answers, and she also knew that it wasn't his fault anyway. \"How am I to understand that? I don't know you at all. You won't tell me who this friend is and how much you two are close or—\" Mia looked him in the eye hoping internally to see regret for his comment but instead she saw anger and more accusations. Her insides flared again. She could not believe him. \"You may not know my past, but you know me well enough for the two years of our marriage, don't you? Have I ever asked you about all the small-town actresses you fucked when you were just an assistant in exchange for a scene in your boss' movie? Not only because I thought you changed. But because I trust you and the family we have built together. Why? Why are you so difficult?\" \"Because you don't tell me anything. I—please don't go right now. Just let me explain, I just want to-\" \"I told you everything that happened last night.\" \"No. I—\" \"I told you everything that happened last night.\" she repeated, without waiting to hear what he had to say. She didn't know why she was so angry at him. \"You don't need to know his name.\" \"Why?\" \"Because I don't need you to. Let him be. And I am taking Jessie with me to my parents'. I think it will be a good outing for her.\" Mia stated as she left to get ready. Thanks for reading! ","Summary":" Part one.

Była ona trochę na nią za krótka, ale jejnrodzina była bardzo biedna, więc musiała nosić rzeczy po starszymnrodzeństwie. -Gwyn, schodź wreszcie!- zawołał jej ojciec zndołu. Dziewczynka szybko zawiązała chustkę na włosach i zbliżyłansię do drabiny, po której zeszła na dół. Mieszkałanw małej chatce na skraju wioski razem z rodzicami i siedmiorgiemnrodzeństwa. Kiedy już znalazła się w małej izbie na dole,nzobaczyła Katy, jej starszą siostrę i matkę, któransiedziała na drewnianej ławie. -Kochanie, pośpiesz się.nMusicie iść na targ wcześnie, bo inaczej nie dostaniecie niczegonświeżego.- Powiedziała kobieta podając dziewczynce wiklinowynkoszyk. Ta wzięła go bez słowa i wyszła z chaty. To i tak wielkienszczęście, że mają za co kupić jedzenie. Już dawno nie były nantargu, a wszystko przez wysokie podatki, jakie nakładał na nichnKsiążę Jan. Po chwili z domku wyszła jej siostra. Ona teżnbyła ubrana bardzo skromnie, nawet jak na wieśniaczkę. Długienjasne włosy również schowała pod chustką. Zresztą wszyscynz ich rodziny byli wysocy i jasnowłosi. Wszyscy oprócz Gwyn,nktóra miała kasztanowe kręcone włosy i drobnąnposturę. Teraz Katy podeszła do niej i wzięła ją za rękę.nSzybkim krokiem ruszyły w stronę środka miasteczka, gdzienznajdował się targ. Jak zwykle było tam bardzo tłoczno ingwarno, przekupki przekrzykiwały się zachwalając swójntowar. Gwyn musiała trzymać się kurczowo siostry, gdyż nienchciała jej zgubić. Wszyscy wkoło byli dodatkowo podnieceni, gdyżnza miastem miał się tego dnia rozpocząć jarmark. Dziewczynkanciekawie rozglądała się dookoła, chcąc zobaczyć te wszystkienrzeczy, o których opowiadało jej rodzeństwo. Tymczasem Katynbyła zajęta targowaniem się o dobra cenę, a była w tym naprawdęndobra. Wiedziała, że jeśli jej się uda, jej rodzina zje dziś nankolację jakieś mięso. Nie mogła zwracać uwagi na siostrę, wiecnzabrała jej koszyk i poleciła się nie oddalać. Gwyn nie mogłannic poradzić na to, ze była tak ciekawa świata, w dodatku tłumnoderwał ją od siostry. Była zbyt słaba by nie oddalić się podnjego naporem. Wkrótce znalazła się na skraju targu i wśródnmasy kolorowych strojów tych wszystkich ludzi straciłanzupełnie orientację. Wiedziała, że już nie znajdzie siostry,nwiec postanowiła wrócić do domu. Odeszła w stronę,ngdzie było mniej ludzi i zaczęła błąkać się po mieście. Ponkrótkim czasie była nie tylko przestraszona, ale takżenzmęczona i głodna. Właśnie wtedy doszła do polan za wioską.nLudzie wokół kręcili się niespokojnie ustawiając różnennamioty i ogrodzenia. Gwyn domyśliła się, że trafiła na miejscenprzygotowań do jarmarki. W oddali zobaczyła chłopcównstrzelających do tarcz. Większość była młoda, mogli miećnnajwięcej 18 lat, ale znalazło się również kilkoro dziecini dorosłych. Dziewczyna stwierdziła, że kilku jest całkiemndobrych, mimo, że byli w jej wieku. Szkoda, że ojciec musi oraćnpole, zamiast uczestniczyć w turniejach.- Pomyślała i spojrzałanjeszcze raz na strzelających.- Nawet ja byłabym lepsza odnniektórych z nich, mimo, że nigdy nie trzymałam w rękunłuku. Stała cały czas nieruchomo i nie zauważyła ruchu intumultu za nią. W ostatniej chwili ktoś pociągnął ją do tyłu,na w miejscu gdzie stała pojawił się olbrzymi wierzchowiec.nMężczyzna dosiadający go był bardzo bogato ubrany, miał u bokunpowieszony miecz. Musiał być kimś ważnym. -Uważaj jak lezieszndziewucho!- Warknął w jej stronę, a ona poczuła, że robi sięnczerwona. Nagle ktoś kto ją uratował znowu pociągnął ją i ponchwili oboje znaleźli się z dala od pochodu, w którymnuczestniczył dostojny jeździec. Dopiero wtedy mogła się odwrócićni zobaczyć kto to był. Okazało się, że uratował ją okołonczternastoletni chłopiec. Ubrany niewiele lepiej od niej, na plecachnmiał zawieszone dwa łuki i kołczan z masą strzał. -Co ty tunrobiłaś, mała?- spytał wesoło.- Nie powinnaś się pętać nantej drodze, ktoś łatwo mógł cię stratować! -Nie twojansprawa co ja tu robię!- Obruszyła się Gwyn, w którejnobudziła się nieznana wcześniej nuta.- I nie jestem wcale mała!nNazywam się Gwyn. -Jasne, mała. Ja jestem Christopher, możesznmówić do mnie Chris. Ale raczej nie spotyka się małychndziewczynek na turniej łucznictwa... -Turniej łucznictwa...?-njej oczy stały się wielkie jak spodki. Więc to dlatego ci chłopacyntyle ćwiczyli. Och jak ona by chciała być jednym z nich. Nienmusiała by nosić sukienek, no i mogłaby się nauczyćnwalczyć. -Tak, właśnie na niego przyjechałem.- Powiedział jejnchłopak.- Trenowałem od kilku lat i muszę go wygrać! I ta nigdynnie będę nigdy tak dobry jak Robin... -Jak kto?- spytała Gwyn,nktórą wcześniej nie interesowały takie sprawy. Rodzice nienmogli sobie pozwolić na trening ich starszego syna, a co dopiero onanmogłaby marzyć aby się nauczyć strzelać. Nie znała więcnżadnych opowieści z tym związanych. -Robin Hood oczywiście!nNigdy o nim nie słyszałaś?- spytał spoglądając na niąnzdziwiony. –To najlepszy łucznik na świecie, zanim musiałnopuścić kraj, mieszkał w lesie i rabował bogaczy, by oddawać tonbiednym. Chciałbym być taki jak on.- Popatrzył przez chwilę wndal, jakby nad czym się zastanawiając, a dziewczynka onieśmielonanjego wielkimi słowami, bała się przerwać ciszę. W końcu Chrisnocknął się i spojrzał na nią. -Na możesz tu być? Twoinrodzice nie będą się niepokoić? Gwyn już miała powiedzieć,nże się zgubiła i poprosić aby pomógł jej znaleźć drogęndo domu, ale coś ją powstrzymało. -Nie, przyszłam tu popatrzyćnjak strzelają z łuku. Ja...- zająknęła się, nie wiedząc, czynto co powie nie wyda mu się głupie. – Ja... też chciałabym taknstrzelać... gdybym miała łuk. Chłopak nie roześmiał się.nSpojrzał tylko na nią badawczym wzrokiem i po chwili zrobił cosnniespodziewanego. Zdjął z siebie jeden ze swoich łuków inpodał go dziewczynie. -Rozumiem cię mała. Pewnie twoja rodzinannie ma lekko i chciałabyś wygrać te pieniądze, co? Spojrzałanna niego. Więc w turnieju można wygrać pieniądze? Jak by tonpomogło jej rodzinie! -Jak będziesz dużo ćwiczyć to możenkiedyś ci się uda- ciągnął dalej, dzieląc strzały na dwienczęści, po czym oddał jej te w kołczanie. -Masz. Dużo ćwiczni przyjdź tu za kilka lat! – powiedział i uniósł jejntwarz, gdyż spuściła przedtem głowę nie wiedząc co manpowiedzieć. -Dziękuję- wyjąkała nieśmiało, po czym znowunspuściła wzrok. -No, mała idź już, bo twoi rodzice na pewnonumrą z niepokoju. -Dobra.- stwierdziła obracając się w stronęnwioski i ruszając biegiem. Gdy była już dość daleko, odwróciłansię jeszcze i zobaczywszy, że chłopak stoi bez ruchu, machającnjej na pożegnanie, krzyknęła tylko: -I nie jestem mała!- ponczym pobiegła do domu. Znalezienie drogi powrotnej zajęłonjej sporo czasu więc gdy tylko stanęła przed nim, zaczynało sięnściemniać. Po drodze bała się kogokolwiek spytać o drogę, gdyżnniosła ze sobą łuk i strzały, a ktoś zobaczywszy je mógłbynpomyśleć, że je ukradła. I, choć oczywiście ona o tym nienwiedziała, łuk rzeczywiście był bardzo drogi. W oknach jejnchatki, paliły się światła, co było wielką rzadkością, bonświece były bardzo drogie i nie mogli sobie pozwolić na takienmarnotrawstwo. Weszła powoli do małej izby, gdzie czekała nannią cała rodzina. Jej matka siedziała na ławie i dziewczynienwydało się, że wcale z niej nie schodziła od jej wyjścia z domu.nKaty obejmowała kobietę, która zalewała się łzami. Ojciecnnatomiast opierał się o palenisko z lewej strony izby. Gdy weszła,nwszyscy zamarli Matka chciała się zerwać by wziąć ja w objęcia,nale mąż jej nie pozwolił. Podszedł do Gwyn i wrzasnął: -Gdzieżeśnty była? Tak się mart...- nagle urwał, gdyż zobaczył łuknzawieszony przez jej ramię. W pierwszej sekundzie przemknął munprzez myśl obraz dwóch osób, które tak jak onanteraz, zawsze tak nosiły łuk... Jego najlepszych przyjaciół,nktórych pewnie już nigdy nie zobaczy... Ale potem sięnopanował i wezbrała w nim złość.- Skąd to masz? Ukradłaś go innaraziłaś całą naszą rodzinę na gniew księcia? Wiesz, co grozinzłodziejom? Gwyn zadrżała mimo woli i skuliła się wnsobie. -Ja go nie ukradłam. -Nie? To skąd go masz? -Dostałamnod jakiegoś chłopaka, który przybył na turniejnłucznictwa... -Nie kłam!- wyszlochała matka, która dontej pory się nie odzywała. -Ale ja nie kłamię!- wybuchnęłanpłaczem i pobiegła na górę, najpierw zrzucając łuk nanpodłogę. Zdjęła z włosów zakurzoną chustkę i rzuciłansię na posłanie. Do pokoiku pod strzechą wspięły się równieżnjej siostry, które próbowały ją pocieszyć. Marrietnusiadła obok niej i chciała ją przytulić, ale ta jąnodepchnęła. -Po co ci ten łuk?- prychnęła Rosa, którannajbardziej nie lubiła Gwyn.- Strzelanie to zajęcie dla chłopców,na ty przecież jesteś dziewczynką! Na to dziewczyna zapłakałanjeszcze głośniej: -Dajcie mi spokój. Zaczęło sięnrobić późno, więc dziewczęta ułożyły się do snu. Gdynwszystkie zasnęły, tylko Gwyn nadal szlochała. Po jakimś czasie inona zaczęła się uspokajać. Gdy prawie zasypiała usłyszałanjeszcze tylko skrawek rozmowy na dole... -Myślisz, żennaprawdę ona go nie ukradła?- spytała kobieta. -Analys, wątpię,nżeby to zrobiła. Zawsze była taka szczera. -Więc co zamierzasznzrobić? – spytała z troską ocierając łzy. -Skoro już mamynten łuk, to go zatrzymamy... -Myślisz, że Damian mógłbynsię nauczyć strzelać? -Nie.- powiedział stanowczo mężczyzna.nPo czym pomyślał o rodzinie, która kiedyś powierzyła jegonopiece to dziecko. Wiedział, że to nastąpi prędzej czy później.nŻe jej prawdziwi rodzice po nią wrócą. A wtedy powinna byćnprzygotowana. – Jej prawdziwy ojciec chciałby, żeby to onannauczyła się strzelać. -Ale... Przecież on powierzył ją nam.nCzy naprawdę sądzisz, że kiedyś tu wróci? To my jąnwychowaliśmy! -Wiem, kochanie... Kiedy Gwyn tonusłyszała zamarła. Więc ona nie jest ich prawdziwym dzieckiem?nPrzygarnęli ją, ale czemu nic o tym nie wiedziała? I jej prawdziwanrodzina ma po nią wrócić? Ale kim oni są? I czemu jejnprawdziwy ojciec chciałby by nauczyła sięnstrzelać? Następnego dnia, ojciec powiedziałnjej, że może zatrzymać łuk. Reszta jej rodzeństwa bardzo sięnzdziwiła, szczególnie, że spodziewali się, że to Damian gondostanie. Jednak ojciec wystawił na podwórze prowizorycznąntarczę i polecił Gwyn ćwiczyć. Ta od razu chciała się do tegonzabrać, ale nie wiedziała jak. Nigdy wcześniej tego nie robiła.nPostanowiła, że najpierw poprosi Damiana, żeby jej pokazał, wnkońcu on prędzej będzie wiedział jak się do tego zabrać.nChłopak oderwał się od pracy na jej prośbę i z dozą pewnegonpowątpiewania wziął do ręki łuk i strzałę. Wycelował inwypuścił strzałę, ta jednak zamiast w tarczy, utkwiła w drzewienza nią. Gwyn pobiegła tam i wyciągnęła ją delikatnie, tak abynjej nie zniszczyć. Potem po kolei próbowały strzelićnwszystkie jej siostry, a nawet młodszy braciszek, którynciągle bawił się w rycerza. Ale on był jeszcze tak mały, żennawet nie zdołał naciągnąć cięciwy. W końcu Gwyn sięnzniecierpliwiła i zabrała mu łuk. -Nikt z was nie potrafi tegondobrze zrobić!- zdenerwowała się. -To ty strzel, jak jesteśntaka mądra!- krzyknęła jej siostra ze śmiechem. Gwyn wzięłando ręki łuk i wyciągnęła z kołczanu strzałę. Napięłancięciwę prawie do policzka, po czym próbując przypomniećnsobie dokładnie jak robili to ci chłopcy z turnieju, wycelowała inpuściła... Strzała trafiła w sam spód materiałunprowizorycznej tarczy. Dziewczyna spojrzała na o trochę zdziwiona.nNikomu z jej rodzeństwa nawet nie udało się trafić wnmateriał. Na to wszystko patrzył jej ojciec i przyznałnsobie rację. Ona jest do tego stworzona i nie można tego zmarnować.nPostanowił, że zaprowadzi ja do szkoły przyklasztornej, gdzienmnisi uczą młodych strzelać z łuku i walczyć. Na nic więcej nienmógł sobie pozwolić, ale dzięki temu dziewczyna strzelałannajlepiej w Anglii. Ucząc się, Gwyn poprzysięgła sobie, że dowiensię czyją tak naprawdę jest córką.[Chapter 2] Pochodzenie Gwynnnaciągnęła cięciwę i wycelowała. Przymknęła jedno oko,npodczas gdy drugie skierowało się na końcówkę strzały, wnktórą zamierzała trafić. Widziała ją tak, jakbynznajdowała się tuż przy jej oku, miała niesamowity wzrok, którynpodczas ostatnich kilku lat ćwiczeń bardzo się wyostrzył. Jużnmiała strzelić, kiedy usłyszała rozdzierający wrzask: -Gwyn!nGwyn! Zdekoncentrowana wypuściła strzałę o wiele za nisko,ntak, że trafiła w sam dół tarczy. Odwróciłanwściekła głowę i natrafiła spojrzeniem na młodego,nuśmiechającego się figlarnie mnicha, który właśnienwyszedł zza muru, do ogrodu koło klasztoru, gdzie zawszenćwiczyła. -Frodrick! Zobacz co zrobiłeś!- powiedziała śmiejącnsię dziewczyna. Właściwie dobrze, że jej się nie udało, gdyżnprzy swoim przyjacielu zawsze udawała, że jest od niegongorsza. -Patrz, pokaże ci jak to się robi- rzucił niedbalenwyciągając jej z ręki łuk i celując do tarczy. Po chwili strzałanwbiła się bardzo blisko czerwonego pola na środku tarczy. Chłopaknspojrzał na nią trochę speszony. Myślał, że strzał lepiej munwyjdzie. -Dzisiaj też coś ci nie idzie.- Stwierdziła Gwyn inusiadła na ławce stojącej pod ścianą aby odpocząć. Po chwilinobok niej usiadł Frodrick. -Ładnie wyglądasz- powiedziałnpatrząc na nią z podziwem. Dziewczyna nie speszyła się, gdyż byłnon jej przyjacielem i często mówił takie rzeczy. -Dziękuję,nczyżby to przez nową sukienkę?- zaśmiała się wstając inokręcając dookoła pokazując długą beżową suknię, któranchoć była skromna wyglądała na niej prześlicznie. -Ty wenwszystkim jesteś ładna- powiedział śmiertelnie poważnie. -Nawetnw tych starych szmatach, które musiałam nosić jakondziecko? -No pewnie. Ale teraz już nie musisz ich nosić. Odkądnktoś podrzucił na plebanię cały worek złota. -Tak...-ndziewczyna usiadła i zamyśliła się. No właśnie, ktoś dałnmnichom pieniądze właśnie wtedy gdy klasztor zaczął podupadać.nKto mógł to zrobić? W pobliskich wioskach od jakiegoś czasunktoś zaczął robić podobne rzeczy... Niektórzy nawetnmyśleli, że to sam Robin powrócił. Ale ona wątpiła w to,nsądziła, że cały ten Robin to tylko bajki dla dzieci i choć wnduszy chciałaby postępować dokładnie tak jak on, nie miała na tonwystarczającej odwagi. -Czemu zrobiłaś się smutna- znzamyślenia wyrwał ją głos Frodricka.- Nie powinnaś się smucićntylko śmiać- gdy to powiedział zaczął ją łaskotać i już ponchwili oboje tarzali się po sianie, leżącym nieopodal. Po parunminutach Frodrick przerwał i usiadł gwałtownie na ziemi. Gwynnteż usiadła i odgarnęła niesforne loki, które opadły nanjej twarz. Spojrzała na poważną twarz mnicha. Miał krótkonostrzyżone 'na grzybka' , brązowe włosy i szare oczy, którenteraz zrobiły się poważne. -Co się stało? -Nie jesteśmynjuż dziećmi- wyjaśnił wstając. -Od czasu gdy przybyłaś donklasztoru minęło siedem lat, nie możemy bawić się tak samo jaknwtedy. Skierował się w stronę swojego pokoju, dziewczyna poszłanza nim. Frodrick usiadła na łóżku, a Gwyn pozostała wndrzwiach. -Nie pożegnasz się ze mną?- spytała przekornienprzechylając głowę.- Dzisiaj wracam na weekend do domu. Chłopaknwstał lekko zdziwiony. -Zawsze jeździłaś tam dopiero wnsobotę. -Tak, ale dzisiaj chcę im zrobić niespodziankę. Wiesz,nKaty przyjedzie ze swoim mężem i dzieckiem. To mówiącnpocałowała mnicha w policzek i wybiegła roześmiana. Podążyłando stajni, gdzie czekał na nią jej koń, przygotowany do drogi.nSprawdziła jeszcze tylko czy w torbach przyczepionym do siodłanwszystko jest i wyruszyła w drogę. Od wioski, w którejnmieszkała jej rodzina dzieliło ją kilkadziesiąt minut jazdy, więcnpo około dwóch godzinach zobaczyła zarys domkównmiędzy drzewami. Szczęśliwa, że wraca do domu zeskoczyła z konianjeszcze daleko od chaty. Prowadziła go cicho chcąc jeszcze bardziejnzaskoczyć rodzinkę. Uśmiechała się już na myśl, jakie będąnmieli miny, kiedy usłyszała jakieś niepokojące dźwiękindochodzące z ich podwórka. Podeszła bliżej, starającnsię robić jak najmniej hałasu. Konia przywiązała do drzewu zandomem i wychyliła się za róg, żeby zobaczyć co sięndzieje. Scena nie była przyjemna. Przed jej domem stała cała jejnrodzina, oprócz drugiej starszej siostry, któranmieszkała z mężem w innej wiosce. Katy stała zaś przy płaczącejnmatce, trzymała na ręku niemowlę. W pierwszej chwili Gwynnchciała podbiec do nich i zapytać co się dzieje, ale potemnzrozumiała, że nie był to najlepszy pomysł. Zauważyła bowiem,nże na drodze koło ich chaty stało kilkoro ludzi. Niektórzynsiedzieli na wozie, inni na koniach. Jeden z nich był wyjątkowondostojnie ubrany- musiał być ważną osobistością. Wysunął sięnspośród swoich sług. Dziewczyna po uważniejszym przyjrzeniunstwierdziła, że już go kiedyś widziała! Tak to był tennmężczyzna z turnieju! -Czekam- zagrzmiał jego basowyngłos. -Dobrze wiesz, panie, że nie mamy z czego ci zapłacić.nTwoi ludzie zabrali nam resztę zboża w zeszłym miesiącu, jeślinoddamy ci wszystko pomrzemy z głodu.- Krzyknął ze złością jejnojciec. -Nic mnie to nie obchodzi. Książę Jan zwiększyłnpodatek, a ja, szeryf z Nottingam jestem wyznaczony aby tegondopilnować. Więc nie trać mojego czasu głupcze! Joseph spuściłntylko głowę, nie mógł pozwolić by jego dzieci nie miałynco jeść. Prędzej da się zamknąć w lochu niż do tegondoprowadzi. -Nie mam zboża- powtórzył. -A wiec dobrze,nskoro tego właśnie chcesz.- warknął szeryf, jak gdyby zadowolonynz siebie.- W takim razie zamiast zboża weźmiemy twoją najstarsząnniezamężną córkę. Służbą na dworze księcia Jana możenkiedyś spłaci wasz dług. Gwyn, tak samo jak jej rodzicenzamarła. Pierwszy odzyskał głos jej starszy brat. -Nie możesznjej zabrać, jest teraz w klasztorze! -Skoro tak weźmiemy tęnmłodszą.- wściekł się mężczyzna i skinął na swoich ludzi,nktórzy natychmiast zabrali wrzeszczącą i kopiącąndziewczynkę. Jej ojciec chciał coś zrobić, ale żona gonpowstrzymała. -I tak nic nie możemy zrobić- dosłyszałanGwyn. I co ona ma teraz zrobić?- myślała- Nie mogę pozwolićnby zabrali Rosę! Już miała się ukazać, żeby to ją zabralinzamiast siostry, ale nagle zauważyła, że matka na nią patrzy inbezgłośnie błaga: -Nie pokazuj się! Zawahała się i tennmoment wystarczył by słudzy księcia Jana odjechali. Wtedy wybiegłanzza muru i spojrzała po nich ze łzami w oczach. Byli trochęnzdziwieni jej widokiem, ale ona była zbyt wściekła, żeby się znnimi witać. -Jak mogliście na to pozwolić!- zawyła. –Mogłamntam pojechać zamiast niej! -Nie krzycz.- wyszeptała matkanocierając twarz chustą. Damian pociągnął ją do chaty. Ponchwili wszyscy usiedli w milczeniu w największej izbie. W Gwynnwszystko się gotowało, nie mogła siedzieć bezczynnie i patrzećnco tu się działo. W pewnym momencie jej ojciec chciał cośnpowiedzieć ale właśnie wtedy zerwała się z miejsca. -Nienpozwolę na to! Pojadę tam i sprowadzę ją z powrotem! -Nawetntak nie żartuj!- powiedział jej ojciec.- Nie wiesz do czego tennczłowiek jest zdolny... -Nie wiem? Może i tak, ale janprzynajmniej próbuje coś zmienić! -Wiedziałam, żenkiedyś do tego dojdzie- powiedziała cicho Analys.- że będzienchciała pójść w jego ślady... Dziewczyna spojrzała nanmatkę w niezrozumieniu. -W ślady kogo?- spytała przeczuwając,nże to co usłyszy zmieni wszystko. -Twojego prawdziwego ojca-nkobieta podniosła na nią wzrok, mówiąc dalej bez wahania-nRobin Hooda.[Chapter 3] Ruszeniendo akcji -Co?- Wyjąkała Gwyn. -To prawda- dodałnojciec.- Mieliśmy ci o tym kiedyś powiedzieć. Twoi prawdziwinrodzice zostawili cię pod naszą opieką abyś była bezpieczna.nDlatego nie mogliśmy pozwolić by zabrał cię KsiążęnJan. Dziewczyna tego nie słuchała, szumiało jej w głowie.nTeraz wszystko układało się w logiczną całość. To dlategonwtedy pozwolili jej zatrzymać łuk i chcieli, żeby nauczyła sięnstrzelać. Jej zaskoczenie bowiem nie wynikało z wieści, żenzostała adoptowana, ale z tego, kto był jej ojcem! A myślała,nże on nie istnieje naprawdę. -Dlatego nie pozwolę zrobić nicngłupiego, rozumiesz!- mężczyzna powiedział to tak stanowczo, żenGwyn spojrzała na niego. -Nie rozumiem.- szepnęła. -Nienudawaj. Dobrze cię znamy i wiem, że już planujesz jakby jąnstamtąd uwolnić. Dziewczyna zdziwiła się, gdyż właśnie ontym pomyślała. -Nie zrobisz tego- dodała matka.-nPrawda? -Oczywiście, że tego nie zrobi.- Dodał Damian.- Wróciszndo klasztoru, a tam mnisi cię przypilnują. To stwierdzenienprzesądziło sprawę. Gwyn wiedziała, że nie ma nawet condyskutować. Tego dnia w milczeniu zasiedli do kolacji. Dziewczynanbyła obrażona na rodzinę i zła, że nie może nic zrobić.nPrzynajmniej na razie... Kolejne dwa dni nie przyniosły poprawy,nale małżonkowie nie chcieli jej denerwować. Byli bowiemnprzekonani, że wstrząsnęła ją wiadomość, że nie jest ichnprawdziwym dzieckiem, no i ta sprawa z Rosą... W niedzielenwieczorem, nadal naburmuszona, Gwyn szykowała się do droginpowrotnej do klasztoru. Damian zastał ją w stajni, zakładającąnsiodło na swego czarnego wierzchowca. W rękach miał drugie siodło,nktóre założył na ich szkapę, której przeważnienużywali do pracy w polu, lub ciągnięcia powozu. -Dokąd sięnwybierasz?- spytała zdziwiona, wiedziała, że następnego dnia miałnpomagać na polu. -Ojciec kazał mi cię odstawić pod samnklasztor. -Chyba nie sądzisz, że zamierzam po drodze urwać sięni pojechać do Nottingam?- spytała z wściekłością. Nienzamierzała tego robić, ale nie znosiła być kontrolowana.- Nawetnja nie jestem na tyle głupia, by porywać się na Księcia beznżadnej broni. -Wolimy nie ryzykować co ci przyjdzie do głowy.-nzaśmiał się chłopak. Gwyn zrezygnowała z kłótni,nwiedziała, że to i tak nic nie da, a przynajmniej będzie miałanjakieś towarzystwo podczas drogi. Kiedy dojechali na miejsce byłnjuż wieczór. Na spotkanie wybiegł im Frodrick, którynnieco się zdziwił na widok Damiana. Brat dziewczyny zsiadł z koniani miał zamiar pójść do opata, żeby z nim porozmawiać, alenna szczęście Gwyn przejrzała jego plany. -A ty dokąd? Spytałankiedy skierował się z koniem w stronę budynku.- Jest już późno,njak chcesz zdążyć przed zmrokiem musisz natychmiastnwyruszyć. Damian lekko się zafrasował, naprawdę nie chciałnmartwić rodziców zbyt długą nieobecnością. -Musisz jużnjechać, prawda Frodrick?- dodała patrząc błagalnie nanmnicha. Ten, mimo, że nie wiedział o co chodzi skwapliwienprzytaknął, chcąc przypodobać się Gwyn. Ta uściskała więcnbrata, a on lekko osłupiały wsiadł na konia i odjechał. Frodricknnatomiast złapał za cugle konia Gwyn i razem skierowali się donstajni. -Co się stało, wyglądasz na zmartwioną?- Powiedział,nzajmując się zwierzęciem. Gwyn oparła się o ścianę stajni inopowiedziała mu o tym co się wydarzyło. -A wiesz, co jestnnajgorsze?- spytała na koniec.- To, że walczymy między sobąnzamiast razem przeciwko Księciu Janowi. -Nie możesz tak mówić,noni się po prostu o ciebie boją. A ty się nie boisz? -Nie. Nienchcę bać się niczego, nie chcę być niewolnicą własnegonstrachu. A ty? Wolisz, żeby to życie tobą zawładnęło? Ja chcęnsama kierować własnym losem. -Może jestem zbyt wielkimntchórzem...- odpowiedział tylko Frodrick. Oboje udali sięnna spoczynek, ale tylko mnich położył się spać. Gwyn siedziałanprzed lustrem przyglądając się swojemu odbiciu, które lekkonmigotało w blasku świec. Jej długie kręcone włosy opadały nanramiona sięgając aż do pasa. Gdybym nie była kobietąnpozwolili by mi ją uwolnić.- Myślała.- Gdybym była chłopcemnojciec nie zostawił by mnie tutaj tylko zabrał ze sobą... To jąnzdenerwowało jeszcze bardziej. Przecież też dużo potrafi. Strzelano wiele lepiej niż niejeden najlepszy łucznik. W dodatku świetnienjeździ na koniu. Ostatni raz spojrzała na swoje włosy, potem nansuknię. I w końcu coś w niej pękło. Otworzyła szkatułkęnleżącą na stoliku i wyciągnęła z niej nożyce, którychnużywała do szycia. Z determinacją wymalowaną na twarzy ścięłanpierwsze pukle, które upadały na podłogę wokoło niej. Ponkilku minutach miała włosy sięgające ramion. Przez chwilenwydawało jej się, że głowa stała się dziwnie lekka. Ale nienmiała teraz czasu, żeby przyglądać się sobie. Chwyciła za łukni pobiegła do pokoju Frodricka. Chłopak był mniej więcej tejnsamej budowy co ona, więc jego ubranie na nią pasowało. Najciszejnjak tylko zdołała wyjęła ciuchy z szuflady i włożyła nansiebie. Właśnie zawiązywała buty, kiedy usłyszała jakiśnszmer. Frodrick spał tej nocy dość niespokojnie i obudził sięngdy tylko usłyszał skrzypnięcie drzwi. Leżał plecami do ściany,nwięc nie mógł widzieć kto wszedł. Zdenerwowany inprzerażony chwycił za swój krótki nóż.nZacisnął powieki by po chwili wstać i rzucić się na napastnika.nJuż miał zamachnąć się na 'niego' nożem, gdynzobaczył... -Gwyn! Co ty tu robisz?- Zawołał zduszonym głosem.-nI coś ty narobiła!- Dotknął jej krótkich włosów,nopadających na twarz. -Musiałam wziąć twoje ubranie, żebynwyglądać jak mężczyzna.- Wyszeptała.- Nie mogę tego taknzostawić. Powiesz opatowi co się stało. Przełożyła łuknprzez ramię i wybiegła, zanim chłopak zdążył jąnpowstrzymać. Mnich zamarł na chwilę, a potem wziął do rękinubranie i wybiegł za nią w samej koszulinie, ubierając się pondrodze. -Hej, Gwyn... Poczekaj na mnie.[Chapter 4] Nieoczekiwane spotkanie i przyjazdndo Nottingham Nastawałnświt i niebo nad drzewami w ciemnym lesie zaczęło nabieraćnbłękitnego koloru. Gwyn jechała bez wytchnienia, ale nie byłanzmęczona. Raczej podniecona i przerażona tym co zrobiła. Nienspodziewała się, że kiedykolwiek to zrobi i co najdziwniejsze- żenpójdzie jej tak łatwo. Teraz jednak zaczęła rozmyślaćno tym w co się wpakowała i wszystko nabrało o wiele czarniejszychnbarw. Ucieczka nie była zaplanowana. Nie miała więc ze sobą aninubrań, ani jedzenia. W dodatku nawet nie zjadła nic przed wyjściem.nPieniędzy też nie miała, a za coś musiała kupić jedzenie.nKradzież od razu wykluczyła- co innego obrabować bogaczy by daćnbiednym, ale żeby robić to przez własną głupotę? No, ale teraznona też była biedna... Gwyn postanowiła, że jeśli jej sięnuda to zarobi trochę uczciwą pracą... Zresztą na razie musinznaleźć się na miejscu i dowiedzieć co stało się z Rose.nDopiero wtedy będzie zastanawiać się jak długo tam zostanie i wnjaki sposób uratuje siostrę. Tak rozmyślającnprzemierzała powoli lasy Sherwood, zbliżając się coraz bardziejndo Nottingham. Z każdej strony otaczały ją drzewa, nanniektórych siedziały ptaszki śpiewając radośnie. Tymczasem w oddali, zza krzaków, obserwowała ją jakaśnpostać ubrana cała na zielono, z twarzą zasłoniętą kapturem. Pondłuższym zastanowieniu osoba ta podążyła za dziewczyną. Ponjakimś czasie Gwyn usłyszała w pobliżu plusk strumyka i pojechałantam chcąc zaspokoić pragnienie. Konia przywiązała na wzgórzu,na sama zeszła nieco w dolinkę strumienia. Nie zdążyła nawetnuklęknąć by nabrać wody na ręce, kiedy ktoś zwalił się na niąni razem przewałkowali się po ziemi. Po krótkiej szamotaninienGwyn leżała rozpłaszczona na ziemi, podczas gdy jej przeciwniknsiedział na niej przytrzymując za ręce. Spojrzała na niego znwyzwaniem w oczach. Podczas szamotaniny z głowy spadł mu kaptur interaz widziała dokładnie jego młodą twarz. Miał brązowe włosynopadające na czoło i brązowe oczy. W pewnym momencie wydał jejnsię nawet znajomy... Mężczyzna przyjrzał się jej i zdziwionynwstał pociągając ją za sobą i stawiając na nogi. -Najmocniejnprzepraszam. Nie widziałem, że jesteś dziewczyną...- powiedziałnzmieszany. Gwyn wściekła otrzepała się z trawy. -Ach tak. -No, nie poznałem w pierwszej chwili, jesteś ubrana jaknchłopak.- próbował się tłumaczyć, ale to ją jeszczenbardziej zezłościło. -A innych to już można atakować? -Tonbardzo niebezpieczne miejsce, nie powinnaś podróżowaćnsama.- Odparł tylko. -Taa, jasne. Nie mam teraz czasu na takiengadanie. Jeśli rezygnujesz z ograbienia mnie, co zresztą fortuny intak by ci nie przysporzyło, to jadę dalej- warknęła i skierowałansię w stronę konia. Kiedy wsiadła na niego zobaczyła, że chłopaknposzedł za nią. -Dokąd jedziesz, jeśli można spytać? -DonNottingham.- Powiedziała dziewczyna zawracając wierzchowca nandrogę. -To może się tam spotkamy.- krzyknął za nią, ale nienzdążyła spytać się dlaczego. Była godzina dziewiąta,nkiedy na drodze do Nottingham natrafiła na wioskę. Zmęczenie ingłód zaczęło powoli dawać o sobie znać. Zostawiła konianna skraju miasta i poszła na targ aby się rozejrzeć- w końcunnigdy tu nie była. Rozglądała się ciekawie dookoła, patrząc nanżycie mieszkańców, chłopki kłócące się o cośnzażarcie i dzieci biegające między kupującymi. W pewnym momencienzauważyła jakiegoś szlachcica kupującego warzywa. Tak naprawdęnto on tylko chodził rozglądając się po targu napuszony jak paw inpokazywał sługom, co chce kupić. Mieli już oni ze sobą kilkanwypchanych skórzanych toreb, ale nie one najbardziej rzucałynsię w oczy. Tym na co ludzie zwracali uwagę był bogaty- jaskrawonczerwony strój szlachcica. Jakieś małe wymizerowanendzieci również zwróciły na niego uwagę. Musiały byćnnaprawdę zdesperowane, bo wsadziły rączki do torby jednego ze sługnpróbując wyciągnąć coś do jedzenia. Możnowładca tonzobaczył i pochwycił chłopca krzycząc: -Złodziej! Pójdziesznza to siedzieć w lochach! Gwyn, która sama była głodna,nnie mogła na to patrzeć i znowu, nawet się nie zastanawiającnzaczęła działać. Podeszła do szlachcica i popchnęła go,nuwalniając małego chłopca, który natychmiast skorzystał zensposobności i uciekł. -Zostaw go, to tylko głodne dziecko. -Tonzłodziej, który powinien zostać ukarany!- Wrzasnął na nią,na potem zwrócił się do swoich sług: -Łapcie, go! -Nie!nPrzecież nic nie zabrał. Twoja żona jest magnatką, a ciebie nienobchodzi los tych dzieci! Chciałeś złodzieja? To go masz!-nkrzyknęła jednocześnie wyrywając słudze magnata torby inuciekając. Biegła najszybciej jak tylko mogła wymijając po drodzenludzi. Za sobą słyszała kroki goniących ją strażników. Wnpewnym momencie wypadła z jednej z bram i prawie zderzyła się znFrodrickiem, który stał tam ze swoim koniem. -Gwyn, conty... -Nie teraz- zdążyła tylko rzucić i skryła się zanzałomem muru. Ale już po chwili błądząc uliczkami powróciłando osłupiałego mnicha. Wsiadając na jego konia, powiedziała. -Mójnkoń jest przywiązany za miastem, weź go. Spotkamy się za północnąnbramą. Popędziła na złamanie karku, ale w końcu zdobyłanprzewagę nad goniącymi ją pieszo strażnikami i udało jej sięnich zgubić. Dla pewności odczekała trochę czasu ukryta wnkapliczce, po czym udała się na spotkanie. Po drodze rzuciła jednąnz toreb głodnym dzieciom, a kiedy odjeżdżała zdołała usłyszećnjak za nią wołają: -Robin Hood! Robin Hood! Gdy dotarła donpółnocnej bramy i zobaczyła Frodricka, zeskoczyła z konia inrzuciła mu się na szyję. Pocałowała go w policzek i ruszyli wnstronę lasu. Tam usiedli na jakiejś polance i posilali się tym conGwyn ukradła. -Cieszę się, że za mną przyjechałeś-npowiedziała Gwyn z pełną buzią. -Naprawdę?- spytałnmnich. -Naprawdę. Przecież sama nie poradziłabym sobie wnuwolnieniu siostry. -To nie oznacza, że masz kraść. Nienpowinnaś była tego robić. -Sumienie ci wraca, kiedy masz pełnynbrzuch?- zaśmiała się dziewczyna w myśli nadal słysząc krzyknuszczęśliwionych dzieci. Uznały ją za Robina, jej ojca. Więcnjest do niego chociaż trochę podobna. -Poza tym to podatkinKsięcia Jana powodują, że ludzie nie mają możliwości nakarmićnwłasnych dzieci. To on jest złodziejem, nie oni czy ja. -Naprawdęnsię cieszysz, że za tobą pojechałem?- spytał po raz kolejnynchłopak, a gdy dziewczyna to usłyszała zaczęła się krztusićnchlebem. Odchrząknęła i wstała. -Naprawdę. A teraz ruszajmy,naby dostać się do Nottingham przed południem. Wyruszyli dośćnprędko, nie chcieli bowiem kusić losu i spotkać jakichś ludzi znwioski. Dzięki temu dostali się do miasta bardzo szybko.[Chapter 5] Wygrana i kolejne tajemnice Przyjacielenpo drodze cały czas zastanawiali się jak uratować siostrę Gwyn.nMieli w sumie tylko dwie możliwości. Albo odnajdą ją i 'porwą',nalbo ją wykupią. Pierwsze wyjście wydawało się bardziej możliwendo wykonania, chociaż mogło ściągnąć na ich rodzinę zemstęnszeryfa Nottingham. Natomiast wykupienie wręcz nie wchodziło w grę,ngdyż nie mieli pieniędzy, a nawet gdyby, to czy szeryf zgodziłbynsię? Jeszcze bardziej od pieniędzy- lubił znęcać się nadnludźmi, więc mógłby odmówić, byle tylko cierpiałanna tym jej rodzina. Kiedy dojechali wreszcie na miejscenpostanowili najpierw się rozejrzeć i poznać miasto. Tym razem Gwynnnie patrzyła na wszystko tak dokładnie, gdyż nie chciała znowunzrobić czegoś głupiego, co udaremniłoby jej plany. Frodricknnie miał takich zahamowań i wydawało się, ze za chwilę dostanienoczopląsu. W pewnym momencie, jakiś sprzedawca wychylił się zzanprowizorycznego stołu, na którym miał wyłożony towar inzaczepił Gwyn. -Hej, łuczniku. Jeśli się nie spieszysz to zanmiastem organizują turniej łucznictwa.- To mówiąc podałnjej pergamin. Dziewczyna spojrzała na niego. I nagle doznałanolśnienia. -Frodrick, idziemy tam! -Na ten turniej? Myślałem,nże mamy ratować twoją siostrę... -Oczywiście- Gwynnpociągnęła mnicha szybciej na skraj miasta.- Nagrodą w tymnturnieju jest worek złota... i uczestnictwo w uczcie na zamkunszeryfa! -Więc...- zawahał się chłopak.- Ale, nawet jeśli...nNie mogę ci zagwarantować, że wygram! Poza tym brałem udziałntylko w turnieju koło klasztoru... -Nie marudź, nikt ci nie każenstartować.- uśmiechnęła się. Trudno, będzie musiała sięnzdradzić. Jej siostra jest ważniejsza od dobrego samopoczucianFrodricka. -Przecież zawsze z tobą wygrywałem.- Mnich zatrzymałnsię i pokiwał głową z powątpiewaniem. Dziewczyna odwróciłansię i pociągnęła go za sobą. -Tylko wtedy gdy ci na tonpozwoliłam.- rzuciła wprawiając go w zdumienie. Właśnie doszlindo końca miasta i znaleźli się na otwartym terenie, na którymnstały rozłożone namioty i tory do strzelania. Tłumek ludzi zebrałnsię na prowizorycznych trybunach, odgrodzonych od zawodnikównpłotkiem. Łucznicy przygotowywali się, niektórzy strzelali,ninni właśnie się zapisywali w małym namiociku nieopodal.nDziewczyna skierowała się w tamtą stronę. -Ty nas zapiszesz.-nszepnęła mu do ucha.- Jestem twoim bratem... Wilfredemnz Locksley. W środku stał mały stoliczek, za którymnsiedział mężczyzna. Miał przed sobą rolkę pergaminu inpióro. Kogo mam zapisać?- spytał spoglądając na nichnspode łba. -Jestem Frodrick z... Locksley, a to mój bratnWilfred. -Brat?- mruknął człowiek pisząc ich nazwiska niezbytnczytelną minuskułą. Zapisani, poszli na miejsce, gdzie zbieralinsię inni zawodnicy. Byli to mężczyźni, niektórzy starsi,nzdarzali się też chłopcy kilkunastoletni. Gwyn usiadła nandrewnianej ławie i rozejrzała się po polu, osłaniając oczy rękąnprzed słońcem, oceniając swoje możliwości co do panującychnwarunków. Słońce na szczęście świeciło w plecynstrzelającym, nie było wiatru. Pogoda wręcz idealna nanturniej. Frodrick trochę się denerwował widząc tylundoświadczonych łuczników i nie mógł usiedzieć. Conchwilę się podrywał, stawał, napinał cięciwę, jakby chciałnćwiczyć, ale po chwili się rozmyślił i ponownie usiadł. W końcunzniecierpliwiło to dziewczynę, która pociągnęła go nanmiejsce. W tym samym czasie ktoś ich uważnie obserwował. I nienbyła to bynajmniej jedna osoba. W końcu na miejscu zjawił sięnszeryf, który miał sędziować i herold ogłosił rozpoczęcienturnieju. -Oto pokaz strzeleckich umiejętności! Każdy możenobejrzeć najlepszych strzelców z całej Anglii! Pachołkowienustawili tarcze na najbliższą odległość do pierwszejnrundy. -Osoby, które wyczytam, będą strzelać do tarcz.nCi, którzy nie trafią w czerwone pole na środku, odpadają.nNa początek: 50 kroków!- zagrzmiał jego tubalny głos. Gwynnpoczuła czyjś oddech w uchu. -Wiedziałem, że się spotkamy-nusłyszała znajomy głos i momentalnie się odwróciła. Zannią stał chłopak z lasu. Nie odezwała się ani słowem inodwróciła głowę w stronę strzelających, którzynwłaśnie się ustawili. Na znak dany przez herolda wypuścilinpierwszą serię strzał. Trafili prawie wszyscy. Nagle dziewczynanw tłumie gapiów zobaczyła kolejną tego dnia tajemnicząnpostać. Był to człowiek ubrany w długi płaszcz, któregonkaptur miał daleko nasunięty na twarz. Po sylwetce niewiele dałonsię odgadnąć, chyba jedyne, to, że nie była to kobieta. Postaćnwydawała się przyglądać badawczo wszystkim uczestnikom, a wnszczególności Gwyn. Jednak gdy ta go dostrzegła, człowieknwycofał się w tłum. -William z Nottingham! Zygfryd znWinchester! Frodrick z Locksley! Wilfred z Locksley! Ustawili sięni oddali strzały. Wszyscy trafili. Po nich startował ten chłopaknz lasu, ale Gwyn była zbyt zajęta uspokajaniem Frodricka by zwrócićnna niego uwagę. Zresztą on też przeszedł do następnejnrundy. -Druga tura! Strzelacie z odległości 60 kroków! Tymnrazem pozostało kilku łuczników mniej. Następnienstrzelali z odległości 70 kroków. Było już ich tyle, żenGwyn strzelała razem z nieznajomym. Znowu zauważyła tegonzakapturzonego w tłumie, ale starała się nie rozpraszać i napięłancięciwę. Po kolejnym udanym strzale podszedł do niej tamtennchłopak. -Nieźle strzelasz... Wilfred? -Nic ci do tego jaknmam na imię.- odburknęła. W następnej rundzie nie działo sięnjuż tak dobrze, ponieważ odpadł Frodrick. Zrezygnowany usiadł nanławie, mając minę jakby od tego strzału zależały losynświata. -Nie przejmuj się- pocieszyła go dziewczyna. Nie mogłanjednak okazać mu za dużo uczucia, bo przecież udawałanchłopaka. Teraz została ich już tylko garstka najlepszych. -Proszę oddalić tarcze o 90 kroków!- Usłyszelinkrzyk. Strzelali wszyscy za jednym razem. Oprócz Gwyn innieznajomego, zostało jeszcze troje mężczyzn. Jeden z nich byłnśredniego wzrostu, ze śladem zarostu na twarzy. Zanim się ustawilinprzejechał dłonią po włosach patrząc z powątpiewaniem na swoichnprzeciwników, jakby był pewny wygranej. Strzelili. Niestetynto nie był jeszcze koniec. Zostali we troje- Gwyn, pyszałek innieznajomy. Zanim zdążyli ustawić się do strzału z odległościn100 kroków, usłyszeli kroki. To szeryf do nichnpodszedł. -Zmieniamy trochę zasady- powiedział uśmiechającnsię. Widocznie zaczynało mu się nudzić. -Teraz wszyscynstrzelają po kolei do tej samej tarczy, a który z was trafinnajbliżej środka wygrywa. Pierwszy strzelił 'Pyszałek'.nNiestety nie poszczęściło mu się, trafił w samo obrzeżenczerwonego pola. Potem był 'Nieznajomy'. Gdy jego strzała wbiłansię w słomę tarczy z widowni rozległ się aplauz. Jego strzałnutkwiła w samiuteńkim środku czerwonego kółka. -Chybanmamy zwycięzcę!- powiedział szeryf zadowolony, że to jużnwreszcie koniec. -Chwila! Jeszcze ja nie strzela..łem.- wyrwałansię Gwyn wściekła, że ją pominięto. -Chyba nie sądzisz...nchłopczyku..., że uda ci się strzelić lepiej od niego?- warknąłnPyszałek, zły na cały świat za swoją porażkę. Najwidoczniejnuznał, że poniżenie innego przegranego poprawi mu humor. Gwynnjuż chciała coś odpowiedzieć, kiedy odezwał się bardzonrozweselony szeryf. -Chyba możemy pozwolić mu strzelić. A nużnmu się uda?- w jego głosie było słychać wyraźnąnkpinę. Dziewczyna zawzięta stanęła naprzeciw tarczy. Napięłanłuk i wycelowała. Całą uwagę skupiła na koniuszku strzałynwbitej w tarczę. Tylko przez chwilę dostrzegała to co jest za nią,npóźniej już widziała tylko drewno i kawałek lotki, prawientak jakby była tuż przed jej oczami. Skupiła się maksymalnie,nwytężając wszystkie mięśnie. Czas jakby się zatrzymał kiedynpuściła cięciwę. Strzała wydawała się mknąć dosłownie nanjej oczach, wibrując w powietrzu. Po paru setnych sekundy, którendla Gwyn wydały się wiecznością, strzała przebiła się w samnśrodek poprzedniej, rozcinając ją na dwie połówki. Wszyscynzamarli, by potem rozbrzmieć kakofonią wrzasków. Dziewczynanuśmiechnęła się triumfująco, po czym rzuciła się na szyjęnFrodrickowi, który stał koło niej oniemiały, nie patrzyłannawet na to, czy ktoś uzna jej zachowanie za dziwne. Nieznajomynnie dołączył do głośnego aplauzu, ani nie urągał jej tak jaknPyszałek. Wycofał się z tłumu i po chwili spotkał się w lekkimnoddaleniu z zakapturzonym człowiekiem.[Chapter 6] Spotkanie z ojcem Ludzienklaskali i gwizdali na cześć Gwyn. Przez to wszystko aż zakręciłonjej się w głowie. Tylko dzięki Frodrickowi jakoś udało jej sięnwymknąć z tłumu. Herold zdołał przekrzyczeć wrzawę i oznajmił,nże nagrodę otrzyma podczas uczty na zamku, która miałanodbyć się wieczorem, o ósmej. Przyjaciele postanowili dontego czasu zastanowić się co dalej. Najlepszym miejscem do zebranianmyśli wydał się Gwyn las, dlatego tam pojechali. Gdy tylkonmiasteczko znikneło z horyzontu, a oni znaleźli się wśródndrzew, od razu zsiedli z koni. Już mieli rozsiąść się na trawie,nkiedy zewsząd otoczyli ich ludzie. Ubrani byli w różnenodcienie zieleni, tak, że prawie wtapiali się w las, którynich otaczał. Niektórzy z nich mieli łuki, inni kusze. Chybanżaden nie był bezbronny. Gwyn i Frodrick znaleźli się w kręgu,nrozglądali się przestraszeni. W dwójkę nie poradzą sobie zntaką hałastrą. Do wnętrza kręgu weszło dwóchnmężczyzn. W jednym z nich dziewczyna od razu rozpoznałannieznajomego mężczyznę z turnieju, natomiast ten drugi... To onnprzypatrywał jej się z tłumu. Teraz stojąc przed nią odrzuciłnkaptur. Zobaczyła przed sobą mężczyznę w średnim wieku. Włosynmiał brązowe, choć już przyprószone siwizną, ale tondodawało mu powagi. Twarz miał ogorzałą od słońca, zupełnienjakby wrócił z jakiegoś egzotycznego kraju, bo niemożliwe,nżeby opalił się tak w mglistej Anglii. -Więc to jest... tennWilfred? Mistrz łuczników?- spytał wesoło, bez cieniankpiny. Przez chwilę Gwyn wydawało się, że dostrzegła w jegonzielonych oczach pytanie o coś czego nie mogłanzinterpretować. Odgarnęła włosy z twarzy zastanawiając sięnnad odpowiedzią. -No, dziewczyno. Zdradź nam wreszcie swojenprawdziwe imię- powiedział łagodnie. Gwyn spojrzała na niego zenzdumieniem. -Wiesz, ja też z daleka nie rozpoznałem w tobienkobiety, ale mój przyjaciel mnie nieco uświadomił.-npowiedział, a wokół rozległy się śmiechy. Dziewczynanspojrzała na niego, ale on odwrócił wzrok, jakby chciałnpowiedzieć, że to nie jego wina. -Zanim się przedstawię,nchciałabym wiedzieć z kim mam do czynienia. -Właśnie!- wtrąciłnsię Frodrick.- Ja też bym chciał wiedzieć dlaczego na nasnnapadliście! Z kręgu wysunął się gruby mężczyzna onprzyjaznej powierzchowności, ubrany w strój mnicha. -Nienzamierzamy zrobić ci krzywdy- powiedział. -Zresztą mogę sięnprzedstawić.- dodał tamten.- Dama, która strzela tak dobrzenjak ja, powinna wiedzieć z kim rozmawia. Jestem Robin Hood. Gwynnwybałuszyła oczy. To jest... jej ojciec. Zrobiło jej się słabo,nale jakoś zdołała ustać na nogach. Teraz przynajmniej nie musinsię obawiać... -Jesteś TYM Robinem?- spytał równienoszołomiony Frodrick. -Owszem. Czyżbyś o mnie słyszał?-nzaśmiał się mężczyzna. Frodrick był jednak zbyt podniecony,nżeby wyksztusić coś więcej. 'Na całe szczęście'- pomyślałandziewczyna. -Dobra. Jeśli chcecie wiedzieć, nazywam się...-nwzięła głęboki oddech i wreszcie to wykrztusiła- Gwynneth znLocksley. Pośród zebranych rozległ się szmer, wszyscynspojrzeli na pobladłą teraz dziewczynę. -O Boże- wyjąkałnRobin. Po czym nie bacząc na wszystkich zebranych wokółnprzyciągnął ją do siebie i przytulił. -Córeczko.[Chapter 7] W lesie Sherwood W tejnchwili Gwyn poczuła się bardzo dziwnie. W sumie był dla niej obcymnczłowiekiem, a teraz przytulał ją jakby znał ją od zawsze. Alenjej to nie przeszkadzało. Chociaż pewnie byłoby inaczej, gdyby nienwiedziała tego wcześniej. Ale w takim wypadku nie przedstawiłabynsię Gwynneth z Locksley tylko z Doncaster. Po chwili, gdy wreszcienwypuścił ją z objęć, zobaczyła łzy w jego oczach. -Yhm.-ngruby mnich przerwał tę wiekopomną chwilę.- Robinie, czy niensądzisz, że powinniśmy wrócić do naszej kryjówki,ngdzie będziesz mógł swobodnie porozmawiać zncórką? -Oczywiście, dziękuję Tuck za twójnrozsądek. Jeszcze trochę i jacyś ludzie nas zobaczą. -Zaraz,nczy to daleko?- wtrąciła się dziewczyna.- Muszę na wieczórnzdążyć do Nottingham... Inaczej nie uratuję Rosy. Mężczyznanprzyjrzał się jej uważnie. -Kto to jest Rosa i co jej sięnstało? -To moja siostra... przyrodnia- dodała niepewnie.-nZostała zabrana przez szeryfa z Nottingham, kiedy ojciec nie mógłnzapłacić kolejnego bezpodstawnie zażądanego podatku.- Wypiekinpojawiły się na jej twarzy, kiedy mówiła o tymnznienawidzonym człowieku. Robin zafrasował się nieco. -BiednynJoseph– powiedział jakby do siebie.- Nie martw się, cośnwymyślimy. Wszyscy skierowali się w głąb lasu. Po chwilinwiększość z nich jakby się rozpłynęła. Dopiero kawałek dalejnwszystko się wyjaśniło, kiedy zbliżyli się do ściany z drzew,nktóra zagradzała im dalszą drogę. Po bliższym przyjrzeniu,nokazywała się bramą do ich ukrytego miasta. W środku stały małenchatki, a w alejkach pomiędzy nimi było tłoczno od ludzi. Wszyscynzajęci byli jakąś robotą, nawet małe dzieci nie siedziałynbezczynnie. -Tutaj się ukrywamy- wyjaśnił Robin dwójcenprzyjaciół.- Zwykle nie ujawniamy się przed obcymi taknszybko, ale jesteś moją córką więc zrobiliśmy wyjątek...nRównież dla twojego przyjaciela.- Spojrzał wymownie nanzachwyconego mnicha, który co chwilę okręcał się dookoła,npragnąc mieć oczy również z tyłu głowy. -To Frodrick.-nPrzedstawiła go dziewczyna.- Razem mieszkaliśmy w klasztorze, gdziennauczyłam się strzelać z łuku. Cała świta Robina rozbiegłansię po miasteczku, wracając do swoich zajęć, tylko chłopak znturnieju i braciszek Tuck nadal z nimi szli. Gwyn chciałaby wreszciendowiedzieć się kim jest ten nieznajomy. -Jesteście pewniengłodni- powiedział gruby mnich.- Chodźcie ze mną. -Jak sięnnajecie to do was przyjdę i porozmawiamy- oznajmił Robin.- Teraznmuszę coś załatwić. Odszedł w przeciwną stronę, a oninskierowali się do prowizorycznej kuchni polowej, przy którejnżywili się wszyscy mieszkańcy. Stało tam kilka stołów,nzrobionych z desek. Między nimi krzątała się dość tęga kobietanw średnim wieku. Miała rude włosy i przyjazną twarz na którejngościł miły uśmiech. Ubrana była bardzo skromnie- równieżnna zielono. -Witajcie, nigdy was tu wcześniej nie widziałam,nRobin musiał więc was zwerbować niedawno. -Owszem, jestem Gwyn,na to mój przyjaciel Frodrick.- przedstawiła ich, zajmującnmiejsce na ławie wskazane przez kobietę. Obok niej usiadł tamtennchłopak. Po chwili pojawiła się przed nią miska gulaszu. -Janjestem Marry Duff- powiedziała kobieta i odeszła do swoich zajęć. Po przełknięciu kilku łyżek, Gwyn zorientowała się, żenchłopak gapi się na nią. -No dobra, już wiesz kim ja jestem.nTeraz może sam byś się przedstawił. -Nadal nie mogę wyjść znszoku, że jesteś jego córką. A kiedyś nawet nie wiedziałaśnkim on jest...- powiedział leniwie, jakby się z nią drocząc. –nSzkoda, że mnie nie pamiętasz... mała. Gdy to powiedział Gwynndoznała uczucia dejavu. Spojrzała na niego i ... -To niemożliwe-nwyjąkała. Tymczasem również Frodrick oderwał się odnjedzenia i spojrzał na nich. -Co 'ię sta'o?- wyseplenił znpełną buzią.- O so chosi? -Christopher?- spytałanniedowierzając dziewczyna. -A jednak pamiętasz moje imię, mała-nuśmiechnął się łobuzersko. -Ja ci dam!- wydarła się śmiejącnGwyn.- Ty też znasz moje imię! Nie jestem mała! Dopiero teraznFrodrick był naprawdę nieco zakręcony. -Zaraz, wy sięnznacie? Przestali sztyletować się wzrokiem i spojrzeli nanosłupiałego mnicha. -Wybacz- opamiętała się dziewczyna.- TonChris, on dał mi łuk, zanim trafiłam do szkoły przyklasztornej. Wnsumie to dzięki niemu się tu znalazłam.- Tu zwróciła sięndo chłopaka.- Tak bardzo chciałeś być jak Robin i w końcu donniego dołączyłeś, co? Nie zdążył nic odpowiedzieć, bonprzyszedł do nich Robin. -Chodźcie, to naradzimy się co robićnw sprawie twojej siostry.- powiedział, a oni poszli za nim.[Chapter 8] Wesoła kompanija i narada Po chwilindoszli do głównego placu w ich małej wiosce. Kilkoro spośródnmieszkańców przerwało pracę, aby dołączyć do narady.nTeraz siedzieli naokoło, niektórzy na trawie, inni nanprowizorycznych ławach. Robin polecił im, żeby usiedli. -Chciałbymnwam przedstawić moją Wesołą Kompanię.- Wskazał ręką nanzebranych.- Wszyscy tutaj już chyba wiedzą kim jesteście, alenprzedstawię was mimo to. Oto moja córka Gwyn i jej przyjacielnFrodrick. Gwynnzażenowana patrzyła na wszystkich przyglądających się jej znciekawością ludzi. Wśród nich zauważyła braciszka Tucka.nTymczasem Robin podszedł do pierwszego z brzegu mężczyzny. Był onnbardzo wysoki i dość potężny, jednak miał bardzo poczciwąntwarz. Na plecy spadały mu długie jasne włosy. -To MałynJohn- wspomniany kiwnął głową, a Robin dodał teatralnym szeptem-nPrzez niektórych nazywany Reynold Zielony Liść, ale sam nienwiem czemu. Następnynzostał przedstawiony Leśnik. Był on małym i drobnym człowieczkiemno czarnych śmiesznych wąsikach. Na jego plecach wiecznie wisiałankusza. Obok niego siedział Nick syn Młynarza, chłopak mógłnmieć najwyżej z 15 lat. -Ten tutajnto Dzielny Wędrowiec, jeden z najstarszych członków WesołejnKompanii, oczywiście oprócz Willa- ciągnął przywódca.n–No właśnie Will powinien był już dawno wrócić! Robinnprzedstawił im jeszcze Arthura-a-Blanda i Davida z Doncaster. -No tonteraz musimy poczekać na Willa, którego wysłałem na zwiady.nPowie nam co możemy zrobić, żeby pomóc twojej siostrze-nzwrócił się do Gwyn. Ona opowiedziała mu o swoich pomysłachni wątpliwościach. -No cóż,nwykupienie jej raczej nie wchodzi w grę, gdyż nie możesz tamnwrócić, przynajmniej jawnie. Gdyby szeryf domyślił się kimnjesteś i schwytał cię...- powiedział braciszek Tuck. -Tak,nmusimy ją uwolnić siłą- dodał Mały John. -Ale wtedynszeryf zemści się na mojej rodzinie, gdyż pomyśli, że to oninzrobili.- Zaniepokoiła się dziewczyna. -Rozwiązanienjest bardzo proste- zauważył jeden z mężczyzn, któregonRobin przedstawił chyba jako Leśnika. –Wystarczy, że dziewczynannie wróci do domu. -Ale dokądnwtedy pójdzie?- spytał Frodrick. -Jak tondokąd?- zdziwił się braciszek Tuck. –Zamieszka oczywiście znnami. -To chybandobry pomysł, przecież ty też będziesz tu mieszkać- Robinnzwrócił się do Gwyn.- Nie wypuszczę cię, skoro już cięnodzyskałem. -Nigdziensię nie wybieram- odpowiedziała dziewczyna ze śmiechem. -Więc nienidziemy na ratunek?- usłyszała jakiś męski głos za sobą. -Willnnareszcie!- Przywitał go Robin. Do kręgu wszedł mężczyzna wnpodobnym do Robina wieku, tej samej postury. Tylko twarz bardzo sięnróżniła. Na czoło opadały niesfornie jasne włosy. Miałnbrązowe oczy i wesoły uśmiech. Gdyby nie był taki 'stary'nmógłby uchodzić za przystojnego. -Tonwłaśnie mój najdroższy przyjaciel, który nigdy mniennie opuścił w potrzebie- Will Scarlet.- przedstawił go kompan. -PrzestańnRobin, bo pomyślę, że czegoś ode mnie chcesz.- odparł tamten.-nZresztą nie mamy teraz czasu. Musimy wszystko zaplanować.nDziewczyna służy na zamku szeryfa, widziałem ją z daleka. Chybannienajlepiej ją tam odżywiają. -No tonmówcie wreszcie co mamy robić- zdenerwowała się Gwyn. -No,nwidzę, że dziewczyna rwie się do akcji- uśmiechnął się Will. -Tak, a jansię zastanawiam, czy ją z nami puścić- dodał Robin. Gwynnspojrzała na niego z rządzą mordu w oczach, więc nie kontynuował. -Myślę,nże musimy wyruszyć nocą, w parę osób, im mniej tym lepiej-nstwierdził Will. -Tak,nmusimy od razu ustalić kto idzie. Oczywiście ja, Will,... Gwyn-ndodał Robin po lekkim wahaniu- oraz Mały John i Chris. Reszta ludzinukryje się w lesie i w razie czego skoczy nam na ratunek. -Niczegonsię nie spodziewają, więc po prostu wejdziemy tam po cichu inwymkniemy się z dziewczyną. -No tonpostanowione. Do wieczora![Chapter 9] Na zamku szeryfa Zanimnzaszło słońce minęło kilka godzin. Frodrick był nieconrozczarowany, że z nimi nie idzie i martwił się o swojąnprzyjaciółkę. Ona natomiast biegała po wiosce, poznającnjej mieszkańców i starając się czymś zająć. Nie mogłanna niczym się skupić, więc w końcu usiadła na zwalonym pnie nankrańcu osady. Podszedł do niej Chris. -Powinnaśncoś zjeść zanim wyruszymy.- zagadnął, podsuwając jej pod nosnkawałek pieczonego dzika. Dziewczyna tylko pokręciła głową. -Nie wiemnjak można się opychać w takiej chwili- dodała z dezaprobatą,nkiedy usiadł koło niej i zaczął pochłaniać mięso. -Pomyśl,nże jeśli zostaniemy złapani, możemy nie jeść przez kilka dni. W duchunprzyznała mu rację, ale nie zamierzała się do tego przyznawaćnwięc tylko milczała, rozglądając się dookoła. Miedzynkrzątającymi się ludźmi zauważyła Frodricka. Chłopak przełknąłnostatni kęs i podążył za jej wzrokiem. -Frodricknbardzo się o ciebie troszczy- rzucił Chris od niechcenia. Gwynnspojrzała na niego. -Nonpewnie, w końcu to mój przyjaciel- widząc jegonpowątpiewającą minę, zaśmiała się.- Chyba nie myślisz, że tonmój chłopak? No dobra, przyznaję, że chyba się we mnienkocha, ale... -Po prostunwidzę, że mu na tobie zależy. Nie mogłannic na to odpowiedzieć bo nadszedł Robin i Will, którzy bylinjuż gotowi do drogi. Młodzi od razu zerwali się na nogi. -Weźmiemynkonie i ruszamy- oznajmił Will. Gwyn chwyciła łuk i poszła zannimi. Przy prowizorycznej bramie z liści, czekały już na nichnkonie. Dziewczyna zauważyła, że dla niej był przeznaczony, dośćnmały, biały konik, który jednak okazał się późniejnnaprawdę szybki. Wyjechalinz ukrytej wioski i skierowali się do miejsca przeznaczenia. Drogannie zajęła im zbyt wiele czasu. Słońce już dawno zaszło i teraznporuszali się w prawie zupełnych ciemnościach, gdyż księżycnzakryły chmury. Kilkasetnmetrów przed miastem zsiedli z koni i zostawili je przywiązanendo drzew. Skradając się doszli do zamku. Nie podeszli jednak dongłównej bramy, tylko do tylnich drzwi dla służby. Na ichnszczęście okazały się otwarte. W środku korytarz, oświetlonynpochodnią, prowadził wprost do kuchni. Jak na razie nie spotkalinnikogo, ale ich szczęście nie trwało zbyt długo, bo na ich drodzenpojawił się odźwierny . Nie zdążył nikogo zawiadomić, aninnawet krzyknąć, gdyż Chris przyłożył mu w twarz pięścią. -Pięknie,nteraz jak ktoś go znajdzie, to od razu zaalarmuje cały zamek.-nmruknął Robin, a Chris rozejrzał się dookoła, żeby znaleźćnmiejsce gdzie można by go ukryć. W końcu jego wzrok natrafił nanuchylone drzwi, które okazały się prowadzić do spiżarni.nMężczyzna został związany i zakneblowany, po czym trafił donznalezionego pomieszczenia. Grupanratowników poszła dalej, coraz bardziej zagłębiając się wnkorytarze budowli. O tej godzinie większość służby zamkowejnposzła już spać, a po zamku kręciło się tylko kilkunwartowników. Jakoś udało im się ich omijać. W końcunpostanowili się rozdzielić, a na koniec spotkać przy koniach znuwolnioną siostrą Gwyn. Dziewczyna poszła razem z Willem, antowarzyszem Robina został Chris. Do pokojów służby trafiłanpierwsza grupa. W małym pomieszczeniu spało kilka dziewczyn, każdanubrana była w dość wysłużoną już sukienkę, a w ciemnościachnwszystkie wyglądały podobnie. To co w pierwszym momencie uderzyłonGwyn, to brak łóżek. Wszystkie służące spały na sianie,nnie miały się nawet czym przykryć. Dziewczyna weszła do środka,na Will został na straży. W końcu, tylko ona mogła rozpoznaćnsiostrę, a on musiałby je najpierw obudzić, żeby przekonać sięnktóra to. Rosanleżała przytulona do jakiejś dziewczyny, aby było im cieplej,nzaraz przy drzwiach. Gwyn ukucnęła przy niej i delikatnie niąnpotrząsnęła, jednocześnie zakrywając ręka usta, aby tamta nienkrzyknęła. Mała obudzona, rozejrzała się z niepokojem inzauważyła klęczącą przy niej postać. Kiedy ją rozpoznała,ntamta zabrała rękę, po czym padły sobie w objęcia. Nie chcącnkusić losu, bez zbędnych wyjaśnień wyszły z komnaty. Zamek byłndość duży, więc droga powrotna nie była taka prosta. Gdyby Rosanich nie prowadziła, na pewno by się zgubili. Byli już niedalekonkuchni, kiedy usłyszeli odgłosy walki. Wyjrzeli za róg inzobaczyli, Robina i Chrisa otoczonych kilkoma żołnierzami. Willnmruknąwszy, że mają uciekać, rzucił się na pomoc. Gwynnpostanowiła się nie kłócić i pociągnęła siostrę zansobą. Po chwilindogonił je Chris. -Poradząnsobie beze mnie- stwierdził, kiedy zobaczył ich pytającenspojrzenia.- Robin kazał mi się wami zająć. Tłumiącnwściekłość, Gwyn została trochę w tyle. Długi bieg wyczerpałnją i musiała przystanąć, żeby złapać oddech. Przystanęła, angdy reszta to zauważyła, chcieli po nią wrócić. Nienzdążyła im powiedzieć, żeby uciekali, gdyż z bocznego korytarzanwybiegło prosto na nią kilkoro żołnierzy. -Uciekajcie!-nkrzyknęła, kiedy stanęli między nią, a jej siostrą i Chrisem.[Chapter 10] Gościna u Szeryfa z Nottingham -Uciekajcie-ndodała ciszej, ale nic to nie dało, bo żołnierzy było zbyt dużo.nSzybko ich otoczyli i pojmali. Po chwili znaleźli się przednobliczem szeryfa z Nottingham. -No, no,nno. Kogo my tu mamy?- powiedział zbliżając twarz do twarzy Gwyn.nTa chciała się odsunąć, ale dwóch żołnierzy trzymało jąnza ręce. –Tyle lat czekałem, żeby dorwać Robina, a teraz?nZłapałem jego jedyną córkę. Jestem pewny, że zrobinwszystko, żeby cię uratować. Uniósłnjej twarz za podbródek i spojrzał na nią szyderczo.nSpróbowała się wyrwać, ale nie miała siły. -Zamknąćnją- zarządził szeryf.- A tamtych wypuścić. Niech sprawdzą donmnie Robina. Potemnzwrócił się ponownie do Gwyn. -Tonturniej cię tu przyciągnął, więc twój ojciec też nienzdoła się oprzeć. Dziewczynannie za bardzo rozumiała co chciał przez to powiedzieć, ale nienmiała czasu się nad tym zastanawiać. Pociągnięto ją do jakiejśnkomnaty. Spodziewała się, że zamkną ją w ciemnym lochu, alenpokój okazał się piękny i urządzony z wszelkimi wygodami.nKiedy drzwi zostały zamknięte ze skrzypieniem, Gwyn rzuciła sięnna łóżko. Nie mogąc się powstrzymać zaczęła płakać, anpo chwili zasnęła. Obudziłonją otwieranie drzwi. Zerwała się natychmiast. Do pokoju weszłyndwie starsze kobiety. Jedna chuda, o skwaszonej twarzy, druganpulchniutka, ale o równie nieprzyjaznej minie. Za nimi donpomieszczenia przytaszczono olbrzymią drewnianą balię. Kiedynmężczyźni niosący ją wyszli, grubsza kobieta odezwała się: -No co taknpatrzysz? Może mieszkając w lesie nigdy nie widziałaś wanny, alenszeryf życzy sobie, żebyś na turnieju wyglądała jak dama. -Chociażnnie wiem, czy nawet w najkosztowniejszej sukni, będziesz wyglądaćnjak szlachcianka- dodała zgryźliwie chuda. Gwyn nienwiedziała co o tym myśleć, bo chociaż rozzłościły ją słowansłużących, to przecież była ubrana w spodnie i nie myła się odnkilku dni. Drzwinkomnaty znowu się otwarły i do środka weszli mężczyźni niosącyndzbany z gorącą wodą. Napełnili balię, po czym zostalinodprawieni przez kobiety. -Rozbierajnsię, nie mamy całego dnia!- fuknęła gruba. Dziewczynanzrobiła się czerwona, nie miała zamiaru pokazywać się naga tymndwóm okropnym babom, ale nie miała wyjścia. Postanowiła nienrobić afery i zdejmując ubranie nawet się nie odezwała. Jedynenczego nie mogła powstrzymać to rumieniec, który palił jejnpoliczki. Jak mogła najszybciej wlazła do wanny i pozwoliła sięnszorować, chociaż nie było to zbyt przyjemne przeżycie. Po umyciunwłosów, które prawdopodobnie więcej jej ich wyrwałonniż wyczyściło, została zawinięta w cienki płóciennynręcznik. Następnie chudsza służąca pomogła jej się ubrać wnbardzo kosztowną suknię i choć rzeczywiście Gwyn nigdy nie miałantakiej na sobie, wcale tego nie żałowała. Materiał był bardzonciężki, halki powłóczyste, tak, że owijały się wokółnnóg i nie pozwalały normalnie chodzić. Ponuczesaniu w na tyle wymyślną (i niewygodną) fryzurę, na ile byłonto możliwe przy jej krótkich włosach, została gdzieśnpoprowadzona. Na początku myślała, że idą na ten turniej, onktórym mówił wcześniej szeryf, ale okazało się, żennie. Weszły do kolejnej komnaty, tym razem jadalnej. Ściany byłynkamienne, wisiały na nich poroża upolowanej zwierzyny, a nanpodłodze leżały kolorowe maty. Przy olbrzymim, ciemno wiśniowymnstole siedział szeryf. Przed nim ustawione było najróżniejszenjedzenie, jakie tylko Gwyn mogła sobie wyobrazić. Kiedy jąnzobaczył, wstał i odsunął dla niej krzesło. Zdziwiona spojrzałanna niego, po czym usiadła. Nie wiedziała do czego to ma prowadzić,nale wcale jej się nie podobało. Szeryf miał w spojrzeniu cośntakiego, że gdy na niego spojrzała, aż przechodziły ją ciarki.nGdy usiadła nałożono jej na talerz wykwintne potrawy. -I jak,ncórko mojego największego wroga, podoba ci się sposóbnw jaki cię ugościłem? – spytał na pozór uprzejmienszeryf. Gwyn spojrzała na niego z nienawiścią. -Cokolwieknzamierzasz i tak ci się nie uda.- powiedziała, równieżnsiląc się na uprzejmy ton. -Och,nzobaczymy moja droga, zobaczymy- uśmiechnął się i zabrał się donjedzenia. -Turniej,no którym wczoraj wspomniałem, odbędzie się dopiero za kilkandni, radziłbym ci więc jeść, bo opadniesz z sił do tego czasu. Annie zamierzam pokazać u swego boku wychudzonej i brzydkiej pannicy.nNie chciałbym, żeby ktokolwiek pomyślał, że jestem niegościnny. Zaśmiałnsię na widok jej zaciętej miny. -Na tennturniej przybędzie nawet książę Jan. Wszyscy zobaczą klęskęntwego ojca. Dziewczynanzaczęła jeść i nie słuchała już tego, co mówił do niejnszeryf. Kiedy skończyli, została odprowadzona do komnaty. Siedziałantam bezczynnie, aż do kolejnego posiłku, na który musiałanzejść na dół i dotrzymywać towarzystwa szeryfowi. I w tennsposób mijały jej dni, coraz bardziej zbliżając datęnturnieju...[Chapter 11] Decydującenstarcie Będąc wnzamknięciu, Gwyn miała mnóstwo czasu na rozmyślanie. Dobrzenpoznała komnatę, w której przebywała. Był to mały pokoikno kamiennych ścianach i podłodze. Miał mało sprzętów, alenkażdy aż raził przepychem. Naprzeciwko drzwi było łóżko-nolbrzymie, z baldachimem z grubymi, brązowymi zasłonami. Po lewejnstronie łoża znajdowało się okno, ciągnące się od sufitu inkończące kilkanaście cali od podłogi. Mimo, że w niewielunzamkach były szyby w oknach, tutaj każdą zdobił mały witrażyk.nOkno przesłonięte było długimi zwiewnymi zasłonami. Po drugiejnstronie pokoju stała toaletka oraz rzeźbiona szafa. Z prawej stronynbyły drzwi do „łazienki\". Ktoś musiał ją codzienniensprzątać, bo inaczej zabiłby ją sam zapach, ale nigdy nikogo nienzauważyła. Pierwsze,no czym Gwyn pomyślała, kiedy została sama, to jak mogłaby stądnuciec. Drzwi zostały zamknięte na klucz, poza tym zawsze ktoś przynnich stał. Komnata znajdowała się na pierwszym piętrze, więcnwydostanie się przez okna było niemożliwe. Przyszło jej nawet dongłowy, żeby zrobić linę z prześcieradeł i zejść po niej, alenszybko z tego zrezygnowała. Okna nie można było zbyt szerokonotworzyć, zresztą zabrali jej ubranie i musiała chodzić w tychnokropnie niewygodnych sukniach. Dodatkowo okno wychodziło nandziedziniec, na którym zawsze ktoś był, chociażby stajenny,nprzygotowujący konie do podróży, czy jacyś służący. Zastanawiałansię również, co teraz robił jej ojciec i przyjaciele,nktórzy z pewnością chcieli ją uwolnić. Wiedziała, że nanpewno będą chcieli przybyć na turniej łucznictwa, z tego connasłuchała się o ojcu nigdy nie opuścił turnieju, jeśli tylkonmógł przechytrzyć szeryfa. Modliła się, żeby tego nienrobił i nie dał się złapać. Nie mogłanzrobić nic więcej, nudziła się więc i czekała na rozwójnwypadków. W dzieńnturnieju, drzwi komnaty jak zwykle otwarte zostały przez służącą,nktóra przyszła pomóc Gwyn się ubrać. Jakież więcnbyło zdziwienie dziewczyny, kiedy w drzwiach nie zobaczyła żadnejnz okropnych starych bab, które do tej pory przychodziłyncodziennie. Do pokoju weszła młodziutka służąca, a Gwyn szybkonrozpoznała w niej koleżankę Rosy. Była o wiele lepiej ubrana niżnwtedy, może ze względu na turniej. -Co ty tunrobisz?- zdziwiła się Gwyn. -PanienkonGwyn, Rosa mi o panience opowiadała- zaświergotała dziewczyna.- nDlatego tu jestem. Nie mogę panience pomóc uciec, ale... -To nic-nodpowiedziała Gwyn.- I mów mi po imieniu. Jak udało ci sięntu przyjść? -Dałamntym dwóm starym służącym napar z ziół, więc nienbyły w stanie pomóc panience w ubieraniu.- mówiłanprędko dziewczyna. Zaczęła krzątać się wokół Gwyn,npomagając jej włożyć wyjątkowo kosztowną, nawet w porównaniundo tych, które nosiła do tej pory, suknię. Kiedy skończyłanfryzować jej włosy zawahała się. -Mam cośndla panienki...- wyjąkała i sięgnęła w fałdy spódnicy.nGwyn spojrzała na nią zaciekawiona. Tamta podała jej małenzawiniątko. -Niechnpanienka ma to ze sobą podczas turnieju- rzekła służąca inwybiegła z pokoju, zostawiając ją samą. Po rozwinięciu materiałunokazało się, że był to sztylet w pochwie. Gwyn schowała go podnsuknią i czekała co stanie się dalej. Po jakimśnczasie przyszło po nią dwóch mężczyzn. Zaprowadzili ją nandziedziniec. Tam czekał już powóz, a w nim szeryf. Wsiadłando niego niechętnie i pojechali na miejsce turnieju. Zawodynodbywały się w tym samym miejscu co wcześniej. Ponieważ szeryfnwymyślił je niespodziewanie Gwyn sądziła, że nie będzie takndużo ludzi jak wcześniej, ale się myliła. Było ich o wielenwięcej. A wszystko przez to, że miał przybyć znienawidzony książęnJan. Ludzie chcieli go zobaczyć, albo żeby wiedzieć jak wyglądannajbardziej znienawidzona przez nich osoba, albo, żeby mu sięnprzypodobać. Wszędzienrozstawione były stragany, ludzie chcieli jak najbardziej sięnwzbogacić, skoro dano im ku temu okazję. Szeryf pociągnął ją nantrybuny, specjalnie dla nich przygotowane. Główne miejscenzajmowało krzesło bardzo podobne do tronu, na którym miałnzasiąść książę Jan. On sam zjawił się dopiero późniejnprzed samym turniejem. Od razu zauważył Gwyn, a szeryf jąnprzedstawił z drwiącym uśmiechem. -Mamnnadzieję, że mój wierny sługa, dobrze cię ugościł, pani-npowiedział książę Jan całując ją w dłoń. Miała ochotę nanniego napluć, ale odpowiedziała tylko: -Oczywiście,npanie. Następnienusiedli na swoich miejscach. Podczas ostatnich przygotowańndziewczyna niespokojnie rozglądała się po polanie. Przybyłonmnóstwo łuczników, ale ona na nich nie zważała. Bałansię, że wśród nich dostrzeże swojego ojca i dlategongorączkowo przeszukiwała tłum. Zauważyła jedynie kilku mnichównz kapturami na głowach i jakiegoś starca, tak przygarbionego, żendziwne było, że jeszcze trzyma się na nogach, ale nie spostrzegłanżadnej znajomej twarzy. Przekonywała się, że gdyby ona mogła ichnzobaczyć, dostrzegli by ich również ludzie szeryfa i to jąntrochę uspokoiło. Turniejnrozpoczął się. Wyglądał podobnie do tego w którym onansama brała udział i prawdę mówiąc trochę żałowała, żennie może być teraz wśród strzelców, czując tąnadrenalinę w momencie puszczenia cięciwy. Pondłuższym starciu, na polu bitwy pozostał jedynie jakiś młodynchłopak w kapturze i ... starzec. Jeszczenzanim zdążyli oddać ostateczny strzał, szeryf podniósłnsię i zawołał: -Człowieknw kapturze! To Robin Hood, schwytać go! Rycerzenrzucili się na niego i podczas szamotaniny spadł mu kaptur,nodsłaniając Chrisa! Tymczasem staruszek wymknął się sprzed oczungapiów i, zauważony jedynie przez Gwyn, podkradł się podntrybuny. Dziewczyna widząc pojmanie Chrisa chciała krzyknąć alenszybko przykuła uwagę do starca. Kiedy odrzucił sztuczną brodę inkaptur celując łuk w stronę księcia Jana, stało się dla niejnjasne, że był to jej ojciec. Uczucie ulgi walczyło ze strachem onto, że coś mu się stanie. Rycerzenszeryfa obezwładnili Chrisa i ruszyli w stronę trybun, na wrzasknksięcia Jana: -Nonruszcie się, on do mnie mierzy z łuku! -Nienradziłbym ci, panie, wzywać ich na pomoc jeśli chcesz żyć-npowiedział spokojnie Robin, podczas gdy wezwani mężczyźni gonotoczyli i wymierzyli z własnych łuków. Szeryf tymczasemnzaczął się wycofywać. -Jeślindrgniesz, zastrzelą cię- powiedział książę. -Mojanstrzała będzie szybsza i zginiesz. Gwynnpatrzyła na to z pozornym spokojem ale nie miała pojęcia co robić.nPoczuła się jeszcze bardziej bezradna niż do tej pory. Ale wtedynrozejrzała się wokoło i zauważyła, że niektórzy z ludzi,nna których nie zwracał wcześniej uwagi są jej całkiemnznajomi i właśnie w tej chwili okrążają wojsko księcia,ntrzymając ręce na trzonkach mieczy lub wyjmując strzały znkołczanów. Nagle przypomniał jej się sztylet którynmiała ukryty pod suknią i sięgnęła po niego. Nie namyślającnsię wiele znalazła się za księciem Janem przykładając munsztylet do szyi. -Jeślinnie odwołasz swoich ludzi, będziesz trupem. W tejnsamej chwili Robin zawołał: -Gwyn,nnie! Przeznchwilę plac ogarnęła niczym nie zmącona cisza, a kiedy dziewczynanmocniej przycisnęła mu sztylet do szyi, rozkazał im opuścićnłuki. Potem wszystko potoczyło się błyskawicznie. Ukryci do tejnpory ludzie Robina wyskoczyli z ukrycia i zaatakowali rycerzy. Walkanrozgorzała na dobre, a tym całym zamęcie, trudno było rozpoznaćnkto ma przewagę. Gwynnpuściła księcia Jana, który od razu uciekł, i rzuciła sięnw objęcia ojca. Było to trochę utrudnione, ze względu na jejnstrój. Robin nienmógł zbyt długo próżnować, więc oddał łuk córce,na sam wyciągnął miecz i począł siec przeciwników. Gwynnchciała pomóc, ale nie mogła strzelać, bo w tej kłębowinienmogłaby trafić kogoś ze swoich.[Chapter 12] 12 12. Niktnna nią nie zwracał uwagi. Co jakiś czas zdarzało się, że któryśnz ludzi szeryfa usiłował ją zaatakować, ale wtedy zawsze zjawiałnsię któryś członek Wesołej Kompanii i nie pozwalał by zbytnionsię do niej zbliżyli. W końcu dziewczyna wycofała się na tyle,nże oglądała całą walkę z boku. W pewnym momencie dostrzegła,nże jej ojciec walczył z szeryfem z Nottingham. Oboje dyszeli jużnze zmęczenia, ale ich miecze nadal sypały iskry. Wtedy jakiśnmężczyzna znalazł się przed samą Gwyn, a ona, zapatrzona w walkęnswego ojca, zobaczyła go w ostatniej chwili, kiedy miał jąnpochwycić. -nNie! - krzyknęła i usiłowała odskoczyć. W ostatniej chwilinmiędzy nią, a mężczyzną wyrósł Christopher. -nJa jestem twoim przeciwnikiem - powiedział, kiedy równocześnienGwyn zawołała - Chris! Zaczęlinwalczyć. Uwagę dziewczyny przykuł jednak stłumiony krzyk zzannich. Znowu spojrzała w stronę walczącego ojca i dostrzegła, żenszeryf zdołał wytrącić mu z rąk miecz. Robin stał dwa metrynprzed swoim przeciwnikiem, zupełnie bezbronny, dysząc ciężko. -nZastrzelić go! - zawołał szeryf, do jednego ze swoich ludzi, którynwłaśnie nadbiegł uzbrojony w łuk. Ten natychmiast wymierzył wnRobin Hooda. Niennamyślając się, zupełnie instynktownie, Gwyn napięła swój łuknw tym samym momencie. Chris kątem oka dostrzegł co się dzieje innaparł na swojego przeciwnika spychając go i siebie spoza zasięgunstrzału. W ostatniej chwili poczuł jeszcze za plecami podmuch jakinspowodowała wypuszczona strzała. Chwilęnwcześniej człowiek szeryfa z Nottingham wypuścił swoją strzałę,ncelując w pierś Robina. Teraz patrzył oniemiały na swój cel,nktóry nadal stał jakby nigdy nic, zupełnie nieporuszony. Strzałannigdy nie dosięgła swego celu. Została przestrzelona przez Gwyn,nktóra teraz ponownie wycelowała łuk, tym razem w szeryfa. Ten nienwiedząc co się właściwie dzieje rzucił się na Robina znpodniesionym mieczem. Nie zdążył zrobić nawet kroku, kiedynnastępna strzała dziewczyny przeszyła go od tyłu. Upadł najpierwnna kolana, potem powoli osunął się na ziemię, twarzą w dół. Gwynnsięgnęła po następną strzałę, gdyby była potrzebna, ale kiedynsię rozejrzała dotarło do niej, że Wesoła Kompania rozbroiłanlub powaliła większość przeciwników. Natomiast ci, którzynjeszcze byli w stanie walczyć, poddali się jak tylko zobaczyli, żenszeryf nie żyje. -nRosa! - krzyknęła Gwyn, kiedy zaraz po powrocie do kryjówki wnlesie jej młodsza siostra rzuciła jej się w ramiona. - Nic ci nienjest? -nGłupia, to je powinnam się o to spytać - powiedziała tamta. -nTo oczywiste, że nic mi nie jest - zapewniła ze śmiechem, po czymntrochę się naburmuszyła - Chociaż kto wie, czy od noszenia tejnsuknie nie doznałam trwałego urazu. Zandziewczynami rozległ się wybuch śmiechu. To Robin i Chris nienmogli się powstrzymać kiedy ją usłyszeli. -nMała, teraz możesz z powrotem przebrać się za chłopaka -nzauważył Chris. - Ała! Gwynnzdołała szturchnąć go w pierś jednocześnie nie wypuszczając znobjęć siostry. -nNie jestem mała. -nChyba jednak wolałbym, żebyś pozostała dziewczyną - westchnąłnchłopak. Ponprzebraniu się z powrotem w męskie ciuchy Gwyn usiadła na obrzeżunpolany, położonej w centrum leśnej społeczności. Wszyscy inninjuż nacieszyli się ich powrotem i mogła wreszcie odetchnąć. -nGwyn - usłyszała za sobą nieśmiały głos Frodricka. Gdy tylkonusłyszała swoje imię poderwała się i objęła chłopaka. -nGdzie się podziewałeś. Tak się cieszę, że znowu cię widzę. -nNaprawdę? Chciałem przywitać cię wcześniej, ale wszyscy bylintacy podnieceni, a ty znajdowałaś się w centrum uwagi... -nJak mogłabym się nie ucieszyć na widok mojego najlepszegonprzyjaciela? -nPrzyjaciela... - chłopak westchnął i wyraźnie posmutniał. Potemnodwrócił głowę. Gwyn zauważyła, że spogląda na Chrisa, którynwłaśnie kierował się ku nim. Potemnspojrzał ponownie na nią i uśmiechnął się smutno, ale zndeterminacją. -nWiem, że to jego lubisz - stwierdził. - Idź do niego. Gwynnzerknęła na Chrisa, który przystanął przed nimi i patrzyłnwyczekująco, jakby czekał aż skończą rozmawiać. -nJesteś pewny? -nTak, w końcu jestem twoim najlepszym przyjacielem - uśmiechnąłnsię jeszcze raz, bardziej wesoło. -nDziękuję - Gwyn uściskała go, po czym zwróciła się do Chrisa. -nPrzejdziemy się? - spytała nieśmiało. -nJasne, chodź. -nNawet nie wiesz jak mnie przeraziłaś, kiedy szeryf cię uwięził -noznajmił chwilę później, kiedy weszli między drzewa. - Bałemnsię, że szeryf mógł... -nNic mi nie zrobił - zapewniła go dziewczyna. - Prawdę mówiącnwiększość czasu byłam zamknięta w jakimś pokoju. Strasznie sięnnudziłam - skrzywiła się przesadnie. Chłopaknsię roześmiał. -nTo dobrze, że nic ci się nie stało. -nTo częściowo twoja zasługa - powiedziała cicho, czując, że sięnrumieni. - Broniłeś mnie wtedy, podczas walki... -nJak mogłem tego nie robić? Nigdy bym sobie nie darował gdyby cośnci się stało. -nNo wiesz, nie jestem aż taka bezbronna - oświadczyła nieconnaburmuszona. -nMimo to trzeba cię pilnować - zaśmiał się, po czym spoważniał.n- Mam zamiar poważnie się tym zająć. -nMój ojciec kazał ci mnie niańczyć? - spytała z zażenowaniem inprzerażeniem jednocześnie. -nNie, ale mam nadzieję, że mi na to pozwoli. Mam zamiar spytać go ontwoją rękę. Sercenzaczęło bić jej jak oszalałe, na policzki wpłynął jeszczenwiększy rumieniec. Nie mogła uwierzyć w to co słyszała. A potemnopuściła głowę i powiedziała cicho. -nWiększym zmartwieniem będzie przekonanie mnie, żebym zechciała zanciebie wyjść! -nMyślę, że to wystarczy mała - powiedział, i zanim zdążyłanzaprotestować, przyciągnął ją do siebie i pocałował.

Ok, enjoy![Chapter 2] Chapter 1: Homecoming The wind rustled the leaves above Gwen's head as she rode beside hernfather through Sherwood Forrest. \"Nearly home now,\" Will spoke up from the other side of Robin. \"A fewnmore turns and we'll be at the abbey.\" Gwen nodded silently, her gaze never leaving the dirt path before hernas it slowly passed by. Nearly a year had passed since she left London tonstart her new life devoted to defending England beside her father. Nearly anyear since she had laid eyes on Phillip. She sighed and closed her eyes, scolding herself for loosing herncontrol. He had entered her mind far too often lately. She was the one whonchose to walk away from his. So, why did he constantly occupy her thoughts?nShe knew the answer far too well. It sat etched into the back of her mindnlike a shadow. Her place was beside her father, saving England. There wasnno place for love in her life. Was there? \"Tuck!\" Robin called as they reached the gates of the abbey. \"Robin! Will!\" the balding monk rushed over with open arms. \"What? Nonwhite birds?\" Rob embraced him kindly. \"We thought that we would surprise you mynold friend.\" Tuck nodded and shifted his gaze to Gwen as she stood silently besidenher horse. \"Why Gwen, you look as radiant as ever.\" \"Thank you, Uncle. Now if you'll excuse me gentlemen.\" She blushednslightly as she walked toward the wash room. Compliments were still hard tonher to take, even from Tuck. When she had finished washing up, she headed back town to thencourtyard. As she neared the steps, she could hear frantic muffled voices.nQuietly, she trotted down the stairs, catching a glimpse of her father andnWill speaking to a man in a dark cloak. Suddenly, the hood of the cloaknfell to reveal a familiar head of dark hair. \"Froedrick!\" Gwen darted to him and he puller her into a tight hug. \"Hownwas Spain?\" Only when she pulled away looking for an answer did she notice the grimnlook on his face. She turned to see her father gathering some horses.n\"What's wrong?\" \"The King would like to speak with all of you. He has sent me to retrievenyou,\" Froedrick replied in a voice as professional as he could muster as henclimbed onto one of the horses. Gwen followed in suit along with the men. \"Froedrick, what has happened?\" \"Come on, if we leave now, we'll make it to London by daybreak.\" Rob gavenhis horse a sharp kick and the group was off. As they rode away, Gwen could hear Tuck yelling from the gates. \"God'snspeed to you.\"[Chapter 3] Chapter 2: Trouble Brewing \"Froedrick,\" Gwen pleaded for the tenth time since they left thenabbey. \"Tell me what is happening.\" \"I already told you Gwen, I can't.\" \"But-\" Froedrick just shook his head. \"Phillip asked me specifically not tonsay anything to you. He wished to inform you of the situation in person.\" \"I don't care. Tell me-\" \"Gwen, leave the poor boy alone. You'll find out soon enough,\" Robinnsaid in a cold voice as they stopped to water the horses. \"We'll be at thenpalace within the hour.\" She scowled and climbed back onto her horse, taking off with thenothers. The rest of the ride to London was spent in silence. A young servant met them at the gates to the palace. He approachednFroedrick, taking the reigns as he dismounted. \"Welcome back sir.\" \"Thank you Malcolm,\" Froedrick patted the boy on the shoulder. \"Willnyou take my friends' horses to the stable please?\" Malcolm nodded, taking each of the reigns in turn. When he reachednRobin, he stared up at him in awe. \"Are you Robin Hood?\" \"It so happens that I am,\" Rob said with a smile. \"You take good carenof my horse now, you hear?\" \"Yes sir!\" Malcolm tugged the four horses gently and they followednhim around the corner of the stables. Froedrick watched the boy disappear, then turned to his companions.n\"Come.\" They followed him down a stone hallway and through a set of heavynwooden doors. He eventually led them to a vast room with fine tiled floorsnand tapestries in shades of blue velvet hanging everywhere. In the center,nelevated above the rest of the room by carpeted stairs, sat an elegantnthrone. At a desk in the corner of the room, a man no older than Gwen satnwriting furiously. \"Winston!\" The man jumped, sending his pen to the floor before him. \"OhnFroedrick, you startled me. Good to see you back so soon.\" Winston shuffled his papers a bit, picked up his pen, setting itncarefully on a pile of documents, and then walked across the glossy floornto the group. Froedrick's eyes darted about the room. \"Winston, where is the king?\" \"He had urgent business to attend to in Birmingham. We are to expectnhim to return within the hour. He asked that we make our guests asncomfortable as possible until his arrival.\" Froedrick nodded. \"Very Good. Oh, I seem to have forgotten mynmanners. Gwen, Rob, Will, this is Winston of Leister, the King's clerk.nWinston, may I present Will Scarlet, Robin of Locksley, and his daughternGwen.\" Everyone bowed in unison. \"Very good to meet all of you. Now if you'll excuse me, I have somenbusiness to attend to.\" In a flash, Winston had vanished from sight. Gwen stared after him puzzled. \"Curious fellow isn't he?\" Froedrick asked from behind her. \"I should say so. Where ever did Phillip find him?\" Froedrick shrugged. \"He just showed up one day looking for a job. I'll shownyou to your quarters if you'd like. I'm sure you're all very tired.\" \"Please do lad,\" Rob said with a smile. Will nodded, and then nudged Froedrick in the ribs with his elbow. \"Couldnwe swing by the kitchen, I'm famished.\" Minutes later, Gwen lay back on the feather-stuffed bed, letting thensoftness consume her. Two straight days of riding had taken a toll on hernbody and none of her limbs wanted to move. There was a light knock on her door. Gwen groaned, moving slowly to the door. A woman her father's agensmiled at Gwen as she opened the door. \"Milady, Froedrick sent me to see if there was anything that younneeded. I thought that maybe you would care for a cup of tea.\" She held outna tray with a kettle and a few cups before placing it on the woodenndresser. Gwen smiled at her. \"That's very kind of you .\" \"Jocelyn, madam.\" \"Please call me Gwen,\" she replied as she poured the steaming teaninto a cup. \"Would you care for one?\" Jocelyn gave Gwen a small smile. \"That would be wonderful. Thank you.nI can see why the King speaks so highly of you.\" Gwen blushed profusely. \"He should be arriving soon.\" Jocelyn commented between sips. Gwen pulled the messy braid out of her hair and turned to her sack tonpull out a brush and a delicate blue dress. Her riding clothes just didn'tnseem appropriate for the palace. \"I could help you with your hair, if you'd like,\" Jocelyn suggestednsweetly. Gwen nodded. \"If you'd like. No one has ever offered before.\" Jocelyn set down her china cup and took the brush in hand as Gwennpulled the dress over her head. \"Your mother never braided your hair as anchild?\" \"She passed when I was very young, before I was old enough to worrynabout such things.\" Jocelyn nodded in sympathy as she delicately pulled at the knotsnriding had placed into Gwen's shoulder length hair. \"Your father raised younthen?\" \"My father spent most of my childhood fighting with Richard innJerusalem. I was raised at the monastery with Froedrick.\" Within a few minutes, Jocelyn had Gwen's hair twisted into a simplenbun that sat on the crown of her head. \"There you are.\" Just as Gwen was about to respond, there was a knock on the door. \"Come in.\" Froedrick popped his head into the room. \"Phillip has arrived. Yournfather and Will are waiting for you just down the stairs.\" \"Just in time it seems,\" Jocelyn said as she moved to the dresser tonpick up the tray of tea. \"Thank you,\" Gwen replied as she started out the door. She took a deep breath as she followed her father and Will into thenthrone room. Winston sat at his desk in the corner, writing furiously as henhad been when they first arrived. \"Robin, Will, thank you for coming on such-\" Phillip's voice cutnshort as Gwen stepped out from behind her father. \"Gwen.\" Her name was spoken barely more than a whisper, but it left a lump innher throat. She curtsied properly. \"Your Majesty.\" When Gwen stood, her eyes met his for a moment. He smiled slightly,nnot willing to break eye contact just yet. Robin cleared his throat, the sound echoing in the empty room. \"YournHighness?\" \"Yes?\" Phillip's gaze scanned to Robin who wore a questioning look.n\"Oh yes, I suppose you're wondering why I have called on you.\" \"Froedrick sounded rather concerned,\" Will spoke up on the other sidenof Robin. Phillip nodded. \"Rightly so. The Sheriff of Nottingham and Cardaggiannhave escaped from the Tower.\" Rob took a deep breath. \"Any clues as to where they might be?\" \"I was hoping that you would be able to help me to find some.\" \"We'll check around the city, see what we can turn up.\" Phillip smiled. \"I thought that you would say that. You're horses arenin the stables. You are free to stay here as long as necessary.\" \"Thank you sir, now if you'll excuse us, we'll get to work.\" Phillip had already turned his attention to Gwen who stood silently,nexamining the marble beneath her feet. With her hair delicately pinned onntop of her head and a pale blue dress hanging perfectly on the curves ofnher body, he wondered how she ever passed as Wilfred of Lancaster. \"Sir?\" Robin's voice crept into her consciousness. \"Oh!\" Phillip stood up and gave them a quick bow. Robin laughed as he turned away. \"Come on Will.\"[Chapter 4] Chapter 3: A Proposition Suddenly, the only sound in the room was the occasional tapping onnWinston's foot against the cold marble. Gwen became increasingly aware thatnthey were alone in the room aside from the clerk, who seemed occupied innhis own work. Phillip took a deep breath before descending the carpeted stairs.n\"I've missed you, Gwen.\" He reached for her hand, but she pulled it away gently. \"If you'llnexcuse me, I must catch up to my father.\" She took a few steps toward the door before his voice stopped her.n\"Gwen, please.\" She wiped away a tear that slid down her cheek as she turned to facenhim. \"Your Majesty - Phillip, nothing has changed.\" He swallowed visibly, then opened his mouth to speak. Gwen smiled sadly before cutting him off. \"I'm sorry Phillip, I mustngo.\" She turned on her heal and hastily exited the room. Phillip sighed as the door closed behind her. \"I do not understandnwomen.\" \"You're not meant to sire,\" Winston spoke up from behind his desk.n\"Although that one might be worth the effort.\" \"That she is Winston, that she is.\" Phillip turned to face hisnclerk, but he was nowhere to be found. Instead, Phillip made his way slowlynup the steps and fell into the throne with a sigh. Gwen made her way quickly across the courtyard. So quickly in factnthat she bumped into the person walking toward her, sending whatever he wasncarrying flying into the air. \"Pardon me milady, I was not watching where I was going,\" Winstonnsaid, scrambling to pick up the papers that had scattered at her feet. Gwen leaned down to help him. \"It was my fault as well.\" She inspected a stack of envelopes quickly before she handed it tonhim. Most of them were addressed to various places in Ireland. \"Do you havena relation in Ireland sir?\" \"Uh, yes,\" Winston replied quickly. \"My father recently relocatednthere. Excuse me madam.\" Gwen stood astonished in the courtyard. The weight of hernconversation with Phillip was still resting on her shoulders. She found anbench not far off, hidden in one of the many gardens that decorated thenpalace lawn. No sooner had sat down, tears started flowing silently downnher cheeks. She heard footsteps coming up the path. \"Gwen? Where are you?\" \"Over here Froedrick.\" He followed her voice until he found her sitting against a backdropnof lilacs and tulips. He sat next to her in silence, just staring off intonthin air. Leaving her alone in her thoughts; Froedrick had always been goodnat that. \"You haven't changed a bit have you?\" \"Ah, but I have. I've grown a full inch, and I can speak Spanish.\" Hensmiled. She threw her arms around his shoulders. \"You are the best friend innthe world. Have I ever told you that?\" \"Once or twice I think.\" The pair burst out into peals of laughter.n\"I have missed you Gwen.\" \"And I you brother Froedrick.\" Phillip watched Gwen and Froedrick from a window a few stories up.nHow he envied his friend for being able to make Gwen laugh, to comfort hernwhen she cried.nHe let out a deep sigh as their laughter flowed through the open window. \"Are you alright, sire?\" Winston asked from the doorway. Phillip sat on the edge of his bed and ran a hand through his hair. Winston peered out the window, catching a glimpse of the pair in thengarden before pulling the shutter closed. \"Gwen?\" \"I can't get her out of my head. I've tried thinking about anythingnelse, but once I close my eyes, her picture is in my mind. I must donsomething, Winston, before I drive myself mad. But, short of abdicating mynthrone, there is nothing that can be done. And if I did that, Gwen wouldnnever forgive me.\" Throughout the course of his speech, Phillip had risennand was pacing around the room like a madman. \"Sit down your majesty. You need to calm yourself before you donsomething rash. There is one thing that can be done.\" Phillip sat eagerly next to his clerk as he finished his explanation. \"It has been done in the past, but it must be kept completelynsecretive. It is a possibility to be wed to a peasant, if and only if nonone is to know about it.\" \"And if it became known?\" Winston sighed. \"It could be a powerful weapon for anyone who opposesnyou. You could loose your throne.\" \"So I would lose her either way.\" \"Only if you were discovered.\"[Chapter 5] Chapter 4: Froedrick and Gwen were walking around the garden catching up whennthey heard rapid foot prints coming up the drive. They ran toward the gatesnto identify the hurried riders. \"It's my father and Will,\" Gwen observed when they were still at anfair distance. She knew their riding well. Froedrick nodded in agreement. \"By the way that they are riding, itnlooks like they have news.\" \"Bad news,\" Gwen said as the riders came closer. Froedrick blew out his breath loudly. \"Let's find Phillip.\" Phillip lay alone in his room, staring up at the cold stone ceiling abovenhis head. Winston's words swam around in his head, mixed with images ofnGwen and the memory of the kiss that they shared nearly a year earlier. A knock on the door startled Phillip back to reality. He jumpednnearly an inch off of the mattress before he could respond. \"Yes?\" \"Robin has returned my lord,\" Froedrick's voice filtered through the heavyndoor, his words rushed. Phillip rose and tottered to the door, welcoming any distraction from hisnthoughts. He quickly opened the door, only to see Gwen standing silentlynbeside Froedrick. So much for a distraction, but duty called. \"Shall we?\" \"They left England two days ago, by boat from the port of Sussex,\" Robnreported breathlessly as he entered the Great Hall. Phillip nodded. \"So they are out of the country. Then there is no threat tonbe concerned with?\" \"Somehow I doubt that,\" Gwen replied. \"They're up to something, they havento be.\" \"Majesty, what of John?\" Froedrick asked in a small voice. Phillip narrowed his eyes at his advisor. \"In Scotland, or so my spies tellnme.\" \"Are you sure?\" Will challenged politely. Phillip sat in silence for a moment, drumming his fingers against thenwooden arm of the throne. \"Winston! We need a map.\" Winston trotted over, his arms loaded with charts and maps. He spread eachnout separately on a table in the middle of the room. Phillip shufflednthrough them until he located the United Kingdom. \"Last word placed Johnnhere, in Edinbourough.\" \"Gwen, we'll leave for Scotland within the hour. When we find John, thenother two will not be far,\" Rob said as he started for the door. \"Will andnI will get supplies, meet us in the stable in 30 minutes.\" Gwen jogged in the direction of her room, to get changed. \"Gwen, wait!\" Froedrick called, trying to catch up to her. \"I'm coming withnyou.\" She stopped abruptly in the hallway and turned to him in a hushed tone,n\"You have to stay here. Someone has to be around to protect Phillip.\" \"But-\"nGwen pulled him into a quick hug. \"Goodbye Froedrick.\" \"Be careful. God's speed.\" Once safely in her room, Gwen quickly changed into her riding clothes andnpulled her hair back into a braid. She was just packing a sack of hernthings when there was a knock on her door. \"Come in,\" she called with her back to the door. She heard the door creak open. \"Gwen, please don't go.\" She spun around to find herself face to face with Phillip. \"I can't lose you again.\" Against her better judgment, Gwen took a step closer to him. \"Phillip, I-\" Before she could finish her thought, he closed the distance between theirnfaces. An eternity seemed to pass as they shared a soft sweet kiss. Gwen'snhead reeled as she stepped away from him. \"I have to go. I gave you my wordnthat I would protect you forever, and I don't intend to break it. Goodbye.\" She gave him a quick kiss before turning to leave. \"I love you Gwen,\" Phillip choked out as she took her first step out of thenroom. \"And I you, your Majesty.\"[Chapter 6] Chapter 5: Impossible Gwen kept pace with her father and Will as they rode north through thenEnglish countryside. She rode silently, her mind too busy wandering back tonher earlier conversation with Phillip. Well aware that letting her mindnwander was dangerous, especially now, she tried to push thoughts of Phillipnto the back of her mind. There was only one problem: He was the reason thatnshe was riding to Scotland. After three days of hard riding, they arrived in Edinbourough, only tondiscover that John had gone weeks earlier, headed west to Belfast. \"There is a ferry headed for Belfast within the hour,\" the dock manninformed them as they reached the channel coast. Gwen crawled off her horse, handing her father the reigns before curling upnon a nearby bench. Every bone in her body ached from days of riding withnvery little rest. Sleep quickly consumed her. \"Gwen?\" Rob tapped her gently. \"Gwen, wake up, the ferry is here.\" When they were well on their way, Rob joined Gwen who was leaning againstnthe railing of the ferry. He stared out at the water passing by them. \"Hownis Phillip?\" Gwen swallowed hard, trying to remove the lump that suddenly formed in hernthroat. \"Fine I suppose.\" \"There is more than one way to protect your king Gwen,\" Rob said after anmoment of silence. \"I was meant to fight off evil from the outside, butnmaybe you were meant for a different purpose. Just maybe you are meant tonprotect him from within, from the heart. Think about it. I'll see you whennwe dock.\" As Robin's footsteps drifted away, Gwen closed her eyes tightly. A hot tearnslid down her cheek. While her father's words were logical, they didn'tnregister in her mind. She couldn't imagine being allowed to love Phillip.nNot only was it dangerous, it was impossible.[Chapter 7] A TRAP The streets of Belfast buzzed with excitement, the murmur of somenunknown language hung in the air around Gwen as she made her way throughnthe streets with her father and Will. An elderly man approached the groupnand began talking to Rob in the strange language. Gwen and Will bought somenbread and sat on a nearby bench, waiting for Rob to finish hisnconversation. \"Michael said that a strange man came through here a few weeks ago,\"nRob said as he joined them on the bench, stealing some of the bread. \"Henseems to fit John's description.\" \"So, what do we do Rob?\" Rob took a deep breath, and than took a bite of the bread in hisnhand. \"We find him.\" Thanks to some questioning and some very helpful peasants, they werenfinally directed to a manor house a day's ride out of the city. The trionsat perched on their horses, staring up at the house from the edge of thenforest. \"Come on.\" Rob dismounted and ran crouched through the bushes. \"Wait,\" Gwen whispered crouching down beside him. \"Someone's coming.\" Two riders came down the path, trotting along. \"That's the sheriff,\" Will said quietly. \"And Carddagah,\" Rob added, nodding. \"I still say that it doesn't make sense,\" Will mused as the pairnvanished into the manor. \"It's like they just walked out of the tower.\" Gwen began putting the pieces together in her mind. \"What?\" \"There was no fight in the tower, no guards were injured. How is thatnpossible?\" Rob started moving forward. \"Let's go ask them, shall we?\" \"Father wait!\" Gwen said quickly, grabbing his shoulder. \"It's antrap. It has to be.\" Will narrowed his eyes at her. \"What are you talking about, girl?\" \"It has been too easy, they wanted to be found. John may be ignorant,nbut he's not a fool. You know as well as I do that a blind man could havenfollowed his tracks.\" \"John must have known that Phillip would send us after them,\" Robnremarked. Gwen nodded. \"Leaving Phillip alone,\" she groaned, \"and unprotected.nWe must get back.\" \"We can't just leave them here alone Rob, it's dangerous.\" \"I'll ride back alone,\" Gwen said, making a break for her horse. \"Gwen-\" \"Please Father.\" Rob nodded. \"Be careful.\" Gwen mounted in one smooth motion and then kicked the horse and wasnoff. Phillip sat alone in the gardens, staring out across the fieldsnbeyond the castle. Gwen and Rob had been gone for nearly five days withoutna word. \"You called for me, your majesty,\" Froedrick called as he came aroundnthe corner. Phillip smiled at his friend's propriety. \"Froedrick please, how manyntimes have I told you? Enough with the 'Your majesty's call me Phillip.\" \"Sorry,\" Froedrick replied with a chuckle. \"Did you need something?\" \"Just the pleasure of your company.\" Froedrick nodded. \"She's fine. You know as well as I do that Gwen canntake care of herself.\" \"Winston said something the other day that I, I just can't get out ofnmy head.\" \"About Gwen?\" Phillip nodded. \"He says that there's a possibility that we could benmarried; as long as no one knew.\" \"That sounds a bit curious, my lord. With all due respect, Winston is-n\" Suddenly, the man in question turned the corner. \"Is what Froedrick?\" While Froedrick groped to find words, Winston pulled a sword fromnbehind his back. \"Now gentlemen, please follow me.\" Phillip's hand went instinctively to his hip, but he already knewnthat he was unarmed. \"What is the meaning of this Winston?\" Winston put the sword to the King's throat. \"Come on.\" He led them to the throne room. \"Have a seat gentlemen.\" Two men stepped out from the shadows and bound Phillip and Froedricknto nearby chairs. \"Winston, you have no right to-\" Froedrick began, but was cut shortnas Winston's sword came to his throat. \"Don't talk to me about rights. What rights did you afford mynfather?\" \"Father?\" Phillip glanced from Winston to Froedrick and back again. \"Carddagah, my lord,\" Winston answered, his voice dripping withnsarcasm at the last two words. Froedrick stared blankly. \"Carddagah is you father?\" Winston withdrew the sword, giving Froedrick a proud look. \"Veryngood, young advisor. And in a few days, John will return to reclaim thenthrone that is rightfully his. When he does, my father, the sheriff and Inwill stand loyally by. And there is nothing that you can do about it.\" \"Why wait?\" Phillip said with contempt. \"Why not be rid of us now?\" Winston grabbed a goblet of wine off a nearby table and took a seatnin the throne. \"John has special plans for you.\" \"Where is your king now? Has he deserted you already?\" \"Oh no, he just has some business to attend to first,\" Winstonnreplied with a smug smile. Froedrick lifted his head. \"What business?\" \"To be rid of Robin Hood and his little brat once and for all.\" Phillip could feel his muscles tense instinctively. A sick feelingntook root in the pit of his stomach. He let out a deep sigh. \"Gwen.\"[Chapter 8] The RESCUE Gwen rode hard, day and night, barely stopping to feed and water her horse.nShe made it back to London in half the time that it had taken them. Shenleft her horse at the far end of the market, and carefully made her way tonthe castle. With an easy scale of the garden walls, she was inside thencastle. Bow in hand, Gwen tiptoed down the stone corridors, headed for the thronenroom. Suddenly, arms reached out and pulled her into an empty room off thenhall. Gwen grabbed an arrow and drew her bow quickly, but relaxed her armnwhen she saw Jocelyn standing before her. \"Winston has the king and Froedrick.\" Gwen nodded. \"Where?\" \"At the throne. Come there are weapons back here.\" As Gwen and Jocelyn rummaged through the swords and arrows, Jocelyn fillednher in on the events of the past few days. \"What motivation would Winston have to do such a thing Jocelyn?\" The older woman took a deep breath. \"I fear that it is his father'sninfluence.\" \"His father?\" Gwen stopped dead in her tracks. \"The letters. Carddagah isnhis father isn't he? How is it possible that we didn't know that henexisted?\" \"He spent most of his youth with his mother. That father of his is a badninfluence.\" \"How do you-\" Gwen began but was quickly cut off. \"Come milady, we must hurry.\" Gwen sent Jocelyn into the room as a distraction while she slipped into thenshadows that the tapestries cast on the wall. From her spot in the corner,nshe could see Phillip and Froedrick bound to chairs at the bottom of thensteps. She pulled out her knife and waited for Jocelyn to lure Winston outnof the room. \"What do you want?\" Winston asked in a cold voice as the older womannapproached him. Jocelyn held her ground, staring him dead in the eye. \"I'd like a word withnyou, in private.\" \"What is it mother, I'm a bit busy here.\" He followed her out of the roomnreluctantly. Phillip and Froedrick snickered as the pair vanished into the hallway. Gwennstood in the shadows in shock. Jocelyn was Winston's mother? Suddenlynreality struck her like a brick. She tucked the knife into her belt andnloaded an arrow into her bow. A quick aim and she launched the shoulder ofnthe guard standing beside Froedrick. The guard fell into her friend'snunsuspecting lap. Before anyone had time to react, she reloaded and shotnthe other guard. She quickly redrew her knife and cut Phillip loose before he could evennopen his mouth in shock. The rope quickly untwisted from around him andnGwen placed it in her hands. \"Bind their hands and feet.\" Phillip nodded as Gwen turned to untie Froedrick. One of the guards moanednand Phillip hit him over the head with the butt of the sword, rendering himnunconscious. Froedrick did the same to the other. Gwen heard voices in the hallway coming toward the room. \"Come, we have tonhurry.\" She turned to leave, but Phillip grabbed her hand. \"No, I want to have anlittle chat with Winston.\" Trying to pull him from the room, Gwen opened her mouth to protest. Phillipnquickly cut her off. \"I won't let him run, Gwen. I'm going to end this herenand now.\" As the door began to creak open, she nodded and loaded her bow. As Winstonntook his first step into the room, is eyes grew as big as saucers. \"What-\" \"Nothing we could do about it, eh?\" Froedrick quipped, bringing the swordnthat Gwen had given him to Winston's throat. \"Seems that you have beennmistaken.\" \"Please,\" Phillip said, backing Winston toward one of the empty chairs.n\"Have a seat.\" As Winston fell into the chair, Froedrick found a piece of rope and tiednWinston down, a bit tighter than necessary. When Winston was securely bound, he turned to Gwen, pulling her into antight hug. \"Thank you.\" He turned away from Gwen to face Phillip. \"Nownwhat?\" Phillip took a seat on the throne. \"Now, we throw him in the tower and waitnuntil John arrives.\" After Froedrick had released her, Gwen moved to the window. She starednlongingly out at the fog that settled over the city as night fell. Shenrested her head against the cool stone. A knot began to form in her stomachnas she thought about her father and Will walking into a trap in Ireland. \"Gwen?\" Phillip's soft voice pulled her back to reality. His hand restedngently on her shoulder as she wiped a hot tear that slid down her cheek.nShe could feel his breath on her cheek as he spoke quietly in her ear. \"Younsaved my life, again. Thank you.\"nShe nodded silently, wiping another tear away with the back of her hand. \"Inhave to go Phillip. I can't just sit here and wait.\" \"You have no other choice.\" \"My father needs-\" she started. Phillip forced Gwen to look him in the eye. \"Your father knows how to takencare of himself. It's too dangerous Gwen.\" \"But-\" Phillip hugged her protectively. \"Please stay, for me. I can't lose younagain.\"[Chapter 9] Robin and Will sat in the bushes, waiting for action and planningntheir next move. For two days, they only caught glimpses of John and hisnmen as they moved around the building, undoubtedly awaiting their arrival. A branch cracked in the woods behind them. The pair spun quickly,ndrawing their swords. Michael Delaney, on of Robin's many allies in thenIrish countryside, stepped out of the shadows. Hello Robin hood,\" he whispered in Gaelic. \"We though that you couldnuse some help capturing the man that you seek.\" Rob nodded as he spoke, not missing a beat as he translated thenforeign language. \"We?\" \"We,\" Michael stated. A dozen farmers and woodsmen stepped out of thenunderbrush, each carrying a weapon. An hour later, Rob and Will rode slowly up to the front gate. As theynwere admitted into the building, Rob nodded to Michael who sat with thenothers, crouched in the bushes. \"Robin of Locksley,\" John called from a doorway on the far side ofnthe courtyard. \"So nice of you to join us.\" Robin smiled as the guard bound his hands and took his sword. \"Havenyou missed me John?\" Before John could reply, a cry from the gates caught his attention.nWithout missing a beat, Robin punched the guard with his bound hands. Henquickly grabbed a knife from his boot, releasing both himself and Will. \"Robin!\" Michael threw him a sword which he brought to John's throat. \"It's nice to see you as well, John.\" Rob looked around to see all ofnJohn's men held by Michael's army. \"Come with us, gentlemen,\" Will said, binding the sheriff's hands tonthe saddle of a horse. \"I imagine that the King would like to have a wordnwith you.\" The same steps were taken with John and Cardigan, and the three werenled out of the castle by Rob and Will. Michael met them at the gate. \"God's speed, Robin Hood.\" \"Thank you for your help, Michael. I owe you one.\" Rob shook thenIrishmen's hand before taking off into the night with Will and theirnprisoners not far behind. Gwen paced endlessly around the room, as she had for three days.nPhillip sat not far off, following her with his eyes as she walked fromnwall to wall. \"Gwen you must calm down.\" \"He should have been back by now,\" she mused, taking a seat besidenhim. \"Something has to be wrong. I have to help them.\" With that, she was on her feet again. Before Phillip could reply, anservant entered the room. \"Rider's approaching my Lord.\" Gwen and Phillip rushed to the window, staring at the five horsesncoming up the road. \"Father!\" Gwen yelled, giving Phillip a quick hug and kiss on thencheek before running out the door. Phillip breathed a sigh of relief, staring out the window. \"AndnJohn?\" He made his way quickly to the front gates, arriving just in time tonsee Gwen embrace her father. When they released each other, Phillipnapproached Rob and shook his hand. \"Nice to see you again.\" \"Ah, the great king of England! I'm shaking in my boots,\" John spokenup from his seat on the horse. \"Hello Uncle.\" Robin smiled. \"He's been talking my ear off since we left Belfast.\" Froedrick stepped out from inside the castle. \"So what do we do withnthem now, your majesty?\" \"I still have a few friends in France,\" Phillip replied. \"There arenaccommodations awaiting them in the Bastille.\" Rob tightened the ropes around John's wrists, earning himself ansnarl. \"We'll take them, my Lord.\" Phillip smiled. \"I was hoping that you would say that. Stop by thentower on your way to pick up another passenger.\" \"Winston?\" Will asked with a grin. Phillip simply nodded. Robin turned to Gwen. \"Shall we wait for you?\" Gwen looked between her father and Phillip. \"I'm staying.\" \"Very well,\" Rob said with a knowing wink. \"We will return in a weeknor two.\" He pulled her into a quick hug and then took off, pulling John'snhorse behind him.[Chapter 10] Gwen sat near the window in a pale green dress, letting the breezenblow through her loose hair. She closed her eyes to the sunset, taking andeep breath. Phillip stood silently in the doorway, his eyes glued to her as theynhad been in the days since Robin left. Her decision to stay had come as anshock to his system. She had fought him so hard to leave that he expectednher to jump at the chance to ride to France. He couldn't help taking hernstaying as a good sign. As if sensing his presence, she turned around to face him and smiled. \"Gwen I-\" he began as he walked toward her. She shook her head, taking his hand. \"Let's just watch the sunset.\" That was enough for Phillip for now. He had Gwen by his side, safe.nThat was all that mattered. A few days later, Phillip and Froedrick were walking in the gardens,ntalking business. Suddenly, Phillip stopped, leaving Froedrick walkingnalone for a moment until he realized that the king was no longer besidenhim. \"Your Majesty,\" he said, retracing his steps. \"What's-\" Phillip sat down on a nearby bench. \"I could do it, couldn't I?\" \"Sir,\" Froedrick sat down beside him just as he popped up again. \"After all I am the King.\" Froedrick furrowed his brow. \"Yes, your highness, last time Inchecked.\" \"So there's no reason why it can't be done if-\" \"Phillip!\" Froedrick nearly shouted to get his friend's attention.n\"What are you talking about?\" Phillip took a deep breath before taking a seat beside Froedrick. \"Inwant to marry her. Please tell me that there is some way that I can marrynher.\" Froedrick held his breath as Phillip spoke, watching tears well upnalong the lower rim of the king's eyes. He smiled slightly, shifting hisngaze to the cloudless sky. It was obvious that Phillip loved Gwennunfailingly and that was the only proof that he needed. \"You are the king.nWhatever you say is law.\" \"So?\" Phillip responded, giving his friend a blank stare. \"So,\" Froedrick continued, \"Whether or not Gwen is a commoner meansnnothing if you make it legal for royalty to marry whomever they choose.\" A broad smile lit up Phillip's face brighter than Froedrick had seennin a year. \"Come,\" the king said, starting down the path with a skip in hisnstep. \"We have work to do!\" Robin and Will returned later that week. Phillip spent an hour pacingnin the corridor in front of Robin's room before he worked up the courage tonknock on the door. \"Come in,\" Rob called from the other side of the heavy wooden door.nAs Phillip entered, the older man motioned for him to take a seat. \"Whatncan I do for you, your highness?\" Phillip felt a lump form in his throat. He swallowed hard before henbegan. \"Sir I-\" \"Sir? Oh my this must be serious,\" Will spoke up from the corner withna chuckle. Phillip hadn't noticed him until that moment, and his presencenonly made Phillip more nervous. Rob chuckled for a moment. \"Go on boy.\" Calming hi riled nerves, Phillip began again. \"Sir, I wish to ask younfor Gwen's hand in marriage.\" \"Fine by me,\" Rob replied simply. \"But you might want to ask her.\" Rob pointed to the open doorway behind Phillip. The king spun aroundnto see Gwen standing before him, her mouth gaping. Before he could say anword, she darted from sight down the hallway. \"Don't worry, sire,\" Will reassured. \"She'll some around.\"[Chapter 11] Froedrick was taking a stroll through the gardens when he heardnmuffled sniffles coming from a cluster of nearby bushes. He followed thensounds until he found Gwen sitting alone on a bench. \"He wants to marry me,\" she stated as he took a seat beside her. \"Hencan't its too complicated.\" \"Not anymore.\" He pulled out a scroll and handed it to her. \"What is this?\" she asked, unrolling the paper. \"A proclamation,\" he replied. \"The king has created a new law.\" She quickly scanned the document. \"Does this mean-\" \"Marry him Gwen. He loves you.\" Phillip paced around his room, trying to decide what his next coursenof action would be. The knock on the door behind him made him jump. \"Come,\" he replied quickly. The door swung open slowly and Gwen took a cautious step into thenroom. When he saw her, Phillip immediately stopped pacing. \"I spoke to Froedrick,\" she began, taking a few more steps into thenroom. She handed him the scroll that was clutched in her hands. \"I believenthat this is yours.\" Phillip closed the distance between them and reached out to her.nInstead of grabbing the scroll, he took her hand. \"Gwen, please,\" he said softly, \"I can not live happily without younby my side.\" She nodded quickly, her eyes welling with tears. That was enough ofnan answer for Phillip. He picked her up and happily spun her in a circlenbefore placing a sweet kiss on her lips. London buzzed with anticipation for the next week as the city wasnprepared for the King's wedding. When the day finally arrived, the castlenfilled with nobles and commoners alike. Friar Tuck officiated over thenceremony. The party that followed the wedding was larger than any ever seennin England and lasted well into the night. As the crowd thinned, Robin approached Gwen and Phillip. \"YournMajesty.\" \"Ah, Robin,\" the kind said, turning happily. Gwen's smile faded when she saw the grim look on her father's face.n\"What's happened?\" Will trotted up to them, wearing his riding clothes. He hugged Gwennquickly. \"Duty calls.\" Her father followed Will's lead, pulling his daughter close. \"Be careful,\" she whispered in a choked voice. He nodded. \"I'm trusting you to protect your husband.\" Gwen glanced up at Phillip. \"I give you my word.\" \"Good.\" Robin shook hands with his new son-in-law. \"I will send wordnsoon.\"[Chapter 12] Over a year passed before Robin returned to the castle in London.nGwen sat at the window, staring out over the gardens when two delicatenwhite doves flew overhead. \"White birds,\" she exclaimed, catching the attention of Phillip andnFroedrick who stood nearby talking. Phillip took a few steps toward his wife. \"What's so special aboutnwhite birds?\" \"Robin is coming,\" Froedrick answered, joining his friends. Suddenly, the cries of an infant rang out in the stone room. Gwennleaned over and picked the baby out of his crib. \"If you'll excuse mengentlemen, I think that our little price is hungry.\" Robin and will stood quietly in the doorframe of the throne room,nwatching Gwen and phillip as they stood over the cradle. \"I've grown old, Will,\" Rob mused. \"I am a grandfather.\" Will laughed lightly, patting his friend on the back. \"Well, old man,nshall we go meet him?\" At that moment, Gwen turned. Her eyes lit up when she saw them.n\"Father!\" Robin quickly closed the distance between them and embraced hernprotectively.

There never seems to be enough about them! So I figured that instead of begging others to write them, I would do ahead and write something of my own. Let me know what you think! My princess, my queen \"Are you attracted to her?\" I asked, terribly afraid of the answer he might give. Please, please let him say no. He hesitated slightly and seemed rather unsure of how he should word his answer. \"I'm attracted to her enough,\" he responded quietly, looking down to avoid my gaze. \"What?\" I exclaimed, jumping up from my seated position and tearing my hands from his. \"How could you say that?\" I bit my lip, willing myself not to let any of my treacherous tears escape. Letting him see me so weak was a mortifying prospect. He reached out for my hands, and as much as I wished to resist, I could not. \"Bess, sweetheart, you mistake my meaning. She will never compare to you. She will never have my heart as you do. But I must marry, and if it cannot be you, at least...\" I cut him off swiftly. \"At least what, Robert? You once told me you loved me.\" I lowered my voice so no one could hear. \"How can you marry her? You know how I feel about you, Robin. I wish I could stop caring about you, but I cannot.\" It was painful for me to see the look in his eyes. He seemed so at a loss for words, as if there were none quite fitting to explain how he felt about me. I had never seen him at such a disadvantage. He had always been cocky and overly confident in his ability to charm. Now he looked like a lost little boy trying to conduct himself as a man. I, too, must have now looked like a silly love struck girl. I had never actively sought to give my heart. Whenever I saw other girls losing their minds over some man, I pitied them. How pathetic they were! Love didn't exist. People could not be trusted, especially those of the male sex. I had learned that from a young age. But I had given my heart and this handsome young man held it in his hands. I could almost physically feel him crushing it when I had trusted him to take care of it. He had it and as much as I wished to take it back, it was too late. I silently cursed the day I had ever laid eyes on Robert Dudley. \"Please,\" I whispered. \"I don't ever wish to hurt you. You know that I am not a first born son and therefore have no inheritance. I must marry and Amy is an heiress. My father has set up the match and approves it. I certainly cannot back out of my promise now.\" I did know that Robert wasn't wealthy by any means and that his father had a tendency to be ruthlessly self seeking. I understood Robert's reasons for marrying Amy, but I could not condone them. Not when he had kissed my lips. Not when he had touched me like a lover. We had been mere children when he had first admitted that he loved me, but I believed him. A boy's honest and pure declaration of love was more believable than that of a man who had been tainted by politics and ambition. I knew him well enough to know when he was telling a lie. He wasn't lying then and he certainly wasn't lying now. I could see the truth in his dark eyes, shining with unshed tears. I could feel the truth in the earnest way he held my hands. \"I could only love you. I fell completely and utterly in love with you the day you beat me in that horse race. I had been a headstrong boy then who thought that nothing could touch him. You proved to me that I was not invincible. You were a force to be reckoned with. I remember thinking to myself that this was a girl that I could respect.\" I laughed despite myself. He had been taunting and teasing me constantly that day. I was just a girl. How could a little girl beat him? I had certainly shown him just what a little girl could do. We engaged in many verbal spats and competitions, always trying to one up each other. Soon our desire to crush the other turned into a budding respect and a tight friendship. \"You have not lost me, Bess. I will remain yours until the day I die.\" He leaned forward until his lips were close to mine. Our breath mingled together and for a moment time had stopped. His upcoming marriage disappeared into thin air and everything was right once again. He captured my lips with his own and kissed me so tenderly that I could not help but kiss him back, despite my desire to close my heart to him forever. His kisses intensified and his hands were tangled in my hair. Between kisses, he whispered words into my ear that I could hardly comprehend in the heat of passion. \"Robin, you mustn't. We mustn't...\" I feebly tried to voice my disapproval. My head knew what we were engaging in was entirely improper, but my heart felt every kiss and every caress was completely justified. \"My princess,\" he whispered. \"My queen.\" My mind snapped to attention at his words. \"You reckless fool. You know such words are dangerous.\" \"It's true. You will one day be my queen and I shall live and die to obey and serve only you.\" I desperately tried to swallow the words that were about to spill from my lips, but tried in vain. \"I love you, Robin.\" Amy Robsart had looked beautiful on her wedding day. Her rich rose colored gown set off her shiny blonde hair and pale skin. She looked exactly like a new bride should; happy, excited, and absolutely in love. I tried not to feel the way I did. How could the innocent Amy Robsart know that the Lady Elizabeth was incredibly jealous of her? How could she know how fervently I wished to be in her place? My chest tightened with envy and hatred for the girl who was in legal possession of Robert. Robert, for his part, seemed to match her emotion for emotion. Handsome as always, he looked just as in love as she did. I silently prayed that it was because he was imagining me in her place. I could not bear my sweet Robin being in love with someone else. We avoided each other's gaze for the entire ceremony. He could not know how I was feeling. When it was all over and they were officially man and wife, our eyes finally met. His eyes contained such a strange mixture of regret and desire that I could not help but let my eyes show him my true feelings as well. It was a brief moment of honesty and I cherished it for the rest of the day. I had his heart. He loved me. I could live on that for the rest of my life if I had to. I was Elizabeth Tudor, heir to the throne. I would survive this heartbreak just as I had survived others in the past. I was the daughter of Henry VIII and the \"whore\" Anne Boleyn. Strength coursed through my veins.[Chapter 2] So I've decided this story will be a collection of one shots about Bess/Robin. They won't be in any order and they will change from first person to third person narrative. I received a review for the last chapter asking me if I could write one where Robert marries Elizabeth instead of Amy Robsart. I will definitely try to get that up ASAP, but school always delays my writing a little bit. Please review...not because I want as many reviews as possible, but because I want to get feedback: what do you like, what can I improve on, do you have anything you would like to see me write? Reviews and feedback are a great way to improve my writing. The first time she thought she lost him was when he married Amy Robsart. She had been wrong. They were both in the Tower at the same time and he had secretly had a little boy bring her flowers. He was also by her side when she was crowned Queen of England at 25. The second time she thought she had lost him was when he married her she-wolf of a cousin Lettice Knollys. She had thought of banishing him to the Tower. When she first of his marriage she wanted to punish him, to never see him again. But when anger had softened and sense had returned to take its place, she knew she could never do that. How would she bear never seeing her Eyes again? He needed to be at her side and at her command. He was quickly summoned back to court. The the third time she thought she lost him was when he was sent to the Netherlands. No longer could he be at her side with the snap of her fingers. No longer could he take her hands, give her a charming smile, and reassure her that everything would be alright. All those times she had only lost him temporarily. He always returned, they always made up after quarrels, and most of all his affection for her was always the same. The fourth time she lost him, she lost him for good. He had been ailing for quite some time, but she always thought the medicine she sent would make him feel better. His absence from her life was always a fear, a terrifying fear that she refused to give credit to. A prince did not give into such irrational fears. They were young and strong and nothing would ever happen to them. She was wrong again. They were older. Their youth had long escaped them. Their days of being the handsomest couple to enter the room were gone, even though she would never, ever admit that. She would always remember him as her sweet Robin. Whenever she saw him, though he was aging and ailing, she saw the young boy she had first fallen in love with. To her, he would always be the young man with the dark gypsy eyes and that heart stopping swagger. When all others failed her, he was always her hero. When all others left her, she had only to take a quick glance around the room to find Robert waiting patiently for her summons. They had both hurt each other and used each other. She wouldn't deny that. He had been desperate to marry her and even though she knew Robert was ambitious, the real reason was because he wanted to fully have her heart, her body, and her soul. She had wanted to give him all of herself. The hardest thing she ever had to do was deny him. She had feared marriage from childhood. Her own mother and cousin had died at their husband's hand. Catherine Parr was carrying Thomas Seymour's child when he began to engage in his dangerous flirtations with her. Her sister Mary was stuck in a loveless marriage that lost her the support of her country. She hadn't been given any examples that made her see any advantages to marriage. As powerful as her brain was, her heart put up an awful fight. She had always secretly desired to marry her sweet Robin, but there had been so many reasons not to. There was only one reason to marry Robert and that reason was that she loved him. It wasn't often, but sometimes she allowed herself to imagine the two of them as husband and wife. She imagined having children to forever cement the love they had for each other. The first child would be a girl, a pretty girl with large dark eyes and silky black hair. She would be the spitting image of the mother she had lost at such a young age. The second was a son who would be the living image of his father. The second and third would have the Tudor red hair and pale skin. She would have it all; a husband who adored her and their children, a partner to share her burdens, and the love of her people. She would laugh at herself before dissolving into quiet tears. How silly she was being! This was all an impossible dream. She had married her country. She would live and die a virgin. Marriage was dangerous even to someone she loved. But now that she held his last letter in her hand, she was full of regret and remorse. She had never really had him and now she certainly never would. The dream of their family assaulted her with such force that she dropped to her knees and then crumpled to the floor. \"He can't be gone, he can't be gone,\" her mind chanted, but the ache in her heart told her the truth. How was she to live? He had taken her heart with him to death. He was her heart. How does one live without their heart? He had always tried to love her and take care of her. She had been so cruel to him, promising to marry him one minute and then retracting her words the next. Even he knew that a queen had to worry about more than just her heart, but it still must have hurt him terribly. Just as his marriages and affairs had stung, her many refusals must have wounded him in much the same way. This was some cruel joke. He wasn't really gone. He couldn't be. Especially when they had a victory to celebrate. Soon he would arrive, pick her up off the floor, and take her to the festivities. He would be right by her side as he always was and as they watched the celebrations, they would reminisce about the many dances they had shared together over the years. No, he was not... Suddenly, she felt as if she couldn't breathe. Her dress was too tight, her fashionable ruff too constricting. But she had banished her ladies and would not let them into her room to help her so she would have to manage herself. She furiously tore at her gown, not caring if it was ripped to shreds. Who cared about a silly gown when her love was gone? She continued to rip and claw at her dress until she escaped the pretty cage. Now she was exhausted and could no longer fight the sadness that seemed to spread to every part of her body. Everyone left her. Her mother, her cousin, her many step-mothers, her father, her brother, her sister, and now the one she believed would never leave. \"Robin, what am I to do without you? You are my soul. How can I carry on without you?\" she spoke to the letter as if it was really Robert and he could hear her cries. With every ounce of strength she had left, she screamed as forcefully as she could, not caring if anyone could hear her. \"How could you do this to me?\" Then breathlessly she whispered, \"I love you.\"[Chapter 3] I know that Bess and Robin did have adjoining suites and that when she thought she was dying of smallpox, she ordered that a large sum of money be paid to Robert's servant who slept in his room. While I don't think the relationship was technically consummated, that little piece of information leads me to believe that she definitely came and went from Robert's room and wanted to pay the servant for not saying anything. That's just my interpretation, though. She had been tossing and turning in her bed, the sheets twisting around her legs and tying her into a tangled mess. Angrily, she kicked off the sheets and let them fall to the floor. Once they hit the floor, she let her head hit the pillow. She often couldn't sleep. Her mind was never at rest for there were so many things that she had to worry about. Most often, it was the pressures from her council that troubled her. What answer was she to give them? But tonight, there was only one thing on her mind. Him. His fingers, his hands, his arms, his legs, his feet, his toes, his chest... She made a noise of frustration and turned onto her side. Everything about him was floating around her mind tonight. His dark eyes were there teasing her, willing her to try to sleep when she could be thinking about him. He was just as maddening in her dreams as he was in life! She could toss and turn no longer. Quickly, but as quietly as she could, she got out of her bed. She needed him. Not in her dreams, but in the flesh. It wasn't a hard task to accomplish as long as she kept as quiet as possible. Being sly wasn't difficult for her and she couldn't help but think of all the times she had snuck around with Robert when they were children. Her lips starting to spread into a smile, but she put her hand to her mouth to stop it. Robert had a suite of rooms adjoining hers. She needed him near her at all times, even if his presence was muffled by walls. Now all she had to do was take the key she had to Robert's room and slowly unlock and open it. With the door slightly ajar, she could see his body curled up in sleep. His back was to her, making his face completely hidden. Slowly, closing the door, she crept over to his bed and gently climbed in. He stirred slightly, making her smile. She leaned as close to his ear as she could without touching it and whispered, \"Robin,\". He groaned her name and turned onto his back, but he still did not seem to realize she was there. She was having a little bit of fun toying with him. Hadn't he been toying with her in her dreams? \"Robin,\" she whispered again. \"Elizabeth?\" he rasped, his voice heavy with sleep. It couldn't have sounded more attractive to her. He shook his head as if to make sure he was seeing properly. \"Bess? What are you doing here?\" She stared at him for a moment, unsure of what to say. \"I couldn't sleep.\" she replied simply. She felt like a little child as she waited for Robert's reply. Suddenly, she regretted coming to his room. She must look pathetic. \"Then you've come to the right place,\" he smiled seductively and brushed her hair from her face. She laughed, relieved that he hadn't made fun of her for being so childish. Instead, from all appearances, he thought she had made the wisest decision to come to his room. As she leaned back on the pillow, he rolled his body over hers, supporting his weight with his forearms. \"Why, sweetheart, could you not sleep?\" he asked. She noted the sincerity in his voice and decided to tell him the truth. \"My bed was cold,\" she whispered, assuming he would realize the hidden meaning behind her words. \"That can easily be remedied,\" he said into her ear, making her eyes roll back in pleasure. \"You know nothing can truly happen between us,\" Elizabeth pointed out, regaining her senses. \"Why is that? You know I love you and desire to be your husband above all else. As I've said before it is my duty to obey and serve you above all others. Can you blame me for desiring to take that one step further? Marry me, Bess. We will provide the country the heirs they want so much and I promise that your bed will never be cold again.\" Her heart seemed to constrict painfully as the subject not only brought up her fear of marriage, but her desire to be married to him despite the fear. \"I told you when I was eight that I would never get married. I still believe that. I'm married to my country. I am a queen first and a woman second. It's the sacrifice that I make for my people.\" He was still looming over her, inches from her face and she could feel his breath against her face. Her heart was beating fast and she was mortified to think that he could tell. \"I could make you a woman first,\" he replied, slipping his hand up her thighs. Her body instantly reacted and for a moment she let herself give into the pleasure that spread throughout her body. He leaned forward to kiss her neck, her collarbone, her breasts. As his hand crept higher up her thigh, she quickly came to her senses, and pushed his hand away and turned from him quickly. \"I cannot...we cannot do this.\" Robert, struggling to swallow his obvious frustration, answered, \"Yes, we can. Marry me, Bess and we can do whatever we wish. I can always be there to comfort you, to give you pleasure and none of it will be a sin. None of it will wrong. Anger rose in her breast. She was torn between her head and her heart. \"No. No. No. We cannot.\" \"Bess, what are you so afraid of? Do you think I'll be like your father? It pains me to know that you would ever believe that I would treat you so.\" \"I've known many men that make promises that they do not keep.\" \"Bess,\" he reached out to her and grabbed her in an embrace. \"I shall never be that kind of man.\" Elizabeth did not want to, but she found herself softly crying. \"Do not cry, sweetheart. We shall talk of it no more.\" Elizabeth nodded slowly, once again feeling like a little child. She never wanted to be vulnerable, especially to any man, but she knew that in this moment she had to be. \"Can you...can you just hold me? It's all I can promise you now, Robin.\" He looked at her tear stained face and the slight look of helplessness on her face. He wanted more than just to hold her, but it was a comfort to know that he was the one that she came to when she was in her weakest moments, when she was the woman and not the Queen. He leaned her back onto the bed and she placed her head on his shoulder. With his arms around her and the beating of his heart under her ear, she drifted off to sleep.[Chapter 4] This one shot is inspired by the story of a little boy giving Elizabeth flowers while she was imprisoned in the Tower. It probably had nothing to do with Robert Dudley, but I like to believe that he was the prisoner trying to communicate with Elizabeth through the flowers. This is fiction and fanfiction so I can write about it if I want to! ;) Told through Robert's perspective. I may write a companion piece from Elizabeth's perspective. I will have more one shots coming soon. I had to take a break because school was sucking the creativity out of me (sort of the opposite of what school should be doing, but that's neither here nor there). Her head was turning towards him and he caught her slight surprise at seeing him. She recovered quickly and if it wasn't for his familiarity with the girl behind the princess, no one would have ever seen it. His lips curved into a smile and he bowed slightly. There she was. The Lady Elizabeth, daughter of Henry VIII, heir to the throne. They had been close since they were children, but after Lady Jane Grey's disastrous reign and his subsequent imprisonment for his participation, he hadn't seen much of her. He could see all of her now. Her pretty pale skin framed by fiery red hair, her dark eyes that looked as if they could see straight into his soul. She wasn't the most beautiful woman he had ever seen. His wife was much prettier, but Elizabeth had the most mesmerizing face he had ever laid eyes on. Since his imprisonment, he was allowed visits from his wife. It a was welcome relief from the dark and dank scenery of the Tower. Amy's eyes always lit up when she saw him and she was always filled with wifely concern. But all of Amy's beauty was shattered by one look at Elizabeth. He had never seen her mother, but he had heard whispers of Elizabeth's shocking resemblance to her. Anne Boleyn was apparently not a typical beauty, but her charms made her more appealing than any English Rose. Elizabeth's coloring made her deceptively Tudor, but it was obvious that at heart she was thoroughly Boleyn. It was evident in the way she could entice him with one glance, how he felt forever drawn to her. Her lips parted to reveal a smile. In her hands was a bouquet of flowers given to her by a little boy during her walks in the privy garden. She raised them to her nose, took in their scent, and then cocked her head to the side and stared pointedly at him. He knew that she was asking if he had anything to do with the flowers that had been delivered to her daily by the little boy. He merely gave her a smirk and placed his hand over his heart. She broke out into laughter and he knew that she had gotten the message. Pulling one of the flowers from the bouquet, she broke the stem in half and placed it in her hair. Never had she looked more radiant than she did now, with the flower in her russet curls and a bright smile adorning her face. He was happy to know that he had a hand in her happiness, but he was not fooled by her high spirits. Underneath her dark eyes were heavy shadows and lines of worry crept across her face. She had the strength of several men, but he knew the memories of her mother and cousin who hadn't left the Tower alive were probably eating away at her. There was a part of him that would gladly sacrifice his own neck for hers, but there was another part of him that knew that wouldn't be necessary. She didn't need any saving. He brought his fingers up to his lips and kissed them softly. She did the same and turned from him slowly. He knew that he had spent enough time with her and at any moment a guard would tell him to move. Even though he took a step away from her, every part of his body was resisting. In the distance he heard Elizabeth asking the boy how she looked and his response that she was the prettiest lady he had ever seen. As he turned to look once more at her, she did the same and their eyes caught for a brief moment. It was over as soon as it began, but if he had to face the executioner's axe he would take that last sweet glimpse with him to his grave.[Chapter 5] This is my first AU one shot. I've always wanted to write one for them, but I could never get it on paper. I've never written AU and I find it especially hard writing AU for history. Bess and Robin are the only historical couple that I think I could write AU for. I can't help imagining them together as an actual couple. I hope to write a few more AU ones, but they won't be in any order. The title comes from the song The Consort by Rufus Wrainwright. He supposedly wrote it about Elizabeth and Robert after watching Elizabeth with Cate Blanchett and Joseph Fiennes. Together We'll Wreak Havoc on the Throne Although the Queen would loathe to admit it, she was not always in control. She did her best to always appear to her council and to her people as if she was, but even a queen had her doubts. But to Robert she was not just a Queen. She was also his wife. When she laid her head upon his shoulder at night, she was not just a monarch. She was a woman and that woman was plagued with more worries than the average person could even imagine. The worries she carried were also his. He had dedicated his life to serving her and now this vow was more important than ever, as she was carrying the heir to the throne. Suddenly, his wife's foot gave a solid kick to his leg. He turned to look at her and noticed that her brows were furrowed in concern. He had sensed that she was uneasy all day, but his suspicions were confirmed when he received another kick. \"Bess,\" he whispered softly. \"Bess?\". \"What?\" Her voice was laced with a tinge of annoyance and she didn't open her eyes. \"You seem to be ill at ease.\" \"Oh? And what gave you that impression?\" She wasn't going to admit to anything without a fight. He should have expected that. Moving closer to her, he wrapped his arms around her tiny frame in the hopes that she would feel safe in his arms. \"I am your husband and I know you better than anyone.\" As she turned to face him, he gave her a smirk. She rolled her eyes, but he could feel her relax in his arms. \"And I am your Queen and I am telling you that nothing is wrong\". \"Yes, but I am bound to protect you and how can I do that without knowing what is on your mind? Don't look at me like that. I know something is worrying you. Just tell me what it is and I can help make it go away.\" \"Clever, Robin, but your argument is flawed for I have told you what is worrying me and that is nothing\". \"I don't believe you.\" \"Why is that?\" \"Besides being your husband, you have been kicking me all night. You always kick in your sleep when something is bothering you.\" \"I do?\" Her blacks eyes were wide in shock. \"I do that?\" \"Yes, the bruises on my leg can attest to that.\" \"Perhaps you did something to deserve it.\" she said crossly. Robert ignored her remark. \"No, I don't think that is the case. Nothing is wrong with the baby?\" Elizabeth was silenced by his words. Her eyes darted back and forth as if she was trying to find someway to avoid answering the question. \"It is about the baby.\" she confessed quietly. His eyes grew wide in alarm and he grabbed her swiftly. There was nothing more precious to him than Elizabeth and the baby. He would gladly die himself if it meant keeping them safe. She sensed his fear and quickly quelled it. \"No, the baby and I are fine. It isn't that. It's...\" \"It's what?\" Doing her best to seem nonchalant, she answered him. \"It is just the sex of the baby.\" He should have known that she would be concerned about that. She herself had been born the wrong sex and it had a devastating effect on her mother. \"What do you mean?\" He knew perfectly well what she meant, but he wanted her to explain what she felt out loud. That was the only way she could fully come to terms with it. \"Good Lord, Robert!\" she cried in frustration. \"I mean what if the baby is a girl?\" \"The physicians and astrologers have all predicted a boy\". She looked skeptical. \"All except one. My mother and father were told the same thing and look at how well that turned out\". What she said was true. Her parents were told the same thing and, with the exception of one, they all turned out to be wrong. A boy was the heir everyone was hoping for. It would make sense that the majority of predictions would be a son. Elizabeth would hate to disappoint the people she loved so much. But perhaps they would just be so happy that Elizabeth was going to have an heir at all. For years she had been extremely resistant to marriage. She had managed to duck out of every marriage negotiation prior to Robert. In fact, that was a huge reason why they were allowed to marry in the first place. Elizabeth had made it clear that Robert was the only man she would consent to marry. The Council soon realized that the only way an heir would be born was if she married Robert. Suddenly the security of the succession lay in the hands of a man whose family comprised of two generations of traitors, a man who was flamboyant and bold. But if they were to really examine the situation, Elizabeth's past wasn't so different from Robert's. Elizabeth had many convicted traitors in her family, including her own mother and cousin. Both were held in the Tower for treason, but managed to escape the axe. Elizabeth's life had been embroiled in scandal since her birth and yet she had kept her head and had won the love of her father and her people. If there was anyone who knew how to turn misfortune into triumph, it was her. Surely she could do the same for Robert. It was all about playing up the positive. Even Robert Dudley had to have some better qualities. He had faithfully served Elizabeth and was, above all, an Englishman. The people feared a foreign marriage and Robert would alleviate the fear of the Crown falling into foreign hands. Elizabeth was determined to make the people love Robert as much as she did. And like she did so many times in the past, she succeeded. So much so that their marriage was celebrated by the public and they eagerly turned their attention toward the birth of an heir. Robert was not ignorant of his unusual position. In the past, the burden of providing an heir was the woman's main duty as Consort. This time it was a man that carried this burden upon his shoulders. Although Elizabeth would be carrying the child, Robert was the key other half that helped create it. His reputation had been rehabilitated, but public opinion of him would be sealed by whether the all important heir would arrive. Elizabeth had made no bones about reminding him of his place. \"You are not the King. I am the King and you are my Consort. You would do well to remember that.\" She was firm and unyielding on this point. Falling to his knees, he vowed that she had no master, but he had a mistress. He would always answer to her. \"Of course,\" he could not help reminding her with a smirk, \"not in our bedchamber.\" She had scoffed and slapped him lightly on the arm before giving him a kiss. It was just like Elizabeth to be commanding one minute and so damn tempting the next. He always remembered his place out of the bedchamber. Robert was a quiet force behind Elizabeth. Influential when he needed to be and unassuming when he didn't. His actions as Consort even seemed to change the Council's opinion of him. Many a time the possibility of marriage to Elizabeth seemed nonexistent, but here Robert was looking at his pregnant wife. It seemed as if all her hopes depended on what his answer might be. \"What if he isn't a girl?\" he replied, hoping to soften her concerned brow. \"Then I wouldn't be asking the question, Robin.\" she said, looking at him as if she couldn't believe how daft he was. \"I'm not really concerned about the public's reaction.\" \"You think I would not love the child if it was a girl?\" She nodded slightly. \"And that you would no longer love me.\" It broke his heart that she would ever think that he could stop loving her. There had never been a moment when he did not love her. \"Elizabeth,\" he said, moving closer to her. As usual, she never lost her fire for very long. \"Don't 'Elizabeth' me. I want to know. My father stopped loving my mother because I was a girl.\" \"That is not true. It was not your fault.\" \"It was. I know it was. If I had been a boy, maybe I would still have my mother.\" Her eyes glistened with unshed tears. She turned away from him so he would not see her cry. \"But I would not love you if you were a boy.\" She turned quickly back towards him and stared silently. Then her lips parted and she broke out into laughter. He reached forward and captured those lips with his own. When they broke the kiss, he placed his hand on her stomach. \"I promise that I will love our child no matter what as he or she is part of you and there is nothing in the world that would ever make me stop loving you. Besides, you are a women and yet you rule better than any man could.\" Before he knew it, she had thrown herself on top him. She gave him a playful smile. \"So if our child is a boy, what shall we call him?\" \"How about Henry or Edward?\" Her eyes lit up. \"I like Henry. After my father. What if...\" she said, drawing circles on his chest with her finger flirtatiously. \"...we have a daughter?\" He thought for a moment about what her reaction to his suggestion would be. \"I was thinking Anne.\" he said lightly. She grew serious at her words. \"Anne?\" \"Yes, after your mother.\" Elizabeth's love for her mother was a well guarded secret that he felt privileged to know about. He had helped turn her ring into a locket that held a portrait of her on one side and her mother on the other. She spoke often of her father in public, but Robert knew that underneath her words she was also talking about her mother. She was more than one lion's cub. \"Won't that be suspicious? It isn't good to bring up my mother's name in public.\" \"But one of your ladies is named Anne. She will surely attend on you during the birth. It wouldn't be odd to name a daughter after her. And there is the Lady Anne of Cleves.\" \"I suppose, but many will think of my mother.\" \"They may think it, but they do not know it.\" \"King Henry IX or Queen Anne I.\" she said dreamily. \"I like it. My father and my mother. The two bravest people I have ever known.\" She leaned forward and sealed her approval with a kiss. AN: The biggest problem I had with writing AU was deciding just how they would be allowed to marry without Elizabeth forfeiting control. Robert wasn't the issue. He had served as \"honorary Consort\" and didn't ever seem as if he wanted to take Elizabeth's power away from her. I think the image of him as a scheming and power hungry courtier was given to him by his enemies. I don't think Robert was any more ambitious than Elizabeth herself. \"Ambitious\" is often seen as a bad word when applied to Robert and I think that is entirely unfair. Would Elizabeth love Robert so much if he lacked ambition and desire? As much as she like being in control, I don't think she would love someone she could walk all over. The real issue is the Council's and the public's opinion of Robert. Would there be some kind of movement against Elizabeth if she married Robert? Would she lose the trust of those around her? And how would the world react? If this was an AU where Amy Robsart hadn't died mysteriously or didn't exist in the first place, some of the the issues with an Elizabeth/Robert match would disappear. Amy Robsart's death was also the final nail in the coffin for Elizabeth/Robert. If Robert Dudley had been questionable before, he was now beyond question. The mysterious death of his wife seemed proof for some of Robert's evil intentions. The immediate solution was to rehabilitate Robert's image. Elizabeth was a master when it came to this and Robert wasn't so bad at it himself. If Elizabeth was 100% committed to marrying Robert, I have no doubt that she would be successful in changing public opinion of him. Even historically Robert had managed to win over some of his enemies. The two of them combined would make an unstoppable force. Please let me know what your thoughts are about this. I'd love to hear your ideas and suggestions! It truly breaks my heart that Elizabeth and Robert could never fully be together, although I admire Elizabeth so much for her commitment to her responsibilities and duties as queen.[Chapter 6] This is a one shot about Robert and Amy, but it involves his relationship with Elizabeth. The title comes from the traditional Irish folk song \"The Butcher Boy\". \"He courted me my life away And now with me he will not stay\" If you believe in the suicide theory when it comes to Amy's death (which I lean towards), the ending of the song works quite well for that. Although it cuts out some of the lyrics, my favorite version of the song is by Maureen Hegarty. You can find it on Youtube if you are curious. The next chapter will be a continuation of my AU story (Chapter 5 \"Together We'll Wreak Havoc on the Throne\") He Courted Me My Life Away Amy looked at her husband, a man she hadn't seen for so long. Strange that she should be so distant from someone she ought to be so close to. She saw love in his eyes, but it seemed as if he was looking right through her, as if he hardly even saw her. The love in his eyes didn't seem to be directed at her. For a long time, he had convinced her. She had believed that all his love was hers, but now she was starting to see through him . He could be so charming when he wanted to be and she had fallen for it so many years. Not anymore. No longer did she believe that he stayed away because he had to. It was partially true, but it wasn't the only reason. He stayed away so long because he wanted to. Physically he was here, but his heart was back at court and in the hands of a queen. Robert had kissed her and showered her with gifts upon his arrival. As usual, he was full of news from court and hadn't stopped moving for a moment. \"Robert?\" Amy said, hoping he would actually slow down and look at her. \"Robert?\" \"Hmm?\" \"You are not at court now. You can relax.\" \"Oh.\" he replied, as if he was unaware of what he had been doing at all. \"I am very glad to you see.\" she said softly. He gave her his most charming smile. \"And I you.\" Amy looked intently at his dark eyes to see if he really meant what he had said but found that she could no longer tell what was real and what was not. \"Will you stay long?\" she inquired hopefully. He shook his head. \"I'm needed back at court.\" \"Of course.\" she muttered. \"What?\" Amy ignored him and pressed forward with what she really wanted to know. \"Why must you always go?\" \"Amy, I have a very important position at court.\" He grabbed her hands tenderly and she was reminded once again how very convincing he could be. He did have a very important position at court. A very important position with his beloved queen. She pulled her hands away. \"Robert, you tell half truths and pretend that they are full.\" His forehead creased in confusion. Oh, he was very good at deceit! Almost as good as Elizabeth herself. Maybe they did belong to... Amy couldn't take it anymore. If he wouldn't admit it freely, she was going to make him. \"You are in love with her. You've always loved her!\" \"What are you talking about?\" He reached for her hands again, but she swiftly moved away from him. \"You know full well what I'm talking about. Or shall I say who? Elizabeth ! You love Elizabeth!\" She was frantic now. For some time the feeling had built up inside of her. Anger and frustration mixed with such a grave sadness. Denial had worked for awhile, but it was no longer a comfort. She would tell him how she felt. She would make him tell the truth if it was the last thing she did. \"I've heard things. Even as far away as I am, I've heard things. They say you two plan to kill me. That I shall die so you can marry her.\" \"You don't really believe that?\" \"No, but the fact that people are saying these things is telling. If there was nothing but cordial friendship between you, why would they be saying such vile things?\" She was crying now, uncontrollable tears that had been threatening to fall for so long. \"Why did you even marry me?\" \"Amy, stop...\" He caught her around the waist and tried to calm her down. She knew what he was doing and she was not going to fall for it. Not now. Not ever. \"Don't touch me and don't say anything! You love her. I saw how you looked at her at our wedding. How she looked at you. Our wedding day! Tell me the truth.\" She was begging now, but she didn't care if she looked weak or pathetic. \"Don't lie to me to save my feelings. Lies will hurt me more. Please tell me the truth.\" \"If I speak the truth or tell a lie, I would be hurting you either way.\" Her heart dropped to the floor with a thud. No amount of preparation could have made this feel any better. She had asked for an answer, but she wasn't fully aware of how much it would hurt. \"That's it. That is all I needed.\" \"I'm so sorry, Amy.\" he replied with genuine regret. Even though he had hurt her, she couldn't stand to see him in pain so she forced a small smile on her face. \"Don't apologize. You can't tell the heart what it should want.\" Take it from me. He seemed unsure of what to say and merely nodded his head. She looked away from him to signal that the conversation was over. With a parting glance, he turned from her to leave. The image of him walking away from her would be forever imprinted in her mind. An eery premonition swept over her that this would be the last time she ever saw him. Suddenly dying didn't seem so awful. She knew she was sick and that death might not be too far away. What did life matter now anyway? Robert no longer loved her and now she was unsure if he ever did. She wasn't trained for court life. She was meant to be a country wife, but it seemed she was merely a shadow of what a wife should. Dying might be an unexpected blessing. Perhaps then they could both be happy.[Chapter 7] Okay, this is not the continuation to my AU story. Editing turned into adding and I don't want to post it until it is completely ready. But I also didn't want to leave these one shots sitting so here is this one! It is about Elizabeth's reaction to Robert's relationship with Lady Douglas Sheffield. I believe I read that she looked a bit like Katherine Howard (Douglas' maiden name was Howard!). I take that to mean she was either petite and curvy or a redhead with dark eyes. There are way too many redheads in the Elizabethan court so I made her blonde with blue eyes! I imagined her as the actress Margot Robbie if you want a visual. Alright...enough talking! A Fragile Line Her eyes scanned the crowd until she saw it. The bouncing blonde curls adorned with pearls. The blazing red dress. The wide flirtatious smile. Elizabeth gripped onto the arm of her chair at the sight of her. Just who did Douglas Sheffield think she was? She looked as if she was having a little too much fun. Did anyone believe that mask of virtue she put on during the day? Elizabeth sure didn't. She knew very well that she unveiled herself at night and she knew just who unmasked her. Her eyes didn't have to drift far from Lady Douglas to find him. She would recognize his tall frame and the proud tilt of his head anywhere. All of that belonged to her not Lady Douglas. She might be thinking he was hers at this very moment, but Elizabeth was sure she would never have his heart. She knew that to be true. But the painful constriction of her own heart made her think otherwise. Why did she feel that pang of jealousy whenever she saw her? She wanted to tear that stupid smile right off of her face and burn that vulgar red dress. Elizabeth's rage was strong enough for two. It wasn't only Lady Douglas that she wished to crush. She also wanted to hurt the man that accompanied her in her wicked deeds. If Robert thought he could get away with this kind of behavior, he was certainly wrong. The worst part is that he thinks I don't know. She motioned for him to come over when he caught her eye. There was something animalistic about the way he strode towards her. Under that sophisticated exterior was a passionate interior that she longed to fully experience for herself. She wondered what it was like to be beneath him, his eyes blazing with a desire that only she could satisfy. What would it be like to succumb to that kind of pleasure? To be one like God seemed to have intended them to be? He knelt before her and kissed her hand. It was a familiar gesture, but she always felt something different when it was performed by Robert. The feel of his lips against her hand made a light, warm feeling rush up her arm to her chest. \"Dance with me now, Robin.\" she whispered. Her words were laced with a tinge of venom and sensuality. \"Play a Volta!\" she called with a flourish of her hand. It was Lady Douglas' turn to stare. It was her turn to be jealous. Watch and see who really owns his heart. She had never wanted to possess him more than she did at this moment. Her skin tingled from his touch. They were so close now. All she had to do was press her lips to his and they would be one. If we were alone, the things I would do... Love and hate mixed in her breast and she was unsure of which emotion was the strongest. From which did the desire to run her nails down his back spring from? How long could the tension build until it was uncontrollable? Just as the feeling was becoming unbearable, the music faded away. All she was left with was a burning sensation from where his hands had been. Elizabeth usually enjoyed seeing Robert on his knees. There was something about his complete submission that made her pulse race with desire. But now her desire was replaced with anger. \"Is the baby yours?\" her voice shook with rage. Not only did Lady Douglas have him in her bed, but now she had his own flesh and blood as well? \"Elizabeth, I...\" \"Yes or no?\" She didn't want to hear his excuses. She wanted to hear the truth. Her entire body was shaking with barely suppressed rage. Did he think flowery words would appease her? He dropped his dark eyes. She had her answer. \"No, no, no!\" Pacing the room, she knocked over whatever she encountered. She wanted everything in the room to be broken. Just as broken as my heart. \"You thought I would not find out, didn't you? You thought you could do what you pleased without suffering the consequences! I must remind you that you answer to me. I have the power to utterly ruin you.\" \"Bess...\" The sound of his voice made her pause. She didn't want to ask the next question that arose on her lips, but the pain in her heart forced her to speak. \"Do you love her?\" Every second without his answer made her chest tighten until she had to lash out even more. \"Did you tell her you would marry her? Did you whisper lovely things in her ear? Did you tell her she was the only one for you? Speak!\" \"I haven't the words to tell you how I truly feel.\" he replied slowly. \"What is that suppose to mean?\" He finally stood up and began to move towards her. His face was so close to hers that she could feel his warm breath. Whenever he was close to her, she felt all of her resistance melt away. It took so much effort to build it up and so little to tear it down. Why did she have to feel this way about him? There were some who thought she was incapable of functioning as a natural woman should and some who thought she wasn't a woman at all. She knew all too well that she was. Tell me you don't love her. \"I only love you.\" His eyes never left hers as he said the words. My Eyes. Those eyes had always looked out for her and had always told her the truth. She pressed her lips fiercely to his. She wanted to taste the words his lips spoke. He responded with the same urgency and soon his hands were exploring her body. Her mind cursed her burdensome clothing, the hoops and layers upon layers that prevented her from being even closer to him. Always destined to be so close and yet so far. Sensibility started to slip away and she knew she was close to coming completely undone. She wanted to press her hips against his, to know what his skin felt like upon her own. She wanted to know what he truly felt like, just this once. If only she could be another woman for a moment. If only she could be a lowly servant that could afford this one indulgence. If only his son could be hers. Why must she deny herself what even the lowliest in her kingdom could have? Because you are a Queen. The words rang in her ears until she gathered the strength to tear her lips from his. \"I can't.\" She was a Queen and she had promised herself to England. She was bound to different rules. His haughty dark eyes flashed in anger at her refusal. \"You are the cruelest mistress, Bess. Do you delight in taking my affections and playing with them?\" In another life I would be yours and you would be mine. The look on his face was more than wounded pride. It looked like she had taken out his heart, broken it right before him, and then made him pick up the pieces. He truly wanted her. She could give him titles, money, and a few stolen embraces, but never all of her. She saw in him everything she wanted, but a Queen could not have everything she desired. It seemed if she showed too much emotion, she was deemed ill fit to be a Queen and if she showed no emotion, she wasn't a human at all. How could she ever explain to him this fragile line she had to walk? She closed her eyes tightly, hoping that if she didn't see it, it didn't exist. Everything hurt and she could do nothing about it. Nothing but wish it gone. In another life I would give you everything. My heart. My body. My soul. But even a Queen couldn't control matters of the heart. Why must she want what she could not have? It was the worst curse imaginable. \"Please go.\" Elizabeth bit her lip to stop from crying out as she watched him leave. The look on his face would haunt her for the rest of her nights. The tension she had been carrying suddenly gave way to weakness. Her knees buckled and she dropped to the floor. I must always let you go.[Chapter 8] The Maiden and The Captor Okay so this is part one of...many... The prompt boils down to something along the lines of, \"Elizabeth and Robert have time alone together\". I clearly like imagining this very much because it's nowhere close to being finished! I'm not even entirely sure what the ending is! I do have a bit of the second part written, but I don't know exactly when I'll have it finished. Hopefully there aren't too many mistakes. The words were starting to blur together so I thought it was time to post it! He heard the sound of leaves crunching and turned to see a figure hooded in a velvet cloak. Was that her idea of a disguise? He laughed softly to himself. Only Elizabeth would believe this outfit was appropriate for the situation. She could never be anything but a queen. It was in her blood. She rushed up to him breathless, her cheeks bright spots of red against her pure white skin. He couldn't help but find the way her chest heaved and the way her black eyes shone awfully appetizing. His body started to lean forward, but he told himself to hold back and wait until they were truly alone. Before he knew what happened, her lips were pressed against his. If she wanted to, who was he to tell her no? When she broke the kiss and backed away he saw her eyes wide in surprise. \"A little eager, are we?\" he lifted his dark brows in jest. She squeezed her lips together in annoyance. \"You know there is nothing stopping me from turning around and leaving.\" \"I was merely teasing. Well, partly...\" She gave him a disapproving glare, but the way she easily let him swing her onto the horse told him she felt otherwise. He swung himself onto the saddle behind her. There was hardly a space between them and it made his desire for her increase painfully. Elizabeth wasn't helping by leaning her body against his. He did not doubt that she was doing it intentionally. She turned and pressed her lips to his neck. Robert no longer cared if they were outside. The dark cloud of night was hiding them from the world. He captured her lips with his own, desperate to possess her. He sensed hesitation from her lips, but any resistance from her soon slipped away. It was the impatience of his horse that caused their lips to part. She turned her face away from his quickly. \"Let's go before the beast throws us both.\" \"As you wish, your Majesty.\" When they arrived at the lodge Robert had suggested, she seemed to be having seconds thoughts. She lingered by the horse and scanned the surrounding woods. \"There's no one here, right?\" She shifted slightly on her feet and he could sense her hesitancy. \"I sent them all away and with plenty of money to keep them quiet.\" \"You make it sound as if we are committing a crime.\" He instantly regretted his phrasing. \"Loving is not a crime, Bess.\" Her eyebrows creased to form a frown. \"It can be.\" He knew exactly what she was thinking of. Suddenly she looked like the frightened girl who told him she would never marry. \"You're under no obligation to me, Bess.\" Her eyes lit up at his words. \"Of course, I am under no obligation to you. I am under no obligation to anyone!\" Every word he said was coming out wrong. He was beginning to realize he had absolutely no idea what he was doing. Why had he asked her to come in the first place? What was he expecting to happen? He knew what he wanted to happen, but he was completely unsure of what was really going to take place. It wasn't like him to be so flustered around a woman, but seeing her bright red hair gleaming against the green of her cloak made him realize that she wasn't merely a woman. She was a goddess. For a moment, he marveled at how magnificent the girl he knew as a boy had become. But his unintentional insult had given her a newfound confidence. She lifted her chin in determination and grabbed his hand. \"Let us go inside.\" She looked around the room and turned towards him. \"You're sure there is no one here? How is everything...?\". \"I have my ways, Bess.\" he said, bowing dramatically. He was quite pleased to have pulled it all off. The room was freshly made, but there wasn't anyone in sight besides the two of them. Suddenly she broke out into a laugh. \"How lovely, Robin. Seems you assumed I would come.\" \"I had reason to hope. You rarely go against your word.\" \"I never go against my word,\" she corrected, her tone every inch the regal queen she was. Robert paused long enough for her to pick up on his hesitancy. For a brief second a flash of recognition shone in her eyes, signaling to him that she knew exactly what he was thinking of, but she did not put words to it. She had promised him a few times that she would marry him and many more times she had hinted at marriage. He was still hoping that eventually she would make good on her promise. To give her the answer she wanted, he thought of how she had so far stuck to her girlhood promise of never marrying. \"You never go against a promise.\" She gave him a small smirk to let him know that she knew he was lying, but was happy that she had won and he had conceded more than anything else. She turned capriciously from him and started to wander about the room. \"I'm really alone.\" Robert hadn't moved far from the side of the room, not wanting to make her feel trapped. For now, he was more than content to watch the giddy smile that grew on her lips. \"I'm really alone!\" she said, louder this time. \"I don't think I've ever truly been alone in my entire life.\" She looked about the room in awe and bounced on her toes as if she was dancing. She glided towards him, grabbed his hand, and spun her herself around before backing away from him and tossing herself on the pillows by the fire. \"Come lie with me, Robin.\" she held her arms out to him with a flirtatious smile. Elizabeth was always playful and he was uncertain as to whether her words were just for fun or had any element of something more to them. But that wasn't important now. He would enjoy every moment with her tonight, whether or not it was exactly what he wanted. He took her hands and fell beside her. She let out a coquettish laugh before moving herself closer to him. \"We are alone.\" \"So I've been told.\" Robert teased, receiving a light slap from Elizabeth. Turning away from him, she declared, \"Oh, but you're no fun.\" \"I am a lot of fun.\" \"Show me.\" \"What would you like me to show you?\" She turned back and gave him a sly grin. \"Surprise me.\" He wasn't sure if that was an invitation or a trap, but his heart beat fast at the thought of it being the former. Taking his chances, he placed his hand on her thigh and let it slide up her body. When it reached her breasts, he could feel her take a deep breath and he thought that perhaps... But instead she rolled away from him. He swore that he could hear her laughing softly. She knew exactly what she was doing to him. It seemed she delighted in giving him hope and then denying him. Sometimes he wondered why he let her play this game with him. There was the thrill of the chase, the forbidden fruit, and then there was...this. But he wasn't going to give up that easily. He lunged at her neck and began to kiss it. Elizabeth scrunched her shoulders and began to giggle. \"Now I know what your idea of fun is!\" \"You said you wanted to be surprised.\" \"I'd like to say I was surprised, but isn't that what all men consider fun?\" \"Ah, but cannot a women consider that fun if it is with the right man?\" She briefly paused to consider his words before whispering, \"Do you know what I think is fun?\" Before he could even utter the word \"what\", she had pushed herself off of the floor. \"Catch me!\" she called, as she began dashing around the room. He lifted his eyebrows in surprise at her request. Elizabeth would never consider losing fun, but he was fairly certain he would be winning this game. She ran to the opposite corner of the room, a distance he quickly crossed. When she saw him coming, she turned quickly and leapt onto the bed. Her cheeks were flushed and the sound of her laugh filled the room. There was nothing more beautiful than her smile. It lit up her entire face, smoothing out any tension she carried. If his only legacy was being the man that made her happy, then he would die a content man. \"Are you even trying?\" she called, placing her hands upon her hips like a petulant child. \"Perhaps you are just too good at running.\" he responded, marking the irony of his words before running towards her. When she went to jump off of the bed, it was his arms she fell into. There was a breathless moment when he simply held her in his arms. She pressed her body closer to his and whispered, \"It seems you've caught me. Now that you have caught me, what is it that you want?\" Her lips twisted into a sly smile. \"All this captor asks for ransom is the maiden's heart.\" Her eyebrows raised in suspicion. \"Just the maiden's heart? But she might as well give all of herself for if she gives her heart she has nothing left.\" He picked her up to fully claim her as his own. \"The maiden has uncovered the secret plot! Now does she want to be free or trapped with him forever?\" Elizabeth looked at him knowingly, a hint of sincerity behind the playful light in her eyes. \"It seems she has no choice. Either way she is his forever.\" Robert noted how very vulnerable she was at the moment. It wasn't often that he had any advantage over her. At least he didn't think he had any advantage over her. But the look in her eyes made him realize he did have something. Something that was possibly more powerful than anything. He had her heart. It was something he wished he had, hoped he had, but was never entirely sure he had. As much as he didn't want to admit to it, he needed reassurance. He needed to be reminded of her love when she flirted with other men, when she was in the midst of marriage negotiations. And now, with her emotions showing clearly in her eyes, he wanted to see just how much she loved him. \"But,\" he said as he placed her upon the pillows. \"If she does not give her heart willingly, perhaps it's best to let her go.\" For a moment, panic flashed across her face. The confident mask that pretending gave her began to falter. She sat up quickly and looked up at him. \"Does anyone willingly give their heart? Aren't we all fortune's fools when it comes to love?\" \"From experience, this man can say yes.\" \"Then the maiden and the captor are in agreement on something.\"[Chapter 9] Author's Note: Wow. How long have I neglected to update? Five years? I'm the worst. Here's the first fic I've been able to finish in a long time. It's an AU. Elizabeth and Robert secretly marry in the summer of 1566 and welcome their first child, Anne, the following year. This is just a little fic about them all being cute together. There's a gifset and a description of their daughter that goes along with this on my tumblr. I'll post the link in my bio. I'm sure there's two billion mistakes since I'm the only one who edited it and all the words are currently blurring together. Apologies in advance. Thank you to everyone who has read these fics, reviewed, or followed. It makes me ridiculously happy every time. \"He's still so young.\" Elizabeth's voice cut through the silence that had descended upon them for the last few miles. \"He shouldn't be so far away from his mother.\" She was anxious. He could tell by the distant look in her eyes, staring straight ahead but focusing on nothing, and the way she chewed on her fingernails. Robert laughed softly. \"Why do I think he'll always be too young to be far from his mother?\" Her eyes were suddenly focused and staring pointedly at him. \"As if you won't chase away every single one of Anne's suitors,\" Elizabeth shot back. \"I think Anne will be just as hard to please when it comes to suitors as I am.\" Elizabeth pursed her lips, but nodded her head to concede that he was right. There was a slight pause before he said quietly, \"But isn't she rather young for that?\" Elizabeth's lips relaxed into a smile and it was now her turn to laugh. \"See?\" she said, poking him in the arm. \"You tease me, but you're no different.\" He was glad to see her smile, even if it was at his expense. Getting her to genuinely smile was a challenge the past few weeks and he was proud whenever he could get one to appear. \"Thank God we could finally get out of London,\" she told him, letting out a sigh of relief. \"I was about to go mad. He's just too young to be away from his mother.\" For all his teasing, he was genuinely concerned about how often she repeated that phrase. She hated every second their children were out of her sight and demanded that she receive frequent updates about their health and if she felt these letters were not frequent enough, she'd send several messengers herself. For a woman who lost family member after family member, he couldn't blame her, but he worried she'd soon make herself sick. When she stepped out of the coach, she squeezed his hand. She was significantly happier knowing that she was moments away from being with her children and he himself felt a significant weight lifted off his shoulders. Anne was always the first to greet them. She was determined to be first at everything. Robert imagined the scuffle that would ensue once her brother was old enough to give her a fair fight. Recent letters informed them that Anne was working on what she referred to as her \"mother walk\". With the keen eyes of a hawk, Anne watched her mother's every move, storing everything she saw in her mind so she could practice doing it herself later. Anne was quite excited to show off her royal walk. She walked towards them, as stately as she could. Anne didn't need to feign the appearance of elegance, with her unusually tall stature, swan-like neck and long fingers, but she was at heart a wild spirit that would forever masquerade as being tamed. After a few more steps she paused and looked towards Elizabeth, who nodded her head, indicating that she had done a very good job at walking like a princess. Anne nodded her head in return and bowed. Once she stood upright again, a bright smile broke out across her face and she abandoned all decorum as she rushed towards her parents. She ran right into her mother's skirts and reached her arms as wide as she could in an attempt to embrace her mother. She released her mother's skirts and ran over to her father to give him her signature greeting of wrapping her arms around his leg. When she was first beginning to walk, she'd grab on to anyone's leg to steady herself. Soon she realized that everyone took it as a mark of favor when the little princess grabbed onto their legs or clutched at their skirts. So long as she remained eye level with legs and skirts, she would continue to do this. He remembered the first time she toddled forward and attached herself to William Cecil's leg, looking up at him with what may or may not have been a mischievous smile. Cecil looked down at her trying to decipher whether he should be concerned about what kind of creature Elizabeth and Robert created or simply admire how skillfully she managed to charm everyone around her. Her charm never seemed to fail her. Even those who begrudged her for simply existing weren't immune. Everybody, even the most skilled politician with a natural distaste for a royal child with Dudley blood, easily dissembled under the strength of her innate ability to make people love her. She raised her arms up, a gesture that meant she wanted her father to hold her. \"You know one day you'll be too big for me to pick up,\" he told her as he lifted her up into his arms. She looked at him as if he had said the most absurd statement she had ever heard. \"No, I won't!\" \"Yes, you will!\" \"You're so strong, though, Father. You're the strongest man in the world!\" He could hear Elizabeth making a poor attempt at holding back laughter. Anne was still at the age where she was thoroughly convinced there was no one alive or dead that could quite match up to her mother and father. When she said her father was the strongest man in the world, she meant it. But it was quite apparent that she knew the effect she had on her father. She was particularly adept at manipulating men. Robert looked over at Elizabeth. He knew exactly where Anne inherited this skill. She never used these tactics on her mother, though. They had a wordless bond that needed no explanation from either of them. A smile - no - more like a smirk or a conspiratorial grin would pass between them. They understood each other. She resembled his side of the family and whenever he looked at her he saw the happy family he once had and his chance to replicate what his parents had so lovingly created. But she was truly her mother in every other way. With each passing year the resemblance became more and more apparent and it soon was clear that she was a miniature version of Elizabeth dressed up in Dudley colors. She was a Boleyn. He was reminded of the day he knelt down in front of her mother, bowed his head, and swore he would die for her. He would do the same for their daughter and he had no doubt that many other men would follow suit. \"And you are the prettiest and smartest girl in the world.\" \"Just like Mother?\" Anne asked, her eyes filled with hope, anxiously awaiting her father's response, for she wanted nothing more than to be like Elizabeth. \"Just like your mother.\" Even Elizabeth couldn't resist that. Anne wiggled her legs, a sign that she wanted Robert to put her down. Once her feet hit the ground, she grabbed both of their hands and pulled them forward. \"Let's go see Brother.\" As she led them down the hall, she went through the list of everything that happened since she'd last seen them. \"Brother doesn't walk as well as I do. He always falls down.\" Elizabeth was highly amused, but she swallowed her laughter. \"Well, that's because he's still a baby. You, Anne, are a little lady.\" \"Princess!\" she corrected her mother. He noticed Elizabeth cringe slightly when she realized her mistake. She had never forgotten the day she noticed that everybody had stopped addressing her as the Princess Elizabeth. \"You're quite right. You are a little princess, but you used to be just as small as your brother. You didn't walk well either.\" \"That's not true!\" she cried. If you asked Anne, she was always good at everything. \"It is true! You just don't remember.\" Anne thought it over and by the look on her face, it seemed she didn't quite accept that as fact, but she moved on. \"I'm going to help him, though, Mother. I'm going to make him better. Isn't that what you told me?\" Robert recalled Elizabeth telling her daughter that it was her job to help her brother and teach him everything she knew. \"He'll be a good king one day if you help him because you are so very talented yourself.\" Anne was the type of person that needed to seem useful and in charge of things. She had been the center of attention for years and she didn't want her feeling displaced. It seemed to work for now, as Anne kept babbling on about everything she was going to teach him. \"That seems like a lot, Anne,\" Elizabeth replied. \"Oh, I won't teach him all at once. Some people just can't learn as fast as I can.\" She suddenly stopped her in tracks and dropped both of their hands. She motioned for her father to come towards her and then pointed towards the ground. Robert had learned this meant she had something very important to tell him because she always demanded that he must be at the same level as her when discussing something serious. One time it had been to inform him that he smelled like horses and another time when she was first beginning to talk, she simply uttered the words \"new dress\" and then pointed to Elizabeth's. She promptly received several new gowns as Elizabeth always supplied her daughter with an overwhelming number of garments to choose from, the memory of having to endure wearing ill-fitting clothes as a child always in her mind. Robert knelt down and waited for what new issue their princess would raise today. Never had he seen her look as uncertain as she did now. Anne was usually overflowing with confidence. He reached forward and playfully twirled a strand of her nearly black hair around his finger. She gave a small smile, but swatted his hand away. God forbid he ruin her beloved hair. She held his hands, most likely in a attempt to stop him from touching her hair, but he couldn't help but be reminded of the first time she wrapped her hand around his finger. \"Father, I know boys are more important than girls, but…\" He quickly interrupted her. \"Whoever told you that?\" \"Well, if they weren't more important, then I would be Queen after mother. I'm the eldest.\" He supposed he should have known she'd ask about this one day, but he hadn't expected it so soon, especially when moments ago she had seemed so content with being her brother's teacher. Now that she had broached the subject, he wasn't entirely sure what to say. Elizabeth had taken a step back to give them privacy and he now noticed that she was no longer even facing them. She worried about every single thing when it came to her children, but her biggest fear was that her children would turn on each other, like her own royal siblings had. Suddenly everything hinged on the words he'd say next. So he told her the only thing he could to explain away her fears. \"Let me tell you, Anne, that every man in England will forever bow down at your feet. You are far more important than all the other sons out there.\" From the moment he first held her in his arms and she looked up at him, he knew instantly that she was worth more than everyone else's sons combined. Every thing she did reminded him of how much he loved her. He loved the way she'd nuzzle her face against his neck when he held her. He even loved her stubborn and demanding nature and how she'd say \"Father, kisses!\" as if it was more of a command than a request. Before her brother was born, he would've ran his sword through any man that dared comment on her sex. He didn't know how other men felt about their daughters, but he felt his daughter was exceptional in everything she did. A sly grin spread across her face. She lifted her chin and her somber eyes began to sparkle. \"Father, show me how they will bow to me.\" Robert paused for a moment and noticed that Elizabeth had turned around and was stifling a laugh. He would have usually make some quip that \"she was certainly her mother's daughter\", but decided he'd let her have this one. Elizabeth raised her eyebrows and nodded for him to proceed. Robert stood up and his tall frame executed the most exquisite bow to the petite little girl in front of him. Anne clapped her hands in delight. \"All men must bow to me like that?\" Robert nodded. She held out her arms and he lifted her up into his arms. Her face grew serious again. \"So you still love me just as much as you did before Brother was born?\" \"There's nothing in this world or the next that would ever make me stop loving you and everyday I'll love you more, if that's possible.\" She smiled. \"Kisses!\" He laughed and kissed her before setting her back down on her feet. \"Let's go see your brother.\" Elizabeth smirked as she came to his side. \"Just how tightly does she have you wrapped around her finger? \"Jealous?\" he asked. \"You never were good at sharing.\" She hit him in the arm and he pretended it hurt him much more than it did. \"You had to see that one coming\" she said unapologetically. \"Of course. That's why I said it.\" She rolled her eyes, but a smile danced on her lips. \"You know she'll make you bow like that to her all the time now?\" Robert shrugged. \"There's worse fates for men I suppose.\" More notes: Usually I don't care about using words that didn't exist back then, unless it's like electricity or something, but I did look up the origin of the \"wrapped around her finger\" phrase. One source said it was from medieval falconry (which would work so well) and others said that wasn't true and it first appeared centuries later. Then I just stopped caring and used it anyway lol. It would probably be way too obvious a reference to Anne Boleyn if they named their daughter Anne and it might make more sense to name her something that connects her to royalty, but, as with many other things, I don't care. I want a Princess Anne. No one can stop me. I just can't resist their daughter resembling the Dudley/Boleyn side of her family. The bear and the ragged staff isn't so easily overthrown and I imagine Anne's spirit being like \"bet you thought you saw the last of me.\" Good times.[Chapter 10] I got this prompt on Tumblr so I thought I'd post it here as well: \"Would you consider writing a drabble where Anne lives and gets to meet Robin?\" I wrote four different ones because I can't help myself. Info so this makes a bit more sense…I'm going with Anne eventually giving birth to a son around the same time Edward was born historically and having Henry die at the same time he does historically. In the last drabble, Anne's son is the King, Anne is the Dowager Queen, and Elizabeth is currently first in line to the throne if her brother dies without heirs. The first one takes place prior to Robert's birth in June 1532. \"How many children do you have, my lady?\" Jane Dudley blushed slightly and the soft pink hue on her cheeks made every other feature on her face look brighter, like a singular star lighting up a night sky. \"Four sons and one girl.\" Anne Boleyn gazed down at Jane's rounded stomach, a wistful look on her face. \"You are very blessed. I can think of nothing more honorable than to be a mother. Children are the greatest gift.\" Would motherhood suit her as well as it did Jane Dudley? She very much hoped so. It was her duty to bear the future heirs to the throne, but she wanted motherhood to be fulfilling and not simply a game of numbers. \"I am very blessed,\" she agreed, reaching for Anne's hand and clutching it gently. \"But I have no doubt you shall be blessed yourself in the near future.\" Jane leaned forward with a sly smile and whispered in Anne's ear, \"When you are our Queen.\" The Dudleys were a family that knew how to remain steady despite the changing winds, but they had always been committed reformers. They were ready and willing to serve the queen that was to be. Anne grinned, her eyes burning with desire. \"I very much hope that will be in the near future. I can't wait any longer.\" \"You won't have to,\" Jane reassured her. \"And when you have children yourself, they will bring about a golden world.\" Anne squeezed Jane's hand affectionately to let her know she was thankful for her words. She'd make sure to reward them for their loyalty when the crown firmly rested on her head. \"Your children will be educated right alongside mine. They shall be companions.\" \"I would be very honored, my lady, if my children could be so fortunate.\" \"Is this little Robin?\" Queen Anne exclaimed as she looked at the growing boy standing in front of her. He had inherited his father's dark looks, in sharp contrast to his mother's pale skin and light blue eyes. The boy's eyes looked at her steadily and without fear, but with just enough deference to avoid impropriety. He certainly didn't lack for spirit, though. \"I am Robin, but I am not so little. I'm five years old now!\" he replied, boldly. Anne turned to his mother and saw her face grow pale with mortification. \"Robert,\" she began sternly, but Anne's laughter, ringing throughout the room like the tinkling of a bell, cut her off. \"Five years old!\" Anne began to count the years on her fingers. \"One, two, three, four…\" Robert held out his own finger. \"One more.\" \"Ah, yes! Five!\" she said and held out her entire hand for him to see. \"You're my whole hand.\" Robert looked down at his own hand as if this was a profound revelation. \"Why, you'll be a man in no time at all. You know, Elizabeth won't let me call her little, either. Mother's will always want their children to stay small, though.\" He was too young to understand what she meant, but he nodded along as if he did. \"You know how small you were when I first met you?\" He shook his head. Anne knelt down so she was nearly eye-level with him. \"You were still in your mother's stomach.\" Robert's eyes grew wide in amazement and he looked at his mother to confirm if this was true. Jane nodded her head and smiled. \"I have been Her Majesty's friend for a very long time.\" \"Mother says you're a real queen.\" \"I am,\" she confirmed, with a look of clear satisfaction on her face. She had fought hard to be recognized as England's true queen. \"You are the most beautiful queen I have ever seen.\" Anne found this sentiment endearing even though she knew she was the only queen he had ever seen. She was charmed by this forward little boy and the way he spoke so plainly to her. He reminded her of her own precocious daughter, who was eyeing him warily from across the room. \"Since I am a real queen, that makes my daughter a real princess,\" Anne told him and motioned for Elizabeth to come over. \"You two knew each other when you were still babies.\" Elizabeth looked at her mother skeptically before turning back to the boy in front of her. Robert didn't wait for the suspicious girl in front of him to speak first and quickly introduced himself. \"My name is Robert and I am five years old.\" \"I am four,\" Elizabeth replied with as much dignity as she could muster. Only her furrowed eyebrows gave away how terribly annoyed she was that she wasn't five as well. \"I'm older!\" Robert practically shouted with excitement, as if this accident of birth was a point of pride. Older meant wiser, didn't it? His mother gave him a look, so this time he leaned in close to Elizabeth and whispered it. \"I'm older.\" \"But I am a princess.\" That was always Elizabeth's winning card. What was one more year of life when she was a princess? Both mothers were silent as they waited to see what turn this conversation would take. Their children were quite…outspoken. It was endearing to their mothers, but neither child had ever met their match and no one knew if this would end well or in utter destruction. \"Yes, you are a princess,\" Robert agreed. \"And you're the prettiest princess I've ever seen.\" Anne and Jane looked at each with barely contained amusement. He had managed to turn the conversation in his favor and effectively end an ensuing quarrel. Elizabeth stared at him for a few moments and then, when she decided that his answer was satisfactory, she nodded her head. \"And you are older.\" They shall be companions. Well, Robert and Elizabeth did indeed become companions, but in a way that Anne hadn't anticipated at the time she spoke those words. They were a curious pair and from a distance, it often seemed as if they didn't like each other at all. They teased each other and fought over trivial things. Everything became a competition and both of them hated to lose. But Anne saw it. Anne saw the quiet moments when Elizabeth leaned over him to read his translation, when they took turns reading from a book. Anne even noticed that anytime Elizabeth turned out to be the victor in their games, after minutes of justifying his loss, Robert would grin at her daughter with something like begrudging admiration in his eyes. \"Robin is handsome, don't you think, Elizabeth?\" Anne asked, causing her daughter's face to suddenly match her hair. \"Maybe you two will get married someday,\" Anne jested lightheartedly. That would make Elizabeth stomp her foot and stammer about in denial. \"We will not! I will never marry, mother, and certainly not him!\" Anne raised her eyebrows. \"If you say so, Elizabeth.\" \"I must say, Lord Robert, that you have grown into a very handsome and witty man,\" Anne said, looking him up and down to assess his qualities as she did every man at court. Clearly, she had found his qualities very satisfactory. Elizabeth's face flushed a bright red as it had when she was a child, but she resisted the urge to stamp her foot this time. Instead, she pursed her lips and looked sternly at her mother Robert avoiding looking at Elizabeth, knowing that acknowledging her embarrassment would only make it worse. \"Well, that is quite a compliment, even more so because it comes from the lips of the most beautiful and intelligent Queen England's ever seen.\" Anne was quite satisfied with that response and tossed a little smirk her daughter's way. Elizabeth rolled her eyes. Anne flirted with every and any handsome man at court. It was always a platonic and innocent game she enjoyed playing, but Anne particularly enjoyed a little witty repartee with her daughter's favorite man at court because she loved her daughter's reaction. Even now at sixteen years old, Anne couldn't help but love to see her daughter's little temper flare. She found it endearing. It always reminded her of when she was a child and would stomp around, her mood just as fiery as the red curls that bounced with every step. Elizabeth would always be her little lion's cub. \"Rob - Lord Robert,\" Elizabeth corrected herself. She wouldn't give her mother any more ammunition by calling him Robin. \"Would you excuse me for a moment? I need to speak with my mother in private.\" \"Of, course Your Highness.\" He bowed towards Elizabeth and then gave an even more exaggerated bow to Anne. \"Your Majesty.\" Elizabeth pulled her mother away and made sure she was far enough away before she spoke. \"Mother, you were flirting with him!\" \"I was merely making an observation. I have eyes, my little cub,\" Anne dismissed her daughter's suggestion with a nonchalant wave of her hand. \"He's young enough to be your son!\" \"Oh, Elizabeth. I was just trying to tease you. You can forgive your mother for wanting to have a little fun, can't you?\" Anne pouted as if her daughter had done her a very grievous wrong. \"Of course,\" Elizabeth sighed, her annoyance receding. She couldn't stay mad at her mother because flirtation was a game she liked to indulge in herself and she admired her mother's vitality. \"Just…we don't have to do that every time he's at court, do we?\" Anne distinctive laughter made a few courtiers turn towards them. She lowered her voice. \"I'm not making any promises.\" Elizabeth linked her arm with her mother's and leaned her head against her shoulder, something that was getting very difficult to do since Elizabeth was becoming an unusually tall woman. \"You know, it's too bad he's marrying that girl from Norfolk.\" \"I heard that wasn't official,\" Elizabeth replied quickly, as her head snapped back up from her mother's shoulder. \"I can't imagine Robin marrying that little country wench.\" Anne looked at her daughter curiously and Elizabeth's dark eyes grew wide with the realization of what she just said. \"I was simply making an observation,\" she added, in a poor attempt at justifying her intense reaction. \"About a girl you've never met?\" \"I…\" Anne reached forward and stroked her daughter's cheek. \"You know I'm not being serious, don't you?\" Elizabeth smiled and nodded her head. \"Besides, why should you or I care? I thought you were set on making a French match for me.\" \"That is my preference, but it doesn't mean I'm blind to the way you look at him or the way he looks at you.\" Anne knew exactly how this would play out because she had once been young and in love herself, overly consumed with a passionate reckless that, unfortunately, often ended in heartbreak. Anne could not bring her own heart to put an end to it, though. Not when she saw her daughter's face flushed with excitement and her eyes filled with happiness. Being a royal was often stifling, but right now her daughter was a burning flame that illuminated everything in her path and Anne couldn't be the one to douse it. \"He's got such fine eyes,\" Elizabeth whispered to her mother, as if she was gossiping with a friend. \"Dark blue with…\" \"Little spots of brown. \"And his calves. He's got such fine calves.\" \"And his codpiece. Very prominent, I must say.\" Elizabeth gasped, but more from amusement than shock. \"Mother, you're absolutely wicked!\" \"Try to tell me without even the littlest smile appearing on your face that you've never looked yourself.\" Elizabeth looked at her mother with a steely gaze, determined not to smile even in the slightest. \"I have never once looked at his -\" a smile broke out on her face and she started to laugh so hard that she couldn't finish her sentence. \"You win, mother. You win.\" \"I always do,\" Anne winked. \"Now go back and enjoy yourself. That's an order from the Queen.\" \"If it's an order, I shall obey,\" Elizabeth winked back and bowed before rushing back to find Robert in the crowded hall. *If anyone has a prompt that they'd be interested in, let me know!

I did, I will admit, use the beginning of the TV series \"Victoria and Albert\" for the scene in 1603. I have also, with Lady Eleanor Boleyn's agreement, made Robert into the eldest child of the Duke and Duchess of Northumberland, who were his actual parents in history. I also changed the date of the first appearance of cricket from 1598, to 1547. 12th February 1603: Richmond Palace, England \"The Queen! She's coming! The Queen!\" People in the nearby room bustled about, and one of them, a woman, who was cleaning one of the items, knocked a brush, which was on a platter. The woman left the room and the man remained as the Queen entered the room. She has a dog in her arms. She sat in the chair, and looked up to the man; he was an old man. \"You're new here,\" she stated, as she moved the brush back to its correct place \"My husband's rooms are to be left exactly as they were, when he was taken from us.\" \"Yes, Your Majesty,\" he replied. \"I am a little ahead of my usual time today; nevertheless it is always better to complete a task well ahead of time. That was always my husband's maxim,\" \"Yes, Your Majesty,\" he replied. He had never known the King, but he had heard good things about him. He bowed, and along with the other man, who was stood by the door, left the room, leaving the Queen to her thoughts. The Queen stroked the dog with one hand as she gently stroked the brush with her left hand. She adjusted the things on the platter, and moved the platter slightly, before she continued stroking the dog. She thought to her husband. Beloved Robin… fifty three years since our wedding day… how clearly, and with what astonishment do I remember how stubborn I was to you? 4th January 1550: Greenwich Palace, Kent, England. \"Your brother was seen, at least twice, to yawn, during a play at court,\" The sixteen year old Princess Elizabeth informed Ambrose Dudley, the younger, sixteen year old brother, of the seventeen year old, Robert Dudley, who was the heir to the Earldom of Warwick and Dukedom of Northumberland. Robert and Ambrose were the oldest two boys and Ambrose was the shorter and chubbier of the two, while Robert was the well-built, tall and slim boy. Ambrose preferred to stay indoors, while Robert preferred being outside with Elizabeth. Being outside, with Elizabeth, meant that he could flirt with her. He knew that in August, Ambrose and Lady Anne Whorwood would be getting married. \"You know that late hours have never been something that I like, Bess,\" Robert commented from the chair, where he reclined a little. He had never been one for the game of cricket, which had been introduced in 1547, and was what Elizabeth and Ambrose were playing. \"Honestly, Robert,\" Ambrose scolded \"If you're going to yawn, at least do it where no-one can see you. You know that the King doesn't mind, but others, like the Lady Mary, take offence to it. \" Elizabeth gave a noise of displeasure \"Edward and I do not get along with Mary anymore. She prefers to stay at Hunsdon, so we never see her anyway, which is a good thing as all three of us have inherited our father's temper.\" \"Tell me about it,\" Robert muttered. Elizabeth turned on him \"What did you say?\" \"Nothing, nothing,\" he laughed, and she smiled. She had already asked Edward for permission to marry Robert and was just waiting for his reply. Even if the council protested against it, it was Edward who had the last word. Elizabeth was confident that Edward would agree to her request. She had not noticed Sir Edward Seymour and Kat Ashley watching from the upstairs window. \"She plans to marry one of the Dudley boys?\" Edward asked, moving the curtain so that he could see the Princess Elizabeth, Ambrose and Robert. \"The elder, I think,\" Kat replied, putting her sewing down and joining him at the window \"She and Robert have been close since childhood, and Lord Robert is the heir to the Earldom of Warwick and Dukedom of Northumberland. It's a good match,\" \"Why not the younger?\" Edward Seymour asked \"He's only a year younger, and he is, if I'm honest, the nicer of the two boys,\" \"She'll take the elder. I know she will,\" Kat assured him \"They both love each other, but neither will admit it. They're both to stubborn.\" \"What makes you think that the King will agree to this?\" Edward Seymour asked. \"He was raised by Howards, My Lord Seymour,\" Kat replied, taking a seat and returning to her sewing \"The King favours them, and The Princess Elizabeth is a Howard, through her grandmother, My Lord, not to mention that, despite being half-siblings, they are also related through Elizabeth Cheney, who is the great-great grandmother of both of them,\" \"I still think that Catherine Howard had something to do with the death of King Henry,\" Edward informed her. Kat scoffed \"King Henry died from a surfeit of food on New Year's Day, 1541. The physicians confirmed that.\" \"Yes, I know,\" Edward replied \"But it was only the King and Queen that night, so I think that Queen Catherine either encouraged it, or at least, did nothing to stop it. She was the one sleeping with him that night,\" Kat nodded in agreement \"Indeed, she was. But King Henry decreed that Charles Brandon – followed by Catherine's brother, Charles – was to be regent if he died when King Edward was still in his minority,\" \"But why would the King allow his sister to be married before he is?\" Seymour asked, confused. \"The King is twelve, Master Seymour;\" Kat replied \"He's not going to reach marrying age for at least two years, while the Princess Elizabeth is sixteen. She is in the prime years for child bearing. It makes her a much better heir than the Lady Mary. Lady Mary is thirty three, and not likely to have children. If the Princess Elizabeth is married, and has children, then she becomes a more pleasing heir. The King can easily pass an Act of Succession to change the order and place Her Highness ahead of Lady Mary,\" Edward Seymour did not reply. He glanced out of the window and watched Princess Elizabeth. Outside, Princess Elizabeth looked up as Thomas Seymour strode across the grounds to her \"Your Highness, King Edward wishes to see you and Lord Robert,\" Elizabeth nodded. Now, her fate was decided. The decision would come soon enough. To Be Continued Review please.[Chapter 2] 4th January 1550: Greenwich Palace, Kent, England. \"Bess,\" King Edward VI, aged twelve, was sat in his throne, short, slim and blond, he looked just like his mother, but had his father's temper \"I know that you and Lord Robert are protestant and are not a threat to my throne – unlike some people,\" he cast a dark glare to Lady Mary – who was stood nearby – and then to his uncles \"so I am allowing you and Robert to be married.\" Elizabeth's face broke into the biggest smile that Edward had ever seen her give as she dropped into a curtsey. Edward Seymour did not look happy. He was certain that the King would have either said no, or made Elizabeth marry Robert's younger brother. This ruined everything. \"However, and children that you have, Bess, will take the surname of Tudor. This is what has been written in the new Act of Succession\" Seymour raised an eyebrow at Kat \"this way, if I die without children, you will be my successor and your children, with the Tudor name, can continue on our dynasty,\" As The Princess Elizabeth and Lord Robert left the room, Edward Seymour moved forward \"Your Majesty, are you sure that it is wise to reinstate Elizabeth as a Princess, and to allow her to marry Lord Robert? His grandfather was a traitor,\" \"Lord Robert is a trusted friend. He grew up with me and Bess. He has served me loyally from childhood, which is a lot more than you have done, Uncle. Now, leave my sight! I have made my decision and I stand by it!\" Edward Seymour bowed and took Lady Mary aside \"My Lady,\" he began \"What is your reaction to this marriage?\" \"I think that my sister has made a grave mistake, Lord Seymour,\" Mary replied \"Marrying into a family full of traitors just makes it easier for her to be overthrown by our catholic cousin, Mary of Scotland. If God sees fit to take our brother to him, and I am, for some reason, unable to take the throne for myself, then I would rather have our catholic cousin, Mary, on the throne, rather than the daughter of a whore and a traitor's grandson, even if our cousin, Mary, is only eight. Of course, our brother will not, hopefully, be dying anytime soon, because if a Dudley does get onto the throne, then this country will fall into ruin, and everything that mother and father did will be ruined,\" Edward Seymour could not think of anything that Katherine of Aragon had done, except fail to provide a male heir, despite that though, she was beloved by almost everyone during her lifetime, not least of all her daughter, so he wouldn't say anything like that to the Lady Mary, as she could be a valuable ally to make the King do what the Seymours wanted him to do, as Mary did owe a debt to Queen Jane Seymour for reuniting her with her father, King Henry VIII. Two weeks later: Whitehall Chapel, England \"Do you, Lord Robert, take this woman, Princess Elizabeth Tudor to be your lawfully wedded wife? Do you swear, on your solemn oath before all these witnesses, to love her, honour her and cherish her for better or for worse, in sickness and in health, and to forsake all other women for her for the rest of your natural lives until death does you two part\" Edmund Grindal, the vicar in charge of the ceremony, asked Robert \"I do,\" Robert replied, steely determination visible in his eyes \"And do you, Princess Elizabeth Tudor, take this man Lord Robert Dudley, to be your lawfully wedded lord and husband? Do you swear, on your solemn oath before all these witnesses, to love him and cherish him and to honour and obey him for better or for worse, in sickness and in health, and to forsake all other men for him for the rest of your natural lives until death does you two part\" Edmund Grindal repeated the question to Elizabeth \"I do,\" Elizabeth, like Robert, had a steeply determination visible in her eyes. After exchanging rings, Edmund Grindal spoke again \"What God has joined in Holy Matrimony, let no man tear asunder. I now pronounce you man and wife. Your Grace, you may kiss the bride,\" Edmund Grindal made the sign of the cross over their head. Robert needed no further urging. Leaning forward, and, lifting the veil out of Elizabeth's face, he pressed his lips to hers more passionately than ever before. Elizabeth, like her husband, replied with more passion than she had ever given before, melting into Robert's arms. Then, taking Elizabeth's hand and slipping through the crook of his arm, Robert led her down the chapel aisle and out into the Banqueting Hall at Whitehall for their wedding feast. He had done it. He had secured his beloved Elizabeth for his wife. They were married and Robert had no doubt that they would live happily ever after. Kat Ashley watched her mistress dance with Lord Robert. They were happy, in love, and Kat could easily see them being parents within the year. \"Your Highness,\" Kat dropped a curtsey as Elizabeth and Robert approached. \"Your Grace,\" Robert gave a small nod. He and Elizabeth had finished dancing and the King was gesturing for him to approach the throne. \"Look after my wife for me, Lady Ashley,\" \"Yes, Your Grace,\" Kat dropped another curtsey, and she and Elizabeth moved aside. \"So,\" Kat began \"Are you happy, Bess?\" \"I am, Kat,\" Elizabeth replied, sighing happily \"I really am,\" \"I hope that you will allow me to stay on in your new household, Your Highness?\" Kat asked. Elizabeth looked to her \"Of course, Kat. I wouldn't give you up for anything,\" To Be Continued Review Please.[Chapter 3] 5th March 1550: Cumnor Place, Oxfordshire, England, Home of the Princess Elizabeth Princess Elizabeth was bored. Being two months pregnant meant that there was not much that she could do. She could not go riding as it could harm the child. This meant that she was stuck in doors, all day, sewing. At least Kat was here with her. \"Have you seen Robert today, Kat?\" Elizabeth asked, glancing up from her sewing \"I couldn't find him anywhere,\" \"His Majesty, The King, arrived this morning – before you were awake, My Lady – and asked Lord Robert to go riding with him,\" Kat replied \"They had something to discuss about the new Act of Succession that the King is working on.\" Elizabeth gave a nod of acknowledgement and returned to her sewing. She, Robert and the King, knew that she was pregnant, and she had fallen pregnant a few days after her marriage to Robert. She smiled when she remembered that Lord Seymour and Mary had not been happy. 5th March 1550: Whitehall Palace, England Having returned from riding with his brother-in-law, The King glanced down to the paper in front of him. It was the new Act of Succession, which was due to be passed at the next meeting of the Privy Council. All he had to do now was actually put the succession in order. But that was where the problems began. If he put Elizabeth before Mary, then the Catholic forces would be attacking England within two years' time, but if he placed Mary first, then the Protestant forces would openly rebel. Looking down at the parchment in front of him, he picked up his feather, dipped it into the ink, and placed it over the parchment. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath, before scrawling two words underneath his own name; Princess Elizabeth. Underneath Elizabeth's name, he scrawled Mary's name. The Catholic forces could throw all the forces of hell at him, but he would not change his mind. If he died, without heirs, then Elizabeth was going to succeed him. No matter what… 7th March 1550: Hunsdon House, Hunsdon, Hertfordshire, England, Home of the Lady Mary \"The King has done what?\" Susan Clarencieux jumped, nearly losing the pile of linen she was carrying, as her mistress, Lady Mary, exploded with anger at Sir Thomas Seymour, and he too, jumped, for Mary rarely lost her temper, but, when she did, it was a formidable sight. \"The King, Lady Mary, has appointed the Princess Elizabeth-\" \"-Lady Elizabeth,\" Mary swiftly interrupted, but Thomas Seymour carried on as if Mary hadn't even spoken \"-as his heir, if he has no children, and has restored her to the title of Princess,\" Mary's eyes flashed from love for her brother to absolute hatred and the feather that was held between both of her hands snapped. She gave a small growl of annoyance, and turned. She strode off, towards her room. The door closed behind her with a loud smash, and the picture frame on the wall fell to the floor, shattering as it landed. She sat down at her desk, and began to write on the parchment. To my dear cousin, Charles. My brother, King Edward VI, has removed me from the succession and placed that Bastard daughter of that concubine, Anne Boleyn, in my place! This was obviously done through witchcraft. It seems that Anne Boleyn's bastard daughter has been meddling in the same forces that her mother meddled in. In being removed from my place in the succession, there is no possible way that England can be restored to the true faith and they will be worshipping a false god and a false church. Your cousin, Mary, Princess of England, Ireland, France, Spain, Aragon and Castile. She folded the parchment up and handed it to one of her maids \"Give this to the Spanish Ambassador,\" The maid dipped a curtsey, and left. Mary smiled. Now her brother would find out what the Catholic Forces could do. She would be restored to her rightful place in the succession... no matter what... To Be Continued Review please.[Chapter 4] The title, Viscount Lisle, is the subsidiary title that the heir to the Dukedom of Northumberland uses. That is why Robert is called it, so, Elizabeth's title is now, Elizabeth Dudley, Viscountess Lisle, Princess of England, Ireland and France. 17th June 1550: Hunsdon House, Hunsdon, Hertfordshire, England, Home of the Lady Mary \"So? I am a bastard again?\" Mary asked, as she re-read over the letter that was handed to her the day before \"Archbishop Cranmer has declared my father's second marriage valid at the time of Elizabeth's birth. This means that Elizabeth is Edward's automatic heir, behind his children, of course,\" She was talking to herself, and she knew that she was. She just couldn't believe it. The little boy that she had looked after in his younger years had now thrown it all back at her. She got to her feet \"Susan?\" Her maid appeared in an instant, dipping a curtsey as she did so \"My Lady?\" Mary reached into her pocket, and pulled out a letter. \"Take this to the Spanish Ambassador,\" \"Yes, My Lady,\" 17th June 1550: Cumnor Place, Oxfordshire, England, Home of the Princess Elizabeth Elizabeth, who was busy, sewing a small pair of socks, for her unborn child, suddenly stopped, her hand flying, quickly, to her stomach. \"My Lady?\" Blanche Parry asked, anxiously, readying herself to rise in case something was wrong with the baby. \"It's nothing,\" Elizabeth replied, as Kat reached her side \"The baby just kicked. That's all,\" the baby kicked again and Elizabeth smiled, gently placing her hand back onto his stomach. The baby, growing in her stomach, was the product of her and her husband, and it was a Lord or Lady for England and an heir, or heiress, to the throne, behind Elizabeth herself. \"Are you sure, My Lady?\" If anyone, other than Kat, had asked her that, she would probably have exploded at them. But, Kat had served Elizabeth faithfully for years, and would probably continue to do so. Instead, Elizabeth gave a smile and nodded \"I am fine, Kat. I am sure of that. It is not time yet… nor will it be until November,\" \"If you are like your mother, My Lady, you could have your child early,\" Mary Mackwilliam nee Hill commented. She went quiet when Kat glared up at her. Kat rose, and ushered the ladies from the room. \"Just call us if you need us, Your Highness,\" Elizabeth waved off her fussing ladies and returned to her sewing. When she thought about it, the kicking was a little soothing. Perhaps she could get used to being pregnant after all... 18th June 1550: Whitehall Palace, England \"The Princess Elizabeth and the Viscount Lisle seem to be happy in their marriage.\" Katherine Parr commented to her husband, Sir Thomas Seymour, who nodded in agreement. \"Yes,\" he replied \"They do.\" \"Marriage, Kate, is not about being happy,\" Edward Seymour interrupted, as he arrived \"It is about having sons, which, so far, you have failed to do. You have provided my brother with one child. A girl named Mary,\" Katherine did not reply, instead, she noticed Robert and Princess Elizabeth moving to the dance floor, where they readied themselves. The herald called \"The Viscount and Viscountess Lisle!\" and the dance began, with Elizabeth and Robert waltzing, gently, around the dance floor. Once the dance had ended, Elizabeth and Robert moved aside, to allow Barnaby Fitzpatrick and Amy Robsart to take the floor. \"Bess,\" The King approached her and Robert \"Are you enjoying being back at court?\" \"Yes,\" she replied, smiling as she dipped a curtsey \"I am, Your Majesty,\" The King smiled \"I hear from your husband that the child has quickened,\" Elizabeth smiled brightly \"Yes, it has. I think that it will be strong,\" \"This shows that you are supposed to be my true heir, Bess,\" The King smiled, placing a hand on her arm. He was far too short to reach her shoulder \"not Mary, who is an unmarried spinster,\" Elizabeth smiled back to her brother, and sovereign, but could not help feeling sorry for Mary. To Be Continued[Chapter 5] 12th November 1550: Cumnor Place, Oxfordshire, England, Home of the Princess Elizabeth Robert Dudley looked up as Lady Catherine Grey, aged ten, burst into his chambers. \"What is the meaning of this?\" he asked, looking up from the parchment on his desk. Catherine was breathing hard. \"Y-Your wife has gone into labour, Your Grace,\" The quill in Robert's hand shook for a moment, and he placed both hands onto the table and gripped it, hard. He took a deep breath \"Thank you, Lady Catherine. I assume that my wife's ladies have been informed?\" \"Yes, Your Grace. They are with her now,\" Robert nodded, and got to his feet \"Lead the way, Catherine,\" Lady Catherine Grey dipped a curtsey and left the room, with Robert following her. Henry Dudley, aged eleven, and Henry Herbert, aged twelve, watched her go. She was slim, had dark red hair and was well proportioned. She was, by far, the most beautiful of the Grey sisters. Her elder sister, Jane, was a bluebell, while her younger sister was a hunchbacked dwarf. A few moments later, Robert and Catherine reached Elizabeth's chambers. A loud scream echoed from the birthing room, and Robert unconsciously winced. Catherine Grey disappeared into the crowd of ladies, who were preparing everything for the birth of the Princess Elizabeth's child, and returned, a few moments later, with Lady Katherine Ashley nee Champernowne, commonly known as Kat. \"How is my wife?\" Robert asked. Kat made a gesture for Catherine to leave. Catherine dropped a curtsey and headed off into the crowd of ladies to find her elder sister, Jane. Kat moved forward, and began to speak, making sure that none of the Princess Elizabeth's catholic ladies could hear. \"Her Highness is doing well, Your Grace. The Midwife has assured me that everything is as it should be,\" Robert nodded, and began to pace. Up and down. Up and down. 13th November 1550: Cumnor Place, Oxfordshire, England, Home of the Princess Elizabeth A loud, primal scream echoed, as Elizabeth pushed one last time. Robert's head snapped up as the cry of a baby echoed throughout Elizabeth's chambers. Robert pushed open the door, and his wife's ladies turned to him. They dropped a curtsey, and he moved to the bed, where Elizabeth sat. A bundle of blankets were in her arms and a red haired and blue eyed baby was glancing up at Elizabeth. \"Robert!\" Elizabeth noticed her husband as he sat on the side of the bed and the midwife gently took the child from Elizabeth, so that the child could be cleaned up. \"Next time,\" Elizabeth began \"It will be a son,\" Robert looked down to her, and scoffed \"Oh, Elizabeth,\" \"We must have a son, Robert,\" she replied \"It is our duty. You know that,\" Robert got to his feet \"Oh, duty can be damned for all I care!\" he moved to the midwife who had cleaned up the child. She wrapped the child up in the bundle of blankets and gently handed the child to Robert. He took the child, and returned to the bed. \"She's beautiful,\" Elizabeth gently took the child from him, and moved a small part of the blanket aside. The child gripped her finger tightly. \"Oh, gracious,\" Elizabeth exclaimed, \"What a grip!\" \"Well,\" Robert began \"There's no doubt about the name then, is there? Elizabeth.\" he moved a small part of the blanket aside and the baby released Elizabeth's finger before grabbing his. A few moments later, the baby decided that Elizabeth's finger was more fun. Elizabeth smiled. \"Yes,\" she agreed \"Lady Elizabeth Tudor,\" Robert smiled \"Your sister is here,\" he informed his wife. \"I don't remember asking her to come.\" Elizabeth replied, looking up to Robert. \"I asked her,\" he replied. \"Did you, indeed?\" Elizabeth asked, raising her eyebrows. He placed a kiss to her forehead \"I thought it right,\" Well, I can't see her now,\" Elizabeth replied, leaning gently against Robert \"I'm worn out,\" \"She's been so anxious, Bess,\" Robert informed her, but Elizabeth was sticking to her principles, and her stubborn nature rose to the surface again \"No,\" \"For a moment?\" he asked \"She's just in the next room,\" \"Very well,\" Elizabeth replied, conceding defeat to her husband and the father of her daughter \"But only for a moment,\" Robert got up, crossed the room, and opened the door. He left the room for a moment, and returned a few moments later, with Lady Mary Tudor behind him. As Mary entered the room baby Elizabeth gave a few small cries, before becoming quiet again and staring up to her mother. Elizabeth looked up from her daughter to her sister \"Mary,\" \"Elizabeth,\" Mary dipped a curtsey to her sister and moved to the chair by the side of the bed \"They say that you have been in labour for almost the whole night. You must be exhausted.\" Elizabeth did not reply, and the two sisters could easily sense the tension in the room. Mary decided to break it first \"Can I hold her?\" \"Yes, of course,\" Elizabeth handed the baby over to Mary, who gently took the baby from her. Elizabeth saw her sister's face light up as baby Elizabeth cooed up to her. \"She's enchanting, Elizabeth. I swear that, never before, have I seen such a beautiful child,\" Mary adjusted the blanket a little and looked up \"She's far too pretty to put her dear mother under such a great deal of pain... and trouble,\" Mary looked back to her niece, who was gurgling in the blankets. \"I had hoped for a boy,\" Elizabeth replied. Mary looked up to her \"So had I,\" she replied \"Just to spite father. He went through five wives, and only one gave him a son. It would have been so good if one of us , the neglected daughters, had a son before Edward did. It was not a son this time, Bess, but, next time, it will be... I promise. After all, your mother,\" Mary faltered for a moment \"Anne Boleyn,\" Elizabeth could see that Mary still wasn't comfortable about those years \"had three sons. They were all stillborn, yes, but, with our father's lack of children, that cannot be blamed on her... You will have a son, Bess. I know that you will.\" Elizabeth could tell that her daughter, Lady Elizabeth Tudor, was going to bring her and Mary closer, and hopefully reunite them truly, once more, as sisters...[Chapter 6] Thank you to all of my reviewers. Now, I hope that you all enjoy this chapter. 4th January 1551: The Tower of London, London, England It had been two days since the death of King Edward - who had died from consumption after falling ill in December- and, tomorrow, Elizabeth would be crowned Queen. At this present moment, however, she was in the tower. All royal monarchs went to the tower the night before the coronation. She, her daughter, Elizabeth, now known as Bessie, and Robert, all shared a room. The Royal Suite. The door to Elizabeth's chambers swung open and Thomas Howard, Earl of Surrey entered. It was the dead off night and the guards had been dismissed for the night. Princess Bessie snuffled slightly in her sleep, and began to stand. Being not yet three months old, she could stand, but only when supported by the bars of her crib. Surrey knew that if Elizabeth was dead, then he could overthrow Mary and take the throne for himself. He pulled out his sword, and raised it. He readied himself to plung it into Elizabeth's chest. Right above Robert's hand, and just below her breasts. However, he had not noticed Princess Bessie, watching him, from the other side of the room. Princess Bessie was at an age where one spoke in a series of unintelligible shrieks; for example \"Ga!\" which probably meant \"Mama, look out for the man with the sword!\" Surrey glanced to the bed, as Elizabeth shuffled slightly in the bed. Perhaps the Queen shouldn't be first. She could suffer more by the death of her beloved daughter. He strode to the crib, and raised the sword. He thrust it forward. There was a loud clunk of wood and skull followed by Elizabeth's cry of \"I think not, My Lord!\" Elizabeth, who had heard her daughter cry, had thumped her second cousin, straight over the head with the hilt of Robert's sword. \"Elizabeth?\" Robert had stirred, and gotten to his feet. He noticed Surrey, and looked, anxiously, between his wife and daughter. As Surrey began to stir, Robert scooped his daughter into his arms, and held her close. Bessie clutched at the collar of his doublet, and Elizabeth readied herself with the sword. She had no intention of using it, but Surrey did not know that, after all, she was the daughter of Anne Boleyn and Henry VIII, King of England, Ireland and France. Elizabeth knew that words spoke far better that actions did, and, being very smart for her age, she knew how to use them. \"Lord Surrey,\" she began, to the man on the floor \"Get up!\" Lord Surrey scrambled to his feet. \"Guards!\" Robert called. Two of the guards, from another part of the Tower, came running. \"Take him to another cell,\" Elizabeth ordered. The guards picked him up, and dragged him away. Rocking his daughter slowly back to sleep, Robert gently lowered Bessie back into the crib, and he and Elizabeth returned to the bed. 5th January 1551: Whitehall Palace, England \"To the North, I present unto you, Elizabeth, your undoubted Queen!\" Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk called to the hall, as he held the crown up high. If he was angry at his son's actions, he certainly didn't show it here. He repeated the same call to the opposite end of the hall \"To the South, I present unto you, Elizabeth your undoubted Queen!\" Elizabeth, decked out in ceremonial robes, strode, slowly and elegantly down the aisle. Her ladies all filed along behind her, with Lady Katherine Ashley leading them. Elizabeth reached the chair, and her ladies dropped curtseys to her, before moving into the crowd. Elizabeth took her seat on the throne, and Owen Oglethorpe took the crown off of The Duke of Norfolk. Owen stepped in front of Elizabeth and held the crown up to the crown, before turning and placing it on her head \"I crown thee, Elizabeth, Queen of England, Ireland and France!\" he handed her a sceptre, and an orb. Like Elizabeth's crown, they were made of gold too. \"Long live, Your Majesty!\" Owen called. The same process was then repeated for Elizabeth's husband, Robert Dudley, King Consort of England, Ireland and France. Once the coronation had ended and the dancing and celebrations had begun, Lady Frances Grey, nee Brandon, Marchioness of Dorset and cousin to the Queen, glanced around the room. Her eldest daughter, and child, Lady Jane Grey, needed a husband, and it was going to be one of the Dudley boys. It wouldn't be the eldest, as he was married to Elizabeth, nor would it be the second, as he too, like the first, and third, was married. So, that left the fourth, Guilford Dudley. She knew who she had to convince, and, it was not the King. She had to convince the Duke of Northumberland. Moving forward, and passing through the crowd, she approached the man in question. He was tall, and broad shouldered, with a small beard. \"My Lord, Northumberland,\" she began, and, nearby, Lady Jane Grey sighed. If this betrothal went through, then she would be married, to a blonde haired, pompous, arrogant, gluttonous, self absorbed prig, not to mention the fact that he smelled. But, at least for now, she could watch the Lavolta being danced. The King, who had left his throne, was one of the dancers, as were his brothers, John, Henry and Ambrose, while Jane's sister, Katherine, danced alongside Henry Herbert, her betrothed. Her Majesty, Katherine Howard, Dowager Queen of England, Ireland and France, Viscountess Culpeper, danced with her husband, Sir Thomas Culpeper, 1st Viscount Culpeper, and Lady Mary Tudor, the Queen's elder sister, whirled around the dancefloor with one of her servants. Little Alexander Culpeper, aged three, and the son of Katherine and Thomas, sat near Jane, swinging his little legs in time with the music. The dance stopped for a moment, as Elizabeth got to her feet. She lifted the front of her skirt a little and walked down the steps. She reached Robert, and smiled, turning to the music players \"Play a Volta!\" The rest of the ladies curtseyed, and the gentlemen bowed, before retreating away and Elizabeth She took her place in front of Robert. The music began to play and the dance began with a galliard. Then the couple made a transition to a closed position. The leader, Robert, let go of his partner's hand and took hold of her below her busk with one hand, and placed the other hand on her back above the far hip. The follower, Elizabeth, placed her near hand on top of her partner's near shoulder. Now the leader was facing his partner while she faced to one side; both did the turn with forward steps, and both stepped with the same foot at the same time. The turn began with a small step, springing onto the outside foot and lifting the inside foot forward. On the second beat there was a longer step, stepping smoothly onto the inside foot and staying close to the ground. During this step the follower poised herself for a spring, and just after it she sprang up into the air. The leader lifted her with his hands, then held her up with his hands and with the thigh of his free leg under her thighs. He let her down to land on both feet on the last beat of the measure. The couple made an approximate 3/4 turn during each measure. The turn was repeated ad lib for several measures, and then the galliard was resumed in an open position. As everyone filed back onto the dancefloor, Frances curtseyed to the elder John Dudley, the Duke of Northumberland. She, and he, would be meeting, tonight, in his chambers at court, to discuss the betrothal of his fourth son, Guilford Dudley, to Frances's eldest child, Jane Grey. Elizabeth returned to her throne, and smiled. Catherine Knollys, nee Carey, carefully handed Princess Bessie back to Elizabeth, while Robert danced on the dancefloor. Elizabeth watched him closely, as did Bessie. \"The Queen is definitely her Father's child,\" Northumberland informed Norfolk, who nodded in agreement. \"Look closer, Your Grace,\" Norfolk replied, nodding towards the Queen \"Her eyes are her mother's.\" Northumberland noticed that Norfolk was right. The Queen's sparkling eyes were the same shade of deep amber brown eyes as her mother's had once been. William Cecil was pointing out people to the Queen, and Jane could see that she was taking in the names and faces, but overall, she was not paying attention. He eyes were still watching Robert dance. Jane then spotted Guilford Dudley approaching, dipped a curtsey to her mother, and disappeared into the crowd of people. \"Your Majesty?\" Elizabeth looked up. In front of her was her cousin, Lady Catherine Knollys, nee Carey, who was just rising from a curtsey \"May I introduce my second daughter, Laetitia Knollys?\" Laetitia Knollys had long, flowing copper red hair, which curled down her back. At the age of seven, she was tall, slim and well proportioned. Laetitia dropped into a curtsey, and Elizabeth held out her hand. Laetitia rose and kissed the Queen's hand. \"Your Majesty,\" she spoke, as she stopped kissing Elizabeth's hand. The Queen nodded her head in acknowledgement and Catherine dropped a curtsey, leading Laetitia away. Catherine was the only one who noticed the smile on the Queen's face. Elizabeth noticed Catherine's husband, Sir Francis Knollys, and the remaining seven children nearby. He kissed Catherine as she reached them and hugged Laetitia tightly. The eldest son, who was slightly heavy for his age and a two years older than Laetitia, ruffled Laetitia's hair, and she pouted. He laughed and Laetitia nearly bowled him over as she hugged him. Elizabeth could see that Laetitia would be a beautiful girl when she grew up, and possibly a threat, she would have to keep an eye on Laetitia. The boy would be quite attractive too, once he had lost the baby fat that is. Elizabeth noticed her elder sister, Mary, and, apart from her, the last remaining child of King Henry VIII. Mary was deep in conversation with the Spanish Ambassador. Elizabeth clicked her fingers, and one of her husband's attendants, the almost sixteen year old Barnaby Fitzpatrick, approached and bowed in front of her. \"Lord Fitzpatrick,\" Elizabeth began \"I want you to keep an eye on my sister, but, do not let her find out. She's up to something. I know she is. I remember, that in my childhood, Mary only spoke with the Spanish Ambassador when she was calling for the Emperor's help. Keep an eye on her,\" \"Yes, Your Majesty,\" he turned to leave. But Elizabeth's call of \"Barnaby,\" stopped him. He turned to look back to her, and Elizabeth continued to speak \"I know that you miss my brother very much. I do too. I have never forgotten your unfailing loyalty to him, and I never will,\" Barnaby swept into a bow, and left the Queen to do her bidding. Elizabeth knew, as well as Barnaby did, that he hadn't been faithful to Edward, but had been in love with him instead. Edward's death, being a hard blow to Elizabeth, and a relief to Mary had come as a horrible shock to Barnaby. Elizabeth hoped that Barnaby could get over Edward's death... she really did. 6th January 1551: Whitehall Palace, England \"My Lords,\" William Cecil sat at the head of the table \"as we have much weighty business today, I suggest that we put aside the appointment of officers and concentrate on-\" he had noticed the other door open. Elizabeth was stood in the doorway. \"Your Grace!\" Cecil, and the other men, all rose. \"My Lords,\" Elizabeth replied \"we are minded to join our council today,\" She moved to the head of the table, Norfolk pulled out the chair, she sat in it, and thanked him. Everyone else moved along one, so that the Queen was at the head of the table. They all sat down after the Queen did. \"Well, Master Secretary,\" Elizabeth began \"What news today?\" \"Three main matters, Your Majesty,\" William Cecil replied \"Amongst the lesser ones; first, the reform of the currency,\" \"Ah, yes,\" Elizabeth replied, nodding \"that must be seen too without delay,\" \"It won't be easy,\" Thomas Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Sussex informed her \"The coinage is greatly debased,\" \"No matter what it costs, the people must know that the coin of the realm is legal tender,\" she replied \"If they cannot trust the coin, then they cannot trust me,\" \"Very well, Your Highness,\" Sussex replied. Elizabeth gave a small smile \"Set out, on paper, the mesaures you propose, and I will sign them.\" She glanced to Cecil \"What next?\" Cecil coughed, once and began to speak. \"The matter that I mentioned to Your Majesty, yesterday. The appointment of Your Majesty's judges.\" \"You are quite right,\" Elizabeth replied \"Justice has been debased just as often as the coinage, and the people have suffered from it. Judges must learn to give justic freely, as they receive it from their Prince. They must have a care over my people, as they are, my people. Everyone oppresses them, and plunders them, without mercy, and they cannot revenge their wrongs, nor help themselves. The judges must take care of them. Take care of them. For they are my charge.\" Everyone around the table went quiet at Elizabeth's speech, and Elizabeth looked to them. \"What next?\" \"Thirdly,\" Cecil began \"the matter of The Princess Elizabeth's marriage,\" Elizabeth looked away from him for a moment. She knew that her councillors were already looking for eligible Princes to marry the Princess Elizabeth to. Personally, she thought that it was far to early, Bessie was, after all, not even three months old yet. After a few moments, Elizabeth spoke \"Leave that aside,\" Cecil nodded, and prepared to move on. \"Your Highness, the ques-\" Sussex tried to interrupt, but Cecil elbowed him on the arm, to silence him. It didn't work \"The question of the marriage must be discussed!\" \"But not in this place, nor at this time! Leave that aside! \" Elizabeth's voice had a hard edge to it. Sussex noticed the tone in her voice, and wisely became quiet. 7th January 1551: Hunsdon House, Hunsdon, Hertfordshire, England, Home of the Lady Mary \"I am to leave?\" Mary could hardly believe her eyes as she read over the parchment in her hand. She was being forced to leave the home that was given to her by her father, King Henry VIII shortly before his death, ten years ago. \"Yes, My Lady,\" Thomas Seymour informed her \"The Queen has commanded that you are to leave Hundson House,\" \"Where am I to go?\" Mary asked, sitting in the chair in front of the roaring fire. \"You, Lady Mary,\" Thomas Seymour replied \"are to go to Kimbolton Castle in Cambridgeshire,\" Mary's heart felt like it was being squeezed. She was being sent to the place that her mother had died in fifteen years ago. \"If that is what the Queen commands, then I will go.\" Thomas Seymour nodded. He may not have been in the Queen's favour, but, he could easily side with Mary against the Queen. \"It is what the Queen commands,\" Thomas Seymour had removed all emotion from his voice \"You are to be packed by tomorrow morning, when a carriage will arrive to take you to Kimbolton Castle,\" He bowed, and left. As the door closed, Mary nodded to her maid, Susan, who fiddled with the letter in her pocket and left the room. Mary began packing. She knew that she would have to obey Elizabeth, at least, that is, until her cousin Charles intervened, and forced Elizabeth to allow Mary back to Hundson House. She knew that her cousin would get her out of the situation that she was in now. \"My Lady?\" Susan appeared at the door \"Bishop Gardiner is here,\" To Be Continued. I hope that you liked this chapter. Please, review. Tell me what you think.[Chapter 7] Thank you to one of my reviewers, Alexis, for pointing out that forgot to credit a source. I shall credit it now. I used a quote from \"Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events\" in my last chapter. I used it to describe Princess Bessie. Attyfan, Mary was sent there deliberately, to put her in her place. Lady Eleanor Boleyn. I am sorry for not brainstorming the last scene with you, but, it was the only way for my story to work. Without further ado, the next chapter of The Dudley Rose of England. 11th February 1551: Kimbolton Castle, Cambridgeshire \"My Lady? Henry Carey, Baron Hundson is here,\" Mary Tudor rose, to greet the newly ennobled, Henry Carey, who waved off Mary's ladies, so that he could speak to her alone. \"Lady Mary,\" \"Princess,\" she corrected him. By their father's will, she was still a Princess, even if she was in seclusion, in the country, in the building that killed her mother. Henry Carey waved it off. He glanced around for a moment \"The Queen is willing to pardon you...\" Mary perked up for a moment \"On two conditions, one, you sever all contact with Spain, as you are English, not Spanish, and two, you allow the Queen to choose a husband for you,\" Mary got to her feet, and began to pace. \"What if I do not agree to this?\" \"Then, Lady Mary,\" Henry Carey began \"The Queen may be forced to have you confined here permanently, and, she may have to execute you,\" Mary gasped, placing a hand to her chest. \"Elizabeth is my sister. She wouldn't execute me,\" \"If her council tell her that it is for the best, Lady Mary,\" Henry replied \"Then she would, she is the Queen and has to do what is best for her family. However, if you sign this,\" he pulled out a scroll of parchment \"and renounce Spain, and allow your sister to choose a husband for you, then I will be able to convince the Queen that you are not a threat to her, and I may be able to convince her to release you from house arrest. You have ten minutes to make your decision,\" Mary paced, before picking up a quill, some ink, and signing her signature on the bottom of the parchment. Henry Carey smiled, bowed to Mary and left. 12th February 1551: Whitehall Palace, England \"Your Majesty? The Queen is just over a month pregnant.\" \"Thank you, Dr López,\" Robert placed a bag of coins into the hands of Rodrigo López and López left the room as the Queen emerged. Robert moved forward to her, slipped an arm around her, and kissed her, deeply, on the lips. He moved around her so that he was behind her, and slipped both of his hands onto her stomach. \"Our child,\" he began, rubbing his hands over her stomach in circular motions. She leaned gently against him and nodded, smiling. Her eyes betrayed her happiness. Robert sighed \"Great. Now, I'm going to have to find some other way to occupy myself until the birth of our son or daughter,\" \"It has to be a son, Robin,\" Elizabeth replied \"You know that.\" Robert sighed \"Oh, Bess, Bess, Bess. Even if we only have ten daughters, I will be happy, and the people have accepted you as Queen, they'll accept Bessie if we don't have a son,\" \"But what if I die when she is still young?\" Elizabeth asked, anxiously. Robert smiled \"Then I will look after her. She is my daughter, after all. I will keep her safe, and I will be regent until she comes of age. My family will not influence me, Bess. My father wanted me to marry Lady Amy Robsart, the only legitimate child, and heiress, of Sir John Robsart, but I refused.\" \"You refused an heiress, even though your father demanded it?\" \"Indeed I did, Bess,\" Robert replied, smiling \"Indeed I did, and I don't regret it for one moment,\" Elizabeth laughed, and Robert soon joined in. A thought crossed Robert's mind. \"Amy and I, despite not marrying, remain close friends. Master Fitzpatrick needs a wife, correct? Maybe we could marry Amy to him?\" \"Master Fitzpatrick,\" Elizabeth began \"Is betrothed to the Lady Joan Eustace,\" \"A betrothal can be broken off, Bess. Lady Amy is older than Lady Joan is.\" Robert replied \"Lady Joan is, after all, only twelve years old, while Lady Amy is Nineteen this year. He is not that much younger than her. He is sixteen years old, this year, Bess,\" \"Maybe you're right.\" Elizabeth admitted \"Maybe you're right.\" 13th February 1551: Whitehall Palace, England Catherine Carey, Lady Knollys, ran through the hallways around the tennis arena. She was trying to run past two of the King's jesters who were doing back flips all the way down the hall. Catherine pushed open the door that led onto the room where the tennis match was being played. She noticed that George Howard, older brother to Dowager Queen Katherine Howard, was playing against The King, and a smile came to her lips. Forgetting for a moment of what she was supposed to be doing, she ran to her seat next to Kat Ashley. She was out of breath by the time she sat down. \"Who's winning?\" she whispered and Kat replied \"The King\". Catherine should have known. Robert Dudley was the most athletic man at court, not to mention the fact that he was tall, well built, had a slight layer of stubble around his chin, and was King Consort of England, Ireland and France. At this moment, he was playing against George Howard, who just happened to be the cousin of Queen Elizabeth's mother, Anne Boleyn and thus a cousin of Elizabeth too. He was always trying to advance himself and his family but the Queen, and the King, knowing that the Howard Family could easily be traitors, usually had none of it, especially after the attempted assassination of Elizabeth, by the Earl of Surrey. Everyone clapped as Robert Dudley won points. Everyone was sure that he was definitely going to win. Robert looked towards Elizabeth and she smiled back at him. Suddenly, Robert hit the winning point and everyone clapped enthusiastically. \"Bravo!\" yelled out Elizabeth as she clapped. \"Bravo!\" The two men walked towards her and Elizabeth hid a laugh at the expression on her cousin's face. \"You are a most worthy loser cousin. I commend you,\" said Elizabeth to a sulking George. \"But a loser nonetheless,\" said Dudley, laughing a little as he picked up a white handkerchief off of his wife's lap. She smiled towards her husband. \"Your familiarity, with the Queen, is as offensive, as it is disrespectful, Sir\" said George, glancing to Elizabeth, who was on the verge of laughing because the two men in front of her, one of whom was her husband, were acting just like two little spoilt boys. Dudley cleaned his neck with the handkerchief and smiled as George spoke. \"Your need is greater than mine I fancy,\" said Dudley who held out the handkerchief towards George. \"It is damp but it still serves.\" George looked towards Dudley and smacked the handkerchief back onto Elizabeth's lap \"Next time it will be your swollen head that I aim for, Dudley.\" The councillors eyed George and the ladies gasped. This was not a wise thing to say in front of the Queen. \"Judging by your performance, your aim is nothing to boast of, Sir,\" said Dudley back. All the ladies hid their giggles. They managed to subdue their laughter as Elizabeth looked to the two men. George walked closer to Dudley and held his tennis racquet towards him. Elizabeth finally felt that enough was enough and that it had to be stopped. \"George,\" Elizabeth got her cousin's attention and gave him a cold stare \"I will not tolerate threats of violence in my presence. God's blood, it is but a game, now, shake hands and be done with it.\" Robert held his hand out but George only hit the hand. He felt that Robert was unworthy of his position as King and was unworthy of his status as the husband of the Queen. It should have been him, not Dudley, who had married Elizabeth! He was from noble stock while Robert Dudley was descended from a long line of traitors. Elizabeth stood up. \"If you think such behaviour finds favour with me, George, you are very much mistaken.\" She got up, and left the room. Her ladies, led by Kat – who was the Queen's principle lady in waiting – all dropped curtseys to the King, and then followed the Queen. Robert locked eyes with Lady Mary MackWilliam for a few moments. She dropped another curtsey and left. 14th February 1551: Whitehall Palace, England Princess Bessie gurgled as she caught sight on the woman looking over her. Her frame was delicate, approximately 5'3 inches tall, with finely formed, tapering fingers. She was smiling, had dark amber eyes, and long, dark brown hair. Despite never having seen this woman before, Princess Bessie did not feel frightened, as the woman had an air of kindness and seemed slightly familiar to her. The woman reached down to Princess Bessie, and picked her up, holding her close to her chest where Bessie snuggled down, and began to gurgle, quietly. A smile crossed the woman's face. The door, to the hallway outside, thumped shut, and the woman looked up, anxiously. She had hoped for more time with Bessie \"I love you, Bessie,\" she whispered, to the baby as she placed Princess Bessie into the crib \"I love you with all my heart and I bid you never forget it.\" With a swirl of her dress, she was gone, as if she had never truly been there at all, for there was certainly no sign of her. On a tree outside, which was adorned with red and white flowers, sat a falcon. It cawed for a few moments, and took off into the air. In Princess Bessie's crib, a small, thin strip of silk, with the initials A.B. melted away, as if it too, like its owner, had never been there. The door swung open, a few moments later. Elizabeth, with Robert right behind her, entered the room. Bessie noticed her mother and gave a shriek of delight as her mother lifted her high into the sky. \"Oh, my sweet, darling girl,\" Elizabeth held Bessie close to her, and sat in the chair nearby. Elizabeth began to bounce Bessie on her knee as Bessie gave shrieks of delight. Robert sat on the edge of the large four poster bed and gently took Bessie from his wife. Bessie pouted for a moment, but, when she realised that Robert was her father, she gave another shriek of delight and he began to bounce her on his knee. He kissed her forehead as he, momentarily, stopped bouncing her, and then continued bouncing her again. 15th February 1551: Whitehall Palace, England Elizabeth sighed as she glanced over the parchment in front of her. Only a few people could marry her sister. The first was The Earl of Arran. The second was the Earl of Surrey, and the third was Thomas Culpeper, the brother-in-law of Dowager Queen Katherine Howard. The Earl of Arran wouldn't do, as he was heir to the Scottish Throne, and thus, any children he and Mary had would be threats to England and Scotland. Not to mention the fact that he was already married. The Earl of Surrey wouldn't do, as he was trapped in the tower, and would, after the death of his grandfather, be the Duke of Norfolk, which would make Mary a Duchess, and a threat. So, it had to be the third. Thomas Culpeper, the older brother of Dowager Queen Katherine Howard's husband, Sir Thomas Culpeper, Viscount Culpeper. The elder brother had been ill when the younger had been born, and, since the elder had recovered, they both had the same name. If Thomas did marry Mary, then he would have to be ennobled and made, at least, an Earl. That would be the only way that he would be suitable as the husband of the Queen's sister. She picked up her pen and dipped it into the ink, before writing the name Thomas Culpeper below the suggestions of people followed by the word Earl . Then, she wrote her signature underneath and handed it to one of the nearby servants. 16th February 1551: Whitehall Palace, England \"Do you, Master Thomas, take this woman, Princess Mary Tudor to be your lawfully wedded wife? Do you swear, on your solemn oath before all these witnesses, to love her, honour her and cherish her for better or for worse, in sickness and in health, and to forsake all other women for her for the rest of your natural lives until death does you two part?\" Edmund Grindal, the vicar in charge of the ceremony, asked Thomas. \"I do,\" Thomas replied, a complete look of disgust in his eyes; he certainly had no intention of foresaking other women for a wrinkled old hag. \"And do you, Princess Mary Tudor, take this man Master Thomas Culpeper, to be your lawfully wedded lord and husband? Do you swear, on your solemn oath before all these witnesses, to love him and cherish him and to honour and obey him for better or for worse, in sickness and in health, and to forsake all other men for him for the rest of your natural lives until death does you two part\" Edmund Grindal repeated the question to Mary. \"I do,\" Mary, like Thomas, had no feelings of love for her future husband. After exchanging rings, Edmund Grindal spoke again \"What God has joined in Holy Matrimony, let no man tear asunder. I now pronounce you man and wife. Your Grace, you may kiss the bride,\" Edmund Grindal make the sign of the cross over their head. Thomas readied himself. Leaning forward, and, lifting the veil out of Mary's face, he pressed his lips to hers. Elizabeth, Robert and Bessie, in the Queen's pew, rose, clapping, along with the rest of the crowd. Then, taking Mary's hand and slipping through the crook of his arm, Thomas led her down the chapel aisle and out into the Banqueting Hall at Whitehall for their wedding feast. He had done it. He had done his duty for his family, Queen and country, and now, he could leave the woman alone. The celebrations, Mary noticed, went off without a hitch. She also noticed that all of the previous Catholic advisors had been replaced by Protestant advisors, or, if they had not been replaced, they had been forced to convert to Protestantism. That meant that heretics ruled the country... God help them... She took a sip of her wine, and gulped. The wine tasted different than it usually did. Something clogged in her throat, she dropped the goblet, which fell to the floor with a bang, and placed her hands around her neck. She did not have time to ponder on her circumstances, as she fell, to the floor, with a loud thump. The rest of the crowd gasped, and Elizabeth rose in her throne. But, it was too late. Whatever the physicians tried, to save Mary's life, would be in vain, for Mary was gone, two days before her thirty-fifth birthday... Nearby, Cecil locked eyes with Sussex, and gave a small, hardly noticeable nod. Their work here was done. Elizabeth was safe on the throne, and the only remaining person, who posed a major threat, was a Scottish eight year old, who lived in France and was betrothed to the Dauphin of France, and would, in 1558, be married, as Mary would be sixteen, and in the prime of child bearing years... until that time came, The Queen of England was safe... Unfortunately for Cecil, Francis Walsingham, Elizabeth's spy master, who was watching from nearby, had noticed the small exchange between the two men... To Be Continued[Chapter 8] This chapter might seem shorter than usual, but it is important as it puts things into play. In the next chapter, things will pick up, as there will be a time jump to the birth of Elizabeth's next child. What do you think it will be? Eleanor, don't give it away, please, for I know that you already know. I also wish to thank people for pointing out my mistake in the last chapter. I have been back and corrected it. 7th March 1551: Whitehall Palace, England Princess Bessie held out her arms for her father to lift her into his arms. He smiled, as she giggled happily and he lifted her onto his lap. Princess Bessie's ladies-in-waiting watched the King fuss over his little daughter. Ever since her birth, she and the King had spent a lot of time together. \"The King truly adores the Princess, doesn't he?\" Lady Mary Fitzroy, nee Howard, Dowager Duchess of Richmond and Somerset, and the half sister-in-law of the Queen, asked. Lady Dorothy Stafford nodded in agreement \"Indeed, he does.\" They watched the King play with the Princess for a few moments before Lady Douglas Sheffield, nee Howard, Baroness Sheffield approached and spoke \"I think that spending time with his daughter prevents him from taking a mistress, as he is always focused on his her,\" \"That is good,\" Mary agreed \"Because Mistress MackWilliam and her family wish for her to become the King's mistress, so that her family can rise higher. The King, however, is not falling for her, despite all of her attempts.\" Mary glanced around for a moment before moving forward slightly, so that she was speaking, quietly, to the other two ladies \"There is also the fact that Lady Katherine Ashley noticed Mistress MackWilliam's attempts to seduce the King, and told the Queen of them. The Queen was furious and the King was only able to calm her down by telling her that he had no affection for Mistress MackWilliam,\" \"I assume that neither she, nor her family were happy about this?\" Mary laughed for a moment \"Of course they weren't happy. Did you think that they would be?\" she trailed off as Mary MackWilliam walked past. 8th March 1551: Whitehall Palace, England Queen Elizabeth stood by the window of her large bedchamber, staring into space as her ladies bustled around her, dressing her in a sombre dark grey gown. As her former governess, Mistress Katherine Ashley, placed a matching hood encrusted with black pearls on Elizabeth's coppery head, there was a knock on the door and her husband, Robert Dudley, King Consort of England, Ireland and France, came in, dismissing her ladies with a wave of his hand. \"Are you all right, Bess?\" Elizabeth didn't turn around, though she sensed Robert come up behind her to stand at her shoulder. When she finally spoke, her voice was flat and expressionless \"Yes.\" \"No, Bess. You're not.\" Robert's voice was gentle, for he knew, no matter how much he might want to spin Elizabeth around and kiss the smile back on to her rosy lips, it was impossible. It wasn't what she needed. She needed time; time and understanding to come to terms with what had happened. For her part, Elizabeth merely shook her head slightly, still dazed by the events of recent months. \"I am. I ought to be. I need to be. The Protestants will expect it of me. They're not going to grieve for Mary. It's just – whatever happened between us; between her and Edward during his reign, Mary was my sister. She was practically a second mother to me at one point. I'll miss her.\" \"Of course you will. It's only natural.\" Robert reassured her, his hand on her shoulder. Elizabeth leaned back at his touch, resting her head against his chest. Robert revelled in their intimacy before breaking the spell with a quiet whisper. Robert gently led Elizabeth to the funeral pyre. She had broken all tradition by attending a funeral, but, she didn't care. Once they had got into place, the priest began to speak \"Dust to Dust, ashes to ashes... Merciful Lord God, we comment our beloved sister, the Princess Mary Tudor, into Thy tender care and we pray for the sanctity for her soul. May she rest in peace, now and forever.\" His low voice rang out over the hushed crowds as they gathered around the grave, huddled with grief and cold. Elizabeth stood with her husband Robert. The Emperor, Charles V, Mary's bereaved cousin, meanwhile, stood opposite them with the chief mourner, Mary's Spanish Cousin, Joan of Spain. Joan was gowned in dove grey velvet trimmed with yellow and purple – the colours of the Spanish royal mourning. Next to Joan of Spain, was John of Austria, the illegitimate half-brother of Prince Philip of Spain. He too, like Joan was wearing a dove grey velvet doublet which was trimmed with yellow and purple. His face looked sombre and tears glistened under his eyelashes. Joan placed a hand on his shoulder. The sky overhead was grey and threatening and, as the priest pronounced the final blessing and the mourners murmured a fervent \"Amen\"; filling forward to lay the posies of flowers they were carrying on the upturned earth beside the freshly dug grave and also on the casket itself before they left, drops of rain began to fall. It was, as someone remarked later, well out of the Queen's hearing, as though England itself was weeping for the woman who, in her life, had once been its precious Princess. 9th March 1551: Whitehall Palace, England \"Your Majesty?\" Robert looked up, from his desk. His brother John Dudley, was stood in the doorway. Robert smiled \"John,\" he began \"How can I help you?\" \"His Grace, the Spanish Ambassador, Count De Feria, is here,\" John replied. Robert nodded, and John left to allow the Ambassador to enter. The Ambassador moved past John and reached the desk. John dropped a bow to his brother, received a smile from his brother, the King, and left. Robert moved his work aside for a moment and looked to the Spanish Ambassador. \"Count De Feria, how can I help you?\" \"You can help me, Your Majesty, by telling me who murdered my Master's cousin!\" Count De Feria replied, to Robert's question. Robert sighed \"If only we knew, Count De Feria. If only we knew. So far, we have no answer. But, be rest assured. When we find out who killed Princess Mary, you will be the first too know. As you have pointed out, your Master, King Charles V of Spain, is - was -Princess Mary's cousin.\" Robert corrected himself, momentarily, at the end of his sentence. Count De Feria nodded and moved to the door. He knocked it, twice, with his fist, and it swung open. Count De Feria left and Robert sighed, placing his head into his hands and running them down his face. His life would be so much easier if he knew who was the person that poisoned Princess Mary. So far, there were no clues. No-one seemed to know who had poisoned the Princess Mary. 10th March 1551: Whitehall Palace, England Jane Grey sighed as she sat at on the window seat. \"Cousin?\" Jane looked up, stood up, and immediately dropped a curtsey. Queen Elizabeth was stood in front of her \"Is something wrong, Jane? You've been distracted for days,\" Elizabeth sat on the window seat as Jane began to speak \"It's my marriage,\" she began \"I am to be married to Guilford Dudley.\" Elizabeth nodded \"Yes. I know. Robert told me that his father and your mother were discussing it.\" she placed a hand onto Jane's shoulder \"Don't you want to marry him, Jane? He is a rather attractive lad,\" \"It is not the fact that he is attracitve - for I do not deny that.\" Jane replied \"It is the fact that he is a pompous, arrogant, gluttonous, self absorbed prig, not to mention the fact that he smells, and he is a drunkard.\" Jane seemed to be working herself into a state of utter horror. Elizabeth gently squeezed Jane's shoulder \"Men,\" she replied \"Will do anything for a woman. He may take mistresses, but know this, Cousin Jane, he will have to return to you, eventually, as he will need heirs from you. That is when you can get a man to do what you want. When you are in bed with him, he is yours and you are his. Remember that. If you whisper sweet nothings into his ear, and compliment him, then he will fall for you and do whatever you ask.\" Jane gave a small smile, but Elizabeth could see that something else was troubling Jane as well. \"There's something else troubling you, Jane, isn't there?\" \"It's the matter of consummating the marriage, Your Majesty.\" Jane admitted \"I have heard, from friends of my mother, that it hurts,\" Elizabeth frowned for a moment \"Your mother has friends?\" she asked, and both she and Jane laughed. Elizabeth soon got back to answering Jane's question. \"I will not lie to you, Cousin Jane. The first time that a man sleeps with you does hurt. But, once that is over, it should not hurt much, unless you sleep together when you are more than three months pregnant.\" \"Pregnant?\" Jane looked horrified at the thought of having to give birth to a miniature version of her future husband. Elizabeth smiled \"Being pregnant does not hurt, Cousin. Your husband, to make sure that you and the child are well, will be more faithful to you, and will change if you ask him too. It also means that your mother - who is a horrid woman - will not have any influence over you, for your husband will want you to carry the child to term, and will keep your mother away,\" \"That is good,\" Jane admitted \"For she does not realise that I have no amibition to take the throne. I just want to live a normal life,\" \"Yes,\" Elizabeth agreed \"Your mother, from what I can remember, has always been an ambitious woman. It is because she is the daughter of my aunt, Princess Mary Tudor, Dowager Queen of France and Duchess of Suffolk and she knows that, through her mother, she has a valid claim to the throne of England.\" \"Is that why you keep us at court?\" Jane asked \"To make sure that she doesn't try to take your throne?\" \"No,\" Elizabeth replied \"I keep you at court, as one of my ladies-in-waiting to keep you away from your abusive mother.\" Elizabeth smiled \"As for marriage, Cousin Jane. You have nothing to worry about. Guilford Dudley is tthe brother of my husband. He knows that if he does anything to hurt you, then he is hurting a woman of royal blood, and could be executed, not to mention the fact that he is the brother-in-law, of the Queen of England.\" \"I also hear that you plan to make my future husband a Baron?\" Jane asked. Elizabeth nodded \"I have already made him an Baron.\" she informed Jane \"He was ennobled at the end of last month, ready for your marriage in three days. He was ennobled as Baron Dudley.\" \"Then I will be a Baroness?\" Jane asked, anxiously \"My mother will not be pleased. She expected me to be a Duchess, or a Marquess,\" \"Well,\" Elizabeth replied \"Your mother is not Queen. I am. Your mother has no influence over me, Cousin Jane,\" To Be Continued[Chapter 9] A/N:- I hope that you all enjoy this chapter. There is also a six month time jump. 6th September 1551: Whitehall Palace, England Robert looked out of the window of his chambers and watched the courtiers and their wives and children, bustle around in the courtyard below. He could spot some of them instantly. Edward Seymour, Duke of Somerset, Earl of Hertford, and Viscount Beauchamp of Hache with his heavily pregnant wife, Anne Stanhope, Duchess of Somerset, Countess of Hertford and Viscountess Beauchamp of Hache. Holding Anne's hand was a rather chubby young lad, almost twelve years old. The young lad was their second, and eldest, surviving son, also named Edward, who was his father's heir. Walking further away from them, was the Duke of Somerset's brother, Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley and his wife, Katherine Parr, Baroness Seymour of Sudeley. Holding Katherine's hand was their daughter, Mary, who was three, and in Katherine's arms was their son, Thomas, who was three months old. Katherine Parr was one of the Queen's favourites, and Robert could see why. Katherine Parr, since her marriage to Thomas Seymour, had managed to curb her husbands ambition, and he had, since the death of King Edward, resided away from court and looked after his children. Edward Seymour, Robert knew, had been thrilled when his daughter, Anne, and Robert's brother, John, had been married. It meant that the Seymour's had a strong link to royalty, now that King Edward was dead. The link would become stronger after the marriage of, Jane, one of Robert's many sisters, to Seymour's third child, and second surviving son, Henry Seymour. They would be married next month, despite the bride only being ten, and the groom only being eleven. Robert knew as well as anyone that the Seymours could not be trusted. After all, they had pushed their sister, Jane, under the nose of King Henry VIII and used Jane to remove Anne Boleyn from power. Robert knew that the death of her mother was the reason that Elizabeth never spoke to the Seymours and never gave them any important positions at court. He too, did not trust the Seymours, but he knew that they could come in handy for doing the jobs that needed someone sleazy to do them. His thoughts drifted back to his daughter, Princess Bessie. Bessie had, three months ago, been made Marquess of Boleyn and Rochford , and soon, she would be an older sibling, for Elizabeth was due to give birth any day now. But, for now, he was content to watch people bustle about below. All of his work was done and his daughter was with her Governess, but he had already visited her today. As he glanced out of the window, he noticed Guilford sat next to Jane on the bench. Jane seemed to be crying. Guilford put an arm around her and began to gently whisper in her ear. Robert couldn't think why she would be crying. He got his answer soon enough. Guilford's eyes went wide, and his jaw fell for a moment. He regained his composure, lifted Jane from the bench, swung her round, and kissed her, deeply on the lips, before leading her into thee hedge maze and away from prying eyes. Robert soon realised what the scene in front of him meant and he smiled. His smile soon vanished as he caught sight of The Spanish Ambassador, Count De Feria, deep in conversation with Bishop Gardiner. He would have to convince his wife that Bishop Gardiner was bad news. He knew that Gardiner had met with Mary a few times before her death, and that made him dangerous. Very dangerous. 7th September 1551: Whitehall Palace, England Robert paced outside of his wife's birthing chambers. Guilford smiled, placing a hand onto Robert's arm \"Everything will be fine Robert. Stop panicking.\" \"You'll be the same when Jane goes into labour.\" Robert replied. Guilford gulped for a moment and took a deep breath. Robert could see that his brother was horrified at the thought, and he laughed for a moment \"If you didn't want to think of that, Guilford, then why did you sleep with Jane?\" \"Lust and affection took over,\" he replied, ashamedly \"I couldn't control myself. To be honest, I'm still struggling to not take a mistress at the moment - not to mention the fact that father keeps telling me that I can because I am the brother of a King. How do you control yourself?\" \"Simple,\" Robert replied, as another scream echoed from Elizabeth's birthing chamber \"I know that, if I remain faithful to my wife, when she is pregnant, then she will love me more.\" Guilford seemed to be taking in this information. He looked up to Robert, who, being six years older than him, was much taller than he was. \"I understand,\" Guilford replied. He looked up to Robert again \"Do you think that I should change for Jane?\" \"I cannot decide that, Guilford,\" Robert replied, placing a hand on his thirteen year old brother's slim shoulders \"You will need to ask that question to Jane, brother,\" Guilford nodded, and Robert sat in the chair opposite the door to Elizabeth's birthing chambers. A few screams echoed, and the sound of a crying baby echoed from the room. The door, to the birthing chambers opened, and the midwife was stood in the doorway. She moved forward, and handed the bundle of blankets to Robert. He gently took the bundle of blankets and looked down into it. A round faced, plump baby boy was looking up at him with a pair of bright blue eyes. The boy had red hair, which covered his hair. His face was round, and he gave a giggle. \"Congratulations,\" Guilford informed his brother. Robert smiled, passing the midwife and entering the room. Elizabeth had now been cleaned up, and he handed their son back to her. She smiled down into the bundle of blankets, adjusted them and smiled. \"We'll name him Edward. After my brother.\" Robert smiled, and nodded his agreement \"Edward Tudor, Prince of Wales, and future King of England.\" 8th September 1551: Whitehall Palace, England \"By the god of Grace,\" the Herald, leading everyone from the ceremony began \"I give you Edward Tudor, Prince Of Wales, Earl Of Chester, Duke Of Cornwall,\" Edward, in a bundle of blankets in his mother's arms, was carried from the chapel. He was sleeping soundly \"Make way for Their Majesties!\" the crowd parted, to allow the royal family to walk through the newly created space. Bessie toddled after her parents, hand in hand with her governess, Lady Mary Sidney, nee Dudley. She smiled, as they reached the door, and the herald cried \"Her Highness, Princess Elizabeth Tudor, Marquess of Boleyn and Rochford,\" The thick, wooden, brown, oak, double doors, opened, with a small creak, and Robert smiled, as the crowd parted for Bessie to pass. When she reached the throne, she turned and curtseyed, falling to her knees in a sign of acknowledgement. Her father lifted her into his arms, and she smiled, up at him. \"Bessie,\" Robert began, smiling \"This is your little brother, Edward.\" Bessie leaned forward and smiled as she saw the sleeping baby in the blankets below. \"Edward,\" she spoke. She leaned down and placed a kiss onto Edward's forehead and smiled, brightly. Edward's eyes opened, and his mouth began to quiver. He caught sight of Bessie and reached out with his two chubby arms. Bessie gently took her hand in his and he gripped it hard, directing her hand to his mouth. Robert gently took Bessie's hand and moved it away \"No, Edward,\" Edward began to blubber as tears began to build up in his eyes. Elizabeth lifted him into the air, and kissed him on the forehead. The tears soon disappeared, and he began giggling as Elizabeth bounced him up and down on her knee. To Be Continued I hope that you liked this chapter. It may be a little short, and I apologise, but, I know how things are going to play out. I hope that you are not disappointed by the gender of Elizabeth's child. This chapter may also be a bit short, but it is crucial to the plot that is too come.[Chapter 10] A/N:- I hope that you all enjoy this chapter. I know that I have enjoyed writing it. I will admit that the first two scenes are from \"Elizabeth\" which was released in 1998. The rest, however, is of my own making. I used the two scenes from Elizabeth, as it will begin to put things into play and can move my plot along. I do not own The Tudors, history, or anyone you recognise. Only the Princes and Princesses, and their cousins, etc, are mine. Nothing more. Some of these sections are short, but that is what makes them work best, I feel. 18th October 1551: London, The Thames, outside Whitehall Palace, England While Kat Ashley, Blanche Parry and Lady Catherine Grey played cards at the end of the boat, Robert reclined by his wife's side. Both He and Elizabeth had golden masks on long thin golden stick handles. They were reclined on a large pile of pillows. Robert sat up, and moved forward a bit, holding the mask to his chin. Elizabeth watched him, and he began to speak \"My true love...\" He began, returning to his wife's side \"...has my heart, and I have hers. My heart, in me, keeps her and me in one.\" He reclined onto his back, and raised a hand into the air \"My heart in her. Her thoughts and senses, guided.\" He placed the hand elegantly to his chest \"She loves my heart...\" Elizabeth gave a small laugh and Robert extended a finger \"...for once, it was her own,\" He placed the finger onto Elizabeth's skin, right where her heart was. He rested his head just above her breasts \"I cherish hers.\" He looked up to her, and she looked up to down to him \"Because in me, it bides.\" Elizabeth raised the mask again. Robert spoke, on last sentence \"My true love has my heart,\" He placed his hand to the side of the golden mask \"and I have hers.\" Elizabeth removed the mask again, and a firework, from the edge of the Thames, shot into the air. Francis Walsingham was stood on the bank. \"Are you going to betroth Bessie to the Duke of Orléans?\" Both Elizabeth and Robert gave a small laugh and Elizabeth sighed \"On a nght such as this, could a woman say no to her daughter's betrothal?\" Robert smiled \"On a night such as this, could a Queen say no?\" \"Does not a Queen sit under the same stars as any other woman?\" Elizabeth asked, and Robert gave a small laugh. Robert got up and moved to the edge of the boat \"Monsignor Alvaro! Monsignor Alvaro! Monsignor Alvaro, tell me. As well as Ambassador, are you not also a bishop?\" The Spanish Ambassador, Monsignor Alvaro, who could easily perform the marriage, looked over to Robert. Elizabeth moved forward, to pull her husband back as he smiled down to her. Monsignor Alvaro was on another boat, sailing nearby \"I am, Your Majesty,\" Monsignor Alvaro replied. Robert smiled \"Then you can marry Bessie and the Duke of Orléans, now.\" Monsignor Alvaro looked confused for a moment \"Now, Your Majesty?\" Elizabeth laughed, moving back the see through curtain, so that she could see Monsignor Alvaro. \"Perhaps he does not know enough English to perform the ceremony?\" \"Alas, Madame,\" Alvaro replied, from his boat \"In this matter, I can be of no help to you.\" Elizabeth laughed, reclining back into the pillows. The scene of happiness would not last much longer. \"Madame!\" Catherine Grey cried. There was the sound of an arrow being fired, and the sound of someone gasping in pain, as the lifeless body of a man fell through the see through curtain. Catherine screamed. Elizabeth gave a yelp, and Robert's head snapped in her direction. Kat, Blanche and Catherine were on their feet in an instant. Cries from different people could be heard from the bank and other boats. Robert moved the man off of Elizabeth. It was one of the castle guards, who had been shot, straight through the heart. Robert grabbed the curtain and began pulling it away. \"The Queen! The Queen!\" Robert cried \"Look after the Queen!\" The sound of another arrow being fired, echoed from somewhere, and an arrow pinned itself into the side of the curtain. Catherine Grey screamed and Elizabeth gasped. Elizabeth's ladies lead her through the castle. \"Catherine,\" Jane Grey began, to her sister \"See to the Queen's chambers,\" they passed a large support beam, which held the roof up \"Catherine! GO!\" Catherine lifted up the front of her skirt, and sprinted ahead to the Queen's cambers \"Get the bedchamber ready, Ladies. Quickly!\" Kat called, as they reached a nearby archway. Catherine appeared in the archway \"Come!\" \"I am perfectly... well. Please do not... do not fuss.\" Elizabeth ordered. Robert followed her in, taking his wife by the hand. \"Madame,\" Cecil began, as the ladies removed Elizabeth's dress \"If only you would heed my advice.\" \"I narrowly escaped with my life, Sir,\" she replied, gripping the table as her ladies began to wash the blood from her stained dress \"I cannot now discuss Bessie's marriage.\" \"Forgive me,\" Cecil replied \"But one cannot be separated from the other. Have I not told you-?\" \"Yes!\" Elizabeth sighed, sitting in the nearby chair \"And, I am sick of it!\" she got up, and the ladies stripped her dress off, and wrapped her in a robe, with Robert's held \"This entire conversation is ill timed.\" Elizabeth, who had been stood behind a screen, so that Cecil could not see her without clothes on, emerged \"My patience, Sir William, is not infinite.\" She emerged, and stopped for a moment. Robert seemed as confused as she did to see the French Ambassador stood in the doorway. The French Ambassador bowed. \"Tis a great joy to see that Your Majesty is not hurt,\" The French Ambassador assured her, after he rose from the bow. \"It was a terrible affair.\" Cecil looked back to the Queen \"The King of France would still know the answer to his suit.\" \"You may tell the King of France that he will have his answer shortly.\" Elizabeth replied \"I need to discuss it with my husband first, as he is The Princess's father.\" \"Oh, Madame,\" Cecil moaned \"The point is pressing!\" \"The King of France cannot want my daughter, for his son, so much if he demands my answer so precipitously!\" Elizabeth replied, casting a You're trying my patience glare to Cecil. \"Perhaps,\" The French Ambassador began \"Her Majesty will not answer because her heart is already set upon another.\" Elizabeth's face, which had been solemn, titled slightly as she walked to the Ambassador \"Do not presume, Monsieur, to know the secrets of my heart.\" She glanced to Robert, who gave a small nod. Elizabeth's temper, which had been ready to explode at Cecil, calmed itself and she spoke, to the French Ambassador \"Monsieur De Foix. Tell you King that I agree, to the eventual marriage of Princess Elizabeth, when she is twelve years old. On one condition. I wish, for the Duke of Orléans, when he is ten years old, to spend two years in England, so that there is no trouble between husband and wife after the marriage.\" Monsieur De Foix had his answer. The Betrothal would now be finalised, and he would return to the English court with a document for the Queen to sign. Monsieur De Foix nodded, and left, and Elizabeth called \"Cecil!\" He remained, and she moved to him \"If you ever pressure me, or talk to me, like that again, you will find yourself under house arrest, now, leave my sight!\" 19th October 1551: Spilsby, Lincolnshire, England \"The Queen was attacked?\" Catherine Willougbhy, Dowager Duchess of Suffolk, Suo Jure 12th Baroness Willoughby De Eresby gasped. Her son, Henry Brandon, 2nd Duke of Suffolk, aged sixteen, nodded \"Indeed,\" He replied \"The Queen was attacked, on her boat, in the middle of the Thames. Someone tried to kill her with an arrow.\" \"Is the Queen alright? Has she recovered?\" \"Yes,\" Henry replied \"The Queen is well. Her husband, King Robert, is looking after her.\" He glanced around for a moment, looking for his brother \"Is Charles still in bed?\" he asked, shocked. He knew that his brother could sleep for hours and would likely spend his whole life in bed if he could. \"Yes,\" Catherine replied \"He's developed a fever and the physician has said that he is to stay in bed.\" Henry smiled, sniffing slightly \"Can I see him?\" \"He's upstairs.\" Catherine gestured to the stairs. Henry moved up the stairs, and pushed the door open. Charles was curled up on the bed. The bed quilt had fallen to the floor, and he was shivering a little. Henry moved forward, lifted the quilt off of the floor and placed it over his brother. He leaned down, kissed him once, on the forehead, and left the room, gently closing the door behind him. \"Do they know who attacked the Queen?\" Catherine asked as Henry came down the stairs. He shook his head \"No. But the King and Queen have their suspicions. They think that is was the Earl of Surrey, or at least, that the attackers had his permission. The second one is the more likely one, since the Earl is still in the tower.\" \"Why would he try and kill the Queen?\" Catherine asked \"If the Queen dies, then Prince Edward becomes King.\" \"Yes,\" Henry replied \"But the Queen knows that not many people would accept Robert, or any Dudley for that matter, as regent, and thus, the Queen's nearest family member, who would be suited to be regent, is the Earl of Surrey.\" \"Surely Henry Carey, or Catherine Knollys, could be regent?\" Catherine suggested. Henry shook his head \"They have Boleyn blood. After the Dudleys, the Boleyns are the most hated people ever. That is why Surrey is the next-in-line to be regent, after his grandfather of course, but his grandfather is getting old. The Howards are disliked, but they're liked more than the Dudleys and the Boleyns.\" \"Hopefully,\" Catherine began \"The King can change the opinion of the Dudley family.\" Henry chuckled \"He doesn't need to. When the Duke of Northumberland dies, the Dudley name will improve. I promise you that, mother.\" 20th October 1551: Whitehall Palace, England \"How is my granddaughter, Princess Elizabeth?\" Jane Dudley, nee Guilford, Duchess of Northumberland asked. Robert smiled, sitting opposite his mother \"She is well, mother. She's growing up to be a right Tudor Princess, and a Dudley Princess too, for that matter. She's just as smart as her mother, just as stubborn as we Dudleys are, and only eleven months old.\" \"Good,\" Jane replied, taking a sip of ale from her cup and gave a smile \"And Edward?\" She asked, putting her empty cup down and clasping her hands together as she placed them on her knees. \"He's a normal baby, and does all the normal baby things.\" Robert informed his mother \"He is different to Bessie though. Bessie hardly cried when she was a baby, while Edward frequently cries.\" Jane smiled \"That is nothing to worry about, Robert. It just means that he will be more affectionate when he grows up.\" \"Your Majesty!\" One of the grooms burst into the room \"Prince Edward is missing. So is the Duke of Northumberland.\" Robert was on his feet in an instant \"Find him!\" He ordered. The groom nodded, and left. Robert looked to his mother \"There will be no mercy. He will be executed!\" 21st October 1551: Whitehall Palace, England John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland looked up, as the face of one of the Tower's guards appeared between the bars. \"A visitor for you, Your Grace,\" The door swung open, and he looked up. Robert was stood in the doorway. He gestured, and the door closed \"I didn't want to come here.\" Robert admitted \"But I have never been able to say no to Guilford when he cries.\" Robert sighed, taking the chair near the door and placing it in front of his father, before sitting on it \"You should see him, Father. He can barely speak.\" Northumberland scoffed \"It's because he is a sentimental child. He never learnt that the world is a dangerous place.\" Robert looked shocked at his father's attitude and took a deep breath before speaking \"Do you repent for your actions, Father?\" Northumberland laughed \"No. I wanted more power at court, and, by kidnapping your son, I got it. Even if it was only for a moment.\" \"Very well,\" Robert replied. He got to his feet, put the chair back, and knocked once, on the door. It swung open, and Robert left. Northumberland had resigned himself to his fate, and would be executed the following morning. 22nd October 1551: Tower Hill, London, England \"Good people, all you that be here present to see me die. Though my death be odious and horrible to the flesh, yet I pray you judge the best in God's works, for he does all for the best. And as for me, I am a wretched sinner, & have deserved to die, and most justly am condemned to die by a law. And yet this act wherefore I die, was not altogther of me - as it is thought - but I was procured and induced thereunto by other . I was I say induced thereunto by other, howbeit, God forbid that I should name any man unto you, I will name no man unto you, & therfore I beseech you look not for it. I, for my part forgive all men, and pray God also to forgive them. And if I have offended any of you here, I pray you and all the World to forgive me: and most chiefly I desire forgivenes of the Queen's Highness, whom I have most greviously offended.\" Northumberland's voice was clear, and crisp as he spoke. \"And I pray you all to witness with me, that I depart in perfect love and charity with all the world, & that you will assist me with your prayers at the hour of death. And one thing more good people I have to say unto you, which I am chiefly moved to do for discharge of my conscience, & that is to warn you and exhort you to beware of these seditious preachers, and teachers of new doctrine, which pretend to preach God's word, but in very deed they preach their own phansies, who were never able to explicate themselves, they know not today what they would have tomorrow, there is no stay in their teaching & doctrine, they open the book, but they cannot shut it again. Take heed how you enter into strange opinions or new doctrine, which have done no small hurt in this realm, and have justly procured the ire and wrath of god upon us, as well may appear who so just to call to remembrance the manyfold plages that this realm have been touched with all since we disserved our selves from the Protestant Church of Christ, and from the doctrine which have been received by the holy apostles, martyrs, and all sanctus, and used through all realms christened since Christ. And I verely believe, that all the plagues that have chaunced to this realm of late years since afore the death of King Henry the eighth, has justly fallen upon us, for that we have denuded ourself from the rest of Christendom whereof we be but as a spark in comparison: Have we not had war, famine, pestilence, the death of our King, rebellion, sedition among ourselves, conspiracies? Have we not had some erronious opinions spronge up among us in this realm, since we have forsaken the unity of the Protestant Church in wishing the death of the Prince Edward? and what other plagues be there that we have not felt? And if this be not able to move you, then look upon Germany, which since it is fallen into this schism and division from the unity of the Protestant Church, is by continual dissention and discord, brought almost to utter ruin and decy. Therfore, lest an utter ruin come among you, by provoking to much the just vengence of God, take up betimes these contentions, & be not ashamed to return home again, and join yourselves to the rest of Christen realms, and so shall you bring yourselves again to be members of Christ's body, for he cannot be head of a deformed or monstruous body.\" he looked up to the executioner and spoke \"I forgive you with all my heart, and do I part without fear.\" And then, bowing toward the block he said, \"I have deserved a thousand deaths,\" and therupon he made a cross upon the straw, and kissed it, and attempted to lay his head upon the block. He could not find it, and began to panic, as he fumbled around for it. The executioner grabbed his head, and laid it upon the block. The executioner raised the axe, and swung it down. There was a whistle of wind, and Northumberland died with one stroke of the axe. \"FATHER!\" Guilford Dudley awoke with a start . Sweat was plastered to his forehead, and his chest rose and fell as he took a few deep breaths. He ran his hand through his blonde hair, and took a few more shuddering breaths. He glanced over to Jane. She was sleeping gently by his side. He chuckled to himself and smiled. Jane always had been a heavy sleeper. He gently stroked the side of her cheek, shifted himself into a new position, and pressed himself, gently, against her. Placing a kiss onto her cheek, he slung his arm over his wife's shoulder, to keep her safe, and gently closed his eyes. He would change for her, no matter what, and, while she was here, he knew that his nightmares were just that... Merely nightmares... nothing more... He finally drifted off into a deep sleep dreaming of his family, alive, happy and well. I hope that you enjoyed this chapter. Review Please.

Mary nodded \"Good. Now, fetch the rest of the Princess's ladies. They will need to be here when she arrives.\" Frances Johnson rushed off to fetch the ladies who would be serving the Princess Elizabeth. Along with herself, and Lady Fitzroy, there was Frances Vaughn, Gabriella Shelton, Anne Knyvett, nee Shelton and Amy Shelton. The Comptroller of the Household was to be Henry Parker, a strapping young man, aged twenty, and the heir to the baronetcy of Morley. The royal carriage, containing the Princess, pulled up. Here you are, my Lady Princess. Hatfield House. Your new home.\" Ambrose Dudley swung down off the box of the carriage and opened the door to let the little girl he was driving out, bowing low as she passed him and taking her hand to help her down the steps of the carriage. Lady Mary Fitzroy approached \"Thank You, Ambrose. Will you be returning to Court immediately?\" Ambrose shook his head. \"I am to stay, until tomorrow, to see the Princess settled and then I must go back. After all, King Robert and Queen Elizabeth will want to hear how Bessie takes to her new home.\" \"Yes. Of course they will.\" Mary nodded. All of a sudden, she felt a young hand touch her sleeve. Looking down, she realised that the Princess wanted her attention. \"Yes, Your Highness? Shall we go inside and find your new rooms?\" Bessie shook her head. \"Can we just see the gardens first, Mary? You, me and Lady Amy?\" Mary was about to refuse, when something in the Princess's manner, as she stood there in her travelling gown of dark brown velvet and her long cloak of white rabbits fur, stopped her. Glancing over her shoulder at Lady Amy Shelton, one of Bessie's favourite Ladies in waiting, she signed to her to join them and then looked up at her brother. \"Can you see to it that the Princess's trunks are taken up to her rooms?\" \"I will.\" Ambrose assured her, and so the three of them set off into the gardens, Bessie a pace or two ahead of her companions as protocol required. For once, she was quiet, as she had been for most of the journey, and Mary began to wonder whether she was all right. She'd barely touched her breakfast before she left that morning, even though the cooks had made her favourite scrambled eggs with smoked salmon, which was very unlike her. She knew this, because Ambrose had written ahead. Whispering to Lady Amy \"I'm not sure she's all right.\" she hurried to catch up the Princess, who, now that they weren't in the courtyard, with the eyes of her full household upon them, suddenly stopped and put her hand on Mary's skirts. \"Mary? Do my Mama and Papa love me?\" \"What? Of course they do, Princess!\" Mary exclaimed. \"You know they do. Didn't the Queen just invest you with the title of Marquess of Boleyn and Rochford, formally in front of the Court?\" \"Yes, but then she sent me away. Why did she do that if she loved me?\" Bessie asked, as Lady Amy came within earshot. Amy knelt down in front of the Princess, and gently reached out to touch the little girl's shoulder. \"She didn't do it because she doesn't love you, My Lady Princess. She did it because she loves you.\" \"But I don't understand. She sent me away. Was it because I'm a girl, and won't be Queen after her?\" Bessie persisted. Amy nodded \"Yes. I know it sounds strange, but the thing is, it's not because you're a girl. It's -\" Amy took a deep breath before continuing, choosing her next words with care. \"Princess, the fact that your mother is still giving you a household of your own proves that she views you as the next Queen of France, my Lady - due to your future marriage to the Duke of Orléans. It's an honour, trust me.\" \"But…what if I'm lonely?\" Bessie looked up at both Mary and Amy as she spoke, but it was Mary who answered. \"Don't worry, you won't be. Your father will see to that. He's going to arrange for children of people he trusts to come and live with you soon. Like his little sister, your aunt, Temperance. If you ever have any sisters or female cousins, they'll come and live with you too. You see? You won't be lonely. Now come on, let's go and find your rooms. It's getting late and we've had a long day.\" \"All right.\" Bessie smiled slightly, and slipped her hand into Lady Amy's as the latter straightened up. Mary smiled down at her little charge and fell into step beside them as they left the gardens. \"Is she asleep?\" Ambrose Dudley looked up from the book he was reading as his sister-in-law opened the door and came into the sitting room, sinking into a chair before the fire with a sigh. Mary nodded \"Yes. At last.\" \"Leaving her mother and father is hard for her, isn't it?\" \"Yes. Well, I mean, it's only to be expected. She is their only Princess, and she hasn't been away from them before. Ever.\" \"That's true. But Princesses have to grow up fast, Mary. You can't baby her just because she's been taken away from her mother and father.\" \"I know, I know. I won't. But I will let her be a child before she's forced into a marriage as an English dynastic pawn. I don't care if she's a Princess of England and future Duchess of Orléans. She's still just a little girl, and I want to let her be that little girl no matter what.\" Ambrose chuckled. His sister-in-law was so fierce as she spoke about her little charge that he almost believed that she could be her mother, not just her Lady Governess. Mary smiled \"Bessie is a Princess, yes, but she is a girl first. I will let her be a child first!\" Ambrose glanced down to his book, and then back up to Mary and they both gave small laughs of delight for Ambrose cared for his neice, and Mary cared for her neice too... They may have been from two opposing families, but the Princess's happiness, it seemed, was the one thing that they could agree on. Meanwhile, the Princess Bessie wasn't asleep. She had only been pretending so that Mary would leave her alone. Throwing back the blankets, she slipped out of bed and went across to the window. By standing on a stool, and straining her eyes, she could just make out the parks that stretched all around her new home. They would be fun to explore. Maybe she would learn to ride here. If she was old enough to be sent away from home, she was old enough to learn to ride. Well, that's what she'd tell Mary anyway. \" Yes.\" Bessie thought, as she turned from the window and went back to bed. \" I could have fun here. As long as I see Mama and Papa soon, I could learn to like living here.\" 8th November 1551: Whitehall Palace, England Robert, Guilford, Henry and Ambrose walked down the stairs at the end of the hallway. \"We're all married now,\" Ambrose began \"When did we stop being boys and become men?\" \"When King Edward died,\" Robert replied, looking back to his three brothers as he stopped. Twelve year old Edward Herbert was stood in front of him. He bowed and spoke \"Your Majesty. The Queen wishes to see you. She wishes to discuss the tutoring of Prince Edward.\" \"Urgh.\" Henry Dudley groaned, quietly. He had stopped at the top of the stairs. Robert walked around Edward Herbert, who turned to him. Robert smiled, and spoke \"Tell the Queen I will be there shortly.\" Henry Dudley collapsed to the floor, and fell down a few of the stairs. \"Henry!\" Robert was by his brother's side in an instant. Resting Henry's head in his lap, he moved Henry's fringe out of his face, and gasped. Henry had gone bright red in the face, and was struggling to breath. Robert glanced up to Edward Herbert \"Fetch Doctor López, quickly!\" Edward Herbert nodded and ran off down the hall. Robert looked up to Ambrose and Guilford. \"Ambrose, go and check on the family. Make sure that everyone is alright. Guilford, check on the Queen and Prince Edward.\" \"Yes, Your Majesty.\" They both bowed and left. \"Come on, Henry. Stay with me.\" Robert begged his brother, as he refused to take his eyes off of his brother. Henry gave a small smile to Robert. Edward Herbert returned a few moments later. Doctor López was following him. \"Put him in his chambers.\" Dr López began \"I can work better from there.\" Robert nodded, lifted Hery into his arms, and carried him to his chambers. To Be Continued Review please.[Chapter 12] 22nd December 1551: Whitehall Palace, England Thankfully, the sweating sickness, which had claimed many lives, inlcluding the lives of Henry Dudley, Temperance Dudley, Anne Whorwood, and Henry Grey, had passed quickly, but the deaths of Henry Dudley, and Temperance Dudley, had made Robert sadder than ever. He only became happy around the rest of his family, his children, or his wife. As well as this, there was the issue of who was the next heir to the title of Marquess of Dorset. Both of Henry Grey's brothers, Thomas Grey and John Grey of Pirgo, were claiming the title, while Jane, being the eldest surviving child of The Marquess of Dorset, seemed to be the better heir. Lady Frances Brandon, however, wanted the title to go to Thomas Grey, and not her daughter. This made Elizabeth more determined than ever to give the title to Jane or her husband, as Jane was the most senior claimant to the title, and a woman could be a Marquess in her own right, as Elizabeth's mother, Anne Boleyn, had been a Marquess before her marriage to Elizabeth's father, King Henry VIII. Not to mention the fact that she just wanted to spite Frances. \"I will give this some thought, and I will inform you of my decision in due time.\" Elizabeth informed them \"Now, leave my presence. I have work to do.\" They grudgingly left, and Elizabeth let a smirk cross her face, before she broke into a laugh. 23rd December 1551: Whitehall Palace, England Guilford tugged at the collar of his doublet and took a deep breath. As if seeing his brother's distress, John gripped his shoulder tightly, and then slipped in ahead of Guilford, who waited for the herald to announce him before striding forwards, clad in a new doublet and hose of scarlet velvet trimmed with russet brown that he had had commissioned for this very occasion. As he reached the dais, he sank to one knee, glancing up to catch sight of his beloved where she was stood beside the Queen. She beamed down at him athe Queen rose to her feet, lifting a hand to tell the herald that she was ready. The Herald coughed and unrolled a heavy scroll of parchment. \"It is the pleasure of our Sovereign Majesties, Queen Elizabeth I and King Robert, on this day, the Sixteenth day of December in the first year of their reign, anno domini 1551, to create thee, Sir Guilford Dudley, Marquess of Dorset\" As he finished, Guilford heard the King come down off the dais and then felt first, the light weight of the silver Earl's coronet come to rest on his head and then the heavy warmth of his new robes of state being draped around his shoulders, before Robert said \"Arise, My Lord Dorset\" and helped him up, kissing him in friendship, and brotherhood, and handing him the patent of his newfound nobility. Guilford accepted them with gracious thanks, and then the King stepped back. As if she'd been waiting impatiently for the ceremony to be over, which indeed, she probably had, Lady Jane leapt up and ran down the steps of the dais, dashing over to Guilford and flinging her arms about his neck, all dignity forgotten in her great delight. Guilford slipped his arms around her, and meeting the King's twinkling eye over her dark head, tipped Jane head up and kissed her full on the mouth, putting everything he wanted to say but couldn't, not in public, into the kiss instead. \"Well, My Lady Marchioness? Does this please you?\" he murmured daringly into her ear as they broke apart. \"It Pleases me greatly, My Lord Dorset.\" she whispered back, entwining her arm with his as they turned together to greet the next group of people coming up to them to offer Guilford their congratulations on his new peerage. 24th December 1551: Whitehall Palace, England \"Who is that?\" Elizabeth asked, pointing to a woman, stood in the crowd. Robert looked over to the woman in question and smiled \"That Bess, is Lady Amy Robsart.\" He made a gesture with his hands and Amy began to approach. Reaching the throne, she swept into a curtsey and kissed the hand offered by Elizabeth. \"Lady Robsart,\" The Queen began \"You're the heiress to Sir John Robsart, are you not?\" \"I am, Your Majesty.\" Amy replied. Elizabeth noticed that there was a slight nervous quiver in the voice of the nineteen year old girl. \"And yet, you are not married?\" Elizabeth asked \"By now, a girl of your age would be married and have children.\" \"No, Your Majesty, I am not.\" Amy replied \"Robert and I decided not to marry, and he married you instead.\" \"Well,\" Elizabeth began \"I think that Lord Fitzpatrick has taken an interest in you.\" \"He's betrothed.\" Amy replied quickly, looking up to the Queen. \"Betrothed is not married...\" Elizabeth began \"It is a long way on bended knee to the altar.\" Elizabeth waved Amy away with a quick movement of her hand. Amy dropped into a curtsey and left. Barnaby Fitzpatrick, stood in the crowd, was the first to greet her, and, with a small giggle, she took his arm and they disappeaed into the crowd. Elizabeth waited until Amy and Barnaby could not hear, snapped \"What is the meaning of introducing your former betrothed to me, Robin?\" before getting up, and stalking away. Robert sighed and got up, before following his wife. To Be Continued Review please.[Chapter 13] 13th February 1603: Richmond Palace, England Elizabeth stood by the window, watching the courtiers bustle around in the courtyard below. The picture of her husband, Robert, was on the wall. She gave a small smile to herself, stroked the dog in her arms, and thought back to all those years ago. Poor dear Robin, even at this distance of time, I shudder at the memory of those first years. How stubborn, and thoughtless I was, until I learned to be a wife to you. 15th January 1561: Whitehall Palace, England Over the past ten years the family of Elizabeth and Robert had grown. After Edward came Anne in 1553, then John in 1554, followed by Katherine in 1556, Mary in 1558 and Richard in 1560. Elizabeth's cousin's daughter, Mary Stuart, Queen of Scotland, had, in November 1560, become pregnant with the child of the King of France, who had died just over a month ago, and Charles de Valois, Duke of Orléans had arrived in England just over a year prior. \"To return to our matters.\" George Howard began, handing the parchment to Robert \"The weekly reports from Prince Edward's tutors.\" Robert unfolded the parchment and began to read it as George told Elizabeth that \"The Prince is still behind his younger brother-\" \"-And always will be, I'm afraid,\" Robert interrupted, moving to the window so that he could read the parchment better. \"Oh, if only Bessie had been a boy,\" Elizabeth sighed. \"She's so quick,\" Robert replied, smiling, as his voice filled with pride \"She understands everything. Eddie often forgets what he's just learned.\" \"Yet, he is not backward.\" George interrupted, as he approached Robert, who looked up from the parchment \"When he is interested in a subject, he devours it.\" \"I often wonder if we don't push him too hard?\" Elizabeth asked, adjusting herself so that she was looking over the back of the chair that she was sat on \"He looks so tired sometimes.\" \"How can he be tired?\" Robert asked \"We chose to live at Whitehall so that he can have the benefit of the sea air - the castle overlooks the River Thames. Ideal conditions.\" \"Roger Ascham is very strict. I remember him from my time as a child. I, unlike Edward, did well in my studies, and Roger Ascham was a good tutor to me, but he is unsuited to Edward. They are too different.\" \"It is for his own good,\" George assured her. \"The heir to the throne must be as perfect in mind and body as he possibly can be.\" Robert informed his wife. \"He has been very disappointing.\" Elizabeth agreed. \"I have spoken to Ascham on that subject,\" George added \"He agrees with me that the Prince might take more interest in his studies if he was aware of the need to prepare for his high position. He has not yet realised what it means to be the eldest son.\" \"I think Ascham should speak to him.\" Robert informed George. \"When he judges the time is right,\" George replied, and Robert nodded his head in agreement. \"That can be a great shock,\" Elizabeth replied, looking away, sadly \"I remember how it was when I was told. I was two. I had been appointed as my father's legitimate heiress, and my mother told me that I would be Queen one day, if she had no sons.\" 16th January 1561: Whitehall Palace, England \"The Third Punic War!\" Roger Ascham snapped, causing Edward to jump \"The dates of the Third Punic War!\" \"BC?\" Edward asked. \"Of course it is BC!\" Ascham snapped in reply. He looked to John \"Prince John?\" \"149 to 146BC.\" John replied. \"And who was the victor?\" Ascham directed the question at Edward. \"Hannibal?\" Edward asked, not knowing the answer to the question. \"Not unless he deserted and joined the Romans!\" Ascham snapped and John chuckled. Ascham glared at him, snapped \"It is not a matter for liberty!\" and he fell silent as Ascham walked away, moving to his desk. Ascham glanced back to Edward for a moment and asked \"The Sieges of Boulogne?\" \"The 19th of July 1544 to the 18th of September 1544.\" Edward gave the right answer top Ascham's question. \"The Rough Wooing?\" Ascham asked \"1543 to 1550.\" Once again, Edward gave the right answer. \"Why is it that you cannot remember anything that you have read of Ancient History, while you know the dates and numbers of the campaigns of this century?\" Ascham asked, frustratedly. \"Because they are real.\" \"You do not believe that the history I teach you is true?\" Ascham asked, holding his long ruler between his fingers. \"Well, yes sir,\" Edward replied \"But the history of today is more important.\" \"Why?\" Ascham asked. \"See, when I am old enough, I want to join the army,\" Edward replied, smiling. John smiled too \"I am going into the navy.\" \"Indeed?\" Ascham asked \"May I remind you, gentlemen, that there are minimum standards of education required for offices in the services, which you are both still far short of attaining.\" He glanced to John \"Prince John, you are dismissed.\" Both Edward and John rose and Ascham pointed his ruler at Edward \"You will stay here.\" \"But we're expected for tea, Mr Ascham,\" John informed Ascham. \"Then you will inform your parents that I have detained your brother...\" Ascham replied \"...for reasons best known to them.\" \"I'll wait for you,\" John whispered to Edward before leaving the room. Edward slumped into the chair and looked down at his lap until Ascham spoke. \"Your lack of application cannot fail to distress your parents.\" Ascham, who was opening a book, informed him \"Great care and attention has been lavished on your mental development - to no avail.\" Ascham placed the book down in front of him and Edward looked to it as Ascham continued \"The tables of the Kings of England. To prove that you are capable of some concentration, you will recite and memorize them. Start with your great-grandfather.\" \"Richard III.\" Edward read off the list. \"Plantagenet.\" Ascham stated \"He was succeeded by your great-grandfather, the first Tudor, who was-?\" He pointed to the name in the book. \"Henry VII.\" Edward read the words in the book in front of him. \"He had two sons,\" Ascham continued \"Arthur, the elder, died, so he was succeeded by?\" \"Henry VIII.\" Like before, Edward repeated the words that were in the book in front of him. \"Who had three children, Mary, the eldest, by Katherine of Aragon, Elizabeth, by Anne Boleyn, and the youngest, Edward, by Jane Seymour.\" Ascham stated, moving behind Edward \"Who succeeded Henry?\" \"Edward VI.\" \"Then?\" \"Queen Elizabeth.\" Edward, after reading the name in front of him, stopped for a moment, a look of confusion passing over his face. \"Yes?\" Ascham asked, seeing Edward's confused face \"What is it?\" Edward looked up to him \"Why did Edward come before Mary and Elizabeth? Surely that's wrong?\" \"No,\" Ascham replied, moving around Edward \"He was the eldest son.\" \"But his sisters were older!\" Edward protested. \"That makes no difference. It is the eldest son who becomes King.\" Edward's jaw fell in shock. He was to be the Future King of England? Ten Minutes Later Elizabeth noticed John enter the room and smiled \"John!\" \"I am sorry I am late, Mama,\" He replied, bowing. \"Nevermind,\" Robert interrupted, brushing it off \"Come and join us.\" John moved to his chair, and Robert asked \"Where's Eddie?\" \"He was kept in.\" John replied. \"Oh, why?\" Robert asked. \"Mr Ascham wanted to talk to him.\" John replied, looking anxious. \"Where is he now?\" Elizabeth interrupted. \"In the kitchen.\" John replied \"He doesn't want to come in.\" \"What?\" Robert started out of his chair. John jumped and Elizabeth placed a hand onto the hand of her husband. \"No, Robert,\" She began, rising so that she was stood up, like her husband \"Perhaps I'd better see him first.\" She walked around the table, pushed open the door and entered the kitchen, before calling \"Edward?\" as the door closed behind her and Edward could hear his mother's voice call his name again \"Edward?\" Edward was sat on the floor with his legs pulled up to his chest. He had his arms around his legs to hold them close to him. When his mother called his namefor the second time, hHe stood up, and was not facing his mother. \"Is it true?\" He asked \"I'm going to be King?\" \"Yes,\" Elizabeth replied \"One day you will be King.\" She smiled \"Not for some time yet, but one day.\" \"I thought Bessie would be Queen. Like you,\" he replied, sadly. Elizabeth now realised what was wrong \"No dear,\" she replied, soothingly, moving around the table to reach Edward as she continued speaking \"I became Queen because my brother, King Edward VI, had no brothers and his Act of Succession, passed in 1550, appointed me as his heir if he had no children, which he did not,\" \"Why not John? He could do it\" Edward protested, still not looking at his mother \"or Richard?\" \"It is your right, Edward.\"She replied \"You are the heir.\" \"But I don't want too,\" Edward finally turned to her and she could see that he was crying, the tears rolling down his round, plump cheeks. He threw himself at his mother crying \"I don't want too!\" and she caught him, placing one hand on his back and the other on the back of his read haired head. He clutched her tightly as she began to speak. \"Oh, my dear. It is not what we want,\" she replied, stroking his hair, lovingly \"But what we must, what is our duty,\" She moved him backwards a little, and he looked up a little, to her. \"Why can't father be King?\" he asked, swallowing hard. Elizabeth smiled, sadly \"I only wiah he could,\" She replied \"But, always remember, if anything happens to me, he will be here to guide you and protect you. That is why you must work hard, to make yourself worthy of him...\" \"I can't,\" he protested, sadly \"I can't-\" \"Yes you can. If you try.\" Elizabeth interrupted, taking him by the shoulder. She was not scolding him; instead, she was encouraging him. \"You are his son.\" She pulled out a tissue, with which she mopped his cheeks \"Now, dry your eyes, and let him see - let us all see - how brave you can be. Now,\" she held out her arm. He moved into the embrace and she smiled, placing a small kiss onto his forehead \"let us join your siblings,\" \"Yes, Mama,\" he mopped the tears off of his cheeks, and Elizabeth led him into the dining room. As the door opened, they both heard laughing. Robert had Richard on his back, and was galloping like a horse. As Robert continued his story, for the enjoyment of his children, Elizabeth followed her son into the room, and closed the door behind her. At the sound of the door closing, Robert stopped, and he and the other children, including Charles de Valois, Duke of Orléans, the betrothed of Princess Elizabeth, all looked in their direction. \"Ah, well now that you're ready, perhaps we can have some tea?\" \"Y-Yes, Papa,\" Edward replied, and Elizabeth gave a smile that only he could see. He moved to his place, and Elizabeth moved to her chair. Robert pushed the chair under her, as despite being his wife, she was still Queen. Once she was sat down, he took his seat, and then the children sat down. 17th January 1561: Whitehall Palace, England \"You and I are not that different, Charles.\" Edward informed his future brother-in-law as they sat on the bench in the garden where their siblings were playing. The bench was in a secluded section of the garden. Large conifers surrounded the back of the path where the benches sat and the sun shone through a gap in the trees. \"We're not?\" Charles asked. \"No,\" Edward replied \"We're not. You and I are not the favourite children of our parents. Your sister, Elisabeth, the Queen of Spain, is your mother's favourite child, and Bessie is my father's favourite child. Neither he, nor my mother, approve of how I am.\" \"I am sorry for you, Edward.\" \"Thank you,\" Edward replied \"But I am sorry for you. My parents may not approve of how I am, but my god, I am glad that I am their son and not the son of Catherine de' Medici, for she is a very dominating woman, I hear.\" \"She is,\" Charles agreed \"But only to us boys. The girls can get away with anything, for Margaret, Claude and Elisabeth are the favoured ones. Francis is too young to know this, for he is not yet six years old, and does not know any different.\" \"Your brother is the Duke of Anjou and Alencon is he not?\" \"Francis is the Duke of Alençon, Château-Thierry, Anjou, Berry and Touraine,\" Charles replied to the question from his future brother-in-law \"Father, I believe, favoured him over us. My brother, the former King of France, was never favoured by father due to his stutter. Henry was favoured by mother. He was her favourite, and still is. She calls him chers yeux, which means Precious Eyes, and lavishes fondness and affection upon him. I detest him. He has greater health and activity than I do.\" Charles sighed, and Edward placed a hand onto the shoulder of his future brother-in-law and smiled to him. \"However,\" Charles continued \"Despite being considered the best of the sons, he has little interest in the traditional Valois pastimes of hunting and physical exercise. He is fond of fencing and is skilled in it, but he prefers to indulge his tastes for the arts and reading.\" \"He is like me then,\" Edward noted \"We both prefer reading to physical exercise. John prefers hunting and riding rather than reading, and Dickon is a baby.\" \"Dickon?\" \"Our nickname for Richard.\" Edward clarified \"Elizabeth is Bessie, I am Eddie, Anne is Annie, John is Johnny, Katherine is Kitty, Mary does not have a nickname, and Richard is known as Dickon. It's just informal names throughout the family. Papa refers to Mama as Bessie, and she calls him Robin.\" \"I see,\" Charles replied. \"I believe that they were affectionate names from when they were younger.\" Edward added \"I believe that Mama referred to Papa as Robin when they were eight, and the name carried on throughout the years as a term of affection.\" \"Your parents love each other then?\" \"They do,\" Edward replied \"They love each other a damn sight more than they love me.\" Edward gave a harsh cough when he had finished speaking. \"Are you alright?\" \"I'm fine,\" Edward replied \"I just feel really hot.\" \"It's the middle of winter,\" Charles informed him. Edward ran a hand over his forehead, and wiped off the sweat that had begun to form. \"Are you alright?\" Charles asked, placing his hand to Edward's forehead. A few moments later, he pulled it back \"Ow! Edward, your burning! I'm going to get help, wait here!\" Edward atttempted to rise, and stop his future brother-in-law, but was aunable to as a blast of pain shot through his back. His head began to throb, and he had a feeling of general discomfort. His future brother-in-law scrambled off and Edward could hear the thudding footfalls become quieter and quieter. A few moments later, the sound of two pairs of clattering shoes echoed, and Charles returned. Queen Elizabeth was behind him. She took one look at her son and covered her mouth in shock. She crouched in front of Edward, and lifted up his head. He clapped a hand to his mouth, gagged for a moment, and turning his head to the left, threw up on the floor. \"Charles,\" She began, using the name of her future son-in-law, rather than his title \"Fetch Doctor Owens and my husband, quickly!\" Charles scrambled away, disappearing down the path towards Whitehall Palace. A few minutes later, Charles returned with Doctor Owens and Robert in tow. Charles, Robert and Elizabeth stepped back as Doctor Owens examined Edward. Elizabeth and Robert began discussing what should happen with the health of their children and finally came to a decision that Robert should run the households of their children. Once he had finished, Doctor Owens looked up to the Queen \"Majesty, he has the Smallpox.\" Elizabeth gasped in shock, Robert took her in his arms and Charles moaned \"No,\" in disbelief and shock. To Be Continued Review please.[Chapter 14] 18th January 1561: Whitehall Palace, England: The Royal Nursery The court seemed more subdued than usual. For suggesting that she leave her son's side, Queen Elizabeth had confined Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk to the Tower of London on pain of death, and had almost beaten one of her ladies. The only person who hadn't been scolded was Lady Katherine Ashley, who had, eventually, been able make the Queen leave her son's side and while Elizabeth paced her chambers, Prince John and the other royal children were discussing what would happen if their brother died. \"If Edward dies,\" Bessie began, looking up to her younger siblings \"Then you are the Prince of Wales.\" \"I know,\" John replied, barely glancing to Bessie, from his position in the chair near the window. \"And Mama and Papa will spend all of their time raising you to be King and me to be a Queen.\" As Bessie spoke, John could hear the amibition in her voice and knew that she would be perfectly fine with Edward's death. \"I know,\" John replied again, barely manging to keep the anger out of his voice. \"And then-\" \"Just be quiet, Bessie!\" John roared, swirling to Bessie causing her to nearly jump out of her skin \"For goodness sake, you are wishing Edward to his grave!\" \"I am not!\" \"YES, YOU ARE!\" John thundered, angrily pointing a finger at her \"YOU DON'T CARE WHETHER EDWARD DIES OR NOT! YOU ONLY CARE ABOUT BEING ONE STEP CLOSER TO THE THRONE!\" \"No, I, I,\" Bessie began to protest, but John cut her off. \"You don't care,\" He hissed, prodding her chest with his finger \"You just want one less threat in your way to the throne, well, I assure you , Bessie, that I will not let you get it. I don't care if I become Prince of Wales after Edward's death, or not, but I do not want a bitch like you taking the throne. Papa says that you're a woman fit for being Queen of France, but if Charles de Valois, Duke of Orléans marries you, then he is getting nothing but a traitress for a wife!\" Princess Anne, aged eight, gasped and covered the ears of five year old Princess Katherine, who in turn covered the ears of three year old Princess Mary. Prince Richard, aged one, giggled happily, copying his sisters and covering his ears. John and Bessie glared at each other, but neither moved. With a shrill cry of \"Please!\" Anne interrupted, seperating the squabbling siblings \"Arguing isn't going to make Edward well again!\" \"Yes, you're right, Annie. You're right.\" John conceded to his elder sister and returned to his chair, but, nonetheless, no-one dared to approach him, for they knew that, like Edward, he had inherited the unstoppable temper of their mother and grandfather. 18th January 1561: Whitehall Palace, England: Chambers of Queen Elizabeth and King Robert Robert ducked as another paperweight soared over his head. He had been ducking for about an hour as his wife had been furiously throwing things at him. His sister, Lady Mary Sidney, nee Dudley, had narrowly avoided being hit by a paperweight and had ushered all of the Queen's ladies out of the Queen's chambers and, when Robert Cecil had tried to interfere, he had been violently smacked over the head with a very large and very hard tome and was now under the care of Doctor Rodrigo López. \"This is all your fault!\" Elizabeth roared, tossing another paperweight at him as the previous one smashed against the wall behind. \"My fault?\" Robert asked, confused. \"Yes!\" Elizabeth snapped, rummaging through one of the drawers in her desk before picking out a translation, which she had written for her brother when she was thirteen years old, and tossing it at Robert. The thick book soared through the air, missed Robert and crashed against the wall with a loud crunch \"If you hadn't favoured Bessie then we would have seen this earlier!\" \"You favour Bessie too!\" Robert snapped in reply. \"Because she is like me!\" Elizabeth snapped \"But I did not neglect our other children either!\" Elizabeth's temper, already explosive, was beginning to bubble again, and, with one last hurl of a paperweight, she cried \"BY GOD, I SHOULD NEVER HAVE MARRIED YOU!\" before slamming open the double doors and stalking away, leaving her shocked husband behind. With a loud smash, the doors slammed shut behind her, and the picture of Henry VIII, which had been on the wall, fell to the floor with a monumental crunch. Striding down the hall, Elizabeth shook her head to prevent the tears from falling and stopped outside a doorway; the doorway to Prince Edward's room. She knew that her son would be asleep right now, and that he shouldn't be disturbed, but she couldn't help herself. Reaching out, she gripped the handle and pushed the door open. The sight that was before her made her gasp in shock. Edward, wrapped tightly in red towels and covered in red spots, was curled up on the bed. Buckets and cloths were strewn around and several ladies were dabbing his forehead with the cloths. When they spotted Elizabeth, they dropped into curtsey, murmuring \"Your Majesty,\" as they did so. Elizabeth waved them off and glanced to Edward, before moving elegantly over to the bed and glancing to one of the ladies, Lady Amy Fitzpatrick, nee Robsart \"How is he?\" \"There's no change, Your Majesty.\" Amy replied, sadly glancing over to the boy \"Doctor Owens says that if he has not made an improvement by tonight, then he is not likely to recover at all.\" Elizabeth nodded and moved to the bed. Taking a seat, she settled herself at the edge of her son's bed, and, once all the ladies had left, began to cry into her arms, which were on the side of the bed. Thick tears leaked from her blue eyes and her body shook. \"Mama?\" 19th January 1561: Whitehall Palace, England: Chambers of Queen Elizabeth and King Robert \"Your Majesties,\" Began Doctor Owens as he stood opposite the Queen and King \"Prince Edward, due to his recent improvement, is likely to make a full recovery over the next few days, but I bring bad news.\" \"Bad news?\" Robert asked, as he felt Elizabeth tense in his arms \"What's wrong?\" \"Despite his recovery,\" Began Doctor Owens \"His Highness, The Prince of Wales, is likely to have difficulty conceiving children. It is very likely that his Highness, The Duke of York, will succeed the Prince of Wales as King after his death, Your Majesties.\" Robert had gone pale, and, once Doctor Owens finished, he breathed \"He'll be infertile?\" \"It is possible, Your Majesty, but it is also possible that he will be entirely normal,\" Replied Doctor Owens. Elizabeth waved her hand in a motion and Doctor Owens knew that she wanted him to leave. He bowed, murmured \"Majesties,\" and left the room. Elizabeth seemed to be struggling to take in the thought of her heir apparent being infertile \"What are we going to do if Edward is infertile?\" \"We shall change the succession, Bess,\" Robert replied \"We shall remove Edward from the succession and give him a new title, and give John the title of Prince of Wales and make him our heir.\" \"Robin!\" Scolded Elizabeth, shocked at the words of her husband \"We cannot do that. Edward is our eldest son and our heir. Besides, John will have heirs and they will succeed their father.\" \"I hope that you are right, Bess,\" Replied Robert, uncertainly \"For the sake of England.\" \"Edward is smarter than you give him credit for, Robin,\" Elizabeth replied \"You often push him to hard, Robin.\" \"My son must be perfect in every way, Bess.\" Robert stated, sitting in one of the chairs by the fire. \"I understand that, Robin.\" She replied, placing a hand onto his arm \"But some nights you do not allow him to sleep because he has not, in your eyes, done well enough. What he lacks in brains, he makes up for in other ways. He is affectionate, and understands military tactics, meaning that he will be able to defend this country when he is King.\" \"I trust you, Bess,\" Replied Robert \"but Edward has been nothing but a failure since his lessons began. John, who is three years younger than Edward, is smarter than his brother.\" \"He is only smarter when it comes to lessons and physical activity,\" Elizabeth replied \"John, however, is terrible when it comes to military tactics. He has no idea of what to do in a situation. I saw Edward and John playing together a few weeks ago, and when Edward had the advantage, John began to panic and made several mistakes, despite being fitter and slimmer than his brother.\" Glancing up to the clock, Robert nodded in acknowledgement of his wife's words, and he and Elizabeth, now reunited, climbed into bed. The previous argument, which had been over favouring their children, lay forgotten in their minds. To Be Continued Review please.[Chapter 15] 17th February 1561: Whitehall Palace, England \"Her Majesty, Catherine Culpeper, formerly Tudor, nee Howard, Dowager Queen of England, Ireland and France, Viscountess Culpeper!\" The double ingress swung open, and Catherine Howard, Dowager Queen of England, strode into the room with her head held high. Catherine, who had just been a girl of twenty one at the time of King Henry's death, had now blossomed into an attractive woman, who had just entered her fourty-first year. Reaching the throne, on which sat her step-daughter, she dropped into a curtsey. Queen Elizabeth, now firmly settled on the throne, glanced down to her step-mother. Most people were certain that Queen Catherine had caused the death of King Henry VIII and, for a while, gossip had spread around court about that matter. Though she would never admit it, Queen Elizabeth sincerly hoped that Queen Catherine had been behind the death of her father, for at the death of her father, she and Mary had been free - though Mary had been forced into a difficult position under the reign of Edward - who had succeeded after their father. Extending a hand, Queen Elizabeth held out her engagement ring for Catherine to kiss, which, sweeping into a curtsey, she did. \"Dear sweat, step-mother,\" Began Queen Elizabeth as Catherine rose from the curtsey \"You must come to court more often. Your presence is a welcome one here at court - especially since you have not been to court in ten years. You remember my daughter, Princess Elizabeth, I assume?\" \"Your Highness,\" Catherine dipped into a curtsey and gave a nod of her head in the direction of Princess Bessie \"I have not seen you since you were a toddler - and a precocious toddler at that.\" Princess Bessie smiled, dipped a curtsey back and said \"Thank you, Your Majesty. It is a pleasure to see you again after so long.\" \"It is a pleasure to see you as well, Your Highness,\" Replied Catherine, smiling as she dipped into another curtsey. \"Please,\" Began Queen Elizabeth, interrupting the two women and gesturing to the nearby chair that had been prepared for Catherine's return to the court that she had once reigned over as Queen Consort \"Sit.\" Catherine sat on the chair offered to her by her step-daughter and smiled as Princess Bessie took her seat as well. Why the other members of the Royal Family were not here, Catherine did not know, but she had heard, from several sources, that Princess Bessie was betrothed to France and would, shortly after her twelfth birthday, be married to the Duke of Orléans, whom was in England so that he and his betrothed could get to know each other before they were married. 18th February 1561: Whitehall Palace, England: The Royal Nursery \"I have never met Queen Catherine,\" Began Prince John, from his seat on the window, where he was reading a book on Latin translations \"What is she like?\" \"She has changed from when I was a toddler,\" Replied Princess Bessie from her position on the floor, where she was sat with Prince Richard, who was watching his siblings intently \"When I was a toddler Queen Catherine was merely a girl; she was naive and flighty and married with a son. Now, she is still married, and still has a son, but is older and less naive.\" \"She sounds like Mama,\" Noted Prince Edward. He was laying on his plump stomach and his book, also on Latin translations, was propped up against the wall. \"Mama is not naive,\" Corrected Princess Anne. She, like Bessie, was sat on the floor with little Prince Richard, who, now playing with a small toy, began to laugh happily. \"But, she must have been when she was younger,\" Interrupted Princess Katherine, who, like her two elder siblings, was sat on another window seat \"For everyone is.\" Princess Mary, aged three, did not join in the discussion as she was not yet betrothed and wouldn't be for several years. She turned to the pouting Prince Richard and began to play with him, causing him to stop pouting. \"I assume that Annie's marriage was discussed, Bessie?\" Questioned Edward \"After all, Bessie and I are betrothed, so why shouldn't you be?\" \"Annie's marriage was not discussed,\" Replied Bessie \"And do not forget, Edward, that you are not betrothed yet. Mama and Papa have not decided on who you are to be married to yet.\" Edward pouted, his round face momentarily going red as he looked away from Anne and Bessie and stared out of the window as a single tear - which was quickly wiped away - dropped down his cheek. 19th February 1561: Whitehall Palace, England: Prince Edward's Chambers \"Is something wrong, Edward?\" John asked as he sat opposite his brother and caught sight of the thoughtful look on his brother's round face. \"No,\" Replied Edward, glancing up to his brother and giving a small smile. \"You don't think that father is planning to scold you again, do you?\" Questioned John, as he leaned across the table for a moment. \"Probably, but that's not important now.\" Edward replied and John sighed \"As you know, Johnnie, I am to be married. You won't tell anyone who doesn't need to know will you?\" \"Of course not.\" John replied, smiling \"Are congratulations in order?\" \"No, they certainly are not,\" Edward moaned, momentarily placing his head in his hand \"Who's the Princess they have chosen then?\" John asked, wonderingly. \"I don't know, Johnnie,\" Edward stated. \"Will Mama and Papa just tell you who you're going to marry?\" John asked, confused \"Not quite as crude as that,\" Edward informed his brother, smiling slightly at his brother's lack of knowledge on marriage \"They make a selection, and I have the final choice. Only the choice is incredibly limited.\" He trailed off as one of his servants placed a small glass of wine in front of him and another in front of John. Edward picked it up and said \"I don't know why I drink this stuff, it makes my waistline grow more than food already does, and it makes father moan more than usual.\" \"It sounds as if you're going to need it.\" John chuckled, as he emptied his glass in one gulp \"They've scoured the Royal Families and come up with only six Princesses who have the right ancestors.\" Edward informed his brother \"The first, Princess Elisabeth of France, is betrothed to the Spanish, so she's out as people still remember our Aunt Mary, and her evil Catholic and Spanish ways; the second, a Swedish Princess is only three, so thank heavens she's out, and the third, Lucrezia de' Medici, has got consumption.\" Edward reached inside his doublet and pulled out three small portraits \"So that leaves three. Three French Princesses... and that's the choice.\" He placed the three portraits onto the table between him and his brother. John picked up the three portraits and looked over each one. He looked indifferent at the portrait of the almost eight year old Princess Margaret of France, but burst out laughing at the portraits of her sisters, the almost five year old Princess Joan of France and her twin, Princess Victoria of France. \"If you must laugh,\" Began Edward, his voice betraying his annoyance \"Kindly do it in a decorous manner.\" \"Sorry,\" Blushed John. \"Well, Johnnie,\" Began Edward, glancing to his brother \"What would you do if you had to marry one of them?\" \"Frankly, Edward, I'd rather be sent to the tower.\" Replied John, laughing. \"So would I, Johnnie,\" Edward replied, gesturing for another glass of wine and lifting it up, before saying \"So would I.\" and emptying the glass in one gulp.

This story is most certainly AU. I decided to do this after reading the forums. I read Lady Eleanor Boleyn's challenge (Challenge 22#) and I was really interested in what would happen next so I thought why not right it myself. I hope you enjoy. Disclaimer: I do not own history as that belongs in the past and has already been done. * Just to let you, the reader, know that this story starts in October 1560, a month after Amy Robstart, Robert Dudley's first wife dies.* Prologue 8 th October 1560 No one knew what to do. Elizabeth was pacing down the halls waiting for the man that she loved to arrive. Everyone knew that Robert Dudley was the Queen's favourite and know that his wife had 'mysteriously' died; power-hungry nobles were scared that one of their own could become their next King. They liked it not. Elizabeth, of course, knew the whispers and being the daughter of a woman whose life had been filled with rumours that would eventually lead her to the scaffold, Elizabeth liked to be beyond reproach. This of course was not one of those times. All she wanted to do was be held in the man's she loved arms, just for a moment. One of her ladies and her cousin, the young Lettice Knollys, was quickly walking towards her. \"Your majesty,\" said the young girl as she curtseyed. \"The Earl of Leicester is waiting in your presence chamber waiting to see you.\" In no mood to give a reply, Elizabeth dashed through the hallways with Lettice moving her smaller frame quickly behind the Queen as they moved in and out of courtiers who were scattered around the place. No sooner than when they started the journey to her presence chamber where they actually there. The Earl of Leicester bowed towards Elizabeth and she dismissed all others who were there to wait upon her. As the last of the servants shut the door behind them, Elizabeth ran over to Dudley and embraced him in a hug. This is a moment she had waited to do for weeks. The scandal of Amy Dudley's (nee' Robstart) death was now in the past. For Elizabeth, this meant there future. Of course, she would never want to see an innocent girl die. It was mysterious. She had never heard of what happened truly. The inquiry came to the conclusion of misfortune and that was all that Elizabeth needed to know. It was an accident and her beloved Dudley was off the hook. \"Elizabeth, my darling, oh how I missed you,\" said Robert, who then planted a kiss on her lips. It was unexpected but it was good to her nerveless. Elizabeth pulled away from him then. She didn't want to have any blemish on their names. Especially, since what she was about to say would change their lives forever. \"Robert, please sit down, there is something that I need to ask you,\" she said as she pointed towards the bay window which was within the room. \"You know that I would do anything that you asked of me,\" said Dudley with all the suave of a gentleman. \"Well then, Robert we have known each other for a long time and you must know that my heart belongs to no one else but you,\" nervously said Elizabeth. Dudley smiled and nodded in response. \"Robert,\" she continued. \"Would you do me the honour of becoming my husband?\" Robert knelt and took Elizabeth's hand in his and kissed it. As he lifted his eyes to look at hers he said, \"You would be doing me the honour.\" And with that Elizabeth felt that her whole world was complete. She was to be married like her parliament had been pressuring her to do and she would hopefully produce an heir to her throne, her father's throne and her grandfather's throne before that. She wanted a son to be the living image of his father. William Cecil could not believe the news that he had just been told by his Queen. She was to be married which was a plus for himself and for England as a union could produce an heir and prevent civil war striking but this was not the union he was wanting to plan. He was hoping an alliance with French or the Spanish would come with a marriage union but instead she decided she would be marrying Leicester. Cecil was speechless and more so, how was he supposed to tell the other nobles that one of their own would be rising so high. \"Your Majesty, are you sure that I am the best person to be telling the nobles? Wouldn't you yourself prefer to tell them this most...joyous news?\" said a rather nervous Cecil. He quickly got out a handkerchief to wipe his brow of the sweat that was appearing on the top of his head. Elizabeth just stared at him with her black eyes, the eyes she inherited from her long lost mother. \"Cecil, it is either you or Walsingham and at this moment you are the best choice. Walsingham will not be happy with the match and I am most sure that you are either but you are the better as you choose to not argue with me.\" Cecil simply nodded, bowed and walked out of the room to let Elizabeth and her ladies organize her wedding details. The first person he was to encounter in the hallway though was Walsingham. Walsingham had a solemn look on his face. \"Cecil, which one of us is to tell the rest of the nobles and parliament?\" asked Walsingham. His spies were obviously at work again and this time it was not the best news he could have been delivered. Cecil sighed. \"It is I. Please save me if they are about to launch for my neck.\" Walsingham laughed. Obviously the death of Amy Robstart had not diminished Dudley's name enough and know he was to be there King. Walsingham was shocked but what could he do to change the mind of the fiery daughter of Henry VIII. 15 th November 1560 Elizabeth checked herself over in her floor length mirror. Her long, just off-white wedding dress was immaculate. The roses in her hair placed perfectly. Today she was to be married, not for political ambition but for love and she was thankful for that. She remembered a long time ago when she was only eight years old and she had just heard the news of her cousin and her third step-mother, Katherine Howard's, death. She remembered telling her future husband that she would never marry. She vowed she would never but it looks like today was the day that she was breaking that vow. The ceremony was to be a public one. She wanted the people, who loved her, to love their new King Consort. She wanted him to be more popular than Phillip of Spain ever was. She could already see that the people liked him. He was English, which they liked and wasn't an outsider from another country trying to take this small Empire just so it could be part of their bigger and greater one. Parliament on the other hand disagreed with the matter completely. There was uproar and Elizabeth made Dudley stay at one of his many country estates until they nobles had cooled down. She had only seen him a couple of times since. Today was the marking of a turning point in their lives and the life of England. All she wanted was to be happy. AN: I hoped you all liked the prologue. I will try to write another chapter soon. Please review. (the next chapter could be a time jump) TBC[Chapter 2] AN: Welcome to a new chapter of 'Consort of Gloriana'. Yes, there is a time jump in this chapter but I promise that I won't do that again for quite a few more chapters.[Chapter 3] AN: Here again is another chapter. I am excited that other people are excited. Thank you for all the reviews. Anyway I am glad that I am getting positive responses for little Princess Anne. Well anyway, I guess onto another chapter.

Chapter Two 24 th May 1562 Elizabeth was in her room's cradling her daughter in her arms. Her ladies were around her giggling at anything that was different and new that little Anne did. Elizabeth had an idea that this little Princess was going to be spoilt. Robert Dudley was standing in the doorway. Unnoticed by Elizabeth or her ladies he continued to look on at the scene before him. It wasn't long though that Lettice Knollys noticed him and bowed. The rest of the ladies bowed and Elizabeth looked up from Anne and towards her husband. Robert walked closer to the two of them and excused the ladies from their presence. This was one of the rare family moments they would have and they both knew it. \"Her wet nurse says she feeds well,\" stated Elizabeth, making sure that Robert did take an interest in their daughter, even if she wasn't the son that he wished for. \"That is what is to be expected of a princess of England is it not,\" said Robert. He loved his daughter. They were both young. Maybe this was test to see if they could have a healthy child and raise it right. God must be testing them he thought, giving them a challenge. \"Robin, I have organised that the Princess, our daughter, has her own establishment. She shall receive it in the coming month and I wish that to be at Hatfield. There was nothing wrong with it when I resided there and I think it would work just fine for her,\" said Elizabeth. This wasn't a question, this was a statement. She knew that Robert would have to agree. \"I am sure Hatfield will be perfect for our daughter. I am sorry that you do not want her to stay here much longer as she is a ray of sunshine,\" said Robert smiling down at his daughter's little face. \"I wish it was possible but I must govern this country but I will see her every moment I can. I want to be an active mother in her life. Like my own mother tried to be before she was...\" Elizabeth couldn't say the word. Her voice choked up. Robert gently placed a hand on Elizabeth's back for comfort. She at least had the reassurance that she would never be taken away from her precious daughter. Mary, Queen of Scotland, had just received the news that her cousin, the Queen of England, had given birth to a child, a daughter, the Princess Anne. Her position as rightful heir to the English throne was now a step further away. Yet she was still the true Queen of England and she would continue to proclaim it. She was frightened though. Elizabeth had been able to give birth to a healthy child, a daughter though, but still a healthy child. She had nothing. Yes, her husband had died when they were both young and of course he had never been the healthiest of men and she was never able of conceiving a child. She had a sudden urge, no a need to marry again, a need to have an heir to Scotland and a true heir to the English throne. \"Thank you, Lord Darnley, for telling me the news of this most joyous occasion. You have served me well,\" said Mary to the man who had been the messenger. There was something about this man, maybe his loyalty to her and the Catholic faith, that made her want to know more about the man behind the man. 16 th June 1562 It was finally time that little ray of sunshine within the court was taken to her own establishment at Hatfield. Elizabeth had decided to take her daughter to Hatfield and examine that everything at her old home was in top condition. Robert could not come thanks to a cold he had contracted and was forced to bed rest. As they reached Hatfield, Elizabeth had a flood of memories come to her mind of the time she had spent there, some were good and some were bad but for her little Anne she hoped that it would all be pleasant. Anne had grown so much since the time of her birth; Elizabeth couldn't believe it was the same child. She was still healthy, that was a good sign. She hoped that Anne now living in the country could only improve her health. Elizabeth was helped out of the carriage and handed her daughter. The people she had assigned to work here at Hatfield had arrived the day before to make sure that everything was in working order for the arrival and stay of the princess. As they bowed before the Queen and their own Princess, they each relished in the amount of responsibility that had each been given. Mary Knollys, the Queen's cousin and a well educated lady, had been assigned as the Princess's governess. She felt that it was a great responsibility. Her position was well thanks to her relationship with the Queen but she did hope not to let her down or her family. \"Hello my dear people. You have been all honoured with a position of great importance to me and to his majesty the King Consort,\" stated Elizabeth. \"You are all important members of the Princess's household. Do your jobs well and you will be rewarded for it.\" Elizabeth handed her precious daughter over to Lady Mary. \"Your Majesty, we will all do our best to take care of the Princess of England.\" Elizabeth smiled. She trusted her cousin as she had known her for a long time. She hated the feeling of separation though but her daughter was a Princess and she was a Queen. It was to be expected. 17 th June 1562 Elizabeth's mind was elsewhere. It was thinking of her daughter. She wondered how she was doing and how she was feeding. Suddenly, her mind was diverted to the door of her empty presence chamber. Lady Lettice Knollys was standing at the door. \"Your majesty, may I speak with you,\" said the young lady at the door. She looked frightened but she thought that Elizabeth should understand. She was a mother as well. \"Yes, please come and talk.\" She needed conversation, anything to bring her mind to present situations. \"I am here to ask for my leave,\" said the nervous Lettice. Elizabeth looked stunned. Why would this young healthy girl need time for leave? \"Why?\" \"Your Majesty, I am with child, my husband's child and he would like it that I did not exert myself and we are to live in my husband's country seat.\" \"Who is your husband?\" asked Elizabeth. It would probably seem obvious once she knew but at the moment she didn't truly care. \"Walter Devereux, your majesty. He is also the Viscount Hereford.\" \"Yes, I know him. He is a good servant to both of our majesties. I am sorry for not remembering. My mind is elsewhere these days.\" \"Don't worry, your majesty,\" Lettice said touchingly as she placed a hand on top of Elizabeth's hand. \"Your daughter is in fine hands. My sister will be making sure that her every whim is attended to and that all your commands are set out perfectly.\" \"I am sure you are right. Anyway, you will soon know that feeling as well. Congratulations and I will gladly let you have leave,\" said Elizabeth. She stood up and hugged her cousin. Elizabeth wasn't a truly affectionate person but this was her cousin and Lettice had served her well. \"Maybe, if you have a daughter, she could be a companion to the Princess.\" Lettice nodded. That was an extremely generous offer and one her husband would surely accept. He of course was adamant that it would be a boy but that is what every father says about their unborn child. Robert Dudley had recovered quickly from his cold and was soon up and about. The first thing he was going to do was to go and find his wife. He found Elizabeth sitting in her rooms with a few ladies around. Of course, a few of his own gentlemen followed him around like hawks. The ladies bowed as he walked in and the gentlemen bowed at Elizabeth. \"Leave us,\" commanded Elizabeth. All the ladies and gentlemen left the couple in a second. Robert ran over to Elizabeth and embraced her in a hug and a kiss. \"Robin, thank god you are better,\" said Elizabeth. \"I could not have lived knowing you were unwell.\" \"Bess, it was merely a cold. The weather change must have gotten to me,\" brushed off Robert. \"How was our daughter?\" \"Anne behaved as ever like a princess. It is like she already knows that she is one,\" said Elizabeth, obviously proud of her daughter. \"Well, if we have one well behaved daughter, why not have more children Bess?\" Elizabeth immediately snapped her head around at him. Was it that he did not love their daughter? No, that wasn't it; it was probably Walsingham and Cecil in his ear telling him that they needed a son. She had been an unwanted daughter and she was able enough to govern her country, why could Anne not be able to. \"Do you think Anne not able to rule?\" asked the now tempered Elizabeth. \"Of course I do but infants can die Elizabeth. Your own father came to the throne by chance. If his brother had not died, he could have not been King. And wouldn't Anne love to have a sibling. Someone to bond with,\" responded Dudley. \"If you think it must be so it could not happen for awhile yet as I only just had Anne. Leave, leave now and send my ladies in.\" Robert bowed towards her. He didn't want to upset her on the topic but he knew the rumours that her cousin, Mary, was looking for a husband. A husband that could help her deliver a Catholic son. In Edinburgh Castle, Mary, Queen of Scotland, was listening to her lords. They did not like the news of a child being born the Queen of England. \"Your majesty, maybe it would be wise to get rid of the child in some way,\" cried out of the lords. Mary could not do that to an innocent child. It had done nothing to truly offend her. It was but a baby, \"I will not have the murder of an innocent baby on my hands.\" \"Your majesty, there is but one other option. The Queen of England must never have a son. We could have people poison the baby every time she conceives. And if you have a son, soon, we could create an alliance with her through the Princess Anne. If you could not be Queen of England, maybe a son of yours could be King of England, jointly ruling with the Princess.\" Mary liked the idea but how was she to have a son; she was not even married any more. \"My lords, we must pray for the Queen to have a healthy son.\" All the lords laughed at Mary's remark. Not only was she now having a go at Elizabeth but she was being deadly serious about herself. 20 th Aug 1562 Elizabeth was in a happy mood. She was off to see her daughter, with her husband, for the first time since the Princess was born. She was now three months old and changes from her last visit must be recognisable. They each rode by horse to Hatfield and arrived swiftly. Elizabeth was off her horse first and hurried into the castle doors with Dudley trying to keep up with her quick pace. Lady Mary Knollys was there to great their majesties at the door. She nodded towards them both. \"Your majesties, your daughter is through this way if you please.\" Elizabeth followed Lady Knollys through the hallways that she had once called home. As she entered a large room down the end of the corridor, she finally saw her beloved princess being held by one of the wet nurses. Elizabeth had been given daily reports of her progress but that was nothing like seeing her daughter. Elizabeth walked forward and the wet nurse reluctantly handed the baby over to Elizabeth as she sat down. Elizabeth looked down at her daughter, who had now grown little bits of dark brown hair on the top of her head. Elizabeth knew that her daughter would be a beauty, an almost exotic beauty like her own mother, Anne Boleyn. Elizabeth looked up towards Lady Knollys. \"Does she feed well?\" asked Elizabeth. \"She is good in every way, your majesty and hardly cries at all, as if she already knows she is a princess,\" replied Lady Knollys, who was already fond of her little charge. Elizabeth smiled down at Anne who was busily trying to get a hold of her mother's small gold-chain necklace. \"I love you Anne. I love you with all my heart and I bid you never forget it.\" \"Your majesty,\" said one of the wet nurses. \"It is routine that the princess should be fed right now.\" Elizabeth nodded in response. She handed her daughter back over to the wet nurse and looked up at Robert who had been watching the moving scene unfold. \"Do not worry darling. She will be back in your arms once she is fed. It is good for her to be in routine.\" Elizabeth nodded but it was hard to be separated from her daughter, her only child. She was not sure that having more children was for the best but she knew that it was probably better in the line of succession. Especially, if the rumours were true, Mary, her cousin and Queen of Scots, was trying to usurp her position as Queen of England. AN: I hoped you liked that chapter. I was glad to enter Mary, Queen of Scots, into the fold of the story. Her story will be more important in later story lines that I have in my head. Anyway, thank you for the reviews. It means a lot to have people reading the story. Please review again. TBC[Chapter 4] AN: Here is another chapter of 'Consort of Gloriana'. I am really excited that people do like Princess Anne, hopefully you will when she is older as well. Also Mary Queen of Scots character should get interesting from here on out. Please enjoy the next chapter. DISCLAIMER: I do not own the Elizabeth movies or the Tudors. They belong to their respective owners. Chapter Three 20th Dec 1562 Christmas time was about to come to the court who were residing at Whitehall Palace. Today was one of the special days on the calendar, more so for Elizabeth and Robert, as the little Princess Anne was coming to court. It would be the first time since Anne's birth that she would be back at court and all the courtiers wondered what she would look like. Elizabeth and Robert would be the first ones to greet Princess Anne when she came to court. They were waiting in Elizabeth's presence room when a gentlemen servant opened the door. \"Lady Mary Knollys and the Princess Anne, your majesties.\" Elizabeth rose from her seat but Dudley stayed still. Lady Knollys came in holding the now bigger Princess Anne. Elizabeth couldn't believe that seven months had passed since the birth of her daughter and heir. \"Your majesties,\" nodded Lady Knollys, not wanting to curtsy in case of dropping her little charge. Elizabeth motioned for Anne to be placed in her arms. Lady Knollys handed over the princess to her mother. Elizabeth hugged her daughter tightly, she was bigger than the last time they had seen each other and was always growing out of the clothes that had been sent for her. This time she was wearing a green dress, the Tudor green, with gold detailing. Elizabeth sat down and nursed the Princess on her lap. Lady Knollys excused herself and let the family have a few moments together. Robert brushed the top of his daughter's head which was now covered in small brown curls. Anne looked up her mother and smiled. It seemed already that these two had a bond, a bond that Robert couldn't interrupt. Anne opened her mouth a little and spoke a quiet whisper, \"Mama.\" Elizabeth and Robert looked at each other. They were puzzled. Had she said what they thought she said? Maybe this was the Princess's first word as in Lady Knollys daily report there had been no news of the Princess speaking. Elizabeth couldn't contain her excitement that the first words her daughter spoke were for her. 25th Dec 1562 Festivities on Christmas Day at Whitehall were now in full swing. The royal family were sitting on thrones at the far end of the great hall were dancing and merriment was happening after a joust earlier in the day and a feats just before hand. Elizabeth was nursing Anne of her lap. Anne happily clapped along to the music and made little giggling sounds to the amusement of the courtiers who all were all making comments at how charismatic the Queen's daughter already was. Soon the dancing ended and it was time for the courtiers to give their gifts to their majesties and the princess. The Ambassador for Scotland came forward first, \"Your majesties and your highness,\" said the Ambassador. \"My Queen, Mary, sends her warm wishes this Christmas.\" Elizabeth and Robert nodded in response. \"Her majesty would like to give a gift to the Princess Anne, with their majesties approval.\" Elizabeth deemed it fit for the gift to be given to Anne. It was a beautiful doll dressed in a fine silk dress. Anne clapped her hands in response and the doll was given to her. \"Tell my cousin, your Queen, that the gift is most appreciated by the Princess and by us.\" The ambassador bowed and walked away. Other courtiers came and went and before long it was time for the Princess to retire. Robert turned to his Queen, his wife, Elizabeth. \"Would you care for a dance?\" Elizabeth smiled in response and they got up for a dance. The court was in the middle of partner dancing when they joined in. After their dance, Elizabeth pulled Robert into a small side corridor. \"I have a very special gift for you,\" said Elizabeth in a joyous tone. Robert looked at her curiously. What gift? \"Robin, I am with child again.\" Elizabeth was smiling. If this was a son, a male heir, Robert would be ecstatic. Of course it could be a daughter. If it was a girl it would be just as loved as Anne was. Elizabeth knew that there was nothing wrong with a daughter. There was only one person to here of the exciting news for the Queen and King Consort of England, the Ambassador for Scotland. Once his Queen knew, the plans could be taken into action. 26 th Dec 1562 Elizabeth and her ladies were playing with the Princess Anne and her dolls. The only word she could still say was 'Mama' which made Elizabeth proud but she could tell that Anne knew some of the other ladies, such as Kat Ashley and Catherine Knollys. Anne could sit up by herself now but she was still too young to walk. Elizabeth hoped that her next child would love her as much as it seemed the little Princess Anne does. Kat and Catherine were both excited of the prospect of a new royal child, hopefully a prince. This, of course, they would not know for another eight months yet, but they all still hoped for the safe deliverance of one. At the moment though, Elizabeth just wanted to spend as much time as she could with Anne. She knew the dangers of child birth, she didn't want to think that it could happen to her but the possibility was always there. At the moment she was content with her daughter, her husband and the unborn child that would soon be born. The Ambassador for Scotland made it back to Edinburgh Castle in record time to tell his Queen that the English Queen was with child yet again. The ambassador was quickly welcomed into Queen Mary's throne room, were she was discussing a few things with her Lords and her private secretary, David Rizzio. \"Ambassador, you have just celebrated Christmas at the English court. Did the Princess Anne enjoy her gift?\" asked Queen Mary. \"The Princess was most delighted with your gift. She did not put it down all night. Queen Elizabeth sends you, her cousin, joy for the new year and thanks for your gift towards their beloved Princess,\" replied the ambassador. \"That is good for one day, if I marry and have a son soon, this Princess could be the next Queen of Scotland and of course of England. Tell me, is there any other news from the English court worth of me knowing about.\" \"Your Majesty,\" said the ambassador in a careful tone. \"Her majesty, Queen Elizabeth is expecting again. I heard it in close conversation with her husband, the King Consort. They are both in belief that this will be a son and an heir to her crown.\" Mary face went from happy from the news of Princess Anne to an almost outrage that there could be another heir. \"How could this happen?\" screamed Mary. \"Your majesty,\" spoke up Rizzio in his heavy Italian accent. \"There would come a time when the Queen would become pregnant again. It is expected of a Queen, especially one that is married to deliver children.\" \"Ambassador, do you know how far my cousin is in her pregnancy?\" asked Mary. \"Your majesty, it is probably no more than a month as she is not showing at all and has only truly found out herself.\" Mary turned her face towards the Lords that were know standing against the wall, trying to be as far as they could from her as her anger builded up. \"Well my lords, should we act about this topic as we last discussed?\" asked Mary as her lord's advice were as valuable to her as anyone's advice. They all nodded in response. A man of the Catholic faith would soon be sent out to do the dirty work of the Queen of Scotland. Robert and Elizabeth were sitting down in Elizabeth's chambers having dinner together as their daughter slept down the hallway in her nursery designed for her stay at Whitehall. Robert had something to ask Elizabeth. He didn't like the fact that he would have to ask her for her approval, he was the man after all but he could not make his own mind up about this fact, what he had to ask had to be decided by the Queen Regent herself. \"My beautiful Queen,\" said Robert. Elizabeth looked up at him curiously. He always said charming things to her when he wanted something. \"Bess, I would like to discuss the matter of my title, King Consort.\" Elizabeth stood up and rolled her eyes at Dudley. \"Robin can't you be pleased with what you have?\" asked the annoyed and tired Elizabeth. \"Why must you always want more?\" \"Elizabeth, the people may have concerns that with my title that I can be easily replaced,\" said Robin. He soon realised that he had said the wrong thing. \"Robert Dudley, don't you forget that you can be easily replaced. For you see here that I am the master in this relationship, not the other way around. Don't you worry your head about such matters. You know that you will be given no higher especially considering the death of your first wife.\" Elizabeth stormed out of the rooms. Her temper was getting the better of her. She headed down to where Anne was sleeping. Anne was always the calming presence in her life nowadays. Queen Mary was talking to her ambassador in private. She didn't know how to tell him this. She just couldn't go through with it. She couldn't hurt an innocent child. \"Ambassador, please, whatever was said earlier with my lords, ignore it. I do not want you to poison the child in my cousin's womb. It is not right, it is innocent and the child has done nothing to offend me nor truly has the Queen.\" It was almost as if she was pleading with the ambassador, something a Queen should never do. \"My queen,\" bowing to Mary, obviously agreeing to what she had said. She would not trouble the Queen, and if God was good to her, Elizabeth would just have another daughter. Elizabeth had another gift for her princess, a small locket with a portrait of her inside. She never wanted her daughter to forget her. Elizabeth had also commissioned one for her to be made with a portrait of Anne, which was painted a few days ago during one of Anne's more stubborn moments. Anne looked at the locket and opened it. \"Mama?\" asked the little one pointing towards the portrait. \"Yes my darling,\" she said while kissing the top of her tiny head. \"That is me. Keep this locket with you always. It is a way of always remembering me.\" Anne smiled up at her mother. She didn't quite understand what she had said but she was glad in a way to always have her mother with her. 31st Dec 1562 New Year's Eve had finally come and there was a joust to celebrate during the day. Elizabeth decided she would attend but would not take Anne with her. Anne would come when she was older and she was sure that her daughter would be asked for her favour by many courtiers. Her husband, Robert Dudley was to joust today. It made Elizabeth a tiny bit nervous but she could not speak to him since that night that they quarrelled over such a trivial matter. They were both too stubborn for their own good. The caller soon announced that the King Consort was now on the lists. Elizabeth looked up and saw her husband walking gallantly on his black horse towards her. \"My lady,\" said Robert. There was nothing else to say. Elizabeth stood up and placed her favour, which was green trimmed with gold thread, around the top his lance. They both nodded to each other and then Elizabeth sat back down in the stands and Robert fixed his lance ready to compete. \"The King Consort challenges the Duke of Norfolk,\" announced the caller. Robert was to challenge Elizabeth's cousin, Thomas Howard. She was going to support her husband no matter what, especially since he had her favours on his lance. The flag soon went down for the two men to compete. Robert easily unhorsed Norfolk, most likely so he did not displease the Queen. She clapped for her husband and he nodded to her. She hoped that he would soon oversee his stubbornness and come back to her and apologise, at least for the sake of their daughter and unborn child. AN: I hoped you liked that. I hope Mary doesn't seem that mean. I am thinking of having a little less Anne in the next chapter; tell me what you think in the reviews. Thank you to all that read my story and to those who review every chapter. It is well appreciated. TBC[Chapter 5] AN: Yes, another chapter of 'Consort of Gloriana' already. Little Anne has been getting rave reviews from the readers! Yay, for me but I will have a bit less of her so all little Anne fans, I am sorry (don't worry there is plenty to keep you satisfied) but this chapter has been in my mind since I started writing the story so I hope you do enjoy, to some degree (what do I mean by this? Well, you will just have to read the chapter won't you). By the end you may hate some characters. Well I'll let you start reading. (It will probably be way longer than any chapter on any story that I have written so brace yourselves.) DISCLAIMER: I do not own 'The Tudors' or the Elizabeth movies as they belong to their respective owners. I do not own history either. Chapter Four 16 th April 1563 The King Consort was to visit his daughter on his own as his wife did not want to harm their unborn child in any way. He was to visit his daughter while he was on progress to some of the Lords and Ladies that lived out this way. He was soon riding up the long, gardened pathway that led up to Hatfield Palace, the place where his daughter, the Princess Anne, resided and were he had met his wife and his daughter's mother many years ago. From the far away distance he was to the house, everything looked in order, which he was sure a household of Princess of the Tudor blood should. He had missed his daughter. He could not believe that it was almost one month to her birthday. Time had flown by for the parents and with another on the way; he was the proudest father in all of England. Robert and his small entourage rode into the stable yard of Hatfield Palace and were soon off their horses and the reigns passed to the three stable boys that worked at the palace. Robert walked quickly through the doors of the building and up to where his daughter was residing. He nodded to the servants that he passed on his way but he had only one intention of being here, it was to see his little Princess. \"Ah,\" said Robert as he found the lady he was looking for, his daughter's governess, Lady Mary Knollys. \"Lady Knollys, a very good morning to you.\" \"Your majesty,\" replied Lady Knollys, who was always willing to be the able servant of their majesties. She was honoured to call herself first cousins with the Queen and she was honoured when she was chosen to be governess to the Princess almost a year to the day. \"I'm on progress,\" continued the ever charming Dudley. \"I've come to see my daughter. How is she?\" asked Robert with the concern that every royal father had about his own daughter, his wife's heir, his own flesh and blood. \"Princess Anne is a credit to your majesty in every way,\" replied the ever keen to please Lady Knollys. Of course, she knew that the parents already knew this; Elizabeth required that a letter be sent from Lady Knollys everyday reporting on her progress. Robert simply smiled at this. He loved hearing praise about his daughter. A wet nurse hired by their majesties, came over with the Princess Anne on her hip. She had defiantly grown which made all the dresses the Privy Purse had to pay for made sense. Anyway, Elizabeth would never want to see Anne dressed in anything but the best. The wet nurse reluctantly handed the eleven-month-old princess over to her father. Robert gently carried his daughter. \"Papa, Papa!\" cried out the little girl in joy. She had learned quite a few new words since her visit to court during the Christmas festivities. \"Yes, is this truly my little girl?\" asked the father at the annoyance of his daughter. Anne gave him a stare that would last a life time, she was already way to much like her mother. \"I am sorry darling but I don't have that much time,\" said Robert to the disappointment of his daughter. Her expression was that of a spoilt, sulky child, which she could probably be described as. \"Do not worry though. Your birthday is within the coming month and the whole court would like to celebrate your birthday. How would you like to come to court?\" His daughter nodded her head enthusiastically, making her brown curls bob up and down furiously. After a few more minutes of talking with his beloved daughter, it was time for him to leave. He didn't like to leave his daughter but he had no choice, he had to continue on his short progress. Lady Knollys was glad that her father had paid visit on the household but was happy to see him leave as to get the Princess back into routine. Unfortunately for Lady Knollys though, she had to calm down the Princess after almost an hour of crying. The child dearly wished that she could forever live with her parents. Elizabeth was trying to pass the time carefully like her doctors had asked her too. Last month, her pregnancy took a backward step when she had pains shooting through her stomach. The physician asked her to stay in bed but she ignored them. She was stubborn like that. She thought that sewing shirts for the poor couldn't aggravate her or her unborn baby. So she was stuck to doing this duty and had to let her husband, her spy master and her number one adviser run the country. Kat Ashley was determined to get Elizabeth to at least have two hours bed rest a day on top of her actual sleeping patterns. Elizabeth was determined to fight back as well and sometimes Kat just felt like giving up but she wanted this child to survive, especially if it was a boy that everyone thought it was going to be. England would be a much more stable place if it was a son. It wasn't that she thought that the Princess Anne couldn't hold the country together if it was necessary it was that she didn't want England to go back to the bloody days of civil war. Catherine Knollys suddenly opened the door to the Queen's bedchambers, which is where Elizabeth was residing. She may not be in bed but she wasn't allowed to leave that room, not until the physician checked over her condition again. \"My lady,\" curtseyed Catherine. \"My daughter, Lettice Knollys has returned to court and requests and audience.\" Elizabeth easily waved for Lettice to come in. Elizabeth was craving new company anyway. \"Your Majesty,\" said Lettice as she curtseyed towards her mistress. Elizabeth held out a hand for Lettice to kiss. After the normal formalities and protocol were finished, Lettice sat down beside the Queen and started talking to her. \"I hear that there were dangers about the safe deliverance of your child last month,\" said Lettice. Elizabeth looked back down at her shirts that she was sewing. Why did everyone have to know her business? Wasn't she allowed any form of privacy? She had learnt to be above reproach when she was younger but now everything she did was of public knowledge, much like when everyone one was spreading rumours about herself and Thomas Seymour, the late Queen Jane's brother. He was dashing and she knew that and he was also one of the most handsome men at court. And of course now, he was uncle to the king. He gained favour from many high places. Unfortunately, he had married Elizabeth's step-mother, the Queen Dowager Catherine Parr. Elizabeth tried to stop thinking about it. It had cause much scandal back in its heyday. The cutting of her black mourning dress and the morning visits from Seymour in her bed chamber when she was not even dressed could cause massive amounts of scandal today if new rumours were to float around. \"It was nothing that I cannot handle,\" smiled Elizabeth at the charming Lettice. \"My ministers, my ladies, my physician and even my own husband just overreacted. It was nothing I assure you. You on the other hand are now a mother are you not?\" Lettice smiled at Elizabeth. \"Yes, my daughter was born early in the last month and my mother is her godmother. Don't worry there will be more and you are sure to be there godmother.\" They both laughed. \"I had a daughter, your majesty, Isabella is her name.\" Elizabeth smiled. Lettice's position and connections to her Queen as well as her daughter's close age to the Princess Anne made Isabella a perfect candidate for a companion to the Princess when it came time for her to be educated. Elizabeth was always thinking of her daughter's future. Mary, Queen of Scotland, was in a difficult position. Her country needed an heir. She wasn't about to let the English take it over, especially when she in turn was trying to take over England. Her own parliamentarians are convincing her to marry, to create an alliance through marriage but maybe she didn't want to. She had done that once before and it ended with her losing her position of Queen Consort of France. She wanted to marry for love. Marry because she wanted to not because someone wants money through her dowry. If her cousin could do so could she. 19 th May 1563 Elizabeth was in astonishment that time could fly by so fast. Her precious little daughter, Anne, was now one year old. She had been brought to court and could walk towards her mother when she entered her mother's presence chamber, which was usual for when the young princess visited court. She couldn't courtesy yet but that was only a matter of time before she accomplished that as well. The princess was wearing a beautiful read gown which had only been recently made and a small white cap trimmed with lace and thread of gold. She looked every inch the princess. \"My princess, my beautiful little girl,\" said Elizabeth as picked up her daughter and kissed her on the cheek. Reaching this age was a milestone and it defiantly proved she was able a having healthy and living children. \"Mama, mama!\" cried Anne out excitedly. \"Do you know what day it is today?\" Elizabeth sat down and placed her daughter on her lap. Elizabeth smiled down at her daughter. She tapped her finger on her tiny button nose and said, \"Every man in the kingdom knows that it is your special day, the day of your birth.\" Elizabeth passed Anne a sweet meat that had been placed on a silver tray beside them. Soon after this special treat, Robert Dudley, walked in. \"Papa!\" cried Anne, who was now swinging her arms around in the air so her father could pick her up and swing her around. He took two steps forward and picked up his little girl and swirled her in the air as she wished. \"My love, I think they have switched our daughter yet again,\" said Robert to obviously annoy the little princess. It had worked. Her little face had crumbled up into a little scowl. Elizabeth laughed. Her daughter could make some of the cutest faces some time. \"Robin, this is her day. Do not try and tease her. It is not very nice.\" Elizabeth laughed as Anne was placed back in her lap. She was soon given presents that were very much to her liking, such as numerous new dolls, a rocking horse, her first hood, for when she is older, and at least twenty new dresses that were all to her liking. This was her special day. Throughout the rest of the day, Anne had many festivities thrown in her honour. There was a time for other courtiers and ambassadors trying to seek favour by giving Anne many gifts. Later on there was a banquet and a joust was also held in honour of the Princess. The princess and her mother did not attend the joust though as Elizabeth and Anne's governess, Lady Knollys, both thought that it was best that Anne was not exposed to something that might excite her. She had plenty of time in the future to watch the jousts. Anne fell asleep in her mother's arms during the festivities that went on in Elizabeth's own chambers which involved her ladies dancing and music playing and drinks for anyone who was invited. The activities of the day had worn the little Princess out, so Elizabeth quietly carried Anne down the hallway and tucked her into her cot. \"I love you Anne, I love you with all my heart and I bid you never forget it,\" whispered Elizabeth to her sleeping daughter. She left after planting a kiss on top of the little girl's head. Elizabeth went back to her chambers and started to prepare for the night ahead. As her ladies finished helping her get ready for bed, Elizabeth noticed one very vital thing. Her husband had been absent for the festivities in her chambers. Where had he gone to? He wasn't even here now, like every other night in their marriage. Where was he? Who was he with and more importantly, what is he doing? 20th May 1563 Queen Elizabeth had woken up, gotten ready and had already checked up on her little Princess. She now saw that it was time to go and question what her husband had been doing last night. She wanted an explanation of why he walked out of the festivities for his own daughter's birthday celebrations and why he wasn't able to share her bed last night. She walked through the corridors, her entourage of ladies trailing behind her and her hands around her stomach, as if a means of protecting it from the outside world. The courtiers all bowed towards and called out 'your majesty' which Elizabeth replied with a simple nod. There was no need to fret about what absent minded courtiers wanted to say. She needed to find her husband. When she reached her husband's bedroom doors, there was a guard waiting outside. The guard bowed towards her, \"Your majesty.\" \"I came to see the king consort,\" said Elizabeth, she said it with a loud voice as to make sure her husband would notice the words coming on from on outside. \"Madame, his majesty is tired right now and is asleep. It would be best if you came back later it would be more convenient for his majesty,\" said the guard reluctantly. He didn't like to lie to his Queen, especially when she was more powerful than her own husband. \"I am sorry but I am here to see the King and it is the King I shall see. If he is tired and asleep I will not trouble him by waking him,\" Elizabeth tried to grab the door handle but the guard got to it first. She stood back and looked him straight in the eye. \"I will not harm you if you have lied because the King is most likely to have paid you a handsome sum to keep you quiet but if I were you, I would tell the truth to the one's than can hurt you more so than the ones that keep you fed.\" The guard stood back and took in the full meaning of what his Queen had said. It was wise advice. Elizabeth stepped forward and reluctantly opened the door. Her entourage of ladies stood back not wanting to be in the full firing line of attack. She opened the door and right in front of her was one of her ladies, Lady Frances, sitting on her husband's lap and kissing him. What was more inconceivable was the fact that the Lady was only in her nightdress and the King in his breeches and night shirt. \"What is this?\" Elizabeth said in a state of shock. She was clutching the doorway for support. \"What is this?\" Lady Frances quickly got up from her position and ran behind the King's chair. Elizabeth slammed the door back in response but it did not shut. She started to move towards Robert and his obvious mistress. \"Just when our baby is doing its business, I see you wenching with Lady Frances.\" Robert turned and looked at Frances. He nodded for her to take the long alley way back to her chambers. He was going to have to deal with his wife alone. He grabbed Elizabeth's shoulders, \"Calm down my love, all is well.\" Elizabeth instinctively pulled away from his grasp. \"No, no,\" she replied. \"Why are you doing this? Wasn't I enough and on our own daughter's birthday. How could you? Why did you have to do this?\" she punched Robert away. She pulled her arm out so that he stayed away and her other arm was clutching around her swollen stomach. \"Ugh,\" she screamed as he grabbed her. He had had mistress before their marriage but during. Elizabeth's heart and mind didn't want to believe it. She couldn't let herself believe it. \"Stop crying Elizabeth, stop,\" that was all Robert could say. What could he say to make her calm down? Elizabeth was tired of the dirty feeling of him holding her. She pushed him away again. \"You don't forget that I was the one who raised you and I can simply drag you back down even further. I could even sign that piece of document that my sister was never able to do,\" she shouted this as to give a stronger emphasis to him. She would give him one last chance. But not now, she couldn't stand the sight of him right now. She ran out of the room with tears streaming down her face. Her ladies followed in hot pursuit and tried their best to comfort their mistress. Another unfortunate incident for the royal couple was that the majority of the court heard what had taken place. Her two principle ladies, Kat Ashley and Catherine Knollys, had been able to calm their mistress down to some extent. They had finally calmed her down enough to sleep so they left their Queen alone while they waited in the outer chamber, sewing more shirts for the poor. All of a sudden, a loud, shrill shriek came from the bedchambers. Kat and Katherine ran into the bedchamber, knocking over some glasses of ale on the way. They came in and they same their Queen clutching between her legs. \"Elizabeth,\" Kat asked, ignoring all protocol. \"What is it?\" Even though it was plain enough to see what was happening. Elizabeth slowly pulled her hands out and they were covered in blood. \"My boy,\" was all she could say. She was about to miscarry her child. No one could stop her wailing. The other ladies that had also come in were covering their hands in disbelief. One of them ran to fetch a physician but they all knew it was too late. Elizabeth started playing around with her blood red night gown and then suddenly clutched between her legs again. She wasn't going to let this baby go without a fight. The ladies were distressed to see their Queen miscarrying the child who she was so desperately trying to keep in. But they all knew it was too late. Robert was told the news by the physician and hurried along to his wife's rooms. He was already blaming it on himself. Why did he have to be so stupid? That was all that he thought. As himself and two of his grooms started to reach his wife's quarters, the sound of wailing coming from the Queen was audible to hear, even through the thick walls. As he reached the room, another physician stopped him outside. \"Could you tell what it was?\" asked Dudley. The physician looked at him with grave eyes. \"A son, your majesty, he would have been a future prince.\" This immediate news socked him. He had cost his son's own life because of some foolish desire for this woman. He felt so stupid some times. He entered the outer room first and the first person he saw was Kat Ashley and the loads of linen that was blood stained. She gave him a cold dark stare of disapproval. That looked unnerved him but the look that unnerved him more was the look of his wife, desperately crying out loud, wanting her son to return. Elizabeth looked up to see the man that had caused her this distress, her husband. \"You have only yourself to blame for this. You and that wench Frances,\" whispered Elizabeth through her tears. \"Elizabeth, I never blamed you. We are young. We will have more children and I promise to be a faithful husband from this day forward.\" He tried to console his wife but as he moved forward she moved back. \"Do you know how distressed I was to see you loved others? It is because the love I bear is so great, I broke my heart to see that you did love others,\" said Elizabeth in another whisper. \"It is best that I leave now, you need your rest.\" Robert began to walk out of the room to the sound of Elizabeth wailing again. He didn't want to leave but she would not let him console her. He knew of nothing else to do. Catherine Knollys had finally calmed the Queen down enough to make her ease back and rest upon the pillows that had been plumped and placed behind her for her comfort. Elizabeth would see no one, not that Kat would let anyone through to see her. The whole court surely knew of what Elizabeth saw as a failure. She felt just like her own mother but at least she knew that she had an upper hand in the battle. It was like history was repeating itself exactly. Was she destined to only have one child? And that is a daughter. Her own mother had been brought down because of it but she would not let them break her down. There was only one person that she truly wanted to see, her Princess, the pearl of her world. Her ladies and Anne's governess were not sure if they should take Anne there, especially after the distress Elizabeth had been through earlier but she was adamant that she would see her daughter. They soon brought the princess to her mother. She was wearing a small dark blue dress and a white cap which hid her beautiful dark brown curls. Anne was placed onto the bed and she crawled up into her mother's arms. \"Don't you worry Anne,\" said Elizabeth through her tiny sobs. \"You shall never be taken away from me. If all else fails you are my princess and you may inherit. I love you with all of my heart, no matter how broken it ever is.\" Little Anne did not understand a lot of the words her mother had said but nerveless she did understand the words, I love you. She loved her mother to, no matter how far away she might be. She loved her mother more than her father no matter how wrong that may be. She never wanted to leave her mother. She wanted to stay at court and maybe, just maybe, her mother wanted that as well. They both went to sleep cuddled next to each other. Anne was there to comfort her mother and no one dared move them from a night of sleep they thought would never come. AN: Okay, don't shoot the writer! It just came out that way. Little Anne fans did get their share though, more than I originally intended. Please Review. If anyone has suggestions for what should happen next in the story please write it in the reviews. Anway please review your thoughts on the chapter. All suggestions would be taken into careful consideration. Don't worry, Mary Stuart fans, her reaction will be first up next chapter. PS: Robert Dudley did have mistresses, I am just highlighting that in my story but at least he feels guilty. Happier times will be ahead in the next chapters. Well, sort of. TBC[Chapter 6] AN: Welcome to a new chapter of Consort of Gloriana. I am surprised that in your reviews I didn't get big reviews of hatred for my cruelty to Elizabeth. Don't worry I am working on redeeming the situation, it may take a few chapters but I will get there. (Also I get to have my Mary Stuart reaction. Sorry I am hoping you will like it.) There will be a time jump within the next chapter so our little Princess Anne will grow up by a couple of years. She will be a precocious three year old. What a joy to write! Well anyone, this one is short but the next one will be longer but it has taken me awhile to get this out to you but I had a bit of writer's block. Disclaimer: I do not own the Elizabeth movies, The Tudors or history. They belong to their respective owners. 22nd May 1563 The Ambassador for Scotland rode into the stable yard of Edinburgh Castle. He had urgent news to tell his Queen, news that would make her the happiest Queen in Christendom. This was news that could make him even richer. He quickly handed the leads of his horse to the young stable boy and quickly hurried through all the hallways of the castle to the throne room, which was were Queen Mary would be at this time of the day. The ambassador entered the room bowing deep towards her majesty. She looked towards him and nodded. He was supposed to be in England at this time. It must be urgent news, so urgent that he had to deliver the news in person. Mary stood up and walked over to the ambassador. \"Ambassador,\" Mary said in her heavy Scottish accent. \"What brings you here? Do you have news of my cousin?\" \"Madame, there is news,\" said the Ambassador. \"Your cousin, Elizabeth, has miscarried her child and it had the appearance of a male.\" The ambassador had to smile. He knew that Mary's plan was working and all she had to do was fill her end of the bargain, by having a son. Mary had to smile to. She knew exactly what her ambassador was thinking. It was hard not to. She was closer to the throne and when the time came that God permitted her a son, she would make plans to unite there two families. \"Ambassador, I am sorry to hear of my cousin's most unfortunate news but just between you and me, I believe that this was the Lord's work.\" They both smiled at each other. The plan for a Scottish and English alliance looked more than likely. Little Princess Anne didn't quite understand what was going on at court. She didn't understand why her parents were not talking and why the courtiers looked so sombre. Even though she was only one, she was able to observe things and take them in. She could tell the court wasn't like it usually was. For Anne though, the biggest confusion was that her mother's belly had gone down but yet there was no baby around. She heard people say that her mother lost the baby but were could someone lose a baby. Babies would cry soon enough and they would be found. Anne decided that she would let the topic go as her mother was sure to get upset. She didn't like to see her mother cry. Anne continued to get visits in her nursery apartments from both of her parents but they would not come at the same time as they used to. Lady Knollys, who was upset for her own cousin's miscarriage, continued to take care of the Princess as if nothing was wrong. She had heard people say that Anne would be the only heir and that England would have another Queen after her mother. Lady Knollys prayed that Elizabeth would have a healthy son. It was not that she didn't want to see Anne as Queen of England. It was more so that Elizabeth could prove to all of the courtiers, who said that she would be just as useless as her mother, Anne Boleyn, was at delivering a son, that they were wrong. These courtiers had even tried to gain audiences with the little Princess so that they could coax their way into her friendship so that their descendants would live prosperously under her reign. Lady Knollys of course refused. She wasn't going to let those courtiers win son easily. Her thoughts were quickly stopped at the opening of the door. One of the ladies who were assigned to the Princess Anne came in. \"My lady, the King Consort is here to see the Princess.\" Lady Knollys nodded towards the girl. The girl was pretty enough but Lady Knollys knew that the girl would prefer to serve the Queen but the girl also knew that this was a highly respectable position for a girl of noble birth. Nerveless, Lady Knollys welcomed the King Consort when he entered the room. \"Your Majesty,\" said Lady Knollys as she bobbed a curtsey. \"Lady Knollys, I have come to see my daughter,\" said Robert. The expression on his face was sombre. He was still hurting from the loss of his son and more so because the fate of his son was caused by his careless actions. His face lit up though when he saw his precious daughter, the pearl of his world. \"Papa, papa!\" cried out the little girl, waving with her tiny little palm as she saw her father. \"Papa, papa.\" Robert took a few strides over and picked his daughter up from her position within all of her dolls. He smiled at his daughter. She definitely took after her mother's side in the looks department, especially that of her grandmother, Anne Boleyn. He put one of his hands to the back of Anne's head and planted a kiss on the girl's little forehead. Anne just smiled, deep down though she wished that her parents would reconcile. Kat Ashley couldn't get her mistress to do anything. The only thing that she could do was insist that the Princess Anne was calling for her mother. Even if she truly wasn't, Kat would say this so that Elizabeth would get out of her chambers. That was the only place she would go. She wouldn't talk to her husband, not that Kat blamed her, she wouldn't speak to anyone besides her closest ladies and anyone that had anything to do with her beloved daughter and she wouldn't even step a foot outside. Kat knew that it was best to have the Queen breathe in fresh air but Elizabeth would hear nothing of it. Elizabeth felt like a failure. She felt like she had let her people down by not giving them a male heir. \"Kat,\" called out Elizabeth in a weak voice. \"Would you please send word for my daughter to be brought to me.\" Elizabeth wanted; no she needed to see her daughter, her most precious jewel. Kat didn't want to tell her but she thought it was for her own good. \"Madame, Bess, I don't think it is wise to make your daughter your rock. She is only an innocent child. She needs to be happy and see her parents happy otherwise she will grow up being one sad little girl and then a sad women.\" Elizabeth looked directly into Kat's eyes. She didn't like the fact that she was being contradicted but she knew she was right. \"Well Kat, what do you suppose I do? If you don't think it is wise to see my own daughter than what do you think I should do?\" Kat looked down. She knew the answer would upset Bess. \"I think you should reconcile with your husband. If you want an heir, a male heir, you should think of reconciliation as soon as you can.\" Elizabeth knew that she was right but she couldn't. Not now, not after everything that he had put her through since their daughter's birthday. She couldn't. \"Kat, I can't right now, maybe later. I might take a stroll in the gardens though.\" Kat smiled. At least Elizabeth was doing something, anything to getting her to be her happy self again. Elizabeth was taking a stroll around the gardens all by herself. She needed time to think. She remembered this place. It was the last place that she saw her mother and her father together, even if it was for unhappy circumstances. Anne was holding on to Elizabeth tightly as she ran up the small stone steps. She needed to speak to Henry. Elizabeth was her bargaining tool, she knew that she loved her daughter and so did Henry so he must take it in his heart not to hurt her or do anything to hurt her. \" Henry,\" pleaded Anne as she saw her husband. Henry gave Anne a cold hard look up and down from her messed up hair to the edges of her skirt that had been dragged through the mud. \"Please. Henry please. For the love you bear our child, for the love of Elizabeth, have mercy,\" cried out Anne as she followed Henry while trying to keep a grip on Bess. \" You lied to me. You always lied to me,\" yelled back a furious Henry. Anne was distressed at the words. How could he say such a thing? \"No\". \" You were not a virgin when you married me. You were not what you seemed. You father and your brother arranged everything,\" yelled Henry, fury running through the way he looked at her and their child. \" No,\" Anne cried out again. \"I loved you. I loved you and I love you still. Please, after everything we've been to each other. After everything we were, please.\" Henry tried to walk away from a pleading Anne who now stood in front of him. She just ran further ahead up the steps. \"One more chance, one more,\" pleaded Anne. Henry was not having it and pushed Anne away again. Anne looked on as her husband walked away from her and further up the path. \"Your majesty, your majesty I beseech you.\" Henry didn't even turn around. He just kept on walking. Tears started to form in her eyes as she clutched to Elizabeth. She hugged her daughter tightly and her daughter did the same. She knelt to the ground. She couldn't believe this was happening. How was her world falling apart so abruptly? She remembered never understanding what went on between the two of them but know, after hearing all the stories about her mother, she happened to understand everything. She had vowed to never have a man hurt her like her father had done to her mother but yet it still happened. Elizabeth walked along the path that her father had walked along many years ago. There was a little park at the end of pathway and she liked to go and sit down there sometimes and maybe read a book or maybe just relax in the sunshine. She stopped before she entered the garden. She had to smile. There before her where Robert and Anne playing with a small cloth ball. Anne didn't quite have the skills yet to catch the ball but Robert was trying to teach Anne as best as he could. If he couldn't teach his son he was sure to teach his own daughter. As Robert picked up the small ball that Anne threw towards his feet, he noticed someone standing, observing what they were doing. It was Elizabeth. \"Your majesty,\" bowed Robert and Elizabeth nodded in acknowledgement. \"Mama, mama,\" cried Anne as she saw her mother. Anne ran over to her mother and Elizabeth bent down to hug her little girl. She embraced her just as her mother had embraced her on the last meeting together, even if it was in different circumstances. Robert and Elizabeth smiled at each other. They knew that one's heart needed to heal and the other person needed to be patient but in time they were sure to live in bliss once more. AN: See I told you it was short, but anyway, next chapter will be longer and a lot more interesting. I will be on holidays soon so the next chapter may the last for a few days. Don't worry, I will write while I am away and then you will get a few chapters so it should all be good. Please review TBC[Chapter 7] AN: Welcome back to another chapter of 'Consort of Gloriana'. I wanted to post this for you before I go on holiday. Again, I want to thank you all for the reviews for this story. It is really appreciated. Also, yes there is a time jump within this chapter. Anyway, on with the story. Disclaimer: I do not own the Tudors, Elizabeth movies or history as they belong to whom they belong to. Chapter Six 1 st January 1565 The Princess Anne stood waiting for her time to be called into court. She may only be two and seven months old but she had a sense of being older, even at this young age. Suddenly two taps where hit with the herald's stick onto the floor. \"Her highness, the Princess Anne,\" cried out the herald. Elizabeth sat up as straight as far as she could, considering that she was eight months with child, and squeezed Robert's hand. They had both missed their daughter and since Anne did not attend the Christmas celebrations but she was here now for the celebrations for the New Year. Anne came walking out gracefully on her small legs. Her dark brown hair was pinned back underneath a dark red French hood and she had the same colour dress on. She stood before her parents. \"Your majesties,\" said Anne in her small but strong voice. She had the confidence of a Princess of England. Robert stood up and raised his daughter up from her bow. \"My daughter,\" said the proud father. Anne smiled at him. \"Papa,\" cried the little girl and the whole court laughed. Robert picked up his daughter and placed her on his knee. Elizabeth looked at the two sitting beside her. She placed her hand on her swollen stomach. Soon her family would be complete with the arrival of her son. Later on in the evening, Elizabeth and Robert retired to the Queen's rooms and summoned the Princess. Elizabeth kept looking longingly at the door and then it opened and the Princess, ignoring all protocol, ran up to her parents. \"Mama, am I to receive any more gifts for this Christmas?\" asked the precocious little girl. Robert looked at his little girl. \"Anne, you were given gifts already this Christmas. What more could you possibly want?\" He knew that spoiling a child was not good but they had done it since her birth. Hopefully, with the birth of a son, things would be different for Anne and she would learn to share but somehow he truly doubted it. Elizabeth on the hand didn't see it as a problem. She wanted to have anything she wanted. \"There is something I did want to see if you would like,\" said Elizabeth. Anne nodded in agreement, not even asking what it was. \"Would you like to have your own tutor?\" asked Elizabeth. Anne suddenly had a puzzled look on her face. \"Mama what is a tutor?\" asked the little one. \"You know how Lady Knollys has been teaching you how to read and write a few words. This person would teach you more and you would also have some other children to play with as they would be learning with you.\" Anne smiled. \"I like the learning but I want friends Mama so I will gladly have a tutor.\" The two parents laughed. They were astonished by how far their little girl had come so far and were sure that she would surely be quite bright after being taught by a man of a higher education. For all they knew, this girl could rule as a Queen over another empire and she must be prepared. 3 rd January 1565 Kat Ashley felt her age getting to her but it didn't matter. She wanted her Queen to be comfortable. She remembered how much Elizabeth hated the period of lying in, so she wanted her to be as comfortable as possible. The physician was checking the room to make sure everything is in order. Elizabeth just wanted to be alone. Why does everyone poke around into her business? Kat walked up to Elizabeth and placed a hand on the Queen's shoulder. \"Elizabeth you must lie down now. It is best for your condition that you do so. The physician has asked for you do so.\" \"Why must I? I am Queen, can't I do as I wish,\" Elizabeth said as tears started to roll down her cheeks. Kat leaded her to the bed and helped her lie down. \"You are only tired, my lady. If you sleep you will think about this in a whole new light,\" Kat said. Elizabeth smile at her and was soon asleep. It was late in the evening and Elizabeth's ladies had been reading or sewing as their Queen slept. The all waited in the chamber outside of the birthing chamber. Kat, as First Lady of the Bed Chamber, was about to dismiss all the ladies when they heard the screeching scream of their mistress. 4 th January 1565 Elizabeth was screaming. She was in pain and it was too early. Her child, her son, was coming too early. It was 3 am in the morning and Elizabeth had been in labour for five hours. Her ladies were running in and out of the Queen's rooms. They brought back towels; they sent messages and brought more water to the Queen's chambers. Robert was summoned pretty much after the labour started. He wished to be in there with her but no one would allow it so he was left to pace up and down the hallway. Catherine Knollys opened the door. Robert looked at her but she just shook her head as she walked passed obviously getting something to help with the delivery of the child. Time passed and all Elizabeth could do was scream. Kat Ashley wiped a wet cloth over her brow hoping to relieve some of the pain but it could only do so much. The midwives were in distress over what to do. They knew that they should wait it out for at least another hour but the Queen was in more distress that ever. Time kept on passing and it was now 10 am in the morning. One of the midwives came out with a miserable look on her face. \"Your majesty,\" said the midwife. \"As you know her majesty has been in labour for twelve hours. We fear that she will die if we do not kill the child or we have to cut open her majesty and it most inevitable that she herself will die.\" Robert's face went a paler shade of white than anyone could possibly go. He didn't say anything he just walked away to his room. He needed time to think this through. The midwife called after him. \"Your majesty, your majesty.\" But he didn't listen. He needed to think. The ladies had no idea what to do. Elizabeth had gone tired and almost limp but she wasn't giving up. She wasn't going to let either of them die. They both had a reason to live. Suddenly, a bigger pain than before came. The midwife suddenly went back to the position she was supposed to be in. \"My lady, would you mind pushing again?\" asked the woman, scared that the Queen was going to bite her head off. Elizabeth nodded. She wasn't giving up. The midwife looked up smiling. \"Bless the lord, the head is crowning,\" cried out the midwife in joy. As with the last birth, Kat was on one side of Elizabeth and Catherine Knollys was on the other. \"Just a few more pushes my lady,\" said Catherine. Elizabeth pushed her know weak body. She needed this child out of her. She pushed again, squeezing her ladies hands tighter. Elizabeth became limp as the baby was released from her body. At the moment she didn't even care what it was, she just wanted to sleep. Elizabeth became drowsy but before she went off to sleep she heard the midwife say, \"Your majesty has given birth to a healthy girl.\" Kat Ashley went to the King Consort's chambers. He sat there still motionless from the conversation he had had with midwife. At a knock on the door he turned around. In came one of his gentlemen. \"My lord, Kat Ashley.\" Robert went to the door as Kat walked in. She bobbed a curtsey. She had a relieved look on her face. Not one of sorrow but not one of great happiness either. \"What has happened?\" asked Robert. \"Your wife, the Queen, has given birth to a healthy.....princess,\" said Kat. Robert smiled. He did not care of what the gender was. There was still plenty of time for them to have more children. He walked passed Kat and hurried along to Elizabeth's chambers. Kat was trying to keep her old body up with the pace of His Majesty. He burst through the doors to Elizabeth's room. Lady Catherine Knollys was there standing at the door. \"Your majesty,\" said Catherine as she bobbed a curtsey. \"Her majesty is asleep at the moment and wishes to not be disturbed. If you wish to see your daughter, I am sure that can be arranged.\" Robert nodded. He didn't wish to disturb his wife. He sat down and as soon as he did a wet nurse came out holding a tiny little infant in her arms. The wet nurse handed her gently to her father. The little girl was smaller than what Anne had been when she was born. The little girl also looked almost opposite to her older sister Anne. The little infant in his arms had light, blonde hair, just like his own mother had, and she had pale skin, unlike her sister who had a bit darker complexion, but they both had one thing in common, their beautiful dark brown eyes, they were the same as Elizabeth's and the same as Elizabeth' mother, Anne Boleyn. \"Kat,\" called Robert. \"Can you please bring the Princess Anne here. I am sure she would love to see her baby sister.\" Kat curtseyed and left to go and get the elder of the sisters. She was soon back with Lady Mary Knollys and the Princess Anne in tow. Anne came across and looked at the child. \"Papa, mama said that it would be a baby brother but instead I was told I have a baby sister. Why did she lie Papa?\" Robert looked at his daughter who was staring at him with curious eyes. \"Annie, we do not know what the baby will be until it is born. Your mother thought it was going to be a boy but it was a girl. Anyway, this can be your new friend.\" Anne nodded. She sat on the chair next to her father's and looked over at the little girl. \"She is pretty. She has my eyes papa. Isn't she too small to be my friend at the moment?\" asked Anne. Robert nodded. \"In time Anne, she will live with you and then you will learn together when she is older.\" They both smiled at each other and Anne couldn't wait to play with her new baby sister. Elizabeth could hear the conversation going on in the chamber outside. She could hear it through the silent tear that had fallen down her face. She felt that she had failed England by not giving them a son and she knew she was able to have more children but after that last labour she didn't know if she truly wanted to. She knew that she loved Anne but this little girl. She wanted to love her. She was her own flesh and blood but it seemed that the infant's position in her heart was hollow, numb. She hoped that in time that she could bond with the little infant. In time. AN: Sorry for the story being short again. Anyway, I will be on holidays for about four days but when I come back I will have another chapter and some other stories written for you. Thank you to all the new and old reviewers as well. It means a lot to me. Please review this chapter as well. TBC[Chapter 8] AN: Welcome back to 'Consort of Gloriana'. I am back from my holidays and I decided to start writing this as soon as I returned. Don't worry little Princess Anne and the new princess are both there and I also intend that this chapter will be longer than the last two as they were quite short. Anyway I hope you enjoy this chapter. PS: I also want to thank ReganX who gave me an excellent list of suitors for the hands of the Princesses. PPS: I also want to mention that following chapters and this one will be heavily inspired by the miniseries- The Virgin Queen. (That is how I think Bess & Robert look). DISCLAIMER: I do not own the Elizabeth Movies, The Virgin Queen, The Tudors or History. They each belong to their respective owners. I have full knowledge that history was different. Chapter Seven 7 th January 1565 The Princess Kathryn's christening had gone off without a hitch. This princess had a less grand christening than the Princess Anne but it was all done correctly. One thing that was different between the two was that Kathryn had a royal godmother, unlike spoilt little Anne who's godmother was Kat Ashley, who Elizabeth thought was a much better person that Kathryn's godmother, Mary, Queen of Scotland. Mary, Queen of Scotland, sent down many gifts for her new goddaughter, Princess Kathryn of England. She had heard rumours that Kathryn was not granted as many privileges as Princess Anne had and Mary felt sorry for the child. There were also rumours that Elizabeth hardly saw her daughter unlike when Anne was born. Mary also saw Kathryn for a better candidate for marriage when the time came for God to grant her a husband and a son. She felt that would be sooner rather than later and she was thankful. Mary smiled towards the ambassador. \"Where my gifts received at the English court for the new princess?\" asked Mary. The ambassador looked tentative to answer. \"My lady, the King Consort sends his warmest regards and thanks for the gifts that you bestowed on your goddaughter.\" Mary noticed the lack of one certain person's name. \"What of the Queen, my cousin, did she send thanks for the gifts?\" The ambassador put on a fake smile that Mary saw right through. \"My lady, she did as she has not visited the Princess while I was there. To be frank, my lady, the King Consort visits the new Princess every day and is already a doting father. Her sister, the Princess Anne, even comes and visits her and even bought her a new doll but the Queen herself had only seen the Princess once, during the christening procedure.\" Mary traced her lips with her finger. So the rumours were true. Mary placed her hand out for the ambassador to kiss. \"Well, let's hope that I soon marry and have a prince because I frankly would love to raise her in the Scottish court as the future Queen of Scotland just as I was brought up in France.\" 1 st February 1565 Lettice Knollys ran through the hallways around the tennis arena. She was trying to run passed two of the King Consort's jesters who were doing back flips all the way down the hall. Lettice pushed open the door that leads onto the room where the tennis was being played. She noticed that the King Consort was playing and a smile came to her lips. Forgetting for a moment of what she was supposed to be doing, she ran to her seat next to Kat Ashley. She was out of breath by the time she sat down. Robert Dudley was playing against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Howard, who just happened to be the Queen's cousin. He was always trying to advance himself and his family but the Queen usually had none of it. Elizabeth looked on with her councillors on one side of her and her daughter Anne with her ladies on the other side. Everyone clapped as the King Consort won points. Everyone was sure that he was surely to win. Robert looked towards Elizabeth and she smile back at him. She was glad to finally be out of the birthing chamber. Suddenly, Robert hit the winning point and everyone clapped enthusiastically. \"Bravo,\" yelled out Elizabeth as she clapped. \"Bravo\". The two men walked towards the Queen. Elizabeth hid a laugh at the expression on her cousin's face. \"You are a most worthy loser cousin. I commend you,\" said Elizabeth to a sulking Norfolk. \"But a loser nonetheless,\" said Dudley as he picked up a white handkerchief of his wife's lap. She smiled towards her husband. She was happy that he had one and so was little Princess Anne, as this was the first time she had ever seen a tennis match. \"You should not show your familiarity with the Queen everywhere, my lord. It is offensive and disrespectful,\" said Norfolk. Elizabeth was on the verge of laughing. These two men in front of her acting just like two little spoilt boys. \"Your need is greater than mine I fancy,\" said Dudley who held out the handkerchief towards Norfolk. \"It is damp but it is still serviceable.\" Norfolk looked towards Dudley. \"Next time I might just aim the ball right between your eyes.\" The councillors eyed Norfolk and the ladies gasped. This was not a wise thing to say in front of the Queen. \"Judging by your performance, your aim is nothing to boast about Sir,\" said Dudley back. All the ladies hid their giggles. Norfolk walked closer to Dudley and held his tennis racquet towards him. Elizabeth finally felt that enough was enough and that it had to be stopped. \"My lord Norfolk, I will not tolerate threats of violence in my presence,\" said Elizabeth with a cold stare towards her cousin. \"God's blood, it is but a game. Now shake hands and be done with it.\" Robert held his hand out but Norfolk only hit the hand. He had no intention of shaking his hand. He felt that Robert was unworthy of his position. Elizabeth stood up. \"If you think such behaviour finds favour with me Norfolk, than you are sadly mistaken.\" Elizabeth walked off and her ladies followed. Anne paused for a second. She looked towards her father as she stood on a small bench. \"Bravo papa,\" said Anne. Robert bowed towards her and a smile came to her lips. She then quickly hurried off after her mother and her ladies followed in turn. Robert walked towards his wife's chambers. He needed her to see reason. She wasn't visiting her newborn daughter at all. He knew that girl would need his mother. He walked in and his wife was standing there being attended by her ladies. She looked at him and almost laughed. \"Robin, your familiarity made my cousin very displeased today,\" said Elizabeth. He held out the handkerchief that Elizabeth had left with Dudley after the tennis match. Lettice stepped forward to be given the handkerchief but he shook his head. \"No,\" said Robert. Lettice stepped back and Elizabeth eyed him suspiciously. \"You must open it.\" Elizabeth smiled and took the handkerchief. There was something inside, it was something round. She opened the handkerchief lightly. Inside was a miniature portrait of Kathryn. \"She is your daughter as much as Anne is. Her gender is not her fault nor is it yours. You yourself were wanted as a boy but your father accepted you. She is beautiful, just like her mother.\" Elizabeth smiled. He was intending to find favour for their daughter through Elizabeth's weak spot, her vanity. \"She can be summoned to me later, during our private dinner together with Anne. I am sure Anne will like to see her sister.\" Robert took Elizabeth's hand and gently kissed her fingertips. \"I am sure both of our daughter's will be very pleased,\" said Robert in a seductive tone. All of Elizabeth's ladies looked away except for Lettice. In return, Elizabeth kissed Robert's forehead. She unexpectedly pulled away from the embrace and turned around on the spot showing off her new dress. \"Do you think the Holy Roman Emperor's ambassador will like it?\" asked Elizabeth. \"It will be wasted Bess,\" said Robert as he placed his hand to his chin. \"He is old, near sighted and does not have a fondness for red hair.\" \"See the insolence I must endure Lettice,\" said Bess as she laughed. \"He obviously does not want his own daughter, his flesh and blood to be happy.\" Robert made a face. He couldn't believe that Elizabeth thought it best to already arrange a marriage for their eldest daughter. She was not even three yet. He knew that these arrangements and alliances could be rid of in a second if one party wanted something else but how was he to truly argue the point; he was only a mere King Consort. He was the tool used to get these children so the country could create alliances, not the other way around. Yet for some reason, he wouldn't have it any other way. Elizabeth poked Robert's arm. \"There is no need to worry Robin. The ambassador is not here for another few weeks and nerveless, she won't be leaving with him. I wouldn't have it,\" said Elizabeth. She herself couldn't let her eldest daughter go, she was the pearl of her world and at this moment she was the future of this kingdom, God granting that she and Robert didn't have a son. Elizabeth left the room with Robert and most of her ladies in tow. Lettice stayed behind and clutched the handkerchief that was soiled with Dudley's sweat. She couldn't believe that she was slightly infatuated with another man, a married man, a man married to a Tudor Queen of England. She was foolish to think anything could happen, especially since the Queen and her own husband, Walter Devereux, would probably wring her neck for it. Elizabeth and Robert were in her privy chamber waiting for their daughter's and then their dinner to arrive. Elizabeth was nervous at the prospect of seeing her daughter, Kathryn. She was neglectful in her care so far and had hardly bestowed any attention on the infant if any. She was scared that her daughter had forgotten her and cared to be in her father's arms more than hers. Robert could sense Elizabeth's uneasiness and gently placed his hand on top of her own. She smiled towards him. Soon enough, the door was opened by Kat Ashley, who was one of the few to be on attendance on the royal family as they ate dinner, and smiled towards the couple. \"Your majesties, the Princess Anne is here.\" Anne came through with a light yellow dress on. She was followed by her governess, Lady Mary Knollys, as in case the Princess Anne would need anything. Lady Mary Knollys curtseyed in acknowledgement of the royal couple but Anne wanted to ignore protocol. She ran up to her mother and climbed up on her lap and gave her a hug. Elizabeth did so in return and brushed her fingers through her daughter's thick brown curls. \"Haven't you grown prettier since the last time I saw you,\" said Elizabeth, complementing her eldest child. Anne looked at her mother with her dark eyes. \"But mama, I only saw you today. Can I grow prettier within the day?\" asked the curious child. Robert interrupted them with a deliberate cough. Elizabeth looked to the door and there stood Kathryn being held by her wet nurse. The child was still an infant and a tiny one at that. Anne hopped off her mother's lap and scrambled over to her father's lap. The wet nurse walked over to the Queen who had her arms placed out on front of her to hold the child. Elizabeth arms were shaking slightly as the wet nurse handed the infant over to Elizabeth reluctantly. This wet nurse had grown attached to the princess and she in no way approved of the Queen's behaviour. Yet, she was more of the 'suffer in silence' type and she did not want to lose her position as wet nurse for voicing her own opinions. Elizabeth cradled her child and looked down at her tiny delicate face. She caressed with one hand her daughter's little face as Robert and Anne looked on. For Robert, it was a bittersweet moment. For Anne though, she was a bit jealous that her mother's attention wasn't on her. She knew that she would have to deal with it as one day there would be a brother to eclipse the births of both of his sisters but sometimes she wished that no brother would ever be born. She knew it was wrong but it was for a mother's love. She had no idea that it was safer for a son to inherit the throne than that of a daughter but this little girl knew nothing yet of succession. Soon enough, the two princesses were off to the nursery as they had both fallen asleep in their parent's arms. Elizabeth was reluctant to let little Kitty go. She had been neglectful of her youngest daughter for so long, she felt guilty for it. As soon as they left Elizabeth dismissed all of her ladies and Robert dismissed his gentlemen. Elizabeth positioned herself in Robert's lap and buried her face in his shoulder. He himself brushed his fingers through her hair and gently placed kisses on the top of her head as they sat in front of the burning wood within the fireplace. \"Kathryn is getting so big. She is bigger than the last time I saw her,\" said Elizabeth as she looked up towards Robert's face. \"They are both getting bigger. I guess that Kathryn will be smaller than Anne. They were born different sizes so it is a good guess by my opinions,\" said Robert. Elizabeth slapped him hard in the chest. \"What? I did not say one was prettier than the other. They are both pretty, pretty pearls of England.\" Elizabeth laughed. \"They are our pearls Robin. They bond us together,\" said Elizabeth. \"I am will be sad when the day comes that they should leave this kingdom. To go to their own marriages,\" said Elizabeth in an almost melancholy tone. Robert caressed Elizabeth's face. He wanted to ask this to Elizabeth. \"Why do arrangements for their marriages have to be organised now.\" He sounded almost annoyed at the idea of his daughters being married. \"Anyway, why do you want Anne to be married to Maximillian's son? What is his name anyway?\" Elizabeth turned her head and looked at the burning embers within the fireplace. \"It is council's opinion. They decided on it during the sessions we missed. Truly, I am not happy with the proposal. It is not that it is bad or anything, it is just that signing the marriage contract is the first step of having to let her go.\" Robert kissed the top of her head again. He didn't want to see Elizabeth cry. Anyway, Elizabeth could play the ambassador's for their daughter's hands in marriage. She had done so before she impulsively asked him to marry her after Amy Dudley's death. \"Do you remember when you were a child, you vowed that you would never marry, that you would never take a husband,\" asked Robert. She nodded in return. \"And after what happened to your mother who can blame you.\" Elizabeth sat up straight on his lap and looked at him. She hardly talked of her mother. It was something from the past that she didn't like to bring up. She honoured her mother by naming her first born daughter after her but they had never talked about, Robert just went along with it. \"I am glad that you did not forgo the chance of motherhood on some childish vow,\" said Robert as he lifted up her hand and kissed it gently. \"You are only glad that it was you that I chose and not some foreign prince,\" said Elizabeth, smiling at her husband. \"Yes, love from me is hardly that of a foreign prince,\" said Robert, after winking at the remark Elizabeth pushed him which made the chair rock slightly. \"It can be as fickle,\" replied Elizabeth in an almost seductive tone. Robert gasped at the remark. \"As can a woman's,\" replied Robert in the same tone as his wife's. \"But a woman ruler is not as other women is she,\" replied Elizabeth. She picked up a coin from the table and turned it around between her fingers. \"As a coin, there are two sides to her. On the one, she embodies the feminie frailty of her sex and on the other, the body politic, ordained by God.\" Robert was impressed by his wife's speech she just gave him. \"Ahh, then it is to the frail and feminie one I must appeal.\" Elizabeth hit his chest again. She thought that he was in for one nasty bruise in the morning. \"Pity for you then, she only listen's to the council of the other,\" said Elizabeth. They both laughed. It had been awhile since Elizabeth had been this happy. \"And can a woman be sure that a man truly loves her for herself or for her power as Queen.\" \"Can not a man love them both,\" asked Robert. He picked up her hand again and kissed her palm passionately. She kissed his forehead gently and then rested her cheek against the top of his head. He suddenly stood up and Elizabeth looked up at him with shocked eyes. What had she done? Robert looked down at Bess. \"Do not worry; I will come back when your ladies have fixed you for bed.\" Elizabeth suddenly stood up. The foreheads were next to each other. \"I have no need of my ladies,\" said Elizabeth. Robert picked up Elizabeth and carried her to their bed. They kissed each other passionately and violently. Was it because they wanted a son? No, it was just their desire finally taking control just like the passion that burned only a few years ago. AN: I hope you liked that chapter. It was also my first attempt at writing one of 'those' scenes. I don't think I did too badly. Anyway, please review and also please vote in my new poll, it concerns this story. Please review as usual. Your opinions, suggestions and feedback are always appreciated. TBC[Chapter 9] AN: Here it is again, another chapter of Consort of Gloriana. I am glad that you all like the story so far. I have been focusing on little Anne and Kathryn and their relationship with their parents, I will still write about it as it is fun to do, but I also want to write a bit more of the events that went on around them. It may not necessarily start in this chapter but it will further on. Also want to say that I made a mistake along the line. If you read historical non-fiction for fun (my friends think I am weird for reading it so much) you will know that Elizabeth had smallpox in 1562 (the same year Princess Anne is born in my story). Since I was so wrapped up in baby Anne, I forgot to right it into the story, hence this chapter was created. In my story she has it in 1565, after the birth of Princess Kathryn. I also want to mention that Kat Ashley should be dead around now, but I am letting her live a little longer (because I am nice). Anyway, after reading that long introduction, I hope you all enjoy Chapter Eight of Consort of Gloriana. (Beware; it is pretty long since I am trying to start covering up my tracks for future chapters). DISCLAIMER: I do not own the Elizabeth movies, The Virgin Queen miniseries or The Tudors; they belong to their respective owners. I do not own history either. Chapter Eight 15 February 1565 It was early in the morning, far too early for anyone to be serving her. She looked at herself in the mirror. She was wearing a plain dark black gown. She wanted to be invisible. She wanted no one to notice who she was. For once she didn't want to follow protocol. She picked up a piece of paper and left a note for Kat, so she would not panic. Nothing had befallen the Queen. As soon as the last word dried, she left the note on the table and grabbed her oldest scarf. She wrapped it around her head and was off. She luckily made it through the whole court without anyone noticing her. As soon as she made it to the outside paddocks, the world that was green and lush. She started running to an old tree. A tree she had fond memories of. As she reached the destination, she could see one horse and her husband. She started running even faster. This moment was free of protocol. Robert smiled as he saw her coming. This was a plan Cecil and Walsingham would disagree of but sometimes they needed to unwind. Be free from all the conniving courtiers. Elizabeth ran into Robert's arms and laughed. As they let go, Robert kept his arms on the small of her back and her arms were around his neck. \"Look at you,\" said Robert. \"How do I look pray?\" asked Elizabeth, twirling underneath Robert's arm. \"Do you want me to worship like all the other men at court?\" asked Robert. Elizabeth nodded and laughed, she like playing this game with him. \"Is that a frown line I see?\" asked Robert. She started hitting him over the head. Robert tried to run away but he couldn't. Instead, he grabbed her hands. \"Ah, the hands of a Queen.\" Elizabeth smiled at him. Their noses were almost touching. \"My ladies are probably in an uproar right now, you do know that,\" said Elizabeth. She tried to walk away but Robert pulled her close to him. His arms went around her waist as her back was in front of him. As she leaned her head back and rested it on his shoulder, he whispered in her ear. \"Ride with me Bess.\" She tried pulling away. \"I am needed in court,\" said Elizabeth as she tried to move away but Robert still held her tightly. She started laughing. \"Alright, for a little while.\" Robert jumped on his horse and then helped Elizabeth up. She sat in front of him. She looked around at him and laughed. She hadn't done something like this, in like, forever. Robert started the horse into a canter. As the horse went faster and further, Elizabeth felt relieved of the pressures of court life. She just laughed. Soon enough though, Elizabeth knew she was needed back at court. She had the welfare of her daughters to enquire about and she had a requested audience with the Imperial ambassador. Also, Cecil most likely wanted to discuss something with her. She voiced her opinions to Dudley, and they started to ride back. Elizabeth laughed but not as jovial as before. They were soon back into the stage of court life and they were the main actors. Elizabeth walked through the palace. All the courtiers bowed towards her as she walked passed them; it was what they were supposed to do. Finally, after walking through the court with a train of ladies behind her, Elizabeth made it to her destination, the royal nursery. She walked in and saw one of her daughters in the room, Kathryn. She was being held by her wet nurse, who was pacing back and forth trying to keep the baby from crying. The wet nurse suddenly noticed the Queen and curtseyed as best as she could. Elizabeth went and sat down at a nearby chair. She held her arms out for Kathryn to be brought to her. The wet nurse hurried along with the wailing child and handed her to her mother. Elizabeth seemed to have calmed Kathryn down and she stopped crying. \"The little Princess seems to know she is in the arms of her mother, milady,\" said the wet nurse. Elizabeth smile up at her and nodded. She dearly hoped that it was because of that. \"The Princess Anne is not here milady. She went for a morning walk with her governess, Lady Knollys,\" continued the wet nurse before bobbing a curtsey and backing into another part of the room to give the illusion of privacy. Elizabeth smiled down at her tiny daughter. She had grown since when she was born. She was a healthier weight now, not like when she was born. Elizabeth wondered how such a small baby could give her so much grief in childbirth. She didn't mind though. \"My little Kathryn, I will always love you. Please never forget it.\" As soon as she finished saying this, Anne walked in the door with her governess soon trailing right behind her. Anne saw her mother and held her head high. She wanted to show her mother she was a true princess. Elizabeth smiled at her daughter. She freed one hand and held it out towards Anne. \"Anne, my darling daughter,\" said Elizabeth. Anne curtseyed, clumsily, towards her mother. Elizabeth smiled again and Anne came running forward. Elizabeth was glad being here. She liked spending time with her daughters. She was sad that in two days time, Anne was to travel back to Hatfield and start her learning and that soon enough, Kathryn would also be sent to her own establishment, just until she was old enough to go and learn with the Princess Anne. Robert walked around the room. He had to laugh at some of the cunning courtiers, looking to advance themselves in his wife's court. Of course, he had once been one of them and he had made the greatest leap of them all, but more so for love, not ambition. Elizabeth stood at the other side of the room. She smiled towards him as he looked at her. Elizabeth didn't like the fact that she had to separate herself from her daughters so she could speak to the ambassador. It was for the sake of her eldest daughter's future. Robert made his way behind Elizabeth as William Cecil came walking through the door with the Imperial ambassador. \"The ambassador to the Holy Roman Emperor, Maximillian II,\" said Cecil before bowing and moving to the side. The ambassador came forward with a man holding a chest right behind him. \"Your majesty,\" said the ambassador while bowing. \"The Emperor sends his warmest regards to your majesty. He sends this gift for your eldest daughter, Anne, as a token of admiration and that one day she might become the Empress to his kingdom.\" \"Do you here that?\" she said turning towards Robert. \"Our daughter already has admirers and she hasn't even reached her third year.\" The ambassador smiled towards Elizabeth before summoning the gentlemen with the chest forward. He opened the chest and inside was a large ruby, with gold and pearls around the outside. Elizabeth smiled. It was slightly inappropriate for a child like Anne, at her age that is. \"A ruby and quite a magnificent specimen no less and as you know, your grace, the word ruby stems from the Latin word red, thus symbolising heat and fire and thus passion. A little inappropriate for a three year old but beautiful nerveless and I am sure she will love it and appreciate it more once she is older.\" The ambassador was a bit startled at the comment. He realised that this was a protective mother and that she was surely looking out for her daughter's best interests at heart. He was soon taken into an adjoining room where Elizabeth, Robert and him could speak privately. \"I am sorry ambassador that we have to talk in private like this but it is necessary because half of those men out there are not truly loyal to me but are loyal to other King's and Queen's in the world and thus whole conversations are then told to them. I rather like my conversations to not be made public, unless necessary,\" said Elizabeth. The ambassador nodded, fully understanding the Queen. The three of them sat down and discussed the topic that was at hand, the marriage proposal for Anne to marry the Emperor's eldest son and future Emperor, the twelve year old Rudolf. After discussions about the topic, Elizabeth held out her arm and pointed towards a different door to the one they entered from. \"I would guess that your grace would like to see the prospective bride, would you not,\" asked Elizabeth to the ambassador. He nodded most readily and Robert couldn't help but laugh at the man, inside though of course. On the other side of that door stood the Princess Anne with Mary Knollys, her governess, waiting for them to be received into the room. The governess bent down to Anne's level and started fixing the Princess's green dress and matching French hood. \"Now listen to me Anne,\" said the governess. \"You must act a Princess in there. Treat your parents nobly and do not call them Papa and Mama, you may call them that later. There is a guest in there to see you. Remember to call him your grace, as you call your parents your majesties and the special man will call you your highness.\" \"Just like those people that serve me?\" asked the curious little Princess. Mary nodded. \"You must not run either. We discussed this before but you must remember your position. You are a Princess of the House of Tudor. Act as a princess should.\" Anne nodded and the door was opened. The gentlemen who opened the door spoke, \"Her highness, the Princess Anne.\" Anne walked in with her head high but she felt nervous. She didn't understand why she could not call her parents Mama and Papa. No matter why, Anne wanted to act like a true Princess, to act like the true Princess that she was. Anne curtseyed, again clumsily, as she saw her parents. \"Your majesties,\" said Anne as confidently as she could. Elizabeth smile at her daughter. \"Anne, will you not say hello to our guest. He has specially come here to see you,\" said Elizabeth. She may not be sure about the union but she wanted to make sure that they played the marriage proposal game well. \"Your grace,\" said Anne, who bobbed another curtsey, which was slightly less clumsy than the last. The ambassador smiled towards her. He was sure that this little princess was everything the Holy Roman Emperor could want in a daughter-in-law, well except for the age issue, but that could be overcome. \"Your highness,\" replied back the ambassador, with a slight nod towards Anne. Anne walked over as gracefully as she could towards the chair that was waiting for her but her father still had to help her on the chair as it was too tall for her. The ambassador talked to Anne and her parents a bit longer before the ambassador made his farewell and then to set sail to give his report to Maximillian II. Night had finally befallen the day. Elizabeth and Robert were having a quiet dinner together in Elizabeth's chambers. They were only being served by Elizabeth's closest of ladies. They started picking at the food from their plates before any of them spoke. Elizabeth looked up at Robert. \"What are you think about?\" asked Elizabeth. Robert played with the food on his plate. \"Nothing of importance,\" replied Robert. Elizabeth laughed inside. She decided that a conversation needed to start rolling. \"The ambassador seemed quite taken with Anne.\" Robert smiled. \"Do you really think it necessary for Anne to be betrothed now? She is just an infant.\" Elizabeth now looked down at the plate in front of her and dropped the piece of meat that was in her hands. \"The council suggests that Anne has to be betrothed, especially to the future Holy Roman Emperor, you were there when they asked of it. It doesn't mean I will do so.\" \"Why will you not?\" asked Robert. \"It seems like a fine match to me.\" \"It is but you know that if I do not have a son, then she is Queen after me. She will take my place but I can't let the future Holy Roman Emperor take the place as regent and create it another of his dominions. England stands alone. It will not become Spanish, French or part of the Holy Roman Emperor's. I can't let that happen,\" said Elizabeth. \"Pray tell me Elizabeth, what makes you think that we will never have a son.\" Elizabeth looked up at him. She wasn't terrified of him. She would always have the upper hand in this relationship, not like any of the six wives of her own father. She was ruler in this marriage. \"Maybe my miscarriage was a sign. That I will never bear a healthy son; maybe it tells us that Anne is to be ruler.\" Robert sighed. He got up from his chair and walked over to Elizabeth's. He knelt before her and said, \"We are healthy and we are still young enough to have sons. We will have a handful of sons if it will please you. Do not worry about Anne. She will not have to take the burden that you have had to.\" Robert stood up and walked back to his chair. He did not need her to worry of such matters. They started to both pick at their food again. Things had suddenly became tense between them after the ambassador's visit. Soon enough though, Elizabeth felt the need to speak to him again. This was not before she noticed Robert's rather loud sigh. \"Will you come to my bed tonight?\" asked Elizabeth. This was one thing that she had no control over. It was his choice to come if he wished or didn't if he did not want to. Robert downcast his eyes and then shook his head. He wasn't in the mood especially after that conversation. Elizabeth downcast her eyes to and all of her ladies looked away. They wanted no part in this conversation. Elizabeth had to have a chuckle to herself. Sometimes she wished not to know the answer. She just hoped and prayed that he had not finally had the urge to take a mistress. 16 February 1565 Elizabeth walked through the palace with only three of her ladies, Kat Ashley, Catherine Knollys and her daughter Lettice Knollys. She was still fired up other what had happened the night before with her husband. She had no idea where she was going, she hadn't made up her mind but maybe she walked through the palace just to be able to talk to her husband. Suddenly, she found herself facing an almost angry Robert. He started walking towards her but she kept her composure. She couldn't believe that only yesterday everything was fine and she didn't even know why it had changed so suddenly. She looked back towards her ladies. \"Leave us,\" she commanded. They left the direct hallway and went into the adjoining one, so they were close enough to assist the Queen if she needed some. She paused as he came closer. She tried looking in other directions but it always came back to him. \"You look like you are going somewhere,\" said Elizabeth. \"Where are you going?\" Robert looked around. \"I am going out.\" Elizabeth was getting frustrated. Why wouldn't he give her a straight answer? \"You better got go to any brothels or do you have a harem that I do not know about?\" asked Elizabeth who had started thinking the worst, even tears started to swell in her eyes. Robert couldn't believe the nonsense his wife was talking. He took her shoulders and looked her straight in the eye. \"If you must know, I am off to see my daughter.\" Elizabeth had a state of utter confusion across her face. He was in riding clothes and both there daughters were at the palace and he had no children with his late wife, Amy. But that could only mean. \"No,\" she kept on repeating. Robert let go of her shoulders. Elizabeth held one hand over her mouth and one hand over her stomach. She could almost say she felt sick. The tears really started to come this time. \"You and the harlot Frances, you had a daughter together.\" Robert nodded. He felt guilty. He had only found out a few days ago and that was why he had been distant from her. \"Go and see your bastard daughter,\" said Elizabeth solemnly. Robert walked off to the stable yard to go and get his horse. He would deal with the repercussions later. Elizabeth started to feel dizzy. It must have been the news that she had just received. He husband had another child, another daughter. She didn't know what to do. She started to walk forward, towards her ladies. She felt dizzier with every step. She also started to feel weak. Kat Ashley looked towards her Queen. Elizabeth's eyes rolled back into her head and she suddenly and abruptly fell to the ground. Kat, Catherine and Lettice rushed to the Queen's side. They all tried to revive her but it wasn't working. Kat looked towards one of the courtiers standing by and observing. \"Go, get some help for her majesty,\" cried out Kat. The man hurried off to find the physician to help the Queen. All they could do was pray now. These people may have a new Queen in a matter of days. AN: You didn't think that I was going to be that easy on Robert for having an affair did you? Anyway, I will hopefully have the next chapter up soon. I need to finish off the next chapter for A Death to Coronation first and I want to start posting some of my other stories, but I won't be neglectful on this one, I am having way to much fun with the little Princesses, there wasn't much of them in this chapter was there, don't worry plenty of Anne action in the next one, I'll even let her open the chapter. I also want to mention that the poll is still running. It is even so far so I can't close it. I will give it another week so if you haven't voted please go and do so. Also please don't forget to review. It is really appreciated. TBC[Chapter 10] AN: I know that I promised that I would write a chapter for, 'A Death To Coronation' which I am working on but I am hooked on writing this story so in pleasing myself, I am writing a few chapters, just so I can be happy, and hopefully you will to. Anyway, this basically picks off where the last chapter starts (basically, when we all start to hate Dudley and worry about Bess's health). Anyway, I did say I would start off with Princess Anne, so the opening part is for all you Princess Anne fans out there. Also, we have some Mary, Queen of Scots, Alice (Dudley's illegitimate daughter) and her mother Frances . Please enjoy and review. DISCALIMER: As I say every time, I in no way own The Tudors, Elizabeth, The Virgin Queen or even history (only the history I make though.) Chapter Nine 17 February 1565 Princess Anne feared something was wrong and she wasn't off the money for thinking it. It could be a matter of days that she could become a Queen. No one had told her this though, they only told her that her mother was ill and that she could not come and see her. They also told her that she would not be leaving court, not until her mother was well, that is if she ever became well again. Who knows, if the Queen survived she might not be able to bear a child again and the Princess would preside over this empire. Of course, everyone still prayed that the Queen would still provide England with it's much wanted male heir. Though everyone was not sure after the argument they saw between the Queen and King Consort, and over a woman like Mistress Frances Luke. Anne was sitting in the middle of her cushions that were laid out on the floor for her. She held her two favourite dolls, one that was given to her from her cousin, Queen Mary of Scotland and the other that was given to her by her mother only last Christmas. She fell asleep cuddled with the latter doll every night, much to her governess's dismay. Lady Mary Knollys walked over to her little charge who didn't truly understand why her mother hadn't come to see her. Mary knelt down and sat down on one of the cushions. Anne looked up into the hazel eyes of her charge. She hoped that it had been her mother. Her father had come once since her mother's confinement, he had matters of state to attend to, and her little sister was too young to do truly anything at the moment, she was less than two months old. Her mother had always doted on her, even when she wasn't with her. She just didn't understand. She felt that she needed comforting. She walked over on her knees, a very unlady like thing to do but Lady Knollys wasn't going to complain considering the situation, and hugged her governess. The governess wrapped her arms around the toddler whom she had become attached to. She was important to her and could be extremely important for the whole of England. Knollys brushed the little pieces of hair off her charge's face; this was when the tears came from Anne. \"I want mama,\" shouted the infant through her tears. All of the ladies within the royal nursery looked at Anne. She had never shouted like this for her mother, even when at Hatfield. Anne knew though that she was at the palace and that meant that her mother visited her every day, no matter how busy she was with business of the realm. \"Hush now Anne,\" said Mary as she brushed the hairs and tears of her charge. \"Your mama will see you as soon as she can.\" That was sincere. Elizabeth doted on her daughters with every limb in her body. As soon as she could she would want to see Anne and Kathryn. Whether that be here in the palace or up in Heaven, she wasn't sure. Anne wouldn't take that as an answer. She wanted; no she needed her mother now. She wasn't going to let anyone stop her from seeing her. She suddenly got up from her hugging position and ran to the door. Mary didn't have the time to run up and catch but luckily someone had come into the door and stopped the Princess in her tracks. Anne looked up at the man and her frown turned even sour. \"I do not want my Papa,\" said Anne, crossing her arms across her chest. \"I want my mama.\" Robert did not feel hurt by her words, she was but a child. She had always had her mother's attention, more than she did her father's so he could see where she was coming from. Robert picked up his eldest daughter. She tucked her head into his shoulder and sobbed. Lady Knollys had finally gotten up and brushed out the crinkles in her dress. \"Your majesty,\" she said bobbing a curtsey to the King Consort. He nodded in return while he was bobbing Anne up and down, trying to console her. Lady Knollys decided to have a conversation with Dudley as he comforted his child. \"Your majesty how is my cousin, the Queen?\" asked Knollys. Dudley pulled a weak smile for her and from that she knew that she was no better than the last time she had asked someone. \"Her highness is anxious for her mother's recovery, as are we all,\" said Mary, trying to talk about the welfare of the future heir. Robert gently pulled Anne's tear stained face from his shoulder and looked at her. He stroked her hair. \"Are you worried about your mama,\" said Robert gently to his daughter. He sat down at the nearest chair and rested Anne on his knee. She was surely becoming heavier each time he saw her. Anne nodded her small head, making her hair bounce with it. Some pieces got stuck to her tear stained face. \"I want to see mama. She has not seen me. I want my mama,\" cried out the little girl in sorrow. Robert cuddled his daughter. \"Your mama will not be pleased to hear you not acting as a Princess should,\" said Dudley, trying to get his daughter's attentions somewhere else. She needed to stop wailing. She was becoming a difficult child to try and control her emotions. She was just like her mother as a child and most likely just like her grandmother, Anne Boleyn. Anne looked at her father. \"I only want my mama,\" said Anne sweetly, a sweet little smile came to her lips as she said this. She did not like to displease her parents. Robert wiped some of the tears off of her face and kissed the top of her forehead. \"Just remember to say prays for your mama and I am sure she will come and see you as fast as she can,\" said Robert as convincingly as he could. He had almost left the palace when he heard of the Queen's fall. He blamed this on himself, just like the miscarriage of their son. It was always Frances Luke's fault. He didn't want to see her ever again but the fact that they had a daughter together made it difficult to do so. \"I promise Papa, I will, I will,\" said Anne. Her mother loved her and her sister Kathryn, there was no way that she would not come and see them soon. She prayed for her mother. She wanted her to come back. Quickly. Mary of Scotland was shocked to say the least when she heard of her cousin's condition, more so when she had just come out of the birthing chamber after the birth of the Princess Kathryn. She prayed for her cousin's recovery. They may have never met each other but she did care for her. They were family. Elizabeth's rooms were filled with blurs of people moving around the Queen, attending to her and her physician. \"Keep the fire stocked,\" said the physician in a demanding voice towards Lettice. She hurried to add more wood to the fire. Kat Ashley was a mess. She was running around trying to fix everything that the ladies in waiting were doing. \"This water is cold. Isabella, go and get some warm water,\" she said to the youngest of the ladies. Kat had stayed by her mistress's side since she had come down with smallpox. Elizabeth was sweating and the doctor was trying everything he could do. He had wrapped her in red cloth, in hope of extracting the poison that was weakening her. Moans were all that could be heard from Elizabeth until a whisper came to her lips. \"Kat....get..the......council,\" said Elizabeth weakly, barely audible. Kat nodded. She didn't think it was the wisest idea but considering the circumstances, there must be a genuine reason why she wanted to see them. Kat left her mistress's side unwillingly but swiftly and headed towards the council room. After a quick journey she reached it. All the councillors of parliament where sitting or standing there, including Cecil and Dudley. They were all wearing solemn black, understandable to say the least. As the door creaked open all the councillors looked towards her. \"She is asking for you,\" she said. The Queen's cousin walked up to Kat. \"Has she named Anne as successor?\" he asked. If she had, which was most likely, then she would need a Lord Protector. He did not think a traitor's son like Dudley was fit to rule, even if he was the father of the true sovereign who was in minority. He thought that he was best suited for the job. Kat just stared at him. Was that all he was concerned about? Kat walked off without even bobbing a curtsey or nod towards him. She wanted, no she needed to get back to her Queen. The councillors all sat around Elizabeth's bed side. Robert stood at the top of the bed, close to Elizabeth while Cecil knelt next to him, closer to her hand. No matter what had gone on between Queen and her husband, he still had a right to be there. He was her husband. Dr Cowes, her physician, looked up, looking between Cecil and Dudley. \"An ancient Arabic remedy for smallpox,\" said Dr Cowes, explaining his choice of treatment. \"The patient is entirely wrapped in red, to sweat the pox out.\" The Earl of Sussex, the Duke of Norfolk and Sir Christopher Hatton were standing on the other side of the room with handkerchiefs over their mouths. The Earl of Sussex turned around to the other two men and whispered to the other two men beside him, \"Can she see us? Has it entered her eyes yet?\" Christopher Hatton just looked at the two men and replied, \"Please God, let's hope that it has not spread to her brain.\" Both nodded in reply. Cecil was knelling at the side of the Queen's bed with his head in his hands while Robert gently stroked the top of her head. Suddenly, Elizabeth weakly spoke up, \"My lords.\" They all turned towards their sick Queen. \"I fear death possesses me.\" Cecil became nervous. Everyone decided that he would be the one to ask the question. He grabbed the Queen's hand as he began to spoke. \"A successor, your majesty, we must have a name.\" Elizabeth gently spoke her eldest daughter's name. They all knew that she was the successor; they just needed the current Queen to confirm it. \"And a lord protector, your majesty?\" asked a still nervous William Cecil. Elizabeth looked towards Cecil and then up towards Dudley before she looked forward and moaned in pain again. The anxious Norfolk pulled his handkerchief away and said, \"Your majesty, we need a name.\" Elizabeth knew who she wanted as Lord Protector, it was really obvious but as always she had to administer the actions of her parliament, even when sick. \"The protector of the realm shall be....Robert Dudley.\" All of the lords looked together, Norfolk was angry at the decision but it could be easily overruled once the Queen was gone. Lord Protectors had been changed before, in her majesties own brother's reign. Of course one of his protectors was Robert's father, the traitor John Dudley, former Duke of Northumberland. Robert kissed the top of Elizabeth's head, even if it was an unwise move for his health on his part. Even though he was honoured by the position he didn't want his wife to leave him, there were still matters to resolve between them. He didn't want to leave things in this state, he would never forgive himself. Mistress Frances Luke had to give it to her Queen. She knew how to keep a man by her side, even if it wasn't completely her fault. Frances was angry at the Queen. It was to be her daughter Alice's first meeting with her father and if all things went well, he would throw a pension on them both for her up keep as for now she was just a whore that had the King Consort's daughter. No man was willing to have her, especially when she had fallen out of favour with the Queen. Now she never knew when he would want to come again. He would want to be by his wife's side until she was well or until she died and then he would be surely governing the country in his eldest legitimate daughter's name. She feared for her daughter. They lived in a small country estate now, given to them by the kindness of the toddler's father. At least, France thought, for all of my troubles I have a better home than I could ever have given myself or my daughter. Suddenly, one of the servants kindly working here at the estate walked through the door and came towards his mistress. \"A letter from his majesty, milady.\" She took the letter and waved the man away. She quickly opened the seal and read the letter. Mistress Luke I wish for my daughter, the Lady Alice, to be brought to court. You are not permitted to attend the court as you are still banished as the Queen wishes it so. My daughter is an innocent and the Queen will be kind once she recovers from her most unfortunate illness. My servant is waiting outside to bring her to court. I hope you will have your servants pack her belongings quickly and send her quickly forward her to the court. She will become a companion to my eldest daughter and I hope she will grow up with her sister's, the Princess Anne and the Princess Kathryn. Yours sincerely, Robert Dudley, King Consort of England. Frances scrunched the paper in her hand. How dare he take her daughter away from her? She that he would make sure that his daughter was treated with honour but what was to happen to herself. He was likely to throw her in the nearest gutter. Nerveless, she summoned her servant in and ordered that the Lady Alice's belongings be packed for her arrival to court. After about an hour of packing, Lady Alice came to say goodbye to her mother, the only parent she had ever known. She ran up to her mother but Frances did not bend down to hug her daughter. Alice must learn the ways of the court. She was illegitimate and must live off the mercy of the sovereigns, especially the Queens. Alice had tears coming down her face and Frances scowled towards her. \"Alice, do not cry. You are the daughter of the King Consort and you have sisters that are heirs to the throne. You must show the court that you are just as noble as them and if I hear otherwise I will order you to be whipped, do you understand?\" The little girl looked up towards her mother and nodded. She was then taken out side to the carriage by Dudley's servant. Frances was pleased that her daughter was finally getting recognised and that she was now off her hands. She had never been the motherly type but she was glad that she had Alice, to be able to wield some power and position through her offspring. 18 February 1565 The carriage had finally reached the palace and Alice wiped away any tears that still lay on her little chubby cheeks. For a child only of only a year old, she had the walk, talk and elegance of someone older, and it was only because her mother had beaten it into her. The servant picked up the little girl and placed her on the floor. She looked up towards the grand palace. He was way bigger than Kenilworth, she was sure of that. This was a moment she was never going to forget. Her thoughts were dispersed when a lady walked forward. It was Lady Mary Knollys, the Princess Anne's governess. \"Lady Alice, please follow me.\" Anne followed the much older lady through the corridors of the court. Alice was too young to understand the courtier's whispers about her. Some knew that she was the King Consort's illegitimate daughter while others were confused to why such a young girl was at court. They soon made it to the royal nursery. Lady Knollys turned towards the little girl. \"You will recognise the Princess Anne and Kathryn by the title of your highness. You must treat them with honour as they are ranked above you no matter of linage.\" Alice didn't understand all of what she said but she knew that they were to be called your highness. The door was soon opened and Alice walked behind Lady Knollys into the chamber. Alice bowed to the Princess Alice and Kathryn, whom which the latter was being held by her wet nurse. \"Your highnesses,\" Alice said, fumbling a little with the last word. Anne smiled at the younger child. She had been told by her father beforehand that another child was to be with them in the royal nursery, and that she was her half-sister. She didn't believe it a first but she was glad she was to have a friend especially when her mother could not come and visit her. She also wanted someone to play with considering that Kathryn couldn't play yet. Anne sat down and Alice got up from her bow – her blue eyes stared in envy at the Princess's dolls. Anne noticed that Alice was looking at her dolls. \"Do you not have dolls?\" asked Anne. Alice just shook her head. Her mother told her that dolls were beneath her and that she should not possess any. \"You can play with my dolls if you would like,\" said Anne, wanting to help the little girl overcome her shyness towards her. Anne walked slowly towards the place where the Princess was sitting with her dolls. She sat down and they started playing together. Lady Knollys was glad that the Princess had taken a liking towards her half-sister; the King Consort would be pleased. She hoped that this would be a start of a friendship between the two. AN: I hoped you enjoyed the chapter. I don't mind if you hate Frances, I do to. The end of Elizabeth's illness will be within the next chapter. Also there will be more sister moments between Anne, Alice and Kathryn as well as the beginning of Queen Mary's relationship with Lord Darnley. Thank you to all that review, your reviews make me smile and it is appreciated. Please review this chapter as well. TBC[Chapter 11] AN: Welcome to a new chapter of 'Consort of Gloriana'. I am glad that you all seem to like Alice. There will be obvious differences between all the sisters, now and when they grow older. I am not going to keep you waiting with my author's note as this one is a long chapter. When I mean long, this is long. Please enjoy and review. PS: Sorry for taking so long to update. DISCLAIMER: I do not own The Tudors, The Virgin Queen or the Elizabeth movies. They belong to their respective owners. Chapter Ten 19 February 1565 Robert was not usually nervous but the events within the last week had shaken him. The surprise news that he had an illegitimate daughter by that whore Frances Luke had been the icing on the cake of a 'perfect' week. Yes, Frances had been a good time while his wife was with child but he should have known better. His wife was the higher authority in this relationship. She held the power to have him executed just like her father had done to her mother and step-mother. He was foolish. He didn't want to make that mistake again. He was so close to losing his wife. Dr Cowes, the physician they had entrusted with the Queen's life, said that her condition had not yet improved nor had it weakened so they couldn't really say that she was dying, nor that she was recovering any quicker. Kat Ashley, Elizabeth's most trusted friend and one-time governess had insisted that he stay out of the room. She said that if one parent was to be lost the over should not follow. He had agreed but he still had the nagging feeling to be with her. As he walked along the path and almost near the archway that led to the man-made pond, he heard whispers of little girls laughing, well one in particular. He smiled. He would be glad to see his eldest offspring. He made his way under the arch and he saw Lady Knollys with Anne and another little girl. He swallowed and his body stood motionless. He had sent a letter to Frances not expecting to have his daughter sent to him, he thought her too greedy to give up daughter. He had preferred her to be here but yet something in his gut told him Frances wouldn't agree. Yet, here was a little girl of the right age standing on the other side of the fountain. He walked closer to them and finally Lady Knollys noticed. Mary knew that Anne would act appropriately at first, at least bowing to her father but she wasn't quite sure of Alice. As she bowed down, she gently placed a hand on the girl's shoulder and it prompted Alice to do the same. Anne wasted no time in being swept up in her father's arms. She wanted to show Alice that she was the pride and joy of her parents. Alice didn't look up at them though. She didn't know who this man was or why he was allowed to touch a Princess of the royal blood like that. \"Papa,\" said a delighted Anne as Robert carried her a bit further over, so they could at least try and have their own conversation. He noticed out of the corner of his eye that Lady Knollys was motioning for the other girl to be taken away. \"Lady Knollys, leave...\" He was a bit startled. He had forgotten to even ask anyone what his daughter's name was. He blamed this more on Frances though. She had only said that she must see him at once as they have a daughter together. \"We were just leaving your majesty,\" said Lady Knollys, curtseying a little. \"No I meant to stay. Do not motion for my daughter to leave,\" said Robert in a stern voice. Alice looked up at him. She didn't understand what he was talking about. She hadn't the faintest idea. Lady Knollys bobbed a curtsey again but she did instruct the girl to walk with her around the pond so Anne had some moments with her father. \"Mama is still not well,\" asked the saddened child. Robert nodded. Anne quickly tightened her grip on his father's neck and placed her head onto his shoulder. He could hear muffled cries coming from Anne and so he gently stroked her hair. \"Hush, hush,\" said Robert, soothing his daughter some. \"Are you not a Princess?\" asked Robert. Anne looked at him with her dark eyes and nodded. \"Then for your mama, do not cry for her. She would not want to see you upset.\" Anne nodded again and gently wiped her tears away. \"Anne, may you tell me the name of your friend?\" asked Robert as he looked to the other side of the fountain where Lady Knollys and his other daughter had walked to. \"Her name is Alice,\" said the young girl with a smile. Robert walked over towards Lady Knollys and Alice with Anne still in his arms. As they reached them, Alice bowed again, not even being prompted this time. She had been told that he was part of the royal family and her mother had told her that she was to respect royalty and when she questioned why she had been hit, she even had a bruise to prove it. Robert placed Anne down but she still kept a grip on his hand. Robert knelt down but did not rise from her bow. She was too scared to do so. \"Lady Alice,\" said Robert, acknowledging his illegitimate daughter. \"Do you know who I am?\" Alice stood up and looked at him with her blue eyes. She shook her head. She had no clue who this man was truly. He smiled. This girl was so innocent and very shy; she also seemed to be wary of herself even at this young age. She didn't exactly have the confidence that her mother had; she just had it in another way. \"I am your father Lady Alice.\" The girl just looked at him with wider eyes. Her mother had always told her that her father was important she just didn't think that he was this important. Even though she was a bastard she knew that she was important because she was the daughter of the King Consort of England. Robert placed out his other hand that wasn't being held by Anne out for Alice to take a hold of. Alice walked slowly over to the hand. No one had been this kind to her before. She was always being told off for some reason and never had truly known a true happiness. For the first time in her life she was what she thought was happy. The physician was still worried, the Queen was restless in her sleep and her vitals were not looking any better. He didn't want to say to the council to prepare for Princess Anne to know be called a Queen because it was too soon for that but it was also too soon to say that she will survive as well. All of the ladies were tense around the room. They didn't know how to help her. When most of them arrived to serve the Queen they thought it involved just helping out with folding cloths and pregnancies, not life threatening illnesses. Kat continued to shove around the ladies in waiting like rag dolls. She didn't feel right about it but she wanted to keep distracted. She loved Elizabeth like she was the daughter she never had. She knew that Elizabeth was a fighter; she had been all of her life. She believed in all of her heart that Elizabeth would make it through. She had to make it through. Francis Walsingham was a man that no other men could trust and only a few did. He stared into the fire contemplating the future. He was disturbed by the rattling and sorting of papers being done by Cecil. He turned around quickly to see what his old friend was doing. Cecil was just doing as Francis had heard. He was sorting through papers, probably something to do with the Princess Anne. \"I have heard rumours abroad Cecil,\" said Walsingham out of nowhere. Cecil suddenly looked up towards Francis, still holding mountains of papers in each of his hands. \"What rumours Cecil?\" asked the man. It was obviously important as Walsingham only ever told information that was of the highest importance. Walsingham put on a sly smile. \"There are rumours that when the Queen is dead that Mary, her cousin, will invade from Scotland and seize the throne or be regent for Anne. She might even want to put Kathryn on the throne as she is her Goddaughter.\" Cecil was gobsmacked. Who would say such things when the Queen was actually closer to recovery than to death? It was the Catholics of course. They wouldn't hurt a child especially when it could be converted. \"I think it is best that we speak to Dudley about this. He is the protector of the realm.\" Walsingham nodded and a message was sent. Robert came quickly after, fearing it was something to do with Elizabeth or his daughters. He still hadn't gone to bed yet even though it was dark. It was hard for him to sleep most nights. \"What is the matter?\" asked Robert as soon as the door was shut. His worried expression was almost enough to make Walsingham laugh. Cecil walked over to him. \"Don't worry it is nothing to do with the Queen's health or that of the Princesses,\" said Cecil, with Robert nodding in comprehension. \"It is something to with new rumours spreading around other courts, about the Queen and it does have to do with the Princesses.\" Robert waved his arm for Cecil to continue. \"They say that Queen Mary of Scotland wishes to take the throne once Elizabeth is dead, which we all hope is not for awhile yet your grace, and that she will either give it to herself or become regent over one of your daughters, most likely Kathryn as she is her goddaughter.\" Robert chuckled. He didn't want to believe that someone they saw as their ally would want to turn against them so harshly, especially when the Queen did not even have one foot in the grave. \"Cecil, I don't think it will come to that, do you?' asked Robert, before he could hear the reply though he was out of the room. He did not want to think about losing his wife; he just couldn't let that happen. Mistress Frances Luke stared into the fire. For some reason she actually missed her daughter. Maybe it was because she thought that her interests would fade with her gone or maybe she did truly miss her. She wasn't heartless. She did care for her daughter and she only did what she did out of fear that her daughter could become an unacknowledged bastard. She didn't want her daughter to suffer in this political world. She thought for a second. The Queen was still ill. No church bells had been rung in acknowledgement of her recovery so that meant that the court was free for visitors and they were not expected to see the Queen, only the King Consort. It was her perfect time to attack for the advantages to come with being a King's mistress and the mother of his bastard. 20 February 1565 It was early in the morning and Kat had already awoken after a long night of uneasy sleep. She was already attending to Elizabeth and Dr Cowe had just arrived back after he had been also at an uneasy rest. A few of her ladies had to stay with her during the night in case of any changes to her condition. Kat gently wiped a wet towel over Elizabeth's head. She had been having uneasy sleep as well; she was always tossing and turning. Kat, of course, worried but the physician said that it was a good sign. Kat got up from the position next to the Queen. Her old knees ached. She went over to fire place and added more logs to the fire. The fire burned within. Sometimes she wished she could leave this solemn room but she wouldn't dare leave Elizabeth in this state. She sighed and then a louder noise filled the room. Kat turned around to see Elizabeth sitting upright screaming, her hair stuck to her face from the sweat. Kat rushed to her side as well as Dr Cowe. Kat helped lower Elizabeth down, with the help of Lady Isabelle. Dr Cowe immediately put wet towels to her face. Elizabeth stared at Kat and a small smile was across her face. She was going to live, she was going to live. Kat was happy, she was beyond happy. She walked amongst the court and the courtiers could see it across her face. She quickly hurried to the rooms set up as the royal nursery. Robert was happily watching his daughters, Anne and Alice playing with one of the Queen's dogs and he was nursing Kathryn in his arms. Kat waited due to protocol but it wasn't long before Lady Knollys announced Kat's arrival. \"Your majesty, Mistress Kat Ashley.\" Kat bowed as she entered the room and Robert smiled for her to come over. She looked down at little Kathryn who was sleeping soundly. She made a little gurgling sound that Kat had to smile at. Robert looked up at Kat. \"Is there something wrong with Elizabeth?\" asked a concerned Robert. Kat smiled. \"Nothing is the matter your majesty. Actually everything is well. Her majesty is going to be fine. She first showed signs of restoring health early in the morning but we didn't want to give you false hope until we knew for sure. She is now sitting up and she has asked to see you.\" Lady Knollys smile and held her hands out for Princess Kathryn to be given to her. He quickly kissed Anne and Alice on the head before heading quickly to Elizabeth's room. Kat was keeping pace behind him. As they reached the Queen's doors, Kat stepped in front of him. \"I think that it is best that I inform her that you have come.\" Robert nodded and Kat walked through the door. No sooner was she back and she nodded for him to come through. He walked in and saw her, his love and his wife. She was paler than he last remembered but she was breathing, she was alive. She smiled at him. She realised that his illegitimate daughter was not at fault. Her parent's relationship ended over a year ago. The child played no threat to her own, not like when she was born and the threat she posed to her own elder sister, Mary. Kat and Lady Isabelle left the room and let the two be alone. Robert bowed and before he could say anything, Elizabeth waved her hand for him to sit on the edge of her bed. He came and sat by her and she took his hand in hers. \"I am sorry for going off about your....your other daughter. I realise that this little things do not matter. It was a onetime thing a long time ago.\" Robert hushed and gently caressed her face. \"There is no need to apologise; I should have told you the moment that I found out.\" Elizabeth smiled at him. \"And that reminds me, I must tell you that I ordered that the Lady Alice, my....my daughter, was to come to court. I received a distressing report from one of her mother's servants. I had to for her own safety.\" Elizabeth nodded. She would have preferred that his daughter never came to court but if the child was not being cared for properly then it was best that she have a place where she could be well looked after. She could obviously work out that the child must have been around the same age as Anne so she could always be sent with Anne when she starts being tutored. \"I would like to see my daughters. The physician said that it is best that I do not exert myself but seeing my daughters surely would not cause harm.\" Robert smiled at her. He was willing to bend to her every whim and command. He thought that he had lost her; he wouldn't let her slip like that from him again. \"I will send for them immediately. Anne had to be consoled every day. She thought she had displeased you.\" Elizabeth smiled and her two girls where soon brought to her. Lady Knollys came in with Princess Anne first with a wet nurse following in hot pursuit with Princess Kathryn in her arms. Both ladies bowed as best as they could but Lady Knollys was having a difficult time as all Anne wanted to do was run up to her mother. Lady Knollys placed Anne on the floor and she ran over to her mother. Robert helped the toddler up on to the bed and Anne fell into her mother's open arms. Anne was crying again and so was Elizabeth. It was obvious that they had both missed each other and Robert could tell that Lady Knollys was going to have one tough time when they went back to Hatfield. Kathryn was handed over to Robert to hold and Lady Knollys looked on at the scene. It looked like the perfect family. She wondered if Alice would ever be able to join in the fold. She wouldn't doubt that even that if they had another together it would have a hard time adjusting in this strong family bond that these four seemed to share. Elizabeth looked up at Lady Knollys and the wet-nurse with her tear stained eyes. \"You may leave us, Lady Knollys.\" Lady Knollys and the wet nurse left reluctantly. Knollys was stopped though when Elizabeth looked at them again. \"Thank you for all your care towards our beloved Princesses.\" Both smiled at the praise from the Queen and quickly bobbed a curtsey and were on their way. Anne looked up at her mother. She was still crying and Elizabeth hated to see her daughters cry. \"Hush,\" she said to console Anne, gently brushing some of Anne dark brown hair out of her wet eyes. \"There is no need to cry, I am hear know, I will never leave you.\" Anne liked being embraced in her mother's hug. It was always the best, better than her father's and Lady Knollys. \"I love you Mama and I like your hugs the best.\" Robert and Elizabeth chuckled at this. Robert didn't mind that these two shared such a close bond; it was natural for a mother and daughter. Suddenly, the once asleep Kathryn was squirming in his arms and she started to cry. He thought that she just wanted attention from her mother as well. Anne shifted over, still staying close to her mother and Elizabeth held a crying Kathryn in her arms. She suddenly quieted down like the other times that she held her like this. \"She has changed so much,\" she said looking at Robert and Kathryn. Elizabeth would never want to give up those treasured moments again. No illness would make her miss seeing her daughters again. The coach arrived at the palace and Mistress Luke was helped out. She had to sigh at the place. She remembered first arriving here. She thought that all her fortunes had been made and truly they had with the birth of Alice, of course it would have been better if it was a boy. She would have proved that it is Elizabeth's fault and not Robert's but now that she had a daughter sired by him, she wasn't quite so certain. She walked into the palace and was guided towards the royal nursery. As she walked through the palace she heard the courtiers whispering to each other that she was the 'royal mistress', Dudley's maîtresse en titre but that was far from true. It had ended as soon as Elizabeth found them in each other's arms and to tell the truth, it would have ended soon anyway. When she saw him next, there was no doubt in her mind that she was going to get one lecture to top them all. She was greeted by Lady Mary Knollys who gave her a cold hard stare. As Alice was now under her care, she had seen the bruises and had already disrespect for anyone who could treat an innocent child like this. \"Mistress Luke, I have had no word from their majesties as to your visit,\" said Mary coldly. Frances smirked. \"I need ask no one when to see my own daughter, my flesh and blood.\" Mary just stared at the young women. \"I am sorry but your daughter is not just any daughter but that of the Royal Blood. You have to see his majesty first.\" Frances was gob smacked that this woman had this much courage. She usually could stare a person down whether that is a man or a woman. She went off in a huff to find where the King Consort was. She wasn't necessarily here for her daughter but for her position to be lifted within the court. Kat came into the room where Elizabeth was still with her daughters and husband. She didn't want to break up this reunion but she had no choice, Cecil wished to see the Queen and there was a matter that Robert needed to attend to urgently. \"Your majesties,\" said Kat. All of them looked over, except Kathryn of course who was sleeping again. \"I am sorry to disturb you but Sir Cecil wishes to see you and there is a matter that his majesty is needed to attend to. I am more than willing to take the Princesses back to the nursery.\" Elizabeth nodded, sadly. She handed over Kathryn to Kat and Anne was helped off the bed and was held by Lady Isabelle, who had come in when Kat instructed her to. They both curtseyed and left to the nurseries. Kat waited outside though, as Robert came through the door he asked, \"What is the matter that I need to attend to?\" Kat smiled. \"Mistress Frances Luke wishes to be received by your majesty. I have been told that she ordered that she was to see her daughter but Lady Knollys refused. I am sure that you would like to settle this without the Queen's knowledge.\" Robert nodded in response. \"That woman is trouble. I doubt that she is here for the welfare of her daughter but for her own selfish appetite.\" He quickly went off to find Frances. She was banished from court, why couldn't she understand that. Kat quickly curtseyed as he walked away. She remembered when he was a young boy. She never would have thought that she would live to see him as the King Consort. Frances tapped her foot as she waited for the King Consort. She was not a patient person by nature. Patience was not one of her virtues. As she heard the door open from behind her, she dropped down into a curtsey, almost as low as the floor. She looked up at Robert who almost had a scowl on his face. \"Why are you here without consent?\" asked Robert. He was wife was almost back to her good self again and he didn't want this joy to be diminished by anything. \"I am here to see my daughter or is that a crime,\" asked Frances as she got up from her bow. She put her hands on her hips as she looked at him. Robert wished he could slap her over the face but if he did he would be brought down as low as her. \"No it isn't a crime but you must surely know that this is not the most ideal time.\" Frances just laughed. She wasn't one for caring about others. \"What is your precious Elizabeth still ill?\" asked Frances. Robert grabbed her arm. They stared at each other with cold eyes. \"You know that I could have you arrested for treason for you saying that,\" said Robert, grabbing her arm tighter. \"Why are you truly here for I know it is not about your daughter?\" Frances pulled her arm away and held it tight. She could feel the blood rushing to the spot and she knew that there where red lines there without even looking. \"If you must know, I want my fortunes to change. I wish to marry or at least have a place at court. I am the mother of your child aren't I?\" Robert waved her away. She went off in a huff. She turned and saw Robert cursing under his breath. She almost had to laugh if her situation wasn't so dangerous. Mary bit on her bottom lip. She was sitting in front of the most handsome man. His name was Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley. The last time she had saw him she just viewed him as her cousin who also had a claim to the English throne. Now she saw him as the most handsome man she had ever seen. He was tall, which was a plus since she was tall and to her he was handsome. She wanted the next King of Scotland to be his son. She would marry the man no matter how many people would turn her against him. AN: Well, wasn't that a long chapter. Again, sorry for not updating sooner, I hope you are happy with the story so far.

She is was born Douglas Howard. She was a first cousin to Anne Boleyn. I hope it is okay that I am doing this. Also if you know her story, you never know I might include that story line later on. DISCLAIMER: I do not own the Elizabeth movies, The Virgin Queen or The Tudors, they belong to their respective owners. Chapter Eleven 1 May 1568 Mary was no longer a Queen. She was stuck in this palace, well not even a palace. It was an old castle and she was its prisoner. Her baby boy, James, had been taken away from her, her second husband was murdered and her third was the murderer. Worse still was that she had just miscarried, just miscarried of her two darling twins that would never know the warmth of their mother's arms. Even if their father was made from an abusive relationship she wouldn't have hated them for it, they were only innocents in this world. Loch Leven Castle was a lonely place. She only had a few women accompanying her, they were her faithful ladies from when she was Queen. No, she was anointed by God to rule over Scotland since she was only a few days old. Her son might be called King James VI but she was Queen and it was only because she was a Catholic and her last disastrous marriage that she had been kicked off. She was too scared to say no to him but she should have, she had the higher authority. She wanted, no she needed to escape from this place and she needed an ally, she needed a powerful ally. Lady Knollys was trying to fix up everything within the royal nursery at Hatfield. Not only did she have to show the Queen and King Consort that she ran an honourable household, she was also packing up the Princesses belongings as they were both to travel to Whitehall with their parents as it was soon to be Princess Anne's sixth birthday. Lady Knollys remembered when the little girl was born and then when Princess Kathryn was born. Kathryn had turned three only a few months ago and they had travelled to court on that occasion to. It had been a shorter visit than the one that was about to happen now but that was only because not only was it the elder of the two's birthday but Ambassadors of other countries were happening to come to court all around the same time and Anne and Kathryn's presence was said to be necessary. Lady Knollys was thankful though that she was only required to care for only Anne as the Queen granted that Kathryn should have her own governess as well. Lady Knollys was thankful that the Queen had let her stay on to the elder of them, the one who at this moment in time was most likely the next Queen of England after her mother. She worried what England would be like if Anne was ever to rule, she could be a handful sometimes. Lady Douglas Sheffield, the Princess Kathryn's governess, was upstairs helping the two Princesses and their classmates into their dresses. Both of the governess's would be accompanying them to court and the girls that were able to share lessons with the princesses would be returning to their homes for the month, unless of course their parents were taking them to court. Each of the princesses had their own assigned 'friends' once they were both in the classroom. Kathryn had her own household but that had been merged with Anne's since Kathryn's birthday in February. Anne had been ready for ages and was tired of sitting around doing nothing. Only one of her closest friends and her cousin, Mary Sidney, was ready, all of the others were waiting for Lady Douglas to fix them up so they would be ready for her mother and father. Mary was a very smart girl and she loved to read stories. Being a first cousin to Anne and only a year older made her position in the household certain. Douglas tried to calm the girls down as she finished the last of the girl's hairs. \"Remember girls, you are to greet the Queen and King Consort of England. You are to act in the most obedient manner and must stay in the place that we put you downstairs okay.\" All the girls nodded enthusiastically except for Lady Alice. She may have had royal blood flowing through her veins but she would not be allowed to stand next to Anne and Kathryn. When all of the girls, after being greeted by the King Consort and Queen, would be greeted by her parents but she knew that her own mother wouldn't be there to greet her. She never was. Her mother might have been reluctantly given a place at court but that didn't mean she saw her daughter as much as other mothers did. She hoped that her father would show kindness to her and recognise her. That was all she wanted out of this visit. Lady Mary Knollys stood with the Princesses and there entourage of small friends as they waited for the royal couple to arrive with their own entourage. They had already entered the stable yard and Lady Douglas was greeting them and showing them the way. Elizabeth of course remembered the place. This was the place that she herself had grown up. As footsteps became louder and louder, the young girls behind all started to giggle but Anne was displeased. She turned her head sharply at the girls and placed one finger over her mouth before looking up at Lady Knollys who had a half scowl on her face. But before she could worry about that any longer, her mother and father walked through the door. Both of the Princesses face's both lit up when they saw their parents. Elizabeth knelt down but Robert just stood up and looked down upon the two girls that were running into their mother's arms much to Lady Knollys dismay. Douglas didn't mind though. She had two children of her own and she would always want her children to run to her like that. While the reunion between mother and daughters was happening though, Robert scanned the row of little girls and one boy, Lady Sheffield's son, to find his other daughter, Lady Alice. Like usual, Frances didn't appear to show any interest in their daughter, really Elizabeth showed more care for her than Frances did. She had grown once again but she was still slight for her age but he could tell that she was to be another beauty. Elizabeth however, did not notice that anyone else was in the room besides her daughters. \"You have both grown so much,\" said an amazed Elizabeth. They were both perfect in her eyes. Both of the girls kept on telling their mother how much they missed her and their papa who smiled down at them. Though it wasn't long until Anne and Kathryn wanted to show them all of their friends with the help of Lady Douglas. All of the children stood up straight when the Queen came over as they had been told to curtsey when they were greeted to the Queen and King Consort. After Elizabeth's nod, Lady Douglas started to introduce the girls. \"Your majesty,\" said Douglas. \"These first ladies are companions of Princess Anne.\" All the girls that were assigned to be more so Anne's companions stepped forward. \"Mistress Mary Sidney, daughter of the King Consort's sister and Sir Henry Sidney.\" The young fair-haired girl curtseyed deeply as the Queen nodded towards her. \"Lady Margaret Russell, daughter of the Earl of Bedford.\" The girl, who was to turn eight this year, curtseyed towards the Queen. \"Lady Penelope Devereux, daughter of Viscount Hereford and Lettice Knollys.\" The girl who was obviously Lettice's daughter smiled up at the Queen as she curtseyed. The next girl to be introduced was Penelope's aunt. \"Mistress Catherine Knollys, daughter of Sir Francis Knollys and Lady Catherine Knollys and last is Lady Alice Dudley.\" The little girl curtseyed and looked up towards her 'step-mother' and father. They both smiled at her and she gave them a weak smile back. Elizabeth was disappointed that Alice couldn't see her as a mother figure but her mother was alive but she just did not care about her as much as she should. \"Thank you for being companions to the Princess Anne, I have heard a lot about each of you.\" All of the girls smiled at the Queen's kind remark. She was then brought towards Kathryn's companions but Robert, who was standing behind her, just stood next to Alice. Once the other nobles could come and collect their children, he would make sure that Alice knew that she was loved. Lady Douglas had to start again with the list of names. \"Lady Elizabeth Sheffield, daughter of myself and my husband Baron Sheffield, Lady Dorothy Devereux, sister to Penelope, Lord Edmund Sheffield, my son, Mistress Elizabeth Throckmorton, daughter of Sir Nicholas Throckmorton and Lady Martha Stanley, daughter of the Earl of Derby.\" Again Elizabeth smiled warmly towards all the girls and boy and thanked them for their companionship. She then asked herself to be excused with her daughters and then the nobles came into collect their daughters. Robert picked up Alice and tickled her. \"Are you too old for tickles?\" asked Robert to his daughter. She laughed. She may not be old for tickles but one day soon she would be too heavy to pick up. He followed Elizabeth with Alice in his arms to be inside the private room where Elizabeth and his other two daughters were. He hoped they could all be one big happy family. Frances sat opposite Sir Christopher Hatton. She had recently become his mistress. It wasn't as great as it was to be a King's mistress but she was happy in this relationship. Plus he wasn't married which meant that if she ever fell pregnant with his bastard she would just convince him to marry her. She turned her head once she heard the sound of approaching horses and carriages. She walked slowly over to the window and looked out. Her daughter would be in one of the carriages but as usual should would not go and greet her. Christopher came up behind Frances and put his arms around her waist. \"I think you should go and see your daughter,\" whispered Christopher in Frances ear. Frances laughed. Her daughter would never want to see her and what if she didn't recognise her, what over embarrassment could be put on her then. \"No, she will be brought to me later,\" said Frances. \"Do you mind staying with me when she comes?\" asked Frances. Christopher nodded and placed his head upon her shoulder. Maybe meeting her daughter wouldn't be so bad. Elizabeth and Robert had said good night to their two daughters. Even though it was rare for them to see them it was important that they didn't change their routine too much. The two of them had dismissed their servants and sat in front of the fire. Elizabeth rested her head upon Robert's shoulder. Robert could sense that there was something that Elizabeth wanted to talk to him about but he knew that she would need prompting to mention it. \"Bess, what is it? You have been silent all night.\" Elizabeth lifted her head from his shoulder. She didn't know how to mention this to him. \"Robin, I was talking to Cecil the over day and what he said, I actually believe that what he said will be good for Anne,\" said Elizabeth. She lifted her hand up when Robert was about to speak. She needed to say this all at once otherwise she would never be able to say it all. \"He thinks that Anne is deserving of the title that is hers by right because she is our eldest child and future Queen of England. It is decided that we will give her the title of Princess of Wales and will hence forth live in Ludlow Castle.\" Robert didn't know what to say. He should have expected this a long time ago; Elizabeth was always mentioning that Anne was the future Queen and that they would never have a son no matter how many times that he had reassured her that they would. It wasn't promising that there had been no more pregnancies since her bout with smallpox but that could change. He believed in his heart that he would have a legitimate son with her. \"When is she to be given the title?\" he asked after a minute of silence. Elizabeth continued to stare into the fire. \"On her birthday and she won't return to Hatfield but herself and Lady Knollys as well as the rest of her own household will move onto Ludlow as well as the new attendants that are to be given to her.\" Robert was shocked that he had not even been told before now that his eldest daughter was about to move to Wales and he had not even been given a say about it. He was always expected to allow Elizabeth to make all the decisions but sometimes he didn't appreciate being given such a meagre standing. He suddenly stood up and started to walk out of the room. \"Where are you going?\" asked a nervous Elizabeth. Robert turned his head towards her. \"You bed will have to be cold tonight but then, you don't ever think to have a male heir anyway so what is the point,\" said Robert in a cold voice. He only said these things out of anger. Did she think that he was so impotent to never be able to sire a child again? He stormed out of the room leaving Elizabeth sitting there, feeling guilty and hurt by the last words she had heard coming out of his mouth. 4 May 1568 Elizabeth had not talked to her husband since the remarks that he had made the other night. She didn't feel like talking to him about it. She had too much of her mother and father's personality for her to give in that easily. She was a Tudor. Since then, she had devoted her time to her two daughters. She was with Anne more than she was with Kathryn because she knew that it would be harder for them to visit each other once Anne was to move the Ludlow. Lady Knollys had been told of the arrangement but Anne was yet to know, she wanted to tell Anne herself. Elizabeth was with Anne now as she waited for the new Scottish envoy, Sir James Melville, to arrive for his audience with her. They were sitting at the piano in Elizabeth's rooms. Anne was a diligent performer already; she had obviously gained the love of music from her mother. Elizabeth was teaching her a special piece, one that Anne's grandfather and her own father, Henry VIII, had composed. As Sir Melville was escorted into the room, he bowed forward but Elizabeth and Anne continued to play on the piano. Sir Melville looked up, waiting for the Queen and Princess to acknowledge his presence but he still stood there, bent over as he was still bowing. He finally decided to cough as a way to catch their attention. Elizabeth and Anne both looked up startled, they both hadn't realised that he had come in. Elizabeth, after her initial shock smiled at the man. \"You startled us Sir,\" said Elizabeth standing up from her seat, motioning for Anne to come and stand beside her. Sir Melville stood up from his bow and walked over to them both. \"Sir James Melville, your majesty. It is an honour indeed,\" he said, kissing Elizabeth's hand. He then smiled at the Princess. \"As it is to meet you your highness.\" Anne blushed at the compliment. Elizabeth was proud at her eldest and as soon as she said this, Lady Sheffield came in with Kathryn. Elizabeth smiled at the sweet little blonde three year old. \"Sir, this is the future Queen of Scotland, the Princess Kathryn.\" Kathryn curtseyed before the man and he kissed her hand as well. \"My, won't we have a pretty Queen,\" said Melville. Kathryn smiled at the envoy. She had been betrothed to James VI since he was only a few months old. She was older than him by a bit more than a year but the two Queens' that arranged the match thought it was best for the stability of their two realms to have an English Princess as consort. Elizabeth smiled at her youngest as well. She was shy in comparison to her younger sister. Her younger sister liked to be the centre of attention, much a Boleyn trait Elizabeth believed even though she had not truly met her mother, while Kathryn, well she wasn't sure where her traits came from but she was still as perfect as Anne nerveless. \"Lady Sheffield, may you continue in teaching the Princess's the piano.\" Douglas curtseyed towards the Queen, \"Yes, your majesty.\" Anne was the first to start playing while Kathryn sat back, a bit too timid to admit that she wasn't the best of players, she preferred the needlework that she had started to learn. Elizabeth, meanwhile, escorted the envoy over to the other corner of the room. \"Anne plays very diligently does she not, Sir Melville,\" asked Elizabeth. \"She does indeed your majesty. She will be an asset to whatever court she marries into,\" said Melville. Anne would be impressive as a Queen of Scotland but Kathryn would do just as fine. Though since Anne was the eldest and she had no brother as yet, she was the future heir of the throne of England and most likely she was to remain an asset of the English court alone. \"Yes, she will be an asset. Anyway, enough about the princesses how is the King, my godson and my future son-in-law?\" asked Elizabeth, curious to see how the infant King was. \"He is well indeed. His mother however has escaped from Loch Leven Castle,\" said Melville, Elizabeth then nodded for him to continue. \"She asks, as she is your cousin, that she may reside in England until...well your majesty, I convey this letter written by her own hand.\" Elizabeth took the letter and read through. \"Tell my dearest cousin that she may come to court, there are rooms at her disposal and since she is no threat to me and only wishes her title back, I see it as no problem,\" said Elizabeth, she knew her advisers, especially Cecil and Walsingham, would frown against such an idea but she was family and she was willing to help her, as long as she intended not to steal her crown. Elizabeth was lucky that she didn't have to spend any more time with the envoy as she wanted to spend time with her daughter's, the precious jewels of England. She had asked for the seamstress to come in today and measure the girls for new gowns. Kathryn sat quietly with her doll as her sister, Anne, was first being measured. Anne looked up at her mother and Elizabeth had to disguise her laugh as she did not want to upset her daughter but she couldn't help it, that look was priceless. \"What is the matter, Anne?\" asked Elizabeth, still trying to disguise her laugh. Anne just shook her head. \"Why do they take so long? Why can't the dresses be made now?\" asked the impatient little girl. Elizabeth was proud of her daughter but she still needed to learn how to hold her tongue. Elizabeth bent down to Anne's level. \"The seamstresses cannot just magically click their fingers; you need to be patient as they take their time doing a good job on your dress.\" Elizabeth gave a sympathetic smile towards the seamstress who smiled back at her shyly. Suddenly, Catherine Knollys came rushing towards Elizabeth. \"Your majesty, the King Consort is here.\" She had heard about the argument between them and did not want to upset Elizabeth by just letting him walk on in the room without consent. Elizabeth nodded and within the minute, Robert came walking in the room. Kathryn looked up at her father with a wide smile. He picked up his three year old daughter and kissed her cheek. \"I see that you are being measured for some dresses, have you picked any colours yet Kitty?\" asked the proud father. Elizabeth noticed the close bond those two shared, just like she shared one with Anne. Of course, she liked to consider herself close to both of her daughters but she knew, deep down, that she was closer to Anne. It was probably because at the time of Kathryn's birth, she had neglected her for a few days and then she came down with that dreaded smallpox. Those were so many days that she could not get back with her daughter. She regretted it now but there was nothing she could truly do about. Kathryn shook her head at her father. \"I have not picked a colour yet, Papa. Do you want to choose one?\" she asked. Robert put a finger to lips. \"I don't think I make the best choices on colours do I now. Maybe you should ask one of the other ladies to help you.\" Still in her father's arms, she nodded to him. Her elder sister looked at her with deep brown eyes, wanting to suggest something. \"Anne, what colour?\" asked Kathryn to her eager sister. Anne jumped away from the seamstress and ran over to the colours. Elizabeth was amused but her enthusiasm. \"Kitty, why don't you wear this colour?\" suggested Anne, pointing towards a deep red colour that suited Anne's complexion more than it did Kathryn's. Kathryn suited lighter tones while Anne suited the darker tones. Kathryn obviously knew this plus she wasn't one for large dynamic colours. She preferred to have a simple style. She screwed up her face real tightly which displeased Anne for a moment before she went back to the seamstress. Kathryn looked around and noticed her governess, Lady Douglas Sheffield, sitting down doing needlework next to Lady Knollys. \"Douggie,\" said Kathryn, using Douglas nickname. \"What do you think?\" Douglas smiled at her small charge and then looked over to the fabrics. \"Why not a nice green colour? It would suit you nicely and it is the Tudor colour is it not?\" Kathryn thought about the choice, it was one thought but she wanted to hear from the person she thought was best suited for choosing colours, as she always dressed the best, her mama. \"Mama, why do you think?\" asked the little girl with wide eyes. Elizabeth smiled at her child. She walked over to the table which had an array of fabric choices laid out upon it. She looked through the colours and found a nice, light blue colour. \"Why not this colour,\" she said pointing towards the fabric. Kathryn nodded. She was yet to have a gown in that colour and even though she knew that she wasn't as enthusiastic about clothes as Anne was, she did enjoy the process. Kathryn held out her arms then for her mama to take her. Elizabeth walked over and took the child off of her husband's hands. \"You will be too heavy for me to carry much longer,\" noticed Elizabeth. Kathryn shook her head at this. \"I will never be too heavy to be held, mama.\" Elizabeth laughed. She wasn't about to argue with her youngest daughter. Elizabeth was glad though that Kathryn chose her choice over the others. Robert continued to stare at Elizabeth and it made her slightly uneasy. She motioned for him to follow her into her bedroom, out of the prying eyes that lay within the outer chamber. \"We need to talk about the other night,\" whispered Elizabeth. Robert nodded. \"I am sorry. I acted foolishly and I ask for your forgiveness.\" Elizabeth almost had to laugh. She wasn't about to left him off the hook that easily. She wanted a straight answer from him, not something that she wanted to hear. \"No, you will tell me what really is the matter for how am I to know what truly is in your heart?\" \"Elizabeth, I overreacted. It is strange for a man not to have to upper hand and I guess that it got the better of me. If you'll excuse me,\" said Robert before exiting the Queen's room's altogether. Sometimes she just wished that he would give her a plan and simple answer. AN: Yay! Finally the chapter is written. I hope you enjoyed that.

Anyway... on with the next instalment and remember to review at the end. [Anonymous reviews can now be written]. DISCLAIMER: I do not own the following [The Tudors, The Virgin Queen, The Other Boleyn Girl, Elizabeth, Elizabeth The Golden Age, Elizabeth I]. They all belong to their respective owners. Chapter Twelve 18 th May 1568 Elizabeth lit the candle and opened the door. She could not believe that she had been asked for an audience in the middle of the night. She had convinced Robert to stay in bed while she went to discuss whatever Cecil and Walsingham wanted to talk to her about, most likely to do with her cousin Mary. She hurried along the corridor to Cecil's rooms. She pulled her robe closer together and looked around to make sure no one was following her. She finally made it to Cecil's rooms and there stood Cecil at his usual position, behind his desk, and Walsingham at his, staring deep into the burning fire. Cecil looked up at the Queen as she entered. \"Your majesty,\" he said while nodding his head. \"Sir Walsingham has news.\" Elizabeth was annoyed; surely this news could wait until morning. Tomorrow was Anne's birthday and there were still some things to prepare early in the morning. \"I hope your news is worthy of arousing me from my slumber, Sir Francis.\" Francis nodded towards the Queen, \"Your majesty, I must advise you from letting your cousin, Mary from entering London. She is the Catholic's heir to your throne and she would get rid of you to put herself in your place.\" Elizabeth shook her head, \"Sir Francis, do not speak of matters that do not concern you.\" Francis sighed; it would be harder to convince Elizabeth than he thought. He knew it was a foolish mistake to let Mary of Scotland into court. \"Your majesty, you must listen to reason. Do you want your daughter's rightful way to the throne filled with bloodshed?\" \"Sir Francis, Mary has written nothing but blessings towards my daughters. If she poses a threat, I will deal with her. For now though, I wish to go back to sleep for if you don't remember it is Anne's birthday tomorrow and there is still a lot to prepare.\" Elizabeth walked back to her chamber in a huff. Francis and Cecil looked at each other. They could see the threat Mary of Scotland posed towards the English crown, so why couldn't Elizabeth?\" 19 th May 1568 Lady Knollys was having a difficult time with Anne today. Since it was her birthday, and the day she would be given the title of Princess of Wales, Anne thought she was above everyone and could order them around. In a way, Anne wanted to be like her mother, a ruler, but of course she only had her household to order but Lady Knollys was in charge of that because she was still to young. Anne thought she could handle it running a household but Lady Knollys always told her she was just a little girl and that job was for the big people. Anne didn't think so. Kathryn and Alice were sitting with their dolls as they watched their sister being difficult for Lady Knollys. Lady Sheffield was glad that her charge was the younger of the Princesses; Anne could be a terror at times. Everyone in the room looked up as they heard the door open. Robert walked in alone; as Elizabeth had something she needed to do beforehand. He walked over to Kathryn and Alice first and kissed them both on the head. Anne crossed her arms. She couldn't believe that he would go to them first on her birthday. Robert turned around and looked at his daughter, who was now six years old. He couldn't believe how fast the time had gone. He had to laugh at Anne. She had the temper of a Tudor that was for sure. \"What's the matter Anne,\" said Robert in a sarcastic manner. He held his arms out to her and she ran to him. She looked up at him and smiled. Robert then looked at Lady Knollys face which was one of distress. \"You are not being trouble for Lady Knollys are you?\" asked Robert. Anne looked back and forth at the two as if they could speak through their minds. Lady Knollys was quick to defend Anne, she didn't want to seem as she was unfit for her rank and position. \"No, Your Majesty, her highness is perfectly fine. She is just a little excited over today's proceedings.\" Anne smiled and nodded towards Robert. Robert wasn't entirely convinced though, Anne could play at her parent's hearts easily, especially her mother, and she used it to her advantage. \"Anne, you must promise to do as Lady Knollys tells you. You may have a title that is grander than hers but she only does what she does out of care for you. Do you understand?\" \"Yes Papa,\" said Anne, as she nodded her head. \"I promise to listen to Lady Knollys but.\" She paused for a second, she wanted to make sure she sounded the sweetest that she could. \"I do not want to wear the yellow dress; I want to wear my new blue dress!\" Robert sighed. Only yesterday did Anne say she wanted to wear the yellow dress. \"Okay, you may wear the blue dress for the morning's festivities but maybe you could wear the yellow dress for the joust.\" Anne nodded and then ran out of Robert's arms and ran to her ladies that were to dress her. As they went into the adjacent room with the sapphire blue dress in their arms, Lady Knollys followed. Robert stood up for a second and walked over to his other daughters. He knelt in front of them and Kathryn ran into his arms like Anne had done. Alice stood back though. Her mother, even though she was tough at times, always reminded her of her place. She may be honoured with being recognised by her father she should not flaunt the fact that she was a half-sister to the heirs to the throne. Robert wished that Alice would be more relaxed in his presence. Sometimes he wished that Frances wasn't given free reign over the way their daughter was brought up. \"Alice, do you not want to hug your papa?\" asked Robert. Kathryn smiled at Alice and so Alice stood up slowly and walked over to him. Every time he visited it was like this and it took awhile for Alice to feel comfortable. It was her first year or so of life that made her like this. Maybe one day she would be able to break free from the restraint that was her so-called mother. The councillors had gathered without the knowledge of the Queen. This was a matter that was too personal when it needed to be political. The King Consort had been asked to attend as at least one of the 'royal' couple should be sitting in on this matter; it was about Princess Anne after all. \"Should we deal with her English suitors first or the foreign?\" asked the Earl of Sussex. \"We are not all in attendance,\" said Cecil, pointing towards Dudley's chair. How convenient? He thought. He wasn't a fan of Dudley; he had disagreed with the marriage from the absolute start. Maybe the Duke of Norfolk wasn't as stupid as he first thought as he had suggested to hold this meeting on the Princess Anne's birthday. \"If Robert Dudley cannot grace us with his presence we proceed without him,\" said Norfolk. He was thinking the exact same thing that Cecil was thinking, which added to his already massive ego. Cecil sighed. Even though he had a slight dislike for how high Dudley had risen and the scandal that he brought to the throne thanks to his previous marriage, he hated the Duke of Norfolk more. He started to go on about the possible prospects for the Princess's hand in marriage and who should be added to the list. Without a male heir, it made the job more difficult as this Princess was not just a Princess but heir to the throne as well. This had not been as difficult with Kathryn as it was with Anne. \"Shouldn't we be considering who the Queen would like for her daughters hand?\" asked Cecil, who was more loyal to the Queen then all of the rest put together. \"This is about state politics,\" replied Norfolk. \"Not the whims of a woman, sovereign or not, her judgement cannot be relied upon. Isn't her ill chosen marriage to Dudley proof of that?\" Norfolk sighed as the rest kept their heads held low. \"What advantage is there in a domestic union? Any English man we choose could cause descent and division between the country, no, foreign match is the one.\" They started to then discuss the possible foreign candidates for Anne's hand. Many ambassadors were sure to be here today to give birthday wishes to the Princess and congratulate her on her new title. Anne, when a brother was still on the horizon, had been offered to the future Holy Roman Emperor but with the lack of a male heir to the English throne, they didn't want the two countries to unite, England was to stand on its own. They had finally come to a conclusion. \"Then it is France, do we have an agreement?\" asked the Duke of Norfolk. \"Shouldn't we now recommend our preferences to the Queen my lord,\" said Cecil in return. It was useless trying to arrange the match if Elizabeth was to be against it. \"She should accept our recommendation Sir William, to do otherwise flaunts our authority\" replied back Norfolk. \"We have a chance to end this retched petticoat government, my lords, let us seize it. Subject to negotiation, Princess Anne will marry the Duke of Alencon, agreed.\" All of the lords raised their hands. \"Well let this be a gift for the Princess from the council on this most special day,\" said Norfolk before leaving. It was obvious that Cecil was to tell Elizabeth as he was her secretary. He thought that it would probably be best to leave it till the next day; Elizabeth deserved to have a happy day with her two daughters. Robert was now back with Elizabeth and she had requested that her daughters and Alice come to her rooms. Robert was glad that Elizabeth took an interest in Alice, even though they were not of the same blood. Elizabeth and Robert were sitting at a small desk with two chairs placed on either side of it. Elizabeth's ladies and Robert's gentlemen were standing to the side. Elizabeth started tapping her fingers and everyone knew that she was becoming impatient. Not a minute later, old Kat Ashley came walking towards them. Elizabeth had suggested that she take leave to one of her country estates but Kat wouldn't budge, she felt that she had a duty to be a lady-in-waiting to Elizabeth. Kat smiled at them both. \"Your majesty, Princess Anne and Kathryn and the Lady Alice are here,\" she said before bowing and moving to the side to where the other ladies stood. As Anne and Kathryn came through the door, Elizabeth bent down. Both girls ran towards their mother who embraced them in a hug. Robert put his hand across his face to hide the smile that grew. He looked over to the door where Lady Sheffield stood. Alice still had Douglas hold her hand. He could see that Alice longed to run over there as well, since she never had this scene ever with her own mother. Elizabeth noticed this as well and looked up towards Alice. Alice tried to put on a smile for Elizabeth. Alice knew that to stay in favour of her step-mother, she had to make sure to do everything right, that is what her mother had said. Elizabeth motioned for Alice to come over to the three of them. Anne and Kathryn looked at each other, the liked Alice and Kathryn liked that her mother was taking an interest in her but Anne was more wary, for a girl of only six years she could work things out quite easily. For some reason she didn't trust this. As Alice finally reached them, Elizabeth smiled again. She knew how tough Frances Luke was with her daughter and if she could, she would be a kind mother figure to this little girl. After Anne had received her gifts from her parents and some of the Queen's ladies, as they had made some dresses for the Princess, she went back to her room to change into her yellow dress. She thought she would look nice in it for the joust. Alice and Kathryn felt no need to change their dress; they were not as vain as Anne could be. The stand for the joust had been set up and Anne and Kathryn were to sit on smaller thrones to either side of Elizabeth and Robert's. As Alice was only an illegitimate royal, she had to stand with her own mother. Lady Sheffield was standing close by and kept a watchful eye on Francis, she didn't want things to get out of hand. Robert was not sitting on his throne though as he was to participate in the joust. As he walked over to his wife and daughters he put the lance up on the railing. Anne and Kathryn had been given favours to give out today and both were very excited. Robert had let Kathryn put her favour on his lance for her birthday earlier in the year so it was only fitting that Anne could put her favour on his lance today. The joust went off without a hitch and the two princesses enjoyed it immensely. Elizabeth was nervous about tonight. Mary, the former Queen of Scots and her cousin was to come to court. Thankfully, Anne's ceremony had been postponed till tomorrow because of it but Elizabeth was still nervous. Her cousin was a Queen but a Queen without a crown. It was night time and a banquet was being held. Some of the courtiers danced as others ate and drank ale and wine. Francis was drinking her fair share after handing her daughter back to one of the governesses; Francis wasn't sure which one she was. Robert was holding Kathryn as they went around and talked to the courtiers. All of the courtiers that sought after even more favour commented on how pretty the younger Princess was and Kathryn kindly nodded and thanked them. She wasn't one for putting on a big show. Anne, meanwhile, was sitting with Elizabeth and had the courtiers coming up to her and commenting the same things that they were telling Kathryn. Anne put on more of a show about it than Kathryn did. Elizabeth smiled as the courtiers made the comments but was not easily fooled by them. Suddenly, as the courtiers were dancing, the music stopped. The room went silent and her name was called. \"Mary, Queen of Scotland.\" The courtiers made way for her as Robert made his way back to his place beside his wife. He placed Kathryn down on her throne and Anne sat down on hers beside her mother. The room was still utter silent as Mary made her way towards her cousin and her family. In a way, Mary was jealous that Elizabeth had a court bowing to her and that she had her family beside her. All Mary wanted to do was go back to Scotland, reclaim her throne and hold her little boy in her arms. All she could do now was find salvage in the pity from her cousin, the Queen of England. AN: Sorry for such a terribly short chapter. It isn't the greatest piece I have written but we all have those moments. Anyway, not going to bore you with my authors note just remember to review and thank you to the ones that constantly do. I promise to get a better more enjoyable chapter up soon. TBC[Chapter 14] AN: I am so sorry for not updating sooner. Been Busy with school but now I am back. I think this is a pretty short chapter but it is the start of some 'hopefully' interesting story lines that are yet to come. It kind-of rounds things off in this chapter but a lot of new things await. I won't keep you reading this terrible author's not any longer. (Okay just a little longer. I want to thank everyone that has reviewed, favourited or alerted to this story. It is great to know that there are people actually reading this). Also, Finally the Frances drunken scene is in this chapter but closer to the end, it fit better that way. It probably could have been better but oh well. Please review and enjoy DISCLAIMER: I own nothing. I do not own The Tudors, any of The Elizabeth Movies or The Virgin Queen. Chapter Thirteen 20 May 1568 The wind was harsh out but it was warmer than it would have been in Scotland, so Mary didn't mind that much. Her mind wasn't really on the weather either. Her mind kept drifting back to last night and the reception, no, the lack of reception was given for her arrival back at court. She knew that it was the Princess Anne's birthday yesterday but Elizabeth had told her to come on that day. Mary had waited for days to arrive at court, staying at houses for three days before she was welcomed. Maybe it was so Elizabeth didn't have to talk to her? She could use the excuse of wanting to spend time with her daughter to her advantage. Mary sighed. She was a Queen or in some people's eyes she was a Queen. She had lost the crown of France due to her husband dying and now she had lost the crown of Scotland as well and it looked like the crown of England was just too hard for her to grab. She was merely a Queen without a crown but she would have one again she told herself. She was sure that Elizabeth would help her in retrieving the throne of Scotland. Mary, for the short time she had lived in Scotland, especially in comparison to France, missed her home dearly, or more so what was left behind in it. Her poor little boy had been made motherless by the hungry Scottish Protestant courtiers who want her out. They hated Bothwell and they hated her because of Darnley's death. She knew that she had nothing to do with it but they wouldn't listen. They didn't care when she had told one in confidence that Bothwell and raped her and forced her to marry her. She should have said no was what the man said. How could she? She was just a mere woman. They didn't understand as they were only men. Hopefully she would have an ally in Elizabeth and if not she could wreak havoc on this court by the help of her Catholic supporters. Mary continued to walk through the English Queen's garden with her two closest ladies, Mary Fleming and Mary Seton. She had other ladies but she had let the others off for the day. There was no need. They should enjoy and prepare themselves for Princess Anne's special day, the day she was to become Princess of Wales in name. In truth, Mary was surprised that Elizabeth was giving Anne this title; it was like Elizabeth was giving up hope in ever having a son. No matter what she thought of Elizabeth and the fact that she thought that she herself should be Queen of England, as a true Catholic heir, she never wished for her cousin to never know the joy of holding a little boy in your arms. Mary had heard though that Elizabeth had miscarried of a son, it was in the aftershock of seeing her husband with another woman. It was easy for her to work out who that woman was for a bastard had been created by the union. Mary Seton quietly walked up to her mistress and tapped her on the shoulder. \"Your Majesty,\" she said, calling her by the title that a true Queen should be called. \"His grace, the Duke of Norfolk is here.\" Mary Seton quickly curtsied and went back to stand next to Mary Fleming while the Duke of Norfolk walked up to the Scottish Queen. \"Your Majesty,\" said Norfolk, bowing almost to the ground. \"It is an honour to have an audience with you.\" Mary held out her hand, quite happy that this handsome gentleman was pleased to be in the presence of herself, waiting for Norfolk to kiss it. He brushed his lips quickly on her hand. He didn't want rumours flying around about Queen Mary; she already had the issue of Darnley's death against her good name. Mary smiled at Norfolk and gestured for him to stand up. \"Your grace, why do you seek an audience with me?\" Norfolk smiled at the Queen and gestured for her to keep walking. She walked slowly, why did Thomas Howard wish to speak with her? Surely he would want to seek favour with England's Queen; she could surely grant you more. \"I am sure you have heard of the rifts that some of the good people of England have had against... Robert Dudley.\" Norfolk couldn't stand to call the son of a traitor 'his majesty'. Mary looked at him puzzled. These rifts had happened quite early on in the marriage, within the first few months. No one ever spoke of them now and Elizabeth didn't even seem to take any of it into consideration. Her husband had been accused of killing his now long-passed first wife, Amy Robsart, just like she was being accused of aiding in her second husband's murder. These rumours eventually blew over, much to the dismay of a few different courtiers Mary was told, and she married her favourite. They say she was so blissfully in love with him and that he told her that 'they were destined to be together', that is when she asked him to marry her. The English people seemed to have forgotten it especially when the two Princesses were born. They may only be women but they had Tudor blood and Elizabeth was a capable ruler and if they had any fire of Elizabeth in them, they would surely be capable rulers to. Mary especially hoped for this in Princess Kathryn as was to be Queen Consort of Scotland someday, a betrothal to her son was already made and she hoped that England or Scotland never break it. \"Your grace, these rifts were a long time ago,\" said Mary in a hushed whisper. She needed Elizabeth's help in reclaiming her own true throne. She was intelligent no matter what some people thought. \"Your grace, I see that you still hold some grudges against His Majesty.\" Mary knew to use Dudley's proper title, even if Norfolk did not. \"Robert Dudley is the son and a brother of a traitor, he has no right to sit on the throne of England as a Consort or as the father to the heir of the English throne. In truth, if I do speak plainly, Anne and Kathryn are no true heirs. Milady, you are the only heir to the English throne, a true Catholic Queen of royal blood, not the bastard like Elizabeth is. You must let me help you to claim your throne.\" Mary was shocked. Anyone could be hiding in the bushes, listening to her conversation. \"Your Grace, I will take your words into consideration but nothing more.\" She nodded towards Norfolk and to her ladies to follow her as she walked ahead. Norfolk was left standing there. He was sure that Mary would turn around and see his ways. If couldn't stand the thought of honouring Dudley with titles he didn't deserve any longer. He wanted to see Dudley thrown away like a dirty piece of garbage. Lady Douglas laughed at the mischief little Princess Anne got herself into. Today was a special day for her; it was her day that she was officially created England's heir. Queen Elizabeth had ordered that a special gown be made for her six year-old daughter. It was made of beautiful cloth of gold and incrusted with pearls. It was by far the greatest dress that Anne had ever been given or that Lady Douglas had ever seen. Fortunately for herself, it was not she that had to prepare Anne for today but that was the job of Lady Knollys and Anne's other various ladies-in-waiting. Anne could be quite troublesome but in front of her parent's, Anne could do no wrong. Lady Knollys always tried to teach the girl better manners but as far Douglas could see, the problem wasn't in manners as Anne already excelled in them but was the fact that she had been spoiled, especially being the eldest child of the sovereign and of course future Queen of England. If she had a little brother she thought that she would be better behaved and show more respect to Lady Knollys. Douglas was thankful that her charge was little Kathryn. She had taken on little Alice as well as her own mother seemed to not care for her and Elizabeth and Frances had both placed her here. Douglas didn't mind though. They were both to well behaved girls, always saying their manners and using the right etiquette. They never tried to use their position in life to get anything they wanted; they knew that if they wanted something, it would have to be through good behaviour, not just ordering that it be done. Lady Knollys had resorted to yelling at the child and once hitting her but Anne seemed to take it all in stride. She was rather precocious and Douglas was sure that it was something she would grow out of. She hid her laughter however when Kathryn shook her head at her elder sister's antics. Anne was arguing with Lady Knollys over how to do her hair. Anne wanted her hair in a hood but Lady Knollys was under strict instructions to place the hair either out or in a bun, the only ways that the hair would be neat while still having the crown placed on her head. \"Kitty, what is the matter?\" asked Douglas. In private, Kathryn had permitted Douglas to use her nickname. She didn't like being called your highness all the time, Anne was called that to. It was like the people they met didn't even know their names. \"Anne creates such a fuss for nothing,\" said Kathryn, looking quite solemn. Douglas could see that Kathryn wished that some attention would be placed on herself but she resorted to just being the other Princess. \"It is her special day,\" said Douglas while fixing the last bits of Kathryn's hair. Her blonde hair was pulled into a loose bun with a diadem placed around it, with only a few small curls of hair framing the sides of her face. \"But Douggie, everyday is her special day. I know jealousy is a sin but I want one day to be my special day. Anne even gets better celebrations for her birthday,\" Kathryn said while a small tear formed in her eye. Douglas held out her arms and Kathryn wrapped her small arms around Douglas's neck. Douglas patted her small charge on the back, trying to soothe her. \"Don't worry Kitty, your day will come. You are to be married to the King of Scotland don't your remember? Anne will not have as grand a betrothal as yours, do you hear? You will have a whole court for you to plan eventually and a loving husband.\" Kathryn smiled. She couldn't wait to be Queen like her mother. She already knew that her mother and eventually Anne held more power of the realm than she could, in fact she would be like her beloved papa and in truth, and she couldn't wait. Anne, for once in her short six year old life, felt extremely nervous. She was used to greeting ambassadors with her mother and had, from birth, been paraded around and admired by the courtiers of her mother's court but this time the attentions of everyone's eyes would be on her. She breathed in as the doors were opened and she saw her mother and father, who stood a bit behind her mother, smiling towards her and that gave her a small amount of confidence. She walked forward gracefully towards her mother who was sitting on her grand throne. The courtiers smiled towards their small heir and bowed towards her which in turn had lifted her confidence. She continued to walk down the room and she recognised a few people. There was Sir Walsingham and Sir Cecil standing near the front of the large assembly of people. Anne truly believed that these two men never smiled. Anne also saw her sister and half sister standing with Lady Sheffield in front of the whole assembly of people watching on. The Scottish ambassador, Sir James Melville was also standing in the crowd and was standing next to the lady that came to her birthday celebrations, Mary. Anne then reached the place where she was to kneel. She gracefully knelt down in front of her mother and her ladies stepped back into the crowd. A herald stood next to Elizabeth chair and opened a large patent. Anne looked up towards the man and smiled, which he returned with a slight nod. The man coughed before he would start speaking. \"To all and singular, as well as nobles and gentiles, as others to whom these presents shall come,\" he stated in a clear voice. \"It is the Queen's pleasure by this patent to confer on the Princess Anne, daughter of her majesty, Queen Elizabeth and his majesty, Robert Dudley, King Consort of England, in her own right, the royal title of Princess of Wales. And also by this patent she will henceforth be heir to the English throne.\" Elizabeth stood off her throne and walked towards her eldest daughter. She helped her daughter stand up and then a young boy walked over to them, carrying a crown made to recognise Anne is the Princess of Wales. It was placed on her head and Anne smiled at her mother. Robert moved forward and took Elizabeth's hand. They walked through the crowd of courtiers that had parted for them to make their way through. Another herald then cleared his voice, \"Her majesty the Queen, his majesty the King Consort and her highness, Princess Anne of England, the Princess of Wales.\" Everyone clapped for their new heir. It would have been better, most of them thought, that the heir was a boy but they would do with a girl. Many courtiers already were instructing their sons to become friends with the Princess, and eventually to learn to rule through her. Frances Luke and Christopher Hatton were back in his chambers. They sat down across from each other at a small table. Christopher was becoming concerned with Frances. All she was doing was drinking ale and then laughing and then drinking some more ale. Frances smiled at Christopher. She did not mind being his mistress but he was an unmarried man who had favour with the royal couple. He should want to marry to produce legitimate offspring to inherit his fortune once he had passed away. In truth, Frances thought she was the best candidate. But for the moment, she didn't want to discuss the matter with Christopher; she just wanted to get drunk. \"You know Christopher; the celebrations for the brat of a princess were fantastic, especially the ale,\" said Frances while laughing her head off. Christopher was certain that if the Queen heard her say that remark about the Princess, both his and Frances's heads would be struck from their bodies. He quickly moved around to her side of the table and tried to pick Frances up and take her to their bedroom so she could sleep. Frances wouldn't have that though and pulled her arm out of his grasp. She stood up shakily, the ale already going straight to her head, and she shook her head. \"Don't touch me Christopher, you touch me too much, this is why I am like this.\" Christopher didn't understand. What in the world was Frances going on about? What had he done to her that 'made her' a drunk? Wasn't that her own choice? \"Frances, I don't understand. What in the world is wrong?\" Frances stared into his deep brown eyes for a second. \"I am with child Christopher,\" Frances replied, almost spitting out the words. \"I am with your child.\" Christopher just stood there dumbfounded. He was to be a father? He couldn't believe it. Before he could respond to Frances comment however, she was dead asleep, lying across their bed. 21 May 1568 Robert had invited his good friend, Christopher, to walk with him in the gardens. It seemed like an eternity since they last discussed various topics, including the women of their lives. They started to make their way to the fountain in the middle of one of the vast gardens at Whitehall. \"Tell me, how is your Frances?\" said Robert. Everyone knew that Robert and Frances had once been lovers but that didn't mean that they hated each other, well on Robert's part that is. For some strange reason, and if that meant being with Christopher then he was all for it. \"She is fine,\" said Christopher in a sullen mode, Frances had refused to talk to him this morning. \"In fact, she is with child.\" \"Ah, you are happy together and yet you haven't asked her to marry you Christopher,\" said Robert punching lightly his friends shoulder. Christopher smiled at Robert. \"Robert, that is something that I wish to speak with you about. I ask for your blessing that I take Frances as my wife. I want my children with her to be legitimate.\" \"Well then you better make the wedding soon. I give my blessing. In fact, I am sure even Elizabeth will give her blessing as she knows I would never sleep with a married woman, not that I would go back to Frances. I happy with my wife now, surprisingly so,\" said Robert smiling. It seemed that everything was going to be alright in everyone's live except the one fact that kept annoying and nagging him. He wasn't able to father a son, legitimate or a bastard. AN: Okay, so there it was another chapter. Hopefully you can see some things emerging from this chapter and also if there are any characters you would like to see more of or more certain couples more in the story or next chapter, feel free to review. Also, Anne's ceremony for her new title, I based it off Anne Boleyn's Marquess of Pembroke ceremony in The Tudors. I seriously did not know how to write it so I was kind of putting it off. Anyway.... please review, tell me your thoughts. The next chapter will hopefully be up soon. TBC[Chapter 15] AN: Okay so I haven't updated this story in a long time. I am trying to go an update all of my stories. This chapter is really short, this is why I couldn't call it a chapter. This 'Interlude' is dedicated to our little Princesses, Anne & Kathryn. This is only a short update of the story but hopefully a full length chapter will be up soon. I would like to thanks all of those people who have reviewed, favourited and alerted this story so far. I hope that you continue to read this story and I hope to get back into the swing of updating this story. Thanks for reading and don't forget to review, all your reviews do make writing this story even more enjoyable. Disclaimer: I do not own any movie/TV show containing Elizabeth or any other historical characters. Interlude: Princesses Parted 13 June 1568 The Welsh people loved their Princess of Wales. She was always charming in public and her youthful beauty was admired by many. Anne had been trained to be the perfect princess from birth, even if her governess thought she was anything but perfect. Anne had some different opinions about Wales all together. She hated it. She had been in Wales for a couple of weeks and she already felt miserable. Her friends weren't to be sent to for another week so all she had for a companion was Lady Knollys. It wasn't like she hated Lady Knollys, she was actually glad that she was her governess; it was just that she was always wanting to teach her about manners and etiquette. She was only six years old she wanted to remind Lady Knollys, and six years want to play games and have fun. She also hated being so far away from her sisters and her parents. Even though her parents hadn't been around all the time, as her parents were very busy, something that Lady Knollys like to remind her on a daily basis, she still saw them very often, her mama or papa would come at least once every two to three weeks or they would come to court regularly for visits. There was none of that at Ludlow, she hadn't seen her parents since she left court and that was three weeks ago! She also hated that Kathryn and Alice were not around. Even though Kitty and Alice sometimes got on her nerves, like all little sisters do, she still loved Kitty and Alice and enjoyed having them around, especially at lesson time, and especially lesson times when Lady Knollys was ill or away and they both shared Lady Douglas as she would give them sweet meats or candies. Lady Knollys never let her have any of these; she always said that it wasn't good from a growing girl's digestion. So now she was stuck in a place that loved her but she hated it. She couldn't believe that her mother would want her living unhappy. Even the palace, thought Anne, was less magnificent that Hatfield even though it was to be the over way around. Even though she was looking forward to being Queen of England someday, just like her mama, she sometimes wished she had a brother, a brother who was heir to the Kingdom and therefore had to suffer Ludlow Castle. Her parents had accepted her as the heir to the throne though; they must have doubted that they were to ever have a son. Lady Knollys had always told her to pray for her mother to become quick with child, to produce a male heir for the Tudor Dynasty. Anne thought it was strange that Lady Knollys would make her pray for someone that was going to usurp her own position but she prayed for it anyway as she knew a son would make her mama very happy. She just wished that she didn't have to pray at Ludlow. Mary, the exiled Queen of Scots, was making her way over to Hatfield, to see her goddaughter and future daughter-in-law, Princess Kathryn. Mary wanted to be a part of the little girl's life, especially when she viewed that Elizabeth took less interest in Kathryn but more in Anne, the future Queen of England. As future Queen Consort of Scotland, Mary wanted to be an influence on the little girl's life. She would be able to visit Kathryn more than Elizabeth could and she hoped that little Kathryn would view Mary as a mother figure, especially when she couldn't be a mother figure to her own little boy, her precious little James. A least she had a son, a Prince for Scotland. Her son was the only thing she could say she had done to triumph over Elizabeth. To think that good Queen Bess was barren to producing sons made Mary smile. She knew that she shouldn't but she couldn't help it. She knew she shouldn't wish that on the fate of any woman but this wasn't any woman this was her rival. In any case, she soon arrived at Hatfield and before her was the Princess Kathryn. She was a pretty little thing, much the contrast to her elder sister Anne. She had light blonde hair, pale skin and dark brown eyes. She could see that this child was to grow to be a great beauty and she could tell that Scotland would be proud to call her their Queen. \"Your Grace,\" said Kathryn as she curtsied before her cousin, even though she did it slightly clumsily. Mary smiled at the young girl. It must be tough for the girl, she thought, as know she was the first lady of Hatfield. Usually she was second to Princess Anne but Anne was no longer there. \"Your highness,\" said Mary as she curtsied towards the Princess. \"I am glad that you could receive me as I do wish to get to know you.\" Kathryn smiled. She thought that Mary was a kind lady, especially if she came to see only her, no one ever came to see her, they would always come to see Anne as she was the heir, she knew that she was only the spare. Maybe things would be different know that Anne was gone. AN: Well that was the short update. I hope you enjoyed. It was good to get back into writing this story and I hope to have another update for you all soon. Please continue to review the story, all it takes is one push of a button and writing a few words. TBC[Chapter 16] AN: Welcome back to another chapter of Consort of Gloriana. I needed to get back in the swing of writing this story and half of the chapter was finished anyway so I decided to finish the chapter off. It is kind of short but I liked the way that I ended it. In any case, I would once again like to thank everybody that reviews, alerts or favourites this story or even just reads the story. It does mean a lot as I enjoy writing them and I am glad that you guys seem to be enjoying it as well. I won't keep you long as you might as well just read the chapter. WARNING: Princess Anne, Princess Kathryn and even Lady Alice do not have their own scene in this chapter. Just thought I would warn you though I don't know why. Thanks for reading DISCLAIMER: I do not own the Elizabeth story, the real or any of the fictional. Never have and never will. Chapter Fourteen 16 June 1568 It was only a false alarm. That was it seemed to be these days, more and more false alarms. Elizabeth had wanted so much to be pregnant, especially with a son, even though she had already invested Anne with the title of Princess of Wales, a right usually only given to the eldest male prince. But instead of a prince to fill her womb, her monthly course had come a week late and given Elizabeth false hope. She knew that she should be grateful to have such bright daughters such as Anne and Kathryn but she also knew that if she hadn't miscarried her son all those years back, he would be almost five years old. She knew that she shouldn't grieve for the son that no longer was nor ever would be, Anne was her heir and she was proud to call her that, even if her daughter was only six years old. Anne was perfect, and so was Kathryn. She always had to remind herself of what she had, not what she had lost. There had been a lot of things that she had lost in her life. She had been sent a report that Anne was doing well at Ludlow, but deep down she knew that Lady Knollys was lying to some degree. Anne wasn't good at hiding her emotions, something Elizabeth had to begrudgingly admit came from her side of the family, and she knew that her daughter wasn't happy about leaving for Ludlow and the temper tantrum she threw before leaving had reminded her something like what she would do when she was a young girl. She knew that Kathryn hadn't been happy about leaving for Hatfield without Anne. Even though her half-sister would be remaining with her, she knew that Kathryn liked having Anne around and vice-versa. Deep down Elizabeth knew that she should have kept them together. The only reason she had sent Anne to Ludlow was so she could show parliament and her own husband that Anne was the heir, and that no matter what her gender was, she was still to be regarded as such. She knew that they all hoped for her conceive a son, thinking it was a better choice as men should be the rulers but none of them would say it to her face. They all knew that she would come down on them like a tonne of bricks if they ever mentioned, especially when she herself was a woman and a quite capable ruler. Elizabeth thoughts were interrupted however when Cecil knocked on the door. Cecil had come to talk to her about something, something that parliament had discussed and decided upon a few weeks ago but with Elizabeth in the mood she was in, Cecil had avoided mentioning the subject to her, especially since it would also be a delicate one. It was to do with the betrothal of the Princess Anne. \"Your majesty, there is a matter I must discuss with you,\" said Cecil nervously. \"It concerns the future of the Princess Anne.\" Elizabeth turned around walked up closer to Cecil. \"My latest report from Lady Knollys said that Anne was doing well. Has she become ill?\" she said, panic throughout her whole voice. Cecil shook his head; this may be harder than I thought. \"No, your majesty, the Princess Anne is doing well as ever at Ludlow but I am to discuss her future, her adult future. At the time of the Princess's birthday, the council came together to discuss a match for your daughter and we came to a conclusive decision that it would be in England's best interest that Anne be betrothed to the Duke of Alencon.\" He could see Elizabeth's eyes go into a fury. How dare they betroth her daughter, her eldest daughter thought Elizabeth. \"Was my husband at this meeting? If I was not there surely he must have been there? The council would have only decided on who Anne should marry if one of us was present correct?\" \"No your majesty,\" said Cecil while looking downcast and shaking his head. \"Your husband was not in attendance.\" Elizabeth laughed. \"Then surely Cecil, the betrothal cannot go ahead for neither of us consented to the match.\" She suddenly became serious. \"If the council ever think to do so I will have all of their heads.\" With that she stormed out of the room but Cecil was quick on her trail. \"Your majesty,\" he called out as he followed her. \"You must consider the match. It would unite both England and France through marriage, they would be allies.\" Elizabeth stopped and Cecil handed her a paper, a contract for the betrothal. She looked down at it and sighed. \"I will have a look at it but I will not decide without talking to my husband. I respect his opinion as the council should but in the end it will be my decision. I want no further talk on the matter until I have decided.\" And with that she was off and leaving Cecil relieved that this encounter was over. Frances truly hated being pregnant. She hated it when she was pregnant with Alice and she hated it know but at least this child would not be branded illegitimate like Alice was. With her shot-gun wedding to Christopher her unborn child would at least be branded legitimate, even if it was conceived out of wedlock. In reality, she knew that Alice's position in life would probably be stronger due to her paternal relations but she would always be the child that came from the wrong side of the sheets. In any case, Frances wasn't enjoying being pregnant even though she was only a little over three months with child. She could already feel her corsets becoming tighter as her body turned into a whale and she wasn't sure if the child was causing it or the more food Christopher was forcing down her throat. And this child, she had to be more of a mother to it. Alice she was able to fish off onto Dudley but this time she couldn't do that. She would actually have to take care of the child and this actually made her quite nervous. She didn't know how to be a caring mother, an attentive mother. She had been strict with Alice all because she was the King Consort's daughter as well. She wanted her daughter to be respected as she deserved that much even though she didn't exactly have royal blood flowing through her veins. She was sister to the future Queen of England and the future Queen Consort of Scotland, this meant that she was to have a glorious future and if people didn't believe that actually did care for her daughter's future, she didn't care because she knew that she was looking out for her. Elizabeth was sitting down to dinner in the royal apartments with Robert. He was quietly eating away at the cold meats on his plate but he noticed that Elizabeth was paying great attention to what she was eating; she was only moving the food around her plate. \"There is obviously something on your mind Elizabeth,\" he said as he chewed another piece of meat. \"Just say it.\" Elizabeth sighed. \"Did you know that the council has already decided that Anne should be betrothed to the Duke of Alencon?\" Robert shook his head, chewing on a new piece of meat. \"It would be a good match for her,\" he said not directly answering the question he had been asked. \"You should be happy that are thinking about our daughter's future. I am sure that Catherine de Medici was not an easy one to organise matches with.\" Elizabeth shook her head. \"Don't you care; the council overruled our, my authority and made a decision without one of us present?\" Robert shook his head. \"They were thinking about the future of England.\" \"They should have been thinking about their necks.\" \"Elizabeth,\" he said gently taking her hand in his. \"You need not worry, Anne will need a grand match and the French royal family would do no better than having a Princess of English blood join their fold. If you are worried about distance, you should have betrothed Anne to the King of Scotland; we all know she is your favourite one anyway.\" Elizabeth snatched her hand away. \"That is not true,\" she said angrily. \"I love both of my daughters equally.\" Robert shook his head and smiled. \"Elizabeth you don't have to lie to me. I am a King and I pay close attention to how you treat our daughter.\" Elizabeth stood up now. \"No, you are not a King, you are only the King Consort. I am the Queen in this relationship. I am a Queen in my own right so do not tell me that you know what I am doing. I am the only one who truly knows what I do.\" Robert looked at her stunned. She hadn't yelled at him like this for a very long time. She wouldn't let him speak again. She couldn't, she didn't want to hear his replies. \"Get out,\" she said and when he didn't move she yelled, \"Get Out!\" He got up and slowly made his way to the door. Before he left, he turned around and bowed towards Elizabeth, \"Your majesty.\" Elizabeth didn't look at his gaze. She didn't want to. He needed to learn his place. She would have no master. AN: This was a bit of a short chapter but the next chapters will be longer and I must say I am suprised that I managed to do a whole chapter without even having Princesses in it though they are mentioned. I hope you like it. I am going to try and finish off some of my stories, I have just finished A Chance Not Worth Taking so the next on my list is this story so don't be suprised if this is getting updated on a more regular basis now. Once again, thank you to all that reviewed.... hope you can on this chapter as well. TBC[Chapter 17] AN: Welcome to another chapter of Consort of Gloriana. First of all I would like to thank once again everyone that has reviewed, alerted, favourite or even read the story. It does make me want to keep writing the story (though I probably would anyway). Also, this is another shortish chapter though future chapters will be longer (hopefully). I really want to finish this story and I seem to have a direction so it might get finished sooner than you think. In any case, I don't have much to ramble on about so..... I will let you read the next chapter of 'COG'. Thanks for reading :) Disclaimer: I do not own Elizabeth or any other Elizabeth movies. I never have and I never will. Chapter Fifteen 20 August 1568 Anne hadn't felt like doing any work today. She knew that she had the best tutors; in fact she knew that she always received the best of everything, but she just couldn't get her mind to work properly and it was all because of the gossip she had heard. She had overheard the servant talking about her parents. They had said that her mother, the Queen, was angry with her father and that he might end up the same way as the Queen's mother. Anne had heard little about her grandmother and namesake. She knew that her name was Anne Boleyn and that she had helped free England from the Church in Rome and she knew how she had died. She was executed by order of her grandfather, King Henry VIII. She knew that she didn't want her papa to end up that way. She didn't want to believe the gossip. She knew that her mother loved her father; otherwise they wouldn't have married and then had herself and Kathryn. She hoped that the rumours were not true. She was slightly spooked by them and she had no one to share her thoughts or voice her fears with. This was a time when she wished Kathryn was here. She would understand. She couldn't trust any of her companions with this information; she didn't trust them enough to do so. Even though she was young she knew that these other girl's that shared in her lessons could easily tell their own parents and she didn't want them to tell them lies that were hurtful. In the end, she needed to tell someone so when Lady Knollys was fixing her for bed that night she decided to bring up the matter. She knew that it needed to be resolved. \"Lady Knollys,\" she said in an inquisitive voice to gain her governesses attention after she had been put to bed. \"Yes, your highness,\" she said turning around as she blew out one of the candles in the room. Anne didn't know how to start, which was a rarity but she decided that she better just say it or it would be annoying her forever. \"Lady Knollys, I have heard some gossip that... my papa will end up like my grandmamma.\" Lady Knollys knew exactly what grandmother she was talking about. It was definitely not her father's mother, Jane Guildford but was her mother's mother, Anne Boleyn. \"I am sure that it is silly gossip and you know that you should not be eavesdropping on other people's conversations when you have not been invited to join.\" Anne nodded. \"I am sorry Lady Knollys. I just don't want to lose my papa.\" \"I am sure that he won't,\" said Lady Knollys as she blew out the last candle in the room and left Anne to let sleep wash over her. 21 August 1568 Mary was walking through the palace gardens with her ladies closely behind her. Her small dog, which was probably the most loyal creature to her, was walking happily a few feet in front of her. It was a nice day and she decided that she intended to enjoy it. She was walking peacefully when she noticed that Elizabeth, Queen of England, was walking ahead of her. She knew that she had to have a good relationship with her if she was ever to take the crown of Scotland again and to be able to hold her dear little son her arms once more. Mary was jealous that Elizabeth could summon her daughters whenever she wanted yet she wasn't able to even see her son once a year. When they both stood face to face with each other, they both bowed to each other. Elizabeth didn't know why she did, it wasn't like she had to but Mary was still an anointed Queen, she just didn't have a throne to sit on at the moment. \"Cousin,\" said Elizabeth smiling. \"Would you care take a walk with me?\" Mary nodded. Maybe it would be good to start a conversation. She could discuss what Elizabeth was planning on doing with the situation in Scotland or if she could arrange for her son to meet his betrothed, that way she could see him too. She needed to remind him that she loved him. They started to walk with each of their own ladies standing a bit of a distance from them to give the illusion of privacy for the two Queens. They walked for quite a few minutes silently, each not knowing when to start or where to start. \"Cousin,\" said Mary in asking tone. \"I have needed to ask you of my son, King James. I was wondering if you could make it possible to let me be able to see him. You could arrange a meeting between Kathryn and James, so they at least know each other.\" Elizabeth saw Mary's hopeful expression on her face. Elizabeth knew that she would be hated to be separated from her daughters without ever knowing if she would see them again. \"I will see what I can do,\" said Elizabeth tentatively. She didn't want to give Mary too much hope. \"I have heard that the Princess Anne will be betrothed to the Duke of Alencon,\" said Mary. Mary was happy that Anne was to be married to the French royal family. With this marriage, France and Scotland would be united once more through the blood of the two English Princesses. It also meant that Anne would technically become her sister-in-law as she was to marry the younger brother of her own first husband, Francis II of France. Elizabeth nodded. She had started to see some sense in the matter of Anne's betrothal. She knew that it wouldn't be long before Anne and Kathryn would marry and have heirs of their own and that made her slightly sad. Not because she would then be a grandmother but because it meant that her two darling girls would be older and not in as much need of their mother. She thought that it wouldn't be as hard with Anne, the Duke of Alencon as part of the betrothal contract would have to live in England. Kathryn would be more difficult. She knew that in all retrospect, her younger daughter wasn't moving to a country like Spain, which was far away, but as the future Queen of Scotland through marriage, she would have to move away to Scotland. She knew however that Kathryn would still be able to visit. Maybe it would be good for Kathryn to meet her betrothed before the actual marriage. She knew that the young Duke of Alecon, who was thirteen at the moment, was to visit England to meet his betrothed, as it stated in the contract so it was fitting the Kathryn meet James. Her mind was convinced on the matter now. Robert was still not in complete favour with Elizabeth. She had forgiven him for his views on the betrothal of Anne and the Duke of Alencon but she still didn't forgive him about his comments on her favouritism. Obviously no one had told her how Kathryn was feeling. He hadn't brought up the conversations that he had with Lady Sheffield, Kathryn's governess. She had told him that she had cried or complained several times that Anne was the favourite, that bigger celebrations were celebrated for her birthday and that Anne would be able to stay in England when she was older while she had to leave to marry someone she didn't even know. He wish he could either speak to Elizabeth, to make her realise, or to go and comfort Kathryn himself. He thought that Elizabeth was showing favouritism. Kathryn was always shy while Anne was more confident which was definitely a trait of Elizabeth. In fact, Anne could be almost seen as a little replica of Elizabeth's mother, Anne Boleyn. Maybe if Elizabeth went to visit Kathryn, his little girl would feel more loved and appreciated by her mother. It wasn't like Elizabeth meant it however. She did love both of her daughters but at Kathryn's birth, Elizabeth had been disappointed in the gender of the child as she had so wanted to present him, England and herself with a son. He was still pleased with Kathryn and when Elizabeth realised this, she had started to be more attentive to Kathryn. He still though some of those scars have rubbed off on Elizabeth's views of her younger daughter. In any case, he wasn't able to tell him all these reasons as to why he had said this. They would talk in public but they could hardly speak of such matters in front of the whole court and it wasn't like they could talk in private either. Elizabeth had refused him from eating with her in private or sharing their marital bed which was his conjugal right. He decided that it was best not to push Elizabeth by demanding for them. Instead, he had come up with a plan for his words to reach Elizabeth. He would have to court her like when they were younger however there was one catch: he had to ask one of her ladies to help. He decided that it would be Lettice Knollys. She was newly arrived back at court and after the death of Kat Ashley; her mother Catherine Knollys had been able to convince Elizabeth to move Lettice up from just being a maid of the privy chamber to a lady of the bedchamber. She was a perfect candidate. He had summoned him to his chambers, a risky move but a necessary one. After he had informed her everything she needed to know about the situation and what he was planning on doing, he asked, \"So will you help me.\" Lettice smiled her mischievous smile. \"It is very sweet,\" she said before she nodded. \"Alright, I will help you.\" She smiled again at him as she got up and walked for the door. She turned around as she held the door handle, ready to leave. \"I am happy to help you, your majesty,\" she then tilted her head. \"I am happy to help you with anything that you may ever need.\" AN: Aren't I bad? Well maybe if you picked up on that whole little hint of what is to come. In any case, I won't keep you much longer though I would once again like to thank everyone that reviews. I hope you enjoyed this latest installment and I hope that you did to. Don't forget to review! TBC[Chapter 18] AN: Welcome to yet another installment of Consort of Gloriana. This is a quick update though it is a short one. I would first of all like to thank once again everyone that has reviewed, alerted or favourited this story so far. It does mean a lot and I really do mean that. In any case, the next chapter will be a time-jump though it will be the last one for awhile because I have quite a few different story lines to close off and to open. I hope you enjoy this *short* chapter. Thanks for reading! Disclaimer: I do not own Elizabeth or any of the Elizabeth movies. I never have and I never will. Chapter Sixteen 7 September 1568 The sun's rays started to flitter through the window at sunrise and it immediately woke Elizabeth up. She looked over to the other side of the bed and sighed when she realised that things were still the same between them. Since the day they had been married, he had always held her in his arms on this day and wished her a happy birthday. Yes, today was her birthday she thought regrettably. And she had turned thirty-five today, another year passed and another year less that she would be able to have a son for England. She decided to wake up then and there and not try and fall back to sleep. She knew that she should probably just forgive her husband but she couldn't. She didn't want to believe that she was picking favourites between her daughters. And it wasn't like he had never done that, he had always gone out of his way for Alice. In any case, the thought of her children made her smile. Anne and Kathryn would be coming to court today but they would only be here for a couple of days before they had to return to their estates. It didn't matter however as being able to see her daughters for short visits was better than never seeing her daughters at all. She imagined that Kathryn would arrive first, as she lived closer by. Anne was travelling from Wales so it was a longer trip for her. Elizabeth was sure that Lady Knollys wasn't impressed with staying at the court for only a few days then returning, though she was sure that Anne was excited. Her ladies helped her get ready and she ate breakfast on her own before Lettice came forward. \"Your majesty,\" she said curtseying towards her. \"His majesty is here, he wishes a private audience with you.\" Elizabeth smiled. \"Very well,\" she said. They did need to talk. She knew that he had been seeing Lettice more often but she had heard that there was nothing romantic between them, that attendants stayed in the room when they were speaking. If she had believed it to be anything more she would have surely gotten angry. Lettice had also been trying to convince her that she should go and visit Kathryn more. She was sure that Robert had put her cousin up to it. She had told Lettice to let it go and she had so far. She just hoped that she didn't mention it again. Her ladies curtsied as she had them leave the room. They curtsied as Robert walked through the door. The ladies then left and Robert and Elizabeth were left alone, both not knowing who was going to say the first word. \"I am sorry,\" said Robert. It had killed him to say it but he knew he had to if he was ever going to get through to him one day. He then pulled a small package out of his pocket and handed it to Elizabeth. \"Happy Birthday.\" She took the package and smiled as she opened it to reveal a beautiful necklace with rubies and diamonds incrusted in it. \"Thank you,\" she said. She stood up and walked towards Robert and planted a kiss on his lips. \"I missed you.\" \"And I missed you,\" he said planting another kiss on her lips. He sat down and placed her in his lap. \"Now what have I missed?\" They hadn't been talking properly for a little less than three months so there was a lot for them to talk about. There sat like this for a few hours just talking when a knock was heard on the door. Elizabeth hurried off Robert's lap and went to her own chair beside his. Lettice walked in with a smiled on her face. \"Your majesties, the Princess Kathryn is here.\" Lettice went to the door again and held it open for Lady Sheffield and Princess Kathryn. Kathryn was holding Douglas's hand securely but when she saw her mother get off her chair and kneel down with her arms outstretched, she went running towards her and almost toppled her over with the sheer force of the collision. Douglas decided to leave the three of them alone and returned to the nursery while Elizabeth kissed Kathryn on the top of her head. \"You have grown so much,\" she said to her three year-old daughter who was holding onto her mother tight. \"I love you so much.\" Kathryn smiled up at her mother. \"Happy birthday mama,\" she said still smiling. \"You have to wait for your present. I will give it to you when Anne arrives.\" Elizabeth smiled. She didn't know if it was competition on the two girl's parts or if she genuinely wanted Anne and her to give the presents together. She picked up her daughter and sat back down on her chair. Robert leaned over and kissed Kathryn on the head. She was a sweet little girl, an obedient girl unlike Anne who thought the world revolved around her. He could tell that both of his daughters were destined for greatness. They spent the next hour like this with Kathryn telling them all about what she had been doing for the past few months at Hatfield. She told them about what she had been learning, her companions and other various things. An hour after Kathryn arrived, Lettice came in again. \"Your majesties, your highness,\" she said curtseying towards the three of them. \"The Princess Anne is here.\" Anne walked in with Lady Knollys standing behind her. They both curtsied towards them. Anne was still nervous that her parents were angry with each other but when she saw them there with Kathryn, he thoughts were diminished. A smile grew across her face. \"You may leave Lady Knollys,\" said Robert. Anne ran towards her father as Lady Knollys left the room. Everything was perfect in each of their eyes know. The day had flown passed and the two sisters had a lot to catch up on. It was night time know and they whole four of them plus Lady Alice, who was sharing the nursery while they were court, were standing at the window. The three young girls watched in amazement as the fireworks display in their mother's honour was being displayed in front of them. Elizabeth and Robert were watching on as the three younger girls argued over which colour was the best and their oohs and ahhs over each new firework. Elizabeth and Robert felt blessed with what they had and they knew it was going to last for if it didn't, Elizabeth felt that England would go into turmoil for it. AN: Ah... yes it was a family oriented chapter but I quite enjoyed it. From now on, with the time jump, I will be able to write a little Catherine de Medici (yay!), James VI of Scotland and various other characters. We are going to get a bit political, our favourite Princesses will grow up a bit, adultery (not telling who though) and new additions will be happening. Really, I think, it will start getting interesting really interesting from here on out! Hope to see you once again next time and don't forget to review. TBC[Chapter 19] AN: Welcome to a new chapter of Consort of Gloriana . Thanks again to all that review this story. It really does mean a lot and I know that I have made mistakes in this story (not deliberate ones) so please bare with me, I think I am going to have to brainstorm on this story as well. Also thanks to everyone that alerted, favourited or even read this story, again it really does mean a lot. Also, I was glad to see some new faces in the reviews as it is always good to see some new faces. There is a time jump in this chapter so you have been forwarned. I am going to try and make the story better from know on (eg.. longer chapters for a start). There is a four year time leap so it gives me room to make some new adjustments and fix some characters, add some story lines. Also there are few new additions added in this chapter so read on to find out more. Thanks for reading!

Disclaimer: I do not own Elizabeth, never have and I never will. Chapter Seventeen 3 October 1572 The court was in a panic as the Queen had finally gone into labour. Anne and Kathryn had been at court for the last couple of months waiting for the birth of their brother or sister. Everyone was hoping for the birth of a Prince but Anne was not. She did not want her mother to give birth to a stillborn but she would prefer her mother to give birth to a girl, a child that wouldn't usurp her position as Queen. She had been forced to pray for a baby brother by Lady Knollys but she really wanted a sister. She didn't understand why everyone wanted a Prince anyway. She was sure that she would be a more capable ruler than any brother of hers and her mother was a more capable ruler than her brother Edward VI had ever been so why shouldn't she be? She was her mother's daughter after all. She was ten years old now and she knew that in all likeliness this would be her mother's last pregnancy. Her mother was thirty-nine now and not likely to have more children. It was too dangerous after this birth. In any case, the birth of the new royal child was not the only exciting thing that was to happen at court. King James VI of Scotland and Kathryn's future husband was to visit. Kathryn was excited but she knew that the boy was younger so she wasn't expecting much. This meeting had been years in the making and once Elizabeth was out of her confinement, he would be visiting. This meant even more jousts and banquets in his honour and Kathryn always enjoyed attending those. Also, the court was to visit France once James had left back to Scotland, though Mary wasn't looking forward to that prospect. Anne was to be formally betrothed to Francis, the Duke of Alencon. Anne was very much looking forward to meeting her future husband and was sure that he would be much better than any King of Scotland. She was excited to see France as well though she knew that as long as this child was not a boy, she would not have to be living there as she was heir to the English throne. All in all, the two Princesses were excited about the upcoming events. Their half-sister, Lady Alice, was with her own mother, step-father and her own two younger half-siblings, Ursula, who was three and William, who was one. Alice who was nine herself now enjoyed her younger half-siblings and felt that she had more in common with them. However her mother was always remindful that she was not like her two younger siblings. She was the daughter of the King Consort, half-sibling to the next monarch of England. She felt that her paternal parentage was a burden now. Her two half-siblings on her mother's side would never have as big a burden to carry thanks to their parentage. Her siblings were only children of a Knight and a former lady-in-waiting to Queen Elizabeth and mistress to the King Consort. Her mother was already trying to plan a betrothal for her. She expected her daughter to be married to a Duke or Marquess or at the very least an Earl. Frances's other children wouldn't do so well off but she was still hopeful. However, Robert had put a stop to Frances's plans for a betrothal for Alice. He had stated that it was a matter for him to organise and take on. His two legitimate daughter's betrothal and eventual marriage had been organised by other people and he wanted to feel in control again. And he was sure that other nobles would listen to him more than Frances. Alice had hopes however to travel with Kathryn as a lady-in-waiting when she went and became Queen Consort of Scotland or be a lady-in-waiting to Anne though she knew that she wouldn't probably be far enough away from her mother and any betrothal plans if she was only a lady-in-waiting to Anne would still go ahead, with Kathryn she hoped that she could wait, maybe even fall in love with a nice Scottish Lord. Ursula and William would have it easier. Alice knew that was plain and simple. Everything would be handed to them on a silver platter; Alice would have to work for it. Maybe not literally for in her heart she knew that she had to. She decided that she couldn't stay with her mother in her chambers any longer. She got up from her seat and looked at her mother who was happily reading a book. \"Mother,\" said Alice solemnly with a slight curtsey. \"May I go be with my sisters?\" She said it with such gravity with a girl of nine years that all Frances could do was nod. Alice walked out of the room but Frances was quick to put her book down and walked quickly to the King Consort's chambers. She knew that this probably wasn't the best time for them to start to discuss Alice's personality, or lack of one but it needed to be discussed and Robert had been showing less interest in Alice's interests and it was about time that he started looking out for her again. It wasn't exactly like he had been neglecting Alice for the sake of spending more time with Elizabeth during her pregnancy, though he did his best efforts to make sure that he spent every of Elizabeth's woken moments together. Elizabeth had seemed more tired during this pregnancy than her last three. Her maids had been with her constantly though except for one lady, the Queen's cousin, Lettice Knollys. None of Elizabeth's ladies had known where Lettice had gone off to, many assumed it was to have a rest herself, though that meant she was slacking at her duties, or she was going to pleasure a man. Frances wasn't dumb like the rest of the ladies-in-waiting at court; she had been in the same position as Lettice once before, almost ten years ago, during the only time that she was ever able to get away from the Queen's presence, during one of midday naps of her pregnancy. It was the only time that the other partner in crime could get away as well. Lettice was the new mistress of the King Consort of England. Frances wasn't really surprised that he had chosen Lettice. She was pretty, young and fertile, which would become a plus for Robert if she did carry a son especially if Elizabeth didn't provide him with a son, and there was another factor. She bore a striking resemblance to Elizabeth herself. Robert's heart would always belong to Elizabeth, Frances knew this much but she also knew that men like Robert want female companionship all the time. Yes he had put on that stupid show of courting Elizabeth again to win her heart which he had already conquered but once she became pregnant, she could do nothing to 'please' him. He would become bored soon enough and when he did, his attentions turned to Lettice, who was the biggest flirt that had ever been in England. Thankfully, Elizabeth had never had a run in with Robert and Lettice like she did with Robert and Frances. Frances knew that while Robert sleeping with her was a blow to Elizabeth, fooling around with Lettice would break Elizabeth's heart even more because Lettice was family. Anyone else, Elizabeth might be closer to accepting it but not Lettice. Frances, in truth, was surprised that Lettice could be so dumb. Did she not think about the future of her two daughters and her son? While the two daughters at the moment were companions to the princesses, her son was a nothing yet. Also, Elizabeth had the power to pull the two little girls from the great positions as she was sure the Lettice's husband would be none too pleased about that. She finally made it to Robert's apartments and was quick to barge in without requesting an audience. This type of attitude would get her in trouble some day but it hadn't yet so she would keep on doing it. Robert was looking out the window when Frances came in but quickly spun around when he heard the door shut. \"Is there news of...\" said Robert anxiously before seeing who it was. \"What are you doing here Frances? This is not really the time to talk.\" \"Well I think it is,\" said Frances, pulling up a chair for herself. \"I want to talk about our daughter, Lady Alice, or have you forgotten that you have any children out of wedlock?\" Robert sighed. \"No, I haven't forgotten about her but really now is not the best time. You do realise that the Queen, my wife, is delivering my child right now? And in any case, Frances, you cannot say that you are the world's best mother. You have no right to the award.\" \"A least I am trying now,\" said Frances. \"Married life has changed me; I am a family woman now.\" \"Oh yes,\" said Robert sarcastically. \"I can see the remarkable improvements. Really Frances, if you are here to make jokes or argue I really don't have the patience for it right now.\" \"Well, I do,\" said Frances with a large smirk on her face. She would blackmail him into talking to her if that would be necessary. \"Listen, I am worried about Alice. She is so solemn for her age, even around other children. It is like she has no personality.\" Robert sighed. \"And guess who's fault that is,\" angrily said Robert. \"When I took her from you when she was a little over one's year old, she was so shy and scared of doing anything wrong that it scared me a little. Children should have fun and be nurtured Frances, not have it butchered into them to behave like adults. She wasn't even two when you did that. In fact, she would trust Elizabeth more as a mother figure than she ever would you. You have scared her away from ever loving you, ever wanting you around. When you want someone to blame, go have a good look in the mirror.\" Frances didn't know what to say. No one had been this critical or harsh when it came to Frances's parenting methods with Alice. She had noticed that she hadn't done all the same things with her other two children, Alice was special to her and in the fact that Alice was special; she had made her daughter feel unwanted and unloved. Maybe it was too late to even fix this damage. Frances couldn't do anything but run back to her rooms and shut herself away and cry, thinking about all the wrong she had done in her life. Elizabeth was relieved that the ordeal and when she had heard the sounds of a wailing infant her heart could feel this love pulled towards the infant that the midwife was taking away to clean up. No one would tell her what it was but that didn't matter as long as the child was healthy. She didn't mind if the child was a boy, she knew Robert would be thrilled but she, truthfully, wished that it was a girl. She had come to accept Anne as heir and something couldn't let her pull that away from her darling daughter. \"What is it,\" asked Elizabeth as she finally got her breath back and all of the ladies made their way around to fix Elizabeth up by changing the linen and tying her hair into a plait. Thankfully they were done and Elizabeth was propped up onto pillows as the midwife brought forward the latest and probably last bundle of joy, for Elizabeth towards her. \"Milady, you have given birth to a fine healthy daughter,\" said the midwife cheerfully as she handed the little baby girl into her mother's waiting arms. Elizabeth couldn't believe that she had another beautiful, healthy girl and by looks of things, she looked the most like her. Anne had gone through the family genes and gained a lot of her grandmother's, Anne Boleyn, features while Kathryn had gone onto her Dudley heritage and looked a lot like Robert's mother, Jane Guildford but this little one in her arms looked a lot like her. The little baby girl in her arms had bright red hair and as she was already sleeping, Elizabeth didn't have the heart to wake her up but as she thought this, this little baby opened her eyes and they were different to either of her sisters, they were blue, like her grandfather's, King Henry VIII. This little girl was the true Tudor of the three sisters. Anne was the Boleyn, Kathryn was the Dudley but this little one was the Tudor. \"My lady,\" said Lettice as she curtsied towards her mistress and the new princess. \"His majesty, the King Consort is here.\" She quickly left the room and Robert strode in towards his wife with a beaming smile on his face. \"No one will tell me what you had,\" said Robert as he sat beside Elizabeth and kissed the side of her head. \"Is this our darling son?\" Elizabeth shook her head, upset that Robert had come to this conclusion. \"No,\" said Elizabeth. \"May I present you to the new Princess of the House of Tudor, your daughter.\" Elizabeth beamed as she showed off her daughter and had clearly already drawn an attachment to her mother as her tiny hand was clasped around one of Elizabeth's long, slender fingers. Even though Elizabeth was beaming with pride, she could see that Robert was crestfallen. She hadn't promised him a son but she knew how much he wanted one. It wasn't like her didn't love his daughters, she knew that he loved all three of them and would love this new addition the same but he was like all men, he wanted to prove to the world that he could father a son. Really, she couldn't understand why men couldn't be proud of having daughter's only? Robert looked at his new daughter for few minutes and the three of them all sat there in silence, with the occasional gurgling sound from the baby or the sound of her ladies on the other side of the curtain. Thankfully, Lettice came in once again, with a more relieved look on her face this time. \"Your majesties, their highnesses, the Princess Anne and the Princess Kathryn are here to see you and their new sister.\" Anne and Kathryn came into the room and bowed before their mother and father. Their governess's waited outside of the bedchamber to give the royal family some privacy. Anne and Kathryn then looked at each other and quickly walked over to each of their parents. Kathryn threw herself onto her father's lap and Anne sat beside her mother. \"She is so little,\" commented Kathryn, amazed at how little her baby sister was. \"I was never that small.\" \"Of course you were,\" said Anne like she was annoyed. Robert could see that she was the typical elder sibling, annoyed when one of her younger siblings did something to annoy or embarrass her. \"Everyone was that small once, even I was. Even Mama and Papa were.\" Kathryn started to have her cheeks go red and Robert kissed her on the top of the head. \"Don't worry Kitty,\" said Robert, using Kathryn's pet name. \"No one remembers that they were that small when the get older.\" Elizabeth couldn't believe how lucky she was to have a family like this. There was a time in her life that she could never have believed that she would have a family. In fact there were a few times. She remembered after her one time step-mother, Katherine Howard, had been executed, she had vowed to Robert that she would never marry. Of course, she had been eight at the time and she was glad that she had changed her mind, especially because she could never imagine not having her now three daughters in her life. There was only one other time that she could recall, it was when her sister, the late Queen Mary, had locked her up in the tower. She was so sure that Mary would have executed her. She hated to remember her sister that way and just hoped that her own daughters would turn their backs on each other. She couldn't see it happening but she wouldn't want it to happen either. AN: Well I hoped you liked that. I am straying from the challenged a bit so I hope you don't mind Eleanor.... it just works better this way and it will be explained later but I would like to thank ReganX on that point as she discussed a few things out with me. I hope you enjoyed. There seemes that there will be some trouble in paradise brewing soon.... plus soon we get to see Mary of Scotland finally meet her son again (sorry but I am excited to see the reunion as in history they never had such). TBC[Chapter 20] AN: May I firstly apologise for the gigantic wait for this chapter. It has been almost 3 years since I last updated this story and I am sorry for those who have been waiting so long for an update but don't worry because the update is here. Also, I have the rest of the story planned out. This chapter is short but it is just updating everyone with what is going on and really, it helped me re-establish the characters. Hope everyone enjoys and I hope to update again really soon. DISCLAIMER: I do not own The Tudors/Elizabeth; never have and I never will Chapter Eighteen 29 December, 1572 Mary of Scotland had not wanted to believe that it was true. One of her ladies had come to her with scandalous news involving the King Consort and one of Elizabeth's ladies and truthfully, Mary had not wanted the rumours to be true. It would crush Elizabeth if she were to hear of her husband's infidelities, Mary was sure of it. Elizabeth had suffered it once before and while she had not been at court when that had happened and while Elizabeth looked at Lady Alice with affection, Mary still thought she saw some animosity behind the Queen's eyes. It was understandable. So Mary had decided that she would do something about it. Mary did not feel like she needed to knock into Robert's chambers. She had, no was , an anointed Queen of Scotland. She held higher precedence over a simple consort. She had shocked Robert that was for sure. He looked up from his papers and it took a moment for him to smile at her. She knew that Robert had not been as fond as Elizabeth of the idea of having her here at court but Mary knew that she had nothing to hide, not like Robert. She noticed that he was about to start his pleasantries but she waved her hand, which confused Robert. She was glad that he was confused, maybe being confused would finally knock some sense into him, she couldn't be sure if it would though. \"I know what you have been up to Robert,\" she stated to him. \"Think of Elizabeth, think of your daughters. You know what Alice's life is like, would you wish that upon another child.\" Robert smirked at her and Mary wanted to slap him. How dare he smirk at a Queen of Scotland? \"I think you are mistaken and are listening to far too much gossip,\" he states, his arms crossing under his chest. She will not be intimated by him. She has had her fare share of hardships due to men and she knows that has to stop now. She has to do this for herself and for Elizabeth... and even for Lettice Knollys. \"I hope that I am but... think about all of the women that shall be hurt by your actions, my actions have hurt many because I was foolish and I am giving you advice now. Return to loving the family you have already before it is too late and you have destroyed it all.\" Robert nodded. She wasn't sure if she had convinced him or not and she silently hoped she had. \"Thank you for your... words of wisdom Mary.\" It was a dismissal if she had ever seen one. She huffed and marched out of the room. She hoped for everyone's sakes that he had listened to her advice but deep down inside she feared that he had not, that once again she was to be a woman ignored and a woman to be looked down upon as the lost Queen of Scotland. But at least she tried. Kathryn was to be at court for Christmas. It was her favourite time of the year, especially as soon it was to be her own birthday. She was to be eight four days into the New Year and she was excited. It meant that it was another year closer to marrying and whilst her mother said that it would be many years away from marrying but Kathryn was still excited. She didn't want to have to be second fiddle to Anne any longer. Anne was to be Queen of England and while Kathryn was one prone to jealousy, she felt that Anne was more special within this court. In Scotland, she would feel the most important for once in her life. Anne had different opinions on the matter though, Kathryn knew that her elder sister always had an opinion. Anne had told her that her husband would be better, that a French match was always better than a Scottish match. Kathryn had wanted to cry but she knew that she shouldn't. Princesses did not get upset at such things. Her mother would not get upset at such thing and the only one who should was little Elizabeth, and she was only a couple of months old so it would be understandable. Secretly, Kathryn vowed to never treat Beth the way that Anne treated her sometimes. Anne could be nice at other times but Kathryn did not like that Anne always seemed to have everything nice, everything better. Kathryn wished that she had the nicest things for just once in her life. In Scotland, in many years time, she was sure that this would happen. That would be her time to shine and not be diminished in her elder sister's light. 4 January, 1572 Even though Anne continued to press the issue to Kathryn that she was too old to run into their father's arms, Kathryn did just that anyway. Anne was always one for decorum. She was to be Queen one day and this was just the way that things had to be. They were Princesses and they had to set a standard but she decided, that as it was Kathryn's birthday, that she would not chide her later for her behaviour. She silently admitted that she wished she could do the same on her own birthday but she was just too old now. Anne smiled and curtsied at her father before walking over to him as he finished his hug and small birthday congratulations. They had all decided to meet in the nursery and their mother was there with little Beth. Anne had been more than happy to see that she had a new little sister. Beth was already the perfect little Princess though; Anne had heard her mother saying, that she cried more than Anne and Kathryn. Anne had smiled at that. Her youngest sister's fiery hair seemed to match her attitude it would seem. Kathryn soon walked over to her mother who was holding Beth in her arms. \"Happy Birthday my Princess,\" said Elizabeth, kissing the top of her middle daughter's head and hugging her as best she could as she was sitting down and holding an infant in her arms. The nursery at Whitehall had been set up after the birth of Beth. It had been decided that she would not move out to Hatfield until after Anne's birthday in a couple of months. She wanted her family together for as long as she could have them together before Kathryn and Beth returned to Hatfield and Anne to Ludlow. Elizabeth hated to part her children but it was ultimately for the best. They would be separated one day and Anne needed to learn how to rule. Elizabeth had never been afforded that opportunity and while she had been a diligent student growing up, she would have liked to have had more experience if she had known that she would have been Queen. Her father never thought that Edward would die and merely being a wife of a King hardly needed proper training it would seem. Elizabeth couldn't help but smile every time she saw her daughters. Anne, her Boleyn beauty, was a proper Princess now, a proper Queen in waiting though not for many years Elizabeth prayed. She wanted to be here to see her children grow, to see them have families of their own. Anne did have a tendency though to correct any mistake. Elizabeth had first found it endearing but as she was getting older Elizabeth worried a little, not so much for Anne's sake but for Kathryn's. Kathryn, the little Guildford, had always been a shy little thing. Ever since Anne had left for Ludlow, Elizabeth had thought she had seen an improvement in Kathryn's confidence but with Anne around it seemed to diminish a little. Anne oozed self confidence, confident in what her future was meant to be. Today though, her spark seemed to be in her again, though Elizabeth thought that might be because it was her special day. Little Beth though, her fiery Tudor girl, was already a handful at two months. She was different to Anne. Anne had been fiery but with a sense of steel determination behind her but Beth, she was a fire cracker waiting to explode Elizabeth was sure. She was already a beauty, as her sisters were, and sometimes it made Elizabeth laugh that she had been able to create three distinctly different daughters, each of whom where loved all the same. TBC.
