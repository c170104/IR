I literally couldn't have gotten this far with ought you guys. Kura and Sakura this is for you I know this took a loooooooonnng time to publish, my laptop suckkkkssss. But I need help and your advice. This will probably bad its my first time at a thought out story. See if u can read this. Ash nazg durbatulûk, ash nazg gimbatul, ash nazg thrakatulûk, agh burzum-ishi krimpatul . I don't own frozen I wish. The kingdom of Arendelle was celebrating the best time of the year. Christmas! The citizens murmuring and bustling through the city. Banners tapestries, trees , decorations were all spread out through the city. Greens, reds, whites colors emblazoned on practically every surface. The town was covered in a few inches of snow. Nothing the people couldn't handle. It made the festivities better just because of the environment. In a small room of the main castle a conundrum was being solved. \"Conceal, don't feel. Conceal don't feel\" repeated Elsa for the millionth time in her life. The last time she was this nervous was the night of the accident over 13 years ago. That night she had almost killed her sister Anna. That night her isolation started. Said isolation to keep her from hurting her sister and others. 13 years of being locked in a room by herself. Anna's constant pleading for her to come out and build a snowman made it far worse. It took all of her will not to come out. She had to stay in. Until she learned how to control her powers she couldn't see her beloved sister. How badly she wished that her parents were still alive. With them alive she could have been guided through these tough years. Ever since their death 3 years ago her relationship with Anna had dissipated until there was no relationship at all. She came by less and less until her visits stopped altogether. But after 3 years the day she dreaded had arrived. The day of her coronation. After her 21st birthday she was old enough to be crowned acting monarch of Arendelle. For the first time in 13 years she would see company, and not just any company but monarchs from all corners of the world. If she lost control of her powers… she didn't want to even think about what would happen. She couldn't let the negative thoughts dominate her mind. She had to focus. \"Conceal, don't feel, conceal don't feel, don't let them know\". The familiar mantra repeated through her head. On the other side of the archipelago the clouds parted as a large silver dragon glided over the clouds. On the silver expanse of its back laying in a position only a master dragon rider could achieve Waryda was lain diagonally on Ashgos back. Mulling over the letter he received he patted Ashgos, who hummed in approval. The letter was sent to his realm on December 20th. Ironicaly he had never heard of this \"Arendelle\" before and was keen to explore it. Even more interesting was the fact that when he received the letter his fellow G.M.A.D members Kura, and Sura threw him out his own realm with giggles and the phrase \"have fun\". After traveling for the last 3 weeks with only an expanse of ocean beneath them, finding Arendelle wasn't hard at all. All they had to do was follow the long line of ships that extended for the last 16 leagues. Being a big event it was obvious that almost all kingdoms would wish to attend the coronation. Following the ships wasn't hard. But guessing the fact that they hadn't seen dragons was a likely occurrence so the duo shot up higher into the sky. At last reaching to the point where they couldn't be observed, Waryda scanned the ground for a small clearing where he could land. After a few minutes he found such a clearing. With a grin he rubbed one of the small horns over Ashgos's left eye. \"Ash fly over the clearing to your left\" Waryda instructed as his dragon glided over to the area. Giving a smile to his friend he laughed of out \"see you in a few days\". Ashgos gave him the best equivalent of o draconian smile and mentally said \"Little one don't get into trouble\" Jumping off of her and landing on solid ground was a relief to him. As he stood up he stretched out his muscles. As much as he loved to fly being cooped up in a saddle for 3 weeks would drive anyone insane. Walking out from the woods he casually strolled his way over to the town docks. He was internally smirking. A chance to explore the vast land of Arendelle. Exploring the town he saw the one thing he was looking for. The strawberries looked absolutely delectable. Pulling out the sac of coins Kura gave him he was about to buy a batch when THUMP In the next moment Waryda found himself on the ground feeling as if he got hit with a sledge hammer. Groggily getting on his knees he noticed a small pool of blood from a gash on his forehead. Pushing his hand over the cut to staunch the bleeding he heard an angry feminine voice. \"Hey, watch where you're going!\" Turning his head to the direction of the angry voice Waryda was confronted by a girl of his age. She wore a green dress had strawberry red hair freckles and light blue eyes. Waryda`s eyes widened. Here he was attempting to buy some strawberries and this girl slammed into him with strength more than most of his companions would be jealous of and he was the bad one?! \"Me you were the one who slammed into me like a titan!\" Anna was very unhappy. For the first time in forever she had gotten out of the castle and this guy slammed into her. Attractive yes, but that was besides the point. \"Look i`ve been waiting for this day for years and I won't have you ruining it!\" Waryda spluttered in anger. The first person he met in Arendelle and it was this explosive female. In the last 500 years he hadn't met someone this explosive except for his sister. Furrowing his brow he crossed his arms. \"Believe me I will be happy to leave you alone, so bye.\" With that he attempted to purchase the berries which he came for but a tap on his shoulder alertedhim to the girl. Turning around with a sigh he noticed the impatient look on her face. Bored and tired of the argument he asked with a sigh, \"What is it\" her eyes rose in annoyance. \"I'm still expecting an apology.\" His arms tightened their grip and the metal of his gauntlets groaned as the black metal shifted. \"You'll get my apology when I'm six feet in the ground.\" She clenched her teeth and stalked away. Turning back around he bought the strawberries fitting the lot of them into his pack. But as he made his way back to the docks he saw a sight that made him fall to the floor in laughter. The same girl who annoyed him earlier had fallen into a boat. The sadistic pleasure of seeing her potentially fall into the water was ruined as a man in a white suite on a horse helped her up/ Dusting himself off the floorboards he sighed. \"Why do women hate me?\" The man who helped the girl parade behind Waryda and tapped his shoulder. \"Well mate with an attitude like it's no wonder, Also I don't think that women find prosthetics all that appealing\", he claimed while pointing to Waryda`s prosthetic legs. With a dark growl Waryda let this man feel the bite of his prosthetics as he slammed his foot into the other man's feet. The resounding howl that erupted from the man's throat gave Waryda a sadistic pleasure, as he learned not to insult him again. As the man fell into the same boat that the girl fell into. With a evil smile that would rival Saurons he smashed his fist with all his might into the portcullis effectively destroying the cable that held the boat in place. As the boat sailed off of the dock all the man could utter was \"Oh\". Turning back around Waryda stalked back to the place that he came to. As he walked back to the church he had a strawberry in one hand and a large grin on his face. This day was good so far.

They stood five feet from the wounded creature, the doctor studying him from a safe distance while his monster stood silently behind him, ready to defend him should the need arise. From this distance Victor could plainly see the creature was in a great deal of discomfort; he sat with his back against the wall he had crawled to from where he fell, his face pale as he constantly shifted position as if trying to escape from the unrelenting pain he appeared to be in. Victor's experienced eye noted his ragged breathing, indicative of broken ribs or worse, his one arm held protectively against his body and the fact that he was doing everything in his power to not move his right leg; he badly needed help, but first Victor had to come up with a way to do it without getting mauled. He took a step forward and the creature growled even louder, this time baring his inch long canines to emphasize his point. \"I mean you no harm, all I wish to do is help you.\" The creature, his eyes a hellish red, stared him down in such a way as to make Victor wish there was an impenetrable barrier between the two of them. Much to Victor's surprise, the creature broke off first and lowered his gaze to the floor, his scruffy black hair covering his eyes. \"Please.\" He whispered, his voice sounding to Victor like what a dog able to speak would sound like. After creating splints for the creature's arm and leg, Victor had his monster carry him to the part of the mansion he inhabited and gently lay him upon a bed in one of the empty rooms. \"I'm Dr. Victor Frankenstien.\" Victor felt it was now safe to offer his hand, hoping the creature felt comfortable enough around him to not bite it off. \" Edward H-Hyde.\" The creature took the proffered hand in his own; Victor noted how the coarse hair on the back resembled that of an ape; was this being some kind of missing link, he wondered? \"Would you like to explain how you ended up in your current predicament?\" Victor asked with a note of suspicion; he'd been on his way to investigate the screams he'd been hearing, one sounding eerily like that of a child, when he'd stumbled upon him. \"You haven't killed anyone, have you?\" Edward shook his head. \"The stupid brat and those annoying books are long gone by now.\" He snarled like a wolf who'd been denied its prey. Victor saw that it would be wise to change the subject. \"So, my friend, what exactly are you?\" \"How the hell should I know!?\" Edward snapped. \"All I know is I'm not human and I'm not anything else I've found here.\" Victor took a step back. \"How long have you been here?\" The various ghosts and ghouls that wandered the hallways had been moaning about a feral beast wrecking havoc as it prowled about the house; stealing whatever it could get its hands on, attacking for no reason, and laughing gleefully as its terrorized victims ran away. Edward shrugged. \"Ask that idiot friend of yours, Henry, the next time you see him. He's the one that lets me out.\" \"Lets you out? And how do you know I'm friends with Henry Jekyll?\" Edward laughed maliciously. \"I'M Henry Jekyll, just not the body you're used to. I'm the part of him that he wishes would die.\" \"He's succeeded, then\" Victor gasped as he turned pale. \"And I'm starting to wish I WOULD die! This pain is maddening.\" Edward whined, snapping Victor back to reality. \"Can I examine you?\" \"Right now I could care less if you cut my throat!\" He moaned, Victor, feeling nothing but pity as he untied the sling, stopping to say hello to the various spirits that had floated into the room. Edward saw them, and commenced growling; even showed them his teeth again, all to no avail. They saw how wounded he was and, judging him harmless, one made a come here gesture in the direction of the open door. Slowly, various denizens of the mansion filed into the room; all staring with a mixture of curiosity that soon turned to anger. \"That's HIM!\" A deathly pale woman wearing a tattered dress, and with seaweed in her hair, shrieked as she pointed an accusing finger at him. \"He stole my necklace!\" Soon the air was filled with accusations being leveled at him. \"He beat up my brother!\" \"He pushed me down the stairs!\" \"He pushed me into a chest and locked it!\" \"He stole our food!\" and on and on for several minutes. Victor polity hushed them as Edward cowered at the onslaught. Once he'd gained order, he turned to look down at Edward. \"How much of that is true?\" Edward swallowed. \"All.\" He flinched, but Victor held up a hand to stop them. \"He's too injured right now to do much, but I'll see what can be done.\" Victor got him to disclose where he hid their valuables and to sincerely apologize to those he'd wronged in other ways, Victor working out a deal wherein he'd do odd jobs for his victims as punishment when he was healed up enough to do so. Once they'd left, Victor went back to examining him, Edward yelping whenever he found the sight of his various injuries. \"Your arm and several ribs are broken, but your leg is not. You appear to have either sprained or badly bruised it.\" Victor told him as he readied a shot of morphine for him. \"And now I understand why you were behaving the way you were when I found you, you knew if they recognized you they'd be out for your blood. Now hold still, this will only sting a little.\" He rolled up the sleeve on Edward's good arm, Edward turning his head as Victor injected him. Seated by his side, Victor held Edward's hand as his body tried to fight the powerful drug. \"Just relax, you'll only fall asleep, nothing more.\"He whispered as Edward's eyes would start to close, only for him to jerk awake. \"I'll stay with you till you wake up.\" \"He'll be back, tomorrow,\" Edward mumbled, Victor, running his fingers through Edward's hair. \"We'll come up with a schedule, you'll get more time, but for now that time will be spent atoning for what you've done.\" Edward forced his eyes open one last time before the drug took effect, Victor picking up a book as he kept one eye on him.

So the moment that the teacher opened the door, Richard Tyler, as well as the rest of the students, charged outside to the coat room. He took hold of his book bag, stuffing folders and books inside with such speed, you would think he was trying to be the first one outside. Well, it was no surprise. It was a lovely day, so no doubt everyone would be trying to get out and play in the sun. Spring was an ideal time of year to do so, but Richard wasn't excited about playing outside, even though his friends had asked him to play ball. Richard planned to ride to the library, which was located deep in the woods in the town park. His friend, Chloe, was supposed to meet him there this afternoon, for they had some serious matters to take care of. Some days ago, when Richard had taken another journey into a book, he had accidentally taken Chloe along with him. She had proved a vital partner to have on this adventure, for the two children had entered Alice in Wonderland —a place that was not at all easy to navigate with its twisted logic and crazy characters. They had visited the tea table of the legendary Mad Hatter and March Hare, but had walked away with a disaster on their hands. The Hatter had taken an interest in Richard's magic compass and, in spilling tea on it, had broken it, so that Richard and Chloe couldn't easily get back home. Chloe managed to surprise Richard once more, because after that dreadful fiasco, she had produced a little golden pendant that enabled them to return to the library. It was a magic gift, given to her by Mr. Dewey when she was a little child, which had enabled her to travel through books as easily as Richard could. Richard had been grateful that Chloe had gotten them back home, and that she was now a part of his adventures, but there was still the matter of fixing his compass. It was the only way he could ever go inside books on his own again. And hopefully now, since Mr. Dewey had given Richard the compass, he could give the children some answers as to how to bring the compass back to life. At last, Richard navigated the trees, and parked his bike outside the library. He bounded up the steps, past the two harsh-looking stone lions, and pulled the doors open. By the time the big oak doors had shut, Richard had made it to the study tables at the back. As usual, it wasn't very full, so he could easily spot Chloe's head of fiery hair among the mahogany tables. He noticed her in one of the armchairs that circled the room, running to plop his book bag down beside her. \"Chloe!\" he addressed her. \"Richard, hey!\" she exclaimed, standing up from her chair. She adjusted her shirt, pulling out the golden pendant from beneath it. \"Good, you're here. Come on. Let's get started.\" \"Lead the way,\" Richard said, following his friend back towards the front desk. Chloe went into a speed-walk, causing her red hair to bounce on her shoulders. Her head swayed a little to her step, and Richard had to stifle a little chuckle. They reached the front lobby, where a giant, circular desk sat in the center. It was cluttered with old leather-bound volumes, paper, and an ancient computer monitor. An old man with grass-like white hair sat at a weathered swiveling chair, turning around to reach different objects on the desktop. \"Grandpa?\" Chloe piped up, reaching her arms over the countertop to greet him. Mr. Dewey looked over his shoulder, and his eyes glimmered like an owl's. \"Oh, Chloe, my girl. Good to see you here! And you too, Richard, my boy.\" He gave the same, all-knowing smile to Richard, who managed to smile nervously back. \"What can I do you for?\" \"We have a question for you,\" Chloe began, as she removed her pendant from around her neck. Mr. Dewey took note of the pendant as Chloe handed it to him. \"Why, whatever can it be?\" he asked. \"There can't be anything wrong with your pendant, is there?\" \"No, no, not with mine,\" Chloe answered. \"It's Richard's compass.\" Mr. Dewey almost dropped the pendant with the look that crossed his face. \"Well, that's a whole other story,\" he remarked. \"Richard, my boy, let me see.\" Richard opened the flap of his book bag, and pulled out the tarnished compass. The silver surface was blemished red now from the rust, the marble of the compass's face stained with the tea the Hatter had spilled. Mr. Dewey took the compass as delicately as he would a child, looking it up and around, before he set it on the desktop beside Chloe's pendant. \"Please explain how this happened,\" Mr. Dewey said. Both Richard and Chloe rested their elbows on the countertop of the desk, and spoke to Mr. Dewey of how they had entered Wonderland, but had accidentally caused the Hatter to spill his tea onto the compass. Mr. Dewey continued to examine the compass, and didn't speak until Richard and Chloe had finished. Mr. Dewey exhaled through his nose, sitting back. \"My, this is unfortunate,\" he murmured. \"Well, I do not really see how I can fix this, children.\" \"What?\" Richard blurted. \"But, Mr. Dewey, you gave that compass to me. And, don't you think, since you gave Chloe her magic pendant, that you would know how the magic works?\" \"My boy, it may surprise you, but I was not the one who created these instruments.\" Richard and Chloe exchanged glances. \"Well, then…who did make them, Grandpa?\" Chloe wanted to know. \"That is something for me to know, and you to find out,\" replied Mr. Dewey. \"Such mysteries can only be discovered within the pages of a book.\" \"Or, you could tell us in whispers instead,\" Richard pressed. Mr. Dewey shook his head. \"No, no, no, Richard. Not here,\" he said. \"You children are the only ones I trust with the secrets behind the pendant and the compass. And besides, it is not my place to relay such things. You'll have to discover it for yourselves.\" Richard frowned. \"Well, gee, thanks, um, Mr. Dewey,\" he said, deflated. \"But, can't you at least tell us where we should start?\" \"You know just where to begin, my boy. The fiction section.\" \"Oh, of course, how could I forget?\" Richard said, not hiding the sarcasm in his voice. \"Never fear,\" said Mr. Dewey. \"You won't be alone in this venture, boy. Chloe shall help you every step of the way.\" \"Right,\" Chloe agreed. \"And, you know, it's not like you can get into a book without me. At least, not until we fix the compass somehow.\" \"Chloe is right,\" Mr. Dewey remarked. Richard sighed, as he reached for the compass on the desk. \"Okay,\" he said. \"But I'll need the compass if we're going to find someone who can help us.\" \"By all means.\" Mr. Dewey handed the compass to Richard, and the pendant back to Chloe, turning back to his work. \"The best of luck to you both.\" Richard and Chloe started to walk away from the desk. Chloe hung her pendant back around her neck, but Richard slumped his head in defeat. \"'The fiction section',\" he said. \"Right. He could have at least told us where we could begin.\" \"Quit with the pessimism already, Richard,\" Chloe scolded. \"In case you didn't notice already, I like direction, and order,\" Richard remarked. \"I would like to know where to start—it would make things easier for both of us.\" \"Well, I can help you there,\" Chloe said. \"We can start with a fairy tale volume from the fantasy aisles. There are all kinds of people we could meet in those stories.\" Richard chuckled. \"In my experiences, Chloe, the fairies and witches, and people like that, are usually the bad guys. They can't help us.\" Chloe playfully slugged Richard on the shoulder. \"You forgot about the fairy godmother. And the good fairy from Sleeping Beauty. There are all kinds of good, wise people we can look to in a fairy tale—they don't all need to be fairies or witches, you know.\" \"I trust you, Chloe,\" said Richard. \"As I told you before, lead the way.\" Chloe led them to a shelf that held some thick volumes with golden titles on the spines. She removed the first book from the shelf, and opened the yellowing pages to the table of contents. \"I'll gladly be the leader for now, but when we get the compass back on track, you're stepping up with me,\" she told him. Together then, Richard and Chloe scanned the titles of the fairy tales. They pointed out different ones, debating which ones would be the best to start with. Until finally, Chloe set the book on the floor, opening the pendant so it lay flat on the pages. When she was sure that Richard was ready, she pressed the button on her pendant, and the lid popped open, the clock hands starting to whirl madly. In an instant, Richard got a feeling in his stomach like someone had shoved him in one direction. Chloe moved the same way, spinning in circles on her feet. The world blurred like they were looking at it through a foggy window. Abruptly, Richard and Chloe were pushed into each other, as if closed in by a tight space, everything melting all around them. At last, the light went away, and slowly, things came back into focus.[Chapter 2] Chapter 2 Once Richard and Chloe could feel the world stilling around them, they rested their hands on their knees, taking in several breaths. Chloe bent back up carefully, to put her pendant back on. \"Gee,\" Richard whispered. \"I'm never going to get used to going back and forth between worlds.\" Chloe shook her head to clear her senses, taking a look around them. She found they had landed in the center of a large stone room. Men dressed in bloomers and doublets crossed the floor near them, speaking with women in large, puffy dresses that had huge, lacy collars. The ceiling was high up, from which hung flags of every color and tapestries of every kind of design. At the front of the room, there was a pair of long tables, where more of the nobility were sitting. And above them, two tall thrones sat, decorated in burgundy upholstery, occupied by a young couple. They were dressed in fine clothes—finer than any of the noblemen and ladies present—and upon both their heads, were golden crowns adorned with glittering gems. Between their thrones, there was a crib, with a large awning that spilled over with pure white tulle. A lavender blanket draped over the edges of the crib, mixing with the tulle in a dramatic display. And on the crest of the crib, there was an ornately carved \"R\", surrounded by carvings of vines and rosebuds with thorns. \"It's amazing,\" Richard said, turning his head in a circle to observe the throne room. \"That's because this is supposed to be the christening of the baby princess,\" Chloe reminded him. \"Hmm. I wonder why no one is looking at us. We stick out like a green apple in a strawberry field.\" \"Maybe that's why,\" said Richard, who pointed to the center of the throne room with a swift gasp. Chloe followed Richard's pointed finger above them, where, just over the room, a collective group of people was descending upon the room. They all had lovely faces, with intricate markings upon their cheeks in many colors, to match their flowing robes. Their hair was cut into perfect bobs, in black, white, or yellow. The entire group had such a presence, that when they spread their arms to land on the floor, the room started in a storm of whispering. \"They're fairies,\" Chloe said. \"We've got to get out of their way.\" She and Richard speedily walked out of the room, and stopped at a pillar off to the side, while the mysterious fairies floated to the floor. Together, they turned, and curtsied before the king and queen before them. \"Your Majesties,\" they said in unison. \"Welcome, friends,\" said the king, while he raised his arms. \"My beloved queen and I are so pleased you could make it so far for this christening.\" \"Anything for the sweet princess,\" said one of the fairies. \"May we take our seats?\" \"By all means,\" answered the king. Then, the fairies got into two straight lines, facing each other, as they took one collective step off the ground. But it didn't look as though they actually had seats—they were just floating there, like they were being suspended from wires. The king stood up to address the great crowd, of both nobility and fey. \"My people,\" he called, \"it gives me tremendous pleasure to see each and every one here today, to see the christening of out lovely daughter, the Princess Rosamond…\" \"This could take a while,\" Chloe said to Richard, pointing at the king with a sigh. \"And the fairies are floating so high up,\" said Richard. \"How will we reach them? How will we get their attention?\" Chloe looked thoughtfully at the fairies, twirling a bit of her hair on her finger. \"Well, I don't think we'll see them again once all the gifts have been given to the princess. So, of course, we'll have to catch them while they are presenting their gifts.\" \"Won't they get mad, if we interrupt?\" Richard asked, worried. \"Not unless we talk out loud to the open,\" Chloe answered. \"What else is whispering good for?\" \"Okay,\" Richard said, inching out from by the pillar. \"We just need to be careful.\" Both Richard and Chloe stepped out so that they could observe the fairies. In the meantime, Chloe crossed over to the one nearest them—one wearing a blue robe, with black hair, and blue markings on her cheeks. \"Um…excuse me?\" she whispered, cupping one hand around her mouth to project her voice. The fairy turned her head, looking in all directions before, at last, she met Chloe's imploring gaze. She seemed taken aback to be seeing Chloe, but she smiled sincerely. \"Little child,\" she said. \"Why, what is it?\" \"We would like your help,\" Chloe explained. The fairy's eyes turned down when she heard Chloe speak. \"I wish I could, but at the moment, we are presenting our gifts to the baby princess. It would be disrespectful to leave during such festivities.\" \"Oh, we mean nothing bad towards Rosamond,\" Richard butted in quickly. \"It's just one question.\" \"One question, you say?\" the fairy said. \"Yes, if you would please,\" Chloe clarified. The fairy turned back to the table, where another fairy on the opposite side was offering her gift to the princess's crib. With a growing smile, the fairy in the blue robe nodded her head to the children. \"Very well, then, I have your word,\" she said. \"I am the last of the fairies to give her gift, so I shall come with you.\" \"We promise to make it fast,\" said Chloe, as she started back for the pillar. Richard and the fairy weren't far behind, so they huddled together where they couldn't be easily noticed. Promptly, Richard took the compass from his book bag, presenting it to the fairy. She looked at it, turning it every which way, even shaking it out like an old gift box, before she held it normally in her hands. \"A most interesting device,\" she said, looking it over again. \"It's interesting you would be carrying this around. It's broken, a little.\" Chloe snorted, rather than laughed. \"Yes, we know. But we would like to know if you could help us.\" She slowed down as she spoke, seeming to get the feeling that this fairy would be as helpful as Mr. Dewey had been. The fairy continued to look over the compass, as if she had forgotten what it was in the last few moments. She cocked one eyebrow, but a smile started to grow on her face. \"I've never seen a device of this caliber,\" she stated. \"But I know that it was once magic. And that it belonged in the expertise of the Pagemaster.\" She bowed her head as she mentioned the name. \"How can you tell?\" Richard asked. His eyes closed to slits, and he reached for the compass, which the fairy let him take. She pointed to the rusted silver lid, which Richard rubbed over carefully with his hand. But Chloe just looked confused. \"It's on the inside,\" the fairy hinted, as she stuck her fingers under the lid. With a crack, the lid opened, and the damaged compass face, and the cracking clock face flapped upwards. With a gentle hand, the fairy pulled up the clock face, as Richard just gaped in wide-eyed amazement. He thought that the clock face was where the device ended. It turned out that, below the clock, was the engraving of an intricate, beautiful symbol. There was a single book, surrounded by vines and snakes, curving in and around each other, so that Richard, nor Chloe, could find where one part began and another ended. \"You see that?\" asked the fairy. \"That is the symbol of the Pagemaster. It's branded to show that this is a creation of his magic.\" \"How do you know that?\" Richard wanted to know. \"I have connections,\" the fairy explained. \"With the Pagemaster, that is. We all do. We all recognize that symbol when we see it, for it is an emblem of the sole ruler of all that keeps our worlds together.\" She smiled, patting her hand on the compass in Richard's hands. \"That is why it is so extraordinary seeing that such a device came into your hands. An object with the Pagemaster's emblem means that it was either created at his hands, or belongs directly to him.\" She paused, putting a hand to her mouth in surprise. \"Which brings me to another point. However was it that this device came into your possession?\" Chloe touched the compass at the same place as Richard and the fairy, and she swept her finger along the surface slowly and curiously. \"The…Pagemaster?\" she asked, forgetting the fairy's question in her raging thoughts. \"I…I've heard of him before, but I didn't know that he was an inventor.\" The fairy nodded. \"You could say that, although it's not the precise word. The Pagemaster is a powerful being, child—far greater than any witch or fairy could hope to achieve becoming. I haven't met him, but we all know who he is when we hear his name. That is how much power he holds in this world.\" \"Then…\" Richard let his voice trail off, considering the possibilities. He remembered meeting the Pagemaster for the first time not long ago, though he couldn't remember there being much helpful magic to the figure. All the Pagemaster had done was send Richard into terrifying situations that nearly got him killed, and without many ways of escaping. Of course, Richard understood now the purpose of that journey, but he didn't fully appreciate the dangers he was unexpectedly put through. That was why they had to try and fix the compass—otherwise, some of the helpful magic to going into this world would be lost. \"Then…could you take us to him?\" Richard finally said. \"I apologize, my dears, but I must be going!\" Richard and Chloe barely registered the fairy's words in their ears, when the fairy vanished.

But of course at the time, I did not know this. I wrung my hands nervously, my breathing ragged as I drew air into my lungs and my voice cracking from overuse as I opened my mouth to speak. The cheerful television host in front of me had little idea that I was merely three years old – most people assumed that I was thirty or older, after all that was how I was designed to look. I was a product, a clone of another. Tom Lincoln – my sponsor. No, he was the one I was supposed to die for. But instead, he was the one who died, though not by my hands it may as well have been. \" Lincoln, you're on.\" A voice from the side announced. A reassuring squeeze to my hand from the person next to me jolted me back into reality. \"Lincoln, are you alright?\" Jordan whispered as she stood next to me, dressed in a white jumpsuit that freakishly reminded me of the outfits we were forced to wear in the facility. The facility had once been our home but once we learned the truth, the reality about what we were and what would become of our lives, we renamed our home ' The Island '. It was fitting, considering it was the fantasy place we were all supposed to go once we won the lottery. In the end, it turned out that no one went to the island. We were all grown in one huge laboratory and then harvested for our organs or used as surrogate mothers before being given a lethal injection which killed us. No one won anything in the lottery except a one-way ticket to our expiration. I nodded to Jordan before I stood and addressed the television host and the world. \" Three years ago you may have been watering your garden, you might have been walking your dog or you may even have been sitting down to watch the evening news as you are doing right now.\" I spoke clearly as I stared into the camera with an honest seriousness and a hint of defiance. \"But three years ago, I was born into this world and today is the day I was scheduled to be systematically murdered so that my sponsor could have my organs harvested and live. You may find this hard to believe, but there are three thousand clones – identical to their sponsors like me – and all of us were to be murdered, one by one.\" I paused and waited, watching the reaction of the crew behind the cameras before the director – now pale in his complexion – nodded for me to continue \" My name is Lincoln SixEcho, beside me is Jordan TwoDelta and we are the secret they didn't want you to know about.\" Hello friends of fanfiction!

Si vous n'avez pas vu le film, allez le voir et revenez ensuite lire ce qui suit. - The Island : A Truth About My World - J'étais assis face au monde, les antennes de télévision montrant mon visage en direct aux quatre coins du globe. Mais évidemment, à cet instant, je ne n'en savais rien. Je me tordais les mains nerveusement, ma respiration se faisait laborieuse alors que l'air s'infiltrait dans mes poumons, et ma voix surmenée peinait à sortir de ma gorge. A vrai dire, l'enjoué présentateur de télévision qui se trouvait face à moi n'avait que peu ou prou conscience que je n'étais qu'âgé de trois ans – la plupart des gens étaient convaincus que j'étais dans la trentaine, voire plus. Mais après tout, c'était ainsi que l'on m'avait fait. Que l'on m'avait pensé , ce à quoi je devais ressembler . J'étais un produit , le clone d'un autre. Tom Lincoln – mon commanditaire. Non, plutôt celui pour lequel j'étais destiné à mourir. Finalement, ce fut lui qui mourut. Pas de mes mains, mais c'était tout comme. Une voix s'éleva près de moi. « Lincoln, vous êtes à l'antenne . » Le contact rassurant d'une main sur mon épaule me ramena à la réalité. « Lincoln, tu vas bien ? » C'était Jordan, debout, près de moi, qui murmurait à mon oreille, vêtue d'un ensemble blanc qui me rappelait étrangement les combinaisons réglementaires de l'installation dont nous venions de réchapper. Cette même installation fut un temps notre foyer, mais une fois la vérité révélée, leur vérité, de ce que nous étions et de ce que nos vies allaient devenir selon eux , notre foyer ne fut plus que ' L'Île '. Une vérité bien commode, en considérant que ce lieu pour lequel nous étions tous destinés à partir, une fois la loterie gagnée, n'était qu'un fantasme, une illusion. Finalement, aucun d'entre nous ne s'y rendit. Nous n'étions que les créations d'un immense laboratoire, dans l'objectif de n'être qu' élevés pour nos organes ou, pour les femmes, utilisées comme mères porteuses avant de recevoir la létale et inévitable injection qui mettait fin à leurs jours. Personne ne gagnait quoi que ce soit à la loterie, hormis un aller simple pour la mort. Ma seule réponse à la question de Jordan fut un hochement de la tête, avant de me lever et de me tourner face au présentateur… face à la planète. « Il y a trois ans, peut-être étiez-vous en train d'arroser votre jardin, ou peut-être promeniez-vous votre chien, ou peut-être même étiez-vous assis devant votre télévision, à regarder les informations du soir, comme vous le faites en cet instant. » Je m'efforçais à parler distinctement, fixant la caméra avec une intègre gravité et une pointe de défi dans le regard. « Mais il y a trois ans, ce fut aussi le jour de ma mise au monde, et aujourd'hui est le jour où l'on m'avait programmé à mourir, pour que mon commanditaire puisse disposer de mes organes et ainsi, vivre. Vous pouvez trouver cela difficile à croire. Mais dehors, il y a trois mille clones, en tous points identiques à leurs commanditaires, tout comme je le suis – et chacun d'entre nous, avons été ou devions être méthodiquement tués, un par un. » Ma voix resta en suspens et j'attendis, attentif aux réactions des employés de la chaîne prostrés derrière leurs caméras, avant que le directeur, pâle comme un linge, me fit signe de poursuivre. « Mon nom est Lincoln Six-Echo, et à côté de moi se trouve Jordan Two-Delta. Nous sommes le secret qu'ils veulent vous garder de connaître. » ","Summary":" Disclaimer : \"The Island\" est un film de 2005 réalisé par Michael Bay .

His thoughts muddled after them being chopped up, dropped into a blender then mixed into what had been his nightmare. It had been the same one. Every night he dreamt of things he never quite understood. Like the soft hum of an elaborately designed and built boat, or his own panicked lungs convulsing as he breathed in a stream of icy water. The boat bringing him to the Island was the nice part; the drowning was the part that left him feeling detached and ruffled. It also was the thing that caused the computer monitoring his REM cycle to report his troubled sleep thus earning him another 'meeting' with Dr. Merrick. Lincoln sighed, not bothering to look at the digital message displayed over his wall. Instead he turned over, cuddling into the white of his blanket and sheets. He was tired, so tired that breakfast would have to wait until he felt a bit better and not so sickened from his dream. As the minutes passed on and he still felt uneasy Lincoln knew there was something wrong. He shifted, moaning into his pillow. His skin was on fire, sweat drenching his white sleep clothes and bed sheets. Lincoln shuddered, screwing his blue eyes shut and keening in distress, his heart pounding. He gasped and started grabbing at his clothes. The need to rip them off causing his movements to be erratic and uncontrolled. As Lincoln writhed on the damp bed, struggling to remove the thin layers of fabric between him and nakedness, he missed the tell-tale sound of an alarm going off. The computers voice sounded, calm and precise. Though what he managed to grasp out of the air was jumbled and confused. Emergency. Lincoln Six Echo. Emerg- six echo, code4. Override. And with a loud screech the door to his private room was pried open. People rushed in. Elite doctors reaching him first, grabbing at his burning skin, making the fire worse. Lincoln screamed, hands that should've felt soft were daggers and fingers that should've been firm yet gentle felt like sharp needles piercing his boiling flesh. His agony didn't seem to bother any of them though. What he glimpsed of their faces was passive, uncaring even as he wailed and started sobbing, the pain becoming too much. Lincoln heard various words, words that worried him and words that made him calm some despite the constant pain. Help him. Poison. Unknown, lack of evidence. Paddles. Going, no, clear! The world around him jumped back into focus before he could even realized it had left. Fear coursed through him, making him tremble beneath the hands that held and touched him. Proximity faintly blinked across his badgered mind but he paid it no heed. They were trying to help him. Stop the pain. Stop the burning... right? Through half lidded eyes he saw a man, doctor no doubt, pull out a long needle. An unknown, to Lincoln that is, substance sat within its vile. Even despite the fact that he knew it was coming he couldn't stop his tortured scream as the needle broke into the skin of his arm. And with a pain that he swore would brand his sensitive nerves for the rest of his life he succumbed to darkness. disclaimer: don't own 'the island' ","Summary":" Lincoln Six Echo was staring vacantly at the white popcorn of his ceiling.

A/N: Just a quick one-shot about that pregnant clone. I don't know her name, but oh well. We'll call her... Cloney. All my life, the belief of the \"island\" was something glorified, something to work towards. But now, as my heart began to fail, I understood the twisted, cryptic message that they meant. I fought, I fought for my baby, for the life that we could have, that we should have. But the more I fought, the more I wanted to scream, the farther I was drifting away. Suddenly the black in my vision shifted to a beautiful island. The water was a clear blue, and brushed up against the hot sand. The sun burned down onto the grains of sand trickling through my toes. I brushed my hand through my chocolaty brown hair, all my worries suddenly leaving me. A sudden urge to submerge myself in the cool water and let my body soak up the refreshment was tempting. Involuntarily, my feet began to trudge towards the coolness. But something stopped me. Everything seemed to flow back into my mind, slamming into my head. I fell to the ground, gripping my head in agony. \"You are special.\" Dr. Merrick's face was the only thing lighting up the now pitch black sky, his lips curling into a crinkly smirk. \"You want to go to the island.\" \"No,\" I cried. \"No, I don't. Send me back. I-I want to live!\" \"You have a purpose,\" his voice continued. The dark sky flickered with electricity, images shooting across it. I gasped, watching as a blond woman was zipped into a body bag. Jordan Two Delta. \"Stop!\" I screeched, intertwining a clump of my hair between my fingers. \"Let me go!\" Everything went silent, for which I was grateful. Slowly and carefully, I sat up, heaving a sigh of relief. But one thing sent my world to shards. The cry of a baby. My baby. I looked up to see my crying child being handed off to some stranger... a stranger who looked a lot like me. \"He's so beautiful,\" the woman choked out, cradling the baby in her arms with the tenderest affection. \"Thank you.\" The nurse smiled warmly. \"Congratulations.\" I reached up to the sky, trying to touch my beautiful baby's porcelain colored face. I tried my hardest to no avail, falling on my back into the sand. \"That was supposed to be my fate,\" I sobbed. I closed my eyes, letting my soul drift away with the sea.

Richard Tyler was no exception, while he dug his fingers into a Post-It note bookmark inside the pages. The covers thumped like wooden planks onto his desk, and he came face-to-face with two long pages of thick, bold text, and several photos full of people in snazzy, sophisticated clothing, cities full of bright lights, and dozens of old automobiles cruising along paved roads. Richard blinked a few times to adjust to the bright colors and almost tangible emotion coming from those pictures. He didn't remember ever seeing something so grand, or loud, for lack of a better word, in his history book before. \"The Roaring Twenties,\" his teacher said, scrawling the words across the green blackboard. \"The first time in our history that America absolutely lit up, in the cities, in the household! Fashions, and ways of life were changing. Even our ways of thinking were challenged, with cars, credit cards, and all sorts of debates between things like evolution and religion…\" And so it went on. Richard tried to pay attention, but he was drawn far too much to the pictures in his book. So he turned himself comfortably around in his desk, and picked up the edges of the book to draw it closer to his face. Through the lenses of his round glasses, he scanned the detail of the photos and paintings, even focusing on some passages in the text. \"Geez,\" he whispered, so low that not even his friend, Travis, could hear him from the next desk over. \"Imagine riding in one of those old cars. They must have been really noisy, or something…\" Almost involuntarily, Richard reached into his pocket, and pulled out a little silver object. He placed it in his lap under his desk, turning it over and over in his hands. The object was the size of a padlock, and looked like a closed pocket watch, with a long silver chain that hung in between Richard's fingers. \"Maybe if I put this compass on the page after class,\" Richard whispered to himself. \"I could go into the Twenties, and maybe ride on one of those old things.\" \"Shut up, Rich,\" Travis hissed. \"You want to get us both in trouble, again?\" Richard ignored his friend, just pushing the silver circle further under his desk. \"Hey, you're usually the one who talks, Travis,\" he answered finally. \"Then quit looking at that weird silver thingy and put that book down!\" Travis said through his teeth. \"Rich, Travis,\" the teacher's soft voice asked, while she looked away from the blackboard. \"What was that you both were talking about?\" The two boys kept quiet, while Richard clenched the object tighter inside his caged fingers. \"Thank you,\" the teacher said, before she started to pull down the overhead screen. \"Close call,\" Travis whispered. Richard just nodded his head. The teacher reached for the light switch, and put out the lights, while the students all turned their heads to the screen. When the portable projector started to run a film, Richard snuck his gaze towards his lap, pulling out his fingers to reveal the silver compass. Richard grinned sneakily. The thing in his palms looked like an ordinary silver compass, with a chain and a scratch-free lid to cover what was inside. In fact, it might have looked like an expensive family heirloom, when really, it had been a rather unexpected gift from a just-as-unexpected source. Just a week or so ago, Richard had gone on his standard after-school trip to the library, when Mr. Dewey had given him the compass. He wouldn't explain anything about why Richard should keep it, only that he would have wonderful adventures with it, when he opened a book. Knowing the old librarian, Richard couldn't quite take him seriously at first, but there was still some form of truth to what Mr. Dewey had said. Even though Richard thought it was kind of impossible, he could still feel the otherworldliness of the compass, despite how ordinary it seemed. At last, Richard came to learn just how powerful the compass was that very night, for he placed it within the open pages of a book- The Wizard of Oz - and had been transported directly into the heart of the Munchkin city in Oz. Shortly after, Richard met Dorothy and Toto, accompanying them on their journey to the Emerald City, while they made some new friends and new enemies. The compass was like a reluctant companion, having taken on real emotions and ways of communication like a human being, while it revealed all the magic and power it really had. But the instant Richard had returned to reality, it never showed an ounce of that, shutting itself up like a sleeping fairy. It had been a magnificent journey, since the very first one Richard had taken in the library that one stormy night. And he looked forward to taking another adventure into a book, accompanied by his trusty compass. The problem however, was that Richard was always too busy or too tired to step into another book. Richard's heart drooped while he glanced at the silent compass, and then at the screen, where the sparkling lights of a city glared back at the classroom, casting everyone's faces in bright hues. He supposed that he would have to just get out as quickly as he could, and squeeze in such an adventure. That was, if he didn't have too much studying to do. … . Instead of meeting up with his friends to play a little ball, Richard dashed from the coatroom to the front doors, where he pushed his way through the rushing crowds of excited kids to reach the bike rack. In a few swift motions, he strapped on his helmet, tightened the straps of his backpack, and kicked back the kickstand, pushing off from there. Maneuvering across the sidewalk, between some trotting first-graders and their parents, he followed the cement path to the street, stopping right beside another student on a plain silver bike. Richard's eye caught the shiny glow of the long, strawberry hair falling down the girl's back beside him, growing in a fiery cascade on top of a lettuce-trim T-shirt. He followed the strands to the solid lime-green helmet on her head, where a slightly-pointed nose stuck out from a pale, blemish-free face. Richard cocked his head to get a better look at her face- maybe to see her eye color- but his shadow blocked the late afternoon sun. And she was turning her head to glance back at him. Richard swerved his eyes to look ahead again, and took his time looking both ways. For some reason he couldn't focus his whole attention on the road, only snapping back to reality when he watched the redhead girl ride, pretty gracefully, across the street. Shaking his head, he pressed onto the pedals, and started in the direction of the library once he'd crossed the road. He accidentally turned the corner sharper than he wanted to, squeezing the handlebars like stress balls, even when he was riding straight again. Everywhere he looked, he saw the shine like gold of that girl's hair, like a silken veil beneath her helmet. And even though he only saw them for a fraction of a second, Richard could vividly remember the grassy green in her eyes, like two apples glistening in summer sun. He didn't even know her name, and yet he thought she was the prettiest, sweetest girl he had ever seen. Suddenly, he didn't quite care if she might be an out-of-reach popular girl, or if she wouldn't dare talk to him if he spoke up. At the very least, he had seen her, and could keep that thought of her inside his head. Richard couldn't believe it. He had never experienced this kind of feeling before; the minute he could conceive the image of the girl in his mind, his heart beat the same way it had when he fought that dragon in the library; an excited, nervous thrill that he couldn't place a name on at all. Part of him enjoyed it, because it was a sweet, but complex feeling that made him feel good inside. Driving his bike through the trees, Richard wondered if maybe the girl would enjoy riding her bike through the park with him. He couldn't imagine very much that they would talk about, but still, he wouldn't mind at least trying a joke or two to make her laugh. That was, if he could even approach her so easily. Finally, Richard stopped himself at the wrought-iron gates to the park. Beyond them, he could spot the doors of the library, labeled by the tall marble columns and the stone lion guardians. It was a pretty sight, with the spring wind blowing the trees across the path, as if waving for someone to come through the park and pull open the library doors. So Richard didn't hesitate to answer that call; he dismounted his bike, and pulled open one high gate, pushing his bike onto the path while the gate clanged closed behind him. But then, he stopped short. Despite the loud swishing of the tree branches, he could hear something else being carried through the air. It was low, but delicate, filled with passion. It was high-pitched, and musical, like a bird at the early dawn. A voice- of a young girl. Richard clenched the handlebars of his bike tighter, and wandered along a diverging path to follow the voice. He ducked beneath the lowering branches, avoiding some overgrowing patches of shrubbery, until he reached almost another part of the park, where it was enclosed by tall walls of bushes and trees, with a few benches here and there. Not too far off from Richard, one stone bench was spotlighted by the sun peeking over the high bush wall. Propped against the wall, was a simple metal bike, with a lime-green helmet dangling from one of the handlebars. And there she was, just standing up from the bench, with a paperback book in her hand, and her long fiery locks of hair tumbling on her back in the breeze while she got to her feet. Richard ducked back behind the wall the instant he recognized her, although he was absolutely transfixed with rapture. The way the sun glinted off the girl's hair when it caught the wind, and how her green eyes glinted against the sky, tied Richard's heart in knots, pulsing harder for air again. Finally, he had to duck entirely out of the way, holding his chest to steady his nerves, while the girl spoke to the open air. \"'Deny thy father, and refuse thy name',\" she said with utmost passion, \"'or be but sworn my love and I'll no longer be a Capulet!'\" Richard could only slowly turn his head. Just yards away from him, was the clear voice from somewhere other than planet earth. He closed his eyes for just a second, pretending that she was speaking to him… \"'Tis but thy name that is my enemy. Thou art thyself and not a Montague. What is Montague?'…\" Yeah, what is Montague? Richard wondered. That's actually a funny name. He covered his lips with a spare hand, trying to cover a laugh, and a stifled gasp at what immense expression he was listening in on. \"'Oh, be some other name.\" She paused after she spoke, sighing deeply over the sound of the trees. \"'What's in a name? That which we call a rose, by any other name would smell as sweet. So Romeo, were he not Romeo called, retain that dear perfection which he owes without that title.'\" I don't know what she's really saying, but she has the right voice for it. Maybe she'll stop soon, so I can tell her what a great job she's doing… \"'Oh, Romeo, doth thy name! And for that name, which is no part of thee, take all myself!'\" The girl's voice was loud enough for Richard to hear her joyous giggles, like sweet bells on a rainy day. The way Richard thought about it, the girl seemed to be having a ball reciting strange language like that, although she still risked being spotted alone. Still, Richard stood stagnant, trying to remember every perfect word that the girl had said. He didn't know whether it was the language, or the way she'd said it, that made his heart swell, but he knew one thing for certain. \"I should ask Mr. Dewey about those words. If there's anyone, he'll know for sure where I can find them.\"[Chapter 2] Chapter 2 Richard crossed the wide expanse of park as though a giant crow were chasing him, clomping up the front stairs of the library and swinging the doors open so that they flung all the way to the wall. He was at the front desk in less than a second, looking over the top of the high desk for any sign of Mr. Dewey. \"Good heavens! Oh, good to see you, my boy,\" the aging librarian exclaimed, snapping his head up to look at a heaving Richard. He squinted through his thinly-framed spectacles, pushing aside the papers he was looking at. \"Why, what's the matter? You look as though the devil himself, or Edward Hyde, chased you in here!\" \"No, no,\" Richard said, inhaling to his lungs' capacity. \"I-I just wanted to ask you…if…maybe…you knew about…something.\" \"Something, you say?\" Mr. Dewey asked, standing up from his swiveling desk chair. \"And what might this 'something' be, boy?\" Once more, Richard took in more air, and straightened his shirt, which was twisted from his fast run. He looked right at Mr. Dewey and explained all he knew about the pretty girl in the park, with her sweet and passionate voice, and the interesting words she'd been reading aloud to the sunny afternoon. Mr. Dewey kept an interesting expression on his wrinkled features, furrowing his eyebrows the more that Richard spoke. Finally, Mr. Dewey just smiled, and cracked an exuberant laugh. \"What's so funny?\" Richard said. Mr. Dewey stopped laughing, and grinned down at Richard. \"Oh, dear me, I should have known that that would be Chloe. The park is her favorite place to read, and practice all the scripts. She's an actress, you know.\" Richard shook his head, not ready to listen to any nonsense. \"Mr. Dewey, who is Chloe?\" he asked, keeping his voice was low, but firm. Mr. Dewey answered at last, although he put on a strange, and knowing, smile. Chloe…ah, Chloe is my granddaughter. And I suppose you think her to be a pretty little lady, do you, Richard Tyler?\" \"Yeah. Er, no…um, maybe?\" Richard sputtered, clenching his teeth nervously. If the girl he had saw was in fact Mr. Dewey's granddaughter, the interesting possibilities of what the old librarian could offer, made Richard's stomach turn in circles. But then, could he introduce him to Chloe? Would she like him? \"Well, do not take my word for it, boy,\" Mr. Dewey replied. \"From the sound of it, she was confessing her own attraction already. Chloe was introduced to William Shakespeare long before today, and Romeo and Juliet is one of her favorites to perform.\" \" Romeo and Juliet ?\" Richard asked. \"Oh, dear boy, only Shakespeare's most wonderful play, and one of the best in the world of theatre,\" said Mr. Dewey, who seemed to become transfixed with wonder, even from his own words. \"Well then, methinks that if you want to know more about the play, all you have to do is look through yonder theatre section. Love is quite abundant within the play, and, in your state of mind, you may just enjoy it as much as little Chloe does.\" Well, that much, at least, Richard knew. Up until now, he had never heard that much about William Shakespeare or Romeo and Juliet, except for the fact that it was a romance. But, if he could maybe learn a little more about Chloe, just through taking a closer look at the play, then it just might be worth a try. A little magic with books never hurt anyone, of course. \"Okay, Mr. Dewey,\" Richard said, thumbing the circular lump in his pocket. \"Can you show me where that is?\" \"I'd be most obliged to,\" Mr. Dewey said, gesturing for Richard to follow him. The two of them proceeded through one of several aisles that branched off from the main lobby, with bookshelves shooting up on either side of them; even after so many visits, Richard felt he might never stop being in awe of the size of those shelves. It was like they were built by giants' hands, but with books nestled comfortably into every square inch. Mr. Dewey showed nothing but his utmost enthusiasm while they walked, keeping an excited stride several steps ahead of a lingering Richard. He never stopped to slow down, even when he turned a corner, so Richard had to speed his step tenfold just to keep Mr. Dewey in sight. So he was already short of breath when the librarian stopped at an aisle- a series of aisles, really- marked \"Theatre and Film\". \"Enjoy yourself,\" Mr. Dewey said, before he strode back in the direction of the front desk- wherever that was now. Once Mr. Dewey vanished around the corner again, Richard stepped into the aisle, and scaled the shelves for Shakespeare. At first, he thought of using the compass to find a copy of the play, when he remembered that the only thing it could direct him to here, was the front desk. Sullenly, he stuffed it back in his pocket, and put his finger to the spines of the books before him, reading the names of the volumes one by one. He had gone all the way down the aisle, and the very next one, before he came up with something, keeping up the search down the rows of books, before, just above him, he spotted an aged maroon book, with golden letters across the spine written, \" Romeo and Juliet \". It took some effort to reach the shelf, but after some good jumps, and an amazing stretch of his arm, Richard touched at the spine of the book. And with a lurch in his stomach, he crouched down, and launched himself into the air. He just barely caught the covers between his fingers that time, coming back down before the other books could crash down with him. \"Great! Definitely great!\" Richard noted, as he opened the book. Turning a few pages, he read the intricate script on top that indicated which act to turn to. Speedily, he scanned his eyes along each line, looking for any familiarity to match Chloe's words. When at last he managed to spy the poetic monologue, he read it over and over, as if trying to completely re-imagine the moment he had heard Chloe speak them aloud. So it was a long time before he set the open book on the ground in front of him. Richard reached into his pocket, and plucked out the compass, rubbing his thumb on the smooth surface anxiously. He pried open the lid- to reveal the marble face of the compass, with its trembling arrow- and set the compass down upon the open book. The pages suddenly stuck to the compass like paper and glue, while the words on the pages shimmered, like they were underwater in sunlight. The silver exterior was shining a bright, icy blue, as little sparkles of fairy dust danced about the space. Jagged white lines spread around the floor by the book, like spider-webs, while the arrow on the compass face ticked like a clock hand, suddenly snapping to a stop at the \"N\", that pointed north. Then, as Richard watched the book almost disappear under the magical light of the compass, the lights of the library all blacked out.[Chapter 3] Chapter 3 Right after the magic was over, Richard blindly reached around to grasp the compass. No doubt by now it would have regained its abilities as a living thing, and sure enough, Richard could feel the gentle heat of the compass's surface radiating just beneath his fingers. He lowered his hands, and like a loyal puppy, the compass wrapped its chain around Richard's wrist and roped itself into his grip. \"Thanks,\" Richard whispered to the compass, and it glowed a honey-yellow, making Richard's hands feel comfortably warm; it was satisfied for now. Tucking the compass in his hand, Richard looked up, while light gradually flashed back into view, like a fast-motion sunrise. As expected, the library shelves had vanished all around him, replaced with tall, lush trees, and an ancient-looking building hidden behind the shrubbery. It wasn't exactly broad daylight now, but the night was brightened by some stars, and a full moon, casting some silvery light onto the building not very far from where Richard stood. The structure had a wide, broad balcony, which was empty, save for a young girl who leaned on the railing, with her cheek in her hand. Richard was surprised. If he was correct in assuming that that was Juliet, then his shock increased tenfold. She only looked to be about twelve or thirteen years old- barely a young woman at all. He cocked an eyebrow at her. From all that he knew, he had expected her to be taller, older- like someone who could be college-age. But, if Juliet was that young, then, what about Romeo? Richard shook his head, to clear his thoughts away. He was here, wasn't he, inside the play? Then that meant it was time to get down to business, and approach the girl from whom Chloe's beautiful words had come from. Slowly, he moved through the trees, ducking beneath branches and soft leaves to reach the building. He put a hand on the wall, feeling the grainy stone and clay, before he craned his eyes up; Juliet was leaning almost directly over where he stood. Okay, easy now, don't scare her, Richard told himself, while he stood up on his tip-toes again. \"Hello?\" he asked. His voice started out like a whisper, but abruptly turned into almost a shout. Richard flinched; if he couldn't even talk straight to any other girl, like Juliet, what hope was there for Chloe? Juliet drew in a sharp breath, shooting her head down to meet Richard's eyes. She put a hand to her chest, breathing out slowly, although it was a little shaky with fright. \"What man art thou?\" she asked. \"For what time have you stood below me, there?\" Richard hesitated to speak to her, taken aback by Juliet's speech, as it was strange to him at first. \"Whoa, I'm sorry!\" he said, forcing himself to regain his senses. \"I didn't mean to scare you. I-I just wanted to…um, maybe talk to you for a moment.\" Juliet's deer-in-headlights expression softened just a bit, and she took her hand away from her heart. \"Oh,\" she said. \"But, in what way can I speak to thee, when I have no clue to thy name?\" she asked. \"I'm Richard,\" he called up to her. \"Call me by Juliet,\" she answered. Richard wrung his hands nervously for a second, before he attempted to straighten himself again. \"So, um, do you think you could come down here? Or, if I could come…up…there?\" He motioned tentatively towards the tall tree adjacent to where Juliet stood, not quite liking the idea of maybe having to climb it. Juliet looked back and forth between Richard, and the tree he was pointing at, seeming just as confused as he was. Finally, she glanced back down, and moved closer along the balcony railing, towards the tree. Richard gulped. \"If thou wilt do so,\" she said gently, but timidly, \"approach by means of the tree.\" She glanced with a wary eye back at the door towards the end of the balcony, then back to Richard. \"But, hold. Art thou a Montague?\" Richard shook his head, and Juliet relaxed her shoulders again. He approached the tree. He let go of the compass so that it could float freely beneath him, and hoisted himself upon the first branch with shaking legs. Not that Richard was entirely afraid. He just didn't feel confident in making it all the way to the top; the balcony was pretty high up, from where he stood. Maybe he should have asked Juliet to just come down to him, with a cherry on top. But once more, he shook his head to clear away his discomfort, and pulled himself up some more. He did so gradually, but maybe a little too gradually. By the time he'd climbed the next series of branches, the compass had turned a pink lemonade color, wagging its chain like an anxious dog. But then, it stopped, and twirled its chain, lassoing itself around Richard's wrist again. With strength like a full-grown man, the compass yanked Richard up the tree, throwing him onto the balcony railing like a rag doll, and suddenly disappearing behind Richard's back, in less than five seconds. Juliet half-shrieked, clutching the railing with one hand, and the other clamped over her lips. \"Wilt thou be all right?\" Juliet asked, moving to help Richard back on his feet. \"I think so, thanks,\" he answered, craning his head to look behind him at the compass, fixing it with a gee-was-that-really-necessary look. \"Such swiftness, have I never seen a boy climb a tree,\" Juliet remarked, regarding Richard with amazement and shock. \"It's nothing really,\" Richard said, as he snatched the compass behind his back; it seared his hand with a blast of intense heat, but he yanked on the chain to make it stop at once. And Juliet continued to give him that awed look, until he stood back up, and leaned casually against the railing. \"Okay, so I was wondering,\" Richard began, \"if there was…um, anything that you…well, liked …about boys? I mean, how do you like being approached, or, or anything?\" Richard grimaced; he didn't like the way he had worded that question. Juliet looked at him with a mixture of confusion, and even a little bit of pity, which only made Richard feel more awkward. \"I cannot know what, or why, thou asked such questions,\" she said. \"'Tis hard to answer. 'Tis difficult to contemplate, even.\" That was all she said, before it was quiet between them for a while. From inside the house, they could hear the hustling of feet, and the crickets making music in the grass far below. Richard absentmindedly began to play with the compass chain behind his back, not knowing what to do next. Juliet's expression was making his stomach hurt, and he was starting to regret having called to her so soon. Maybe he should have remembered to bring the play with him, than he could have read some more before leaping into action. It took substantial willpower to not jump back up and bail from the balcony. \"But, my Romeo…\" Juliet's words cut through Richard's nerves like a knife in butter, and he averted his gaze to her. Juliet stood up, and leaned back on the balcony railing, looking up at the shining moon. She sighed, and rested her head inside her cupped palms. \"Romeo, Romeo! Wherefore art thou, Romeo?\" she whispered. \"Deny thy father, and refuse thy name. Or if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love and I'll no longer be a Capulet.\" Richard's attention was drawn to Juliet as though she herself were Chloe. He would know those words anywhere, and they sung to him like none other. Instead of Juliet, he heard Chloe speaking aloud, in her sweetly passionate, hearty voice. And almost instantly, he thought he saw, instead of Juliet's long dark hair, strawberry blonde locks, and rather than Juliet's sparkling eyes, he saw bright flecks of shamrock green. It was almost like a miracle to Richard; Juliet was Chloe, and Chloe was Juliet. He had never felt his heart beat so hard, listening to the words being spoken aloud. The raw power of them was enough to make Richard's mind separate completely from reality, and for just a moment, he watched Chloe's silky hands reach to grasp at his side, to take his hand between her fingers. She flicked her green eyes to his, and they absolutely locked him inside them. Never before had there been anything so comforting, and so beautiful, before…. \"I take thee at your word!\" Richard snapped his eyes open, and gasped, at the exact moment as Juliet, the both of them jolting their heads up, and moving quickly in reaction to the new voice. \"Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized. Henceforth I will never be Romeo!\" Jolting to his feet, Richard grabbed at the tree branch nearest him and flung himself down without any thought at all. The compass didn't need to pull him down; he was tumbling down between the branches as though he were being chased, not stopping until he was on the ground. He slowed down once he touched the grass, but continued to duck under the branches while he moved, so as not to be seen by the approaching Romeo. He heard Juliet speak the same shocked words she had said to him, and, thinking it safe, he looked between the twigs to spy on the scene. \"Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye than twenty of their swords,\" he heard Romeo say. \"Look thou but sweet, and I am proof against their enmity.\" There was a whole new look in Juliet's eyes, now that Romeo had appeared; her eyes were positively shining, her cheeks glowing red with the smile that transformed her face. \"I would not the world they saw thee here,\" she whispered. Beside Richard, the compass glowed a very bright pink, and when he touched it, its warmth was very gentle, like a winter bath. He chuckled under his breath, when he looked between the compass and Romeo and Juliet on the balcony. \"Hey, you think it's cute?\" he asked, a little teasingly. The compass flicked its chain at Richard, thwacking him on his knuckles. He drew back with a flinch, and with a sigh, turned back to stare through the leaves. By this time, Romeo and Juliet were standing face-to-face, with Romeo standing atop a sturdy branch on the same tree Richard had climbed. Their hands were drawing closer and closer to each other. \"Lady, by yonder blessed moon I vow, that tips that tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops-\" Juliet shook her head, looking seriously into Romeo's face. \"O, swear not by the moon,\" she said, \"th' inconstant moon, that monthly changes in her circle orb, lest that thy love prove likewise variable.\" \"What shall I swear by?\" Romeo wanted to know. \"Do not swear at all,\" Juliet answered. \"Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self, which is the god of my idolatry, and I'll believe thee.\" Such words were almost impossible to understand, but to Richard, they sure sounded beautiful. It was kind of lovely because, in this kind of setting, with the moon and stars and quiet nature, the language was almost too perfect. It meant that everything just fit, and that life could not be interrupted by anything. There was only just Romeo, and Juliet, in the moment, together, as Richard had imagined him and Chloe earlier. After a moment of silence, Juliet planted a kiss on Romeo's cheek, and started for the door on the other end of the balcony. \"O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?\" Romeo asked, beckoning for Juliet with his free hand. Juliet turned back, a questioning look in her eye. \"What satisfaction canst thou have tonight?\" she wondered aloud. \"Th' exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine,\" Romeo replied softly. Richard's eyes widened. He whispered those same words under his breath, as though he was hearing such poetry for a second time, and then turned to the compass, whose chain was twisted into two circle shapes, both glowing a bright golden white, like diamonds. Some more words were whispered, while slowly, a golden light crept over the edges of the trees. Richard turned to glance over his shoulder, and through the intertwining leaves and sticks, he saw the dawn of day, sparkling in rays across everything. He whipped himself back around, and both Romeo and Juliet's faces were glowing a golden color. They looked to the horizon for a moment, before the loving smiles, and sparkling eyes returned. \"I would I were thy bird,\" Romeo whispered close to Juliet's face. \"Sweet, so would I,\" Juliet said. \"Yet I should kill thee with such cherishing. Good night, good night. Parting is such sweet sorrow, that I shall say good night till it be morrow.\" She wrapped her arms around Romeo, and, closing her eyes, touched her lips to his. He reached up slowly, and brushed her hair around her head, playing with it while he pulled her closer to him. Richard backed away, not really wanting to see much of this scene. And while the sun pulled itself higher into the sky, he kneeled down to the ground, followed by the compass. \"Gee, it seems pretty easy, doesn't it?\" he said. \"A girl like Chloe would definitely like to hear something like that.\" For a long time, Richard sat thoughtfully in the dirt beneath the cover of the trees, wondering how on earth he could present himself to Chloe. If she liked Romeo and Juliet , of course he should use something from the play; and, from what he had seen between the characters, the right effects would be pretty simple to accomplish. The hard part was, figuring out how to catch her at the right time, and which words sounded best. But by now, the sun had risen high enough to glare right into Richard's eyes, and from nearby, he could already hear some early-morning marching. From who, he did not know, but he wondered if perhaps it might be time to go back home. \"What time is it, back home?\" he asked the compass. Snapping to attention, the compass flipped open, showing its marble face. But the face flipped over like a page, to reveal a marble clock face, with intricately-designed numbers, and the same black hands. Richard observed the time on the clock, and then stood back up, careful not to stand too high so that he could be seen by anyone. \"Okay, then,\" he said. \"Hold still.\" When the compass closed back up, Richard plucked it from the air, and then placed it on the ground. He glanced around him one more time, to be sure that no one was coming, and then straightened himself. \"Let's go home,\" he whispered. In response, the compass snapped open like a broken box, and shone a bright silver color. Everything around it leaned towards the open compass, like it were a strong magnet, even Richard. A little twister of fairy dust expanded from out of the compass, twirling faster and faster, until Richard couldn't resist the force any more. He gave a little jump, and was pulled into the whirlwind of magic, turning around continuously, while the world of Romeo and Juliet seemed to vanish out of sight, melting away into darkness.[Chapter 4] Chapter 4 Clutching the copy of Romeo and Juliet under his arm, Richard caught the last few rays of afternoon sunshine, while he speed-walked towards his bike on the edge of the park. The air was quiet, the trees stagnant, while a familiar voice carried across the open sky. Richard forced himself to not turn in the direction of Chloe's Juliet-voice, but it sure as heck did make his heart turn over. He clenched his fingers against the ancient cover of the book, and tapped the lifeless compass in his pocket. Holding those two things in his hands made him stride even faster across the grass; he could see himself spouting Shakespeare alongside Chloe already. But first, he had a project to do. Now that he'd seen what Romeo and Juliet was like, all he had to do was choose a passage- or two- and keep them locked away in his mind. No matter what, he wasn't going to let himself forget, for he planned to make the moment very special. For so wonderful a first crush as Chloe, \"special\" meant perfection. … .. With his heart punching at his ribs, Richard spoke softly to himself, following his planned approach as closely as he could. Quietly, he followed Chloe down the sidewalk while she rode her bike, careful not to stare too much at her. But that was much easier said than done. On this particular day- sunnier than the previous one- her hair was tied back into a half-braid that tumbled down her back, tangling with the rest of the strands. There were even some dandelions tied into the elastic, arranged so that the band couldn't be seen under the yellow petals. Richard just couldn't help but smile at her, as he watched her braid swing to and fro underneath her shining green helmet. He was both excited, and scared out of his wits, about what he was going to do, so he continued to speak aloud his rehearsed lines. So by the time he was parked at the intersection beside Chloe, he couldn't even remember strapping on his helmet, and kicking away from the bike rack. But once more, they were stuck there for a long time, between the excited first-graders and their parents, before they could cross. Richard whispered the words to himself, squeezing his handlebars until his skin was alabaster white. He dared not look at Chloe, for fear he would lose concentration, and wind up forgetting everything, so he switched between looking at the houses ahead, and the battered copy of Romeo and Juliet tucked in Chloe's tiny bike basket. At long last, they could ride away, and Richard practically threw himself forward, pedaling towards the library swiftly at first, but slowed down when he remembered that girls couldn't stand the smell of sweat. Still, he double-checked everything when he arrived in the park. He combed his fingers through his hair, pulled on his button-down shirt, and lifted his arms to be sure there were no sweat-stains; he breathed a deep sigh of relief when he checked there, gaining just an ounce of confidence back. He retrieved the compass from his pocket, and stroked his thumb across the lid. He could not believe this was happening. For the first time in forever, he had actually found the courage to approach a girl. And not just any girl, but Chloe- a Shakespeare fan, the granddaughter of Mr. Dewey, who strapped flowers into her hair, and spent her afternoons in the park, instead of primping in front of a mirror. Every other girl that Richard knew preferred television to books, and Green Day to Shakespeare. How better of a girl could someone like him find? Then, there came the rustling of bushes, and the metallic spring of a kickstand against the grass. Richard froze, but then made his way towards the secluded part of the park where he had first heard Chloe's voice. But if the first time had been magical, this time, it was heavenly. He heard her say a different set of words, but there was still the heart inside of them. At times, she stopped to clear her throat, and then get started again, so, Richard began to see his chance. It took a couple of moments to calm his excited heartbeat, and breathe normally again, but Richard knew this was the right moment; it was now or never. He stepped inside the space, his hands casually behind his back, and kept his eyes on the bench ahead of him, hoping to catch Chloe's attention. She stopped speaking, frozen in place. When she didn't speak, Richard turned his head to look at her. She had that same deer-in-headlights that he had seen on Juliet's face, but framed within a much prettier face. While they both looked at each other, Chloe's face softened and relaxed, until her eyes started to widen. \"I know you,\" she said, finally. \"I saw you after school on our bikes, the other day.\" \"Yeah, I know,\" Richard agreed, relieved that she was speaking to him. \"So, um…what are you doing?\" Chloe held up her book which, Richard could see, was full of annotations and underlined lines, especially Juliet's. \"Wow! Shakespeare?\" Richard asked, pretending to be surprised. \"Yes. You know Shakespeare?\" Chloe wondered aloud, with undeniable awe showing inside her grassy eyes; it must have seemed that she was the only one who knew about the playwright, the way she looked at Richard. \"Yeah, a little,\" Richard answered. \"I-I've actually seen some of ' Romeo and Juliet ' before.\" \"So have I,\" said Chloe. \"I like to read aloud the part of Juliet, even though I'm not exactly an actress.\" \"Really? Mr. Dewey said you were an actress.\" Chloe giggled; a sweet sound to Richard's ears. \"You've met my grandpa?\" she asked. \"Oh, gosh, he always says that. I come here so often, he must think I really am one. Yes, my grandpa likes to play pretend a lot too, cause he loves books so much. I'm surprised no circus performers ever asked him to join, for his energy.\" Richard laughed; the idea of someone like Mr. Dewey performing in a circus would be ludicrous enough to sell to a playground jokester. Not that he ever would, but the thought did make him crack up a little. \"So, um…Chloe?\" The words were out of Richard's mouth before he could think. \"Yes?\" Chloe asked, pulling the word out. \"Uh…well, um…\" Richard stammered helplessly. This was supposed to be the moment of truth. He was going to tell her, just how special she was. But the glorious moment went on longer than he wanted, and yet he still hadn't sputtered out any words of feeling towards the girl. \"Were you going to say something?\" Chloe wanted to know. \"Anything, at all?\" \"I…\" He touched the compass in his pocket. \"'…Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty. Thou art not conquered. Beauty's ensign yet, is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,\" he said quickly, trying to keep from breaking into a cold sweat. \"'…and death's pale flag is not advanced there',\" Chloe finished. Richard's jaw dropped. Chloe just let her book fall on the bench beside her, just staring at Richard's eyes, which had a holy-cow-what-the-heck-did-I-just-say look in them. Then he said, \"I just said something about a…death scene, did I?\" Chloe just nodded, quite pitifully. Richard slapped his forehead, and leaned back behind him. But he thrust himself so far back, that he tumbled off the bench, and all the way into the shrubbery. His legs were left kicking vigorously into the air, while Chloe raced to help him get out. \"Maybe I should have just said, 'I like you', instead,\" Richard muttered, although he was unaware that Chloe was leaning up close to him to pull him out of the bushes. She only smiled. ","Summary":" Chapter 1 \"Okay, everyone, take out your copies of American History , and we'll pick up where we l"},{"Movie":"Pagemaster","Title":"Page Chasers 3, Who's March and Who's Mad?","Author":"GreenWallsOfArt","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6838474","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Chapter 1 In crossing the front lobby of the humongous library, Richard Tyler stomped his feet almost furiously. His steps echoed through the vast building, and his soles squeaked loudly. It was raining outside, so it didn't make for the prettiest day. And it certainly didn't help that Richard was staggering under the weight of the homework he carried at his side in his book bag. Stumbling past the front desk, where the librarian, Mr. Dewey, greeted him with an enthusiastic grin, Richard reached into his bag and pulled out a large silver object, passing it to his other hand to balance out the heavy load. It dangled from a long silver chain, swinging like a pendulum while he stomped across the floor. Most of the people he walked past- two or three at the most- looked up at Richard while his shoes made mice-like sounds on the wooden floor. He didn't pay any attention, instead only collapsing into a chair when he plopped his bag down from his aching shoulder. Heaving a deep sigh, Richard lifted up the silver object in his hand, and flipped open a lid. What he saw before him was the marble face of a compass, but when he turned that over, it was now a clock. The intricate black hands didn't tick. They just stared back at Richard from their marble surface like a three-dimensional painting. \"Geez,\" Richard sighed. \"I would take a day in the day world over five hours of homework any day.\" He grumbled softly, leaning back into the red plush upholstery. \"Aye! Pi Day used to be so much fun.\" He then reached into his bag and took out a worn-out yellow pocket folder that had worksheets falling out of it. They slipped into his lap, and long word problems glared back at Richard. Richard grumbled once more. It was March 14th, so his teacher had made a ridiculous claim to making Pi Day a day of working out math problems, instead of pigging out on pie and cookies and cake like all the other classes did. While complicated problems continuously came up on the overhead screen, Richard could hear the other classes giggling and screeching while they scrambled for the first slice of yummy pie. It wasn't that Richard didn't like math- he just didn't enjoy taking too much at once, and not being able to have fun with it like the other classes. It was Pi Day after all- it would have been nice to have a slice of pie, and take it easy with a little class party. So, Richard let his head fall into the back of his chair, and shut his eyes for a moment. A day full of nothing but math had been hard, and now, his teacher had \"treated\" his class to three worksheets of challenging math problems. Those sheets alone could take over three hours, over everything else he had to do. Oh, boy, could he go for some pie now. Or, maybe something else too… Richard glanced around him, at the polished wooden tables, and the high shelves full of books. The fiction section was just beyond them. And what with the number of people here at the library now, his range of choice would be almost infinite. Finally, Richard stuffed the folder back into his bag, and, tucking it into the corner behind his chair, picked up the silver compass. Quickly, he made his way towards the main lobby again, choosing a shelf to scour once he was there again. He didn't care much which part of the fiction section he ended up at, so long as he could find a book that the compass could easily work its magic on. And that was anything. Turning a corner, he found the first shelves. At a leisurely pace, he began to scan the rows of books, running his finger along the spines, and readjusting his glasses every few minutes to better find the small titles. But it wasn't too long before he turned to go into another aisle. He much anticipated looking at the next title, already pulling up his glasses to examine the books. But his eyes fell on something else. At the other end of the shelf, a girl with thick, shimmery hair the color of roses, was reaching up to take a book from the shelf. She lifted the book so that her long, slightly-pointed nose stuck into the pages, and then she took her face back out, grinning curiously. \"Hey, Chloe!\" Richard called before he could think to stop himself. Chloe snapped her head up to look at Richard, and she closed her book with her thumb between the pages. \"Oh, hi, Richard,\" she said demurely. \"Good to see you.\" \"You too,\" Richard added timidly. Chloe held her book to her chest, smiling. \"So, can I help you find something?\" she asked, gesturing to the shelf beside her. \"I don't know,\" Richard answered with a shrug. \"I'm just looking for a good book. I've had a long day.\" \"I know how you feel,\" Chloe said. \"Pi Day! Ugh. I mean, I do love pie. But I can't stand those really hard challenge problems they give you in school.\" She turned around in a quick twirl, and grinned further. \"It's good to be home, in the library.\" \"You can say that again,\" Richard sighed. Chloe giggled. \"Anyway,\" Chloe began, \"about that book. I think, if you want a good escape from things that don't make sense, why not take a little adventure into Wonderland?\" Richard did a double take. \" You're not making any sense,\" he answered. Chloe shook her head, making an amused sound through her teeth. \" Alice in Wonderland is a different kind of nonsense. It's not like you're working with numbers right and left. It's about riddles and strange creatures. For me, at least, it makes me laugh, rather than twist my brain up.\" \"I don't know,\" Richard said, shrugging helplessly. \"Come on, trust me,\" Chloe said. \"And, besides, it's March. It means March Madness. I think it works out rather well.\" \"Maybe too well,\" Richard murmured. \"Oh, now don't be a pessimist. Follow me!\" Chloe turned the corner of the shelf, and paused at each one to observe the author markers on the sides. Finally, her lips turned upright, and she walked into that shelf, coming out seconds later with an old leather-bound copy of Alice in Wonderland . \"Here,\" she said. \"Try it out.\" \"Well…okay,\" Richard said, taking the book from Chloe. \"Thanks. I guess I'll be going now.\" Once he had turned around, Richard smirked at her choice of story. He wasn't sure this would work out, but he still held the compass high in his other hand, while he turned into another aisle. He opened up to the first page, and laid the book flat on the floor. Flipping open the compass, he placed it in top of the binding. The pages stuck to the compass, and the words on the paper shimmered. The silver exterior was shining an icy blue, as little sparkles of fairy dust danced about. Jagged white lines spread around the floor by the book, like spider-webs, while the arrow on the compass face ticked like a clock hand, halting at the \"N\", that pointed north. Richard prepared to jump into the book, spreading his legs apart to go. \"Richard, wait up!\" Chloe called abruptly. \"I forgot to mention something…\" Before Richard could move, the compass's magnetic pull already snagged him, pulling him in. And above the gentle hiss of the magic, he heard footsteps clopping into the aisle. \"Oh! Richard!\" Richard whipped his head behind him, and saw Chloe struggling against the force of the compass's magic. But it was too late to give her a hand in escaping. They both stood inches from being pulled into the book. In fact, the world was already going dark, the icy glow from the compass disappearing, and Chloe's startled voice fading away.[Chapter 2] Chapter 2 Richard stayed absolutely still while the light came back to the world. He waited before he reached for the compass in the dark, and while it roped itself into his hands, he heard Chloe gasp loudly near him. \"Richard, where are you?\" she asked. Richard's heart skipped a beat; Chloe actually didn't sound very afraid. Just confused, it seemed, while they stood in the black. \"I'm over here, follow the compass,\" he said, while the compass glowed a gentle yellow. And then, when Chloe's hand was silhouetted against the light, the glow changed to the glare of sunlight, as the world returned around them. Chloe staggered a little on her feet, but she appeared unharmed. \"Wow, what a ride,\" she said softly. And once more, she shocked Richard with how unafraid she was. He remembered the first time he had ever gone into a book world, how he thought he might be trapped there for good, and that he would be eaten alive by uneaten forces. Especially in a dim hallway such as this, there was no telling what was hiding behind the walls. And yet, Chloe remained as confident as though she were walking into a strange, but somewhat familiar, place. But Richard didn't ask much about such things. Instead, he glanced around a second time, and observed where they had landed. When he finally looked down, he noticed that he and Chloe were standing in a heap of leaves and twigs below a long, dark hole in the ceiling. Chloe, too, seemed to be trying to see where they should go from where they were. They were now in the middle of a long hallway, lit from above by chandeliers, and doors lining the walls. There appeared to be no way out, and this only made Richard further question Chloe's choice into giving him Alice in Wonderland in the first place. In fact, he gave her the same look he would give to someone who had told him a stupid riddle with an even more stupid answer. \"What were you thinking?\" he asked her at last. Chloe tucked some hair behind her ear, and looked around the hall in one motion. \"Okay,\" she said. \"Seeing as we are now inside the world of Wonderland, the only thing to do is follow what Alice did.\" \"Talk to the doorknobs?\" Richard asked, a little sarcastically. \"No,\" Chloe said. \"There's got to be a key around here somewhere. On a table, maybe. And a drink, of some sort.\" Richard then followed Chloe as she turned around again, this time facing a three-legged table in the exact center of the hall. She stepped towards it, and plucked a little golden key from the glass surface. Without hesitation, she turned her attention towards a long curtain that covered a substantial part of the wall. She walked to the curtain, lifted it away, and then stuck the key into the wall, pushing her hand into it so that bright sunlight filtered into the room. Richard strained his glasses for a better look; in the wall, there was a door no taller than the average doll. But the door was thin enough that Chloe couldn't stick her head through. She turned her head. \"Richard, get that bottle on the table,\" she said. \"What?\" Richard asked. \"Drink from that bottle,\" Chloe clarified. \"Leave some for me, 'cause we both need to shrink small enough to get through this door.\" Richard did as he was told, and reached for the glass bottle on the table where the key had been. He took note of the \"Drink Me\" tag attached to the bottle, and, with a shrug, took a sip. He clicked his tongue a few times to decide on the flavor, because it seemed very mixed to him- like pineapple, and buttered toast. It was a strange taste, before he felt a curious tingling sensation all over his skin, and everywhere inside him. All at once, the hall seemed to heighten, as if Richard were going down in a glass elevator. But the feeling of shrinking made him feel like his body had fallen asleep, so he stumbled a little when he recognized that he was shrinking, grabbing the chain of the floating compass. The chain flared hot for a moment in surprise, but grew cold when it was pulled all the way down with Richard to the floor. At this height, Richard had to run a good deal just to get to the door, which had been abandoned since Chloe went to get her share of the magic drink. Followed by the compass, he pulled open the door to see beyond. He smirked a little when he noticed the short passage behind the door, but once he had gone far enough, his face glowed with awe. He walked forth into a splendid area of green grass and colorful flowerbeds. Intricately cut shrubbery lined the garden, decked with tall poles with hearts at the top. The sky above was absolutely blue, without a cloud in sight. The place was rather quiet too, except, in a moment, Richard jumped when a hedgehog scurried across his path. And he could have sworn he also heard some squawking nearby; in fact, the compass tapped him with its chain, and pointed off towards a tall flamingo mingling among the flowerbeds. \"Whoa,\" Richard murmured, surprised at seeing such creatures living in so fine a place. The compass also turned a few times, as if it were a head glancing around at the grand beauty of everything. He then heard a gentle snapping of the grass behind him, as Chloe stepped out from the doorway. \"Oh, boy, if only Alice had it that easy,\" she said, closing the door ajar behind her, while she walked up beside Richard and the compass. \"But, isn't it beautiful, Richard?\" she asked. \"Oh, yeah. Pretty,\" Richard agreed. Chloe nodded, flicking her eyes in each direction to observe the springy details of the garden. \"Why don't we explore a little?\" she offered, gesturing around her. \"I'm sure no one will mind if we stay here a little.\" \"Unless the Queen of Hearts catches us first,\" Richard said, a tad uncertainly. Chloe shook her head. \"Relax, Richard,\" she said, stepping over to a flowerbed to observe the clusters of white roses. \"Nothing's going to happen. And if it does, we'll just ask your magic compass to take us back.\" Richard looked at the compass, who looked back at him, glowing a dark grey. It lifted its chain like a shrug, and Richard mimicked it. He gave Chloe another unsure expression, and tentatively followed her further into the garden. He followed her to the same white roses, and touched their tiny petals. It was kind of relaxing to him, to touch the soft silk of the roses. But somehow, Richard found himself laughing to himself. He knew of some versions of Alice in Wonderland where a group of card soldiers painted these white roses red. He rubbed the petals harder between his fingers the more he thought of feeling painted flowers. He didn't know why anyone would want that for such pretty things, but then, he figured maybe it was the twisted logic of Wonderland. He stole another smirk at Chloe when he thought of that. Still, even the compass seemed to like being around the flowerbeds. It flew through the clusters, turning different colors as if to mimic theirs. And Richard couldn't help but give the silver compass a funny look. He knew the compass to be like a tightly wound clock, but he had never seen it so joyful. It actually reminded him of his old book friend, Horror, when he had first arrived in the fantasy section, and how he laughed like a little kid while prancing among the flowers. Richard finally chuckled, watching the compass while it flew like a bird from flowerbed to flowerbed. Chloe laughed from behind Richard, and she stepped up next to him, carrying a tiny rosebud in her palm. \"I didn't think a compass could be so happy,\" she noted. \"It's kind of like a little kid.\" \"Not really,\" Richard said. \"That thing is usually like a gruff old grandpa.\" \"Then maybe you should bring it here more often,\" Chloe whispered. \"Maybe, but…\" Richard let his voice trail off, fixing Chloe with a questioning gaze. \"I've been meaning to ask you about this. How is it you're not scared about being here, in the world of books, when…?\" A loud trumpet sounded from just beyond the garden, cutting Richard off short. Then he and Chloe watched while a long parade of card-like people marched in twos. A large group of little ones danced in between them, laughing and screeching, all covered with hearts. And finally, after the entire parade passed, there marched a couple, ornately dressed in hearts and gold and red. The man looked a little stuffy, while the woman was fixing everything she saw with a tight glare. Her lips were tightened on her face so that they made a little heart shape. At the sight of this uptight couple, the compass scrambled out of the flowerbeds, and pulled itself back into Richard's grip, like a dog on a leash. Its glow was dark, while it kept itself low to the ground. Richard whispered to Chloe, \"Maybe we should get down on our knees or something.\" \"And I think you're right,\" she whispered back, getting down on the ground. She bent her head to the grass, so that her hair spread out around her. Richard was careful not to snag her hair while he got down beside her, his arms shaking with the inevitable about to happen. \"Who is this?\" a screechy voice said, not too much later. Answer, came there none. \"Idiots!\" the voice screeched again. \"Come on, you two, get up!\" Scrambling, both Richard and Chloe got to their feet, and straightened themselves quickly; Richard took a second longer to straighten his collar, and hide the compass behind his back. He had to bite his tongue to keep from crying out at the frightful glare of the Queen of Hearts in front of him. Chloe was straight too, although Richard noticed her struggling to keep a stick-like posture, while the Queen stared her down. \"What's your names, children?\" she asked. It was more of a sneer, really. \"I'm Chloe,\" Chloe said, bending over respectfully. \"I'm R-Ri-Richard,\" he stuttered. \"Don't stammer, you'll make me tired!\" the Queen sighed dramatically. Richard expected Chloe to speak up against the Queen, but she didn't say anything. He and Chloe looked at each other, looking a little shaken to be in the presence of someone who could have them executed in seconds. \"Don't be so tight-lipped, you're wasting my time!\" the Queen exclaimed. \"We don't mean to,\" Chloe said, bowing her head again. \"You see, Your- Your Majesty- we came through a door, and we were just about to be on our way when your procession came through here.\" \"Yeah!\" Richard blurted. \"So, if you could let us go, we won't bother you anymore.\" \"Can you play croquet?\" the Queen asked. \"What?\" Richard and Chloe asked at the same time. \"Can…you…play… croquet ?\" the Queen screeched at them both. \"Yes, a little,\" Chloe answered first, very timidly. \"Not…exactly,\" Richard whispered, after a long moment of silence. The Queen's face turned the same bright shade of scarlet as Chloe's hair, and pointed furiously at Richard's nose. \"Off with his head! Off with his head!\" The crowd started to move towards Richard, but both Chloe and the compass stepped between them. \"No!\" Chloe shouted. \"That's not fair!\" \"If I say it, then it is fair!\" roared the Queen. \"But you can't behead someone just for not knowing how to play a game,\" Chloe protested. \"Oh, come now, any idiot can play croquet!\" said the Queen. \"It's so easy.\" \"Well, how?\" Richard piped up in a squeaky voice. The Queen let out a screechy rasp, and put her hand on her hip. \"Why, with flamingos and hedgehogs of course. The other royals do it with ballets and balls.\" She sighed, once more quite theatrically. \"That's too hard! Using live flamingos and hedgehogs are a thousand times easier and simpler! My whole court thinks so!\" There was a collective murmuring among the procession, while the Queen stomped her feet. \"On with the game!\" she yelled. The court scattered, going to fetch what they needed for the game. Richard and Chloe just stayed as they were, not knowing what they should do. They both looked at each other, but gradually, Chloe got a sparkle in her eye again. \"What are you thinking about?\" Richard asked. The compass shot up, and cocked itself to the side, glowing dark grey and then getting brighter and brighter, facing Chloe. \"It's so simple, Richard,\" she said. \"We'll just have to get out while everyone's trying to set up. The Queen won't notice; she'll be too busy severing people's heads off.\" She whispered the last part. \"It's- it's a fine day,\" a shy voice said shakily from below them. Richard and Chloe looked down to see a white rabbit in a poncho ornamented with hearts standing below them. It was pricking its ears up and down, flicking its eyes tentatively around it. \"Hi,\" Chloe said. \"Can we do something for you?\" \"Just help us to prepare for the Queen's game,\" the White Rabbit replied. \"Get to your places!\" the Queen shouted, and the game was quick to begin then. \"Looks like you already have,\" Richard whispered. \"Right then,\" said the White Rabbit. \"Move along.\" \"I'll take that as our signal to go,\" Chloe said, starting to move behind the hedge at the perimeter of the garden. Richard was only too glad to oblige in following her, for he feared the Queen turning around at any given second and shouting for his head to be severed from his neck. The minute the thought struck him, he yanked on the compass's chain, and started after Chloe. Chloe, who was already several yards down the hedge, stopped, wiping her forehead. \"Phew,\" she whispered. \"That was close.\" Richard nodded, while the compass wilted to the ground from his hand. He picked it up again, and glanced behind him. He could hear the Queen's maniacal shouts of \"Off with his head!\" or \"Off with her head!\", but no one was coming around the corner after them. \"We should just go away from here,\" he said, \"before someone finds us.\" \"You're too late,\" a voice said from nowhere in particular. \"I already have.\" Both Richard and Chloe gasped, bumping against each other in their first steps to moving away. \"Who's there?\" they asked. Then, just inches away, there was a cat, though it didn't look like an ordinary cat. It was large and fat, with dark stripes covering its body, floating in midair like a ghost. It had cute little ears, and bright beady eyes, but most of all, a large and uncanny smile that stretched from one side of its face to the other. \"You're the Cheshire Cat!\" Chloe exclaimed. \"Thank you,\" said the Cat, purring gently while it grinned brightly at her. \"And you two are little children. And isn't it a beautiful day?\" \"Can we go now?\" Richard asked the Cat. \"We're trying to move on, so, do you think we can talk later.\" \"No time like the present, as they say,\" the Cat said. \"Although, I do suppose we can talk on the way.\" The two children, the compass, and the Cat moved along the hedges, turning a few more corners, until they couldn't hear the Queen's shouting quite as much. \"How did you like the Queen?\" the Cat asked, on the way. \"Should we even be answering that?\" Richard said. \"She shouldn't even be queen if she is always beheading people like some medieval madwoman.\" \"Well, do you think perhaps you can do any better?\" the Cat wanted to know. Richard shrugged. \"Precisely,\" said the Cat. \"That's why I don't say that about the Queen. I'd hate to be Queen, or King.\" \"Is there anywhere you think we can go, where the Queen won't look for us?\" Chloe wanted to know, looking up at the Cat. \"I know,\" answered the Cat. \"Way off in that direction-\" it pointed with one paw \"-is a Hatter. And in that other-\" it pointed with its other paw \"-is a March Hare. Please. Do visit any one you like.\" \"Do you think you can come with us?\" Chloe said. \"Maybe they would like having you.\" The Cat grinned, and laughed through its teeth. \"I never get involved with the Hatter and the March Hare. I think it's amusing merely to watch them, and laugh at what new tricks they've learned from drinking tea from breakfast till dinner.\" \"Well…\" Chloe shrugged helplessly. \"Maybe we'll see you again soon, Cheshire Cat.\" \"You'll see me, rest assured,\" said the Cat, before disappearing into thin air.[Chapter 3] Chapter 3 Just after the Cheshire Cat disappeared, Richard and Chloe were all alone. A vast forest was spread before them, speckled with sunshine where the trees didn't cover the ground. Winding paths went here and there, with signs that said \"Up\", \"Down\", and \"That Way\", and all sorts of other useless phrases. Among them, there was a sign that pointed into the forest, stating \"Mad Hatter\" and another pointing in the opposite direction, saying \"March Hare\". The group considered their options, and the compass wagged its chain back and forth in confusion. At last, Chloe stepped to the path that seemed to go towards the Mad Hatter, and just like before, Richard didn't hesitate to go down that path also. It was quite a pleasant walk. Since the Queen of Hearts and her court weren't around, the only sounds were the tweeting of various birds, and the swishing of the leaves in the trees. Golden sunshine came between the branches, giving the forest a sweet, comforting glow. Richard took a deep breath, inhaling the scents of flowers that grew between the trees, and he relaxed his shoulders. Chloe seemed pretty carefree herself, getting into a kind of skipping step while she led the way into the forest. It was cute, because her loose hair bounced on the back of her shirt, shining like spun gold while she moved. Richard had to avert his gaze, as he was starting to remember why he had once crushed on her. But soon enough, Chloe stopped, and pointed ahead. \"Look, Richard,\" she said. \"There's the Mad Hatter's house, and the tea table.\" Richard sure could. A huge tea table was set up under a tall tree, in front of a little house tucked between two clusters of trees and shrubbery. It looked very homey in the sunshine, and not to mention the many teapots and cakes set up around the table that made it look very merry indeed. But the only people at the table were a human sized hare, a hatter with a grand top hat, and a dormouse sitting between them. \"Come on,\" Chloe said, skipping down the little hill towards the tea table. \"No room! No room!\" the Hatter cried when he saw Chloe coming down the hill. \"There's no room here!\" the March Hare added, snapping his head back up from his tea. \"Don't mind us,\" Chloe said, putting her hands up. \"My friend and I are here to see how you three are getting along.\" \"Ah,\" said the March Hare understandingly. \"Well then, why don't you have some wine?\" \"No thank you,\" said Chloe. \"Well good then,\" said the March Hare. \"We didn't have some anyway.\" \"Then what was the point of offering it?\" Richard wanted to know, as he stepped up by Chloe. \"What was the point of you barging in without an invitation?\" the March Hare retorted. \"It was just as I said,\" said Chloe. \"We don't mean to stay for very long. It's just a friendly service, you know- stopping by to see how you are doing today.\" Richard nodded to further emphasize his friend's point. \"Then make yourselves presentable,\" said the Hatter at last. \"And I would start by this: get your hair trimmed.\" Chloe sucked in a little breath, and picked up a bunch of her hair to observe. She let it dangle from her fingers while she looked at it, finally letting it drop to her chest again. \"What was that for?\" Richard angrily wanted to know. \"Why don't you sit down?\" asked the Mad Hatter in response. \"We've been here for hours, and no one has ever stopped by.\" \"To say hello, that is,\" added the March Hare. \"Well…er, no problem,\" Richard said with a helpless frown. He didn't feel very comfortable around this duo after they had just insulted Chloe. The compass mimicked his expression, glowing a dark pink in the direction of the Hare and the Hatter. \"You mean it is no problem to say hello,\" the Mad Hatter wondered aloud, \"or that you have come here at this time?\" \"Both, I guess,\" Richard said. \"Well then, why didn't you say so in the first place?\" asked the Hatter. \"You could say 'I breathe when I sleep' is the same thing as 'I sleep when I breathe',\" piped up the Dormouse, who startled Richard by talking so suddenly, and still while in his sleep. Chloe sniffed. \"Of course, it's the same thing with you,\" she noted. \"You're always sleeping.\" \"Ah! One thing you've said right!\" said the March Hare. \"Oh, joy.\" \"What day is it, little girl?\" the Hatter asked abruptly, taking out a little pocket watch, and shaking it like a handful of dice. \"It's the fourteenth of March,\" she answered. \"Oh!\" gasped the Hatter like he had seen a ghost. \"A fortnight wrong! Hare, I told you not to put butter in the works!\" \"Oh, but it was the best butter,\" said the Hare. \"Take a look at it,\" the Hatter said, tossing the watch to the March Hare, although he sat just a chair down. The Hare shook it near his ear too, and then dunked it in his tea cup, yanking the chain up and down until he finally pulled it back out. \"It was the best butter,\" he lamented, slamming it down onto the table with a slam! that made Richard and Chloe jump high in their seats. The Mad Hatter shook his head, but suddenly, his eyes widened when he looked past Richard. He surprised Richard and Chloe yet again when he reached his arm all the way around the chairs, and plucked the compass from beside Richard's chair. The compass struggled to get free, but before the Hatter could bring it to his seat, the chain glowed red hot, and the Hatter yelped, while the compass flew free. \"Now there's a clock that works!\" the Mad Hatter exclaimed, grinning as wide as the Cheshire Cat. The compass glowed dark pink, vibrating as if it were growling at the Mad Hatter. The March Hare grabbed the floating chain of the compass like a child would to a balloon, but he couldn't touch it very quickly, before the silver flared hot again. \"Extraordinary!\" exclaimed the March Hare. \"Here, let me have a try at that watch.\" He spoke as if he just hadn't touched the thing that almost singed his fur off. \"It doesn't like to be touched like that,\" Richard explained. \"My watch doesn't mind when I take it by its chain,\" said the Hatter, retrieving the broken pocket watch from the table. \"See? I don't see any complaints here.\" \"Well, I bet it's not alive,\" Chloe added, gesturing towards the pocket watch. \"I don't hear that one speaking words,\" the March Hare remarked. \"Or breathing.\" \"So?\" Richard said, frowning at the Hare. \"If I wasn't breathing, I couldn't sip my tea anymore, could I?\" said the Hare. \"Here, watch me.\" It took a deep breath, and didn't open its mouth for a long time. \"Why is a raven like a writing desk?\" said the Mad Hatter after a moment of silence. \"They both can have black quills,\" Chloe answered without a second guess. \"What?\" exclaimed the Hatter and the Hare, jumping up in their seats, and startling the Dormouse from its sleep so that it squeaked like a whistle. The Hatter let go of a teapot he had been pouring from, and it flew from his flying hand like a pebble. The light brown liquid splashed through the spout, splattering onto the face of the compass. The liquid sizzled on the silver surface, and the compass began to shake, vibrating like a house in an earthquake. The lid flapped open, and the marble face of the compass flapped up and down speedily. The needles on the clock beneath the compass spun madly, flashing between black and white, and then to several more colors, before the lid snapped closed, and clunked down on the table. The silver circle glowed no more. Richard couldn't look away from the compass. It looked just like it did in the real world, but a lot more tarnished. In fact, the silver surface was starting to turn a brown red with rust, expanding like a virus across the top. Like an overstuffed box, the lid came open, and the marble surface dripped wet with the tea. No one at the table spoke. \"What…did you say?\" the Mad Hatter finally spoke up. \"Look at this!\" Richard cried out, pointing at the dead compass. \"Just look at what you did!\" \"Calm down, Richard,\" Chloe said gently. \"I know what we can-\" \"Thanks to you, we're never going to get home!\" he shouted at the Hatter. \"Which is great! Just. Great!\" Richard shoved his chair out of the way, and grabbed the chain of the compass, not really thinking about the possibility of breaking it more. He stomped away into the trees, and kicked at the ground, slumping down against the trunk of one. He picked up the compass, and lifted it before his eyes. He noted the rusting silver, and the dripping marble. The clock hands, and the needle of the compass, drooped like a loose pennant from a hook. Useless. \"Now what?\" Richard asked, before he slumped his head into his knees and grumbled loudly. He was so lost in his misery at losing his magic guide to a couple of idiots, that he didn't hear Chloe push away her chair, and move towards his tree.[Chapter 4] Chapter 4 In frustration, Richard bumped his head against his knees. In a matter of seconds, he felt his stomach drooping, and his heart getting sick. He felt like he had fallen into a great big hole, and no one was around to help him escape. What could he do now that his only guide, and way out of this place, was broken? He forlornly lifted his face to the tea table down by the house. The Hatter and the Hare were laughing maniacally, and pouring tea into several more teacups, while the Dormouse snored between them. Chloe wasn't there anymore, but he felt sickened watching those three at the table. His face flushed with great dislike for them, as he looked between the table, and his poor compass. \"Hey, Rich,\" Chloe's gentle, motherly voice said. \"It's okay.\" \"How?\" Richard asked, looking up with despair at his friend. He gave the compass to Chloe, and she cradled it in her arms like a tender child. \"Without that compass, Chloe, we can't get home. Without some miracle, we're stuck here!\" Chloe sat down beside Richard, putting her arms around her knees, and giving Richard her warmest expression. \"Hey, it's not so bad,\" she said. \"I know what we can do.\" \"What?\" Richard grumbled, looking up from his lap. \"Yes, what can be done?\" a playful voice asked from above them. Richard and Chloe looked up, and noticed the Cheshire Cat, showing off his prize-winning grin as was usual. \"Not now, Cheshire Cat,\" Richard said. \"We've got a big problem on our hands.\" \"When there's a will, there's a way,\" the Cat said, pointing its paws in opposite directions. \"And I'm fairly certain you two have a will to fix this problem. Am I right?\" \"Well, yes, of course,\" Chloe answered. \"But we don't need your help, Cheshire Cat. We know what we have to do.\" Richard gave her a funny look, raising his shoulders anxiously. \"We do? Er, you do?\" \"Yes,\" Chloe said confidently. \"Well, no matter,\" said the Cat. \"How did you like the Hatter, and the Hare?\" \"I don't want to talk about that,\" Richard answered. \"I figured,\" murmured the Cat. \"You know? Perhaps you should have struck up a deal with Time, as those two jokers did for a time. That way, your watch might not have been broken.\" \"It's not just a watch,\" Richard clarified. \"And, I don't know what you mean.\" \"The Hatter and the Hare sang a dreadful song once, at a celebration of the Queen's,\" explained the Cat. \"And, it was so dreadful, so absolutely horrid, that the Queen belted out, 'He's murdering the time! Off with his head!'\" \"Yikes,\" Richard whispered. \"Right,\" agreed the Cat. \"And since then, it's always six o'clock down by that tea table. No matter what instances they ask of Time, it never listens to them.\" \"I guess it's what they deserve,\" Richard said, pointing to his compass. \"That Hatter spilled tea on this compass when they asked about that weird riddle.\" The Cat opened its mouth in a long, loud laugh. It rolled around in the air like a dog on a rug, and curled its tail. \"I'd know that riddle anywhere,\" it said. \"They always say it doesn't have an answer. I suppose you claimed otherwise, little girl.\" Chloe nodded. \"Yes,\" she agreed. \"That riddle's not supposed to have an answer, but I came up with that one on the spot.\" The Cat clapped its paws, still smiling. \"No one's answered that riddle for a long time,\" he remarked. \"Maybe you ought to tell riddles at the Queen's court. She would love the entertainment.\" Chloe shook her head. The Cat nodded, chuckling. \"Well, perhaps I'd best let you both go. I like to check in with the Hatter and the Hare, and see what laughs they'll make with the current moment.\" With its grin remaining for just seconds afterwards, the Cheshire Cat was gone. Richard half-smiled to himself. He was glad the Cat had sympathized with him and Chloe, but he still didn't like that they had no immediate way of fixing the compass. Unless… \"Chloe, what were you saying before?\" he asked. \"About knowing what we can do to get back home?\" \"Easy,\" she replied. She reached into her pocket, and pulled out a large golden pendant that hung from a very, very long chain. It was the same size and shape as the compass, so that it fit just inside her palm. There was a tiny window on the intricately designed front, through which a ticking clock could be seen. \"With this.\" Richard looked cocky-headed at the pendant in Chloe's hand. \"I don't follow you.\" \"You want to go home right now, don't you?\" Chloe asked. Richard nodded his head vigorously. \"Then, here, I'll show you.\" Chloe flung the pendant around her neck, and handed a bit of the chain to Richard. She pressed a button on the top of the pendant, and it popped open. And slowly, the hands of the clock started to whirl, until they could not be seen at all. Chloe peered through the window in the lid, and Richard mimicked her. Rather than lush gardens and sunlight through the window, Richard could see shelves of books and a few stragglers walking with books in their arms. Before Richard could react, he got a feeling in his stomach like someone had shoved him in the opposite direction. Chloe moved the same way, spinning in circles on her feet. The world of Wonderland didn't spin with them, it just blurred like they were looking at it through a foggy window. Abruptly, Richard and Chloe were pushed into each other, as if closed in by a tight space, by the world melting all around them. At last, the light went away, and slowly, the library came back into focus. When the magic was over, Richard and Chloe stumbled back to their feet, while Chloe pulled the chain of her pendant from Richard's hand. Richard bent over when he could stand properly again, and closed the copy of Alice in Wonderland . Then he stood back up, and faced Chloe. \"You didn't tell me you could go into books too,\" he said shortly. \"Sure,\" Chloe said. \"Here, why don't we sit down somewhere and I can tell you about this?\" \"Okay,\" Richard said, putting the book back on the shelf. For the next few moments, Richard and Chloe moved through the aisles, and then sat down in the secluded corner where Richard's book bag still lay. Most everyone had left the library by now, so they didn't have to worry about being overheard. When at last they were both seated, Chloe removed her pendant from her tight fist, and held it out for Richard to see. \"I got this pendant on my first birthday,\" she began. \"I didn't really know what it was all about until I was much older. Although, a lot of times, my grandpa told me that this pendant helped make me an extraordinary girl. That, maybe, there was some kind of exciting venture waiting for me when I would find out what it was.\" \"When did you first go into a book?\" Richard wanted to know. \"I was five years old,\" Chloe said. \"I mean, I was read to from books from the time I was born, but I didn't really want to go into a book until I could pick one up and read it by myself. I had a book of fairy tales in front of me, and I wanted to meet Prince Charming. I was playing around with the pendant, it popped open, and wham-bam, there I was!\" Richard's eyes widened, and he sat back in his chair. \"You must have been so excited!\" he exclaimed. \"Actually, Richard, I was pretty scared. I didn't know what had happened or where I was. But when I watched a handsome man come riding up on a white horse, I had the first idea that maybe I was dreaming. But, a few months later, when I was brave enough to want to go into another book, I started to figure things out.\" Chloe laughed a little. \"So, by the time I was nine years old, I had been through every book in my library. I made it a habit to go into every book I read, and I still do.\" \"Whoa,\" was all Richard could say. \"So…\" Chloe began again, \"I'm surprised, and I am not, to see that there is someone else who can go into books.\" \"Mr. Dewey gave the compass to me,\" Richard said. \"He never said why he did, just that I would have a lot more fun reading with it.\" Chloe grinned. \"Well, he wasn't lying to you.\" Richard couldn't bring himself to smile back. \"But, the compass is broken, and we don't know how to fix it.\" \"Then we'll just have to find out why,\" Chloe said. \"Sooner or later, you and I can ask my grandpa how, since he was the one who gave both our things to us. But, until then, at least we can still use my pendant.\" \"We?\" Richard asked. \"Yes, 'we',\" Chloe clarified. \"I'm no longer in this alone, because you know that I can go into books. Just like I do to you.\" Richard shrugged. \"I guess.\" He looked around, and leaned closer to Chloe. \"Okay. It'll be our secret.\" \"Our secret adventures,\" Chloe added, holding out her hand. Richard nodded his head, and shook Chloe's hand back.

Sylvia's handntrembled as she pushed a fork over the remains of her dinner. On thenoutside she was a calm young woman who wore her grandmother'sndiamonds and had her head slightly bowed, but on the inside she was annervous, screaming wreck. \"More wine, Miss?\" She jumped as thenblack-clad waiter stood over her, cradling the bottle of expensivenwine like an infant child. Sylvia shook her head and he noddednbefore backing off. Her grandma's earrings tapped against the sidenof her face for a moment before settling down and she stared at thenempty chair in front of her, wondering if her dinner companion wasntrying to perform some sort of mental torture on her—she shouldnhave known better than to attend a 'business dinner' with him. Seconds later he came striding back, tucking a Blackberry into thenpocket of his sleek black suit (undoubtedly Armani) and sliding intonhis chair with a panther's grace. Dr. Merrick gave her anslight smile and Sylvia's breath caught in her throat. The entireneight years she had spent in college for her Ph.D. in BiomedicalnEngineering flashed through her head. \"Dr. Watson, I'venconfirmed your position with the board, and the general consensus isnthat you would be the best candidate to head the cloning project. Congratulations.\" Her heart skipped anbeat and a slow smile broke out across her face before she could stopnherself. Thank God for Crest Whitestrips, Sylvia thought, asnDr. Merrick studied her features in the candlelight. \"Thank you sir,\"nshe replied calmly, \"You won't regret hiring me.\" In response she got angrave nod, and it was enough. She floated in thenclouds for the rest of the evening. Sylvia was hired , hired at the fastest-growing medical research center in the world, with Dr.nMerrick, the visionary that her teachers had drooled over atnCarnegie-Mellon. She couldn't believe that he'd picked her outnof all those men working with her. Surely , she hadnthought upon first meeting him, he would be sexist. But he wasn't. He had hired her! \"Mother,\" Sylviansaid breathlessly into the phone when she was curled up in hernfavorite chair later that night, \"He hired me. Dr. Merricknactually took me to dinner and gave me the job.\" \" Congratulations,nhoney! Is he single?\" \"Mother! I'm hisnemployee now. It's not like I have a chance with him anyway!\" \" Oh, do you want anchance?\" \"No! He's toonold,\" she grumbled, feeling guilty about bad-mouthing her boss,n\"And even though he's single it's not like he'd look at me asnanything other than the Head Lab Rat.\" \" Just teasing you,nSylvia. Don't go after your boss; he'll maintain hisnprofessional distance.\" \"I know,\" Sylvianreplied, biting her lip as she remembered the sensation of his handnat the small of her back when they were leaving the restaurant,n\"Someone will want to date him soon I'm sure…\" \" What?\" \"Nothing, Mom. I justnwanted to tell you that I got the job.\" \" Thanks forncalling, Sylvia. I'm proud of you.\" \"Me too,\" shensighed, hitting the end' button on her phone. Sylvia touched hernelegant blonde bun one last time before walking to her room to let itndown. One glance in the mirror revealed tired hazel eyes and skinnthat was paler than usual. It had been a long and exciting day, andnher body was starting to catch up. At the age of 25, Sylvia didn'tnexactly feel like a spring chicken anymore, though she certainlynwasn't as old as say…Dr. Merrick. He was 39. \"I should gonshopping,\" Sylvia muttered as she settled down to go to bed, \"Fornsuitable work clothes.\"[Chapter 2] Chapter Two ChapternTwo Twonyears later. \"Wenhave the Defense Department.\" \"That'snwonderful news,\" Sylvia said with relief, placing a hand over hernheart. Dr.nMerrick nodded and glanced to his right and left. Two of MerricknBiotech's new bodyguards stood at a discreet distance from the pairnseated in the Neiman Marcus Rotunda restaurant. Before the lunchnhe had assured her that they were mostly there to prevent hippies,nPETA members, and PAC (People Against Cloning) members from harassingnthem. \"Well,nsince we have them,\" she continued quickly, \"That means I'll benable to get that additional governmental grant for the\"— \"Thenleukemia research,\" Dr. Merrick finished for her, \"Fantastic.\" Sylviannodded and fiddled with the napkin in her lap, not wanting to meetnhis eyes. Recently he had disclosed to her that he had once hadna younger sister. She died of leukemia when she was 10 and henwas 15. It made him seem more human in her eyes, to know that henwas quietly devoted to the monstrosity that had taken a member of hisnfamily away. The fact that he cared made him seem less like anrobot and more like a living, breathing being. \"Innever got a chance to properly thank you for designing the logo, bynthe way.\" Sylvianfelt a blush spread across her face and he smiled slightly innamusement. \"Itnwas nothing, Dr. Merrick. Just something I drew, that's all.\" Thencurved, stylized \"M\" had come to Sylvia on a whim, and at firstnshe was embarrassed to show anyone. Nownit was emblazoned on everything from computer systems to theirnballpoint pens. \"That'snwhat I've always enjoyed about you, Sylvia—you're very modest.\" Goosebumpsnspread across her skin when he said her name, her first name,nand not the \"Dr. Watson\" or \"Watson\" that he used around thenoffice. Sylvia found herself enjoying his smooth British voicensaying her name so she quickly glanced behind him, out the windownoverlooking the street—and gasped. \"J-John,\"nshe stammered, \"The paparazzi…they're coming this way.\" \"Yountwo,\" Dr. Merrick snapped, motioning at the bodyguards, \"Handlenthis.\" Sylvianstared out of the window, mesmerized by the sight of black-clad mennand women swarming like ants across the street as they preparedncameras and microphones, frantically rushing to the doors of thenRotunda. \"Sylvia,\"nDr. Merrick barked, grabbing her hand and literally yanking the youngnscientist out of her chair. Theirnbodyguards had already rushed to the main entrance as the press triednto push their way into the restaurant. Dr. Merrick laced hisnfingers through hers and they walked at a brisk clip to the sidenentrance. \"We'rengoing to have to run to the limousine,\" he said, his glassesndarkening the instant the sun hit them, \"Are you ready?\" Sylvianfumbled with her own pair of Versace sunglasses and put them on justnin time for Dr. Merrick to open the large glass doors. Chaosnreigned on the concrete stairs. Scores of paparazzi werenpressing there way up them and their jumbled yells cut throughnSylvia's veins. The British doctor paused and wrapped his armnaround her waist, shielding Sylvia from the bodies crowding aroundnthem. \"Dr.nMerrick! Over here!\" \"Whatndo you think about PETA's accusations?\" \"Heyngorgeous, give us a smile! Dr. Merrick! Who's yourngirlfriend?\" \"What'snyour net worth? Are you going to declare soon?\" TonDr. Merrick's credit he didn't say anything. He just pushednthrough the crowd, using himself as a buffer as Sylvia clung to hisnside and tried to avoid looking into the flashing cameras. Evennif she had wanted tonrespond to the screaming photographers, she wouldn't have been ablento hear herself talk. The Biotech bodyguards moved quicklyntoward the crowd and soon the paparazzi parted in a wave, giving themnboth a clear shot to the limo. The driver rapidly opened thendoor for them and Dr. Merrick held Sylvia's hand until she had slidninto the black interior. She moved to the opposite side to givenhim room to slide in, but he didn't. \"J—Dr. Merrick !\" Slam. Henclosed the door and swiftly turned to face the media. Sylvianfumbled with the door for a moment before she stared at him andnrealized that he had lockednher in with the keychain he was holding behind his back. Dr. Merricknwas saying something tonthe press, who seemed to have gotten magically calmer, but shencouldn't figure out what it was, even by pressing her ear againstnthe glass. As soon as he turned around they started yellingnagain, the noise buffered until he opened the door and a wall ofnsound slapped her in the face. \"Damagencontrol,\" Dr. Merrick sighed as he sat down and adjusted his tie. \"Oh.\" Theynlimo pulled out into traffic and they soon left the paparazzi in thendust. Sylvia didn't know what to say so she took a deep breathnto calm herself down. She folded her hands together to keep themnfrom shaking. His hand on her shoulder made her look up. \"Arenyou aright?\" \"I'mnfine, Dr. Merrick,\" she responded quietly, looking into hisnintelligent blue eyes. \"Good.\" Shenfaced forward. There was nothing more to be said, so they lapsedninto a comfortable silence for the rest of the way back.[Chapter 3] Chapter Three ChapternThree \" Dr.nWatson?\" \"Yes?\"nSylvia responded to the ceiling's speakers as she juggled threenPetri dishes. \" Dr.nMerrick needs to speak with you in his office—it's urgent.\" \"I'llnbe there in a moment.\" Sylvianmotioned to her young lab assistant Melanie before taking off,nbuttoning an additional button of the lab coat she had left undonenbefore smoothing a hand over her high ponytail. Sylvia was nervous. She knew a thing or twonabout corporate politics. Only the strong survived—along withnthose who didn't make waves. Sylvia had created a veritablenhurricane, and it might have already cost Dr. Merrick hisnreputation. If he was thinking along the same lines, the youngndoctor was toast—and she knew it. Dr.nMerrick's secretary ushered Sylvia into his private officenimmediately. Her eye was immediately drawn to his still form asnhe sat with his hands clasped on top of the desk. \"Younwanted to see me, Dr. Merrick?\" Sylviansmoothed her hands nervously over her skirt and he nodded. \"Please,nsit down.\" Shendid so slowly and with great apprehension. He didn't looknhappy. Maybe he wanted to talk to her about the previous day'sndisastrous lunch. Maybe he was going to fire her overnit. Sylvia's pulse quickened. \"Firstnand foremost I would like to apologize for yesterday. Secondly,nI would like to prepare you for the aftermath.\" Henreached behind his desk and pulled out a large stack of tabloidsnprinted on thin, cheap paper. Fanning them out on his desk likena stack of cards revealed their ugly, bold headlines: \"Dr.nMerrick's torrid love affair\" and \"Billionaire Doctor goesnwife-shopping.\" One in particular caught Sylvia's eye andnshe picked it up. \"DoctornMerrick Dating French Model?\" Shenpicked up the trashy magazine between two fingers and looked at thenpicture. Sylvia internally cringed. The front cover showedna large photo of Dr. Merrick and herself, each of their faces grimnand obscured by sunglasses. Sylvia was apparently clinging tonhis suit jacket and his hand was resting protectively at her hip. \"Ridiculous,nisn't it? I've been getting calls from members of the boardnall day.\" Sylviannodded dumbly. \"Apparentlynthe press is convinced that you're a French supermodel and we'renhaving some sort of sordid love affair. How they coined that particularnstory, I'll never know.\" Annacidic taste rose up in Sylvia's mouth. She knew what wasncoming next: A polite smile, a stipend, and the \"I'm very sorry,nDoctor…\" spiel before his secretary showed her the door for good. \"Inunderstand, sir,\" she whispered sadly, \"When do you want me tonsign the Privacy Contract?\" Hengave her a blank stare. For several seconds an agonizing silencenreigned in the spacious room before Dr. Merrick blinked and pushednhis glasses up on his nose. \"Why exactly donyou think I would want you to do that?\" \"I—justnthought that it would be in the company's best interest\"— \"Ifnyou remained here ,\"nhe said firmly, \"And continued your research.\" Hernspirits lifted slightly and she nodded. \"I'llnhandle the press,\" Dr. Merrick continued, \"And I'll see to itnthat the rumors cease immediately. I don't want to put you innthe spotlight. It's a very tiring place to be.\" \"Indon't want to be in the public eye, sir. Especially for mynfamily's sake.\" \"Ofncourse. We don't want ThenEnquirer or PACsnoopingnaround rural Arkansas bothering your relatives, do we?\" \"Ofncourse not,\" she mumbled, looking down at the magazine that was nowntightly clenched in her hands. \"Verynwell. I'll take care of everything. Would you mindndisposing of these on your way out?\" \"No,\"nshe said, picking up the stack of magazines, \"I'll put them innthe recycler.\" \"Thanknyou, Dr. Watson. Have a good day.\" \"Yountoo Dr. Merrick.\" Shenbalanced the stack of magazines in her hands and strode out of hisnoffice, her chin held high. As soon as Sylvia reached a sleeknsilver recycling machine, she put all but one tabloid in the slot. \"Incan't believe I'm reading this garbage,\" Sylvia muttered later,nlocking herself in a storeroom. Shenhopped on a large box of unopened laboratory supplies and opened thentabloid claiming that she was a reclusive French model. Scanningnit revealed the standard crap that tabloids had always spewed, but apparently she and Dr. Merrick had been dating for months and trying to hidentheir relationship with a series of wigs and disguises. \" Don'tnwant your relatives in rural Arkansas…Arkansas…Arkansas…\" Therenwas a sneer in his voice when he said it, but Sylvia knew that Dr.nMerrick couldn't help himself—he was a product of the corporatensystem and Podunk, Arkansas was about as far off the consumer map asna person could get, even though her little city had turned out itsnfair share of white-collared professionals and powerful politicians. \"I'mna model now, apparently.\" Hernvoice echoed off of the steel walls. Though the press knewnnothing about her, they were picking apart every little detail of hernappearance and had managed to piece together a story about her beingna French model, though she had no French accent and didn't quitenthink she measured up to French style standards. Vanessa wasnjust a lab rat. She had always been content to be one, and whynshould that change now? It was her employer they were after, not her. Thenpaparazzi must have targeted her because she was the only female Dr.nMerrick went out in public with—all the other Heads of hisndepartment were men. \" Dr.nWatson?\" \"Yes?\"nShe asked up to the metal speaker in the ceiling. \" Dr.nMerrick wants to know if you want extra security around you on yournway home.\" \"Nonthanks,\" she replied, \"Tell him I'll be fine.\" \" Verynwell,\" thenfemale voice replied coolly, \"I'llninform him that you don't want any guards.\" Itnwas to be the worst decision of Vanessa's young life.

One such example is the 30th Anniversary of one of the funniest films of all time, the film that gives great helmet, and the greatest Star Wars Spoof of all time... SPACEBALLS ! While looking over the archives of this website, I was shocked to found out that there actually is a Spaceballs The FanFiction Archive! So after getting over the shock that, that is actually on this website, I knew right away that I had to write Spaceballs The FanFiction. But what would it be about? Everybody else has already attempted spoofs of the Prequel Trilogy, the Sequel Trilogy, Spaceballs 2: The Search For More Money , and Spaceballs III: The Search for Spaceballs II, so what could I do that was different and fun to read? I figured that since one of the great joys of being a Star Wars fan is the wide selection of merchandise available for collecting (it's a fun hobby that never gets old), I still await for actual collectibles based on Spaceballs , or any Mel Brooks film for that matter, to be made available (I still want my Spaceballs The Flamethrower and replica Schwartz rings!) and since these days we get all those collectibles that celebrate the films of the 1980s, I decided that what I needed to do was create an ideal catalog for the wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, WIDE , selection of merchandise that would ideally be available for Spaceballs , if Yogurt could actually get the merchandising rights available for us to buy all that stuff.

Or at least why I can't be blamed for thinkin' I was justified. Really, I might'a done the universe a favor. The galaxy's better off without that scum. Still, a sin's a sin. And I'm in the wrong. I worked for Pizza the Hutt my entire adult life. Heck, I even witnessed his boith. (He-hem, \"birth.\" Sorry, sometimes I type wit the accent. Bad habit.) My given name is VIN-Numero Chromeloni Fontainium. My family controlled the entire Ford Galaxy for over 12.569 generations. My pop, Hal-Capone Fontanium, ran the most bumpin' pizzeria in the universe. The whole family worked there. I been cooking up pizzas with my eye-lasers since I was two-feet tall and rust-free. We robots got the monopoly on the pizza-smuggling beeswax. (Fattening foods are strictly illegal in the Ford galaxy, where the Parliament wants its citizens should all look like buff movie stars, but all that's done is driven the pizza business underground. Good for us Fontaniums!) But the night Pop finally let me do it on my own, things went wrong, and everything changed. It was my baby cousin Chip's baptism, and we was supposed ta cater for the whole extended family. That's a lotta pizza to make. Well Pop was recovering from a shoot out with some Druish droid mobsters (faucet-nosed cheapskates, the lot of them!), and Ma was off visiting her parents on Jupiter 5, so that left me to make twenty-seven pizzas for the entire Fontanium family. My twelve-year-old self thought it'd be a great idea ta try baking them all in Mr. Oven (good model, same company that makes Mr. Coffee). And at the same time my pizzas was all meltin' together, a radiation wave hit the planet Chromos (where we lived), and it mixed badly with the marinara sauce. The bread rose, the cheese melted, and ka-boom, Pizza the Hutt was born. We welcomed that ungrateful prick into our family. My Pop took him in as his own son. I accepted him as my baby brother. We raised that pizza. And how'd he repay us? By taking over Pop's business. He started off just \"helping out,\" while Pop's health declined. He was insidious. When Pop was near the end—his memory circuits was breakin' down, didn't think as clearly—that pepperoni-covered bastard convinced him to leave the entire business to him, in his will. I was left in the cold. Oh, but it was okay, cuz Pizza was totally gonna share the power with his big brother, and he was gonna look out for me and Ma. I was gullible back then. I believed Pizza really did just want what was best for the restaurant, for our empire. His hunger for power happened gradually. Well I don't wanna go on forever. I'll skip over the next thirty years, and just sum up the result: Pizza the Hutt ruled the Ford Galaxy, and was the most powerful gang lord in the known universe, and he made it by screwing my family (sometimes literally; he liked to recycle old robot parts to build new henchmen). And it wasn't just us who suffered. Pizza treated all his subjects like crap. Plus, he kept gettin' us into trouble we couldn't afford—wars with other gangs, conspicuous crimes that had the cops on us like ugly on an ape, he even messed with the Spaceballs a few times. By the time Captain Lonestarr was embarking on his now-famous quest to save the Druish princess, we'd all agreed that Pizza had ta go. There was five of us in on the plot: Meter Goldstein (a gold Druish droid who handled our finances); Tiffany (Pizza's mol, a blue-skinned space-babe who he kept on a chain and forced to wear a gold biknini and loin cloth everywhere); Counselor Trite (Pizza's babe psychiatrist); Donnie (our best pizza delivery man, and double-agent), and of course, Yours Truly. I remember it like it was yesterday. Which could be because it was yesterday. Three in the afternoon to be precise. We were all there, in the pizzeria. Pizza was discussing business with Donnell O'Mega, our last ally on the planet Sham-Rock. O'Mega was really running outta patience with Pizza's unreasonable demands, and racial slurs. (Hey, I think the Sham-Rock aliens are a buncha' drunk, funny-accented gingers, but I got the good sense ta keep those thoughts to myself!) \"Keep your hat on,\" Pizza the Hutt laughed, as the green-skinned, red-haired alien scowled at him across the table. \"You'll still get fifteen percent of what you were getting before! It should be enough ta pay for your space whiskey.\" If looks could kill, O'Mega would've made pizza explode into a thousand pepperoni crumbs right there. Counselor Trite leaned in close to the boss, giving me and the boys a nice view of her cleavage. (Trite looks human, with big poofy brunette hair, but she's actually half Babezoid.) Quietly, she whispered, in that exotic accent of hers, \"Mister the Hutt, I'm sensing hostility!\" On the other side of Pizza, Tiffany rolled her eyes, and took a drag from her long nebula-cigarette, blowing out a cloud of orange smoke. She wasn't the only one who found the counselor annoying. Pizza himself could hardly stand her, and he made no efforts to hide it. \"Oh can it, Trite,\" Pizza spat. \"I hired you to be my shrink, but all you ever do is 'sense is hostility!' You're like a broken record. 'I senz hosteelity! I senz hosteelity!' Gimme a break.\" O'Mega finally growled, in that cute Irish accent of his, \"You should listen to your counselor, Pizza. You can't keep up your business without my shipments. If you're gonna screw me over, it's you who'll be left out in the cold.\" Pizza laughed. \"I think you'll like my fifteen percent better than the alternative!\" O'Mega's little assistant, Mickey, squeaked, \"What's the alternative?\" Pizza chucked to me, \"Tell 'em Vinnie!\" On the inside, I sighed. I was sick of saying this line. It was kind of funny the first twelve-hundred times I said it. By now, I was looking forward to never having to say it again. But on the outside I kept my cool, played the part of the eager henchmen. With my usual suave, I finished for my boss, \"Or else Pizza …is gonna send out…foooor you !\" The conversation ended exactly the same as every one he'd had with every other ally, enemy and underling in the last year. O'Mega told Pizza to bring it on, Pizza promised he would, and a declaration of war was all but made right there. All of us stayed perfectly in character. I acted like the cool right-hand robot. Tiffany giggled, and gave pizza a kiss on the anchovy. Counselor Trite swooned like Disney princess, and started rambling about how she sensed danger and death in the near future. Meter Goldstein complained about how much the wine cost, that O'Mega spilled on the table when he knocked his glass over on the way out. Pizza didn't suspect a thing. \"Well boys,\" Pizza sneered, \"I'm pooped! How about we celebrate. What do you say Monica sweetheart?\" he tugged the gold slave-chain around his concubine's heck. Irritably, the blue woman replied, \"My name's Tiffany.\" \"Monica, Tiffany, same difference. One's blonde, one's blue. Whatever! Let's go hit the arcade and play some pinball!\" Straitening his gold wrench-tie, Goldstein said in his soft, mechanical, New York accent, \"Pinball sounds swell.\" We all piled into Pizza's private stretched-limousine. Donnie drove. He was pretty worn out, poor guy. He'd just barely escaped Spaceball-1, where Pizza had placed him as a double-agent, to gain information to help us get around Spaceball authorities when we were doing business in their territory. Don had to go straight from escaping an exploding Mega-Maid (whatever the heck a \"Mega-Maid\" is) to picking us all up in Pizza's limo, and driving us halfway across the solar system to a Shakey's. For the record, there was a Shakey's right next to the pizzeria, but Pizza wanted to go to \"the good Shakey's.\" \"...I still can't believe it happened!\" Donnie said, his eyes on the stars and his hands clutching the wheel. \"We had fifteen minutes to self-destruct, and there was barely enough escape pods for half the crew. This might sound kinda weak, but I basically stole Dark Helmet's pod. He's all, 'Where do you think you're going?' and I was like, 'Pizza ta go!' and then I just kinda laughed while I took off. I also flicked him the bird, but I don't think he saw. But I tell ya, I've had twelve near-death experiences before, and this one tops them all! I'm gonna need years of therapy to get over this. You ain't looking for any new clients, are you Counselor?\" he turned around to glance at Counselor Trite's cleavage hopefully. \"By the way, did I mention how brave I was on that ship? It was fifteen seconds to self-destruct, and I—\" \"Vinnie,\" Pizza interrupted. \"Who are you even talking to? No one cares. Just drive!\" \"Donnie.\" Donnie said, his face falling. \" He's Vinnie.\" He thumbed behind him to me, and turned his attention back to the stars, just in time to swerve away from a loudly mooing cow floating through space. The rest of the ride unfolded mostly in awkward silence, except for the occasional lame joke from Pizza, which we all of course had to laugh at. Finally, after two hours, Pizza figured out that we weren't going to Shakey's. \"Hey, that's Jupiter 5! This isn't the way to Shakey's you idiot! What are you, drunk?\" \"My mind,\" Donnie said darkly, \"has never been more clear.\" He turned sharply, taking us towards a massive asteroid. A sign on the rock blinked, in crackling pink neon, \"Space Slug Parking: 5 Spacebucks.\" The asteroid was full of holes, and in every hole was a giant, sleeping space-slug. As the car neared one entrance, the slug's mouth opened, revealing jagged teeth the size of tollbooths. Actually, one tooth was a tollbooth. Donnie stopped the limo in front of the toll-tooth, and paid the five space-buck fee to the lady worker. Then he took us down the slug's gullet, deep, deep into the darkness. \"What the hell is this?\" Pizza demanded. \"What is this, some kinda' haunted house tour? Halloween was last year!\" Without sayin' a woid (sorry, accent-typing again), Donnie put the car into park. The rest of the parking ramp was empty. We were the only car in the entire slug. \"What's going on?!\" Pizza shouted. Donnie, Goldstein, Tiffany, Trite, and me all looked at each other. Goldstein's gold, robot eyes narrowed. \"You know Pizza, for the galaxy's greatest gangster, you're not very bright. You regularly bite the hand that feeds you. You start wars with your allies. You attract the attention of the cops.\" Counselor Trite then turned to Pizza, dropping her \"exotic counselor\" routine completely. In her genuine, New York accent, she said, \"You don't treat your friends very nicely, Pizza. After giving you a careful psychoanalysis for the last eleven years, I've concluded that you are a textbook narcissist.\" The shocked crime lord turned to Tiffany, then Donnie. Their expressions were hard and unmoving. Finally, he turned to me. \"Vinnie! Help me out here buddie.\" \"Help you out.\" I said flatly. \"Like you was gonna 'help out' my Pop? Like you 'helped out' my family by taking over our whole business? That pizzeria's mine! Mine and my mudder's. You stole it from us. And I'm gonna get it back, real soon.\" Pizza's face began to bubble with rage and fear. He tried his best to look intimidating, but one could see the olives and anchovies sweating down the sides of his face. \"I don't need this crap!\" Pizza spat, hitting me in the face with some wet cheese. \"I'm outta here.\" He tugged at the door, but it was locked. Heaving angrily, he demanded, \"Unlock this car Donnie! Right now!\" Calmly, I replied, \"You got no power here, Pizza.\" Goldstein added, \"You got no power anywhere , anymore.\" I finished, \"We're relieving you of your position.\" \"Relieving?\" Pizza demanded angrily, nervously. \"What the hell's that mean, 'relieving?'\" Slowly, I turned my silver head to Donnie, at the front of the car. \"Tell 'im, Donnie.\" Quietly, Donnie began to laugh. \"… Pizza ta go! \" I was the first to dive in, my chrome mouth wide opened. I couldn't resist; he was delicious. Trite was next, her innocent little eyes bulging manically, as she scooped into the living pizza mound like a zombie disemboweling a victim. Tiffany started off with a lustful kiss, but it quickly turned into a mouthful of pepperoni. Donnie dove right between the two front seats, his eyes wide and vengeful, eager to get back at the boss who'd abused him for so long, and eager to get his share of the olives before I ate them all. Goldstein was the only neat eater, taking time to tie on a lobster bib, and dig out a knife and fork. It wasn't a quick and easy death for Pizza. It was slow, messy, and cheesy. Mothers, cover your kids' eyes. No one under fifteen should watch this death scene, it's too graphic. Will probably give the kiddie's nightmares. It did me. After it was done, Trite dictated the fake suicide note, while Tiffany did the writing. (With Trite being Pizza's shrink, she obviously was the most qualified to fake his voice, and Tiffany knew her boyfriend's handwriting like the back of her blue hand.) We then snuck out of the car, and hitched a ride with some cross-dressers on their way home from a \"Rocky Horror\" midnight showing. The next morning, Pizza the Hutt's \"tragic death\" was all over subspace news. We planned it perfectly. All evidence led cops to believe the notorious gangster had got locked in his car, ran out of food, and resolved to eating himself. A note was found, where Pizza confessed that, in the even he should go too far and accidentally eat himself to death, he wanted to leave his entire pizza business to his beloved friend, business associate, and adopted brother, Vinnie. And there you have it, Robot-God. I've confessed. I'm sitting in the front pew of my robot church right now, looking up at the stained glass window of the Robot Trinity (Robot Jesus, Elvis Presley, and Mecha-Godzilla). How you judge me after I break down for good, I don't care. I've saved the Fontainium family, and I've brought peace to the galaxy's underworld. For that, my own artificial soul is a small price to pay. A/N: Yeah, this was full of really lame jokes. I was mostly trying to keep with the mood of \"Spaceballs.\" Though I also stole a few ideas from \"Futurama\" and \"Spacenuts.\" Apologies to people who want me to finish one of my *real* stories. It's been a hectic week, and it'll be a busy weekend, so I can't say for sure when I'll have another update. But I really hope to have \"The Silver Bird\" finished before the summer's over. ","Summary":" A/N: After being a \"Spaceballs\" fan for well over fifteen years, I just realized last night that "},{"Movie":"Island","Title":"The Mysteries of Dr Merrick's Institution","Author":"KlaraTook","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3053561","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Kylie stepped out ofnher car, opened the back door, and grabbed her silver briefcase. Shenwas here to do an evaluation for the Army on Dr. Merrick'snbusiness; after all, they provided a large amount of the institute'snfinances. The building was big and old, a bunker of sorts, she walkednup to the doors which opened and released a flow of cool air thatncaressed her pale face and caused her light blonde hair to blow backnoff her face. Her dark blue suit was tailored to sit perfectly alongnher body and around her curves. Her stylish heelsnmusical taps echoed through the large entrance hall. Kylie reachednthe secretaries desk, the inhabitant of which, smiled up at her andnmotioned for a seat to the left. \"Please take a seatnLieutenant Cave, the Doctor will be ready momentarily.\" Kylie smiled and satndown on the padded seat. She had not beennwaiting long when a tall well built man in his mid to late thirtiesndressed in a classy dress shirt and pants walked out of the high-technoffice. Kylie watched him, although she had met many great men ofnmedical science, but she was excited to meet the man who had solvednthe problems associated with cloning. Dr. Merrick. He turned his head tonher, and she saw a brief look of surprise cross his face as his eyesnsettled on her, after all, she was not the typical Army woman. Shenwas in her mid twenties, but looked to be younger. Her skin wasnporcelain white with no blemishes, and her light blonde hair satnbeautifully around her model worthy face. Her ice green eyes sparklednwith intelligence and curiosity. Dr. Merrick smiled and confined hisnsurprise and doubt into his head. The last member of the armynfinancial district that had come to him was old men, prone to takingnbribes. \"Lieutenant Cave, Inam Doctor Merrick, please come into my office, where is Henry, I wasnexpecting him.\" He said, his charming English accent rolled off hisntongue and caused a small knot to form in Kylie's stomach, sheninwardly scolded herself, she was a sucker for accents like his. \"Henry was forced tonretire last year due to bad health; I believe he is consideringnordering a cloned kidney and heart from you. I am a Doctor, the armyndecided to get a medical opinion on your institutes work.\" Shensmiled and Merrick felt a strange tug in his chest, he pushed itnaside, but then grabbed at it as a thought came to his mind. He maynnot be able to bribe her with money, but perhaps he could use hisncharm to convince her. He led her into hisnoffice and began explaining the 'edited' version of theninstitutes work, as he did he typed her name into his all accessncomputer system. He handed her somenfolders containing financial reports. On his computer screen,nwhich was his desk, the Lieutenants face appeared and so didninformation about her, ' Name- KylienMargaret Cave Age- Twenty-Six Degrees- PhD innSurgery, Medicine, etc. Armed Forces- Army Rank- Lieutenant Field work- 4 yearsnin Russia- injury subsided with transfer to deskwork. Current Job- MedicalnSurgeon responsible for work in America Relationship Status-nSingle- previously engaged- fiancé died in Russia in 2058 …' Merrick skimmed throughnthe rest of the information taking in anything significant. Kylienglanced up after finishing the financial reports, \"These seem to be innorder Dr. Merrick, would your secretary be able to photocopy them sonthe Army may take a closer look at the later?\" Merrick nodded, \"Of coursenLieutenant, of course.\" Kylie smiled, \"Very good DoctornMerrick, now I was wondering, I know that it is not part of ourncontract, but this is an extremely fascinating advance in medicinenthat you have here, would I be able to take a tour of yournfacilities? The cloning rooms and so forth. It is a childhoodnobsession of mine, being able to clone so that you can controlnwhether some one lives or dies.\" She knew that she was out of line,nbut she could not contain her curiosity, \"It was also annobsession of mine my dear, though I imagine my childhood was a decadenor so before your own. Follow me\", He smiled, she was likenhim, perhaps this would work to his advantage, he could show her thenrooms with the clones, and hopefully, she would be so intrigued thatnhe could organize her to pass the army financing sheets, and then hencould arrange for her to work for him in the laboratory. After allnher file specified that she had also been attempting to discover thensecret of cloning while she was in Russia. Clones after all wouldncreate a perfect army.[Chapter 2] Kylienwalked behind Dr. Merrick through the long white halls, her mindnracing, and her heart pounding with excitement the whole while. Asnthey came to a large metal door Kylies phone began to ring, shenpaused, distressed that she should be interrupted at such annimportant stage, she was about to see the clones. However, she had annobligation to the Army, so she smiled at Dr. Merrick apologetically, \"I'mnso sorry Dr. Merrick, this shouldn't take a moment.\" She answerednher phone, \"HellonGeneral McIntosh, it is Lieutenant Cave here, how may I help younsir?\" she waited for a reply from the gruff commander of hernsegment, \"Lieutenant,nI need you to return to head quarters immediately, as in you shouldnbe walking out of that institute right this very moment, we have anserious problem one that you are involved in. Is that understood?\"nKylie nodded, though she was disappointed that she should have tonleave such an opportunity abandoned, \"YesnSir, that is understood.\" The phone went dead. Kyliensighed and returned the phone into her small handbag, she then smilednand turned to Dr. Merrick, whose hand was still on the door handle, \"Dr.nMerrick, I am so sorry but there is a pressing matter back at headnquarters that I must address, so I shall take those copies back withnme and hopefully everything here is in order. Thank you for giving menthe chance to see the clones, unfortunately it is not to be, butnbefore I go I must congratulate you on solving such a delicate andnmuch thought over and discussed issue.\" Dr. Merrick smiled at her, \"Thatnis no problem Lieutenant, perhaps one day when you are not work youncan ring me and I can organize a lunch time tour of the complex, ornif you are unable to travel out to the institute, we can perhaps meetnfor lunch. I can talk you through our cloning process, you seem verynfascinated by the subject, and it would be a shame to waste suchnexpertise solely on army matters. Ahh but I am keeping you, here isnmy personal number, when you have a free lunch time coming up do ringnme and I shall make every possible effort to come and see you,\" henwas about to continue when his pager began to beep, \"Ahh,nit seems that time is really against us my dear, so I must run, mynsecretary has all of the paper work and she can show you out. Have annice day, it has been a pleasure meeting you.\" \"Yountoo sir.\" Kylie managed to say before Dr. Merrick had walked awaynand left Kylie to walk back towards his office alone. She sighed,nwhat could be so important tha the General himself would call herndirectly to her personal mobile whilst she was in the middle of anfinancial evaluation? She decided that she should hurry and quickenednher steps. Once shenwas in her car again she screeched out of the car park and sped alongnthe dusty road back towards the city. As shendrove she glanced at the card that Dr. Merrick had handed her, hisnpersonal number, she gave a small smile. He was a man that she hadnimmense respect for, after all he had solved the problems of cloning,nhe had discovered away to stop cancer patients from dying. He wasntaking the next step in medicine, and it was bringing him even closernto God than could have been imagined. She made sure that she wouldnnot forget to call him and organize a lunch and a tour of thenfacility, she would not pass up this opportunity to become friendsnwith a great man, a man like Dr. Merrick.[Chapter 3] Okay,njust a quick question to all those Island fans, does anyone know whatnDr. Merrick's first name is? It is getting rather frustrating himnnot having a first name, or if there is no known name, a list ofnpossible names that suit him would be great. Cheers. Dr.nMerrick smiled as he thought about his plan to do with Kylie, henneeded another doctor that could evaluate the clones and help himnshare his load, she could take care of the females, it was perfect.nHe walked into his office to see one of the clones sitting therentwitching as he looked around Merrick's spotless, high-tech office. \"Jones,nhow are you today?\" the man nodded and spoke, \"Very,nvery well Dr. Merrick sir, yes very well, I am so thankful that younwere able to, to, to save me from the contamination. So thankful.\"nDr. Merrick smiled and sat down, as he did he removed his glasses andnleant back into his chair, \"Wellnthen Jones… why did you organize this meeting with me? All yournlevels are in order, you are in perfect health, there must bensomething bothering you. You can tell me you know, I'm you'renfriend.\" The clone looked up and gave a twitchy, nervous smile, hennodded mumbling words over his plump wet lips. Merrick caught hisnlook of secrecy and leant forward across the desk, \"Isnthere something important that you must tell me Jones?\" Jonesnnodded, wringing a piece of paper in his hands, Merrick glanced at itnand held out his hand, \"What'snthis?\" he asked quietly as Jones, after looking around, handed thenpaper to him, \"It'sna list of winners and numbers, each letter of each name, well you seenif you assign each letter of each winner a numerical value pointnassign depending on…\" Jones sat back triumphant as Merrick lookednat the piece of paper, \"So younare saying that the winners of the lottery aren't chosen by randomnselection?\" Merrick asked slowly, looking up at the man surprised. \"YesnSir, and and look here.\" The man stuttered, snatching the paper outnof Merrick's hands. \"J-O-N-E-SnJones! I'm going to be the next lottery winner!\" he said with annexcited squeal, Merrick looked up at him surprised, \"Arenyou sure? But wait, you haven't thought of the women, I see none ofnthe females names on you list.\" Merrick said, prying the paper outnof his hands, \"No, nonI didn't, you see, the women, they are chosen purely to benbreeders. So they don't count\" Merrick nodded, \"So younmay not be the next winner, it could in fact be a female winner?\"nJones looked at him annoyed, \"Well,nyes but, no I'm sure it is going to be me, I'm sure of it.\"nMerrick nodded and handed the paper back to him, after photocopyingnit, \"I'llnkeep a copy of it, this is very interesting and I promise you I'llnget to the bottom of it.\" Jones nodded and smiled, he then stoodnand walked out, muttering to himself the whole while. Dr. Merricknstared astonished at the depth into which the clone had gone into hisntheory, it was wrong of course, merely coincidental, but the clonesnhad only been taught basic algebraic equations, this was far pastnwhat he expected a clone to be able to do. He typed in the clonesnname and scanned the files on his computer. Name-nJones3Echo Height-n170 Donor-nHarold Jones Occupationnof Donor- Head of a computer company. Personalitynof Donor- Twitches, excitable, introvert, no social skills, stutternwhen excited, intellectual, mathematical genius, etc.. Dr.nMerrick shut the page; they had not destroyed all of the clone'snmental capabilities obviously. Merrick would organize a brain scan tonensure that all was well. Kylienturned into the Army bases car park and hoped out of the car, withnbrisk steps she strode towards the Admiral's office, she took ofnher sunglasses as she entered the cool, clean front waiting office,nthe Admiral's secretary glanced up, \"LieutenantnCave, please go through, the Admiral has been waiting for you.\"nKylie nodded and knocked on the door to the Admiral's office, \"Comenin Lieutenant Cave.\" Came the Admiral's gruff voice, Kylie took andeep breath and walked inside. In thenAdmiral's office sat, on one side of the desk, the admiral, and onnthe other a strange man, dressed in a dark suit, sunglasses on thentable, she refrained from groaning, he was secret services. \"Mr.nGaundo this is Lieutenant Cave, please Lieutenant take a seat.\"nKylie nodded and shook hands with the man before sitting. \"Mr.nGaundo is from the secret services, MI6 in fact.\" Kylie looked upnin surprise, why would they be dealing with him if he were a Britishnagent? \"Henneeds to talk to you about the time you spent in Russia, I will leaventhe room now. Mr. Gaundo, Lieutenant.\" The Admiral gave Kylie anmeaningful look before he left, Kylie moved her chair so that she wasnfacing the agent, her hand resting on her gun, though the gunncouldn't be noticed. \"Do notnlook so nervous Miss Cave, I am not here to kill you.\" The agentnsaid in a smug British accent, Kylie looked at him, unimpressed. \"LieutenantnCave if you please sir.\" The agent laughed and stood up, he pourednhimself some port and held it out to Kylie as an offer, \"Nonthank you sir.\" She replied coldly, the agent laughed, then madenhimself comfortable in the Admiral's chair. \"Whatnis it you need to talk to me about sir? I'm sure that time isnagainst us.\" The agent's face changed to a serious one, \"CaptainnGreg Sewell did you or did you not know him?\" Kylie stared, thatnwas the name of her deceased fiancé.[Chapter 4] \"I knew him.\" Kylie said mechanically, a cold, hard lump formednin her chest, it had been so long. She had slowly accepted that henwas gone, it had been hard, but she had eventually been able toncontinue with her life the way he would have wanted her to. Mr.nGaundo watched her face with intense concentration, reading into eachntwitch of muscle, each lick of the lips, each ball of sweat thatndripped down her delicate nose. \"How well did you know him?\" he asked, Kylie stared straightnahead, not seeing the agent or the room, she was in her own world, \"Very well sir. He's dead now sir.\" She said her voice cold andnempty, devoid of emotion and feeling. She was merely a drone. \"Miss… I mean Lieutenant Cave, it is important that you stay withnme on this one; I need to ask you some questions regarding CaptainnSewell and his time in Russia. Are you able to talk to me aboutnthis?\" Gaundo's voice softened, he had noted the slight change innher breathing and the extra on sought of sweat that indicated thatnshe was upset by the conversation topic. Gaundo placed his handngently on her arm, Kylie snapped back to the room, away from the coldnRussian nights that she and Greg had spent together, sipping rum andnwatching the stars. She stared shortly at the hand, unsure of how tonreact, slowly she looked up at Gaundo, he gave an encouraging smile,nand she remembered the question, \"Yes, that's fine. Ask away, I'll tell you what I can sir.\"nGaundo smiled and sat back, \"Good, if you feel that it is getting too much please tell menLieutenant. Now, is it true that Captain Greg Sewell was your fiancénat the time of his death?\" Kylie nodded, Gaundo scribbled thatndown, \"How long had you been engaged for?\" \"Thirteen Months and sixteen days sir.\" \"Very good, and how long had you known Captain Sewell?\" \"Three and a half years, we met on leave one weekend in Moldova. Inna pub, it was mere coincidence that we were both soldiers.\" Gaundonnodded, \"What field of the army was the Captain in? What nationality wasnhe?\" Kylie looked at him, slightly annoyed, \"He was born in Manchester, he was part of the intelligence forcesnfor the British Army, but you already knew that.\" Gaundo gave annapologetic smile, \"Yes I did, but I had to check. I'm sorry about this nextnquestion but, when Sewell died, how long was it until your wedding?\"nKylie gave a small smile and looked vaguely out the window, \"Two weeks. It was all ready, the dress, the guests, the reception,nthe cars, the church, everything. We were heading towards the airportnon our way home. We both were lucky enough to be allowed three monthsnleave at the same time. We weren't even on duty when we werenattacked. We were in a civilian taxi.\" Kylie said, her voicenquavering occasionally. She looked up at Gaundo, slow realisationnsettling in, \"He wasn't in the army at all, he was a SecretnAgent, he was one of you guys and he was on a case. The attack wasn'tnrandom was it? It was designed to kill him. Who did it? Why has itntaken you so long to contact me?\" she demanded, although her voicenremained even. Gaundo shook his head, \"Greg was always talking about you Kylie. He never shut up. Rathernannoying for the rest of us. He couldn't wait to tell you the truthnabout his job, he trusted you completely. He would have married younsooner, however he was on an important mission that he couldn'tnafford to take time off from. We thought that he had it in the bag.nThat was until your taxi was attacked. I apologise for not contactingnyou earlier but some of the men, they thought that you might havenbeen in on it. I've watched your movements for the past three yearsnsince you have returned, you are not one of them. You are who you saynyou are.\" Kylie swallowed down tears. \"I was Greg's partner. Michael Gaundo. It's a pleasure to meetnyou,\" Kylie stared at the hand, unmoving, \"You were going to be his best man.\" She mumbled, letting hernstrong appearance down slightly. Michael nodded, \"I was. There is a reason that I've contacted you. I think thatnyou are in trouble. For some reason the people who killed Greg, theynthink that you know his secrets and they want to kill you as well. InnRussia Greg was looking into illegal cloning institutes, there werenpeople trying to create a clone army, or at least spare parts forntheir army. We were able to close them down because you see, theynwere breaking the humane code of conduct, the clones were alive, ablento think, breathe, act, and feel emotions, however they were thennslaughtered and used for spare parts on the Russian army. Now, theninstitute that was practicing all this was closed down, thanks tonGreg, we thought that it was all under control. You seem a little confused about why this is such a big deal. Okay,nwell you see the clones were being supplied for the Russian War Lord.nThe institutes were also convenient places to get rid of prisoners,nbecause they were medical institutes with all sorts of equipment,nperfect for experimental torture. The cloning clinic was the centernof all his sources of income, from torture, weapons, drugs, sparenparts; everything was linked back to the cloning center. We allnthought that Greg had nailed the big guns, but now we aren't sonsure. The Russians have a new battalion, it just appeared one daynafter a plane from America landed, our sources indicate that itncontained twelve highly trained bodyguards for the War Lord, onlynthey are all identical, and they seem, well primitive, they have nonemotions, nothing. They are robots. Perfect clones that have beenngenetically modified to be perfect bodyguards. We need to stop thisnKylie. That's not your problem though. I'm sorry, forget that, Gregnalways talked so highly of you, I feel like I already know you.\"nKylie nodded, unsure of how to react. After a small pause, Michaelnseemed to remember something else. \"Oh, sorry I got side-tracked. We would like you to retire from thenarmed services, we will front the bill and put you into witnessnprotection, Greg left a large amount of money to you when he passed,nI'm sorry we haven't given it to you yet.\" Kylie shook hernhead, \"You don't want me to work?\" Michael shook his head, \"No. We don't. We know about the child Kylie, we've beennstudying your movements for months now. How old is she?\" Kylienstood up and stared angrily, \"She is none of your concern.\" She hissed, \"Why? She's Greg's isn't she?\" he asked quietly, Kyliennodded, \"Yes, yes she is, but you keep her out of this.\" \"Why did you adopt her out Kylie? Did she remind you to much ofnGreg?\" Kylies hand stung across his cheek. \"I seem to have crossed the line, I apologise. Put it this way, ifnyou do as we want, you can become a sufficiently financiallynsustained house wife and look after your daughter.\" Kylie laughednbitterly, \"I've always had enough money to do that from the start, I don'tnwork for the money, I work because I enjoy working. I have nothingnelse to talk to you about Mr. Gaundo, am I allowed to leave?\"nGaundo stared annoyed, \"I suppose so. Obviously you aren't going to take any notice ofnwhat I've just told you so I see no use in trying to protect you, Intried, and that's good enough for me.\" However, he was talking tonan empty room. Kylie had already left. ","Summary":" Kylie stepped out ofnher car, opened the back door, and grabbed her silver briefcase.

Here is and inventory of what he saw: 'Long pause. Cricketsnchirping' Anyway… The evil badger hadnjust eaten Jukebox, and was grinning hungrily and Cheese-Crackers.nThe former Dead Guy (the group of people who ran around doing stupidnthings and nearly getting themselves killed) glanced up at the largencliff next to him and saw a group of Dink-Dinks watching eagerly. \"Hey,\" he called upnto them. \"I thought this thing would only eat Jukebox!\" \"Dink Dink Dink DinknDink Dinkdink,\" explained the Dink-Dinks, which roughly translatednto, \"But we feel like killing you too, and the rest of the world,nbecause you all talk too much. Losers!\" Several very bloodynminutes later, the badger grinned over Jukebox and Cheese-Crackers'nremains (nothing). If all you had to do was eat a couple of moronsnlike these, taking over the world was going to be fun. He justnwondered why nobody else had done it yet…[Chapter 2] So that's whynnobody had taken over the world yet, thought the vicious badger as hensat on the ground, moaning. If you're wondering how he wasnmoaning, just remember that he was a vicious, talking badger.nDink-Dinks give you indigestion. The vicious badgernstumbled into a bar. \"Hey, we don'tnserve drunks here,\" said the bartender. \"That's okay,\"nanswered the badger. \"I don't want a drunk, I want a drink.\" All of the people atnthe bar hooted with laughter. The bartender turned red. \"I mean, we don'tnget people who are already drunk even drunker.\" \"That's okay too,\"nrepeated the badger. \"I'm not drunk, I just have indigestion.\" \"What could you eatnthat makes you unable to walk straight?\" scoffed the bartender. \"Dink-Dinks,\"nexplained the badger. \"Their cloaks taste worse than Dead Guynrobes.\" Everyone swallowednhard, except a swallow, who scowled at the pun and left the bar inndisgust. One thought ran through the minds of the remaining drunks: if he ate a Dead Guy, he could eat us next . Apparently, thenbartender was thinking that too, because he didn't give the badgernany more trouble. One drunk slide up to the badger and held out somensticks. \"Hey, you wanna buynsome cinnamon sticks?\" he asked slyly. The man next to the badgernwaved his foot. \"You will give me allnyour cinnamon sticks,\" said the man \"I will give you allnmy cinnamon sticks,\" repeated the drunk. \"Thank you,\" saidnthe man, waving his foot again, as if by habit. \"Thank me,\"nanswered the drunk obediently. \"Hello,\" said thenbadger, interested in his mind-control techniques. If he had those,nhe wouldn't need to eat any more Dink-Dinks. He could have an army! \"Hello to you too,\"nanswered the man. \"I'm a viciousntalking badger,\" said the vicious talking badger. \"I can see that,\"nsaid the man. The badger paused for anmoment, waiting for a response. The man went back to his cinnamonnsticks. \"And who are you?\"nasked the badger pointedly. \"I am Dead Guy MasternWindow,\" said the man. \"Cool,\" said thenbadger. \"I ate a Dead Guy, you know.\" \"Yes, I heard,\"nsaid Window. \"Did you know which one?\" \"He was called Bobn(Cheese-Crackers) Hamcheese.\" \"Cool,\" saidnWindow. \"Did you know him?\"nasked the badger. \"Yeah,\" saidnWindow. \"He had it coming for a looooooooooooong time.\" \"Will you teach menhow to do that?\" asked the badger. \"Okay, first sayn'long'.\" \"Long,\" said thenbadger, unsure how this would help him control minds. \"Now sayn'oooooooooooo'.\" \"Oooooooooooo\" \"Now say the first tonletters in 'long', followed by 'oooooooooooo', then finishn'long'.\" \"Looooooooooooong.\" \"And now you did it.\" \"Did what?\" askednthe badger, completely confused. \"SaidnLooooooooooooong the way I did.\" \"How will that helpnme control minds?\" asked the badger. \"What does mindncontrol have to do with anything?\" \"I asked you to teachnme how to do it!\" \"When?\" \"Just now, I saidn'will you teach me how to do it,' and you said 'okay'\" \"That wasn't whennyou asked me to teach you mind control, that was when you asked me tonteach you to say 'looooooooooooong'.\" \"So you admit that Inasked you to teach me mind control!\" \"When did I do that?\" \"Just now! You saidn'that wasn't when you asked me to teach you mind control,'nwhich directly implies that I actually asked you teach me mindncontrol!\" \"It does not!\" \"Does too!\" \"Does not!\" \"Does too!\" \"Does not!\" \"Look, will you teachnme mind control or not?\" \"Only if you'llnadmit that I didn't imply that you asked me anything!\" \"You will teachnme mind control.\" \"Hey, I'm the onenwho can control minds, not you!\" \"You will teachnme mind control, or I'll wash down Cheese-Crackers Hamcheese…\" \"Bob!\" shoutednCheese-Crackers' ghost, appearing out of nowhere. \"Or I'll wash downnHamcheese with wash down Hamcheese with you ,\" growled thenbadger, completely ignoring the reincarnated Dead Guy. \"Okay then, lets go,\"nsaid Window. \"Go where?\" askednthe badger suspiciously. \"Go to the Dead Guy'snplace on Croissant.\" \"Hey, you can'tntake him there!\" exclaimed Cheese-Crackers. \"Why not?\" demandednWindow. \"That's for DeadnGuys only,\" insisted the ghost. \"Fine. Now he's mynapprentice.\" \"Fine. But that won'tnwork.\" \"Why not?\" \"He's too old.\" \"Watch who you'rencalling old, Grandpa,\" snarled the badger. \"No, too old to beginntraining,\" explained the ghost. \"It just means you're overnfour.\" \"But I'm not,\"nsaid the badger. Everyone stared. \"What? We robot badgers maturenquickly.\" \"You're a robot !\"nexclaimed Window. \"No I'm not,\"nlied the badger quickly. \"Yes you are,\" saidnHamcheese. \"See, Window? It really won't work out betweennthe two of you.\" \"Shut up, Cheese-Crackers ,\" retorted Window. \"It's Bob!\" thendead Dead Guy exclaimed, disappearing. \"That was weird,\"ncommented the badger. \"So, will you teach me to use mind controlnnow?\" he asked eagerly, getting back to more important matters. Window sighed. \"Onenthing at a time, Peanut Butter.\" \"Peanut Butter?\" \"It's what DeadnGuys call their apprentices.\" \"Oh. Okay.\" \"One…\" \"Why?\" \"What?\" \"Why do Dead Guysncall their apprentices Peanut Butters?\" \"No idea. It's annage old tradition.\" \"It's random.\" \"Are you finished?\" \"With what?\" \"Interrupting me. Wencan't begin your training until I finish my sentence.\" \"Fine. Be that way.\" \"Thank you. I think Inwill,\" said Window, and he continued. \"One thing at a time,nPeanut Butter. First we must go,\" he gestured dramatically at anwall \"to the Dead Guy Treehouse!\" \"In a wall?\" askednthe badger skeptically. \"Who's AWOL?\"ndemanded the drunk who sold cinnamon sticks, reappearing at Window'snelbow. \"Cheese-CrackersnHamcheese,\" said Window, smiling mischievously. \"It's BOB!\"nshouted Hamcheese, appearing again. \"Whoa, Holy #$!\"nexclaimed the drunk, looking shocked. \"Excuse me, but #$nis not holy,\" said an educated looking gentleman. \"But that man justnappeared out of nowhere!\" said the drunk. \"That still doesn'tnmake #$ holy,\" retorted the gentleman, sipping his drink. \"Hey, wanna buy somencinnamon sticks?\" asked the drunk slyly. \"No, you sold themnall to this Dead Guy here,\" said the gentleman. \"And I wouldn'tnanyway: cinnamon sticks are unhealthy for your health.\" \"Goodbye,\" saidnHamcheese, looking offended. \"What's that chapnon about?\" asked the gentleman, raising his eyebrows so hard hisnmonocle fell off. \"He's dead,\"nexplained Window. \"Well I know that,ndear lad, he is a Dead Guy after all.\" \"He's deader thannmost Dead Guys, alright?\" demanded the Dead Guy. \"Quite so, quite so.nWould you mind informing this man that if he does not cease andndesist to attempt to sell me cinnamon sticks, I shall have to informnthe authorities that he is illegally selling drugs?\" \"You wouldn't donthat!\" exclaimed another man. \"I didn't get enough cinnamonnsticks before that fellow took them all.\" \"Be quite, Anna,\"nsnapped Window, glaring at the man. \"Oh, you hush,\"nsaid Anna, \"I'm not a Peanut Butter anymore, Window, I can donwhatever I want.\" \"Indeed,\" said thengentleman, looking at Anna over his newly replaced monocle. \"Are we going ornnot?\" the badger asked Window out of the side of his mouth. \"Good idea,\" saidnWindow, as Anna opened his mouth for another retort. \"Who was that man?\"nasked the badger as they went outside. \"Oh, he was a DeadnGuy. Hamcheese's…\" \"Bob's!\" \"Go away. FriendnJukebox's father, Anna Skytripper.\" \"Oh. Will you teachnme mind control now?\" \"All in good time, mynyoung Peanut Butter.

This world acts as a bridge, connecting all stories that have ever been written, ever been published, ever been thought of. In this land the stories come to life, they have personalities, feelings, actions. The characters in these books interact with each other but also with a species that is only known to exist in this world. The books are able to communicate and socialize just as a human being does, they are able to express themselves and have emotions. When books are born they take upon them the genre and quality of there parents. Books that share a single genre and quality (hardback or paperback) are referred to as Clean Bounds. These books take up about three fourths of the population and are never looked down upon. They are the judges, the rulers, the teachers, the politicians, in a sense. A smaller subset of books, known as the Satires, take up the rest of the space, and that is exactly what most think they do. Satires are the lowest of the low, the dirt under the dirt. They are the slaves to the Clean Bounds, completing any task given to them without hesitation for if they even thought about a rebellion, that book would be recycled immediately. Satires are only kept around for the sake of having someone to kick. For many years, this world was ruled by one who is known only as The Pagemaster, one who is keeper and caretaker of the books. He watched over the books, making sure that no outside forces interfered with their way of life. He would clean and polish the books, making sure that stories and their characters would never overstep their bounds and intrude into the land of another story. Truly, all was well in the world of the books, that is until one boy came along. In the world of the books there are often visitors, boys and girls, men and women who are transported into the world to seek a companion book, one which they will read over and over without growing tired of it. One such moment, a boy named Blaine was brought into the world of the books. In his search for an exit (and little to his knowledge a partner) he stumbled upon a source not known by any books which granted him unlimited power over the element of fire. With this new found power, Blaine sought to take the throne from The Pagemaster, wishing to be able to shift and destroy stories at his command. Sadly, the victory was all too easy to achieve, and after razing the former ruler, he took his place upon his seat of power. With the books at his command he began to notice just how disgusting the entire prospect of having control over something with its own will was. Seeking the one who gave him the power over the flames, Blaine persuaded the person to allow him power over the other elements. Being The Pagemaster, it was impossible to be refused this request, however, the source only obliged to an extent because, as they said, \"That much power alone would collapse the body in on itself, but with the power of The Pagemaster already residing in your body, it may spell the end for our world.\" With this Blaine decided to create a new race of books. Taking the dead, withering, sick, and worn out books and infusing them partially with his power over fire and his newly received power over the shadows, he created a race of winged books that acted as his personal army. These \"Lectros\", as he called them, were more powerful than any book previously known to the world. Although they had no elemental power, as did their master, they were much tougher than ever thought of before, their spines connected with the dark powers. The Lectros captured and imprisoned all the Clean Bounds, locking them away in the dungeons of the Castle of the Pagemaster. The Clean Bounds were tortured, beaten, starved, and in some cases, killed in order for Blaine to prove that they were no longer under their own rule with a helpful guardian to watch over them, they were now his slaves and his alone. Deciding that they were of no threat, seeing as how their spirits had already been broken by their previous masters and the fact that he also considered them less of worth than the Clean Bounds, Blaine decided against imprisoning the Satires, figuring that it would be helpful to have them keep the land in shape while their wildest dreams of what would happen to their masters was being played out. Since the time Blaine became The Pagemaster, the world has summoned many others in an attempt to receive a new ruler. Although all of those chosen have tried with all of their might, mind, and zeal, they all have failed, even with the help of their companions. Blaine has ruled over the land for many years, now being a young adult. The world is crumbling away at his feet and it is in dire need of someone to come and rescue it and its inhabitants from their wretched king, and the time for this person to appear and relinquish Blaine's rule is fast approaching! Next Chapter: A Hero Is Chosen![Chapter 2] Chapter 1: A Hero IsnChosen! The light flooded intonthe room through the blinds, making every dust particle in its linenof fire glow like tiny fireflies rushing in and out of visibility.nThe small beams fell upon a dark brown floor which made the gunk onnit more prominent. Inside the various baskets and boxes were dirtynclothes that stank of 30 men's gym clothes, trash that had foodnremaining in it from meals long since forgotten, comic books that hadnin its ranks some that had been read so much the pages were worn outnwhile others had been opened only once, if even that, and old moviesnlike \"Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory\", \"A StreetcarnNamed Desire\", and \"The Wizard Of Oz\", all of which had a thicknlayer of dust resting upon the paper sleeves that held them. \"This room isndisgusting!\" came a shrill voice that rang out over the mountainsnof trash and rested upon the ears of a young man who had just awokennfrom his deep sleep. \"How can you live in this room? You wouldnnever be able to leave!\" Brushing his longnbrown hair to one side, Rhett Samuels said in an extremely monotonenvoice that showed his displeasure, \"Or Maybe it's just to keepnyou out.\" Rhett gave her a leave-now-or-forever-hold-your-piecenlook that made his sister cringe for half a second. Eyeing the floornfor a safe passage to the large hole that would mean escape from thisnhouse-keepers hell, she bolted out the door, forgetting to shut itnbehind her. Rhett slowly got outnof bed and rubbed his eyes. He had lived with this mess for so longnthat he no longer needed to watch where he was going in order tonleave his living area. There was a sharp contrast between his roomnand the rest of the house. While his room was so dark you couldndevelop photos in it, the rest of the house gleamed with cleanliness.nThe walls were a bright yellow with white base boards, photographsndotting the paint in clever little patterns. The hard wood floornextended throughout the entire house, being covered every once in anwhile by rugs or chairs. A large counter, which connected the livingnroom and the kitchen, held a huge plasma screen T.V. Sunlight shownnthrough the open windows and a cool breeze made Rhett shiver in hisnshorts and undershirt. The floor underneath him made a slightnsquishing sound as his bare feet slightly stuck to the floor, nondoubt from something he tracked in from his room. At the counter in thenkitchen his mother was just finishing cleaning up dishes from anbreakfast Rhett had no idea about, all the while his sister clingingnto his mother's side. \"Why didn't you call me in?\" Rhettnasked. He was a little angry that they hadn't even taken the timento let him know they were eating a warm breakfast. Now I have tonsuffer with cold cereal he thought as he pulled out some FrostednFlakes from the cupboard. \"We did call younsweetie,\" He hated her calling him that, \"but you wouldn't wakenup, your father even pulled off your sheets.\" His mother explained.nShe was the classic mother; short, curly, blonde hair, a yellow dressnto match the walls, a white apron that made her red lipstick andngreen earrings to gleam. He hated seeing her. \"No you didn't, Inwould have remembered.\" The milk poured out over his cereal,nslightly splashing on the freshly cleaned counter. \"Think what you willnsweetie.\" She said as she hurriedly wiped up the newly formed dotsnof white on the black marble surface. \"Your father and I have anrequest for you dear.\" Rhett sat down at thentable and shoved a spoonful of cereal into his mouth. The cold camenas a shock; it made his heart skip a beat and his temper to rise.nChewing slowly, he picked up another spoonful, waiting for it to stopndripping before he made any attempt of putting the round piece ofnsilver into his mouth. \"Yes, I will move out, thank you for askingnme to.\" He said in a mean tone that he knew would strike a chord innhis mother's heart, he knew how much she hated seeing her baby boyngrown up. \"No, you still havena year before that is an option,\" She quickly said, partially tonshrug it off and partially to get away from that topic, \"We neednyou to run to the Library and return Helen's books.\" Rhettnslumped his head towards the table in an obvious form of saying hendidn't want to. \"Can't she justngo?\" \"No, her bike needsnto be fixed. We discussed it and we will even let you take the car tonit.\" A Year ago he would have already been out the door. Henremembered the first time he drove the Miata, the wind flowed throughnhis hair, his friends laughed at some stupid joke they told, thenfreedom, the willingness to get away, the want to succeed… That was all in thenpast now though. \"Sorry, no dice.\" He said as he stood up fromnthe table and dumped his half-eaten cereal into the sink which hisnmother quickly washed. \"What if we let younget a book while you're there?\" Her voice had a sick desperationnin it. He could tell she needed him to do this, he knew that if henpushed just a little longer… \"Yippy.\" Slightlynraising his arms in a mock excitement, Rhett turned on the spot andnheaded for his room. \"How about wenun-ground you!\" She called out fast, afraid she was going to losenhim to the dark and abysmal pit in which he rested night after nightnwith no care for anyone but himself. Unable to see his mother due tonthe wall next to the T.V., Rhett gave a small smirk. \"Alright, you won menover!\" He yelled as he walked into his room, \"Give me a minute tonchange!\" Minutes later Rhett emerged from his upright sarcophagus,nhis chest covered with a semi- tight black t-shirt, very dark bluenpants and black sneakers with bright white laces. \"Ok, I'mnready.\" His mother hadnapparently been waiting at the door. She held two books in her armsnwhich she quickly passed into his arms. Rhett would have retaliatednif he had not seen the key that lay strewn across the top of thenstack in his arms. Without another word he walked out the front doorntowards the red Mazda Miata that was parked in the driveway of hisnhouse. I forgot how much Inlove to hear you purr he thought to himself as the car started upnand he drove off, away from the home which he hated. Maybe therenis something good on the radio came the thought as the boredomnquickly destroyed his love of driving. Twisting the dial to all ofnthe usual stations only to hear either an upbeat pop song or static,nhe turned off the device. Needing something tondo, Rhett looked frantically around the car for something to put intonthe CD player, but to no avail. Frustration was an understatement, asnwas hatred, oh how he despised being bored. He slammed his fist ontonthe passenger seat cushion which made his hand sting. He hadnforgotten about the books! Flipping over thenbooks he saw the titles, \"Alice In Wonderland\" and \"A HistorynOf Mythology\". Wow , that would put me to sleep faster thannwatching a chess game , lucky for him though he had just pulled upnto the library. Its outside walls were made with a stone that had anyellow tint to it. Huge stairs led up to two giant doors with giantnbrass doorknobs. This place is probably older than the town itself was all he could think as he entered the giant room which had a largenfront desk. At last he saw a metalnbin that had large white writing on it that read \"Books-In\". Theynclanged as Rhett dropped the books into the slot underneath thenwriting. \"So I guess I'll just trash all these books here on thisndesk since no one is around!\" He yelled in an attempt to get somenattention from the people who seemed non-existent in the empty room.nA frown formed on his face, \"Here I go! I'm gonna do it!\" Nonresponse. Picking up a book, henpulled out his lighter and lit it up, holding the flame directlynunderneath the old binding. With another inch the book would benablaze. \"Say goodbye 'The Adventures Of Huckleberry Finn'!\"nJust as he was about to burn the book, a flash of light came from anstaircase directly to his left. Without any further motivation henturned towards it, fists raised ready to fight whatever it was thatnwas approaching. \"Hello?\" Rhett'snvoice waivered a little bit, \"Is anyone there?\" A fear he did notnknow he had began to rise up to his throat. His body shook with fear,nbut noticing what he was doing, he summoned up his anger. \"Younbetter get up here before I kick your trash!\" No response came fromnthe stairs that were previously burning with a split-second ofnblinding light. Rhett made his wayntowards the staircase, fists still raised in case something jumped upnat him. I thought carpet didn't creak , he thought as he hitnthe last step and rounded the corner. A small hallway led to anothernturn, its walls lined with books. As he passed, he saw titles henrecognized like \"A Tale Of Two Cities\", \"To Kill A MockingnBird\", \"Harry Potter And The Sorcerer's Stone\", and \"ThenPelican Brief\". Rounding the corner hensaw it was a large kids' section. The walls were lined with papernthin books and in the center of the room were a large bookshelfnfilled with what appeared at a distance to be copies of all the othernkids' books. Out of nowhere he began to shake, almost as if winternhad suddenly appeared in only that little room. Fear accompanied thenfrictionless shivering. \"Who the heck is…\"nRhett's voice was lost in the bright flash and loud bang thatnsuddenly appeared behind the bookcase. Everything went blank for ansecond, nothing was real and nothing wasn't. All of his senses werenflooded with such feelings that he went numb the second the lightnflashed. As it faded Rhettnfound he was on the floor, his body was sweating profusely, and henhad apparently begun crying. Standing up, he wiped his eyes andnrealized that his eyes had just watered to the point it flowed downnhis cheeks and that he was not in fact crying. As the library camenback into focus he saw that it was just as he had left it, the kids'nsection lay untouched by anything natural or supernatural. Unsure of what to do,nRhett took a step into the room. As soon as the sole of his conversentouched the blue carpet a deep, low growl shook his body. It soundednlike how he had always pictured a Minotaur to sound, only morenfrightening. Curiosity trumped caution and he took another step intonthe bright room. Another growl echoed through the library and, atnlast, Rhett saw the culprit of the noise. Out from behind thenbookcase walked a creature that had the build of a bull, with hornsnthat curved down towards his mouth and feet that were in fact giantnclaws. Its whole body was colored in an assortment of reds, blues,nyellows, greens and purples. If he had seen a kid wearing thosencolors he would have instantly made a homosexual joke, but with thisnmonster he could not even force himself to whimper. Everything after thatnhappened in a flash. The monster ran at Rhett with speed that wasnsimilar to a Cheetah. No thoughts past through his mind, his bodynworked on its own, running away in the opposite direction. He roundednthe corner and turned slightly, seeing that the color was splashingnup onto the books in the hallway, giving them a more defined color. He ran as fast as hencould up the stairs. Even though he was skinny, he was not a runnernand as such, was already worn out. As Rhett reached the top of thenstairs he made an instant turn towards the large doors. At last,nsalvation , but as he yanked on the door to open it, it didn'tnbudge. \"No, no, no, no, no, no,\" Rhett said under his breath sonfast the words blended together as he frantically pulled at the door,nand as he turned around, he saw the giant beast leaping at him, itsnjaws aimed at his chest, \"NO!!!\" Next Chapter: SilencenThere Forever More[Chapter 3] Chapter 2: SilencenThere Forever More Darkness surroundednhim, wrapping its cold, deathless and lifeless arms almost lovinglynaround his struggling body. Rhett fought at hard as he could, kickingnand punching at the utter nothing that was all around him. Are myneyes even open? Rhett asked himself as he saw that no matter hownmany times he felt his eyes open, the same blinding darkness greetednhim. Just as Rhett was beginning to lose all hope of ever escaping, ansort of pressure pushed against his stomach. The pressure caused hisnlungs to expel all the air that had been stored in them, his heart tonskip a beat and his muscles to go limp. In one moment he wasnfighting for his life and in the next he was being pulled as ifnthrough a keyhole, his body folding in on itself just like a piece ofnpaper folded in half. Rhett, still being awake, felt excruciatingnpain, so much so that he blacked out for a little bit, this beingnquite a feet considering there was no light anywhere at all for himnto notice a dark darkness to black out into. A drop of rain fellnupon his hand, its liquidity bringing with it a shivering cold thatnheralded the beginnings of a fresh storm arising above him. As henopened his eyes, nothing made sense. A massive blur of contrastingncolors of red, orange, black and grey were all that could be seen.nRhett tried to move his head but it was as if it had been belted downnso he could only look towards his side. It was hard to breath on thencold, hard floor, especially after his recent experience. Slowly but surely thenpicture became clear. A dark, sloped hillside led out towards thendistant horizon, dead plants dotting its surface like acne on anyouth's face. At the horizon lay an almost wall of mountains whichnseemed to be spurting out lava into the sky, although after examiningnit further, he realized it was just he light of the setting sun.nRhett tried to stand, but his legs were just too weak to even supportnkneeling, so he settled with sitting Indian style. The ground underneathnhim was surprisingly hard, almost like it was made of wood or a hardnplastic. Looking at the surrounding ground, he realized he wasnsitting upon a giant book. His adrenaline pumping, Rhett's legsnbecame revitalized as he jumped up, unsure of this new scenery. Henturned to face where he had previously looked, and, to his greatnastonishment and similar horror, realized the landscape leading awaynwas also bunches of books, some small, some large, some stacked at annangle to create ledges and slopes. Rhett backed awaynslowly, almost as if thinking if he was careful he could turn aroundnand be in his room again, it was certainly dark enough to resemblenit. With each step he became more and more certain that this newnenvironment was an actual reality and not a figment of his creativenimagination, but kept denying it in order to pretend that he had notnlost his mind. Taking a step, he found the ledge, but was unable tonstep forward before falling off onto another book. The air knocked out ofnhim as he landed flat on his back. A jolt of pain hit him as he wasnreminded of the experience in that void of nothing. Giving up allnhope, Rhett stared blankly at the dark, grey, cloudy sky, wonderingnwhat he had done to deserve this cruel destiny the Fates had restednupon him. I've always been the one mistreated and now thisnhappens to me! What about them? Why don't they have to go throughnthis crap instead of sitting at home talking about how much betternthey are than me? Small footstepsnwere suddenly apparent to his lazy ears. The pitter-pattering ofnleather of wood was so obvious he was surprised he hadn't heard itnbefore, but he didn't care any more. As Rhett began imagining whatnlife could be like here, the walking stopped abruptly. Confused Rhettnturned his head up so it was facing behind him, and he saw a smallnbook, its brown leather binding having a red trim, its cover havingnon it a picture of a sword, the pages bent and missing edges werenobvious, its eyes gave a sharp stare of questioning and its arms andnlegs… \"HOLY COW! STAYnBACK!\" Rhett jumped up and held his fists out to this strangenbeing, not sure whether it would fight back or not. WHAT THE HELLnIS THAT THING!?! \"Easy my friend, I am simply here to offer you any help you maynneed. I saw that fall you just had, I can help with that.\" Itsnvoice sounded like it had been through tough times, but was obviouslynwell educated, almost like a college professor in a gang. \"First,nwhat are you?!\" Rhett yelled out as the book began to turn awaynfrom him. Rhett had so many questions but, for fear of his life,nwanted to know if this stranger was of any threat. \"Ah,nwhere are my manners? The name is Silence. I am the Satire whichnresides in Section 43-F. Now please follow me.\" It turned again,nleaving Rhett more puzzled than he was before. \"Wait!nWhat's a Satire? What are you talking about, Section? Hey, LISTENnTO M…\" Rhettncouldn't get another word out; Silence had turned and called out tonhim, \"If you wish to live through the night, I suggest you follownme. It's not safe for you humans to be out after dark, he will findnyou.\" And with that, Silence turned and began to walk away, hisnstride reminding him of an ancient knight, pride and honor streamingnout of each footstep like a popped water balloon. Whatnshould I do? If I follow he could like eat me or make me work ornsomething, but what if he's right? What if I'll die if I staynhere? Rhett's mind was all befuddled. He wasn't sure how tonproceed. Eh, I'll take my chances here , he thought as henbegan to sit down, but just as he did, the crash of thunder came fromnthe distance. That was the straw that broke the camels back, runningnoff towards this stranger known as Silence. Rhettnran across the hard ground, stumbling every few steps because of thenmismatched books. Eventually he saw a stack of books, a small doornway being made by a few small ones towards the bottom of the pile,nwith the flickering light of a candle shining through, penetratingnthe night. As he walked in, he saw a small wooden table against thenfar wall with a lamp on the wall above it. The walls all resemblednlibrary shelves, books lining the dark shadows. And there, on one ofnthe two chairs at the table, sat Silence. \"Ah,nmy dear boy! I'm so glad to have you here with us! I was worried henhad already gotten you!\" Silence stood up and shook Rhett's handnvigorously, making his shoulder hurt due to the fact that Silencenwent up only to his knees. \"Ok,nwho is this 'he' you keep talking about and what is a 'Satire'nand what…\" \"Pleasenson, sit down with me. I will explain everything to you.\" Withnthis, Rhett sat down, eyeing the beast which he just met. \"Now,ntell me my dear lad, what is your name?\" \"RhettnSamuels, what are you?\" Rhett said with an obvious annoyance in hisnvoice, almost as if he believed he could scam this person for money. \"Ah,nRhett Samuels. Figured it would be as much.\" Silence said, ignoringnRhett's question as he got up and began thumbing through one of thenbooks that was directly behind him. \"Whatndo you mean, 'figured as much'?\" Rhett was getting worried atnthe mysteries this monster was portraying in front of him. \"Wherenam I?\" \"Younmy dear boy are in the Land Of The Pages. It is a world connectingnall… you know what, if I explain it I will just ruin it, here.\"nHe said as he pulled open a book and put it in front of Rhett, \"Readnthis.\" Rhettnread the words presented toward him. He read of Blaine and hisnpowers, how he had enslaved the 'Clean Bounds', how their worldnwas in utter chaos. Rhett did not believe a word of this until hencame upon the prophecy of a boy coming and freeing the world. Thenlight turned on, all the pieces connected, and Rhett understood. \"Sonwhere are we?\" Rhett said, his smugness leaving instantly and wasnreplaced with a want to know, even though he was still just as angrynthat this had happened to him and he didn't believe it was real,nbut a fantastic story he made up. There's no way Incoincidentally came at this time. \"AsnI said, the Land Of The Pages. We reside in the land which connectsnall worlds. Come, let me show you.\" Silence looked attentively atnhis bookcase wall, took out a book, and walked out. Confused, Rhettnfollowed, not sure what new surprises he subconsciously made up. AsnRhett was just about to leave, he heard Silence, \"Stop! He willnknow you're here, just please wait a moment.\" With that, Silencenturned and opened the book. From its pages jumped a large expanse ofnforest with mushrooms as trees, giant caterpillars, and the face of ancat jumping in and out of view. It was all enclosed in a doorwaynwhich covered the one leading to the outside world. Rhettnwas shocked; he had no idea about what this was. Slowly, he reachednhis finger out to touch the image, and just before he could, it begannto ripple like disturbed water. He jumped back against the wall,ntruly terrified, that is until Silence walked out of the ripple andninto the house. \"Welcome to my Library, or shall I say, the onlynLibrary left in the land.\" Anquizzical look covered Rhett's face and before he could ask thenquestion, Silence went on, \"When Blaine took control, the Lectrosndestroyed most of the Libraries in the land. While it is possible tonwalk to the different worlds in books, it was far easier to open thenLibrary corresponding to that world and quite literally teleportnthere.\" \"Youncan't open a library.\" Rhett stuttered, attempting some form ofnargument in order to fight the pressing idea that all this was true. \"Wencall books that do not have any life Libraries. Now please, stepnthrough to the world ahead.\" Silence held his arms out towards thenstill image that looked more like a painting that anything else.nRhett slowly stepped forward, hand outstretched. Maybe just a pokento see if I can actually go through he thought as his body gotnever closer to the frightening light that glowed a bright green fromnthe grass. Asnhis finger touched the doorway, it seemed to stretch, grabbing thentip of his finger. Rhett panicked, but as he tried to pull his handnaway, the image climbed farther up his hand and arm. It had a hold ofnhim like it had hidden clamps, and before he knew it, Rhett was beingnpulled in closer to the world, just like a calf being roped by ancowboy. He breathed heavily, searching for oxygen just like he wasndrowning, and as all of his body went behind in the goo besides hisnhead, he thought of how he thought Silence had killed him. With onenfinal breath, Rhett went under, but instead of finding water or lacknof air, warm summer air greeted his skin as birds and bugs chirpingnin the distance met his ears. Rhettncrumpled to the ground, his body worn out from the immense amount ofnenergy he used in trying to escape, out walked Silence from thendoorway which shown the inside of the house, \"Welcome tonWonderland.\" Next Chapter: PlayingnWith The Queen Of Hearts[Chapter 4] Chapter 3: Playing With The Queen Of Hearts His fingers gripped the grass underneath him as if he were grabbing someone's hair; its green surface still slightly glistened with slowly evaporating dew. Rhett pushed himself off his stomach, taking in the scene around him. Based upon everything he had ever heard about it, Rhett was sure that this is what the Garden of Eden must have looked like… minus of course the giant mushrooms and caterpillars wearing glasses , he thought as he sat Indian style. \"Ah, Copernicus my good fellow,\" Silence walked quickly past Rhett towards the Caterpillar, hand outstretched in anticipation of the form of contact most commonly used in businesses. \"Silence my friend from days of old,\" the Caterpillar called out, his voice suddenly making apparent the wrinkles that littered a previously smooth skinned insect. \"What great and marvelous thing hast brought thou to this world in which I reside?\" \"Oh, just showing around this young…\" But Silence could not finish any more of his sentence. In a flash Rhett had stood up and kicked at an ant which screamed out like a dying horse and scurried away. \"You said Wonderland right? Like the Disney movie? Like the fat Queen of Hearts?\" At this question Copernicus' mouth dropped open and quickly looked all around as if there would be a sign that clearly read \"Spies Right Here\". \"Movie…\" Silence searched his mind for half a second before answering in a rather I-understand-but-at-the-same-time-don't manner. \"You may have the misconception of there being more than one story. Well, now would be as good a time as any.\" Silence sat down on a pebble which, at this size, resembled a large boulder. Rhett looked around but begrudgingly decided once again on the soft grass under his feet. \"Because many authors decided to plagiarize works and make new adaptations of previous stories, a system was created to weed out these books. While they still exist in there library form in this world, they are otherwise inaccessible because the original story is the only one that takes up actual space in the Land Of The Pages.\" Rhett was more confused at this explanation than he was before. He felt as a five year old would if they had just sat down on the day of the final exam of an Astronomy 2010 class. Cocking one eyebrow upwards so high that it felt like it was on top of his head and pushing his hands out in front of him, he replied, \"Meaning…\" \"Walking to this world we are in is indeed possible in the easiest way but a direct path of travel to you unimaginative and delusional 'Disney World' is an impossible feet to accomplish\" Copernicus cut in, clearly sickened by Rhett's lack of knowledge, but more so his lack of proper attire and pronunciation. The light bulb clicked on, and Rhett pictured an old map with a giant land labeled 'Wonderland'. \"Ok… So now what?\" \"Young lad, mine knowledge and understanding makes it apparent to me that thou needs to approach the Kings and Queens.\" Copernicus once again said, his vast years of experience ringing out like church bells. \"But, there's only one Queen, isn't there?\" Rhett was once again befuddled with this new information. \"Ugh, we will talk on the way,\" Silence quickly said as he buried his head in his hand, then turned to the Caterpillar, \"If I may ask you where we may find their royal highnesses?\" No sooner had he spoken these words than the giant insect had pointed in a direction directly to Rhett's left. With one final handshake the two were off. As Rhett followed Silence a bit far off, he heard one last statement from his guide's old comrade. \"The lands which thou will face are both treacherous and deteriorating, make it known to few what a great mission you wish to accomplish and you will find success!\" \"What is that supposed to mean?\" Rhett asked, once again as confused as someone who was just asked to program a super computer but who majored in cooking. \"Exactly what was said, now hustle up boy, our journey will be quick and we have a great need to get your facts straight!\" Rhett had fallen further behind than he had previously thought, the walking book looked very small, and so he was forced to run fast towards the moving anthology. \"Now, what was your question?\" \"Why…did he… say… 'Kings and… Queens?\" Rhett said as fast as he could, but his lack of exercise made him very short breathed. \"Ah yes, you are stuck to your Disney views on things. Well do you recall how she had card soldiers?\" Silence said in a sudden realization of the problems presented. \"Yes I… do.\" Rhett was still trying to calm down, his breath seemed to get further and further away the more he tried to catch it. \"Well it is ludicrous to think that one Queen should have control of all thirty-eight cards, so thusly there are four Kings and four Queens to govern them. While it is true that the Queen of Hearts is more ruthless than the other royal members, she does not have control of the entire Card Army.\" Silence said this as if he had been reading it off of a card, all the while Rhett's mind was opened to this new information, fully accepting it because it's just another version of a story and I'm sure that they're cutting out the tumor in the real world as I speak , or so Rhett thought. Almost as if it were some form of magic, a small garden emerged from behind the tree line, its freshly mowed grass being surrounded by a large shrub wall. Towards the opposite end of the large expanse were eight thrones, each of which seated eight human figures, their clothing having the same color a design as the suit of card which they ruled over. As Rhett and Silence stepped through into the area they saw an army of Card soldiers lining the sides, making a direct path the rulers. Rhett and Silence walked forward with slow, deliberate steps, everything had quieted down, and even the birds which previously seemed so powerful in their volume now had died down as if all had been captured by hunters. The air seemed almost to have visible the tension which rested upon Rhett. Silence acted as if there was no difference to his previous engagement with his friend. As the two approached the Kings and Queens, the King of Spades said in a tone that marked him as obvious royalty, \"Who approaches the Rulers of Cards?\" Silence knelt down as far as he could, (which to Rhett didn't seem to make much of a difference) and pulled Rhett down with him. Bowing his head, Silence declared, \"Great nobility, I am Silence, a Satire residing in Section 43-F in the Land Of The Pages and this is my partner Rhett Samuels, a human.\" At this last word the royalty all gasped, and Rhett felt sixteen sets of eyes fall dead upon him. \"Rhett Samuels, we have not had a human visitor in some time. We are more than welcome to have you with us. What, may I ask, brings you to our humble abode?\" Another voice came which was a women's, Rhett being unable to see who because of his bowed head. \"We seek advice on how best to proceed with our quest.\" Silence proclaimed proudly. \"Stand our guests and enjoy a conversation with us as equals.\" At this the two adventurers stood up, Rhett seeing that not only were the Kings and Queens staring, but also all of the Card soldiers. \"If I may my dear brother,\" The King of Hearts addressed the former speaker, the King of Clubs, \"I would suggest that they visit the world of Treasure Island. A pirate's life would be good preparation for his future pursuits.\" \"I must say,\" The Queen of Spades inquired, \"that the world of the Greek God's would do great wonders for him and his…troubles\" Rhett was slightly offended at this. \"Hey! What do you mean trou…\" \"I must say that by visiting with the Three Musketeers he could…\" The King of Hearts piped up before being cut off. \"Moby Di…\" \"Hansel and Grete…\" \"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under Th…\" \"Enough!\" A slithery sounding voice filled the air and cut off all vocalizations in their entirety. Out from behind the shrub wall behind the thrones flew high a crimson color book with eyes and a mouth on the spine facing forward just like Silence, however its eyes were pure black and its mouth had two large fangs hanging down from its top jaw. Its hands and feet were comprised of menacing claws which looked as if they were able to tear flesh from muscle and a pair of withered looking wings on its sides gave it the ability to fly. \"No one shall assist this human. We will take him to The Master. The Master will know what to do with him.\" The voice pierced Rhett's ears and in an unannounced question he looked at Silence, asking if it was in fact a Lectro. To his great horror Silence nodded and Rhett looked up at the monster that was just landing, a fear filling him he hadn't felt since the rainbow creature attacked him. Rhett unconsciously slunk behind the book, his height not being of much good to him here. \"We cannot allow you to take this boy. He is of too great importance to us to be simply…\" The King of Spades spoke clearly; an obvious tremble was almost well enough hidden behind his masculine voice. \"Oh shut up and let them take him! He'll be killed anyway before long! Just save us the trouble of being scourged for this one!\" The Queen of Hearts yelled aloud. The royalty began fighting once again and as they did, the Lectro walked like a serpent towards the Queen of Hearts. The sound of metal being unsheathed came to Rhett's ears and he realized Silence had opened himself, taken out a sword, and had looped it around himself. \"Watch yourself.\" He whispered, and as he did the Lectro leapt at the Queen, stabbing its hand into the chest of the woman. With a gasp she bent over in her throne, but instead of blood showing from the wound, a dark hole swirled and then closed up. As the Queen sat back up her eyes were black, a definite smoke slightly fell from them. After this had happened, the Lectro held its hand out towards the Card soldiers, a black mist ejecting out over the masses. \"All of you capture the human! Kill the Satire!\" At this the soldiers pounced forward along with the Queen. Rhett was sure he was dead, but when he looked up from his feeble position he saw all of the Royalty fighting back their previous servants with staffs emblazoned with the symbol of their house. As a card would attack, they would easily block the attempt and use the momentum to spin the staff and attack back. Silence jumped in the air on top of the cards, parrying jabs at him with his small weapon. Rhett was so fixated on these scenes he was almost stabbed in the face by a three of clubs who had somehow broken through. Rhett ducked down and punched the card in the stomach, then punched it across the face. Falling to the ground like a napkin being dropped, Rhett picked up its spear and looked around. A lone card approached the Queen of Diamonds from behind and Rhett acted on instinct. Running with spear held like a sword, he swung in a large arc towards the enemy, who heard the attack and blocked the spear with its own mace made of diamonds. Rhett felt awkward holding the weapon and it showed as he tried once again to swing it as a sword, but when it was blocked the card knocked the weapon from his hands. The force knocked him to the ground and, as he saw the card raise its weapon to give a blow that would, in the best circumstances knock him out but could very well kill him, Rhett realized something. \"HOLY CRAP THIS IS REAL!!!\" He screamed as loud as he could and in desperation kicked the card in the shins. Seeming unaffected, the card proceeded on, forcing Rhett to quickly crawl like a crab backwards until he was against the wall. The mace hit right next to his foot as he was trapped against this barrier. As the card raised its mace one last time Rhett screamed out, \"SILENCE!\" Almost as if by divine intervention the card was cut diagonally, its eyes rolling to the back of its head, and as the two pieces slowly floated down to the ground, Silence stood behind it, holding the pose which he had when he sliced the card half a second before. \"We really need to teach you how to fight, I mean NEED to.\" \"Hahaha, very freaking funny.\" Rhett said, attempting to remain in the image of 'cool kid'. \"How do we get out of this mess?\" \"If we can kill that Lectro,\" Silence pointed with his sword towards the Lectro which was flying in and out of the fray, every once and a while having a small gash which was quickly healed, \"Then all the rest of them will go back to normal. I'm trying not to kill any and I suggest you do the same. We want this army ready when they're back to normal.\" Rhett was a little stunned at the prospect that he would have to kill something. Fantasizing about killing a teacher to get out of a test is one thing, killing an actual being though… A smooth metal filled the gaping hole in his right hand and Rhett saw the spear he previously had, the spear head in the symbol of the clubs symbol. \"Go my boy,\" Silence said in a tired manner as he turned and blocked a sword with the handle in the shape of a heart, \"We need you!\" Rhett ran through the crowd, hoping against hope that he would be able to remain unseen if he moved fast enough. As he moved through the group, he tightened his grip on his weapon, realizing that it was kill or be killed. He stopped, looking up he saw the Lectro swooping out of the battle. This is my chance; if I can get my aim right then this will all be over. He thought as he mounted the spear, ready to throw it. Holding his breath, Rhett let fly the long rod and as it flew, the trajectory of his target made it apparent that he had succeeded. As the spear pierced the Lectro clean through, it gasped, then fell to the ground. Just before it would have hit the head of some cards it disintegrated into a cloud of crimson particles, and in that same moment, all fighting ended in an eerie way. Confused and embarrassed, the cards helped up there fallen comrades and seated their leaders atop their thrones, including the Queen of Hearts who had received a rather large smack across the face from a staff which had the symbol of a Diamond. \"My boy you did it!\" Silence said excitedly as he approached the still stunned human who remained staring at the spot where his victory vanished away. \"What is wrong?\" \"The Letcro…\" \"Ah ah ah, Lectro.\" Silence interrupted to correct the mispronunciation. Obliging, Rhett continued, \"It vanished into thin air!\" \"Yes, they are already dead; the only thing holding their bodies together is their life force. Once that leaves… well, you saw.\" A silence came between the two of them, partly from respect for the fallen and partly to contemplate their next move. Noticing that it had gone on for much too long, Silence came in, \"Come, I know exactly where we need to go now.\" He turned towards the entrance they had come through but Rhett remained standing, now looking at the ground and hands at his side as a Marine does while at attention. The mass chaos around him resembled his own minds lack of order as thoughts such as How could I have killed, Will I be killed, and What if I never escape dominated his attention. Walking back to the troubled youth, Silence took Rhett's hand and looked up at him, \"Come son, let's get you trained for anything.\" At this the two of them walked away from the devastation they left and, as if he had read Rhett's mind, said, \"Don't worry, all things eventually get better.\" Next Chapter: All For One, None For All[Chapter 5] Chapter 4: All For One, None For All Walking through the doorway was just as challenging as it had been the first time. Rhett's body ached from the amount of force he had used attempting this time to push his body through faster. The weird goo from the portal to Wonderland made it seem like he was pushing his way through wet wood, the pull he had experienced from his first encounter with the strange matter seeming to be nonexistent, begging the question of whether it had all been in his head or not. Silence walked through the picture just as coolly as before, this time his hands were behind his back. Rhett sat up Indian style and stared down at his hands. The icy wind that blew through the shack seemed to penetrate every corner of the solid looking shelter, but Rhett was in such a deep amount of thought that, while pains that would be like his skin crawling off and his eyes turning to ice cubes should have been existent, the only thing Rhett felt was a deep emptiness that haunted his mind. \"Cheer up boy.\" Silence came over and lifted Rhett's chin up, but its kindness was only met with a swift rebuttal that caused its hand to swing downward as the boy's head faced even lower this time. The dirt floor made the mood of the cabin even drearier as Rhett's thoughts switched from self-turmoil to self-loathing. \"Not to be unkind but we need to get you trained.\" Almost careful of booby traps, Silence walked towards his Bookshelves and began rummaging, its mind obviously set on a single idea for a Library that would somehow improve Rhett's dark existence. In a fit of excitement as a successful search, Silence pulled out a slim book, its leather having been worn down from decades of use, or decades of compacted dust, Rhett wasn't sure which. Silence walked over towards the small book lying open on the floor, and shut it lovingly. As it did, the image on the door faded away until the dark landscape that resided behind it shown, the light the pathway held fading along with it until the single candle on the far table was the only light in the room. Opening the new book Silence possessed, Rhett gazed in wonder as a stream of indiscernible color shot towards the wall gap, the force of which caused the walking book to stumble backwards a bit. On the doorway Rhett stared as an old cobblestone pathway was shown with stores on either side, at the end of the block a small sign hung out which read \"Treville's Hotel\". People in old style clothing were standing completely still in the image, one lady in particular frozen right as a pile of rolls fell from her arms. He couldn't help but smile as the stream stopped and the loud sound of rushing wind ceased. \"Shall we proceed to the French country side my lad?\" Silence asked, satisfied with the look of awe on his new friends face. As the two walked through the image, Rhett let his body relax. Maybe if I don't fight it then it will… Just as easy as walking through a blow drier Rhett witnessed as the paths of the people became apparent. The woman collapsed to the ground in a feeble attempt to grab her rolls before they hit the hard footing which she had previously hopelessly relied on for footing. The whole world was a buzz with life and happiness. Turning to Silence as the two walked down the road towards the hotel, Rhett silently said \"Thank you for this.\" \"Twas my pleasure my owner\" Silence replied with a slightly prideful tone. Rhett was thrown off his guard. \"What do you mean your owner?\" He asked suspiciously and this time louder. \"Well… I mean… well you read the history of… I am positive that…\" \"That what? That I'm going to be your partner? Let me get this straight, I will NOT get a partner. The only reason I'm doing this is so that I can get back home. Besides that, I don't even like books.\" Rhett said with an angry tone, saying exactly what he wanted to in order to cause the most amount of pain. \"…At least you know this is real!\" Silence said in an attempt to find the silver-lining, \"And I promise that by the end of this journey you will find joy in reading and we will be partners\" The confidence in the second part made Rhett quiver with fright. How is it possible he could know that? Was his only thought before the large wooden door was slowly opened to reveal the inner workings of the lobby of a hotel. A large desk ran along the left wall, the lone boy standing behind it shocked at the sight he took in, not of a teenage boy but of the rather large walking book accompanying the lad. For the most part the room was empty. Faded velvet couches rested underneath large glass windows whilst the wooden floor under their feet creaked of old age with every wary step taken upon them. At one of the four small tables sat three men, long brimmed hats covering dark complexions resting upon fabric of blue and gold, signifying some form of elite operation. Rhett seemed glued to the floor for some reason as Silence approached the three figures without hesitation. He's gonna get himself killed! Look at those three monsters and look at him! They're gonna stab him straight through! Silence walked over to one of them and slapped him on the back, the obvious shock was seen both by the shock on the other two's faces and the fact that the one that was slapped jumped up in surprise and drew out his sword. The air was as stale as old bread. No one dared to say anything for what seemed like an eternity. Silence, who had also drawn his sword, glared at this new threat, neither one willing to give the other ground for fear that would be the last thing they ever did. The other two men stood and stared at Rhett, who felt uncomfortable with how the entire situation felt. A slight twitch in the arm caused Silences sword to waver slightly, and at that the silence was broken by a low yet reserved voice. \"That would have cost you your life my friend.\" The man said as a smirk filled his face. \"Aramis, you always were one to point out my faults.\" Silence replied with a similar facial expression as he simultaneously sheathed his weapon with his once thought of enemy. \"Come Silence, grab some wine and tell us who your friend is\" Came one of the other men, his voice much more exuberant and almost humorous. \"Actually Porthos, we are in a rush and in need of help.\" Silence said quickly, raising one hand to stop a maid-servant that had begun approaching the table, then motioned for Rhett to stand with them. \"Friends, as I have confided in you, the Land of the Books is being destroyed. This, my friends, is the boy from the prophecy.\" In that instant, all eyes fell upon Rhett. The hairs on the back of his neck stood up so straight he thought that his already long hair had grown another inch or two. \"Well greetings,\" The last man said, a hand was outstretched which swayed from side to side, an obvious sign that the man had drunken a few too many. This brought out the masculinity of his voice, his broad shoulders showing him as the somewhat \"leader\", \"Athos, at your service. If you two are in need of anything, we will be willing to help, no matter the calling.\" Rhett took his hand and thought he would lose his, the man's grip so strong it was as if two cinderblocks had been dropped on either side of his palms. \"Thank you brother.\" Silence put his hands on Athos', seeing the pain Rhett was experiencing. The hand almost instantly shot backwards at the realization of what was going on. \"The problem I wish to present to you gentlemen is one that concerns the entire world of literature. While this boy is the one foretold of, he will have no chance of freeing us from enslavement if he is not able to defend himself.\" At that comment, the three men gathered there things, Athos taking one last swig from his already almost empty drink. \"If it's training you want then it's training you'll get my lad.\" Porthos spoke directly to Rhett, who made him feel slightly more comfortable. \"But come, we must keep quiet. The loft is a few blocks down and we must watch out for the Cardinal's Guards.\" Aramis said as the five warriors stepped out the front door onto the street they had just retreated from. As fast as they could, the men ran down the road, Rhett's curiosity taking him to the point where he glanced at the doorway which had remained intact, still showing the inside of the Library. \"Silence, why don't the people walking around walk through the door?\" Rhett gasped as he was already worn out from the exercise. \"That path is only visible to outsiders. Not even our friends here can see it.\" As he had spoken this the three men slunk into a doorway and ran up a flight of stairs through another door. Rhett had to struggle to make it up them and was surprised to find that the weak looking walkway made no sign of age whatsoever. \"Few know the truth of what lies beyond.\" Silence slowly said to finish his explanation before Rhett opened the door to reveal a large, empty room with two windows on the opposite end. The only sort of additions made to the room were two wooden barrels which held daggers stabbed into them and swords and spears stacked inside. The entire area stank of mildew and dried blood, no doubt from the three trainers. \"Welcome, my boy, to your home for the time being.\" And Athos was right. Over the next week Rhett did not set foot outside that room. There were constant courses on fencing, blocking, spear use, attack techniques, dagger throwing, and numerous other techniques. It was exhausting his body and his mind to take in all this training in such a short amount of time, all the while not knowing what he would have to do with this new knowledge, praying he would not have to kill anything. On the seventh day Rhett had been fighting against both Porthos and Athos, with Aramis and Silence standing on the sidelines offering suggestion. Rhett had gotten to the point where he had memorized the fighting styles of the two men. It may not be fair and I may not be learning anything but that doesn't really matter so long as I kick their… He had no time to finish the thought as Athos swung his wooden sword in a downward arc towards Rhett's head. The speed was off due to a quick run to the pub which allowed Rhett to easily block the strike then throw it to the side. As he shifted momentum to deal the final tap to \"kill\" Athos, Porthos jumped in, his energy apparent as he spun his practice sword around the tip of Rhett's, causing him to become slightly disoriented. Just as he knew would happen, Porthos attempted to sneak in a jab at Rhett's heart. Rhett jumped to the side and quickly brought his sword down upon the exposed arm of his attacker, then swung slowly to the right in order to land the tap to defeat his opponent. Seeing his defeat as fair, Athos stepped away, leaving the remaining two combatants to duke it out for the victory. A small glimmer of happiness etched its way across Rhett's face. Athos wasted no time in attacking, and caught the trainee off guard. A solid blow landed across his back, the weapon not having been held back to have more \"teaching power\" as they called it. The other three suddenly exploded in laughter and applause at the sudden victory. Rhett bowed to Athos and vice versa, and then Aramis walked forward with his own practice sword. \"You can't allow yourself to be caught off guard like that. Always be looking for the next chance to die, and then avoid it. If you had turned around half a second sooner you would have been able to do exactly what you did to dear Porthos.\" There was a small sign of embarrassment at the mention of this sudden victory. Rhett could still feel the welt stinging on his back, but had learned that bringing it up only brings more pain. \"Thank you so much my brothers.\" Silence said to the three Musketeers. \"I can't tell you how much even I have learned. However, I think we have reached the point where we must depart. Our journey calls us elsewhere at this time.\" \"As you wish dear friend, but first we would like to grant one gift to our student, if it pleases you?\" Athos said, Silence responding with a shrug of indifference. The three men walked over towards one of the barrels and brought out a brown cloth that covered something. The three brought it forward, Silence pushing Rhett to his knees as he was surrounded by the men. Athos stood in front of the boy as he spoke the words, \"Rhett Samuels. By the power vested in us as Musketeers of the Guard, we appoint thee as an honorary protector of truth and light. Take this weapon and use it to battle your greatest enemies.\" At this the cover was removed to reveal a long silver sword with a golden colored hilt and red hand coloring. The blade was embossed with long, slithery designs which curled and twisted. As soon as Rhett grabbed the sword the wooden door burst open, and in a rush four men who resembled the musketeers except red in color marched in, swords drawn, standing at the ready. The four Musketeers and Silence all stood ready as well, swords drawn and prepared for battle. Just as Aramis was about to leap forward, a voice sounded on the stairs. \"Did you really think you could hide for long?\" A man walked up in an extravagant red uniform, his sword hilt swirling with twisted metal, his boots embedded with silver emblems and patches, his large hat holding a long and wide white feather. \"I told you I would find you!\" \"And we told you we would kill you!\" Porthos yelled out as he leaped with a jab towards the man. In that moment the room exploded in violence. Rhett, confused by the mass hysteria, attempted a dash at the door, but was blocked by one of the soldiers. Getting in a ready stance, Rhett nervously saw his sword wobble from his hands shaking. The soldier jabbed at Rhett, who swung his blade down like a pendulum to throw the attack to the side. Using his elbow, he slammed into the man's face, hearing a distinct pop. \"You should have taken him out boy!\" Screamed Silence, who, at that very moment, had leapt over a low slice and, midair, swung his sword so it sliced the jugular of his opponent, who crumpled to the ground. Shivers took over Rhett's body as he witnessed the sight. \"Watch yourself!\" Rhett swung around a barely blocked a slice at his back, very similar to his practice fight defeat from earlier. The two men were locked in combat, and Rhett was able to stare into the eyes of his assailant. That anger which seemed to emanate from his very being shook Rhett to the bone, but he saw his opportunity. The man lifted his foot to get the upper hand in this standoff, so Rhett pushed with all his might. Everything after that was a blur for the young hero. The man fell to the ground, sword flailing away from him. Rhett took one step forward and stabbed into the ground, feeling the resistance his enemies body put into the blow. Before he realized what had happened Rhett stared into those eyes once more as the last glimmers of an unfulfilled life left them. Suddenly, every bad feeling he had had from the week before returned. Every doubt and saddened thought filled his very being until he felt he could take no more. Just at the very brink of torture a cold hand gripped his shoulder and turned him to look directly in the warm eyes of a friend. \"We need to leave now!\" Silence yelled as he pulled Rhett away from the remaining six fighters, running towards a window. The two jumped, and fell for a very short time. The hard landing was made louder by their weapons clobbering to the ground. Two guards turned at this noise and slowly made the connection that these two people were in league with the Musketeers they had been sent to capture. The chase was afoot and Rhett ran as fast as he could down the street. Something was wrong though. Looking down, he realized Silence was far behind him, about to be caught. Save your neck or save your mentor? He contemplated quickly, then turned and scooped the book onto his back. The run was all the more tiring with this added baggage but as he leapt through the pathway to the Library, Silence jumped off and shut the small story the world had come from, a peace filling the room that gave Rhett more goose bumps than those black eyes that seemed to sputter out of existence at his cruel form of malice towards another being. Next Chapter: Burning Ring Of Fire[Chapter 6] Chapter 5: Burning Ring Of Fire The thick darkness of the library was so thick you could cut it with a knife. The only light that lit the room came in dark crimson flashes from the mountainous scene outside the small hut-like building as fire rained in the distance. That explains why everything is dead though Rhett as he rolled over on the hard ground. Thinking back to his home, Rhett was greeted with the warm feeling of his blankets, their simple security holding him during those long nights of emotional turmoil; His mother's cleanliness offering a safe-haven from his muck-filled life; His father's strong voice ringing out for the world to hear as he sang along to \"Wanted Dead Or Alive\". It's funny, I've never really thought about how nice home was…I still hate that stupid smile mom gets when I say 'yes' to something but still…nice he thought. Silence rolled over very loudly, his long, drawn-out moan breaking the subtle peace Rhett had acquired through his momentary mediation. The whole scene came back to him as even more of a shock than it had before. Quickly sitting up, Rhett looked towards the small table against the far wall, the lamp hanging over it put out to avoid any possible communication between the Lectros and The Pagemaster as to their location. Leaning against the table rested Rhett's sword, a gift from his Musketeer comrades, its blade glimmering in the low-light. Rhett lie back down and shut his eyes, but the moment he did so a vision rushed into his mind. It showed tens of thousands of books being marched towards a large stack of books with an extremely small opening, all led by Satires who prodded them while hurling insults. A small book, no larger than ten pages, cried in the crowd for its mother, only to be picked up by a Lectro just as the mother ran over. Rhett watched in horror as the Satire lifted the young child into the air and dropped it to its death, all the while the mother screamed for her baby. Rhett sat up in a cold sweat, his legs and hands were shaking. For some odd reason he had been struck with a combination of fear and anger. Anger towards any who wished harm on these poor creatures; anger towards the one who started this infernal mess, but also fear towards him; fear of his power, of his malice. Rhett wiped his forehead then looked once more at his sword. It almost glowed with what seemed like a purpose. He looked down at his hands and felt almost guilty, I'm the chosen one. I am here to free these things and I've been screwing around. When am I gonna actually do something about it? Almost immediately Rhett stood up and softly walked over to the table so as to not wake his resting companion. He slipped on his shoes then tied the scabbard around his waist. Lifting the sword to eye level, he examined the elegant details of the craftsmanship. It's an amazing piece of work, but now it will serve its purpose he thought as he sheathed the sword then slowly but surely walked towards the door to the dreaded landscape ahead. Standing at the door, Rhett turned around and looked at the sleeping book. \"I'm doing this for you Silence,\" and with that he was off. As he took his first few steps out the door he automatically noticed the terrible smell of burning and of soot. The ground was more treacherous than he remembered from his first time traversing it, although the last time he did have his adrenaline in hyper drive. Every few steps he would step on a long dead piece of plant life, snapping it promptly in two. As the house got further and further away Rhett began noticing how cold it had gotten. It was strange feeling this alone even though he felt he had only been traveling for just a short while, but then he stopped. A feeling of utter dread filled the air just as a low whining sound filled his ears that slowly grew in intensity until it forced him to his knees in agony. The noise was unbearable and it took every ounce of strength not to tear his ears right from his head, although his voice worked wonders as he screamed out. Just as he was about to give up a circle of crimson light formed around him on the ground, brightening quickly until it was so bright Rhett slammed his head to the ground, only to find the previous rough stone floor had been replaced by a smooth one. With the ringing and light suddenly gone, Rhett looked up to see a large cavernous area with walls, floors and ceilings formed from stone books, just as Silence's home. The air had a dull red light about it almost as if from imaginary torches on their last length of life. Rhett sat up and examined himself. Everything seemed to be just fine except for the fact that he had no idea where he was. Putting his hand on his sword as a way to mentally counteract the ever growing feeling of despair he took one slow step forward. Scarcely had his foot touched the ground when two red and black swirling orbs formed in the air, spinning in place until two Lectros emerged from the abyss, both staring straight at Rhett. \"Come quietly boy…\" the one on the right said in an almost witch like tone that chilled Rhett to the bone. \"…And we promise not to kill you.\" the second chimed in obviously just to annoy the first one. This one looked as if some of its pages had been ripped out because its large spine countered its small width. \"Wh….wh….wh….\" Rhett tried to say, but shock took his vocal cords just like feline quadrupeds take tongues. \"Where are you? You're in The Pagemaster's Keep, home to Lord Blaine, ruler of all the lands! Saver of our people! Redeemer of the balance of….\" The battered book said before it was interrupted. \"Oh pipe down! Otherwise we won't get as much of a reward!\" The witch spoke up. The two nodded at each other and hovered towards Rhett, eyes lacking any form of expression, tongues licking large fangs that seemed like rebar in an unfinished foundation. Rhett, frightened by this sight, unsheathed his sword and swung horizontally at the two. Just as his blade was about to strike the first, everything froze. His arm was stuck in the air, but the two Lectros had ceased to move. \"I knew you would come. I know you will die.\" A loud voice boomed through the entire cave like structure. It caught Rhett off guard, but unable to move his body to examine where the sound originated from, he was forced to watch as the tip of his sword began to melt away into nothing which followed down to his arm. His breathing becoming erratic, Rhett used all his might in an attempt to move his body as immense pain accompanied the missing limbs, but found it was feeble as the wave of disintegration moved throughout his entire body, ending with his eyes. The pain was enormous. The pain was everywhere. The pain was too much for him to take, so the second his body became completely engulfed was the second he blacked out completely. His mind raced to images of his mother, father, sister and Silence. He thought of how his death had come to quickly, of how he had failed to save the people, of how he would miss everyone and everything. When the darkness faded he found himself in a circular room. Torches along the walls were the only light source, and were a dull one at that. On the floor lay a rug of simply exquisite design that spread along the entire floor. The design on the giant placemat appeared to be that of fire, brimstone, dragons, lions, eagles, and a woman standing in the center. A large wooden desk sat at the farthest wall from the door directly behind Rhett; to either side of him were paintings, all of one man… \"Surprised? I certainly am. I never thought you would have survived the initial journey. It takes a man of real power to survive that.\" An almost adult voice came from a chair that spun around, revealing a man sitting with his fingers touching inquisitively on his lips. He stared at Rhett with bright brown eyes that looked more amber than anything. \"Blaine.\" Rhett spoke in a low, angry tone at the realization of who had controlled these past events. \"Ah, so you do have a brain!\" Blaine spoke as he stood up and ran his fingers through his short shaggy hair, not even long enough to be in his eyes, \"I was worried my next victim would be a 'tard!\" Rhett couldn't hold back his anger any more. In one single motion he unsheathed his sword and leapt at Blaine in a downward strike. To an untrained fighter, this attack would have been unblockable, but Blaine leapt easily to the side of the attack, hands behind his back the entire time and kicked his foe to the ground like he flicked a fly. \"You see boy, you cannot beat me. I control the elements,\" At this he held his hands out and two orbs formed in either hand, one of fire, ice, lighting and what appeared to be wind, that floated around each other quickly, \"I control the population, but most of all, I control the world. You don't stand a chance against me.\" Blaine turned around and began walking away, so Rhett leaped up once more with the same attack, this time however Blaine turned around. The balls he had conjured had disappeared and had been replaced by a staff that held the image of an open book cast in gold at the tip, which he used to block the attack. \"I will free this land, you will not win!\" Rhett was launched backwards, sliding to a stop. Blaine leapt forward, attempting a jab at his foe's heart, only to find the boy had slid to the side of the attack, getting ready to attack his exposed side. Swinging his staff sideways, he dealt a solid blow to the forehead to his enemy, who stumbled backwards just enough to allow another quick jab at his chest. The attack his as well, but wasn't enough to do much damage because as Rhett was hit he rolled with the staff so he was standing directly to the side of Blaine. Attempting to slice sideways, he found his strike hit empty air. Looking up, he discovered Blaine flying through the air as if he had wings. It was hauntingly beautiful, that is until he stopped flying quickly to hover in the air, offering enough time to shoot a jet of fire at Rhett. With little cover, he attempted to roll out of the way but the heat was so tremendous he felt his clothes singed to the greatest degree. When he stood up from his roll the short burst of flame had ceased but was no replaced by a strong gust of wind that threw Rhett backwards, slamming against the wall and rolling onto the floor beneath. Muscles aching, head throbbing, Rhett tried to stand up but was stopped by four sheets of ice that held his hands and feet to the ground. \"LET ME UP YOU….\" \"Woah now, why don't we cool down so I can explain everything to you before you die.\" Blaine said softly in that adult tone as he slowly floated to the ground. The Pagemaster staff dissolving into dozens of small blue lights that slowly faded from existence. \"What are you talking about? You imprisoned the books and…\" \"Will you please!\" Blaine screamed to silence the boy, which worked quite well. \"I speak of the prophecy. The one that says that one day a boy will come to save this world, and he shall be divinely chosen.\" \"Ya, so.\" \"Don't you think it odd your name being what it is, Rhett Samuels?\" Shock and terror filled Rhett's mind as it raced so fast it could win the Daytona Five Hundred in six seconds flat without a pit stop. \"How… how the hell do you know my name?\" \"Think about it, a boy with your name being the chosen one. Ironic is it not?\" Rhett stared at Blaine with a questioning look that obviously did not give him the satisfaction he wished for. \"You mean you haven't realized yet! Wow, you must be a 'tard!\" Summoning a jet of fire he burned the name \"rhett samuels\" into the wall. \"Now look at what happens when I do this,\" and as he said that he wrote over it so that it read, \"RhETt SAMuels\". \"So what?\" Rhett honestly didn't get it, but sudden shock filled his blood stream like heroin as Blaine wrote directly underneath it \"MASTER\". \"You see! You have been chosen since you were born to do this, there is no escaping your fate. You will die here, along with the others.\" At this he waved his hand and the earth from the wall around Rhett's name fell to reveal names that read \"DESten TRelvOYER\", \"ROn proIVASon\", and \"ROy TuCkEt conThORP\" among others. \"You are not special, you are not unique, you are the same as the rest of them. All chosen to die\". Blaine raised his hand so it held a large ball of lightning that cackled and fizzed in his hand so much that his hair stood up from the static. Rhett, too shocked at this sight of so many dead heroes that seemed to be too innumerable to count and the fact that this was not a happen chance thing, failed to notice that his imminent demise was close as hand. \"Goodbye 'master'. Say hello to the rest of them for me!\" Just about to bring his hand down on the stunned boy, a large ruckus was heard outside the single door. Steel on steel and creatures screaming out in what seemed like pain could be heard very distinctly, so much so that the handheld thunderstorm was collapsed in on itself for the time to allow a proper investigation. As he walked closer to the door, leaving Rhett to lie there, it burst open. Door fragments flew everywhere and smacked The Pagemaster in the head, knocking him cold. From the rubble emerged Silence, his sword glittered with scarlet blood. Examining the room, he found Rhett still lying on the floor, his ice cuffs having melted from their master no longer holding their solidic form in this immense heat. Running over, he lifted the boy so he sat up. \"Aye, how doest thou do?\" His familiar voice woke Rhett from his emotional slumber. He shot a gaze at Silence then grabbed onto him like he has never grabbed anyone before, not even his mother. \"No need to get emotional lad. However, we must leave this dreaded place… Quickly!\" When this was said Silence opened a small library he had, the doorway that opened appeared to be the inside of the small cabin like home they had been staying in. \"But, how will you get back?\" Rhett wasn't sure if he wanted to leave the person who had saved his life from absolute death. The dread of leaving was almost as much and that for the boys and for the books. \"I can traverse this pagescape faster than you could on horseback with a two day head start. I will meet you there in two days. Until then, do not leave that room. Do not attempt to come look for me because I will be ok. Do not open any Libraries. You never know where they'll go.\" \"I can't leave you. I won't!\" \"You must. You are far more important than I could hope to be!\" All of this was said extremely quickly, but not quickly enough as through the doorway and down the stairs there was heard a treacherous sound of screaming battle cries and threats from what sounded like an army of approaching Lectros. \"Quickly! You must leave! Wait for me! I shall return!\" Silence ran behind Rhett and pushed him through the door. When he fell through as easy as nothing he hit the floor hard, having fallen from the door which came from the ceiling. Instantly turning around and reaching upward to climb back through, Rhett yelled, \"SILENCE!\" just as the path dissolved away as fast as a snake strikes. Silence filled the empty room, although he was nowhere to be seen. Next Chapter: Behold The Darkness ","Summary":" Prologue: New Beginnings In the land of the pages, deep within the lore of old, there exists a worl"},{"Movie":"Pagemaster","Title":"Parallel to the Moon","Author":"GreenWallsOfArt","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6845389","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Here it is. My most prized possession, since childhood. The old titles on the old, wooden bookshelf slide beneath my spindly fingers. Most of them have faded with age, while some are still new- like they have spent but a few days on the shelf. Most have spines three inches thick, and others, a little on the lighter side, creating a mural with the colors of their covers, and the intricate script of their titles. \"You must really love books, don't you, Grandma?\" a girl's voice says behind me. I turn around to see a small girl's face peering at me. Just going on eight years old, she is lying in bed, her eyes sparkling green when she lays eyes on me. I smile at her. For more than an instant, I can see my face reflected in hers, framed by a head of strawberry curls. \"Yes,\" I answer, turning back to the shelf. \"Yes, I really do. And it's only a matter of time before you will too.\" I don't say so, but there is deep faith imbedded in my words. The slippery scratch of the spines is a magical feeling, making me feel like a five-year-old child who is lost in the rotunda of a great library for the first time, again. \"You think I'll ever read as many as you have?\" she asks me, in a tiny and timid voice. This isn't a hard question to consider. \"Oh, I believe you will,\" I reply. Making like an inchworm, I turn away from the bookshelf, and sit down on the foot of the bed. I sink into the soft, down mattress, and a low creak makes its way out from underneath. It goes unacknowledged, while the girl leans forward. \"How did you get so many of those books?\" she asks, a curious smile creeping across her lips. \"Well, that's a long story,\" I say, a little unsure. \"You know what; I think it'd be better if you went to sleep. I don't think your mom would want you staying up too late.\" She looks at me with imploring emerald eyes- a look that I can't ever resist. \"Please, Grandma,\" she pleas. \"I want to hear.\" As many people know, it's not really easy to win over a curious child. The look in her eyes brings me to the light switch by the bedroom door. My finger traces downward on the switch, and the room grows dim, until it's like twilight. Now in the limited light, she looks like a little cherub beneath the tulle canopy of her bed. She wriggles out of her sheets, placing herself differently against the pillows, as moonlight starts to creep through the blinded window. Without even uttering a word, I'm already being driven back to the days of so long ago. I can remember it all now as if it happened only moments ago. When I grew up, and left my home for four more years of school, in college. When I was a young woman, struggling to leave my mark on a world that couldn't quite find me. While I kept secrets of my years as a child with imagination, hoping for someone I could confide in after so many years. The life of a woman, whose name was Chloe Dewey.[Chapter 2] I'd spent all my life in the little town of Shady Creek, a lonely suburb in the midst of a vast Midwestern countryside. To a complete newcomer with half a brain, it might sound like a peaceful town where everything was quiet and tranquil, where normality was the norm, and every house looked like the one next to it. Well, to be honest, they couldn't be more correct. And yet, they couldn't be more wrong. From my bedroom window, I watched the world change. The rainbow tricycles became big-shot, daddy-bought cars. The RC's were cell phone video games—bought on sale if you were lucky enough. And the ding-dong ditchers ditched their games for activities that, let's just say, shouldn't be mentioned. It was much like the progression from day to night. In the morning, everyone spent hours digging out their toys after a hearty breakfast, excited about starting their day, even if there wasn't a ray of sunshine to be seen. Come afternoon, there would be adequate laughter, with popsicle stands, and games whizzing through the streets. At sunset, everyone was waiting to catch the final rays of daylight, before dinner and homework came around, and stole them away for the rest of the time. After dark, the streets were dead. No laughter, so screams of delight, and absolutely no hearty games. Imagination was blown out like a birthday candle. At least, until the next set of kids came out the next day to continue in their childish ordeals. The sad thing was, that in the last few years, I was watching the world of laughter and rainy-day activity, become the today that was yesterday's future. Of course, usual, everyday lives remained, in which the children went to school, and the parents worked around the clock. But because we were moving into a new millennium, with new technological advances to fit the new century, television shows, radio programs, and many new gadgets were coming out every month—working their way into everyone's lives. But most of all, computers were growing faster than ever before—to where they were faster than looking something up in an encyclopedia, dictionary, almanac, or anything else you could find. In the year 1998, when I was fourteen, computer games and the Internet were like finding the Holy Grail, so it was hard not to get sucked into the craze of everything. I thought of it like a whole new adventure, that could be worthy of a good story in a book. Perhaps it would be exciting, seeing a whole new world to observe, as I liked. Only when word started coming around, about audio books and computers replacing books in the media, did I begin to think otherwise. And here I was, five years later, sitting in my own little college dorm, watching the world go by—the world that was slowly forgetting the feeling of picking up a book. One afternoon, I sat in the library on the campus. It was an enormous, wide open place, with ceiling-high windows that faced Lake Michigan, capturing a perfect view of the sunset while it splashed color across the grey-blue waters. I hunched myself in a desk chair, leaning over a laptop, typing a novel. Creating novels was a newer pastime of mine. It was another step in keeping my mind off how quickly the world was changing, and held my brain in an active state, reeling with images that only the written word itself could conjure. By the light of the sun, wizards cast spells, forbidden lovers eloped, young children grew up in wild and crazy worlds, and tragic heroes got their vengeance, absolutely swept away in a world all my own. Oh, how much I adored books. It was a fiery passion that fueled me beyond anything else. And because I read so much, I was capable of answering the difficult questions in lots of my classes; all thanks to the endless knowledge I had been given. I was honor roll, the object of substantial scholarship offers from colleges all across the country. And believe me, I was excited. I'd been thinking about college for a long time, wondering where I would end up, though I never thought that day would come so quickly. In the meantime, school life was bearable enough. Most kids liked me well enough, and treated me like everyone else in the class. But even though I was smart, I was a shy little thing. I didn't speak very much, unless prompted to do so by a teacher or another student. Though treated me with respect—in the presence of a schoolteacher, anyway—there were still those who thought of me as somewhat different. A cruel classmate of mine from childhood even told me once, \"Face it, Chloe. You aren't like the rest of us. You're, you're—you're just like the moon. The moon in a sea of stars.\" I was flattered, and yet, I was struck dumb by such a statement. That seemed a precocious thing to say, though I found I didn't really like the way it applied to me. Was I really so utterly different from everyone else, simply because I loved books? I didn't like to dive too deep into something like that. I mean, I knew I was uniquely different, but the way that girl said it, she made it sound like I wasn't human. Like some creature that popped out of nowhere that fascinated people for a time, but then grew weary of, once the excitement grew boring. But not too later, after I had turned nineteen, and I was well into my freshman year of college, I decided I was going to need so much more than just sitting, simply reading and typing stories. So, I piled a few extra savings out of my pocket, and headed into a risky adventure around the little town where I now went to school. I had been eager before to leave Shady Creek, but now that I had seen something wholly new, I was hungry for more. The opportunities for adventure were numerous, and despite that I was scared, I didn't really care to act afraid. I was on my own, and only I could make magic for myself. Besides, if those daring individuals in those stories could take risks, why couldn't I? For an hour or so, I sat on a hard, plastic chair on the bus. Through the sheen of morning fog on the window, I still saw many of the same things I viewed from my dorm window- tall groves of trees stretching down many a street; high, rolling hills—their summits reaching far enough that they could kiss the sky, and giant birds flying with their great wings sweeping the heavens. All at once, the loud sound of an announcement over the intercom shattered my reverie. I glanced outside at the station. And then, taking a deep, anxious breath, I stood up to get off the bus. On the bottom step, I was faced with a big sign beside the station door. Welcome to Lowell Falls ,it said. At long last! A smile on my face, I began to walk further into town. Apartment buildings, stores, and houses occupied every spot on the streets, cars zooming past them like flies. The long rows of buildings seemed as good a place as any to begin my search for somewhere to go first, so I simply headed down the street, pedestrians walking to and fro on the sidewalk, with umbrellas over their heads for the early morning mist. On occasion, I glimpsed behind me to see how far I had gone. When I noticed that the station was far behind me, I turned on my heel with fresh excitement, and stepped further into the unknown dwelling, known as Lowell Falls.[Chapter 3] For a long time, I ambled across the sidewalks, swinging my messenger back to and fro from my shoulder. It wasn't too unpleasant a day, despite the fog, and the mist that drifted from the sky. I didn't concern myself so much with the weather, in any case. This adventure was too grand to ignore, because it was the first time I had ever been alone in an unknown city. Lowell Falls was not much different from Shady Creek, I soon found, but there was an exception to that. No one here knew me, which gave me an advantage. I could swing by, humming something under my breath, and people could just pass it off as a silly whim. No one could shun me, or think me strange right away. So, I was excited to see the city before I had to stop anywhere. I had my jacket hood up to protect me from the fog, and my excitement to drive me forth. At this rate, there was nothing to stop me from walking until I had to drop down. But of course, day soon had to become dusk. And the streets, once teeming with people, grew quieter and quieter as time passed into night. Finally, there were only five to ten people who passed me. The rain still continued to fall, and the wind drove me on as the lamps of the pubs and apartments started to flick on. The mist turned to rain the darker it got. I didn't mind it so much, at first. Although, the rain soon pattered enough on me that I had to duck under the awning of the building nearest me. I pressed myself against the wall, trying to inch out of the rain. The sounds of laughter, clicking of billiards balls, and sports announcers on a television crept through the green wooden door, but I wasn't quite interested in that. The longer I stood there, the more I learned how achy my legs were from the walking. Right above my head, there was a bright lantern, and being out of the rain was pleasantly warming now, after walking in the cold mist all day. So I just pushed my hood behind my head, let my bag drop to the ground, and stood there while my body relaxed. I leaned my head on the wall, contemplating everything I had come across. But while I did so, the aching in my legs must have caught up to me, so I closed my eyes, and took long breaths in the meantime. It was pretty pleasant to listen to the rain splatter on the awning, and centimeter by centimeter, my shoulders dropped, and my arms slumped against my sides in a dreamy calm. I could stay there for a really long time, if I wanted to. My body was unexpectedly lurched back into the wall, when the door suddenly opened, causing my messenger bag to fall from my fingers altogether. On fumbling legs, I bent down to pick it up, but briefly looked up to see who had bumped me. A woman, who looked to be about fifty years old, stumbled out, grumbling to herself. She dusted off her heavy coat before turning to face me. In the light of the lantern on the wall, her soft features shown gently, to accentuate her heart-shaped face. Chocolate-brown eyes glanced back at me, framed by a head graying blonde hair, but carried an expression of absolute concern. \"I'm so sorry, honey,\" she said, bending down to help. \"I hope I didn't hurt you.\" \"No, that's all right,\" I replied. \"I didn't see you coming out.\" \"Will you be all right?\" she asked, holding out the handle of my bag for me. \"Oh no,\" I answered, with a slight chuckle. \"A little bump never hurt anyone.\" The woman smiled at me shortly before speaking again. \"Well, I apologize once more, and, I'd better get going,\" she said. \"It's getting late. Have a good night.\" With that, she began walking down the soaked sidewalk towards a car a long way down. I was both stunned and excited at the same time. After a long quiet day, my heart was still slamming with the surprise of meeting someone. Suddenly, my mind was racing, even more so, as I watched the woman walk away into the rain. It didn't look like it was going to let up any time soon, and I didn't feel much like traveling back to campus at this time of night. Besides, I felt strongly that there were places I hadn't seen yet. This adventure had to continue. Just, not in this weather. Not tonight. But, I certainly wasn't going to spend the rest of the night searching for a hotel on my own, so I fast-walked up behind the woman. \"Pardon me,\" I began. \"But do you know where the nearest hotel is?\" \"Oh,\" she said, drawing back her head a little. \"That's a long way into town, even without this rain.\" My shoulders deflated, and my bag dropped to the ground with a clunk. \"But even so, it doesn't seem plausible for you to be walking there in this weather.\" She gestured toward her small, beige car. \"There's actually a Holiday Inn fifteen minutes into town. Can I give you a ride there?\" As anxious as I was to get out of the rain, I was still hesitant to take a ride from this woman, even if she seemed like some sweet aunt on her way home, or something. But before I could move either way, she held out her hand. \"It doesn't seem that we have really met. My name is Celeste Parr. Nice to meet you,\" she prompted. \"Chloe Dewey,\" I finished, shaking her hand. She gave a subtle nod, and half-smiled, before an awkward silence followed. \"You all right, honey?\" Celeste asked me, finally noticing my thoughtful expression. I snapped abruptly from my thoughts. \"I'm fine, thanks,\" I said. Then, with a shiver in the cold, I straightened myself, and looked Celeste right in her eye. \"You sure you can take me there?\" Celeste nodded, and said, \"Yes.\" With a cynical eye, I walked into the open car door, and Celeste climbed in beside me. … Through the rain, Celeste and I drove down the quiet, drenched streets, past quiet buildings that had been closed for the night. Halfway through the trip, my hands wandered away from my bag handle, and at the momentum of the car, it fell down to my feet. With a bump, the contents spilled out- including the paperback I had! I scrambled to pick them up in the dark, but Celeste's careful eye was easy to spot from the corner of my sight. \"What's this?\" she inquired, pointing to the book. \"Oh, that's just an old paperback,\" I said, trying to put it as nothing, while I pulled my bag back up to my knees. \"' The Shining , by Stephen King',\"she read, just as the book slipped into my bag. I might have been mistaken, but her face lit up as she looked at me in the flashing glare of the streetlamps. \"You like to read books too?\" \"Yeah, but just not the audio books they're making these days,\" I answered. \"They're wonderful, aren't they?\" Celeste asked. \"How they can bring you into these worlds where it's your own little place of imagination.\" I was taken aback by those words, as they were exactly what I'd held strongly all my life. And suddenly, I wasn't quite as skeptical of Celeste. The enthusiasm in her voice was enough to tell me she wasn't trying to kiss up to my own love of books. Our loves seemed almost equal, if not, judging by her voice, slightly outmatched. Then, we both started talking- often at the same time- about how the both of us adored books so much. The energy in our voices was startling, so it surprised me when I realized that I was having fun talking to Celeste about it. Celeste herself was gripping the steering wheel as she spoke of what she liked to read, and how it was such fun to enjoy the adventures and knowledge she got. And all the while, I just gaped at her. She was speaking like she was talking about her first love, but there was really no guessing that she was. Then, Celeste's face twisted into a kindly smile. \"You know,\" she began, \"it's not every day that I come across a person who's as passionate about reading as you are. And, it's just as rare to find a newcomer in Lowell Falls. You don't have to, of course, but do you think you'd like to come and stay at my house for the night?\" \"Yes…I suppose, I can,\" I replied after a short moment of hesitation. She simply nodded at me, and turned the car onto another street. The city was soon left behind, and we were in a quaint little neighborhood, with simple one-story houses lining the streets. Celeste drove into the driveway of one of them, a small brick house with a blue, shingled roof. She led me inside, and showed me to the guest room, a cozy little nook at the back of the house's main hallway, with a double bed, and a large curtained window. By that time, I was so tired I could have lain down on the bed, and fallen asleep right then and there. But I still had just enough left to thank Celeste for her kindness and make myself comfortable in the room. Following Celeste's directions, I went to the bathroom, and swished some water in my mouth. Back in the bedroom, I stripped down to my undergarments, and climbed into the bed. I shivered a little, as I imagined that no one had slept in these blankets for a long time. My eyes shut against the pillow, and when I yanked the covers up to my chin, the spell of sleep was already upon me, hardly able to remember where I was, or what may happen in the morning.[Chapter 4] So, that was how it got started. I was no longer deemed an outsider, but I was welcome. Well, that was, as far as Celeste was concerned. I had yet to know if she was going to keep up the hospitality for me. I didn't dwell too much on it before I went to sleep, but I had the feeling that she was sharing this decent-sized house with more than just herself. A husband perhaps, but still definitely someone worth meeting. So, the next morning, the sunlight came high up on the trees and rooftops beyond the backyard, rising to a beauteous occasion. It took me a moment to realize where I was, because I was so used to watching the sun come up over the lake. Now, there were tiny bunches of short grass, with long expanses of tall trees, separated from the house by a high iron fence. It took me by surprise, but nonetheless, it was lovely. I had to sit in bed a moment longer to watch the world start to come alive. Finally I had to force myself out of the bed. When I had repositioned the sheets, I dug into my messenger bag for the extra sweater and jeans and undergarments, folding my old clothes on the dresser by the window. And then, combing my fingers through my long storm of red hair, I opened the door, and crept down the hallway. Celeste was standing near a toaster oven in the kitchen, staring intently at two pieces of toast behind the glass door. \"Morning, Celeste,\" I prompted. She turned around and smiled cheerfully. \"Oh, good day, Chloe,\" she replied, pulling open the toaster oven door. \"I assumed you'd be up soon, so I took the liberty of making some breakfast.\" She reached by the sink and grasped at some peanut butter and jam. \"I hope you prefer white bread.\" \"Most definitely.\" I turned to sit down at the table, but stopped suddenly. My thoughts about Celeste's house had been correct. She was sharing her house with someone else, but it was certainly not a husband of any kind. In fact, it was someone much smaller, and purer, than a husband. A small girl sat at the head of the short table. She looked to be about eight years old, with skin as pure as ivory, looking creamy soft, while she munched on a piece of toast. Her long golden hair fell past her shoulders like a waterfall, combed straight as sticks on her head. She looked so charming, not to mention that she was quite pretty. Actually, she had the kind of appearance that kids slightly older than her would give their recess time—and more—for. There wasn't a freckle, or obnoxious birthmark, on her arms or face, and for some reason, I was surprised she didn't have a plastic tiara on her head. So then I flinched a little when the girl looked up from her toast, meeting me with eyes that glittered like sapphires. She gave me a funny look, so I thought maybe I should back away from the table. But she first shied away into her chair, and didn't say anything. \"Hi,\" I said instead, trying not to throw myself into a quick introduction. \"Hi,\" she replied, in so small a voice, that I had to lean forward to see if I heard her right. She didn't look up for a long time, and when she didn't acknowledge me again, I decided maybe she didn't know who I was. I stole a glance at Celeste, kind of shocked that she didn't tell this girl about me. I opened my mouth to ask her what kind of reasoning that was, but she came to the table first, and put down a plate of toast in front of the girl. \"I know this is sort of sudden, for both of you,\" she said to the girl, who glanced up at Celeste. Gently, Celeste placed her hands on the girl's shoulders. \"Chloe, this is my niece, Aurora. Aurora, this is Chloe Dewey. She's a college student from Kenosha, who spent the night with us.\" \"It's good to meet you,\" I said, smiling my best. \"You too,\" Aurora replied, glancing up at me timidly. She held her gaze on me for a moment, and slowly, she managed to form a smile. But she soon turned her head, and craned herself towards Celeste. \"I didn't know she was here, Aunt Celeste,\" she whispered. \"When did she get here?\" \"Don't be shy, Aurora,\" Celeste assured her. \"Chloe is a very, very nice young lady. She's a pretty avid reader too.\" Aurora turned from Celeste, and eyed me with an increasingly widening look of awe. \"Hey, that's just like Rich,\" she whispered, almost excitedly. Then she looked around the table, finally pointing to a chair next to her. \"You want to sit down?\" she asked. I blinked a few times at the invitation, but didn't hesitate. I was impressed; Aurora was even more of a lady than I thought. Now, we were all sitting down at the table, as Celeste poured us all drinks, and trimmed the crust from her toast. \"Too crunchy for my liking,\" she explained, but Aurora just frowned crookedly at her. I laughed at the animated expression Aurora had, and Celeste joined in quickly. It was quiet for a few moments, but Celeste had many questions to ask me, so the kitchen was never quiet. She asked me mostly to explain how I was enjoying college, and what my hobbies were. Usual small talk, but she managed to keep both me and Aurora engaged just fine. When Celeste had finally stopped talking—as animatedly as the expressions Aurora reacted with—I sat forward, and glanced towards Aurora. \"Wait, Aurora,\" I spoke up, \"you said something about someone named Rich earlier. Who's that?\" \"Rich?\" Aurora said, tilting her head. \"Oh, yeah, I know! He's my cousin. But, you know, it's not like you'll see him much around here. I mean, besides helping me and Aunt Celeste around the house, he's practically locked up in his room, like he's playing hide-and-seek all the time.\" \"Hmm,\" I said, nodding my head. \"Yeah. He's probably the only person in the world who can read seventeen books in one week!\" Aurora held up a finger to emphasize her words, and held her eyes wide, as if even she couldn't believe such an accomplishment. In any case, I was getting a good idea about who Aurora was talking about, though I didn't want to say for sure yet. There could only be one thing that would surely indicate who this Rich was. Aurora moved her finger to point to me. \"Actually, he has a special necklace just like that,\" she said. I looked down at the golden pendant that hung down my chest. I took the bottom of the chain between my fingers, and turned it to observe the details etched into the gold. The pendant was about the size of a half-dollar, but was pretty heavy with detail of flowers and vines. Along the edges, Roman numerals were scratched in, like the outside of a clock. And in the center of the pendant, was a tiny circular window, looking like a faceless pocket watch. A tingle shivered across my arms while I let the pendant drop back to my chest. Aurora was more correct than she thought, when she said that the pendant was special. I'd been wearing it since I was a baby, when my grandfather had given it to me, though I didn't appreciate the full magnitude of it until I was a little older. But, Aurora had mentioned that her cousin Rich had a pendant much like mine. I couldn't fathom anyone having something so similar, but somehow, the image kept coming up in my mind as a silver pendant, rather than a gold one. And it was several sizes larger, so Aurora couldn't be right about it. But, was she, really? The ideas she gave me were so ridden with familiarity, though I couldn't quite break through it. \"Come on, Aurora,\" Celeste said, pushing her chair in, and putting the dishes in the sink. \"Time to catch your ride to Sunday school.\" Aurora reached beside her chair, and grabbed a backpack. She raced towards Celeste, and took a dark blue coat from her hands, slinging the bag onto her shoulders. And as if on cue, a car horn honked from outside the door, and we all turned our heads at once. Aurora flung her arms quickly around Celeste, and smiled at me while she walked out of the kitchen. \"Bye, Chloe,\" she said, disappearing out of view. \"Goodness,\" Celeste muttered after she heard the door close. \"Little Aurora. I love that girl like summer and books, but when is she ever going to clean up her own mess?\" She bent over the table, and swept a sponge across the jelly globs, and crumbs, on the table. \"She a messy little thing?\" I asked, chuckling. \"The worst. She's a little flighty, but, my god, does she have a big sense of imagination,\" Celeste said, sighing and laughing at the same time. \"Every time she plays a game with her friends, she's always the first to come up with something new.\" She dumped the sponge in the sink, and looked out the window at the forest beyond. \"Why, just the other day, when it looked like they would all just die of boredom, she popped out of the woods with flowers and twigs tied into her hair and clothes. So, they all decided to be tree sprites. She dressed a doll up as a tree monster, and they ran and hid from it. No one came back out from those woods, for hours and hours.\" Not just a sweet girl, but one of a creative mind. Why ever didn't I have a little sister like her when I was Aurora's age? Celeste drained the water from the sink, and then leaned against the kitchen island. \"But of course, she had to take a long bath to get rid of all the dirt,\" she sighed, turning herself around. \"We've got a long day ahead of us,\" Celeste said. \"And since Aurora won't be in the house for a few hours, there's a lot to do to fill the void. Although, there's got to be some part of Lowell Falls you haven't seen yet. What do you think of spending the day in town? We could relax, we could go into town, whatever it is that can get the very, very best taste of the town.\" \"You got a big library?\" I said. Celeste smirked at me. \"The greatest in the world. But, of course, that's not totally all.\" She pulled out a slip of paper from the drawer beside the sink, and started to write. \"Picture the shopping malls, the pubs, the restaurants—everything a big town should have.\" \"What're you writing?\" I wanted to know. \"Leaving a note for Richard,\" she said. \"You know, letting him know what the deal is with our day.\" \"Richard who?\" I asked, putting my hands on my hips. \"Aurora told me a little about him. And, I'm telling you, he sounds like someone I may just know.\" Celeste tore the note off the pad, and crossed the kitchen, slapping the paper onto the counter by a wireless telephone. \"Oh. His name's Richard Tyler,\" she answered. \"Does that ring a bell?\"[Chapter 5] Thanks to the sunlight, the fog and mist of yesterday were gone. The sidewalks and awnings were still a little damp, and puddles littered the streets like the people who strode across the city walks. Celeste was more than happy to get out of the house, even more so that we were heading out on such a pretty day. When she switched on the radio, the first thing she did was open her mouth to start singing. She let her voice ring out, tapping the steering wheel with her fingers, while she slid on her sunglasses. Despite the crooked look I gave her, listening to her singing, it was cute watching her have such a good time, when the real adventure hadn't quite begun yet. \"Can I turn it up?\" Celeste asked, when a song with a fast, catchy beat started on the station. \"What are you asking me for?\" I asked, shrugging. \"It's your car, and you're the one having so much fun. By all means, go for it!\" Celeste grabbed the volume knob, and tapped the roof of the car to the beat of the song. I slapped my head against the seat with my laughter, not trying to fight the rhythm. I didn't sing— at least, not as loudly or wholeheartedly as Celeste—but still had a good time while we drove. As Celeste turned the car off, she swept her hair from her forehead, slipping her sunglasses off her head. \"Spring is the best time to sing in the car, I always say,\" she said. \"But just you wait until summer, Chloe, when everyone's got their roofs down, blasting every dang station in Wisconsin.\" I nodded, looking around at the street that Celeste parked on. It was a string of small-town diners and shops, with lots more people than I had seen in the part of Lowell Falls I walked on the day before. The streets were wider, with taller buildings and wider windows in the shops. Families walked past us with periods of laughter and conversation, and lots of them even carried picnic baskets and coolers. Spring really must have sprung, for even in Shady Creek, no one was out this early in spring to take picnics in the park. But then, who said this town would always be anything like Shady Creek? \"This town is all ours, Chloe,\" Celeste said, pointing around the sidewalk. \"Anywhere is the first place.\" \"God,\" I breathed, feeling the heaviness of my decision, although Celeste had told me anywhere was fine. Now I definitely regretted my earlier declaration that Lowell Falls was like my hometown, because I didn't know where in the world we would start. \"That's all right,\" Celeste said, starting down the sidewalk. \"I'll show you.\" … . It wasn't that easy to keep up with Celeste as she pointed out each place to me, but I loved every minute of it. Celeste pinpointed everything like she was a little girl showing her parents her artwork in a classroom, bounding around perhaps as if she actually were a little girl. Even on the way back, Celeste couldn't contain her energy. She slapped her hands on the wheel, swinging herself to the music. \"Do you even sleep?\" I asked her, as we got out at her house. \"Only when I can keep my feet on planet earth,\" she said. \"It's not like I would try to be a couch vegetable in any case. There's too much to do around the house.\" \"But it's only you,\" I said. \"Right?\" If Celeste were a long string of Christmas lights, some of them blinked out after I asked her. She slammed the car door closed, and we walked to the front door, while she felt in her pocket for a key. \"Aurora lives with me,\" she said. \"She's been my adopted daughter since…well, the accident that took both her parents. As you can see, it's…it's…\" \"Oh, I won't press it,\" I said quickly. Celeste sighed. \"Thank you, Chloe,\" she said. \"It's not something that I like to speak about, even to myself. It's hard. It was a dreadful way for Aurora to start school for the very first time, and for her to have no one unless some kind soul out there could provide her a home. Given, she's a sweet little girl, but it's hard for me to raise her without help. She has so much energy, and still has so much to learn. That's why I employed my nephew, Richard, to help me look after her.\" I didn't talk for a moment. This was a lot to swallow—Celeste, who was always so happy and full of life, had a dark past that not even she could admit had happened to herself. But Aurora…what about her? Such a small girl, with no real family…and yet she… I didn't know how to react, too. Celeste hadn't told me what exactly had happened to make Aurora her adopted daughter, so I didn't know whether to say I was sorry, or give a physical gesture of sympathy. Indeed, I felt sorry for both my new friends, but…just how could I express it to her? \"Don't feel sorry for us, Chloe,\" said Celeste, patting my shoulder. \"I don't want you looking like that if you meet Richard.\" That name sent lightning bolts through me. It made me straighten up, and I started towards the door without waiting for Celeste to open it. And so, one bruised nose and a step later, we were back inside. I could see Celeste trying to hide back a half-giggle-half-gasp as I twiddled with my nose. But then, as I was doing so, I heard voices coming from the living room. I crossed through the hallway after dropping my bag at the stairs. One of the voices, I instantly recognized as Aurora's sweet, bubbly voice as she spoke words aloud. It sounded quite like she was reading something, and someone else was continuing where she left off. The other voice was deep and masculine, but still gentle and excited. My heart started to race, not because I was eager to greet Aurora again, but because I knew who was enjoying her company. \"Hello?\" I called into the hallway, before I turned the corner. \"Aunt Celeste?\" Aurora answered after a second. \"Is that Chloe?\" \"Yes, I'm right here,\" I replied. It was quiet, before suddenly, Aurora appeared before me. Her face was bright, and her eyes shining. I didn't know if it was because of her reading so excitedly, or if she was happy to see me. She showed me by grabbing my hand and taking me into the living room. There, out of the corner of my eye, I could spot someone else sitting on the couch—someone who wore fading jeans, and a dark maroon T-shirt, which made his curls of blonde hair stand out. And when I entered, he looked up at me with blue eyes, magnified through a pair of rounded glasses. \"Um….hi, Richard,\" I said. He made a small wave in my direction. \"The same to you, Chloe.\"[Chapter 6] For several long moments, I just took in the sight of my old best friend. And suddenly, everything we had ever done together flashed before my eyes. Truth be told, I hadn't seen Richard in over a year. He was once my best friend, but in this instant in time, he was everything to me again. And yet…I didn't know whether to rush into his arms, or say hello another time. Neither of us moved for a long time. It was like we were just standing there to give our hearts a few moments to slow down from just getting one another in sight. By the time I finally moved towards Richard, I noticed that both Aurora and Celeste were absent from the room. I couldn't tell right away if that was good or bad, but some part of me must have been glad to be alone, because I walked right up to Richard, and plopped down on the floor in front of him. \"You can sit up here too, you know,\" he told me, gesturing to the space beside him. I shook my head, and nothing else. Richard shrugged, starting to give me a puzzled look. \"Aren't you…glad to see me, Chloe?\" he asked. Now it was my turn to shrug. Of course, I was glad to see my best friend after so long, but once more, something stopped me from grinning like an idiot at him. Although, I can't say I was too surprised at his behavior either. Richard seemed a little restrained in the way that he didn't scoop me up and squeeze the life out of me. But I was the guest in what was technically his home, so instead I gave him a demure smile. \"How have you been, Richard?\" I asked. He leaned back a little in the couch, but still far enough to see me over his knees. \"Keeping up with my Aunt Celeste?\" he started. \"Well, I guess that's been easy. Keeping up with Aurora? That's a whole other story, I can say for sure.\" I chuckled, imagining Richard trying to run after Aurora when she was in the middle of playing pretend. From what Celeste had informed me, it would be a workout in itself just trying to keep her to sit still. \"I wish I could've seen her reading with you,\" I said. \"Hearing her is enough,\" Richard said. \"She kind of reminds me of someone you would have been when you were her age.\" \"I think she is me,\" I replied, only realizing how true the words were as I said them. I could suddenly see myself as a young strawberry-haired girl, reveling in her imagination, as much as young golden-haired Aurora seemed to revel in stories and the possibilities of the future. In some ways, I supposed she was the sister I never had. But then again, Richard was lucky to have her, for the times when I hadn't been around, which had been a very, very long time. Richard nodded. \"What about you, Chloe? How have you been…?\" I immediately recognized the tone of his voice trailing off. He was about to end his sentence with since the last time I talked to you, or saw you? Part of me was glad that Richard might be feeling the same awkwardness as I was, but another part of me was starting to boil a little. He and I both knew how long it had been since we made contact. Why…why wasn't he saying anything about it? \"Honestly,\" I began instead, straightening myself. \"I've missed you.\" Richard blinked a few times before he met my eyes full on again. He was quiet for a time, before he half-smiled. \"You know…in case you didn't figure it out…I missed you too,\" he said, though a little timidly. \"But I thought…I thought that, considering how long it's been since we last chatted, that maybe you'd forgotten about me in your studying or…something…like that.\" He laughed a little, leaning back in the couch. \"I did, just…not recently…\" I let my voice trail off. Richard stopped laughing, and repositioned himself so that he was just inches from my face. \"You… did ?\" he asked. \"Okay, now I'm confused. I mean, Chloe, we haven't made contact in over a year. I want to know just….what's wrong? What happened?\" \"Nothing,\" I said. So wrong. Everything just felt wrong about this, and it tore at me inside. This boy had been my best friend since I was a young girl—the brother that I never had. And I didn't want my visit here in Lowell Falls to be tainted by my feelings, especially by anything sour toward Richard. Besides, we shared a secret. It was a magical secret that no one but the two of us would ever keep. That was part of why my golden pendant was so special to me—it countered a silver compass that Richard had, which he kept on him at all times. With those two instruments, we could make our secret come to life, but it obviously wasn't something we did now. As much as I craved doing it again, I wondered what it would be like now that we were suddenly together again. I pondered to myself, if I could ever feel what I did for Richard again. Our past was darkened by something that I didn't like to remember at all, and it had found me here. … As evening fell, it was nothing but fun and conversation at the dinner table, and then in the den we gathered to play games, laughing till our stomachs hurt. Aurora slapped her cards down on the table so hard that our arms all rattled, and she giggled at Celeste's face when Aurora was so hard on the table. It was sweet. Sometimes, Aurora would giggle so that she fell against my shoulder. And when I got a good draw, she would pat me on the back, though she always swore to me she would get a better card. With each moment, I found myself liking her more and more. It had been a long time also since I had played any game with any child, much less a child like Aurora. Her enthusiasm, and Celeste's jovial nature, made me forget the turmoil that was now storming inside of me. But it was only stirred again later, when I realized that tomorrow was the day I would go back to Kenosha. I didn't have to, but I felt it would be a good idea not to overstay my welcome. That was, until Aurora found out, and she stopped me in the doorway on the way to the guest room. \"You're not going to leave soon, are you, Chloe?\" she asked. I knew what I had to say, and yet I found I couldn't say it to Aurora. I still had some time before school would start again, but I didn't know if I could stay for much longer, and face Richard after what had happened between us. Still, the longer Aurora and I looked at each other, the less I wanted to picture her disappointed face if I told her I was leaving. So, I walked into my room, with a shake of my head. \"But just feel free to throw me out whenever you like.\" \"I don't think we'd ever do that,\" Aurora said through giggles. I smiled down at her and patted her on the back. She hugged my arm, before she trotted off down the hall, her golden hair bouncing on her back. I had a hard time getting that image out of my mind as I fell asleep, because I couldn't help further noticing how much like me Aurora was. I guess that only made me like her even more, and wish that I could help take care of her as much as Richard did. But of course, I was more than happy to do so the next day, when Aurora was off from school as well. She talked Richard and me into playing games with her all day, like hide-and-seek, tag, and all sorts of imaginary games. Her lust for those games seemed insatiable, because she could always catch us, no matter how fast we ran from her. The trees in the yard were blooming with fluffy leaves too, so Aurora was having a bit of an advantage in hide-and-seek. My eyes scanned every which way to find her, but Aurora was such a quick little thing that it was very difficult to catch her. \"GOTCHA!\" a voice called, jumping out of nowhere. I screamed and jumped around, as Aurora was standing in front of me, laughing so hard she was cradling her stomach in her arms. \"I really gotcha' good!\" she said, continuing to laugh. A smile tore across my face, and we were both laughing at how I had screamed and jumped high up—like a little bunny rabbit, she said. Her laughter was more musical than any song as she swung through the grass, because, if she caught me or Richard, she would pounce on us, making us roll through the grass like playful puppies. Especially if she caught Richard, he would hold her and hug her like they were brother and sister, rocking her back and forth in his arms to help cease her wild giggles. The sunlight smiled on both of them, as the wind toyed with the grass around them. Part of me wished that that could be me that Richard was cuddling, instead of Aurora, but I couldn't bring myself to want that so bad. But then, as Richard was rolling through the grass blades with Aurora, something silver and round fell from his pocket. It clunked open when it hit the ground, and I was drawn towards it instantly. I picked it up from the ground, observing the marble detail of the compass face beneath the silver lid. Memories poured back to me like none other, and I had to sit down in light of the powerful images that stormed across my thoughts. And I wondered—I wondered if perhaps I were to put this compass back on top of a book, that it would have the same magic that it held for Richard, just as my golden pendant did for me… I saw us both suddenly—Richard and me—and all the adventures we used to have together before everything happened to separate us. Of all the books we had journeyed through, surviving thick and thin, conquering obstacles that no one ever does in regular life… \"Hey, Chloe, you found the compass.\" Richard came up to me, took the compass's chain, and slid it out of my hands. \"I didn't notice it had fallen out.\" Aurora came up beside him, pointing at the compass. \"You've never told me what that compass is all about, Rich,\" she said. \"Do you like to use it to find treasures or unusual places, or something like that?\" \"I did, once,\" Richard told her, giving me a wary eye. \"But, not too much.\" \"Just…what?\" Aurora pressed further. \"It must be for something special, because it's so old-fashioned. Look—it's silver, it's big, and is made of very shiny marble inside. It has to be!\" \"We'll show you someday,\" I piped up. Both Richard and Aurora looked at me. Aurora's face lit up like the dawn, but Richard just looked surprised. \"We will?\" he said. \"Sure,\" I replied. \"Aurora, since you're so fond of imagination and stories, we'll show you what this compass can do.\" Aurora glanced into the forest at that moment. Sun rained down between the trees, and their branches wavered in the breeze. \"Rich, Chloe, you think we could go into the forest first?\" she asked us. \"Now that the trees are green, it would be so much fun to explore them.\" \"Would Celeste be okay with that?\" I wondered aloud. \"I think so,\" Aurora answered. \"So long as we're there to go with you,\" I added. The three of us scaled the fence, fortunately without gaining scratches or bruises, and we took our first steps into the trees, with Aurora leading us ahead, her long, golden hair flying out as she ran further inside the forest.[Chapter 7] \"I didn't know there was a creek here.\" By this time, Richard, Aurora, and I were deep enough into the forest that Celeste's house was only a hidden picture in the trees. It was warm inside the woods, though there wasn't too much sunlight coming down between the branches. But now, much to Aurora's delight, we had found a creek cutting through the ground, and she was reaching down to touch the cool water. She traced shapes in the water with her finger, as Richard and I watched her. Aurora then stood up and looked ahead of the creek, noticing in the meantime that there was a wide log crossing the water. \"I wonder what's beyond this place,\" she wondered aloud. But she took a step back, and looked behind at us uncertainly. \"Go ahead, Aurora,\" Richard urged. \"We're coming with you.\" Aurora turned back ahead with newfound confidence, and started across the log. Her arms were spread out on either side of her, and her steps were small and precise. Then, taking a deep breath, I began to follow her, mimicking her motions; I guessed that the water wasn't very deep, but I wasn't about to take a swim in it. I could hear Richard's concentrated breaths behind me, and suddenly my own concentration wavered. My foot caught on part of the log, and I tumbled hand-first down into the grass, catching my palms on some sticks that stuck from the dirt. \"Ouch!\" I spat out on instinct. A pair of brown shoes stomped onto the ground next to me, and before I knew it, I felt myself being lifted back to my feet. \"Thanks,\" I said, when Richard let go of my hands. I caught his eyes long enough to see him shrug, but then grin, right before he started after Aurora. And just as quickly, the pain in my hands was numbed, and my lips found a smile on my face. But then, why couldn't I forget what had happened? I didn't want to, but it was all I could think of when I looked at Richard. I frowned; I didn't want to go on feeling like I couldn't look him in the face without wanting to run away. I tagged along between the trees, just trying to keep my eye on Aurora. Everything here seemed the same on this side of the creek, but with every step, Aurora grew more and more excited. \"This forest is amazing!\" she exclaimed, reaching onto a low tree branch and hoisting herself into the air. She looked like a happy little monkey, swinging from the branch. \"It's like a little fairy tale forest you hear about in those stories.\" Then her face lit up. \"Hey, Rich, Chloe, you think there is a fire-breathing dragon somewhere in these woods?\" I smiled sinisterly, causing Aurora to get an uneasy expression. \"There could be,\" I answered. \"They could be lingering in these trees as we speak.\" Aurora laughed as she jumped down from the branch. She looked all around, as if scouting for something. And with a motion quicker than the way she slapped down cards, she picked up a stick, brandishing it like a sword. With one hand, she swept her hair back from her face, and took her stance with both feet wide apart. Then she turned around swiftly, gesturing for me and Richard to follow her. There before her, stood an enormous cluster of trees that seemed to gather in a circle. But when she walked inside, looking around in all her rapture, she tripped and fell with a high yelp. \"Aurora!\" Richard and I raced over to her, where she was still on her behind in the grass. \"Are you okay?\" I asked, helping her up. \"I think,\" Aurora answered as she clenched her teeth together. Tears brimmed at her eyes, and her face turned a bright shade of red as she looked at her knee, which was pink from her fall. Gently, I began to rub it, feeling the raw skin. Aurora winced and grunted, trying to hold back more tears. \"What happened?\" Richard asked, looking around at where Aurora had fallen. \"I tripped on that,\" Aurora said, pointing at something sticking up out of the ground. It looked like a triangle of orange cardboard, about an inch thick. Curious, I touched the cardboard. It felt rough, like sandpaper, and felt a little papery along the width. So, I took a firm grip on it, and pulled. It must have been very far down, because it took a great amount of strength to pull it out another few inches—until it got stuck. Aurora, who had joined me, pulled back as far as she could, and suddenly went flying backwards when the object popped out of the ground. \"Good job, Aurora,\" Richard said. \"Let's see what this is.\" Aurora reached for the old, scratched object and picked it up to show us. \"A book?\" she asked, looking it up and down. Richard dusted off the dirty cover, revealing the title. \" Of Mice and Men ,\" he read, his face lighting up slightly. I had the same reaction. I remembered reading that book a long time ago. It had even been part of the secret adventures that Richard and I had when we were younger. Actually, I recalled every detail—how we had crossed into the Salinas Valley, and had met the farmhands that inhabited the setting. We'd barely escaped with our lives when a gunfight had begun, and yet I found I was fond of that venture. Then, Richard handed me the book. \"Chloe, do you remember this?\" he whispered. I raised one eyebrow in his direction. \"If you're talking about what I think you are, then I do.\" Richard winked back at me. \"What are you guys talking about?\" Aurora interrupted. I held the book out to her, and she took it gently. \"Aurora,\" I began, \"do you think you would ever want to read this book?\" Once more she looked it over and under, even opening the cover to flip through the pages. Dust and sand fell from the binding, getting onto her sundress. But Aurora seemed too preoccupied to care if her clothes got dirty. And the further that she looked into the book, the bigger her eyes became, and the wider her mouth opened. \"Aurora?\" Richard prompted her. Finally, she closed the book. \"Wow,\" she breathed. \"I've never seen a book like this.\" \"I don't think any of us have,\" said Richard with a slow shake of his head. Aurora zipped her eyes around the place where she had tripped. As she got up to move around, she clutched the copy of Of Mice and Men close to her side. \"I wonder if there are more of them around here,\" she said lowly. \"And, if there are, I think we should keep them! We could read them together! The three of us!\" Richard and I looked at each other. Though it took me a second, I could tell what sorts of thoughts were whirring across his mind. A smile was starting to inch across his face, and from the corner of my eye, I could see his hand reaching towards his pocket, where I knew the compass was. Almost instinctively, my hand reached to my chest, and my heart jolted when I felt my pendant, though not from feeling it there. Adrenaline coursed through me, and a collection of memories and excitement banged me hard enough that I stopped breathing for a moment. Judging from Aurora's tiny squeal of excitement, I knew Richard had consented to her request. And then she squealed again, when something fluttered out from the book to the ground. She bent down and picked it up. It was just as weathered and dirty as it's book home, even tearing at the center crease. Squinting her eyes, Aurora unfolded the paper, and began to read: \" To Whom It May Concern, Well, first of all, congratulations upon your discovery. You have uncovered a beautiful book with a classic story waiting inside for you to endure. But as these are the years where the magic of books has about been forgotten, I ask you to endure the adventures these stories will take you on. As my wife and I discovered, they allow us to do the impossible: slay a dragon, cast a magic spell, accomplish dreams, travel through time, and live a happily ever after. So, as of these books being very old, I ask you to please take care of them as though they were your own children and cherish them forever as I did. For I know they will bring you memories and journeys that you shall never forget.\" It was quiet after Aurora finished reading, except for the forest bending with the elements. All three of us were breathless in rapture to have made a discovery such as this. I mean, from what the note read, we were about to uncover some stories that probably hadn't been read from a real book since who knows when! \"There's no name?\" Richard asked, craning his head to look at the script on the paper. Aurora shook her head, speechless. \"Hmm,\" I said. \"If I didn't know better, I would say that someone like Mr. Dewey would have pulled off this kind of stunt.\" \"Who?\" asked Aurora. \"He was my grandfather,\" I explained. \"He used to run the library where Richard and I grew up. He died three years ago, but he was the one who gave me my gold pendant, and the silver compass to Richard.\" I held out my pendant in my palm, and Aurora stroked it with her finger. \"But…why would someone bury books?\" she pondered aloud, eyeing the book in her hand. Richard picked up the note. \"Beats me, Aurora,\" he answered. \"But I still think leaving behind these books was a wise thing to do—so someone else could find them someday.\" Aurora opened the book again, and she swept her hands across the pages to get rid of all the dust. \"Do you guys know anything about this book?\" Aurora wanted to know, holding it in front of me and Richard. \"Is it actually about mice?\" \"Well,\" I answered. \"it's actually a story of two men in the 1930's, and how they try to accomplish their dream of finding a home through all their struggles.\" Aurora's lips curled up again, but then, her eyes wandered from the book to the ground, where she raised a pointing finger. \"What's that over there?\" Our gazes moved from her point to another corner of cardboard pointing up out of the ground. Taking it in my hands, I pulled and pulled until it popped out of the dirt. \" To Kill a Mockingbird ,\" Aurora read, dusting off the book slightly. Richard opened the back cover and found yet another note tucked into the binding; also tearing. When he unfolded it, it said the very same thing that the first note had said. Again, Aurora's eyes were widening as she gazed at the book for a long time. \"I don't think I've heard of this one either,\" she said. \"Again, it's a classic book about the 1930's,\" I replied. \"It's the story of a girl's childhood in the South during the days when black people were treated badly and when she learns some important lessons about life from her brother and her father.\" Aurora gave me a weird look. \"That doesn't sound as interesting as the other book,\" she said. \"It's just as good as the other one, in my opinion,\" I added. \"Maybe someday if you read it, you will like it just as much as I did.\" \"Well, if what the note said is true, we all may have some real adventures together.\" Aurora put the book down, and started to pull at yet another cover sticking out of the dirt. And this time, Richard and I didn't wait to help her. ","Summary":" Here it is. My most prized possession, since childhood. The old titles on the old, wooden bookshelf"},{"Movie":"Pagemaster","Title":"From Wonderland to Oz","Author":"WogglebugLoveProductions","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12937242","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Amanda McNicolson was sitting dejectedly on the couch in her living room. She appeared to be watching the television set but was really not the least bit interested in what was on it. She was far too deep in her misery to care about it. Her gaze shifted over to the shelves nearby her and rested on the old photograph of her family, or rather of what her family formerly had been. Her parents had just recently divorced and now she and her mother were living alone together. She truly did not like these new living conditions at all. She did not understand her parents reasons for divorcing, well perhaps she did in a way as they had been arguing vehemently with each other on and on for many months beforehand about things which she had no clue about. And this had gotten progressively worse and worse and at times she would be scared when she could hear their loud voices and would cry herself to sleep privately and just hope that they would not go away and leave her all alone. And now it seemed one of them had indeed left her all alone, her and her mother. And in the past week her mother had seemed to be growing very distant from her. She rarely spoke to her anymore, and never smiled or showed any positivity whatsoever. When on one occasion when Amanda had asked her why this was she had replied that she was just so busy now in looking for a new job for herself. Amanda was not fully satisfied with this answer at all, as it seemed to her that her mother was neglecting the job she already had, which was in being a mother to her only daughter. And it seemed now it was only a matter of time before she also would be leaving her all alone. Amanda sighed as she turned away from the family photograph before her tears could come. Well, she thought to herself bitterly, if they both don't care about me then I won't care about them either. And I will leave her before she leaves me. She scooted slowly off of the couch and went to the closet where she got her blue hooded jacket. She put it on, tying the hood on, and then walked slowly towards the kitchen where her mother was busily talking on the phone with someone. \"Mom?\" she said weakly. Her mother did not answer, or even seemed to hear her. \"I am leaving you now,\" she continued. And again there was no answer or any motion of acknowledgment from her mother at all. Amanda grimaced as she turned rapidly on her heel and rushed back out. She opened the front door and hurried outside. She found her bicycle that was parked near the garage and hopped onto it and sped away down the sidewalk to where she didn't know or much care where she went. It was at this same time on the other side of the neighborhood that Andrew Kensley had just arrived back to his house along with his parents, and aunts and uncles and cousins, and a dozen friends of theirs. They had all just arrived back from the funeral of his just recently departed grandmother on his mother's side, and she had been the last of his grandparents to depart from this world. As he and everyone entered into the house it became very crowded and very noisy with a dozen conversations between just about everyone there. Everyone seemed to be talking all at once. He could only catch a few words being spoken by a few of them. \"She has finally gone now,\" said his Uncle Chester to his Aunt Nell. \"It's just unimaginable. She was so full of life all the time. I always thought she would live to be a hundred years old, or more than that.\" \"So did I,\" replied his aunt sadly. \"So did I. But there comes a time for all of us when we must depart. And she is at least in a much better place right now.\" \"As I've heard, she has left half of her savings to me and you,\" he heard his father say to his mother. \"And also her valued china sets and her collection of books and her priceless knick-knacks, and candles and...\" Andrew was confused by a lot of the things he heard everyone talking about, and not just about who his grandmother had left some of her belongings to, but mostly about how she could possibly be in a much better place right now and still be gone from them as they were all saying. After all, wasn't this place they had right here and now the best place for her, like he remembered she had always said to everyone she would rather be here with them than in any other place. He then found himself remembering the last time he had seen his grandmother, it was two weeks before she had died, and she just played checkers with him as they liked to do and then she had said to him, \"You are very wise in your head, Andrew, and not just when it comes to games like this. I believe you can obtain the wisdom of all of the world if you just desired to do so, and that you are also very pure in heart and remember that it is the heart that always leads us home.\" Andrew had not completely been sure he understood what she had meant by all of this. So he had just smiled and nodded to her. And then he and his parents had left her house, not knowing it would be the last time they would see her there. As he looked around at everyone, all the faces and the voices of them became a blur. They all seemed to be so interested in only each others words that they didn't even notice he was right in the middle of them. The more this went on the more he felt like he just wanted to shout out loud enough to be heard above everyone else, but then he realized they would not like it if he did so. And so he decided he would just leave them to themselves and not bother them. He crept quietly to the front door and turned the doorknob slowly and silently, and then crept outside. He went to the old shed by the house and got out his bicycle, hopped onto it, and then sped away on it down the sidewalk. Amanda was speeding down the sidewalk on her own bike and her heart was so heavy inside her that it was a wonder why she could peddle so fast, and her mind was very cloudy also as she was trying to think about where she could go, or who she could go to, and what she could do there. But her mind kept coming up as a blank. Andrew was at this same time thinking all of these same things with a very heavy heart also. And he was so preoccupied in his own thoughts that he did not even notice there was another bicycle with a girl on it speeding right towards him from up the opposite end of the sidewalk. And she did not even notice him coming up to her either, and so before either of them had known what was happening, there was a hard collision of wheels and handlebars against each other and they both came clattering down onto the solid concrete right along with their bikes. Andrew got up slowly and shook his head, much dazed and confused by what had just happened. He looked over and saw the girl getting up slowly, and her face was very red and her hair was a mess. \"Hey, watch where you're going!\" she exclaimed. \"I'm sorry,\" he said weakly. \"I didn't see you there. My name is Andrew Kensley, by the way.\" \"My name is Amanda McNicolson,\" she replied as she stood up and picked up her bicycle. \"Where are you going?\" \"I don't know,\" he said with a shrug. \"I just want to go someplace far away from here, to a much beter place. And where are you going?\" \"I don't know, and I don't care, either,\" she replied. \"I just want to get away from here and from everyone around here.\" \"Why?\" asked Andrew. \"Because it seems no one wants me around here anymore,\" she replied hotly. \"No one even notices I'm here anymore either.\" \"It's been the same way with me,\" said Andrew. \"So you're running away,\" he continued thoughtfully. \"Yes, so?\" she replied. \"So,\" he replied, \"I guess I am running away too. And so since neither of us have any idea of where to go, maybe we should join each other along the way. You know, just to help each other get by, at least for a while?\" \"You want me to come with you?\" she asked skeptically. \"This had better not be a joke.\" \"No, it isn't,\" he assured her. \"I really am leaving this neighborhood, this city, this state, and maybe evn this country and world even. I just want to go to a place where I will be understood and accepted, and where I can understand everyone also.\" \"Me too,\" said Amanda. \"So, okay. You seem like an okay guy anyway. So let's get out of here.\" And so saying they each hopped back onto their bikes and sped away down the sidewalk once again by each others sides. A few hours went by, and the sky overhead began to become overcast with very gray clouds, and the wind began to pick up steadily and then it started to become fierce. Then a low rumble of thunder was heard overhead and then a few small droplets of rain began to fall down. Andrew and Amanda did not much care about the rain at first when it was rather light, but then as it began to come down harder and harder and then all of sudden it started to really pour and plummet down onto then and they started to become soaked and the sidewalk beneath them began to become rather slippery. \"We've got to find some place to go in for shelter from this storm soon!\" Andrew exclaimed to Amanda above the roaring thunder. Amanda needed to hear no other encouragement, and she looked around frantically and then she spotted a building far away to the left of them across the road. \"Quick! Let's go there!\" she exclaimed to Andrew. So they picked up the speed on their bikes and rushed towards the building. As they neared it they saw it was an enormous library with stone pillars and large stone lions on either side. The two children went up to the side of the library and leaped off of their bikes and left them leaning against the pillars as they hurried up the stone steps of the building and rushed through the doors. Once inside of the warm and dry atmosphere of the library they both exhaled heavily with relief to be inside and away from the rain and lightning. Then as they looked around they saw tall shelves of rows upon rows of books, more than they had ever seen before, and more it seemed than they would be able to read in a lifetime. They moved forward a short ways, and then they spotted a large wooden desk behind which they saw a tall and thin man with graying hair sticking out at either side of his head and wearing a dark brown vest and a matching bow-tie. He looked up from his seat and seemed to be delighted when he spotted them. \"Hello, my young friends,\" he said amicably as he stepped out from behind his desk to greet them. \"I am very pleased to see you. What might I do for you two?\" \"Thank you,\" said Amanda, \"we just want...\" \"Wait! Now don't tell me, let me guess. I have a talent for guessing what people need!\" the librarian interrupted excitedly. \"What you want... what you need... is... adventure... and excitement... and the means to gain knowledge, and wisdom, and to learn about life in general! Yes, what you need is... Fantasy!\" \"You don't understand,\" said Andrew. \"We just came to...\" \"Now, if you please, come with me you two,\" the librarian continued anxiously as he led them down an aisle of books. He stopped at the end of the aisle and took out two medium sized blue books, then he turned around and picked out three more books, one green, one orange, and one red from the bottom shelf. Then he stood up and he handed the first two books to Amanda and then the next three to Andrew. \"There you are,\" he said with satisfaction. \"Now, I will lead you to where you may sit and read and rest until you are ready to leave here.\" They followed the librarian to an open space in between the aisles of book where there was a long table and two small sofas where they could read comfortably. Then he turned around and he left them alone. Amanda sat down and looked at the two books she had been given. They were Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, and Through the Looking Glass by Lewis Carroll. Then Andrew sat down beside her and looked at the three books he had been given. They were The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, The Marvelous Land of Oz , and The Lost Princess of Oz by L. Frank Baum. \"Well, what do we do now?\" Amanda asked Andrew. \"Well, I guess we should just read these, until the storm has passed,\" said Andrew with a shrug. And so they each opened a book... and then... something very strange happened...[Chapter 2] No sooner had either of them opened up their books and looked at the words on the pages, than did the pages begin to glow a very brilliant shade of white, so bright was it they blinked and rubbed their eyes at it. And then they began to hear what sounded like far off distant musical notes and chimes, and these seemed to be coming directly through the lights in the books. And then, all of a sudden, they could feel themselves moving suddenly forward, and into the light. They then heard a low, whispering voice say to them, \" Come in... Come into the pages... Come into your most wondrous fantasies and adventures... Come in.\" Then before they had time to wonder who had spoken to them, they both suddenly felt themselves being lifted up in the air as the light before them grew and expanded and then seemed to be reaching outward to them. Then it suddenly was surrounding them everywhere, and then they felt themselves taking a sudden deep plunge forward into the light. Then an amazing vortex opened up within the light and they began plummeting forward through it. As they went, they saw many brilliant colors flashing in and out at them like a dazzling rainbow that was in the shape of a pentagon, growing out and then flying out at them. And so fast and bright was it that it really was a wonder why they did not become blinded by it. \"What is happening, Andrew?\" exclaimed Amanda. \"I have no idea!\" exclaimed Andrew. \"It feels like we're going over the rainbow.\" \"It feels more like falling down a big hole to me,\" exclaimed Amanda. \"Well, whatever this is,\" said Andrew, \"I just hope we come out of it in one piece!\" Just then, they took a sudden dip downward into a spiral formed in the vortex they were in. The many colors around them became blended together in one huge flashing white light. Then they both lost sight of the other. Amanda found herself landing with a plop onto a large bed of flowers on top of a very green grassy hilltop somewhere. She sat up slowly and dazedly, shook her head and blinked to focus her vision, and then let out a little gasp at the sight of the new place she was now in. She found she was on a very big and beautiful landscape that was covered in the greenest grass she had ever seen, and also had the prettiest flowers she had ever seen. A little way off she could see a river flowing clear water along it, and on the bank of it she saw an older girl who was wearing a long old fashioned pink dress and holding a book up to her face. Amanda was considering going up to the older girl to ask her where she was, when she suddenly heard a soft little meow of a cat near beside her. She turned to her side and saw a very pretty white kitten with thick snowy white wavy fur and huge sky blue eyes that had a red bow tied around her neck. It looked up at her with much curiosity and she looked at it with the very same expression. Just then she heard the voice of a young girl call out, \"Dinah!\" She looked up and saw a small girl, who couldn't have been any older than herself, running towards her and the kitten. She had long flowing blonde hair that fell down her shoulders and back and bright blue eyes. She was wearing a short blue dress with a white apron over it and white stockings and black Mary-Jane shoes. She hurried up to them and crouched down beside the cat and scooped it up into her arms and cradled it as though it were a baby of hers. Then she looked with immense curiosity towards Amanda who was still sitting speechless in the flowerbed. Then the other girl smiled and made a neat little curtsy and in a voice with an accent that sounded more proper than Amanda had ever heard coming from other girls her age she said, \"Hello, my name is Alice Liddel, and this is my cat, Dinah. We are very pleased to meet you. What has brought you here?\" Amanda blinked in confusion and replied, \"That is what I would like to know also. Where exactly is... here?\" \"Why, this is the land of Oxford, in the country of England,\" replied Alice, sounding rather confused at Amanda's questioning. \"Where do you come from, might I ask? You have the most peculiar accent I have ever heard from anyone.\" \"I could actually say the same thing about you,\" said Amanda with a slight chuckle. \"I am from the land of America, in the country of the United States.\" \"Oh, I see!\" said Alice. \"That explains why you talk so funny. I've heard a lot about America in my lessons, but I'd never seen it, though I might like to someday. It does tend to get rather boring around here at times.\" \"Well,\" said Amanda, \"where I came from it's much worse actually. That is why I ran away from it.\" \"You ran away from your own home?\" Alice said sounding rather shocked. \"But why would you do such a thing? Won't your parents worry about you?\" \"No, I'm sure they won't,\" replied Amanda frowning. \"You see, they divorced.\" \"What does that word mean, 'divorced'?\" inquired Alice curiously. \"It means that they stopped being married to each and then they stopped living together,\" Amanda explained bitterly. \"And now they have both moved themselves away from me, too. So I had to leave them. What else could I have done? They don't want me anymore.\" Alice looked at her with great sympathy and concern. \"Oh, I see,\" she said softly. \"And I do suppose it is often difficult to understand the ways of the grown up people wherever one may live. I myself often have the same problem with my parents. And my sister, too, who is almost a grown-up. That is her over there by the riverbank. She likes to read book that have no pictures, or even any conversations in them. I could never understand the use of reading such boring books.\" Amanda was just about to reply, when all of sudden she spotted something out of the corner of her right eye. She looked, and then did a double take, and then saw it was a small rabbit with white fur and pink eyes, and it was walking upright and dressed in neat and fancy clothes. Then she saw it take a golden watch out from its waistcoat pocket. \"Alice,\" Amanda whispered to her new friend. \"Look! It's a rabbit!\" \"What is so unusual about that?\" asked Alice. \"It's wearing clothes and it has a watch!\" exclaimed Amanda in astonishment. \"Oh! Well, that really is something that is quite unusual!\" exclaimed Alice. Just then the white rabbit's pink eyes grew very wide as it looked at its watch and it exclaimed in much horror, \"Oh, my ears and whiskers! I shall be too late!\" The rabbit then bounded away down the lane in a great hurry. Then Alice set Dinah down on the ground and rushed after the rabbit. Amanda then hurried after her. \"Alice, wait a minute!\" she exclaimed after her. \"You shouldn't go after the rabbit! We don't know where he came from! And he might not want us to follow him!\" But either Alice did not hear her being too far ahead, or just didn't heed her warnings. She ran onward with Amanda running after her. Then they both came to an abrupt stop when they saw the rabbit dash into a hole at the bottom of a hill. \"Well, that is the last we'll see of him, I guess,\" said Amanda with a shrug. However, just as she spoke, Alice bent down on all fours beside the hole and began to crawl into the hole that the rabbit had gone into. \"Alice! What in the world are you doing now!\" Amanda exclaimed in horror. Just then Alice vanished into the hole, then Amanda heard a short cry of surprise from Alice and then rushed up to the hole and peered inside, just in time to see the last of Alice falling away down into the deep hole. Amanda paused a moment and thought about what she should do. She remembered all the warnings she had been given about going into deep, dark places like holes, and also about going after things she didn't understand. But then at the same time she knew she couldn't let Alice go down all alone. And so with a deep breath she bent down and crawled into the hole and then soon found herself falling down a long deep tunnel. She went down, down, and down. Farther and farther. And just when she was beginning to wonder when the fall would end or if she would ever meet with Alice again, she suddenly saw Alice falling down alongside her. \"Well,\" said Alice in bemusement. \"After this I shall think nothing of falling downstairs! And how brave they'll all think of me at home, and you, too!\" she added when she saw Amanda. \"If we ever do get back up again, you mean,\" said Amanda. \"What if we fall right through the center of the Earth?\" \"Then I guess we'll meet with the people who walk upside down on their heads called the Antipathies in New Zealand... or is that Australia?\" asked Alice. Amanda started to reply, but just then they both suddenly landed with a soft thump onto a mound of dry leaves and grass at the end of their fall. They both looked up and were just in time to see the white rabbit hurrying down a long tunnel. Alice was the first to get up and she hurried after him as fast as she could. Then, with a sigh of exasperation, Amanda ran after Alice as fast as she could. The two girls ran down a long corridor that began to look more and more like the inside of an enormous mansion the farther they went through it. They then entered into a long hallway and watched just as the rabbit dashed through a very small doorway and closed the door behind him. They stopped in the hallway and paused to catch their breaths a moment and then Amanda looked towards Alice and said, \"Well, what do you think we should do now?\" \"Well,\" said Alice thoughtfully, \"I don't suppose either of us will ever be able to fit through that tiny door if we tried to. I just wish there was a way we could get through it.\" Alice then bent down and tried to open the little door unsuccessfully, finding it to be locked shut. \"Oh dear!\" Alice sighed, sounding on the brink of tears. \"Now how she will ever get out of here?\" \"Look,\" said Amanda. \"This must be the key to the door.\" She gestured to a small table behind them made of solid glass that had a little golden key on it. Alice then took the key, bent down and opened the little door with it, and poked her head through it. \"Oh my!\" she gasped softly in awe at what she was seeing. \"Look out there!\" Amanda then bent down next to Alice and she moved aside so that she saw what she saw. It was a most enormous and just as beautiful garden with grass greener than she had ever seen, and the biggest, brightest flowers everywhere, and fountains that were spraying cool water into the air. \"Oh, I do wish we could get into this lovely garden,\" sighed Alice, \"and run through those flowers and between those cool fountains. Don't you?\" \"Oh yes,\" said Amanda. \"But, like you said before, there is no way we could possibly fit through this tiny door at all.\" \"Oh, I do wish there was a way we could shrink ourselves down like a telescope,\" said Alice. They then stood back up and turned around towards the glass table again, and this time they saw to their surprise a tiny little glass bottle full of a clear liquid with a tag tied around the cork that read, 'Drink Me'. \"Hey, was that here before?\" asked Amanda in awe and wonder. \"I don't think so,\" said Alice thoughtfully. \"But it says to drink it... and it doesn't say poison anywhere on it,\" she added after looking it over carefully, \"so I suppose we should and find out what happens to us next.\" Alice then opened the bottle and took a short sip from it. \"Why, it's delicious!\" she said to Amanda. \"Just try it.\" So then Amanda took a short sip from it as well, and found it was very tasty also. She then handed it back to Alice who took another sip from it, and then handed it again to her to take another sip. They did this a few more times until the bottle was quite empty of its contents. \"Well, is anything happening now?\" asked Amanda. \"Not that I can tell,\" replied Alice. \"Maybe it takes a little time to take effect and... Oh wait! I think I feel something strange coming over me!\" \"I do too!\" exclaimed Amanda. And just then they both could feel themselves shrinking downward, as the ceiling grew farther away and the floor came up closer towards them. It was a rather frightening experience for them both, but then it stopped almost as soon as it had began. \"Have we stopped shrinking yet?\" asked Amanda. \"Why, I believe so,\" replied Alice. \"And look now at us! We're exactly the right size to fit through this door! Come on, let's go!\" \"Wait for me!\" called out Amanda. And then together they dashed through the open door.[Chapter 3] Andrew found himself landing with a plop on a large mound of thick hay. He sat up slowly and dizzily, rubbed his eyes and blinked to focus his vision and then looked around at his surroundings. He saw an enormous expanse of a dry prairie all around on every side. The sky overhead was very overcast with thick gray clouds which seemed only to complete the dullness of the scenery. He looked over behind him at the left side and could see a very small house that was as gray and dull as everything else around here. Then all of a sudden, he heard the 'moo' of a large cow near him and then he suddenly felt the pile of hay he was on top of move and quiver. He looked back around and met with the eyes and nose of a big white and brown spotted cow as it was taking a mouthful of the hay. It then suddenly nudged at him as it took another bite, and he found himself slipping and then sliding down off of the hay bale and landing onto the dusty ground with a thump. He stood up, dusting himself off, and then he suddenly heard the distinct barking of a small dog coming towards him. A few moments later he saw a very small dog run up to him excitedly. It had thick and shiny black fur and pointed ears, it looked to be a Scottish or Cairn terrier. He bent down to pet the little dog. \"Hey boy,\" he said. \"Where did you come from?\" The little dog barked in reply. Then he suddenly heard the voice of a young girl call out, \"Toto! Toto, where did you go!\" He waited a few moments and then from around the corner came a stocky little girl of about his age. She had long brown braided hair and was wearing a faded blue and white checked gingham dress. When the little dog saw her he yipped and yelped excitedly and she bent down and caught him as he leaped up into her arms and licked her face affectionately. \"There you are, Toto,\" she said. She then noticed Andrew and said, \"Oh, hello there. Who are you, and what has brought you here?\" \"My name is Andrew Kensley,\" he replied with uncertainty. \"And I don't know how I got here, or even where I am right now.\" \"I'm Dorothy Gale,\" she replied, \"and you're in Kansas here on the prairie of my Aunt Em and Uncle Henry's farm.\" \"Well,\" he said as he looked around again, \"there doesn't seem that much to see around here. Everything is so... gray.\" \"Yes, I know,\" said Dorothy with a sigh. \"It's always been this way. My Uncle Henry and Aunt Em don't much care for it, either. Uncle Henry says the prairie winds have taken a lot of the joy of living out of him and Aunt Em. Aunt Em says when she first came here she had been as pretty as a picture and that now she looks as gray and careworn as she feels.\" \"It sounds like you all must live a really hard life out here,\" said Andrew. \"Yes, we do,\" replied Dorothy frankly. \"We all struggle often to make ends meet, and I'm sure if the crops aren't better this year than they were last, Uncle Henry can't afford it. But then,\" she added, \"we all still have each other and that is what keeps our hearts and our brains going strong, as Uncle Henry and Aunt Em say. And I also have Toto, and we play with each other and he keeps me company all the time. I don't know what I ever would do without him here with me.\" She then nuzzled her little dog close to her and he licked her cheek again as though he understood exactly what she had said. \"Well, it's good you all appreciate each other,\" Andrew said. \"My family doesn't even notice I'm around. No one, except my grandma ever did, and now she is gone. So I decided to leave my home to live somewhere else far away from them... though this wasn't what I had in mind.\" \"I can't imagine ever even thinking of leaving here,\" said Dorothy with much certainty. \"And certainly at least not without my Aunt Em and Uncle Henry and Toto with me. Even if there are much better places out there.\" Andrew was about to reply, when suddenly there came a low whistling of wind from the North, and then a came a fierce gust of wind from the South. Then dust and old leaves and loose hay began blowing all around them. \"Now what is happening?\" asked Andrew fearfully. \"I'd hate to say it,\" replied Dorothy, \"but I think it's...\" She got no further as just then the wind picked up even more. Then they saw an elderly man with a gray beard, who was Dorothy's Uncle Henry running up towards the house very frantically. \"There's a cyclone coming!\" he called out anxiously. \"All head toward the cellar!\" Then Toto gave a yelp of terror and leaped out of Dorothy's arms and ran towards the house, barking all the while. Dorothy at once hurried after him and Andrew rushed after Dorothy. The wind picked up even stronger than ever before as Andrew reached the farmhouse and saw Dorothy running up to get Toto who had dashed under her bed in his fear. He saw her Aunt Em and Uncle Henry opening the cellar door in the floor and begin climbing down the ladder. \"Dorothy, hurry!\" called out Aunt Em. Andrew and Dorothy both hurried toward the cellar, when then all of a sudden they both felt a heavy jolting against the house alongside a great roar of the wind, and they both were knocked down onto the floor quite suddenly. Then, before they could get up again, they suddenly felt the house shake and then lifting up from the ground as though it were being picked up in a giant hand. \"Dorothy!\" they heard the voices of Aunt Em and Uncle Henry calling out from below them. The house seemed to be rising higher and higher up into the air until it stopped at what must have been the very top of the cyclone. The house continued to rock back and forth steadily like a boat on rough seas. Toto barked and yipped excitedly as he ran around frantically everywhere in the one-room house. Suddenly he got too close to the open cellar door and fell through it. \"Toto! No!\" wailed Dorothy. \"Now, I've lost him!\" \"No, wait! Look!\" exclaimed Andrew as he peered over the edge of the cellar door. \"He's floating up here in the center of the cyclone.\" And so then Dorothy and Andrew both reached down as far as they could through the door and each caught Toto by an ear and pulled him up and back into the house. Then Dorothy quickly closed the door to keep any more accidents from happening. Then she sat huddled in a corner and trembling as much as the house was in fear and trepidation and holding Toto so tightly. \"Are you all right, Dorothy,\" asked Andrew with concern. \"No, I don't think I am,\" she replied. \"This cyclone is taking us far away to who knows where, and who knows what will happen to us when we land. They waited a while longer, and then suddenly they felt themselves falling with the house downward, further and further. \"This is it!\" exclaimed Andrew. Then Dorothy impulsively threw her arms around him and clung tightly to him as they waited with bated breath for the end. Then they heard a heavy thumping, and at the same time they felt another great jolting of the house as it touched the ground again and they were both once again knocked down backwards. They laid there on the floor breathing heavily for a few moments. Then Andrew said, \"I think we're all right now. We're still alive, anyway.\" \"I wonder where we are now,\" said Dorothy as she stood up slowly and gathered Toto in her arms again. Andrew followed her to the door and watched as she slowly, cautiously opened it, with bright sunlight filling the room as she did so. Then they both gave soft gasps of surprise at the scenery stretched out before them when they stepped outside. \"What is this place?\" asked Andrew unthinkingly. \"I... I don't know,\" replied Dorothy. \"But I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore now.\" \"So do I,\" agreed Andrew. All around them they saw luscious green hills with flowers of every kind and description decorating them, and trees dotting the landscape that bore ripe fruits that scented the air and had birds on their branches humming and twittering cheerily in their sweet voices. A little way off there was a long brook with the clearest of water imaginable flowing gracefully through it. \"Look!\" said Andrew, getting Dorothy's attention to what he saw. \"Some strange people are coming up to us.\" There were three very short elderly looking men, only as tall as they were, two had beards and they all were similarly dressed in blue clothing with dark blue boots and pointed hats with silver bells around them which jingled as they moved. With them there was a somewhat taller old woman wearing a pure white gown and a matching pointed hat. They were all looking at them with very happy and welcoming smiles. The old woman stepped forward and made a short curtsy as the three short men took off their hats and bowed. The she said, \"We welcome you to our land, most noble sorcerer and sorceress, and are very grateful to you for having killed the Wicked Witch of the East and thus setting the munchkins free from her bondage.\" Andrew and Dorothy looked puzzled at them. \"What are you talking about?\" asked Andrew. \"We haven't killed anything,\" added Dorothy. \"Your house did, anyway,\" replied the old woman, \"and that's the same thing. There you see, are her two feet sticking out from under it.\" They both looked and they saw two feet shod in silver shoes sticking out from under a corner of the house. \"Oh dear me!\" exclaimed Dorothy in horror. \"The house must have fallen on her!\" \"We're very sorry about that,\" added Andrew. \"We never meant for it to.\" \"Well, whether you did or not, what is done has been done,\" said the old woman smiling. \"And it was a very good thing to be done also, for she was the Wicked Witch of the East as I mentioned, and had been holding the Munchkins, the people who live in this land of the East, in slavery for many years, until now, thanks to the two of you.\" \"So these are Munchkins,\" said Dorothy looking at the three little men. \"And who are you, may I ask?\" \"I am a friend of theirs,\" she replied, \"I am Locasta, the Good Witch of the North, which is the Land of the Gilikins.\" Dorothy looked once again very confused. \"But I thought there were no more witches alive anymore.\" \"Where do you come from, might I ask?\" inquired Locasta. \"We came from Kansas,\" replied Dorothy. \"And where is that?\" asked the Good Witch. \"It's in the United States of America,\" replied Andrew. \"I see, that explains it then,\" said the Good Witch. \"For this is the Land of Oz here, and it is cut off from the rest of the world, and that is why there are still witches here, and wizards also.\" \"Oh,\" said Dorothy. \"Well, your country is very beautiful, indeed. But still I am most anxious to get back to Kansas where my Aunt Em and Uncle Henry live. Can you tell me how to get back, please?\" The Munchkins and the Good Witch all looked puzzled at each other. Then one of the Munckins said, \"I fear there may be no way out of Oz. For it is surrounded by a great desert which no one could live to go across. But you will both be most welcome to stay here and live amongst us.\" Dorothy at once burst into bitter tears at this. Andrew quickly put his arms around her. And the Good Witch quickly said, \"Wait, my dears, no need to fret! For there may still be a way to get you back to your home you call Kansas.\" \"How?\" asked Dorothy calming down. \"The only one who might know of how may be the Great Wizard of Oz himself,\" replied the Good Witch. \"He lives in the City of Emeralds, which can be found by following the Yellow Brick Road. And it is a hard journey to get there as the way is sometimes pleasant and also sometimes dark and dangerous. But I will give you all the protection you need. First I will give you both my kiss.\" And so saying, she stepped up to them and gently kissed both Dorothy and Andrew on their foreheads one after the other. \"No one can dare harm anyone who bears the kiss of the Good Witch of the North you see,\" she explained. \"And look,\" she added, pointing towards the house again where the feet of the Witch of the East used to be and now were gone, leaving behind the silver shoes. \"The sun has dissolved the remains of the Witch of the East,\" she explained. \"So now her silver shoes are yours to have and to wear if either of you desires. They are very powerful, hough I don't know what ways however.\" Dorothy went up to the shoes and picked them up and sat down on the ground, taking off her old worn-out brown leather shoes, and put on the silver ones in their place. And she found they fit her as if they had been made just for her. Andrew and Dorothy then went up to the Good Witch of the North and Andrew said, \"Thank you, Good Witch, for your help and instructions.\" \"My pleasure,\" she replied with another curtsy. \"Goodbye to you dears.\" And with that she twirled around on her heel and vanished from sight in the air.[Chapter 4] Alice and Amanda stepped through the little door and into the lovely garden. As soon as they did they heard the door close from behind them. Amanda glanced over her shoulder and was shocked to see no house, or even a door behind them but only the enormous roots of a tree. \"What are we going to do now?\" she automatically said half to herself and half to Alice. \"Why, we go explore these beautiful gardens of course!\" Alice exclaimed happily. So then Amanda followed Alice as they began walking through. She looked around at their surroundings and saw long and thick stalks of grass all around them that were all at least three times their size, and here and there were spotted mushrooms that were mostly the size of small houses. A few times she found herself nearly stumbling over the thinly hidden roots of trees that were scattered around them, but were way too high up for them to really notice. After a short while of walking in these peculiar conditions she finally said to Alice, \"You know, I really would like it much better in here if we were only our regular sizes again.\" Alice sighed and replied, \"And so would I, I'm afraid. I also wish I knew where that White Rabbit had gone to.\" Amanda was about to reply that she didn't see what the point of knowing where the White Rabbit had gone was, when she suddenly heard a high voice speak to them. \"He just hopped down the lane ten minutes ago!\" Amanda blinked in surprise as did Alice and they both looked all around them to see where the voice had come from. But all around them all they could see were giant sized flowers standing still between the grass blades. Just then they heard another more squeaky voice add, \"And he went across the lawn five minutes ago, too!\" This time the two girls turned their heads quickly towards the sound of the voice, but still could see no one else with them, other than a large clump of giant daises planted nearby. Alice then squinted at the daisies near them and took a step closer toward them. \"Pardon us, did any of you just speak?\" she asked very cautiously. Amanda frowned and said, \"Alice, you're being ridiculous. Flowers can't talk you know.\" \"But of course we can talk!\" said a high and soft voice which belonged to a giant red rose above them. \"If there's anyone worth talking to,\" added a great tiger-lily next to the rose. \"Or about!\" added several daisies in unison. Amanda stood frozen still with her mouth agape, and Alice also looked as though her breath had been snatched from her. They remained silent like this for a time just looking at the flowers with their petals swaying slightly in the breeze. Then at last Alice spoke in a timid whisper, \"As well as you can,\" said the Tiger-Lily, \"and a great deal louder. \"Why did you not speak from the beginning?\" asked Amanda. \"It isn't manners for us to begin, you know,\" said the Rose, \"and I really was wondering when either of you would speak! Said I to myself, their faces have got some sense in them, though they aren't very clever ones. Still you have the right colors, and that goes a long way.\" \"I don't care about their colors,\" the Tiger-Lily remarked, \"Though if only their petals curled up a little more they would be all right.\" Alice frowned at being criticized like this while Amanda exclaimed, \"But we aren't flowers like you are!\" \"Then you're weeds!\" exclaimed a dozen of the daisies all together. \"No, we're not!\" Alice replied indignantly. \"We're both little girls!\" \"Is that a flower?\" asked one of the daisies. \"No,\" said Amanda. \"They're weeds! They're weeds, weeds, weeds, weeds!\" all of the daisies began shouting gaily together till the air seemed to be full of their shrill little voices. \"Silence, every one of you!\" cried the Tiger-Lily, waving itself passionately from side to side, and trembling with excitement. The daisies though went on and on with themselves. \"They know I can't get at them,\" the Tiger-Lily sighed panting and bending its quivering head toward Alice and Amanda, \"or they wouldn't dare to do it!\" \"Never mind,\" Alice said in a soothing tone. Then Amanda, her ears burning from the daisies noisiness and her cheeks burning with fury, bent down next to the daisies, and said heatedly, \"If you don't shut up this instant, Alice and I will pick each one of you!\" Then all of the daisies fell instantly silent, and their pink petals turned to white. \"That's right!\" said the Tiger-Lily. \"The daisies are worst of all. When one speaks, they all begin together, and its enough to make one wither to hear the way they go on!\" \"How is it you all can talk so well?\" Alice said trying to lighten their mood. \"I've been in many gardens before, but none of the flowers could talk.\" \"Feel of the ground,\"said the Tiger-Lily, \"it is very hard, and that is why. In most gardens, they make the beds too soft – so that the flowers are always asleep.\" \"That really makes sense,\" said Amanda. \"Though how you are all able to grow up and out of the hard ground is something I've always wondered about myself.\" \"How we grow out of our seeds is all a matter of simple confidence,\" replied the Rose. \"We just let the rains waters and the sun's beams nourish our roots and then we do the rest all ourselves.\" \"Oh, I see,\" said Amanda. \"You all must be very strong creatures to do that. But don't you ever get frightened of being out here all alone without anyone to protect you?\" \"No, really,\" replied the Rose, \"I myself never have to fear of anyone coming to close to me as I am very prickly you know.\" \"And we have the tree up there with it's bark that protects us all,\" added the Tiger-Lily. \"What could it do?\" asked Alice in confusion. \"It could bark, of course!\" replied the Tiger-Lily. \"That is why it has branches called boughs. It says 'Bough-Wough!', didn't you know that?\" \"I never thought of that,\" said Alice. \"It's my opinion that you never think at all!\" said the Rose in a rather severe tone. \"Are there any other things around here who can also speak?\" Alice inquired, choosing to ignore the Rose's previous statement. \"The only ones who can that we have seen are the insects,\" replied the Rose. \"There's the rocking-horse-fly, the snap-dragon-fly, and the bread-and butter-flies... Oh, and of course there is that old caterpillar who sits on the mushrooms day after day all the day long, and smoking his hookah.\" \"I think I'd like to meet this caterpillar,\" said Amanda. \"So would I,\" agreed Alice. \"And, by the way, where did you say you saw the White Rabbit hop a while ago?\" \"He went down the West path five minutes ago!\" exclaimed a purple pansy. \"No, no! He went down the East path four minutes ago!\" exclaimed another pansy. The Rose sighed heavily and said, \"Those pansies always forget everything almost at once. They'd even forget their petals if they weren't so attached to them.\" Alice sighed as well and said, \"Well, never mind. We must be on our way now. It's been a pleasure talking to you all.\" So then Alice and Amanda turned and went on their way through the garden. They hadn't gone very far when they came across wisps of smoke in the air near them. Curiously, they followed the smoke in the direction it came from and the further they went the thicker it became. Then at last they came upon a large red and white spotted mushroom on which there was a blue caterpillar sitting on and smoking on a hookah. \"This must be the caterpillar that the flowers mentioned about,\" said Amanda to Alice. \"Yes, it must be,\" said Alice. \"I wonder if he might have seen where the White Rabbit went to.\" Amanda then followed behind Alice as she hurried up to the mushroom. Once they were at the edge of it they looked at the caterpillar sitting with its six arms folded on its slim body with its eyes half closed as it smoked on the hookah, and taking no notice of them at all. Then suddenly Amanda coughed audibly from the thick smoke around them. And then the caterpillar's eyes popped open and he looked at the two girls curiously. Then he took the hookah out of his mouth and said in a soft and sleepy sounding voice, \"Who are you?\" \"I'm Amanda McNicolson,\" replied Amanda. \"And I'm Alice Liddel,\"said Alice, \"at least I was when I woke up this morning.. and yet I seem to have changed since then.\" \"Why?\" asked the Caterpillar slowly. \"Well, changing from one size to another in one day is very confusing,\" explained Alice. \"It isn't,\" said the Caterpillar. \"Well, maybe you don't think so now,\" said Alice, \"but when you someday turn into a cocoon, and then into a butterfly, you'll feel a little strange then, won't you?\" \"Not a bit,\" replied the Caterpillar very calmly. \"That is something I have always wondered about,\" said Amanda thoughtfully. \"I mean, how do you caterpillars always change so easily into cocoons, and then into butterflies?\" \"We just will ourselves into transforming into our desire to be born anew as a butterfly or a moth, whichever we desire to be,\" replied the Caterpillar before taking a long drag on its hookah again. \"And then all the rest is done by the magic of nature.\" \"Oh, I see,\" said Amanda. She then coughed again and tried to clear away some of the smoke. \"And, don't you know that smoking is bad for your health?\" she inquired. The Caterpillar simply shook his head to this, and then continued to smoke away at the hookah. Alice then coughed herself and said to Amanda, \"Let us go now, we may find better advice elsewhere from here.\" They then started to turn around to leave when the Caterpillar exclaimed, \"Wait! I have something very important to tell you!\" So they turned around and looked at him questioningly. \"What is it?\" asked Alice a bit impatiently. The Caterpillar took a long slow drag on his hookah again and then said slowly and evenly, \"So you think you've changed, do you? What do you want to be?\" \"Well, we would both like to a be a little larger, you see,\" said Amanda. \"Why?\" asked the Caterpillar. \"Well, being only three inches high is such a wretched height to be, don't you see?\" Alice replied hastily. \"It is a very good height indeed! I am exactly three inches!\" the Caterpillar snapped angrily at them as it stood up as straight as it could on the mushroom to show its full height. \"But we're not used to it!\" Alice and Amanda cried out in unison. The Caterpillar settled itself down slowly again onto the mushroom and said, \"You'll get used to it in time.\" He then took a drag on his hookah once again. Then after a long moment he spoke again as he let the smoke out of his mouth, \"One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you grow shorter.\" \"One side of what?\" asked Alice in confusion. \"The other side of what?\" asked Amanda, equally confused. \"Of the mushroom,\" replied the Caterpillar simply. Then he slithered down from the mushroom and began crawling away. They watched the Caterpillar go for a moment, and then they each took a large chunk out of either side of the mushroom. Alice took from the left, Amanda took from the right. \"And now which is which?\" Alice said as she looked at the pieces in great confusion and dismay. \"Well...\" said Amanda thoughtfully, \"I know left usually comes before right and so that should mean that the left piece will make us taller, and the right piece should make us shorter. I hope that's how it goes at least.\" \"Well, we never know until we try it out, I suppose,\" Alice said logically. So then Alice broke off a piece from her chunk of the mushroom and handed it to Amanda. They then both bit into it at the same time. Then all at once they felt their stomachs lurch as they instantly saw the mushroom and the grass around it falling away from them almost faster than they could blink. Then as soon as their growing had started it abruptly stopped and they were once again their regular heights. \"There, that's much better now,\" said Alice with much satisfaction. \"Yeah,\" said Amanda. \"But where do we go now?\" They then suddenly heard a new voice coming from behind them speak, \"That depends a good deal on where you want to get to.\" \"I don't much care where -\" Alice began to say while looking at Amanda. She then blinked and turned around swiftly as did Amanda and they both saw to their amazement, a large purple and white striped cat curled up on a tree branch in front of them. It's eyes were big, round, and yellow, and it was grinning at them in a most unusual way for most other cats. \"Then it doesn't matter which way you go,\" said the cat. \"So long as we get somewhere,\" Alice added as an explanation. \"Oh, you're sure to do that,\" said the Cat, \"if you only walk long enough.\" \"Why are you grinning at us like that?\" asked Amanda feeling rather ill at ease. \"I am a Chesire Cat,\" replied the Cat. \"I didn't know Chesire Cats could grin,\" said Amanda. \"Well, you don't know much,\" said the Cat, grinning wider than ever before. \"Chesire Puss,\" Alice said quickly changing the subject, \"Can you tell us what sort of people live around here?\" \"It that direction,\" the Cat said, waving its right paw, \"lives a Hatter, and in that direction,\" it added waving the left paw, \"lives a March Hare. Visit either you like. They're both mad, by the way.\" \"But we don't want to go among mad people!\" Alice exclaimed. \"Oh, you can't help that, said the Cat. \"We're all mad here. I'm mad. You're mad.\" \"How do you know we're mad?\" asked Amanda. \"You must be,\" said the Cat, \"or you wouldn't have come here.\" Then quite suddenly the Chesire Cat began to vanish from sight, bit by bit. First its tail was gone, then its body, then its paws, then its ears, then its head, then only its grin was left which lingered there for a moment before also vanishing from sight. \"I've often seen a cat without a grin,\" Alice remarked in amazement. \"But a grin without a cat! It's the most curious thing I've ever seen in all my life!\" \"Yeah, me too,\" agreed Amanda. \"So who should we go see?\" \"Well,\" Alice said thoughtfully. \"Since it is May perhaps the March Hare won't be raving mad. So let's go to see him first.\"[Chapter 5] Andrew and Dorothy had made preparations for their long journey to the Emerald City. They had packed a basket full of bread and fruits and then started off down the Yellow Brick Road. They passed by many houses in the Munchkin villages, and many of the Munchkins who lived in them would wave and smile to them from their windows, or come outside of their doors and watch them as they walked by. The further they went on the fewer the houses became until they only came by a few farmhouses now and then. After they had gone on for several miles or so, Andrew said to Dorothy, \"We've been walking almost all day long and I'm tired now. Can't we stop to rest for a while?\" \"I suppose we could,\" said Dorothy wearily. \"I'm tired out myself.\" So then they stopped by the very next farmhouse they came to at which they found a low fence around a great cornfield. They each sat down on the fence in front of the cornfield, and in the very center of it amidst the golden corn husks was a scarecrow stuck on a long pole. It was dressed in worn and faded blue clothes that they had found on most of the Munchkins around with bits of straw sticking out of them in places. Its head was a round cloth sack with a face painted onto it. Dorothy leaned her hand on her chin and gazed thoughtfully at the Scarecrow. Andrew took notice of this and said, \"Why are you interested that guy up there for? He's just a stuffed dummy, isn't he?\" \"I know,\" said Dorothy. \"But there's something about him I kind of like. I mean, he does look much nicer than any of the scarecrows I've seen before from where I come from.\" Andrew was about to reply that this was the only scarecrow he had ever seen, when all of a sudden he heard a rather husky sounding voice say, \"Thank you,\" which quite startled him and Dorothy also. They both sat upright and looked all around them but could see no other person around them anywhere. In fact, the only one nearest to them was the scarecrow. Andrew and Dorothy looked back at the scarecrow and stared at it questioningly for a moment. Then they suddenly saw one of its slowly wink at them, and then they both could have sworn they saw the ends of its painted mouth curve upward in a slightly brighter smile. Dorothy gasped softly and said to Andrew, \"This scarecrow seems... to be alive somehow.\" Just then the scarecrow nodded its head to them and then said, \"Why, yes, I suppose I am. I'm pleased to meet you both. How do you do?\" Dorothy looked a bit spooked for a moment, and then she slowly began to smile as she slid off of the bench and stepped into the cornfield, followed by Andrew shortly afterward, and replied, \"We're pretty well, thank you. How do you do?\" \"I'm not feeling well,\" replied the Scarecrow rather sadly, \"for it is very tedious being perched up here night and day to scare away crows.\" \"Can't you get down?\" asked Dorothy. \"No, for this pole is stuck up my back,\" the Scarecrow replied, \"if you will please take away the pole I shall be greatly obliged to you.\" So Dorothy and Andrew came up to the Scarecrow in the center of the cornfield, and Dorothy reached up both her arms as far as she could and picked the Scarecrow off of the pole gently and then carefully set him down on the ground beside of them. \"Thank you very much,\" the Scarecrow said to them when he had been set down. \"I feel like a new man!\" \"You're welcome,\" said Dorothy smiling. \"I guess it had to have been a real pain to have that old pole up your back all the time, wasn't it?\" said Andrew. \"Yes, it was,\" said the Scarecrow. \"And I know of no other worse pain, or I could tell you of it.\" Then Andrew looked as if he suddenly realized something. \"But won't the farmer who lives here be upset that we took you down from where he put you?\" \"No, I doubt it, really,\" replied the Scarecrow somberly. \"For I was never of much use to him anyway.\" \"What do you mean?\" asked Dorothy. \"Isn't it your job to be on that pole to frighten away the crows who come to eat the corn around here that the farmer had planted?\" \"Well, yes, it is,\" replied the Scarecrow even more somberly. \"Then I'm afraid I don't understand what is wrong with you,\" said Dorothy. \"That's the whole problem,\" the Scarecrow said with a groan, \"neither do I. And I can never understand it either. You see I have no brains in my head, only straw.\" \"But how can that be?\" asked Andrew very puzzled. \"I thought everyone had a brain.\" \"Well, unfortunately, I do not,\" replied the Scarecrow. \"And that is why I cannot scare away any crows at all, and am no use for the farmer who made me to do so.\" \"Oh,\" said Dorothy. \"I'm awfully sorry for you.\" \"So am I,\" added Andrew. \"Maybe if you come along with us to the Emerald City the Wizard of Oz who lives there will give you some brains.\" \"We're on our way to see the Wizard now,\" added Dorothy, \"so he can help us get back home. I'm sure it would be just as easy for him to give you some brains. And if he doesn't, then you'll be no worse off than you are now, you know.\" \"That is quite true,\" agreed the Scarecrow. \"So I see I have nothing at all to lose in joining you. I will come with you, though I don't know how useful I will be on your journey as I am such a brainless fool after all.\" So then Dorothy and Andrew set off down the Yellow Brick Road once again with their new companion. Toto didn't seem to much like the Scarecrow at first as he kept sniffing around at the Scarecrow's feet and occasionally growling. \"Don't mind Toto,\" Dorothy said to their new friend. \"He never bites.\" \"Oh, I'm not afraid,\" replied the Scarecrow. \"He can't hurt the straw. Do let me carry that basket for you. I shall not mind it, for I can't get tired. I'll tell you a secret,\" he added as they walked along. \"There is only one thing in the world I am afraid of.\" \"What is that?\" asked Dorothy. \"The Munchkin farmer who made you?\" \"No,\" answered the Scarecrow. \"It's a lighted match.\" \"No one can blame you for being afraid of those,\" said Andrew. They walked on together for a while and they eventually entered into a dense forest. They stayed close together and walked on in silence, listening for any sounds that might be of a warning to them. Then all of a sudden they heard something that sounded like a creaking groan coming from somewhere near them. They all stopped short and stood stiff. Dorothy shivered a little and said, \"What was that?\" \"I have no idea,\" replied the Scarecrow. \"But we can go and find out.\" Just then they heard the same noise yet again. They started off in the direction they thought they heard it coming from. Soon they spotted something in-between the trees that seemed to be shining in the late afternoon sunlight. Andrew and Dorothy ran up to the place with the Scarecrow stumbling behind them, and then they all stopped short again at what they saw. One of the trees had been partly chopped through, and standing right beside it they saw a man made entirely of tin, standing perfectly still and motionless with an uplifted axe in his hands just as stiff as the rest of him. Dorothy gave a soft gasp and said, \"Why, it's a man made of tin! I have never seen such a thing before in my life!\" \"Maybe it's an old robot someone built to chop wood for them that broke down, or something,\" Andrew suggested thoughtfully. \"What in the world is a robot?\" inquired the Scarecrow curiously. Dorothy went up slowly to the man made of tin to get a closer look at him. As Andrew watched he could have sworn he saw the eyes of the tin man slowly move towards Dorothy and look at her in an almost imploring sort of way. Then Dorothy slowly reached up and lightly touched one of the tin cheeks, then drew back with a gasp of surprise. \"What is it?\" asked Andrew. \"His cheek... it's wet!\" Dorothy replied in astonishment. \"He's been crying.\" \"Then he's alive... just like the Scarecrow is!\" gasped Andrew in realization. Just then they heard another creaking groan coming from the man of tin. Dorothy turned back to him and asked timidly, \"Did you just speak?\" Then the tin man's jaws seemed to move just a few centimeters apart as he seemed to be struggling to speak. \"Yes, I did,\" he said in a very creaky and rusty voice. \"I've been groaning for more than a year, and no one has ever heard me before or come to help me.\" As he spoke they saw a very clear and fresh tear slide out from his left tin eyelids and trickle down his cheek. Dorothy promptly wiped away the tear and said, \"How can we help you?\" \"You could get an oilcan from my cottage in the glen and oil my joints,\" replied the Tin Man stuggling more than ever to speak clearly. So then without another moment, Dorothy and Andrew and the Scarecrow hurried into the glen in the woods where they found quaint little cottage. They entered it and found an oilcan on a shelf which they got and brought back to the Tin Man. Then without hesitation, Dorothy carefully applied a few drops of oil to his jaws so that after he had flexed them together for a moment he could speak much more clearly. \"Oh, thank you ever so much!\" he exclaimed in sheer gratitude. \"Now, if you please, oil my neck now.\" So then Dorothy oiled his neck, and as it was quite badly rusted the Scarecrow and Andrew moved it gently from side to side until the tin man could move it freely on his own. After this this they applied the oil to the joints in his arms, and then after they had moved them a bit the Tin Man was able to set down the axe he was holding. He gave a great sigh of relief. \"Oh, what a relief this feels to be able to put down my axe at last after having held it up for such a long time!\" he exclaimed. \"Now if you will please just oil the joints in my legs I shall be all right once more.\" So they did this, and after moving them back and forth for a bit the Tin Woodman was walking freely and moving all his joints with ease. He seemed to be a great deal happier now also. \"Oh thank you, thank you, thank you all!\" he said over and over again. \"I might have stood there forever if you hadn't come along!\" \"Well, what happened to you, anyway?\" asked Andrew. \"Well, about a year ago, I was chopping this tree right here,\" the Tin Woodman explained, indicating the partially chopped tree. \"When suddenly it began to rain, and right in the middle of a chop, I rusted solid, and had been that way ever since.\" \"Oh, I see,\" said the Scarecrow. \"But why didn't you think to run back to your cottage when it started to rain so you wouldn't be rusted?\" The Tin Woodman now looked extremely unhappy. \"I suppose I just didn't care anymore about what happened to me,\" he admitted miserably. \"You see, I have no heart inside of me. All I have is emptiness inside. So therefore I cannot care about anything. And it is such a dreadfully unhappy thing to know for a fact that one is without a heart to guide through life, you see.\" As he spoke great tears came to his eyes again and started to trickle down his cheeks. Dorothy at once went up to him and gave him a handkerchief which she took from her pocket and said, \"Don''t cry, you can come along with us to see the Wizard of Oz, and he'll be sure to give you heart.\" \"Yeah,\" said Andrew. \"We're on our way there now. Dorothy wants to ask the Wizard to send her home to Kansas, and our Scarecrow friend wants him to put a few brains in his head of straw.\" The Tin Woodman dried his eyes and smiled a little as he said, \"You all have such kind hearts, just like I wish I could have. So I shall come with you and hopefully get a heart when our journey is through.\" \"Come along,\" said the Scarecrow heartily. \"We'll be pleased to have your company.\" So then the Tin Woodman shouldered his axe, and they all set off down the Yellow Brick Road once again toward their destination. They walked through the forest as it grew darker and darker. When all around them they could see little light between the thick trees and they heard a low growl coming from somewhere off in the distance that suggested there were wild animals dwelling in these parts Dorothy and Andrew felt their hearts beat fast with fear as they stood by their companions. \"How long will it be before we are out of the forest?\" Dorothy asked the Tin Woodman. \"I really don't know,\" admitted the Tin Woodman. \"But we should not be afraid. For as long as I have my oilcan I feel safe, and the Scarecrow is safe as long as he has his straw in him. And you two have the mark of the Good Witch of the North's kiss on both of you and shall be safe from much harm with it.\" \"But what about Toto?\" asked Dorothy anxiously. \"What will protect him?\" \"He has us to protect him if he is in danger,\" the Tin Woodman assured her gently. Just as he spoke they heard a terrible come from behind a grove of trees before them. Then the next moment a great lion bounded out in front of them. Dorothy screamed a little and Andrew grabbed hold of her hand and pulled her with him behind a tree. They then watched as the lion with one swift blow of his left paw sent the Scarecrow spinning over and over to the edge of the road, and then he struck the Tin Woodman with his right paw with a loud clang as the Tin Woodman fell over by the side of the road. Then little Toto ran out in front of the great beast barking like mad and heedless of danger. The Lion began to open its mouth and bare its great teeth at the little dog. Then suddenly, before Andrew could stop her, Dorothy rushed out right in front of the lion and slapped his on his nose as hard as she could while she cried out, \"Don't you dare bite Toto! You ought to be ashamed of yourself, a big beast like you, thinking of biting a poor little dog!\" The Lion made a whimper like a hurt kitten and rubbed his nose. \"I didn't bite him,\" he sniveled. \"No, but you tried to,\" Dorothy retorted. \"You are nothing but a great big coward.\" \"I know, I've always known!\" the Lion wailed. \"But how can you be a coward?\" asked Andrew as he came out from behind the tree. \"You are a lion, and the lion is the known everywhere as the King of the Beasts, or so I've heard.\" \"I don't know, I just don't know,\" wailed the Lion. \"I suppose I must have been born that way. Whenever I've met anyone or anything I've always been so scared I could feel my heart pounding within me. But I just roar and frighten them all away from me, as it is all I know to do. If any of the other beasts in the forest ever tried to fight me I would just run away from them myself, but as sson as they hear me roar they all run away themselves and of course I let them go.\" \"But that isn't right. The King of Beasts shouldn't be a coward,\" said the Scarecrow. \"I know,\" said the Lion as he wiped away a tear from his eye with the tip of his tail. \"It is my great sorrow, and makes my life so unhappy.\" \"That's too bad,\" said the Tin Woodman sympathetically. \"I wish there were something we could do for you.\" \"Maybe there is!\" said the Scarecrow brightly. \"You could come along with us to the Emerald City to see the Wizard of Oz and he should be able to give you some courage. We're on our way now to get me some brains.\" \"And me a heart,\" added the Tin Woodman. \"And to get Dorothy back to Kansas,\" added Andrew. \"I would really like to come,\" said the Lion. \"My life has been simply unbearable without a bit of courage of my own. But won't you feel degraded to be seen in the company of a cowardly lion like me?\" \"No, of course not,\" said Dorothy soothingly. \"You will be very welcome to come with us, you can keep away all of the other wild beasts from us. It seems to me they must be more cowardly than you are, if they let you frighten them away so easily.\" \"But that doesn't make me any braver though, I'm afraid,\" said the Lion miserably. So then they, along with the Lion as their new companion set off once again down the Yellow Brick Road toward the Emerald City.[Chapter 6] Amanda and Alice hadn't gone far down the path the Chesire Cat had pointed out to them before they came in sight of a large house with two very long chimneys on either side that were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with dark fur. \"This looks like it must be the house where the March Hare lives,\" Amanda said observantly. \"Indeed it does,\" agreed Alice. \"I do hope he's home, and that he isn't raving mad after all... or else we'll wish we'd gone to the Hatter's instead.\" They approached the house and entered into the front yard where they came upon an enormously large tea table set in the center of it and it was scattered rather untidily with immense quantities of tea things. They saw a tall and thin man with a huge purple top hat sitting at the front of the table and beside him there was a dark brown hare as tall as he was, and in-between them there was dormouse that was very large for a dormouse but was squeezed up in-between the other two individuals as they knocked their elbows on either of its sides and spoke loudly and in unison over it. Alice and Amanda went up to the two chairs nearest to the three figures and took seats in them. \"Do you guys mind if we sit here?\" asked Amanda uncertainly. The Hatter and Hare at once stopped jabbering and turned to stare wide-eyed at the two girls as though they were from another planet. Finally the Hatter said, \"Mind? What's it in a mind of where you sit?\" \"This is your table, isn't it?\" asked Alice uneasily. \"Do have some wine!\" the March Hare exclaimed suddenly. \"I'm sure we're too young to drink stuff like wine,\" said Amanda. \"Although I must admit I don't see any wine,\" added Alice looking around the table. \"That's because there isn't any!\" exclaimed the March Hare. \"Then why did you offer I in the first place?\" demanded Amanda. \"I agree,\" said Alice. \"That is very rude.\" \"You're hair wants a cutting,\" the Hatter said as he pointed directly at Alice. \"You should not make such personal remarks, it's rude also!\" Alice said heatedly. \"And your hair may do well with a hat on it,\" the Hatter added while pointing in Amanda's direction. Amanda seemed confused about how to take this. \"Was that a compliment or an insult?\" she asked the Hatter. \"Why is a raven like a writing desk?\" the Hatter asked, completely ignoring Amanda's question. \"I have no idea,\" said Alice frankly. \"Me neither,\" added Amanda. Just then the Mad Hatter took out a big and oddly designed pocket watch. \"Two days wrong!\" he exclaimed. \"I told you not to put butter in it!\" he added angrily to the March Hare. \"But it was the best of butter, you know,\" the March Hare said defensively. \"Yes, but some crumbs must have got into it as well,\" sighed the Hatter. \"I told you not to put it in with the bread knife.\" \"Do they make any sense to you?\" Amanda asked Alice. \"I'm afraid not,\" Alice replied wearily. \"The Dormouse is asleep again!\" the Hatter exclaimed, and he then proceeded to pour hot tea onto its head. The Dormouse squeaked loudly and its eyes popped wide open as it trembled, and then strangely it began to sing very slowly. \" Twinkle, twinkle, little bat! How I wonder what you're at! Up above the world you fly! Like a tea-tray in the sky!\" The Dormouse then laid its head on the table and began snoring softly once again. \"He is always sleeping!\" the March Hare exclaimed. \"He breathes when he sleeps is the same thing as he sleeps when he breathes!\" \"I sang the very thing at the concert last year given by the Queen of Hearts, you know,\" the Hatter said in a tone of pride. \"She called out, 'he is killing the time! Off with his head!'\" Amanda gasped in horror as Alice exclaimed, \"How dreadfully savage!\" \"Though she was right,\" the Hatter went on in the same way. \"Time hasn't spoken to me since then, and so now every time is tea-time!\" Then the Dormouse began singing in his sleep, repeating just the word \"twinkle\" over and over again. The Hatter and hare each seized him from either side and began proceeding to stuff him into a very big teapot. \"Put a lid on it, won't you!\" the Hatter exclaimed just as the finally squeezed the poor creature into the teapot and capped the top on it. \"Isn't that very uncomfortable for the Dormouse?\" asked Amanda with concern. \"Do take some more tea!\" exclaimed the March Hare. \"We haven't had any yet,\" said Alice. \"So we can't possibly take more!\" \"You mean you can't take less,\" the Hatter said. \"It's very easy to take more than nothing.\" \"Nobody asked your opinion!\" snapped Alice in exasperation. \"Well, who is making personal remarks now!\" the Hatter said triumphantly. Amanda spoke up now. \"Well, I don't think -\" \"Then you shouldn't talk!\" exclaimed the Hatter. This was finally going too far for both Alice and Amanda. They both stood from their chairs and marched away from the table as fast as they could go. \"Well, that was the stupidest tea party I'd ever been to in all my life!\" exclaimed Alice as they walked away from the house. \"Me too!\" agreed Amanda. \"Though it was also the only tea party I'd ever been to in all my life,\" she added. They walked a little further in silence before Amanda turned to Alice and asked, \"By the way, do you suppose that riddle could have any answer to it?\" \"You mean, 'why is a raven like a writing desk'?\" said Alice. \"I really don't know. And I doubt if they knew either!\" Amanda was just about to reply they suddenly heard a very soft voice from nearby speak. \"You could make an answer up for it yourselves, you know.\" The two girls looked around, and at first could find no source for the voice. Then suddenly Amanda let out a little cry of startled surprise and pointed to the left front of them as she exclaimed to Alice, \"Look! It's... it's a... bug! A very big bug!\" \"I am called a gnat if you please,\" replied the big bug slowly. There in front of them was a very large gnat, about the size of a prize chicken, standing up on its hind legs and looking at both of them with big and said eyes. \"Hello,\" said Alice. \"I never thought I'd ever see any gnat or insect as big as you!\" \"Tell me,\" said the gnat. \"What insects do you like best?\" \"I don't like any of them really,\" said Alice. \"Except for the ones that can talk like you though,\" she added hastily. \"I'm usually afraid of most of them,\" added Amanda. \"Though you seem to be very nice.\" \"Tell me,\" said the gnat, \"do you like to hear jokes?\" \"Yes, I do,\" said Alice. \"Do you have any?\" asked Amanda. \"Just this,\" the gnat began slowly. \"Why do houses have no doors?\" \"I don't know,\" said Alice. \"Why do houses have no doors?\" \"Because they're red,\" said the gnat Alice and Amanda looked at each other with puzzled expressions. The gnat looked extremely disheartened at this. \"I knew you wouldn't laugh,\" he said, sounding almost on the verge of tears. \"No one laughs at insects jokes! We're just not good at them!\" \"Oh, but I'm sure some are!\" Alice exclaimed hastily. \"Please don't be sad.\" \"Yeah, we're sorry if we hurt you're feelings,\" added Amanda. \"Try telling us another joke. I promise we'll laugh at it.\" \"All right,\" said the gnat with a sigh. \"Why do rattles argue?\" \"I don't know,\" said Alice. \"Why do rattles argue?\" \"They don't,\" replied the gnat. Alice and Amanda at once burst into laughter. However they couldn't fool the gnat with it. \"You're very kind,\" he said with tears in his eyes. \"But it's no use pretending. I'm just not funny because I am an insect!\" He let out a weak sob as the tears fell from his eyes. Amanda abruptly changed the subject. \"Well, you wouldn't by any chance happen to know a way out of these woods, would you?\" The gnat looked up at them sorrowfully and replied, \"No, I'm afraid not. However, if you wait here long enough, someone is certain to come by here who can rescue you.\" \"What do you mean?\" asked Amanda. \"Who would come by here to rescue us?\" Just then they heard a heavy clomping of hooves coming towards them from behind which was followed by a loud rattling of metal. \"See what I mean?\" said the gnat a bit more brightly. \"Farewell to you both.\" And so saying, the gnat got down on all six of its limbs and crawled away. Alice and Amanda turned around and looked towards the oncoming noise. And they saw a knight in shining pure white armor coming toward them riding on a handsome white horse. Then suddenly the knight tumbled off of his steed and fell to the ground in a clattering heap. Alice and Amanda at once ran up to his side and began to help him up. \"I hope no bones are broken,\" said Alice. \"No, none to speak of,\" replied the White Knight as he stood up unevenly. He lifted up hood of his helmet, revealing his face with its long white mustache and gentle blue eyes. \"Well, my dears,\" he said, \"You wouldn't care to be rescued, would you? I do it so awfully well, you know?\" \"Oh yes! Indeed we would!\" exclaimed Alice with much relief. \"If you would please just show us the way out of these woods,\" added Amanda. The White Knight smiled and climbed up onto his steed once again. \"Then follow my lead, fair maidens!\" So they followed him as he rode on his horse. As they went along the two girls noticed the very many things that were on the horse's back. \"What are all these things for?\" asked Amanda. \"These are all my own inventions,\" said the White Knight proudly. \"Here is my box to keep clothes and sandwiches in, I keep it hanging down so that rain doesn't get into it. And here is my mouse-trap to keep mice from crawling up my horse.\" He went on like this for a while, and then he and the horse stopped quite suddenly that they both startled the two girls. \"Here we are!\" said the White Knight triumphantly. \"Here is your way out of these woods.\" Alice and Amanda looked around but could see nothing but the biggest tree they ever saw in front of them with a very wide trunk on it. \"Where is the way out exactly?\" inquired Amanda. \"It's through the door in this tree,\" the White Knight explained. \"There are of course other ways out, but this is the shortcut.\" Alice rubbed her hands against the tree's trunk and found the edges of the door that was in it. \"Oh! I see now! Thank you very much, gallant knight!\" The White Knight bowed his head to them, and then turned his steed forward again and rode away. Alice and Amanda waved to him for a while till he was far from their sight. Then they both took hold of the door in the tree and pulled it wide open. On the other side of the tree they were much astonished by what they saw. \"Why, I do believe everything in there is a shade of purple!\" exclaimed Alice in wonder. \"Or at least purplish,\" added Amanda. \"But at least it is another place.\" And then they both stepped together through the door in the tree trunk and into their new surroundings.[Chapter 7] Alice and Amanda stepped out of the door of the tree and came out of a door in another tree on the other side. They found themselves in another wood in which everything was tinted a light shade of purple. Alice looked around and seemed to be disappointed. \"Well, I don't believe we are truly out of the woods yet after all!\" she exclaimed. \"Well, we are at least in another place,\" Amanda said observantly. \"And I kind of like this one better because purple is my favorite color, and I never saw purple grass and trees before!\" Just then, they heard the sound of footsteps coming towards them which were followed shortly by a soft whistling. They stood still and waited for the source to come to them. Then they saw a boy who looked to be a few years older than them, though wasn't much taller, carrying a hatchet on his shoulder. When he saw them he stopped and looked at them in great curiosity. \"Hello,\" he said. \"What are you two girls doing in these woods all alone? You don't live near here, do you?\" \"No, indeed,\" said Alice. \"We just came here, from somewhere else. We don't even know where we are now. Could you please tell us?\" \"You're in the Gilikin Country in the Land of Oz,\" he replied. \"My name is Tippertaurius, but you may just call me Tip.\" \"How do you do?\" said Alice. \"My name is Alice, and this is my friend Amanda.\" \"Could you help us find or way out of here?\" asked Amanda. \"I was actually on my way out myself,\" replied Tip. \"I was just here cutting some branches. Come with me.\" So they followed him and he led them to a wheelbarrow that was filled with branches cut off from old trees, and also a large log was in the middle of them. He took hold of the wheelbarrow and pushed it forward as they followed him out of the woods. \"What exactly are you going to do with all this wood you've cut?\" asked Amanda curiously. \"I'm gonna build something,\" replied Tip. \"What are you going to build?\" asked Alice. \"A body,\" replied Tip, \"for a pumpkin I've just carved a face into.\" \"A jack-o-lantern?\" inquired Amanda. \"Yes,\" replied Tip. \"And giving it a body would make it complete for just what I want to do with it.\" \"And what do you want to do with it?\" asked Amanda. \"I want to scare Mombi so that she'll squeal louder than our pig does when I pull her tail,\" Tip said gleefully. \"Why would you want to scare Mombi?\" inquired Alice. \"And who is she exactly?\" \"She has been my guardian from birth, but she is as mean as a rattlesnake, and in fact she is a witch. She likes to scare me in a lot of ways, so now I've decided its my time to pay her back,\" Tip replied. They then left the woods behind them and came out onto a hill on which they saw a cottage with a fence around it. They followed Tip into the yard where he showed them the pumpkin he had carved a face into. \"It looks very well carved,\" said Alice. \"I especially like its smile.\" \"And it will stand out all the more on him once I have constructed his body,\" Tip announced proudly. So then Tip set about making the body from the wood he had gathered. He used the old log as the torso, and then fastened the branches for the arms and legs onto it with wooden pegs he crafted. When he was done he and the girls stood him up and looked up at him in admiration. \"A job well done on him, if I do say so myself,\" Tip said proudly. \"Oh yes,\" said Alice. \"Now, perhaps if he had some clothes on he would be even better.\" \"You're right,\" agreed Tip. \"I know just where to get them.\" He then went inside the cottage and came out with a set of clothes and a pair of old shoes. Then he and the girls put the red shirt, pink and white spotted vest, and purple trousers and shoes onto the pumpkinhead's body. They then looked at him again with much delight. \"Why, he looks almost like an actual person!\" Alice exclaimed in wonder. \"He does at that!\" agreed Tip. And so good a man must have a name of his own. So we'll call him Jack Pumpkinhead!\" They then carried the figure they had made to the side of the road and had him lean on a wooden branch. \"Mombi is sure to see him when she comes home,\" Tip said excitedly. \"She left this morning to see Dr. Nikkidik, the Crooked Magician. She should be back any minute now. In fact, I think I hear her coming! Come on, let's hide! Quick!\" So the three of them rushed behind some bushes nearby and peeked out in-between the branches and waited anxiously. Soon they saw a short and bent old hag coming up the path hobbling on a crooked cane. She saw the pumpkinheaded figure by the roadside. \"Good evening, sir!\" she said. Then turned swiftly around and staggered backward with a loud cry of fright. \"It worked! I knew it would!\" Tip whispered to the girls with a devilish grin. They then watched as the old hag lifted her cane to the pumpkinhead as if aiming to smash it. But then she stopped and lowered her cane as she seemed to be pondering something. She then searched through a basket she had at her side and then took out a small box from it out of which took a handful of what looked like sparkling dust and threw it onto the pumpkinhead so that it coursed over his entire body. \"What is she doing?\" Amanda whispered fearfully. Then they all watched as Mombi lifted up her left hand and cried out, \"Weaugh!\" Then raised her right hand and cried out, \"Teaugh!\" Then extended both hands upward and cried out, \"Peaugh!\" Then, much to their astonishment they watched as the pumpkinheaded figure trembled from head to foot, and then straightened and turned towards Mombi, who let out another loud cry of fright at this. \"Don't yell like that!\" said the pumpkinhead putting his hands to the sides of his head. \"Do you think I'm deaf?\" Mombi now let out a loud cackle of glee and ecstasy. She lifted her walking stick up in the air and began to dance a jig all around the pumpkinhead. \"He lives! He lives!\" she exclaimed again and again. \"He lives!\" \"She's brought Jack Pumpkinhead to life!\" said Amanda in a loud whisper. \"She truly has!\" Alice said. Tip then began to laugh out loud, and before either of the girls could stop him it was too late. Mombi heard him. She went up to the bushes and seized Tip by his collar and dragged him out with her towards the cottage. \"You naughty, sneaking, wicked boy!\" she shrieked. \"I'll teach you to spy on my secrets and to make fun of me!\" \"I wasn't making fun of you,\" said Tip. \"I was laughing at old Pumpkinhead! Isn't he a sight?\" \"I hope you are not reflecting on my personal appearance,\" said Jack Pumpkinhead as he was listening to them. \"I'll deal with you later, Pumpkinhead!\" snapped Mombi in Jack's direction. \"I'll deal with you right away though, Tippertaurius!\" she added nastily to the cringing boy beside her. \"What are you going to do to me?\" asked Tip fearfully. Just then Mombi opened the cottage door and then closed almost a soon as when she had pulled tip inside with her. Amanda and Alice slowly came out of their hiding places. They then crept up to the door and tried to listen to anything happening inside. \"I don't want to be a marble statue!\" they heard Tip exclaim. \"That doesn't matter; I want you to be one,\" they heard Mombi reply evilly. \"But what use will I be then?\" asked Tip. \"There won't be anyone to work for you.\" \"I'll make the Pumpkinhead work for me,\" replied Mombi. \"Why don't you change me into a goat, or a chicken?\" he asked anxiously. \"You can't do anything with a marble statue.\" \"Oh yes I can,\" retorted Mombi. \"I'm going to plant a flower garden next spring, and I'll put you in the middle of it, for an ornament. I wonder why I hadn't thought of it before; you've been a bother to me for years.\" \"Oh no!\" gasped Alice. \"We just can't let that happen to him!\" exclaimed Amanda. \"But what can we do for him?\" inquired Alice. \"We can rescue him,\" said Amanda. \"But how?\" asked Alice. \"We'll have to get him away from Mombi,\" replied Amanda. \"But won't Mombi easily be able to capture us and then turn us into marble statues as well?\" Alice asked fearfully. \"A good point,\" said Amanda. Then after thinking on it for a moment she said decidedly, \"We'll just have to wait until it's dark in a couple hours and then we'll sneak into the house and get Tip out of there without Mombi noticing.\" \"I truly hope we will be able to,\" said Alice. And so they waited the couple hours until the sun had just set behind the clouds and the stars began to come out. Then they crept quietly up to the cottage door and Amanda attempted to open it, only to find it had locked tight. \"The door is locked!\" she moaned. \"And with no key or anything to pick the lock with,\" Alice said miserably. Amanda then suddenly seem to have had an idea of her own. She looked over at Jack Pumpkinhead, who had been standing silently beside the barn next to them the whole time. \"Yes, we do,\" she said brightly. \"We have Jack over here.\" \"But how can he help us?\" asked Alice. \"Very easily,\" replied Amanda. She then went up to Jack, with Alice following, and said, \"Jack, we need you to do a little favor for us right now.\" \"What do you need me for?\" asked Jack, sounding very interested. \"Come with us to the door first,\" replied Amanda. So he came with them and then she whispered her instructions to him carefully. \"Just stick your longest and most pointed finger into this keyhole right here. Good. Now turn it around inside of it. Yes, that's it. Well done! Now, it should be able to open for us, I hope.\" She then tried the door again, and this time found to her immense relief and satisfaction that it opened quite easily. The three of them then stepped cautiously into the cottage. They looked around for a moment and quickly spotted Tip sitting in a corner of the room tied up into a chair with his arms behind its back. There was a burning candle on a table beside him along with a glass vial that was emitting a series of strong and nauseating fumes from it. When Tip saw them come in his eyes lit up with relief a moment and then with worry. \"It's all right Tip. It's us,\" whispered Amanda. \"We're here to get you out of this mess.\" \"Be quick,\" he whispered back. \"Mombi is just now asleep.\" So they went behind him and silently and carefully untied his binding to the wooden chair behind him. And then Amanda took his hand and the four of them rushed out of the cottage door and closed it silently behind them again. Then, with Amanda clutching Tip's hand, and Alice clutching onto Jack's, they all hurried away down the path away from the cottage that was lit by the light of the full moon. When they had run about a mile or so away, they slowed down to catch their breaths. Tip turned to the two girls and said very gratefully, \"I can't thank you enough, my friends! You saved my life. Mombi was planning to turn me into a marble statue in the morning. That bad smelling stuff next to me was the potion she had made for me to drink to become such, and so she had tied me up so I wouldn't escape. I thought I was a goner, I just didn't think about you two coming to my rescue.\" \"Well, it wasn't us alone who rescued you,\" replied Amanda. \"We also had a bit of help from your creation, Jack Pumpkinhead here. He poked his longest finger into the lock to open the door so we could get in to save you.\" \"I am your creation?\" Jack asked Tip in amazement. \"Why, yes, you are in fact,\" replied Tip. \"Because I built you all on my own by hand and put you together, carved your face, and dressed you also.\" \"Why, then you must be my dear, dear father!\" \"Must I?\" asked Tip rather taken aback. Amanda and Alice both seemed to be struggling to contain their inner laughter. Amanda spoke first saying, \"Well, you know Tip he does have a point you know.\" \"Yes, indeed,\" agreed Alice. \"After all, when any creature is first born the very first thing it sees is its parent. So, congratulations to you on becoming such a young father.\" Even in the pale light of only the moon they could see exactly how brightly Tip was blushing at this. \"Well, now I owe you obedience, and you owe me support, right?\" said Jack Pumpkinhead. \"Yes, I suppose you're right,\" Tip said resignedly. \"Now, let's go find a place to rest in safety. I'm getting tired.\" And so they did. The three children laid down in a row from each other while Jack remained standing. \"I don't feel the least bit tired,\" he said in confusion. \"Is that wrong for me?\" \"No, not for you at all,\" replied Tip. \"You're just made that way. But that's very well, because you can stay up and keep watch over us through the night. Be sure to wake us if you see anyone at all coming along this way.\" \"Very well, dear father,\" replied Jack.[Chapter 8] arly the next morning the three children awakened from their slumber and found Jack Pumpkinhead still was still standing up beside them and smiling as broadly as ever. They all stood up and Tip took Jack by the hand once again. \"Come on now,\" he said to him. \"We must keep moving on.\" \"Where are we going, dear father?\" asked Jack. \"You'll know as soon as we do,\" Tip replied briskly. So then they all went forth once again. They walked along all morning long at a steady pace, and by the afternoon they were becoming quite hot and tired and slowed their pace. Tip turned to Jack Pumpkinhead beside him. \"Are you tired?\" he asked him. \"No, indeed,\" he replied. \"Though it is sure that the joints in my legs will wear out if I keep on walking.\" \"That is true, unfortunately,\" said Tip regretfully. \"If I had known you were going to be brought to life before I made you, I would have made you much more liable joints.\" \"Why don't you sit down to rest your joints?\" suggested Amanda. \"In fact, why don't we all sit down now and take a break?\" So then they all stopped and Alice and Amanda sat down on an old log while Tip sat down on a tree stump and Jack Pumpkinhead sat down on a wooden sawhorse next to them. \"What is this thing that I am sitting on, dear father?\" asked Jack with curiosity. \"It's called a sawhorse,\" replied Tip. \"It's used to saw logs on.\" \"Why, it looks almost just like a real live horse does, to me!\" said Alice in astonishment. \"Why so it does in fact,\" said Tip in wonder at this discovery. \"If only if it were a real horse to be ridden on,\" said Amanda. \"Then we could have something to carry us on our journey to wherever we are going to. And it would be especially useful for Jack to ride on it.\" \"Why so it would,\" said Tip thoughtfully. \"I wonder... maybe it can be brought to life!\" \"But how could it be?\" said Alice with a laugh. \"It's made of wood.\" \"So am I,\" said Jack. \"So you are,\" said Amanda. \"If only we had the stuff that Mombi used to bring Jack alive, then we could bring this sawhorse alive as well.\" \"Well, we can!\" exclaimed Tip. \"Because I have it with me, right here.\" He reached into his jacket pocket and took out the very same box that Mombi had previously had which contained the magic dust that she used to bring Jack alive with. Alice and Amanda stared at Tip in amazement. \"How did you get hold of it? I thought Mombi had it,\" said Amanda. \"She did,\" said Tip. \"But it fell out of her basket and I picked it up when she wasn't looking and hid it from her.\" \"Well, what exactly is it?\" asked Alice. Tip looked at the label on the box and read the description to them aloud. \"Dr. Nikidik's Powder of Life. Will bring any inanimate object fully alive when used correctly. Use with care.\" \"Powder of Life!\" exclaimed Amanda. \"That explains everything. Let's try it out on the Sawhorse right away!\" \"You do remember the magic words that Mombi spoke when she brought Jack alive, don't you Tip?\" asked Alice. \"I'm sure I do,\" said Tip. He then went up to the Sawhorse which Jack was sitting on and sprinkled some of the powder into his hand and flung it onto the sawhorse. Then he lifted up his left hand and cried out, \"Weaugh!\" \"What does that mean, dear father?\" asked Jack curiously. \"I don't know!\" said Tip. Then he lifted up his right hand and cried out, \"Teaugh!\" \"What does that mean?\" Jack asked again. \"It means you must keep quiet!\" Alice said sharply. \"I'm learning so much,\" said Jack. Then Tip raised up both his hands at the sawhorse and cried out, \"Peaugh!\" Then, all once, the Sawhorse did indeed come to life. It trembled with Jack on its back and blinked its knotted eyes rapidly and then kicked out its hind legs and then its forelegs and with a small jump it began to run all around in the area around them. Jack clutched at the head of the Sawhorse with one hand and at his own head with the other as the Sawhorse was running exactly like a completely wild steed. \"It worked! It really worked! It lives!\" exclaimed Alice as she clapped her hands together at their success. \"It worked a little too well, though!\" added Amanda as she watched the Sawhorse running around at a dizzying pace with Jack holding on for dear life to it. \"Whoa there!\" exclaimed Tip, trying to get the Sawhorse to stop. \"Whoa I say! Whoa!\" But the Sawhorse paid him no mind and did not even slow down. It ran around tirelessly with Jack unable to safely get off of it. \"Help me! Dear father! Help me!\" cried Jack helplessly. It was, coincidentally at this moment, however that the Sawhorse diverged his direction and its left foreleg stumbled into a gopher hole that was in its way. It bucked in surprise and alarm and its leg snapped off short. \"It's stopped! Finally! It was making me so dizzy!\" exclaimed Alice in relief. \"But look!\" exclaimed Amanda in dismay. \"It's broken one of its legs now and it won't be able to walk anymore!\" \"Is this bad?\" asked Jack. \"I'm afraid it really is,\" replied Tip sadly. \"We need this Sawhorse for you to ride on.\" \"And, to make matters worse,\" added Amanda, \"there is no wood around here that can be used to make a new leg for the Sawhorse, either.\" \"So what can we do now?\" asked Alice in great despair. \"Well,\" said Tip as he tried to think of a solution. \"Maybe we could all try carrying the Sawhorse for a while until we can find something to replace his leg with.\" \"Doesn't look rather heavy for us all to carry though?\" asked Alice looking sadly at the Sawhorse who was still bent down on one side with its leg stuck in the gopher hole. \"Well,\" said Tip, \"maybe we could -\" \"Oh my! Look there!\" exclaimed Alice all of a sudden. \"What! What is it?\" asked Tip much startled. \"Look! There is someone coming up here from down the road!\" Alice exclaimed as she pointed straight ahead of them. They all looked in the direction, and they did in fact see a figure of someone coming up to them. It moved along in a strange sideways motion. \"Someone... or maybe something is coming up here,\" said Tip. \"Let's get his attention!\" said Amanda brightly. \"Maybe he can help us out!\" So the three of them all jumped up and down and waved their arms up in the air as they called out \"Over here! Come to us!\" to whoever or whatever was coming up towards them. The thing that they saw came right up to them with soundless footsteps. Then when it stood before them they were all very much shocked at what it actually was. \"Why, it's a bug!\" Tip said loudly. \"A huge bug!\" It was indeed such. It had antennae sticking out at either side of its head and on the end of its nose also, and its body was large and round shaped like a beetle's, and its limbs were long and wiry and seemed to be very flexible. It was also dressed in very stylish clothes and had a tall old-fashioned hat on its head in between its antennae. The insectlike creature smiled at them as it began to laugh a very merry and lighthearted sounding chuckle at Tip's exclaimation. \"You are unquestionably right, young sir!\" he said jovially. \"Yes, I am a bug, and very proud of it if I do say so myself. Permit me to present to you my card.\" He then took from his vest pocket a small square of white cardboard which he extended to Tip who accepted it and read aloud with his eyes wide and round, \"Mr. H.M. Wogglebug T.E.\" \"Dear me!\" gasped Alice. \"So you're a... wogglebug?\" inquired Amanda. \"Yes, indeed,\" said the Wogglebug. \"And the initials at the beginning of my name mean that I am Highly Magnified, and indeed am I not several thousand times larger than any wogglebug you ever saw before?\" \"You are indeed!\" replied Tip. \"And you're also the only wogglebug I ever saw,\" added Amanda. \"Would it be proper for us to ask also what the T.E. at the end of your name stands for?\" inquired Alice. The Wogglebug smiled proudly and replied, \"Those letters express my degree. To be more explicit, the initials mean that I am Thoroughly Educated!\" \"Oh my!\" gasped Alice. \"You must be so proud. Education is a thing to be proud of, after all.\" \"Yes, indeed it is, and yes, indeed I am,\" replied the Wogglebug. \"And, in fact, I am just now on my way to the Emerald City to make a place for myself at the capitol of society there! I must say, it is a pleasure for me to meet all of you now. But tell me, what has brought you all here?\" \"Well,\" said Amanda. \"I'm afraid me and Alice hardly know how we got to this land as we just came from another one that we were led into from another one.\" \"And as for me and Jack Pumpkinhead you see there,\" added Tip solemnly. \"We're running away from a witch named Mombi who wants to turn me into a marble statue, which she would have done by now if Alice and Amanda hadn't come to my rescue when they did.\" \"Oh, you poor children!\" exclaimed the Wogglebug in sympathy. \"You're lost without a destination to get to, and you my boy are in the most terrible trouble of all! Well, I'll tell you what to do. You just come along with me to the Emerald City and there I shall make sure that you two girls are returned to your homes safely, and that you young lad are put out of harm in the way of this witch called Mombi. So now let us bend our steps in the destination, shall we?\" \"Thank you, Mr. Wogglebug,\" said Alice. \"We really appreciate your kind help to us. But you see, our Sawhorse here has just broken a leg and can't walk now.\" \"And there's no wood around here to make him a new one from,\" added Amanda. \"And we can't leave the Sawhorse behind, because Jack Pumpkinhead is so stiff in his joints that he has to ride it,\" Tip finished. \"Oh, how very unfortunate for all of you!\" exclaimed the Wogglebug. Then he looked carefully at Jack Pumpkinhead on top of the Sawhorse and then a bright smile came to his features. \"If the Pumpkinhead is to ride, why not use one of his legs to make a leg for the horse that carries him? I judge that both are made of wood?\" \"Oh! Of course! Why didn't any of us think of that?\" said Alice in great relief. \"It's the very solution we need.\" \"Yes, thank you, Mr. Wogglebug,\" said Amanda. \"You've saved us all.\" \"You're welcome,\" said the Wogglebug smiling. \"It all comes naturally when one happens to be thoroughly educated.\" And so then they took the Sawhorse's broken leg out of the hole and detached it from him. Then after Tip had carefully detached one of Jack's legs he attached it into the hole left in the Sawhorse from where its old leg had been. The Sawhorse then limped about unsteadily for a few moments before it had gotten more used to its new limb. Then once it seemed to be all right again the three children along with the Wogglebug started off on their way towards the Emerald City. The Wogglebug looked thoughtfully at the Sawhorse for a moment as he walked alongside it and Jack. Then he said, \"You know, of course, that if I were to ride upon this Sawhorse instead of the pumpkinhead, he would then not only be an animal but would also become an equipage! For he would then be a horse-and-buggy!\" The Wogglebug burst into laughter at his own joke, and after a moment so did Tip, Amanda, and Alice, Jack didn't though as he didn't understand what was so funny. \"Why are you all laughing at that for?\" Jack inquired. \"Because it's funny!\" said Tip. \"It is a joke, after all,\" added Amanda. \"And jokes are always meant to be funny. The Wogglebug nodded proudly and added, \"And such a joke, derived from a play upon words is considered among educated people to be imminently proper.\" \"What does that mean?\" asked Jack. \"It means, my dear friend,\" explained the Wogglebug, \"that the English language contains many words that have a double meaning, and to pronounce a joke that allows both meanings of a certain word proves the joker a person of culture and refinement, who has moreover a thorough command of the language.\" \"Gosh, I never thought of words with double meanings in that way,\" said Alice in wonder. \"You really are educated thoroughly, Mr. Wogglebug. And I wish you could meet the gnat we met before we came to this land for he would love to meet you and learn from you how to tell proper jokes. He would indeed.\" \"Well, I might like to me this gnat sometime myself also,\" said the Wogglebug. \"I'm always happy to meet anyone who happens to share my interests.\" Amanda looked thoughtful for a time and then turned to the Wogglebug again and said, \"Well, are you also good at finding answers to riddles with no answer for them?\" \"Absolutely!\" declared the Wogglebug stoutly. \"Well,\" Amanda continued. \"I've been wondering a lot lately about this one. Why is a raven like a writing desk?\" \"That is so easy to know!\" the Wogglebug exclaimed airily. \"You see, they both have black quills! Didn't you know that?\" \"Oh my! Of course!\" Alice exclaimed as she put a hand to her forehead. \"How could I have never have figured it out for myself in the first place!\" \"Now I sure would love to see the look on that Hatter's face if he was to hear the answer to his riddle!\" Amanda said laughing.

Jinni andnI-Am-The-One followed the sound. They opened a door to find the VicenViceroy under the sheets with a lady. \"OhnVice Viceroy getting some action,\" I-Am-The-One said. VicenViceroy looked totally embarrassed. Jinni made his way over to thenscreens at the other side of the room. \"What'snthis?\" Jinni asked unfolding a small piece of paper. OnenHour Later Jinninhad just gotten done unfolding the paper, it was huge. \"Youndon't need to see that,\" Vice Viceroy said getting up. \"Whatnthe crap.

Go for it!\" The ball flew through the cloudless sky, circling around with startling speed, approaching the spring grass like a torpedo. Not having any time to adjust his glasses, Richard Tyler jolted his glove further onto his hand, and darted across the grass. He stretched his legs in giant strides, just as his gym teacher had taught him. He loved the feeling while he ran, catching up to the baseball that soared above his head. Now, it was hovering just inches from his open hand. Richard stretched his arm, but he couldn't catch the ball. It missed his fingers, so he had to dive. Balancing the ball on the tips of his fingers, Richard felt the moist spring grass soak into his shirt, but he stood back up, triumphant, while the ball rolled comfortably in his palm. \"I got it, Travis!\" he called. \"Cool, Richard!\" his friend screamed back. \"You actually dive for the balls now!\" another boy called. \"Gym class will be interesting now!\" By the time Richard got to his feet, Travis raced over to him and patted his back, sharply but playfully. \"Geez, what planet did you come from, Richie?\" he asked. \"Last month you absolutely wouldn't come out on the playground, and now you're diving for your life in ball games with us.\" \"Actually, I always sat by the trees,\" Richard answered meekly. \"Whatever,\" Travis said. \"What counts now, Rich, is that you're actually normal after all. And we like that.\" \"Wanna' play another catch round, Tyler?\" a boy called to Richard and Travis. \"Sorry, guys,\" Richard said. \"I gotta go return some books to the library.\" He started towards his schoolbag, lying on the grass next to his friends' against the school building. \"You're a nerd, Rich,\" Travis muttered. \"But you know, it doesn't matter. We keep playing those games, and we're going to kick some butt during gym class, I tell you what! So, game after school tomorrow?\" \"Okay, Travis,\" Richard answered, slinging his bag across his shoulder. \"See you later.\" Travis waved before he ran back to join the other boys in their ball game. As Richard walked around the school to the bike racks, he heard his friends crying out and laughing, while the ball whooshed once more through the air. Richard wished he could stay and play, but it had taken him forever to read those books in his bag. And Mr. Dewey probably wouldn't allow him another renewal on them. The old librarian was far too strict that way. Still, Richard liked his after-school trips to the library. The library in question was a strange and ancient-looking building, hidden away between the trees at the back of the city park. It was unlike anything Richard had ever seen before, and was always disappointed on days that he wasn't able to go there. Since about a month ago, Richard had came from playing ball with his new friends, straight to the library, where he sat and did his homework, or just wandered through the aisles looking for something to read. There was something magical- indescribable, for lack of a better word- about that place, and he made sure to spend as much time there as he could. And with a librarian like Mr. Dewey running the library, it was truly as otherworldly a place as one could get. Richard strapped on his helmet, and kicked back the bike's kickstand, before he started pedaling down the warm sidewalk. He pushed harder after he was comfortable in his seat, turning from his school in the direction of the park. As he rode, he didn't take much time to notice the activity going on around him. Toddlers rode their tricycles, parents were watering their plants, and cars blasting heavy-bass music drove down the street, but Richard didn't see any of it. His excitement to get to the library drove him on like a marathon runner. After riding down the long neighborhood street, and a winding bike path, he came to the wrought-iron gates to the park where, not too far off, partially hidden in the lush trees, were the tall marble columns of the library doorway. Richard shoved his bike towards the building, where he quickly fastened his bike to a thick tree trunk, and started up the stairs past the two stone lions guarding the doorway. They both glared right ahead, while the tree branches cast their shadows on them, making their thick stone manes seem to waver just slightly. He pulled the doors open, and strode inside, feeling the rush of warm air while the doors drifted closed behind him. Richard's footsteps clomped hard on the library floor, while he started for the front desk. At the edge of the tall oak desk, Richard stood on his tiptoes to look over the counter. He was surprised to find it empty; Mr. Dewey should be right here. \"Hello?\" Richard called out. \"Mr. Dewey, you here?\" Answer, came there none. Then, from the aisle behind him, there came a creaking sound, mixed with low squeaking, and footsteps clicking on the floor. Gradually, the noises got louder, and louder, until Richard could feel the presence of someone standing just inches behind him. He turned, to find the sparkly, gleeful face of Mr. Dewey. \"Richard Tyler,\" he whispered, grinning at the boy. \"What sort of adventure do you want to have today?\" \"Homework, first, Mr. Dewey,\" Richard said, starting towards the aisle that would lead to the sitting area where he could find a table. \"Ah, yes, that's right,\" Mr. Dewey said, pushing the book cart further towards the front desk, where he stopped and leaned against it wearily. \"You okay?\" Richard asked him. \"Oh, yes,\" Mr. Dewey answered in a wispy voice. \"Although, every day gets longer and longer. It's not that often during the day, you know, that people come through here.\" Richard suppressed a chuckle. Perhaps that was because Mr. Dewey tried to guess a little too much at what people needed, when he met them. That was a peculiar talent of his, and Richard could remember very well how Mr. Dewey had guessed his need- he hadn't. \"Gee, that's too bad,\" Richard said instead. \"But something tells me I have a regular,\" Mr. Dewey said, proudly. \"I have never seen someone come by here so often as you do.\" \"Maybe,\" Richard answered, readjusting his bag strap. \"I…I've had more adventure in here than most kids in my class.\" He had to cover a half-smile-half-grimace, when he remembered what sorts of things he had encountered within the library before. \"No need to finish, I know what from,\" Mr. Dewey interjected. \"In any case, never mind me. These books need to get back onto the shelf.\" \"Sure,\" Richard said, taking a side-step away from the front desk. In the meantime, Mr. Dewey had absentmindedly reached into the pocket of his sweater vest, and removed a large, circular object the size of a padlock. While Richard stepped in the direction he wanted to go, Mr. Dewey gazed a little forlornly at the object, turning it over and over in his hands. The strange artifact sparkled bright silver and white in the light from the chandeliers above. Maybe it wasn't having no company in the library that made the old librarian so weary, but this old piece of metalwork. It was heavy in his pocket all the time, and, truth be told, he honestly didn't use it too often. It was much, much older than he was, and now that he thought about it, its unique value might make it better in the hands of a child. A child with a growing imagination, perhaps. \"Richard?\" Mr. Dewey called after him. Just as he was about to enter the archway into the sitting area, Richard turned. \"Yeah?\" he asked loudly. \"I have something I think you might like to have,\" Mr. Dewey replied, waving the silver object above his head. Richard blinked a couple of times at the old librarian, but he walked back to him anyway. When Richard had come back, Mr. Dewey held the heavy silver object down to him in open palms, as though it were a sacred treasure. \"Hmm. It kind of looks like the old pocket watches I saw in my history book,\" Richard noted, pushing his glasses up for a better look, and feeling the silver chain that dangled from one end of the object. Mr. Dewey chuckled. \"Maybe so, my boy. But this is far from being an ordinary pocket watch.\" He extended his hands farther down so that the object fell into Richard's hands. \"Go on. Open it up,\" he encouraged gently. Richard did as he was told, pushing his fingernails into the crevice running all the way around the heavy object. He pried it open, and a silver lid opened up, like a compact. On the other half of the object, an ornate silver arrow trembled in its place, pointing towards a curvy \"N\" at the top. \"It's a compass,\" Richard murmured. \"Correct,\" Mr. Dewey proudly said. \"And a very special compass at that, made exactly from the same model of the compass inlaid on the rotunda floor.\" Richard grinned in awe, turning the compass over and under in his hands. The face of the compass had curly sparkly letters marking the directions, while the surface of the face was made of heavy marble. That was particularly interesting to Richard, who stroked his fingers across the smooth marble with fascination. \"This is neat,\" Richard murmured. \"But, where exactly did you get this? It looks almost like an antique.\" \"Perhaps the next time you open a book, you'll find out,\" Mr. Dewey said. \"But I can't waste your own time talking about it, when you can be starting your own adventure now.\" Richard frowned at the compass. Once more he looked it over, feeling the smooth, shiny surface, and watching the way the chandeliers threw their light on the marble in abstract forms. So, Mr. Dewey wanted him to keep around a compass, while he read? Richard looked in each direction the compass pointed in; the only purpose he could think of for it was to keep him from losing his way within the labyrinths of shelves. But, perhaps he ought to just hang onto it. He couldn't even consider handing it back to Mr. Dewey right this minute; it would be too easy for him to be sentimental about it. \"Well, thanks, Mr. Dewey,\" Richard said instead, closing the compass, and clenching it in his hand. \"You're most welcome,\" Mr. Dewey said, bowing his head and walking behind the front desk. \"Well, you know what to do. Adventure awaits you.\" Richard nodded before he quickly strode back towards the sitting area. When he was far away enough, he lifted the compass to eye level, and shook his head. He felt maybe he would never be able to understand how Mr. Dewey's mind ran. A silver compass like this couldn't possibly be meant for him. It looked too ancient, too expensive, for Mr. Dewey to simply give away. By this time Richard had arrived at the sitting area, but when he sat down, he didn't take out any of his schoolbooks. After plopping down in a chair, he held the compass by its chain in front of his face, where it swung back and forth like a pendulum. He shook his head again. Maybe he ought to just put the thing away and get started; he dawdled anymore, and he would have to stop early and head home. Shrugging helplessly, Richard stuck the compass in his bag pocket, and removed the first textbook he grabbed from inside, plucking a pencil from the notebook spiral. But what he didn't notice, was that the compass sparked with a jab of blue lightning when it touched the library books still in his bag.[Chapter 2] Chapter 2 Tromping in through the front door, Richard dragged his schoolbag to the mud room, dropping it on the floor before he turned to the kitchen. The heat of fresh steam brushed his cheeks while he entered the archway, and the sound of the whirring fridge door whirring greeted him warmly. \"Perfect timing, Richie,\" his mother said, opening the microwave door, and putting a paper plate with a bun inside. \"I thought I'd make hot dogs tonight, since apparently you came home so early.\" \"Early?\" Richard repeated, pulling out a stool at the kitchen island. \"You're back early from the library,\" his mother explained. \"Usually, we have to wait a lot later for you to break yourself away from all those books. You must be starving by now.\" \"Well, I am, a little bit,\" Richard said, after some hesitation; his mind was still on the silver compass sticking from the front pocket of his bag, the chain dangling to the hard-wood floor. \"Okay,\" his mother said, reaching into the fridge for the ketchup and mustard. She set them on the counter before she plucked an apple from the fruit basket next to the microwave. But while she reached for a knife to slice the apple, her expression fell into deep thoughtfulness. \"Hey, Mom, you okay?\" Richard asked, leaning forward across the counter in interest. \"I'm just thinking, about you, Rich,\" she said. \"I feel like ever since that night with the big storm, things have just been…well, not quite the same. You know, I honestly never thought I'd see the day when you would bring a group of boys home for a movie and popcorn and video games.\" \"I guess I had to talk to them sometime,\" Richard said, shrugging his shoulders. \"They're not really a bad bunch of guys.\" \"I can see that. But, it's…it's so…amazing, for lack of a better word, to see that you're not so afraid of the world anymore. I mean, playing ball with the boys on the playground, and…talking to them on a regular basis. That's a pretty giant step for you, Rich.\" \"I know. Still, it's…not like I didn't fight a few dragons to get there. Or, turn over some new stones.\" Richard played with a fringe of his blonde hair sheepishly. His mother gave him an odd look, but her growing smile was still there. \"I suppose you did,\" she said. \"Still, Richie, I'm proud of you. It obviously takes a whole lot of courage for you to make so many changes.\" \"Thanks, Mom.\" \"I'm glad. Here's the apple, and some milk. Five seconds left on the microwave.\" … .. Later that night, Richard snuck into the mud room and picked up his schoolbag, hauling it up the stairs to his bedroom. His parents had already bid him good night before they went to their room, but in all the excitement from Richard's father that Richard had finally managed to catch a baseball without fleeing, his schoolbag with the compass inside had been forgotten about. His footsteps were muffled on the carpeted stairs, but his heart was slamming into his throat. No matter how much he had told himself that there was nothing mysterious about the compass, it actually seemed to embed itself deeper into his mind. Mr. Dewey's face, when he had handed Richard the compass, was hard to ignore just the same- the glow in his eyes, and the knowing behind his smile- left something in the back of Richard's head. After the strange thing that happened to Richard the first time he had entered that library, didn't help to make it go away. When he was finally in his room, with the door shut tight, Richard dumped his bag on his bed and slowly yanked the compass out by its long chain. Even in the dim of the night, the compass's silver surface still found a way to sparkle, making Richard's skin turn an icy blue color. He pulled the lid open, and, gently, he set the compass on his desk. The ornate black arrow pointed to the wall behind the desk, boldly standing out, against the snowy white marble of the compass face. But then, Richard stopped. He pulled his glasses further up his nose, and kneeled down to observe the face of the compass. Sure enough the black arrow was pointing where he thought it was. However, the needle was still pointing at the bold \"N\", where, in this case, was actually east. Richard snatched up the compass, and looked it over and under another time. Wasn't a compass supposed to always point north? Yeah, he thought, the arrow always turned to the strongest point of the earth's magnitude, and that was towards the north. But the compass, no matter which direction he moved it, still pointed at the \"N\". Richard tried again to make the compass work, by shaking it, and smacking it against his palm. The black arrow never pointed anywhere but to the wrong direction. \"Huh,\" Richard whispered, putting the compass sullenly back on the desk. \"A compass that doesn't work. Figures.\" He was just about to turn around, to pull the covers back from his bed, when Richard saw the book that Mr. Dewey had recommended to him from the library. It was falling out from the front flap of his bag, with the many dog-eared pages sticking out from the cover. What was that Mr. Dewey had said about the compass, and reading a book? Curiosity seized Richard once more, and he pulled the book from halfway between the zippers. He switched on the desk lamp, and opened the front cover as he sat down, with the compass glowing bright beside him in the light. Sweeping his hair from his face, he read the front page. The Wizard of Oz L. Frank Baum Richard blinked twice. Had Mr. Dewey really given him The Wizard of Oz as a recommendation? He hadn't known that the old librarian would make such a simple suggestion, but still, it didn't surprise him that he was given a classic. He knew the story well enough. Dorothy, the girl in the blue gingham dress, and Toto, her dog, are taken away to Oz, where they meet all kinds of strange creatures, all the while working to defeat the Wicked Witch of the West, after Dorothy's farmhouse lands on the witch of the East. An interesting enough read, he guessed. His heart pounding, Richard turned the next page, and started to glaze over the words. Slowly, but surely, the story started to take shape within his mind. He read of the wide-open, grey prairie, with Dorothy's lonely house in the midst of it all; Uncle Henry and Aunt Em were not quite the most joyful people, but Toto always made Dorothy's sweet laughter ring through the land. Then there was the twister, which took Dorothy's house away from the dreary Kansas, and finally, to the enchanted land of Oz, in the middle of the Munchkin City. That was as far as he got, before he started to nod off, his head falling to his desk, with his hand folded over the yellowing pages of the book. But before Richard felt himself fall thoroughly to sleep, he jolted himself back up. In that instant, he didn't need to look at his bedside clock to guess what time it was. The heaviness of the late night was all around him, and he decided getting into his pajamas would be a good idea. Richard pushed out his chair and grabbed the silver compass, placing it on the open pages to mark where he was. When the silver surface touched the aging paper, the front cover immediately stuck to the compass like a magnet. But Richard was already opening his pajama drawer while that happened behind his back. Reaching inside, Richard plucked out a pair of striped pajama bottoms, but he stopped suddenly. He peered curiously at the wood of his dresser where, slowly, a shadow of his form started to take shape, against a gentle blue glow from behind him. But what could be glowing that color in his room? He didn't turn anything on, and there was really nothing that exact color in there, except for the compass. The compass. Dropping his pajamas, Richard turned around, and gasped, hard enough to constrict his throat, at what he saw. On his desk, the open compass was glowing the unusual shade of a silvery, icy blue. Where it stuck to the book's pages, the words were swimming, like the page was underwater. Tiny sparkles of white were fluttering like fairy dust around the cover, twirling in increasingly complex moves, while the face of the compass shone brighter than ever. Lines of white light crawled over the pages, and all over Richard's desk, spreading in patterns as intricate as spider-webs. Richard, paralyzed where he was, hesitated to move towards the strange object, but when he did, he saw that the compass's arrow was ticking around the perimeter of the face, like a clock hand. It never really spun- it just clicked at a second's interval. When the arrow finally hit the \"N\", the compass stopped glowing, and Richard's desk light went out.[Chapter 3] Chapter 3 That instant of darkness was longer than Richard ever imagined a moment without light to be. It felt like his bedroom had altogether disappeared, and there was nothing left in the world but a powerful, cold draft. It instantly brought a scream to the back of his lips, straining at his throat, before he thought to make a grab for the compass. But his hands fumbled around fruitlessly in the darkness, before he absolutely couldn't stand the suspense anymore. \"Hello?\" he cried out on instinct, before thinking about what could possibly have happened. Then, the light slowly began to come back, along with the warmth of the world; that was, whatever had happened to the world when it was dark. And with the light, there came a gentle blinking of an icy blue haze, like a spotlight through dirty water. Richard didn't think twice about following the light, as he wanted to get back to normality as quick as he could. Reaching out, he was surprised that he had plucked the light from out of midair, but the haze felt hard and metallic. That was because the compass had been there, hovering in midair like a flying saucer. \"What is this?\" Richard asked, looking deep into the compass's face, which was still glowing but not ticking its black arrow. In fact, the arrow was just trembling again, pointing towards the \"E\". To make sure he wasn't just seeing that, Richard walked in a whole other direction, watching the arrow keenly. The ornate arrowhead quivered shortly, before it turned to point another way. \"It works,\" Richard breathed. But his breath was instantly lost again when he looked up from the compass. The light had returned to the world around him, but he didn't see his bedroom walls anymore. Instead, he was in the middle of several patches of green grass, and trees that were bursting in bloom with exotic-looking fruits. Flowers lined a long, deep blue bank that flowed just nearby, their petals pushing outward to the sky in gowns of brilliant colors. The water of the bank whispered beneath the flowers like a child singing itself to sleep. The sky was cloudless, although broken just beyond by a couple of mountains. \"Wow,\" was all Richard could say. But then, the compass got hot in Richard's hands, and he jumped back a step, letting go of the compass. In an instant, he prepared himself for the crash, shutting his eyes and tensing his hands, but he didn't hear a peep from below. The compass rose with a low shing sound, glowing bright yellow while it hovered just inches from Richard's contorted face. When Richard felt a gusty wave of heat brush his face, he opened his eyes to see the compass hanging in midair with its chain waving around, like a tail. Carefully, Richard reached out and took the compass back into his hands. \"Did this thing make my face hot?\" he wondered aloud, not taking his eyes off the twitching arrow. As if in response, the compass blinked white, the light moving up and down the face as though the light were one giant eyelid. \"Hmm,\" Richard murmured, moving carefully to stick the compass into his pocket. But suddenly, he felt a searing burning when the silver surface touched the denim of his jeans, and he flinched back, glaring in frustration. \"Geez, fine,\" he said, keeping the compass out in his closed hand. Richard let out a long sigh, and squeezed the compass tentatively. He looked around, confused, wherever the silver instrument had taken him; he had no idea he would end up with such a sensitive compass. Maybe he should have asked Mr. Dewey if any of his three book friends were checked in again. Fantasy would be pretty happy to be back in such a pretty place, and Horror would have fun romping through those flowers. Though, Richard couldn't be very sure about Adventure; there probably wouldn't be enough lusty danger for him. Sighing again, Richard turned on his heel and walked towards the edge of the riverbank. He was about to lean over to look into the pretty, blue water, when he heard the loud creaking of a door, not too far away from where he kneeled down. The compass glowed a bright yellow again, looking like a tangible beacon inside of Richard's fingers. Not very far from him, there was a tiny, ratty farmhouse, which rested atop a short stump of grass, starting to dismantle in some places. A pile of fraying shingles lay near the grey farmhouse door, where a young girl, in a gingham blue dress and sparkling silver shoes, accompanied by a little black dog, was walking out. Richard heard a low clicking in the door, before the girl turned around, placed the key into her pocket, and started away from the house. Before Richard could react to noticing her, her eyes turned towards his, and she yelped, almost dropping her basket, and stumbling backwards onto her behind. The black dog barked loudly enough to scare away some birds in a nearby tree. \"Oh, I'm so very sorry,\" the girl said, putting down her basket, and readjusting her pink sunbonnet. \"Are…are you a Munchkin too?\" \"No,\" Richard said, getting to his feet. \"I'm Richard. I actually just got here. But, I think I might know just where I am.\" \"I do,\" said the girl. \"You and I are in Oz, in the part where the Wicked Witch of the East used to live. My name is Dorothy.\" She gave Richard a gentle grin, before she leaned down and stroked the wiry black fur of her dog. \"Toto, no, please don't bark like that anymore! This is Richard. He will not hurt you.\" Toto barked once, but then wagged his tail, panting sweetly towards Dorothy. \"Where do you come from?\" Dorothy asked, standing back up. \"I didn't see you when I met the Munchkins a few moments ago.\" Richard hesitated to answer, eyeing the glowing compass in his hand. \"I…I don't really know,\" he finally said. \"But, I guess, if you're willing to believe me…\" \"I'd like to hear,\" Dorothy said, folding her hands together over her basket handle. \"Suppose you were blown here by a cyclone, like I was?\" \"No, no!\" Richard blurted, remembering all too well how afraid he was of those. \"It was the compass. Here, you see? It's glowing now.\" He held out his hand, and uncurled his fingers to reveal the glowing compass, its lid closed over the face. \"Oh, my,\" Dorothy gasped, putting her hand over her lips and leaning closer. Richard then pried open the lid, and the magical face of the compass glowed back at Dorothy, with a few blinks of yellowish light. \"Goodness,\" Dorothy breathed, reaching out a finger. The closer she approached the compass, the brighter it shone against her curious face. And the minute she touched it, she shuddered, looking at first to be a little uncomfortable. \"You okay?\" Richard asked. \"It's very warm,\" Dorothy noted after a second, stroking her finger across the surface of the face. \"It feels like the sun is reaching down from the heavens, and…taking my hand. It's one of the most amazing things I've ever felt.\" \"Really?\" Richard was holding the compass, and he didn't feel like the sun was patting his hand. Well, that figured; the compass had almost burned him when he tried to put it in his pocket. \"Yes,\" Dorothy answered surely. \"Who gave it to you?\" \"A librarian I know.\" And then as Richard spoke, his voice swelled with some kind of enlightenment. Once more, he remembered Mr. Dewey's face when he had handed over the compass, and how anxious he seemed for Richard to take it and use it. Maybe this was what the old librarian had been talking about, although the compass had been so ordinary in his hands. Richard could now imagine why that had been- he was now literally going into a book, and a book that Mr. Dewey had chosen for Richard to read. Right after he had gotten the compass. \"What…? What am I doing in here?\" Richard whispered, half to himself. \"I'm sorry?\" Dorothy asked, snapping Richard out of his thoughts. \"Nothing, that was nothing,\" Richard answered quickly, snapping the compass closed. \"So, um…you were on your way?\" He smiled weakly at Dorothy, pulling the compass back to his side. \"Oh, yes,\" she replied, pointing off towards the yellow brick road amongst all the other trails leading all around Oz. \"You see, Richard, Toto and I were about to start our journey to the Emerald City. The Good Witch of the North has told us that the Wizard there will take us back home, to Kansas. Would you like to come with us?\" \"Well, now that you mention it, maybe…I should,\" Richard said sheepishly, before he glanced at the compass. \"There might not be much else that I can do here, anyway.\" Dorothy smiled. \"And you know, if we ever lose our way, your compass will help,\" she stated. \"Perhaps if we should get cold during the night, its light can keep us warm.\" \"Uh-huh, sure,\" Richard said. He stole a kind of helpless look at the compass, which was slowly losing its yellow glow. He didn't quite know what that meant, but he doubted that he could command the magic of this compass on a whim. Clearly, it was sensitive to being handled in such a way. But, maybe Dorothy could do something; at least it warmed up to her. \"Come along,\" Dorothy said to Toto, while she and her dog started towards the yellow brick road, which, Richard began to notice, was actually littered with piles of books beneath the trees. He couldn't help but think: \"Well, now I know that I'm definitely not in my bedroom anymore.\" Before Richard caught up to Dorothy, he carefully tried to slip the compass into his pocket. Yet again he felt the burning sensation starting up between his fingers, and he darted the compass in front of his face. He felt like he was being growled at by a cranky dog. \"Come on, could you please cool down a little?\" he asked his reflection in the silver lid, although he felt a little ridiculous doing so. \"I don't know if I can hold you the whole way to the Emerald City.\" It was a long moment before the compass flared up, but then gradually made its glow fade away to an angelic gold, and the almost-harsh warmth it had before was now dying down. Though Richard didn't quite feel the sunny warmth that Dorothy had described, he was satisfied with the fact that at least the compass could take requests. So, slipping the compass into his jeans pocket, Richard jumped off after Dorothy, all the while wondering what sorts of peculiar things Mr. Dewey might have in mind for him inside this tale. While he wasn't that afraid, he just hoped he wouldn't find the Witch lurking in the trees…[Chapter 4] Chapter 4 For several hours Richard and Dorothy strode down the road, which seemed to glimmer under the glow of Dorothy's silver shoes. Many times, Richard found himself staring at the shoes for as long as fifty paces down the road. They were gorgeous; just the kind of shoes that maybe a princess of Oz might wear. Suddenly he wondered: is there a princess in Oz? It was a great and vast country, so surely there had to be a king or a lord of sorts ruling over everything. The thought struck him so quickly that he opened his mouth to ask Dorothy, when he remembered that Dorothy was as much of a newcomer to Oz as he was. \"Oh, what beautiful countryside,\" Dorothy said, as they walked through a long line of strange-looking houses. There were blue fences, with large fields of grain and vegetables, surrounding the houses, which were all painted the exact same dainty blue. One after the other, the Munchkins were coming out through their doors, and bowing low, as though they were greeting a king, and not a usual little girl like Dorothy. Still she tried to smile back at each bowing Munchkin as they came, as did Richard, though he still felt strange in these parts. After they had been passing the Munchkin houses for a long time, Richard took out the compass, which glowed lemonade pink, feeling more than just a little lukewarm in Richard's palm. \"Hey, I'm sorry,\" Richard said to the silver instrument. \"I don't know what you want, so can you please try to cooperate with me?\" The compass soothed its pink light, which slowly faded to grey. Richard sighed, and dropped his arm to his side again, clasping the compass in a loose grip, as though he was about to drop it. His fingers slowly started to draw away from the compass, finally holding it by the chain, dangling beside Richard like a metal purse. \"Goodness, Richard, this is getting to be a long walk,\" Dorothy soon said, looking back at him. \"And look. The sun is starting to set.\" Richard followed Dorothy's pointed finger past the trees and mountains, where the sky was a coral pink, meeting with the shifting blue color of the late afternoon sky. Richard blinked twice at the sky, where now, the sun was falling behind a mountain, making thousands of golden rays span around, like a circular fan in the sky. \"Whoa,\" Richard murmured. \"How…how long have we been walking down this road?\" The compass warmed up quickly, and it blinked on and off continuously, until Richard pried the lid open. To his surprise, the face of the compass lifted to reveal another circular slab of marble beneath it. A clock face, just as ornate as the compass itself, stared back at Richard, the hands of the clock ticking gently. \"Wow, it's getting late!\" Richard said, accidentally snapping the compass closed in alarm; it glowed a bright red, searing Richard's hand so that he had to pass it to the other one. As if on cue, Dorothy slowed her pace, and exhaled deeply. \"Phew,\" she whispered. \"I don't know how much further I can walk, Richard. And if you say it's getting to be late, maybe we should stop to rest.\" \"Why don't we?\" Richard agreed, all too quick to sit down on a rock on the side of the road. But he shot back up when something sharp poked him in the behind; the rock was made entirely out of book spines, the cover corners poking up to the sky. Richard stood up so quickly, that the compass brushed against the rocks with a bang. But when the silver surface touched it, the rocks glowed the same bright silvery white, and then broke apart into several pieces. And when the pieces stopped glowing, they had been transformed into hardcover books, with boldly colored titles and yellowed pages. Dorothy jumped before she ran to the transformed rocks, but her eyes shone with wonder. \"Oh, Richard, look what these are! The compass has changed the rock into books.\" Richard held the compass to his eyes by its chain. It glowed yellow, but didn't send off any waves of gentle heat. He observed the smooth silver surface again, but he certainly didn't see it the same way as before. \"This thing tells you where you are, it tells the time, and now it can make rocks into books!\" he muttered. \"Hmm. What else can you do?\" \"I can't believe it,\" Dorothy said while she glanced over some of the books. She put down her basket, and sat down to open the front covers, while Toto trotted and panted excitedly beside her. \"That's such a remarkable compass. I wish I had one like that back in Kansas.\" \"If you think that it will like you enough,\" Richard muttered. \"How strange,\" Dorothy whispered. She was thumbing through the pages of a book, which Richard noticed was titled, The Marvelous Land of Oz . \"It's a story all about Oz. Hmm, I wonder why some books about Oz might be lying around here.\" Richard looked back at the compass. \"You want us to read about Oz?\" he asked sincerely. The compass glowed yellow, and it stayed that way, before Richard decided to kneel down and look at the book Dorothy was holding. Over her shoulder, he watched while she flipped through the pages faster. Dorothy's eyes skimmed over the words, and sometimes she ran her finger along the lines while she read them. There were many pictures accompanying the chapters, and those were where Dorothy stopped most often. There were several peculiar drawings, but where Dorothy halted her turning the pages was when she noticed a tall, slim creature with the head of a pumpkin. There was a face carved into the pumpkin, automatically reminding Richard of a jack o' lantern from Halloween. \"That's certainly a strange looking thing,\" Dorothy noted, pointing to the picture. \"What do you suppose that is?\" Richard held the glowing compass towards the page to read, in the growing dim of twilight. He found a passage near the bottom of the page, and he began to read aloud, \"' I must give him a name,' he cried. \"So good a man as this must surely have a name. I believe,' he added, after a moment's thought, \"I will name the fellow 'Jack Pumpkinhead'!'\". Then suddenly, Dorothy shrieked, while the book started to vibrate, and tumbled to the ground out of her hands. From out of the pages, shot a giant pumpkin, with the facial features of a jack o' lantern, and an entire body to go with it, leaving the book behind to tremble and shake. Richard and Dorothy looked up at the great stick figure that had emerged in front of them, who stumbled around just a little while getting his bearings. Finally, he stood still and twisted his pumpkin head the right way with a low crunching. This peculiar creature wore purple pants, a red shirt, a vest with white polka dots, and long stockings sticking up from his shoes. \"Uh…hello,\" said Dorothy first, standing up and trying to give a sure grin to the pumpkin-headed thing. The creature turned its head, and looked down upon Dorothy. Then it waved its hand jovially at her, its pumpkin face widening happily. \"Oh, hello,\" it said, in a low, but warm, voice. \"Where did you come from? As I recall, you weren't here a moment ago.\" It turned its head around, and frowned helplessly. \"And neither was I.\" \"You came from out of this,\" Richard explained, picking up the book and holding it out for the pumpkin creature to see. \"You're Jack Pumpkinhead.\" \"I know that I am,\" Jack said, \"it's the name that my creator, Tip, gave me when…\" He stopped, and slapped a hand to his mouth in surprise. \"How did you know?\" \"We read about you,\" Dorothy said gently. \"We didn't know that you would come out of the book.\" \"Are we still in Oz?\" Jack Pumpkinhead asked, looking around once more. \"Yeah,\" Richard answered. \"We're going down the yellow brick road to find the Emerald City.\" \"The Wizard will be there,\" Dorothy continued. \"He's going to use his magic powers to send me and my dog, Toto, back home.\" \"Yes, Tip told me all about the Emerald City,\" Jack said warmly. \"It's in the very center of Oz, where the great Wizard ruled a long time, until a Scarecrow was offered the throne by the people there. Everything there is supposed to be a glorious green.\" But slowly, Jack Pumpkinhead's excited smile drooped, and his shoulders slumped. \"But I fear I may never see the beauty of that place.\" \"What do you mean?\" asked Richard. \"I am color-blind,\" Jack said sullenly. \"Tip and I were once in the Country of the Gillikins, where everything, he said, was purple. I could only see grey. Just like I can now.\" \"How dreadful,\" Dorothy said sadly. \"Well, at least you aren't altogether blind. I can't even imagine what that would be like.\" \"No, I am not,\" Jack agreed, while some light seemed to come back into his hopeless expression. \"My name is Dorothy,\" Dorothy said, smiling up at Jack. Jack perked his head up, like an anxious dog. \"Are you the Dorothy who destroyed the Witch of the East? Who…who came here all the way from the big, outside World?\" \"Yes,\" answered Dorothy. \"Well, then, who is your friend?\" Jack asked. \"I'm Richard,\" he replied. \"I'm from the real world too.\" Jack scratched his head for a moment, as if trying to think harder than ever. \"Were you blown here by a cyclone? Oh, dear me!\" \"No,\" Richard said. \"I came here by this.\" He held up the compass, which instantly glowed sunshine again. \"Oh, my!\" Jack Pumpkinhead exclaimed, shielding his eyes, even though there was no real need to. \"What is that?\" \"It's a…well, I don't know what to call it,\" Richard said, lowering the compass to open the lid. \"It's a compass, but it's also like a pocket watch.\" He hesitated to say the next part. \"It talks to me through light and warmth, too.\" \"Oh, how extraordinary,\" Jack said. \"Did the Wizard give it to you?\" \"I've never met the Wizard,\" Richard said. \"We're on our way to meet him, remember?\" \"Ah, yes, perhaps, but wherever did you get it?\" Jack wanted to know. \"A librarian,\" Richard answered. \"What is a librarian?\" Jack asked, scratching his head again. Dorothy giggled, and reached for Jack's hand. \"Well, why don't we sit down now?\" she asked, having taken a look at the darkened sky, full of stars. \"We're quite tired from our long walk, and you can join us if you want to.\" \"I'd be most delighted, thank you,\" Jack said. \"And then, if you please, you can tell me all about librarians, and what sorts of things they do in the World. But please speak kindly, and slowly. I may get confused.\" Dorothy giggled but Richard only groaned, putting away the compass, and picking up the open copy of The Marvelous Land of Oz from the ground. He followed Dorothy and Jack Pumpkinhead under a thick tree, and sat down, pulling the book open. He sat several inches away from them, so that he could concentrate on his task. He also made sure to read and turn the pages quickly, so no extra characters would come out. He reached into his pocket, and pulled the compass out by its chain. Holding it above the book, the silver light cast its glow onto the yellowing pages. \"If Jack Pumpkinhead wants someone to explain things all the time, I'll give him someone to talk to,\" Richard thought, while he thumbed through the book. He zipped his eyes across every line, searching for a description of a creature with raggedy clothes, a patchy face, and a body stuffed with straw… But soon enough, Richard found himself reading aloud, \"' …To be more explicit, the initials mean that I am Thoroughly Educated'… \" \"Richard, aren't you going to sleep?\" Dorothy asked gently. \"I'm pretty sure it's time for us to rest a little.\" Richard looked over those words so deeply that he didn't hear Dorothy at first. But still, he looked up, and noticed that Dorothy was lying down upon the grass, with Jack Pumpkinhead sitting beside her. He was looking down on her like a careful father, observing her while she closed her eyes. He looked back into the book, and then back to a solemn-but-innocent looking Jack Pumpkinhead. \"Have I got a present for you, Jack,\" Richard whispered, as he set the book down, with the pages still open. With the compass, held by its chain, over the book, Richard watched while the book started to shake and tremble.[Chapter 5] Chapter 5 Once the book had ceased to vibrate like a nervous dog, a large, spindly-fingered hand with white kid-gloves poked out from between the pages. It made a grab for the covers, and hoisted itself out of the book entirely. In the darkness, there was a flash of color of the bright clothes that the creature was wearing, and it was at this moment that Jack Pumpkinhead looked up in alarm. He stood still, and peered at the enormous creature that had escaped from the book. Richard was surprised too. Here before him, was an enormous bug-like creature with two long feelers on either side of his head, that curled in like long pig tails. A long, purple top hat stuck up from between the feelers, crowning a face with two large and buggy eyes; a curly antennae was the nose between the eyes. Around his round belly, he donned a blue-and-yellow coat, with a starched-white waistcoat beneath it. He wore no pants, but from the calf-below, his legs were black-and-brown striped, like stockings. \"Oh, dear,\" the creature spoke up. Unlike Jack's, its voice was high and squeaky, just as one might have expected an insect to talk. \"Dorothy! Dorothy!\" Jack cried, shaking Dorothy's shoulders. \"Wake up!\" Dorothy yawned as she stretched awake from the grass, with Toto following her lead. She grumbled sleepily as Jack struggled to awaken her. \"What's the matter, Jack?\" she asked, rubbing her eyes. \"Young Richard is truly an unmarked Sorcerer,\" Jack exclaimed. \"Look at what he has brought from the storybook!\" Dorothy sat up and looked before her at the life-size insect standing proudly between her and Richard. \"Good evening, child,\" the bug spoke again. \"Oh, my!\" Dorothy and Jack exclaimed at the same time. \"Oh, no need for alarm, please,\" said the bug, bowing and tipping his hat. \"Indeed, I hope that you are enjoying excellent health. Permit me to present my card to you.\" Reaching into the pocket of his coat, the bug handed Dorothy a tiny index card, and she strained to read it in the dark. \"Richard,\" she acknowledged, crawling over to hand the card to him. He held up the compass, and read the card by its light. \"'Mr. H.M. Wogglebug T.E.,'\" he said. \"And I am also wonderfully pleased to meet you, good boy,\" the Wogglebug said, bowing once more. \"That is, if I may inquire your name?\" \"I'm Richard, Mr. Wogglebug,\" he said. \"And that's Dorothy, and Jack Pumpkinhead.\" At his mentioning them, both Dorothy and Jack stood up, curtsying and bowing in turn. Toto barked nervously, but he didn't cower. Dorothy picked her dog up in her arms. \"Excuse me, sir, but I've never seen a bug like you before,\" she said. Have…have you always been as tall as a real man?\" \"That, child, is a long and extraordinary story,\" Wogglebug said, winking at Dorothy. \"If you wish to know it all, well, I suppose I shall sit down and tell you. May I do so?\" \"Please do,\" Dorothy said, patting the spot beside her. Wogglebug then sat down on the grass with them, and started to speak, while Richard scooted closer to both hear the story, and to observe a little more about this amazing insect. \"I was once an ordinary Wogglebug, my friends,\" he said, if a bit regretfully, though his voice was by no means unpleasant. \"I shall not go into what life was like before, for it is, in my opinion, most unfavorable. I was cold, and I was lonely. But that all came to a glorious halt the day I wandered into a schoolhouse- the schoolhouse, that is, of Professor Nowitall, no doubt the most famous scholar in all of Oz. \"I enjoyed my time in that schoolhouse, for my new home, near the fireplace, was a hundredfold more than what the summer sun had ever given me. But what is more important, is that I had good access to all the lessons given by the professor. Day after day, I listened to him speak of the wonders of our world, and I found that acquiring such knowledge was a marvelous feeling, beyond anything I'd ever experienced.\" \"And that is why you are thoroughly educated, isn't it?\" Richard interrupted. \"What the 'T.E' in your name means.\" \"Precisely,\" Wogglebug said, nodding his head in acknowledgement. \"It's an expression of my degree. And I'm proud to say that there may never be another wogglebug like me, with such knowledge and initiative.\" Wogglebug paused before he continued. \"Now, you shall find out what it was that made me so much larger than any Wogglebug you've ever seen before. \"You see, I was crawling along the hearth one day, and before I could get away, Professor Nowitall had caught me in his fingers. He asked the class, if perhaps they had ever seen a wogglebug before. And promptly, after every student had answered that they hadn't, he placed me under a magnifying glass, where the students could see me. At which point, when the Professor presented me, I had become as highly magnified as the students saw me.\" He stopped speaking for a moment, and scratched a finger against his head thoughtfully. \"Although, my size must have frightened the students, for two girls sitting on a windowsill had fallen out into the grass. And while everyone was racing over to retrieve the girls, I saw my chance to escape. I hopped off the table, and ran away into a grove of trees nearby. I haven't set foot in that schoolhouse, since.\" \"That is an extraordinary venture,\" Jack remarked. \"It's fortunate indeed, Mr. Wogglebug, that you have been granted such brains. I wish that I could have had such an opportunity.\" Wogglebug looked towards Jack Pumpkinhead, grinning. \"Thank you for that kind remark, my good friend, but you know, you are not so unfortunate as you think. Granted, you carry many, many seeds in your pumpkin head. I suppose you should be thanking that your creator didn't carve out your head; otherwise you probably would not be able to tell that I sit beside you and your friends.\" \"That is true,\" Jack noted. \"Brains in general terms are a good thing to come by, I suppose, even if they are not as magnificent as yours.\" Dorothy, who had been sitting so very quietly throughout Wogglebug's speech, finally perked up her head, her eyes widening for a second. \"Mr. Wogglebug?\" she said. \"Yes?\" asked the Wogglebug. \"Since you have such more knowledge about Oz, than any of us do, do you think you could join us on our trip to the Emerald City?\" Wogglebug scratched his head thoughtfully again. \"Well, my child, I must confess, I never considered going there before. I've heard all about the Emerald City, but it would surely make for a fantastic journey.\" \"Yeah,\" Richard piped up, suddenly. \"If you know all about the places and creatures in Oz, you could help us make the safest route on the yellow brick road.\" \"I am equipped with swift thought,\" Wogglebug noted. \"Exactly,\" Richard said. \"And speaking of weird and unusual things, do you think you can tell me about this ?\" He reached beside him, and held up, by its chain, the compass. Wogglebug gasped, and touched one finger to the compass, as though gently pointing to it. \"Indeed, my boy, this is an object of awesome magic,\" he said, noting the tender glow and the warmth of the silver. \"But you must be a boy of great magical expertise to have obtained something like this.\" \"No, I'm not,\" Richard answered. \"I mean, I know that this thing speaks somehow through how warm it is, and what color the light is around it. But, I don't know just where it came from, or where Mr. Dewey might have gotten it.\" \"Who is Mr. Dewey?\" Wogglebug wondered aloud. \"The old librarian who gave this to me,\" Richard said and, when Wogglebug leaned closer in fascination, he relayed to the giant insect, Mr. Dewey's instructions on using the compass, how Richard had come into Oz, and his confusion regarding the purpose of having come, with the compass in hand. Wogglebug sat thoughtfully, his buggy eyes turning towards the compass, while he didn't move the rest of his body. He stood that way long enough, that finally, Jack and Dorothy moved to be sure that he hadn't blanked out altogether. Richard had to lower the compass as his arm grew tired, finally clunking the compass back onto the grass; its light turned pink again. \"My boy, I'm afraid I can't say such a device is familiar to me,\" Wogglebug said. \"Of course, its magical ability is clear, but I've never seen its equal. Nowitall never taught his students magic, as only the Witches of the North and South know how. However, there is an essence of life within the silver- that much anyone can say for certain.\" Dorothy leaned suddenly against the tree, and put her hand over her mouth to stifle a yawn. \"I'm sorry, Mr. Wogglebug,\" she said, \"but why don't we talk more about this on our walk to the Emerald City, tomorrow.\" Finally, she fell to the ground, and cuddled her legs up to her chest. Wogglebug nodded respectfully. \"I suppose you are right, Dorothy, child,\" he said. \"Once we have been able to rest, I shall explain further the matter of the boy's compass. And, also, perhaps you could explain how I came to be with you all, from out of thin air.\" Richard sighed deeply, half-moaning. He pushed the book towards Wogglebug, and laid himself down upon the ground near Dorothy and Jack Pumpkinhead. \"Look into it, if you want,\" Richard offered. \"But be careful; something might pop out at you any minute.\" He cringed at the thought of more random characters coming out, when he closed his eyes; Toto trotted up, and lay down between him and Dorothy. Wogglebug smiled gently at Richard. \"I think that perhaps I can take such a responsibility,\" he replied. \"But, if I am to journey the long way with you all to the Emerald City, it wouldn't be prudent to get too far in. Though, I should like to.\" \"Whatever you decide, Mr. Wogglebug,\" Richard murmured. Wogglebug looked at all his sleeping friends, and slowly laid the book on the ground beside him. Then he lay down on his back, and looked up at the dim stars far above him, while he slowly closed his huge eyes to sleep. \"Mr. Wogglebug?\" Jack Pumpkinhead's voice suddenly asked. \"Yes, what is it, my friend?\" Wogglebug replied, turning his head to look at Jack. \"I was thinking; if we all go to the Emerald City, and I were to ask the Wizard for a wish, would he grant it, as well as Dorothy's?\" \"Oh, I'm quite certain he will,\" Wogglebug said softly. \"If there's anything about the Wizard that I know, is that he will surely do his best for others.\" \"I hope,\" Jack said in a low, solemn voice. \"For, if Dorothy says that Oz is as pretty a place as anywhere, I should like to have color brought to my eyes. I want to walk out of the Emerald City, with grey out of my sight, for good.\"[Chapter 6] Chapter 6 The following morning, Richard, Dorothy, and their new friends were on the road quickly. All the way down the road, Mr. Wogglebug talked of his adventures since leaving the schoolhouse, and what sorts of things they might come across on their way to the Emerald City. Jack Pumpkinhead walked lankily beside Wogglebug, asking of his assurance that he would get his wish from the Wizard. Wogglebug only gently tapped Jack on his shoulders, and told him to be patient. Richard stayed at the back of the group, with the compass floating beside him, clutching the copy of The Marvelous Land of Oz . He tried to take careful note of their surroundings, as it was all so glorious, and that he wanted to know where to go back to the Munchkin City, in case the Wizard couldn't grant their wishes. At one point, he had to explain this logic to Dorothy, and she had to keep from laughing. \"Richard, how can you think like that?\" she wanted to know. \"If the Wizard is as kind as the Sorceress from the South said, then surely we can't be mistaken.\" \"I'm just trying to be safe,\" Richard explained. Wogglebug turned to face Richard. \"You can't doubt what no one is absolutely sure about,\" he said surely. \"The key is to be optimistic, my good friend.\" \"Well said, Mr. Wogglebug,\" Jack said humbly. Richard didn't say anything, only shrugging. \"Unfortunately, the same can be said for your compass,\" Wogglebug said softly. \"I've been contemplating this situation as we've been walking, and it's still extremely difficult to place what this thing could possibly be.\" \"Even with your superior knowledge…?\" Jack asked, a little hopelessly. \"Afraid so,\" said Wogglebug. \"As I've said, it's something only a great Wizard or a great Sorceress can work on their own knowledge. In a way, we are like young children with a complex, brand-new vehicle on the streets of New York City. Who knows what we could walk into?\" Jack gave Wogglebug a look that seemed to say he was standing in the presence of a god. \"What kind of a place is New York City?\" he wondered aloud. \"The most bustling city in the United States of America, my friend,\" Wogglebug explained. \"Actually, it would not surprise me a bit to think that this compass came to be in such a place. There are so many kinds of people there, nothing is ever the same two days in a row.\" Richard shook his head. \"Um, Mr. Wogglebug, I really don't think this compass came from New York. It would have to come from somewhere in this world, because there is no magic in my world.\" Mr. Wogglebug craned his head to look at Richard. \"Maybe that's because you have never seen real magic in your world,\" he said. \"It's easy to believe that things don't exist because you have never seen them, my young boy. That's why we must keep open minds, no matter what world we are in.\" Jack nodded, as did Dorothy. \"But, I can only hope we reach the Emerald City soon,\" Dorothy stated, brushing some stray hair behind her ears. \"My Aunt Em and Uncle Henry must be so worried right now.\" \"Never fear of that, my dear,\" Wogglebug said sweetly. \"Since you have saved our land from the Witch of the East, we at least owe you a way back to your home.\" Dorothy smiled. And so the group walked on, but, despite the bright sun, the countryside they walked through became dismal and dark. There were fewer houses that they walked past, and less people to greet. Even Wogglebug, who walked forth with a confident smile upon his face, looked kind of disheartened. \"Surely Oz once looked so lovely right here,\" he said. No one spoke again while they moved through the land, gradually coming upon a forest, which was divided by a great ditch in the road. There were rocks at the bottom of the ditch, and was wide enough that they couldn't merely step across it. Dorothy shivered in her shoes, nearly dropping her basket. \"What shall we do?\" Wogglebug shook his head, as did Jack Pumpkinhead. \"For…if we tried to jump, we might surely be killed,\" Wogglebug said thoughtfully. \"My exoskeleton cannot likely withstand those rocks, and we can't risk letting the compass get dented.\" Richard gulped at such a thought. \"Well, then…what is there to do?\" asked Jack nervously. As the group pondered, Richard noticed that the compass was glowing a bright pink, as if it were agitated by something. It tugged hard at Richard, struggling against the hand that held it close. Richard pulled back at the compass's chain, to get it back under control, before suddenly, he was lifted high into the air, held only by the compass chain. Dorothy and the others looked up at Richard, who was floating in the air, screaming blue murder at this unexpected behavior. \"Richard!\" Dorothy yelped. \"What is happening?\" \"Why would I know?\" Richard asked, waving his arms frantically. \"No. Stop!\" Wogglebug exclaimed. \"I believe we may have found a solution to our problem.\" \"How, Mr. Wogglebug, sir?\" Jack asked meekly. \"It's easy,\" explained Wogglebug. \"The compass can carry Richard high into the air, and then hold him there—for how long, I can't be sure—perhaps a few hours at a time. Now then, what if we could all hold onto each other, as the compass hauls us up and over the ditch? That way we have an easier means of travel, and we will be safe from whatever other dangers might await us on the ground.\" \"It's worth a try,\" said Jack eagerly. \"Richard, come down, please!\" Dorothy called to her friend, and just as quickly, Richard was lowered down by the compass. He held on tight, and then, Dorothy took hold of Richard's hand, placing Toto in her basket. Jack and Wogglebug took hold as well, and Richard tugged on the compass's chain. As if it were lifting only him again, the compass carried the group high over the ditch. Richard was also quite shocked; aside from holding onto Dorothy, it felt as if he were hardly carrying anything—Jack Pumpkinhead and Mr. Wogglebug were almost as light as feathers, making this quick new journey easier on his arms. Richard breathed deeply, watching the land that the compass flew them over. The compass wrapped its chain tightly around his fingers, so as not to let go, as Richard scanned the countryside. The forest—from which he heard several different roars—was vast, but beyond, he could see the markings of a field of flowers. It was just as vast as the forest, but much more fertile, and colorful. Trees lined the yellow brick road, swinging with exotic-looking fruits, and from below him, Richard heard Dorothy moan with pleasure seeing such delicious fruits. Finally, the compass dropped them behind the forest, just at the start of the road that ran through this new brand of country. Everyone in the group had to slit their eyes just to see three feet in front of them, so bright were the colors of the flowers. \"I can't believe this,\" Dorothy said, in utter rapture. \"I don't know if I've ever seen such beautiful colors before. We never had flowers like these back in Kansas.\" \"We don't even have these kinds of flowers in my neighborhood,\" said Richard, remembering all the prize-winning gardens his neighbors planted, some of which had included some pretty fantastic flowers. But the poppies in the grass outdid those petty things rather immensely. \"Come, one and all, let's not dilly-dally,\" said Wogglebug cheerily. \"We are one step closer towards reaching the Emerald City, and having our greatest wishes granted.\" \"Quite right, Mr. Wogglebug,\" said Jack Pumpkinhead excitedly, and he started an awkward stride onto the road surrounded by the flowers. The rest of the group followed Jack, but the moment that Dorothy and Richard stepped upon the road, a spell of drowsiness—stronger than any other—hit them over the head, like an off-target baseball. Richard instantly felt as if he hadn't slept in days, although he slept fine the previous night. His eyes started to fall closed, staggering on his feet. Dorothy had the same reaction, as she stumbled towards the soft flowers. \"Dorothy! Richard!\" exclaimed Wogglebug, just as Dorothy and Toto fell asleep upon the flowers. He stretched his arms to pick up the girl, but he struggled immensely, only managing to make Dorothy roll over in the plants. \"What's happening…to us?\" Richard asked, before he found himself collapsing into the grass. \"The flowers,\" Wogglebug quickly realized. \"There are so many of them, that their scent is casting powerfully upon you—in the equivalent of a witch's spell. Oh. Oh, my. This is not at all good!\" He shot up, and directed his voice at Jack Pumpkinhead. \"Come and help me, Jack! We must get Richard and Dorothy out of here before they lose their stores of strength!\" Jack turned his head around and, at hearing Wogglebug's call, scrambled towards him. When he did, he found that he had as much luck lifting the children from the ground as Wogglebug had. But with some effort, Wogglebug and Jack were able to get the children to their feet, as the compass wrung its chain around Richard and Dorothy's wrists to keep them standing upright. Wogglebug eyed his children friends wearily. \"I know not how much longer we can keep them going this way,\" he said to Jack. \"Much less, how much farther we have before we reach the Emerald City.\" \"It can't be too far, can it?\" asked Jack. \"Doubtless, my friend. Doubtless,\" replied Wogglebug. \"But for now, all that's left to do, is get somewhere safe before anything else happens.\"[Chapter 7] Chapter 7 It was a long struggle for Wogglebug and Jack Pumpkinhead, to carry Richard and Dorothy all the way through the poppy field. Wogglebug, being a living, breathing creature, found he couldn't survive against the smells of the poppies, so his eyes drooped more often than not. Fortunately for Jack, being made of cloth and a pumpkin, couldn't sense the smells as much as his insect friend, so he didn't feel sleepy at all. But his lanky limbs didn't make helping Wogglebug easy. By the time they had escaped the poppy field, all four of the friends were asleep in the grass under a tender tree, resting the remainder of the day, the whole night, and far into the morning of the next day. Dorothy, the first to fall asleep, was the first to arise when the dawn came. She stretched and yawned, wiping the dirt and leaves from her gingham dress. Beside her, Toto opened his mouth in a yawn, crossing the grass to lick Richard's face. Stirring restlessly, Richard wiped the slobber from his cheeks, rising up from the ground, followed by the compass. Dorothy giggled as Toto trotted back to her, and she handed him a little sliver of bread to eat for breakfast. \"Morning, Richard,\" Dorothy said gently, as she reached into her basket. She took out another piece of bread, this time spreading it with butter. \"Here, have some breakfast.\" Richard took the bread from Dorothy, biting into it. He smacked his lips in light of putting something into his stomach, for he hadn't realized how hungry he had become. \"Thanks, Dorothy,\" he said between bites, to which Dorothy only nodded and smiled. Mr. Wogglebug soon awakened, followed by Jack Pumpkinhead. Dorothy offered bread to both of them, and Wogglebug was too happy to oblige, though Jack refrained from eating, mentioning that since he was only an animate object, he did not need to have breakfast. Throughout their meal, Wogglebug spoke to both Richard and Dorothy, making certain that they felt all right after succumbing to the smelly spell of the poppies. To his surprise, neither of the children quite remembered falling asleep; they both simply felt as if they had had a good night's rest. Wogglebug had to breathe a deep sigh of relief, for this meant their adventure could easily move forward. And in any case, the green morning glow of the city beyond brightened the day just a little more. \"Do you see that, everyone?\" said Wogglebug. \"The Emerald City is just beyond! No doubt by the end of the day, we can enter through the gates, and see the Wizard.\" \"That would certainly be nice,\" said Jack. \"Why, I think I can already see the lovely green the city is made from.\" \"Keep on dreaming, my friend,\" said the Wogglebug. \"Surely, we are that close.\" Once the group had finished eating, they continued down the road, led by Wogglebug. The yellow bricks in the road gleamed in the sun, giving everyone in the group a happy, yellowish glow from below. It almost made the compass look wholly yellow, as if it were a merry object for once. And indeed, it seemed like that, for it didn't pull on Richard, or burn his hand that held the chain. Richard smiled, glad that he didn't have to deal with such antics, because he was anxious enough to get to the Emerald City. From where he and his friends stood, they could see the green glow of the walls creeping closer, as they began to pass some rows of houses that were colored the same green as the nearing city walls. At long last, the glimmer of the yellow brick road upon the group was replaced by that of gleaming emerald, because the gates to the city were studded so with brilliant jewels of green. Dorothy went up the gates, and upon noticing a bell, pulled it. The great doors began to open, and promptly, they were greeted by a Munchkin-sized man dressed all in green. Even his skin looked a little green, though he didn't look sick. Rather he looked strange and otherworldly. He skittered up to Richard and his friends, and looked up at each of them in turn. \"Yes, yes, what is it I can do for you all?\" he asked. \"Please, good sir, we would like to see the Wizard,\" answered Dorothy. The little green man stepped back an inch or so. \"The Wizard, right?\" he said. When the company before him nodded, he shook his head, confused. \"I can't remember when last anyone asked to see the Wizard. What sort of favor would you have to ask of him?\" \"Things of tremendous importance, little man,\" said the Wogglebug. \"We all have wishes that it seems only the Wizard can grant. Please believe me when I say that they are not frivolous deeds. Why, one of them is merely to return to a whole other place far away from Oz. Surely you think that the Wizard would be so kind as to grant that favor?\" \"I would like to gain some colored vision,\" Jack Pumpkinhead piped up suddenly. \"That way, I would be able to see how beautiful the Emerald City really is.\" \"Thank you, that sounds like a wonderful idea,\" said the little man quickly. \"Now, I do not know when the Wizard shall see you—if he shall see you. But since it is your wish, you must come in. First, you must have these.\" He gestured to a box he carried beside him, which was filled with pairs of green glasses. He found pairs for all four members of the group, locking them around their heads—so as not to be blinded by the bright green of the city, he explained. And so, the company was led through the Emerald City, and even with their glasses on, the brilliance of the city could not be easily masked. Richard squinted behind his regular glasses, not believing he had ever seen anything so bright or beautiful before. Even the grass growing between the houses could not compare with the grass he knew from home, it was so green and lush. Dorothy especially was glad to see such beauty, after knowing the grey prairies of Kansas her whole life. Jack Pumpkinhead limped alongside them, while the Wogglebug took in the sights. They were all so entranced that they gasped when they were led to a soldier standing erect outside a door. The little guardian who had led the company spoke a few words to the soldier, and then he was gone—to speak with the Wizard himself. They waited anxiously, until the soldier returned, explaining that the Wizard could see them—that was, he would see them individually—in the morning. \"Tomorrow?\" Richard blurted. \"But sir, we only just got here. And it's barely afternoon. Why do we have to see the Wizard tomorrow?\" \"He needs time to prepare for you, I am certain,\" replied the soldier. \"It is not too often that he has such abrupt, and outspoken, guests.\" Richard shook his head, as he stepped up to the soldier. \"Is there any chance he could make it fast? He can't take that long to prepare for us, if we are just going to ask questions.\" \"I cannot say that I disagree with Richard,\" said the Wogglebug. \"Our requests would perhaps take no more than a moment or two to ask, and we will be on our best behavior with the Wizard. We promise we will not make trouble, as we are sure he is a very busy man.\" At this, Jack and Dorothy nodded certainly. \"Do you all have requests?\" asked the soldier. \"I would simply like to return to Kansas,\" said Dorothy. \"And I would wish to change my vision to colored,\" said Jack. Richard and the Wogglebug remained silent. The soldier looked between Dorothy and Jack Pumpkinhead, scratching his chin thoughtfully. \"I do not know for sure, but the Wizard may be able to make an exception for just two wishes. I shall give him the message.\" He went away, and then returned just as quickly as before. And when he came back, he asked if perhaps Dorothy would like to make the first visit. In a moment of pure joy, Dorothy said goodbye to her friends; she had been so excited that her lips barely brushed Richard's cheek. And there at the gate, they were made to stay, but the soldier accommodated them by beckoning for some comfy cushions to be brought to them. And so they plopped down upon their seats, sighing with relief to have come here at last. \"Do you think he will do it?\" asked Jack Pumpkinhead. \"Do you suppose he will really grant Dorothy's wish?\" \"No doubt of it, my friend,\" answered the Wogglebug. \"If he is so wise and great, there is no one else who can do it.\" \"But there is something the Wizard may want us to do,\" said Richard suddenly. Both Jack and Wogglebug looked to him. \"Oh?\" asked Wogglebug. \"And what sort of thing would that be?\" Richard sat up straight and looked at both his friends, choosing his words carefully. \"In order for Dorothy to get what she wants, or I guess what she and Jack want, the Wizard may ask us to do something. And I'm guessing that that something may involve killing the Witch from the West.\" Jack gasped, almost falling over face-first. Wogglebug just stared at Richard, putting a hand to his mouth in utter shock. \"Whatever gave you such an idea, Richard?\" the Wogglebug wanted to know. \"I don't see what the Witch would have to do with any of this.\" \"Neither do I, I just guess the Wizard thinks she should be gone because she is a bad witch or something,\" said Richard. \"It's something that we will have to do so that you guys can get your wishes.\" \"You speak with such certainty,\" noted the Wogglebug. \"Are you certain you are not an expert Sorcerer with the gift of foresight?\" \"I just know these kinds of wishes need something extra,\" Richard explained. Wogglebug looked away from Richard, his eyes far off, as if pondering what he had been told. Richard didn't know if the life-size insect believed him about not being some kind of magician, but he was definitely taking into account what sort of deed they would have to accomplish. \"I still cannot see what the Witch of the West has to do with returning Dorothy home, or transforming Jack's sight,\" noted the Wogglebug, \"but I suppose we shall have to see what Dorothy has to report to us.\"[Chapter 8] Chapter 8 \"Richard, my good boy, you astound me!\" said the Wogglebug suddenly. He and Richard had been discussing tactics for the unexpected proposal of going to kill the Witch of the West. And Richard had mentioned something that had caught both the Wogglebug and Jack Pumpkinhead off guard so much that Jack almost started laughing. The Wogglebug just tapped his finger against his mouth, twitching his antennae thoughtfully. Then, the door next to them flung open, and Dorothy came stumbling through, the rims of her eyes turning pink as she slumped down upon the steps. Wogglebug stood up quickly, followed by Richard and Jack. \"Dear Dorothy,\" exclaimed the Wogglebug. \"What on earth happened? Was it the Wizard? Was he unkind to you?\" Dorothy shook her head as she wiped her hands across her cheeks. \"No, no, Mr. Wogglebug, he was not unkind, although he was truly as terrible as they say he is. He said that we would only get our wishes granted if he we did something for him. We must destroy the Witch of the West.\" At this, the Wogglebug looked from Dorothy to Richard, a certain gleam in his eye that combined both shock, and yet amazement. He then looked to Dorothy, using his finger to wipe any tears falling from her eyes. \"Come and sit down close to us, Dorothy,\" the Wogglebug said gently, helping Dorothy to her feet. \"We have been talking whilst you were with the Wizard, and Richard has proposed a most unusual tactic against the Witch. Actually, he was the first to guess at what the Wizard would ask us to do in order for our desires to come true.\" He turned his gleaming eyes to Richard. \"And it would seem his prediction has come true after all.\" Dorothy also looked at Richard as she was set down beside Jack Pumpkinhead, who also put his arms comfortingly, though clumsily, about her. \"How did you know what he would say?\" she asked. \"How did you ever guess?\" Richard shrugged. \"I've read stories about this place,\" he answered. \"I know these things.\" \"He is a most extraordinary young man,\" Wogglebug praised him. \"But he has stated that the most unusual thing will get rid of the Witch for us. We won't even need to use any weapons or advanced magic against her. We need only to make her touch water, and she shall become like water.\" Dorothy choked on the last of her tears, coughing a little. \"I don't believe it,\" she gasped. \"Is that all we need to do? Please don't tell me you're joking, Richard.\" \"No, no,\" he said. \"We just have to find some way to get to the Witch, and dump a bucket of water on her. As long as we all go to her together.\" \"How can that work?\" pondered Jack Pumpkinhead. \"I never imagined it was that simple to kill a witch.\" \"I suppose we shall only have to see,\" added Wogglebug. \"I cannot imagine Richard wanting to lead us astray, so therefore I will be trusting his word.\" The great insect stood up, looking towards the gates far off in the city. \"Then, why don't we begin our next journey into the West?\" The rest of the group stood up, with Dorothy staying close to the Wogglebug. She had stopped crying, but she was weary from her encounter with the Wizard. Toto barked as if to encourage his mistress to be strong. Jack moved to the other side of Dorothy, smiling down at her when she watched him cross over to her. But he did not forget Richard, for he put an arm around the boy's shoulder, also smiling. Richard blinked back at Jack, before he looked ahead to the gates, where the little green guardian had gone back. Upon the group's arrival, the guardian unclasped their green glasses, and wished them well on the next part of their adventure. As always, they all stayed together, with the Wogglebug taking up the lead, with Richard and the compass behind him. But this time, they took no road. Rather, they walked through the fields, through trees, keeping to the direction of the west while the sun started to set. Occasionally, the Wogglebug would lighten the determined, tense mood of the group by pointing out something of beauteous nature, or anything unusual that he guessed his young friends had never seen before. At one point, he even found a strange but vibrant flower, and gave it to Dorothy to wear in her hair. She gratefully accepted the gift, and often, she would reach up to play with the soft petals, stroking them between her fingers. Each time, she smiled, her cheeks brightened with the setting sun. But the group could not go on walking forever. When the sun had gone down, they picked a soft spot close to a cluster of trees with glorious white flowers sprouting between the fruits, and Dorothy shared her bread once more for supper. Afterwards, the Wogglebug bade Richard and Dorothy to sleep, while he and Jack Pumpkinhead kept watch. And then, from far off in the distance, there came the sound of many pairs of feet bounding through the underbrush. Wogglebug suspected it must be some animal coming through the forest close by, but when he could suddenly see many pairs of eyes glinting through the night, all of which were turning towards him and his friends, he stood up. \"Jack, wake Richard and Dorothy,\" he said. But his command came too late, for there came abounding several great wolves, all snapping and clamping their horrible teeth. Wogglebug reached beside him for a stick, throwing it this way and that to fend off the wolves. Jack was scrambling up into the tree with the white flowers, and was throwing the ripened fruits. But Richard and Dorothy were just awakening, coming to find out what chaos was ensuing around them. Toto started barking, and something small and silver started spinning across the space, causing wolves to fall here and there. Richard backed away from the wolves, while he watched the compass, which had become like a tiny fighting machine, spinning its chain like a whip, and the surface becoming so hot that flames actually spurred from within. It flew so fast that it soon became like a comet, setting whatever it touched on fire. Thinking quickly, Richard raced for the compass, careful not to reach for it should it come back for him. \"Hey! Compass!\" he yelled. \"Set the ground on fire! A straight line! In front of the wolves!\" The compass stopped right where it was in the air, and then turned to the wolves, which were coming in reinforcements while Jack and Wogglebug tried their best to fight them off. But one wolf had gotten past the Wogglebug's stick, and had bitten upon his tough exoskeleton. The great insect had flinched, but the wolf's teeth had been hurt more by the impact, so that the Wogglebug could bonk the wolf over the head with his stick. Immediately, the compass zipped down to the ground, flames sparking from its surface like a great star, as it left the ground blazing from the fire. The wolves that had come late drew away from the flames, and those that remained were quickly finished off by Jack and the Wogglebug. Once they had stopped swinging their weapons, Richard motioned for his friends to run, and run they did, until the fire had gone from behind them. Finally, they stopped behind a few trees, catching their breath, hoping that danger had passed. \"I could not see the wolves watching us until just moments before they attacked,\" said the Wogglebug. \"I wonder if they were sent by someone to take us.\" \"I should like to think not,\" said Jack. \"I don't like to think that the Witch herself could be watching us traveling.\" \"I hope that will be the last of her tricks,\" Dorothy breathed, clutching at her basket and at Toto. Suddenly, something large and black zipped past Richard's face, scratching at his cheek. A thin line of red stretched on his skin, swelling with blood. \"Richard!\" Dorothy gasped, just as another black mass of feathers scraped her face. She screamed, nearly dropping her assets on the ground. Wogglebug clutched at his stick, swinging it around as more and more shadows of black feathers started to fly around them. Jack looked around, but he could not find a tree with any fruit that he could throw, so he also picked up a stick, trying to fight the same way as the Wogglebug. \"Away with you!\" the Wogglebug was yelling, as the compass was starting to fly again. It fought the same way as before, whipping its chain and lighting itself on fire. Sometimes, it latched its chain around one crow's foot, and threw it against a tree, knocking it out dead. But the compass could not hold that tactic against so many crows, and eventually the crows all went for the compass, pecking and sweeping their wings around it, trying to put out its flame. Richard went for the distraction quickly. He yanked a stick from a tree near him, and reached as high as he could to the crows. One, he knocked into a tree, and the next he threw to the ground. Dorothy joined him, as did Jack Pumpkinhead, and the Wogglebug. Together, while the compass still glowed with fire and flung its chain to and fro, the crows were brought to the ground, laying with broken wings and snapped necks. But almost right then afterwards, there came a buzzing through the trees, and the group could see a giant swarm of bees approaching. Thinking fast, Richard pointed at the bees. \"Hey! Burn them!\" he cried at the compass. As before, the compass became a mass of flames, twirling and whirling through the swarm. Even its long chain became like a sword of fire, tearing through the bees like they were wet paper. In the meantime, Richard and his friends turned away from the bees, going further and further away. \"Oh, dear heavens!\" Jack gasped. \"Please, no more.\" \"I'm afraid you cannot do anything to change that, Jack,\" said the Wogglebug. \"The Witch may not stop attacking us until we give in to her. But we cannot give up. We must keep going. The compass seems smart enough that it can catch up to us once it is through with the bees.\" The others ran on ahead, but Richard had to keep looking behind him. He did not want to leave the compass behind, since it had now done so much for him. He wanted to stay and help it, to keep his eye on it while he still fought. So he took up his stick again, prepared to fight should anything more come to harm him. But just seconds before he had thought to pick up his stick, the compass had flung away the last of the bees it had burned, floating down triumphantly, with the last of its fire dying away into sparks. Richard did not know how to react; whether he should take the compass's chain, as he did before when it was being a regular flying instrument, or take it like a tender butterfly and hug it to him. He did want to thank the compass for being so helpful, though. He decided to smile at it, while the compass came down to him with its silver surface cooled enough for him to take hold of. The chain wrapped softly around his wrist, and started to pull Richard in the direction his friends had gone. They were far ahead at this time, perhaps half a mile or so beyond where they had been viciously attacked. But they continued forth, moving fast, afraid to go back to sleep since so many things had come for them. Still, their weariness was showing. Toto hardly barked anymore. Dorothy was slowing to a walk, and Jack Pumpkinhead was moving more lankily than ever. Even Wogglebug was moving slowly, having to lean his hand against a tree so he could breathe again. \"Simply unimaginable,\" he murmured. \"I should have realized that witch would be a mighty force to be reckoned with.\" \"Uh, Mr. Wogglebug, I think we all knew that from the very start,\" said Richard bluntly. \"But we should get somewhere where she won't be able to see us.\" Wogglebug pulled in a long breath. \"I do not know how to say if we will ever be safe again from the Witch,\" he said, \"since she may know that we are on our way to her.\" \"Here comes something again!\" Jack yelled. Everyone looked where he pointed, and this time, the blood of everybody in the company ran cold. Creatures with great sweeping wings were coming through the sky, faster than perhaps the bees or crows had. Richard looked quickly at the compass, not knowing how perhaps the little instrument could withstand battle against that number of opponents. He recognized who they were, and where they came from—the winged monkeys who would try to take Dorothy and the others captive in the Witch's castle. Dorothy was the one they really wanted, so he would have to do something quick to get her out of sight. He turned to her, grabbed her hand and the compass at the same time, and gave a little jump. \"Fly!\" he yelled, and he never felt his feet touch the ground for another moment. Dorothy cried out a little as the compass took her and Richard high into the sky. She was now clinging to Richard's arm, then to his waist. Richard tried to hang onto her and the compass at the same time, but the chain was wrapped tightly about his hand. He trusted the compass not to drop him, but he was anxious about getting Dorothy away from the winged monkeys, whom he could hear had gotten to Wogglebug and Jack Pumpkinhead. Richard felt a pit in his stomach for not being able to save them from the monkeys, but he felt better knowing that he could at least watch Dorothy. Together, they would be able to stop the witch.[Chapter 9] Chapter 9 The compass flew fast over the land, as Richard and Dorothy still clung tight to the chain, even as it was cutting off the blood flow through their hands. It had been several moments now since they had evaded the Winged Monkeys, and Dorothy was calmly hanging beside Richard. Toto was sticking his little head from her basket, peeking around every once in a while, as if to be sure that his mistress was safe. Dorothy looked up at the compass, blinking in wonder at the flying instrument. \"I don't know what we would have done if we didn't have the compass,\" she remarked. \"I just hope that Mr. Wogglebug and Jack are all right.\" \"Even if they aren't, we are still going to rescue them,\" said Richard. \"And then, right after that, I think we should send you home.\" \"You mean we will go back to the Wizard,\" said Dorothy. \"Not exactly,\" replied Richard. \"It's your shoes, Dorothy. If you click your heels three times, then they will take you back. You just have to think 'there's no place like home'.\" Dorothy looked down for an instant at her feet, jerking her head back up so as not to be frightened from the height at which they were flying. But when she met Richard's eyes, she smiled. \"I'm glad you're with me, Richard,\" she said sweetly, and Toto gave a little bark. Richard grinned back to her for a moment, proud that he could help. They were so close to the end, he could already see the compass's magic light returning him back home. His happy thoughts were heightened when he looked ahead, and spotted a grim-looking structure sticking out into the dawn rising in front of it. Some dark mountains jutted out on either side of the castle, looking like a pair of jaws ready to snap shut on the happy light coming into the world. \"Oh, goodness, there it is,\" said Dorothy, pointing to the castle. \"Is there anyone there?\" Richard peered at the castle, searching for any sign of movement while they were carried closer and closer to the outside gate. He braced himself for the landing, as did Dorothy, plopping down on the ground near the gate the moment the compass released Richard from its tight grip. It felt good to stand on solid earth, but when they focused their eyes upon the black castle, the tension of their situation rested heavily on them. \"Where do you suppose we could find the Witch, if we are to destroy her?\" Dorothy wanted to know, clutching her basket against her chest. \"I'm scared to say,\" said Richard. He was afraid to step towards the door, even though the compass was already floating towards it. It started to wrap its chain around the handles, but then it lifted it away to beckon Richard and Dorothy to come to it. Dorothy was the first to step towards it, as the compass pulled the doors open. The inside was, surprisingly, very normal looking. There were doors all across the hallways that looked to be made of the finest wood in the land, and gave no indication that anyone wicked lived within their walls. Dorothy gasped slightly upon observing these surroundings, craning her head to look for anything that seemed to belong to a wicked witch. \"If I didn't know any better,\" she said, \"I would very well believe that this was the castle of a dark king, and not a witch.\" Richard was perplexed as well. Not only was he amazed that this place was ridden in darkness, but he didn't know where they could begin to find the Witch. The place was quiet enough that they could not tell right away whether anyone was watching them, or if they weren't around at all. Still, he didn't dare beckon into the open space; it was time to find the Witch, and then destroy her. He took one step forward, hoping to find the Witch soon… Almost the instant Richard moved, he heard a scream from behind, and a lot of Toto's squeaky barking. Whirling around, Richard yelled out too, but not before his mouth was strapped shut by a couple of furry hands. He struggled against his attackers, thrashing his arms and trying to yell through his trapped lips, but then, a green face full of wicked glee closed on him in less time than he could try to breathe. \"Good to see you, little children,\" said the Witch. She turned from Richard to Dorothy, who froze when she found the Witch's eyes. \"It's lucky you happened upon my place, since I was looking for a couple of ripe, young people to work in my kitchen.\" Dorothy looked at the Witch with as much courage as she could muster. \"Do you have our friends as well?\" she said. The Witch widened her grin. \"Your friends don't matter, little child,\" she told her. \"You are here, and so I shall have some good company.\" She gestured down one hallway, eyeing the Winged Monkey that had trapped Richard. \"Take these children to my kitchen straight away.\" Richard felt a hard nudge in his back as the Winged Monkey shoved him down the hallway. Behind him, the Witch gave Dorothy a little push, but she never grabbed her, nor scratched her threateningly with her long green nails. Richard watched as the Witch followed her servant down the hall, with Dorothy in front of her. Again, she never touched Dorothy, and neither did the Winged Monkey. Richard pondered why no one would try to grapple with Dorothy, until the Winged Monkey shoved open a door, and tossed Richard inside. He landed hard on the floor, while Dorothy was merely ushered inside. He barely registered the sound of a door banging shut, until he got up and realized that he and Dorothy were locked inside the kitchen. It was large and spacey, but it was also dim and hot. \"Richard, are you all right?\" Dorothy asked, helping him to his feet and swatting away a large insect that had crawled onto his shoulder. He didn't answer. Richard went to the door, and pulled hard, shaking the knob until his whole body was moving with his yanking. Dorothy pulled him back. \"It's no use,\" she said. Richard's frustration rose to his face, and he glared at Dorothy. \"Oh, yeah?\" he said. \"That's coming from someone who hasn't been laid on by a finger since she came here. Why is it that you have been treated like a princess and I get tossed around?\" Dorothy drew back at Richard's rising voice, but she shook her head. \"I don't know,\" she answered. I'm sorry if you're hurt, Richard, but now we are stuck. What do we do?\" Toto whined, as if he were asking the very same question. Richard looked around the kitchen, noticing the sink full of dirty dishes, the soot in the stove, the rats in the corners, and finally drew his eyes back to the locked door. \"This could actually be very easy,\" he said. \"What do you mean?\" Dorothy questioned. \"Our very best weapon is right in this kitchen,\" he answered. \"When the Witch comes back, we will just toss a bucket full of water on her. It'll be as easy as that.\" He snapped his fingers while a smile grew on his face. … . It took some explaining, but Dorothy felt more inclined to join Richard's plan, although she was still astounded that it could be so simple. As the two of them washed and dried the dishes in the sink, she kept asking how on earth water could melt a witch, and she was a little more than scared about having to get up close to the Witch again, but Richard did not seem too frightened. And that amazed Dorothy. He appeared so ordinary, and yet he knew so much about Oz, and somehow knew how to dispose of witches in the simplest ways. No one came to fetch them for more chores, so Richard and Dorothy helped themselves to some food from the pantry, using some raggedy rugs as mattresses when the day passed, and it was time to sleep. \"Water?\" Dorothy asked. \"That is really all it takes?\" \"Well I don't think I can get away from it,\" Richard said. \"Everyone knows about Oz, and what water does to wicked witches.\" Dorothy grinned, sighing as she stroked Toto next to her. \"Perhaps, one day, I can go to your world, and I can learn everything about the people and the cities, just like I am seeing so much of Oz.\" Richard laughed. \"I don't know how much of an adventure it will be. Because we would just be going back to the world you come from, and everything will be the same.\" \"But it can't be the same if you came across your compass,\" said Dorothy, pointing to the compass floating in midair. \"There has to be something extraordinary out there for your world to be different from mine.\" Richard sighed, and leaned back to stare at the cold ceiling of the kitchen; no moonlight came through the little window above the sink, so the room was almost totally dark. \"I think there's another reason why our worlds are so alike,\" he said. \"There are actually ways for us to get to magic places. You know, you had the twister, and I have the compass that came from a magic library.\" Richard laughed a little as he observed his floating compass. \"I'll bet my life could be like a book too, since there is magic and unexpected surprises every time I go into the library.\" \"You're lucky that way,\" said Dorothy. \"I always wished I could have some way of going to another place, but twisters do not come around every single day in Kansas.\" Richard thought this over for a moment, before he got up and leaned on his elbow to look at Dorothy. \"Well, it's not like you have to be stuck in Kansas. I could probably take you back to my world, and we could go on adventures through other stories.\" Dorothy's eyes gleamed, and she pulled in a sharp breath. \"Would you do that?\" she asked. \"Yeah, I could,\" replied Richard. The compass glowed a soft pink, and it gently wrapped its chain around Dorothy's wrist, as if to say it would be more than happy to take her anywhere she liked. Dorothy laid back down, with the compass still holding onto her, and she yawned, while the pink light turned her skin rosy. \"Richard,\" she said. \"Yeah?\" he asked. \"Thank you,\" she said. \"For everything that you and your compass have done for me, and our friends. I don't know what we would have done without you.\" As he turned onto his side to sleep, Richard felt a smile curl across his face. It felt good to be needed, like he had actually done something good for a friend. It was still a relatively new word for him, which made Dorothy's words glow tenfold more in him. He thought about Jack Pumpkinhead and the Wogglebug. He would not think of this adventure without first remembering them. They were characters that he had not read about, nor seen, for that matter, and honestly, he liked them quite a bit. Wogglebug was smart, so Richard could see himself talking with him for long hours about the most obscure things. And though Jack was wobbly and could not stand upright, Richard couldn't help but admire his determination to protect Dorothy. And besides, Richard felt he had a duty to help Jack. Dorothy did not have to stop at the Wizard to go home, but Jack still did, if he still wanted his colorful vision. Richard laughed a little. He could talk with a giant insect who happened to be the highest educated in Oz. He was becoming friends with a person made of fabric scraps and a pumpkin. And soon, he would be dumping water on a witch, and she would afterwards be dead. If he did take another adventure after leaving Oz, this would not be one to forget. ","Summary":" Chapter 1 \"Go for it! Go for it!\" The ball flew through the cloudless sky, circling around with s"},{"Movie":"Pagemaster","Title":"Taming The Beast","Author":"Arztwolf","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11710695","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Dr. Henry Jekyll was finally rid of that vile presence, Edward Hyde. It had taken many months of experimentation, but he'd finally done it! Now he could live with no more unseemly urges or vile thoughts, he'd be a pure and enlightened being. But, a problem remained; what to do with Hyde? Right now the cretin was tied to a chair, swearing and cursing at Jekyll as the doctor studied him from a safe distance. Hyde's scruffy black hair covered one of his yellow eyes, the pupil blood red. He gnashed his shark like teeth and clenched his fists as he wiggled in an attempt to escape, but the ropes held and he ended up slumping down in exhaustion after several minutes. Unable to break free, he resorted to swearing even louder. A particularly ingenious use of profanity earned him a resounding slap across the face. \"I will not tolerate that kind of language!\" Jekyll scolded the brute. Hyde growled and bared his teeth at him, earning himself another slap. After that he just sat sullenly glaring at Jekyll like a petulant child, both of sides of his face turning pink. Jekyll pulled up a chair and sat in front of him. \"Now then, what am I going to do with you?\" Hyde spat at him and Jekyll unflinching wiped it off and stood up. Sighing, he reached down and grabbed Hyde by one pointy, notched ear. Hyde yelped and stared wide eyed at Jekyll as he lowered his face to within an inch of his own. \"Listen to me, you insolent runt!\" He angrily growled in Hyde's face. \"I will not hesitate to lock you away in the dungeon for all eternity, do you understand me?\" Hyde nodded. \"I know you have some humanity left in you, I know we can have a discussion like rational beings. So, would you like to talk?\" \"Y-Yes, s-sir.\" The terrified monster said, being respectful for the first time in his short \"life\". \"Good. Now, I can't take you out into society behaving the way you do. So some training is in order.\" Hyde started to growl, but painful tug on his ear made him stop. \"No more growling! Gentlemen do not growl.\" Jekyll let go of Hyde's ear and stood with his hands on his hips, sternly looking down at the monster like a disappointed parent. Hyde stared back, baring his teeth but not growling this time.. Jekyll rubbed the bridge of his nose. \"Well, it's a start.\"[Chapter 2] The sound of the grandfather clock ticking away the minutes was the only sound in the oppressively silent room. Jekyll, a napkin tucked into the collar of shirt, sat at the large dining room table, a plate of steak and broccoli on the table before him; Hyde sat opposite, hunched over his plate with a hungry expression on his face as he waited for Jekyll to allow him to eat. A wooden ruller Jekyll kept hidden under the table was the only reason Hyde hadn't just ignored Jekyll and wolfed the steak down; the backs of his hands were covered in welts, proof that there had been a steep learning curve. \"Sit up straight!\" Jekyll commanded, rapping the stick on the table. Hyde sat bolt upright, not wanting another welt. \"Now, tuck that napkin into your shirt and hold your cutlery appropriately.\" Hyde picked up his knife and fork and sat waiting expectantly; Jekyll nodded his approval and picked up his own knife and fork. \"Now, eat slowly and chew your food thoroughly.\" Hyde, still uncomfortable eating with utensils, slowly cut the steak; it took all his willpower to not drop the cumbersome tools and pick it up and devour it like a wild animal. The two ate in silence, Hyde pushing the broccoli as far away from the steak as he could; Jekyll noticed and kept his on the offending vegetation. \"You will not leave till THAT is gone,\" he pointed at the broccoli with his fork. Hyde growled and cursed under his breath; Jekyll raised an eyebrow and Hyde rolled his eyes. \"That's two,\" Jekyll told him, brandishing the ruler. Hyde snarled something so vile that it made Jekyll pull the napkin out of his shirt and slam it onto the table. \"What did you just say?!\" Hyde smirked and repeated it. He then leaned back in his chair and put his feet on the table, a move planned to enrage Jekyll. To his disappointment Jekyll didn't rise to the bait. Instead, he calmly stood up and walked around the table; Hyde, his arms folded, watched as the man slowly approached him with the ruler. \"Touch me with that bloody stick and I'll-\" Jekyll kicked the chair out from under Hyde and put his foot down on the center of Hyde's back, pinning him to the floor. \"You WILL NOT USE THAT KIND OF LANGUAGE AGAIN!\" Jekyll scolded him as he brought the ruler down on Hyde's rear. Hyde yelped and attempted to grab hold of Jekyll's leg only to be swatted again; Hyde, enraged, glared up at Jekyll. Who does that stupid man think he is to humiliate him like this!? Wrenching his body around, he began slamming his fists into Jekyll's thigh. Hyde froze at the sound of a gun being cocked. Jekyll had a gun aimed point blank at his head and from the expression on his face he was seriously considering using it. \"Get up and bend over the table; NOW!\" Jekyll ordered as he set the now uncocked pistol down. Doing as he was ordered, Hyde bent over the tabled and flinched when he felt his trousers being yanked down. He didn't have to wait long, for Jekyll began spanking him with the ruler the minute his trousers passed his knees. \"Stop, please, stop!\" Hyde begged and pleaded as his arse turned a nice shade of pink. \"Stop!? Do you seriously think I'll stop just because you ask me to!? You, who have made mine and other's lives a living hell?\" Seeing that his first tactic didn't work, Hyde tried another. \"I'LL BE GOOD! I'LL BE GOOD!\" He howled. Jekyll raised an eyebrow. \"And I should believe you, why?\" Defeated, Hyde slumped down onto the table and waited for the torture to end. Soon it all became too much for him and he began kicking his feet and sobbing like a child, not caring that Jekyll was watching him. By the time it finally ended he was laying limply across the table, his face tearstained. The only thing he wanted to do now was ran away and hide in some dark corner, far away from everyone and everything. But before he could do that, he heard Jekyll walk up behind him and, too his complete shock, pulled his trousers up and started to rub his back. Sniffling and blinking back tears he turned to look at the kindly doctor. \"Why are you doing that?\" Jekyll stopped. \"Why not?\" \"People aren't nice to monsters. They burn them, stick stakes in them or shoot them with silver bullets; so why are you doing this? You hate me, everyone hates me!\" Jekyll smiled down at him and brushed away a tear Hyde hadn't been able to stop from running down his cheek. \"Because, no one is pure evil.\" Hyde pushed himself up from the able and studied Jekyll. \"You want me here?\" Jekyll nodded. \"Yes and I know what you really need right now.\" So saying he opened his arms and Hyde all but dove into them, burying his face in Jekyll's chest and crying silently as Jekyll held him tight. \"Let's go up to my rooms; it'll be warmer and more comfortable there.\" Hyde's eyes slowly closed as he lay with Jekyll on his bed. He could not believe how good it felt to be this close to another living creature, being able to touch someone without them recoiling in horror or brandishing a weapon. He savored the feeling of Jekyll running his hands through his hair and loved the scent of his cologne and the warmth of his body. Feeling loved and protected, he dozed off in the arms of the one who loved him.[Chapter 3] They spent the rest of the night together, Jekyll putting his arms around Hyde in a fatherly hug as Hyde slept snuggled up next to him like a young puppy. The next day Hyde followed him around and proved to be as helpful as he was clingy. He did whatever Jekyll asked of him, from cleaning the floor to patrolling the hallways and grounds of the castle to be sure it was free of unwanted guests. Once that was done he'd silently creep back into Jekyll's bedroom and crawl up beside him, trying his hardest not to wake Jekyll, but always failing. \"How's my puppy?\" Jekyll would whisper as he reached out and stroked Hyde's furred cheek. Hyde would smile and burrow under the blankets to get out of the chill of the night as Jekyll went back to sleep, now with the added warmth of a small body beside him. Life went on in this fashion till one day Jekyll announced he was going to the nearest town, which meant a walk of over two miles through the haunted woods surrounding the castle. Hyde pleaded and begged him not to go, citing all the horrific things that lived in those woods, but Jekyll shrugged him off and ordered him to stay in the castle; he didn't want someone to break in while he was gone. Hyde stood by one of the windows and watched mournfully as Jekyll walked past the gate and out of sight. Jekyll, his walking stick tapping away on the rutted road, wished for the thousandth time that he had a horse or better yet, a hackney or some other method of travel that didn't require him to wear out so many pairs of shoes. Deep in thought, he stopped paying attention to his surroundings, a mistake he would shortly pay for. Back at the castle, Hyde was frantically pacing before the big door. He whimpered and frowned as the minutes ticked by, terrified that his only friend on earth was going to have some terrible calamity befall him. As he worried and fretted, a sound came to his keen, pointy ears, that chilled him to the bone. With a wolf like howl he threw upon the door and ran as fast he could. The first thing he noticed was a musty smell permeating the woods around him, then the heavy breathing of an animal, it's instincts aroused by the smell of what could only be deemed easy prey. Jekyll turned around in time to see a very large and very hungry looking Werewolf standing less than ten feet from him, saliva dripping from its open jaws as the beast panted and moved its tongue over its inch long canines. Jekyll held his cane before him, knowing full well it was a futile gesture. He watched, confused, as the beast stopped and sniffed the air. A sudden banshee shriek and then Hyde and the Werewolf hit the ground, both snarling and clawing at each other. They wrestled for several minutes till Hyde was launched off the monster and into a nearby tree. Jekyll flinched at the sickening crunch of breaking bone. Hyde yelped, but got back up and flung himself at the beast for another round. This time, to Jekyll's amazement, he pinned the beast to the forest floor and bared his teeth. Jekyll covered his eyes as Hyde sank his deadly fangs into the creature's neck. Uncovering his eyes he found Hyde standing sheepishly before him, panting and covered in the Werewolf's blood. \"Daddy,\" he whimpered before doubling over and passing out from the pain of his multiple broken bones. Jekyll ran over to him and scooped him up, grateful that the monster was smaller and lighter then him. With a last glance at the Werewolf's carcass, he carried Hyde back to the castle. Hyde awoke to Jekyll using a warm cloth to clean the blood from his face. Still tasting the Werewolf's blood, he opened his eye and saw Jekyll staring down at him concernedly. Seeing that he was awake, Jekyll set the cloth down and brushed some of Hyde's unruly black hair out of his eyes. \"You did good, my pup.\" \"B-But, I disobeyed you.\" Jekyll smiled and kissed Hyde's forehead. \"You saved my life, that's all that matters.\"[Chapter 4] He needed to sleep, but his keen ears wouldn't allow him to; he heard every step the mice and rats made in the walls, every scratch of a tree branch on the roof over his head, every crackle and pop made by the fire in the grate that kept the cold at bay. Covering his ears in an attempt to block the noise didn't help, all it did was make it so he could hear his ragged breathing and be reminded of the bones he'd broken that day; his left clavicle and two ribs on the same side. Agony. Jekyll had given him some Morphine once he'd wrapped his middle and made sure he was comfortably situated in the bed. But that was hours ago and the pain had come back with a vengeance. Moaning, he slowly sat up, air hissing between his teeth at the pain that simple movement caused. He should be patrolling the halls and grounds of the castle, not stuck in bed like an invalid! \"Can't sleep?\" Hyde looked up at Jekyll standing in the doorway and growled low in his throat. \"What do you think? I just sit up and think of ways to solve mankind's woes at 2:00 in the damn morning!\" \"From that answer I can tell you need more Morphine.\" Jekyll walked over to the nightstand and picked up a syringe he'd left lying there. He next picked up a small glass bottle and pulled the cork out. Dipping the needle into the contents of the bottle he drew up a dose and quickly recorked it. Hyde, who'd been warily watching the process, rolled up his sleeve as Jekyll approached him with the syringe. \"Do it like you did last time, please.\" Hyde pleaded as he eyed the needle. Jekyll smiled as he patted his shoulder. \"Close your eyes and relax, I'll take care of you, don't worry.\" Hyde obeyed and slowed his breathing as Jekyll gave him the shot with one hand while the other held Hyde's head close to his chest. \"Done.\" Hyde opened his eyes and smiled up at his only friend in the world. \"Thanks,\" he told Jekyll quietly as the drug began to take effect. Jekyll reached down and ran a hand through Hyde's hair, a touch the monster savored. \"Get some sleep, your body needs it.\" His eyes growing heavier by the minute, Hyde laid back down and allowed Jekyll to cover him with the quilt; it didn't take long for Hyde to drift back to sleep. Before leaving, Jekyll bent over and kissed the monster on the forehead, something he'd thought he'd never do.[Chapter 5] Four weeks later and Hyde's broken bones had mended enough for Jekyll to allow him to do more than sleep, eat and stare at the ceiling in complete boredom. The first thing he did was head out into the deep woods that ringed the castle. Jekyll, sitting in his favorite chair reading a newspaper, watched as the monster loped into the woods. He couldn't imagine what the brute was doing out there, the woods stretched for miles around, effectively isolating them from the outside world. He put it out of his mind as he read about the terror and woe of the world beyond the castle. Several minute later the he heard the door slam and lowered his paper in time to scream like a young woman. Hyde was beaming with pride as he stood before Jekyll with his prize; a freshly killed rabbit, its head eaten as a snack on the way back to the castle. He was covered in blood and a pool of it had begun to form at his feet. \"T-Take t-that to the kitchen, at once!\" Jekyll, flustered and with a hand to his chest, pointed out the door. \"And clean up that mess when you come back!\" Hyde made an obscene gesture with his free hand before spinning around and storming out of the room to leave Jekyll slumped in his chair, fearing for the state of his nerves. \"I don't know what to do anymore, Gladys; he'll be the death of me, I swear it!\" The plump matronly housekeeper looked at her employer with concern as he she poured him some tea to help calm him down. She was one of the few privy to his secret, so she at least understood some of his troubles. \"The poor creature needs a mother.\" Jekyll, who'd had his head on his folded arms, sat up and looked at her in disbelief. \"A mother? What on earth for? Gladys, he's a wild animal! He'd probably torture her hellishly before eating her alive!\" Gladys rolled her eyes and sighed. \"Who, besides you, does he have in his life?\" Jekyll stared off into space as he attempted to answer her. The answer was obvious; besides himself, Hyde was alone. \"But why a mother?\" \"He's young and lost, Mr. Jekyll. You told me yourself he's like a child. He even called you \"Daddy\", remember?\" \"I do. But my own mother has been in the grave for years and my aged father would jump into his the minute he saw HIM.\" Jekyll gestured out the window. Hyde was napping in the shade of the large willow tree in front of the castle, oblivious to their discussion. \"He's lonely, sir.\" \"Lonely? But I-\" \"You only talk to him when you're not busy, which I daresay is rather often.\" She told him accusingly as she began to absentmindedly scrub the table with a wet dishrag. She had a point; he had been rather busy lately and hadn't had much time to pay attention to Hyde. \"I've seen the way he looks after you tell him to leave you alone; it's like a beaten puppy, sir. He mopes around the castle for hours, like he's searching for something.\" She began to scrub at an imaginary stain. \"The servants-\" \"Are scared of him.\" By now the table was shaking and Jekyll had to pick up his tea least it end up in his lap. \"He's miserable and hiding it, isn't he?\" \"Yes, Sir, that he is.\" Out of breath, she stopped scrubbing, much to Jekyll's relief, before the table was reduced to kindling.[Chapter 6] A single raindrop ended Hyde's wonderful dream. A dream were he had an actual family and friends, a world he longed to escape to each and every day. His nightmare began when he opened his eyes and saw the ominous dark clouds above his head. He hated storms more than anything since he'd left the cozy world of Jekyll's head. At least there he could count on the memories of Jekyll's parents and siblings to make him feel safe. Now what looked like a bad storm was brewing and he was terrified. The darks clouds had reduced the once bright and cheerful blue sky to a narrow band of light on the horizon. Lightning branched from cloud to cloud and thunder rumbled in the distance. Quickly getting to his feet, he ran back to the castle at top speed, sobbing as the wind intensified and the rain began to fall in torrents. \"Oh, it's going to bad one, Mr. Jekyll!\" Jekyll looked up from his paper and was shocked by how the dark the room had become away from his reading lamp. \"You are right, Gladys, it does look that way.\" He folded his newspaper and got up to join her by the window. The world outside looked like it was about to end; the dark clouds now spanned from horizon to horizon, blotting out the sun entirely, as the wind striped leaves from the trees and ran made small rivers on the lawn. \"Dreadful.\" Jekyll muttered as Gladys closed the curtains and the pair walked over to the sofa in the center of the room and sat down before the roaring fire. \"Sir, have you seen that little rascal lately?\" \"Who?\" \"Hyde, sir. Who else is here?\" Jekyll inwardly cursed himself; WHY does he keep forgetting about that lonely creature?! \"Can't say that I have, Gladys. But he must be around here somewhere.\" \"You do realize he is utterly terrified of storms, don't you?\" \"He is?\" The look she gave him rivaled that of Medusa. \"Sir, the last big storm we had he came to the kitchen looking like a scared puppy. I stayed up all night mothering the poor dear; rubbing his back and sitting with him and telling him it would be okay.\" Jekyll closed his eyes and rubbed his temples. \"Why didn't he come to me?\" \"Sir, to be honest, he thinks you've grown tired of him and I don't blame him. You rarely talk to him, you tell him to leave you alone and you push him away whenever he wants to be near you, sir. You treat him like a guard dog, but even dogs need affection every now and again. Someone to scratch behind their ear or toss a stick. \" \"He's full grown, he shouldn't need that sort of thing.\" \"But he DOES, Mr. Jekyll! He's terribly lonely and wants nothing more than a companion. You get to leave this drafty old place and court those fine ladies out there; he can't go beyond the woods without the villagers threatening to shoot him!\" Before Jekyll could reply, the great door banged open and Hyde stumbled in, wide eyed, his clothes soaked and his pants legs covered in mud from where he'd fallen multiple times in his haste to get to the safety of the castle. Gladys and Jekyll got up and ran over to help the obviously terrified monster. Gladys took the ornately knitted afghan off the couch and draped it over Hyde's shoulders while Jekyll fought against the wind to close the door. \"Shh, love, shh,\" Gladys murmured as she hugged and gently rocked Hyde as he shivered in her arms, whimpering and burying his face against her chest as she led him over to the couch. Jekyll watched the two of them, how Gladys soothed and comforted Hyde as the monster slowly began to calm down. She was right, he grudgingly thought. Slowly and quietly he approached the couch, not sure how Hyde would react to him. \"Do you mind if Dr. Jekyll sits with us, love?\" Hyde peeked out from the blanket and shook his head. Jekyll was shocked to see that the monster had been crying, something he wasn't used to seeing. \"Daddy,\" Hyde whispered as Jekyll draped his arm across Hyde's bony shoulders. \"You're not eating enough, are you?\" Hyde lowered his gaze and Jekyll kissed the top of his head. \"Never mind that now, let's just sit here till the storm ends.\" They ended up staying there all night, all three of them falling asleep against one another, Hyde feeling happy and truly loved for once.[Chapter 7] Hyde hated the romantic bits that seemed to infest half of the novels in Jekyll's small library. He hated reading about people falling in love and being loved back, the two things he knew he'd never experience. Angrily he closed the book he'd been reading and looked up to find Jekyll standing before him, a box in his hand and a look of shock on his face. \"You can read?!\" He asked in a tone of utter disbelief. Hyde rolled his eyes as he got up from the chair he'd been sitting in to return the book to the shelf he'd gotten it from. \"Yeah, so?\" \"I, Well, it's surprising, that's all.\" \"What, because I'm supposed to be some dumb brute?\" Hyde sneered as turned to leave the room. \"If you were a, as you say, a \"dumb brute\", you wouldn't be this lonely, would you?\" Hyde froze in his tracks and turned to face Jekyll, his teeth bared in a wolfish snarl. \"What do you-\" \"This should help.\" Jekyll set the box on the ground and opened the lid. The snarl melted from Hyde's face as a tiny orange kitten poked its head out of the box and meowed. Hyde approached the box and crouched down, half expecting the kitten to take one look at him and flee, just like everything else did. Instead, it looked interestedly at him as he reached out one clawed hand and gently stroked its head with one finger. The kitten purred and pushed back against his hand, causing Hyde to have feelings he never knew existed. \"She's all yours.\" Hyde looked up at Jekyll as he scooped the kitten up and hugged it tightly. \"Thanks.\" .[Chapter 8] Gladys watched with a smile as Hyde played with the kitten Jekyll had given him. He'd named it Ginger and Gladys could tell right away that he loved it like it was his child. He carried the kitten with him everywhere he went, catching her birds and mice, and sneaking a little bowl of milk from the kitchen when he thought Gladys wasn't looking. The kitten crawled across the floor, her whole being focused on catching the felt toy mouse Hyde was slowly dragging across the floor on a string. She froze and then, quick as lightning, sank her claws and teeth into the little mouse. Hyde let go of the string as she picked it up in her mouth and pranced proudly over to him, dropping the mouse at his feet as he sank to the floor and picked her up. \"Good kitty kitty,\" Hyde cooed as he petted her. \"She loves you, Hyde, that she does.\" Hyde smiled up at her as she walked over to them and lowered herself onto an overstuffed chair beside him. \"Do you think Jekyll does?\" \"Does what, sweetie?\" \"L-Love me.\" Hyde looked away from her as he picked up the kitten and hugged it against his chest. Gladys sighed and worry the hem of her apron. \"He does, but he just doesn't know who to express it.\" \"I just wish he would show it like those people in the books.\" Hyde had been slowly reading everything in Jekyll's vast library and had always wished Jekyll would hug him and tell him he was proud of him, like the fathers in the books did. He blinked tears back and looked up at Gladys once again. \"I just wish I had a family.\" This time he couldn't stop the tears as Gladys got off the chair and sank down next to him. \"With a mother and brothers and sisters and…and..\" He broke down and allowed her to pull him into a hug, all his loneliness coming out all at once. \"I hate how quiet it is here, I've never had someone to really talk to or a pretty lady to dance with.\" He sniffled as the kitten purred and nuzzled his chin. She sighed and looked up to find Jekyll standing in the doorway, a look of concern on his face. \"We need to get him out of this drafty old place, sir. He needs more than you or I can give him.\" Jekyll bit his lip and nodded. \"Tomorrow, I'll take him into town.\"[Chapter 9] They had been walking for over an hour and were only a mere three miles from the town when Hyde stopped and closed his eyes, his head tilted back. \"Hyde?\" Jekyll peered into the deep woods surrounding them as Hyde stood frozen in place. \"What is it? Do you need to sit-\" \"Quiet!\" Hyde hissed. \"I smell something…interesting.\" He opened his eyes and turned to look at the empty cow pasture behind him. Soon the horrific sound of a cow bellowing in terror could be heard, followed shortly by the loud yipping and howling of whatever was chasing it. \"We-We should go.\" Jekyll grabbed the sleeve of Hyde's coat. Hyde growled and shook him off as a brown cow came charging across the field, a pack of creatures that resembled Hyde in hot pursuit. Soon the cow dropped from exhaustion and was overtaken by the creatures, Jekyll turning away as they tore into it. When he turned back around Hyde was making his way across the field. The leader of the pack, an older looking female creature with brown fur and ice blue eyes, growled menacingly at Hyde as he approached. He stopped and knelt on the ground before her in an act of submission. She jumped off the carcass and approached him on all fours, sniffing his hair and began to circle him. Seeing that he was unarmed and not a threat, she grunted and huffed, a signal that it was safe for the others to approach. One by one they sniffed him, each grunting in approval. Hyde grinned and followed them back to the cow, two of them making a spot for him. He tore into the carcass, the warm bodies on either side of him making him feel safe and at home for once in his life. Once the cow was reduced to bones, the pack moved to the shade of a large tree to sleep off their meal. Jekyll, seated on his coat underneath a tree on the side of the road, smiled to see Hyde so happy. The monster was curled up next a female that appeared to be near his age. Her fur was a tawny color, her hair was blonde and her violet eyes were focused on Hyde, both of them giggling at what the other said.[Chapter 10] Jekyll smiled to see Hyde so happy. To see the once miserable creature laugh and wrestle with his new found friend, the violet eyed female Hyde told him was named Victoria. For several weeks Hyde would leave early in the morning, only returning at night, exhausted, yet happier then Jekyll had ever seen him. This went on till one night Hyde brought Victoria home with him, the two strolling hand in hand into the old castle. \"Oh, aren't they darling!\" Gladys cooed and twittered; Hyde and Victoria blushing and squirming in embarrassment at all the attention, Hyde giving Jekyll a \"save me!\" look. \"Let's give the love bird's some room to breathe.\" Jekyll laughed as Hyde and Victoria bolted up the stairs, grateful to get away. \"I'm so glad they found each other.\" Gladys told Jekyll as they listened to the attic door being slammed shut, Hyde having taken over the space and now claiming it as theirs. ","Summary":" Dr. Henry Jekyll was finally rid of that vile presence, Edward Hyde. It had taken many months of ex"},{"Movie":"Pagemaster","Title":"Masters of the Pages","Author":"GreenWallsOfArt","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5887213","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Chapter 1 Clonk! Bang! Scratch! A baseball went sailing over the field, the bat hitting the moist, green grass, and the batter went running like the wind towards first base. Bits of grass flew up into the air as the batter hit first base with his foot. The batting team cheered wildly as the referee called a save. It was amazing to see such speed and agility at the JV level of softball. Richard Tyler could see the whole scene from his spot at third base- one of the most important spots in the game, or, at least that was what Coach had said. The bases were nearly loaded and there was one player left to go before a possible point could be made. If his team stopped this next player before the end of the ninth inning, they would be ahead by one point, and they would have a chance to win. Richard kept clenching his eyes, keeping them deeply on the other players. I got this, I got this, he thought intently. The shiny, metal bat glinted off the bright, spring sun as the next player came up to the base. The pitcher tossed the ball, and it suddenly went flying as the batter took off. Instinctively, Richard opened his glove, keeping his eyes on the ball. This was it, the time when he would catch the ball and get the player out. The team was waiting, and there was only one out left until the end of the last inning! I got this, I got this, he continued to think deeply. Just like he hoped, the ball flew towards his open hand. Narrowing his eyes, Richard lunged for the ball, his foot planted on the base. With one swift movement, he caught the ball, and threw himself upright on the base. \"Out!\" the referee called, his whistle still ringing. The team cheered wildly seconds before the referee called the end of the inning. The game was over! Like always, the two teams lined up, and they shook hands with each other. Some of the opposing players seemed reluctant, but Richard's team skipped through the high-fiving with such excitement that they were off the field before the other team could lift another foot. The coach gathered them in a circle. \"Good playing, boys!\" he said. \"A little rusty on the catching for the first few innings, but still, excellent batting. Keep this up, and we'll be up there for sure at state. Great catch on the last round, Rich!\" \"Yeah, way to go, Rich!\" another player said. The other players followed suit by high-fiving him and slapping him on the back in congratulations. \"Stop it, guys,\" Richard said modestly. \"I'm not that good.\" \"You stop it,\" the coach retorted. \"What do I always say- the more you diss yourself, the more you risk? Now hit the showers, all of you. Great work!\" With that last command, the team was dismissed, and they grabbed their equipment from the grass. They all dashed towards the parking lot, where their rides were waiting. Some, like Richard, already had their cars, so they could go home right away. \"I still can't believe that!\" one player said to Richard as they walked to the lot. \"Five years of softball, and you're as good as the rest of the professionals. I repeat- I don't believe it! I've been playing all my life, and I've never gotten that good that fast.\" \"Maybe once you put your body and heart into it, Travis, you'll do that,\" Richard offered. \"I'm not taking that from someone who wouldn't go near a softball game if he tried six years ago!\" Travis retorted. \"You brought in all that stupid stuff and told us all that stupid crap about broken bones and brain tumors and all that.\" \"Hey, that was six years ago !\" Richard said, slapping his hand to his forehead. \"I've gotten over that.\" \"Dude, you sound like you've just broken up with a pretty girl,\" Travis said. \"And I don't buy it. I'm not thinking for one minute that you're gonna forget those days. Seriously, we thought you were an alien from another planet with all that crap you told us.\" \"Cut that out, would ya!\" Richard said, swinging his bat exasperatedly. \"It was not crap. It was useless over-the-top information that I just thought would be helpful. Please, just gimme a break. I was only a silly ten-year-old.\" Travis snorted. \"Silly ten-year-old, right. Well, just glad you came to your senses in time for high school. You would have been committed social suicide with that.\" Richard turned his head away, and looked straight ahead, deep in thought. He remembered just as well as those who had been on the town Little League team when he was ten years old. In an attempt to make him do something risky and fun, his dad had signed him up for the team. And anytime he found it convenient, he would inform the team about some crazy statistics about baseball, and the dangers that come from being hit with a ball or swinging a bat too hard. The extremes had gone too far when he brought in medical evidence, and the team was so shocked by what they saw that they no longer wanted to play. The consequences- getting kicked off the team and another failed attempt at making Richard take a risk and have some relaxed fun once in a while. Richard also remembered how crazy he was about being safe. He had kits upon kits for earthquake preparations, life preservers on his shelves, and signs marking dangerous risks around his room. He even drove his parents crazy with statistics on a daily basis! And as a result, he had no friends, and no one to play with because of his crazy safety statistics and precautions he would always talk about. If you heard him, you would think that he was some kind of know-it-all who only wanted to live forever and never get a scratch. That just wasn't humanly likely to be normal- and the kids knew that for sure! And finally, one day, Richard vaguely remembered stumbling into an old library when there was a storm. And then, he had fallen asleep somewhere, and had come out with the dangerous urge to ride onto a cinder block ramp with the daredevils called his classmates in those days. And since then, Richard had been playing Little League, into his current sophomore year, making friends, and finally becoming what his classmates and parents called \"normal\". And Richard enjoyed it. \"And look at what happened to you!\" Travis said, snapping Richard from his thoughts. \"It's like you switched personalities with a normal kid and locked him away to rot in a closet.\" Richard chuckled at the thought. At last, Richard came to his car, and waved goodbye to his remaining teammates. With a slam of the door and a turn, he started the car, and drove back home. It was a short drive, and he enjoyed the freedom it gave him. Besides, the scenery was splendid this time of year, and not to mention that the team had scored another victory! All thanks to the one and only him. Not that Richard was a conceited jock- he just enjoyed helping his team whenever he could. His crazy ideas and safety issues were gone, but his helpfulness was always there. The car pulled into the driveway, and Richard jumped out, his bag slung over his shoulder. As he dashed inside, he caught a glimpse of the old tree house in the backyard. The wood was lighter with the years of sun bleach, and the wood chipped in some spots. It was old indeed, but it had lived a good life so far. That tree house had been another way to help Richard take a risk or have some fun once in a while, but, like all other ideas, it hadn't worked. In those days, there had always been something about heights that Richard didn't like, because it always presented another danger, but since the day he stumbled into the library, that tree house had held many friendly memories. Now, it was just something that took up space in the backyard. Richard walked inside the house, and found his parents working in the kitchen. \"Hey, buddy!\" his dad greeted. \"How was the game?\" \"Won again!\" Richard exclaimed, dropping his bag in the mud room by the garage door. \"Well great, honey!\" his mom exclaimed, giving her son a hug. \"That team has certainly benefitted from you.\" \"Well, I guess since I finally woke up and decided to do something fun.\" \"We're proud of you, Rich,\" Richard's dad said. \"In six years, you've done so much- straight A's, baseball, friends. It just seems too good to be true.\" \"I think you can forget that now,\" Richard murmured, hoping not to start another conversation about his childhood. Richard's mom started towards the fridge. \"Anything special we can make you?\" she asked. \"Anywhere you want to go? It's your special night!\" That was a tough question. Where to go on a special night, and it was all up to him? Richard could only think of one place. \"How about here?\" he suggested. \"What's the matter with going out?\" his dad asked. \"Too many carbs will make you sick? Sixty percent of all fast food places will make you sick in a week?\" \"Stop it, dad,\" Richard said, running a hand through his tousled blonde hair. His dad sighed frustrated. He always made an effort to make his son laugh- but obviously, going back to the paranoia days was never an option. Richard took off his cap and got himself a drink. Right now, life couldn't be more perfect. He was normal, with friends, brains, and a good baseball team who always had his back no matter what. I could get used to this, he thought. Being sixteen has its advantages. Wonder if they could get any bigger…[Chapter 2] Chapter 2 On the other hand… At school the following week, Richard sat in English class. It was early morning, and the class was yawning with boredom; not to mention that it was pouring rain outside, and if that continued, that meant no baseball. And if that wasn't bad enough, the teacher stepped up to the desk with a handful of papers clutched to her side. \"Now, listen up everyone,\" the teacher called. \"I need for all of you to write a paper. To finish off our expository unit, we're going to write about someone that you think has influenced your life in a way.\" The class groaned as the teacher drawled on about the make-up of the paper, Richard as well. He didn't like writing things like that- they were boring, and they took forever to write. Besides they had already written more papers than one could carry in both arms. And like a lot of the other students, Richard made a guess that their teacher had more than two arms. Although, it wasn't like she wasn't a freak already. \"But we've already done a ton of papers this year!\" a classmate complained. \"Can't we just start a novel or something?\" \"A research paper- two weeks from Friday,\" the teacher said, completely ignoring the student that had spoken up. \"Six pages and up about why you chose that person- and then, please write a paragraph relating them to someone from Julius Caesar. And I don't want any complaints from any of you or it's detention for two weeks!\" Richard sighed further. This was not the type of paper he could start on day two. This would be something that he would have to tie in with his lunch hour and baseball schedule- and like always, with the expectations of the team and coach, and the constant desire for good grades- it could get crazy! Later, at lunch, Richard sat with some of his team friends, along with some of theirs. They were discussing the atrocious assignment they had been given, Travis rattling off a chain of complaints one after the other in a snarly, snappy tone. \"Six pages of crap about our hero? And then relating them to something from Julius Caesar ?\" Travis complained. \"Of all the stupid ideas in the world, she had to pick that piece of B.S.! I swear, that woman is a paper-giving piss-off!\" Richard cringed. \"It'll be hard to tie that in with softball,\" he said. \"I'm gonna start it today.\" \"Are you kidding me?\" Travis said. \"I don't even think I have a hero. If I did, he would have to be super cool, and big and popular.\" \"You're talking gibberish,\" Richard snorted. \"Your hero is supposed to be someone you look up to. Not some meathead who could possibly be the biggest muscle-boy in the world.\" \"Whatever.\" \"You know what, forget we ever talked about this,\" Richard ordered as he stuffed his trash into a brown bag. \"I'm going up to the library. Good luck thinking of your hero.\" \"Yeah, dude. See ya at practice!\" The library was quiet when Richard walked in through the door. He guessed most people preferred the loudness of the cafeteria to the calm quiet of the library. In some ways, it felt good to be out of the noise and to focus on this monster paper, although it wasn't due for two weeks and four days. That's how good of a student Richard was; he would never accept anything less than his best, which was typically an A or better. Sitting down, he logged onto a computer, and began his research. The keyboard clicked gently in the quiet of the room, as Richard concentrated. He would need it greatly- this paper was part of what his final grade would be. And with Richard, there were no bad grades on the report card, not even a B! Well, a B was all right and acceptable, but he preferred to show his very best in everything! Aside from the clicking keyboard and the librarian shuffling papers and books behind him, the library was quiet as a church. After a while, some kids came in, but they remained as quiet as the library itself. Someone speed-walked past Richard's desk, pushing a tiny gust of air through his blonde hair. He looked up while sweeping some loose strands from his face, and spotted the back of a girl's head going down the aisle. He could tell because the hair was extending down to slightly below her waist, loose and pretty. It was a bold strawberry-blonde, a bright shade of red, and stopped just above the hemline of a deep brown ankle-length skirt and tan leather flats. Then the girl turned to face the shelf on her side, and Richard could finally see the girl's face. She was rather pretty, and with her ocean-wavy hair pulled back from her face with a thick black headband, Richard could see clear, porcelain skin, a small, slightly-pointed nose, and thin arched eyebrows that bounced up to down as she seemed to search for a specific book. Her eyes were round and feminine, sparkling green as she stepped out of the bookshelf's shadow to look on the other side, her yellow cotton tunic swishing gracefully like it was half of an elegant ball gown as she turned around, and a couple of different beaded necklaces piled over her neck sparkled. Richard had to remember to blink. He was fascinated by this girl- he had never seen hair so long, so silky, and so fine. It was like Rapunzel's hair chopped short a million yards. And, goodness, those eyes. Were they really that big and green? Did they really sparkle like they were made of starlight mixed with glimmering emeralds? The girl took her hand away from the shelf and turned around. Her eyes met Richard for a minute, and he turned away to look back at the computer screen. That girl was so…mysterious. She looked like a girl from a fantasy land who could tame dragons, and maybe even be a younger version of Rapunzel herself. The way she dressed, she looked like a cross between a modern-day teenage girl, and a fifteenth-century peasant, who had the potential of becoming a lady in time. Cautiously turning his eyes, Richard tried to look at the girl again. Hopefully he'd be able to see those eyes again. It was like he had been put into a trance- he didn't know why. They were so hypnotic and dreamy. Except this time, she wasn't standing by the shelf again. No Rapunzel hair, no green eyes, no gracefully-sweeping yellow tunic, no nothing. Forget her , Richard told himself. You'll probably never see her again. The chances of me seeing her are three-thousand-and-twenty-five to one- a totally ridiculous probability of her ever popping up again. Turning back to the screen, Richard tried to focus on the task at hand. He found it impossible to do- every corner of his mind was occupied by that girl, every inch covered with locks upon locks of her fire hair, and the hard glimmer of the green eyes. Frustrated, Richard put his hands on his head and pushed his nails into his scalp. There were so many more important things to do besides that girl- he didn't even know who she was! For all he knew, she was an exchange student from Germany. The German girls were pretty enough, he had to admit. Shaking his head, Richard narrowed his eyes on the computer screen and tried to think of other things. Still, the task was too difficult- the girl had taken over his mind, shoving all other things out. And all too suddenly, the bell rang- a loud but low-toned beeping sound that reverberated through the walls of the library. The girl disappeared from his mind as Richard gathered his books and dashed out before barely making it into the traffic of students.[Chapter 3] Chapter 3 An entire day- an entire, twenty-four hour, single, solitary day. One whole day had passed, and those folds of strawberry-blonde hair never frizzed up and melted away. Richard was annoyed now- all afternoon, the girl stayed with him during baseball, and through the night, leaving him nearly sleepless. And all through that time, the girl never disappeared. The whole thing was getting out of hand, and Richard felt angry for not stopping it when he could. There was so much else he could be doing to distract himself, and what did he do? Sit around blankly like an idiot and think about that girl like he was meeting her at the nearest time for a play date! Besides, another day was up, and that meant less time to get that grade-deciding paper in as soon as he could. \"Sit down now,\" Richard's English teacher said that morning. \"Now, listen up. I've got another thing to add to that paper. I'd prefer for you to get sources from books as well, not just the Internet.\" However, before a student could complain, the teacher put up her hand dismissively. \"It's a requirement for all papers,\" she continued. \"It's about time we began to go by those rules.\" Richard sighed. He could see a trip to the library in the makes. Later that afternoon, he walked up the quiet stairs, and like always, the library was nearly empty. Quietly, Richard headed for the biographies near the back of the library, where he was sure he could get some information in no time. This paper had to get done soon- who knew what other big assignments they could dump on him next? The shelves were lined with lots of books, on lots of people Richard recognized- Shakespeare, Princess Diana, even Oprah. Now if only he could skip those titles so he could find what he was looking for… Nothing on the shelf. Quickly, Richard turned around to look the other way, but his heart jolted when he bumped into someone behind him. Their faces hit and knocked one another on the ground! \"Ow! Oh my God, I'm sorry, I…\" Richard began to say, but he gasped when he noticed who he had bumped into. He was turned face-to-face with a head of bold strawberry-blonde hair! The girl pushed the hair back from her face, revealing the same round, green eyes and thin, arched eyebrows. Her eyes were full of shock, and her mouth was open a bit, revealing two rows of pearly white teeth. \"I'm so sorry, I apologize!\" the girl gasped, grabbing Richard's arm to help him up. \"I didn't see you there. Are you all right?\" \"Fine,\" Richard replied, brushing himself off casually. Quickly, he bent down to gather his books, scattered all over the floor. With a timid smile, he began to walk away. \"Um, you dropped this too,\" the girl added, picking up a small, brown case. Richard took the case from her, taking a small jump to pull his books up to his chest. \"Thanks. Um, my, ahem…glasses.\" He eyed the small leather case on top of its book pile \"Yes, I see,\" the girl noted, taping her chin with her pointer finger. \"Now then, you looking for something?\" the girl asked. \"Maybe I could help.\" \"I'm okay, thanks again,\" Richard said, hoping to get away before this girl could distract him any further. \"No, really I insist,\" the girl said. \"I've read pretty much every book in this library, and I've got nothing else to do.\" She put on a smile that nearly made Richard's heart melt; as if he didn't feel embarrassed enough as it was. \"Could I, please?\" Now she sounded like a small girl begging for a cookie before dinner, and it was a sound Richard just couldn't resist. Richard opened his mouth to reply no again, but choked on the word. This girl was too good. \"Sure,\" he replied. \"So, tell me, which book?\" the girl asked, scanning the shelves already. \"I'm looking for Sammy Sosa or, Robert Louis Stevenson,\" Richard said. \"Ah, Treasure Island , The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde ,\" the girl said. \"You like the classics?\" \"Sure,\" Richard replied. \"Read them both a long time ago.\" The girl still scanned the shelves, looking for the right book. Suddenly, her eyes stopped when she slipped her finger into the shelf. She pulled out a large, black book with Robert Louis Stevenson's name in old Algerian print on the cover. \"Voila!\" she announced, handing it to him. \"Thanks,\" Richard said, adding the book to his huge pile. But then he gasped, about to ask if the girl could find a book on Sammy Sosa. He had only noted Stevenson as a backup in case. But as he was about to get the words out, the girl held up her hand modestly. \"You're welcome,\" the girl said, rolling her green tunic sleeves up. \"Oh, how silly of me!\" she suddenly exclaimed. \"We haven't been properly acquainted. My name is Chloe Dewey.\" \"Richard Tyler,\" Richard replied. \"Nice to meet you.\" \"The pleasure's all mine,\" Chloe replied, tucking some of her hair behind her ear. \"You have…nice hair,\" Richard said, hoping he didn't sound too silly. \"Oh, thanks,\" Chloe replied. \"It's not half bad, and if you had to ask me, and I don't by any means mean to brag- it makes me look like a princess.\" \"Has anyone mistaken you for one yet?\" Richard asked, chuckling nervously. His lack of experience with girls was not at all helping here, so he cursed himself for not doing so up until this moment. \"Not even close,\" Chloe answered. \"Still, lots of people like it. It makes me feel extremely beautiful.\" Chloe did a little twirl in the aisle, causing her green tunic to twirl slightly, and her hair to expand around her head like a fan. The denim skirt she wore flared out and then gathered in a thick pleat around her legs when she stopped twirling. To Richard's surprise, no one turned to look at the girl who twirled like a little child. Richard opened his mouth to say that she really was a pretty girl, but he stopped. He'd definitely be coming on too strong. \"So, anyone ever mistaken you for a giant?\" Chloe teased. \"You are rather tall.\" \"And you're rather short?\" Richard guessed. \"Yes, clever,\" Chloe said, shaking her head and giving Richard a crooked frown. \"Clever indeed.\" At that moment, something stirred inside of Richard. An alarm rang off- what was it that Chloe said her last name was? It seemed to ring a bell somewhere in the deep corners of his mind. \"Wait a minute- what did you say your last name was?\" \"Dewey? Why do you ask?\" \"Oh, yeah! I remember now! Do you know a Mr. Dewey at the library downtown?\" \"Why, yes, yes I do. I'm his granddaughter.\" \"I knew it.\" \"Suppose that explains why I come here every day and read, huh?\" \"You come here every day?\" \"Well, sure I do. Books are what I live for. I've basically been reading since I could pick things up in my hands. I'd expect you to understand that considering you have at least read some of the classics.\" \"I guess so.\" \"Suppose I could interest you in checking another one out?\" \"Sure, I guess.\" Again, Richard rushed to correct himself. Why was he asking for assistance from some strange book worshipping girl when he should be working some more? And he certainly had no business in trying to become acquainted with her; he barely knew her for three minutes. Well, maybe for three days soon enough, but what did it really matter? \"Follow me.\" With that, Chloe led Richard to the other side of the library, where only a single bookcase of books had some fictional works. \"Welcome to my sanctuary.\" \"Sanctuary?\" Richard wondered. \"Haven't you read Notre Dame de Paris ? Where the churches offered safety, or sanctuary, from the outside world?\" Richard nodded in comprehension. \"I'll have to get used to your book references,\" he said. \"You'd better believe it. I've read just about every classic there is to read.\" Chloe said this with a deep pride, like reading since birth had gotten her the Nobel Prize. \"Do you brag this often?\" \"Well, considering I don't have many friends, I've never 'bragged' to anyone in my life. You're my only outlet thus far. Everyone around here thinks that bookworms are geeks anyways. Particularly the breed known as 'jocks'.\" She said the last sentence to herself. Richard shook his head. \"I don't think you're a geek. Believe me, I was the biggest geek you would have ever known.\" Chloe turned to fully face Richard. \"Really?\" Her eyes grew big and sweet, and Richard had to remember to keep breathing. \"Tell me all about it.\" \"I was so scared of the world, that I bothered the other kids and my parents with statistics all the time. I wouldn't even play baseball with my phobias.\" Richard rolled his eyes at his silly past. Chloe tugged at the hem of her tunic. Her eyes skimmed the ground, like she was thinking. \"Well, I suppose it's a good thing we have each other.\" Richard gave her a weird look. \"We both like to read and we have been called freaks before,\" Chloe explained. \"Who's to say we can't be friends?\" Richard just about jumped at the idea. And the bell had just rung. \"See you tomorrow?\" Chloe asked, walking to a nearby table and picking up her bag. Richard nodded, and waved goodbye to Chloe before heading out into the usual flow of student traffic, barely able to understand what had happened, as it had happened so fast with that beautiful girl taking up his sight so much.[Chapter 4] Chapter 4 It was decidedly a new routine for Richard to go to the library at lunch every day. He was beginning to enjoy the feeling of being in the concentrated quiet for twenty minutes just working on that paper. At this point, he estimated he could get the paper in at least a week earlier! Richard read through the book at lightning speed, his pencil scribbling down notes quicker than he could pitch a ball. \"Do you always read that quickly?\" a dreamy voice said behind him. Richard jumped in his seat, concentration totally broken, turning around to face his spook. \"God, don't do that!\" he ordered when he noticed Chloe behind him. \"Have you become a stalker?\" \"I would do no such thing,\" Chloe answered defensively. \"I'm not Jack the Ripper, except he murdered women at night, not stalk.\" Richard snorted, placing a sliver of paper in his book. \"So I guess you would know how to sneak up on people, besides knowing the entire literary world by heart?\" \"Don't try and guess at that,\" Chloe replied, her eyes losing their glint. \"I was only in the library when you were in, so I suspected you would be at the very least, happy to see me.\" \"And I am.\" At least I sort of am, he guessed to himself. \"Good to know,\" Chloe said, her smile returning to her face. \"Still working on that project I see. You must be a big over achiever to want to get it done so fast. That's impressive.\" \"I'm a straight A student.\" Chloe nodded her head, seriously impressed. \"Honor roll, huh? So am I.\" Richard slowly closed the book. \"Honestly, how many books do you read a week?\" Chloe put her finger to her chin thoughtfully. \"Good question. I'd say, oh, about three or four.\" \"Gosh, you really mustn't have a life,\" Richard said. He instantly regretted saying the words. With Chloe, it was obvious not to insult the name of reading or literature itself. For a moment, Chloe was taken aback. Her eyes grew wide and her shoulders rose. \"I don't care about that silly who's-popular-and-who's-not business, Richard,\" she said simply. \"The whole idea of judging people based on their popularity is just a pile of dog chocolate.\" \"When did I ever say I was judging you like that?\" \"You never did. I hear that just because I read all the time that I have no life. Oh, those people make me so angry I wish I could breathe fire. Since when is being a bookworm a sin?\" Chloe slumped her shoulders angrily, her eyes losing their glint yet again. Richard was slightly shocked to see Chloe like this. What happened to the gentle, fantastic-like girl he was getting to know. It was becoming obvious that she didn't like the popular kids or those who thought that books were nothing but wastes of time, much less who took the name of literature in vain. \"Well, I stand on your side, if you have to know,\" Richard said supportively. \"If you don't believe me, just look at my book. I've had it one day, and I'm already half-way through. It's actually pretty interesting.\" Chloe smiled crookedly. \"Well, Richard Tyler, I never thought I'd see the day when a jock would say that a biography is interesting. You must be getting back into the groove, aren't you? When was the last time you read a book, anyway?\" \" Dracula , actually, weeks ago. Scared me half to death, I have to admit.\" Chloe's smile broadened. \"Oh, I know. I read it when I was ten- ran screaming from the room at some parts. Then again, I also loved the fantastic passion Stoker wrote with, showing how deeply he explored the mysterious ways of the vampire and those that even dared to stop him. Still, that book was my first real book love.\" Her eyes had their glint back, her smile like that of a fairy tale princess herself. For a long moment, Richard forgot that he was seeing a human being, and not a fantasy character that had somehow popped out of a book. Chloe's energy for what she loved was incredible. She seemed so soft, and yet at the same time she was like a knight when anyone mentioned the fine arts as a waste, the intent passion in her eyes alone like a fine sword. Chloe's eyes wandered towards the clock on the wall behind them. \"Oh, gosh, how stupid of me. There are only five minutes left before the bell. I've kept you from your paper all period! I really should get going.\" Quickly, Chloe clutched her bag over her shoulder, and started speed-walking for the door. Almost immediately, Richard grabbed her bag handle, pulling her back. \"What, you gonna go without saying goodbye?\" \"All right then. I'll see you tomorrow, Rich.\" Chloe gave him one last crooked smile before turning around, her fire hair swirling like a water current. Richard frowned at his English folder on the table. It seemed now that Chloe was becoming a frequent visitor, it would be nearly impossible to focus on this paper. He could already see the homework hours for that night go late- if he would be able to squeeze everything in. Because, he realized, with Chloe in his life, it would be impossible; and Richard knew it.[Chapter 5] Chapter 5 The due date was fast approaching- and the paper was getting close to being done. Like always, Richard's fingers typed at lightning speed and his book was nearly done. By the end of the week, it was officially part of Richard's routine to go to the library at lunch. And as always, he found Chloe there, reading her books and sweeping herself away from the real world for a short while. Soon enough, Richard began to find that the same was happening to him- every time he was with Chloe, he seemed to forget that they were in the real world, because she reminded him so much of a fantasy character. The week passed quickly, and the paper had finally reached the due basket in the classroom. Still, Richard and Chloe found other things to do in the library- which was Chloe explaining good books for Richard to read, or him suggesting to her that perhaps she try and leave the library for once in her life so she could try new things. She was not convinced. \"Suppose we start studying for finals?\" Chloe suggested one afternoon. Richard snorted. \"Not yet. It's much too early for that. Seriously, who starts studying for finals this early? It's only the first week of May!\" \"Ahem. I do. Oh yes, I know. No life.\" \"Cut it out, Chloe. I told you days ago that you have a life, except that it's not in the real world.\" Chloe nodded, heaving her bag on the table they sat at, trying to find a pencil. Instead of finding a pencil, she accidentally swiped her hand to the side and knocked its opening off to the end of the table. Some books leaned out the side and slowly fell out to the floor. Richard bent down to help her put them back. Just a bunch of textbooks, he noticed- big surprise there. Among the books, Richard noticed an open notebook with blank pages. There were no lines on the pages- they were totally blank, like computer paper. Although this was Chloe's, Richard still wondered what could be in it, the temptation of opening it to the flip through extremely riveting. \"What's this?\" he asked, handing it to her. Chloe took the notebook, flipping through it to be sure there wasn't anything that fell out. \"My sketchbook,\" she answered. \"It's one of my prized possessions, well, next to books, that is.\" \"A bookworm and an artist,\" Richard said, nodding. \"Interesting.\" \"Want to see it?\" Chloe offered, handing it to Richard. He took it from her and began to look through the pages. Richard was astounded to find what he saw in the sketchbook. There were sketches of people- men, women, children, all striking different poses. One drawing had a beautiful young girl leaning her cheek on her hand, like she was waiting for someone, most of her face and chest etched in shadows. Another had a man on it, his hair sleeked back, his eyes gleaming, and his smile revealing two sharp, canine teeth sitting over his colorless lips. One other page had a woman sitting on a bench, her silver gown gleaming and wrinkling in a breeze, her red hair sparkling with flowers, and a rainbow of colors smearing and whirling over her body. And the last one Richard saw that caught his attention, was of a young women wearing a pink gown that was splattered with red, her eyes gazing insanely into space, standing against a black background engulfed with fire. \"These are pretty good,\" Richard commented, pointing to each as he looked through the drawings. \"Thank you,\" Chloe said, pleased with herself. \"Those are all drawings of…\" \"Let me guess- book characters.\" \"Exactly. This one here\"- she pointed to the girl with her hand on her cheek- \"is Juliet from Romeo and Juliet . She's waiting for her lord Romeo to come to her balcony. And this next one\"- the woman with the flowery hair- \"is Queen Titania from A Midsummer Night's Dream . I drew her just after she awoke from the fairy's spell.\" Richard didn't speak. He was entirely captivated by Chloe's artwork. Not only was she an avid reader, but an incredible artist. Was there anything that she couldn't do in the artistic field? \"And you see this one?\" Chloe continued, pointing to the frightening man. \"This is Count Dracula. And this one\"- she pointed to the woman with the red-splattered dress- \"is Carrie White from Stephen King's Carrie .\" Richard stared at the flames in the picture. They looked so real- another amazing example of Chloe's skills. \"These drawings look so real,\" he breathed. \"How do you do this?\" \"I'm not sure,\" Chloe answered. \"I read the books, and somehow I can picture the characters as I think they look. Of course, I read the descriptions of them, and then I add some things that really say that that is the character. To me, it's like a sixth sense.\" \"I'll say it's more like a second brain,\" Richard added. \"These drawings aren't like anything I've seen before. It's like they have been in your mind since you were born, and you've been working on them since you could write.\" Chloe shook her head. \"I've had these drawings since I was eleven or twelve. Then though, I didn't think of myself as a tremendous artist. These drawings just came to me like any other idea.\" Her expression grew solemn, her eyebrows furrowing. \"I've always had an active imagination, and no one except my own family has really approved of it. \"Back in those days, as a child, I was ridiculed because I was such a bookworm and I read so much. Kids would tell me I was weird because I always had my nose literally buried in a book, and that I wasn't fun. I didn't really believe them, considering my mind was always far away in the worlds I read about. Even as an eleven-year-old, I would still play pretend with my toys and fancy clothes and escape into my fantasy lands. There were nights that I didn't come out of them until well after midnight!\" Chloe took a pause, as if trying to collect her thoughts. \"That great, huh?\" Richard prompted, hoping to edge her further. \"And then,\" Chloe finally continued, \"The older I got, the worse the teasing became. My fantasy worlds followed me everywhere I went, and as you can imagine, many thought that the very idea of having an intensely creative mind was a terrible nuisance. I didn't think much of them anyways. But still, the name-calling and shunning grew more frequent, until I began to believe that maybe I would have to face reality and give up my daydreams. \"Finally, one day, I was ridiculed so cruelly, that I nearly made myself forget my make-believe altogether.\" She shut her eyes for a minute and then frowned, folding her lips between her teeth. \"They…they put my face on one of those Disney princesses and paired me with one of the most inattentive people in the school, and handed them out to everyone. It said, on the top, 'Dork and Damsel Dewey- a match made in Book Hell!'\" Richard found himself staring at the tabletop. There was a strange knot in the pit of his stomach, but at the same time, it felt all too familiar. He had been accustomed to torture from other kids, but not that badly. The worst he ever got was a good shunning and the typical name-calling, but never total humiliation in front of the entire student population. All of a sudden, the memory of seeing all those posters on the school walls was becoming as vivid as Chloe's drawings. The Photoshopped photo of a seventh grade Chloe head pasted onto the body of a Disney princess, standing next to the full figure of Dewey Grover, the kid that everyone knew had the tiniest attention span in the universe- the phenomenon of the seventh grade class. He couldn't believe it. From his own encounters he would have thought he was talking to a slightly different girl that, on top of that, was not the target of any social torture. But on the poster, that had Chloe? The Chloe that he was talking to now? \"That's my story. Impossible to say whether anyone still thinks of it from time to time, but my drawings are the only trace of outward imagination I have now, since times have changed,\" Chloe finished, flipping through her sketchbook solemnly. \"I can't tell you for sure, either,\" Richard answered. \"But you know, I had forgotten all about the whole thing with the posters. Course, I didn't know who you were back then, so I can't really say the whole thing was that juicy .\" Chloe half-smiled, her innocent grin, making Richard laugh softly, before her eyes glinted again. \"Well, thank you, Richard. It takes a rare person to say the joke wasn't the downright funniest thing they ever saw in their lives.\" \"Need I remind you that I went through some gruesome stuff in my lifetime too,\" Richard added. \"Guess the both of have had more than our fair share of social junk.\" Chloe shrugged innocently. \"But they'll never get the both of us again…\" He held her palm out flat, like she was asking for Richard to put something in her hand. She pointed with her eyes to her hand, and mimicking Chloe's half-smile, Richard reached for her hand to shake it. Before Richard could make the little pact with Chloe, an announcement on the P.A. system interrupted his movement. The both of them jumped at the suddenness. \" Chloe Dewey please report to the Main Office. Chloe Dewey please report to the Main Office ,\" the announcement said. Richard and Chloe froze. Chloe had a nervous look on her face, and her eyes weren't glinting anymore. Richard glanced at her, concerned. \"What have I done?\" Chloe questioned. \"I've never gotten in trouble before. I certainly hope this is good.\" \"You want me to come with you?\" Richard asked, gathering his books. Chloe suddenly smiled, and nodded. Richard almost chuckled at the joy of seeing her eyes glint again. Quickly, the two gathered their books and walked out of the library, a little nervous about what the future would bring. It didn't take them very long to walk to the main office. Chloe still lagged behind a little, frightened of what she could be summoned down to the office for. She had never done anything to get in trouble for, and she certainly hoped it was for something like a school pride award or something along those lines. Still, she tried to keep her head held high and think happy thoughts. \"Think happy thoughts, and they lift you up in the air,\" she said to herself. \"But then, if only I could fly…\" Chloe walked up to the lady at the desk. \"Name please?\" the lady asked. \"Chloe Dewey.\" \"Ah, yes, we're expecting you.\" The lady talked into a little microphone and called for Mrs. Franks, Chloe's guidance counselor, to come out. Soon, a woman with shoulder-length blonde-gold hair walked out. Her expression was very solemn, and her eyes were filled with a sorrow that was plain enough for an infant to spot. \"Hello, Chloe. How are you?\" she asked politely. \"Fine. How are you?\" \"Dandy, honey. Here, come with me. We need to have a private talk in my office.\" Mrs. Franks gestured for Chloe to follow her, walking around the corner to another room. Chloe turned back to Richard, who had taken a seat next to the entrance door. \"I'll be back.\" \"I know. I won't move from here. Good luck.\" \"I'd appreciate that, Rich. But you can leave when the bell rings. I wouldn't want to make you late.\" Chloe's face was one of such innocence and sincerity that Richard had to pinch himself to keep from smiling like an idiot. \"I'm your friend, Chloe. I'm staying right here.\" Chloe smiled before walking away. \"Thanks. You really are a true friend. And a kindred spirit too.\" She whispered the last part under her breath. Richard leaned forward to ask her to repeat what she said. Chloe was already around the corner before he could ask. Taking a deep breath, Richard sat back. He was a little nervous for Chloe. When people were summoned to the main office, it wasn't usually for something good. It was for troublesome things like gangs and vandalism and crime. It was pretty rare that you were summoned there for an accomplishment. After a few minutes, Richard heard a series of sounds from the guidance room. Chloe emitted a shout shortly after she entered, and there were muffled whimpers, like she was crying. Mrs. Franks' calm voice tried to sound helpful, but Chloe's anguished sobs didn't stop. Richard froze in his seat- what on earth was happening that made tough-girl Chloe cry like that? It had to be something truly traumatizing in that case. Unless he had misread her character and it was something really silly, like a broken nail or a mess-up of some kind. Whatever the case was, it couldn't be good in Chloe's. Chloe came out, her eyes full of tears. Her eyes brimmed with pink, and they had the same glint- except it was a sad, gloomy glint. \"Chloe, what happened?\" Richard asked, jumping up. Chloe couldn't talk for a minute, she was crying so hard. \"My…grandpa…he…he…died!\" she moaned as she collapsed onto a chair.[Chapter 6] Chapter 6 \"What? Mr. Dewey?\" Richard asked, shocked. \"Yes,\" Chloe said between tears. \"I'm going home soon. They…said…I could…go home…the rest of the day.\" \"Chloe, take a breather,\" Richard said. \"It'll be okay.\" \"You're right,\" Chloe said, trying to take a breath. \"But…it's my…grandpa. I've known him…my whole life…and he's…gone!\" \"Shh,\" Richard said, trying to be gentle. \"Can I…can…I…hug you?\" Chloe asked, her eyes running wildly with tears. Richard was taken aback for a second. Chloe, of all things, was asking to hug him. Then again, she was in a great need of consolation, and she was his friend. \"Sure.\" Chloe wrapped her arms around Richard, clinging herself to him. Richard slowly warmed to her, and put his arm around her shoulder. He was tense though; he was being hugged by a girl, but by a friend who was a girl. Although, this was Chloe, the sweetest, smartest girl he knew. \"Oh, Rich,\" Chloe sobbed. \"Thank you so much for being there for me. I don't know what I'd do now without you.\" \"Don't overact,\" Richard replied. \"You'll be just fine, Chloe.\" All too suddenly, Richard could feel his heart melting. Seeing Chloe like this was too heart-wrenching. And for all he knew, Mr. Dewey was the only librarian who could make that library special. Now that he was gone, the library wouldn't be so mysterious and marveling. It certainly wouldn't be the same for Chloe- after all, she probably went to that place every single day of her life. It couldn't possibly be the same ever again. \"Chloe, your parents are on their way,\" Mrs. Franks said gently, coming out from her office. Chloe didn't look up- she still had her head pushed against Richard's shirt. Finally, Chloe's parents walked in to get her. Her mother tapped her on the shoulder. \"Chloe, honey. We're here.\" Chloe looked up, her eyes lined with red. \"Okay, one minute.\" She turned to Richard. \"Thanks, Rich. I'll see you tomorrow.\" \"Bye, Chloe. Don't worry, you'll be okay.\" But then, something began to nag at the back of his mind- like a long lost memory poking through his memoirs of life past. And then, it came back to him- a saying that someone had told him a long time ago that escaped his lips. \"When in doubt, look to the books.\" \"I will,\" Chloe answered, standing up. \"See you later.\" Richard waved goodbye as she walked out. Just a moment later, the bell rang. * * * \"God, man, where have you been?\" Travis asked at lunch a few days later. Since Chloe had gotten the news that Mr. Dewey had died, she hadn't shown up since. Luckily, Richard and Chloe had exchanged phone numbers, so she had left him an awful lot of calls. Not to mention that Richard had been in the library for lunch those past days; for those days he had some false hope that Chloe would come back and she and him would do their usual routine together. She never showed up. \"A friend's grandpa died,\" Richard answered simply. \"A lot of important phone calls have come in. And there's homework I had to get done before baseball. The championship's in a few weeks- I can't slip up now.\" \"Who?\" Travis asked. \"Whose grandpa died?\" \"Chloe Dewey,\" Richard answered, after a minute of hesitation. \"Chloe? Dewey?\" Travis sputtered, nearly choking on his milk. \"The girl who hides her face in a book all day? Who dresses like she came from Camelot?\" \"Yeah, her.\" \"Since when have you been talking to her? She's a geek.\" \"Who is not as geeky as people say she is. Sure she is a little bookworm-ish, but she is still very nice. I think you'd like her if you got to know her.\" \"Eh, I don't know, Rich. Everyone here knows that Chloe Dewey never hangs with the cool crowd anyways. I don't see why I'd want to talk to her. Don't get me wrong dude, she is pretty and all. But talking to her would ruin my rep.\" \"You should. If our English teacher ever assigns us a book report on a classic, she's the one to go to. Trust me.\" \"What's her number?\" Richard smirked. He knew Travis couldn't resist a shortcut out of papers and homework- especially for English class, the one class he was failing. \"But that doesn't mean I'm going to make polite conversation with her on a daily basis,\" Travis added, taking a casual sip of his milk. \"I'm not going to force you,\" Richard added. \"I'm still suggesting that you should sometime. You might like her not just as a homework buddy.\" \"Are you suggesting that I should get to know her to like her?\" \"Forget it, Travis. I guess I was stupid for trying to convince you in the first place. You don't like smart girls.\" \"Whatever, Rich. I don't really care.\" Richard frowned and shook his head. Why was it that every jock in this school was like every cliché high school- hating geeks and liking the dopey cheerleaders? And he was the goody-goody that liked the pretty, geeky girls? But why did that matter? Chloe was his good friend, and she was in need of him right now. Her grandpa was dead after all, and Richard had a duty to be there for her. If Travis didn't care, Richard didn't care. Of course, Travis was a good baseball buddy that he could eat lunch and play ball with, but Richard felt like he could actually trust Chloe to listen to him like a true friend. That was what he liked about her. Suddenly, far off somewhere, Richard heard a sound. It sounded like the sound of clanging metal. Swiping and sweeping, and yelling. Why did that sound seem so familiar? Hold on, it was the sound of clanging swords! Richard glanced around, looking for the source of the sound. Everyone in the lunch room was talking and eating their lunches. No mysterious soldiers fighting in combat. Richard frowned crookedly at the strange sound. \"You okay, Rich?\" Travis suddenly asked, scaring Richard out of his mysterious reverie. \"I'm fine,\" Richard improvised. \"Thinking about upcoming project.\" \"Insane how they give us these big projects even when we have to study for finals weeks early,\" Travis commented, shaking his shaggy brunette head back and forth. \"Those tests are just a bunch of B.S., am I right? You'd think those unit tests are enough, but no- they have to make us cram for another massive test that only takes up baseball time!\" He made a shushing sound with his teeth like he hated the very sound of a test. Richard nodded. His mind was still on those sounds he had heard. It was the strangest thing that had happened since Mr. Dewey had died so suddenly. Maybe it would help to tell Chloe. She would understand, Richard knew that. She was his only true friend.[Chapter 7] Chapter 7 For a few more days, Chloe still didn't come back. Richard guessed that the death was pretty traumatic for the whole family. For someone to be gone for an entire week was crazy- but hopefully Chloe was getting better. That way, she could probably help him figure out what was up with the sounds he heard. The sounds never went away, and Richard was trying to decode a pattern in them. A few hours before lunch, he heard the sounds of raspy, male voices yelling things like \"Land ho!\", \"Ships ahoy!\", \"Get here, cabin boy!\" It was automatically known to him that he was hearing pirate voices. Sometimes, he even heard the sounds of waves splashing and seagulls cawing against a salty sea wind that sometimes blew through the lunchroom, scattering books and papers. At this point, Richard was getting nervous. He had absolutely no idea where those sounds were coming from. And oddly enough, they were sounds that you would only hear in the literary world. Chloe would have told him that right off the bat. He even heard the sounds of fire crackling and moving at great speeds, like they were being breathed from the giant mouth of a great dragon! And with those sounds, he would feel the heat of a fire, and the jerky, poppy sensation of the crackling flames. Now, Richard had made up his mind. The minute he could call or see Chloe again, he would tell her about the voices, and get to the bottom of the situation. She was the only one he trusted to tell them to. Maybe her infatuation with the literary world would give her some inspiration, and tell Richard what the sounds meant. Of course, it was wishful thinking, but Richard hoped somewhat that Chloe would be hearing the same sounds- that way, she would know first-hand what those sounds meant. Richard was also beginning to think that maybe, just perhaps maybe, that his sanity depended on it. * * * Again, Richard had- just his luck- been assigned another project from English. He could swear now that his English teacher was in love with papers, Shakespeare, and making the class miserable and bored. Not to mention that finals were only a month away, and that there was intense studying to do to keep those straight A's on the report card. And what was worse, Richard still hadn't seen Chloe. Richard missed her being there so he could talk to her while he did homework. She made those long, twenty minutes interesting for him. Hopefully, she would be coming back soon- then he could finally spill the beans about those sounds. \"What light on yonder table breaks? It is the east and Richard is the sun,\" a voice behind him said. Richard jumped- at the sudden voice, and the surge of joy at the familiar voice. He spun around, smiling all the way up to his ears. \"Chloe, you're back!\" he said joyfully, standing up to greet her. \"At long last!\" Chloe added, her wide smile glimmering under the fluorescent lights. \"You won't believe how much I missed you! I was so lonely without you.\" \"And my English teacher has been declared insane,\" Richard said, gesturing towards his project space. \"She gave us another project. I sure could have used your help on that.\" \"Well, I'm afraid there could be more important things than that,\" Chloe said grimly, her smile slowly disappearing. \"What do you mean?\" Chloe sat him in his chair, and she sat close to Richard, bringing her voice down to a whisper as she flitted her eyes around the library, as if to be sure no one was listening. \"You may be questioning my sanity as of this moment, but after the funeral, I began to hear voices and sounds in my head. I heard sounds like whalers shouting to whales, girls calling to lovers, and seductive moaning from women. And I'm not sure what to do about that. Between you and me, I'm thinking that this might be a strong case of insanity.\" Richard was shocked- so Chloe would definitely understand the voices; she'd been hearing them herself. \"The same thing happened to me,\" Richard confessed, lowering his voice. \"I heard swords clanging, pirates, and dragons.\" Chloe furrowed her eyebrows, as if in thought. \"You know, the way I see it, it's like these sounds are coming from famous books. The pirates, I know, are from Treasure Island . The seductive sounds could be from Dracula , and the dragon is probably just a representation of a fairy tale.\" Richard nodded. \"What do you think that could mean?\" Chloe shrugged. \"I don't know, but my intuition tells me that we should go to the library downtown. Maybe there's something magic going on, and where these voices are coming from can tell us something. Call me crazy, but I believe that's what we should do. There's something calling not just me, but you as well.\" Richard nodded in partial comprehension. \"I guess,\" he said. \"I don't see what going to the library will do for us, but if you say so.\" \"Not this time, I'm not unsure,\" Chloe said confidently. \"If those strange things keep happening to me, and now they're happening to the both of us, I'm beginning to suspect that there's some great destiny in store for us. And what better place to find that destiny than at the library, where anything is possible?\" Still, Richard was unsure of what to think. But maybe Chloe could be right. He trusted her, so he was ready to believe wholeheartedly that something great would happen. \"When should we go?\" Chloe asked. \"Friday,\" Richard said. \"Ten o'clock. Anytime that we can get away from our parents easily.\" \"Great idea,\" Chloe answered. \"I believe we can be back in time for curfew.\" \"It's done then,\" Richard declared. \"Ten o'clock. Friday night!\"[Chapter 8] Chapter 8 The night was very quiet, luckily for Richard and Chloe. Richard drove cautiously while Chloe tugged excitedly at the hem of her indigo tunic. Their excitement kept their conversations rather low, so the car was quiet as a cemetery. Unfortunately, Richard had forgotten something. From the street he had driven from, there was, mysteriously, no road leading straight to the library. It had been a while since he had last been to the library, and the darkness of the park surrounding the library was nowhere to be found. The inkiness of the late night hour didn't help either, even with the bright headlights on Richard looked right and left and ahead through the windshield, straining to see a path, a streetlamp, anything that might give away the path to the library. There was nothing there, but a long, dark road leading down into the next subdivision, with a vast stretch of trees on his right. \"Hmm,\" Richard muttered half to himself. \"You'd think that I'd be able to navigate to the library. I was so sure it was down the way we came…\" \"And you did,\" Chloe interrupted. She pointed her index finger in the direction of the forest. Richard followed her finger, and found to his great surprise a sidewalk leading into the trees. In the glow from the headlights, Richard could barely see it, but decided to trust Chloe's decision. \"Okay,\" he said, stretching out the word. He parked the car and climbed out, Chloe in tow. He then reached back into the ashtray and pulled out a mini flashlight. \"I sure hope this still works,\" he said, flicking it on. The light didn't go very far, but it was adequate enough. Taking the first steps, Richard took the lead on the path into the park, Chloe stepping up beside him with a calm, steady stride. Following the winding path through the trees was difficult with limited light, but the openness of the park was comforting in the slightest. In the park, some street lamps were lit, giving a warm, sweet glow to the place. Richard scanned his eyes around the park for the library, soon spotting it among the trees and vines that covered part of the stone building. He walked towards it, gaining some speed as he went along. As they got closer, the spectacle of it began to awe Richard after having not seen it in such a while. The tall oak doors stretched up to the domed roof, guarded by tall columns and menacing stone lions. Chloe and Richard together, pulled open the doors, which were, surprisingly, unlocked. \"Grandpa never locked the place up,\" Chloe said, giving the unlocked door a lopsided grin. \"I guess no one has come here since he passed.\" She pulled the door open further, and looked inside to complete darkness. Turning, she motioned for Richard to follow, and he walked in after her, Chloe letting go of the door. Both doors slammed behind them, echoing in the vast open space around them. The noise startled them, and Richard gasped. The place was huge, with high ceilings, in which elaborate chandeliers hung unlit and tall bookshelves stretched as far as the horizon, it seemed. Still, the place was as silent as the darkness, and it looked rather spooky to him. Slowly, Chloe made her way into the darkness. She gestured for Richard to follow her, but he was hesitant to follow. \"Listen, follow me,\" Chloe said. \"We'll follow the shelves by the light of the lamps outside to the rotunda, and then, we shall decide what to do from there. All right?\" \"Okay,\" Richard answered, following Chloe's lead into the unknown darkness. It was beginning to bring back memories of walking down the aisles, shelves shooting up on either side of him. The aisles were so quiet- save for their footfalls in the darkness- that Richard could swear he heard voices telling them where to go; ghostly voices that were barely above a whisper, but there nonetheless. \"What?\" Chloe suddenly asked. \"I didn't say anything,\" Richard answered. \"Hmm,\" Chloe murmured, her voice low, as if deep in thought. \"What did you hear?\" \"It was like there was someone speaking to me. The voice simply said, 'Chloe. Richard. You have arrived at last.'\" Richard's eyes scrunched, deep in confusion. \"That's weird. There's no one else here except us. Where did you hear it?\" \"It sounded close. It's as if they're either right around the corner, or even, inside my head!\" \"Oh, great. We're hearing voices again.\" \"Maybe these are good voices. They might be trying to guide us somewhere- like to the rotunda, where we can find the answers. The good voices are always the guides in the fantasy books I've read.\" \"How could we find the answers to hearing literary voices in the rotunda again? All there is, is just a round opening and a high ceiling. That's all there is here.\" \"Grandpa always told me that there's a magical portal in the rotunda. It's where all the fiction sections come together- where the characters and stories unite.\" \"You're beginning to scare me, Chloe. I would have stopped believing that story years ago.\" \"Be quiet, Richard. Listen to those voices. There might be something bigger than just us hearing voices. This could be a bigger something than we suspected.\" Richard rolled his eyes and concentrated on the quiet. Soon enough, he could hear voices- \"Fee, fi, fo fum!\", \"Wherefore art thou, Romeo?\", \"Help me, spirit!\", \"I was unconditionally and irrevocably in love with him…\" One after another, he could hear them echoing in the vastness, and they came from straight ahead towards the rotunda. Suddenly, Richard no longer felt closed in by the bookshelves. Around him, he felt open, like he was standing onstage before the lights would come on. \"We're here,\" Chloe said, pointing up in the darkness. Taking a few more steps, she walked into what Richard was sure was the rotunda. It made Richard uncomfortable to be in a space that large, not to mention that they were in a place that mysteriously meant a lot to the both of them. Chloe didn't seem scared- she walked further into the rotunda, her footsteps gentle on the marble floor. \"Hello?\" Chloe called, her voice echoing loudly in the space. \"It's us- Chloe and Richard. Whoever sends those voices, come to us.\" Richard was used to Chloe being slightly unusual, but this seemed overly ridiculous. What was talking to nothingness going to get them? Nowhere, that was what, he thought. For many moments, there was utter silence, the sounds of Richard and Chloe's deep breathing to break the quiet. All of a sudden, a loud bang echoed throughout the library, so loud and instantaneous that Chloe jumped, falling backwards and tumbling head-first towards the floor. Unfortunately, she stumbled backwards into Richard, bringing him down with her. She had stumbled backwards so quickly, that Richard couldn't react, only to fall onto the floor. His head came down onto the marble, sending a painful jolt through his brain, and he shut his eyes fast with the sharp hurt. He wanted to get up again, to get out before anything else happened. Strangely though, his brain, nor body, wanted to get up; his head hurt too much. Just to lie there… Chloe had fallen down onto the ground close to Richard, where she had hit her head too. She was still in the blink of an eye, her limbs spread out over the floor. After the sounds of banging on the marble floor, the entire library fell silent- at least until a large book cart rolled into the room, squeaking gently. It stopped abruptly at Richard's feet, and a loose book fell from its place on the cart, as the low rumble of thunder sounded from above. Its thick spine collided with the floor… Bang! Chloe's eyes sprang open in a nanosecond, and at that same instant, the chandeliers that lined the aisles and the circumference of the round rotunda ceiling, where the great mural of fictional characters was painted, came on with explosive pops, with a snow-white flash from outside. Both Chloe and Richard jumped back to life, getting back to their feet. \"I suppose, the voices…they heard me,\" Chloe said, turning her head to look in all directions, taking deep breaths to relieve herself from the surprise of the lights. \"This is weird,\" Richard said, shaking his head in confusion. \"This can't be happening.\" \" Welcome ,\" an old man's voice said out of nowhere. The voice was deep, smooth, and gentle, like a wise grandfather. \" Richard Tyler and Chloe Dewey. We have been waiting for you to answer our calls for so long. And now that you have arrived, we welcome you with many open arms into our kingdom. \" \"Who are you?\" Richard called. The voice seemed familiar, but somehow, he couldn't put his finger on it. It seemed like he remembered it from a far-off memory- or a dream; maybe a dream of a dream. He still could not remember, the memory was so distant. His thoughts though, were interrupted by the sudden dimming of the chandeliers, like they were glimmering with real fire, and Richard felt something vibrating beneath him. Looking down, he didn't see anything happening, but then again, was the compass carved into the floor always that bright blue? \"Richard, look!\" Chloe said, pointing up towards the ceiling. Her eyes were excited and big, the green barely sparkling in the dimness. Richard glanced upward, and what he saw made his heart stop with amazement. The mural was moving, and all the characters on it were looking down at him and Chloe with admiration and smiles. The old wizard-like man in the center was smiling the most, his staff waving gently above the folds of his book-page robe, which wavered in a soft breeze and rustled like autumn leaves. From the end of the staff, there was a bright, glowing ball, refracting light like a disco ball. And from that ball, a magical swirl of light gently flew from it, lighting up the space even more with the chandeliers and the lightning. \"I don't believe it!\" Chloe gasped, opening her mouth wide with amazement. \"This isn't real. But it has to be!\" Richard couldn't say anything. The characters in the mural were moving, but now as he looked down at his feet, he saw the compass glowing a brighter shade of blue- from teal to periwinkle to neon blue to white. He was tempted for a second to grab Chloe and make a run for it, but for some strange reason, he was rooted to the spot, as though the compass itself had grabbed him by the feet. A glance at the mural again told him that the old man with the glowing staff was doing this strange magic. The man still smiled at him and Chloe, waving his staff more, and it glowed white as the compass. \"Chloe?\" Richard asked nervously. \"Richard?\" Chloe repeated in a similar tone. \"Should we get out of here?\" The voice came back, speaking firmly, but gently at the same time. \" Do not leave, neither one of you. Our world is in danger, and we need you more than we may ever again. You will be brought through the door shortly. The entire imagination welcomes you into their world !\" Richard and Chloe heeded the voice, and stood where they were as the light began to swallow them and the rest of the library. The compass suddenly grew bigger, growing like a vine up the columns, and up to the mural. The vine-like lines of the growing compass all connected to the ball in the man's staff, and Chloe's eyes grew frightened as the compass's light completely obliterated their vision of the library altogether. Richard kept his eyes on Chloe, hoping not to lose her from his sight when they came to wherever this so-called magic was taking them. The light continued to expand and grow around them, in a high jungle of intertwining lines that multiplied to fill the black spaces between them. Chloe turned away from Richard and began to pull on her feet to release herself from the floor, but she was held like glue. \"No, let me go!\" Chloe cried, her voice rising to a loud scream. Her breathing grew fast and frightened, as she desperately searched for a way out from the light. \"This isn't working!\" she cried. \"Just hold on!\" Richard commanded, gesturing wildly for Chloe to take his hand. \"Just stay close. We're not going to go anywhere. Now hurry, c'mon!\" With a lunge, Chloe grasped Richard's wrist, wrapping her fingers around his, clenching them enough that her fingers dug into his skin. He held tight to her, never letting her go. The light had expanded enough that now the only face they could see was the old man's. He still smiled down at them, his eyes gleaming greatly. Suddenly, Richard and Chloe both fell forward, as if pushed from behind with invisible hands. The floor fell away from them, and they began to fly down, or was that up, towards the mural? Chloe screamed in fright, and Richard shut his eyes tight. When he finally plucked up his courage, he saw for a split second the real floor of the library falling away from them, like the library had been turned upside down, and the mural was flying towards them. As they fell further away, the library floor disappeared again into the swirling mist of magic and light caving in on them as the mural drew closer and closer at a frightening pace. It all came too fast for Richard and Chloe, as the mural came inches from their faces. They expected to hit the hard surface, shutting their eyes for the impact. But much to their surprise, the surface felt smooth and wet, like gelatin, and they passed right through! The surprise caught them in its tremendous grasp, as Richard and Chloe came crashing towards a body of water. They didn't even see it though, as their eyes were still closed from the fright of hitting the mural surface. The splash crashed on them, pushing them below the surface…to drown in a strange place far away from home. That is, if something hadn't caught them before they could so much as sink below the surface…[Chapter 9] Chapter 9 Richard and Chloe bounced high off what had caught them, and they landed bottom-first on the nearby beach. Richard sat up, feeling his head and rubbing it gently. Chloe sat up beside him, looking just as disoriented. Her hair was a mess and her indigo tunic was wrapped oddly in places that shouldn't have been showing. Quickly, she pulled down her shirt and smoothed it out. Chloe shook her head to clear her mind, and looked around. Around them was a beach, with palm trees and beach grass surrounding the sandy land. Seagulls flew overhead, cawing and calling with excitement. What had just happened though? Had they fallen asleep in the library and were having a strange dream? Or had that strange magic really happened and they were really sitting on a beach that could be thousands of miles away from home and they might never get home? Chloe tried not to think for a moment- the thought was too unreal. \"M' lord? M' lady?\" a voice said out of nowhere. Richard and Chloe turned their heads in all directions searching for the voice. A young man dressed in a white shirt, black and blue slacks, and silver-and-red armor, carrying a sword in its sheath, walked up to them, standing at ease. \"Richard Tyler, Chloe Dewey, my name is Sir Hugo. It is an honor and a privilege to be meeting you both at last.\" He held out his hand, and helped them to their feet, shaking their hands in the process. \"What is this place?\" Richard asked almost immediately. \"The Place of the Imagination,\" Sir Hugo answered, standing taller. \"Of course, I would love to explain it in further detail however, but we must get inside. His High Pageness, the Pagemaster, wishes to see you right away. Follow me.\" \"The Pagemaster?\" Chloe asked, her voice rising a couple octaves. \"Yes, the Pagemaster,\" Sir Hugo said. \"He is king of all things imaginative and all things written within the pages of a book. He has been seeking you both for a while, so we mustn't stand here talking while he grows older and less powerful.\" With a turn on his heel, he walked towards a palm tree, not seeming to pay attention where he was going. \"Um, sir, you're going towards that tree,\" Chloe remarked. \"Don't you know where you're…?\" Sir Hugo continued to walk towards the palm tree, except when he came inches from it, he disappeared into thin air, vanishing like a ghost. \"Follow me,\" his voice echoed like it was carrying itself away through the air. \"Okay,\" Richard said, frowning crookedly. \"But, what are we supposed to do?\" \"Walk to the tree, of course,\" Sir Hugo's voice said, echoing like he was standing in a vast space. And so, Richard began walking towards the tree. He half-expected to simply walk into the tree and get a mark on the head, but before he could walk into it, he found himself walking into a dark void for a split second, before the void was filled with a swirl of color. Richard felt like he was flying with the speed of the swirling colors. The colors instantly vanished after a moment though, and Richard found himself facing a huge throne room. Tapestries hung from every corner, depicting scenes from what Richard assumed were from the literary world. The blood-red walls had dents and curves and engravings in them, making them look like they were made from a lineup of stone book spines. A series of carpeted stairs led up to a large throne, in which an old man wearing a red-and-gold robe made from book pages sat. His long white beard reached his lap, and his eyes sparkled in the light. \"Richard there you are!\" Chloe said from behind him. \"Wasn't that the most amazing thing you've ever seen?\" \"I know,\" Richard replied. He pointed up towards the man on the throne. \"You think that's him?\" Chloe shrugged and walked towards the throne. She kneeled on the floor and bowed her head respectfully. \"Sir, who do I have the honor of addressing?\" she asked. \"My dear, I am the Pagemaster, the keeper of the books, and the guardian of the written word,\" he answered, gesturing all around at the room, especially to the engraved books on the wall behind. \"I presume that you are one Lady Chloe Dewey?\" \"Yes, I am,\" Chloe answered, looking up in amazement at the Pagemaster. Her eyes were slightly wide with awe, sparkling jade in the light from the chandeliers hanging overhead. \"And you, my boy, are Sir Richard Tyler?\" \"Yes, sir,\" Richard answered with a nod, his voice barely above a whisper. His mind was spinning, why did the sight and the sound of the Pagemaster ring a bell? He remembered something from a long time ago- a giant walking between the aisles, a Viking ship, and the giant bookshelves of the library. And then…the giant dome of light… Richard's head jolted when he realized what he was remembering. He had been here before, and the Pagemaster had helped him there with his magic. There had been three friends he met along the way, and they helped him too- at the time they were the only friends he'd ever had. Someone could have filled a book with all the things Richard began to remember from that past time. The Pagemaster stepped down from his throne, and bowed to the two of them. \"I trust my esteemed Sir Hugo has explained to you why you two are here?\" he asked, putting his hands together as though tensing excitedly for something. \"Sort of,\" Richard answered. \"Maybe you can tell us exactly why we are here.\" \"He told us that you wanted us for something; and that we were Sir Richard and Lady Chloe,\" Chloe added, her smile twisting. \"Ah, yes, I can,\" the Pagemaster replied, \"as long as you can sit down with me up here by my throne.\" He gestured towards the space around his throne. Richard and Chloe looked at each before nodding yes. \"We'd like to, Pagemaster, sir,\" Chloe answered, curtsying low. \"Very well, then.\" The Pagemaster then plucked two pages from his cloak and with a popping sound and a small fireworks display of magic, the pages transformed into two wooden chairs, complete with red cushioning. Chloe gasped when she saw the display of magic, before stepping up onto the platform. Richard followed suit, and they sat down together on the chairs, facing the throne. The Pagemaster turned his throne around and they faced each other in a small triangle. \"Now, to start off, it is a pleasure to meet the both of you,\" the Pagemaster began. \"Although, I do remember you, Richard Tyler. You took your first journey into my world, what was it, six years ago?\" \"Yeah,\" Richard answered. \"And Chloe, she has taken so many journeys into this world, it's quite hard to say how many precisely,\" the Pagemaster continued, looking at Chloe. \"Although, I can't say I've ever met you in person.\" \"No, sir, you haven't,\" Chloe clarified, shaking her head. \"Well, I'm glad to see you have finally made it. Now, I have asked you to come here on a very important matter. A tragic event has occurred from outside the control of our forces. However, that event has put some people in our world in grave danger, and we will need the both of you to lead us.\" Richard gave the Pagemaster a confused look. \"And, what has happened?\" The Pagemaster's voice turned grim, and his face drooped into a grieved frown. \"The Prince of the Imagination, and the head of our esteemed forces, called the Binding Order, has passed away,\" he answered. Chloe's eyes widened and she leaned forward, grabbing the arms of her chair in intense surprise. \"You mean Mr. Dewey? M-m-my grandpa?\" The Pagemaster nodded his head. \"Yes, my dear. Cornelius was a dear comrade, and my apprentice. But you see, there has been a disturbance within the confines of our world. Some of the villains, as they are called in their stories, have come together and have made plans to perform unspeakable things. At this point, we are quite uncertain what those plans may be, but we must find out as soon as possible.\" \"But why us?\" Richard wanted to know. \"Why did you make us come here? We've never used a sword or led an army before.\" \"Much less led an army,\" Chloe added, straightening her hair anxiously. The Pagemaster fixed his eyes on the both of them, smiling a tiny smile in the corner of his mouth. \"That, my comrades, is because I see, deep inside both of you, a courage and a will of determination much stronger than any force the opposing army will ever have. The knowledge and cunning inside you is unlike anything I've ever seen before.\" Richard gave the Pagemaster another odd look. He didn't understand a word coming out of the book wizard's mouth. The idea of standing up for the job of leading an army that could decide the fate of an imaginative world of fiction, was totally out of the question. Sure Richard knew he was brave, but not brave enough to lead an army. Maybe Chloe could, though. She was tough and courageous, and she had read enough books to predict the actions and plans of the villains. She would be better for the job that was for sure. Richard shook his head. What could he be thinking? Chloe was his friend and it was his job right now to be there alongside her through thick and thin. He would be scared, but at least he wouldn't be alone. \"Tell us more about this Binding Order,\" Chloe asked, leaning forward further with anxious interest. The Pagemaster cleared his throat, locking his fingers on his lap. \"The Binding Order, my lady, is what has established the peace between our world, and the other world, where you come from,\" he answered. \"Your grandfather was part of that Order, as you know, and thus far since his decease, the Order has been, well, without order. That is also where we need you- to lead the Order and the rest of your army, now known as my very own Pages, into a battle. However, we can't go into battle just yet without knowing their purpose. We will need that information as soon as possible.\" \"And how are we gonna do that?\" Richard asked. \"That has been undecided,\" the Pagemaster replied. He stood up from his throne. \"Now, I believe we must be getting you to your chambers now. We will need the both of you to stay for awhile so we can complete this time, and reestablish the peace.\" Richard opened his eyes wide and shook his head. \"But, Pagemaster, sir, we have to go home. It could be days before we even get to the battlefield. Could we at least go back and have you call us back whenever you need us?\" \"I'm afraid that's out of the question, my boy,\" the Pagemaster replied, turning the chairs back into book pages and sticking them back in his cloak. \"It will be too exhausting to have to call you back every few hours. And still, you will need to learn how to use your weaponry.\" Richard frowned to himself. This was definitely not the best time to stay for months only to do battle within the literary world, especially when the championship for baseball was a few weeks away. Maybe that wasn't important now- Richard didn't know. The Pagemaster stood by talking to Sir Hugo nearby, and then walked back to his throne. Sir Hugo, on the other hand, gestured for Richard and Chloe to follow him, and he began to lead them down a dim hallway. At the end of the hallway was another hallway, in which a series of doors lined up. Sir Hugo led them to one door, and opened it. Inside was a hotel-like room, with two beds, a large window adorned with scarlet, velvet curtains, and a few tables with books and scrolls scattered all over, the woodwork all made up of carved lines of books. \"Welcome to your chambers,\" Sir Hugo said, stepping aside for them to walk in. \"We have already brought your clothes in for you. Meals will be brought in shortly.\" \"Thank you, Sir Hugo,\" Chloe said curtly, curtsying briefly with an invisible dress. 'You may leave.\" Sir Hugo bowed to Chloe and left the room, shutting the wooden door behind him. Richard slumped on one of the beds. \"What is this all about, Chloe?\" he asked. \"We can't stay here for more than a few hours. We're gonna miss something and our parents will worry.\" Chloe began to make herself at home, cleaning up the scattered scrolls and books, and searching for someplace where they might keep sets of pajamas. \"Rich, I don't think that's going to happen,\" she said. \"It's the first rule in fantasy books- when someone goes into another world, no time passes on Earth. We've landed in a fantasy book ourselves, so no time will pass when we're here. Trust me. I've read more books than you'll read in a lifetime. I believe I know what we're in for.\" Richard knew he could trust Chloe with her smarts and friendship, but he still felt doubtful about time. It wasn't entirely likely for absolutely no time to pass while they were here. But what did he know? It had been months since he read a fantasy book with a plot like theirs. \"Now where did they say we could find spare clothes?\" Chloe asked, turning things over. She turned over a large stool before stumbling upon a trunk. With a grunt and a pull, she pulled it open, revealing just what she needed. \"Rich, look at this,\" Chloe said, reaching into the trunk. She pulled out the most gorgeous thing she had ever seen- a blue-and-silver, sparkling dress with a large V-neck with off-the-shoulder bell-sleeves that fell to the floor in length. It looked like something a goddess would wear, except with a skirt that extended all the way to the floor, and flowed out at a full three-sixty angle when she twirled it in front of her. The ends of the sleeves and hem of the skirt were sky blue, while the rest was blazing silver, like snow. Excitedly, Chloe disappeared behind a changing screen, and came out a few minutes later. Richard's breath caught in his throat when he saw her. Chloe appeared looking like the true vision of an angel. The silver of the dress made her features glow, and her smile was unlike any other Richard had seen. For a moment, he forgot that she was a regular bookworm, and thought that she was a princess that belonged in the literary world. Who knew; maybe she did. \"You should see yourself,\" Richard said, sweeping a stray strand of hair aside. \"No one is going to mistake you for a geek ever again.\" \"Well, I have never seen myself this way,\" Chloe said, picking up some folds of the dress then letting them fall. The sleeves swished jubilantly yet they moved so freely like silk on a breeze. Richard glanced into the trunk, and found some clothes for himself. He found a gold tunic, black slacks, white knee-high socks, black boots, and a black belt to tie the tunic off. His chest pounding, he stepped behind the changing screen and stepped out a few moments later. Chloe smiled widely when she saw Richard. Not only did he look amazing in those clothes, aside the long-sleeve T-shirt and jeans that he usually wore, but he looked like the storybook prince charming. Not that Chloe was a big fashion expert, but there seemed to be something missing from the set. \"We look wonderful,\" Chloe said, getting up from her bed, \"but we need something to complete the set.\" She made her way to the trunk, and rummaged through, hoping to find something. Richard stayed where he was, watching Chloe's arms moving rapidly through the trunk. Her body jolted upward after a moment, carrying two large pieces of fabric in her arms. \"Aha! Look at these!\" Chloe handed the large, red piece to Richard, and shook out the royal blue piece for herself. \"Go on, put it on,\" she instructed, flinging the blue fabric around her shoulders. At the neck, she clasped a large, silver buckle, and twirled around. The cape flared out, swirling and shining against the velvety fabric. Richard swung the fabric around himself, and clasped a golden clasp at his neck. The heavy fabric swung gently against his back. \"I honestly wish we had a mirror in here,\" Chloe said, playing with the folds of her cape. \"We must look absolutely marvelous in these clothes!\" \"If you could only see yourself,\" Richard added, feeling the velvety softness of Chloe's royal blue cape. \"You look like you belong here.\" \"You don't look so pauper-ish yourself,\" Chloe said. And somewhere inside him, Richard began to think that maybe staying here for a long time wouldn't be such a bad idea. Especially if it meant that time wouldn't be passing, and looking at Chloe the way she did now.[Chapter 10] Chapter 10 \"Your morning meal is ready, miss,\" a servant said as she wriggled Chloe awake in her bed. She did the same to Richard, the two teens groaning and yawning as they sat up. Richard looked at his watch. \"It's nine-thirty,\" he observed. \"Unless there's a huge time change between worlds.\" \"I doubt it,\" Chloe added. \"Shall I help you dress?\" the servant asked. Richard looked down at himself conscientiously. \"Um, no, you may go,\" he answered. The servant left with a neutral expression, closing the door behind her. \"It's like we're royalty,\" Richard observed. \"We practically are,\" Chloe added, stepping behind the changing screen. \"The Pagemaster and Sir Hugo referred to us as Sir and Lady. I suppose that makes us partially royal, does it not?\" Richard nodded. \"Yeah, but I still have my doubts about this,\" he said uncertainly. \"I mean, you and me, leading an entire army of fictional characters by ourselves? That's illogical.\" \"Since when do you worry about logic?\" Chloe asked, poking her head from behind the screen. \"I thought you weren't afraid to take risks.\" \"And I'm not,\" Richard replied defensively. \"I'm only saying that I'm unsure about this battle. We're in the fiction land, where everything is possible. We're up against pretty big things when we talk about anything happening.\" \"True. But we also have the good forces of the fiction world at our advantage. I mean, think about it, Rich. We have wizards, unicorns, and brave soldiers fighting on our side of this battle. We don't have much to worry about. And in that case, we are having an adventure together. Do you know how long I've been waiting to do something like this?\" \"How do you know you're not dreaming?\" \"How can you talk so voluntarily and be able to realistically see what's happening around you?\" Richard gave her a thoughtful glance. \"Exactly,\" Chloe said, stepping out from the screen in her dress that left Richard speechless again. \"Well, you seemed a little scared earlier,\" Richard pointed out. \"Did you have a sudden change of mind?\" Chloe almost rolled her eyes at Richard in annoyance. \"I'd like it if you weren't so doubtful about this, Richard,\" she said, running her fingers through her strawberry hair like a comb. \"Aren't you somewhat excited about having a real adventure inside the fantasy world of the imagination? You like books, don't you? It's every bookworm's dream to be here. Or are you really just some stupid jock that secretly thinks books are wastes of time?\" Chloe's eyes looked like they were on fire they were so intensely locked on him. And for a moment, Richard was afraid that they would actually make his clothing go up in flames, there was so much power in her stare. Richard cringed. He didn't like fighting with Chloe. She always found some way to get to him, and he was in no mood to prove any stupid point that would make him lose her- she was pretty much his best friend anyway. So he shook his head and turned to grab his clothes from his bed. \"All right, then,\" Chloe said. \"Forget it. What we should focus on is hearing what the Pagemaster wants us to do, and we will do it. We won't let your stubbornness get in the way.\" Richard shook his head, trying to focus more on buckling his belt tightly enough around his tunic. Chloe was right- now was not a time to be arguing when apparently there was an imaginary land in peril. And obviously, they were the only ones who were in the driver's seat, who could control it. If they were, and no one else would lead them there, they would have to accept it and take it one day at a time. But that didn't mean that Richard still couldn't have his own doubts about what would happen soon. Still, if time was passing in the real world, then there was still a reason to worry. Not that Richard didn't care about what was happening in this crazy place, but he still felt he had to worry about how their possible disappearance could affect the others back home. He could already imagine it- his team playing without him because he mysteriously never showed up, the jealous players saying he was too chicken to stand up to the pressure of the championship; his parents desperately searching for him throughout the entire town, only to find him gone from the face of the earth! Not to mention that Richard and Chloe would miss finals, and the both of them would fail out of tenth grade and have to repeat it, if need be. Those dark premonitions haunted Richard as he dressed. It was true the idea of a fantastical adventure sounded neat, but not when there were uncertain things happening in the real world, far off from here. And besides, this was the literary world- anything could happen, and Richard didn't like not having control over what was at hand. The sound of the trunk lid closing jolted Richard from his thoughts, the clasp clinking shut. Chloe stood by, her hair combed, her dress smoothed, and her cape fastened around her shoulders, looking the image of a storybook warrior princess; all that she lacked was a dagger or a bow to truly show it. \"Come on, Rich. They're waiting for us,\" she said, walking towards the door. At last, Richard had managed to fasten his cape and joined Chloe as she walked out the door, shutting it behind them with a deep, heavy thud. Chloe led them down the corridor, following a dark red carpet trimmed with gold and white embroidery made to look like book spines, until they came to a massive oak door, carved with images of books covered with vines intertwining each other, with snakes and doves crawling and flying between them. She pushed it forward, and it opened into a giant dining room, in which sat a long table that looked twice as long as the Mad Hatter's tea table. Laid out on the table was a giant feast, fit for a king. The Pagemaster sat at the far end of the table, dressed in his usual book-page robes. \"Welcome, my comrades,\" he said jollily, placing his hands high in the air like he was a priest welcoming the morning worshippers. \"Please, sit down wherever you like.\" Awkwardly, Richard sat down at the seat next to the Pagemaster, while Chloe took the one across from him. Chloe immediately began to dig into the feast, delicately placing forkful after forkful of strudel into her mouth while Richard took only a few bits of a cinnamon roll, curious to find out what the Pagemaster had in store for them before the gory battling was going to begin. \"I trust you both had a pleasant night's sleep?\" the Pagemaster asked, gesturing towards the both of them in a friendly fashion. \"Yes, sir, we did,\" Chloe answered after a large swallow. \"And thank you so much for these clothes, they are absolutely marvelous.\" Chloe ran her hand along the shiny silver silk in amazement again, and it shimmered like rippling water in the morning sunlight. All Richard could do was wriggle awkwardly in his tunic. 'I'm glad you do like them,\" the Pagemaster replied, smiling kindly at Chloe like she was his own granddaughter. Then, his expression drooped to serious. \"Now then, there are some important things we must discuss before we start our day.\" \"Like what?\" Chloe asked, sipping on a glass of milk. \"Well, the matter of your training, for one,\" the Pagemaster began. \"If you will do the honor of leading us in this battle, you must learn to wield a blade or an arrow. Not to mention meeting the rest of your army and learning of your…\" The Pagemaster was cut off by the sounds of swords clanging outside the dining hall walls. The swords were followed by yelling and congratulatory shouts. \"Pardon the soldiers,\" the Pagemaster said. \"They are very concentrated when they wield their weapons, and yet, they choose to make light heart of the situation at hand.\" \"Will we practice with them?\" Chloe asked. \"It'd be interesting to learn from someone like…Robin Hood!\" She beamed. \"You certainly may, my dear,\" the Pagemaster said approvingly. \"He'd be happy to teach you how to fire an arrow.\" Chloe smiled widely, squealing under her breath. \"I only hope Maid Marion doesn't mind.\" She giggled to herself, shrugging her shoulders to hide her laughter. The Pagemaster shook his head gleefully at Chloe, while Richard stared down at the swirly brown of the cinnamon roll. Learning to wield a sword- that would be exciting; so would leading an army of fiction characters and possibly not surviving. But then again, when he thought about it, how hard could it be to lead an army when they had the powerful Pagemaster on their side, plus the great wizards and whatnot to help them? Richard easily remembered now what the Pagemaster could do with his powers, like simply creating a giant or a swirling twister of magic with a sweep of his hand or a flick of a page. Maybe that was just the tip of the iceberg- what if he could create whole worlds with his magic, or destroy whole numbers of people with just a wiggle of the nose or something like that? Richard hoped desperately that the Pagemaster was capable of such skills- it could also be their ticket home when this crazy war was over. Chloe stood up from her chair, her excited grunt bringing Richard out from his thoughts. \"Come on, Rich,\" she said, sweeping her cape elegantly around her. \"Let's get down to business shall we?\" \"Yeah, sure,\" Richard said, getting up. \"Stop by me anytime you wish,\" the Pagemaster added before disappearing before their eyes in a cloud of blue smoke and twinkly sparkles. Chloe giggled. \"Isn't he amazing?\" she asked. \"If you mean in an old-manly wizard sort of way,\" Richard said, looking on in half-amazement. With another sweep of her cape, Chloe grabbed Richard's hand and headed for the oak door that led out to the field where soldiers practiced their weapon-wielding skills. Inside the room, two soldiers were fencing with each other, jabbing and parrying across the floor. At the corner, a young man dressed in green and brown from head to toe stood, instructing them. \"Robin Hood,\" Chloe breathed in amazement. Quickly, she ran a hand through her strawberry waves and dusted off her bell-sleeves, as though she were preparing to meet the Queen. \"Um, Mr. Robin Hood?\" Richard called, hoping to get the great archer's attention. The man glanced past the two archers and stood taller. \"Oh, ahem, yes, how may I assist you?\" he answered in a strong, brave voice. \"We would like to join you, and perhaps take practice in your lessons,\" Chloe replied, curtsying politely. Awkwardly, Richard followed her etiquette by bowing. Robin Hood strode towards them, his quiver full of arrows clinking behind his shoulders. \"I think it would be marvelous of you both to join me, but first, allow me to tell you my name. I am Robin Hood, or Robin of Loxley if you prefer,\" he said charmingly, holding out his hand. \"I'm Chloe, and this is Richard,\" Chloe said, gesturing towards herself and then towards Richard. Robin Hood halted his hand as he reached for a hand-shake. \"Wait a minute- Lady Chloe of Dewey and Sir Richard of Tyler?\" he asked. Quickly, he removed his feathered hat and bowed low on his knees, his golden hair almost falling past his face onto his forehead. \"It's an honor and a high privilege to meet you my fair lady and good sir.\" Then he took Chloe's hand and kissed it daintily, gazing deep into Chloe's field-green eyes. \"His Pagemaster always told me that you were a beautiful one, my dear lady. You must have lines upon lines of men breaking your door down with proposals of love, am I right?\" He winked flirtatiously at her, smiling. Chloe giggled, clearly unable to resist the archer's charm. \"I'm afraid not, Robin Hood,\" she answered, blushing as bright red as her hair. \"I actually don't have many friends where I come from.\" Robin Hood's expression grew horrified. \"Well, whoever told you that you were a frightful hag will rue the very day he was born,\" he declared, puffing out his chest. Quick as a wink, he changed his expression, clearing his throat, and appearing like he was meeting a dear friend of his, instead of a newcomer. \"Now, how about you, my good lord?\" he asked. He turned to Richard, and with a firm grip, shook his hand. \"Good to meet you,\" Richard said, trying to sound polite. \"Pleasure is all mine,\" Robin Hood answered, smiling deeply. \"You seem like a strong lad. Are you here to learn the fine arts of fencing and archery?\" \"Yes, I am,\" Richard said, nodding. \"Very good, then, follow me.\" Robin Hood gestured for them to follow him, and he brought them into the field, next to a few targets. \"Now to start off, my lady, which art do you wish to learn?\" Robin Hood asked Chloe. Chloe frowned thoughtfully. \"Maybe, archery?\" she guessed. The great archer then grabbed another bow and some arrows from his quiver. \"Always carry around a spare,\" he explained with a quick wink and a smile. With a careful movement, he handed the items to Chloe who studied them with fascination, like she was holding the Hope diamond in her hands, and she began to set herself up. She took off her cape and positioned her arms as Robin Hood showed her what to do. Gradually with careful guidance, Robin Hood showed Chloe how to hold the bow and how to position the arrow. Chloe, however, having never shot an arrow a day in her life, had to undergo lots of practice shots. He even showed Richard a couple of maneuvers if in any case he would want to be a hunter. Richard immediately declined the hunter offer, but he was reluctant to learn to shoot an arrow. Robin Hood soon decided to test Chloe, to see how much she had learned. He stepped back, taking Richard with him, and watched Chloe begin. She took a deep breath, slowly releasing it. She raised her bow until it was perpendicular with the ground. The arrow was straight as the horizon, and Chloe's elbow pulled back till her hand was right there with her shoulder. Her eyes narrowed in concentration, glinting with the morning sun. Her body stood perfectly still, except for her hair and dress, which were wavering in the gentle breeze. Richard tensed as he watched her- she looked for a moment like she was ready to kill someone with her narrowed eyes and tense, tight limbs barely moving as she concentrated. Quick as a flash, Chloe released her arrow. It went flying through the air, appearing like it would smack the target dead on with no mercy. However, it went sailing in a rainbow arc over the target, and landed diagonally in the grass. \"Very good, my lady,\" Robin Hood said, clapping his hands. \"Good concentration, that's plain to see. However, you must always focus on your target as much as you are focusing on the direction of your arrow. Shall we continue?\" Chloe nodded, running to fetch her arrow. Her dress flew out like a flag as she ran, sparkling like stars on a clear summer night. Robin Hood gazed after her. \"A blooming lass she is, Lady Chloe,\" he said admiringly. \"One does admire her so much- her beauty, her grace, her…her fascinating concentration on her target.\" With a slight laugh, he cleared his throat when he remembered Richard was standing next to him, and cracked his knuckles. \"What's say we work on you, my boy?\" Robin Hood offered, tightening his grip on his bow. \"I believe you know what to do- you saw the girl.\" Richard took a deep breath, mimicking Chloe. He pointed the arrow towards the target, focusing on hitting the arrow right at the small, round circle. He focused his eyes straight on the circle, letting go the moment that he had his eyes on the center of the circle. The arrow flew gracefully through the air, but began to fumble towards the ground just before it could hit the target. Robin Hood clapped his hands. \"Very excellent form, my good sir,\" he praised. \"Still, you must concentrate like this arrow will decide your fate. You must be the arrow, and focus with all you've got. You will be our leader, and a good leader never falters in his skills.\" Richard was about to speak up, and complain that he was doing just that, when he stopped. He remembered what his coach had always said- \"There is a key to success in sports, and it is called taking and following advice.\" He knew too well how many times the coach would stress that during practices. But, did archery really count as a sport when you were preparing for a battle? Chloe stepped forth. \"Suppose we shall continue?\" she asked curtly. \"We most certainly may, my darling,\" Robin Hood said, brandishing his bow. \"Lead the way.\" Chloe smiled and reached for another arrow. Richard did the same, following Chloe's every move. Unfortunately, archery was one of the few things he couldn't grasp as quickly as he liked. Holding the bow straight and keeping the arrow still while aiming at a target was difficult enough with Chloe shooting arrows like they were hair elastic sling-shots quicker than he was. Richard tried to imagine that he was just having a lesson at some lousy summer camp to lighten his mood, but every time he succeeded in doing so, another one of Chloe's arrows shot past him. Chloe was having a good time with practice. Maybe it was because Robin Hood was being so helpful- if helpful meant flirting with her and telling her stories of his days in the crusades alongside King Richard himself more than helping her. Richard found that laughable- maybe the Pagemaster would expect to make him a king after this battle. He sighed heavily in frustration as Robin Hood told Chloe another story. Chloe's gleeful laughter and Robin Hood's macho chuckle annoyed Richard as he tried to concentrate on the target. He bit his lip in concentration enough that it drew blood. \"Get down!\" Richard suddenly heard Robin Hood shout. As he turned around to see what was happening, Robin Hood grabbed Richard's arm and pulled him to the ground as overhead, fiery arrows zipped faster than bullets. Richard peeked around his protector's arm, and noticed the arrows coming from the sky, as black shadows swirled overhead. They made whooshing sounds like wind through a hollow cave as they passed. \"What's happening?\" Chloe and Richard asked at the same time. \"They've come back!\" Their question was answered when Sir Hugo ran outside to spot the shadowy attackers. Quickly, he raised a large conch-shell-like horn and blew into it. A loud battle fanfare rang out and from far-off, Richard heard the sounds of armor and horses. Robin Hood leapt from the ground and raised his bow. \"Take cover, both of you!\" he commanded. \"This will be dangerous.\" \"I'm not going anywhere now!\" Chloe said, raising her bow. \"I mean it!\" Robin Hood added sharply as the shadows came closer. But he barely made a move when one of them flew straight into his stomach and knocked him to the ground. He landed back-first against a tree and was still for a moment. \"No!\" Chloe shouted, drawing an arrow from the ground. Quickly, she raised the arrow to her bow, and prepared to fire. But she was having trouble straightening the arrow with the bowstring and getting it ready to let fly. And one of the dark shadows was coming towards her. Richard grabbed a sword from beside him, and grunted as he held the five-pound weapon in his hands. His heart pounding to a hum, he raised the sword to vanquish the shadow before it could touch Chloe. And when the shadow came closer, he brought it down at the same instant there was a bright burst of light and a loud pop , only like a tiny explosion. When the sound stopped reverberating in his ears, Richard opened his eyes and noticed that the shadow was gone, and Chloe was unscathed. The both of them looked at where the shadow used to be in shock, then finally at each other. For a long moment, they just stood there, wondering what in the heck had happened. \"What the…?\" Richard started. They both turned when they heard Sir Hugo and an army of Pages come riding up into the clearing. \"The shadows!\" Sir Hugo shouted. \"Prepare to fire!\" As the shadows continued to fly, Richard and Chloe made ready to attack. But as one came down again, Richard raised his sword to destroy it, but it…just… disappeared before he could even touch it. Richard's sword came down with a crash, but it wasn't half as loud as the gasps of the army and the explosive popping sound again. In shock, Richard turned and saw Chloe crouching in self-defense, with one hand held out, palm facing forward. Her eyes were shut tight, and every one of the shadows were gone. \"Men,\" Sir Hugo whispered, \"get the Pagemaster. I believe that a Proverb has returned.\"[Chapter 11] Chapter 11 Moments later, Sir Hugo hurried through the doors of the throne room, a confused Richard and Chloe following behind him. Sir Hugo skittered over to the Pagemaster's throne and bowed quickly, like he was nervous about this piece of news. The Pagemaster looked down at Sir Hugo, a concerned expression on his face. \"Dear books, what is it, Sir Hugo?\" he asked. \"Your High Pageness,\" Sir Hugo gasped, pointing a finger at the confused teenagers behind him. \"Outside, at the targets…I…Robin Hood…shadows…and then, that girl- she, she stopped…\" Gently, the Pagemaster stepped down from his throne and laid a hand on Sir Hugo's shoulder like he was a son of his. \"Calm yourself, good Sir Hugo. Now, please tell me. What has happened?\" Sir Hugo took a breath, but he still spoke quickly and nervously. \"The shadows returned! They came here, and attacked Robin Hood, and our new lord and lady! Both of them fought bravely, but the girl- that girl- stopped them! With just a raise of her hand!\" Chloe looked on at Sir Hugo, as confused as being given a test without first notice. What had she done to stop the shadows from attacking her? All she had done was just imagine that they would disappear and go away. What did she, or Richard, have anything to do with the shadows' defeat? The Pagemaster gazed past Sir Hugo and at Chloe. His expression was unreadable, so she was unsure what he was thinking. Finally, he raised his arm and beckoned Chloe to come forward. When she did, he put his hands on her shoulders and looked her straight in the eye, serious but gentle. \"Seeing as you saw this entire scene, recount everything you remember happening,\" the Pagemaster said, his voice having the same tone as his eyes. Chloe took a deep breath, and told the Pagemaster what she could remember- the attack, and how she had imagined the disappearance of the shadows. \"But, tell me, what does that have to do with any of this? You actually think that… I did that?\" The Pagemaster nodded his head. \"My dear girl, those shadows would not give up without a fight. They wouldn't go away without a command or unless they were faced with inevitable defeat. However, you told me that they disappeared in the midst of a magical popping sound. That only gives us two answers to this event- that a villain has come into our midst, or something even more powerful and monumental than anything.\" In the Pagemaster's eyes, Chloe could suddenly see a subtle excitement, like an idea had come to him. But instead of speaking further, he rose from his throne and raised his arm. \"Richard, Chloe, the both of you stay with me. Sir Hugo, thank you for telling me this. This recent event may have granted us a further step in preventing this battle from destroying us.\" At his dismissal, Sir Hugo bowed and walked past Richard from the room. Richard walked up to the throne, and the Pagemaster produced a seat for him out of one of his robe pages. When he and Chloe were seated, the Pagemaster gathered them in a circle. \"What's this all about?\" Richard asked. \"What has Chloe done?\" \"There is nothing to fear, Richard,\" the Pagemaster answered. \"Chloe has not done anything to worry about. What she has done is something that might just bring the odds into our favor. More than you could believe. Listen closely to me, because this is important.\" Richard and Chloe leaned in, Chloe starting to play with her hair skittishly. \"You both know about me, and my Pages,\" he began. \"Of course, they are important people to the Binding Order and the rest of this world, but there are three select people in the Order that serve as my advisors, and my seconds-in-command, called the Proverbs. \"Each Proverb has a special ability that enables them control over the rest of this world when I am absent. The first, has the power of the Mind. This means the ability to read minds, and simply to read people like an open book. The second, has the power of the Books. This person can summon only specific objects and people out of a book by pointing to the words in a book. It's a vital ability, but it's not quite the most powerful of the Proverbs. Which brings me to you, Chloe. \"The final Proverb has the power of the Imagination. This ability really has no limits, and that is why it is so vast and powerful. The person must merely imagine something happening in their mind, and that which they imagine shall be conjured. Even the most abstract and strange of events can occur, and, utmost amazing to state- the most dangerous. With just the right heart and imagination, the very universe could be destroyed with merely a thought. Fortunately, such a large feat takes much concentration and courage to make happen. And the Proverbs are all good people. Nonetheless, such a power can only be given to a special person who has the courage and the responsibility to control such a massive capability of changing the world.\" Chloe stared at the Pagemaster in amazement. She was starting to have just the slightest disbelief in what the Pagemaster was telling her. \"You're…you're not saying that I could be…a Proverb ?\" \"Then please,\" the Pagemaster prompted. \"Put your imagination to the test. See what you can imagine for me.\" He looked at Chloe with anticipation, and when she didn't do anything, he put a hand on her shoulder again. \"Don't be afraid, Chloe. Even a mortal's imagination has no limits to what they can conjure.\" Chloe stood up from her seat and took a deep breath, muttering an \"okay\" to herself. She closed her eyes, and concentrated on taking deep breaths. For several seconds, nothing happened. Richard feared for a second that maybe the Pagemaster's hopes had been dashed. He prepared to console the Pagemaster and tell him that Chloe was not who he thought she was. But when he was about to open his mouth to speak, he could suddenly only open his mouth to stare in shock. There, in the middle of the room, was a simple, black book. But then, in an explosive pop ,there appeared two. And then there came three. Then four, and five…the books were accumulating in a pile big enough to cover the carpet there. In surprise, Richard glanced to Chloe, whose eyes were still shut in concentration. Then, he looked back at the Pagemaster, who looked just as shocked as Richard did, but he looked as though he was witnessing a miracle. And as Richard saw it, he was- they both were! Then Chloe opened her eyes, and the books stopped accumulating in the room. When she saw the pile there, she stumbled back into her chair and just stared at the books. \"I…don't…believe it!\" she gasped, breathing deeply. She flicked her gaze to the Pagemaster, who only nodded.[Chapter 12] Chapter 12 \"No way! This is too amazing!\" Richard was lying on his bed, while Chloe stood in front of the mirror, imagining new clothes for herself, new books for the shelves, even changing her eyes and hair color once in a while. She twirled like a little girl in a dress-up game, grinning widely. \"I guess it's too bad Cinderella's fairy godmother couldn't do all this at the think of a thought.\" She chuckled, and finally changed her clothes back to the way they were. Richard didn't listen to Chloe laugh, or watch her play with her new power. He certainly thought it was cool that Chloe's new power might give them a bypass in this battle- if she could just imagine things to happen, then it would be over by the next week- but something was making the back of his brain hurt, and he was trying hard to figure it out. Even though the excessive popping sounds of Chloe's magic stopped, he wasn't having much more luck in figuring his mental puzzle. Turning away from the mirror, Chloe ran her hands through her hair, and collapsed onto her own bed. \"Geez Rich, several hours later, and it still feels like it's all happening too fast! You know I…\" She stopped talking when she noticed Richard's thoughtful expression, turning to lean on her arm and look at him. \"Richard, what is it? What are you thinking about?\" \"Nothing,\" he replied. \"It's just- something the Pagemaster said makes me feel like I might know who the other Proverbs might be. That thing about reading minds, reading people like open books…\" His expression lightened when he began to realize something, the answer unfolding before him. \"Wait…'I have a talent…for…for guessing…what…'\" Chloe looked at Richard with the same confused expression. \"What are you saying?\" \"I'm trying to remember,\" Richard replied, exasperated with himself for not remembering the rest of the phrase he was talking about. The least he could remember was that he had heard it in the same library they were inside of, and then…something that…something…something that Mr. Dewey might have… At last, Richard shut his eyes in total defeat, and slumped against the mattress. What was so important about this stuff anyhow? Was it so crucial that he try to remember this? The most important and powerful Proverb- Chloe- was here, so why would they need the others? But then, maybe now that one was found, the Pagemaster would press that the other Proverbs be found. And Richard was so close to figuring the rest of the phrase he recalled… \"…talent for guessing what people need!\" Chloe suddenly stated loudly. The moment she mentioned it, Richard felt a rushing river of memories instantly come flowing through him. The rush brought him out of his reverie and he sat up, quickly enough that his head began to rush feverishly. He couldn't believe that he had forgotten. What Chloe had finished was one of the first things that Mr. Dewey had mentioned to him when Richard first walked into the library. But, a talent for guessing what people needed? Did that mean…? \"Yes, that's it, isn't it?\" Chloe asked. \"Oh, wow. I cannot believe I never realized this. Richard, I think that…\" \"Mr. Dewey was a Proverb?\" \"Yes! The one with the power of the Mind! All right, that's two Proverbs found. Now, who's the last one, with the power of the Books?\" Richard shrugged. He didn't know someone who could just open a book and bring its contents to life like the last Proverb could. Maybe it was Sir Hugo. Then again, he couldn't- he was the Pagemaster's messenger, and couldn't possibly be that, and a Proverb. Maybe even Robin Hood could be a Proverb- he had the bravery and the nerve to stand up against evil, despite how annoying he could be during archery practice. But could a storybook character be a Proverb too? Chloe did the same, and lay back against her pillow. She sighed deeply and turned over. Closing her eyes, her night clothes appeared on her, and her dress appeared again, hanging over the changing screen. I guess I'll have to get used to this, Richard thought. \"Who knows who the last Proverb could be,\" Chloe sighed. \"Oh well, might just have to find out when we make our first raid into the woods soon enough. One thing's for sure, though- when we do find the Proverb, this battle will be one step closer to finishing, and we can restore the peace. Together, you, me, and the Proverb will be unstoppable against those shadows and the rest of the villains that dare come near us. Maybe we might just rescue some…damsel in…distress…in a white dress…and…\" With one final sigh, she shut her eyes, and drifted into sleep. \"Night, Rich.\" Richard stood up from his bed and crossed the room to the changing screen to get into his night clothes. Throwing his cape and shirt over the screen to hang till morning, he then took a breath and blow out the candle near the screen. Quickly, he crossed back to his bed, and crawled under the covers, his mind not on sleep, but on the raid that Chloe mentioned. Just after they had discovered that Chloe was the Imagination Proverb, the Pagemaster had asked Robin Hood to keep up his lessons with Richard and Chloe for the next few days, to prepare for a raid into the forest beyond the Pagemaster's palace. During the raid, they would scout around for any villains and their accomplices. They would listen for discussions or suspicious sounds, and look for objects that might just lead them to further plans the villains had for war. Sir Hugo informed them also that this scout would be especially vital, because now that the most powerful Proverb had been found, they would have to scout out whatever they could to see that no villain spy had found out the news. Richard and Chloe would be accompanied by Sir Hugo and a dog to help them sniff or hear out anyone suspicious in the woods. Anyone who already knew of Chloe's ability would be taken prisoner and only released when the battling was said and done, and when they would agree to be neutral between the heroes and villains. Richard was nervous for what might happen, although he hoped that Chloe's power wouldn't fail them on their journey. Sir Hugo said they were traveling very far, and would not return for several days. Chloe was excited though, because finding the Books Proverb would only improve their chances of winning the battle. She seemed anxious to find someone with a similar ability to her, maybe because she would not be alone in handling the magical ordeals that would take place during battle. Although, somehow Richard doubted that the Proverb would be found, because that was not the main focus of their journey. They would be lucky enough to scout out any villains at all, but finding the third Proverb along the way, that would be amazing. If they did find the third Proverb, they might just come out alive.[Chapter 13] Chapter 13 It was early in the morning a few days later, when Richard and Chloe were awakened by a banging at their door. \"Come along, both of you,\" Sir Hugo's voice said from behind the door. \"Come, quickly now!\" \"We're coming, Sir Hugo!\" Chloe said sleepily from underneath her covers. With a loud yawn, she rose from her bed, pushing the covers away from her. Closing her eyes again, she made her white dress appear on her, and with that, she got up and stood by her bed, yawning and stretching her arms. Richard, on the other hand, just dove right back into his covers and groaned. Chloe sighed and pushed Richard around in his bed. \"Wake up, Richard, come on!\" she said. \"You heard Sir Hugo! Get up!\" \"Okay, okay, sheesh!\" Richard threw the covers off of him and got up slowly. Mechanically, he proceeded to step behind the changing screen and got into his shirt, pants, boots, and cape. Chloe stayed where she was and while she stared at the changing screen waiting, the covers on both her and Richard's beds magically made themselves, finishing with two magical pops . \"Wait up for me, Chloe!\" Richard called, having heard the popping sounds. \"I'm not going anywhere,\" Chloe answered. \"But Sir Hugo might be if you don't shake a leg now. Do I have to shake it for you?\" \"You're not doing anything to me with that power of yours!\" Richard commanded sourly. \"I'm getting ready to close my eyes…\" Chloe stretched her words tauntingly, and grinned, hiding a laugh. \"And imagine…\" \"Don't you dare…!\" \"Here we go…\" Richard scrambled out from behind the screen, with his clothes on, although his cape was askew on his shoulders and his shirt was half buttoned. \"You didn't even close your eyes!\" He pointed an accusing finger at Chloe. \"Oh, shake it off, Rich!\" Chloe said. \"Lighten up a little. Okay, this scout is really important and we'll need for you to not be a sour-plum the entire way. If it makes you feel any better, there probably won't be any fighting or killing.\" \"Are you so sure?\" Richard was skeptical of Chloe's statement. He could see uncertainty beneath her mask of confidence. \"Look, anyway, if there ever is any fighting, the heroes always win. Just don't get your pants in a twist over this. The last thing any of us need is for you to get tense in tight pants in the middle of listening to some villain's conspiracy discussion.\" \"That's not funny,\" Richard said. Chloe shook her head and smiled. \"My point is to just do what Sir Hugo tells us to do, and don't do anything reckless or stupid.\" \"Won't happen, I swear.\" Richard nodded his head. \"Very good. Now, let's go!\" Chloe smiled bravely and pointed towards the door. She marched out, Richard right behind her, and greeted a sour-faced Sir Hugo, with a maid in a book-page dress right behind him. He folded his arms. \"Good to see that the both of you decided to wake up before sunrise.\" He gestured towards the maid behind him, and then towards Richard and Chloe. They walked down the hallway, and took several more again before coming to the dining room. The table was empty save for a tiny breakfast laid out for them. The maid invited Richard and Chloe to sit down, and they ate their breakfast to their heart's desire. Richard perked up greatly after he had a morning helping of the cinnamon rolls and apple juice. Come to think of it, he suspected that if everyone in the world ate the exact cinnamon rolls every day, then morning tire and frustration would be gone like the dodo bird. The plates were cleared away when they were through, and Sir Hugo stood before Richard and Chloe as though they were a whole line of soldiers awaiting command. He reached behind his back, and magically produced an armful of supplies. Sir Hugo bowed, saluted, and led Richard and Chloe down the hall towards the practice grounds where they would make their way into the forest, but not before handing Chloe a bow and quiver full of arrows, and Richard a sheath that carried a long, silver sword with a golden swirly handle. Once again, Sir Hugo stood erect and saluted. \"Long live the Pagemaster!\" he said. Richard and Chloe repeated his actions, and were about to begin walking into the forest, when Sir Hugo abruptly whistled. From not too far off, there was a low barking, and then a large fluffy dog with long, golden hair came bounding towards Sir Hugo. The dog sat down, and nodded his head. \"That's a good dog, Jip old boy,\" Sir Hugo said, patting the dog's head. \"You know what to do.\" \"Yes sir, right away.\" Richard and Chloe simultaneously gasped at the voice that came from nowhere. But, then, it didn't just come from nowhere. The dog turned to them, and opened his mouth to pant. \"Oh, hello, old chaps. Name's Jip, at your good service.\" \"Jip?\" Chloe asked. \"Hold on. The Jip from Doctor Dolittle ?\" \"Sadly, my dear master is helping sick animals away in the woods with those gone-bad villains. Couldn't bring his best friend along. Said it was too dangerous. But, still, yep, that's me all right.\" Chloe bent down, and held out her hand. \"Can you shake?\" \"Sure as treats are a dog's favorite dinner, yep, yep.\" Jip nodded his head and then shook Chloe's hand. Richard didn't move. He was too preoccupied staring at the gleeful dog. \"Wait. I thought you could only talk if someone could understand animals,\" Richard said skeptically. \"Any old man can understand me here,\" Jip answered, thumping his tail for emphasis. \"At least, not any good thing that isn't human or animal.\" \"Even those evil shadows?\" Richard blurted. Jip snapped his head up at Richard. \"'Even those evil shadows?' The shadows couldn't tell dog from cat-talk if they tried for eternity. But if we do so happen to hop across one of them, I'd leave the talking to someone else if I were you.\" \"Yeah, we'll remember,\" Richard answered. \"I'm not so good at talking to shadows, but I surely can smell them out,\" Jip added, sticking his nose to the ground, sniffing. \"You two just had breakfast. I can smell the very sugar and vanilla on your skin. Wait! There's even a touch of lemon somewhere in that pancake!\" \"Wow, you can really smell that?\" Chloe asked in awe. \"That's a talent.\" \"You think I can smell that deep?\" Jip challenged. \"I've been trained to smell out those shadows and any other villains from miles away. Take it from years of smelling out crooks with Dolittle himself.\" Jip stood proudly and grinned a wide, toothy grin. \"Good making with the pleasantries, old boy,\" Sir Hugo praised. \"Now, come. We must be hurrying along on our mission.\" \"Hugo tells me we are going on a mission,\" Jip repeated. \"I'd like not to taste some shadows on my tongue for sport, but for my masters, I shall do it!\" \"You must be very loyal,\" Chloe said, scratching Jip behind the ears. \"More than you could ever think to think,\" Jip answered. \"You know, I like the both of you already. Think you can take care of me while we are out?\" Chloe answered by massaging the fur on top of Jip's head. He panted eagerly as Sir Hugo gave the dog a good tug on his collar and hurried them into the woods. The woods were beautiful, full of wildlife and magical flowers that bloomed to reveal books hiding beneath their petals. When the books fluttered in the breeze like butterflies, Jip would glance up to sniff them but he never faltered in his task of keeping his nose to the ground. Sir Hugo kept his eyes straight ahead, never pausing to look back at Richard and Chloe while they walked. By this time, Chloe had picked some of the flowers and put them in her hair. She looked like a pretty maiden with the breeze toying with her dress and the flowers tucked behind her ears. Richard could only look ahead, and sometimes grasp his sword hilt to assure himself it was still there. As they walked, Richard also found that he was beginning to remember quite a bit about this place. Although, he was having a hard time placing which part of the library they could be in. The surroundings gave no indication whatsoever, but he liked to imagine that they were in the fantasy section, because everything was so neat and pretty. Still, he didn't see a ghost or a fairy or anything to identity this place as. \"Hey, Sir Hugo,\" he called. \"What part of the library are we in?\" \"What part?\" Sir Hugo answered. \"Why, boy, we're still smack dab in the middle of the place- the rotunda. It's the Pagemaster's kingdom. He resides in not just one section but all of them. Otherwise, we'd be in a much bigger binding than we are now.\" \"I've heard of civil wars before,\" Jip said. \"But this doesn't make sense. Don't the villains know that the Prince wasn't murdered by the mortals? Most of them are such nice people- far as I've heard. Doctor says that they should be if they are at least kind enough to pick up our stories.\" \"Suppose you'd like to think so, wouldn't you,\" Chloe added. \"But villains' minds can't be changed once they're made. That much I've figured out.\" \"Couldn't have said it better myself,\" Sir Hugo said. \"A villain's character and mind are written for evil. They think of nothing but evil things, and will do anything to gain their power even after their stories are out of print. Simply had to put the blame for the great Prince's death on something.\" \"Nutsy people,\" Jip agreed. Sir Hugo glanced back at Richard, who jumped when he suddenly faced him. \"Keeping up the pace back there, are you boy?\" \"Just fine,\" Richard replied. \"Good. Just keep your eye on the girl and we'll be fine. The very last thing we need is for someone to…\" \"Wait!\" Jip was suddenly on high alert, his fur standing on end like porcupine needles. \"I smell something. And it doesn't smell like book-giving daffodils…\"[Chapter 14] Chapter 14 Jip followed his nose into a thick bunch of tall brush not too far away from the company. Sir Hugo followed the dog, walking on tip toes so as not to disturb Jip, whose senses were now working in overtime. \"What is it?\" Richard asked, holding his sword hilt in one hand. \"What do you smell?\" Chloe turned and harshly shushed him as Jip inched closer into the brush. \"Follow me,\" Jip said. \"We're going deep into the forest. Keep the girl close to you, lad.\" With that, he disappeared behind the brush altogether, followed by Sir Hugo, and finally by Richard who took Chloe's hand as they walked through. The brush hid an entirely different place to the company. The trees were tall redwoods, their branches making a thick canopy over the forest with enormous green leaves. Sounds came from all around- the cawing of birds, the rustle of trees, and the low rumble of a far off roar. The ground was moist and mossy, enough to sink into. Everything in this new place was damp and smelly, but it was teeming with wildlife, even more than the old forest. Several colorful plants sprouted around them, and occasionally, Chloe was frightened by a lizard leaping from here to there, or a large black flower sprouting a weedy, gnarly book. She dared not touch them, for surely they were poisoned. The farther they walked into this jungle, the darker it got, and soon enough, they were arming for any possible danger. Several minutes passed, and still Jip was sniffing for his suspect. He had to trample a few flowers with his paws, and shove aside a few slimy frogs, but he never stopped sniffing. Again, Richard asked, \"What is it, Jip?\" \"Closer…closer…\" Jip could only utter those words as they walked further. But suddenly, he stopped altogether, and turned around. \"It's changed course.\" \"What has?\" Richard asked nervously. \"The thing,\" Jip whispered, a little skittish himself. He then walked in a circle to the left. Then he went to the right, and again to the left. \"What are you doing?\" Sir Hugo wanted to know. \"It's toying with us,\" Jip answered. \"I can feel it…\" With a loud crash, something leapt from the bushes and pounced at the group. Richard and Chloe scattered, and Jip jumped out of the way with a squeaky yelp. Sir Hugo jumped also and drew his sword. From a few feet away, with their weapons drawn, Richard and Chloe now saw what had attacked them. A lean tiger was standing still, its paws hard on the ground as though ready to pounce again. It glanced all around, looking confused, but then, slowly, its face evolved into a sly grin. \"Surprised to see me?\" it asked. Its voice was deep and charismatic, but it leaked with a sly power that should be avoided, like the sound of a looming thunderstorm. \"Are you…?\" Chloe started to ask. \"Shere Khan, to be precise, little lass,\" he said, turning to look at her. Chloe, who became tense with fear, straightened her arrow at the sly tiger. It didn't seem to have any effect on Shere Khan, because he kept moving towards her and Richard, who had his sword drawn further in front of him. Behind Shere Khan, Jip was standing ready to pounce, his teeth bared. Sir Hugo had his sword drawn, both hands on the hilt. \"'Tis rather good to see you, point of fact,\" Shere Khan said. \"I was just in need of some good company, and then I hear the footsteps of humans and a little pooch pup, and then here you come. I thought that maybe that might never ever happen.\" He shook his head and kept the grin, although Chloe and Richard could tell that the tiger probably didn't have an afternoon outing with them in mind. \"Don't try to fool us with flattery, foolish cat,\" Sir Hugo said, pulling his sword back. \"We know who you are.\" Jip emphasized those words with a low growl. Shere Khan turned around and smiled slyly at Jip. \"Your name, pup?\" Jip didn't answer. He just stayed where he was and kept his teeth bared. Finally, he said, \"I don't answer to kitty cats.\" Then, he peered past Shere Khan's face and towards his hind legs. \"If I'm not mistaken, you probably have a lame leg. That's not going to do you any good, then, is it?\" He smiled playfully. Shere Khan was still for a moment, but then he leapt from the ground and onto Jip, with a startling quickness that caused the rest of the company to jump back, still poised to attack. Jip yelped, and Shere Khan growled. Chloe cried out to Jip in fear, but her call went unanswered. \"You have good spirit for a pup,\" Shere Khan said, \"even enough to address me in the name of my silly mother's nickname for me.\" He pressed his jaws closer to Jip's neck, cursing and growling, and then opened them like he was going to bite down on the poor dog like a vampire. \"But you won't have any spirit in a matter of seconds.\" From watching the scene, Richard could see that Jip wanted to yelp from fright, but the expression on the trapped dog's face indicated that he did not want to further provoke the monstrous tiger. Jip only kept very still, and tried to accept his fate by not moving and keeping his eyes closed. \"Hey, Lame One!\" Chloe suddenly called out. Quick as lightning, Shere Khan whipped around and just as quickly charged at Chloe, roaring in monstrous fury. As he came upon her, Chloe fired her arrow, hitting the tiger square in the shoulder. Unfortunately, Shere Khan quickly regained himself, and tore the arrow from his skin with his teeth. He spit the arrow aside like it was a piece of rotted goose flesh, and turned on Chloe again, charging at her quickly enough that she didn't have time to fire again. Chloe ran, and Shere Khan came after her. She was quick, but the tiger was slowly growing quicker. Richard and Sir Hugo prepared to meet Shere Khan with their swords, standing next to a nearby tree. \"On my signal, you slice at the tiger,\" Sir Hugo directed as Chloe ran towards them. When she passed, Sir Hugo gave a cry, and he and Richard brought their swords down at the same time to get Shere Khan. He dodged them easily, and continued after Chloe. Jip was the next tactic in defeating the tiger. He charged after them with a speed that surprised Richard as he kept to the tree for another blow if they came near again. When Jip came up to Shere Khan closely enough, he opened his mouth gaping wide, and bit down on the tiger's leg. Shere Khan yelped loudly, and slowed down a little, while Jip led Chloe to safety. \"Get out of here, lady,\" Sir Hugo called to her. \"This tiger is man's work!\" \"I'm not going anywhere!\" Chloe yelled as she prepared to fire another arrow. Then she fired, this time hitting the tiger in the back, where he couldn't reach. She used this chance to run to Richard and Sir Hugo. She brought them behind a tree, hidden from sight, while Jip made a second attempt to bring down Shere Khan. He ran in a circle, listening to the loud roar of the tiger ringing in his ears, but the dog was not afraid. He took a second circle, trying the tiger's test of dizziness. Jip took a third circle for good measure, and then he leapt around to raise his claws. He jumped at Shere Khan, his claws in front of him. But Shere Khan met him with the same velocity and movement, and the two met in a fight that circled throughout the trees. Fur flew and roars tried to overcome barks, but Jip stayed strong against the large tiger. \"Jip!\" Chloe called out. \"Keep fighting. We'll help you!\" Richard followed her signal by flinging a softball-sized rock at the tiger when the fight started to break up. The rock broke into pieces against Shere Khan's skull, and that stunned him down just enough for Jip to push the tiger into a circle of jungle surrounded by brush. Chloe closed her eyes and imagined a great fire on the tip of her arrow. A spark lit on the head, and it flared hotly. Aiming for the brush, Chloe fired, and the arrow landed square inside it. The brush, like the arrow, erupted in a volcano of sparks, and the fire spread quickly. Chloe ran around the brush and whistled for Jip, who came running with a heavy pant. The company watched as the fire spread around the trapped Shere Khan, who roared in defeat. His roars were soon lost to the roaring of the flames, which spread through and around the brush faster than they expected. \"Let's get out of here!\" Jip said urgently, jumping nervously on his front paws. \"Good idea,\" Richard added as they turned to go further into the jungle. Unfortunately, the fire was still spreading, traveling further into the trees and brush, crackling and roaring for something more to devour. The group had to walk faster as the flames licked at their heels. Jip yelped as the heat touched his coat. Chloe looked down at Jip, and massaged his back. \"You doing all right, Jip?\" she asked him. \"Oh, I'm fine, thanks,\" he answered. \"But we should go faster, if you don't mind. The smoke could do bad things to us if we want to keep going on this mission we have.\" \"He's right,\" Sir Hugo agreed. \"This fire is spreading quickly, so we must leave this jungle.\" \"And how do we do that?\" Richard wondered aloud. \"It looks like it doesn't end for miles around.\" Jip grunted at the sound of walking through the jungle much longer. \"And with all those kitties around here, we could be in…\"- he shivered, and his fur stood on end again- \"…more danger than we think.\" \"Don't be a coward, old boy,\" Sir Hugo scolded. \"I believe we can withstand the danger. Though, I do wish that there was a quicker way out. The jungle could be as boundless as the imagination itself…\" Sir Hugo stopped midsentence, as though a new thought had come to him. And it did. \"You know…\" \"What? You know something?\" Richard pressed anxiously. \"We are still inside the rotunda of the library,\" Sir Hugo explained. \"If young lady Chloe could imagine us out of this jungle, her magic shall bend the natural forces of the rotunda, and we might just find our way out.\" \"The natural forces?\" Richard asked. \"Yes. The rotunda is where all sections come together, and is the most powerful place in the imagination. Any genre, any character, any thing is possible, and is in the very center of the imagination- the core, if you will, my boy. If this young lady can bend the thousands of natural forces that dwell in it, then we can more than likely escape this place. With power that unlimited, she can also make things disappear, create life out of thin air, and even create whole other worlds far away. But mind you, bending the magic that way- appearing from place to place- can only work in the rotunda. In any other genre, her power shall be limited to merely conjuring pure simple objects.\" \"Sir Hugo, will it really?\" Chloe said, her eyes lighting up. \"Course, my lady,\" he said. \"Shall you do that for us?\" Chloe nodded her head, and immediately, Sir Hugo ordered for the group to take hands, and let Chloe perform her magic. When they did, she shut her eyes, and there was suddenly a moment of darkness. From the void came a blast of light and color, and when the popping sound reverberated through the space, the group found themselves surrounded by a disintegrating cloud of colorful lasers and sparkling balls that fell to the ground. And to Richard's surprise, when he pressed his foot, it didn't sink into the ground like quicksand. \"Chloe, you did it!\" he said. In surprise, Chloe looked around, and her mouth opened wide when she noticed that she had taken them out of the jungle, and into a grassy valley with grey snow-capped mountains beyond. Sir Hugo bowed before Chloe. \"You, my lady, are a savior, and truly the Proverb of the Imagination.\" Chloe grinned and looked ahead. The valley was open and green, tall weeds bending in the wind. Its perimeter was surrounded by green trees that sprouted forest-green books, like in the forest. She took several steps forward, and almost fell over when she stepped to the ledge of a tall cliff that stood tall over the rest of the valley. Richard, Sir Hugo, and Jip stepped up beside her. \"Did you ever see anything more astounding before?\" Sir Hugo asked, admiring the spectacle. \"Never,\" Chloe answered. \"I never dreamed to see something so beautiful in the literary world either.\" Richard and Jip chuckled. \"And probably never will in your absolutely dizziest ones,\" Jip said. \"But, now I'm even sadder Doctor couldn't stay with us. His parrot, Polynesia, would love to fly in space this open.\" Sir Hugo shook his head. \"It truly surprises me this place is in such good condition,\" he murmured. \"This is the battlefield where our smaller battles have been fought. The grass and trees have been ravaged, and yet they continue to flourish as though it's eternal spring. Peaseblossom and the fairies must come here sometimes.\" \"Who?\" Richard asked, but then he remembered. Peaseblossom was a fairy from A Midsummer Night's Dream . She and the other fairies liked to make things pretty and full of springtime. But did it count that theatrical characters were living in a fictional world? In fact, down in the valley, Richard and Chloe could suddenly see tiny balls of sparkling dust come into view. Wherever the balls went, green grass and flowers grew, appearing like magic. \"Fairies!\" Jip exclaimed. \"I don't believe it! Real fairies!\"[Chapter 15] Chapter 15 \"Don't get overexcited, old boy,\" Sir Hugo warned gently. \"The fairies can be easily scared away, especially when a little dog like you can just as easily crush them.\" \"I wouldn't harm a fly,\" Jip reassured him. \"Much less a fairy.\" \"Just don't lose your head,\" Sir Hugo said as the fairies flew upwards. One little pink fairy was leading them. She had long red hair, like Chloe's, and her eyes were large and pink as well. Everything about her glowed bright pink in the afternoon sun, and she trailed a cloud of pixie dust in her wake. \"Oh, what face comes to eye! Sir Hugo!\" The fairy curtsied in her pink dress, and grinned from ear-to-ear. Sir Hugo bowed back. \"Good to see you too, Peaseblossom. Cobweb\"- he acknowledged a fairy dressed in grays and silvers- \"and Mustardseed\" –an extremely tiny fairy decked out in yellows and browns. Sir Hugo also nodded towards two other fairies behind the three leaders- the two fairies that had no names in the play. \"I trust you came to care for the field.\" \"Every hour till eternity,\" Peaseblossom answered. \"But, soft. Dost my sight deceive me? What mysterious angel and prince do I see?\" \"I'm Chloe, and this is Richard,\" Chloe said, nodding her head to acknowledge the fairies. \"Lady and Lord of the Binding Order,\" Sir Hugo added. \"Need I mention that young lady Chloe is also the Proverb of the Imagination?\" Peaseblossom's eyes went wide as saucers and almost immediately, she fluttered to the ground, and the other fairies followed her. She practically threw herself on the ground, hard enough that if her delicate wings had not caught her, she would have broken all her bones. \"Good angel, to thee, we owe our very lives. May the kind saints bless thee with the morrow of a blessed queen!\" \"Oh, you're all very sweet, but I don't think…\" \"But O lady, thy name says all,\" Mustardseed interrupted. \"Only but a Proverb can be high among fictional men. Thou hast the power and immortal beauty…\" Cobweb flew before the other fairies, her grey eyes solemn and dark. \"But endure ungodly news she must.\" \"What do you mean?\" Richard asked. \"Is something going to happen?\" \"Naught but what we hear and see, good lord,\" Cobweb answered. \"All the land we see, every hour. But not all is bright, we fear. Some villain men claimed the forest their own- for the quantity of ungodly hours we know not. Thus we advise- do not travel through the forest beyond in the absence of an escort.\" Richard frowned uncertainly. \"Wait. You aren't saying that…villains are inside the forests right now?\" \"That and nothing more,\" Mustardseed clarified. \"Cobweb speaks the honest truth, I be frank. They have taken the forest prisoner, infiltrating our sisters' homes and performing the demons' work- demons themselves to do such deeds. Poor Oberon's mind shall be sick with fatal news we must bring. And his wife, Titania. What delicate heart she hath. Pray to the almighty gods that she not befall a fate worse than the gods know what.\" Jip looked up at the fairies. \"Have no fear, little fey. I'll sniff them out before dark and we'll take them all prisoner if we must.\" He grinned and put his nose to the ground to start work. Peaseblossom gasped and put her hand on her heart when she noticed Jip and heard him speak. She breathed a sigh of relief, and shook her head sadly at the dog. \"Alas, thou cannot be certain of such things. Thou must not underestimate. Magic is in play- fatal magic. Please, thou wouldst not go into the woods at this hour.\" Sir Hugo stared into the woods beyond, and then shook his head wearily at the fairies, his eyes glinting with determination and strength. \"We do appreciate your services, kind fairies,\" he said. \"But we must go in. We cannot pass through the rotunda without scouting the woods. Terrible things will occur if we do not be sure of what is to come.\" \"Must you go?\" Peaseblossom begged further. \"The villains have full sway of the forest. Our magic can do all but stand against the wicked works of warlocks.\" Richard stepped forth. \"Look, we don't know what's going to happen, but we know what we're doing. And if anything happens, Chloe can use her power to stop them.\" \"Yes, and I can sniff them out from a mile away,\" Jip added, in a sort of bragging way. \"We'll know when there is a villain. So you chaps can sit back and leave the finding to me.\" \"Nonetheless, dost thou fear not of the woods to the sound of the fair nightingale? The moon dost not protect all in the forest.\" Sir Hugo shook his head. \"We must go, even if there are villains. Our findings are crucial to the Pagemaster himself. Even the slightest detail of villain activity is important to him, and to us- the rest of the literary world that wishes to survive.\" \"We have wish to survive,\" Mustardseed piped up. \"Why not let us escort you all into the forest?\" \"Would you?\" Sir Hugo asked. \"Why, that's very gracious of you. I suppose we would like the company for a while.\" \"Proceed on, my lord,\" Peaseblossom said. \"We shall take thee as far as thee wishes.\" She curtsied in midair, her pink lips forming a gracious, delicate smile. \"Thank you very much,\" Chloe said, smiling back at the fairies. \"As we told thee, we will hand our lives to thee when thou requires assistance of us.\" Peaseblossom smiled, then reached for Chloe's hand and kissed it in wholehearted respect. The other fairies followed, kissing Chloe's hand like she was already a queen being greeted by loyal subjects. Richard was confused by such respect, and half hoped they wouldn't keep that up all through their walk. Already his brain hurt from listening to their Shakespearian chatter, and didn't know how much longer he could endure it. When Peaseblossom and the other fairies took the lead, they started to walk along the cliff, leading them along the jungle, and away from the valley. The sun started to dip below the mountains as they went along, soon enough giving the company a beautiful sunset to watch. \"Kind of makes you wonder how far you'd have to walk just to reach the borders of the rotunda,\" Chloe said, pointing at the sun. \"It must be very far.\" \"Not as far as you think, my lady,\" Sir Hugo answered. \"The rotunda is the smallest part of the library, and yet the most powerful. You will know when you have stepped into any given section, because things will change as quickly as an image can come to mind. You'll feel it more too, my lady, when you notice that your powers are weaker. The borders between the sections are invisible, but one can feel them like solid rock.\" \"And how far would you plan on going to reach the end of this scout-around?\" Richard wanted to know. \"Never fear, my boy,\" Sir Hugo answered, with a heavy sigh. \"We are merely traveling throughout the rotunda, no more and no less. We've learned thus far that the villains are keeping their battle strategy to the rotunda, where they may be likely to bend the natural forces in which case the battling comes to a head. If we were to travel every square inch of the fiction section, we would spend thousands of years doing so. And even that wouldn't be enough time to span the entirety of man's imagination in fiction. As I said, the imagination is boundless. It's precisely why we must be careful, so that no villain conspires to perform against lady Chloe's power.\" \"What I'd also like to know is, why the third Proverb hasn't turned up,\" Richard thought out loud. \"I guess it's not like we can just open a book and summon him out.\" Sir Hugo chuckled humorlessly. \"If there was such a way to do so,\" he said. \"I haven't seen the Book of Page Lore in so long, and little lady Chloe doesn't have a clue what it looks like, so she cannot imagine it to life.\" Jip stopped to scratch himself, and then started walking alongside Chloe again. \"I'd count ourselves lucky we haven't been eaten alive yet. Maybe winning this battle is more important than that last Proverb,\" he said with a long yawn. \"And when are we going to stop for the night? I'm pooped as grass in my backyard.\" Chloe gave Jip a confused, and disgusted, look as Sir Hugo pointed ahead. \"When we reach those trees, then we shall make camp for the night.\" He was pointing off to a large grove of trees at the very end of the forest, thick enough that the group couldn't see in or past them- the perfect place to sleep, protected. Finally, when the sun vanished below the mountains altogether, the group stepped inside the trees, and they just about collapsed where they were on the warm, green grass. \"Dost thou wish for us to accompany?\" Peaseblossom asked sweetly, gently taking hold of Sir Hugo's finger. Sir Hugo shook his head, but thanked the fairies before they flittered away into the night, soon becoming nothing but tiny glittering balls in the darkness. Chloe waved one last time though the fairies didn't see her. Then she sat on the ground, and closed her eyes, imagining some beds and a hearty meal for her and her friends. Richard, Jip, and Sir Hugo sat down on their beds to inhale their dinner, meanwhile getting cozy inside the blankets. Jip just about fainted with the pleasure he got from having some good food in his belly. \"Ah, thank you so much,\" he said, letting out a little belch. Embarrassed, he put a paw to his mouth and chuckled. Chloe massaged his head and Jip panted happily, his tail wagging like a fast-paced metronome. Sir Hugo pushed away his empty plate and thanked Chloe, lying back on his bed. But he suddenly had a solemn expression on his face. \"We made a tough journey today,\" he said. \"Perhaps we didn't come across many villains, but we do know that they are gathering faster than we predicted. If only Peaseblossom and the fairies were not so weak against the warlocks…\" He sighed and gazed up at the night sky, full of stars. \"Sweet little things, they are.\" \"You really like them, don't you?\" Chloe said. \"Yes, I do have a soft spot for the fairies,\" Sir Hugo replied softly. \"I only pray that they don't get in trouble tonight.\" Chloe could tell by the tone of Sir Hugo's voice that clearly there was more to the fairies than he said. She had noticed the way he sometimes looked at Peaseblossom, with the faraway look in his eyes that she fancied he never had before… Chloe giggled to herself when she imagined an ordeal like that, and turned to look up at the night sky. She noticed in the far north, the constellation of the Big Dipper, following with her eyes the handle pointing in that direction. Chloe remembered that the rotunda was the core of the imagination, but what about the other sections. Where did they go? \"Sir Hugo, just curious but, in which directions do the sections go?\" she wondered aloud. \"Well, judging by the night sky from here,\" he answered, \"the land of Adventure is located in the north. The country of Fantasy is in the south and east directions. And the region of Horror is in the west. But that, lady, is how to tell by the stars. If you are truly lost, there are also special objects throughout the sections that can always point you in the right direction.\" Sir Hugo sat up and looked Chloe right in the eye, like he was giving her a valuable life-saving lesson. \"Those objects are the lost books scattered around,\" he answered. \"The Pagemaster gave me this advice many times, as he does to all the Pages, and don't you ever forget it. You or the boy.\" \"Richard. His name is Richard,\" Chloe said, correcting Sir Hugo firmly. \"Mm-hmm,\" Sir Hugo said, sounding as though he didn't quite care. \"Nonetheless, my lady, you must never, and I mean never ever , lose faith in the magic of this world. I doubt that you ever will, but always remember- when in doubt, look to the books. If you should ever need assistance, the books will never leave you. Your imagination may be powerful, milady, but the books can easily hold a candle to you too, even without the Proverb of the Books…\" In his bed, Richard sighed softly. Sir Hugo's advice from the Pagemaster rang so many bells from his last adventure here it nearly gave him a headache. He remembered how the books magically came to life whenever they opened, and the feeling of wonder it gave him to see them living and breathing for real. It surprised him that he was only remembering this just now, for now that he thought about it, there were several aspects that had stuck with him through the years. Richard easily recalled the magic of the books, but what he was only starting to remember was probably the most important part of his last journey. What he could say, was that there had been three books- three magic books that had helped him more than anything ever had, and were lost somewhere in this world. But, really, who- or what- were these books he was trying so hard to remember? Would he find them again somewhere? He sighed again when his memory failed him, and looked up at the stars. Well Third Proverb, he thought, wherever you are, let's hope you come to the rescue soon. We need you now, and Chloe is waiting for you. And three magic books…well, let's just hope that your shelf lives haven't been discontinued…[Chapter 16] Chapter 16 Richard woke to the strange, disgusting feeling of Jip licking his face. The dog's rancid breath washed over Richard's face, and he sputtered and coughed in response. \"You up there, Master?\" Jip asked. \"Yeah, but if your breath didn't wake me up, I don't know what would have,\" Richard remarked, raising himself up from the ground, frowning disgustedly. Jip crossed his eyes in confusion. \"My breath smells that awfully?\" he wondered aloud, breathing on his paw and taking a sniff. He made a straining sound in his throat, opening his eyes wide as dinner plates. \"Oh dear Sparky above…\" Jip's eyes rolled to the back of his head dramatically, and he fell onto his back. Chuckling at Jip's reaction, Richard scratched the dog's belly to bring him back. \"Quit that, Jip,\" he said. \"We should get moving.\" \"Quite, and good morning, my boy,\" Sir Hugo greeted. \"I don't suppose you would like to enjoy some breakfast?\" He gestured towards a grand feast laid out for a king! Several different platters and courses covered the grass, like at the Pagemaster's table. A sweetly proud-looking Chloe sat nearby, chomping on some cereal and strawberries. \"Chloe?\" Richard said, in awe of the feast. \"You made all this.\" \"No, Jip coughed it up. Of course, I did,\" Chloe answered with a giggle. \"Imagining all this to life woke me up, but this breakfast is incredible, if I do say so myself.\" She emphasized her words by chomping down on another strawberry. \"Well, go ahead. Eat your fill, both of you.\" When Richard and Jip had both filled up on Chloe's mind-made breakfast, Sir Hugo pushed aside the branches of the trees, and they stepped out into the sun. Richard liked the sun now- it seemed to promise a good day for the group. Immediately, Jip made himself useful by putting his nose to the ground. Chloe kept herself beside the dog, occasionally petting his fur as a reward. He shook with laughter when Chloe scratched and petted, panting like, well, like a happy dog. \"I know we're only minutes into this day, but I think it's gonna be a good one,\" Jip remarked cheerily. \"The larks are on the wing and the sun shining.\" Chloe was not usually one to gossip or tell secrets, but she leaned down to Jip's ear. \"The only thing that would make it better would be if Peaseblossom and the fairies were here,\" she said. \"Seems that Sir Hugo fancies her.\" Jip gasped dramatically, then chuckled. \"Sir Hugo, of all people, fancying a fairy ? That's something you don't hear about all the time. He's such a hardened warrior, and yet he has his eyes on those fairies. Ha, ha. Well, between you and me, I wouldn't be able to withstand those fairies for much longer than I can stand fleas. Their Shakespearian chatter is enough to make a cat bark!\" Chloe giggled with Jip, and scratched his ears, and the dog panted so happily that even Chloe had to smile. Sir Hugo, who was walking beside Richard, flicked his eyes to the sweetness going on between Jip and Chloe. \"I fancy our lady has found a good friend,\" he stated. \"My goodness, that dog could make friends with a hardened criminal and he could become a little boy again with one of Jip's licks.\" He shook his head and half-smiled. \"Guess that's why he was supposed to help us,\" Richard said, half to himself. \"It's true,\" Sir Hugo said. \"He is a good soul. See how he is tending to the lady. It's as though they've been friends from birth.\" Richard had to admit, the bond that had formed between Jip and Chloe was a deep one. Jip had said so himself that he would do everything to protect Chloe, and judging from how she laughed as she scratched his ears, she seemed to feel the same way about the jolly dog. Somehow, Richard wanted to remind Chloe that he was still behind her and that it was not all up to Jip to keep her safe. After all, a dog could only do so much- sniffing and barking were a few things, but he could not wield a sword against evil… As if on cue, Richard jumped out of his boots when he heard Jip growling, low and menacingly. \"Jip?\" Chloe asked, stopping dead in her tracks. \"There's someone…\" He sniffed again. \"No, there's…there's more than someone…there's…there's…here, there…everywhere…a whole bunch of people!\" \"Where are they?\" Sir Hugo asked, preparing to unsheathe his sword. Jip didn't answer; he only shivered in fear. Finally, he said, \"I don't know where they are. They're coming, though. Pretty close now…\" \"Get your weapon ready, boy,\" Sir Hugo warned Richard. \"This might be pretty awful.\" Now, the only noise all around them was Jip's sniffing, and the scratching of his fearful paws against the ground. It was quiet long enough that Richard gave Jip a doubtful glance, as though his sniffing had finally failed them. \"Jip?\" he asked nervously. Then there came a great crashing and tumbling in the nearby bushes as squads of soldiers rolled out from the bushes. The moment they appeared, some of them started to spray a red sort of light from their hands. Sir Hugo held up his sword and deflected the light as he pulled Richard to the ground for safety. \"Milady, Jip, get down! Fight back, do something!\" Sir Hugo shouted as the mysterious attackers fought on. Without thinking, Chloe raised her hands and using her imagination, she created little lightning bolts that flew from her fingertips, which deflected the red magic the attackers were making. She followed that up with a circle of fire encircling the attackers like a pig pen. Her efforts were in vain, however, and the enemies just made it disappear into thin air. \"Her powers are strong, but they can't match us!\" Chloe heard them whisper. This only made her more determined than ever to get rid of these low-life foes. \"Chloe, come here! Let's go!\" Richard shouted at her. \"No! They have to get out of here!\" Chloe answered him. \"They're villains and they have to be stopped where they are!\" Jip jumped up beside Chloe as the attackers finished destroying her fire circle. \"I'll assist you,\" he said. \"A good detective dog never runs away from danger!\" \"And neither should we!\" Chloe shouted to Richard, fixing him with a firm glare. For a moment, Richard was taken aback. Chloe's determined glare was like seeing fangs on a giraffe- something that was new and frightening. Richard was caught in a tangled trap, whether or not he should follow Sir Hugo, or get up and fight with Chloe. He would hate to be the reason something might happen… Richard was jolted from his thoughts again when the attackers let loose a giant ball of red magic. He saw Chloe leap out of the way, but suddenly, all he could see was a disintegrating shower of fireworks and a frightened Jip jumping away. His golden fur was fluttering wildly as he jumped. He landed flat on his stomach, with an oomph! , and scrambled to his feet. \"Jip!\" Richard exclaimed. A jolt in his heartbeat surprised him at the sight of just Jip. \"But, where's Chloe?\" Jip barked suddenly, and both Richard and Sir Hugo turned their glances to the villains behind the fireworks. Each of them had sneers on their faces. \"Incompetent boy,\" one of them sneered. \"Surprised you didn't come and fight back like your fair lady friend. Correct me if I'm wrong but, I believe that the one pretty lady we have here is the Proverb…\" \"No!\" Sir Hugo said to himself, tensing his body in fear. \"…of the Imagination?\" Sir Hugo shut his eyes and turned his gaze away, as though embarrassed. He didn't turn back for a few seconds, and so Richard decided it was all up to him. \"Okay, guys, um, do you think we can come to a peaceful agreement here? You know…something we can trade for Chloe?\" \"Chloe?\" another of the attackers said, turning to Chloe. He ran his hands up and down her arms, as though trying to make them warm; Chloe tensed up and slit her eyes in disgust. \"What a lovely name for a sorceress.\" Jip stepped up and sniffed the attackers, growling low. \"Ahem, who said anything about this girl being a sorceress?\" he asked. \"Does she look like a sorceress to you?\" Jip cringed and ducked his head into his mane of fur; he instantly regretted asking the question. The attackers looked back at Chloe, looking her over while she kept very still and tried to suppress her growing urge to blast her captors with magic again. \"A blind man could see the magic in this lady,\" the first attacker answered Jip. \"Look at how she just… radiates magic. You can feel it!\" At his touch, Chloe finally wrenched her arm away. \"If you could please not touch me like that!\" she said firmly. \"Or, I promise, you'll regret it!\" Richard said, unsheathing his sword. The attackers were quiet for several seconds, before Richard decided to make his move. He was met with a billowing cloud of red sparkles and lasers that threw him backwards. He heard a whimper as Jip and Sir Hugo reacted to his fall. \"Indeed, that's what you think,\" the attackers said. \"Your silly weapons can't protect your lady from our powers. We know who she is.\" Jip jumped up beside Richard, snarling. He barked twice before he spoke. \"If you chaps were smart, you would let go of the girl. I'm warning you, she can pack a punch when she needs to.\" \"You'd best listen to the dog, gentlemen,\" Sir Hugo said, although his disgusted emphasis on gentlemen was pretty clear. \"Oh? Why?\" the captors wondered aloud. Chloe grinned before she imagined the hands touching her to be scorching hot, and the ground underneath her to buckle violently. A hissing and rumbling sounded when the captors started to shout, and jumped back from the buckling ground. Chloe added to her \"punch\" by imagining a floating ring of fire and wind to blow her captors back. The power spread far enough that even Richard, Jip, and Sir Hugo were blown back by her spell. \" That is why!\" Chloe declared, laughing in triumph. The captors pretended to be stunned for a moment, before they fired another round on Chloe. \" That is why you should not toy around with us, young pretty lady,\" they said. Chloe imagined a continuous line of magical blasts one after the other, and her captors fired at her some more. Clouds of blue and red and yellow and all other colors mixed together blasted here and there, like colorful cannonball smoke. Sir Hugo and Richard threw themselves into the brawl, although Richard had been slightly hesitant to do so. Jip barked and growled, pouncing on the attackers, biting down until he could taste blood. Fur flew and blades swung as the battling raged. Richard was tense inside as he tried to prevent the attackers from kidnapping Chloe. He found it hard though, to keep fighting and also look out for his friend; and even harder to succeed because he kept getting knocked down by the captors' magic. Richard fought hard like the warrior he should be, but he was tiring, and fighting blade against magic was too difficult a task. Even Sir Hugo and Jip weren't faring so well, though they were talented fighters. He watched as they fell to the spells the captors cast with their magic. Richard didn't understand. Chloe was powerful, so why wasn't her magic killing the captors off quickly? Maybe she was tiring too, but Richard had never seen that in her. Her determination had always been all that she needed to stay strong. But then again, watching how the attackers fought as one against one powerful Proverb, Richard found that maybe he could doubt Chloe's capacity for determination alone. He needed to do something, but just using his sword wouldn't do him any good, and his arm was feeling like watery jelly. Richard wrapped his brain around what he could do, but his brain seemed to have turned off in that instant… …and in that moment, he was met with a heart-stopping horror when he saw Chloe's fiery hair fly over her face and to the ground when one of the attackers slapped her clear across her face. She stumbled to the ground, and they surrounded her, as if they were vultures circling a dead mouse. \"No!\" Richard shouted on impulse. And no was right! No! No way was he going to let them take her! Not now! Suddenly, Richard's mind came back to life, and it filled with an echoing sound of book titles that rattled like thunder through him; no matter what, the titles ran through his mind like an everlasting tape. He was remembering the Pagemaster's advice all too well, and he knew that now was a good time to harness the books' content to save Chloe. Before he even knew it, Richard was calling out, \" Sleeping Beauty, the forest of thorns ,\" all at the same time pointing into a copy of the book that had come from out of nowhere. As quickly as he had called out the words, Richard felt a surge of energy flow through his body, and suddenly, there came a tearing sound from beneath the ground. Out from beneath the trees, a great forest of prickly thorns shot upward, blackening the land around them with the sharp branches and razor-sharp thorns that tore at the land around them. And aside from the tearing sounds the thorns made as they grew, all was silent. Even Jip's barking and the sword slashing had stopped. But when Richard glanced at the very edge of the thorn forest, there was no sign of the attackers, or Chloe. She was gone. Richard's heart nearly stopped when he realized how late he had been in saving Chloe. He had been so caught up in what was happening inside his mysterious mind that he just couldn't save her in time. In anger, Richard kicked the ground and let out a yell! He just could not believe it! The Proverb of the Imagination was supposed to be protected, and all he had done- instead of being a good guardian to Chloe- was let her get kidnapped. Who knew what the villains would do with her! \"Chloe!\" Richard shouted in anger and disbelief. \"Calm down, boy, hush up!\" Sir Hugo urged, pulling Richard back. And suddenly, without any explainable reason, Richard was quiet, as he had just realized what he saw before him. The forest of thorns, which had come from out of a book, was plain as the nose on his face. But…how did they get there? All that had happened was that he called for a certain book and the object he was looking for had just…come… Richard's realization was astounding, but he refused to believe it. \"Sir Hugo,\" he began, \"did you…?\" He gestured at the forest of thorns. Sir Hugo only shook his head, a shocked but amazed expression on his face. Richard turned to Jip, but he only shook his head, his eyes wide open with the same shock as Sir Hugo. Now, it finally dawned on Richard. And he suddenly felt so much bigger…and yet so smaller… The Third Proverb was found. And that Proverb was here…in his place. TO BE CONTINUED… ","Summary":" Chapter 1 Clonk! Bang! Scratch! A baseball went sailing over the field, the bat hitting the moist, "},{"Movie":"Pagemaster","Title":"Proverbs of the Sections","Author":"GreenWallsOfArt","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6020107","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Chapter 1 The incessant barking coming from Jip's mouth, plus the howling storm outside the tent the group had pitched was more than Richard could bear in a second. He had zipped his sleeping bag shut all the way so that he was in complete darkness, and yet the sounds from outside were as clear as day. Oftentimes Richard had to suppress the urge to scream and yell at Jip until the dog's ears would bleed. But something- something unknown- was stopping him. Richard didn't know what he was going to do. His very soul was in utter turmoil after what had happened that afternoon; first with Chloe, and then discovering that he, he , was the third Proverb, the Proverb of the Books who could summon out the forces of any book. He couldn't believe that any of it had happened because it all happened within the blink of an eye, quicker than anyone, even Chloe, could have imagined. Just thinking of Chloe sent Richard reeling into a spell of guilt and a whirlwind of emotion swept through him so that he could barely breathe or think. If only he had just thought faster, then maybe Chloe would still be with them. And why on earth did he have to discover this power at the wrong moment? Chloe was in trouble and in the same moment, his power had only made her captors run even faster! Of all the moments in the world, he had only assisted in the kidnapping of his best friend! For the first time in several years, Richard found himself brewing tears in his eyes. His guilt rocked him to his core, and not even saccharine comforting from Sir Hugo or Jip could help him, no not in a million years. His power was the reason that the second most powerful person in the literary universe was gone. And who knew what treacherous things the kidnappers were doing to her! \"Master, you all right in there!\" Jip barked. \"You sleeping through that whopper out there?\" \"No!\" Richard groaned, turning over in his sleeping bag just like a grumpy teenager on a Monday. \"Just looking out for you,\" Jip said, putting a paw on Richard's body. \"I know how hard you must be taking this. Believe me; I'm shocked and dismayed that we failed to protect Chloe. It seems as though my own master has disappeared from existence.\" His voice dropped to a low, sad tone and there was a thump on the ground, like the dog had just dropped himself down completely. Richard shook his head, still not coming out. \"No, Jip, you don't understand. You and Sir Hugo were all right. It's my fault that Chloe was kidnapped. If I had been looking out for her when my power just came out of nowhere, then she'd be here.\" Then Richard felt the sleeping bag slip away, as Jip peeled it away with his teeth. He dropped the fabric when Richard's head was uncovered, and then plopped down beside him. \"You know, at least we narrowed our journey down a little bit,\" he said. \"We have found the third Proverb, now we just have to find our lady friend. Your power may just help us find her. And I think we're going to see some amazing things from you in the next few days, I can tell you that. None of us have seen or heard of the Proverbs in decades, maybe centuries, and you can help us save this world.\" \"Never heard that before,\" Richard said sarcastically under his breath. \"I may be a detective's pup, but I know what I want to see,\" Jip clarified. \"With Chloe out of our hands, you might be our only hope.\" Richard shook his head and stood up. \"You don't get it do you, Jip?\" he asked, on the brink of an outburst. \"We can't put this whole thing on my shoulders. This adventure was- is - all about me and Chloe, saving this world together. Apparently, I'm only the Proverb of the Books-\" he said those words like they were basketball team water boy \"-and am not nearly as powerful as Chloe. Besides, the Proverb of the Books is the Imagination's guardian. It's not up to me to just sit here and wait for her to be let go. That would take years with their magic. We'd be lucky if Chloe could get out by herself.\" Jip nodded his head. \"'Tis very true, very true,\" he agreed. \"But, my boy, how are we- you - going to save her?\" Richard took a deep breath. He now realized what he was getting himself into, and although he was frightened of his decision, he knew that he would hate himself for doing otherwise. \"I'm going to go out and find her. I'll use my new power to help me find her.\" Sir Hugo suddenly turned around from watching the storm outside. \"Boy, what are you saying?\" he asked, looking at Richard like he was a lunatic. \"This world is too vast and unpredictable for an inexperienced warrior such as yourself to be running into alone. You would have to hope that your power will never fail you- otherwise would mean certain death!\" Richard couldn't quite explain why, but going out alone to save Chloe was more than just a crazy adventure. It was a mission, a goal, an impassable wall! Without Chloe, the literary world would fall apart with the despair the Pagemaster would befall, and Richard would live with the guilt for a long, long time, maybe for life. The absence would upset many, and all that she had met. And Richard knew well what it would do to this world, his world, and to he himself. She was a good part of his life now, and even he would feel a deep void without her. Even so, despite the dangers that would lie on the road ahead, Richard found a lingering confidence that he could do it. It wasn't that he wanted to; it was that he had to. \"Are you so confident as to do this?\" Sir Hugo asked skeptically. Richard folded his arms and looked Sir Hugo right in the eye. \"Yes. Yes, I am.\" Sir Hugo clearly was unsure of what to answer, and he found himself looking down at Jip, who let out a pleading bark. Then Sir Hugo sighed deeply, and reluctantly turned his gaze back to Richard, putting a hand on his shoulder. \"Truly, lad, you have fought some good battles in your time,\" he said, semi-proudly. \"But you must also remember that lives are on the line if you fail in your mission. As I told you, this is a vast and unpredictable world, and even the most skilled of sorcerers and warriors can be led astray. Use your ability to the very greatest capacity, and always trust yourself. You must seize the courage!\" \"I swear it!\" Richard promised, nodding his head and raising his right hand to his oath. Sir Hugo sighed, as if he were a father saying goodbye to a college-bound son, and taking in another deep breath, suddenly reached his hands around Richard and gave him a hug. Surprised, Richard returned the hug and smiled. Richard and Sir Hugo let go, and they both sat down, Jip lying down next to Richard. \"Okay,\" Richard murmured. And finally, as he lay down to rest, the storm outside seemed to disintegrate and flee, although far off in the distance, there was still the faint sound of thunder, a sound that echoed in Richard's sleepy ears.[Chapter 2] Chapter 2 Chloe lay unconscious somewhere, somewhere far away from her friends or any sign of life. On her back, her bow had slid from her quiver, and her arrows were scattered in different directions across the dirty ground. Just like her arrows, her hair and dress were scratched and torn, splattered on the rotting grass, somewhat of a mark of light and beauty to illuminate the darkness. Twilight had gone, and the last few rays of cheery sun gone with the battles she had fought. In the dark mist just outside the grim castle, a stale wind blew across the porch, stripping away some croaky dead leaves to reveal a sign on the creaky door. But it was a dusty sign so it only said, \"Castle\". The door creaked open, and there stood a tall man clad all in black against the light from inside the castle, like a wicked shadow. His outfit was devoid of any color, and his eyes seemed to glow with a red-hot ecstasy at the sight of the beautiful warrior unconscious outside his door. He laid eyes on her fire hair, withering like Medusa's in the breeze, and her glowing silver gown, tarred from the toil she suffered in battle. Despite her condition, the man felt he was looking at an angel. But her scent- the scent of that beautiful red something- made her even more bewitching. \"What is this?\" the man asked, his voice flowing through his lips in a dark, smooth accent. \"A woman? My castle?\" Slowly, the hard, cruel look in his eyes softened to a subtle wickedness, and the claw-like fingers rose to form an open claw, as if it was clenching around a ripe apple. But his eyes glowed with a fiery power, and he fixed them upon the princess-like maiden unconscious at his door. \"Come here, my love,\" he intoned smoothly, a concentrated force edging on his blood-red lips. At that instant, Chloe stood up, her arms still slumped at her side. She began to trudge towards the castle, slowly becoming a sleepy walk that moved with mechanical stealth. Her eyes were open now, and she had a wild look in her eyes, like an animal; very much like the gaze of the man as he pulled her in with his hypnotic power. And in those very eyes, the desire pumping behind them was enough that his undead heart could begin to awaken again. That tiny little heart in the maiden was beating steadily, the sound ringing like thunder. His claws tensed tighter with her every step- she was coming closer… Chloe was laid on top of a bed, her arms sprawled over the pillows and her legs turned in and out of the pale sheets. Her breathing was slow and steady, and the room was quiet and still, but she was not far from danger. The tall man stood over her bed, leaning over Chloe and reaching for her with a tense grip waiting on his hands. His eyes were fixed on her neck, lying exposed beneath her turned head of tiger-lily hair. They were now blazing with a demonic red that seemed to have transformed him into an undead version of the devil. \"My child, my beautiful child,\" he whispered deeply, \"at last…you are here.\" Slowly, Chloe began to stir. Her eyes twitched for a moment before they opened, and she moaned silently as she stretched her arms, tousling the sheets. She blinked a few times before she laid eyes on the tall man in black leaning over her, with his red eyes shimmering in the dim moonlight raining down from the high window across from the bed. \"Who are you?\" she asked in a whisper that hid a small fright. Her heart sped up, and the twinkle in the man's eyes grew, like a few large stars twinkling together in harmony. Far from it. The man stood still, his face just inches from hers, the eyes still open and blazing demonic red. He raised himself up from her, and as he did, Chloe studied him with cautious eyes. This man seemed awfully familiar to her, like she had seen him in a dream, or maybe in a movie or a book somewhere. His face was subtle and soft as he met her eyes, but yet fixed and cruel. The skin was snow-white and seemed fluorescent, even in the darkness. And those eyes- those eyes - the color of blood on a deathly wound. When Chloe looked deep into the horrific color, she suddenly found some strength again and backed a few inches on the bed, stumbling when her leg caught on her long sleeve. \"Count Dracula,\" Chloe whispered, her fear beginning to surface in her voice. \"Lady Chloe,\" the Count whispered in a similar tone, except with lust and wanting. \"We meet, at last. I have waited for many a century for you to come…to me. And now, we must make haste. Your blood makes music, and I should like to hear it.\" Chloe shook her head, clutching the covers of the bed around her. \"No. I don't want you to. Please, don't.\" By this time, Chloe was more than frightened, she was getting the feeling that unless something happened mysteriously by magic, or that Richard would come charging through the door for her, she was doomed. She was face-to-face with the most terrifying and evil villain in horror fiction, and without some feat of magic or luck, it seemed impossible to survive. \"Pleading will not do you good, my lady,\" the Count said. He then knelt down and placed his hand on Chloe's arm. She shuddered loudly- the Count's skin was winter-cold, and seemed to burn through her own. His grip on her arm felt like a clamp that had been melted there and would never let go of her, and Chloe could feel her arm go numb. Then, the Count placed his other hand on Chloe's cheek, and once again she shuddered. Chloe was preparing to scream so someone outside the castle might hear her, but the Count's cold grip dashed all thoughts from her mind except that it was just the two of them there. Gently, the Count turned her to face him and stroked her cheek with his thumb, his other hand reaching from her shoulder down towards her chest, where he grazed the fabric of her dress, and then the tender skin beneath it. He didn't squeeze it, but merely stood like a statue, as though waiting for Chloe to make a move. When she didn't, the Count made a grab for her shoulder, pulling her so that her breasts were squished against his chest, her body having no space between them at all. She groaned in shock, waiting while the Count took one swipe of his talon into his robe. The fabric peeled away and the skin underneath began to turn red. Chloe smelled the rusty scene of blood beneath her nostrils and her heart went into overdrive when she realized what was finally happening. \"Drink,\" the Count whispered in a raspy, yet calm voice. And not too later afterwards, for no explicable reason, she began to wish that the Count would kiss her with those blood-red lips and keep her there, her eyes closing dreamily to await his pure bite. Instantly Chloe shook her head. No , she yelled to herself inside her mind. You shall not fall under his spell. That will destroy the Pagemaster, Richard…oh, Richard. Richard, please, hurry. I'm as close to death as I can come, and I need you! Chloe shut her eyes tighter and tried to keep her mind on Richard, so as not to push herself deeper into the spell the Count was casting on her. \"You have a strong will, my lady,\" the Count whispered. \"I can feel you…your heart beats with a will as powerful as the Pagemaster himself. It is too late for him, or his soldiers, to save you. You are mine…for all eternity. Come. Join me forever as my partner, and later on, my helper.\" Slowly, the Count's hand moved down from Chloe's cheek, and brushed her neck with a lingering, pleasurable power as he stopped with his hand over her heart. His eyes glowed brighter red and suddenly, his cold touch turned warm. While Chloe couldn't deny that the Count's pull was strong as a storm, she refused to fall any closer to him than she already had. In that instant, Chloe felt a sharp pain on her neck, and she was struck with panic as she came to terms with what the Count was doing to her. Her mind raced; she wanted to do something or make something happen, anything to get her out of this before she met the same fate as the Count's other victims- becoming a vampire herself. But what could she do? She was no witch or magician, so it wasn't like she could make anything happen by magic. Or could she? Chloe remembered how she had imagined those shadows into oblivion, and they had gone away altogether just by the power of her will. They were in the literary world, and in a world like this, it was possible for anything to come alive. Chloe searched her mind once more for something that might distract Dracula while she got away, and then after making a decision, opened her hand out at the floor beside the bed, and pictured a million grains of salt clacking on the floor. Out of thin air, a million salt crystals appeared on the floor and they made a shushing sound as they scattered. At that instant, Chloe pushed the Count off her as hard as she could, and dashed for the door, as fast as she could go. For good measure, she left a trail of salt crystals behind her, courtesy of her imagination, and fortunately, she found that the Count was not following her. And good riddance, she thought. Her heart threatening to explode through her skin, Chloe ran out of the castle, breathing quickly and sharply. She was going so fast she was unaware of the fact that she had left her bow and arrows behind in the bedroom. And even if she did remember, she wouldn't have cared. The most dangerous villain of all horror fiction had almost made her one of them ! All that mattered now was just getting out of this place alive. Chloe barely made it to the edge of the castle grounds when she was met with a loud, inconceivable screeching in her ears. It was a cross between an inhuman scream and that of an animal- a bat, most likely. Her heart hammered painfully when she thought of what could have made that sound. Fearfully, Chloe turned around, and noticed the silhouettes of three women, all very faint, but their identities were recognizable to Chloe, even in the dim moonlight. \"Come, sister,\" one of the women murmured. \"You are hungry. We are as well.\" \"I don't pretend to know what you're saying,\" Chloe said. \"Of course you don't,\" another woman said, her voice so musical and sweet that Chloe found her guard coming off again. \"Come to us. Leave this place behind and come to us, sister.\" The women reached out their hands to Chloe, sweetly beckoning her to them like they were her aunts. But Chloe knew better. To survive these devilish women- Dracula's three vampire brides- she would have to blast them with her power. It would be nasty, but she would be able to continue on her way out of the place. Closing her eyes, Chloe plugged her nose and thought with all her might. The dank air around the castle grounds instantly became pungent with the smell of something thick and spicy. Chloe, of course, didn't mind the smell once she took a few sniffs, but the three women reacted completely differently. The women's eyes bulged out so that they might have fallen right from their white faces. Their eyes went red, and steam began to rise from their skin when a thick, yellow-beige vapor rose around them. \"Garlic!\" one woman screeched, her voice sounding like a snarling and rabid animal. \"Scraggly little wench!\" another said. With eyes red as the devil, the same woman lunged for Chloe, but she blasted her with another cloud of garlic vapor, turning the air yellow around them. While the three women's eyes turned bloodshot, and their skin burned, Chloe turned on her heel and shot for the trees outside the grounds. She couldn't hear the women screeching much anymore as she ran and for the first time, her heart felt a slow beating, which relaxed her. Tucking her cape around her, she tried to breathe and forget where she was. Despite her recent bravery, she couldn't find much comfort in where she was. Her fright getting the best of her, Chloe imagined that she was back in the rotunda with her friends. But when she finally had the image clear in her mind, she felt a jolt in her stomach and a headache creep its way into her brain. Chloe put her hands to her temple in response to the pain, wincing. All the worse, was that she was not facing the cliffs and forests of the sunny rotunda. Frustrated, Chloe grunted when she remembered what limits her ability had now that she wasn't in the rotunda. The natural forces couldn't be bent as well, and she could now only make things appear. She couldn't create or destroy life out of thin air, nor could she transport herself anywhere. Could be worse though , she thought in an attempt to console herself. I could be dangling from a tree about to be fed to the wolves . But one thing was for sure. It was going to be a long day if she couldn't make it out of the horror section. A long and difficult journey…[Chapter 3] Chapter 3 It was annoying to Richard, really. Every time that he stepped down to the ground, he came upon a living flower that was sprouting a book. The flower would writhe and screech until Richard cut it in half with his sword, silencing the bratty thing forever. Ahead of him, Richard saw nothing but open sky, grassy plains, and a just-as-plain long journey. All of a sudden, half of him was asking, \"Why did I even say that I would take this journey, when clearly I don't even know where I'm supposed to go?\" But just like those snappy flowers, he was getting annoyed and cranky and tired, wishing he could just return to Sir Hugo and Jip. Richard then stopped, and plopped down on a rock, straightening his cape which was now damp with the sweat that drenched the back of his shirt. He never expected the rotunda to be so hot; if he didn't know better, he'd have thought that he was in the adventure section, where the beaches and surrounding areas were always hot. Of course, he had played baseball in weather this hot, but wearing his cape and thick boots was unbearable compared to the thin socks and jersey he wore for games. Sighing, Richard put his brain to work, thinking of different clothes he could wear from one, specific story. Finally, all that he could come up with was The Emperor's New Clothes, peasant clothes. His reasoning was that downplaying the wardrobe would make no one suspect that he was a Proverb. Not that Richard wanted people to believe he was a weak-kneed peasant; he just didn't want to draw too much attention to himself. This trip had to move along quickly, because as far as Sir Hugo was concerned, the war between the heroes and villains would soon come to a head, and the villains could more easily use Chloe for ransom or bait for the Pagemaster's growing army. By now, it was certain that the villains knew what Chloe's power could get them, and Richard didn't need to think twice to figure what those things could be. What also made Richard nervous was which villains were holding Chloe hostage. Judging from the powers the attackers had, that villain had to be powerful, and a magical one at that. Unfortunately, Richard couldn't bring himself to think of who that villain was- and good thing too, he thought. His focus was just on figuring out where Chloe might be, and using his power to figure it out. All this time Richard had wrapped his worried, sleepless brain around things he could conjure to help him find Chloe. It was not the easiest thing he ever did, and it didn't help him to remember that the clock was ticking and Chloe desperately needed him. Sighing deeply again, Richard leaned his cheek against his cupped palm. He just was not sure where to go next, and it certainly wasn't like he could just turn around and go back to Sir Hugo and Jip. If he returned, they'd be sorely disappointed and they'd hate him for not even trying. Sir Hugo had warned him though… Suddenly, a wave of thoughts hit Richard like a tsunami. Images of the attackers' magical powers came to mind, and he knew instantly what he could do. He thought back to what Sir Hugo had told Chloe about the sections, running them through his mind one more time. \"The adventure section is up north. The horror section is west, and the fantasy section, the largest one, is in the south and east…\" All right, so now all he had to do was travel to the southeast and then scout out Chloe from there. Excited that he now had some direction to his travel, Richard's brain instantly woke up and he could think better about which stories had a compass in it. Finally, Richard looked at his hand and thought, Treasure Island, compass . A bent, rusty compass appeared in his hand, but Richard was excited enough that he now knew where he had to go, that he never really noticed what shape it was in. Holding it in the air, Richard read the dial. The black handle that was supposed to point took its time, but it was finally able to point off in some direction. Richard was happy to see that the compass was working, so he didn't waste any time making a move towards the southeast, where he would make off for the fantasy section- to where Chloe was sure to be…[Chapter 4] Chapter 4 Chloe had never been more thankful for anything in all her life. If she didn't have her power, she suspected that she'd be dead; more like undead , she corrected herself. Even as Chloe walked through the spooky woods with her cape fastened tight around her neck and her hood billowing low over her face, her heart was pounding like a bass drum so hard that she felt her pulse in her brain. It reminded her of the days when she was sick with a cold and when her nose was stuffed, she could feel the pulse of her heart reverberating through her skull like a dank bell. This was nearly the precise feeling she had, and she didn't think it was all too pleasant. Chloe was, at the very least, glad to have some protection from the elements inside her warm cape. The velvet was a reminder that she would stay safe and that her power would not fail her; especially now, when danger was all around her no matter where she was. That was the way the horror section worked for her- horror and danger were both kept hidden inside the trees, the houses and buildings, and even under the ground she walked on. It didn't help either that, every now and then, the musty wind would gather around her feet and chill her like a winter breeze. Every shiver shook her greatly, and was a terrible discomfort when she was feeling frightened enough. Taking an immense breath, Chloe glanced behind her at the opening to the woods. To her relief, she couldn't even see it anymore, much less a way back to the castle. It would be hard enough for the vampire brides to come back for her, and just as well, she hoped that Dracula would not come after her either. As much as she loved his story, she hated the devious count like she hated bullies. For good measure, Chloe envisioned the castle encased in a vapor of yellow-beige. She flashed her hands out towards the castle, and her imagination flew out her fingers, the yellow-beige fog rolling around the gates and spires. The fog was so pungent that now, not even Chloe could stand the smell of garlic. Pleased with herself, she walked further into the woods, closing herself in a tiny cloud of rosy-smelling air to keep from the awful garlicky smell. Nearby, Chloe suddenly heard a low, scratchy cough. She stood very still, preparing to protect herself in case the invisible being was an enemy. It was more than likely, she reasoned, that some villain could be stalking her, and she was ready to kill if need be. But Chloe was shocked to see that, instead of a villainous person bearing a weapon, a lean black cat was coming out of the trees. Its tail was curling into its body, and it opened its mouth to let loose a loud sneeze. When it did, its fangs gleamed in the gloomy darkness, and despite her readiness, Chloe was instantaneously nervous. In this world, she wasn't sure who she could trust. \"Kitty?\" she mustered. The cat looked up from recovering from the sneeze with its large eyes, and pricked its ears. \"Kitty?\" a voice from the cat suddenly said. \"That's not my name. I don't have one.\" Chloe gasped in a whisper of breath, and stood still where she was. \"Um…sorry. I didn't know that you would be coming out. I just…I just didn't know what to call you.\" \"Clearly,\" the cat said, arching its body and then sitting down to lick its paws. When it was finished, it looked back up at Chloe with curiosity in its eyes. \"As I said, I don't have a name. Cats don't need them. Only humans need names to distinguish one from the other. We're all the same, and that is the way we prefer it.\" Chloe recognized that speech. \"The Cat…from Coraline .\" \"Right you are- a first for you,\" the cat said. \"Then I think you'll recognize that I like to come and go as I please myself. These woods are too dank for a creature like me to stay for long.\" The cat turned on its heel and began to stalk away. \"Whoa, wait up a minute,\" Chloe said. \"Can't you help me get out of these woods? As long as you don't point me back to the castle that would be extremely helpful now.\" The cat stopped and looked back at Chloe. \"A way out?\" he asked. \"There are many ways out of here. You just walk in any direction, and you'll just keep walking and walking until you come out. It's that simple.\" \"Not exactly,\" Chloe said. \"There has to be a path, or a landmark or something that points the way to someplace other than the woods.\" \"Clearly you're new in this place,\" the cat said snidely. \"This place has no paths. It's as big and ever-changing as the universe itself. My mind's eye could span maybe, a half of it. Your mind is barely big enough to fit into a speck of dust, so you couldn't possibly imagine that.\" Chloe stood upright with angry surprise. \"What are you saying?\" she said sharply. \"That I'm stupid?\" \"Anyone would know that a place inhabited by fictional people and such would not have direct paths or predictability. The sections have permanent location and direction. But within each one, you never know what you'll come across.\" Chloe shook her head, frustrated. \"All right, fine, kitty-cat. If you won't tell me where to go, I'll just go my own way, you'll go yours, and I'll take this on myself.\" She began to walk away when the cat started to catch up to her. It stopped when it noticed that Chloe would not give it a sideways glance. \"Excuse me,\" the cat said. \"I do not mean to make you angry. I'm only giving you the truth about this place. And in any case, in a place like this, what on earth are you doing wandering here alone?\" \"I was kidnapped,\" Chloe explained. \"Count Dracula and his brides just tried to make me one of them. It was a narrow escape, and anyway, it's not like I have relatives I can call up in the horror section. I'm just trying to get out of here and find my friends- in the rotunda, to be exact.\" The cat's eyes went wide and then he grinned. \"Very good, so I see you have some direction in your adventure. Tell me. What kind of friends are you looking for?\" Chloe then proceeded to tell all about Richard, Sir Hugo, and Jip, and their adventures in the jungle, and with the fairies. The cat bowed its head respectfully, if only for a second. \"You met the Pagemaster? I certainly hope you kept your wits together. Being in his very presence, to some of us, is something we can only dream of.\" \"He's my friend,\" Chloe replied. \"He's counting on me and Richard to lead his army to war.\" \"Why such two small ones leading a war?\" the cat asked. \"You look like you couldn't lift a sword three inches above your shoulders.\" \"You don't, huh?\" Chloe challenged. \"Take this, and try it for size. I can not only lift a sword, but when I'm inside the rotunda, I can create life and destroy it out of thin air. While I'm in any other ordinary section, I can create only objects and any physical matter…using my imagination.\" The cat looked skeptical, so Chloe shut her eyes. A second later, in a burst of sparkling balls and a pop, a golden cat basket with red velvet upholstery sparkled before them. The cat meowed and stopped dead in its tracks when it spotted the gilded basket. \"What in the…?\" \"Think I'm kidding you now?\" The cat just stared at the basket. \"I haven't seen magic like this since she created the Other world.\" \"She? Oh, the Other Mother?\" The cat nodded his furry black head. Turning around, he bowed his head low and purred softly. \"Good to be meeting you,\" he said. \"This is only something that we can dream of here, and…something tells me the Other Mother would like to challenge you in a battle of wits one day.\" Chloe shook her head. \"No thank you.\" \"Oh, I think I'm the only one of my story around here,\" the cat reassured her. \"Because she can't stand competition here. You are a Proverb. And a Proverb never loses a battle, I'm sure.\" He said this last part sort of sarcastically. Chloe rolled her eyes. The cat still didn't seem to believe her. \"You don't understand, do you?\" she asked. \"I'm the Proverb of the Imagination ! I'm supposed to be able to conquer anything as long as the gears are still turning.\" \"Sorceresses like you do have power, but the Other Mother isn't the only possible danger here,\" the cat said in a low voice. \"There are things around here I'm sure even you couldn't imagine.\" \"What makes you say that?\" Chloe was actually starting to get gooseflesh from the way the cat talked to her. \"No one around here can resist a pretty little girl walking around alone,\" the cat explained. \"Your power doesn't show itself, and so most will think you're only a helpless girl. So, I hope you realize what you are setting yourself up for.\" \"And I do.\" \"So, you do,\" the cat murmured sarcastically. \"Nonetheless, I'd watch your back if I were you. Even when up against the most powerful of sorcerers, one can still wield great power and brains. I've seen tiny girls trick witches beyond repair, and believe me, the outcomes are never pretty for the superior forces.\" Chloe nodded. \"Yes, well, do you still think you can stay with me? You know, as company?\" She was afraid of what the cat might say, because judging from its sarcastic nature, well, she couldn't deny the possibility of the cat not liking her. The cat answered by leaping in front of Chloe, and purring long and audibly. It grinned with its large eyes up at her. \"Good kitty,\" Chloe said. With the cat leading her, Chloe wrapped her cloak tighter and prepared to walk deeper into the woods. Even with the cat at her side, she still couldn't help but feel tense. That was why she kept her mind open in case of an attack. Her imagination would be vital to both her, and the cat's, survival. \"Now, do you really think that you'll reach your friends before the villains gather?\" the cat wondered aloud. \"The sections cross such a vast space that it'll be a miracle for you to make it to the end before the end of this week.\" A low, frightening voice broke the silence, and both Chloe and the cat jumped, both gasping loudly. Nervously, they listened through the trees and heard two men talking. Their voices were low and gruff, monster-like. \"The heroes- they're gathering together.\" \"Yes, but have you noticed we're doing the same?\" \"The word's been spreading.\" The voice paused for several moments before going on. \"The Proverbs has been found. The Imagination and the Books are on the loose, and they're gathering the other heroes for their army.\" \"They're here? But, I thought the Proverbs were lost to the pages of time.\" \"That's what we all thought. Until they miraculously appeared in the rotunda and revealed their powers. But then, Count Dracula found the Proverb of the Imagination wandering around after she had been taken prisoner by the warlocks, and he has her in his hands.\" \"He doesn't!\" \"Oh, yes. He's planning to use her, for reasons I do not know yet, but when he's finished with her, he'll dispose of her in ways that no one, not even she , can imagine.\" Chloe looked away, and finally, after several moments of silence, gave her answer. \"I hope. Alive.\"[Chapter 5] Chapter 5 At this point in time, the only thing Richard thought of was some of Sir Hugo's advice- \"when you reach the end of a section, you will know\". He was waiting impatiently for that feeling to come, because, as far as he knew, he had been walking a hundred miles and the rotunda still stretched on. He glanced at his compass. It still pointed north, leading him in the direction he planned to go. All around, Richard heard the sounds of birds calling, a rushing river nearby, and the trees rustling under the influence of a crisp breeze. All in all, a comforting, normal atmosphere, but Richard never paid that mind. It was all occupied by his desperation to exit the rotunda and finally find the fantasy section. Richard had, only recently, nearly killed himself climbing a great hill, from which at the top, he got a similar view to what he had seen earlier. And from there, his eyes spotted something that he hadn't even thought to look for. The glowing green exit sign. Even against the blazing blue sky, the sign stayed as visible as it did at night, cradled inside a tiny cluster of puffy white clouds. It stared back at Richard, seeming to gloat, laughing at him. Six years ago, that sign had been one of direction, of hope. But, now, Richard only wanted to spit at it. It taunted him with the tempting idea of leaving the library and going back to a normal routine every day; as if that was even likely when you were expected to lead a war that you might not live to see such a sign again. Shaking his head, and resisting the urge to yell out at the exit sign, Richard started down the hill, taking one step at a time through the long blades, which wavered in a gentle valley breeze. The smell the grass gave off suddenly reminded Richard of the smell that came after his dad mowed the front and back lawns of their house. It was a comforting smell, and for a fraction of a second, Richard felt at peace during this journey. It briefly brought him back to life back home- lounging in the backyard with his dad after Saturday chores, chowing down on pizza with his friends after a good baseball game, and of the lazy summer days he was supposed to have before Chloe entered his world. Although, remembering such things put a heavy weight on his heart, and it took loads of willpower to not think about them. Chloe was his first and only priority, and Richard intended to keep it that way as long as he was still inside the library! At the bottom of the hill, Richard pushed through some dense bushes, poking himself with the thin branches, but remaining wholly unscathed. And like before, when he was still joined by his friends in the jungle, he found himself on the outside of a woodsy forest. The calling of birds and the gentle mixture of other animals mingled in the air, along with the familiar babble of a river. Richard halted his step, suddenly feeling like at any moment, another Shere Khan would surprise him with a growl and then chop him into tiny pieces with his teeth. But when he was finally able to recognize the gentle chirp of a nearby sparrow, did he move forward into the forest. The earth moved gently with his feet when he stepped onto it, softly crunching under his shoe. He jumped, however, when a chipmunk scurried out from the ground underneath him, but he kept moving when the little creature hurried away into the woods. For good measure still, Richard kept his hand on the handle of his sword, feeling a tiny surge of strength and certainty flow through him. That feeling brought forth the not too distant memory of when he had fought the dragon in the fantasy section, and saved his friends, earning him some well-deserved courage to keep for many more years. Of course, he froze when he thought of the same dragon perhaps confronting Chloe, all alone and without protection. She was the Proverb of the Imagination, but that didn't mean she still didn't need her guardian close by. The speed increased in Richard's step when he remembered that simple fact. Even closer now, was the sound of the river, but the farther Richard walked, the lesser the sound was. In fact, there was another, even greater sound overcoming it. It was the low, but sharp, hum of several voices, like the sound of a cheering crowd from a distance. Only the voices didn't quite sound like cheering. It was something completely the opposite…like… …screaming. Richard quickly broke into a speed-walk when he recognized the sound. And the closer he got, the more he could point out the source of the screaming. The voices were high and low altogether, like the cries of a whole bunch of young children. And, why was there the smell of rye in the air? Following the sounds, Richard finally came out of the forest, and to the rushing river that separated the forest from a vast field made entirely of strands of rye. The rye bent in beautiful waves in the wind, moving underneath the crisp clouds casting tiny shadows over the field. The field was growing all the way until the sky met the ground, but on the horizon, Richard could spot a great mass of something moving with the rye. The voices accompanied it, and with the loudness of them now, there was no denying where Richard was going next. The rye field was much too big to cross on foot, so Richard immediately put his mind to work thinking of something to get there faster. Whatever was happening on the other end of the field could be something terrible, and Richard was not about to risk something with that great a chance of danger to happen. Finally, he extended his hands and was about to call out his choice of travel when, suddenly, something sharp and tight grabbed him by his hands. A great rush shoving all throughout him, Richard let out a loud yell as he was carried higher and higher into the sky over the rye field. He kicked his legs and yelled louder in panic as the great bird that had picked him up carried him over the field and towards the looming horizon. \"Hey! What are you doing?\" Richard shouted. The great bird, a huge eagle with enormous brown wings, just cawed loudly, the sound carrying out over the field and into the distance. Richard was greatly terrified of this creature, but he simultaneously felt excitement in the fact that he was being carried towards the mysterious crowd of screaming children. Strange, but helpful. At last, Richard looked down again, and the great mass of children drew closer and closer, moving with much more fluidity and swiftness. It was strange. Thousands of children were rushing through the rye field, screaming and crying out as they approached the edge of a great cliff. A cliff? Richard yelped loudly again when he noticed the children coming towards the edge, where, all alone, a teenage boy about the same age as Richard stood, his arms spread out wide amidst the tall, bending strands of rye. He made no audible sound, which surprised Richard when the boy was trying to stop all those children from falling over the cliff singlehandedly. Reacting quickly, Richard jerked his hands violently in the eagle's talons, finally managing to free one of them in time to punch the eagle's belly. With an angry caw, the eagle dropped Richard's hands, and instantly his heart forged into his throat. He was falling! Flinging his hand in front of him, he shouted out, \" The Princess and the Pea, lots of featherbeds!\" And as quickly as he had moved his hand, a pile of snow-white clean featherbeds popped up one by one, reaching Richard until they had multiplied enough to catch him in the sky! He blew the air from his lungs when he landed and his hands hurt from the eagle's talons, but he was unharmed. Richard looked down from his place on the featherbeds, amazed, as the children finally started to tumble over the edge of the cliff, the teenage boy failing endlessly in trying to catch them in the rye field. \"The catcher…in the rye,\" Richard breathed, never taking his hypnotized gaze off of the boy, who was silent in his impossible task while the children cried out in their little voices as they fell over the cliff. Richard was so caught up in watching this strange sight, that he barely noticed the slight tipping of the mattresses. He watched though, as the mattresses tipped closer and closer to the waves of children. \"Whoa!\" Richard cried out again as the mattresses fell forward onto the masses below him, whirling himself around to keep from making nasty contact with the ground, forgetting to think of something to break his fall again! The air rushed past him as he fell, hearing the strangled yelps of the children as the giant pile of mattresses fell on top of them. But suddenly, that didn't matter to Richard, as he was falling…again, this time to the ground miles below him. On the other hand, Richard attempted at one last ditch effort to save himself. He opened his mouth and tossed his open palm to the air before him…[Chapter 6] Chapter 6 Opening its large, mysterious eyes, the cat stood up from its sleepy position and turned its gaze to Chloe next to it. Her many locks of strawberry hair were scattered around the ground near her, her chest gently rising and falling with steady breathing. \"Good time to rise and shine,\" the cat said gently, pawing at Chloe's shoulder. \"That is, if not much sun around here counts as shine,\" it muttered to itself. With a groggy hum, Chloe stirred, rolling over onto her stomach to bring herself to her feet. She rolled onto her cloak, catching it on the dirty ground as she finally rose from her slumber. \"What? What is it?\" she wanted to know, rubbing her eyes. \"You may be like royalty to the Pagemaster,\" the cat stated, \"but that doesn't mean you can't get early wake-up calls like every other normal person.\" \"I know how that feels,\" Chloe muttered, remembering the day they left on their journey through the rotunda. The cat shook its head, chuckling briefly. \"If you want to get to your friends fast enough, you'll have to make sacrifices to do so,\" it said, puffing out its chest. \"Oh, I will,\" Chloe said, starting to follow the cat. \"What I won't make sacrifices for, is when you're being sarcastic with me. You're a good cat, but you can have a big mouth.\" She paused to imagine some breakfast into her open hand, which she gradually started to munch on. \"That's what they all say,\" the cat said. \"I am a cat after all, and have far superior senses than most other creatures- humans in particular. And believe me it has done people good to listen to me.\" Chloe sneered playfully at the cat. \"Oh. All right. If you just happen to sense everything so well, then why don't you tell me the way out so that I can be on my way?\" \"There, I cannot help you,\" said the cat. \"I have senses, but I'm not a map. I'll only know where to tell you to go once I recognize what has come. Shall you be able to live with that for some time?\" Chloe sighed heavily. She didn't see where she would get by arguing endlessly with the cat. It did have a point- they wouldn't know what they would come across until such things actually came. She shivered at the thought of what horrific things were hiding in this section, but what alternative did she have other than the cat's help? \"Yes, I suppose so,\" Chloe answered. \"Very good.\" The cat grinned at her, purring just a little. Chloe grinned, if somewhat sheepishly, back at the cat. Turning her gaze to the little scraps of her breakfast still lying in her hand, she decided that perhaps some breakfast would also do some good for her new guide. In less than a second, she conjured up some catnip for the cat, which she handed down to it as they slowed their walk. The cat was quick to be gracious, and as delicately as its purr, the cat dipped its head into the floating bowl and ate. \"Good kitty,\" Chloe whispered. She looked away from the cat then, and into the woods in front of her. \"That's strange.\" \"What is it now?\" asked the cat. \"That.\" Chloe pointed ahead into the woods. The trees and surrounding fog had been dark grey before. But now they were starting to merge together in a deep, ominous blackness. \"What's…in there?\" Chloe had been hesitant to ask, and now she was regretting asking. \" I cannot say what sort of trap we're walking into,\" the cat answered, a little snidely. \"But the chances of there being monsters or rats in there are…high, to say the least.\" \"Well, I don't see any other direction worth going besides forward, so…\" Chloe looked at her hand, and with a blink of her eyes, a tall candlestick materialized in her clenched fingers. A little flame glowed gently, but grew bigger under Chloe's mental influence. \"I'm going to take a look.\" The cat shrugged and said, \"Of course, if you will, then I suppose I'll go with you.\" \"You will?\" Chloe said, stepping into the darkness. \"Stepping in there doesn't call for naivety,\" the cat told her, \"but I am your companion, aren't I? It wouldn't be prudent to leave you when you could be eaten alive by who knows what in there .\" \"No. No it wouldn't,\" Chloe muttered as she stuck her candle further into the unknown. It created a hazy glow in the blackness, but it wasn't the most pleasant thing for her to look at. For some inexplicable reason, it brought about memories of the fire she had seen in Dracula's eyes, and she nearly shut her eyes and tripped on her feet at the mere suggestion of it. Trying to breathe evenly, Chloe looked behind her shoulder, to ensure that they hadn't walked too far; the darkness actually seemed to be swallowing everything, moving about like ink does when spilled. The grey world behind them was nothing but a tiny circle, becoming smaller, and smaller still. \"Do you think…maybe, we walked too far?\" Chloe had barely gotten the words out when she lurched forward and her body felt for a split second like it was freefalling through space. Her heartbeat nearly sliced through her as she finally grappled for something in the pitch darkness. A loud meow cut through the stillness, and Chloe followed the sound to right at her nose. Something dry and soft nuzzled her face, and although Chloe's heart raced manically, she felt some peace in recognizing what was near her. \"I don't like rats at the best of times,\" the cat said, pawing at Chloe's cheek gently, \"but I smell them leaving quickly. Something's happening.\" Chloe's fingers held the ground so hard that her muscles stung, but through all the manic thoughts whirling through her frightened mind, she heard the gentle dripping of water in the pit below her. And then, with a shocking swiftness, the space around Chloe and the cat lit up like a flip of a switch, and the air instantly turned boiling hot. Her stomach churning, Chloe noticed that the walls that now surrounded her and the cat were blazing gently, radiating dangerous heat. Steam rose everywhere, and the cat spread apart its paws in fear. And, why did it look like the walls were coming closer and closer to them? The minute Chloe recognized what was happening, she pulled together her strength to hoist herself from the pit. With a lunge downward, she grabbed the cat and, using one hand, pointed down into the pit. Using all her imaginative might, Chloe's hand grew icy cold as a strong current of water poured out of thin air from her palm. Gradually, Chloe made the rushing water become stronger until she could feel the power of the water racing all throughout her. It plunged down into the pit, splashing into oblivion, but Chloe was determined to fill it before the fiery walls could touch her. The cat shivered in her arm, burying its head into her side. \"No. No indeed, you aren't saying we are going in there!\" it protested. \"How else are we going to get out of here?\" Chloe asked, pushing more power into the coursing water. \"We're not in the rotunda, so I can't imagine us out!\" \"Don't look at me! The water!\" the cat shouted, looking desperately at the water pouring into the pit. Chloe shook her head, making a swift decision in the meantime as she stole a glance at the walls closing in. She gently put the cat back on the ground, and, using both hands now, doubled the power of the water. At this point, it was gushing in like a real waterfall, and was finally starting to appear out of the darkness. But that wasn't enough. The walls were almost five feet from them. \"Come on, hurry!\" Chloe was screaming inside, with the heat and the tension of their situation. Three feet… \"Let's go!\" Chloe swept her arms downward and once more took the cat in her arms, feeling the heat touch her arm as she leapt down into the water, still sitting in the darkness of the pit. Bubbles fizzed madly around Chloe, as her arms released the tension and started to grapple once again for something to bring her to the surface. She kicked desperately, squeezing her lips together to keep her precious breath from escaping, but the top of her head finally managed to break the surface. Chloe yanked herself above the water, breathing fast as she came to complete darkness again. Suddenly the water seemed to take up the space of an ocean, and Chloe's heart could have burned her chest open it was beating that fast. The space was cold and empty, and the cat was nowhere to be found. The cat! Pushing through the water, Chloe opened her mouth to scream, which echoed all around her, only increasing her fear. She was terribly frightened, and so flustered, that she couldn't think straight. They were a jumble of desires to escape what she had created and to find the cat, but she couldn't think well enough to do them both at once. Through excessive willpower, she finally managed to conjure some candles around the rim of the pit, and to think of a way in which she would move forward, instead of backward. She wasn't going back to the forest- back where she started. Looking at her surroundings, an idea of escape soon came to Chloe. She gave one last grim look at the space around her before she dove back under the water. Groping around, she made her way to the side of the pit, where she placed her hands against the earthy walls. Palms flat against it, she willed for the earth to give way to a tunnel, and gradually, the earth withered away beneath her palms, crumbling into the water to form a huge, long passage before her. Chloe swam to the tunnel, pulling herself inside quickly. She was barely inside however, when something heavy and dangerous fell into the water behind her. Scrambling inside the tunnel, she made the entrance start to close up with her mind, barely catching a glimpse of the huge metal object that sliced through the water. She saw it glow, glinting in the candlelight as it fell down. It looked rather sharp, like some kind of axe. \"Hm. Good thing I wasn't a prisoner of that pendulum,\" Chloe said to herself as she mentally drained the rest of the water from the tunnel. And now to just keep going forward, she thought. I just hope the cat made it out all right, and will go somewhere safe- if there even is a safe place in this section. With that thought in mind, Chloe kept going down the tunnel, an imagined candle floating right next to her with her mind's help. It lit her way through all her flustered thoughts, and her eagerness to soon come to the end of the tunnel. Chloe had become so completely lost in her mind that she was caught off guard when her forehead banged against the end of the earthly wall. With a deep breath she pushed against the wall, gradually moving to shove with her whole body. It was enough for large clumps of earth to fall into her already messy hair, but the wall finally gave way. Grinning widely, she moved to crawl out, but her hand slipped and she tumbled from the opening and into something cold and wet- much like the dark water in the pit. Except this time, it was accompanied by a sound- a voice- so rich in a thick accent that there was no mistaking who he was. \"Lady Chloe. It's a joy seeing you in my domain once more…\"[Chapter 7] Chapter 7 Something hurt in Richard's head, but it was definitely not from an ordinary headache. Especially when he had fallen at least three football fields' worth distance down a rocky cliff. \"Ow,\" he muttered as he picked himself up. Like he always used to, he felt his head for any injuries. There was nothing. \"How can that be? I fell nearly four hundred feet! How in the heck can I still be alive ?\" For several minutes, Richard sat on the ground, sweeping his hair back to help clear his mind from the fall. He understood that anything was still possible in this world, but he hadn't expected to be saved because of it. It was amazing; anyone who fell that far a distance would have been killed instantly. But then again, maybe Richard was an exception. Was the fact that he was a Proverb made him immune to life-threatening danger? A possibility, he decided, but still not too likely. With a final shake of his head, Richard planted his feet and hoisted himself from the ground. There was no time to waste, even when his head felt like it could crack open. Sweeping the dirt from the seat of his pants, Richard made a move forward, but he noticed something strange. Before him, the land stretched out into a vast stretch of lush green grass with flowers poking out in places. A sand-colored dusty path ran like a ribbon through the green, crossing into a stony bridge over a babbling brook. Trees speckled the path, waving gently in a breeze. The sky was absolutely clear, without any clouds at all. All that touched the sky were some huge snow-capped mountains in the far distance. Richard was captivated by the beauty of the land, but was snapped out of his reverie when he heard a gentle click-clack ing and the rumbling of wheels. He jumped slightly when he watched a little red coach being pulled by six white horses go by on the path. The coach rocked from one side to the other, leaving clouds of dust in its wake while it sped away to the horizon. Except, could dust sparkle like diamonds? That's how it looked to Richard as he noticed the floating dirt twinkle, like glitter had been mixed with the path. It looked almost like magic. \"Can this be…?\" Richard wondered aloud, turning his eyes in a circle to view once more the amazing land. He stopped short however, when he caught sight of a giant something flying high above. There was a great sweeping sound as its wings whooshed through the air, its long, scaly tail sweeping the sky behind it. Richard's heart raced for a second when he recognized the great creature. He stepped back a bit, suddenly remembering the red scaly body and the huge green wings. And when the winged beast turned its head to search the ground below it, its monstrous red eyes found Richard. \"Whoa!\" The familiarity of the dragon, and the dangerous way its eyes bore on him, shocked Richard so that he jumped back the step he had taken. He even stumbled back an extra step when his foot met a sharp rock, tumbling to the ground at last. But what he saw now was what really caught him off guard. The green grass, the path, the sparkling dust, the dragon- they were all gone! It was all replaced with a large dusty prairie, under a cloud-speckled sky with some buffalo roaming around between the tumbleweeds. Richard did a double take, even rubbing his eyes to maybe correct what he saw. And even when he also wiped his glasses clean on his shirt, the prairie and buffalo were still there. \"What the…?\" he said, standing back up to further inspect what was at hand here. Once again, he panned the entire view with his eyes and soon decided to just step forward again to tread on through the prairie- if he really was going crazy with all this. Then, when he walked a few steps into the grass, he felt a rush of air at his face, and when he did another double take on the surroundings, his heart took a leap. The lush field and the snowy mountains were back in full view, everything the same as if he had never left it. Richard shook his head, still not believing what he was seeing happen. Out of curiosity- about this mysterious event, and his sanity- he stepped backwards, watching as, sure enough, the green field melted into the dull yellow of prairie grass. \"Wow,\" Richard breathed. If this was what he thought it was, this would call for celebration- a big one. Gingerly, he reached out a hand and instantly felt the gentle rush of air that seemed to separate the two sides of the section. With a deep breath, Richard stepped through the air, which brushed briefly at his hair, and left the other side behind. Glancing behind him, Richard saw that the cliff was transformed into another snow-capped mountain, surrounded by the fertile grass and the beautiful book-bearing flowers. Richard walked away from the mountain and towards the path, suddenly feeling an overwhelming sense of pride come into him. The sparkling coach and the dragon were both enough to prove to him that he wasn't in the rotunda anymore. He knew just when he had crossed the border of one of the sections, and Richard grinned all the way up to his eyes. He was one step closer to finding Chloe again, and that thought alone filled him up with a golden light- much similar to the pretty light he had seen in the sparkling dust on the road. And he didn't want to lose that light just yet. He still needed it for the journey he would make across the fantasy section, to find Chloe in one piece and then get back to the rotunda as quickly as they could. \"Wherever you are,\" he said determinedly, \"I'm not going to stop until you're with me! I won't be afraid…\"[Chapter 8] Chapter 8 \"What are you doing?\" \"Silence, if you please,\" Dracula purred at Chloe, fixing her with a subtle frown. His lips were pushed together in a fixed, cruel line, with the tiniest hint of the deadly fire blazing in his eyes. Chloe immediately stiffened when he looked at her that way. For now, Chloe had to chomp on her tongue to refrain from screaming more questions at her captor. She still couldn't believe this! She thought she had gone several miles from the castle, and how in the world had he gotten past the garlic vapor? She thought for sure she'd secured him inside forever, but…just how had he done it? \"I think you'll find it more fitting to stay with me in my beautiful home for some time,\" Dracula said to her. \"It shall be much safer than wandering on your own where the wolves can sup on you.\" Chloe had a much viler comeback to the Count's request, but she quickly switched gears. \"Well, I was doing just fine without your hospitality,\" she said, holding the false hope that she would convince the dangerous Count otherwise. \"Yes, I suppose you can say so as you were almost the supper of the women that live below my house,\" Dracula sneered. \"They are not to touch you any longer, my lady. I have dealt with them.\" \"I don't care about your vampire brides,\" Chloe snapped. \"Temper, temper,\" the Count said softly. \"It is not polite to speak to your host in that manner. If you should like it, I think the tower would be the best place for you to stay.\" \"The tower?\" Chloe said, looking cocky-eyed at the Count. \"Like 'Rapunzel'?\" \"In my humble opinion, she was much more fit to wait for her true love in a cellar with the rats. Beautiful women such as yourself deserve to be where I can see you. Always.\" \"All right well, why not just keep me down in the castle?\" Chloe asked, careful to not provoke such an idea in Dracula's mind. \"If you really want to see me all the time, it might just work better.\" Dracula looked back at Chloe, grinning seductively at her. \"Solitude shall be good for a fiery woman like you. You need some time to consider whose side of the battle you should like to be part of.\" Chloe didn't like the sound of this, and the Count's sly smile only made her heart twirl in helpless circles faster as they finally came upon the bleak estate of Count Dracula. A shiver tore down through Chloe's body. She had seen this place once before and if that had been terrifying, this was like meeting death face-to-face. She had barely escaped Dracula once before, but this would be even more difficult, because this time he was trapping her in a tower- just like the typical damsel-in-distress. It was not only frightening, but it was slightly demeaning to her. Dracula then brought Chloe to the far side of the estate, where there stood a tall black tower. It was wrapped up in intertwining vines of ivy, reaching all the way to the top of the roof. Shingles were coming loose on the roof, but were trapped in their places by the ivy. The stones that made up the structure were dark with time, about to collapse to the ground. Chloe took note of the ancient-looking part of the castle, and she noticed something strange. \"But, how are you going to get me up there? There are no stairs or anything,\" she noted. The Count didn't say anything. Instead, he took Chloe's hand tighter and flung her onto his back. She yelped, her hair flying into her face as the vampire threw her behind him. The next thing she knew, she and the Count were rising above the ground slowly. She opened her eyes, and with a gasp, she saw that Dracula was climbing up the tower, his talon-like nails clutching at the spaces between the stones just like a climbing lizard. \"Whoa!\" she cried, surprised. She cried out again when suddenly, she was flung from Dracula's back and onto a solid wood floor. It crumbled slightly when she hit it, but it luckily remained intact. \"I bid you welcome, Lady Chloe, to your new home,\" the Count said, gesturing cordially around the tower room, with his other hand holding onto the windowsill. \"Good night now.\" And with that, he ducked away from the sill and climbed back down before Chloe could even get to her feet and race there after him. \"Whoa, wait!\" Chloe shouted down at him. \"Where are you going?\" There was no answer. The Count was already inside the castle. Defeated, Chloe turned around to look at the room she was just dumped in. It was bare as a tomb, and just as dark. Chloe imagined a lit candle on a table next to her, and she finally got a somewhat-clear view of the room. The walls were made of stone, which was just as dark and old as the ones that made up the tower itself. The floor was threatening to crumble around her, so she didn't dare move from her spot. \"It's too bad this place isn't like Rapunzel's tower,\" she said, \"otherwise it would look so much nicer.\" Chloe sucked in a breath. That was it. The power of her imagination was limitless, and so were the things she could do for this room. Quickly, she cleared her throat, and breathed deeply to cleanse her mind of any stray thoughts. To take on this challenge, she would need her best creative mind. \"He can't quite see me all the time if there's a curtain in the window. It's almost too easy,\" she said with a laugh. And then, a set of thick white drapes appeared over the window, fluttering gently in the foul wind from outside. Chloe clapped her hands together and turned to the rest of the room. Pointing to the space next to the window, she imagined a huge king-size bed with the fluffiest comforts she could think of. It would have a blue comforter and pure white pillows, with a gilded headboard and a tulle canopy like what she had when she was a little girl. And then there it was, with everything she had thought of. She quickly accompanied it with the candle and the bedside table, positioning it just right to be homey enough. So that was one corner done enough, but the rest of the room would take some time. Chloe cleared her throat yet again and pointed to the next empty space of the tower.[Chapter 9] Chapter 9 Since crossing the border between the rotunda and the fantasy section, Richard was in a much more content state of mind. He was so sure that he was on the right track that he was a lot more motivated to keep moving. Excitement was becoming abundant inside him, and as each minute passed, Richard could wait even less to find Chloe. There were times when he had to control himself to not start sprinting down the path he still followed. Not to mention the also plentiful beauty of the fantasy section itself. The sky was so brightly blue, that everything around Richard got a natural glow, radiating joyfulness. There were live flowers, but instead of snapping at Richard like they did in the rotunda, they grinned up at him, even laughing sweetly. In between the clumps of those flowers, sweet little fairies of all colors flitted around like butterflies, giggling and singing amongst each other. They left comet-trails of fairy dust behind them, some of it sticking to Richard's clothes as he walked the path, but he didn't quite mind it. The fairies were simple reminders that he was coming closer to completing his mission, and besides, they were really kind little things. Several of them bowed or curtsied to Richard, personally welcoming him into their world. One fairy in particular, a pretty one wearing a pink dress with several blossoms tied around her red-haired head, perched on Richard's shoulder. Her voice was high and musical as she said, \"Soft, what man art thou? Dost thou not remember my name?\" Richard gasped quickly when he heard the voice, but he recognized her manner of speaking to him. \"Peaseblossom?\" he asked, surprised to see his old fairy acquaintance. \"Wow, I didn't see you. What are you doing here?\" \"Paying a visit to some friends of olden years, and,\" the fairy replied. \"But I never once pondered seeing thee here. Thy face brings to life pleasant memories from not too long of yesterday. Please, do tell me- how art thou?\" \"I'm looking for Chloe,\" Richard answered her solemnly. \"She was kidnapped by some evil wizards. I don't know who- what - they are, but I think that since they are wizards, I should be able to find them in this section.\" \"Wicked wizards?\" Peaseblossom said nervously. \"What features lay upon their faces? And their magic- what of that?\" \"They used red-colored magic,\" Richard said. \"That's all I can remember.\" \"Sounds quite the same as the foul creatures our minds' eyes saw not too long ago,\" Peaseblossom noted, her wings quivering. \"I believe it was said to stay a thousand miles' distance from them. Did you not heed our advice?\" \" We didn't go to them ,\" Richard clarified. \"They came to us. They ambushed us, and then they took Chloe with them.\" \"Kidnapped?\" the little fairy yelped. \"Oh, gods, I pray to you, good lord. Tell me it is not so.\" \"I won't lie to you. It's true. Chloe's been taken somewhere in this section, and I'm trying to find her before something happens to her.\" Peaseblossom grimaced, her wings wilting like a sad dog's ears. \"What foul villains they are to perform such foul deeds. But the most vital question of this time is, which direction did they proceed in their kidnapping? Mayhap that should relay some truth to this mystery.\" \"I don't remember, that's the problem,\" Richard said, slumping his shoulders at the fairy's question. \"All I know is that her kidnappers were evil characters with magic powers. I think you know what kinds of things people like that can do to Chloe, even with her powers going against them.\" \"Please, no necessity for anger, my friend. I've known devils in my years, and I believe thee in the knowledge that such characters are not to be left in solitude for long. They must be found, or it shall be ill times for your lady.\" Suddenly, remembering how Peaseblossom and the other fairies had seen the wizards lurking in the woods, he wondered if maybe Peaseblossom could do the same for him. It shouldn't be very far, he reasoned. If Chloe was in this section, then surely a fairy could see how far he would have to go to reach her. \"Peaseblossom,\" Richard addressed her, \"how did you see the wizards in the woods? Did you have a vision of them or something like that, or did you actually watch them take over the forest in front of you?\" \"Easily said, my lord,\" she answered. \"Fairies such as myself have the keen ability to span miles upon miles of distance in the eyes of our minds. However, it is a great misfortune that they are not active at all hours. It is a thing that works only with the power of the section in which we reside at a current time. Should something occur, it either comes to fairies in place nearby, or not never at all.\" \"You mean, you can only see something happen when it's a bad thing?\" Richard said, already starting to feel defeated. \"An ungodly thing, I know of that,\" Peaseblossom agreed. \"It is naught but a gift given to us by our almighty king and queen, Oberon and Titania. If you should like me to perform such a tiring service to you- locating your beloved lady Chloe- it is out of the control of my little hands. Thou shall have to take it up with Oberon himself.\" The deflated balloon in Richard's chest suddenly inflated once again. So maybe there was some hope in getting the help he needed now. \"Then, can you take me to him?\" he asked. Peaseblossom's smile faded when he asked the question. She fluttered her wings briefly, as if nervous. \"Alas, that is but another mountain in your path, I am sorry to state. Oberon and his queen are in the most awful affairs of things. You see, Titania has taken possession of a child of a dear friend of hers, and Oberon should like to transform said child into yet another fairy servant in his army. The sky may look blue in this place now, but should you step into the territory of the fey, the sky shall promise foul events to unfold. In particular, with the presence of a human from the otherworld.\" Richard shook his head in defiance. \"But, Peaseblossom, you don't understand it. I have to find Chloe soon before things get even more out of hand. There's going to be a war- a huge one- and if Chloe is out there unprotected, there'll be heck to pay if something happens to her because of me. I'm the Proverb of the Books! I'm supposed to be there as her guardian!\" Peaseblossom instantly fluttered off of Richard's shoulder at his words. Her wings fluttered madly as she flung herself to her knees in the air. Her long hair fell over her face, almost causing her flower tiara to fall off her head. \"Oh, forgive me! Please accept my apology for not recognizing thee as thou title is.\" The poor fairy was practically crying as she said her words. \"Please don't do that,\" Richard said, gently using his index finger to pull Peaseblossom from her desperate position. \"All I'm asking is that, if the fairy kingdom isn't too far away from here, you can take me there to talk to Oberon, or even Titania.\" The little pink fairy fluttered beside Richard, one tiny glowing hand resting on his shoulder sweetly. \"Suddenly, I see that should he recognize he is speaking to a Proverb, there is a likely chance things shall turn in your favor!\" \"Then you'll take me there?\" Richard said, putting on his best hopeful face. \"In a day's walk, at the very most of time, it shall stand before your hopeful eyes,\" Peaseblossom replied. \"And please, do allow for me to bring to thee whatever accommodations it takes to make thy journey pleasant.\" \"That'd be nice,\" Richard said, \"but you don't have to do it. Knowing where Chloe is would be enough for me.\" \"Onward to the fairy kingdom, good comrade,\" Peaseblossom declared, doing a happy swirl around Richard's head and shoulders, and then twirling like a ballerina into the air, with a huge stream of magic sparkles falling from her wings. \"And may the gods shine down on thy courageous quest, and thy fair lady!\"[Chapter 10] Chapter 10 Since using all of her creative juices on transforming the grim tower into a homey nook, it was now a magical variation on her old room back home, with a great big bed, a beautiful vanity and shelves of books. Chloe had even imagined some copies of her old toys, making the room look just the place to be when she felt blue. The bed rose sweetly around her as she sunk into the mattress. The pillows and the tulle canopy enveloped her in such comfort, Chloe sincerely believed that she was back home, with her mother stewing spaghetti- Chloe's favorite- in the kitchen, and her father alphabetizing, for the hundredth time that month, the books in their house. She grinned, imagining things being in such a content state, that she couldn't bring herself to think of the tower still around her. It was as though heaven itself came down just to see her for a moment; that was how comfortable she felt lying in her cloudy bed. Chloe unexpectedly shivered though, when the curtains of the window fluttered open and a cold breeze zipped through the tulle and across the bed. She attempted to close the curtains with her mind, but the breeze was too strong for that tactic. From the sound of it however, it seemed like something just as powerful was brewing outside. Rising from the marshmallow softness, Chloe crossed to the window and poked her head out at the surrounding air circling the tower. There was certainly no storm coming, but the air somehow felt thinner, less dank. Wispy clouds crossed the face of the full moon overhead, a stream of autumn leaves accompanying them noisily. In sticking herself out in the weather, Chloe's skin rose in goose bumps. Her limbs shook with the unusual cold, and she ducked back in the window, tying the curtains together with some ribbon. She'd hoped maybe that would make it better, but the dank room was now just as freezing as the outside world had been. She knew just what to do. Opening up her mind, Chloe imagined a fire brewing in the fireplace across the room from her bed. It glowed gently against the stone mantle, sweetly inviting and instantly filling the entire room with warmth. And still, more ideas popped through Chloe's mind, as she moved her focus to the empty space before the fireplace. With a flex of her brain, a soft, round rug materialized, weighted to the floor by an enormous and ornate bathtub already filled with steamy water. Stepping in front of the fireplace, she slipped out of her dress- the one she had worn every day since the journey began- and stuck her toes, then her feet, into the tub. She relaxed her muscles under the soothing spell of the warm water, all while a pretty changing screen enveloped her, the tub and the fireplace in a corner. It was covered in beautiful designs of flowers and trees, much like what the battlefield in the rotunda had looked like. While slightly translucent, it still cut off most of the full moon's powerful light going through the thin curtains, creating an even softer glow from the flames. To top it off, Chloe even tried to make some flowers bloom around her for a relaxing smell, but it was still impossible for her to create life out of thin air. That was the only disappointment to this new, beautiful atmosphere while she sunk her whole body into the water, which seemed to almost pungently caress her while she did so. Her head was barely touching the rippling surface when she heard a soft sound moving against the glass screen. A low whistle that seemed to radiate a small draft, even through the glass, wavered through the air. Chloe felt the draft against her cheeks, and quickly dipped her head below the water when she heard another sound come from the mysteriousness just inches away from her. \"You are still awake, like the nightly bat.\" Chloe couldn't hear the voice, but the hot water cut her off from the world altogether. She felt safe from the strange draft inside the thick heat, the bubbles coming from her mouth tickling her nose. It was hard not to explode to the surface with the feeling, but something kept her weighted to the bottom of the tub. Finally, Chloe opened her eyes to little slits, watching briefly while the bubbles floated upward, distorting a shadow-like figure against the glow of the fire. It was momentarily breathtaking to her, but her air couldn't hold. She broke her head through the surface, gasping for another breath while she wiped her eyes. \"Evening, lady.\" Chloe's eyes snapped open and she lurched from the water, screaming as she fell from the tub and scrambled through an opening in the changing screen to escape the stranger. She moved around quite aimlessly, her mind imagining half a million things at once to try and cover herself up. She managed to conjure some strips of cloth that slowly came together on her body to make do as clothing, but they barely held onto her as something caught her by surprise once more. \"Do not move away from me,\" the voice said, gently commanding but soothingly arousing. \"Come here.\" Chloe stood stiffly again, her eyes becoming hazy before her as she turned on her heel, moving mechanically towards the alluring voice. Her dripping hair left a wet trail on the floor, plopping softly with the patter of her bare feet. She turned the corner, into the interior of the glass screen, where sure enough, there stood the Count in all his wicked, devilish glory. That perpetual fixed glare was still there, cracking into a tiny grin as his prey turned in his direction. He had never, in all the centuries he so rarely preyed upon lovely women, felt his dead heart come so much alive. A woman like that had blood that churned quickly enough through her veins that it was an angelic voice to him. And she was so young. A creature who looked that young would secure so many victims for him that it seemed a crime to not take her for his helper. Her powers would slowly drain, and the second Proverb would be gone. One last Proverb alone could never defeat him, especially the helpless blonde one who could bring books to life. Imagination would be no more with her as his. \"You're so exceptionally beautiful, dear child,\" Dracula purred. \"Your companionship with me would be so gratefully accepted.\" Chloe still didn't speak. Her eyes looked almost dead under the vampire's influence, though they still had a bit of a live sparkle to them. Dracula reached out to Chloe, and took her hand, still clammy from the spell. It sent a rush through the Count to have such a warm presence against his dead skin; he could almost feel the blood coursing beneath her pale skin, pumping gently as one feels water droplets on their cheek. The fangs picked at his lips, as though trembling in anticipation of just one drink. Chloe involuntarily licked her lips. Her eyes were still glazed over, but she could see the Count a lot more clearly now. He was still an old man, with the long mustache and graying hair, but he had suddenly become god-like to her. She couldn't place why exactly; vampires had that kind of power to them that she always imagined, but never dreamed existed. The Count slowly grinned at her, and Chloe's green eyes flicked to the two sharp, gleaming fangs just protruding over the lower lip, seeming to draw blood from them. Blood? Chloe blinked twice at seeing the two canines, seeming to flex in his gums like muscles. They were beautiful and gleaming white, but they held a terrifying presence that seemed to snap inside her. Finally, with a jolt in her stomach, the horrifying image in her imagination pulled her back to reality. She shuddered, backing away from the Count in sheer horror at what almost happened. But she backed so far away that she stumbled over the rim of the bathtub and plummeted back into the hot water with a splash! The Count advanced upon Chloe, while the spilled water ran in a puddle towards the fireplace, making a loud sizzling noise in the ashes that was only a whisper compared to Chloe's scream. \"You must not fear me,\" Dracula said, reaching into towards Chloe's wet arm sticking out over the rim of the tub. Chloe yanked herself from the water, swiftly causing a long bathrobe to appear over her soaked body. \"If you would just get out of here,\" she said, a growl sneaking up through her words, \"then that would be even more wonderful than one of your little bloodbaths.\" \"I come, only out of desire to ask you one question,\" he said, his dark eyes boring into Chloe. \"Whose side of this battle shall you go towards? One of them shall cost you your very life, and the other shall save you.\" Chloe's body was rigid with her anger. She didn't like how the Count was trying to toy with her, much less that he had the nerve to ask her that question when he might as well know the answer. He couldn't ask her that question right after he had trapped her, and didn't attempt to convince her in the slightest that joining the villains was the right thing. Which it most certainly wasn't! \"What makes you think I'll go to your side?\" she asked, clenching her fingers into fists. \"When, clearly, you haven't tried to prove to me what will make joining you the right thing to do.\" \"It is easy business,\" Dracula said. \"You shall see one day that our tactics of conquering our enemies are of much greater aptitude than your friends. They bumble aimlessly without thought wherever they sneak. With us, your power could grow to the very horizon, and further. We shall do wonderful things for you, when you are in my hand.\" He made a move closer to her. \"With you as my companion, nothing will be impossible to your gift.\" Chloe swiftly took her arm out of the Count's reach. \"My gift has already reached the horizon,\" she said defiantly. \"It did just that weeks before you and your stupid friends showed up and took me here. Besides, if you want to ask me, I'll tell you that my power is trained for good magic. I'm a Proverb. It's what all three of them are supposed to be, because they are linked to all the Pages, and the Pagemaster!\" Dracula grinned that grin again. \"You delude yourself to the ways of the good side of our world. It has always been known that the wicked have the better minds and creative endeavor that your kind lacks so.\" This was getting annoying. Chloe stepped closer to the Count daringly, intentionally boring her eyes into his in a mockery of his own stare. \"Get out of here right now,\" she growled. \"I do good magic, but I might just do perhaps the one evil thing I'll ever do to you .\" \"I shall like to see you do so, my sweet lady.\" Her limbs quivered with the power threatening to surge from her, but she was able to keep it at bay while she closed in further on the Count. Keeping a straight face, she pushed him out from behind the changing screen, and finally across the floor to the curtained window. It felt like perhaps she was having some control on the vicious vampire, because despite that the power was threatening to explode from her hands, some of it leaked through her mind and out through her eyes. It was a great surge of powerful energy, and although Chloe was exercising good control on what leaked from her, she couldn't hold it for too much longer. It was moderately easy to control this, but just looking at the Count made Chloe's heart burn with intense hatred for him. He was the reason she was separated from Richard, Sir Hugo and Jip, instead of continuing the way things were supposed to. He'd trapped her up here, and only succeeded in aggravating her further, rather than convincing her to become a sick vampire companion to an even more revolting monster. Yes. Dracula was a monster, and she knew it as well as she knew her own name. Better than she knew her own name! \"Lady…\" That did it. Chloe's fists came loose, and so did her control over the magic building inside her arms. She lunged forth at her enemy, her arms swinging before her, the both of them seeming to illuminate in all different colors. The colors flashed like lightning, sparking like bolts and streaking across all areas of her vision. It was startlingly astounding, and at the same time it was surreally beautiful. She hardly took it all in though, because the power ripping through her skin was enough to knock even her off her feet. This was something she had never done before. Perhaps she hadn't even seen the horizon after all. Chloe was indeed knocked off balance by her blast of magic, but the most powerful blow was handed to the Count. The magnitude of this magic was a great surprise, and definitely something beyond which he could easily control, like rats and wolves. No, this was beyond even the power of those in deities living above and below. And even when the Count caught himself on the wall just below the windowsill, his sight was still dazed by what he had taken to his body. First, he had been amazed by the little lady's beauty, and now she was practically an angel by the power she had displayed. It was impressive, and would be even more useful to him now; that was, after he recovered fully from the blow. The vampire crept down the stone wall, illuminated by the full moon's light. There was a soft crinkling in the dead grass when he touched back down again. \"You okay?\" a tiny, meek voice asked the Count from not too far away. Dracula glanced up to see a slightly chunky figure come into view. It was a teenage girl, like the lady in the tower, only she was a little less attractive. Particularly when a thick, sticky layer of blood covered her face, body, and the soiled dress she wore. \"I've witnessed a miracle,\" was all Dracula said. \"The girl up in the tower- she possesses a power farther beyond even that of your meek object-affecting ability. Overtaking our enemies may be easier than we ever expected.\" \"I'm not meek,\" the girl said softly. \"I…I've killed hundreds before. If I concentrate well enough, I think I can move all the heroes off the battlefield.\" \"Silence, girl,\" Dracula harshly commanded. \"A warrior maiden must be powerful and beautiful. You appear as though you have been spewed from the depths of the Hellfire.\" The girl shed a little tear, but she kept a straight posture. \"I was supposed to be beautiful. But Momma told me someone would laugh at me.\" \"Worse shall yet be done, child. Particularly if you meddle with our plans to help the lady cross over to our side forever.\" \"What about the other boy?\" the girl wanted to know. \"Won't he come and find her soon?\" \"Not if we dispose of him properly. And I shall see that she does not escape from us.\" \"What if she does?\" \"Then you stay away from her. She must stay alive for all of good to fall!\"[Chapter 11] Chapter 11 It was silent when, for a long while, nothing happened. The occasional howling of a far-off wolf broke the quiet, but to Chloe, all she heard was the raspy sound of breathing. Her shoulders rose and then back down, but the rest of her was still as the stone walls around her. Not even her eyes flicked around in their sockets. What had just happened? Even the tiniest part of Chloe's brain was stumped as to a guess. Of course, she knew it had to be magic of the most powerful kind, but what exactly? It was like fireworks, while not the celebratory Fourth of July kind, had exploded from the very bottom of her. When the magic came out of her, she felt it rushing through her all the way from her toes, through her limbs, along her spine; it even felt like it was pushing through the individual veins in her heart, prickling along like icy water. Even now she could feel the magnificent power trickling away at last, but she still held the lingering excitement and adrenaline. Strangely, now that the lightning and fireworks had finally come out of her, Chloe no longer felt much anger or fear. The dangerous accumulation was almost entirely gone, cleansing her soul of what she felt before. And for the first time, since stepping into the wonderful warm bath, her shoulders relaxed and her stomach stopped swishing madly inside. Every muscle in her body slowly loosened and her terrified thoughts turned to mush, replaced by dreamy images of starlight and gentle darkness. It startled Chloe. She expected to still harbor the same intense anger for Count Dracula and everything he called his own. But now that her emotions felt so empty and dreamily relaxed, it was hard to not feel drawn to the vacant seat under the open window. Her feet barely making a peep on the wood, Chloe stepped slowly to the seat. She drew the curtains gently aside, so that her face could look out at the full moon. Unlike earlier, the sky was clear and the face of the moon was brighter than ever. Even though this was the horror section, Chloe could even spot a few stray stars amidst the darkness. Such an unusually cheery sight brightened her mood, if only very slightly. And besides, the night was aging quickly. Perhaps it was time she forgot this night and got into bed. Oh, yes, bed sounds wonderful, she thought. Chloe sniffed deeply, and then let out a yawn before stretching her arms sleepily away from the windowsill. She was turning away slowly, until something caught her eye among the spires of the castle. Poking her head back out the window, Chloe turned her gaze to a flickering candlelight in another tower near hers, except a couple yards shorter. Squinting her eyes, she noticed a dark figure standing out boldly against the light. It was that of a person, with a slightly chunky middle, with long, straggly hair. When it moved into the light, Chloe noticed the person's skin glint a dark shade of red, almost maroon. Strings of hair covered the eyes, colorless even in the candlelight. Imagining a small pair of binoculars into her hands, Chloe peered closer at whoever was in the tower. She had an idea, but she wasn't too sure until she looked through the lenses. A tiny gasp escaped her lips. \"Carrie White,\" she whispered, recognizing the famous telekinetic character from one of her drawings. Looking around, Chloe observed the surroundings of Carrie's tower. It was dismal in there, with barely any furniture save for a pillow-less bed, and a little vanity by the window. Carrie was looking into the mirror in the vanity, which was broken in four separate pieces, placed back together quite precariously. In the reflection, her face was pink under the dried blood that still covered her. Some of it washed away gradually, while tiny tears fell from her eyes. The eyes were glossy and wet, popping out against the dark maroon of the blood. Carrie leaned closer to the mirror, putting her hands on her cheeks, clearly depressed. She swept her hair from her face, but the colorless strands just fell back into place. With that, Carrie's shoulders shook as more tears came. Chloe couldn't watch this sad scene anymore, but she couldn't take the binoculars away from Carrie. She had always felt a soft spot for this particular character. Although the circumstances of the girl's story were extreme, Chloe had never identified so much with any one character in her life. Every time she re-read the scenes where Carrie was cornered in the shower by the other girls, or when her brutally religious mother shoved her into a creepy closet to pray her sin-filled heart out, she pledged an imaginary friendship to Carrie, although she knew she wouldn't ever meet her. But now, she was only so many feet away from her! Shivers of excitement stuck to Chloe's spine, and she finally took the binoculars from her eyes to stop them. Imagining the tool away, Chloe finally stopped her glancing to and from Carrie. She felt bad enough spying on her, but she was starting to wonder; what was it that had caused Carrie to cry like she was? Perhaps it was just her story working itself out, in which she was crying from another day of torture and bullying from her classmates. But then again, what was she doing actually being inside of Dracula's castle? It wasn't as though he personally invited her in, what with the way she looked and all; and he certainly wasn't the kind of person to do so for just any random girl. Unless of course, she had influenced him with her telekinesis. Not too likely; something was definitely up. \"Carrie!\" Chloe called out without first thinking. Carrie's eyes flicked around shortly before she turned from the mirror and then out the window. Her glazed eyes met Chloe's, and she flinched, immediately turning back to the mirror, shaking her head. Chloe glanced at the surrounding grounds of the castle. When there was no movement anywhere around her, she cupped her hands around her mouth. \"Carrie, look up here! I want to talk to you!\" She didn't answer, only keeping her gaze to the broken mirror. \"Listen to me, will you? Please. I don't want to do anything to you, I promise!\" Carrie hesitated a moment, before she finally turned to Chloe's window. Her eyes were still wet, but she wasn't crying anymore. \"I don't like to be tricked,\" was all she said. \"I'm not tricking you. I just want you to come up here, so I can talk to you for a minute. I mean it!\" \"I'm not supposed to talk to you. He said I couldn't.\" \"'He'? Oh, you mean Dracula.\" Chloe shook her head, silently frustrated with the Count's nerve to control someone like Carrie. \"Well, you want to know what I think of him? I think he's nothing but a monster who's overstayed his welcome on my good side, as well as yours, I believe. He shouldn't be the one in charge of you!\" \"He said not to listen to you either.\" \"For crying out loud, Carrie! You've got to stop listening to people using your fear to control you! They've lied to you over and over again, and you're just going to succumb to everything that someone tells you to do? It's not right!\" \"He'll send me below to the fire if I don't.\" Carrie's voice quivered, and even from the distance they talked back and forth to each other, Chloe heard her whispering something under her breath. She was looking at something hanging over her bed, with her hands clasped together. Suddenly, Chloe felt an even more overwhelming reason to get closer to Carrie. Dracula had now become ten times the vicious thing he was to her before. He had exerted enough control on poor Carrie, who, for sure, felt fear in every corner of herself. She was acting out of pure fright, not loyalty to the Count. Without a second's wait, Chloe then pulled her hand forward with palm extended, and summoned an imaginary ladder that connected the two towers. Swiftly and quietly, she moved down the ladder, dropping down onto the decaying floor of Carrie's tower. Carrie whirled around from the crucifix over her bed when she noticed Chloe. \"No! Go back!\" she cried. \"He'll kill both of us if he comes back!\" \"The heck with Dracula!\" Chloe said firmly, flashing her hand back at her bedroom window, where two flapping doors snapped closed behind the curtains. She glared at the magical ladder, and it vanished completely. Whirling around back to Carrie, Chloe relaxed her expression and put on a gentle, neutral face. \"Okay, Carrie, I know you think it's a good thing to listen to Dracula, but he's only going to kill you in the end like he might do to me when this war ends. You don't want to die, do you? That's why you should get out of here when you can!\" \"I can't go back,\" Carrie whispered. \"Momma is gone. The thing killed her.\" \"Better than staying here with Dracula!\" Chloe said loudly. \"You're not the one he wants, which is why I don't understand why you're here. Can you please tell me?\" Carrie's eyes wandered a little before she shyly turned back to Chloe's imploring gaze. \"He tried…he tried to take me,\" she finally admitted. \"But, I used the thing in my mind to make him go away. And then, he said he wanted me to do something.\" Chloe didn't say anything, only looking at Carrie with question. \"If I stayed with him, to help get rid of the Proverb of the Imagination, named Lady Chloe, then he would let me live here.\" \"And you agreed to him?\" \"I was scared and lost. I didn't know what else I could do.\" Her eyes slowly cast downward at her lap, hidden by her bloody dress. \"I thought maybe I could escape anyone who tried to trick me.\" Carrie's voice was so full of innocent, childlike tearfulness that Chloe's heart instantly went out to her. It was still a long moment, however, before she finally inched closer to Carrie in an attempt to comfort her. \"Listen,\" she said, \"I know absolutely how you feel about those people. I've known a few of them myself back home, and believe me when I say that I never liked being teased either. But then I saw that what set me apart from the rest of them. It's called uniqueness, and it's what makes you and me special.\" \"They did this to me,\" Carrie said, gesturing to her face and dress. \"And Momma said I was a sinner. She could see through me as surely as God can.\" \"You're not a sinner. And you know what? Your classmates were actually way below you. They were stupid enough to not recognize you for the wonderful girl that you are. You, on the other hand, were smart to stand up to your mom when she threatened you. Why don't you do that when that Dracula tells you off again? I know you can do it.\" Carrie's sad frown gradually started to break, the corners of her lips lifting up to her eyes. \"You think I can?\" Chloe winked at Carrie, and that was all that she needed. \"Are…are you my friend?\" Chloe was caught off for a second, but she instantly got blissful warmth inside when Carrie's question crossed her mind. And she answered by grinning sincerely, and putting her arms around Carrie. Carrie was slow to react, but she did the same right after. \"You're a great person, Carrie,\" Chloe added. \"Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.\" Chloe felt Carrie nod her head. Until a red-hot wind shook the room apart…! Chloe and Carrie fell from the bed, rolling to the floor as an explosion of power came from the open window. The air turned slightly red overhead while someone burst through into the room. Dizziness swept through Chloe's mind before she looked up to notice who had come for them. \"How dare you come here!\" Dracula's heavy and angry voice carried through all the grounds, ringing painfully in Chloe's ears. \"You were to stay in the tower where you belong! And as for you\"- he hurled an angry finger at Carrie –\"you were to keep your bloody hands away from her! You perform such a vile task again, and the filthy women down in my dungeons shall take you for their next victim!\" Chloe had had enough of this. \"Don't you dare talk to her like that!\" she screamed at the Count. \"I know what you are, but you don't scare me anymore! And you will not do anything to Carrie either! I won't sit still and let you control us anymore! You do anything more to her, and I swear on my grave, I'll…\" She held her hand high, and a long-bladed Bowie knife materialized. The point was poised in the air like it was a wooden stake, about to strike. The Count, on the other hand, seemed unfazed. \"Carrie.\" He looked at her with an unwavering command in his eyes, the darkness in them igniting with a momentary, but angry, blaze. Chloe turned back to look at Carrie, who flicked her eyes between Chloe and Dracula. With each movement of her eyes, she seemed to become more and more terrified. Fear leaked through her eyes quickly, becoming the tears that streamed down her face. \"No, no, no,\" she whimpered over and over. It was uncertain whether she was talking to herself, or to Dracula. \"Do it now,\" the Count slurred. Carrie was quiet, before she let out a huge scream that echoed tenfold the power of Dracula's entrance, and when Chloe hurled herself around to avoid Carrie's pained expression, she yelped in noticing the satisfied smirk on the Count's dead face. The knife in Chloe's hand vibrated violently, like a squirming, wild animal. The handle slipped a few centimeters across her sweaty fingers, and quickly, Chloe let go of the knife while she leapt from the window of the tower, giving herself the magic ladder once more to bring herself up to her tower, under the frantic influence of her imagination. She tossed herself through the flapped doors, which disintegrated with just one angry thought. The hardwood floor smacked her, but it wasn't quite as much as the blow she felt inside. Carrie wouldn't go through with Chloe after all. Chloe allowed for the thought to clutch her, wallowing shortly in it, while she heard voices down in Carrie's tower. \"That girl shall never come down to you. Understand?\" \"She was nice to me.\" \"She is your sworn enemy! She shall poison your mind with her good magic. Should I ever catch you conversing with the lady Chloe, I will confine you to this tower for as long as I intend to remain on this earth.\" \"But…\" \"Silence! I am capable of giving you to the three brides, if you shall like to.\" \"No.\" \"Then do not speak with the girl! For I believe you would make a poor meal to myself or to them ! A vampire does not take a good scent when they are covered with pig's blood. Vile thing, you would be. But, that would not be any different than it is at this moment.\" Carrie sniffled loudly. \"I'll leave you,\" Dracula concluded, stepping to the window. \"You put thought into using your ability to place my comrades ahead of hers . You are not to converse with her… unless you will do something right, and put your power to her vulnerable mind like she has done yours…\"[Chapter 12] Chapter 12 \"Dost thou wish to stop? Thy face is red as the hair on my head!\" Peaseblossom could not have been more correct. Richard's face, typically so pale, was fevering up. Like in the rotunda, the sun boring down from the perfect sky was very, very hot. And the peasant clothes he had been wearing the past few days were starting to get wrinkly and damp. It was really uncomfortable, particularly on his back, where a huge circle of sweat was soaking through the cloth. His clothes hung from his body in thick, wet drapes, and about now, even the tips of his fingers were coated in a film of perspiration. \"I can handle it,\" he lied. Peaseblossom glanced behind her at the afternoon sun. \"I've never come to an understanding myself why 'tis always so like summer,\" she said. \"Midsummer is unbearable in itself outside the Athenian forest, but this is treacherous. I pray this isn't the work of Oberon and his Titania. Oh, what tender power they hath.\" Richard swallowed hard, remembering what special power the fairy king and queen had. He trusted the likelihood of Oberon helping him locate Chloe, but aside from that, the idea of making the weather move with their emotion was kind of unnerving. He certainly hoped that Oberon wouldn't zap him with lightning if he moved an inch in the wrong direction with his request. Clearly they had as much power as a wizard, but were a hundredfold more sensitive. Peaseblossom laid her penny-sized hand on Richard's shoulder, coming to rest her whole body on it. \"Pay nothing of thy mind Oberon or Titania, my lord,\" she said tenderly. \"They hold such sensitive natures, but they'll do nothing upon the realization of thy identity. A good servant like myself has the capability of keeping them at bay should anything occur.\" \"So you've said,\" Richard said. \"If they're really that bad, I just don't want to upset them. Or at least, not Oberon anyway.\" \"Our fairy king is nothing against what is building in the center of our world. Thou hast looked death in the dead eye, and thou never took a step back. Thy lady would say nothing different than I state now.\" Richard gave the fairy a queer look out of the corner of his eye, but she only grinned reassuringly at him. Chloe would have said the same thing, but with each minute that passed, Richard's confidence in finding himself was slipping away, inch by inch. Peaseblossom sighed, sweeping something invisible from her arms. \"Ah me. This sun is too much. Please, dear gods, let my king and queen settle their quarrel by the next moonrise. And, where in the name of all fairyland is some shelter? A thousand centuries hath never seen such barrenness.\" Richard glanced at his shoulder to look at his fairy friend, but when he turned back to gaze ahead, his nose came in contact with something huge and hard, sending him stumbling to the ground. Peaseblossom yelped squeakily, and fluttered her wings to hover in the air. \"Great gods!\" she said. \"From what other place did this wall materialize?\" Richard stood back up, shaking his head to clear the blow. He rubbed his nose carefully with his hand, wincing. \"That's not just a wall,\" he said to Peaseblossom. He observed the sturdy brick, decorated with vines. It curved sharply on either side, with lamps bolted to it on both sides of a wooden door. \"It's a house,\" he answered. \"What an immense surprise seeing it here,\" Peaseblossom said, flitting around the space. She picked at the vines on the wall, and then up above the wall, where she shortly disappeared from view. \"In sight of the place, it must be huge. Someone in possession of boundless money must make their home here.\" Richard turned his head in both directions, and looked along the wall, all the while backing up to understand how he had missed the house coming. To his surprise, it seemed to be an entire mansion with an old Victorian porch and a picket fence surrounding the backyard area. It was neatly painted and decorated, but what was even more amazing, was that the atmosphere was chilly, and the house was entirely covered in snow. \"I don't know how I didn't see it,\" Richard said, shivering briefly in the sudden cold, \"but we just should go around it and get moving again.\" \"But, soft,\" Peaseblossom said, \"dost thou believe it shall be prudent to cease our journey for a moment and rest? The sun has turned cold, and we should get inside.\" Richard shook his head, half-frustrated and half-pleased about Peaseblossom's proposal. It was vital that they pressed on to the fairy kingdom, but it also was getting quite cold. It shocked Richard greatly, and for a moment, he shook. \"Okay,\" he agreed. \"Let's go see if anyone's home.\" \"Yes, please, make haste,\" Peaseblossom said, following her friend to the door. Stepping up to the door, Richard lifted his hand to knock on the door, doing so three times on the soft wood. Snow fell in drops from the eaves with each knock, plopping gently on the porch. \"Hello?\" a voice called from inside the house. Richard pressed his ear to the door, listening further to the voice. But there came no other answer other than the questioning call. \"Hello, can you let me and my friend in, please?\" Richard asked. \"Who are you?\" the voice called back. It was that of a little girl, small and sweet. \"You probably don't know,\" Richard said, \"but I'm one of the Proverbs. I'm the one that can open books and make them come alive.\" There was quiet on the other side of the door, and for several moments, Richard was quite unsure of what the girl was doing. Maybe she didn't know what a Proverb was. Not every single person knew about the Proverbs, didn't they? Richard's eyes widened slowly as he heard the pitter-patter of shoes on a carpeted floor. He heard something click, and then almost fell completely forward when the door slid open, with a flood of light coming into the grayness. He instantly regained his footing when small hands grabbed his shoulders and helped him back on his feet. \"Are you all right?\" the girl in the doorway wanted to know. \"Oh, yeah, I'm okay,\" Richard said, finally taking note of the girl. She was indeed a small girl, one of about seven or eight years of age. Her hair was a shoulder-length blonde, tied back with a dark headband. She wore a blue knee-length tea dress, covered by a clean white pinafore, outlined gently in red. White stockings covered her little legs, and she had neatly polished black shoes on her feet. It was quiet between the two, before finally, Peaseblossom fluttered out before the girl, who squealed in surprise and covered her mouth with her hand. \"Are you a fairy?\" the girl asked after a second. \"Merely a fairy and naught else, little child,\" Peaseblossom said. \"May I inquire your name?\" \"My name is Alice,\" said the girl. \"Peaseblossom,\" added the fairy sweetly. She flew up to Alice's forehead and gave her a little kiss. Alice smiled, and giggled. \"Now, I implore to thee,\" Peaseblossom began, \"my comrade, Richard, and I have traveled so very many a mile, and we should like to take hospitality in thy home. Shall thee fetch thy mother and ask if we can stay for the evening?\" Alice shrugged. But then she looked up at Richard. \"I suppose so. You said that you are one of the Proverbs. And you do seem very kind and gentle.\" \"I am,\" Richard clarified. \"Well, all right,\" Alice said, opening the door. \"Come in before you catch a cold out here.\" \"Thank you!\" Richard and Peaseblossom said at the same time as they walked inside the door. And while Alice closed it, they glanced at the inside of the glorious house. There were statues and paintings and many, many pieces of expensive, polished furniture in all kinds of colors. It was quite the inviting atmosphere, and after being outside in the cruel weather for so long, it was tempting to Richard to just collapse in one of the cozy-looking chairs without first asking. Alice turned from the door, walking quickly from the lobby to another hallway that led into a parlor. \"Come in here,\" she said to her guests. \"I want you to come and meet my friends.\" Richard and Peaseblossom moved into the parlor, where they noticed Alice sitting on the floor with two kittens. One was black, and the other was white, the two of them tumbling around each other just like little children. Alice giggled watching them, petting them anytime that they stood still. The fairy flew into the fray, sprinkling some of her magic dust onto the kittens. The two of them rolled on the carpet into the sparkling dust, meowing playfully. \"I can't believe it,\" Alice said, looking between the kittens and Peaseblossom. \"I just cannot believe it. A real fairy who can make magic!\" Peaseblossom grinned at Alice, pulling back from the playing kittens. \"Suppose you can make something interesting happen?\" Alice asked curiously. Readjusting her flower tiara, Peaseblossom then put her hands out in front of her and, from her fingertips, some sparkling dust fell gently onto Alice's shoes. They changed color for a blink of an eye, but then they started to squirm around her feet. Alice gasped in surprise as she got to her feet, and slowly, her shoes started to move and dance around the fancy carpet, taking her with them. \"Oh, you're a sweet little fairy!\" Alice exclaimed, joyful as she danced around the room. \"This is wonderful.\" \"It's naught but music to me hearing the laughter of a small child,\" Peaseblossom said. \"And I do thank you ever so joyously for your kindness.\" \"So do I,\" said Alice. \"I read fairy tales all the time, but I never thought one would come to me first. Perhaps when I grow up, I'll write another fairy tale about me and you both.\" Peaseblossom giggled, covering her mouth with her hand modestly while the dancing magic on Alice's feet ended. Then, as she looked up at the wall over the mantel, the little fairy was in gleeful surprise to see a large, square mirror hanging above the fireplace. It looked remarkable seeing two of her at once, as her dust made the space around her glow. \"What a device,\" Peaseblossom said, looking herself over in the mirror. \"It's as though I see myself in the reflection of a great pond. But no ripple at all.\" \"That's a mirror,\" Richard said, striding up to the fireplace. Alice followed Richard, all the while frowning in thought at the mirror. When at last she was climbing up on a chair and onto the mantel with Peaseblossom, she put her hand to the glass. As expected, it reflected back, even as she made a little motion with her head. \"Little fairy,\" Alice addressed her, \"Mr. Proverb, er, Richard, sir, have you ever wondered what's on the other side of the mirror before?\" \"Nothing except your reflection, I guess,\" Richard answered. But he then stopped short in his doubtful thoughts. \"But, then, I've been seeing lots of strange, fantastic things since I got here. Maybe there is more than just a reflection.\" Alice gazed at herself in the glass, looking at the reflection over and under, trying to find something different. Taking her hand away, she moved it once more towards the glass, with her pointer finger extended out. And when she touched her finger to the mirror, the glass moved with it, stretching inward like a sheet of thin rubber! Alice took her hand away, surprised at what she had seen. \"Oh,\" she yelped, pressing her hand further inside the glass. The further that Alice pressed her hand into the mirror, the tighter the glass became, until finally, her fingers broke through! But it didn't break. It simply pressed around her while Alice moved her arm, and then her whole body into the mirror. \"Where are you going?\" Peaseblossom asked Alice. But her question came too late, as Alice had already stepped through the mirror. \"Gods know what is through yonder mirror,\" the fairy said, looking worriedly, and yet curiously, into the mirror. \"Mayhap 'tis a shortcut.\" Richard looked lopsidedly into the mirror. He hadn't read Through the Looking Glass and What Alice Found There before, and so he didn't know what lay beyond it. One thing was for sure though: it didn't bring much logic or direction in his search. But Peaseblossom was already pushing through the glass.[Chapter 13] Chapter 13 No matter what sorts of things Chloe did by herself in the tower, nothing seemed to peak her growing emotion at what had happened between her, Carrie, and the Count. She was angry enough as it was, and thus, for hours after the encounter, she had a hard time forgetting Dracula's face, as well as Carrie's. It put a terrible heaviness upon Chloe that was extremely hard to deal with. Dracula had done perhaps the very worst of his cruel acts yet, and that was stealing her chance of making a friend within this horrible place. It took enormous amounts of solid willpower to not tell herself that she hated Carrie too, although it didn't seem like she had even tried to stand up to Dracula. Still, every time Chloe glanced through the window in Carrie's tower, the tears and butterflies couldn't help but come. They would be just millimeters from spilling out, before Chloe quickly shoved the curtains back into place, and ducked back into her own confinement. Of course, that wasn't too comforting either, but she didn't see what other alternative she had. If Dracula caught her outside the tower, there would be the devil to pay. And despite the great magnitude of her powers, not even she could deal with that. Not ever. Chloe was lonely, but her only real friend was her imagination. To pass large amounts of time, she often entertained herself by imagining scenes from movies she had seen and then played around with them using color, light, and sound. The results were often satisfactory, but if she really got herself to laugh from the bottom of her stomach, then she would feel as happy as if she were spending time with Richard or in a favorite book. Moments and memories like that brought a kind of warmth to her that was becoming quite rare the more days she spent in the tower. At first, Chloe had counted the days she was a prisoner. But at this point in time, counting the days didn't hold too much meaning anymore. She thought of it like a school year, where at first, you were counting the days in which you were involved in it, but as routine became routine and things took you away, then there was no point. But this time, it held a much deeper kind of emotion to it, because she was alone without anything except her imagination. Chloe was perfectly fine with that at first, but she needed someone that she could talk to. And she feared she would go mad if she went too much longer without company. Most often, Chloe would simply lie on her bed, with the curtains drawn, and several lit candles surrounded her for serenity. She would close her eyes and imagine the afternoons in the library she had spent with Richard, talking about nothing but books and their own lives. She did her best to relive every laugh, every conversation, and every smile that was shown, because it was one of her only solaces in this grim world. Chloe did this sort of thing on routine now, but mostly during the times when Dracula would fly by her window in his bat form, or when Carrie was peeking up at her. She didn't want to look too suspicious as to what she was actually brewing in her mind, aside from precious memories of old. From the start of the day after the confrontation, Chloe had ultimately decided she was not going to be a helpless damsel for whatever time she spent here. As a Proverb, she thought it her duty to escape as soon as she could and somehow return to the rotunda, where she would most likely find the Pagemaster, and therefore, Richard. Just seeing her friend's face again was enough to temporarily boost Chloe's mental energy in dreaming up ways to escape without being seen. Unfortunately, she soon discovered that the same red wizards that captured her in the rotunda were often moving about on the grounds. Dracula was always flitting around as a bat at night. And even Carrie, whose soft meekness never left her bloody acne-ridden face, was, at some point, watching Chloe. She wasn't about to let that stop her- not at any rate. Chloe prided herself on her thinking under pressure. All the danger she had been through since entering the library had given her that ability, and as often as she could, Chloe intended to think of how to escape her predicament, with the least amount of scars as was possible. One day, Chloe was especially stuck in her task of bringing a good plan to life. Her mind was far off, and so immersed in the task at hand that her eyes were actually glazed over, like in a trance. They were gazing away into the woods, and so entranced, they didn't notice a ladder being propped up against the tower. Or, that there were two men climbing the ladder towards the window. One of them had a scraggly and very pale face, wearing a long coat of musty black-grey, with dark, gleaming eyes that were sunk deep in his head. And the other was extremely thin, with his greasy hair hanging over his eyes, sparkling with an untamable madness. \"Missy?\" Chloe let out a yelp, stumbling back from the window and falling on her behind on the floor. The two men just entered through the tower window casually, kicking aside the empty bedside table that stood in their way. \"Whoa, wait!\" Chloe said, getting back to her feet. \"What are you two doing in here? How did you…?\" \"Your silence would be most pleasing, missy,\" the tall man in the long coat said. \"Our order of business comes from the respectable Count Dracula, as well as our own. We've been looking to visit you in your quarters for quite some time, you see; me, and my coworker, Mr. Renfield.\" The thin man with the wide, mad eyes peeked at Chloe, smiling grimly at her. She shuddered, slightly repulsed at seeing these two villains here. \"Why, Miss Chloe,\" Renfield said, creeping towards her with his scraggly hand reaching out its trembling fingers. \"My master tells me so much about you. And now, in the flesh, here…here you stand…before me! What an honor…\" \"Stop it!\" Chloe commanded harshly. \"He told me you would be feisty,\" Renfield continued, keeping his gleaming eyes on her. \"He also said that you were as pretty as the angels from heaven. He's wrong. He's very wrong. If God himself had a maiden, she would have your face, your hair\"- he reached and took a bunch of her strawberry locks in his shaking hand –\"such beauty can surpass…\" Chloe wriggled her hair out of Renfield's reach, taking an extra step back to show that she meant what she did. In person, Renfield was even more repulsive and disgusting than she pictured. Renfield's shoulders shook when suddenly, the tall man grabbed him and pulled him away from Chloe, shoving him into the canopy on the bed. He turned and gave a nasty glare at the madman before glancing at Chloe, a sly and sort of charming smile on his face. \"Do pardon my good coworker here, he has problems with being around pretty women,\" he said, his eyes almost disappearing into his skull with his deep frown. \"In fact, I'm almost certain that it would be dangerous to even be within a millimeter of him.\" Chloe looked on at the man, half in fright and half with the same repulsion she felt for Renfield. She was very still, not going anywhere from her spot. \"Evidently, you do not know me,\" the man said. \"Yes, I might,\" Chloe whispered. \"Though, I will say that I'm afraid to admit it.\" \"Then, by all means, make the suggestion to it,\" the man prodded. \"I don't always pride myself on learning the intellectual capabilities of women, but yours seem to be particularly enticing.\" Chloe looked the man over, breaking down every individual detail to be sure she was correct in her assumption. She hadn't expected to come across another villain of his kind here, but he was just as extraordinary as Dracula himself. \"You're Professor James Moriarty,\" she finally replied. \"Bravo, a woman of your mental facilities is indeed a pleasure to meet,\" the professor said with a tip of his old top hat. Chloe nodded, rolling her eyes in the process. These two were the last people she wanted to see in her condition. Perhaps if she summoned up enough of her power, she could blast them right out the window like she did to the Count. That sort of thing sounded all too sweet right about now. \"Now you answer to me,\" she said instead. \"What kind of business do you have with Dracula?\" \"Nothing of the serious sort,\" Moriarty answered. \"Seeing that the poor man's affliction is great repulsion of the sun and the daylight, he sent Renfield and me to merely see that you are right at home here. He tells me it's not often he has such an honored guest.\" \"Honored?\" Chloe nearly spit on the word after it left her mouth. \"He calls honoring a guest locking her up in a high tower without any decent company. Quite the host , I say.\" She crossed her arms and looked snidely at the professor. \"You're very lucky,\" Renfield piped up. \"The master wishes to take you as something very, very special after you help us.\" \"Take me? What do you mean?\" Chloe wanted to know, a growing horror coming up through her throat. \"You stupid, crocodile-mouthed imbecile!\" Moriarty growled, \"Dracula himself was supposed to say such a thing.\" \"For crying out loud, what are you talking about?\" Chloe nearly shouted at them. Moriarty glared once more at Renfield, and with a frustrated sigh, bowed his head, holding his hat close as if in mourning. He stepped closer to the waiting Chloe. \"The Count was meant to say this, dear girl. Once your powers have enabled us to conquer the Pagemaster's kingdom, then you and the Count will have quite the important engagement to go through with. And I say this in the literal sense of the word because…that is what the Count shall ask of you.\" Chloe ran the words over and over in her head, seeing if she heard him right. An important engagement, after the war was over? What on earth could that mean? \"Oh yes, a white dress shall look most ravishing on someone like you, sweet little girl,\" Renfield said, chuckling in choppy, separate breaths at Chloe's face. Suddenly, it clicked. \"White dress, engagement…\" Chloe choked on the words while she said them. \"No! You don't mean it!\" \"The Count's intentions come from the bottom of his dead heart,\" Moriarty said. \"He'll take no one else as his companion, or as his helper. But even with my superior intellect, and your massive imagination, there is no way out for you.\" \"What makes you say that?\" Chloe said, putting on a large, questioning sneer, with her fists on her hips. Moriarty gave Chloe a grim frown, his eyebrows seeming to sink down over his eyes. \"Unfortunately, little girl, it's not my duty to save you from mortal danger. And certainly, I don't intend on abandoning my post as one of the minds behind this war for even a Proverb. The Prince would have been much better living here in his world, were it not for the foul-soul Englishmen who took his life.\" Chloe stomped up to the professor, looking him square in his sag-eyes. \"He was old !\" she cried, throwing her angry hands in the air. \"These things happen! Nobody killed him, either, and, if you'd really known him, you'd know that he was the best, kindest grandfather- prince- that this world and the next will ever know. He loved living in my world, and he chose to die there when he got old enough!\" \"You truly are a delusional little pet of a girl,\" the professor sneered, bending down over Chloe so that she was bending her back in a slight arch. \"Really, it's all that you and your comrades do. They boast and whine that their talents are above those who seek the greatest of what there is to seek. Like myself. Mathematics, they say, is something promising to teach to nincompoops like one Sherlock Holmes, but I? I put my mind to use to become the supreme criminal brain that every Londoner fears.\" \"You don't scare me at all,\" Chloe stated bravely, not taking her eyes off of him. \"Perhaps not in this moment,\" Moriarty said, \"but when you should find yourself lying on the doorstep of some poor Londoner's flat while your friends are under slaughter of myself or the Count, you'll surely change your mind. Even a misled child like you would know it foolish to defy him.\" \"I'll twist what you said,\" Chloe said. \"It's foolish of him to come up against me. I've badly hurt him before, and I'm warning you; I'll surely do the very same to you unless you climb back out on that ladder.\" Moriarty glanced back at Renfield, and then back to Chloe, the sinister sneer returning to haunt his already-sunken features. There was something in his look that showed his understanding, but also a twisted train of thought. \"If you wish it so,\" he said, gesturing for Renfield to follow, and then heading for the window. \"But be warned. You may have the imagination, but we are still several steps ahead. You might also believe the conditions of your tower are safe, but, you escape, we will know. And, perhaps if you do, the chances of mercy being shown to you are as likely as Holmes parading around Baker Street with my innards in a wooden box. Prepare to join our side should you not comply in the slightest.\" With a sly tip of his hat, he disappeared out the window. Renfield followed close behind, glancing over his shoulder with such a wide gleam in his eyes above a maniacal smile, that Chloe sucked in a breath seeing such madness. \"One way or another,\" he said, climbing out. \"One way or another, the master will have you. And the lives of your friends. Just you wait.\"[Chapter 14] Chapter 14 If there was anything weird in the world of books, it was feeling a rubbery mirror against one's weary arms. Richard shivered while he followed Peaseblossom through the transforming glass, feeling as though he was passing through an ice-cold sheet of slick rubber, but at the same time, there were bugs skittering up and down on him while the glass pulsed around him. Finally, with one leap off the mantel, Richard jumped down and away from the mirror. He still felt the bug-like skittering on his skin even after pushing through, and found that he was rubbing his arms uncomfortably. But Alice and Peaseblossom were doing no such thing. \"Curious,\" Alice murmured, stealing one more glance at the mirror, and then to the surroundings about them. Richard followed the little girl's glance, and blinked twice in recognizing what was so curious. The room was practically mirrored on the other side to which they had stepped. Everything looked precisely the same, except it was like how it appeared in the mirror- reversed. Richard and Alice both were somewhat fascinated by where the mysterious looking glass had taken them. Peaseblossom, however, sulked just a little, still floating next to the mirror. \"'Twas quite the saddening disappointment, my lord,\" she said, her voice having suddenly turned sour. \"I had been so hoping upon a portal to the fairy kingdom.\" Richard nodded in agreement, looking into the mirror as well. \"But, you know, it's not like we can't go back. The mirror's still there, so all we have to do is say bye to Alice and just continue on our way.\" Peaseblossom peered at her reflection in the glass, making more strange yet comic moves at herself in fascination. \"Well, I suppose, if it shall be that simple.\" The little fairy was a tad hesitant at saying farewell to Alice, but she was finally able to leap off of the mantel and towards the girl. In her sudden haste, however, Peaseblossom's tiny feet somehow managed to shove a huge black book off the mantel, which tumbled to the floor with a loud bump! Alice leapt a foot in the air when she heard the bump, leaping backwards into a huge armchair behind her. She yelped softly, her eyes widening, both at the shock of falling into the chair, and seeing the big book on the floor. Her surprise seemed great enough that she didn't even move, leaving Richard to bend down and pick up the book. His one hand strained to pick up the book, seeing as it was so massive. It was almost twice the size of a dictionary, the cover almost three times as thick as usual. Richard peered thoughtfully at the dark cover, turning it over in his hands before he finally decided to open the cover. \"What's in there?\" Alice asked, pointing curiously at the book. Richard shrugged an answer, but he quickly turned the book over to Alice when he opened the first few pages, and then to one page entitled, \" Jabberwocky\" . The text was written in mirrored form, so Richard had to hold it up to the mirror to read it. Alice followed him, standing on her tiptoes to see better. \"'Jabberwocky'?\" Alice looked between Richard and the mysterious name, as if searching for an answer to her pondering on her new friend's face. \"I think I've heard about that before,\" Richard said. \"It sounds a little like Lewis Carroll to me.\" \"Lewis Carroll?\" Now Alice was really confused. \"Never mind,\" Richard said, not feeling in the least like explaining a kooky-headed author to a level-headed girl like Alice. He shook his head, and turned the page to the poem following the title, with Peaseblossom fluttering over his shoulder. Together, at different levels of voice, he and Alice read aloud the first verses, \"' Twas brillig, and the slithy toves Did gyre and gimble in the wabe; All mimsy were the borogoves, And the mome raths outgrabe. Beware the Jabberwock, my son! The jaws that bite, the claws that catch! Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun The frumious Bandersnatch!\" Richard's low voice continued until the end of the nonsensical poem, but Alice stopped right after the second verse. \"I don't understand this,\" she stated, putting her palm down on the words she'd already read. \"It's frightening, and I'd really like it if you would stop reading.\" She looked at Richard with alarm in her eyes, and her mouth tensed into a panicked frown. Richard had become so engrossed in the strange, stirring words of the poem that he didn't listen at first, until Peaseblossom blew some dust into his face. The pink cloud settled on Richard's nose before he finally stopped to brush it from his face, following the annoying dust with a short sneeze that fluttered the page. Alice briefly covered herself so as not to directly catch the sneeze, but she kindly offered Richard her handkerchief to relieve himself of another blow. He declined the offer by rubbing his nose gently, and giving Peaseblossom an annoyed scowl. \"Thank you,\" Alice said, at Richard's silence at the poem's end. Richard nodded quickly to acknowledge Alice's thanks, but turned his attention back to the words on the page. He never remembered reading anything so abstract, and yet so intriguing. But at the same time, he was tensing. In all the marvelous and oddball things he'd come across in his journeys, he never forgot the power that any book held in this world. And he was getting the feeling that perhaps, opening the book wasn't such a good idea. Books were harmless, but their content held magnificent influence, especially when he - a Proverb- opened them. \"Oh, shoot!\" Richard muttered. Before Alice or Peaseblossom could react, something massive and black as a nighttime ocean screamed out of the pages. A mighty roar escaped into the air, accompanied by the un-enveloping of a great pair of smoky wings, large and scaly as a dragon's. A head as big as a shopping window popped from the page, rearing up on its long neck to let out another screechy roar. Two dangerously sharp claws the size of the head clenched at the edges of the book, and Alice leapt away from the mantel, and Richard yelled, dropping the book to the floor. Richard cringed, instantly regretting having noticed the book, much more in reading it aloud. Alice backed into the corner, right alongside the fireplace with the mirror on top, shielding herself with her arms. Peaseblossom followed her, trying to comfort the frightened girl, but Alice's screaming didn't help to lower the tension. Richard swiped the book just as the creature appeared entirely out of the yellowing pages, and ran to his friends. \"The magnitude of thy power shows itself!\" Peaseblossom squeaked. \"Make haste, my lord!\" She turned, and buried her tiny face into Alice's sleeve, and Alice held the little fairy close to her, tears threatening to come with her abundant fear. Richard's heart was screaming at him to conjure something to combat the newly awakened Jabberwocky. The first thing he thought to do, however, was unsheathe his sword, which he lunged at the monster. The Jabberwocky advanced rapidly upon the group, its enormous tail and flapping wings knocking over furniture and breaking glass figurines while it moved to swallow Richard. Its wide, yellow eyes bore into Richard, seeming to reach into him and tug on his insides, forcing more fright and tension into him like deathly-tasting poison. When the Jabberwocky lunged with its snapping jaws at him, Richard dove out the way, and quickly regained himself for an attack. But the monster was just as quick. It swung its head and bit down into the floor, missing Richard by a needle's width of an inch. \"Richard!\" Alice called out. \"Please, hurry!\" At hearing the cry, Richard swiftly prepared himself, brandishing the sword heftily in his hand. And when the Jabberwocky moved its toothy mouth his way, he swung the blade at the beast's face as hard as he could. It was as though there was a great armor built up around the monster's scaly body, because there was naught but a foot-wide scratch on it. It surprised Richard. A swing like that should have cut the Jabberwocky completely open. But to no avail at all! In just a bit of a second, a lightning-like memory flashed into Richard's mind, by looking impulsively into the bright yellow eyes of the Jabberwocky. In that second, he knew how he could possibly allow escape for his friends back through the mirror. His heart swelled in his inner triumph, and so, he firmly held his sword handle again and opened his mouth to speak. \" The Jabberwocky poem book of 'Through the Looking Glass'! The vorpal sword!\" While Richard shouted the words, he swung his other arm like a party animal in a bowling alley, and the black book skid across the floor, stopping at Alice's feet. She yelped when she saw it, but she didn't pick it up again. The Jabberwocky turned around to follow the sliding book, completely turning its head away from Richard, to Alice and Peaseblossom. Richard used this opportunity to observe the change in his own sword. Within the blink of an eye, it had transformed into a silver-handled weapon, with a point so sharp, it looked strong enough to cut through stone! While taking no more time to observe the majesty of the sword, Richard reared up his arm, and just as the Jabberwocky turned back around to finish its prey, the tip of his blade seared across the beast's wide forehead, drawing a thick line of thick fluid from the scales. While the Jabberwocky nearly ceased all movement to recover, Richard dashed under the monster's huge belly and joined his friends on the other side. Without a moment's hesitation, he took Alice's tiny hand in his and pulled her along towards the mirror, now located close to the side of the writhing Jabberwocky. Sheathing his sword, Richard pointed up to the mirror. \"Go, hurry, Alice!\" he said. I'll meet you and Peaseblossom on the other side of the mirror.\" Alice nodded her head, and climbed on top of a chair she managed to drag towards the fireplace. Hoisting herself onto the mantel, she shoved through the mirror, and Richard, glancing quickly back at the Jabberwocky, followed her through, just before the recovering beast could snatch him back with its demonic talons. Richard had pushed through the mirror so rapidly, that instead of stepping onto the mantel, he stepped into thin air and tumbled from the transformed glass and onto the floor. His cheek hit the carpet, and there came a blow to his stomach that almost made him sick, but he forcefully swallowed it back while he got his footing again. \"Will you be all right?\" Alice asked sweetly, gently touching Richard's arms. \"Yeah, I will,\" he answered, grinning at her. \"Thank you very much,\" Alice said, \"for helping us. That was really, truly brave.\" \"Well, no problem,\" Richard said, shrugging sheepishly. \"All in a day's work, I guess.\" He glanced behind him at the mirror, where their reflections were clear as day. \"Just one problem now. The Jabberwocky is still in there, on the other side. It's not like it can go back in the book by itself and we can forget about it.\" \"Which is why I happily imagine the idea that little Alice accompanies us to King Oberon,\" Peaseblossom said enthusiastically. \"It is not safe to be here whilst that creature is lurking, even if it is on the other end of the looking glass.\" \"Can I?\" Alice asked, half surprised and half excited. Richard looked down at Alice's curious and hopeful expression. She was such a small girl, and could get into such big trouble if she didn't have someone to protect her from monsters like the Jabberwocky. He shook his head, remembering his stupidity in bringing the Jabberwocky out of the book. Perhaps if he hadn't done that, Alice would be perfectly all right staying here in her own story. But if the Jabberwocky ever managed to squeeze through the mirror, then Alice was in grave danger. Then again, what parts of the literary world were not in grave danger during these times, particularly now when a new villain had accidentally been brought out? He answered by reaching out his hand to Alice. She drew her hands back in realizing Richard's intentions, but she quickly put her hand in Richard's, agreeing to join her new friends on their perilous journey to find a King Oberon. \"Shan't we go now?\" Alice asked, looking up reassuringly at Richard, almost as though he was an endearing father taking her to the park. Richard grinned momentarily at her. \"Rrrraaaahhhhrrrrr!\" All three friends jumped when the Jabberwocky's screechy roar cut through the air, and for a moment, its reflection seemed to materialize in the mirror, its wings flapping swiftly. And underneath the roar, two high-pitched squeals sounded from upstairs. \"Oh, Kitty! Snowdrop!\" Alice said, looking desperately up and around the room. \"The poor dears have run off. What are they to do with that thing on the other side of the looking glass?\" Richard felt sympathy for Alice, but he didn't feel it would be good for this journey if they had two rambunctious kittens coming along. He had a feeling that they could take care of themselves; after all, they were cats. Why else would so many people like to keep them as pets? And besides, the Jabberwocky might catch up soon. They would have to get away while they could. \"They'll be okay,\" Richard said sympathetically, \"but we have to get out of here!\" \"Ay, come, make haste!\" Peaseblossom urged, pulling on Alice's skirt. \"But, the little dears!\" Alice protested. \"I'm sorry, but we have to go!\" Richard gently tugged on Alice's hand. \"They're cats- they can take care of themselves for a long time!\" The Jabberwocky's roar came through the house again, and the group scurried through the front door, running out into the winter air, keeping the swift pace until they were at least two blocks away from the house. Even then they could still hear snippets of the Jabberwocky's cry. \"I'm sorry, Alice,\" Richard said. Alice didn't answer him. She already had her arms around herself, shivering slightly. Even when they were that far from Alice's wintry setting, the snow still fell. And frankly, it had gotten much colder since then, for some strange reason. \"It's so cold out here,\" Alice remarked, her teeth chattering loudly. \"This should do it,\" Richard said, pointing his finger at Alice, saying \" 'The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. The White Witch's fur cloak!\" In an instant, Alice was wrapped in an elaborate cloak of white and grey furs, decorated with silks and a clasp of silver cord. She immediately stopped shivering, and a relieved sigh escaped her throat. \"Thank you,\" Alice said, smiling sincerely at Richard. Richard grinned again, wrapping his cape around him. \"But, I don't see how we're going to get anywhere in this weather.\" \"Mayhap we ought to make shelter,\" Peaseblossom suggested, wrapping herself in the outer folds of Alice's cloak. \"I don't know what I can come up with,\" Richard said helplessly, as his ears picked up the sounds of flapping wings overhead, while a shadow fell over the snow.[Chapter 15] Chapter 15 \"Hello?\" With a collective gasp, Richard, Alice, and Peaseblossom shot their gazes upward, and all three looked into the blurry shadow of a creature flying not too high above them. It had the same scaly wings as the Jabberwocky, but its voice calling down to them was actually like that of a young man yelling through the air. Slowly, the creature began to slant its wings to the ground, and it came to a landing right next to Richard, whose stunned expression kept him from greeting this new wild thing. \"It's a dragon,\" he said to himself. The dragon nodded its head, having heard the whisper. \"Indeed, that I am,\" it said. \"I was flying along, on my way to find the Rim of Heaven, and so I've happened to come across the lot of you. If I'm not mistaken, you two must be quite powerful wizards.\" He pointed with his eyes at Richard and Alice. \"What- who do I have the honor of addressing,\" Alice asked, correcting herself so as not to offend the dragon, \"so unexpectedly?\" \"My name is Firedrake,\" the dragon answered, gesturing modestly with his claw to his shiny, silver scales. \"And, who are you all? I've been flying for days, and I haven't seen any humans wandering about, especially in these kinds of days when a war is boiling up.\" \"We're in search of a brave warrior lady,\" Peaseblossom answered, flying up to Firedrake's nose. \"But in order to locate said woman, we must make rapid time to the fairy kingdom, from which I was born. But, I fear that we shall not make it there so fast, when numerous opposing forces are lurking everywhere we come to. And this weather is certainly no help to us, either!\" Peaseblossom rubbed her arms very fast to emphasize her cold state, and afterwards, she even let loose a little sneeze that caused a cloud of fairy dust to fly away with the winter wind. \"Poor little fairy,\" Firedrake said sympathetically. \"Well, then, by all means, why don't you ask your wizard masters to conjure up a coat for you? If they can make such grand things from thin air, surely you know they'll do the same for a creature like you.\" \"Um, excuse me, um, Firedrake,\" Richard said, stepping up to the dragon, despite his slight tentativeness at being in the presence of a dragon. \"We're not exactly wizards.\" \"Well, I'm not,\" Alice added, rushing up to Richard's side. \"But my friend, Richard, can make magic happen. He made us these coats just by requesting them from…from…well, I suppose I don't know exactly what he did.\" \"I brought them out of a book,\" Richard explained quickly. Firedrake was impressed, if he only slightly showed it. \"Is that all?\" he wanted to know. \"You have any other talents besides bringing things from books?\" \"Naught but that,\" Peaseblossom said. \"It also just so happens that Richard is the Pagemaster's very own Proverb of the Books!\" Firedrake's expression widened so greatly, every one of his dragon teeth showed themselves. He respectfully lowered his head, and folded in his wings. \"Oh, well then, pardon me,\" he said. \"If I'd known I was speaking to a Proverb, I would have addressed you much more formally. It's wonderful to meet you.\" Richard nodded. These formal pleasantries were starting to get on his nerves. \"All right, thanks, Firedrake,\" he said to eagerly end the formalities. \"Now, I guess what we want to know is, well…if you would be nice enough to take us to the fairy kingdom Peaseblossom was talking about. We need to find my friend as soon as we can, especially before the war heats up even more.\" Firedrake's golden-brown eyes flashed gently as he looked between the members of the trio he just met. Finding the Rim of Heaven- the place where all dragons could live in peace and away from treacherous humans- was most important to him, as it was to every dragon from Dragon Rider . But like any other human or creature of this world, it was a second dream to meet one of the Proverbs. Since the beginning of written literature, their identities were always a secret for everyone, and not even the Pagemaster himself had ever seemed sure of who they were. Firedrake had even started to doubt the stories of the Proverbs, even though their identities and stories were inscribed in the lore of this world. And now here was one, in the flesh! Doubt still lingered however, until he looked into the hopeful, pleading blue eyes of the Proverb standing at his cheek. \"I had hoped I would be off to the Rim of Heaven soon enough,\" Firedrake murmured. \"But, now, I find myself wishing to assist a noble person such as you, Proverb. I don't think it right for a dragon to leave behind a person with power inside of them. And with this war about to happen, and a Proverb unprotected, it's all the more reason for you to climb aboard.\" \"And are thou willing to accompany us until the lady Chloe's rescue is at hand?\" Peaseblossom asked, putting on her sweetest face. \"It is not too often I do this,\" Firedrake replied. \"A boy like you should not be without his lady in the midst of an enmity like this.\" \"I would like to see her again,\" Richard agreed. \"Then you shall- faster than you hope to,\" Firedrake said. \"Come on. I'll start our journey from right here.\" Peaseblossom smiled all the way up to her ears, and she fluttered up to the dragon to give him a kiss on the nose. \"Thou hast the kindest heart of any dragon,\" she said. \"I shall make for thee a crown of roses once I can.\" Firedrake watched Peaseblossom fly over his head, where she took her place in the air next to Richard and Alice, who sat behind each other single file. They huddled into their coats while another freezing wind whipped at their backs. \"Everyone ready?\" Firedrake asked, while he spread his wings out like an airplane. Richard tucked himself into his coat even further, and after getting an answer from Alice and Peaseblossom, nodded his head at the dragon. \"Hold on!\" Firedrake immediately flapped his wings and took to the blank sky, stirring several huge clouds of snowy dust in his wake. He blew a puff of air from his lungs, and cleared the snow from his path while he flew forward into the clouds above. In the rush of wind that came during the takeoff, both Richard and Alice yelped as they grabbed hold of Firedrake's scales on his back. Peaseblossom even zipped inside Alice's hood, tucking herself within the immense folds like a sleeping bag. Some fairy dust flew off of her while Firedrake found a comfortable altitude in the sky. When Firedrake slowed down a little, Richard and Alice relaxed their grip, taking a moment to readjust their coats from takeoff. The wind was just as strong as it was on the ground, but at least the snow was always coming at them from behind. Peaseblossom soon found it quite uncomfortable in Alice's hood with the wind penetrating to her sensitive body, so she wriggled out and flew like a lightning bolt in front of Richard, where she settled into his lap. Gently, he took some of the folds of his coat and wrapped it around her. Behind him, Richard heard Alice breathe heavily, her eyes looking around on either side of her, where Firedrake's wings flapped majestically. \"How remarkable!\" she exclaimed softly. \"Dragons are such wonderful things. It's not a wonder people love them so much.\" Richard nodded, chuckling a little to himself. \"Yeah. The last time I met a dragon, it almost tried to eat me. Well, it did!\" Alice and Peaseblossom both shot wide-eyed looks at Richard. \"You were eaten alive by a real dragon?\" Alice said, putting her hands on her cheeks in shock. \"How ever did you survive it?\" \"I opened up a book, and came out on a beanstalk,\" Richard explained. \"I'm not sure whether it was my powers or just the book that got me out, but yep, here I am.\" \"'Tis the mark of a true epic hero,\" Peaseblossom beamed. \"I do admire thee.\" Alice sighed, leaning down with her cheeks in her palms on Firedrake's back. \"You're incredible, Richard,\" she said. \"You've done so much. And now I suppose you can get your girl friend back and lead this war to the end!\" \"Thanks,\" Richard said. He was about to turn away, but then looked back at Alice with an alarmed expression. \"You won't ask to fight in this war, will you?\" \"Good heavens, no!\" Alice said, shaking her head. \"I'm just a little girl. And little girls don't fight in wars. But I do know lots and lots of war heroes, and they are such marvelous people. My sister seems to fancy them sometimes, and I love them just the same.\" \"Well, just hope you can have another one who will actually survive,\" Richard said. \"I've known about this for a long time, but I'm still not very sure about it.\" \"Perhaps you shall,\" Alice said, stretching her arms and rubbing her eyes. \"Once you've slept on it somewhat. I know I will do that right now.\" She gathered some extra folds of her coat and bundled them up under her head, lying with the coat covering her like a blanket. \"I'll wake you up when we get there.\" Richard readjusted Alice's coat, and looked ahead into Firedrake's path of flight, gently massaging Alice's shoulder affectionately in the meantime. \"Sweet child,\" Peaseblossom mused, \"and oh so intelligent. I'm glad she's with us.\" \"Yeah,\" Richard agreed. \"I just feel bad that I was stupid enough to bring the Jabberwocky out. Maybe then, Alice could still be at home with her cats. I think it's really dangerous for her to be out here when she could get in trouble. I mean, I already have Chloe, you, now Alice and Firedrake to worry about if something's might happen. And I don't want to be the one responsible for injuries, or even death.\" The thought was most unfathomable to him. \"I have faith Firedrake shall get us close enough to the fairy kingdom,\" Peaseblossom said gently, hugging her arms around Richard's torso. \"I may be only a wee fairy, but evil can still underestimate a fairy's magic. For good magic shall always conquer that of wicked. And thus, the love you hold for your lady shall also.\" Richard rolled his eyes, lying on his side. He didn't like the feeling he got when people assumed Chloe was like his true love, or something of the sort. He honestly liked her, but he wasn't so sure about girlfriend material. That kind of feeling had always been so strange and foreign to him, especially for someone who'd always been rejected by girls in his childhood. And besides, what kind of relationship was that if no one could accept it? If something were to happen during inevitable battle? Curling up into his cloak next to Peaseblossom, Richard shut his eyes and tried to think of a black space that did not include any of his silly worries, while he drifted off to sleep.[Chapter 16] Chapter 16 With every moment that Richard and his friends were flying through the sky, he grew more and more amazed. He had seen so many movies and read of lots of scenes where people flew on top of dragons. It was cool before, in imagining it unfold, but riding on Firedrake was ten times more incredible than flying on an airplane. Or anything else of the sort- that much was certain. For when could you feel the wind on your face so strongly, or witness what you were flying over within such a tangible distance? Not a single second was boring when he was flying. Alice was enjoying herself as well. While not quite as outwardly enthusiastic as Richard, she liked to lie on her back and watch the sky above them, pointing out the unique-looking clouds shifting along with Firedrake's flight. \"That looks like a dodo bird,\" she would say, pointing her finger above her. \"And that one reminds me of a gryphon. I think it almost looks like you, Firedrake!\" When she got tired of that, she sat upright with one leg on either side of Firedrake's body and scout out the marvelous spaces below them. Now that they had flown out of her story, the land was turning green and lush again. The sky was clear, so there was no more need for their coats. Richard had discarded them when Firedrake first stopped to rest, so they could enjoy the spring-like weather inside the puffy clouds. Firedrake even got some enjoyment out of flying through the clear air, a grin covering his face while he searched for a land of sparkling shrubbery and beauty, for that was how Peaseblossom had described the fairy kingdom. But the springy air didn't always bring happy feeling to some members of the group. \"I've just received a vision,\" Peaseblossom said one afternoon, about three or four days into their journey through the sky. \"The King and his queen have not quite managed to settle their quarrel, but it seems to be growing worse by the ungodly hour.\" \"Does he know that we are coming?\" Firedrake wondered aloud. \"No, not of late,\" Peaseblossom answered. \"But I do fear it shall be harder for us to cause a cease in his wrath. He and his wife fight so much over such petty matters, but 'tis not up to me to stop them. They follow their own unpaved roads, and the other fairies and I are but servants to them.\" \"You will be able to help us get in, won't you?\" Alice asked, hoping for reassurance. \"Ay, certainly,\" the fairy said, \"but it might be difficult. 'Tis nasty business dealing with Oberon, in particular when he is in a storm of emotion. In fact, 'tis raining over the fairy kingdom and many a fairy are hiding from the king.\" Richard didn't say anything. He was nervous about meeting Oberon from the beginning, but with Peaseblossom's new vision, it only made him terrified. Oberon sounded like the king who would pull a Queen of Hearts and execute people who annoyed him. And what with a human like him coming unexpectedly into his kingdom to ask a simple question, well, he wasn't sure how well that would go over. His best hope was that, sooner or later, he would learn where Chloe was being held captive. Until… \"Yonder!\" Peaseblossom shouted, flying in front of Firedrake and pointing excitedly at a dark spot on the green earth. A cloud was hovering over it, flashing wildly with bolts of lightning, with sheets of grey haze washing over the land. Beneath it, was a sparkling spot of shrubbery and trees. Richard looked over Firedrake's head, followed by Alice, and they all looked at the strange new place drawing closer. Peaseblossom gasped. \"It's the…\" \"…fairy kingdom,\" Richard finished, a terrified and excited lump rising in his dry throat. \"This is it, Chloe! I'm coming.\"[Chapter 17] Chapter 17 The routine- the same, blasted routine, after days and days of doing it- was dancing on one of Chloe's last nerves. Each day since the visit from Moriarty and Renfield, Chloe put her imagination to good use, trying to imagine herself into Carrie's mind. Carrie, like Chloe, repeated herself every day. She sat at her vanity, staring at her sad, sorry face in the mirror, and, if Chloe wasn't looking too hard, watched her master's prisoner in the tower above her. But Chloe was doing something different. She watched Carrie, but not so much with contempt, like the telekinetic girl did to her. She watched in stone-hard concentration, attempting to imagine her thoughts into the mind opposite hers. It wasn't supposed to be difficult, and it wasn't at first. But eventually, Carrie looked up at Chloe, and, fixing her with another flex of her powerful mind, Chloe would be tossed from her mind like a bad cat onto a front doorstep. Chloe's task was clear from the beginning. One way or another, she wanted to force the truth into Carrie- that the bloody prank she had undergone on her prom night, was nothing more than an immature joke, pulled off by even more childish novices. She forced it through her own imagination with all that she had, and multiple times, she almost got through to poor Carrie. But, having been molded so cruelly by that event and what had followed, no success came through. To accomplish this, Chloe was willing to even try changing the course of the book, so that Carrie could have survived prom night- that is, by not staying onstage long enough to accept her crown as Prom Queen. And even if Carrie was ultimately humiliated, it also would have been good enough to escape her town, and start out fresh again. But, no. Revenge had to be carried out, and from all that had happened to her, revenge was the only way. And frankly, from what Chloe was learning, perhaps Carrie's telekinesis was stronger than Chloe's own magical imagination. For no matter how she struggled to beak the wall in Carrie's mind, it got much more strenuous every time. It took a long time before Chloe could convince herself that her plans were useless; it would take lots more than just breaking the telekinesis to get through to Carrie. But still, Chloe was starting to believe that not even psychiatric assistance with the world's best doctor could cure Carrie of her mental pessimism. But worst of all, it seemed a possibility for Chloe to be developing a bit of the same attitude. Trying day in and day out for her to accomplish something so straining and impossible, it wore her thin at the end of each day. Particularly when Renfield or Moriarty would pay her a visit, to either \"check up on her\". She was never too angry or tightly wound, necessarily- she was just tired, like those days where she burned the midnight oil on homework, and would afterwards be dying to get to sleep while snugly tucked in bed. That feeling carried throughout her days, becoming groggier and groggier as time went on. Not only that, but visits from Renfield were becoming as often as Chloe's failures at reaching Carrie's mind. And, quite surprisingly, Chloe actually began to wish she could slaughter the madman with the bow and arrows she imagined, or at least just slap some sense into him. Although she already knew such a tactic wouldn't work, it would still feel good. Very good. On a dreary day, Chloe found herself once more slumped on the sill of her window. She felt so exhausted that she was falling asleep right there, and it was only just sunset. It was amazing how she was losing so much energy, but she hoped she wouldn't lose herself altogether while she was still here. \"Hello!\" Chloe sprang backwards when Renfield's head popped into her face. She even caught a nasty whiff of Renfield's scent; the man hadn't bathed perhaps since the day he was diagnosed a madman. Add that with the fact that he was even here, and it was enough to make an already-grouchy Chloe nauseous. \"Go away, Renfield\" was Chloe's response to this intrusion. \"The Master does not wish for his lady to be sad,\" Renfield said, leaping over the sill and into the room. \"He sends me here to see that you were still up and alive.\" \"And so I am,\" Chloe said, a little snidely. \"Now get out! You know what will happen if you don't.\" Power flared through Chloe, and she reveled in the idea of using it. \"I tell him you get prettier every time I come here,\" Renfield said, starting to breathe lustily. \"Truly, you'll find it much more fitting to be his maiden than the other Proverb.\" Chloe took in a sharp breath, her power flaring stronger or a fraction of a second. \"Any person would be a better match for me than him ! He may look like a gentleman, but it's about time you all realized that inside, his heart stopped beating centuries ago. No beating heart, no such chance for me to go to him!\" \"Your choosing him is important to your survival here,\" he stated, rushing up to Chloe to take her power-hot hands. \"If you don't ever choose to comply with us, your time here could be limited.\" \"Then I'll just get out soon enough,\" Chloe said, taking her hands back to her side and out of Renfield's reach. \"Your days here are numbered,\" Renfield clarified. \"In this world, and on this earth.\" These words clicked fast in Chloe's mind, but she couldn't believe them. \"No,\" she said, shaking her head. \"He wouldn't try to kill me. I'm too useful to get rid of.\" \"Master wouldn't harm you at his hands. He'll let you rot up here in this tower forever if it'll make you be his, and part of our side. He and I- we comprehend the power you have, and we shall do what we will to bring it out of you.\" Something- she didn't know what- flashed through Chloe, and the magic in her hands flared hotly, while her angry arm swung through the air to meet Renfield's face. The force of her blow knocked him to the ground, and the relief at having done it surged with even greater force. About time too, for if Renfield visited her again, continuously repeating those exact words, perhaps she would kill him! It would feel wonderful to do something for herself here! Renfield glanced up at her with shock in his eyes, the mad glint having been left behind in the slap. He scrambled back up again, an immense pleading replacing the insanity. \"You must escape,\" he said anxiously, \"while you can. The Master has the strength of the devil. But the professor- he's could be all the more lethal. His criminal mind is beyond even my capacity and the Master's combined. At the end of this nasty war, he plans to rid himself of your soul- in the bloodiest way he can.\" Chloe gulped. She always read the stories of Moriarty's crimes, and of course she knew that he was a murderer. But, still, the idea of him coming after her after all this was extremely unthinkable. Dying at the hands of a literary villain was even more terrifying now than she imagined. No. She wouldn't go through with it. Somehow or other, she would escape. She was done with babysitting Carrie, and trying to get her mind on straight again. She was finished attempting to avoid the Count's inevitable visits, as well as Renfield's and Moriarty's. Escape and getting back to Richard was going to be, until she returned home, her goal. If anything tried to stop her, or even dared stand in her way, she would not hesitate to blast them, from now on! \"Fine then,\" Chloe said. \"I'm getting out of here within the next few days. Whatever it takes to get out, I won't be afraid to do it. Not anymore!\" \"You're a spirited woman,\" Renfield said admirably. \"Do it before he comes.\" \"I…\" \"Shush!\" Renfield commanded sharply, putting his finger to his lips. He turned slowly around, his eyes seeming to scan every corner of the room. Chloe couldn't understand why he was so tense right now, but she got it when she heard a gentle hushing of wind nearby. In through the window, there came a mist, so thick that someone could cut it with a sword. It spread throughout the tower, and Renfield backed Chloe into the wall next to the dark fireplace protectively. \"It's him!\" Renfield said breathlessly. \"It…it…is him ! He's coming!\" Chloe didn't know how to react all of a sudden. What could be said was that she was trembling in her shoes. The Count materialized just inches from Renfield and Chloe. He had nothing to show, save for a neutral line his lips made. It looked safe, and yet it hid a glowering malice, just like what always boiled beneath his courtly demeanor. \"Renfield,\" he purred. \"You have betrayed me.\" \"No, no Master!\" Renfield pleaded, getting on his knees before Dracula. \"I never meant to plague your lady with horrid thoughts of the future. I only did what you said.\" \"Indeed,\" Dracula said, \"and then some. The lady now knows everything. And you told her it all.\" \"I would do no such thing! You're the only one I want to give in to. I have worshipped you always, now and forever!\" The Count was still, before his hand was instantly at Renfield's throat! Renfield gasped a loud, hollow breath, his eyes turning wholly white. \"For you, Lady Chloe,\" Dracula said, with a sneer Chloe's way. She backed against the wall, going to the floor while Dracula carried Renfield at a savage height off the floor. The man was writhing and yelping, but he made no loud noises without any breath. He turned his head back to Chloe, and help was screaming out through that one expression, but Chloe was too petrified to move. She'd said she wasn't afraid of Dracula, but she didn't know what to do, watching Renfield being carried off to some unknown fate. She didn't know if Renfield was one to trust in his moment of sanity, but she did know that he wasn't in for forgiveness now. The Count, however, did not go to the window, like Chloe thought he would. Instead, he walked to the wall beside it, halting there with Renfield still wriggling in his iron fist. Then he reared back his servant, and then smashed him into the wall with a sickening crack, while Renfield screamed! Chloe covered her ears in hearing Renfield's cry. It was like he was calling out for help, and she was like some helpless, hopeless kid who didn't know the next step in what to do. The Count pushed Renfield against the wall once, then twice, and finally four times, before quite instantly, a breathless gasp and an even louder snap shook the air. Chloe shot her gaze upwards, and slapped her hand to her mouth. Dracula stood over Renfield, who didn't move whilst he lay in a growing pool of red. He shouted no more. Dracula didn't move at first, but in a blink of an eye, Chloe was shocked at seeing him step up to her from across the room. She jumped up, and put her hands behind her back against the wall, now even more frightened. In looking at her, Dracula raised his hand quickly, and Chloe looked away, shielding her face just in case. But the Count sighed and brought his hand back down to his side. \"The vermin spoke wrongly,\" he intoned. \"I will not wait for you to change your mind forever. The time is upon us, and while the weary world now grows stronger in preparation of this great battle, so shall we.\" Chloe shook her head, only allowing for her magic to churn inside of her silently. \"You shall be punished for this injustice to me,\" he said, his words boiling with angry contempt. \"Professor Moriarty and I shall not ever take our eyes away from your tower until we are given the proper time to go to battle. Until then, you are to stay up here, and not to look outdoors! And if you dare open that window, this shall happen!\" He pointed to Chloe's feet, and a burning blaze shot up from the floor. Heat blasted into her shoes, and Chloe cried out, jumping off the floor to escape the fire. But wherever she jumped, the fire followed her, nipping at her toes and almost seeming to eat her skin! Thinking on her burning feet, Chloe conjured a bucket of water, and she jumped inside. The fire sizzled and boiled in the water, but her feet still burned in the invincible flames. A scream rose in her throat, and it escaped through her lips without much effort. Dracula watched on, grinning both seductively and wickedly. But finally, he lifted his hand, and the fire hissed and burned out in the water. Chloe glanced down at her burned feet, and stepped out, singed but overall okay. \"Therefore, I should think you would be careful the next time you act upon selfish impulse,\" Dracula said, fixing his trademark glare on his lips. \"Or the days you spend here actually could be numbered. I'll see to it that you'll be my companion, once you have come in useful.\" \"Never,\" Chloe managed to say, despite the lingering pain in her feet. \"Perhaps without my hapless assistant, Mr. Renfield, to help you, you'll think otherwise.\" The Count then turned on his heel and transformed into a bat, flapping noisily out into the night. Chloe remained placid in her spot for a while. All she did was gape and stare at Renfield, in his horribly stained clothes, with his blood spilled all around him. Inside, her emotions were a swirling twister. Having once hated Renfield, Chloe now couldn't help but feel just a mite sorry for the man. It felt like it was mostly her fault that this happened, because if she had just controlled her emotions, she wouldn't have literally snapped sanity back into him. But then, if she hadn't, she wouldn't have known what Dracula and Moriarty were planning for her. It only gave her further motivation to escape much sooner from the tower, and somewhere in her mind, she was grateful to Renfield. It wasn't, after all, his fault in the end that he went mad. Dracula had merely possessed him over time, and forced him to do his bidding to the death. Chloe stepped towards Renfield, looking him over with a heaviness forming in her stomach. Maybe at this point, it was Renfield's place to die, because he always said he would die to serve his master, as well as Chloe. And today, he did actually do her some good, in warning her of what was coming. That could possibly be the noblest thing any sane man would do for a girl in dire trouble. \"Thank you, Renfield,\" Chloe whispered, imagining an animated mop to clean up the blood blemishing the shiny wood. \"I'm sorry.\" She paused before going on again. \"But I guarantee you- one of these days, I'll get out, like you told me to. I won't wait around anymore doing nothing.\" She looked at the newly locked windows, now chained in place by Dracula's magic. She couldn't look outside, but could still picture the sky, with the moon and the beaming stars. \"I'll get out of here,\" she said, \"or die trying!\" ","Summary":" Chapter 1 The incessant barking coming from Jip's mouth, plus the howling storm outside the tent th"},{"Movie":"Pagemaster","Title":"Guardians of the Written","Author":"GreenWallsOfArt","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6314120","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Chapter 1 For a long time, Chloe sat at her window. Through the imaginary window she'd made in the chained window doors, she watched Count Dracula fly by as a bat. It was frequent enough that, in a grouchy moment of rage, she wanted to take her bow and arrows and shoot him down. But the idea of erasing Dracula from the literary world, and its consequences, made Chloe's brain feel constricted and tight, to the point of wanting to bang her head on the stone walls to finally get those thoughts out of her head for good. But one thing was for sure; being trapped alone in the tower still had its advantages. If Chloe couldn't sleep, she would exercise her powers of imagination, and think of ways she could use it to escape this place. She tried several ideas, like imagining a door to a staircase leading outside, but the Count always caught her before she could do anything. This only heightened Chloe's anger at the seductive count, and for an instant, she came very close to grabbing her bow and arrows without thinking. It took a hard bite on her lip to not do such a thing. And, just as annoyingly, Professor Moriarty, Dracula's partner-in-crime, would scale the tower wall, and question Chloe about her decision regarding which side of the war she would join. Her answer was always the forceful no. And the reactions from the villains were the same as well, but they could be just as stringent as Chloe's feelings towards them. Since the fateful day that Chloe had been caught conversing benignly with the Count's old lackey, Renfield, some kind of harsh punishment was given to her if she defied the villains. Because of Chloe's compelling will to escape, she had accidentally given Renfield his sanity back, and he told her what his masters were planning. And when Dracula overheard him, he came to the tower and ended Renfield's life, afterwards punishing Chloe by chaining her windows closed, so she could no longer see the outside world. Ever since then, Chloe took the punishments as they came, time and time again. But they only added to her loneliness and exhaust at thinking so hard of finally escaping her prison. The punishments varied in nature, but no matter how horrible they were supposed to be, Chloe always managed to find ways around them, using her power. The leaders didn't like this; a power like Chloe's could get her anything, even some unknown means of returning home. Because, without Chloe, their plans would never work, and defeat would be a given. Those humans in the real world, oh, how the villains detested them. They had killed the Prince of Imagination- or Mr. Dewey, as Chloe knew him- and a crime like that called for immediate payment- the lives of all humans on earth. Chloe was a Proverb, and a lady of the Binding Order, but she herself was also still one of them. She would be destroyed, along with her other Proverb friend, Richard, and the rest of the Order! That same day, Chloe lay on her ornately decorated bed, racking her brain yet again for some way to get out of the tower. But as far as she knew, she had been here for weeks, doing nothing but think, think, think. And how far had she gotten? Nowhere! Chloe leaned over, and through her window view, saw the land within and beyond Count Dracula's castle. It was always grim and dark, even in the daytime; not even the brightness of white daytime clouds could make the castle or the surrounding land appear any friendlier. Clouds appeared as nothing against the charcoal black of the spires, and the cheerless decaying of the place made Chloe's heart sink deep into her toes. Her teeth gritted together, and she snarled angrily as Dracula passed her again; he made her feel such outrage for her imprisonment. Particularly when she ought to be helping Richard and the Pagemaster save the world from being swallowed up by him and the rest of his villain army! Desperately, Chloe tried to see if she could imagine something else, but now, she was too wrought with despair to think. She had tried everything, but nothing got her what she wanted. One more questioning of her chosen side of battle, and she felt she wouldn't have the strength to look them in the eye anymore. It was true, she was tough, but she had been run clear of her energy. If only she could at least have Richard, or the Pagemaster, pause their business and come for her. And besides, it wasn't at all like she could shoot her bow and arrows mindlessly to help her. At present, she wasn't a warrior maiden, but a damsel in distress. Chloe hated that! Then, her mind flicked back to Richard. If he was fighting the battle right now, or searching for her, wherever he was, she hoped he was thinking of her. She missed being able to know he was there wherever they both were to protect her and be her friend. He was, after all, her best friend; her only friend in fact. To Chloe, the day she bumped into him in the library had been one of the best days of her life, simply because she had made a best friend. And after that, she had someone that she liked very much... And now…? Chloe laughed at herself, at how princess-like she sounded, pining for someone to save her- the first time she had laughed in forever. Except, that was actually what she wanted- she could feel it, from every fiber of herself, that just that was what she wanted; to have Richard find her, rescue her, and then to go save the world using their powers, and restore peace to the literary world. Every time she closed her eyes, she could feel herself becoming a phantom, floating through a peaceful nothingness of light, where there was no Dracula, no troubles- just her and the knowledge that somewhere nearby, Richard would be there to help her, and then, to hold her there, and not let her go. She would be able to pour her heart out to him, release all the troubles and anger Dracula had brewed within her. Chloe longed so much for that to happen to her. But for now, she had to figure out some way for him to come find her. She would have to do something from her tower that could be seen or heard throughout this entire world, through all three of the sections. Easier said than done. Suddenly, Chloe clutched her stomach. All the weeks of loneliness and anger were starting to take their toll. Now she almost felt sick. She had to do something now, so as not to make herself feel worse. Swiftly, she shut her eyes and lay very still on the bed, like she was going right to sleep. But instead of nodding off, she tried to regain that vision of being a ghost, and flying so freely she was nothing but spirit. With her eyes shut, she began to feel lighter as her soul lifted with her thoughts. You are a ghost, you are nothing but air- nothing but a spirit…spirit…spirit… Chloe's breath caught in her throat. Her limbs no longer felt heavy with tire, but light as helium balloons. She could suddenly feel the cold vapor of clouds beneath her feet, and the warm of the sun just barely poking out from behind the clouds. Go on, now. Fly free, be free. Fly. Light as a breath of air, Chloe could feel her body moving forward, no more anchored by gravity. She squeezed her eyes together even more and attempted to dip and swerve through the space. Yes, you are flying now. But now, go on. Be gone with you anger and sorrow. Go away sadness and loneliness. Fly away and never come back… And go away they did, for Chloe could see streaks of color zipping through the space in which she was flying. While she twisted and turned in the air, she flew through the coldness of sorrowful blue, the burning hot mad red of anger, and the empty grey of loneliness. She couldn't see the different colors, but they swirled and danced around Chloe's transparent figure, swerving in zigzags around and through the clouds in rainbows and auroras. They stood wavering in some places like an image on rippling water, and then began to disappear as Chloe's unhappy thoughts and feelings were washed away with the will of her powers. She felt like she was in heaven with the lightness of her soul, and the warm pink of happiness settling onto her like a fleece blanket in winter. Like a candle flame in a high wind, Chloe's troubles were temporarily gone, and she began to settle back into her solid body. Her mind was rested, and she was sinking into a sleepy state as she settled further into reality, but was instantly brought back when it all disappeared. Now, how to make Richard come to her- that was another question. She was in the horror section, so that didn't quite prove a good place for him to look first, especially with Count Dracula, Moriarty, and even Carrie White lurking around. Not to mention the Count's three vampire brides, who had come out into the courtyard before to look for their supper. As she looked on through her window view, Chloe's brain pulsed as she tried her hardest to think of something- anything that would enable her to reach Richard without leaving the tower, for someone would surely catch her if she did. But then, out in the forest beyond her tower, her eyes caught sight of a moving shadow among the trees, dancing like bats in a cave with a fiery presence among it. Who could that be? Chloe wondered. And as the shadow kept on moving within the dark trees, Chloe noticed something she hadn't before- a large orange ball with a yellow face of two eyes and a mouth glowing fiery bright. It came to her at last. The Headless Horseman, from The Legend of Sleepy Hollow ! He was waiting there for someone to come through his forest. And very soon, he might, Chloe thought, as an idea flashed brilliantly in her mind. Of course! Why didn't I think of this before? She glanced through her window view, and watched as a big, black raven swooped down over the grounds, shrieking \"Nevermore!\" repeatedly. Perhaps she couldn't get out of the tower, but that raven certainly could fly anywhere it wanted. Carefully and quietly, Chloe put her hand to the chained window doors, and, through her imagination, sent a high, squeaky sound through the wood to get the raven's attention. She was satisfied to hear the raven's squawking come closer to her, and it settled on a hook sticking out from the tower under the windowsill. Chloe planned her approach to this carefully. She'd learned in her psychology class that when trained through rewards and punishments, animals could be easily manipulated. If she was going to earn this raven's trust, she would need to give him something in return for his cooperation in carrying out her new idea. Slowly, Chloe crouched down, and using her mind, made one of the stones in the wall evaporate. She was gingerly enough to make it on the opposite side of the tower, where she was least likely to be seen. When she had done so, and repeated the squawking sound, she picked up a dead mouse she had found earlier near the fireplace, and held it ready for the raven. The raven flapped near the opening, but reacted quickly when it saw Chloe, flitting about and squawking quite loudly. Chloe cringed; she didn't think about what the big bird's reaction would be to such a surprise. Thinking quickly, she held out the dead mouse, and while the raven didn't quite stop its mad flapping, it did put its eyes on the prize. \"Hello there,\" Chloe spoke to the raven. The raven just stood in midair, looking at the mouse in her hand with eagerness. It emitted one little caw, but Chloe gave that a lopsided frown. So she decided to try something new. Maybe through her imagination, she could translate her words into what the raven could understand. Swallowing her doubt, Chloe explained the proposition she had for the raven, all the while commanding her mind to translate the words into bird tongue. It was hard to do when she was so tense about this new ability, but, from the look on its face, Chloe could tell she had success. After she finished, the raven was stagnant as it landed inside on the tower floor. But when it spotted the prize in Chloe's hand once more, it leapt about, making excited sounds, which Chloe automatically comprehended as caws of agreement. She had it! Hastily, Chloe wrote a letter to the Binding Order. She planned to finally put all stakes on the line, and invite the Binding Order, whatever they were up to, to the tower for a secret shindig. The raven would swiftly fly the letter to them- with some help from Chloe of course- and, with the Pagemaster's assistance, they would arrive at the tower, unseen by the villains. Upon arrival, they'd have a little fun party first, for Chloe to relax and explain to the Binding Order all that happened. And then, when everything was said and done, and Chloe and the Binding Order had taken Dracula and Moriarty prisoner, then they would journey back to the rotunda. And from there, they'd plan how to further cease the war. The sooner that happened, the sooner Chloe could be able to find Richard, and they both could return home. Chloe began to shake. This new idea nearly brought her out of her skin with excitement, and she felt she could scream to the heavens with her confidence in the future. She wanted to laugh loud and long, but she told herself otherwise. Her celebration, and the rest of her plan, would need to wait after a good rest in bed. And so, without knowing she did, Chloe rushed to her bed after sending the raven off with a strong wind on his tail, and threw the covers onto her restless body, to immediately go to sleep, and for once dream good dreams without many cares.[Chapter 2] Chapter 2 Firedrake's silver wings blazed high over the forest below, and as they dipped through the clouds, Peaseblossom fluttered before the enormous dragon to guide him to a safe landing. \"Look yonder!\" she cried enthusiastically. \"'Tis the whole fairy court that greets you now!\" She pointed to the crowd of people coming to the edge of the forest, every single person leaving blazing streaks of fairy dust behind them, as more and more rushed to see the giant creature closing in upon their home. As Firedrake touched down on the ground outside the forest, his wings stirred up the dust and it blew away from him in huge, puffing clouds. But as Firedrake's identity was now known, some of the fairies began to retreat into the trees, making frightened sounds and calls that which none of the newcomers could comprehend. Peaseblossom sped from her place beside Firedrake, and sent a few trails of pink sparkles flying into the woods. They zipped in between moist-looking trees, finally catching up with one another to create a wall of roses and thorns growing up from the ground, blocking the path of any fairy who tried to get away. \"Come hitherto,\" Peaseblossom repeated loudly, cupping her hands around her mouth. \"'Tis I, Peaseblossom, of the kindly Queen Titania's band of humble servants, and I come in request of a conference with His Majesty, the King.\" At this point, most of the fairies returned from out of the forest, bowing their heads respectfully at the fairy servant. \"Do not fear this dragon, friends. Firedrake possesses the kindest heart of all beasts,\" Peaseblossom explained gently. \"He shalt not harm the soul of a measly fly if given the chance. He is merely here as a member of my troupe of travelers.\" One fairy, completely dressed in grays and silvers, fluttered up from the crowd. She looked at Peaseblossom with large grey eyes, and twitched her web-like wings anxiously. \"Cobweb, kindly servant,\" Peaseblossom acknowledged her fellow servant friend, \"if thou would please bring us to our King and Queen. 'Tis of highest urgency that we make decent use of Their Majesty's magic power.\" \"The dragon,\" Cobweb said, pointing a tentative finger at Firedrake. \"King Oberon would not allow such a monstrosity within an inch of his kingdom.\" Then, she looked past Peaseblossom at the beings on Firedrake's back. Richard's head of blonde hair, windblown from their journey through the clouds, poked out from behind the dragon's scales, as well as the hopeful, excited expression of little Alice. Cobweb's face was unreadable while she observed Peaseblossom's group of travelers. Her face remained that way while she flew up to them, mostly keeping her eyes on Alice. Finally, she was able to avert her gaze to Richard, to whom she quickly curtsied. \"Good lord,\" she said, \"'tis a pleasure meeting thee again. But, who is thy friend?\" \"I'm called Alice,\" Alice said, bowing her head respectfully to the fairy. \"Alice,\" Cobweb repeated, without emotion. But her expression didn't change beyond the unrecognizable, and she looked back to Richard. \"Why must thee have a counsel with Their Majesties? They are in the worst possible of predicaments, and thy presence here is treacherous. Should His Majesty learn that a human has taken his place in this domain, the consequences are most unimaginable.\" She shook her head, as if in disappointment, locking her fingers together at her waist. \"You don't understand,\" Richard said loudly to get Cobweb's undivided attention. \"My friend, Chloe, has been taken by the villains. We need Oberon's advice on how to get to her. We think that maybe she's trapped somewhere in this section, but without his help, we might never find her before things get worse!\" Cobweb shook her head again, flying up so she was nose-to-nose with Richard. \"As I spoke before, a human's presence, accompanied by a dragon of all beasts, is dangerous. Oberon shall speak to no one of the sort, in his sort of ungodly emotion.\" \"But he's a Proverb,\" Alice tried to explain. \"The one who can make books come alive just by pointing into one of them. If the King won't speak with him, I don't know who.\" Cobweb's once-calm gaze shot back to Richard's, her grey eyes sparkling with an immense wonder she had never shown before. She looked as though she would faint from that overwhelming feeling alone. \"A Proverb, thy friend states,\" Cobweb whispered. \"It cannot be so. The other Proverbs have since been lost to the sands of time. Thy lady friend is the only one remaining in this world.\" \"No, it's the truth!\" Richard said firmly. \"Peaseblossom can tell you!\" \"And, so I shall,\" the pink fairy said, as if on cue. \"'Tis the godly power of the lord Richard, that we have come this far on our journey. Mayhap if not for his power, we might be back where we started, and young Alice would be dead at the hands of the monstrous Jabberwocky.\" \"Never mind, never mind,\" Cobweb said dismissively. \"I trust thy word, Peaseblossom. Come quickly. Make haste, while Their Majesties are still willing to lend their ears. If thou dost not hurry, even a visit from a long-lost Proverb shalt not calm their wary nerves.\" \"Good luck, to all of you,\" Firedrake said, while Richard and Alice jumped down to the ground from his gently lowered wing. He lent them a sweet smile while they followed Cobweb and Peaseblossom further into the forest. The other fairies looked on curiously, and not having heard the conversation atop Firedrake, they gazed at Richard and Alice with both disgust and wonder, at having come into their domain with such surprise. Through the woods they went, walking between so many kinds of exotic-looking trees that Richard could have filled a book with how many he saw. The land around him was enchanting. There were plants that looked like they came from a rainforest, with petals and leaves so huge and ornate they were truly otherworldly. They moved gently in a sweet-smelling breeze that came through the forest like perfume, smelling extremely natural and alluring. At last, they came to the most beautiful place Richard could ever imagine a fairy living. The sun was spotlighting in a bare spot in the tree's canopy, where two stone pillars were connected by interweaving strands of sparkling gauze. The gauze formed a sort of translucent roof over two large, grand thrones, both of which were made of stone and twigs and leaves. Flowers adorned both thrones, throwing vibrant colors across the space in the light. Peaseblossom and Cobweb's fairy dust brought even more glimmer to the thrones, and they gestured towards the two majestic beings sitting upon the thrones. \"Your Royal Majesties,\" Peaseblossom said, while she and Cobweb curtsied on the floor before the two royals. \"We have brought esteemed company into our domain, and it is our wish that thee hears their request.\" Richard blinked twice, looking between himself, Alice, and the fairies in front of him. Normally, Peaseblossom was no taller than his forearm, but suddenly, she was a petite woman just a few inches smaller than him. And the king was as tall as his own dad. How…how did that ever happen? The fairy king glanced at a confounded Richard, his eyes boring into the boy's, with the strong sunlight helping achieve such an effect. \"Good lad,\" he addressed Richard. \"Inform me of thy request.\" Richard wanted to answer him, but he was still in awe of all that was happening. His answer was on his tongue, but something different came out. \"You're…life-size!\" King Oberon was still, before a little smirk spread on his tight lips. \"Did thou not see? 'Tis the beauty of my land. Beings of all kinds come to our size when they enter the kingdom, should they ever try to overtake us by greater height.\" \"I didn't know that,\" Richard said, nodding his head. \"That's really cool.\" \"I don't pretend to comprehend the word on thy tongue,\" Oberon said sternly, still smirking at Richard. \"I merely pray that thou tell me, and my queen, what thy purpose is within our land. Humans are a breed not often welcomed here.\" \"'Tis only a boy,\" Titania said, in a kind, soothing voice. \"Mayhap he brings us news of the battling.\" \"There are much better matters at hand than that of the war,\" Oberon said harshly once again. \"I've never wanted any part of it, and should this boy ask anything of me, he is but a breadth away from harsh imprisonment.\" Peaseblossom rushed back to Richard, gently putting her hands on his shoulders, like a loving mother protecting her son. \"My king, this boy standing beside me is naught but the Proverb of the Books, sent here by the Pagemaster to lead his army to a sure victory. He has arrived merely to seek thy advice on the location of his beloved lady.\" Richard abruptly gave Peaseblossom a look. Had he not specifically told her that Chloe was not his \"beloved\"? Of all the words to describe their relationship, that was far from the truth. \"A Proverb?\" Oberon looked to his side, at Titania. \"My queen, the lad believes that he is a Proverb.\" He sneered back at Richard, and a slightly-dismayed Peaseblossom. \"Don't doubt me yet,\" Richard said, returning Oberon's mocking expression. He pointed his finger to the ground between himself and the fairy thrones, stating the first thing that popped into his mind. \" Jack and the Beanstalk, the beanstalk! \" The moment that Richard spoke the words, the dusty ground opened up to reveal a little green stalk, shooting up to the sky faster than even he had expected. Oberon watched with his mouth agape, as did Titania, who put her hand to her mouth. Richard grinned at the fairy king and queen. \"Satisfied now?\" he asked, folding his arms in anticipation of Oberon's answer. He jumped back suddenly when Oberon reached out and touched the thick beanstalk, which instantly tumbled to the ground, and disintegrated into a rotted leaf within seconds. \"A story within a book holds power enough,\" the king said, boring his eyes into Richard's. \"But that was proof enough of thy identity, though it does not hold a flame to that which I expected.\" \"I pray to thee, Majesty,\" Peaseblossom pled, standing down. \"Now that thou hast seen what thou wished, shall thee grant us our favor.\" \"On a single condition,\" Oberon stated, standing up with his hard eyes still looking down. \"That the boy shall return to this kingdom, and train as a ruthless henchman to me.\" Titania stood up, her eyes flashing hotly with anger; and for a split second, the sky seemed to speckle with the grey of coming storms. \"Thou shalt do no such thing. A Proverb is a Proverb, and thus, the boy shall return to his homeland, and thee will grant him what his heart desires. I ask this as thy queen, and as thy love!\" \"Not once in a thousand moons,\" Oberon said gruffly, sitting back down. As he spoke, clouds gathered overhead, and rain began to fall down. Titania, in a most defiant manner, stood from her throne, and stepped down to Richard. \"Pay no mind to my king,\" she said gently, leading him away from the throne space. \"His temper is short enough to match that of a candle wick. I, on the other end, shall help thee to the best of my ability.\" Peaseblossom followed Titania and Richard away from Oberon, while Cobweb stayed behind. \"Thanks goes most graciously to thee, Titania,\" she said, grinning widely. \"Any comrade of the Pagemaster is a comrade of mine,\" Titania stated surely. \"Particularly if said friend is a Proverb who seeks another.\" Titania finally stopped, where she and Richard and Peaseblossom were in the middle of the trees, out of sight of the thrones. \"Shouldn't you have a cauldron or a spell book?\" Richard wanted to know, although he somehow felt a fairy queen wouldn't need a spell book to do magic. \"For what I shall perform, I already know by heart,\" Titania said, taking Richard's hands in hers. She opened up Richard's hands so that they were cupped upward, as if to receive something. Then she pinched two fingers together, and sprinkled a kind of magic dust into his palm, which tickled his skin sweetly. \"Remember her appearance,\" Titania commanded softly. Richard bit his lip, and forced everything he could remember about Chloe into Titania's magic spell. Her red hair, her large green eyes, and porcelain skin were what immediately popped into his mind. Then came the fierceness when she was practicing archery with Robin Hood, and the dreaminess in her eyes when she read… For moments, Richard found himself rambling in his mind about Chloe, and the more he did, the brighter the fairy queen's spell glowed. \"Stop!\" Titania said, \"that's good enough!\" Richard shook his head to stop the train of thought, and turned his gaze to the vision inside his cupped palms. He saw a head of strawberry hair, flowing on top of a beautiful dress, though tattered from wear. The surroundings were homey enough, but the walls were made of bare, cold stones. The head turned around, resting on a pillow under a thick tulle canopy. For a moment, Richard could have mistaken her for Sleeping Beauty, as she was asleep on an ornate bed made for a royal. But Richard would know that face anywhere. \"That's Chloe!\" he exclaimed. Titania nodded. \"As thou pictures her to be, and I show thee where the lady sleeps,\" she explained, pulling her hand above the vision. While she did, the picture panned out, through a window, revealing a large stone tower standing inside a great decaying castle. In the background, grey clouds spanned the sky, scratching across a great white moon. Dead leaves flew here and there, and to Richard, the image suddenly turned horrifying. \"That's not the fantasy section,\" he murmured under his breath. \"Mayhap it's the horror section,\" Titania finished. The horrible fact dawned on Richard, and he stepped back from Titania, the vision disappearing from his hands as he did so. He couldn't believe it. All this time, he had been on the wrong track, losing considerable amounts of time just blindly trying to find her! But…why the horror section? There would have been a much greater advantage to the villains had they been here, where magic and wickedness was as abundant as fairy tales. But then, evil ran amuck in horror, and as far as Richard remembered, villains could also easily be powerful in that section, maybe even more so. In any case, he now knew where Chloe was. And they would have to get there quickly, before any more time was lost, and before some masterful villain took her into his clutches.[Chapter 3] Chapter 3 The hours passed quickly, and Chloe dreamt pleasant dreams, excited for her party. She knew this would be a good thing for her- a chance to unwind and have some fun, while, if her plans worked, temporarily safe from wicked eyes watching her. She made sure, in the meantime, to save enough energy to conjure something to distract Dracula and all his evil cohorts, long enough for her party to go on, and then for her and the Binding Order to escape invisibly. Chloe had slept long through that night, and then all throughout the next day in naps, so that when she was wide awake, the sun was setting in the afternoon sky behind its usual veil of dark clouds. And with long hours of rest behind her, she was ready to prepare. Excitement was shaking her enough so that she could barely stand upright, but Chloe's determination to accomplish her task held her like a cement wall. With a clear mind, she stood before her room, and prepared to turn the dank prison into a party haven. Concentrating with all heart and mind, she pictured table after table of cakes, caramel apples, sandwiches and sweet treats of all kinds. The center of the room became a dance floor of polished wood, jack-o-lanterns lighting every corner, and dimmed candles illuminating every table. She had one more thing to do. Chloe imagined her view through the closed window, and searched for Dracula circling the tower. And indeed, he came flying around the corner, softly squeaking in his bat form while he furiously flapped his wings. His red bat eyes showed no sign of suspicion, and Chloe grinned in satisfaction. This next step was going to be part of sweet revenge, a punishment for being such a pest to her. Chloe then shut her eyes, imagining every single space of every room of the castle, to be filled with piles upon piles of salt crystals. They filled every closet, every chest, and every drawer and space he could walk on. With all that salt, he would be doomed to spend who knows how long counting them until they were all accounted for- every last grain! Chloe relaxed the images of salt, and then pushed her vision towards Moriarty, stationed at his post inside the castle library, watching through a little circular window. Even from here, she could see the subtle nefariousness projecting from his expression onto the glass, and though it made her heart beat faster, she wouldn't let herself be afraid. Chloe's eyes scanned the library, and at one end of it, she saw the great oak doors, closed, but probably not locked. Keeping her wide grin, Chloe flexed her imagination, and with a humongous crashing sound inside the walls, heavy cement walls formed at the doors and the window. Of course, she couldn't hear anything beyond the thick walls, but Chloe could picture Moriarty yelling in defeat, and she chuckled at the thought. Finally, Chloe turned her head, and her vision, to Carrie's window. Using the same technique, another tall, wide wall stacked itself to block the view out the window. Carrie's eyes were widening, but they didn't do so until before the last cinder block stacked itself, trapping her there. Chloe loosened her hold on the imaginary view with mischievous satisfaction. It was done. It was finally done. Everyone was out of her way, and now she would just have to wait for the raven to return, and her guests to start arriving! Until then, Chloe sat at the window, waiting and watching- until twilight, when the moon soon began to etch shadows onto the Headless Horseman's forest. The dins of the night began to sound, and Chloe's anxiousness built immensely, showing itself on her sparkling eyes. Then, finally, when it got dark enough, Chloe stood away from the window, and in a daring move, aimed her imagination directly at the chains in the doors. She had been warned not to unchain the window doors, otherwise she actually would be disposed of in the worst way possible. But tonight, what could stop her, with the Binding Order soon to be close? She jolted her mind, and within seconds, the chains holding the doors shut started to glow a bright red, then orange, and finally a flaming hot yellow. The metal began to bend, caving in on itself, and like melting ice, the links fell apart, clanging to the floor where her mind's power made them evaporate into thin air. Free at last, a dank wind blew the window doors open, and fresh air rolled into the room like air conditioning in the hottest of summers. Chloe rushed to the window, and a real, clear view met her eyes blissfully. Although she wasn't seeing much of anything new, it felt good to breathe the open air again. But then, something caught her gaze inside the thick forest. A flash of light cut through the trees, and for a moment, she feared that maybe Dracula was appearing outside his castle. Immediately, Chloe hurried to prepare her mind to fix the window, in case he had actually fallen for her trick. Her heart smashing against her chest, Chloe kept her mind open, ready for the coming obstacle that may just destroy all hope of escape. But, it wasn't a bloodthirsty vampire she saw begin to emerge from the forest. The gentle orange glow of lanterns and candles glimmered in the dimness, flames dancing to and fro between the rotted branches. Chloe rose from her seat and bent her head out into the air, hoping for the passerby to be those she had been waiting to greet. And just as the lanterns became clear, and the strangers gathered outside the trees, Chloe's gasp of excitement was matched by the caw of the raven, soaring through the sky overhead. Reaching her hand out the window, Chloe waved excitedly to the crowd, which began to scuttle closer to the tower with a mix of eagerness and urgency. The more the crowd dispersed, the more Chloe observed the size of the array. Not a single member of the Binding Order was missed here; they all had answered her call, and each member was dressed casually to have a fun time. Most, however, also brought their weapons. \"Lady Chloe!\" a voice called up to the tower. Chloe yanked her gaze downwards, where she caught the source of the voice. At the head of the voice, a young man in black and blue slacks stood, waving up at the window. \"Sir Hugo!\" Chloe exclaimed, waving back. \"You came too!\" Her call was followed a barking, and right beside Sir Hugo, a big fluffy dog with long golden fur looked upwards at the window. \"Jip!\" Chloe called down. \"Oh, it's so wonderful to see you too!\" \"The same to you, m'lady!\" Jip said, respectfully lowering his head, although he looked like he could jump up and down in his happiness at seeing his friend again. Briefly, Chloe waved to the rest of the Order, before planting her hands firmly on the windowsill. Her energy instantly renewed, she shut her eyes and imagined a staircase leading up to the tower. As it appeared, Chloe leaned further out the window, and her long red hair, having grown much longer in the weeks spent in the tower, flowed down the wall like Rapunzel's, shimmering in the ivory moonlight that peaked just enough from the clouds to spotlight her. At the top of the stairs, Chloe reached out her hand to help her guests climb inside, and while doing so, conjured up a band of musical instruments to begin playing a joyful song that inspired a happy mood among the partygoers. Chloe breathed hard to keep up with all the people she was pulling in, but was glad to see every one of them. Finally, all of the Binding Order was up inside the tower room. While often a group of serious men, Chloe noticed that the Order was also keen on fun on occasion. For once inside, most of them went to the tables piled high with food, and helped themselves plentifully. Some dispersed into groups, talking among one another, while the rest stayed at the tables surrounding the perimeter of the room, munching on sweet cakes, chocolate-covered strawberries, and crackers and pound cake with fondue. But no merry sound could overthrow the harmonies of the fiddles and drums, playing magically by themselves in the corner. It made Chloe smile to see everything going so smoothly, and for several moments, she was caught in absorbing the sights of the Binding Order all here, to take pleasure in this revelry, and even the idea of them helping her escape later. In a minute, Chloe was pulled out of her reverie when Sir Hugo approached her, bowing low and extending his hand to her. \"Shall I be the first to have a dance with the hostess?\" he asked in a sweet, sincere manner. Chloe shrugged, and following Sir Hugo's path of etiquette, simply curtsied and took her position to begin their little dance. Sir Hugo then proceeded to lead her into the fray of partygoers, startling her somewhat with his ability. Sir Hugo prided himself upon his fighting skills, but he was never one to pass the opportunity to dance with a fellow lady, especially one lady as esteemed as Chloe. And when she started to dance, Chloe's mind wandered to what she heard her classmates say about the fun of school dances, like Homecoming or Prom. She wondered if this was what they were like; having good friends, and then dancing time away, whether anyone cared about looking silly in front of everyone despite the fun they were having. Friends… Speaking of friends, where in the world was Richard? Well, for all she knew, he was off fighting some dragon or defending the literary kingdom from one danger after another, not thinking of her at all. But all too instantly, she felt pretty sorrowful not being able to bring him here too, to complete the group. And unfortunately, that miserable thought caused her to misstep, crushing her Sir Hugo's foot. He winced for a fraction of a second, but couldn't manage to frown at Chloe, who gave him an apologetic smile. Chloe took a deep breath, before the unexpected happened. Her mind switched gears, from dancing, to Richard, and now to a new daydream that began to feel, in the slightest, very real. She could feel fluffiness beneath her feet, and warmth on her back, like summer sun. The texture of Sir Hugo's hands turned smooth as velvet, and the tower room suddenly seemed so much brighter, as though it were at the height of afternoon. And from behind Sir Hugo, the room seemed to change from the silver glint of stone walls to the pure buttery yellow of sunglow. The sunlight glittered, sparkling brighter and brighter and spreading like spilled diamonds around Chloe, as she witnessed this vision become reality. The diamonds were falling all around her, hissing in a melodic sound as they danced in swirling patterns, like snowflakes on a winter breeze. And through them, Chloe let go of Sir Hugo's hands, breaking herself from the crowd as she let herself go altogether. The sparkles had made a little wall between her and the rest of the guests, and so she had begun to twirl and swirl like there was nothing but her and that space; the rest of the world gone. Still, she didn't stop the dreaming. Her old dress was becoming ragged and dirty from the weeks spent in the tower, so she fashioned herself a new one through her mind's eye- one with satins and silks and velvet-lined shoes. Chloe then found herself stepping into the clean new shoes, and some ribbons swirled their way up her red tendrils, fastening themselves at the crown of her head. With the tender rustling of her hair, Chloe felt even more relaxed, but her feet kept on dancing across the floor… \"Chloe?\" At the sound of the voice echoing through her ears, Chloe stopped her twirling, and the little sparkles she conjured stopped swirling and evaporated into thin air. She turned to find the voice. Her breathing stopped the second she recognized the face, and although she wanted to scream for joy and shout out the window her excitement and rejoice, all she could do was stand there, letting the those sea blue eyes sink in and leave their mark on her heart. After weeks of not seeing them, she felt she would never be able to let them out of her sight. Never.[Chapter 4] Chapter 4 Richard chuckled with a smile at Chloe, seeming to return the motion of never stopping to look somewhere other than in her grass-green eyes, and she giggled back as he made his way through the staring crowd to greet her. \"Oh, my god, I…can't…can't…\" Everything inside of Chloe abruptly stopped, so great was her disbelief at seeing him here. \"I just can't believe…that you're here at last!\" Her breath was continuing to sputter excitedly out of her, and it took all of her strength to not throw her arms around him and not ever allow him freedom again. Richard returned Chloe's surprised stare, but then slowly smiled like he was about to laugh, and shook his head in joyous disbelief. \"I told my friends we'd find you, and, well…I just…oh my god, I just don't believe it!\" \"I know!\" Chloe agreed. \"It's crazy and still so great! I missed you a lot.\" \"Yeah, me too,\" Richard said. For a moment it was silent between them, like they didn't know what their next step was. Chloe was waiting to see if she would allow herself to hug Richard, but he was looking her over instead. \"That was…that was pretty magnificent,\" he said at last, gesturing at Chloe's new, elegant dress. \"Did you get a fairy godmother while you were here?\" \"No, but maybe I should fill in an application to be one myself,\" Chloe replied with a light chuckle. Chuckling as well, Richard reached to grasp Chloe's hands, relief washing over him. \"Thank god you're safe,\" he said. \"I thought maybe you were gone for good.\" \"Well, I would never try to stay far away forever,\" Chloe said matter-of-factly, and she smiled deeply to show her joy, although there were gallons more beneath the surface, which was hard to hide. \"You okay, Chloe?\" Richard asked, noticing Chloe's mouth twitching slightly at the corners in trying to hide her joy. \"Yes, I'm fine, but- but I cannot even begin to tell you how glad I am to see you again. I've been very lonely without you.\" \"Same here.\" They were both silent again before Chloe's immense happiness gave way and she began to cry. Her happiness driving her on, she put her arms around Richard's neck, resting her chin on his shoulder. \"If I should ever leave your sight again, I swear to god…\" \"No, Chloe!\" Richard said, pulling her away so they could see each other face-to-face. \"We're going to be fine! They'll never touch you again! Not while the Pagemaster and I are around.\" Chloe faced Richard with a fixed look. \"Let me finish, Rich,\" she said. \"If you die in battle, I will die too! I swear on the pages this world is written that I will.\" Richard jumped back a step, still keeping his hands on Chloe firmly. \"You won't! No, you won't!\" he said sternly. \"I'm not going to let you do anything stupid like that!\" They stared tensely at each other, the only sound being their breathing. Chloe finally took a breath and stared much harder at Richard. \"Look, if you ask me to do anything, I will do it,\" she said. \"But that does not include me not standing in your way!\" \"And you won't! Chloe, you're part of the Binding Order. I won't let you die!\" \"And neither will I!\" Chloe exhaled deeply, and bore her gaze into Richard. \"All right, this is how we will do this. The two of us will fight in battle beside the Pagemaster and the Binding Order, no matter what. But you cannot tell me I can't do anything for the good of this world. If the both of us don't fight, then the literary world will disappear forever! Do you think we were given our powers for no real reason?\" Richard sighed, folding his lips between his teeth in defeat. \"Okay, then. We both will fight as best we can. But please, please, please Chloe, don't do anything drastic!\" \"And in return, you will promise me you will have a good time before we leave here tonight,\" Chloe said, putting a hand on Richard's shoulder, and eyeing him like an eagle to a salmon. In reply, Richard didn't say anything, but scanned his eyes downward once more on Chloe's new dress. It was blazing silver, much like the sparkles that had conjured it, and cascaded down her legs in ruffling waterfalls of silver and white satin, with a low ovular neck that spanned her shoulders in long sleeves with pointed ends. White ribbons were tied together at the crown of her head to make a little tiara, where the long ends dangled fluidly from her head to the middle of her back, where her red hair ended. To say the truth, Richard found it hard to look away from this display of beauty and magic. True, he had seen enough magic to last many years, but this was the icing on the cake. \"Wow, you look, well, remarkable!\" Richard said, chuckling awkwardly. Chloe half-smiled and smoothed her skirts modestly. But something else popped into his head in the meantime. \"You want to meet my friends?\" he asked. \"They're still outside the tower.\" When Chloe nodded, Richard pointed out the window behind him to Firedrake, Alice, and Peaseblossom, standing just outside the forest. All three of them smiled back at Richard and Chloe, who waved back a little tentatively, but she soon grew a smile. \"Come on over!\" Chloe called, gesturing inside the tower. \"There's plenty of room for all of you.\" Looking back at Alice and Peaseblossom, Firedrake inched closer to the tower, and with his nose, allowed for the other two to cross in through the window. Alice was the first to climb in through, with Peaseblossom fluttering in right behind her. \"Hello, there,\" Chloe said, looking down at Alice from Peaseblossom. \"I'm Chloe, Richard's friend. What's your name?\" \"I'm Alice,\" Alice replied, curtsying sweetly. \"Wow. I daresay Richard was right about you. You really are beautiful.\" Chloe looked at Richard with a semi-shocked grin, on the verge of laughter. \"You said that?\" \"Okay, I might have said something like that,\" he admitted. \"Yes,\" Alice added. \"He also said that you can imagine things to life.\" Chloe nodded. \"I can, but I myself never imagined any of you would show up here. Well, I can say that I've been spared lots more time trying to find you. You even brought us a ride back to the rotunda!\" Richard glanced at Firedrake, who was keeping his head close to the window. \"Well, if the whole Binding Order can ride on Firedrake's back,\" he said with a shrug. \"Firedrake? Is that your name?\" Chloe asked the dragon. Firedrake nodded. \"And can I tell you how good it is to finally meet you?\" he said. \"The way Richard talked about you, I truly expected a wonderful young woman. And that, you certainly are.\" \"Thanks, to all of you,\" Chloe said, looking between her unexpected guests. \"It's great to see you all here, and I'm more than happy to have you stay for the fun.\" \"You will?\" Alice asked, half surprised and half excited. \"Why not?\" Chloe said. \"Let's go dance.\" Richard swallowed hard. Dancing, for him? Well, that was debatable, but for Chloe, he supposed he could try. Alice and Peaseblossom followed Chloe to the center of the dance floor, where, as Chloe began to move to the beat, Alice twirled around, and Peaseblossom just hovered in midair, moving to her own rhythm. Following them, Richard concentrated on what the others were doing for the so-called dance. Lots were just moving their feet to the beat, while others were simply snapping their fingers rhythmically, with the clip-clop of shoes being just a whisper under the fiddling and drumming. Okay, I guess that's nothing. Just go with it , he told himself . Over and over, Richard urged himself to take the first step, which was simply to get into the music and develop a sense of rhythm. But that was easier to think about, instead of doing. His natural rhythm was in baseball or studying, not dancing. Oddly enough, he'd never been to a homecoming or turnabout dance in his high school years; he refused to go. But in stepping out, Alice took his hands, and twirled around with him. Richard let out a surprised cry as he was swept away by his little friend, but in being gently twirled around, he slowly grew comfortable with moving around to the music, even if it was slightly off with Alice's gleeful dancing. She giggled at Richard's reaction, and laughed along with him as he grew into this dance, just barely coming over the happy barking of Jip, who jumped around the whirling couple excitedly. Other Order members soon recognized the other Proverb, and, also recognizing his energetic partner, created a little circle around Richard and Alice. They began clapping, to the arrival of their comrade, and to the vivacious energy of the music. Chloe laughed watching Richard dance with Alice, and she stepped inside the circle too, taking Peaseblossom with her. The little fairy flew around the circle, casting halos of fairy dust over the dancers, and the Binding Order cheered, celebrating their Proverbs, and their new friends. Jip barked along with them, soon charging into the circle, where Alice met him with a hug, and Jip met her with a lick on her face. When the fairy dust settled, the Order joined their leaders, and soon, every person there was dancing to their lead, who were all laughing till their stomachs hurt. They were having so much fun, that Chloe's mind had completely forgotten the next real purpose of this gathering, and the night was almost over. When Chloe could finally notice how high the moon had gotten, she dashed to the window, and squinted down at Dracula's castle. The windows were still alight, but she didn't see anyone wandering around. Still her heart began to drum hard; who knew how much of the salt grains the Count had gotten through. The moment this question struck her, Chloe threw herself towards the front of the room, and to get everyone's attention, zapped away the magical instruments. All became almost completely silent. \"Listen up everyone! Listen up! The night is almost over, and I think maybe we've partied long enough. We have to get out of here now!\" \"Right now?\" Richard seemed slightly confused by Chloe's immediate haste. \"Count Dracula! He might catch us if we don't get out while we have the chance to. Look, Richard, I'll explain this to you while we are getting out of here, but we must do it right this moment!\" \"Who is Count Dracula?\" Alice wondered out loud. \"Quite a curious name.\" \"Just hope you never have to find out,\" Richard told her as he took her hand to lead her out with him and the others. Under the helpful leadership of Sir Hugo, everyone followed him and Chloe to the window, as she shut her eyes to make the party disappear, and the ladder reappear. It came as ghastly white, but was solidly tangible enough for someone to climb. Chloe reached over by her bed, and grabbed her blue-and-silver cloak, fastening it around her neck. In her hands she grasped her bow and arrows and slung them around her back, before picking up her skirts to climb out the window. Slowly, she took the first rung and began to climb down, her friends close behind her.[Chapter 5] Chapter 5 In the cold night air, Chloe shivered through her cloak. Her fear was creeping up on her, making it difficult to hang onto the ladder. To keep her fear at bay, she kept her eyes on the ladder and her mind open in case of a power emergency. Richard kept his sword at his side, clutched in its sheath, with his other hand kept up to hold Alice steady on her feet. At last they reached the bottom of the ladder, and with the Binding Order leading them, they prepared to make their way through the never-ending woods. Some members were quick to judge when they saw Firedrake, but after a brief explanation, the great creature was respectfully greeted, and everyone proceeded to climb aboard his back, going in two single file rows extending to the start of Firedrake's long tail. They were just about to take off, when a voice, menacing and ominous as thunder, sounded. Chloe held fast to Richard, who jumped also; the rest of the Binding Order unsheathed their weapons when they heard it. Not too far from the group atop the dragon, stood a large, muscular man dressed in a black swirling cloak, perched atop a wild-looking black horse, whose eyes locked on them with a superior mischief. Chloe choked when she noticed that clutched to the man's side, was a wide sheath containing a huge sword, and even a round pumpkin, with a wicked face carved into the tender skin. And then atop his shoulders, was something that made everyone in the bunch's blood run cold. There was nothing atop his shoulder; a headless horseman. The Headless Horseman. \"Where? Where to?\" the ghostly man asked, his voice coming from nowhere. For a moment, no one said anything, not even Firedrake, who only seemed to try to keep from belching up impromptu flames. Alice hid behind Richard, clutching his cape, suppressing a scream of surprise at seeing the monstrous man. \"Too late!\" the Headless Horseman cackled maniacally, swinging his pumpkin head above his bare shoulders, and unsheathing his demonic weapon, charging towards them with his huge sword brandished like a weapon of ultimate destruction. Sir Hugo leapt from his place and met the Horseman with a blow with his own sword. Both weapons clashed loudly, and that seemed a signal for the other Order members to attack. They jumped off of Firedrake, giving cries of battle while they heaved their own swords above their heads. Richard and Chloe followed the Order, preparing their own weapons swiftly. Alice stayed on top of Firedrake, who, reared up his head, and roared, long and loud at the enemy closing in on their little army. Even with the Binding Order advancing upon him, the Headless Horseman's horse stayed steady and strong, emitting a whinny loud as a steam whistle, and the man called out towards the castle, as if sounding an alarm. Within seconds, every corner of the grounds was surrounded by the pounding of thousands of tiny pairs of feet. The red wizards that had kidnapped Chloe charged into the fight, brandishing weapons so formidable, the Horseman's weapon resembled a measly toothpick, and coming rapidly a cheetah, yelling as loud as Firedrake's roar. \"Let's go!\" Chloe cried, raising her bow to attack, and Richard swung his sword alongside her. The two Proverbs ran like the winds at the Headless Horseman's alarming call, with the drive to put the entire expanse of red wizards in the dirt! And with the same speed, their enemies charged at them, merging together like two deathly waves of danger. Chloe released her bow, and her arrow zipped through the air, into one red wizard's chest. He fell, but was only one of thousands it seemed. And they only came faster as she readied another arrow, releasing it into the battle. Richard's blade clanged violently against one wizard's sword, that which was large and spiked to a thorny point. But he wasn't too afraid of said blade. Just from looking at them, he immediately recognized them as the wicked beings that had kidnapped Chloe. The angry flare of energy that seared through him only forced his sword faster through the fighting, but the enemy would not retreat in sight of that. They only fought stronger. Richard swung his sword through the air, but before the tip of his blade could tear through the red wizard's heart, an arrow zipped through the air and got him in the back, bringing him to the ground. From nearby, Chloe grinned triumphantly. \"Nice shot!\" Richard called back through his battling. \"Thanks!\" Chloe shouted, shooting another fast arrow. Richard breathed quickly as he swung his sword to and fro in front of him. He couldn't believe how long it had been since the last time he'd actually sword-fought. His arm was getting tired as he dodged each blow he was given, and the red wizards seemed to be using a lot more magic every time they advanced on the Order. Maybe now it was time to fight fire with fire. His brain reeling speedily, Richard sucked in a breath to speak, \" Arthurian legends, the power of Excalibur!\" and lickety-split, his sword caught a warm glow, beginning to illuminate itself with a powerful lightning, sparking and pulsing with electricity. The power increase was incredible, and Richard could feel the blow it took to the red wizard as he struck down with all his might. And when he pulled his sword from the fallen wizard, he instantly felt his energy rise, the adrenaline rushing like hot fire through him. \"The boy is a Proverb!\" he heard some red wizards shout. \"Attack him now!\" But Richard was ready. He lifted his sword high, and swung it in a three-sixty to attack a full range of red wizards that advanced on him. And at that point, any survivors of the attack were taken down by Chloe's imagination-enhanced arrows. For the moment, it seemed like they were winning this battle. But just when both Richard and Chloe were taking down another group of wizards, the Headless Horseman, clearly struggling against Sir Hugo and Jip's brilliant teamwork, was calling out another alarm. But what else could they have besides these guys? Richard wanted to know. The remaining red wizards were now outnumbered by the Binding Order, and the only other weapon they could call out was another bunch of unskilled villains without weapons. For several seconds, nothing happened except for the continuous clash of the red wizards against the Order, the wizards' great powers flashing up into the sky in a rage of evil magic. But then, from overhead, there came a thunderous rumble, and large black clouds began to appear in the dim sky against the bright moon, becoming larger and larger with every millisecond. Everyone on the field could see them coming, but now, fighting the red wizards seemed more important than two-ton boulders hurtling towards them. With the thundering of the boulders ringing through his mind, Richard found himself struggling to think of something to stop them, and also to increase his fighting power against the enemy. But with his heart pounding against the agonizing power of the falling boulders, it was nearly impossible to do so. \"Chloe!\" was all he could shout out, while his blade clanged as loudly as he was calling out. Before even Chloe could react, an even greater roar shook the air, and the blasting heat of fire radiated off of Richard's already blazing sword. At feeling the heat, he ducked down, just in time to dodge one red wizard's deadly swing. And when he did, Richard flung out his leg and tripped the wizard, momentarily pivoting his sword out to end the wizard's life. The heat however, was hastily increasing, and Richard could already feel his hair plastering itself to his forehead. Bravely, he looked upward, and saw a powerful wave of fire flashing across the sky, hot enough to melt the rocks before they could reach the ground. To one side of the fire wave, Firedrake's eyes were shut tight, blowing out the flames with every ounce of strength he had, his claws meanwhile swiping out in every direction, to fend off the wizards that tried to attack him; Peaseblossom was putting her fairy magic into helping Firedrake, her touch turning some of his scales a bright pink with good magic. The wizards' plan was being foiled, and they were trying their very best to defeat the great dragon, but to no success. On Firedrake's back, Alice was clinging for dear life to the dragon's long neck, her face digging in so as not to watch the violence happening around her. At this point, her once crisp, clean clothes were now tattered and dirty from the explosions and flying debris zipping like bullets around her. As she looked up quickly, her face was damp, her eyes red. Richard flung his gaze to her, and saw her crying into Firedrake's neck, and all the while, a red wizard was starting to climb up on Firedrake's back, sword drawn. Richard blinked his eyes twice, and gasped from the bottom of his airless lungs. Alice was in danger! Swinging his blade once at his attacker, he flicked his hand downward, shouting, \" Arabian Nights, a flying carpet!\" , and just as he commanded it so, a plain flying carpet scooped him up from the ground, and he soared over the sea of battles and falling soldiers. His sword drawn in one hand, Richard extended his other out to the air, as he swooped down over Firedrake's back, coming in close proximity to the red wizard, who was preparing to bring his deathly blade down on the unknowing Alice. Coming closer at the last second, Richard screamed out to Alice, and he plucked her from Firedrake's back just as the wizard struck down, leaving a tiny cut in the dragon's back. But as Richard flew, he jolted his body to the side, and the carpet swerved in that direction, almost bucking him off in the process. Still he held fast, grasping a surprised Alice in his hands. \"Thank you, Richard!\" Alice said, clinging to him like flypaper. \"Hold on, Alice!\" Richard yelled. \"This could get nasty! Look away!\" Holding out his sword further, Richard dipped down with the carpet to maneuver the sharp blade along every red wizard he could touch. Several were killed in the flight, while others were only just harmed, but Richard was doing wonderfully alongside the rest of the Binding Order and Chloe's magnificent arrows. But suddenly, something snagged onto the carpet, and both Richard and Alice fell forward from it, tumbling in rolling balls through the grass. It was a long moment before they came to rest a few feet near the forest. Before Richard could register what happened, he found himself sitting right beside Sir Hugo, who quickly pulled him to his feet. \"Richard!\" he said, \"go now! Bring Chloe and Alice with you! It's too dangerous here for you to keep fighting, and you must get back to the Pagemaster! Tell him what you have seen and also to quickly prepare for battle! These villains won't give up without a real war!\" Richard nodded his head, straining his brain to remember such urgent news after such a fall, but Sir Hugo dragged him to his feet. \"Quickly!\" he shouted. \"Fetch Chloe, and get out of here safely! Take care of each other, and Godspeed to you!\" With that, he charged back into the fight, swinging his sword fast. Richard shook his head to clear his senses, and Alice stepped up beside him, nervous. Breathing slowly and evenly, Richard absorbed Sir Hugo's orders, and, with a brave command to his voice, re-summoned the flying carpet. \"Stay here, Alice, and don't move!\" was all he said before taking off again. And into the sky he flew, swerving back down at last to pluck Chloe from her spot. Flying back to the forest, they retrieved Alice, soaring deep into the forest where they couldn't be seen. Chloe breathed heavily, leaning on Richard for support. \"Tough battle,\" she muttered between breaths. \"We can't stay here,\" Richard told her. \"I'll tell you why later.\" He reached and took Alice's hand, turned, and then started to lead his two friends deeper into the forest, leaving the castle and the tower behind them completely. But luck had taken a turn for the worse. The forest was full of tumbling branches and rotting roots sticking from the ground, tearing the trio's scratched flesh and ruined clothes, slowing them down even more. Many times, they forced glances behind them, hoping to see the castle far behind them. But one final time, when they looked back, a dark figure began to loom over the clearing's opening, while the thunderous sound of clip-clopping came around to their ears. \"Quick, behind that tree!\" Richard said, pulling Chloe and Alice behind a thick, rotting trunk. He held them close, squeezing uncomfortably to fit the width of the tree. The sounds of clomping hooves and scratching footsteps echoed through the forest, but they were no louder than the hammering of Richard's heart. A twig snapped from underneath them, and the trio gasped loudly. The clip-clopping and footsteps stopped altogether. \"They're there!\" a low, female voice murmured. \"Seize them,\" another voice said, calm and centered, yet sinister all around. Richard's heart nearly leapt out of his skin, and suddenly, he tried to summon a kind of book that might help them. Luckily, Chloe beat him to it. She leapt from their hiding place and closed her eyes, her imagination jolting to life. The earth then began to crumble and crack apart in separate pieces like brittle glass, and under Chloe's powerful influence, their attackers began to stumble into the crackling dirt, but they were able to leap across just in time to see the whole of the ground fall apart into nothingness. And just as suddenly as Chloe had imagined the crumbling earth, she and her friends were pushed backward into their tree, by a strong, invisible force. The blow on them was incredible, and for a moment, they all thought they would fall down into unconsciousness. But they were only able to look up to see their attackers advancing on them, if only a little. One of the attackers, dressed all in black, with a face as contorted and angry as a thunderstorm, took a step forward. \"What are you doing out here, my lady?\" Count Dracula said his voice loud in their ears. \"You should be in your tower, and not out in these woods with these intruders!\" His voice was ridden with disgust, his black eyes full of hidden fury. \"Is it truly necessary to answer that?\" Chloe said, her chest banging with fear. Count Dracula half-smiled. \"No,\" he said in a low voice. \"One thing I ask. Do not move from where you are, unless your life holds any value to you.\" Behind him, Carrie half-smiled from under her blood-stained mask of a face, looking at Chloe with a slyness no one ever saw in her before. Richard tightened his grip on Chloe, pulling her closer to him, alongside a trembling Alice. He knew Dracula's powers, but they couldn't be any more powerful than Chloe's. \"Do something again!\" he whispered to Chloe. \"Use your power now!\" Chloe didn't reply. Dracula's eyes were locked onto hers, never looking away. He raised a hand in her direction, as though beckoning genuinely to her, but far from it. He pursed his colorless lips and extended his fingers. \"Come. Come to me,\" he intoned wickedly, with a lie on his dead soul. Chloe's body went stone cold, and she began to inch away from Richard's grasp. Richard held tight to her, his body icing over with fright as he realized what was happening. But no matter how hard he restrained her, she was already out of his hands. She mechanically began to walk away, completely under Dracula's control; Carrie, looking wide-eyed at Chloe, kept very still, her body tense with a mysterious force coursing through her. And when Carrie tensed, Chloe seemed to move into Dracula's hands even faster, moving not like she was walking, but like she were being carried on a quick gust of air towards her wicked captors. Instantly, Richard knew it was up to him to do something. Chloe would never listen to him under Dracula's command. But there had to be a book, any book with a burst of light, which if he had read correctly, would bring around the disappearance of any vampire. Without any ideas, Richard clasped his hands to his scalp. This was not the right time to be thinking without result. Within that instant, it came to Richard, knowing just what he had to do. He extended his hand, his mind and lips simultaneously shouting out the words, \" Swan Lake ballet, the light of dawn!\" Instantly, the sun's powerful light was unleashed with a shocking haste onto the oblivious Count Dracula. And no sooner had the light come, did he begin to writhe and groan at the pain brought upon his tender eyes. His control over Chloe was immediately broken, and she fell to the ground in surprise, her arrows clicking against her bow. Quickly, she regained her footing and ran with Richard and Alice deeper into the woods, away from the dastardly Count. In her head, Chloe kept the light from inside Richard's book illuminating the forest, blinding their captors enough that they could leave them out of sight for many more minutes.[Chapter 6] Chapter 6 At last, the three had gotten away, stopping for a few moments in the trees. They could only slightly see the light from the book, still streaming through the trees in individual rays. Chloe concentrated to keep the light going despite her lingering fear that their captors would still try to find them. Richard took Chloe and leaned against the tree, holding her close beside him. Chloe breathed hard with her fear and tire, staying very still against Richard while she nervously looked down at Alice, who returned her expression of uncertainty. \"Are they gone?\" Alice asked, her voice barely above a whisper. \"Yeah,\" Richard replied, unwrapping his cape from around his shoulders lightly. Easing away from the tree, he led his friends further into the woods, hoping against hope nothing more would happen to them. They walked steadily, holding hands tentatively, while also flicking their eyes about to watch the trees keeping stiff as a dark landscape painting in the dank air. The forest remained a bumpy ride of moss and rocks, causing big missteps often. But while all this was a still and tranquil appearance, Chloe couldn't shake the feeling something was coming. Woods like these always held some kind of ill fate for those who went through it. There was usually something hiding behind the trees, or in the air watching. Chloe swallowed hard every time she heard a snapping twig or an animal scurrying between the branches, while Richard did his best to stay still and calm as they went through on their new journey. For a long time, that was all that happened. They moved slowly through the woods, dodging poisonous-looking plants and moving among the thick groves of mossy trees and thorny brush that sprouted up on either side of them. Still, Chloe was sure to keep her mind open in case anything actually happened, and she certainly hoped Richard was doing the same. And indeed he was. Richard was turning his head in each direction every few minutes to be sure there were no problems arousing. And just as often he was listing names of books to be sure he would know what to do. He, in a way, was reminded of when he could list every statistic known to mankind. They were his life, it seemed, in those days. He wondered what percentage, if there was one, of people got killed in forests every year by unidentified objects or animals. Very few, he hoped, because this was an exception to the ordinary. Soon, as Richard was listing his books, he noticed a thin sliver of light cutting through the darkness at the far end of the forest. \"Do you see that, guys?\" he asked. \"We're almost there.\" \"How wonderful!\" Alice exclaimed, letting go of Richard's hand and racing to the edge of the woods. Her footsteps thundered gently on the woodsy floor, and her little silhouette grew hazier the further she went. Chloe followed her, soon catching up at the mouth of the forest. \"What is it?\" Richard called from behind them. There was no answer for a few minutes, but soon enough, Richard heard Alice gasp. \"Alice,\" Richard said, \"what's going on? What do you see?\" \"There's something queer out here,\" she remarked. \"I've just stepped out, and some sort of invisible wall has almost stopped me. What do you suppose it could be?\" Chloe, listening to Alice's description, stepped up beside her, and shuddered as well when she advanced forward. Shocked, she shook her head and looked up and down and all around, as if searching for whatever unseen thing had touched her. \"You're right,\" she said, looking down at Alice. \"There's something weird going on out here. Come and see, Richard.\" \"Well I don't know what I'll see ,\" Richard remarked, catching up to his friends. Although he wasn't too sure what they were talking about, he was beginning to get some idea of it. It made his heart jump when he considered the notion. By the time Richard caught up to Chloe and Alice, his skin could already feel that wind-rush-like draw of something that he hadn't felt for such a long time. And in fact, as he reached out his hand to feel the difference in the air, his hand seemed to pass right through something like a quick gust across his skin. A shiver ran down his back, and Richard made a wide grin appear on his face. \"You know what this means?\" he asked. Chloe and Alice looked at each other, then at Richard. \"No,\" they both said together. Richard stepped back from the membrane of air that surrounded him and his friends. There was, before them all, a wide stretch of land, luminous in the dank night with the bright moon, but still very bland and grey in its appearance. But when he stepped through the air, the land completely transformed. The grass was a mix of green and brown, but the land was now glowing with a high afternoon sun, a warm summer breeze passing through the space. It didn't hold as much beauty as one would expect from the fantasy section, but it was a good step-up from the horror they had so recently run for their lives through. \"It's a border, guys,\" Richard replied, feeling the border with his hand still. \"We're passing from one section to another!\" Alice and Chloe both looked on, awestruck. \"You must be joking,\" Chloe said, looking from each direction at their new surroundings. \"Would I joke about something like this ?\" Richard wondered aloud, gesturing madly in front of him. \"It's like coming home after what we've been through!\" \"That's true,\" Chloe agreed with a nod of her head. \"It's glorious seeing everything so bright and sunny. Geez, I don't know how long they kept me up in that tower, so this is just…so…so…\" \"Curious?\" Alice suggested. \"That's what I think of this.\" \"Well we won't get anywhere else by just standing here with our mouths open,\" Richard said, already starting to jump down from the trees and into action. \"We're this much closer to getting back to the rotunda!\" Chloe followed Richard's enthusiasm, taking Alice's hand and racing after him down the hill at the edge of the forest. And down they ran, their heartbeats pounding all throughout, the hard ring of their footsteps reverberating through their legs. In fact, this new kind of excitement at having reached the end of the horror section induced a hidden laughter in all three of them, and not since the very end of the party had they laughed so long and hard. Alice even went so far as to dance around with Chloe, laughing like a kookaburra, in a sweet, melodic sound. Richard turned to look at her, and Chloe, who was giggling along with her. There just seemed no better way to express their happiness at having conquered the spooky forest, and finally moving onto a new chapter in their perilous adventures. When the three of them had had their little celebration, they turned their gaze to the sun, rising high into the bright sky. They stood together, three minds with but one thought. \"Now what do we do?\" Alice wondered aloud. Richard reached into his pocket, and moved his hand around to find the battered compass. He expected to feel a cold slab of metal touch his weathered fingers. But in both pockets, his hands turned out nothing. Richard almost gasped out loud, but he was able to suppress his inner panic. He didn't know how the compass could've been lost, but he didn't dare express his feelings. Pulling his hands out of his pockets, Richard simply cleared his throat, and then took a deep breath. \"I think…I think I might know where we can go,\" he said. \"If…\" Opening his hands, Richard whispered, \" Treasure Island . A pirate's spyglass .\" He lifted the tarnished telescope-like object to his eye, peering through to observe the land around them. Curiously he spanned the horizon, coming to view nothing but trees and shrubbery, and even some great birds sweeping the sky with their long wings. Even now it still thrilled him to see such new scenery, but it couldn't quite hide his disappointment at seeing no civilization for miles around. But then, his eyesight fell upon something far away, something that he didn't notice before with a relaxed gaze. His eyelids closed slightly over his eyes, peering harder at the sight before them all. On the edge of the horizon, there was a large, wooden building. The shingled roof was weathered with age, surrounded by tall trees, even standing adjacent to a hidden river, coursing across the land as gently as a lullaby. \"There!\" Richard blurted automatically. \"There's a building!\" Both Chloe and Alice rushed closer to Richard, as if trying to fight for a look through the spyglass. Immediately they began to ask questions, showering him with enthusiasm. \"Shh!\" Richard finally replied. When his friends were quiet again, he handed them each the spyglass, still trying to focus his vision on the building he saw. It was secluded, alone in the entire world, it seemed. \"There's someone there!\" Chloe said loudly. \"No, wait a second! There's three of them. Now six! There's a whole bunch of them! Some of them are carrying some buckets.\" \"Could it be a farm?\" Alice wanted to know, placing her hand over her forehead to better see the place ahead of them. Chloe didn't answer; she only leaned further forward to see more. \"They look like decent men,\" was all she said for the moment. \"Maybe they can tell us something about this part of the library.\" Richard was, in all truths, unsure about going down to that place to ask where they were. When he got the spyglass back from Chloe, he watched the band of men walking around the building, one of them going towards a farmhouse a short distance from it. Their faces were soiled with soot, a couple of them looking quite gruff and serious. His eyes widened in the slightest, when he saw the man walking to the farmhouse carting a rifle in his belt pocket. \"Looks like a farm of gangsters to me,\" he noted uncertainly. \"I really don't know what they will do for us.\" Chloe stiffened at the mention of the possibility of gangsters, but she was starting to have a feeling what kind of story they were walking into. She was almost sure of it. \"I think they can tell us something,\" she said. \"If they're farmers and farmhands, they should know the land, just a little.\" \"And if they're not?\" Richard challenged, lowering the spyglass from his eye. \"Use your imagination,\" Chloe suggested, starting to step down in the direction of the farm. Alice hopped down after her, her dress puffing out a little as she rushed after her. Richard sucked in another breath, touching his battle-ridden sword for good measure, before following his friends into another unknown adventure.[Chapter 7] Chapter 7 It wasn't too long before Richard, Chloe, and Alice were at the foot of the hill, on the border of the fence that surrounded the farm. There was no gate where they came from, so they just hopped the decaying planks, sweeping the dust of the ground from their clothes. Alice, being so small, had to be helped over by Chloe and Richard, and even when she was on the other side, the curious gaze in her eyes never melted. The trio of travelers stood where they were, seeming to wait for the surroundings to soak into their minds, rather than inquiring what was going on. Even Chloe seemed to not want to move. But her hand was stuck to her chin, one eyebrow cocked high on her forehead. \"Now what are we supposed to do?\" Alice wondered, raising her hands in question. Neither Richard nor Chloe could reply to that. Instead, Chloe took a step forward, and started across the dirty terrain, not giving any indication where she was headed. \"Um, Chloe?\" Richard began to walk after her. \"Whoa, hold it up there, kid,\" a voice said. Richard harshly halted himself when a man no younger than eighty was at his side, accompanied by a limping dog with sagging skin, and fur that stank like nothing else. \"Whoa, excuse me,\" Richard said, trying to push past after Chloe. But the old man put a wrinkly hand on his shoulder. \"Whaddya doin'?\" the man wanted to know. \"I don't reckon seeing you around here before.\" \"I just need to follow my friend. She's over there.\" He pointed off to Chloe, who was standing at the other side of the field, looking back at them while some of the other farmhands were gathering around her. \"That young lady there?\" Richard nodded. The old man chuckled. \"Ah, hell, kid. She's not fit to be in these parts of the Salinas.\" He peered at Chloe, observing her like she was an unseen specimen. \"The girl's like one of those fancy damsels you read about in th' storybooks.\" \"Chloe!\" Richard called to her, ignoring the old man's comment. \"Richard, come on!\" she said, gesturing wildly for him and Alice to follow her. \"Richard, huh?\" The old man grinned lopsidedly at him. \"Can't say I've met a Richard before. My name's Candy. Good to meetcha.\" The man extended his hand to Richard, dirty with farm work and speckled with calluses, but Richard meekly returned the gesture. \"I'm Alice,\" Alice said, coming forth with a polite curtsy. \"Hello there, little miss,\" Candy said. His dog barked at Alice, panting like he was waiting for her to give him a bone. She only bent down and patted the old creature's head. The second that she was back on her feet however, she gave a little cough, putting her hand to her throat. \"Ya like him, don'tcha?\" Candy said. \"Had this dog since he was a pup. Ya just can't find any other kind of dog like him, truly.\" \"So I see,\" Alice said. Her voice was a little strained, as she tried to maintain her manners in the wake of the dog's thick, ugly smell. Even Richard had a hard time keeping a straight face while the dog stood by him. \"Come on, you two,\" Chloe called out again. \"They can tell us where we are.\" \"So you're lost.\" Candy put his hand down to Alice- who peered past him to notice that his other hand was missing- and he started leading her across the field. \"Well then, hows about we go inside the bunkhouse and talk a minute? Curley's gonna get his knickers tied in hellsa bunches if he sees we're off work too long. He's been awful cocky since he got married, ya know.\" \"Who is Curley?\" Alice said. \"Who's Curley? I'll tell ya 'bout Curley,\" Candy replied, a little disdainfully. \"Curley's dad is the boss o' this place. Wife lives in the room over the barn, always lurking 'round places she ain't wanted. And I tell ya, Curley ain't much different. Keeps us in line like hounds do sheep- thinks he's got this place right in the palm of his sweaty hand. Pray t' God ya never run into him, or his pig wife. That heart o' hers is icier than January, even t' sweet children like you.\" He gave a cautioned expression towards Alice, who looked like her eyes would be squeezed to bits with the disgusted frown on her face. \"She sounds awful,\" Alice stated. \"But, what about the other men? Are they nice? If a man like Curley married a woman like his wife, he must be twice as horrid.\" Candy chuckled. \"Aw, now, don't you worry yourself about the others. They's a bit rough 'round the edges at times, but they always got good hearts. I reckon they'd like to meet a flower like you, and your brother.\" Alice looked up at Richard. \"Richard's not my brother, simply a friend,\" she said. \"We're traveling across the library to get back to the rotunda.\" \"Ain't ya now?\" Candy was fascinated by this ordeal. \"Come now. Why don'tcha tell me 'bout it, would ya?\" Alice cleared her throat, and started to go on about their adventures, her face colorful while she excitedly spoke. Candy was attentive, his dog giving little barks during the story. Chloe had meanwhile managed to catch up to them, walking alongside Richard, and also talked about the farmhands who had greeted her on the field. Finally, Candy pulled open the bunkhouse door, and they stepped inside. The place was dim, and smelled of musty hay, but adequate enough to not bring disgust. Alice took her place on one of the bunks, but she instantly stepped back up when she let out a little cry. \"What?\" Richard and Chloe yelped at the same time. \"It's a mouse! Oh, a poor little mouse ! It's dead!\" Alice stepped further back from the bunk, her hands over her mouth in shock. Candy stepped up to the bed, and observed the corpse, with its paws pulled together and its tender eyes closed peacefully. \"Aw, it's allright,\" he said. \"That ole coot Lennie's always carryin' 'round somethin' in his pocket. Never lets his old buddy George know 'bout them- he'd get in some trouble.\" Richard and Chloe looked at each other, recognizing the story of the famous literary characters from Of Mice and Men . Alice, however, looked on with her mouth agape in an odd way. \"That's queer- a man carrying around a dead mouse. What for, anyway?\" \"The coot's like a little kid,\" Candy replied. \"Jus' likes feeling soft things, is all. Yeah, we think it's downright weird ourselves, but we like him jus' the same.\" Alice nodded, glancing with a reluctant eye back at the mouse. \"Poor thing,\" she whispered. \"It sounds like he cannot help himself, and no one understands.\" Candy shook his head. \"Hey, it's Curley who don't understand a thing 'bout the friendships we've got with Lennie and George. Those two come a long way to be 'ere. Hard times and hard hearts like Curley are thorns in our sides, 'specially George's.\" \"Where are they? George and Lennie,\" Alice wanted to know. \"Aw, Lennie's always disappearin' somewheres,\" Candy said. \"Think Slim said he's in the barn, maybe.\" \" Don't you go yellin' !\" All four heads turned when a long, loud cry penetrated the bunkhouse walls. Followed by the sounds of grunting and struggling, Candy's dog started to whimper, its knees shaking. \"You'd better sit your dog down,\" Alice said, pointing at the creature. \"His legs are shaking.\" \"Rheumatism. Gets worse all the days,\" Candy said. \"But I think there're worse things happenin' than my sick ole dog.\" Candy started for the door, followed by Richard, Chloe, and Alice. Outside the bunkhouse, the farmhands were shouting out to each other, having started a game of horseshoe while Curley was absent from the scene. The barn was suddenly quiet after all the strange sounds of struggling, as though it was actually empty of any life. All was instantly…normal. \"Queer,\" Alice said slowly. Candy strode to the barn door, and Richard, Chloe, and Alice stayed behind. But while Candy came closer to the door, Chloe inched forward, and Alice followed her. Richard was even more hesitant to go, having a bad feeling about what he would soon see. \"Lennie! Oh, Lennie!\" Candy was calling out. There was a short exchange of words, but after Candy gave a great shout, and the horses inside were stamping and whinnying in their stalls, he came quickly from the barn, running across the field to the horseshoe game. Even faster, he returned with a burly-looking man much younger than himself, with a dirtied hat and a face sweaty from heat. \"What was it you wanted to see me about?\" the man wanted to know as they walked quickly into the barn. And this time, the children did follow them inside. In the corner of the barn, under some high-slanted sun beams, Candy pointed. There was a slim figure covered with hay, buried thinly enough to be seen. It was a young woman with sausage-like curls, heavily made-up eyes and cheeks, and fingernails of devil red. The sweaty man bent down, and put his hand on the young woman's heart. He whispered something under his breath, and didn't move for some time. \"What done it, George?\" Candy wrung his hands while he watched. \"I should of knew.\" George's voice was cold, his teeth gritted together. Candy shook his head in slight disbelief. \"We oughtta let 'im go. Curley gonna get 'im lynched- gonna kill 'im!\" He paused. \"Such a nice fella, ole Lennie. I didn' think he'd do nothing like this.\" George shook his head solemnly. \"Listen, tell ya what I want ya to do,\" he finally said. \"I'll go to the bunkhouse, and then you come out and tell the boys what happened. I'll come out, and act like I didn't know, so they won't think I was in on it. Okay?\" Candy nodded. \"I'll surely do it.\" Without another word, George left the barn, closing the door behind him. Candy looked at the woman buried beneath the hay. Richard watched the old man's eyes on Curley's wife, dead of a broken neck. Candy's voice was full of contempt as he spoke through clenched teeth, \"You done it, di'n't you? Everybody knowed you'd mess up. You wasn't no good. No good at all!\" Behind him, Alice's eyes were open, and wet, like she were about to cry. Chloe's mouth was open halfway, her eyes shining over with the shock of it all. Richard just turned his head towards the barn door, anticipating a mob of men to come in and inspect the crime. But he couldn't quite call it a crime- more like an accident. This was one story ending he could remember, in which Lennie had been entranced with the woman's pretty hair, and couldn't help but try to touch it. \"He went too far,\" Richard found himself murmuring. Candy averted his gaze from the corpse. \"Listen, ya lot. Things is gonna get pretty nasty 'round here. Was nice chattin' with ya, but I suggest you get yourselves outta here before you get caught up in it.\" Alice nodded her head, too frightened to speak. Chloe took Alice's shaking hand, and started to lead her from the barn. Richard stuck behind. \"Whatcha waitin' 'round for?\" Candy asked him. \"Better get out. Get out and head down the river- that oughtta take ya far away enough.\" Then he laid a hand on Richard's shoulder. \"For the love of God, take care of them ladies. They a sweet lot, and ya wouldn't wanna lose 'em.\" \"I will.\" Richard put on his best brave face, although a little unsure. Candy grinned, patted Richard's shoulder, and then pushed him gently towards the barn door. Richard opened the door, and exited fast, not daring to look back while Candy came outside to notify the farmhands of the death inside the barn. He caught up with Chloe and Alice, who both stood at the fence, just starting to climb over. Hoisting Alice up in his arms, he brought her to the other side, jumping over after his friends. \"Where do we go now?\" Alice asked, looking nervously about her. At this, she clung tighter to Chloe, who held the frightened girl close like a caring mother. Richard looked off in the direction away from the farm. He saw nothing but trees and rolling hills, but upon taking a step closer to them, he could faintly hear a gentle babbling and a low splashing. \"The river,\" he said loudly, turning back to Chloe and Alice. \"We have to go to the river!\" \"What river?\" Alice wanted to know. \"Come on!\" Richard grabbed Alice's hand, and yanked her and Chloe in the direction of the gurgling, his footsteps crushing the grass while his friends followed him. They seemed to be racing against the sun, which set lower and lower in the sky, covering the forest in a light dimness; enough to cause them to trip over rocks and thick grass clumps in their hurry. At last, the gurgling swooshed through the trio's ears, and they came to a slowing stop. Ahead, Richard could just make out the glint of running water, and he started rapidly for it. He halted then, when he watched a large figure step out from the brush near the river. The figure moved to the water like a stalking bear, but only stopped at the shore to dip his lips in for a drink. A little bird skittered across the water, and the figure raised his head to watch it. With a closer step, the sad silhouette of Lennie became lighter, and they watched his innocent eyes cast themselves upon the river. His lips moved, to words so soft and melancholy that the trio was glad they couldn't hear them. Then, out of the same brush, came George. The branches rustled, and Lennie turned to face him, his face unchanging. The two men bent down towards each other, exchanging some words between themselves. It was hard to tell from a distance whether said words were angry, sad, or happy, but the exchange was tense enough for Richard, Chloe, and Alice to stay still and watch for what would happen. And the more time that passed, the more Richard's nails drove into his sweaty palms. Then a light summer wind channeled through the trees, making waves on the river, and magnifying the sounds of men's cries- far off, but looming closer like a thundercloud. George looked up and pointed across the river to another expanse of green and hills. \"Look across the river, Lennie, an' I'll tell you so you can almost see it.\" Lennie glanced up, and a tiny grin broke out, as for an instant, the dream of ever owning a home with George came alive. He really could almost see it- a little cottage with lots of land, and rabbits to tend to. He loved those rabbits. Behind him, George reached into his pocket, and pulled out something hard and dark brown. He snapped it in his hand, and then pointed it to the back of Lennie's head. \"We'll have a cow, and maybe a pig an' chickens,\" George whispered. \"And rabbits,\" added Lennie. \"And rabbits,\" George repeated, his voice shaking. \"George, I thought you was mad at me.\" Lennie's voice was shaking too. \"I ain't mad at you, Lennie. Just one thing I want ya to know.\" \"Let's get that place now.\" Lennie rose on his knees in looking towards the imaginary farm, as if praying for it to appear. George then held the object to the back of Lennie's head.[Chapter 8] Chapter 8 Terror seized their hearts while the trio leapt, the harsh bang snapping like an explosion around the mountainsides, zipping through their ears like bullets. It happened so fast none of them had time to suck in a breath, before they turned to escape. Richard's heart smacked his chest when he was suddenly lurched backwards, landing on top of something sturdy, vibrating under him when he came down. His palms hit the surface hard, wincing at the pain while Alice unexpectedly fell into his lap. \"Let's get out,\" Chloe said, closing her eyes. Richard fell forward into Alice when they suddenly began moving. Water gushed gently on either side of them, splashing on little rocks, while the boat bumped up and down with swift locomotion. Richard craned his head behind him, and watched the thin river rush by, swirling and rippling in extraordinary patterns into the grassy shores. Its surface was a twilight blue, glinting every now and then when it happened to catch the sun's final rays. Their boat was heading into the clearing that the river cut through just beyond, through the mountains and onto the horizon. Beside him, Alice sat on her knees, leaning her gaze downward towards her distorted reflection in the water. But then she stepped back from the bow of the boat, and bent her head down into her lap. Richard glanced behind at Chloe, who sat at the back with her eyes focused intently on the boat, and lips pursed in concentration. He then flicked his eyes to Alice, who had pulled back entirely from the bow, and wrapped her arms around her knees. \"Alice?\" Richard turned so that he was facing his little friend. \"You okay?\" Alice didn't speak for a long moment, only looking into her lap, where her once crisp dress was tattered and worn. Her hair was tangled, hanging over her face before she swept it away. \"I only hope to get to the rotunda soon,\" she finally said. \"And still alive, too. I've never seen fighting like the tower, or such violence before. I've heard of things like that happening all the time in the world, but I never thought it would find me.\" She raised her head to Richard, and wiped her face with her hand. \"I'm frightened, and I want this to be over.\" While Alice huddled deeper into her lap, Richard was brought back to the serious words Candy had said to him. In facing one obstacle after another, he knew there would be many more to face before they reached their destination. It made his heart race, but he swept that all aside. Gently, Richard touched Alice's shoulder, and she looked up. \"Come here, Alice,\" he said. \"I've said this over and over, but I can promise you. This world is dangerous, but it's definitely not hopeless. I mean, we've have made it this far. So we're going to do our best to keep you safe.\" Alice smiled. \"Besides, what would the world do without the first little girl to go through a looking glass?\" Alice smiled even wider, and wrapped her arms around Richard. She nuzzled deep inside, pushing her cheek against his side. \"It'll be okay,\" Richard said, putting wholehearted faith into his words. For a long time, Richard kept Alice close, and Chloe steered the boat in between rocks and around curves in the river. The world around them grew dimmer, then darker, until nighttime was upon them. The moon and stars dotted the sky, creating a nighttime spectacle, but not enough to light their way. In a second, Richard conjured a bright lantern, holding it steady at the front, while Alice began to make herself comfortable in the middle of the boat. Finally, when the surroundings grew quiet, and Chloe began to yawn, Richard switched places with her, using two oars to stroke through the water. Chloe lay down next to Alice, covered by a couple of blankets to keep out the chills. While they rested, Richard concentrated in developing a rhythm of rowing and watching his friends at alternating times. At first, the oars were like heavy planks that he could hardly push with, but he was slowly able to shove them back and forth. The night had become very still, so there were no forces of nature to keep the water from flowing against the boat. Of course, the late summer air brought about fireflies, which speckled like Christmas lights around the river. Even more so, were the night birds that tweeted their calls, sweetly filling the night. Then, as the woods thinned out, and the sky grew wider, it also became more silent. There were no more bird calls, not quite so many lightning bugs. Only the gurgling of the river heightened- gently strange in the darkness- and the sounds of Chloe and Alice's deep, sleepy breathing. By the light of the lantern, and the stars, Richard squinted his sleepy eyes to look around. The water still glinted beneath the oars, but the ripples were bigger, expanding in the space, never hitting the grass on the shores. But, where were the shores? Richard scooted closer to the lantern, and taking hold of its handle, waved it around the darkness. The golden-yellow light fell upon the water, the waves making the boat rock like a cradle. But no matter how far out Richard reached out to illuminate the space, there was not a hint of green around anywhere. The river was all he saw. \"Whoa. We're really not in the valley anymore,\" he whispered. And the more that he observed the ever-present water, the harder he felt his blood pound. Sitting back in the boat, Richard put down the lantern and grasped the oars with tense fingers. Still, he couldn't shake it off. Darkness in the middle of an unknown, widening river was unnerving, especially when the circumstances could have changed so much. He was becoming almost certain that something was waiting to attack their boat. It would be almost too easy at this hour, when the advantage could be stolen if Chloe was the first to be attacked, or if the lantern was accidentally submerged in the water… To vent some of his fear, Richard stroked harder with the oars, hoping to get far away enough before anything could actually happen. At the same time, he tried to mimic Chloe, in keeping an open mind. Even at sixteen, the dark still had the power to torture him. But it was all the worse now, because he had precious cargo aboard- especially precious, if survival in this world was to be certain. Tension had so overtaken Richard, that it took him several minutes to notice the lights. Lights, thousands of them, twinkling on and off, were hovering in the black. Watching them, the oars pumped faster, splashing some water into the boat and soaking through the blankets. Richard wiped his face, and with a newfound focus, continued to push the boat towards the civilization ahead of them. There was hoping that danger wouldn't ever come, and he was eager to reach it before morning came. Morning… Despite his excitement, the darkness around him was powerful in draining his energy. Richard had been rowing for most of the night now, tired from the escapade through the farm, and now from the never-ending stroking through the night. The aches in his arms were suddenly becoming sharper, much more prominent the more he flexed his muscles. The lights were coming closer, so very, very, close now; he could touch them if he reached out. Still, Richard's arms felt like jelly, his feet soaking in his weathered boots. Laying down felt very enticing, like a hot bath in winter… The oars still clenched in his fists, Richard leaned over into his lap. The lights of the city were slashing the darkness, but that didn't cease the boulder-like feeling in his eyes. His head hit his knees, gradually sliding down at Chloe's feet, dropping the oars, which both clanged on the boat's sides. The sound touched his ears, but sleep slowly overtook him while the boat floated along the river like a piece of driftwood by a beach. \"Richard.\" A gentle voice suddenly broke the silence. \"Richard.\" Stirring awake, Richard slowly raised his head, which was heavy from sleep. He swept back his bangs, and stretched his arms with a long yawn. \"Chloe,\" he said, \"what's going on?\" \"About time for you to rise and shine,\" she said, pointing around her. \"Also thought perhaps you would want to see the next literary masterpiece we run into.\" \"What? Whoa.\" Richard sat up straighter, stretching himself again and straightening his clothes. \"Care for some breakfast?\" Chloe whipped her hand around in a grand flourish, and produced a plate of steaming food, setting it down on Richard's lap. \"Morning, Richard,\" Alice said as she sat beside him. \"Oh, I can hardly believe it. We've arrived back home!\" Still a little delirious from sleep, Richard jolted in his seat and looked wide-eyed at Alice. \"The rotunda?\" \"No,\" Alice said with a laugh. \"I mean, we've arrived in London. Go on, please take a look.\" Richard squinted curiously at Alice, before he turned his head to see it. The sky was cloudy, but beneath it, was laid out a grand city. On either side of the wide river, there were marvelous buildings, with city-goers strolling outside. They were of the finest architecture, some reaching high for the sky. All kinds of boats were streaming down the river, with horns calling loudly into the day with cries of laughter and jovial conversation. \"It's not quite the rotunda,\" Alice said, breaking Richard's reverie. \"But it's home.\" Richard shrugged. \"Well, at least we won't have to worry about the cold, like when we met.\" Alice giggled in response, but her teeth were suddenly chattering, like castanets. Both Richard and Chloe were taken aback. \"Alice, you need a coat?\" Chloe asked, leaning towards her. Alice shook her head. \"The wind's picked up a little, that is all,\" she answered. Richard frowned. She said she was all right, but with the way her shoulders were shaking, and her hair tumbling around her head, it was clearly no ordinary summer chill affecting her. Even he was starting to get the shivers. \"Here, Alice.\" Chloe pointed a finger at her, and made a thick winter coat cover Alice's body. She stopped shivering, but her hair was still snapping with the strong breeze. Chloe sighed, and put her cloak hood over her head. Richard did the same, the two of them huddling into them while the wind continued to stream across the river. Richard took a look around. The waves on the river were tumbling over each other, snapping violently as they sprayed into the boat. The trio took cover from the mist, yelping as wave after wave smacked the boat's side. All around them, other boats, even the massive paddleboats, were starting to rock on the river, their passengers crying out in confusion. Flags were whipping, and an occasional hat came sailing across the sky, which was growing full of darkening clouds. Chloe tugged on her cloak, pulling it tighter around herself. \"Don't look now,\" she said nervously. \"But I think we've got a pretty big wall cloud coming.\" \"I really hope you don't mean that,\" Alice said, staring at the huge black clouds gathering just above the city. And these clouds certainly didn't look the normal thundercloud picture. They were monstrous, dark, bubbling within of grey and purple. Little white flashes sparked inside of them, illuminating the rolling wisps of vapor. For some long moments, nothing happened. The city seemed to have slowed down, watching this strange new phenomenon roll in overhead. The flashes rolled throughout the growing storm, but there was never once a sound of thunder. \"Strange,\" Chloe whispered. Instantaneously, a bolt of white-hot lightning sparked the ground, shoving a shower of sparks out over the water. The trio drew back with a scream, whipping their heads away from the flash, which seemed to prolong itself until Chloe forced herself to look back in wonderment. \"What is it?\" Alice said, lifting her hand away from her face. Richard stared, not believing the power of that single lightning strike. This was not good. \"That's definitely not good,\" Chloe said, watching as a crowd of people started to gather around the crater the strike had created. She grabbed at the oars and with a brief shut of her eyes, caused the boat to start through the water again. \"They've come.\" \"Who have come?\" Alice turned to Chloe, outright fear shining in her eyes while her knees trembled like hammers. \"We should just get away while we can.\" Chloe shoved with her imagination at the boat, coursing faster. \"Before that big, silver cylinder opens up.\"[Chapter 9] Chapter 9 By the time Chloe had mentally pushed their boat further down the river, a humongous crowd of people had surrounded the site of the lightning strike, expanding almost the entire expanse of shoreline. The storm boiled over their heads, looking like it could shoot down another bolt of death, but everyone was more interested in the destruction. Several observers looked between each other, and either shrugged, or gave little gasps of shock. Richard was doing the same thing- looking between the people and the storm above. He was too absorbed in all this, to even notice that Alice was starting to grasp his arm in a tight pinch. \"Ow! Alice!\" Richard finally protested when she got him too hard. \"Sorry,\" she anxiously said. \"Oh! Oh goodness! Richard! Look!\" Alice shot her pointer finger at the scene before them. He whipped his head around, and his expression turned as wide as Alice's saucer eyes. In the middle of the crowd, something was twisting and writhing about, like a great snake. In fact, it almost seemed to be, with a long body of wriggling silver, topped by two luminous disks of silver. And while the people around it dispersed and broke apart, the snake was followed by something else. Behind the snake, came a huge, bulking creature, also made of silver. It was huge as a bear, maybe larger, with skin oily like leather, but with large eyes, and tentacles like a squid. It moved about like one too, but a lot more clumsily, making the most disgustingly inhuman sounds to reach someone's ear. At this point, the crowd had broken apart, enough that the trio could see the monster struggling out of a large, silver cylinder, still smoking from its fresh impact with the earth. As if that wasn't horrific enough. One of the tentacles from this strange beast lashed out from its body, taking hold of someone in the crowd. Its other tentacles lashed out too, moving fluidly around the unlucky spectator's body like a serpent, until a scream signaled for the creature to snap its limbs in opposite directions. A strangled yelp pierced the air, and a collective gasp from other spectators sounded while the beast dropped its victim to the ground, dripping with a dark liquid. Alice doubled over, almost about to be sick, until she ducked behind Richard. \"Oh, no, that poor, poor, person!\" she said in a shaky voice. \"We should do something!\" Her plea went unanswered, as Chloe only pounded on the boat with her fist, like she was whipping a horse, trying to make the boat go faster. \"No, no, Alice!\" she said. \"We can't involved in any more trouble than we already have. Those monsters aren't the worst things to disgrace a page, but they can be a force to be reckoned with. We most definitely do not want that!\" She grunted loudly, now pushing with her body to increase their speed. The darkening sky was suddenly blasted again, when a bright light, and three distinct puffs of bright green flame, shot from the deep crater, right next to the dangerous hump of killer silver. The blasts came a second time, and were so bright this time, that they turned everything surrounding it a green-yellow color, only disappearing when the phenomena did. And in the midst of each blast, there came a hiss that rolled itself into a long, loud, sad droning. The trio shoved their hands over their ears to recover from the noise, but it didn't stop their hearts from racing. A great, strangely-shaped object rose from the crater, and the otherworldly, hellish sound magnified itself tenfold. The green rays suddenly appeared again, bouncing off of a group of nearby men, who all simultaneously glowed a white-green. When the light disappeared, the men were all gone too! \"Oh, no! We have to hurry!\" Alice cowered low into the boat, covering her head with her coat, and placed her hands over her head, like in an emergency drill. \"I'm going!\" Chloe yelled over the droning of the creature from the crater. The monster raised itself to full height, calling out into the storm in the awful screech. And suddenly, from all over the city, trees and other buildings were set alight with the same deathly green flame, while cries were heard from wherever the rays hit. \"They're multiplying!\" Richard said loudly, throwing himself into action. \"Stay down, Alice! We're going to go really fast!\" Swiftly, Richard slapped his hands on both sides of the boat, calling out, \" The Wizard of Oz books, the wings of the Gump!\" and there was instantly a kind of gentle vibrating where his hands touched. On either side, there came four pops as a pair of huge, palm-leaf-like wings spread out, branching out some more while they flapped vigorously against the waves. \"Go!\" Richard cried out to the leaves, and they quickly took the boat to a faster speed. Alice gasped loudly in her position, as the boat tipped while it got used to its new wings. And slowly, the bow of the boat tilted upward, as the leaves cranked furiously to take to the skies. Just above the water, while the boat started to fly, the sky gradually changed to a bright blue-green, flashing like deathly emeralds while the Martians sprayed their heat-rays. All around the river, buildings were smoking that same color, creating a loud void throughout the city while Londoners were running further away. They were all hopping over each other, the charred, fried ones standing out like devil spawn all over. Alice and Richard fell back to the stern of the boat, crying out in surprise while the boat slowly gained altitude. By this time, they were just above sea level, the wind rushing into their cold, wet faces. Chloe however, stayed at the front, holding on tightly while the last waves touched her face. A giant ray of green splattered the water below them. A scream escaped Chloe's mouth as she accidentally loosened her grip on the boat. She slid fast down the boat towards Richard, forcing a blow of air from his lips when she slammed into him. He put a hand to his mouth as Chloe scrambled to get off of him, but Richard grabbed onto her. \"No! Stay here, and get down!\" he yelled over the droning of the Martians, taking her hands and gluing them to the boat floor in his grip. He threw his gaze to Alice, who looked at him with such fear that he automatically knew consolation was not an option. \"You too, Alice!\" Richard grabbed the blanket from the floor, and covered both his friends with it, looking up at the Martians, which all began to show themselves more throughout the city. Green rays were more prominent, flashing like lightning storms while they started to advance through the distant suburbs, and finally all the way in. Every one of them looked the same, with the harsh metal armor, and the large, luminous disks for eyes; tentacles raised like limbs, and spraying the heat-rays in all directions, bent on destruction. The aliens shook the city with their footsteps, making the waves splash onto the shores and flooding onto that part of the river. The water collided with the buildings, creating a marvelous mist of white that would have been truly beautiful were it not such a sign of danger. And in between the clouds of mist, little black wisps flitted to and fro, like blobs of airborne ink. When the aliens weren't droning so loudly, the trio could hear wind rushing like a hurricane through the sky, as the strange shadows came in and out like dangerous insects. One of them zipped past the boat, and Richard ducked himself down over Chloe and Alice. The whooshing sound it made while it flew that close knocked against his mind, and suddenly, Richard's heart swelled like a balloon. \"It's them!\" he whispered, following them with his eyes. \"They've come back!\" Chloe poked her head out from under Richard's arm. \"Who? Who, Richard?\" she asked. \"It's the shadows, the ones from the rotunda!\" Richard pointed at them while they zipped around the sky, attacking helpless people as the Martians continued their rampage. \"I think they're helping the aliens.\" \"What?\" Chloe shoved aside the blanket onto Alice, and watched them. \"Well, I don't know what we can do. I can't just poof them into oblivion like before. And something tells me we'd need more than arrows to get rid of them.\" \"Don't do anything!\" Richard said firmly while he recovered Alice in the blanket. \"We just have to make it through this story without interfering, and get Alice safely to the rotunda.\" \"I know, I won't!\" Chloe resumed her position at the floor- hands over her head, and her eyes closed. Almost instantly, Richard was thrown back into the boat as its speed increased. Now the Gump-like boat was flying like an airplane, fast and sure. Richard was holding on for very life, his body hovering over Chloe and Alice beneath him. But then Richard had to duck as a whole mass of the shadow creatures whooshed overhead. They flew in precise formation, making turns in and around the buildings, only stopping to widen the void of Londoners in sight now. \"Okay, Chloe,\" he said softly, \"it's important that we find out why these things are here. Maybe they're something simply created by the villains to slow us down; like those red wizards at Dracula's tower.\" \"Maybe,\" Chloe answered. \"But we probably won't know unless we can civilly interrogate a villain, or when we get to the rotunda. The book of Lore Sir Hugo talked about might have the answer.\" \"I hope,\" Richard said, not daring to look at the creatures. Still, the terrifying curiosity was too much, and Richard peeked to his side to view the advancing Martians. His heart choked him as one of them eyed the boat, one of the bright disks gazing straight on, one of its tentacles raised. A bright circle of green light was glowing within it, becoming whiter and whiter as the circle grew larger. Richard lunged. \"Chloe! Brace yourself! They're going to shoot…!\" His call went unanswered as he took Chloe and Alice to the front of the boat to make the escape. A white-hot, searing streak of heat touched behind them, blazing like a laser as it tore across the boat. Splinters polluted the air while it was rapidly split in two pieces, several pieces of the Gump wings flying like confetti, while the three friends jumped from the boat. And with the river racing towards them, Richard lunged again to grab for his friends' hands. He felt nothing, as the icy currents swallowed him up in a single, pelting splash! The water flashed brightly again, while bubbles rose around Richard, tickling his freezing skin and making his clothes billow as everything around him became dark blue. Currents rushed by with immense pressure, sloshing and rocking around, almost like the river was trying its best to keep him submerged. Every part of Richard's mind was screaming for air, his arms and legs kicking furiously to reach the surface. The moment that he broke through the water, Richard's mouth opened in a loud, long breath, as he thrashed about in the waves. He was about to call out to his friends when a large wave splashed over his head, momentarily submerging him again, but he pushed back through, whipping his gaze in every which direction in search of a familiar face. \"Chloe! Alice!\" His voice didn't carry very far in the chaos surrounding him, and so he continuously tried to call them the further that he swam. The swimming part was no easy feat, as the water was deep and icy cold, and the waves crashed like mad against each other. The water shook with the Martian's steps, heightening the waves, and pushing Richard further away from hope of finding his friends. While in the water, Richard tried to make it to shore, ducking in and out as stray boats rocked near him, and debris showered like hail, sounding like thunderclaps in his ears. His eyes were flicking open and closed as water sprayed violently. But he was hopeful still. The shore wasn't that far away. The journey there was exhausting. Not being the best swimmer, Richard's energy was leaving fast, and the forgotten fear of the Martians was beginning to haunt him. They were multiplying, devouring the city quickly while Londoners were streaming across the shore for some unknown destination. The heat-rays were going on often enough to turn the sky the exact color as the deathly weapons, which made seeing ahead of him even more difficult. Add that to the hyper state his mind was in, wondering where Chloe or Alice could have gone, and it was completely easy for Richard to just stop and let all hope go. Richard was swimming so blindly through the water that a heart attack nearly gripped him when his nose bumped into the hard, earthy surface of the shore. Scrambling to his senses, he reached up to take hold, but something attached to his cape and he was immediately dragged back down. He let out a loud gasp as the water trapped him once again, but then, before he could even think of what happened, arms gripped him, and shoved him onshore, sending Richard into a sputtering of coughs and deep breaths. He slowly pulled himself to his feet, and shook his head to clear his head, but someone grabbed his hand and hurried him along. \"Hurry up, Rich! C'mon! If we don't hurry, that ferry will leave without us!\" The familiarity of the voice woke Richard like cold water, and he opened his eyes all the way to see Chloe's head of sopping red hair, bouncing against her back and sending a light mist behind her. She was racing against a huge crowd of people, pushing through and muttering quick pleas to get past. \"Chloe!\" Richard was too relieved to say anything else. \"Let's go, hurry!\" she shouted, looking back. \"Quick, take hold of Alice!\" At the mention of his friend, Richard looked to see Alice in Chloe's other hand, and she quickly fell back to him. With quick reaction, Richard grasped Alice's hand tightly as he could, absolutely refusing to let go. She was gasping, heaving huge, wet breaths while they ran, and Richard felt the urge to pick her up and simply carry her to wherever they were going. But the rapid beating of his tired heart told him otherwise, and he just kept going, following Chloe's swift pace. Finally, he could recognize their destination. At the far end of the shore, there was a great ferryboat, rocking on the waves despite being tied up, and frightened people were rushing aboard in violent streams. Its polished surface was flashing as the sky was lit up by the heat-rays. But the closer they got to the dock, the harder it was to push through. The crowds were denser than ever, shoving anything aside just to get onto the boat. Several times, Richard had to duck to the side to avoid being punched or eyed with a gun, and each time he heard Alice cry out, he had to pull her closer to him. By the time they reached the end of the dock, the scene had entirely erupted. No one was really trying to board- just trying to hurt or kill anyone in the way of safety. At this, the trio clung close to each other like glue, watching the violence unfold for seconds before they finally turned to board the ferry. Getting caught in the crowd was easy enough, but getting onboard was difficult. Richard immediately found that the gangplank was already heavily damaged by the hasty docking, and the rush to get inside. The planks that stuck up for better grip kept getting in the way, and the crowd pushing them forward was no help at all. Hastily, Richard refocused his eyes on the doorway ahead. They were almost there. Until a particularly strong man shoved through the bunches and punched Richard and Alice aside. Richard was pushed far enough to the side that he was suddenly teetering on the edge of the gangplank. People called and cried, pushing through so that it was difficult for Richard to regain a good footing. He held onto the old railing ropes, trying to get back inside and find Chloe and Alice, although he couldn't see them in the crowd. \"Chloe! Alice!\" he screamed. \"Chloe!\" He could hear them both reply in anguish, but the damage was already being done. The crowd was too big, and the ropes snapped. Richard plummeted from the gangplank and into the raging ocean, where the waves didn't greet him quite so well. With the Martians still rampaging through the city, and the stormy waves created by their raging wrath, he was threatened to be dragged away from the boat. The shock of falling into the water was tremendous, and Richard had a hard time resisting the waves that smacked him against the ferry. Water filled his mouth, and the waves never gave him a moment to spit it back out. It fell down his throat in salty mouthfuls, and Richard had to painfully sputter to heave it up. But not even that helped. The forces of nature were overcoming him, and the ferry still rocked powerfully- enough that the possibility of it swallowing him up was getting high. Richard started to swim away from it, in the meantime, trying to think of something to bring him back up to the ferry, calling out with a hoarse voice to get attention. No one so much as looked down at him. The harder Richard kicked, the more it seemed the waves were dragging him away from the ferry. The debris from the attacks was still falling, clogging his view of everything around him, and the spray from the waves was worse than torrential rain. His voice was getting hoarser and hoarser, becoming less noticeable. Richard would have tried to summon a boat, but the instant he did, the Martians' intended aim would come too close, and he would have to keep to the swimming. There was nothing left but to give to the ocean. Who knew where it would take him next.[Chapter 10] Chapter 10 When the ferry was no longer in sight, Richard had finally stopped fighting the waves altogether. His fear of the open ocean was overwhelming, and with the waves constantly crashing over his head, there was no true hope of escape. His mouth tasted dreadfully of salt and grime, and his bare skin stung from the overexposure. At this point, he wanted nothing more than to curl into a ball and let the waves carry him away. But, then again, maybe Richard wasn't quite willing to give up altogether just now. Deep inside himself, Richard could feel his conscience yelling for him to keep going, to push away all his fright and put his head to work again. I am a Proverb, he thought, but what can save me when I'm so exhausted and in the middle of some ocean? For a time, Richard considered his options, and focused on deep breaths to relax his tired muscles. And during that period, he drifted far away enough from London that the waves started to crash less and less, becoming a little gentler. In those waves, Richard was better able to calm himself, and think more clearly. At last, he was able to muster enough strength to call a raft, which he hoisted himself upon with jelly-like arms, but could at least save himself from the water. The breeze was freezing against his cold skin, making his teeth batter harshly, so he conjured a fresh cloak for himself, wrapping himself inside so snugly that from far off he would have resembled a misshapen bear, rather than a human being. Once that was done, Richard collapsed without a second's pause onto the raft floor. The thoughts whirling in his mind made him feel sick, and his endless swim through the ocean didn't help much at all. It was hard to believe, even now, that in less than a day, he had managed to lose both his friends, and was now stranded in the middle of who-knew-where. After having spent such a time with Chloe after their reunion at Dracula's tower, and being so glad to see her after so long, he had never considered losing her again. Even more horrifying, was that Alice was gone as well, lost in a crowd of terrified boat passengers, and perhaps never to make it to the rotunda on her own. Quite truthfully, Richard had taken it to heart that he was supposed to protect his friends, no matter what the odds were. And the fact that they were both gone, and he was lost yet again without any help, slashed at him like two great knives, so it was hard forgetting about them. Besides, what he needed- wanted- at the minute was to simply close his eyes and sleep. Everything that had happened- rowing through the night to London, running from the Martians, then taking an ocean swim, and then being separated from his friends- left him without any energy or will left, and so he succumbed quite easily to rest. With the raft rocking like a cradle in the midst of the waves, Richard closed his eyes, and pulled the folds of the huge, furry cloak into him. His skin was like gentle fire since the brutal cold now, and his muscles automatically slumped when sleep fell upon him like a warm nighttime blanket. For several hours, Richard's raft floated aimlessly across the water, the one sail billowing in the breeze. Richard stayed tucked away inside the cloak, very still, like some lonely corpse floating out to sea for an unknown destination. And as he slept, the color came back into his cheeks, and his breathing more prominent while the cold lifted from him. His mind, for the time being, was calm, without any horrid dreams to disturb him, and for the first time in a long time, he slept to his heart's desire, temporarily without care. Chuckink! A humongous jolt shook the raft, and Richard tumbled from slumber, rolling forward and out of his cloak, into a mound of pure white sand. His clothes, still damp from the swim, became full of the white grains, etching into his skin uncomfortably. Wait! Sand? Richard raised his head, scratching the sand from his hair, rubbing it from his eyes. Surprised, he scooped his hand through the sand, and felt his stomach turn to discover that he was no longer stranded in the water. Land! But, what kind of land? And, maybe, what kind of people lived on it? Richard raised his dazed head up again, and slowly began to take in his surroundings. Before him, there were several stone mounds, of the same pretty white as the sand. They rose to different heights, like a bunch of marble skyscrapers, all polished and shiny. They sparkled like ice against the bright sun, magnificent compared to the normal, natural mounds Richard remembered learning about. These were certainly not like that. They had to have been constructed by powerful, magical hands- far too beautiful for a mortal. And then, up on the flat top of one of the mounds, there came a large figure, clad all in dark color. Richard leapt up in case the mysterious thing might be a shadow creature, lifting his hand to attack it, his legs spread apart to run. But the figure slowly emerged, and a human head appeared, with long, gorgeous hair waving in the high breeze. The blackness surrounding the person was a dress, fragments of thin and dark fabric moving with the wind. \"Great! Civilization!\" Richard thought for the second time, relaxing his tensed hand. But then, when he stepped back to further observe this new spectacle, his breath escaped him with wonder. On top of each of the mounds, a human woman was standing. They were dressed in similar clothing, all with dark colors of blue, purple, or black, but very simply. No large, poufy skirts, no grand jewelry- just simple dresses with simple objects strung into their loosely-hanging hair. Each of the women stood perfectly still, their faces turned to the water, and their hands placed together at their stomachs, like a statue in a temple with hands together in prayer. \"Can't they see me?\" Richard wondered aloud. \"They do not come down, nor look elsewhere, until they are called.\" Richard gasped, turning to the direction of the voice. It had been high, feminine, and mysterious, as if purposefully hiding a secret beneath the beauty. And, quite beautiful it was. Not too far from Richard, there was a young woman. She had long, curly dark hair, framing a face of rich-looking skin. Bright, piercing eyes sparkled in the middle of her perfect face. A small nose topped a pair of full, lavender lips, which slowly parted while the woman smiled at him. \"Where am I?\" Richard asked her. \"I- I need to get back to my friends.\" \"You are safe. That is all it shall ever be,\" she answered. \"But, what exactly, is this place?\" Richard elaborated. \"Which ocean, which island- just…what?\" \"This is your home.\" The woman's gaze, and her expression, never changed in light of this answer. When Richard looked back at her, she simply grinned, not giving an indication that she would say any more. \"You don't get it,\" Richard said. \"I've come here by mistake, and I need to find the rotunda, and get back to my friends.\" The woman looked at him, almost like she was sorry for him. \"No one goes from this island,\" she explained. \"It has everything that you'll ever need for your life.\" Richard looked wide-eyed at the woman. \"You look tired,\" the woman said. \"Would you like water?\" Richard didn't quite trust this woman- much less her mouth- but after that awful journey through the water, with the salty taste still grimy on his tongue, it was hard for Richard to keep his head from nodding. \"Bring water!\" the woman called. Immediately, some of the women standing on the mounds stepped down, disappearing from view. Soon, they came to the sand, all of them helping to carry an enormous jug. It sloshed gently while they carried it, and then finally handed it to Richard. Tentatively, he removed the plug, and raised it to his lips. The icy liquid smoothed across his dried tongue like melted chocolate, and he found that he was raising the jug higher and higher, letting the water rush down his throat, dripping out of the corners of his mouth and into the sand. \"Feel better?\" the woman asked, peering down at Richard. Richard absentmindedly nodded his head, dazed from the relief the water brought. The woman only smiled, holding out her hands to help Richard from the ground. He was hesitant, but eventually, he was back on his feet, sweeping the sand from his clothes. \"It's only every couple hundred years I have a guest,\" the woman said softly. \"Come. Come and rest inside my home.\" She started a slow walk towards one of the bigger stone mounds. Her words threw Richard off. \"Hundred years,\" he said to himself, while the pieces slowly started to come together. \"Are- are you a goddess, or something?\" The woman turned, and swept back her dress, to reveal her long legs covered with bangles and gold and silver bands. \"I am, but only half,\" she answered, a fierce, daring sparkle glinting in her bright eyes. \"I am Calypso.\"[Chapter 11] Chapter 11 The inside of the stone mound was like a huge cave, with a mouth at one end, and a giant hearth in the center, where a fire was always burning. Several of the young women who stood on the other mounds were gathering, tending to the fire, and holding spools of thread around a massive loom. Calypso sat at the loom, weaving with a strong hand, her maids whispering and squealing around her. Richard was lying down, wrapped in his cloak by the fire. While warm and cozy, his stomach was turning in mad flips, his eyes never leaving the beautiful nymph sitting by the loom. He was suddenly remembering what this all was. Calypso was the famous Greek nymph who kept the hero Odysseus on her island for seven years, giving him great luxury before he was asked to be freed by the messenger god, Hermes. There was no true danger afoot, but he was thinking of what this conniving nymph had in mind. No slavery or hardships- just nothing but blatant pleasure between the two, and a lifetime of blissful immortality on the island. It was disturbing to think of such a thing occurring, especially when there were other places he should be. At this moment, one of the maids crept up to Richard, petting his fur cloak with tentative amusement. She giggled and gestured to another one to follow her. The other girl squealed loudly, the sound grating on Richard's ears. He greatly resisted the urge to kick them away, for fear of being discovered awake by Calypso. \"Away from him!\" the nymph's voice said harshly, cutting through the stony walls. Richard and the maids flinched, and the two girls retreated hastily, while Calypso left her loom and walked towards Richard, who immediately closed his eyes and pretended to sleep. \"There's something great about this young man,\" she crooned. \"A person of his years could never have stayed on Poseidon's sea alone and survived, without any weapons or food. What? What does he possess?\" Richard felt his toes curl nervously. If Calypso thought he was ordinary, that would be fine enough. But knowing that he was one of the Proverbs, well, that would almost double the impossibility of escape. Surely a slithery creature like Calypso couldn't resist a person with power. \"Well, a brave-hearted human nonetheless,\" she said. \"There's no doubt he would make a fair companion. Fair-haired, skin like marble, eyes like crystal…\" With the slippery, icy way that she spoke about him, Richard had to chomp his teeth together to keep from opening his eyes and throwing sparks at her. He did not appreciate the way this woman intended to use him, and most definitely not what he might endure in the time he spent on this island. But then, why was he suddenly feeling so peaceful, lying there, while this beautiful creature sat so near him? She was sitting so still, just a pinch alluring, her long-nailed fingers massaging the hot surface of his leg. She inched along very easily, her nails leaving a soft etch where she touched. And for the moment, it was actually calming, beginning to lure Richard into drowsiness. Then he got a tickling sensation, as Calypso's fingernail trailed further and further into his inner thigh… \"Hey!\" Richard scrambled from his position on the stone slab he was lying on, and vigorously swept his hands across his legs, as if brushing away Calypso's touch. He straightened his shirt and glared at her. \"What the heck do you think you're doing?\" he said, loudly enough to echo throughout the whole island. \"That is not a good place to be near me!\" Calypso seemed unfazed by Richard's outburst. \"Don't worry,\" she said, very smoothly. \"It's easy to be afraid when you have come somewhere unfamiliar. I can soon make it better.\" Slowly, she stood from the bed, and started for Richard, her arms outstretched. \"Come back over here. I'll let you return to sleep.\" \"No, forget it,\" Richard said, turning towards the mouth of the cave. \"I'm going to go. Now.\" \"Go?\" Calypso's voice was full of longing, but it didn't mean a thing to Richard. \"You cannot leave so fast. There are no ships.\" \"Watch me!\" Richard raised his hand, and opened his mouth to call another raft, the open ocean beckoning. Then, out of nowhere, three of the maids appeared and took Richard by his arms, dragging him back into the cave. Having some time to react, Richard forced his hands out of the girls' grasps, and called out \" Stephen King's Firestarter, hot skin! \" The girls suddenly began to whimper, as Richard had instantly turned his skin red hot- steaming gently, but hot enough to burn the maids' hands where they touched him. They ran about whimpering, racing to the water to sooth their burns, but the salt only made them worse. Richard grinned, keeping in his triumphant laughter. Calypso stood at the mouth of the cave, one hand hanging onto the rim of the opening, her mouth fixed in a tight line. Her eyes were bright, now shining like the moon. It was amazing, even to her, to see something like that happen. That was the kind of work only the gods could evoke- this seemingly-usual boy had conjured fire on his bare skin, by invoking the words of a book. \"A Proverb!\" she hissed. Richard was quickly retreating to the beach again, but another set of maids tried to take him. This time however, when he tried to go Firestarter on them, one maid took a jug of water and dumped it over him. Of course, he tried the tactic again, but he could only make himself lukewarm, so the maids could drag him just where they wanted- right back to Calypso. She looked at him, a mixture of seduction and excitement in her expression. \"You…you are a Proverb,\" she whispered. \"One of them.\" \"Okay, so I am,\" Richard said. \"You can take it or leave it.\" Calypso said no more, only seeming to explore every corner of Richard's fiery face, and then pulling him further into the cave. Finally, when she brought him back before the fire, she turned herself around, her dark hair swishing around in Richard's face; he had to twitch his nose to shake off the tickly sensation. \"You must truly miss your other friends,\" she said. \"The rotunda is so far off.\" Richard didn't answer her. \"It's difficult to be so far away. I understand. Come and rest here, and I can help you.\" All the while, she gave Richard that alluring smile that was becoming her trademark. Like always, it didn't affect him at all. He was repulsed by this nymph, ready to shoot her, and her maids, down so he could leave for good. \"Like I said, you can forget it!\" Richard sat up straight, and glared right into Calypso's eyes, fighting the beautiful spell that could so easily take him. \"I don't care what you say. I won't come and rest over there.\" He gestured to Calypso's lap with the strongest expression of repulse he could make on his face, and kept it there. \"My sweet boy, it's dangerous on the sea,\" Calypso said. \"Staying on my island is your only hope of sure survival, even with your god-given powers.\" \"They weren't given to me by the gods,\" Richard said defiantly. \"It was the books that did that to me. Your world here is pretty much nothing compared to what the Pagemaster will get back once this war's over.\" \"That is not the idea, boy.\" Calypso's calm face was starting to falter. \"After all that I gave to you, I would expect more thanks, even from a god among the normal people.\" Richard shook his head. \"If you let me go, maybe I would thank you. But even then, maybe I wouldn't. Men probably don't appreciate you taking them prisoner just so you can make them love you. It's sick!\" \"This island is here, and here is where you will stay!\" Calypso lunged at Richard and then gently started to put her hands on his face, but he resisted. \"No!\" Calypso's eyes flashed madly for just a second, looking almost lethal. But then she relaxed her grip, and stepped back an inch from Richard. \"Very well,\" she said. \"But, do not ever believe that your loneliness will grant you a way out.\" She stood up, and went back to her loom, furiously pulling her tools to and fro through her work. Later that night, when Richard was alone in the cave, and Calypso out in the tide-pools on the beach, he huddled into his cloak like a little tent, facing the star-filled sky. After the fiasco that afternoon, he didn't have a feeling he'd be escaping any day soon. Any day soon, he repeated. That was how long Calypso no doubt intended to keep him prisoner on the island. Although the conditions wouldn't be absolutely dreadful, he didn't look forward to the endless days of a nymph trying to love him. He stuck out his tongue and made a face just thinking of it. Sighing deeply, he rested his chin in his hands, staring at the moon and the stars over the sea. And suddenly, everything that he remembered about Greek mythology came flooding back to him. Perhaps now, the goddess of the moon, Artemis, was watching him in his misery from the sky. Or Poseidon, on the waves, was just glimpsing him as he splashed by. The moment he remembered it, Richard suddenly didn't feel so alone. In this world, the gods were as real as he was, and could take on human form when he asked them to. Instantly, Richard sat up. An idea was beginning to form in his mind. Perhaps if he could communicate with one or more of the gods, they could help him escape the island! Quickly, Richard got back down, and covered all of himself but his head with the cloak, bending his head down, as if to pray. He shut his eyes, and whispered as loudly as he could without anyone nearby hearing him. \"Oh, mighty, Zeus. Hello? If you can hear me, I need to ask you for some help. The nymph, Calypso, has trapped me on her island, and refuses to let me go free. I am the Proverb of the Books, Richard, and I must get to the rotunda to find my friends Chloe, and Alice, and Peaseblossom, and all the rest of them. Please. I have to know soon that they are safe, and that they are staying away from trouble. If you can, please watch over them and don't let any danger come to them.\" Richard paused, opening his eyes to look around for any sign of movement, before he refocused himself, and finally whispered, \"thanks.\" It wasn't until morning that Richard was able to get an answer. He pretended to be asleep so that he could hear a god coming- if they were as responding as he remembered- and then answer them, without Calypso's immediate interference. For when he awakened, he didn't hear Calypso at her loom; only the maids running around performing work. Because the bed was so close to the mouth of the cave, Richard was certain he'd hear anything coming, whether it be a rat or a god. And he was shaking in his cloak waiting for a god to reply, hoping that he would be rescued by the end of the day, if not the morning. For a long time though, Richard had been lying so still that he was luring himself back into peaceful sleep, his breathing becoming more prominent under his cloak. And finally, his stagnant body became utterly silent, slumbering… \"Richard.\" A voice smoother than honey crept into Richard's ears, and he stirred, rolling over so that his cloak fell to the floor, and he was discovered by the figure that floated over his bed. \"Richard.\" The voice repeated itself, a beautifully muscular arm reaching down to touch him, the warmth radiating powerfully from the glowing skin. Richard's eyes snapped open. Before him, there was a man, with perfectly toned muscles and eyes bright as pearls. In one hand, he carried a staff shaped like the caduceus, and on his feet were golden slippers with little flapping wings attached to them. A little gasp came from Richard while he took an abrupt jump back from this strange person in front of him. At the same time, he was excited, and shocked- there was a man there, and he was radiating a pure holy light that only meant one thing. \"You're a god,\" Richard said. The man widened his eyes at Richard and looked around. \"Where? I do not see a god.\" \"What're you talking about? You are the god!\" Richard didn't understand what this was about. The man turned back to Richard, and laughed- a gentle sound from his belly that shook the floor. \"Just a little jesting, boy. I am a god, but I still take most every chance to play the trick card.\" \"Okay, so you're a god…\" Richard took a minute to observe this majestic being, slowly coming to the conclusion when he saw the winged sandals. \"Hermes,\" he finally said. \"The one and only,\" the god said, raising his hands high in a grand flourish. Richard flung himself from the bed, and then stood at the god's level. \"Oh, thank god you're here!\" he exclaimed. \"Are you here to help me get out?\" Hermes shook his head forlornly. \"Alas, I am only the messenger god. However, I can bring you some news. Zeus himself heard your prayer for help, and he has sent me to say that he personally wishes you to go free. I am here also to inform Calypso of these conditions, and that dreadful things should befall her island if she does not comply to release the next hero that comes into her claws.\" \"About time,\" Richard muttered. \"You wouldn't believe what she's been trying to do to me since I came here.\" Hermes smiled and shook his head again. \"Unfortunately, it is her wish to steal men's hearts, and their freedom. But since you sent such a strong, heartfelt prayer, Zeus has answered to your distress above all else. You don't quite know how lucky you are.\" Richard laughed, so great was his joy he couldn't express it any other way. \"Thank you so much!\" he said. \"But, wait. What about Chloe, and Alice, and the others? Do you know anything about them?\" Hermes frowned. \"Now is where I cannot jest to you at all. She is in a whole other world, far away from this island, and thus, out of our reach.\" Before Richard's expression could droop, Hermes swooped a few inches down, and gave a hopeful smile. \"But, not all hope is lost, dear boy. After you prayed to Zeus, the gods created for you, a secret way off this island that Calypso shall never find.\" He pointed with his caduceus to a far part of the cave floor. Then he flew towards the exact spot, and knocked his golden hand down on it. It echoed gently, vibrating against the floor, not sounding wholly solid. Richard quickly ran to Hermes, and knocked again, placing his ear down on the ground. \"It sounds hollow,\" he remarked. Pausing a second, Richard crept down further into the ground, and pushed his fingertips into a crevice nearby, pulling up like a trapdoor. Underneath the crevice, pushed deep inside the hard terrain, was a tiny door. It was no longer than Richard's foot, and no wider than a book cover, so at first, he didn't really see how such a small portal could get him anywhere. But after a moment of swift thinking, he smiled. He knew just what he could do. \"Whilst I am paying Calypso a visit,\" Hermes instructed, \"you are to make yourself small enough to fit through this door, and disappear as quickly as you are able. After you have vanished from this island, we shall see that there is not a trace that you were ever here.\" \"Okay,\" Richard said. He could hardly believe this. The gods had answered him after all, and what's more, there was actually possibility of escape. Make that a certainty of escape. \"Thank you!\" Richard said. \"Thank you!\" Hermes bent down so that he was actually on the ground with Richard. \"We don't, and cannot, do everything for man, but there's faith that not even Calypso can keep you here.\" \"I'll fight if her maids catch me,\" Richard said determinedly. \"We'll be with you,\" Hermes said, flying back up. He said one last \"Farewell!\" before finally departing to find Calypso. Quickly, Richard raced to the bed, and clasped on his cloak, swinging the furry hood over his head. Just as quickly, if not more, he returned to the door, ducking down into the groove to hide. This is great, just wonderful, he thought gleefully. And with that one thought, Richard set to work. He pointed to the ground below him, conjuring a plate of plain-looking cookies. The only difference was that each one of them said, \"Eat Me\", in scrumptious chocolate chip. Deeply excited, Richard moved for the first cookie he spotted. He was hesitant though, in taking the bite. He honestly didn't know what was going to happen when he bit into the magical cookie, but there was no real time to worry about something so small compared to getting Chloe, and finally going back to the rotunda. Tentatively reaching the little cookie to his lips, Richard took a bite, and with two shaking fingers, opened the door.[Chapter 12] Chapter 12 In all the screaming and rumbling around her, Chloe found it extremely difficult to concentrate. She was inside the bottom deck of the ferry, sailing out to sea, and surrounded by crying babies, whimpering women and children, and men yelling at each other to get out of their way. Every second, she faced being kicked in the limbs, getting tripped, or just terrible body odor. The conditions on this ferry were awful, with everyone thinking the apocalypse was at hand, and no room to move around. What was worse; Chloe didn't see Alice anywhere. For hours, it seemed, Chloe did her best to make a full circle around the ship in search of the little girl. But she was blocked at every turn by a sailor or a terrified passenger, and could only go around the deck she started at. It was enough to make her scream like the baby lying next to her. Under more normal conditions, Chloe would have comforted the infant. But without Alice or Richard at her side, she felt as alone as when she was in Dracula's tower. She felt like yelling, and at this point, was certain she could scream louder than even the shrillest lady onboard. Her imagination was working rapidly to think of something to get her off this boat, but it was hard to when there were hundreds of Londoners making so much noise that she couldn't hear herself wonder. Finally, she buried her head into her tattered dress and covered herself with her cloak. This way, she felt at least a little bit separated from the chaos. Inside her little tent, Chloe was able to at last picture something, and that was just quiet ! Instantly, like smoke, the noise turned off, and just as quickly, her shoulders relaxed, leaning exhaustedly against the wall. The noise was gone, but Chloe's heart was still in torment. By this time, she had given up hope of finding Alice, and felt awful for having so easily lost her. Being lost in this crowd was probably worse than Wonderland itself, especially when you could be pulled in a million directions and there was no one to turn to; not even pure logic could save her. Just picturing little Alice wandering day and night through these dense crowds alone gave her a headache, and some of her emotion poured out through her eyes, wetting her skirt. It felt good to let out a couple of tears, but Chloe's heart was not broken just yet.Now that it was quiet, she was able to think straighter and consider her options. She knew that there was no way to get off the ferry without a compass, and so that was what she did. Mimicking Richard, she created a little enchanted pocket compass, complete with the directions in which she could find the sections. Then surely, she could more easily find her way to the rotunda. There would be no more fooling around, even if Richard and Alice were gone for the time being. It had been weeks- maybe months- since she, Richard, Sir Hugo, and Jip made their way from the Pagemaster's palace. It would be more than glorious to see familiar sights, and finally walk into battle to end the war, and send herself home. Tucking the compass safely in her pocket, Chloe leaned her head against the wall, and closed her eyes to think further. But somehow, the darkness and quiet made quite the pleasant mix, and then, she found herself pulling her cloak in closer, and cuddling into it like a big blanket. While the silence carried on, Chloe rested her tense muscles, and began to let herself sleep… A jolt was what later awakened Chloe from sleep. The ferry was now dark, rocking back and forth gently. In lifting the cloak from herself, Chloe half-expected the scene to still be bustling with screams and sobs. It was surprising to find it naturally silent, even when Chloe lifted the quiet with her sleepy imagination. Around her, bodies were still on the floor, on the stairs, and the benches. Deep, tired breaths were the only sounds in the air- enough that Chloe was afraid to move, in case someone spotted her and tried to take her. But near her, she saw the open staircase leading to the main deck nearby, lit by the dark blue of the night sky. Making her way to the stairs, Chloe readjusted her cloak and began to walk. That was, until something on the floor made her trip onto the stairs in front of her. Biting her tongue to suppress a frightened yelp, Chloe quickly stood up and whirled herself around with a swell in her heart, to spot what had tripped her. She breathed out when she saw she didn't trip on a person; there was some thing in the floor, sticking out in the new light like a shadow. Chloe bent down, stepping out of the way to better spotlight the dent on the ground near the wall. It was very deep, like a rabbit's hole- it actually was a hole- and could maybe have fit an orange through the opening. Curious, Chloe patted the floorboard with her palm. A hollow sound came through the floor and then through the nearby wall like a deep echo. An idea zipped through Chloe, although for a moment she doubted it. She dipped her fingers through the hole and pulled up hard like it was a cellar door. And suddenly, with a low creaking of old wood rubbing the other floorboards, she lifted up the wood like a door without a hinge, taking with it some of the others in the wall. Using all her strength, Chloe pulled the rotting wood away, careful not to make too much noise in case someone caught her damaging the ship. Chloe's eyes widened when she saw the surprise behind the floorboards. A long, dark tunnel stretched down the wall, not a bit of light appearing down the way to break the darkness. Footsteps followed from nearby, patting the floor with hasty steps. Chloe nearly cried out with fear when she heard them, but finally scrambled through the opening into the tunnel, making a grab for the floorboards and pulling them back into place before the mystery walker could find her there. Closing the boards into place with her fingers through the hole, Chloe turned and began to crawl down the tunnel, ignoring the dismayed yelp of the ferry official behind her at seeing the damaged wood. Her skirts got caught under her legs sometimes, so she had to pause to untangle them. They grew worse with her hurry to get through the tunnel, but she managed fine with her hands, having grown very nimble from handling her bow and arrows, which, with a thought of her mind, strapped onto her back. At long last, Chloe began to see a faint circle of light before her. She crawled faster until she was speed-crawling to get to the end, her skirts almost tearing from her bodice with her haste. Chloe was now going fast enough that she tumbled out of the tunnel, rolling head over heels into some brighter place. She ended up with lost arrows, dirty skirts, and a dizzy head. Shaking her head and straightening her clothes, she stood up to make fact of her new surroundings. Instead of being in another deck of the ferry, she was now in an enclosed garden, closed up on all sides by stone walls and dead trees with intertwining vines on their branches. Crunched up leaves were floating like brown paper snow from them, covering the dead ground in a light sprinkling. In one corner under the trees was a stone bench, vines and branches hugging it to the ground. A large birdbath filled with water stood next to it, speckled with leaves. Nearly every plant and tree, save for a few miscellaneous flowers and rosebuds in a few spots, was dead and in sad shape, hanging like wet noodles from the trunks and walls. In spite of this surprising sight, Chloe had to shut her eyes tight before opening them again. This couldn't be true. The ferry boat had been surrounded by water. The tunnel couldn't have led her into this garden, where it was the middle of the day rather than the night. \"Could this be the secret garden itself?\" Chloe wondered, having become able to dismiss these strange things. She reached out a hand, touching a large branch that felt brittle and tender as an elderly woman's finger. It fell apart at the touch of her fingertips and fell to the ground like depressing confetti. A low croaking sound whispered from the corner of the garden under the bench. It sounded louder as a large, green frog hopped from the bench and looked at Chloe with its large black eyes. She stepped closer to it. \"Hello, little fellow,\" she said, bending down to it. \"You been here very long? Is there anyone else here?\" \"No, but you are here. And I am here.\" Chloe nearly screamed when she heard the voice. But it wasn't coming from behind her or in front or anywhere else. The frog had been the only other living thing there. It had to have been the frog that had spoken! Quickly, Chloe took out the enchanted compass, and studied the dial, which was turned towards the east- the very same direction as the fantasy section.[Chapter 13] Chapter 13 Startled, Chloe stumbled backwards, almost falling onto her behind again. She caught herself just in time before the frog took a hop closer to her. \"Good lady,\" the frog said in the same manly voice. \"What might be your name?\" \"I'm Chloe. And you?\" \"I am Prince Ryland, naturally.\" He hopped closer and gazed at Chloe like she were a beautiful fly. \"I am pleased to be meeting such a beauty like you. Suppose you could tell me where you are from?\" \"Actually, I am fighting in the war,\" Chloe answered instead. \"I am one of the Proverbs- of the Imagination. Maybe you know about that?\" Ryland stood very quietly, but then fell to the ground, flapping his webbed hands up and down in a frantic bow. \"Oh, then the honor is all the greater, lady. A Proverb is a rare person to come by, especially when all my friends have disappeared from the face of the world since war broke out. Do suppose you will forgive me for not recognizing you. It was foolish of me to not have. Please?\" Chloe shook her head in reply. \"Don't worry, little frog. I can understand why you didn't recognize me. But, do not try to flatter me with chivalry. That has been done enough .\" Ryland hopped towards a nest of twigs and pine needles under one of the willow trees. \"Come, lie down. You look like you have lost weeks' worth of rest. Well, naturally, of course. These are difficult times for a powerful girl like you.\" With a half-smile, Chloe said her thanks and walked towards the nest, where Ryland stood. He let her lay down, and then hopped closer to her face. \"Promise me one thing, lady,\" he whispered, \"that I may lay alongside you and share your meals with you. Then I will share my hospitality for as long as you wish. It has been so long since I last had a companion.\" \"You and me both,\" Chloe said, remembering the seemingly endless voyage on the ferry. \"But I also suppose you want something more than my friendship?\" It wasn't exactly that Chloe wanted to do what she thought the frog wanted; she was simply hoping to probe it out of him, in case she was right in her assumption. Ryland's eyes widened and he made a quick movement towards Chloe, as though he had remembered that last detail. \"As a matter of fact, there is. There is something you can do for me.\" He leaned his body upward, lifting a webbed hand like a cat begging for a ball of yarn. \"You must give me your best friendship, as well as your best love- with a kiss. And when you do, I shall be human again, so you and I can carry on our lives outside this garden- if and when we ever are set free.\" Chloe took a deep breath and shook Ryland's hand with her forefinger and thumb. \"It's a deal,\" she agreed, \"but perhaps you could help me when we get out in return for that kiss. The thing is, I need to find a good friend of mine and then I must get both of us back to the rotunda to help the Pagemaster.\" Ryland's smile fell. \"But, Chloe my lady, you only just arrived. Why do you want to leave so soon, and when I haven't gotten the chance to know you? And besides\"- he gestured towards the door, which was covered with vines, practically hidden from sight- \"the door is locked, the key on the other side. I myself have spent my good time looking for it, and I have never once seen it cross my path. Until someone comes for us, you are trapped here, as I have been for many weeks now since the war has begun. I am sorry.\" Chloe's heart sank, the possibility of escape slipping from her fingers. The war would continue to worsen without her, and they would be missing one of the most important people there to fight. She sighed, and looked at Ryland with a broken frown. \"Thank you for trying, Ryland, but I must get out as soon as possible. If I keep my own promise, then you must at least promise to help me in turn.\" \"Gladly,\" Ryland agreed. \"I would do that. But, for the moment, you must sleep; you will feel strength coming in your dreams once you do, believe me.\" Ryland gave Chloe an assuring look and hopped off to leave her be. She smiled after him; what a kind little frog he was. With that, Chloe shut her eyes, imagining a warm fleece blanket enveloping her as the afternoon drifted into twilight. She could feel the sweet comfort wrapping her away like a cocoon, while Ryland had disappeared soon after, beneath the bench by the birdbath. Occasionally, she heard him jump into the birdbath to rewet his skin, but that was the only sound the thoughtful frog ever made after he had left her to sleep. Chloe was out like a light bulb, breathing evenly and sweetly as night fell upon the little garden. The stars winked at her as they blinked dimly overhead, Ryland there right beside her under the bench, dreaming pleasantly in paradise. \"Rise and shine, if you please?\" Ryland's voice broke the silence in Chloe's head as he awoke her with his wet hand, slimy and cold on her skin. Chloe stirred and moved to sweep some of her loose hair from her face. She rose up from her makeshift bed and pushing the blanket from her legs, gave a little yawn and whispered a hello to Ryland. He returned the gesture by doing a cute little bow after setting down a bunch of roses. For a moment, Chloe glanced confusedly at the flowers. \"What exactly are those for?\" she wondered aloud. Ryland gave a wry smile and gestured sheepishly towards the vibrant roses. \"Why, these are for your bed-space, dear child. If you shall live here for some time until we are to escape or to be released, shouldn't you like something to make it as lovely as you?\" Chloe shrugged in acceptance. \"Yes, I suppose so. Thank you very much, they're pretty nice.\" \"Your thanks are accepted,\" Ryland answered, bowing again. \"I will admit, I am sorry I cannot provide you with a good breakfast. Preparing meals has never been one of my best talents; not to mention there is no true food back here.\" He glanced tryingly at some rotted berries nearby on a bush. \"Unless you prefer dead, and, er, poisonous berries.\" He gave a nervous chuckle, shamefully flicking his gaze to the ground. Chloe gave Ryland a confident grin. \"You were right on one thing. I feel so much better now that I have slept a little, and, now, I can make us both enough food to last us a lifetime just with this.\" She tapped her temple knowingly, and closed her eyes, her head sparkling with a white halo of light while her thoughts took to the air. With a swish and a pop, a grand feast was laid out in the grass picnic-style- piles of waffles and bacon, with syrup and fresh strawberries for her, and a large bowl of buzzing flies coated together with honey for Ryland. Ryland was awe-struck with rapture. He hopped to the bowl of flies with honey, and zipped his tongue into it, chewing for a second before swallowing the buzzing treat. He smiled like he had tasted heaven, and immediately zipped in for another. He repeated himself for every fly in the bowl, and even licked up the rest of the honey. \"A right-good cook you are, Chloe my lady!\" Ryland said, slapping his tongue around his lips hungrily. \"Honey with flies. That is something I have never tried before! Thank you!\" Chloe nodded as she bit into her last strawberry, turning her lips pink. Ryland laughed heartily, licking his lips, as his large, colorful eyes gazed up at her. For Chloe, it was hard to tell whether or not she should be scared, or grateful, for Ryland's services. If he hadn't had said he was a prince, than she would have believed he was a servant. The frog tried to do everything for Chloe. The moment she waved away their breakfast dishes, he offered to brush her hair, even to give her wash a dress while she bathed in the pond just behind the trees. Chloe thought it was a crude idea, but she still appreciated the little frog's kindness; the idea of watching him try to wash her grand, and ridiculously dirty, gown was almost laughable, but she bit her tongue to suppress giggles. It was cute, what he was trying to do. And indeed, tucked behind the grove of trees next to her sleeping spot, was a little pool. It was as wide as a car trunk, but deep enough to submerge herself. Despite her trust in Ryland, Chloe magically produced some tall cattails and flowers that would shield her from sight, also giving the water a clean sweep with her mind. When she had, the pool was a powder blue, dim in the shadow of the trees, but still glinting in the spaces between the branches. And with the flowers decorating the space like bright jewels, it seemed only like a bathing spot for a goddess. Still, Chloe removed her dress, and slowly plunged her entire body into the water, her mind bringing a gentle steam to the pond as little ripples tickled the rim of the pond. Her eyes shut, Chloe closed herself off from the world, feeling relieved. It was hard to believe she had come this far, and yet carried such stress inside- she could tell, for the instant she was fully submerged, her shoulders immediately dropped and her limbs fell dreamily to the bottom of the water. For a moment, she had actually forgotten where she was, and didn't really care; she was warm in a secluded garden, with a sweet and caring frog prince tending to her, without any vampires or aliens coming to attack. She felt certain that for the very first time since the tower, she was fully in control of what was happening around her, and could let go. As far as she knew, there was no other feeling in the world, and never wanted to let it go free. Ryland kept his word that he would do anything for Chloe, if perhaps, more than what he promised. He spent two hours washing Chloe's dress- even though the only part he truly got clean was the right sleeve- and his webbed hands were well-weathered by that time. He insisted he keep going, but when Chloe was about to get out of the pool, she simply imagined Ryland's work done, and put it back on. For just a couple of days, that was how they spent the hours. Wading through the pool, eating flies with honey, and brushing Chloe's hair while she fell asleep; Ryland did all in his power to ensure a pleasant stay for his friend, as she did the same for him. But Ryland just had one question, after having spent such time with Chloe. \"Do tell, Chloe, my lady, and please forgive me if I'm pressing too hard,\" Ryland said, hopping up close to her. \"Would you by any chance happen to have any, well, suitors, lovers? Anyone of the sort?\" Chloe swallowed a strawberry hard, a large chunk feeling like a rock in her throat. \"What?\" she gasped. \"Oh, well, I don't think so. I mean, I have had a few crushes, but those have gone…\" \"No, lady. Has there been anyone to ask your consent for marriage? Anyone you have truly loved? With your whole soul and heart?\" With an unsure frown, Chloe pushed the strawberry bowl away from her and tried to find a good answer. It was difficult when no one had truly expressed interest in her, where she would be obliged to reciprocate. Well, what about…what about Richard? Did he matter in something like this? Of course, he had to; if he didn't, he wouldn't even be her friend. But…really, and truly? He had the nerve to brave the forests and weapons and dangers for her, to help her get through- the only one who had opened her up like a warm, old book without saying she was a strange outsider. Many thoughts came flooding in, and Chloe's insides slowly glowed, if a bit harshly, from what was beginning to manifest inside. \"I suppose…\" She didn't finish, letting her voice trail away. Ryland's true response was unclear. He didn't move, or act surprised. Still, he cast his eyes downward, and seemed to slump his hands to the ground. \"Well, wonderful to know you have a good fellow looking out for you, dear Chloe. I've always been so alone, until you came to this garden. And so, now, I would like to reassure you that if and when something should ever happen, I will always be there for you. Frog or human, I will do anything to make safety certain for you.\" Chloe's heart fluttered again, while Ryland stayed where he was, standing tall on his hind legs. He was no taller than a flowerpot, but to Chloe, he was as tall as he would be if he were human. She picked him up and held him close to her; she didn't kiss him, and although Ryland was disappointed, he kept his same sweet expression. Somehow, this sparked a powerful resolution within Chloe. She had only just realized how powerful her need to get out of the garden was. And if she truly felt as she did about Richard, she would have to get out right that minute. Key or no key, she would bust out of there. She didn't know how she could without hurting herself, but she knew it would be done, one way or the other![Chapter 14] Chapter 14 Patting his pocket carefully, Richard turned around and closed the door behind him. He did it quickly, so as not to take another peek at Calypso's island. A great weight came off his shoulders when he shut it, feeling a deep sense of accomplishment in escaping the seductive nymph, and that he was in the final stage of his journey. So great was his determined relief that he immediately turned around, and without any thought at all, stepped forth and started to walk. It took him a second or two to realize he wasn't even sure of where he was. All he could say, was there were a whole lot of winding gravel paths, and stone walls covered with vines. It was kind of gloomy, except for the blazing spring sky, and the little robin that was hopping from wall to wall, tweeting its sweet tune. Richard only took note of all this for another moment, before he began walking down the path, his eyes wide and alert. Escape had given him an extra boost of energy, knowing what he had to now do, and felt he could somehow navigate through these paths, despite how endless they seemed. He scarcely walked five steps before a little brown bird with a red breast clicked its feet on the gravel, and flicked its beak up at him. Richard blinked quickly to register the little creature, but he grinned lopsidedly in recognizing it. \"Hey there,\" he said. \"You've been expecting me or something?\" The robin didn't move briefly, but then, it flicked its beak again, and started to chirp a choppy note. It turned on its heel and flapped its wings to the nearest wall. Sitting comfortably on top, ruffling its feathers, it looked back at Richard with sparkling eyes. \"You want to show me something?\" Richard said, gesturing towards himself. The robin tweeted shortly before taking off again, flying behind a wall, and starting to sing another song. \"Whoa,\" Richard exclaimed, starting to speed-walk after the little bird. His footsteps crunching in the gravel, he increased his speed, moving past a continuing cycle of stone walls and vine curtains. Richard felt like he was moving through a movie reel, because almost every wall looked identical, feeling like they held the same thing behind their doors. The further the robin led him into the labyrinth, the less he felt he could trust its direction. Finally, just when Richard opened his mouth to question the robin, it perched itself on top of a wall. This one was particularly covered in vines, thick enough that maybe there was no stone underneath. Richard saw no sign of a door, so he just shrugged at the robin, which tweeted loudly, pointing its beak down into the garden. \"What do you want me to do?\" Richard asked simply, stepping closer to the wall. The robin tweeted louder as he did so, hopping up and down excitedly. Unsure, Richard raised his hand to feel the wall. His fingers bumped up and down while they grazed the vines, the leaves waving as he touched them. When he stepped just a bit closer, his touch dug deeper beneath the growth. But, he probably went too far, because he stroked wood, catching on a thorn-like point that jabbed his finger. \"Ah!\" Richard yelped softly, suppressing a curse while he pulled his finger from under the vines. The sting stuck, but there was no blood, so he quickly put his hand down, and looked back at the robin, which still stared with its glassy eyes. \"What?\" Richard repeated, raising his hands questioningly. \"Show me!\" The bird was stagnant, singing in a softer tone as though muttering to itself, and finally flapped down to the ground, thumping in the grass. Richard followed it with his eyes, and then, bent down to where the robin stood. It pointed with its beak into the grass by the door, and sung one note. Richard gave the bird another lopsided expression, but still focused on that point. \"Okay,\" he whispered, still a little uncertain. \"I can take that hint, I guess.\" With another happier-sounding note, the robin hopped away and took to the skies, leaving Richard at the foot of the great door, almost half hidden by the tall weeds and tangled grass. Richard eyed the grass where the robin once was. \"Why bring me to the bottom of this one door?\" he wondered aloud. \"It's just…overgrown\"- his eyes started to light up- \"but…maybe so…\" Guesses whizzing through his head, Richard ran his hands over the grass, pulling apart the blades and lowering his head for a better look. It was no easy task, keeping his head low in the tickly grass, but then, his eyes spotted something buried in the dirt. In the bright spring sun, a speck of shine shimmered like gold, catching the light for just a second, but Richard instantly knew what the robin had been trying to show him. His mind racing, Richard pulled aside handful after handful of dry dirt, and uncovered just what he had thought it would be. In his dirt-streaked palm, Richard cradled a rusted, old-fashioned key, dented in some places, but still enough in shape to unlock a door. This door… Richard made a dumbfounded sound with his teeth, the revelation streaking his brain like a shooting star. \"Of course!\" he said, grinning. \"Why didn't I see this?\" He looked down at the key, and then at the door, the vines already seeming to fall away from the everlastingly-shut door. \"The garden- the secret garden.\" Keeping the key and the door in his vision, Richard quickly put himself against the wood, placing his hands on it, groping for the doorknob. He knew that robin wouldn't bring him here for nothing. … Chloe and Ryland stood poised a few yards from the door. She was ready with her hair tucked behind her ears, and Ryland beside her. \"All right then. On the count of three, we're going to run for the door, and I will bust it open using some good pushes of telekinetic energy. It may take a while, but…we'll do it!\" \"Tallyho, my lady!\" Ryland shouted out. Chloe then patted her faithful frog friend and took a deep, deep breath. \"Okay, I'm coming. I am going to find you, Richard, if it takes me all time! We will end this war, right now!\" She cracked her knuckles and took the first step, preparing her mind to make the push… … . Richard gasped suddenly. \"Hey,\" he said, looking at the door in awe. \"Someone's in there. And…I think I know that voice…\" She was trapped there, waiting. Now it could only be up to him, and him alone, to free her. Nearly instantly, he felt the creamy softness of her skin in his hand, as though she were close enough to touch… ….just had to unlock the door. With a deep breath of final resolution, Richard clenched the key so tightly he could feel its shape embedding deep in his skin. He readied himself to open the door, ready to see that radiant face and the flames of swirling hair. \"Okay now. No more fooling around! I'm coming in!\" Richard thrust the key from his hand and into the lock. He twisted it quickly, and threw the door open with a last pump of energy. … . Chloe's tension was building by the second, and she couldn't quite bring herself to run for the door. But as she forced herself to step forward, she suddenly was met with a miracle- as though an angel had stepped through the opening, come to wrap her away in joyous arms and take her… The door had opened by itself, the vines holding it to the wall tearing away easily as wet paper. The world opened up beyond the wall; it seemed the flowers were waking up, wavering like they were alive. And in the doorway, was where Chloe's heart just about stopped with overwhelming joy. Richard stood tall, his clothes dirty and slightly tattered from his travels, sword in scabbard, and shield strapped around his back. His physical appearance was haggard and rough, but above all, his eyes still sparkled with colorful radiance, the determination showed through the weariness. Everything else but him and her was gone in an instant; the sun almost began to redirect its rays onto him, like a spotlight. She felt as though she had just stepped up from victory, like she had just been reborn; given another chance; even the urge to sing, or cry, or laugh. There was no better feeling she'd ever had than right there, for in his eyes, she noticed a reflection of her own- determination, hope, and love. \"Oh my god!\" Chloe's energy renewed, she broke into a run for Richard, throwing herself at him like he was a comfy mattress full of books at the end of a hard day. He met her with a tight hold, bracing her against him like a stuffed animal. He pressed his hand down on her back, feeling the silk in her hair, while the other kept itself on the small of her back, where he was sure she would stay close. \"What kept you?\" Chloe asked, breathless in her excitement. \"Hey, you know I could never stay away from you forever,\" Richard said with a chuckle. \"You're the most powerful Proverb, so, it's not like there's a good fight without you.\" \"Well, not without you either,\" Chloe added. \"Our powers combined can go beyond anything evil sorcerers have ever attempted.\" Richard shook his head and pulled Chloe closer, and she gasped with the suddenness. \"Thank god you were here of all places,\" he said, pushing some hair from her face with his hand. \"The adventure section is more dangerous than I remember\"- he chuckled uncomfortably- \"if not the worst.\" Chloe smiled. \"But you made it through, didn't you? And now, we are here at last!\" There was a brief silence, before, tenderly, Richard put a hand on Chloe's cheek. He stroked it with his thumb, his insides fluttering furiously with this new intimacy. But suddenly, all the toils and hardships of the journey evaporated into thin air with just a glance into those green eyes, glittering with the sunlight and a reflection of strong love. Chloe's hands began to take on a life of their own, slowly reaching up through Richard's arms and around his neck, where they stayed. She rested her head on his shoulder, taking in the comfort of his arms' embrace, making up for all the lost times they were apart. She wanted to stay there for good; to feel so completely safe and warm- to keep him in her reach. Then Richard took Chloe by her shoulders and pulled her away so that they were facing each other again. \"Stay very still,\" he told her. Holding her, he began, bit by bit, to lean his face closer to hers. Chloe flinched backward as she realized what was happening, but, upon that epiphany, beat Richard to it. She pressed her lips to his, but gently, like touching butterfly's wings. All over, she felt light as air itself, breathless, as the sun warmed the two of them, surrounded in a little haven where there was only them. Richard felt the radiation of Chloe's magic, the warmth turning her into an angel that could wrap him in her cozy spell forevermore. Chloe could feel, beneath her own, Richard's heart skip many beats in their dual magic, while she held his face in her hands, tracing the tiny wounds beneath her fingertips. Richard pulled his lips away, but kept his hands on the small of Chloe's back. She seemed disappointed that the kiss couldn't go on longer, but she smiled nonetheless. \"Wow,\" Chloe said, giggling shortly. Richard merely looked at her, a tad dazed. He felt his heart slamming his chest, just staring inside the green of Chloe's eyes. In all honesty, he never thought that he would feel something so wonderful- nor tasting the lips of a girl he felt so deeply connected to. Something inside of him was shouting for him to kiss her again, but he didn't lean his face towards her; it was probably better to just keep her own dazed expression in sight. She seemed to think the same thing. But then, just behind Chloe's face, he spotted something shiny and green, hopping through the grass with gentle, steady movements. Large, colorful eyes looked up at him, a tiny croak escaping the creature's throat. \"Oh, hey,\" Richard said, moving to bend towards the little frog on the ground. \"You Chloe's little friend?\" The frog blinked up at Richard, and then proceeded to stand on his hind legs just like a human. He moved his arm in a flourish while he bowed to the grass. \"A little friend, naturally, but now, I find myself in the presence of her precious one. Prince Ryland- at your service.\" \"Richard Tyler,\" Richard said, reaching out his hand to Ryland, who lifted his own webby hand for a shake. All the while, Richard found his eyes wandering around the garden. He took in the poor conditions of the flowers and trees speckling the perimeter, but was surprised to see a patch of green trees, with flowers behind them. Then, when he looked to Chloe's side, another realization came to him. \"Chloe, what happened to Alice?\" he asked, pointing to the empty space beside her. Chloe averted her gaze to Richard, and she released a sharp gasp, her eyes enlarging in her skull. \"Oh, no,\" she whispered, \"I lost her when we boarded the ferry. Just after you fell off the gangplank, I let go of her, and, well, I didn't see her afterwards.\" She shuddered, remembering the pandemonium and terror on the ferry, and now shame that she didn't try harder to find Alice. Their poor little friend was probably lost anywhere in the library by now, and all alone. Remembering how much Alice had come to depend on them, Chloe felt her eyes sting, and her shoulders slumping. For a moment, Richard could feel Chloe's inner deflation, and then, inside of himself. He didn't like thinking that he and Chloe could be responsible for anything bad that could happen to Alice, and especially that she was without protection. \"I promised her…\" Richard found himself whispering. With an unexpected grunt, Chloe quickly straightened herself, sweeping her fallen hair from her eyes. \"Well, we cannot expect Alice to straighten out her own story. We'll just have to get to the rotunda, and settle it there with the villains!\" The power of Chloe's statement brought butterflies to Richard's stomach. This was it. It was finally time to return to the center of the library, and end it. \"Then what are we just standing here for?\" Ryland said, hopping excitedly into Chloe's open hand. \"We should journey there this instant!\" \"I know what to do,\" Richard said, pointing at an empty space by the trees. \" The Wizard of Oz books, the magic flying Gump !\" In a second, there materialized a strange contraption, one that made Ryland gasp with awe, and almost fall from Chloe's hand. Two old fashioned couches were tied together, making a large enclosed seat, where, on either side, two great and thick palm leaves sprouted. At the head of the contraption, was an elk's head, his face speckled with billy goat-like whiskers. From behind the two couches, a broom waved, its twigs snapping gently, moving about just like a tail. The elk, who had previously been like a stuffed bust, opened its eyes, and looked at the group with astonishment. \"Hello,\" it said, its voice squeaky. \"What a surprise to see you all here.\" \"And another surprise to see you ,\" Ryland replied, pointing his webbed hand at the Gump. \"Can you fly us somewhere, if we can tell you where?\" Chloe asked, stepping forth. The Gump nodded its head. \"Of course. I know who you are; I'd know that red hair anywhere. You're the Proverbs!\" \"Yes,\" Chloe answered, climbing into the seat; she gestured for Richard to climb aboard as well. \"Has the word been spreading about us?\" \"More than you can hope to believe,\" the Gump said. \"All the good people of the Pagemaster's kingdom are gathering to support you all against the bad and evil. I hope you appreciate that.\" Chloe nodded. \"Yes. Come on, we don't have much time to lose. Let's go!\" Then, the palm leaves of the Gump started to flap furiously, stirring the grass and weeds, slowly taking to the sky. Chloe removed her magic compass from her pocket, and, following the needle's point, directed the Gump to fly as they all disappeared from sight of the secret gardens.[Chapter 15] Chapter 15 The Gump was a faithful helper to the group, and a much faster flyer than even Chloe expected. At the speed with which the great palm wings were flapping, it was difficult to distinguish which stories they were flying over. Not that it mattered much to either Richard or Chloe; they were finally going back to the rotunda, where surely they could quickly carry out their duties to the Pagemaster against the villains, and then go back home. But once Richard contemplated the thought, he felt it'd be kind of strange not being able to bring books to life; he bet that Chloe would be sad to not manipulate imaginative forces the next time someone told her she was a weirdo. For every minute of their flight, neither Richard nor Chloe spoke many words. Even Ryland was pretty quiet, while the Gump went on and on about how thousands of fiction heroes were starting to congregate within the rotunda, preparing for the great battle that many were anticipating. Accordingly, if the Proverbs returned on time, it would be the first time in centuries that they, and the Pagemaster, would join forces and fight for the order of the library. And so every hero and heroine from each section was polishing their armor, sharpening their blades, and continually swearing their allegiance to the Pagemaster and all his associates in the Binding Order. For is all worked out, there would be a new pair of saviors on the Pagemaster's team… The more the Gump spoke of the coming fight, the more Richard found himself watching the ground blurring by below them. He wondered if maybe all the cottages and castles and such were empty- that their good inhabitants were already in the rotunda, bearing swords and bows to defend their side of fiction. It was suddenly peculiar to think that soon they would really be fighting. Richard had spent so long journeying through the library, he had difficulty believing that the climax was coming for real. If he and Chloe fulfilled their purpose in coming to the library, then everything would all be over. But, what if they didn't? After all that they had worked for- in braving strange and unusual forces, coming face-to-face with death, and losing one another twice- was it still possible for the villains to win in the end? Of course, all the villains knew that the Proverbs were back, and that they were powerful people. Richard knew first-hand that there would be villains who would fight to their death to destroy either him or Chloe, and that they could easily rein in more people in their goal. The idea of fighting to protect not only his own life, but Chloe's life and the well-being of all of fiction, sent chills shaking in Richard's limbs, and he shivered briefly. Hopefully, he could always keep Chloe by his side in the fighting… \"We're almost there, friends,\" the Gump's high voice spoke up, and Chloe and Ryland dashed to the very front of the seat. Shaking her hair from her face, Chloe shot her finger ecstatically towards the horizon. In the instant, Richard felt a sharp puff of air shake his body. As fast as the air had whooshed across his skin, the scenery changed. In the near distance, a colorful city- surrounded by a bright green jungle, adjacent to an enormous valley and a vast ocean- stuck out amongst the rocky terrain. The tall towers of a castle in the very center sparkled in the high sun, and just slightly, Richard could make out the etchings of books into the towers' sides. There had never been a lovelier- or more frightening- sight. … The Gump landed with a thump outside the castle, its palm leaf wings folding slowly into the two couches, quivering with the trip. Nonetheless, the elk head still thanked them for a pleasant trip, and bowed respectfully while its passengers touched the ground. \"The Proverbs have returned!\" Both Richard and Chloe gasped with the loud voice that rang out in the air, jumping back into the Gump, who in turn yelped. A trumpet fanfare sang straight after the voice, and like puppets on a stage, people were poking out of the castle windows and any nearby vicinity. Their faces appeared excited one second, and the next they were gone, while the strange silence prolonged. Suddenly, there was uproar of noise as every face appeared again, clapping their hands and cheering like they were watching a holiday parade, rather than two surprised teenagers that stayed in place, collapsed in shock against the Gump. The castle looked like a moving picture as thousands of pairs of hands clapped outside the windows, whooping and yelling. Richard and Chloe didn't know how to react. This was all such a shock, and they were both so glad to be back, that they just watched while more and more onlookers yelled and clapped their hands. Some of them started to emerge from their hiding places, racing towards the Proverbs like they had crossed the finish line to the winning race. It was unbelievable; the shouting and cheering drowned out even their own thoughts, and all of a sudden, a little halo of fairy dust was cast all around the space as a tiny speck of pink light zoomed through the air. It was followed by another of yellow, then black, and then whole other colors of magical sparks, raining down on the reveling like sparkly confetti. While Chloe reached out a hand to collect the dust in her hands, she was surprised to see a little red-headed woman in a pink dress with flowers in her hair fly up. She had such a wide smile that she must have been seeing a miracle unfolding. Richard knew that pink dress and glowing red hair anywhere. \"Peaseblossom!\" Richard looked on at the blossom-colored fairy, not knowing whether he should suffocate her in a hug, or just stare at her, seeing and knowing that she had survived the battle at the tower. In turn, Peaseblossom laid eyes on Richard, and her expression also went wide with unsuppressed joy, her bright, large eyes throwing happy sparkles into Richard's face. The pink halo of magic surrounding her head enlarged, tingling with almost electrical energy, while her face turned a bright rose-red. Richard expected her to break out in an almost hysterical Shakespearian speech describing her eternal gratefulness that her friend was alive. She opened her mouth to expose her gleaming teeth, but instead, she threw herself forward to Richard's face. Touching her tiny hands to his cheek, she leaned in and gently pecked his skin with her lips, feeling like the soft brush of a butterfly's wing. Richard couldn't help but chuckle when Peaseblossom hovered before him, her face now scarlet, and her eyes wet. \"Mine eyes hath never seen so gay a sight!\" she finally sang out. \"My dearest lord hath seen the light of day after all. But, soft. What lady do I see? It is the lady Chloe, and the sun of her beauty still shines upon this day! Oh, joy!\" \"It's good to see you too, Peaseblossom,\" Chloe said, smiling sweetly, while the fairy also laid a little kiss on her cheek. \"Ay, but we must not make waste out of precious, time. Make with all haste!\" the little fairy quickly said. \"The world hath seen your homecoming, but the Pagemaster doth not know of your sight as of yet. The truth must be shed, to know the fighting must commence!\" Before Richard or Chloe could question her, Peaseblossom gestured wildly for them to follow her, and they were pushed along by Mustardseed, Cobweb, and the other nameless fairies. The cheering crowds parted while the two Proverbs were led away, many of the onlookers bowing or curtsying to them, although neither Richard nor Chloe paid much attention. It was still too hard to believe that they were finally back to the rotunda- it was almost like coming home again after all that happened. All the way to the Pagemaster's magical headquarters, Peaseblossom and the fairies led them. Even at the doors to the enormous throne room, there was a great crowd of people cheering and screaming ecstatically while Richard and Chloe approached. But when they did, the crowd broke apart just like outside, and the huge emblem on the door showed itself. The intertwining of vines and snakes, with an open book amidst the chaotic engraving, stuck out against the dark wood, towering over everyone like a strong country flag. Both Richard and Chloe peered for a long time at the symbol, letting the distant memories of seeing it- back before they knew that they even were Proverbs- sink in, before the doors parted, the symbol broke in half while the doorway opened. Straight ahead of them, on the grand throne surrounded by Pages, between the walls carved to look like the spines of books, stood the wizened old Pagemaster, who stood quickly upon seeing his comrades at the door, making the book pages of his robes glitter. For a long minute, from opposite ends of the long carpet, they stared at each other. Richard felt almost as though it had been another six years since he had seen that face, while Chloe's heart hammered excitedly like a bongo. Once more, it felt like they had traveled a long way just to see their kindly friend again, to watch while his wise eyes glowed, and his arms slowly outstretched to welcome them back home. Even with the gesture given, it was still quiet as a church, with the Pages and miscellaneous nobles watching for their master and the long-lost Proverbs to meet for another time. Finally, the Pagemaster's mouth, hidden by his long white beard, opened. \"Come to me, my comrades.\" His voice was low and warm. Not wasting a bit of time, Richard and Chloe started down the carpet, their steps increasing the closer that they got to the Pagemaster's throne. The farther they walked, the wider the Pagemaster's overjoyed smile became, and the brighter his eyes shown. The mix of relief and surprise in both Proverbs' eyes mirrored the Pagemaster's almost exactly, and it took much of Chloe's concentration to not break into a run for the throne, like a little girl at the airport while she runs to her grandfather. Richard couldn't quite believe it, but he was almost thinking the same thing. In the next moments, Richard, Chloe, and the Pagemaster faced each other, neither side knowing quite how to express their relief at this reunion. Still they kept their joyful expressions- all seeming to shine throughout the room, before Chloe finally stepped forth. And she wrapped her arms around the Pagemaster's torso, making the pages in his robes glitter and crinkle, creating music once again. In her excitement at being back, there was not a lovelier sound right then. The Pagemaster patted Chloe's back, grinning down at her. \"Lady Chloe\"- he said the name like Richard imagined Mr. Dewey would have said to her- \"it only feels like we've just met.\" \"Really? It seems like it's been an eternity,\" Chloe said, not looking up. The Pagemaster looked between her and Richard, pride gleaming in his eyes. \"Then, again, perhaps it has. Still, I can say nothing, except that I am glad to see the both of you back again. Surviving the dangers of the sections is no easy feat, even for a young man and woman with extraordinary abilities.\" Richard laughed. \"Yeah, you can say that again. We lost each other twice, and got tossed around like it was nobody's business, and-\" \"You were also tossed and squashed,\" the Pagemaster interjected. \"But I do hope you were not frightened to death of braving my kingdom to seek the answer to those shadow creatures.\" The Pagemaster chuckled, while Richard gave him a look. \"That's exactly what you said to me after your previous journey,\" the Pagemaster explained. \"Dear boy, you learned so much last time. I hope this was the same experience for you.\" Richard nodded his head. In fact, now that he thought of it, he could remember every word he had spit in the Pagemaster's face after having been through the library once. The first time it had been frightening. But this journey had been no exception, and if the Pagemaster thought that was a joke, he was pretty well mistaken. \"You could say it was,\" Richard finally said. \"Needless to say, I'm proud,\" the Pagemaster said. \"It's not only me who rejoices in seeing you both here. Every hero in the library sings their praises to this day. It marks the beginning of the end of this war.\" \"The final battle is really that close, now?\" Chloe asked, breaking out of her hug. \"We shall see, my child,\" the Pagemaster replied. \"But now, we should commence to a conference, and discuss our next move. For now that our two best assets have come back, it is more likely that word shall spread to the villains that you have surely conquered.\" \"We did fight a lot of villains,\" Richard said. \"You know about the fight that broke out in the horror section, right?\" \"Word got back to me soon enough, I assure you,\" the Pagemaster replied. \"Sir Hugo lived to tell me, and he also managed to bring along a few helpers in the meantime. Although, I'm afraid now that most villains have come to know of your existence, and that you have conquered so many of them, they won't be willing to wait in destroying you. That is why we must be sure that we have as many helpers as we can find, and that the both of you are willing to fight in a real war that may mean the difference between the life, and the death, of both worlds.\"[Chapter 16] Chapter 16 Moments later, when the crowd had dispersed from the halls, and the news had finally settled that the Proverbs had returned alive from their adventures, Richard, Chloe, the Pagemaster, and Sir Hugo had settled into a long table, courtesy of the Pagemaster's magic robe pages. He sat at the head, with Richard and Chloe on either side. Sir Hugo sat next to Richard, with Jip- barking and panting so much with excitement that Sir Hugo had to tell him to lay down- beside his chair. In the beginning they were the only ones there, although the Pagemaster told them they were expecting more. Indeed, when they had been sitting there for barely five minutes, the doors parted again, and another crowd waited, led by a robust man in a red-and-gold captain's uniform. At his side, he carried a scabbard holding a sword, and a golden sash was slung over his chest. His hair was sleek and dark, although it flecked grey, framing his hawk-like eyes. \"General Spinet.\" The Pagemaster stood up, and greeted the tall, round man, who bowed in turn. \"Your High Pageness,\" the general said, while his followers bowed altogether. \"You called for me; and some of your most important followers?\" The Pagemaster moved to gesture towards the chairs all along the table. \"Come and sit down, all of you.\" Following the Pagemaster's orders, General Spinet took his seat, and one by one, Richard and Chloe could see who had showed up. Behind Spinet, came Robin Hood, in his usual forest-green and brown, his bow slung over his back; Peaseblossom and her fairy companions, followed by King Oberon and Queen Titania, who, despite the grimaces they exchanged, looked proud to be in the Pagemaster's presence. The black cat slunk after, directing a proud expression at Chloe with his bright blue eyes. With dirty boots and raggedy clothing, Candy, George, and the other farmhands from the Salinas Valley trudged in, accompanied by a young man whom neither of the Proverbs recognized. He gave Chloe a bright smile before he sat down, giving no other indication as to who he was. Once everyone had surrounded the table, the Pagemaster stood up again, holding his hands up high. As if he had clapped very loudly, everyone gave him their undivided attention, including Richard and Chloe. \"Welcome. It's a pleasure seeing you together during such dreadful times,\" he said. \"For the good of our higher ruler, 'tis the least we could come to do,\" Titania stated, in her high, musical voice. \"Thank you, my queen,\" the Pagemaster said. \"Now, I assume you are aware of why I've selected you to be here?\" \"Tha', is 'cause we've become personally acquainted wi' the Proverbs,\" Candy piped up. \"And because we have seen what special, extraordinary things they can do with their powers,\" the cat added. \"Precisely,\" said the Pagemaster. \"And it is for that matter in particular, that I'm requesting each and every one of you, to be at the front line with Richard and Chloe. We will need all the help we can get, with the use of your special talents.\" Robin Hood took off his hat and bowed his head. \"It's already done, my Pagemaster,\" he said. \"We have all pledged our everlasting allegiance to the lord and lady.\" \"Aye,\" said the fairies altogether, Peaseblossom's voice standing out among them. \"Small in size may we be, but the enemy blade is no such match.\" \"And, if I may be so bold,\" Oberon said in his low, booming voice. \"'Tis not out of arrogance I speak, but my servants' magical talent- and I, and my queen wife besides- very well have the capability to break morale of those brutes, should any of them cross our ways!\" He puffed out his chest, and snapped his fingers to create a dangerous spark of magic, leaving some white smoke to drift away. \"I'll lead my Merry Men into the fray with our bows and arrows,\" Robin Hood suggested, touching his bow and quiver. The cat jumped up to the table before anyone else could speak, flicking and curling its tail somewhat proudly. \"While I'd prefer not to fight, I can't say I will throw away my pledge to our protectors.\" It flexed its long claws, and swiped them in a harsh circle; much to the surprise of even the Pagemaster, there was a shing! in the air as if it were a sword, and not the cat's claw. It was a pretty impressive sound, so it left no doubt in anyone's mind about the cat's part in the fighting. All eyes turned to Candy and George and the other farmhands. \"Well, I 'ave no big idea o' the weapons we could put t' use,\" Candy spoke up. \"Unless…unless, er…we got some of those guns, like on th' farm. I dunno. 'Course, we don' know how t' handle one o' your swords an' stuff…\" He scrunched his wrinkled face in deep thought, and the farmhands didn't hesitate to follow. Spinet's small eyes gleamed, and he stood from his chair. \"Perhaps this would be an opportune time for you rough gentlemen. You see, in my spare time, I've been working with some of the best Pages to make a weapon that could aid us just as much as any of our choice fighting tools. If I may say so myself, I think it's a pretty impressive piece of work.\" \"Well, by all means, show it to us,\" the Pagemaster stated, excitement hidden beneath his calm demeanor. \"Will you get it for His High Pageness?\" General Spinet asked to the Page standing at the door, and he dashed off, coming back no more than ten seconds later with an object that strangely resembled a metal plunger, about the length of someone's arm. Richard's face went lopsided, wondering what on earth Spinet could do with such a strange thing- maybe suction-cup someone to death? \"Let me demonstrate,\" Spinet said, kindly taking the red-and-gold colored contraption from the Page. \"Unfortunately, I haven't come up with a name for this weapon, but you can all rest assured that it is as powerful as anything.\" He moved his finger toward a latch on one end. Oberon stood up excitedly, without waiting for Spinet to carry out his demonstration. \"Mayhap I enchant them,\" he said. \"Single a villain's touch to thy artillery, and certain death awaits!\" Titania grabbed her husband's arm, shoving him back into his seat. \"No, dearest husband,\" she hissed. \"Never a day will I allow death for such silly pleasure.\" \"No such thing as pleasure here,\" Oberon said. \"The thriving matter is merely victory for the hands of our Pagemaster.\" Spinet grinned. \"Not such a terrible idea, Majesty, but it might be too late to enchant all of our ammunition with deadly magic. As far as we know the villains have mobilized as much as we have…\" Oberon looked defeated; Titania just grinned. \"But…when will we fight?\" Jip spoke up, leaping onto the table to see the Pagemaster better. \"It would seem that we are all ready for it, but when will we meet our match?\" He twitched his nose excitedly, panting like he was ready to march onto a battlefield at that instant. \"The way I see it, we ought to keep ourselves on the battlefield until they show up,\" said the unrecognizable young man from down the table. \"If the villains are so ready to fight us as soon as they can, they know where we shall be. And if we are set for a great battle, then I say, why not begin tomorrow?\" Chloe couldn't stop the next word from coming out. \"Ryland!\" \"Yes, it's me, my good lady,\" he said. \"Through the magic of our Pagemaster, I was returned to my rightful form, so that I may fight alongside the Proverbs for the order of all we hold dearest. I've pledged my service to the Binding Order, and I don't intend to give up until those who have done us wrong are begging for our mercy.\" \"Here, here!\" shouted everyone at the table. \"Not a terrible suggestion, Prince Ryland,\" the Pagemaster said. \"But first, I feel I must know who is leading the villains?\" \"We know who it is,\" Richard said. \"It's Professor Moriarty, and Count Dracula. They've been keeping armies of the red wizards and the shadow creatures that kidnapped Chloe.\" \"Not to mention they led the attack against us at the battle in the horror section,\" Sir Hugo said. The Pagemaster was silent for a moment. \"Not surprising,\" he said. \"But should we commence the battling in the daytime, then the Count cannot fight. He cannot show himself to the sunlight.\" \"Then the advantage might be taken,\" Sir Hugo said. \"A criminal mastermind with no magical power may not be an effective leader.\" \"But the red wizards and the shadow creatures will surely listen to him,\" Chloe stated. \"They may make him a hundred times more powerful than he is normally.\" \"What do we do then?\" Jip wanted to know. \"Well, as long as we still have clear heads and good willpower, we can do it no problem,\" Richard said. \"That's what my baseball coach always tells us before we play a game.\" \"Well, this ain't baseball, kid,\" George said. \"It's war- life or death for our side o' this world. An' yours too!\" \"We're not going to let anything bad happen!\" Richard said, looking directly at George. \"I think we know what we're doing, me and Chloe. We're the Proverbs, besides. So long as we can stick together by you guys, nothing can stop us! I have confidence in every single one of you.\" The cat purred loudly. \"Good to know that we can be entrusted with the fate of our world,\" he said softly. Then, there came a low hissing sound from not too far off, followed by a harsh whooshing. All eyes looked around the room for the source of the noise, the Pagemaster grabbing his staff, and the Proverbs opening their magical minds. Chloe could hear the cat hiss, and Jip start to bark. Swiftly, emerging from out of nowhere, a dark, inky shadow, which shifted and morphed like a water drop, shot through the air. Titania yelped as she lifted her hands to cast a spell, while Oberon left in her path. Spinet lifted his invention like a gun, closing one eye to aim, and Robin Hood readied his bow. Richard didn't even have to prompt Chloe. She closed her eyes, ready to flex her mind- tell the shadow creature to go away… \" Listen to me, Proverbs,\" said a voice. All movement ceased when they heard the shadow creature start to speak, while it still hovered in the air. \" I come with news from one Professor James Moriarty, and one Count Dracula. They say that they will not wait to play around with you all no longer. They have gathered all their comrades, and have readily prepared them to fight. There is no more time left to wait. They eagerly await for the Pagemaster, and his own army, to meet them in the rotunda for the next stage of this war. Prepare your Proverbs as best you can…Your High Pageness…especially the one with the imagination. Her grandfather may have been the Prince, but her kind shall pay for destroying him. No remorse will be felt for killing her, or her hero friend. He may have visited once before, but that makes no difference. No matter how many heroes you may gather, we will still conquer you. We would wish you luck, but it's much easier to walk away. Farewell…for now.\" The shadow creature vanished into thin air. No one in the room spoke, not even the Pagemaster. Everyone remained in position, still holding their weapons. It was almost like they expected the villains' army to come crashing through the doors at any moment, though a few more minutes went by without spoken words. Gulping, Richard reached for Chloe's hand, and grasped it tightly. \"I guess there's no use trying to soften the situation, Chloe,\" he said. \"They will come for us, and they're not going to wait.\" He sighed deeply, the resolution pouring like cold honey through him, while he pecked a kiss on her lips. \"Godspeed, Chloe.\"[Chapter 17] Chapter 17 From across their tent, Richard and Chloe could smell the poison drifting off of the projectiles- like a runner's shoe in the middle of summer with rotten eggs mashed into the mix- certainly not pleasant. Together, with the rest of the Binding Order, the two Proverbs prepared their armor, sparking gold and silvery white in the promising sunlight from outside. Richard was covered from his shoulders to his feet in golden armor, while at his side, he clasped his sword in a bejeweled, velvet scabbard; and on the other, he held a large and heavy helmet, also golden, with an elaborate engraving of the emblem on the Pagemaster's door. Chloe's armor was a tad less elaborate, looking like a well-prepared biker with knee, shoulder, and elbow pads all made of silver, with two ornate breastplates that extended to her waistline. Hanging over the back of her loose white dress, her hair was pulled back into a low ponytail in a tight white ribbon. And strapped over her shoulder was her quiver, with the bow tucked among the arrows, clanking as she moved to tighten her armor and straighten her skirts. After a while, Richard and Chloe had their weapons- polished and tweaked to be like new- listening to General Spinet and Sir Hugo calling the soldiers in their tent to attention. \"Good work, gentlemen!\" Spinet said, greeting them. \"The time has come- there is no turning. We all know what we must do?\" Every soldier raised his sword or lethal book weapon, and saluted as one. \"Victory!\" they all cried together. \"Very good, men! We have assembled, and thus, defeat must ring in the minds of the horrid fiends on the other side of the valley. We are going out. Long live the Pagemaster!\" \"Long live the Pagemaster!\" the other soldiers cried out repeatedly. Both Richard and Chloe swallowed hard while they started to follow the other soldiers out of the tent. They all stepped back, to allow the two Proverbs to take the lead alongside Spinet, Sir Hugo, and Robin Hood. Standing together, they led their army away from the campsite, while the soldiers marched in sync with each other, their steps making a soft crunching on the flimsy grass of the dense jungle. They stared right ahead, keeping straight faces; for Richard and Chloe, not so much. Chloe forced deep breaths into her throat, her excitement and anxiousness fluctuating like the chink-chank of their armor. Richard did the same, wobbling nervously on his feet, sometimes brushing against the hard shoulder pads Chloe wore, so that she had to push him back in line with her free hand. Both Proverbs were so lost in thought however, that they nearly stumbled over the edge of the cliff the army now stood at. Down below them was the vast field, surrounded by the clusters of book-sprouting trees and flowers. The tall weeds tumbled to and fro in the breeze, and not a villain soldier in sight. Richard glanced all around, observing the scene. \"They can't possibly not show up,\" he said, half to himself. \"You heard what the shadow creature informed us of, boy,\" Sir Hugo answered him. \"We will fight on this day. I believe both sides of the kingdom have had it with all this willy-nilly fighting.\" \"Could not agree more,\" Ryland said, stamping his bow against the ground. \"Look!\" Richard turned away from Sir Hugo to see where Chloe was pointing. Over the edge of the valley, like a ship on the horizon, came a roaring of battle cries. A new army- in dark ominous blue- rushed forward like a great tsunami, waving swords and shields high in the air, crying out loudly enough that Richard couldn't hear himself whisper \"They've come…\" At the head of the great expanse of soldiers, Moriarty stood atop a great horse, holding a sword bigger than he was tall. His armor had sharp spikes jutting out from the padding, with a large black smudge on the side of his helmet, where the Pagemaster's emblem should have been. Then on either side of Richard, he noticed universal movement as soldier after soldier pulled down their helmets, brandished their swords, and stood stick-straight in their places. Richard and Chloe followed the soldiers, putting on their helmets, and pulling out their weapons, poised to attack. They both turned their heads, waiting for General Spinet. With his helmet mask over his face, he raised his sword out towards the field. At his signal, the entire front line- Robin Hood, Oberon, Titania, the fairies, the cat, the farmhands, and Jip- raised their own weapons to the sky, keeping silent. Chloe aimed her bow at the army below, pointed directly at Moriarty. Richard raised his sword out furthest towards the field, and at this signal, the whole army cried out towards the villains, as though daring them to come closer. Finally, Richard took a deep breath, and looked to Chloe, then the valley of war below. \"Go!\" they screamed out together. \"Hail the Pagemaster! Hail the fallen Proverb!\" The rest of their army chanted those words while they pumped their weapons above their heads. Chloe shut her eyes. A rumbling sounded from within the ledge as an explosive pop caused the cliff to tumble downward, and form a long ramp into the battlefield. It settled deep into the earth, battering the ground before the Pagemaster's army charged down the ramp. Richard, Chloe, Sir Hugo, General Spinet, Ryland, and George leapt off the ledge and onto six flying carpets, while Oberon and Titania stayed aloft to cast defensive magic with the other fairies. Cries were magnified in the surrounding valley when the armies clashed; swords clanged and drove together, echoing all around. The flying carpets made a wide circle around the battle, and their pilots fired down at the sea of bright red-and-gold, and dark blue. Chloe shot arrows one after the other, while Richard used the forces of Stephen King's Firestarter to make enormous fireballs fly from his hands, zipping like comets to the earth, with thunderous explosions that shook the whole valley. Meanwhile, the other flyers dashed through the air, swiping at the throats of their enemies, leaving them lying gruesomely on the ground. Then Chloe stopped shooting her arrows, and directed her carpet to fly with Richard's. Under her control, little ice stalactites began to tumble beside the fireballs, turning and twirling around in flight to hit their exact targets. Among the rubble and explosions, she spotted Moriarty. He was fighting with all his might, slashing anyone that came within a five-foot radius of him. He seemed a skilled fighter, but didn't have the flying power that the heroes had as they zigzagged around him, clashing swords and firing Spinet's book-blade weapons. George touched his finger to a latch on his book-blade, and a tiny book the size of a quarter zipped out of the other end. The steel book flew like a bullet, slashing out sickle-shaped blades that twirled with intense velocity, zipping through wooden rods and iron helmets like they were toothpicks. When he fired again, the steel dome on the firing end broke apart, forming something like a flower, with seven separate pieces fanned out. The petal-like things were enormous, almost the size of an umbrella, and spun like helicopter propellers. A thick green gas started to come off the whirling petals, causing the villains nearby to cough and sputter, some even losing their consciousness. The other farmhands were firing from their weapons as well, coating their paths in the dense fumes. Unfortunately, Moriarty was able to deflect each projectile, twirling his sword like a baton, while some of the red wizards stepped into his path to protect him! Taking a breath, Chloe prepared to attack- make him pay one more time for what misery he and Dracula caused her. She shut her eyes and imagined, with the greatest capacity of her mind, a massive boulder- one that had spikes, covered in hot flames, and sharp edges that could cut even stone. She stood on her knees, and hurled her hand down towards Moriarty, catching herself before she nearly fell off her carpet. But when she was so sure the boulder would fall on him, it exploded into a million pieces, several of them coming back towards her and Richard. With a quick reflex, a shield of energy surrounded the two Proverbs, deflecting the flying rocks. Chloe stood up, as did Richard, looking down at the fighting. She glared deeply when she noticed that the team of red wizards in front of Moriarty had multiplied in the face of her attack. Richard turned to Chloe. \"We have to go lower,\" he said, swiftly. \"We have a better target if we can be up close!\" But then his eyes darted away, clearly afraid of what he had just proposed. \"Not if we combine our powers and stay behind my shield,\" Chloe added. Richard gripped his weapon tighter while their carpets soared downward into the fighting. From her hands, Chloe shot rays of electricity, sending shocks through any blue-armored soldier in their way. Beside her, Richard hurled fireballs, then boulders, alternating as their carpets zipped in all directions. It was hard to hold on and keep their powers focused, but they managed to cover nearly the entire battlefield before Moriarty's voice crossed their ears again. \"Give up! Give up the battle!\" he cried after them. \"We will conquer the humans. Your homes will be vanquished, and so shall the rest of the wretched, incompetent creatures that murdered…\" \" SHUT UP! \" Chloe screamed as she swerved her carpet around. She stood up, unsheathed a dagger and leapt from the carpet. Throwing herself downward, she twirled in the air and prepared to plunge her dagger into Moriarty's throat! The dastardly man was stupid to think he could conquer humanity-so very, very WRONG! She didn't care if he was a literary character that might disappear altogether if he was killed; not even if his stories vanished from history because of it- so long as he would never say another word of her grandfather! She was on top of him, she was sure. But before she could tap her dagger's blade to his throat, she was thrown aside by an unstoppable force, as though pushed by a glass door. Slammed to the ground, she struggled to regain her footing through all the fighting around her, finally managing it, but was knocked down once more by the same kind of force. \"You want to embarrass me,\" a low, innocent voice whispered. Chloe's heart hammered in her chest, as a chunky girl in a blood-drenched dress stepped out from the fray. \"No! No!\" Chloe pleaded. \"No, Carrie! Carrie, you don't want to do this!\" \"I really believe I do,\" Carrie said in the same low, innocent monotone. \"You're embarrassing us all in this war. Those other humans in the world killed the third Proverb. They don't deserve to go on.\" \"What did I try to tell you, Carrie?\" Chloe said, although she could already sense the uselessness of her words. \"If you have been treated poorly, just forget and forgive. You can do it!\" \"You push me around too much,\" Carrie said, shaking her head. \"What they did to me was immoral and bad. It was…was…sinful. Mama would have said that too.\" \"Forget them all,\" Chloe commanded. \"You can change now if you will just hear me out. You won't get any better by fighting for evil. Just, please…\" \"Stop it,\" Carrie snarled. She opened her eyes wide, and suddenly Chloe was thrown off her feet again, knocked against the side of the ramp. Carrie advanced upon Chloe, using her telekinesis to throw her victim around like a rag doll. Chloe kept her dagger clenched in her hand in case Carrie threw her towards Moriarty, but heart-stopping shocks continually seized her the more she tried to resist Carrie's power- like she was in the air after jumping off a swing and then falling back down again. She was finally able to get back on her feet, after the strange sensations died away. Chloe was ready to throw herself back in, when she saw two flying carpets soaring away, with Carrie on the ground as if she had been brutally shoved. Then when the carpets swooped down a second time, a hand reached out, and plucked Chloe from the ground. Richard threw her behind him and steered the carpets back down for another blow. \"No, Richard, don't!\" Chloe cried out. \"She tried to hurt you!\" Richard said. \"I won't let her do it again!\" \"Let her go!\" Chloe pleaded, tugging on Richard's sleeve. \"Stop, we have to go back to Moriarty. He's the one who has to go!\" Richard didn't answer her, and instead flew towards the ground, noticing Carrie's bloody dress amid the soldiers whirling around her. Richard held his sword out as the carpets loomed closer, and Chloe sent a glowing ball of energy towards the body of red, just before Richard's blade could pierce her heart any further… The carpets zipped a fast curve before turning around again. Chloe nearly lost her place, but looked back. Carrie was getting up again, pushing her hands against Chloe's energy bubble, just like a mime in an invisible box. She rapidly caused it to explode with her telekinesis, and snapped her gaze towards the flying carpets. For a second, Chloe's worried gaze met hers, and throughout the blurry moments that followed, she eyes never left the telekinetic girl. Richard swooped lower for another attack on the villain soldiers. But then, a bright cloud of smoke and rock bits slowly penetrated the bubble, coming into Richard's and Chloe's vision- like one sees someone creeping up out of the corner of their eyes. A blinding light accompanied the rocks, confusing them for a moment- -what could penetrate the energy bubble, and who could have caused that? But without their even knowing it, their bodies were touching nothing beneath them but open air, free-falling in whatever direction they were going. In the explosions around them, up or down didn't mean anything… The ground hit them like a punch to the face, slapping them silly against the flattened grass. Chloe's senses were blown out from the impact, pushed for a split second into unconsciousness. She was thrown from it when she heard a familiar cry pierce the darkness of her fall. Slowly standing up, she saw Richard nearby, stumbling onto his feet. He was wincing, teetering while he held his arm, which was drenched with a dark maroon liquid, oozing through his white sleeve and onto his bleeding leg. Like a lash to her face, the world was starting to slow…[Chapter 18] Chapter 18 Desperately, Chloe shook her head, and looked around for whoever had caused Richard's fresh pain. She was met with a deep hatred when she saw her - smiling maniacally, the last ounce of her innocence gone forever. Chloe lunged for Carrie, throwing her dagger at a flap of ripped, bloody fabric. The blade pierced the silk, pulling Carrie back with such force that she stumbled into the ramp behind-first. Chloe rushed up to her, encasing herself in a hard blanket of energy that weighed her down tremendously, and took the dagger from the earth, pointing it at Carrie's face. \"I should have known it!\" Chloe shouted. \"I should've known from the beginning that those powers of yours poisoned you! Well, then, should I do it, or should I fetch your monster of a mother to do it for me?\" \"Mama?\" Carrie asked, the evil fading for a second. \"Yes, 'Mama'!\" Chloe crooned, her anger flowing from her like liquid fire. \"But she's dead, and if you dare lay a telekinetic finger on Richard again, I swear to you that you'll meet the same heart-stopping end!\" Carrie shivered for a moment, not daring to use her powers against Chloe. The dagger was there- the Proverb could kill her right then and there, finishing it all. \"Mama…Tommy…all of them.\" Carrie was whispering all this to herself, but Chloe could hear every word, thinking it was a diversion for when Carrie would try to kill her. But the telekinetic girl stood still, and the longer she did, the tighter Chloe clenched her dagger. \"You miss them, don't you?\" Chloe finally asked. Carrie nodded, bowing her head. Taking a breath, Chloe relaxed her grip on her dagger, lowering it. \"All right,\" she said. \"I'll let you go. But one more touch of any of the soldiers, even with your powers, and you can use this for practice!\" She pointed with her head to the dagger's sharp point. Chloe didn't give Carrie's sorry face another glance before running away to find Richard; she was glad to be rid of Carrie's power, but she didn't think for very long. A villain's sword slashed at her, and she ducked into a little plateau beneath the ramp. To Chloe's surprise, Richard lay in the farthest corner. His helmet was off, sword off to the side, and his hands on his wounds to stop the bleeding. Little streams of red gently ran along his hands, while he viciously bit his lip to keep from screaming out. Chloe imagined for him some large bandages, and a tall glass of water. She held him still while he chugged down the cold liquid, but he gasped when he swallowed the last drop, grabbing Chloe by her shoulder. He pulled her to him and held her, but not lightly. It was as though the glorious feeling of his lips on her smooth hair would give him renewed strength, enough to make him last the rest of the battle- forever, even. She kissed him back, only glad that he had survived for this long without help. \"Chloe,\" Richard said, squeezing her. \"Thank god you're alive.\" \"And I you,\" Chloe said, sitting back up. \"But you won't last for much longer out there with those wounds. This is no ordinary cut you can get from a baseball mishap.\" She closed her eyes, and kept her hands in Richards to keep him calm, as she pictured the wounds healing- stitching back up by themselves to stop the bleeding. Richard grunted with unease, but Chloe just gripped his hands tighter. She was tense, dripping with sweat under her heavy armor, her immense hope for Richard making her shake enough to almost wet herself. Richard shook Chloe on her shoulder to awaken her from her imaginative zone-out. Luckily, the bleeding had stopped, but the wounds were still gaping open. \"You'll be all right?\" Chloe asked, quickly wrapping a bandage around each tiny laceration. \"I think so. Thank you, Chloe,\" Richard said, reaching for her. She leaned in too, and pressed her entire body against him; it felt so good to be near him like this, to see better that he was there to protect her like a faithful guardian. Well, seeing that he was in fact her guardian… \"Take care of yourself out there,\" Richard said to Chloe while they headed out together. \"I can still die for you,\" she countered. \"Don't try too hard!\" Richard said seriously. His eyes suddenly grew to dinner plates. \"Wait, oh no! Chloe, look out behind you!\" Chloe took her dagger back into her palm immediately, but turned around to see Moriarty behind her. \"Hello, beautiful,\" he said, and, quickly as lightning, hit Chloe on the head. Her eyes rolled to the back of her head, and she fell to the ground, slipping back under the plateau. Richard tore from his spot and lunged at Moriarty, crossing blades with him. \"You could have killed her!\" he shouted, pushing the wicked villain away from him. \"I'm certain I already have,\" Moriarty sneered. \"You are nothing here without her to protect you!\" \"Oh? Really?\" Richard said. He screamed inside his head, The Odyssey, the power of the gods! and focused to bring the strength and bravery of each legendary Greek god into him. It coursed through his blood like rushing rivers, bringing him back to a kind of life he had never felt before. His Hercules-like strength consumed him, and suddenly, he pushed Moriarty away, the power throwing the villain a few good yards. He was back on his feet in seconds, coming back for a second blow. Richard already had made a list of literary weapons ready in his head, so he called them out, one at a time. The Secret Garden, millions of garden pebbles! Thousands of pebbles came flying out of nowhere, pelting Moriarty right and left, and pecking the red wizards who once more came to their master's rescue. Still, they managed to deflect most of them, banging off of their blades sharply. Richard ran through his list quickly, but decided that they all wouldn't be good enough to wound this enemy. He finally reached the end of his list, where his most fearsome weapon was. The Wizard of Oz, the twister! Richard braced himself, hoping the twister would be small enough to swallow up only Moriarty. But he hoped too late; it could only materialize as it was in its story- no matter how he could beg and plead for the twister to change size. If only he could…if only… Richard kicked the ground violently, briefly hating how limited his powers were. If Chloe were only here, she would have whipped Moriarty away with a twister that could bend and break as she commanded…the battle could end more easily that way… Richard climbed back under the plateau, covering Chloe with his cape, watching as the twister raged away, picking up soldier after soldier from the battlefield. At least Moriarty was gone, but Chloe still had to get up. The battle would surely be lost without her there. \" Richard. Richard, you must go on. You will. Chloe shall be revived in due time…\" Richard gasped when he heard that voice. The Pagemaster had found him, speaking to him through his mind. Thank god he was there- but why couldn't he be there in person to wake Chloe with his magic powers? Even he should realize that Chloe would ensure the survival of the heroes. \"Why aren't you here?\" Richard finally asked him. \"We're going to lose without her. I mean, can't you wake her up with your powers? I…I don't know what to do.\" Richard jumped when a wizened old man stepped into the plateau, crouching down to Richard's level inside. He uncovered Chloe and pushed some of her loose hair from her face, like a kind old grandfather would do. Richard's heart sped when he noticed the tender affection the Pagemaster gave to Chloe. \"Richard, my boy, you fought bravely just as you have with Chloe,\" the Pagemaster said. \"You can be brave as she has been if you reach within yourself, and unleash what lies inside. Recall when you braved that dragon, and how you put aside everything, even your own life, to save your friends.\" \"That was six years ago,\" Richard said. \"And besides, my powers are limited. I cannot defeat the villains alone. Chloe was there to help me, and so you see, she has to come back.\" The Pagemaster laid a hand on Richard's shoulder and looked at him with his gentle, blazing eyes. \"Richard, you and Chloe are Proverbs, and every Proverb is just as powerful as the next- some simply possess maximized ability. But don't you see- these abilities are merely additions to what you already can do. Back, six years ago, you had barely hatched this power, but you could fight that dragon as bravely as you could face a mouse with a sword in hand.\" Richard shook his head, but the Pagemaster still responded calmly to the young warrior. \"I brought you here for one purpose the very last time. You found the courage to face what you feared. Thus, you can do it again. You faced your dragon alone, and surely enough, if you braved half of the library alone, you can still face an army of mere soldiers- from the opposite side of my kingdom.\" \"You think so?\" Richard wanted to know. The Pagemaster nodded. \"But my belief alone will never get you back out there to help end this war. You must hold that hard stone of faith inside yourself. True, you and Chloe fought well together, but her strength is nearly gone. You must be the one to swing the last sword, and restore this world to its former peace.\" Richard's mind wandered away. He could suddenly remember it well- a mere ten-year-old, fighting a thousand-foot dragon with only a sword, shield, and helmet to protect him. And for the most part, he had succeeded, only when he used his head, and his courage, to escape the dragon. He hadn't even known that Chloe existed, and especially, he didn't have these special powers to help him. A normal human boy who before, couldn't lift a sword without trembling. But that boy was long gone. A warrior had since been born- a warrior who had fought through half the library with only his Proverb magic, and few allies. He had learned quite a bit more about this world, and such a journey hadn't been easy to survive. He bet Chloe had faced things ten times worse, but he couldn't fathom them. He could see this for sure- that she was lying unconscious on the floor, and couldn't join him. There was nothing left to do but take sword in hand, and face the dragon once more- for the last time. He stood up. The Pagemaster led Richard out into the sun, the both of them brandishing their weapons bravely, and Richard feeling his determination singing in his heart loud and clear, while Chloe flashed through his mind. Now was the time. \"Look who has returned!\" Richard jumped. Moriarty had survived the twister! \"What the…?\" Richard sputtered. \"What have I told you and the little girl too many times already?\" Moriarty asked. \"Your powers are no match for…oh, my goodness, you brought him with you.\" \"That's the Pagemaster, to you!\" Richard said. \"Professor James Moriarty,\" the Pagemaster acknowledged him. \"Oh, my Pagemaster,\" Moriarty said. \"I had no idea you would return to this battle.\" \"I did, but not to fight to destroy your half of my kingdom,\" he said. \"Merely to see that my best soldier, Richard Tyler, could ensure his survival in this war.\" \"Pep-talking with the oaf who believes he's a hero simply for saving a damsel in distress?\" Moriarty asked. \"A warrior Proverb,\" Richard corrected. \"Who has good skill in handling a bow, unlike some.\" \"Are you questioning my weaponry skills?\" Moriarty wondered aloud, tensing in the hand that held his bloody weapon. \"No. I'm simply stating that Chloe wasn't afraid of you. And neither am I.\" \"I'll change that, because you're going to take my blade. Like a dead man!\" Moriarty lunged right at Richard, clanging swords, and Richard re-imagined his command to the Greek gods, his strength coming back to him quickly. He pushed away Moriarty, and brought his sword down quickly on him. Then, something extraordinary happened. Richard's blade came down so hard on Moriarty's own weapon that when they clashed, there was an explosion of color and light, tiny sparkling balls of magic flying out in such a gush Richard could be standing in the center of a maelstrom. There was a rush of wind and Richard was nearly thrown off his feet, but he plunged his sword further into the light, hoping and waiting to finish off the dastardly villain. He gave a shout before shoving his sword in one last time, and along with his own, he heard the sounds of another blade piercing into the light. The sounds of the battle whooshed and whirled all around Richard, seeming to melt into one giant mash of sound before suddenly, a great darkness took Richard, and he fell into it, never climbing back up for the longest of time.[Chapter 19] Chapter 19 A void of darkness overtook Richard, wrapping him in warmth, but he could not think or do anything of that sort. He seemed to float like a ghost through the void, where there was nothing else- absolutely nothing but his deathly spirit. Suddenly, the quiet was stirred by a slit of light cutting through the black, opening up further like a door until sounds, sights, and smells came flooding back to Richard. \"Come on, Rich. You can wake up now. Carefully, now.\" The world rushed back to Richard as his eyes opened to the golden ceilings of the bedroom he and Chloe shared before any part of their journey had begun. His vision was blocked by the heart-shaped face of a girl clad in silver armor and her fire-red hair falling in her face like drapes of silk. \"Chloe?\" At the realization that she was really okay, Richard launched upwards to hold her, but she pushed him back down gently. \"What happened to me?\" Richard asked. \"When you broke Moriarty's sword, his and Dracula's power over the villains was broken and somehow, your powers and your strength became strong enough to overcome his, and the valley was destroyed.\" Richard looked hard at Chloe, expecting some greater truth from what she was telling him. \"So, the war…is over?\" he asked. \"Thanks to you, it is,\" Chloe replied. \"Thanks to me, and you.\" \"And me?\" \"Yeah, remember? When I broke Moriarty's blade, there was another sword coming into the light, and I assumed that it was yours. I thought you were revived and that you stepped in to help me defeat him.\" Chloe shook her head. \"Rich, all I ever did to help you was to get Carrie out of the way, heal your wounds, and then, well, that was it. I'm just telling you what the Pagemaster told me when I came back to consciousness.\" She rubbed her head and made a strange face. \"Which, feels really strange, by the way- being knocked out.\" Richard felt a flood of thoughts come into his head, his own questions overtaking them. Chloe hadn't really helped him in the end after all? It had only been him- with only his powers- who had defeated the villains and restored peace at last to the literary world? But that was impossible. His own strength and will alone, would never have been enough to end an enormous, many-year war. Especially with how limited his powers were, it only could have been Chloe who could do it. Her power could stretch to the limits, if any limits at all, and could have ended it in a heartbeat. But him? \"I don't understand it,\" Richard muttered. \"You fulfilled your mission as a Proverb, and for yourself,\" Chloe said. \"The Proverbs, as far as I remember, are supposed to be the ones who will end all troubles between the heroes and villains in this world. But you, I believe, actually did more than save our side of this world. The Pagemaster said that his sole purpose of bringing you here was to reestablish the single-handed bravery that every human must have for themselves. You lost that while in the human world, didn't you?\" Richard was about to shake his head, when he stopped himself. Of course there were times when his confidence could waver, but what did that have to do with reestablishing bravery? He was brave, but…was he so afraid to disappoint that he had filled his mind with the ideals of courage and bravado? Perhaps that was so. Admittedly, since his comeback from this world six years ago, he occasionally had tiny little feelings- so small and occasional that he barely noticed them most of the time- that, should he revert back to being a frightened little boy like he used to be, he would lose everything he had gained through his old adventure. He had filled his mind with all the great things he could do for himself and others if he went back to playing Little League- in order to please his father, and finally coincide with the other kids he knew. Perhaps what he had done out in the valley was what true bravery felt like. Not to feel like he had to please others for his own sake, but for the sake of others, so that they could live on. He was never making a selfish choice on the battlefield and thus he had nearly killed himself to enable the heroes, and Chloe, to survive. \"Yes, I did, didn't I?\" he finally said. \"And look where you are now,\" Chloe said, stroking her thumb across his shoulder, \"a hero.\" \"Still, I don't think I could've done it without you,\" Richard said. \"You were the only reason I would have made that journey across the sections. I guess if you weren't there, I probably would have gone right back home.\" \"And left the Pagemaster and the others to fight on their own without you? Never!\" Chloe made a strong face like she were staring down an enemy- a face so playfully exaggerated that they both laughed. Accidentally, Chloe slipped on her feet and fell down, her chest hitting Richard's with enough force to make him sputter out a breath. Chloe looked up to say she was sorry, but somehow, she couldn't say a word. Her thoughts returned to that night in the tower, when the both of them had danced beside each other. Her breath was instantly lost to her for an entire moment, maybe longer. That was how long he seemed to hold the same reaction to her. \"You know I…that I…\" \"…love you?\" he finished for her. \"Ye-yeah, er, yes, that's it,\" she sputtered. For a moment, they kept very still, until Chloe pressed herself against him, close enough that maybe their bodies shared a heart. The feeling of her against him made Richard forget all his hurt from the impact of destroying the villain leader, and only of her. She was here, and so was he, and no one else. \"Chloe?\" \"Yes?\" \"Come here, closer.\" She obeyed him, and crept on top of him until their faces were exactly above each other, kept apart by their breathing. Richard lifted his arms and placed them on Chloe's back, feeling along her spine, until he came to her neck, where he swept some of her hair off her shoulder. It fell like a waterfall over one side of their faces, completely hiding their heads from the door. \"Now all I can see is you,\" he said. Richard lifted his head, and touched his lips to Chloe's, running his hands alone her neck and back down her spine, loving knowing that she was here to share his personal victory with him. To him, Chloe was the most precious thing in his world, something that he never wanted to lose. Think we're dreaming? Chloe asked through her mind. Richard didn't need to ask for mindreading powers to know what she was thinking. \"If we are,\" he said, \"let's be together.\" Chloe was about to kiss Richard again, when Jip burst through the door, his tail whacking the floor like a furry mallet. Both Richard and Chloe started at his soft bark, and Chloe almost fell from the bed. Jip yelped helplessly, racing over to nuzzle Chloe up with his nose. When she was back on her feet, Jip sat down, wagging his tail even faster, so that he stirred up some dust. \"Richard, Chloe, er…gracious saviors,\" he said, bowing his head almost to the floor, \"if the brave Richard has gotten his good rest, then the Pagemaster wants for him, and his lady Chloe, to come to the great throne room.\" Richard and Chloe glanced back at each other; neither of them pretended not to know what Jip was talking about. \"Are you sure it's just the Pagemaster?\" Chloe asked. \"I'm pretty sure the rest of the survivors will want to see us off back home, wouldn't they?\" \"Going back home?\" Jip cocked his head sideways. \"Oh, not just yet, sweet lady. The one thing that threatened to destroy our world forever has been extinguished by the last two Proverbs. Truly, you did not believe we would let you go without commending such bravery. I know I would not. And besides-\" Jip grinned widely, and licked Chloe's hand affectionately- \"my master Doolittle has come back from service.\" \"Good for you, Jip,\" Richard said. He started to get up from the bed, taking care not to bump his wounds against anything. Chloe held him like a caring mother when he was finally up on his feet. \"Follow me,\" Jip said, bowing his head again while he trotted from the room, Richard and Chloe in tow.[Chapter 20] Chapter 20 Once in the throne room, Jip pranced towards the Pagemaster's throne, and sat upon the velvet upholstery like he himself was a proud king. He barked before he spoke to Richard and Chloe in the doorway. \"Watch what I do.\" Tapping his paws together three times, he vanished in a pop and an explosion of magical sparkles. The sparks fell gently on the seat while Richard and Chloe moved to follow their friend. And one by one, they sat on the throne, and clapped their hands together three times. When Richard followed that motion, he forced out a breath while he was whisked away through a colorful space, like the rainbow-vacuum that had first brought him and Chloe into the throne room at the beginning of their adventure; was it really that long ago that they had come here for the first time? After not breathing in the tight portal for several seconds, Richard found himself stumbling onto a hard marble floor, feeling the vibration of his fall in his knees. His eyes felt strange after seeing so many bright colors. But now there was nothing around him but a dark ocean blue, and a gentle whirling of light, like sunlight streaming through water. Air whooshed into his lungs while the vast space registered in his mind, and for a moment he felt lightheaded, stumbling around until he finally fell to his hands and knees on the cold floor. \"Still haven't gotten used to those portals have you, boy?\" Richard shot his head up at the familiar voice. Sir Hugo was standing beside Jip and the Pagemaster, in front of a giant crystal dome. It was small compared to the size of the seemingly-infinite room, but the bright light swirling from the top of the dome showered the room in gentle starlight. The whirling light fell upon every face in the room, seeming to spread around Richard for several yards, while they looked upon him and a newly-appeared Chloe. The moment that Chloe popped neatly into the room, the room erupted in applause, ringing through the space like a football stadium. Chloe was smiling widely at the applause, but Richard was in utter rapture at the crystal dome with the starlight streaming from it. The way it sparkled divinely against the dark blue slammed a feeling of déjà vu into his mind, which absolutely refused to let go until he said it out loud, to no one in particular. \"This is where we will go back home,\" he whispered. \"The world awaits!\" the Pagemaster called to the whole room, as if he had heard Richard's low voice, beckoning with his staff for Richard and Chloe to step up. Then, when they both stood facing the Pagemaster, he lowered his hand to the ground, and in a gentle voice, said, \"Kneel.\" The room fell into a hush, while the Pagemaster conjured two objects in the air above his hands. Even though they were both beautiful crowns of gold and silver, speckled with jewels inscribed with intricate words, the room remained entirely silent. Only when the Pagemaster moved to take them into his hands, did the crowd start to murmur collectively. But Sir Hugo held his hands up high, and like he had cast an instant spell, the whispering stopped in a snap. \"Richard Tyler. Chloe Dewey,\" the Pagemaster started. \"There is so much I could say to you both about the glorious deeds you have done for us all, but, it would take the rest of my eternal life to say so. Therefore, let us proceed with your coronation.\" \"Coronation?\" Richard blurted. What? Did that mean…? The Pagemaster nodded serenely. \"I am an eternal being, my dear boy, but it would be wrong to give up two such special people from my kingdom. Truthfully, I do have many good people in the Binding Order, but we have waited for so long for your powers as the Proverbs to come about. Therefore…\" The Pagemaster held up the great, golden crown above his head for the whole room to see. He then brought it gently down through the air, and the sparkling gold touched the scruffy blonde hair on Richard's head. Chloe sucked in a gentle breath of awe, while sweet warmth passed over Richard's head. He didn't see it, but the jewels were glowing, the words inscribed into them whispering throughout the room in a gentle breeze, while magical sparkles wafted around the space. They twinkled like the dome's starlight, making Richard's eyes glimmer, and his whole body glow like an angel. The crowd raised their hands to clap loudly, their voices shouting congratulations to their newly-crowned hero. The Pagemaster took the silver crown in his hands now, touching it to Chloe's head. She closed her eyes in pleasure as the warmth took her over, the silver shining through the jewels that also whispered to the room. Richard watched the spectacle from the corner of his eye, suddenly realizing what all the whispering was about when he had been crowned. He couldn't help but smile with all his heart- how beautiful Chloe looked, finally being rewarded for everything that she had done. Perhaps he could reward her some more later, she would like that… The Pagemaster raised his hands. \"Arise, Richard. And arise, Chloe.\" They both stood up, absolutely still while the Pagemaster raised his hands even higher, seeming to address the entire crowd, as well as the magnificent, magical starlight, which swirled in intricate patterns above their heads. \"My good people, I give you, with the greatest pleasure bestowed in all the books beyond, Richard and Chloe- Prince and Princess of the Imagination.\" There was an absolute uproar in the room, as hats were thrown to the ceiling and whistles of rejoice echoed throughout. Some people were jumping like little children, pumping their fists in the air. And slowly, more and more people started to close in on their new royals, tapping them on the back and pinching their shoulders in congratulations. Richard and Chloe both struggled to stay upright and keep their crowns on, but they greeted the enthusiasm warmly. All of their allies from the front line greeted them both at the same time, hugging them and shaking hands. A little face, in a new, crisp dress, also joined the crowd, her sweet voice breaking through almost instantly to the two Proverbs. \"Richard!\" she called. He turned his head, and among the tall people trying to reach him, he spotted a little head of blonde hair, tied back with a thin headband. When she jumped up, her blue dress fanned out like a flower, her little eyes glittering. With a swift gasp and in a single bound through the crowd, Richard picked her up in his arms and hugged her close. \"Alice!\" he shouted, stroking her hair like a loving father. \"Wow! I thought we'd never see you!\" \"You've saved us all!\" Alice said loudly. \"Oh, Richard, you and Chloe were so brave! However did you do it?\" \"Need I really explain it?\" Richard asked modestly. \"I'm just glad you made it back in one piece!\" \"I was as lost as ever,\" she said, \"until I was suddenly thrust into some curious, colorful space that took me back to my house. I suppose I owe it all to you, Richard. I just cannot believe that it's all over now!\" \"I know,\" he said, while Chloe joined the huddle. \"And that means me and Chloe have to go back to our home.\" Alice instantly dropped back down to the floor, still holding Richard's hands. \"What do you mean?\" she wanted to know. \"You are the Prince and Princess of the Imagination. We truly missed the old Prince when he went to the other world. I don't know what we'll do without you both here.\" She looked up helplessly at the Proverbs, flicking her eyes between them. \"We're sorry, Alice,\" Chloe answered. \"We belong back in our own world, because we still have parents and families and lives there.\" \"Although I'd miss having powers and not having to worry about final tests too much,\" Richard said with a shrug. Chloe laughed, while Alice just frowned. \"I don't like it at all,\" Alice said. \"But I suppose if you truly must.\" Alice wiped her arm across her eyes. \"I'll miss you both very much.\" \"And we you,\" Chloe answered, taking her little friend into her arms. \"But we'll be back before you know it. Even when we're there, we'll still be the Prince and Princess of the Imagination, even though we won't have our powers.\" \"Yeah. I guess we'll just be normal again,\" Richard murmured. \"It'll be interesting to see how long we've been gone.\" \"I don't think we'll have been missed,\" Chloe said. \"The first rule in books, Richard, is that no time passes when you visit a whole other world.\" Richard shrugged again, while Alice turned to him for a hug. \"If that's so, then goodbye,\" Alice said, clearly fighting tears. \"Goodbye, Alice,\" Richard and Chloe both said as they made their way back to the crystal dome, and the Pagemaster. When they were standing before him, the Pagemaster turned away and gestured with his great staff towards the glowing crystal dome. \"Shall I send you on your way?\" he asked. \"We're ready,\" Richard answered, stealing a glance at their reflections in the crystal. And for a moment, he almost saw him and Chloe, lying back in the library rotunda, with books scattered all around them like old friends… \"The world awaits!\" the Pagemaster repeated, while Richard and Chloe started to rise off the floor with a magical glow. \"Godspeed to you both, my friends!\" The room erupted once more with cheers and calls of goodbye. Looking below him, Richard saw the entire room waving to them, with Alice and Peaseblossom and the fairies standing at the head of them all. Richard and Chloe both turned back to wave goodbye, while the magical twister of starlight atop the dome carried them away into the flashing void of magic. … Slam! Slam! With a jolt of his body, Richard forced his eyes open. The back of his head hurt where he had hit the marble floor of the rotunda, his blood throbbing in his skull. The falling through the mural had surged his body with adrenaline, but he couldn't get up. His head hurt too much. Rubbing his hands through his hair, Richard felt for a bump. Instead, he felt no crown. New adrenaline surging through him, Richard sat bolt upright, and looked around him. There was a book cart nearby, with a lonely book lying on the floor. Everything looked the same as when they'd left it, and so, he didn't see his crown anywhere. \"Chloe?\" he said, turning quickly to her. \"What happened to my…?\" She was slowly stirring too. But she didn't answer his question right away. She gasped loudly enough to fill the silence of the empty library, when her head zipped around, her eyes flicking in her skull furiously. When she didn't find anything too different, she lifted her arms and legs for a better look, and Richard gasped too. In gazing at himself, he noticed that his old clothes were back; the scratchy denim of his jeans felt strange after so many weeks, as did the cold cotton of his T-shirt. Chloe was back in her yellow tunic, denim skirt, and clogs, her crown gone also. Chloe was silent and still for a long moment, before she fell on her back. \"My god,\" she whispered. \"I cannot believe we're actually back.\" \"Yeah,\" Richard breathed, nodding his head slowly. It felt like years and years ago since he had last seen the ordinary library around him. But then, could he really call this place ordinary , after such a grand journey? Now, there was absolutely no denying it. Since Mr. Dewey's presence in the library, the magic from his world had actually come with him, casting its spell upon anyone who dared explore the world of books. Somehow, Richard couldn't help but smile. The longer the library was kept open, the more wonderful journeys were sure to ensue. Chloe didn't say much else. She just sat there, breathing long, heavy breaths, staring upward at the still mural on the ceiling. \"It'll really take some getting used to being normal again,\" she said. But she closed her eyes anyway, her lips pursed in concentration. As Richard expected, nothing around them changed. Not even the book lying near them transformed in any way. Chloe opened her eyes, and grimaced. \"Dang!\" she hissed, and Richard chuckled. \"Real world, Chloe,\" he said. \"I can't do anything either.\" He reached for the book on the floor, and opened it, pointing to a random passage, while nothing happened. \"Aw, don't worry about that,\" Chloe soon said. \"We'll be back before you know it. After all, we're taking over for my grandfather. The magic's got to stay here, and we've got to keep our titles!\" \"You said it,\" Richard agreed, as he stood up slowly from the floor. He smoothed out his jacket, and reached for his car keys in his pocket. \"Okay, what say we go back home? After weeks and weeks of not sleeping in my own bed, I'm looking forward to collapsing on a real bedspring mattress again.\" \"You mean you won't miss the cold, hard ground, and just zapping up your own mattress?\" Chloe asked playfully. \"Hey, even when I do come back, I'm not going to use my powers straight away,\" Richard answered. \"I've seen enough magic to last me a long, long time. But, I'm not going to back out on staying a Proverb.\" \"As if you can,\" Chloe said while they started out of the rotunda. \"But I agree. I'll always love going into that world, but I'm ready to return to normality.\" Richard smiled lopsidedly at her while he put his hand around her waist. \"To start off, you want to meet me tomorrow for…for…?\" \"How's ice cream and French fries downtown?\" Chloe said. \"That's as normal as you can get on a first date.\" Richard chuckled softly, nodding. \"Fine by me.\" By this time, they were passing the front desk, with its various folders and the ancient computer monitor. Richard frowned and smiled at the same time, remembering watching Mr. Dewey work so hard and happily behind that counter. He could see him smiling like the Pagemaster himself while he handed a book to a customer. It was too bad though, that such a person couldn't do that anymore. But there would be someone new taking over the library right? Could the magic of the book world still stick around, even though its original source was gone for good? Well, maybe it didn't have to be gone forever… \"Say, Chloe,\" he said, as they opened the door. \"What do you think about getting a job here for the summer? Someone's got to take over from Mr. Dewey, and keep the magic of this world alive for him.\" Chloe looked from the door, just as she had lifted the latch. \"I've never had a job before,\" she said. \"But I like the idea of being a Proverb, and helping to run that world from afar.\" \"You can become the magical Imagination Proverb anytime…\" Richard said, lifting his eyebrows. \"And you can hunt magical demons for me anytime…\" Chloe and Richard both laughed, as Chloe opened the door and they stepped out into the spring air. As they made their way to the dark street, Chloe leaned against Richard, and he stroked her back with his thumb. He didn't even try to sum up everything that had happened, though he could say he was excited now. If a job at the library was possible, running it with a new boss, and Chloe, it would definitely make time between baseball practices worthwhile. He smiled too, thinking of the future he had with Chloe. No matter how many lessons he had yet to learn, or how many books he would read in a lifetime, Richard could guarantee that as long as Chloe was beside him, the library they held so dear would never go away. His grin widened, as he unlocked the car door, and let a droopy-eyed Chloe inside. Proverb or not, Mr. Dewey would be proud of her. ","Summary":" Chapter 1 For a long time, Chloe sat at her window.

Safely content behind their airnshield, they lived comfortable and happy lives, convinced the threatnthat had once threatened to destroy their planet had passed for good.n After all, they had collected up the remains of Spaceball 1 (a.k.a.nMega Maid) and refused to sell them to their unholy neighbors. Andnlittle word had come of any news of any kind from Planet Spaceballnfor months. So as far as the Druidians were concerned, no news wasngood news. Had they turned theirntelescopes to the neighboring planet of Exodosus, they might havennoticed a different story. For the surface of the large, oncendeserted planet was now dotted with numerous Spaceball militaryninstallations. Neutron artillery guns, interstellar transports,nhover tanks, and other prime examples of Spaceball military mightndotted the landscape, and that wasn't counting everything that hadnbeen set up below the surface. From their mainncontrol tower on the tallest mountain on the planet, the twonarchitects of this buildup surveyed their work through futuristicnbinoculars. Lord Dark Helmet lowered his after a moment. \"WellnColonel Sandurz,\" he confided in his associates, \"Soon we'll benat full capacity for Operation Open Druid Season—meaning the end ofnLone Starr, too.\" \"Absolutely, LordnHelmet,\" Colonel Sandurz agreed with the evil villain, \"And bestnof all, the Druidians have no idea that we're doing…\" Helmet lifted up hisnvisor, revealed his unbelievably nerdy true self. \"Sandurz, wenknow already,\" he told the colonel, \"Don't get repetitive.\" \"Sorry sir,\"nColonel Sandurz apologized. The TeleWall to theirnright lit up. \"Lord Helmet, this is Commanderette Zircon reportingnfrom the research wing,\" the attractive young officer on duty toldnthem, \"Count Cuckoo would like to inform you that he's run into anslight snag with his T.A.R.G.E.T. research. He requests you join himnnow.\" Helmet pulled hisnvisor back down for a moment. \"We'll be down immediately,nCommanderette,\" he told her in his authoritative voice. OncenZircon had signed off, he yanked the visor up again and asided tonSandurz, \"I knew we shouldn't have assigned Cuckoo to thenresearch for the T.A.R.G.E.T.s. That idiot couldn't design anweightless coffeemaker let alone our new ultimate weapon ofndestruction. I don't even know why I took him as my apprentice.\" \"Well we couldn'tnoverrule President Skroob, you know sir,\" Sandurz pointed out, \"Henisn't the most respected despot in the Frankfurt Galaxy fornnothing.\" \"Well, let's gonsee what the problem is this time,\" Helmet said, leading Sandurzntoward the elevator. A short 256 story flight straight down tooknthem to the very heart of the research center of the base. CountnCuckoo, a hunchbacked being with a white face with red polka dots andna uniform that looked like a clown's, greeted them with a voice notnunlike Peter Lorre's once they'd entered his wing. \"LordnHelmet, Colonel Sandurz, I'm having problems getting the explosivesnto be as catastrophic as you and the president wished,\" he informednthem. \"What's thenproblem with it?\" Helmet asked him. \"We need Melmaciannhair, sir,\" Cuckoo said to his master, pointing to a boilingngreenish liquid in a large vat before them, \"It's the one thingnthat'll make this all the more explosive and planet-killing. nUnfortunately, I don't have any here.\" \"All right, Cuckoo,nwe'll look into it,\" Helmet said, \"Sandurz, go to Melmac andnshave all the hair off as many of those worthless things as you cannfind.\" \"Uh…,\" Sandurznlooked very weak, \"Lord Helmet, there's something I probablynshould have told you a long time ago.\" \"What?\" Helmetndidn't like the sound of this. \"Uh, could wendiscuss this in private?\" Sandurz gestured toward a broom closetnnearby. \"If you insist,\"nHelmet followed his associate into the closet and closed the door. nAs Cuckoo listened curiously, his master shrieked at the top ofnlungs, \"WHAT DO YOU MEAN MELMAC BLEW UP, SANDURZ!!??\" \"It was just anslight miscalculation, sir, news travels so slowly in this part ofnthe galaxy,\" Sandurz said, running out of the closet with his handsncovering his crotch. Visor down, Helmet stormed after him, hisncobra-headed Ring of the Schwartz already on his finger and aimed tondestroy all in its path. \"Well you'd better hope that some ofnthe Melmacians survived, Sandurz, or all the president's horses andnall the president's men won't be able to put you back togethernagain!\" the evil leader threatened, lowering the ring. \"President Skroobndoesn't have any horses, Lord Helmet,\" Cuckoo pointed out. \"Don't try me,nCuckoo,\" Helmet thrust his ring at his apprentice. After makingnsure he wasn't going to get another peep out of him, he raised thenvisor and said, \"OK, no problem, we'll just see if we can findnany survivors. Sandurz, check the computer.\" \"Right sir,\"nSandurz strode over to the nearest console and announced out loud,n\"Computer, show the locations of every known survivor of Melmacndocumented over the last five years,\" he ordered it. \"Please deposit fivenspacebucks in marked slot,\" the computer told him. \"What?\" Sandurz'snexpression dropped, \"Why do you need spacebucks?\" \"I need to put mynkids through college,\" the computer told him, \"No money, noninformation.\" Sandurz sighed andngave the computer the requested money. \"Thank you,\" the computernbuzzed and proceeded to show THREE MATCHES FOUND. \"Where are they?\"nHelmet rushed up to the screen. \"It looks likenthere's one colony that settled on a place called New Melmac, onengroup around Sedna-5, and one questionable one around this yellownstar that we haven't named yet,\" Sandurz said, reading theninformation on the screen. \"Why haven't wennamed it?\" Cuckoo asked. \"There are so manynyellow stars like it in its galaxy that we're nowhere near namingnthem all,\" Sandurz told him. \"Well, it's anstart,\" Helmet said, \"We'll have to examine them one by one. nSandurz, gather up the elitist of our task forces and deploy themntoward the yellow star. We'll see if we'll find pay dirt there. nCuckoo, call Spaceball City and tell the president of this.\" \"Yes, Master,\"nCuckoo galloped off. \"Sandurz, preparenSpaceball 2 for immediate departure,\" Helmet ordered the colonel,n\"We're shoving off as soon as possible. We need to be back herenwith the Melmacian hair in three weeks when the perfect alignmentnwith Druidia exists.\" \"When we're linednup with the air shield door, right?\" Sandurz asked. \"Exactly,\" Helmetnsaid, flicking another switch on the wall that gave him a perfectnview of Druidia. And since King Roland gave us the combination lastntime, it'll be a simple matter to open it and leave the planet ansitting duck for our T.A.R.G.E.T.s.\" He walked across thenresearch room to the prototype of the T.A.R.G.E.T.: the TechnicallynAdvanced Rebuildable Gigaton Exploding Transgalaxator. A flattenednsaucer-shaped red metallic vehicle with a wide opening in the frontnfor the huge warhead to be placed. It was an ominous sight. \"Uponnimpact,\" Helmet rambled on, \"It'll suck up every ounce of freshnair within its range, and the air probe'll return to the home shipnunscathed. Once we've got all the air, we'll send in thenWidowmaker model to destroy Druidia, and with it Vespa and LonenStarr.\" A devious smile cross his face. \"And once we destroynDruidia,\" he said, \"We'll spread out across the galaxy and makeneverything subject to our rule. No one will mock Planet Spaceballnagain.\" \"Of course not sir,\"nSandurz laughed, \"Assuming the Melmacian or Melmacians we findncough up the hair we ask for.\" \"Sandurz,\" Helmetnsnickered, \"What Melmacian wouldn't give up once he gets a loadnof us?\"[Chapter 2] TWO \"ALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLFFFFFFFFFF!!!!!!\" the shout roared up so loud that it echoed all throughout Los Angeles and lasted for close to a minute and a half. The Melmacian shuffled his way into the Tanner family garage. \"No need to shout, Willie, I was just in the garden,\" he told his friend, \"Now would you like to explain why you chose to cut short my private time with your yodeling for me?\" \"Alf,\" Willie Tanner said as slowly and as calmly as he could, \"Were you in here last night?\" \"Yes,\" the former Gordon Shumway said, \"This is not about the axel grease I purloined for my hiccups, is it?\" \"No, but now that you brought that to my attention, I'll look into that too,\" Willie said, \"But the big question of the day is, were you fiddling around with my radio?\" He pointed to his short-wave system, which had been heavy gutted since he'd last seen it. \"Oh, you mean that,\" Alf said, \"Well Willie, I doubt you'll believe this, but last night I had a premonition that something bad was coming this way, so I took it upon myself to construct a rudimentary weapon of sorts for self-defense when it arrives.\" \"It's going to arrive all right, mister,\" Willie's voice was rising, \"I can't tell you how many years I worked on building this radio, so unless you agree to rebuild it pronto, that bad thing you've seen's going to be my fist heading…\" \"Get a grip, Willie!\" Alf raised his hands in protest, \"Boy, some guys just don't know how to take it when evil threatens.\" \"All right, just give me back what you took and we'll call it at least somewhat even,\" Willie said, gesturing with his hand, \"And from now on, no more borrowing without my permission, okay?\" \"Whatever, whatever,\" Alf strolled out of the garage. Minutes later he returned clutching a strange contraption put together from the guts of the radio. \"What is that supposed to be?\" Willie inquired. \"Pancake tosser,\" Alf told him, \"Trust me, it's very effective at close range if you're being attacked by multiple guys.\" \"You turned my radio into a pancake tosser!?\" Willie was appalled by the mere thought of it, \"You'd better hope I can put this back to the way it was before you put your furry fingers on it! Now leave me alone while I try to work on it!!\" \"I take this to mean that I won't be getting extra Halloween candy come Friday.\" Alf asked. When Willie didn't answer he added, \"I guess I'll take that as a no,\" and lurched out toward the laundry room. Once inside, he slumped back into his basket and looked out the window at the sunset sky. He hadn't been lying when he told Willie he'd had a premonition of evil coming. It was an inbred trait of Melmacians to sense when people had harm in mind for them. This awareness was a major factor as to why Melmac had fought only one war in its existence. And from what Alf could judge, it was probably no more than a day away now. There was a low thud as the front door slammed shut. The rest of the Tanners had returned from their Halloween shopping. Their happy and excited tones made Alf feel all the guiltier that he hadn't been able to go with them. He hoped they'd someday relent at least somewhat in their determination to keep him under wraps and let him have freer reign with his life on Earth. \"Hey Alf, want a 3 Musketeers?\" Brian stuck his head in the laundry room door. \"Sure,\" Alf extended his paw for the candy and downed it wrapper and all. \"Don't worry, I won't choke,\" he reassured the boy, \"By the time it gets to my final stomach, the wrapper'll be ingested through the lining.\" There was a loud crash from the garage, followed by the sound of Willie spewing multiple curses. \"I guess he can't fix his radio,\" Alf shrugged. \"What happened to it?\" Brian asked. \"Oh, it's a long story,\" Alf said quickly, \"But the important thing is something bad's coming, so when you go trick-or-treating on Halloween, don't talk to anyone suspicious-looking. They may be out to get me, and they won't hesitate to come at me through you.\" \"But who would want to come after you, Alf?\" Before Alf could answer Brian's latest question, Kate's voice exploded from the kitchen: \"ALF!! WHAT DID YOU DO WITH ALL THE PANCAKE BATTER!!!!!?????\" \"Hold that thought,\" Alf told his young friend, \"I'll be back in a moment once this little confusion gets straightened out.\" As he lumbered off toward the kitchen, he said out loud, \"At least there's probably someone else in this burned-out universe in worse straights than I am here.\" Millions of light years away on Druidia, Prince Lone Starr gazed thoughtfully from his window in King Roland's castle up at the peaceful blue Druidian sky. TOO peaceful, Lone Starr thought. Ever since he'd married Vespa and settled down, something had been missing in his life. Something he hadn't realized he'd had until it was gone.[Chapter 3] THREE Inside his large residence on Spaceball City, President Skroob was lounging in his bathtub enjoying a nice hot bubble bath. \"Quarter to three, no one in the place,\" he was humming, squeezing his toy frog, \"The people are nothing but a charity case. I say Skroob the people any day. Taxes get higher, insurance…\" Suddenly the TeleWall lit up. \"President Skroob,\" Commanderette Zircon announced imperatively. \"YOUGGHHH!!!\" Skroob jumped in shock—then dove as far down in the bubbles as he could. \"Zircon, how many times have I told you never to disturb me when I'm bathing!!??\" he screamed at her. \"I'm sorry sir, but I have vital news reports for you,\" Zircon told him, \"Lord Helmet called to tell you he's headed for that yellow star as fast as he can. He expects to reach it within a solar day.\" \"And that's the vital report you have for me?\" Skroob said sarcastically, \"Boy, you must be starved for news over there.\" \"I'd also like to report, sir, that expeditions to other systems with Melmacians have proven successful,\" Zircon went on, \"We have close to a dozen specimens in custody and should begin shaving them shortly. Plus, I just received word from General Mills that our droid army should be up and running any minute now, so if you have a spare moment, he requests you be present for the ceremony.\" \"Okay, okay, I'll get down there A.S.A.P.,\" Skroob said, \"Continue with whatever you were doing before.\" \"Yes sir,\" Zircon saluted him as she signed off. Skroob hopped out of the tub and dried himself off with the Pizza the Hutt version of Spaceballs the Towel that was on the hangers at the moment. It was only then that he realized the servant druids had removed his clothes for cleaning before he stepped in the tub. \"Stupid druids!\" he groaned, rushing into his bedroom. Digging through his drawers, he came up with a pair of pajamas that would probably suit his function well enough. Throwing a smoking jacket over them, he raced barefoot up the hall. Unfortunately, the janitorial staff was mopping the floor around the far corner, so Skroob slipped and fell right on his backside. \"Can't this wait until later!?\" he yelled at the workmen. Not giving them a chance to answer, he picked himself up and continued running until he reached the observation balcony overlooking the courtyard below. \"President Skroob salute!\" ordered the commander of the troops on the balcony. \"HAIL SKROOB!!!\" his men shouted, giving the salute. Skroob returned it. \"So, where's General Mills?\" he asked no one in particular. \"Right here, Skroob,\" came the eerie voice of General Mills from his left. The half-droid, half orange-hued alien came clanking toward him, a noise made all the louder by the rattling of the captured weapons from Mills's fallen foes that he always carried with him. \"I take it you only got the news just now?\" Mills asked him. \"Uh, no,\" Skroob lied. He scanned the courtyard. The sleek black prototype battle druids, ten thousand in all, lay inactive below, waiting for their first orders. \"Finally, my lifelong dream realized,\" Skroob announced grandly, \"Warfare without a human factor. They obey orders without a qualm and can take a severe beating our guardsmen can't. Not to mention that once we're at full capacity, they'll serve our manpower question well. We send them in for the first wave of attacks. Once our enemies expend all their power and energy destroying them, we send in the human troops to massacre all in sight. It'll be a…\" \"Would you stop rambling on the plot details and just activate them!?\" General Mills thrust a large red button into Skroob's hands, \"I'm not a general without a command, you know!\" \"All right, keep your bionic limbs on!\" Skroob huffed. He took his place by the railing. \"I dedicate these soldiers to the future military success of Planet Spaceball,\" he announced grandly, pressing the button. There was a low hum as the druids below were activated. They rose up in unison and hummed out, \"President Skroob salute!\", giving it to their commander in chief. Skroob returned it again. \"Okay boys,\" he told the druids over the loudspeaker next to him, \"I hope you loved your christening just now. In a little bit we'll turn you loose on the innocent Druidians and let you kill them left and right. Until then, just do whatever General Mills here tells you. Now let's roll out.\" \"I give the order to roll out!\" General Mills reprimanded him, \"I am the general here!\" \"Fine, have it your way,\" Skroob handed the megaphone to him. He walked out of the way and let Mills address the druids. \"So, Ringrinch, how long will it take to get the droid factories up to peak capacity?\" he asked one of his top ministers. \"If we make the workers go on a twenty-two hour shift like we suggested, probably within a week,\" Nute Ringrinch, Skroob's top economic advisor, told him. \"To be honest, Mr. President, I'm still unsure of the logic in building an army of battle druids when we have one of the best militaries in the Frankfurt Galaxy.\" \"Ringrinch, one of the bad things about our planet is that we have a finite number of guys fit for Spaceball military service, even with involuntary conscription in effect,\" Skroob told him, \"With these druids we increase our numbers to infinite levels, plus we now have the intimidation factor in our corner. And don't worry about paying for all of it. Since the Constitution clearly says that I'm by default the CEO of every company on the planet, we'll just skim funds from the public works departments if we need it.\" \"Well Lord Helmet doesn't think it's the best of ideas,\" Ringrinch admitted,\" I just talked with him the other week and he thinks the human factor is fine just the way it is. And I can't…\" \"Ringrinch, since when has Lord Helmet ever known what he's talking about?\" Skroob posed, \"Now unless you've got something else important to tell me, I can't miss tonight's episode of Execution Tonight. They're killing off the three ringleaders of that arson gang I personally sentenced to death two weeks ago.\" \"Sir, it's unhealthy to watch that show as much as you do,\" Ringrinch called after Skroob as he strolled away. \"Well when I end up sick I'll call…\" Skroob was interrupted as he slipped and fell on the slippery floor again. \"You didn't see that!\" he called back to his advisors as he squirmed embarrassed out of sight. \"Ya know Boss, I just realized something,\" Bard said as the Winnebago began its descent toward the Moon of Vega, \"We never did pinpoint exactly where Yogurt's place is on this moon. We could search for days and not find him, especially when he keeps it so well hidden.\"[Chapter 4] FOUR \"I have an announcement I think you all might be interested in,\" Willie told the family as they sat around the table at dinner, \"My office is sponsoring a Halloween party on the thirty-first, so you're all welcome to join me there. We'll have lots of food and entertainment, so…\" \"Sounds great, Willie,\" Alf cut him off, \"I'll go as Roof the Two-Headed Nurse. Let me check the costume shops on E-bay and see….\" \"Alf, you can't go as Roof the Two-Headed Nurse,\" Willie interrupted him in return, \"In fact, you can't go at all, period.\" \"It's a costume party, Willie, no one's going to notice or care,\" the alien said, \"All right, if I can't be Roof, let me at least be the Headless Horseman. From what I can tell, he's sort of the symbol of Halloween down here.\" \"Alf, we are not going out of our way to buy you a horse,\" Kate sighed, frustrated, \"We're all sorry you feel this way, but that's just the way it has to be.\" \"Oh sure, constrain the poor helpless alien,\" Alf said sarcastically as he wolfed down his latest helping of macaroni. \"In the meantime,\" Willie continued, \"You know what we expect from you here at the house. No trashing it and no attracting attention to yourself. I've noticed the Ochmoneks have been especially snoopy lately, and even though it's Halloween, they're still apt to call the cops if they see a stranger in here.\" \"Sounds good to me, Willie,\" Alf said, \"Apart from the fact that leaves me with practically nothing to do.\" \"Well, there's plenty for you to do here, Alf,\" Lynn tried to console him, \"You can watch the TV and….well, watch the TV, and….uh…\" \"Point made,\" Alf said, \"There's only so much a couch potato can take on the tube. Even Dr. Phil's getting boring nowadays.\" \"Alf, just promise you won't do anything that'll embarrass us,\" Willie goaded him. \"You have my word,\" Alf told him, \"Now if you'll excuse me, I have finish working on my latest screenplay.\" \"You're not writing a screenplay,\" Kate pointed out as her houseguest hopped down and trudged toward the garage. \"Exactly,\" Alf called back. \"Mom, Dad, are you sure we can't take him with us?\" Brian asked, looking after his friend with concern. \"Honey, I know it's probably tough on Alf being here alone all the time, but it's just a risk we'll have to take,\" Kate told her son. \"Assuming he doesn't eat us out of house and home,\" Lynn pointed out. \"True,\" Kate agreed, \"Willie, we'll have to lock all the excess food up before we go.\" \"Right,\" Willie nodded, \"We'll get on it later tonight.\" In the meantime, Alf entered the garage, feeling more left out than ever. He leaned on the table, on which Willie's radio now sat fully repaired. Things had never been this dull back on Melmac. What he wouldn't give for just a little chance of excitement one more time… And then he heard the buzzing coming from Willie's radio. \"S.O.S.!!\" shouted a strangely familiar voice, \"S.O.S., can anyone hear me?\" Alf's heart leapt at the sound of the imperiled person. He ran over to the radio and flicked it on full. \"Skip, is that you!?\" he asked across the cosmos. \"Gordo!\" his old friend from Melmac called back. Even from where he was standing, Alf could here the sound of laser blasts being fired. \"Skip, what's going on?\" he asked. \"They're after us, Gordo!\" Skip told him breathlessly, \"They attacked New Melmac, and they've been chasing us since Algol! We can't outrun them anymore…you can't parachute, Rhonda, there's no air!\" \"Rhonda's with you?\" Alf felt another breeze of emotion at the mention of the love of his former life, \"They haven't hurt her, have they? By the way, who are they?\" \"It's Helmet, Gordo, he's coming after…Oh my God, they've started the tractor beam!!\" Skip screamed. Alf could now hear a low humming in the background. \"Dark Helmet?\" he asked, \"He got off the Planet of the Apes? I thought the intergalactic…\" More screaming caused him to stop mid-stream. \"They're coming for you next, Gordon, save yourself!\" he could hear Rhonda screaming at the radio, \"If Helmet finds you, it's…\" And then the line went dead. \"Hello!?\" Alf called into it, \"Rhonda, Skip, you still there?\" There was no answer. Alf rushed to the window and looked up at the still light sky. \"Of all the terrible fates,\" he said softly, \"Taken by Dark Helmet. If he gives her a nose job, I'll twist his upside-down.\" He thought over all he'd heard. If the Spaceballs were coming for him next as Rhonda had said, he had to protect himself somehow. But how? \"There's safety in numbers,\" he said out loud. But he'd be largely alone for the next couple of days. Even though he'd seen Home Alone numerous times, he knew that even the most elaborately rigged booby traps would be unlikely to stop three hundred or so heavily armed Spaceballs. And there wouldn't be many places to hide. Unless… \"I've got to make the house bigger and add more rooms,\" he resolved. And he had to do it quickly and without the Tanners asking too many questions. Looking around to make sure no one was watching, he picked up Willie's cell phone from where it lay on the table and dialed a number he'd just happened to have memorized in the phone book. \"Hello, Elton's Construction?\" he asked into it, \"Listen, I've got a special Halloween job for you. Send down your best crew as discreetly as you can on Halloween morning at about eight twenty. If you can do what I'm asking in seven hours or less, I'll give you an extra bonus. Now what I have in mind is…\" Several hundred miles away at the headquarters of the Alien Task Force, a corporal ran into General Darnell Valentine's office. \"Sir, we've just locked onto an interesting transmission from the Small Magellanic Cloud,\" he announced.[Chapter 5] FIVE \"Can't we stop for dinner?\" Barf complained, noticing a space stop on their left, \"I haven't had anything to eat since that ice cream a day ago.\" \"Sure, why not,\" Lone Starr shrugged, \"Helmet can't be that far ahead.\" He jetted down toward the stop, parking right next to a large ship that looked remarkably like the Millennium Falcon—or was it some other ship whose name he forgot. The entered the diner and sat down at the counter. \"Boy, they sure have a good selection here,\" Barf said, eyeing the menu, \"I don't know about you, Boss, but I think I'll take the ground beef.\" \"Good evening gentlemen,\" the waitress, a buxom young woman with thick black hair approached them, \"How can I help…?\" Then she noticed who she was looking at. \"Lone Starr!?\" she gasped. \"Tripley?\" the hero was just as surprised. For a moment they stared at each other blankly. Then Tripley slapped him across the face. \"How dare you walk out on me for some spoiled and rotten princess!\" she snarled. \"Well, I see you haven't changed,\" Lone Starr said, feeling his sore jaw, \"How long have you been working here?\" \"Eight months,\" Tripley said, \"I suppose you've been good and happy now that you're Cosmos's Spaceman of the Year twice now.\" \"Yeah, well, that's not quite all it's made out to be,\" Lone Starr admitted, \"So, you ever get married?\" \"I really don't think that's your business anymore,\" Tripley retorted, \"You gave it up when you married what's her name.\" \"Vespa,\" Barf told her. \"Well, I'm sure you and her have plenty of great midnight conversations,\" Tripley said dismissively. \"Well, to be honest, Tripley, I've kind of been having a little difficulty with…\" Lone Starr started to say. \"May I take your order or not!?\" Tripley cut him off curtly. \"Lone Starr, what the hell are you hanging around for!?\" Yogurt spoke up again from the air. \"Yogurt!?\" Lone Starr looked around for him. \"No, we don't have any yogurt here,\" Tripley said, \"And you don't get dessert just like that; you need to order a main course.\" \"No, that's my boss; Barf and I have to get going; we'll take the soup to go,\" Lone Starr said. \"Fine, I'll bring the check,\" Tripley stormed off. \"Yeah, same old Tripley,\" Lone Starr said nostalgically, \"\"Hard edged and not a drop of compassion.\" \"Yep, you and her had some great times together,\" Barf mused, \"Why'd the two of you ever break it off in the first place?\" \"I can't even remember,\" Lone Starr said, \"But boy what I wouldn't give to go through it again. Some of the things we did were just so…\" There was an anguished cry from down the counter as yet another poor customer was finding out the hard way why it was a bad idea to order the special. \"Well, we can come back for the check later,\" Lone Starr said, rising to his feet. \"Absolutely,\" Barf followed him back out, \"It's not going anywhere.\" \"Make way for Jingo Belz,\" the guard in the hall called out to the control room.[Chapter 6] SIX \"So Brian, how do you like the part so far?\" Kate asked her son. \"I can't believe you made me wear this stupid asparagus suit again!\" Brian lamented his costume. \"Well, honey, that was the only costume we had available,\" his mother pointed out, \"What would you have wanted to go as?\" \"Roof the Two-headed Nurse.\" \"Roof again,\" Willie muttered. He fiddled with his druid costume. \"Kate, this didn't shrink in the wash, did it?\" he asked her. \"It shouldn't have,\" Kate frowned, \"I haven't washed it in months.\" \"Hey Tanner, phone for you,\" one of Willie's fellow civil servants called out, holding out a wall phone. \"Thank you Rod,\" Willie picked it up. \"Hello? Hi Raquel, is there a problem? HE'S DOING WHAT!!!!??????\" The party music abruptly stopped and everyone turned to look at Willie. He smiled nervously at this unintended attention. \"I mean, are you sure?\" he asked, a pale look on his face, \"Well, I'll get on it right—DON'T CALL THE COPS!!!! I mean, I'm sure nothing criminal is—well, thanks for telling me.\" He hung up and ran over to his family. \"We have to go, right now,\" he said breathlessly. \"What happened?\" Kate looked worried. \"I can't say here, too many people might overhear us; where's Lynn?\" Willie glanced around. \"She went in the bathroom with Lash; she's been in there for about a half hour,\" Brian told him. \"Oh, nice,\" Willie groaned, knowing what this entailed, \"Well, Brian, go tell her we have to leave.\" \"But she's in the girls' room, I can't go in there!\" Brian protested. \"Close your eyes and don't look at anything,\" Kate instructed him. As Brian ran off, she looked Willie in the eye and said, \"It's Alf, isn't it?\" \"And then some,\" Willie admitted, \"He's really gone too far this time.\" \"Explain to me why we're going down here when we've already hired Belz to bring in the Melmacian,\" Sandurz asked Helmet as the transport carrying their attack squad lurched down toward North America.[Chapter 7] SEVEN \"I'm going to kill Alf for this, I swear I'm going to kill him,\" Kate grumbled. \"No, honey, I've got first dibs on murdering him,\" Willie told her, struggling wildly in his straightjacket, \"I put down the first lease on this house.\" \"No, if I remember correctly it was the loan from my mother that got us this in the first place,\" Kate argued. \"No no, I distinctly remember…\" \"Will you two please grow up?\" Lynn interrupted, \"Point is, we've got to get out of here before these goons actually try to kill us—or that clown starts singing again. I'll jump off the roof if he does another accordion solo.\" \"I don't know why this is so difficult,\" Willie said, struggling harder, \"I saw a magician get out of one of these about fifteen years ago from the front row of the Orpheum, and I thought I could remember the exact sequence of moves he made. I think first I have to dislocate my shoulder, then try to move…\" \"Or I could just let you out, Dad,\" Brian walked over to him, completely free of his straightjacket. His father did a double take. \"How'd…When'd…?\" he sputtered. \"It was too big,\" Brian held it up for Willie to see, \"I could just crawl out through the neck hole. Turn around and I'll have you loose.\" Before he could start, however, Helmet and Belz came back into the living room. \"Hey, how'd the kid get loose?\" the evil leader exclaimed \"Run Brian,run!\" Kate nudged him off, then tripped Helmet when he rushed forward to try and grab her son. Belz pursued Brian out the back door. \"You're not getting away from me, young one!\" he shouted, firing off-target blasts from his freeze ray. From their vantage point atop a walnut tree in one of the few open spaces left in the Tanners' backyard, Lone Starr and Alf looked down at the sounds of the sounds of the blasting. \"If I were you, I'd help that asparagus escape,\" the Melmacian said. \"Right; Barf,\" Lone Starr nodded to his associate, how swung himself upside down on a branch and casually plucked Brian up as he ran by. \"Don't scream, don't scream,\" Alf reassured his friend as he was plucked down, \"These guys are here for our protection.\" \"Well some job you guys did!\" Brian berated the two interstellar visitors, \"There's Spaceguns all over my house!\" \"Spaceballs,\" Lone Starr corrected him, \"And shhhh! Don't give us away to Jingo Belz.\" \"Where are you, kid?\" the bounty hunter could be heard yelling below. The four of them looked out threw the branches as Belz looked left and right for his quarry. Finally, the big snowman shrugged in disgust and headed back into the \"hotel.\" \"Captain Lone Starr,\" the hero formally introduced himself to Brian, \"This is my sidekick Barf.\" \"What planet do you come from?\" Brian asked Barf, amazed at his ears and tail. \"Mawgiter,\" Barf told him, \"I'm a mawg, half man, half dog. I'm my own best friend. You know we saw your pal Gordon here on Melmac about fifteen years ago when he was the headlining act at the Galactic Dunes Resort Hotel.\" \"You were in the third row on the left side, am I right?\" Alf asked. \"Yeah,\" Lone Starr said, \"And I can truly say that was the worst three hours of comedy I've ever seen.\" \"Thank you for your vote of confidence in my abilities, O mighty protector,\" Alf said sarcastically, \"Now if you don't mind, there's some nice people in there I'd like to get away from Dark Helmet.\" \"Doesn't look like it'll be that easy,\" Barf said, glancing through the branches, \"I think we've got company coming.\" \"So did you catch him?\" Sandurz asked Belz as he came back into the living room.[Chapter 8] \"So, how'd you like dinner tonight?\" Skroob asked his mistresses Charlene and Marlene as they lay on his presidential bed. \"It was stimulating, Mr. President,\" Marlene (or was it Charlene?) told him, sighing in a contented manor, \"Tell me that dessert will be just as refreshing.\" \"Oh you know it will,\" Skroob started unbuttoning his pajama top, \"Now if you ladies are ready, we'll serve it right now.\" Both twins giggled in delight. Skroob cracked open a nearby bottle of champagne and poured them all glasses. The three of them crawled under the covers, ready for \"dessert\"… \"President Skroob,\" Zircon announced suddenly over the TeleWall. Skroob jumped in shock, spilling champagne everywhere. \"What? he shouted scrambling to put his pajamas back on. \"Sir, Lord Helmet just sent notification that he located the last Melmacian,\" Zircon told him, \"He was unable to capture it, but he detained the people harboring it.\" \"What do you mean he failed to detain it?\" Skroob said in a hyper voice partially out of his lingering shock and partially because of his frustration at Helmet's incompetence. \"The law enforcement officials of the planet intervened, but as I mentioned earlier, he took hostages,\" Zircon continued matter-of-factually, \"In the meantime, he says he collected enough hair to feed the fleet of T.A.R.G.E.T.s. We should be able to initiate the first full-scale test of the explosives when they arrive back at Planet Spaceball in about fourteen hours.\" \"All right, we'll have the welcoming party ready for them,\" Skroob said, \"In the meantime, don't bother me again for the rest of the night, OK?\" \"Yes sir,\" Zircon saluted and signed off. Disinterested, Skroob turned back to the bed. \"Where were we?\" he asked his women. \"We're millions of miles from home,\" Willie muttered softly from their detention cell as Spaceball 2 lumbered back across the cosmos, \"We're in the clutches of psychopaths who came for our alien. We haven't eaten in a day and a half, we have no contact with the outside world, we may never get home again, and the lavatory facilities are appalling. And I thought that…yes?\" There had been a knocking at the air duct. A nervous set of eyes peered through. \"Mister,\" he breathed, \"Don't you feel strange here? I can't take it much more! I feel like the walls are closing in! I've got to get out of here!\" \"Guard! Get back to work!\" came Sandurz's voice from the hallway. \"Yes sir, Colonel Sandurz,\" the man next door said. There was a shuffling of feet as he left. Moments later the Tanners' cell door opened. \"So, how have you liked our accommodations so far?\" the colonel asked as he and Helmet walked in with a trio of guards. \"Well, to be honest, I'd like to complain to the manager,\" Willie rose to his feet, but the guards shoved him back down. \"Listen, Lord Vader,\" he told Helmet, \"Since Alf seems to be the issue here, you really don't need us anymore...\" \"On the contrary, we need you to lure out Gordon Shumway,\" Helmet said, \"In a few minutes you will make an intergalactic speech to that failed yukster telling him to come out in the open if he wants to see you again.\" \"Well, what would you say if I told you I've washed my hands of him and therefore refuse to do it?\" Willie posed. \"I'll say that if you refuse, my apprentice Count Cuckoo…\" Helmet paused while the hunchbacked creature strolled forward with a barbeque of hot coals before continuing, \"will brand the word Helmet all over your pretty daughter's face!\" From seemingly out of nowhere, a dramatic piece of suspense music rang out from above. Everyone glanced upward until it stopped. \"You wouldn't dare!\" Kate gasped once it ended. \"Cuckoo,\" Helmet told his apprentice. Cuckoo shoved a branding iron into the coals. \"Hot stuff coming in, and I'm not talking about myself!\" he lisped, advancing toward Lynn. \"Dad!\" she protested, \"is there really any question what to do here?\" \"Uh, um, uh…\" Willie wavered until Cuckoo was about five feet from his daughter. \"All right, I'll do it!\" he groaned, \"But I hope you'd agree…\" \"Thank you,\" Helmet took hold of Willie and dragged him out into the hall. \"You'll be working with our special universal translator,\" the villain said, pointing to a mime standing up the corridor, \"He'll be sending out your message loud and clear in case Shumway tries to play stupid. And don't think you can send him secret messages. Cuckoo, the collar.\" Cuckoo produced an electric shock collar. \"Uh, you don't need that,\" Willie gulped, \"I won't be sending him any warnings.\" \"It doesn't matter,\" Helmet nodded to his apprentice, who dragged Willie away. Once they were gone, he raised his visor. \"Was I too dark there, Sandurz?\" he asked the colonel. \"Not at all sir, and you were in character,\" Sandurz told him, \"We are a ruthless race of beings, after all.\" \"Right,\" Helmet nodded, \"Well, we'd better get set to send that message. Jam all transmissions within twelve thousand parsecs.\" \"Absolutely; watch the door sir,\" Sandurz's warning came too late as the nearest sliding door closed on Helmet, trapping him. \"We're leaving the solar system now,\" Barf announced, \"There go Alvin and Dave.\" \"There really are an Alvin and Dave?\" Brian ran to the window, \"Wow, it is true!\" \"Well, sure, everybody in the galaxy knows about Alvin and Dave,\" Barf said. He leaned over and whispered to Lone Starr, \"Boy, is their planet way behind the rest of the universe.\" Lone Starr nodded softly as Brian hefted the camera he'd brought along and snapped pictures of the planets. \"OK, everybody buckle up, we're going through the wormhole into the next sector of the galaxy,\" he announced over the loudspeaker. \"Say Lone Starr, how much further to that restaurant?\" Alf asked from the intercom at the other end of the Winnebago, \"This poor soul can't go on too much longer.\" \"Just about ten more minutes, keep your hair on,\" Lone Starr told him. \"That might be hard, since it's about this time of year that I start shedding the most, and since…\" Lone Starr disconnected. \"I hate it when people take things literally,\" he told Barf, \"And if he goes crazy at the diner, I'm tossing him out into space.\" \"Well you know Melmacians, boss, they can never control the urge to eat,\" Barf pointed out, holding on as the Winnebago started shaking as it made its way through the rough wormhole, \"I'm surprised he hasn't started destroying our own kitchen yet.\" \"True, but I've got it on Orange Alert,\" Lone Starr said, \"Good thing we have everything edible under lock and key.\" They emerged unscathed from the wormhole. Ahead of them shone the lights of the space stop. \"Great, another continuity error,\" Barf mumbled, \"When will this guy realize ten minutes means ten minutes?\" \"Well, better early than late,\" Alf shuffled into the cockpit, \"As long as they at least have catfish, I'll be happy.\" \"What do they have to eat in space?\" Brian joined his friend, \"I'd like some white boiled potatoes. Or some ice cream.\" \"I'm sure they have some of those,\" Lone Starr said as he nosed the Winnebago down to a smooth landing, \"But whatever you do, don't order the Special.\" \"Why not?\" \"Trust us, you don't want to,\" Barf told him, \"And try not to get to far away from us; there's some rough people in these diners.\" They strolled into the diner. \"Well, it's about time you showed up again, Lone Starr,\" came Tripley's voice from behind them, \"First you run out on me without proposing, now you run out without paying the check.\" \"Well you see, Tripley, we had to save Gordon here from Dark Helmet,\" Lone Starr pointed to Alf. \"Oh great, Gordon Shumway,\" Tripley grimaced, \"I've seen enough of him to last a lifetime.\" \"Thank you,\" Alf bowed, \"In the meantime, babe, get me a roast Manx with gravy.\" \"We don't serve cats here, thank you very much,\" Tripley said sternly. \"How about catfish?\" Alf plopped down at the counter. \"I'd like white boiled potatoes,\" Brian tugged at Tripley's dress, \"And some milk, please.\" Before Tripley could comment, the video screens stationed all throughout the restaurant started fritzing out. \"What the hell?\" she exclaimed tapping the nearest one. \"I think I know what the problem is,\" Alf said, glancing at the one next to him. Purple fluid was pouring out of the top of the screen. \"It's been jammed,\" he informed the waitress. He licked it for good measure. \"With grape.\" \"That's impossible,\" Tripley mused, \"Our system is internal; it's jam-proof. There's no way…now what?\" The screen had settled down. Helmet was now on it. \"Good evening Frankfurt Galaxy,\" he announced, \"We've taken the liberty of jamming all your screens to get your undivided attention. We'd now like to introduce Mr. William Tanner, who will deliver our message to you.\" He stepped aside to reveal Willie, now hooked up to a large vertical rack with a sign on top labeled SPACEBALLS THE TORTURE-O-MATIC 5,000, the translator mime on one side and a Spaceball trooper on his other side holding a laser gun to his head. \"Hello,\" the beleaguered human said as the mime simultaneously began giving the hands gestures, \"This message is for Alf, or Gordon Shumway as most of the rest of us know him. The great and powerful Lord Dark Helmet is holding Kate, Lynn, and myself prisoner. You have twenty-four hours to turn yourself in to Spaceball custody. You're to go to the memorial to Lord Helmet's father, Kerr Ash Helmet, near…Kerr Ash Helmet?\" he gave a strange look off camera, \"His father's name was Kerr Ash…?\" Behind him, Cuckoo simultaneously pressed the button for the shock collar and threw the switch for the Torture-O-Matic. Willie tensed up and vibrated as the electricity went through his system. \"All right, all right!\" he groaned, \"As I was saying, Alf, meet us near the statue to Lord Helmet's father on Jupiter 2 sometime within the next twenty-four hours and surrender yourself to be shaved. Fail in this, and the three of us will be killed tomorrow night on Execution Tonight, the longest running and highest rated program in the history of the Spaceball Broadcasting Company, the biggest…what is that supposed to mean?\" he was distracted by some of the mime's crazy gestures. Cuckoo shocked him again in response. \"Anyway,\" Willie took deep breaths once the clown had finished, \"You're to come alone; no help form Captain Lone Starr or anyone else. And try to be clean; we don't want dirty hair.\" He leaned forward and added, \"On a personal note, Alf, let me just say, HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO ME!?\" he roared straight into the camera, \"I HAVEN'T EATEN, I HAVEN'T SLEPT, YOU LOUSY…!\" His next words, and many of those following, were bleeped out. Alf covered Brian's ears. \"Willie, how could you!?\" he said in surprise, \"I didn't know you watched that much Richard Pryor!\" Willie received his most violent shock from the Torture-O-Matic to date. Helmet stepped back into frame. \"I would also like to add that just in case Shumway chooses not to show at the time we just gave, I'm putting out a five million spacebuck bounty on his head, applicable to anyone who wishes to bring him in. Good luck in finding him. And now, we end this transmission with more gratuitous shocking.\" He gave Cuckoo the thumbs-up, and his apprentice cranked the Torture-O-Matic's juice up full blast. Willie's hair jerked straight up, and smoke poured from his ears. Alongside him, the mime imitated the electrocution as the screens were returned to normal. \"How could they do that to Dad?\" Brian asked, horrified by what he'd just seen his father go through. 'Simple Brian, they're Spaceballs, nothing matters to…\" Alf noticed that everyone else in the diner was now giving him strange looks. \"What?\" he asked. \"Oh nothing,\" one bearded space redneck said. Even so, there was no mistaking the clicking sounds of laser pistols being activated. \"Uh, you really think Helmet's going to pay you five million big ones?\" he pointed out. \"I don't care,\" said a space biker, hefting a sawed-off laser gun, \"It's worth the potential payoff.\" \"How about if I give you some money out of my own bank…\" Alf started to say, but a blast that just barely missed his head cut him off. \"Uh, just remembered, I left my lights on,\" he said, inching toward the door. There was a mad rush toward him. \"Get the Melmacian!\" somebody shouted. Alf dashed toward the kitchen. \"Anytime you're ready, Lone Starr, you can started defending me!\" he called out. Lone Starr ran into the midst of the goons and started throwing haymakers. \"Sorry boys, Yogurt says no hands on Mr. Shumway,\" he said. \"I already had yogurt this morning,\" a space trucker pummeled him in the chest and tossed him aside. Barf tried throwing a few left hooks, but a bottle to his head knocked him out as well. The trucker led the mob into the kitchen. \"Come out come out wherever you are!\" he called out. Alf popped out of the nearest crock-pot. \"Here's your pie sir,\" he said, throwing a coconut custard one into the trucker's face, \"Keep the change,\" he said, heading for the rear exit. Unfortunately, a group of intergalactic postal workers blocked his way. They hefted submachine laser guns and opened fire. Alf turned and headed back into the restaurant itself. The chase went around and around the dining area and kitchen about seven times before Alf jumped behind the counter when he was in a blind spot. The mob foolishly kept running around in circles several times until one of them realized Alf was no longer in front of them. There he goes!\" he shouted, pointing to the Melmacian as he and Brian dragged the two space heroes out onto the space stop pad. \"Block that door,\" Alf instructed Brian, who obligingly held the door shut as best he could as the mob pounded on the other side. Alf ran over to a nearby interstellar rig, climbed into the cab, bent down, hotwired the engine, and pulled it up to the front door, blocking it. \"Do you think you're getting a little extreme, Alf?' Brian asked him. \"Better safe than sorry, I always say,\" Alf said, throwing the gearshift into park. There was angry pounding from the mob against the blocked door, but they proved helpless to force it open. Lone Starr and Barf groaned as they came to behind Alf. \"What happened?\" the mawg asked, rubbing his head where he'd been hit. \"Oh nothing, I almost got killed and just managed to escape, no thanks to either of you,\" Alf told him. \"Well, I hope you're proud of yourself,\" came Tripley's voice from behind her dazed ex-boyfriend, apparently having also slipped outside in the confusion, \"You've managed to destroy my job in just under ten minutes.\" \"Well look at the good news,\" Alf told her, \"You can still save a ton on your car insurance if you switch to Geico.\" \"How'd you get out here?\" Lone Starr asked. \"I slipped out while they were chasing the Melmacian through the kitchen,\" Tripley explained, \"When the customers start getting like a lynch mob, this diner's no place to be a woman. I'm going with you.\" \"Why?\" Barf frowned. \"Because A, this story needs a strong woman, and B, there's not much left for me here,\" Tripley told him. \"Sure, why not?\" Lone Starr shrugged, \"Might as well taken in more guests.\" \"OK, you two work it out, I'll drive,\" Alf hopped into the Winnebago's cab, \"Next stop, Spaceball City…I guess.\"[Chapter 9] NINE \"So, where exactly are we going?\" Tripley asked, sticking her head in through the curtain to the Winnebago's cockpit. \"Yogurt's,\" Lone Starr told her, \"I need his advice on what to do with Shumway next. With the bounty Helmet's put on him, we really can't take him anywhere else right now.\" \"After watching him drive this thing earlier, I was really tempted to turn him in myself,\" Tripley admitted, \"But thankfully for his sake, I can't remember Helmet's cell number.\" \"Neither can the rest of the galaxy, so don't feel bad,\" Lone Starr said, frowning as little as he thought over whether his sentence had made much sense. He glanced up at her. \"So, like I asked earlier, did you ever marry?\" \"No,\" Tripley plopped down in what was normally Barf's seat, \"I couldn't find the right man. At least you found yours.\" \"Lately I've been questioning that choice,\" Lone Starr sighed, \"Life after happily ever after isn't what it's made out to be.\" \"To be honest, I didn't think you'd last five weeks with Vespa once word of the wedding got out,\" Tripley told him, \"What did you see in her?\" \"Several things, most of which I can't say out loud here without alienating the younger readers,\" Lone Starr said, \"To tell you the truth, Tripley, my relationship with Vespa at least on a passionate level is turning out to be a lot like Dan Versus Dave. It looked so great leading up to it, but it never materialized the way I'd hoped. I mean, on our honeymoon, everything looked so perfect—the moon was bright, the stars were shining, and the violinists Vespa requested for atmosphere outside the room played perfectly. And we did have the greatest possible sexual encounter that night—without actually having sex, that is. That's what it's like. Plus, being a prince isn't for me, I've realized too late.\" \"How you ever get accepted as a prince?\" Tripley asked him. \"Remember my medallion?\" Lone Starr pulled it up from his neck, \"Yogurt told me it's a royal birth certificate. I'm a genuine prince.\" \"You should wash it more often,\" Tripley said. \"Well, I've been a bit busy lately, and the metalworkers won't…\" \"Not the medallion, your neck,\" she said. \"Oh,\" Lone Starr said sheepishly, \"Well, anyway, princeship isn't my cup of tea. I miss being able to do whatever I wanted whenever I wanted. And I'm not really that keen on succeeding King Roland. I love Druidia, but I don't want to be king.\" \"Well, it appears I was wrong,\" Tripley said, \"Becoming royalty hasn't changed you at all. You're still the same Lone Starr I knew all those years ago.\" \"Thanks,\" Lone Starr forced a smile. Before the conversation could go any further, Alf strolled into the cockpit. \"Hey Lone Starr, once we're done with Yogurt, we've got to stop at the nearest appliance dealer,\" he told the hero. \"Why?\" Lone Starr frowned. \"You need a new fridge,\" Alf told him. \"Why? Is it broken?\" \"It's gone,\" Tripley glanced back to see it missing. \"What did you do with it, Gordon?\" Lone Starr asked the Melmacian. \"Well, you see, I couldn't break the lock to get the snack I wanted, so I…well, let's just say I more than fulfilled my iron requirement for the day,' Alf said, unable to stop a burp from erupting from his stomach. \"You ate my refrigerator?\" Lone Starr jumped to his feet, \"All our food was in there! What the hell are the rest of us going to eat now?\" \"I was thinking Yogurt could answer that when we drop by his place,\" Alf told him, \"Now if you'll excuse me, I was watching SCTV with Brian and Barf.\" He strolled back to the rear of the Winnebago. \"SCTV?\" Lone Starr looked at his former love, \"They actually get the feed from this part of the galaxy?\" Riotous laughter told him this was indeed the case. \"I'll handle it,\" Tripley said. She strode back to find everyone lounged in easy chairs. \"Wanna join us, Trip?\" Barf said, offering a busted lawn chair for her. \"Dr. Cheryl Kinsey's going to tell us how to fake orgasms,\" Brian added. \"And you're actually letting a kid his age watch something like that?\" Tripley gave the mawg and Melmacian harsh glares. \"Well it's a great show,\" Barf protested, \"He's going to love the bit coming up where Johnny LaRue tries to host his own telethon…or was that Dr. Tongue?\" \"And it exposes him to a new way of thinking that is usually denied the average eight year old on the Planet Earth,\" Alf patted Brian on the shoulder. Tripley let out an aggravated groan. \"You know something, Shumway, you're not just a terrible comedian, you're a terrible moralist. We're trying to stop the Spaceballs from killing innocent people, and you're sitting back here and watching old sketch shows!\" she berated him, \"And on top of that you eat not just all the food on this camper but the fridge too! Melmacians may have been a silly group of being, but you put them all to shame!\" \"And happy Valentine's Day to you too, Cupid,\" Alf responded. \"Alf's not bad,\" Brian put his hand around the alien, \"He's my best friend in the whole universe. He makes mistakes, but he cares deep down. Even when he screws up…which seems to happen a lot.\" \"You see Tripley, appearances are skin deep,\" Alf said triumphantly, \"As a matter of fact, I've been worried sick about my adopted Earth family ever since Helmet carted them off, and believe you me, I've been pondering some new strategies that'll make old Tinhead's glasses crack. Let's just hope they survive incarceration for us to save them. Incidentally, I wonder how they're holding up.\" \"Look straight ahead toward the camera,\" the commandant of Prison Ball 37 on Spaceball City told the Tanners inside their holding cell. He turned to the gigantic camera at the other end of the room and gave the cameraman a thumbs-up. A blinding flash filled the room. \"Ouch!\" Willie groaned, trying to shield his eyes, \"What are you trying to do, blind us?\"[Chapter 10] TEN \"Any sign of Shumway yet?\" Helmet asked the trooper in charge of the force he'd had staked out on Jupiter 2 for Alf on the TeleWall. \"No Lord Helmet, no Shumway and no Winnebago; no nothing, really,\" the trooper admitted. \"Well keep waiting,\" Helmet advised him, \"Shumway's bound to show at one point or another.\" \"As you say, Lord Helmet,\" the trooper signed off. Helmet raised his visor. \"What's taking that twit so long?\" he asked Sandurz, \"The last time we met up with him before Melmac was destroyed, he was willing to do whatever we told him.\" \"Are you sure that was Shumway, sir?\" Sandurz pointed out, \"That sounds more like Althouse to me.\" \"Ah, who knows the difference between individual Melmacians anyway?\" Helmet shrugged, \"Well, if Shumway cares about the people that took him in, he's got about eleven hours left to show.\" \"Speaking of time, sir, it's about time we fully test the T.A.R.G.E.T.s' schematics,\" Sandurz said, looking at his watch, \"Shall we go?\" \"Of course,\" Helmet said, pulling down the visor again, \"I always like to be punctual, Sandurz. You know that.\" \"Of course sir,\" Sandurz said sycophantically. The two of them strode down the corridors of the Capitol building to the main conference room. Numerous high-level Spaceball government officials were already milling about, murmuring to each other. In the back of the room, Cuckoo was making a few final adjustments to a large prototype T.A.R.G.E.T. set up at the back of a large launch ramp. \"Is it ready, Cuckoo?\" Helmet asked his protégé. \"It is all set to go once the president throws the switch, Master,\" Cuckoo told him, \"Our guests are going to love it, aren't you?\" He turned to the Tanners, who were being held at laser rifle point by almost a half dozen guards. \"Good morning Mr. Tanner,\" Helmet greeted Willie, \"I trust you enjoyed your first and possibly only night here on Spaceball City?\" \"Well it was all fine until your guards started stamping up and down the hall at four a.m. blowing their trumpets like there was no tomorrow,\" a bleary-eyed Willie told the evil leader. \"Ah yes, the old early reveille,\" Sandurz said, pride in his voice, \"Nothing gets prisoners up and going like a loud trumpet blast. I should probably tell you that I've taken the liberty of pre-booking you on tonight's episode of Execution Tonight.\" \"You've what?\" Kate's eyes went wide. \"Don't worry, if Gordon Shumway turns himself in no later than a half hour before taping, we'll push you back to next week,\" Cuckoo told her, \"And if not, look at the bright side; you get to die on national TV. That's an honor in and of itself.\" There was a loud slamming as Skroob ran into the room, accidentally nailing a technician with the door. \"Sorry I'm late,\" he called to his ministers, oblivious to what had just happened, \"I had, uh important, um, business of state to attend to.\" \"I'm sure he did,\" Helmet muttered sarcastically to Sandurz. \"General Mills, are your volunteers ready?\" Skroob asked the alien-droid crossbreed. \"Yes, I have four ready to sacrifice themselves,\" Mills pointed to four nearby droids, who gave Skroob the national salute. \"Good for you, Mills,\" Skroob patted the commander on the shoulder, \"When I point to them, give them their instructions.\" The president walked over to the microphone set up on his presidential podium and tapped it several times. \"Can I have your…?\" he tried to say, but the hissing was so loud that he couldn't get a word in edgewise. Rolling his eyes, he slapped the microphone so hard that it died. \"Perfect!\" he muttered to himself. \"Can I have your attention please, gentlemen?\" he shouted at the top of his lungs, \"If you'll please be seated, we'll begin this demonstration.\" His ministers quickly took their seats. \"Now,\" Skroob shouted on, \"As many of you know but really don't know, Planet Spaceball is going through yet another air shortage crisis as we speak. The filters in orbit around the planet are failing, and import tariffs are too high for our liking. My Minister of the Atmosphere, Mr. Dom Asshole, who has graced us with his presence today, has told…\" There was snickering from the back. \"Excuse me, may I help you there?\" Skroob shouted at pitch level to Willie. \"Sorry, I just…\" Willie couldn't help controlling uncharacteristic laughter, \"…I mean, that's really his name? Dom Asshole?\" \"That's right, sir,\" announced a cross-eyed minister who rose to his feet, \"And I'm pleased to say that many of my fellow Assholes have equally key positions in this government and military. In fact, you might say both of them are practically run by Assholes.\" \"Well, that's usually the case in most dictatorships,\" Willie pointed out. \"Thank you for your not so kind words, buddy,\" Skroob told the earthling, \"Now if you'll please, sit back down and put a cork in it for the rest of this presentation. Anyway, as I was saying, Mr. Asshole has informed me that at the current rate of decline, we'll be completely out of air within two years. I for one am not going to let that happen, not when our neighbor Planet Druidia has a ten thousand year air supply of its own that it just refuses to share with us because we're evil. So, you may ask, how do we get that air, without resorting to some hackneyed plan that's been done a million times before? Well gentlemen, the answer is the easy way out; we simply blow it up with one hand and suck the air with the other; in short, we suck and blow—and no, I'm not alluding to what we do when our wives' backs are turned. And for this purpose, I give to you our new weapon of mass destruction, the T.A.R.G.E.T.!\" He gestured grandly to the T.A.R.G.E.T at the back of the conference room. Cuckoo threw the switch on the spotlight overlooking the vehicle, which Charlene and Marlene—having snuck in during the opening address—proceeded to model for. \"Each T.A.R.G.E.T. has a Mach IX V8,000,000 horsepower engine, and can go from zero to sixty billion in two seconds,\" Skroob informed his ministers, \"It also comes with power windows, AM/FM stereo, Scotch guard, cruise control, optional dual side climate control, and California emission. Underneath the hood is a fifty gigaton warhead made up of nitroglycerin, Melmacian hair, and one of our commander Colonel Sandurz's secret recipes.\" It was Lynn's turn to break up. \"Do you have something to say, young lady?\" Skroob asked her. \"Oh nothing, but I'm sure the Colonel's secret recipe's a nice juicy one,\" Lynn chuckled, \"And why honestly would you name a weapon a T.A.R.G.E.T.? it makes no sense.\" Skroob ignored the question. \"Anyway, as I was going to say before I was cut off AGAIN, we will now demonstrate for you the probable effects to T.A.R.G.E.T. will have on Planet Druidia once we launch the existing models from our base on Exodosus,\" he continued. He lifted a remote control and pressed the button that he thought would open the bay doors in the front of the conference room. Nothing seemed to be happening, however. \"Strange, very strange,\" he muttered as he clicked the button over and over again, \"Why won't this damn thing work?\" He kept clicking, and managed to turn out the lights in the room, activate a stereo system hidden somewhere, switch to a channel showing the soap opera As the Galaxy Spins, and start the whole room spinning around in circles (it was apparently built on a turntable of some kind) before one of his aides took the remote off him and pressed the correct button. Skroob winked at him as the bay doors opened. \"Now,\" he continued to his nauseated ministers, \"As you'll on the monitors in front of you, we'll built an exact replica of Druidia, right down to the Druidians themselves in the asteroid field 5 parsecs from here. Press the buttons in front of you to change to a different camera angle at any point. \"Amazing,\" Kate mused as she and her husband and daughter examined their screen, \"It's an almost perfect match…well, except for those dumb looking people nodding their heads. \"It looks a scene from Blazing Saddles,\" Willie agreed, \"Almost too much so.\" \"Here's how it'll work,\" Skroob explained, \"Once the launch trench alignment with Druidia is perfect three days from now, we'll use our satellites to open the air shield.\" He pressed out the combination on the keypad in front of himself, \"After it opened,…This'll have to be quick, Mr. Tanner, we haven't got all day here.\" \"Um, sorry Mr. President, but you typed in 1-2-3-4-5 as the combination,\" Willie pointed out. \"And?\" Skroob raised an eyebrow. \"Oh nothing, it's just, um, that's, that's exactly the type of combination an idiot would have on his luggage.\" Skroob grunted uncomfortably. \"As I was trying to say, we then have our men board the T.A.R.G.E.T.s,\" the president nodded to General Mills, who pointed first at his volunteer droids and then at the T.A.R.G.E.T. Saluting both him and Skroob, the droids climbed into the vehicle and strapped themselves into each of the four seats inside. Cuckoo slid the hatch shut behind them. Skroob turned a large dial on the podium marked START T.A.R.G.E.T. The sound of the giant engine roaring to life caused everyone in the room to cover their ears in pain. \"OK, keep your eyes open,\" Skroob told them all, even though no one was listening anymore, \"'Cause here we go.\" He inserted a key into a lock labeled LAUNCH—the wrong way. In his efforts to get it back out, he broke the key. \"Hey Belz, give me a hand here,\" he called over to the bounty hunter, who'd been standing up against the back wall with little to do. Jingo strolled over, examined the lock, and iced it with his freeze ray. Smashing the frozen lock, the big snowman reached inside and twisted it manually. The T.A.R.G.E.T. rocketed up the ramp—setting on fire several technicians who'd been standing right behind the jets—and out into space. Skroob pressed another button on the podium. \"The air retrieval unit is now armed, gentlemen,\" he told his ministers now that the room had quieted down, \"Once the warhead is detonated, it'll suck up every breath of the air we put inside the fake Druidia it can. Speaking of detonation, put on your protective goggles now, because we've got impact in five, four, three, two, one…\" On every monitor in the room, the T.A.R.G.E.T. reached the fake Druidia and exploded in a huge flash of white light. A loud sucking sound was heard over the explosion. Out of the bright white glow, a small circular probe zipped back across the stars toward Planet Spaceball. It reentered the conference room through the bay doors and landed on the floor—seconds before a blast of radiation, rock, and droid limbs rained down on everyone. Skroob strolled over and picked up the probe. \"As you can see, gentlemen, it's taken up every bit of air it could,\" he said, pointing to the gauge on the side reading FULL. He didn't seem to notice or care that everybody's hair was now standing straight up from the radiation. \"In short, we will soon have all of Druidia air for ten thousand years of use and be rid of them once and for all. Are they any questions?\" \"Can we get this on video?\" one minister asked, watching the explosion on instant replay on his monitor. \"We'll save the destruction of Druidia itself for a DVD release,\" Skroob said, \"In the meantime, this concludes our little meeting. You can go and decontaminate yourselves now, gentlemen, thank you.\" The ministers gave a polite applause, quickly rose, and headed for the exits. Skroob strolled to the back of the room. \"Well Lord Helmet, did I tell you this would be a good idea or what?\" he asked his evil lieutenant. \"Well, let's just say it makes more sense than Armageddon did,\" Helmet said, forcing a smile. \"Are you kidding?\" Lynn spoke up, \"I love Armageddon.\" \"So, did you folks like it?\" Skroob asked the Tanners. \"Uh, it was, um, uh, very interesting,\" Willie said, \"Now, uh, if you have a minute, I'd like to file a formal grievance against your associates here. They've violated about a hundred of our civil rights in the last twenty-four hours.\" \"Are you serious?\" Skroob laughed, \"Violating other beings' civil rights is every Spaceball's born right. We wouldn't be Spaceballs if we didn't. But I'll tell you what. If your Melmacian doesn't show, I'll let you plead your case on TV tonight to the public when you get your last words. It'll make your death more entertaining.\" \"Wait, you're actually serious about this whole execution thing?\" Willie's expression went quite flat. \"Of course you dummy,\" Cuckoo gave him a shove to his feet, \"Now it's time to go back to your cell and await the final countdown.\" Pointing his own Schwartz ring at them, he and several guards herded the Tanners out of the conference room. Helmet raised his visor once they were gone. \"Boy, is that guy a weenie,\" he confided in Sandurz. \"And then some sir,\" Sandurz agreed. He turned to Skroob. \"Well Mr. President, would you like us here for the execution.\" \"Probably a good idea,\" Skroob surmised, \"There's no telling if Lone Starr might try anything, wherever he is now.\" \"Hey Yogurt,\" Lone Starr knocked on the doors to Yogurt's lair, \"You in there?\"[Chapter 11] ELEVEN \"It's no use,\"nKing Roland shook his head as the water from the running sink in thenbathroom was spilling out into the hall, \"We're going to have tonbreak it down. Somebody get the battering ram.\" \"No Daddy, youncan't!\" Vespa protested. \"Vespa my child,nsomething might have happened to your husband,\" her father pointednout. \"But if you breaknthe door down, you'll wreck the ivory hinges!\" Vespa cried,n\"This castle can't afford the cost of replacing them if they'rendestroyed!\" Roland groaned. \"Allnright Vespa, we won't use the ram,\" he sighed, \"We'll justnhave to take it off its hinges manually. Porter, see if you can findnthe royal disassembler somewhere on the grounds.\" \"Whatsa goin' onnhere?\" came the repulsive voice of the least liked inhabitant ofnRoland's castle. Tar-Tar, a hideous lime gangly…thing camenstriding up the hall. \"Issa something' goin' on with CaptainnLone Starr sir?\" \"Uh, we've got itnunder control, Tar-Tar,\" the king said quickly, \"Thanks for yournoffer, though.\" \"Uh oh, the sink,nshe'sa broke!\" Tar-Tar exclaimed, noticing the water spillage,n\"Don'ta worry Captain Lone Starr, meesa save you!\" he shouted,ntearing at the door. \"Break that door andnyou're a dead-thing!\" Vespa yelled, hitting him on thenshoulder. \"Ow! Thata hurt bad!\" Tar-Tar complained. \"Dot, why don'tnyou take Tar-Tar outside and try to tell him about the situationnhere,\" Roland asked the droidette. \"Why me, sir? \"Dotnasked, desperate not to do it. Roland gave her a look that told hernshe'd better do it or else. Sighing, she took Tar-Tar by the handnand rolled off with him, saying, \"Well, I guess you could say...\" \"A few days ago, angroup of interplanetary beings found themselves under attack by thenruthless Spaceball army. These beings promptly escaped from thenclutches of Dark Helmet to the deep reaches of space. Today stillnwanted by the Spaceballs, they exist thirsting for justice and peace.n If you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you can findnthem, maybe you could hire the ALF team.\" \"Hey Shumway, givenit a rest,\" Lone Starr called to him, \"You're starting to getnon my nerves with those fake promos.\" \"Well, just thoughtnyou'd like to hear one more,\" Alf shrugged. He glanced up at thenclock on the wall of the Winnebago. \"Well, it looks like we'rendefinitely going to have to go into Spaceball City now,\" he said,n\"The day Helmet gave's up.\" \"Well, let's hopena couple squadrons are camped at Kerr Ash Helmet's statue onnJupiter 2,\" Barf said, helping himself to a bowl of Dog StarnKibbles 'n Bits, \"The less we have to go through on SpaceballnCity, the better.\" \"I knewnKerr Ash Helmet,\" Alf commented, \"We fought together in the DronenWars. He got his head cut off.\" \"The Drones cut hisnhead off?\" Brian asked. \"No, he was tryingnto open a can of chicken noodle soup and was leaning too close to thenopener,\" Alf explained, \"He never did have much sense withnmechanical things.\" \"I thought younMelmacians only fought in one war?\" Tripley asked, trying out thenarms of the Indestructo Suit Yogurt had given her. \"As a whole we did,nbut this one night I was just finishing my sit-down routine, and thennext things I knew this conehead guy swept me from my dressing roomnand put me in his spaceship,\" Alf told her, \"He said they needednevery available person to fight the Drones. The rest was a blur.' \"Well tonight can'tnbe a blur,\" Lone Starr said, typing in coordinates to thenWinnebago's computer, \"Better we go in, get the people you need,nand get out. The longer we stay around, Shumway, the more dangernyou're in.\" \"I don't carenabout personal danger, Lone Starr,\" Alf cocked a disintegratingnpistol, \"The primary concern for me is the safety of the people Inlove. And incidentally, I have just the plan that'll get us pastnsecurity without being detected.\" \"Oh do you?\" LonenStarr raised his eyebrow. \"Why do I get thendistinct impression no one here trusts the hairy guy?\" Alf askednBrian. \"Maybe because theyndon't?\" Brian shrugged. \"Well we'll changenthat tonight,\" Alf started rooting through the Winnebago'sndressers. \"Hey Barfo, come here when you've got a spare minute. nThis plan of mine involves you heavily.\" The Tanners' cellndoor opened. \"OK you three,\" buzzed a droid with a laser gun,n\"Time to die on national TV. On your feet.\" \"But the twenty-fournhours aren't up yet!\" Willie protested, showing the droid hisnwatch, \"Alf still has twenty-one minutes!\" \"You think he'dnshow up now if he hasn't already?\" posed another droid, joiningnits associate, \"Hands in the air and be silent during contestantnprocessing.\" \"Listen, we'dnrather just die normally, and not on your shows,\" Kate tried tonappeal to the druids as they hustled her and her family out into thenhallway, \"I mean, I'm sure there's more worthy…contestantsnthan we are.\" \"Sorry, we'venalready put you on the promos, and we don't want to disappoint thenviewing public,\" said a Spaceball dressed in a fancy tuxedo with anclipboard, \"Here, sign these release forms exonerating us from anynliability in your expirations later.\" \"Uh, don't we getna phone call?\" Lynn asked as one of the guards slapped a nametagnsaying HELLO MY NAME IS LINNE on her chest, \"I wouldn't mindncalling my brother and telling him to, well, you know, to look for usnon TV tonight.\" \"Sorry, BellnGalactic service is out for this galaxy,\" the \"producer\" said,n\"Guards, would you be so kind to escort these contestants over tonStudio 66?\" \"Move it,\" thenguards and droids pushed the Tanners most unkindly through the hallsnof the Spaceball prison complex and through several other facilitiesnbefore arriving at the wings of a large television studio. About twondozen other convicts, some of them completely different species, werenbeing held outside two large doors with a sign saying DO NOT ENTERnSTUDIO WHEN RED LIGHT IS FLASHING OR ANY OTHER TIME; THIS DOES MEANnYOU. \"Line up,\" a guard stationed near the doors ordered, wavingna laser gun at the prisoners, \"We need you to be in the ordernyou're going on the air. You, pull in your tentacles.\" A squid-like alienngrowled angrily at the request, but several lasers in its face madenit back off. Satisfied all was ready, the producer announced, \"Threenminutes to tape,\" and walked off. \"Uh, pardon me,\" Willientapped the convict in front of him on the back, \"What are theynexecuting you for?\" \"Being in too manynbad moods,\" the convict told him. \"Oh,\" Willienfrowned, \"Well, I guess there's nothing on this planet that'snsacred. We're in for harboring a Melmacian, and frankly I think wengot a bum rap.\" \"Melmacian?\" thenconvict looked him over, \"Well, now I can understand why you'renhere. Nobody in this whole galaxy likes a Melmacian. They'renamong the most irritating forms of life imaginable. And anyone whonharbors them s even worse. Now I know why they saved the atomnchamber for you.\" \"Wait, what's thenatom chamber?\" Kate asked, not liking the sound of this. \"Oh, it's thenpunishment they always save for the end of the show,\" anothernprisoner piped up, \"I should know. I was the technical directornfor the last five years. Up until two hours ago.\" \"What did you do tonget here?\" Lynn asked. \"They switched overnto a droid production crew, so we human staff members got the deathnsentence,\" the prisoner said glumly. A group of people behind himngrunted in agreement. \"President Skroobnsalute!\" came the call up the hall. Skroob and his entourage werenwalking toward the convicts under heavy guard. \"HAIL SKROOB!\"nthe guards all shouted, giving the salute. \"Mr. President, Mr.nPresident, please, I need to file an appeal!\" Willie screamed innSkroob's direction, \"We're innocent, I swear! Come on, what donyou say, grant us a pardon and…\" Ah, shut it pal!\"nHelmet shouted at him, \"We're Spaceballs, we don't givenpardons.\" \"You tell him, LordnHelmet,\" Skroob nodded to his associate. As the group passednthrough a large doorway heading for a private booth, the presidentntold a guard, \"Lock it down.\" The guard nodded and hit a buttonnon the wall. No fewer than eight heavy vault-like blast doorsnlowered into place and locked. \"Extra security,\" the formerntechnical director told the Tanners, \"No point in risking thenpresident's life when there's a million unhappy felons around…asnif you couldn't have already guessed.\" \"Quiet for taping innfive, four, three, two, one,\" came a droid's voice over thenhallway intercom. Several monitors in the vicinity were turned on. n\"This is SBC, Planet Spaceball's best and only TV network,\"nsaid an announcer over an off-key chime arrangement done against thenSBC space turkey and its discolored tail feathers. \"COME HOME TOnS-B-C!\" announced the network chorus. The monitors cut to shotsninside the studio, where multi-colored strobe lights were flashingnwildly all around. \"Live from Spaceball City, it's everyone'snfavorite show, Execution Tonight!\" boomed the studio announcernover wild cheering from the audience, \"Tonight, we bring younJudgment Day for two liberals, who face the hydra monster pit. nPlanet Spaceball's top thief gets locked in an airless safe andnslowly suffocates. And a bunch of Melmacian hoarders trying to stopnour efforts to keep your air plentiful and fresh face the worst deathnof all, the atom chamber! Special music guests include your personalnfavorite, Jichael Maxson!\" \"Jichael Maxson?\"nKate raised her eyebrows, puzzled, \"You don't think they couldnmean…?\" \"Kate, the way theynthink on this planet, it probably is,\" Willie said, \"But if henmakes a move for Lynn, I'll wring his neck.\" \"Well it would benworse if Brian were here,\" Kate said, nodding slowly, \"Henprobably be all over…\" The look of discomfortnon her husband's face made her stop. \"And now, here's the hostnof Execution Tonight, Spike Tougher!\" the announcer bellowed. nTougher, a clean-cut Spaceball in a pure white suit, rose magicallynout of the floor. \"Good evening Planet Spaceball!\" he called outnto the wildly cheering audience, \"We're so glad you could join usntonight. We'd especially like to thank President Skroob and hisnstaff for stopping by for this evening's show.\" Inside theirnbombproof, bulletproof, waterproof, electric proof, soundproof, andnjust-about-everything-else-you-could-name-proof booth, Skroob rose tonhis feet and bowed gracelessly to the audience. \"Ah, my public,nhow they love me,\" he said to no one in particular. \"Yeah, but not asnmuch as he loves himself,\" Helmet grumbled to Sandurz. \"Shhhhh!\" GeneralnMills whispered to them. The half-alien, half-droid pushed up thenvolume on his personal monitor to almost full level. \"And now, AREnYOU READY?\" Tougher announced to the audience. \"YEAH!\" theynyelled back. \"Well then, onnbehalf of President Skroob and his staff, ladies and gentlemen, boysnand girls of all ages……..LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLET'SnGET READY TO KILL SOME PEOPLE!\" Tougher shouted, eliciting anhuge cheer. \"Now we'll turn the proceedings over to my associatenLotto, who'll bring out our first special guests of the night;nLotto?\" Lotto, a large rednhumanoid cockroach, buzzed out into sight. \"Well Spike,\" he saidnin a German accent, \"Our first guests is Oliver East, disgracednguard, who let Druidian freighters pass right under our radar beamsnand almost attack this beautiful planet of ours. You know what thatnmeans, folks? We're going to put him on the…\" \"WHEEL…OF…MISFORTUNE!nthe audience shouted out. Several droids wheeled out a largenvertical wheel. At the front of the prisoner line, several morendroids dragged a kicking and screaming East into the studio andnstrapped him to the wheel. \"That's right, it's time to spinnthe Wheel of Misfortune,\" Tougher announced, taking hold, of onenend of the wheel, \"Lotto and I'll give it a whirl to decidenOliver's fate. Whatever happens, parents, let your kids see it. nIt'll make them real Spaceballs. Ready Lotto?\" \"I'm always ready,nSpike,\" Lotto said, taking the other end of the wheel. \"Then HERE WE GO!\"nTougher and Lotto gave the wheel a strong spin. After about fivenrevolutions, it came to a stop on Flaming Death. \"Well Oliver,nlooks like you've got a date with the lava pit,\" Tougher toldnEast, pulling a level. A trapdoor underneath the wheel opened, andnEast was dumped into a fiery pit below. Flames rose high as he wasnscalded to death. In the hallway, the Tanners grimaced at the viewsnbeing shown from the cameras inside the pit. \"Yes, I was right,\"nWillie groaned, \"These people are definitely the most repugnant innthe universe.\" \"I'd like tonannounce that I'll never watch Fear Factor again when your backsnare turned,\" an equally turned off Lynn told him and her mother. \"Wait, you've beennwatching that?\" Kate raised her eyebrows at her daughter. \"How about that lavanpit, folks?\" Tougher asked the cheering crowd, \"Well, there'snmore people to get rid of tonight, so let's bring out our nextncontestant…\" \"So he said, 'Inknow what the punch line is, rectum damn near killed him,'\" thenguard near the entrance of the Spaceball entertainment complex saidnto his partner, \"But I told him no, that's not it at all. nIt's…wait, give me a minute, I…\" Just then the doorbellnrang. \"Pizza Saucer, special delivery!\" rang out an unfamiliarnvoice. Both guards jumped and drew their rifles. \"Identifynyourself!\" the second one shouted. \"I just did,\" thenperson outside said. \"Oh,\" the guardnsaid sheepishly, \"But we didn't order a pizza.\" \"It's free and onnus,\" the deliverer said. Their mouths watering, the guardsnfoolishly opened the door. \"Here's your pie, sir,\" Alf said,nthrowing the pizza into the nearest guard's face. \"And here'snyours,\" Barf hit the other in the face with a second one. Bothnguards staggered backwards. \"Anchovies!\" the first one groaned,n\"I hate anchovies!\" \"Tripley, if younplease,\" Alf stepped aside as Lone Starr's ex-lover stompednforwarding her Indestructo Suit. Setting an internal dial to taster,nshe shocked both guards into silence. Lone Starr then stepped up andnconked them out with a lead pipe. \"Good work all,\" he toldneveryone, \"Now we've got to find out where they tape ExecutionnTonight.\" \"Let's see,\" Alfnconsulted a map on the nearby wall, \"We're here, near It's anSmall War, um…it looks like it's about two studios down and threenstudios over. I think we should pose as door to door salesman thisntime, pretend we're selling doorknobs.\" \"Or better yet,nlet's just knock out the guards and storm the place firing awaynwith everything we've got?\" Tripley suggested. \"That'll workntoo,\" Alf shrugged. \"What do I do?\"nBrian asked, siding up alongside his friend. \"Stay close to thenold Alfer,\" the Melmacian told him, \"And take comfort in the factnthat I'll probably take a laser blast for you.\" \"Thanks,\" thisndidn't really comfort Brian. \"Someone'sncoming,\" Barf pointed up the hall where an advancing patrol wasnheard stomping. With no other open options, everyone froze innridiculous poses. Somehow this ludicrous plot worked; the guardsnwalked right by the obvious intruders without noticing them in thenleast. \"That was close,\" the mawg commented once they were past. \"Well, we haven'tngot a moment to lose,\" Lone Starr said, glancing at a watch on hisnwrist that wasn't there, \"Let's get cracking.\" The five of themnstrode up the hall until they came upon another guard stationed nearnthe audience entrance at a checkpoint with a sign labeled NOnUNAUTHORIZED OR AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL PERMITTED BEYOND THIS POINT. nLone Starr waved for the others to wait where they were, then creptnup behind the guard and walloped him on the head with the lead pipe. nThis didn't have the effect he'd hoped for, though; the guard,ninstead of falling unconscious to the ground, clutched his head andnhowled in pain. Stunned, Lone Starr looked around and saw a glassnsoda bottle on the ground. He picked it up and hit the guard withnthat. \"OW! OO! OUCH!\" the guard continued to yell, \"Younbroke my skull! You broke my skull! You broke…!\" Lone Starr spun himnaround and slugged him in the face, but this also failed to knock himnout. \"My jaw! You broke my jaw!\" he screeched loud enough tonwake the dead on every planet without ten parsecs. \"Uh, a little helpnplease?\" Lone Starr appealed to his comrades. Barf stepped forwardnand delivered a one-two combination to the guard's chest. \"Mynkidneys! You smashed my kidneys!\" the guard screamed onward. \"Let me,\" Briannran forward and punched the guard in his reproductive organ. \"MYnBALLS! YOU HIT…!\" the guard finally keeled unconscious to thenfloor-but not before hitting the alarm on the wall. Sirens wailednthroughout the complex. \"Well, we've pretty much run out ofnoptions,\" Lone Starr said, pulling Brian close, \"We've got tonuse the ducts.\" \"Sure, but explainnto me why they always use ducts in these types of stories,\" Alfnsaid as they ran for the nearest vent. \"Once this is over,nI want to head back to Exodosus and get the rest of the T.A.R.G.E.T.snwe've got armed and ready to go,\" Helmet said, checking hisnwatch, \"We're behind schedule as it is.\" \"What's the matternHelmet, not having fun?\" Belz asked him almost derivatively. \"Of course I'mnhaving fun!\" Helmet retorted, \"I loved Clock Game a few minutesnago, even though Tougher and Lotto had to stall so the bomb's clocknwould reach zero and blow that Termathian up. This is why we watchnExecution Tonight.\" \"And for the SolidnPlatinum Dancers, \"Cuckoo pointed to the attractive Spaceball womenndancing along with Jichael Maxson as he crooned away about how bignand nasty the Spaceball race was, along with high pitched andnpointless squeaks. \"Well, it looks likenwe're at the end, so we'll…\" it was then that Skroob noticednthe alarm buzzers ringing next to his armchair. \"Oh boy, what'snthis now?\" he frowned. \"And now, the momentnyou've all been waiting for,\" Tougher announced to the crowd downnin the studio, \"It's time to bring out the atom chamber!\" The crowd burst intonhuge cheers. The guards outside the studio forced the Tanners intonthe studio, where a droid took hold of each of them. \"Mr. WilliamnTanner and family, you have the good fortune to now take your seat innthe atom chamber,\" Tougher said, pointing to a large glassnrectangular chamber at the far end of the studio, \"Once we pressnthe button, the laser there will activate the hidden nuclearnproperties in the chamber, and the resulting fission reaction willndisintegrate you in seconds. Quick and painful, yet fun to watch. nAny last words?\" \"Uh, yes, I'd likento say some last words,\" a weak Willie strolled over to the host'snpodium, \"I'd like to say that, even though you're about tonmurder us in cold blood for crimes we didn't commit, we're goingnto go strongly and without qualms. We are after all men and notnmice. Our hearts are strong, and we won't feel…I mean to say,nyou may take our lives, but you will never take our humanity. For wenwill live on in spirit even though our…\" At this point he provednunable to keep up the charade any more and collapsed into a sobbingnheap on the ground. \"Oh PLEASE don't kill us!\" he sobbed,ntugging on Tougher's pant collar, \"I don't want to die! I'mntoo young to die! I'm too ME to die!\" \"On your feet,ninferior species,\" a droid hauled him to his feet and dragged himninto the atom chamber. \"Very nice Willie,\" Kate derided hernhusband as they were locked into chairs inside, \"Short and utterlynpointless.\" \"You're welcome,\"nWillie told her. Seeing their prisoners were now firmly restrained,nthe droids shut the chamber and locked it. A sinister-looking lasernwas wheeled into place near an opening in the chamber. \"Everyonenready?\" Tougher asked the crowd. Without even waiting for thenenthusiastic response, he told the droid manning it, \"Let them havenit.\" The droid nodded and hit a button on the side. The lasernslowly roared to life. The Tanners gulped nervously and closed theirneyes, expecting the end… Just then a loud blastnerupted from the vents. In the smoke and confusion that followed,nLone Starr jumped out and aimed his Schwartz at the laser, causing itnto turn sideways just as it reached full power. A red beam shot outnand hit a droid, disintegrating it in a blast of colorful circles. nThe hero activated the Schwartz's long orange beam and set aboutnnailing every droid that came at him firing its laser. Barf jumpednin with laser fire from one of the rifles Yogurt had given him onndiscount, destroying the rest of the droids. Then the mawg turnednhis fire on the laser, blowing it up in a blast of sparks. \"Mynbeautiful laser!\" Tougher lamented, looking over the wreck of hisnmachine, \"This cost me two hundred grand I don't have!\" He reached into hisnpocket for a laser of his own. Lone Starr reached him first and heldnthe Schwartz to his head. \"Don't even think about it,\" he toldnthe host, \"Your show's been cancelled.\" \"You talking to me?\"nAlf asked over his shoulder. 'No!\" Lone Starrnshouted. \"Go let your friends out.\" \"Well folks, itnlooks like we'll have to end the show early tonight, so this isnSpike Tougher saying, 'HELLLLLLLLLLLLPPPPPP!'\" the hostnshouted at the camera. Once the red tally light went out, he dovencowardly down through the hole in the floor he'd entered in. Therenwas a low thump below, followed by Tougher moaning, \"OUCH!\" In the meantime, Alfnran over to the atom chamber and blasted off the lock with thensmallest gun he had. This gun had a tremendous recoil, sending himnflying halfway back across the room. Shaking himself off, he thrustnopen the door and hit the main switch to unlock his adopted familynfrom their seats. \"Alf, how did you find us?\" Lynn asked himnexcitedly. \"Oh, I have mynmethods,\" Alf said flexing his muscles coolly, \"I believe somenthanks are in order, Willie?\" he gave the paternal figure a raisedneyebrow. \"Maybe later Alf,nonce we get out of here,\" Willie said dismissively, pushing pastnhim, \"This doesn't let you off the hook for what you've donento…what the hell are you?\" He stared up at Barf,nwho was about two feet taller than he was. \"What's the matternwith you?\" Barf asked him, \"Haven't you ever seen a mawgnbefore?\" \"No,\" Kate wasnequally amazed to see Barf, \"And quiet frankly I don't think I'dnever want you on my couch.\" \"Well at any rate,nwe'd better get you people out of here,\" Lone Starr ran up andnshook everyone's hand, \"Captain Lone Starr, hero for hire. Wenneed…\" Just then there was anloud crashing. Dozens more guards swarmed in through the door thatnno one was ever supposed to come through. In the presidential box,nHelmet grinned widely behind his visor. \"So Lone Starr,\" he saidnin his sinister voice, \"You thought you could come around behindnour backs. Well now I have both you and Shumway in my clutches!\" \"Well,\" anfluttering Lotto sneered as the guards surrounded everyone, \"Inguess my show's still going strong now.\" \"Yeah, well mynNielsen board begs to differ,\" Lone Starr retorted. \"Go to heck, LonenStarr!\" Lotto snapped. \"Go to heck?\" thenhero frowned. \"You can't saynhell on Spaceball television,\" Lotto explained. \"Oh,\" Lone Starrnshrugged. \"Get thatnMelmacian,\" Lotto ordered the guards. Thinking quickly, Alfngrabbed Barf's laser rifled and held it to his own head. \"Onenmore step and the Melmacian gets it!\" he warned the guards in anrough voice. They all stopped short of him. \"What's he doing?\"none guard asked a colleague. \"I have no idea,\"nthe other said. \"Over this way,nmove!\" Alf forced himself toward the air vent as if he was beingnmade to do so by another person. \"Please, don't let him takenme!\" he cried in a desperate voice. \"Shut up, Gordon!\" he toldnhimself in the rough voice. \"Has Alf flipped hisnlid?\" Kate asked out loud. \"No, he's got justnthe right idea,\" Barf whispered in her ear, \"It's something Inwould have thought of. Let's follow him.\" \"Isn't someonengoing to help him?\" another guard abruptly asked, watching Alf withnworry. \"Shh!\" stillnanother hissed, \"That's the surest way to get him killed.\" Despite the absolutenridiculousness of the situation, the guards stood absolutely stillnand watched in horror as Alf led himself as hostage toward the ventnand up into it. \"You morons!\" Lotto growled at them. The bigncockroach fluttered toward them, taser in hand. Lone Starr bentndown, picked up a giant flyswatter that just happened to be lyingnnearby, and whacked Lotto with it. \"A finis!\" Lotto moaned asnhe spiraled to the ground. This brought the guards to their senses. n\"Let's get them!\" one yelled, and they charged toward themnescapees. \"Close your eyes, \"Lone Starr told the others. Thennhe pointed his Schwartz toward the lights and made them increase innluminosity. The guards cried in pain and covered their own eyes. nLone Starr nodded in approval and climbed in after the others. \"Alf, Tripley'snstuck in the vent,\" Brian called to his friend as they approachednhim. \"Oh Brian, you'renall right!\" Kate hugged him tight. Then her expression abruptlynchanged. You brought him here?\" she demanded to Alf, \"You'renendangering his life in the process of saving us?\" \"Well Kate, it wasnthis or the Ochmoneks, and I think we know which option is morendangerous in the long run, \"Alf told her, \"Now if you're intentnon heading back to L.A., help us get Tripley undone. Helmet'll benon the warpath soon.\" Indeed, Helmet was nownpounding on the airtight door to the presidential booth. \"Opennthis up now!\" he screamed to the attendants on the other side ofnthe door. \"We're going asnfast as we can, Lord Helmet,\" the head attendant told him, \"Butnwith eight doors it's a little time-consuming.\" \"I want Lone Starr!\"nHelmet shrieked, \"And Shumway! And they're getting away!\" \"Not on my watch,nHelmet,\" Skroob activated his personal pager. \"Attention allnguards and droids,\" he announced, \"Lone Starr and Gordon Shumwaynare loose on the planet. Seize them and hold them.\" \"Mr. President, arenwe sure we want to commit the droids?\" Sandurz asked, pushing onnthe innermost door with Helmet, \"They've just come off thenassembly lines; they might not be combat ready yet.\" \"Trust me Sandurz,nthey're ready,\" Skroob reassured him. \"You hear that boys?\"nhe told his men, \"Go get 'em, on the double!\"[Chapter 12] \"Explain to me why we have to go crawling through the air vents of this God-forsaken place,\" Willie grumbled as they all did just that. \"I asked that same question just before we saved you,\" Alf told him, \"No matter what the context, every one of these space stories ends up with someone crawling through vents for one point of another.\" \"Plus,\" Lone Starr admitted, \"I forgot where I parked, so we'll have to hope we come out the right place.\" \"I think this corridor looks familiar,\" Barf pointed to the nearest exit duct. \"Might as well,\" his boss shrugged, \"Worst thing that can happen is they're waiting for us and we get killed.\" \"That's lovely,\" Willie groaned. Lone Starr kicked the grate open and they all slid down to the ground—except for Tripley, who had a solid chuck of the wall from the last vent enclosed around her midsection. \"Hey, anyone want to give me a hand?\" she demanded. \"Right, don't move,\" Lone Starr aimed his Schwartz and blasted it all off. Tripley jumped to the ground—just as a droid popped out from around the corner. \"Freeze, all of you, don't move!\" it ordered, gesturing with a laser rifle. Everyone's hands immediately went up. The droid took the safety off its rifle and took aim… ...right before its arms fell right off. \"Ho ho!\" Barf chuckled, \"Not so big and threatening now, are you?\" He advanced towards the droid. \"Wait, uh, you wouldn't hurt an unarmed droid, would you?\" it asked, looking down at its empty arm sockets. \"Let me think,\" Barf thought for a moment, then punched the droid's head right off. \"I was wrong,\" the droid buzzed as its head rolled around on the ground. \"Hey,\" Lone Starr announced, looking at the nearest door up the hall, \"It looks like we're near central control here. What do you say we give the other people Helmet's holding here against their will an early parole hearing?\" \"Works for me, Cap,\" Alf strolled up to the door and knocked on it. \"Room service,\" he announced. The door slid open. \"What the hell room…!?\" a guard inside asked, sticking his head out. Within seconds, Tripley had blasted him and every other guard in the control room with a withering laser fire. \"You're seriously demented, you know that?\" Kate asked Tripley with raised eyebrows as Lone Starr's former flame stepped over the bodies into the control room. \"Thank you,\" Tripley told her in return. She looked over the controls. \"There's got to be a master release button somewhere around here,\" she mused. \"It's right here, Trip,\" Alf pointed to a large red button marked IN CASE OF BOREDOM, PRESS THIS TO RELEASE ALL PRISONERS AT ONCE. The Melmacian hit it as hard as he could. Alarms sounded all over the prison complex. \"That'll give the guards a bit of a hobby,\" he chuckled. \"We were housed next to Skip and Rhonda,\" Alf,\" Lynn told him, \"They're probably out there somewhere.\" \"Really?\" Alf's expression perked up at the mention of the two people he was closest to on Melmac, \"What prison ball?\" \"DUCK!\" Lone Starr shouted before Lynn could answer. A whole company of droids was pouring up the corridor, firing indiscriminately. The hero drew a rifle he'd taken off a fallen droid in the studio and returned fire. \"Out the window!\" he told everyone else, \"I'll hold them off!\" \"Right,\" Tripley blew out the glass and fired a rope across to the other side. \"Everyone grab on,\" she told the rest of the party. They slid down into the middle of a market of some kind. They looked up as a massive explosion rocked the control room. Lone Starr jumped out the window to the ground just seconds before the flames would have engulfed him. \"Got them all,\" he said triumphantly. \"And I got just what I wanted,\" Alf said, looking at one store with a sign reading PANCAKE TOSSERS 'R' US above the door, \"Excuse me, I've got to get set up in case they come.\" \"Helmet, what's going on!?\" Skroob asked his associate, noticing the alarms on his monitor in the booth. \"Cuckoo, what's going on!?\" Helmet asked his apprentice. \"Mills, what's going on!?\" Cuckoo asked the alien-droid general. \"Sandurz, what's going on!?\" Mills asked his human counterpart. \"It's the prison complex,\" Sandurz said, checking his own screen, \"Every security function's been turned off. The prisoners are all escaping.\" \"What!?\" Skroob gasped, \"We've got to get them locked up again, stat; they'll kill every Spaceball they find if we don't, and that'll send my approval ratings down the toilet!\" \"It's Lone Starr,\" Helmet muttered out loud, \"He's trying to mess with me even further. Well not this time.\" The final door to the outside was finally reopened. Helmet pulled down his visor. \"You there,\" he called to several guards outside, \"Follow me. We have a Melmacian to shred. And a hero, too.\" They all rushed up the hall. \"You there,\" Helmet called to a person standing near a power coupling, \"Which way'd they go?\" The person turned around. It was the translator mime. It made numerous hand gestures. \"Come on, talk to me!\" Helmet demanded, grabbing the mime by the collar, \"Tell me where they are!\" The mime shrugged and pretended it was going along a wall. \"You're not going to talk!?\" Helmet thundered. He shoved the mime toward the guards. \"Sergeant, take him outside and shoot him!\" he ordered the commander, \"And when you shoot him, make sure you use a silencer. In the meantime, we've got people to catch.\" \"Alf, I don't think this is going to work,\" Kate told her houseguest as he set up his recently purchased pancake tosser. \"Kate, in the words of the immortal Sledge Hammer, trust me, I know what I'm doing,\" Alf told her, inserting the first of several instant pancakes into the catapult. \"Well, we'll find out how much you know in a minute, because here they come,\" Willie pointed up the hall. The first wave of Spaceball storm troopers was charging toward them, firing like crazy. \"Here's your just desserts,\" Alf yelled at them, firing the first salvo right at them. \"Next batch,\" he told Brian, who handed him several more from his Very Easy Bake Oven that Alf had received free of charge for buying the pancake tosser. Lone Starr threw several laser blasts in with the pancakes for good measure. \"Here, take this and cover our rear,\" he said, tossing a spare rifle to Kate. Kate, unused to weapons of any kind, shrieked and dropped it to the ground where it went off—shattering a pair of droids that had been sneaking up behind them. \"Good shot,\" Lone Starr congratulated her. \"Huh?\" Kate was puzzled until she looked around and saw the wrecked droids. But more were swarming toward them. \"Now what!?\" she demanded. \"I've got an idea,\" Barf declared. The mawg ran over to the wall, smashed open a glass case conveniently nearby labeled IN CASE OF DROID ATTACK BREAK GLASS, pulled out the super sized magnet inside, and aimed it at the droids. Within seconds, they'd all been attracted to it, lasers and all. Somehow managing to hold them upright, Barf strolled over to the nearest garbage disposal chute and dumped them all down it. \"That's that,\" he said, slapping his hands confidently. \"Yeah, but this isn't that,\" his boss said, increasing his firing, \"We're about to get overrun here!\" And indeed, the guards were getting close to where they were standing... \"Let me,\" Tripley stepped forward and spread out a huge plume of flames along the floor, forcing the Spaceballs to retreat somewhat. \"Good work,\" her former lover patted her on the back, \"Let's see if we can find an exit over that way,\" he pointed to the rear of the market. \"It looks like a hangar of some sorts,\" Willie said, eyeing the numerous ships parked inside. \"And there's Spaceball Two,\" Barf pointed at the vessel, which stretched for miles into the rear of the hangar, \"Whatdya say, boss, why don't we take away their main weapon?\" \"Works for me,\" Lone Starr fired several more blasts at the approaching troopers, \"But we're not leaving without the Winnebago.\" \"You always did have an almost psychic connection with that Winnebago,\" Tripley rolled her eyes. There was an increase of laser blasts as the guards charged ever closer. Lone Starr emptied the remaining clip of laser blasts from his rifle at them, then tossed yet another one at Kate again. \"Keep them at bay while we get this baby fired up,\" he told her, running for Spaceball 2. \"Are you crazy!?\" Kate told him, holding the rifle at arm's length with a repulsed look, \"I'm not about to start shooting this thing!\" But then history eerily repeated itself. One of the troopers fired off a blast that singed Kate's hair slightly. She clutched the burned area. \"Why you dirty…!\" she muttered, and before anyone—herself included—knew what happened, she'd started firing away wildly, mowing down every Spaceball in sight. By the time she ran out of ammunition, about seventy troopers lay dead. Everyone surveyed the damage with mouths hanging open. \"Oh my...uh...I honestly don't know what happened,\" Kate said out loud, aghast, tossing the rifle to the floor in a flash, \"I just…!\" \"Uh, well...um, good, good shooting, honey,\" a wide-eyed Willie managed to commend her, \"Just, just next time, um, not in front of the kids if you could...\" \"There's more people coming,\" Barf pointed out a loud clamoring coming up the hall. This time, however, it turned out to be the freed prisoners. They swarmed toward Spaceball 2, screaming things in all sorts of languages. \"Sure, sure you can come,\" Lone Starr called to them, \"If we're going to stop Helmet from blowing up Druidia, we're going to probably need reinforcements. All aboard,\" he waved for the hundreds of prisoners to head in the myriad of doors along the length of the ship. Barf, in the meantime, picked the lock to the door to the bridge with his Galactican Express credit card. \"Ah, the heart of the enemy's operations,\" he said, pushing the door open. \"Good, but how do we get this thing going?\" Tripley asked, staring around the interior of the bridge, \"I don't think anyone in the engine room speaks English.\" \"No problem Trip, I know how to handle it,\" Alf strolled over to the command rail and popped open a compartment. Several controls were inside, along with the label MANUAL SHIP CONTROLS—NEVER USE. \"Hang on tight, we're on our way out of here,\" he said, hitting the Start button and giving the engines unnecessary revs. Meanwhile, below, Helmet and his associates ran into the hangar just as Spaceball 2's engines roared to life. \"They're stealing Spaceball 2!\" Sandurz gasped the obvious. \"Gee, do you really think so?\" Helmet said sarcastically. \"Stop them!\" he yelled at his troops, \"Don't let them take off!\" The troopers opened fire at their own ship with everything they had. Inside the bridge, everyone ducked down as excessive sparks exploded from everywhere. \"\"Take her out quick!\" Lone Starr ordered Alf, \"We're getting hammered here.\" \"If they board, I can hold them off with these,\" Brian pulled out a Spaceballs the Grenade. His mother snatched it off him. \"Where'd you get this!?\" she demanded. \"Yogurt gave them to us at discount before we came and saved you,\" Brian explained, \"It's a children's toy.\" \"Well if I see this Yogurt character, I'm going to tell him a thing or two about giving children weapons,\" Kate hurled the grenade out the window, apparently not noticing the loud explosion and agonized yells of Spaceball troopers outside. \"I swear,\" she confided in her husband as the ship lurched out of its hangar, hitting the wall hard as it went, \"The people in this galaxy are so enslaved to violence.\" \"Well, conflict is the nature of existence, Kate,\" Willie admitted, \"And besides, nothing surprises me anymore with this place.\" \"There's the Winnebago,\" Lone Starr pointed to his vehicle in its parking space below, \"Barf, turn on that tractor beam.\" \"Turning on the tractor beam,\" Barf hit the switch. A blue beam shot out the front of the ship, pulling the Winnebago into the cargo hold. Fire from the various anti-spaceship guns around the perimeter of Spaceball City raked their sides. \"We've got no choice,\" Alf announced out loud, \"We've got to go right to…ludicrous speed.\" The dramatic suspense music from above sounded again. \"Gordon, be serious,\" Barf protested, \"This probably can't take ludicrous speed. And the viewers want action, not us running away with our tails between our legs—no offense to me.\" \"Sorry Barfo, there's no other way out,\" Alf said melodramatically. He turned on the ship's intercom. \"Everyone fasten your seatbelts, things are going to get ludicrous,\" he announced to the response of numerous loud gasps. \"Things are already ludicrous, Alf,\" Willie told his houseguest, \"They can't get much more ludicrous than they are now.\" \"Better buckle up, Willie,\" Alf told him, fastening his own seatbelt, \"This jumps to ludicrous real quick.\" \"Alf, I think you'd better…\" Willie started to say. \"Just do what he says, Mr. Tanner,\" Lone Starr informed the earthling as he buckled himself up, \"Helmet made the same mistake with ludicrous speed last time.\" \"Explain to me what…\" Willie's latest question came too late, as Alf hit the red dial marked LUDICROUS SPEED: DO NOT TOUCH UNLESS YOU REALLY, REALLY, REALLY, REALLY, REALLY, REALLY, REALLY, REALLY, REALLY, REALLY MEAN IT! In a split second, Spaceball 2 was hurtling into the Plaid Zone at a speed to boggle the mind. Having not fastened his own seatbelt, Willie was hurled by the severe forces into the door to the bridge, where they soon pressed him into it so tightly that he was making an indentation in it. Back on the ground, the leaders of Planet Spaceball stared up into the sky at their prize vessel—or at least where it had once been. \"Gone, just like that,\" Skroob lamented, \"My ten billion spacebuck investment in the hands of a Druidian prince—sort of.\" \"Ah, no matter,\" Helmet shrugged it off,\" We all know where Lone Starr's going, so we'll just have to put Exodosus on high alert for Spaceball 2. Lone Starr can commit grand theft auto, but soon or later his little trip to Vice City'll cost him. Sandurz, get the beams ready. I'm going back to Exodosus and wait for my quarry to arrive.\"[Chapter 13] THIRTEEN \"Alf, stop this thing!\" Willie shrieked over the roar of the engines. He was now being pushed so far back into the control room door by the incredible G-forces that he was practically on the other side of it. \"I don't think we want to do that, Willie,\" Alf had to shout as loud as he could to answer back properly. \"Yes we do!\" his host yelled, \"I take back what I said earlier! You can stay with us as long as you want!\" \"Is that a guarantee?\" Alf raised an eyebrow. \"I swear on my uncle's grave!\" Willie told him, \"Now stop this confounded ship, I'm begging you! STOOOOOOOOOOOOPPPPPPPP!\" \"OK, but I don't think you want to know the results, as most of the readers probably do,\" Alf started to reach for the emergency brake lever, then turned back around and asked, \"You're absolutely sure you want me to…\" \"DO IIITTTTTTTTTT!\" Alf shrugged and pulled the lever. The entire ship lurched to a complete stop in half a millisecond. To be more precise, had a dime been floating in that part of space, Spaceball 2 would have stopped on it. Much as Helmet had once upon a time warp, Willie flew screaming across the control room, where he slammed hard into the windshield. \"Oh God Willie, are you all right?\" Kate asked, jumping to her feet and rushing to him. Stunned, Willie could only moan in pain as he slid to the floor. \"Boy that was fun!\" Brian announced out loud, \"Can we do that again?\" Before anyone could respond, there was the sound of a loud horn in front of them. Lone Starr grabbed the steering wheel and lurched Spaceball 2 to the right just before a space truck would have hit them head on. \"Great, of all the places to come out of ludicrous speed, it had to be the middle of the Ursa Minor Freeway!\" he groaned. Bumper to bumper space traffic honked their ways through the cosmos. \"Worse than that,\" Tripley looked out the rear view mirror, \"The Andromeda Highway Patrol's their usual efficient selves.\" A space CHiP was trailing behind them, his siren blazing. \"Might as well pull over,\" she told her ex-fiancé. \"I've got an idea,\" Alf reached under the command rail and picked up a spare helmet that just happened to be underneath. Putting it on, he strolled over to the port window and turned his back as the space cop knocked on the window. \"Good afternoon, officer, what seems to be the problem?\" he asked in a deliberately nerdy voice. \"Tell me, how fast do you think you were going, Mr…?\" the patrolman inquired gruffly. \"Helmet, Dark Helmet, and you can go to hell, cop,\" Alf said, winking at Lone Starr, who was too puzzled to wink back. \"Well Mr. Helmet, you were going a trillion miles an hour in a twenty-five thousand mile zone,\" the trooper told him, \"Even during a drag race on Ratwoclean, that's definitely speeding.\" \"And you definitely saw me?\" Alf asked him. \"Clear as night.\" \"Then I'm sure you noticed how slow everyone else around me was going,\" Alf pointed out, \"Why not ticket them for going too slow?\" \"OK Alf, enough with the horseplay,\" a revived Willie strolled over to him and lifted up the helmet, \"I think the smartest thing for you to do right now is to just pay the fine and…\" \"It's Gordon Shumway!\" the cop exclaimed. He drew his gun. \"I'm collecting that big reward. You're coming with me, Shumway.\" \"Very nice Willie,\" Alf told his friend, \"I almost had him convinced I was Helmet. Would have given that guy a huge speeding ticket.\" \"Out of the car, Shumway,\" the trooper gestured. Before he could make good on his threat, though, Barf ran up to the window, apparently foaming at the mouth. He barked viciously. \"That's right, we have a rabid mawg in here,\" Alf told the cop, \"And he won't hesitate to bite you if he gets mad enough.\" \"Wait a minute,\" the trooper stared at Barf's \"foam,\" \"This is whipped cream. What are you trying to pull here?\" Lone Starr hit the acceleration button and set the speed to Ridiculous. Soon the cop was back in the dust. In the process, they triggered numerous accidents along the interstellar expressway. After about five minutes, the hero turned off the engine. \"It'll take him about a month to catch up with us now,\" he said. \"Good, well, in that case, why don't you turn this thing around and take us back to earth?\" Willie asked him. \"No can do,\" Lone Starr entered several directional coordinates, \"I'm on a mission to save Planet Druidia. We're heading for Exodosus to stop Helmet's grandiose scheme of destruction.\" \"Why did I have the feeling you were going to say that?\" Willie groaned. There was a knocking on the control room door. \"Gordon, are you in there?\" came a sultry female voice. Alf licked his lips. \"Rhonda?\" Lynn asked him. \"Yep,\" a definitely pleased Alf said, \"Now if you'll excuse me, I have a little catching up to do with the brown rose of Melmac.\" \"Sir, we've got the first triangulation of their position,\" Sandurz ran into the beaming room.[Chapter 14] FOURTEEN \"Come over here, I'd think you'd want to see this,\" Alf called over to the Tanners from the window inside Spaceball 2's Olympic-size swimming pool. \"What is it?\" Willie asked as he and the others pulled themselves out of the pool they'd been so thoroughly enjoying. \"To your left out there is the Altair Heights exit,\" Alf pointed, \"Just to the right of that next to the blue planet is where Melmac used to be.\" There was an uneasy silence as his adopted family looked upon what had once been their houseguests' home planet. \"It must feel strange, Alf, \"Lynn commented, \"Coming home again to find home's not there.\" \"It is a but disturbing, yes,\" Alf admitted, \"To think how many of the people I knew were just minding their business when all of a sudden Melmac split into millions of little Melmacs, some of which are still circling within several parsecs. I never thought I'd be back this way again, that's for sure.\" \"Well Alf, at least you still have some survivors to talk to on this ship, I guess that's a positive,\" Kate surmised. \"And that's something we need to discuss,\" Alf said, \"Skip offered me that place on the new Melmac again. Seeing how everything I seem to do down on Earth backfires and gets you all mad, such as adding onto your house to protect myself for psychotic invaders, I might just take up that offer this time.\" \"No Alf, we don't want you to go!\" Brian threw his arms around his friend, \"We're happy with you, we won't get mad! Will we, Mom?\" Before Kate could answer to this,the door to the pool room swung open. \"Am I disturbing anything? \"Barf called in. \"No, things we just starting to get too serious, that's all, thank you,\" Alf called to him across the expansive room. \"Well you're all needed in the IMAX theater; Captain Lone Starr needs to make his big speech concerning his attack on Exodosus tomorrow,\" Barf said. \"Why does he need us?\" Willie asked, \"Neither I nor my family is getting involved in any more intergalactic grudge matches.\" \"He wants everyone there, including you,\" Barf explained. As he turned to leave, he couldn't resist saying, \"Nice bathing suit, Mrs. T.; one piece?\" Kate pulled her robe shut. \"Has no one in this galaxy a shred of decency?\" she shouted to no one in particular. \"Probably, but we wouldn't have time to find them,\" Alf dried himself off, \"Here, get dressed; we've got a meeting to go to.\" Meanwhile, Barf sauntered his way up into what had to be the biggest IMAX Theater EVER created—so big, in fact, that the other wall wasn't even visible from the door. Many of their makeshift crew were already seated and mulling among themselves in various languages. \"You OK there, boss?\" he asked his comrade. \"I just know we botched the end of the last chapter,\" Lone Starr was muttering under his breath, \"We could have made it a good an in-depth look at how torn I am between Vespa and Tripley, but we cut it off too soon.\" \"Don't worry about the last chapter, boss,\" Barf told him, \"It's over, it's in the past. Right now, let's just give the big speech and get to the big climax.\" \"Right,\" Lone Starr tapped on his podium to get everyone's attention. \"Can I have you're attention please?\" he asked them all, \"Now then, tomorrow evening, you will all be…\" he had little choice but to stop as Alf and his adopted family abruptly joined him on stage. \"Sorry, couldn't find a seat,\" the Melmacian said. Lone Starr glanced down the theater. There were still loads of open seats as far as he could see, but he saw no point in arguing. \"As I was saying,\" he went on, \"Tomorrow night we'll be taking part in the biggest offensive in this part of the universe since the Drone Wars ended. Our enemy is tough, but wee have something they don't: the burning desire for revenge for wrongs committed. I wish I could say that I could do everything in my power to bring you all back safely, but I'm afraid that in these types of stories, somebody always has to die, so to those of you without a character name, I can only say sorry, but that's just the way it's usually written.\" \"That's not exactly going to boost their morale,\" Willie whispered in Lone Starr's ear. \"Well I'm sorry, but this isn't some sitcom where the most complicated of problems can be neatly wrapped up in a half hour,\" Lone Starr whispered back. Turning back to his audience, he said, \"I know what you're all thinking, this is pure suicide to try and stop Helmet. Well, if we don't stop him now,then once he destroys Druidia, my adopted home sweet home, he'll probably come after your planets, and he won't stop until he's blown up all of them. I don't know about you, but that's a serious enough threat to make me want to go down there and personally fight them alongside you—which I am going to do, because that's what good guys do. And should we succeed in this quest, then tomorrow will forever be known as the day that we, the inhabitants of the Frankfurt Galaxy, rose up and told the Barcelona Dragon of oppression that we will not go quietly into the night! That we will not vanish without a fight! We're going to live on! We're going to survive! Tomorrow, we celebrate our Independence Day!\" His makeshift crew rose to their feet and gave him a standing ovation. \"Great speech, boss,\" Barf congratulated him, \"Very nicely put.\" \"Sure,\" a strangely befuddled Lone Starr said, \"So tell me then why I've got the strangest feeling that I said it before?\" \"Ah who cares, let's just get on with it?\" Barf shrugged. \"Works for me,\" Lone Starr said. \"Now,\" he went on, \"Here's the basic plan for our attack. Trip, if you please.\" Up in the projection room, Tripley turned on the projector—which immediately exploded for no particular reason at all. On stage, Lone Starr sighed. \"On second thought, let's break for a half hour and have lunch,\" he suggested, \"We'll lay it out on the blackboard later.\" A mass exodus toward the exits and the cafeteria answered his proposition. \"Sounds good,\" Alf hopped off the stage, \"Finally, I'll get to eat a cat in a good long while.\" \"Let's just hope they have earth food,\" Kate said in a tone that suggested she doubted they did. \"If they don't, I'll be happy to split the tail with all of you,\" Alf proposed. \"Forget the tail,\" Willie looked nauseated at this thought, \"Don't bring up the tail or we won't be able to eat anything at all.\" \"You sure you don't even want the whiskers?\" \"NO!\" \"Just asking, Willie.\" Skroob's taxi finally pulled up next to the control mountain on Exodosus. \"That'll be 3,788,223 spacebucks,\" the cabbie remarked.[Chapter 15] FIFTEEN \"Good evening,\"nthe metal-mouthed reporter told his camera, \"This is SpaceballnNightly News, Ron Brokejaw reporting. We're here live on Exodosusnfor live exclusive coverage of the destruction of Planet Druidia. nAny minute now President Skroob will give his great address to thendroid troops, and then the attack to wipe out Druidia will benlaunched. I see the president is now headed to the microphone, sonwe'll switch over to him now.\" Skroob tapped the mikenseveral times, and then looked out at the troops and droids below himnon the great plain before him on the planet. \"Well boys,\" henannounced, \"Now is the time we and the readers have all beennwaiting for. In a few minutes you'll be mounting up yournT.A.R.G.E.T.s and blowing Druidia off the map. All I have to say is,n'Do your best and remember, you're making Spaceballs everywherenproud.' Now go out there, and give them a literal piece of Hell,nboys!\" Loud cheers rose upnfrom the troops. \"All crews to your T.A.R.G.E.T.s,\" GeneralnMills ordered, taking his place at the microphone, \"We arenlaunching in three minutes.\" \"OK,\" Brokejawnlooked a little awkward, \"You've just heard President Skroob'snspeech—a little quicker than we expected, but still very moving. nWe'll see if we can get…oh, here's Colonel Sandurz; Colonel,ncould you explain to us how you're going to get all the air out ofnDruidia we need to end our rumored air shortage while simultaneouslynblowing up the planet?\" \"Well Ron, first ofnall I'd like to point out that all rumors of an air shortage onnPlanet Spaceball are completely false,\" Sandurz said, \"If therenwere, we'd certainly have told everyone about it, now wouldn'tnwe?\" \"I suppose you wouldnhave, Colonel,\" Brokejaw shrugged. \"At any rate, ournT.A.R.G.E.T.s have sucking capacity that will be activated afterndetonation; it's too complicated to explain,\" Sandurz went on,n\"If you'll turn the camera over that way, you'll be able to getnour preliminary procedures; Cuckoo, activate the code breakingnlaser.\" \"Yes, Colonel,\"nCuckoo through a switch. A large satellite dish, with the companynname INDIRECTV hastily blacked out on it, rose out the top of thencommand mountain. \"Activate the air shield code,\" Sandurzncontinued. Cuckoo entered 1-2-3-4-5 into the computer. The dishnbegan buzzing. In the distance, the air shield to Druidia slowlyncreaked open. Skroob walked over to the interplanetary intercom. n\"Gentlemen,\" he announced, \"and droids, start your engines.\" The T.A.R.G.E.T.snroared to life in the trench. Druidia was right in the middle of it,nperfectly lined up for destruction. \"Well Mr. President,\"nHelmet said, uncorking a bottle of Spaceballs the Champagne, \"Fornonce you've finally done it right. We're going to win this one,nand there's nothing Lone Starr can do to stop us.\" \"And better yet,\"nSkroob said, pouring himself a shot, \"Any explosions will takenplace far from here, away from us.\" Just then, thenTeleWall lit up. \"Universal Express,\" said a guy in a deliverynsuit, \"I've got a package here for a Mr. D. Helmet.\" \"I didn't ordernany package,\" Helmet told him. \"Well, it wasnordered overnight, specifically for you,\" the deliveryman said. Helmet rolled hisneyes. \"All right, all right, we're kind of busy right now, justndrop it down on the planet; we'll open it and sign for it later.\" \"As you wish,\" thendeliveryman said. Helmet and everyone else in the control room werenstunned to see a gigantic red Christmas present fall out of the skyn(with the protective shield already having been taken down to allownthe T.A.R.G.E.T.s to leave the planet) and land at the foot of thenmountain. Simultaneously, the monitors started acting crazy. \"Sir,\"ncame the voice of the head technician, \"We've lost the bleeps,nsweeps, and creeps again, and now we're losing the sleeps and weepsntoo.\" \"Huh?\" everyonenasked. \"Well you know,\"nthe technician said matter-of-factually, \"The sleeps: nrrrrrrrr-RRRRRRRRR, rrrrrrrrrrrrrRRRRRRRRRRRRRR, and….\" \"We don't need tonhear the description!\" Helmet snapped. \"Sir, the screens,\"nSandurz examined it closely, \"It's been—pickled.\" \"Pickled?\" Skroobnfrowned, \"What, are they out of jam?\" \"It looks like…\"nSandurz started to say, but just then a blast of color took over thenscreens, along with a familiar theme. In a flash, Alf jumped intonframe dressed like Prince. \"It's Friday night, \"he boomed intonhis microphone. \"Yes it's Fridaynnight,\" added a backup group of female Melmacians. \"And the mood isnright,\" Alf crooned on, \"We're gonna have some fun, show younhow it's done, TGIF.\" Lone Starr now jumpedninto view. \"Yes, it's 8 o'clock on Friday, and we've got anlittle surprise for you, Helmet,\" the hero said, \"My own littlenStraight Flush to beat out your Full House, even when Family Matters.n Jesus, why am I referencing them? Anyway, your little attack'sngoing to be panned by our critics, especially after we unleash yournown ship and fighters against you. Here's a little trivia for you:n what do you call people like you who stupidly let us deliver…?\" Horrible expressionsnswept all the bad guys' faces. Skroob grabbed the microphone. n\"Get that package outta here, quick!\" he screamed to no one innparticular. \"Too late, Skroob,\"nLone Starr chided him, \"You left the cage door unlocked, and thenpit bull's a-coming out. Now sit back, relax, and enjoy the battlenas we destroy your dreams and forces right here tonightnoooooonnnnnnnnnn…\" \"T-G-I-F!\" thenMelmacians all shouted. The next moment, the package exploded open,nand several dozen former Spaceball assault craft fired off a salvo atnthe command mountain. \"Get the shield back up!\" Sandurz shoutednto the nearest guard. \"Function negative,nsir!\" the guard said, flicking the switch until it broke off in hisnhands, \"They've wrecked the shield!\" \"Oh great!\" Skroobngroaned. He activated the intercom. \"Everybody who can walk, getnout here quick!\" he shouted to everybody on the planet, \"We'vengotta stop them!\" There was another loudnexplosion. \"Bad news, sir,\" a commander appeared on the TeleWallnamid much static, \"They've completely destroyed the Starbucks onnLevel 12.\" \"NNOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!\"nSkroob screamed, bending over backwards. On the planet'snsurface, Lone Starr coasted to the ground on a transport. \"Okaynguys,\" he announced to his troops, \"Our primary goal is to stopnthose T.A.R.G.E.T.s. Try and lure every Spaceball you see away fromnthe trench so we can hit them with everything we've got. In thenmeantime, let's try and knock out their communications so we cannisolate them.\" He activated his radio. \"You all ready to bombntheir brains out, Shumway?\" he asked back up to Spaceball 2.\" \"Ready and rearingnto go, Captain,\" Alf told him. \"All right, let'snwipe them out!\" Lone Starr said, raising his Schwartz high. Henleaped out and started blasting away at the troopers that had alreadynstarted firing at them. But then, out ofnnowhere, a line of cord shot around his wrists. \"Jingo all thenway!\" came the snowman bounty hunter's voice from above, wherenhe was rocketing on his jet pack. He proceeded to drag Lone Starrnover Exodosus's rough surface. Trying to ignore the pain the sharpnrocks were inflecting on his chest, Lone Starr looked ahead and sawnan erupting volcano ahead of him. Thinking quickly, he aimed hisnSchwartz at Belz's rocket pack and concentrated as hard as hencould. It proved to be enough; the rockets ceased firing, and Belznplummeted into the volcano. \"No!\" the snowman started screamingnas the hot lava somehow started melting his frozen armor, \"I'mnmelting, melting, melting! Oh, what a world! To think I'm only annafterthought in the story by now, to die like this…!\" \"Then just shut upnand die already!\" Lone Starr snapped, freeing his wrists from thenwire. \"Okay,\" Belznshrugged. Then he finished melting into a puddle. \"Boy, he reallynwas a snowman!\" Barf commented, having followed his boos looking tonhelp. \"Yeah, Lone Starrnsaid, dusting himself off, \"And a really abominable one at that.\" Laser fire hit theirnfeet, causing them to dive into a ditch. \"Forgot to mention,nthere's a big machine gun nest up there guarding the T.A.R.G.E.T.ntrench,\" the mawg said. Lone Starr looked up to see about a dozennSpaceballs firing at rebel troops from a large robin nest set up on anlarge rock outcropping. \"We'll have to take them out,\" thenhero realized, \"And luckily I've got an idea. It's silly, butnit'll work.\" And moments later, thenSpaceballs abruptly stopped their firing at the sight of what had tonbe the ugliest woman in the universe rising out of the ditch. Theyncouldn't have cared about \"her\" appearance at all, though. n\"Hoo boy, what a dame!\" one of them goggled at her, \"Come makena man, little lady!\" \"Hello boys,\" LonenStarr said in the most feminine voice he could come up with, \"Whyndon't you come up and see me some time?\" While the Spaceballsngoggled, Barf snuck up underneath them and yanked out a small twignfrom the nest. Immediately the whole nest gave way, dumping thenSpaceballs on the ground. \"Weapons on the ground, guys,\" Barfnsaid, pointing his own laser rifle at them, \"You've just flownnout of the coop—or something along those lines.\" \"Hang on tight, herenwe go,\" Alf said as he dived Spaceball 2 toward the T.A.R.G.E.T.ntrench at an almost suicidal rate, \"Is that really necessary?\"nWillie protested. \"No, but it soundsnso good when you right it,\" Alf told him, \"Ready to fire, Skip?\" \"Ready, Gordo,\"nhis old buddy from Melmac said, looking down the bombsight, \"We'rencoming up on the first one now.\" \"Let them have itnthen.\" \"Fire in and out ofnthe hole,\" Skip dropped the bombs. A loud blast of black smokensignaled the end of the first T.A.R.G.E.T. in line. \"Good shot,nguys,\" came Lone Starr's voice over the radio. \"Yeah, good shotnSkip,\" Brian slapped hands with the alien. \"Nothing we in thenOrbit Guard could never handle,\" Skip said, flexing his fingers. Loud blasts abruptlynrocked the control room. Spaceball fighters were on their tail andnfiring at will. \"Oh great!\" Kate groaned, \"As if this couldn'tnget any worse!\" Alf grabbed the forenlaser gun and started firing away with everything he had, albeit in anreckless and erratic fashion. \"Ha ha, take that to the bank andncash it!\" he shouted at the still-coming crafts. \"Well they'd bencashing it in all right, Alf, if you'd actually start aiming atnthem,\" Willie pointed out. \"Oh, well, I wasnjust trying to unnerve them before I actually shot at them,\" Alfnexplained. He clicked the gun again, only to find that he'd usednup all the ammunition. Missile hit the bridge repeatedly, causingneveryone to jump for safety. \"Listen you guys,\" he yelled upnthrough the now broken window, \"There's no need to take all yournrepressed anger out on us. If you're so determined to killnsomebody, let me give you Kate's mother's address.\" \"ALF!\" Katenglared at him. \"Well it was just annidea,\" Alf shrugged. He reached for the intercom. \"Hey Larry,nis there anything left in the magazines?\" he asked another friend. \"Uh, just some grapenshot, Gordon,\" Larry said. \"Bring it on up herenA.A.R.P.,\" Alf told him. \"And in the meantime,\" he added,npicking up a home video recorder from under the command rail, \"Ifnthe grape shot works the way I think it will, I want this on tape. nBob Saget'll love this.\" \"Well, you know hendoesn't host America's Funniest Home Videos anymore, do you Alf?\"nLynn asked him. \"True, but I'dnthink he'd still love it,\" Alf said. Larry burst inncarrying the grape shot. \"Load it in over there,\" Alf pointed tonthe fore gun. Larry locked it into place. Alf took careful aim atnthe approaching Spaceball squadron. \"Just be glad I don't haventhe peanut butter to go with this,\" he said, and with that fired. nThe grape shot hit the foremost attack craft, splattering grape jamnall over it. Blinded, the fighter spun sideways into anothernsquadron, knocking them over literally like tenpins. It thennplummeted toward the trench where it hit and blew up anothernT.A.R.G.E.T. \"Good form, good form,\" Alf applauded his victim'snexplosion. He checked the playback on his videotape. \"Perfect. Incan see Bob forking over the hundred grand right now,\" hencommented. \"This is terrible!\"nSandurz lamented, staring glumly at the hologram of the battle beforenthem in the command mountain, \"They've got us completely offnguard! And we're losing T.A.R.G.E.T.s fast!\" \"And plus we'renout of coffee!\" Skroob moaned. \"Will you drop thencoffee for one minute?\" General Mills glowered at him, \"I'mngoing down there and taking out this pointless resistance of theirsnsingle-handedly.\" \"I don't thinknthat's a good…\" Cuckoo started to say, but Mills was alreadynout the door. The clown shook his head. \"Well, it was nicenknowing him,\" he shrugged. Down below, manynparticipants on both sides were not surprisingly falling dead. Evennthough the Spaceballs were throwing every scientifically advancednweapon at them, the rebels were still surviving, even though much ofnthe battles had little real strategic purpose other than to looknimpressive to the average reader. Among the chaos, LonenStarr was now helping Barf assemble a radar dish of sorts. \"Let'snjust hope we've got the right frequency on this thing,\" the mawgnsaid, \"If only there was a way we could test it.\" \"Here's our test,\"nLone Starr stood upright and aimed the dish at a group of droidsncoming right at him saying monotonously, \"We must destroy all thengood guys. We must destroy all the good guys.\" The hero fired anblast at them. The droids shook from the scrambling, then abruptlyndropped their guns and started playing pattycake with each other, nowndroning, \"Dance your cares away, worries for another day, let thenmusic play, down at Fraggle Rock.\" \"Well, at least nownthey have a hobby,\" Barf said, \"I hope we've got…\" \"Watch it!\" LonenStarr pulled his buddy away just before something large and orangenlanded right near them. \"What was that?\" a shaken Barf asked. \"It came from thatnpillbox,\" Lone Starr pointed across the way to the large cardboardnstructure. The Spaceballs manning the pillbox fired an Advil out ofnit at them, and it just barely missed them. The two of them startednrunning for cover. \"I don't want to be around when they letnloose with the Viagra,\" Barf commented. From out of nowhere,nhowever, Tripley stepped forward in her Indestructo suit. Settingnthe arms to water dispensers, she fired away at the open slit in thenpillbox. Within minutes, white foam was pouring out of it. ThenSpaceballs poured out of the pillbox covering their faces. SeeingnTripley, they fired away at her. True to its name, however, thenIndestructo suit was impervious to the lasers. Calmly, Tripley setnher dials to pepper spray and fired back. A black cloud smotherednthe Spaceballs, who started sneezing violently from the pepper. Barfnran up and conked them out with a conveniently handy rock. \"Nicensave, Trip,\" he told his boss's ex. Tripley coolly blewnoff the tips of her arms. Just then General Mills jumped down intonsight, looking incredibly ticked off. The alien-droid activatednblades on his gauntlets and whipped them around impressively. \"I'venbeen waiting to meet you, Lone Starr,\" he told the hero, \"Andnbefore the day's over, I'm going to add your Schwartz to myntrophy collection. But before I kill you, I'll let you take yournbest shot, so go ahead, make my night.\" \"OK,\" Lone Starrntook aim with his Schwartz at Mills, but at the last minute jerkednhis arm upward at a rock perched near the edge of the overhang aboventhem. The giant boulder toppled off and crushed Mills before he hadntime to register. \"Well, he was pretty much hot air,\" Tripleyncommented. \"And now I know thenonly reason they put him and Jingo Belz in this story,\" Barf added,n\"so they could increase the body count.\" \"Let's get thesentrophies of his while he's still dead,\" Lone Starr startednpicking up the myriad weapons Mills had carried with him as trophiesnoff his belt. He froze and put his hands in the air, however, as anhover tank came roaring right at them. He needn't have bothered,nhowever, for the shots from the tank missed him and his fellow goodnguys by a mile, hitting and blowing up all but one of the remainingnT.A.R.G.E.T.s before the hover tank itself toppled over the edge ofnthe trench and needlessly blew up. Up in his command post, Helmetnslapped his head at the sight of just one good T.A.R.G.E.T. left. n\"This is unreal!\" he screamed out loud, \"Now we're takingnout our own ships! Who the hell was in charge of that tank?\" \"Let me check, sir,n\"Sandurz flipped through the computer, \"Uh, that was TechnicalnSergeant Randy B. Asshole, sir.\" \"Well, that explainsna lot, like why he missed Lone Starr when he was three inches innfront of him!\" Helmet muttered. \"And that's notnthe worst, Master,' Cuckoo pointed up into the sky, where Spaceballn2 was magically transforming into a giant… \"BASEBALLnPLAYER?\" Skroob was mystified, \"I didn't even knownSpaceball 2 had that setting!\" \"Apparently itndoes,\" Sandurz said. They all watched in surprise as Mega Sluggern(for lack of a better name) started swinging away and knocking thenSpaceball fighters all the way out of the Frankfurt Galaxy. \"Well,nthat's it, I'm going back to the service station,\" Cuckoo threwnup his hands in surrender. \"We're not donenyet!\" Helmet shouted. He grabbed the radio. \"Now hear this!\"nhe bellowed, \"You droids in that last T.A.R.G.E.T., go!\" Down below, Lone Starrnwatched in shock as the last T.A.R.G.E.T. accelerated down the trenchnright toward the helpless Druidia. \"Hey Shumway, stop clowningnaround up there!\" he yelled into his intercom, \"Do somethingnquick or Druidia's history!\" \"I can't,\" camenWillie's voice from the ship, \"We're out of ammunition andnfighters. And I have no clue where Alf is; he left about a minutenago.\" \"Oh great!\" LonenStarr kicked a boulder in frustration, \"Helmet got the drop on us! nIsn't there anyone left who can stop them?\" There was a cracklingnon the radio. \"Yep, I'm here and all ready to go!\" came Alf'snvoice over the airwaves. \"Alf!\" up in thenship, Willie ran to the window and looked out. \"Where are you!\"nhe asked frantically. \"I'm right upnagainst Druidia, and I'm about to let that incoming T.A.R.G.E.T.nhave its blaze of glory, right Brian?\" \"You bet, Alf,\"nadded the boy. His family abruptly looked backwards to where theirnson had been sitting just a few seconds ago, it seemed. \"Willie,nhow'd Brian get…?\" a deathly pale Kate asked her husband. \"I thought you werenwatching…?\" Willie ran to Mr. Radar and switched to Televiewnsetting. Just near Druidia's air shield was a familiar lookingnvehicle with a humungous bomb labeled THE BIG ONE strapped underneathnit. \"Shumway, how'd you get my Winnebago started?\" an iratenLone Starr demanded. \"Simple, Lone Starr,nyou left the keys in the ignition,\" Alf told him. The Melmaciannlooked through the periscope at the T.A.R.G.E.T. It was right onntrack. \"OK Brian, let 'em have it.\" he told his friend in thenco-pilot seat. \"Letting them havenit,\" Brian hit the firing button. Unfortunately, the bomb failednto dislodge from its mooring. \"Oh no, it's jammed, and it'snon!\" the boy exclaimed in fright. \"Alf, get out ofnthere, quick!\" Willie begged him, \"Or at least get Brian out ofnthere, for the love of God!\" Alf looked out thenwindow at the fast-approaching T.A.R.G.E.T., then down at the displaynnoting that the bomb had jammed. He took a very deep breath. n\"Listen Willie,\" he said slowly, \"I'd like to thank you andnKate for giving me a home all these years. I appreciate yournhospitality to a poor space traveler.\" \"What are younsaying?\" Willie was practically white from fear, as he realizednexactly what Alf had in mind, \"Alf, no, I beg you, don't, notnwith Brian on board, this isn't Independence Day…!\" \"Sorry Willie, butnthere's no time and no choice,\" Alf said, \"If it's anynconsolation, you can keep the parts you find.\" \"Alf, no!\" anhorrified Kate screamed, \"This isn't a movie! The two of youncan't survive if…!\" \"Yes, Kate,\" thenalien said, \"I'm not going to let another planet blow up on mynwatch.\" And with that, he turned off the radio. \"Switch tonhyperjets, we've got to hit them at full speed,\" he told Brian. nSeeing the fear in the boy's eyes, he said, \"Hey, at least we'rengoing out together.\" Brian forced a smile. n\"Switching to hyperjets,\" he said, activating the Winnebago'snsecret function. Alf revved the engine as the T.A.R.G.E.T. drewncloser, and then abruptly peeled off toward it at well over a billionnmiles an hour. \"Hello boys!\" he shouted at the droids running itnfor no particular reason other than to maintain the ID4 similarity,n\"I'm baaaaaaaaaacccckk!\" Seconds later, the Winnebagoncollided with the T.A.R.G.E.T. a mere million miles from the open airnshield. A blinding flash of white light filled the cosmos, and whennit subsided, falling fireballs were all that remained of the twonvessels.[Chapter 16] SIXTEEN For about thirty seconds, everyone on Exodosus stared in shock at the massive explosion that had rocked the cosmos. Then most of the people on the ground immediately picked up fighting where they'd left off as if nothing had happened. Up in Mega Slugger, however, it was a much more somber story. \"Oh Brian!\" a completely hysterical Kate sobbed at the flashes of debris still flying away from the explosion site, \"My poor baby! Why did it have to end like this?\" Her husband and daughter, barely able to control themselves either, could offer little comfort of their own. \"I just guess Alf had a mission, after what happened to Melmac,\" was all Lynn could suggest. \"At least we saved Druidia.\" Willie rose up, looking incredibly determined. \"And now I'm going to pay back this Helmet guy for this,\" he said in a rough tone, \"I'm going down there and I'm going to bring him down with my own two hands! You, Skip, get that beam ready!\" He strode toward the beaming device. \"Willie, please, you're not thinking rationally,\" his wife tries to console him, \"We're all upset we lost our son…and our alien, but that's no need to get reckless!\" \"Kate, my mind's made up,\" Willie said firmly, \"At least if I don't make it, I'll be with Brian again. Hit that thing, Skip.\" \"No Willie don't…!\" Kate's pleas went unanswered as Skip beamed Willie down to Exodosus's surface. \"He'll never last down there,\" she admitted to Lynn, \"We've got to go down and stop him before he hurts himself, or worse.\" On the ground, Lone Starr was also still staring blankly up toward Druidia. \"My Winnebago,\" he was moaning, \"My beautiful Winnebago. Why did Shumway have to sacrifice it?\" \"Why did he have to sacrifice himself too?\" Barf wondered. Then a bright look spread over the mawg's face. \"Wait a minute, boss, maybe it's in the script. We'll just see…\" he dug around through his pockets. \"I don't have my copy of the script,\" he realized. He ran off toward the nearest cluster of rebels asking, \"Hey, any of you guys got the script on you?\" \"Well,\" Lone Starr tightened his Schwartz around his finger, \"Now that we've saved the world, there's only one thing left to do: fight with Helmet face to face.\" \"Do you really have to?\" Tripley asked him. \"Sorry Trip, but everyone expects it,\" he ex told her, \"And I've got to do it alone, so if you can, hold off all their forces for me while I battle him.\" And with that,he strolled off toward the control mountain. In the control room, Skroob was practically at hysterics himself. \"My beautiful T.A.R.G.E.T.s!\" he lamented, \"So much money to build, and so cheaply destroyed!\"[Chapter 17] SEVENTEEN In the control room, Skroob and Sandurz stared around at thenmyriad of sirens going off. \"Now what's going on?\" thenpresident asked out loud, \"Don't tell me we're going to have tongo through another whole self-destruct scene.\" \"Thanknyou for imploding Exodosus's core,\" the computer announced overnthe loudspeakers, \"This planet will self-destruct in exactly fournminutes and thirty-three seconds.\" \"Inasked you not to tell me that!\" Skroob yelled up at the nearestnloudspeaker. \"Sorry,\"nthe computer said. Sandurznactivated the radio. \"Attention all personnel,\" he announced asnthe Spinners' main Spaceball theme starting blaring from overheadnas if by magic, \"Abandon planet, abandon planet. Everybody headnfor the escape rockets, everybody head for the escape rockets. Shutndown all the stores in the shopping center, shut down all the storesnin the shopping center. Evacuate the 3-D theater, evacuate the 3-Dntheater. Why am I repeating myself? Why am I repeating myself? Indon't know. I don't know. Oh what the hell? Oh what the hell? nI'm getting out of here. I'm getting out of here.\" Therenwas a mad dash as everyone in the control room ran madly for thenexits. The walls were starting to shake noticeably. \"I got firstndibs on the elevator,\" Skroob shouted, pushing his way through ansea of panicked technicians to get top it. He pried the doorsnopen—and then jumped back as a huge jet of lava burst up the shaft.n \"On second thought, I got first dibs on the stairs,\" he added. Downnbelow, Lone Starr led the rest of the good guys through the maze ofncorridors deep in Exodosus, all the while avoiding collapsingnceilings and walls. \"Everyone who's still up there, get off thenplanet while you still can!\" he was shouting over his radio, \"Don'tnworry about us; we'll be fine.\" \"AndnI suppose you have an airtight way to get us off this rock before itnblows even though you're asking all our aid to leave?\" Willieninquired, jumping upwards to avoid a stalagmite breaking through thenfloor. \"WellnI haven't that out yet, although I wouldn't have to if mynWinnebago hadn't been needlessly sacrificed in the battle,\" LonenStarr glared at Alf. \"HeynCap, look at the bright side, any and all damage incurred is easilyncovered by Safe Auto,\" Alf told him. \"IfnI didn't know…\" Lone Starr was cut off as a trio of Spaceballsnjumped in front of them. \"Freeze, you!\" one of them shouted. Barfndrew an imaginary knife. Growling, he made a stabbing motion at thentrooper. His \"victim\" groaned and sank to the floor, even thoughnhe hadn't even been touched. Barf stabbed at a second guard, whonfollowed suit. The last one, however, stood firm while Barfn\"stabbed\" away. \"Damn, outta ammo!\" the mawg lamented. \"I'mnnot,\" Alf pulled out an imaginary bazooka and fired at the lastnguard, who recoiled screaming into the wall and slumped down. \"Goodnthinking, Gordon,\" Barf patted Alf on the shoulder. \"Thanks,nat least somebody's willing to always thank me when I solve ancrisis,\" Alf blew fake smoke off the imagined barrel of his bazookanand gave Willie a look. Therenwas a barrage of laser blasts as more troopers came charging up thenhall. Barf, as the only one with a weapon, fired back at them. \"Ifnyou can solve this one, Gordon, we'd greatly appreciate it,\" thenmawg told the Melmacian. \"Andnlucky for you, Barf, the old Alfer's got one in mind,\" Alf said,npointing to a vending machine selling 7-Down soda, \"Who's gotnquarters?\" \"Um,nI've got about five of them,\" Lynn said, searching through hernpockets. \"I'vengot two,\" Brian held out his in his palm. \"Goodnenough,\" Alf took them all and inserted the first quarter into thenvending machine. \"Fire in the hole!\" he shouted, pressing thenbutton for a 7-Down and hitting the deck. A can of 7-Down shot ofnthe machine like a bullet and exploded near the troopers, causingnthem to scurry for cover. Alf dropped in more quarters and soon hadnthe Spaceballs on the run from his high-caffeine mortars. The finalncan, however, jammed in the slot. Noticing the lull, the twonSpaceballs who hadn't run away resumed firing. Alf tugged at thencan with no results. \"A little help please?\" he asked everyonenpresent. The others ran over and tried to yank the can out—exceptnfor Barf, who pulled the entire front off the vending machine. Aboutneight dozen cans of 7-Down rolled around on the floor. \"I'm notnthat thirsty,\" Alf told him. \"Let'snsee what we got here,\" Lone Starr picked up one can, shook it upngood, then popped the top and tossed it like a grenade. It landednnear the farthest trooper, who was too busy firing at the good guysnto notice the spraying can. His associate did, though, and wasngracious enough to smother it in time. It exploded underneath him,ncausing him to shout for a medic. Atnthis point, the roof started collapsing in the hall, promptingneveryone good and bad to start running—the \"wounded\" Spaceballntediously. \"This planet will self-destruct in exactly threenminutes,\" the computer reminded everyone. \"Wenknow, we know!\" Lone Starr shouted up at the ceiling, \"Do younhonestly think none of us are wearing watches?\" \"Wellnexcuse me, Mr. Pushy,\" the computer retorted. \"Itnreally doesn't make much logical sense,\" Willie confided in hisnwife as they turned right toward what was hopefully the surface, \"Thenfact that they can time this out, I mean. How can they possibly tellnyou the exact moment the planet's going to blow up? You justncan't.\" \"WellnWillie, nothing about these people is logical,\" Kate pointed out,n\"Why should the planet self-destructing be any different?\" \"Goodnpoint,\" Willie agreed. Upnin the escape rocket causeway, it was pure pandemonium. HystericalnSpaceballs rushed here and there in a desperate attempt to lock up annescape craft before the planet exploded. Many were carryingnvaluables from Spaceball stores on Exodosus that they'd heistednduring the breakdown in order. It was into this melee that Helmetnand Cuckoo came running. \"I don't see any openings, Master,\"nCuckoo confided in him. \"No,nbut I have mine on reserve for—hey you, get out of my rocket!\"nHelmet yelled at a person climbed into the helmet-shaped rocket he'dnspecifically set aside as his own. \"You?\" he gasped uponnseeing it was the mime, \"But I had you shot back on PlanetnSpaceball!\" Thenmime shook its head, eye-poked Helmet over his glasses, and ran intonthe rocket while doing the Curly Howard hat rattle. Before Helmetncould recover, he launched it. \"Get back here you silent slug!\"nHelmet yelled up the shaft after it. \"Inguess he sure told you, Master,\" Cuckoo shrugged. \"Justnshut up and find a craft for me!\" Helmet shouted, eye-poking Cuckoonin turn. Onnthe opposite side of the causeway, a panicked Skroob and Sandurznentered the area, along with dozens of other equally panickednSpaceballs. \"Well Sandurz, it's every Spaceball for himself,\"nthe president announced, \"If we don't see each other, it's beennsort of nice knowing you. And with that I see my ride.\" Henran for the nearest open rocket, but was beaten to it by an organngrinder. \"Outta there, bub!\" Skroob shouted at him, \"I gotndiplomatic immunity; that means I get first draw!\" \"Youngot diplomatic immunity, and my monkey's got a taser,\" the organngrinder told him. He nodded at his monkey, who pulled out the tasernin question and let Skroob have it. Skroob shot backwards across thenfloor, vibrating wildly from the shock. The monkey laughed andnpulled the launch lever. Sandurz,nmeanwhile, wasn't having much luck of his own. He ran for thenfirst craft he saw, only to find it occupied already by JichaelnMaxson. \"Come on, JM, give the nice colonel his escape rocket,\"nSandurz pleaded. \"SorrynColonel, but I've got to Beat It,\" Maxson told him, \"You canncall me a Smooth Criminal if you like, see the world in Black ornWhite, but remember, I Just Can't Stop Loving You.\" Henpulled the launch lever, but at that moment, Sandurz reached in andnpulled him out of the rocket before the door slid closed. The rocketntook off empty. \"Wait for me!\" Cuckoo yelled, barreling acrossnthe causeway. The clown grabbed onto the rocket's thrusters andnflew up the shaft out of sight with it. The back draft from thenexhaust ignited Maxson's hair. \"Oh no, not again!\" thensinger shrieked, and with that started running around pointlesslynwith the flames leaping high in the air. \"Thisnis your two minute warning,\" the computer announced to everyonenstill on the planet, \"This planet will self-destruct in exactly twonminutes.\" Atnthe far end of the causeway, Helmet spotted one of the few remainingnunlaunched rockets. The only problem was that a woman in a bluendress was already getting into it. \"Miss,\" Helmet said, runningntoward her, \"I'm willing to offer you ten million spacebucks fornthat rocket.\" \"Thenperson turned around. It was a large bearded man. \"Hello,nbuttercup,\" he said in a deep masculine voice, and with thatnkissed Helmet passionately on the lips. While Helmet sputtered innshock, he launched into the air after the dozens of other rocketsnheaded for the safety of space. \"Sir,nare you all right?\" Sandurz ran up to Helmet. \"Fine,nfine,\" Helmet said, wiping his face, \"I'll tell you one thing,nSandurz, he…she…whatever, kisses like Hedy Lamarr.\" \"That'snHedley!\" shouted the Blazing Saddles villain as he jumped into annopen escape rocket nearby that Helmet had failed to notice. BothnHelmet and Sandurz lunged for the craft, but Lamarr launched itnbefore they could reach it. \"Wouldn'tnyou just believe it?\" Skroob asked as he ran over, \"We're downnto just one pod again.\" \"Ohngreat,\" Sandurz groaned, \"I guess we'll have to draw straws fornit.\" \"Good,nyou two draw the straws, and I'll take the rocket,\" Skroob made anbeeline for it. \"Ohnno you don't!\" Helmet jumped on top of his boss before he couldnreach it. The two of them rolled around on the floor—until theynsaw Sandurz was getting into the last rocket. Both of them lunged atnthe colonel, causing all three of them to be stuck in the rocket'sndoorway. All six of their arms reached for the launch lever. nSandurz's left arm hit it first. As soon as the door startednlowering, the three of them realized they'd made a mistake. \"Backnout!\" Skroob yelled, but it was too late. The rocket lurched upnthe shaft, dragging the villains along with their rumps scrapingnagainst the shaft walls. Outside,nLone Starr and the others burst out onto the surface just as thenentire face of the mountain gave way, blocking the exit from theninside of the mountain. Earthquakes were rocking Exodosus as far asnthe eye could see, causing fissures to open on the surface atnnumerous locations and lava to spill out. \"Great, they're allngone,\" Barf groaned, scanning the empty skies for the now absentnMega Slugger, \"With friends like them, who needs enemies?\" \"Thisnplanet will self-destruct in exactly one minute,\" the computer saidnon the loudspeakers set up all over the outside of the planet, \"Lastncall for everyone who wants to make it to the next film.\" \"Whatna way to go,\" Willie moaned, pounding his head on a boulder, \"Inknew we should have called the Alien Task Force when they came…\" \"Waitna minute,\" Lone Starr held up his hand, \"I feel the presencenof…Yogurt.\" \"Where?\"nBarf looked around before noticing a bright light in the sky comingntoward Exodosus, \"Aha!\" the mawg exclaimed, \"I knew Yogurtnwould play an active part in the climax somehow!\" \"Butnhe'll never get low enough before the planet blows,\" Kate pointednout. \"Thennwe've got to go to him,\" Lone Starr announced, \"We've got tonget up to the top of that plateau there for him to pick us up.\" \"Wellnthat's good except for one very small detail,\" Willie told him,n\"That plateau is at least a hundred feet high; there's no way wencould get up to the top of it in forty-five seconds.\" \"Dad'snright,\" Lynn agreed, \"Sorry Captain Lone Starr, but it's prettynmuch over, I'm afraid.\" \"It'snnot over yet,\" Lone Starr said emphatically, \"Because I stillnhave the power of the Schwartz.\" \"Hello,nEarth to Captain Lone Starr, Dark Helmet threw your ring into thencore!\" Willie shouted hysterically, possibly out of fear that therenwas less than forty seconds left. \"Thenring's nothing,\" Lone Starr said, \"The Schwartz is in me. nEveryone grab hold of me; it's the only way.\" \"Thisnis insane,\" Kate muttered, but she grabbed a hold of Lone Starr'snjacket like everyone else. Lone Starr looked up at the cliff andnconcentrated as hard as he could. Immediately, he lifted off thenground like magic and levitated upward toward the top of the plateau.n \"Good thinking, LS!\" Alf shouted emphatically, \"Keep thatnSchwartz power pumping!\" \"Ohnmy God, we're high up, we're really high up!\" Kate was shoutingnnow as the lava-filled surface of Exodosus receded below them. Shenshut her eyes until they came to a firm landing at the top of thenplateau. Lone Starr gestured upward to the large ice creamncone-shaped spacecraft blasting toward them. Inside the cockpit,nYogurt waved back. \"Okay Rinky, drop the ladder,\" he told thenDink driving the ship, \"And get as low as you can; we're onlyngoing to get one pass at this—as if we ever do get more.\" \"Dinkndink dink, dink dink,\" the Dink winked and pressed the buttons tonlower the steel ship ladder down into place. He then pushed low tonget lined up perfectly. Butnjust when everything seemed neatly wrapped up, another earthquakenrocked the plateau, which then started collapsing to the ground. n\"Drat!\" Lynn cursed, \"As if this couldn't get any worse!\" \"Everybody,nmake like Carl Lewis!\" Barf shouted, running toward the far end ofnthe plateau and rescue. With the ground rapidly giving way behindnthem, no one argued. Still, Yogurt's ship was still a long waynoff. \"Indon't think we're going to make it!\" Kate cried, hoisting Briannup on her shoulders before he could far behind. \"We'llnmake it!\" Alf counter argued, \"Or my name isn't Alf—which ofncourse, you know, it really isn't.\" \"Couldnyou save it till we get on board, if we get on board?\" Willienscolded him. The collapsing plateau was right on their heels, andnthey were about to run out of land. Below them lay bubbling lava atntemperatures well over a million degrees. \"Gonfor broke!\" Lone Starr yelled. Putting on their last bursts ofnspeed, everyone jumped off the edge of the plateau just as itncollapsed, and in perfect synchronization flew through the air beforengrabbing hold of the ladder as Yogurt's ship blew past. \"If thatnwasn't close, I don't know what is,\" Barf said, breathing a bignsigh of relief, \"For a moment there, I thought I was going to endnup a real hot dog.\" \"Notnto go off topic, but on Melmac, we didn't have hot dogs, we had hotncats,\" Alf explained.\" \"Donyou always have to bring cats up at the wrong timer?\" Williengroaned, looking nauseated. Thentrapdoor slid open. \"Uh, you folks want to come inside, or wouldnyou prefer to be irradiated when the planet blows in twenty seconds?\"nYogurt asked down to them. \"Isnthat a trick question?\" Alf asked him back, \"Of course we'rencoming up.\" Onnthe other side of the planet, the bad guys' escape rocket—with nonone at the controls—weaved drunkenly all over the sky, spelling outnthe phrase \"Eat at Joe's\" with its exhaust. Finally, itncrashed back to the ground inside a canyon. The villains tumblednout, their buttocks visible from the scraping against the launchntube. \"Right back where we started!\" a frustrated Skroobngroaned, looking up at the insurmountable canyon walls, \"And Incould swear this wasn't in the script!\" \"Thisnplanet will self-destruct in exactly ten seconds,\" the computernblurted out, \"Counting down. Ten, nine, two, five, eight, three…\" \"It'snbusted,\" Helmet let out a small chuckle, \"It's lost its mind! nMaybe it won't blow after all.\" \"Don'tnyou wish,\" the computer said tauntingly. Realizing they were oncenagain out of luck, the three villains donned blindfolds andncigarettes and waited for the end of the world as the countdownnrecommenced: \"Eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two,none…happy Purim.\" \"Thanknyou,\" Skroob, Sandurz and Helmet moaned. \"You'renwelcome,\" the computer answered. And with that, Exodosus explodednin a massive supernova. Fragments of the planet scattered to allnsections of the galaxy, many of them barely missing Yogurt's shipnas it jetted out of harm's way. Inside the cockpit, all the goodnguys cheered at the demise of evil yet again. \"We did it!\" Barfnhowled in delight, \"We' repainted Helmet's little red wagon allnover again!\" \"Andnthen whitewashed it for good measure,\" Alf added. He popped anbottle of champagne. \"OK, who gets the first drink?\" \"Looknat there,\" Brian pointed out the window. The Dink driving the shipnjust managed to stop in time to avoid hitting the fragment of thenplanet to which the bad guys were now clinging for their lives. \"Sonlong, suckers!\" Alf shouted at them as they flew past at well overnthe speed of sound, \"See you next Nathanganger!\" Onnthe soaring meteor, Helmet stopped screaming for a second to shakenhis fist at the receding ice cream ship. \"This isn't over yet,nLone Starr!\" he bellowed, \"Nor with you, Shumway! Next film, Inwill get my revenge once and for all!\" \"Black,nblack, black, black…!\" Sandurz stammered in horror. Helmetnturned around to see that they were flying straight toward a blacknhole. \"Run!\" he screamed, pushing forward as hard as he could,n\"Try and reverse course!\" Skroobnand Sandurz tried to run along with him, but it was already too late.n With a low thwooping sound, the meteor was sucked into the blacknhole, taking all three men with it. On board Yogurt's ship, LonenStarr saluted it as it vanished from sight. \"Godspeed, DarknHelmet,\" he said reverently, \"You were the best—and only—foenI've ever faced.\" \"Donyou think he'd come back out of the hole?\" Lynn had to ask. \"Ohnsure he'll be back,\" Yogurt told her, \"In about a billionnyears.\" \"Don'tnbe too sure about that,\" Alf pointed out, \"They always come backnfor the sequels no matter how improbable the situation.\" \"Wellnif they do, we'll be ready,\" Yogurt entered some directionalncoordinates into the ship's computer, \"In the meantime, let'snget all you people home.\"[Chapter 18] EIGHTEEN \"So that's your final decision?\" Tripley asked Lone Starr as Yogurt's ship cruised back towards Druidia, \"After spending the whole storing saying how dejected you feel with Vespa, you'd still go back to her?\" \"Trip, I guess what I was looking for after all was just a little adventure,\" Lone Starr told him, \"One last great hurrah. Now that I've got it, I'll bed happier in my life as Prince Lone Starr. Don't ask me exactly why, but that's how I feel. This doesn't take anything away from you, though. You're still one of the greatest things that ever happened to me.\" \"Well, I'll keep that in mind the next time I pop by Druidia,\" Tripley said with a smile. Yogurt walked into the room with a megaphone. \"Attention everybody who isn't going back to the Moon of Vega,\" he announced, \"Boarding for departure to your home worlds will be beginning on the transit deck in five minutes, so be sharp.\" \"Uh, I've now got a slight problem, Yogurt,\" Lone Starr told him, \"I'm now…\" \"Without a Winnebago, I know,\" Yogurt told him, \"Well follow me, my boy; Uncle Yogurt's got everything all sorted out for you.\" \"What do you mean you've got every—you got me another Winnebago?\" Lone Starr couldn't believe his eyes. But revolving around in the docking bay was a brand new one. \"A carbon copy without any carbon; nobody on Druidia'll ever know the difference,\" the Schwartz master told him, \"Consider it a reward for your mastery of the Schwartz back there.\" \"Thanks Yogurt,\" Lone Starr shook his mentor's hand, \"I knew that would come in handy again. I should probably tell you I decided…\" \"To stay with Vespa,\" Yogurt knew it already, \"You're making a good choice, Lone Starr. Look hard enough and you'll find the happily ever after happiness.\" \"Hey Yogurt,\" Alf strolled over, \"I believe you promised me a snack of sorts for my part in the saving Druidia bargain.\" \"Yes, sure, you strike a hard bargain, Shumway; the cats are in the trunk,\" Yogurt pointed to the banana split shaped rocket the Dinks were busy fueling up for transport back to Earth. Alf nodded and walked over to the craft. \"All aboard,\" he called out—needlessly, as the Tanners were all strapped in and ready to go already. \"Captain Shumway would like to remind you to put out all cigarettes at this time and make sure your seats are upright and locked,\" he went on, hopping into the pilot seat. \"So you decided to come back to Earth after all, huh Alf?\" Lynn asked him with a knowing smile. \"Yeah,\" Alf admitted, \"I talked to Rhonda, and we agreed I wasn't quite ready yet—again. I'd still have a lot to do with you guys before I'd really want to leave.\" \"Thanks Alf,\" Brian hugged him. \"OK, let's not get too emotional, B,\" his friend told him, \"It's not like anyone's dying or anything—yet.\" \"Please don't say that,\" Willie mumbled. \"I take it you haven't had the best of trips, Willie,\" his houseguest pointed out. \"Oh it's been wonderful,\" Willie told him, \"I always wanted to be kidnapped by aliens, tortured unmercifully, almost executed, almost be killed escaping from an exploding planet, and be scared half to death that my son was killed. And as usual, I have you to thank for it, Alf.\" \"You're welcome,\" Alf patted him on the shoulder, \"You see how exciting you life can be with me?\" \"Dink dink dink dink dink dink dink,\" one of the Dinks announced, throwing a switch to open the bay doors. The dark of space lay before everyone below. \"OK, lock up everyone, it's shove off time,\" Yogurt added. \"Thanks again, Yogurt,\" Lone Starr shook his hand one more time, \"I hope we'll meet again in Spaceballs III.\" \"Unless my agent tells me otherwise, you betcha,\" Yogurt winked. Lone Starr nodded. Then he turned to Tripley and gave her a final goodbye hug. \"Take care of yourself, Trip,\" he told her. \"I will,\" she said, giving him a thumbs-up, \"Fly safely.\" \"You know it,\" Lone Starr said. Then he slowly walked over to the new Winnebago. \"Take care, everyone,\" he said to them all. \"Dink dink,\" the Dinks told him as one. \"Watch the traffic on the express—\" Alf started to say, by was cut off as the roof of the banana split ship lowered on his head. Gasping for air, he just managed to pull it back in before he asphyxiated. Nonplussed, he started the engine and revved it wildly. \"Earth, he we come,\" he announced as he floored it—backwards into the wall. \"Oops, I forgot the controls are the other way in this part of the galaxy,\" he said sheepishly. \"Alf, give me the controls,\" Willie ordered him, \"We just can't having you joyriding…\" Alf paid no attention. He pressed what had to be about every button on the control panel before he finally hit the Forward switch. The banana split rocketed off into the cosmos toward Earth. Seconds later, Lone Starr took off with his brand new Winnebago and zoomed the other way. \"Godspeed,\" Yogurt called after both crafts, \"And may the Schwartz be with yooouuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!\" \"Ah, no place like back in the solar system,\" Alf announced as his crafted exited the Centuri Wormhole and returned to a more familiar part of space. \"Now if you'll look to the left,\" he pointed out the window, \"You'll see Alvin and Dave, which I told you about numerous times before you believed me on them.\" ","Summary":" ALFBALLS BY BOB WRIGHT AUTHOR'S NOTE: ALFnis a registered trademark of Alien Productions and Paul F"},{"Movie":"Pagemaster","Title":"The Pagemaster II - A New Chapter","Author":"MagicMovieNerd","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12966239","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Prologue Once upon a time, there was a library. It was no ordinary library – it had a magical secret. Anyone who fell asleep or was knocked unconscious within the library's walls would be whisked away into the magical land of Libralia – a wondrous realm of the world's greatest works of literature in which all the greatest characters within those stories came to life. The world was divided into five sections: the Isle of Adventure, the Dimension of Science Fiction, the World of Fantasy, the Crypts of Horror, and the Paths of Mystery. All those worlds were ruled by an elderly and wise wizard known as the Pagemaster, and his five talking books who served as his loyal servants and advisors; their names were Adventure, Fantasy, Horror, Science Fiction, and Mystery. Adventure was a light brown book that resembled a pirate: he had a hook on his right hand and a peg on his left leg; he also had a brown mustache, a yellow and orange polka-dotted bandana, a fake black eyepatch, a brown belt with a sword, and a black colonial shoe over a red and white striped sock. Fantasy was a lavender book that resembled a fairy godmother; she had tiny wings, hot pink hair with a gold crown on top and wore a pink skirt, reading glasses, white stockings, and glass slippers, and she also carried a magic wand. Horror was a blue book with a misshapen spine, and resembled a hunchback; he had heterochromia – his left eye was purple and his right eye was yellow – a curly, dark blue binding on top of his head, and wore torn brown sleeves over his long arms, a tattered green collar, and brown cloth shoes. Science Fiction, nicknamed \"Sci Fi\", was a yellow book who was a scientist, alien exterminator and medical doctor; she had black hair, brown eyes, and wore big, round glasses and a Men in Black -styled outfit – a white blouse, a black jacket, tie, shorts, and high-heel boots. Mystery was a jade green book who worked as a detective; he had mahogany colored hair and green eyes, and he always wore a green jacket over a white dress shirt, red tie, brown vest, sand colored slacks and black shoes with white spats. All of the books were wise and loyal guardians of their respective sections. Long ago, the Pagemaster was chosen to rule Libralia by his uncle, because the young wizard was wise, caring, and loyal. His cousin Malaria, however, was self-centered and more interested in dark magic. When the time came for the one to be chosen to rule the library, Malaria's father chose her cousin instead of her. Malaria was enraged; she left Libralia and went far away to the restricted section, where no soul ever dared to venture. As the years passed, the Pagemaster ruled the land fairly and wisely, and eventually married and started a family. The Pagemaster and Pagemistress were blessed with a son named Matthias. The young Matthias learned from his father and the talking books about all the greatest works of literature, the characters, and the dos and don'ts of ruling a kingdom for when the time came for his reign. Eventually, Matthias grew up, and when he was in his mid-twenties, he met a young woman named Natalia. The Pagemaster and Pagemistress took a strong liking to Natalia's beauty and gentle nature; eventually Natalia and Matthias married and had four children: Alexander, Donovan, Mirabelle, and Bethylasia. The youngest of the Pagemaster's grandchildren, Bethylasia, was the most unusual but also most special of all. For instance, she was the only one of her siblings who wore glasses like her mother and grandmother, had an unusual name, and wore darker clothing than the rest of her family. But the young girl was very gifted in reading books and understanding certain subjects. When she was seven years old, Bethylasia was given a special present for her birthday from her grandparents. It was a necklace that had a charm shaped like an open book. \"It's beautiful!\" cried the young princess. \"We're glad you love it,\" said the Pagemistress, \"Your grandfather and I have another surprise for you.\" She motioned to her husband to get something. When the Pagemaster came back, he had a large book with a blue leather covering, a silver buckle locking the turn-ins together. On the front cover were the words \"The Pagemaster\" written in old medieval text. \"Is it your diary, Grandfather?\" asked Donovan. \"No,\" said the Pagemaster, \"I am giving Bethylasia the key to all my stories inside my special book of events within Libralia.\" Everyone gasped in awe as little Bethylasia tried to open the book with all her might. \"Whoa, whoa!\" said her father, \"That's not the way to treat a special book. Here, let me show you.\" He took Bethylasia's new necklace and placed the charm into the silver keyhole. Then he turned it to the left, and the book's lock unlocked! The Pagemaster then opened the book himself. \"Look!\" he told everyone. The Pagemaster and Pagemistress took turns turning pages. \"See here,\" said the Pagemistress, \"Right now, Bethylasia is having her birthday.\" A picture in the book showed the royal family of Libralia at Bethylasia's current birthday party. \"That's me!\" cried the ecstatic little birthday girl. \"Yes,\" said her mother, \"What else is there, Pagemaster?\" Suddenly, the Pagemaster and Pagemistress got worried looks on their faces. \"This can't be good,\" whispered the Pagemaster. \"What?\" cried Mirabelle, \"What can't be good, Grandfather?\" \"Well, it seems to me that my evil cousin Malaria will be coming soon and she'll want revenge on me!\" cried the Pagemaster, immediately closing the book. \"Who's Malaria?\" asked Alexander. The Pagemaster then told everyone the story about how he was chosen to rule the land of books while Malaria wasn't. The wizard then added, \"I feel it in me that Malaria wants revenge on me and my family. She will return tomorrow morning and attack my kingdom, destroying literature and happiness; if that happens, no one will want to read books or come to the Real World's library anymore!\" \"What's the 'Real World'?\" asked Bethylasia. \"The Real World,\" explained the Pagemaster, \"Is a world far beyond our world in which we live – Libralia, for instance, is really a library that folks in the Real World come and go in to check out books for a while. That's why some books are gone for a period of time before they come back to us. Sometimes if people in that world fall asleep or are knocked unconscious, they will dream about coming to Libralia and journey through our land of stories.\" \"So we're all just dreams?\" asked Natalia, who was getting a little worried for the sake of her children. \"Not exactly,\" said the Pagemistress, \"We're fantastic beings brought to life by the minds of certain people with great ideas and large imaginations. But back on topic – if Malaria is coming tomorrow morning, we must plan an escape. Matthias, you and your family will sleep in your palace's main parlor tonight, and wake up at the slightest whim. That way, you'll be able to make it out quickly before Malaria comes!\" \"Yes, Mother,\" said Matthias. Later that night, the Pagemaster, Pagemistress, and their royal family all went to sleep in their palace's main parlor, keeping their ears open for any unusual sound that could mean trouble. Sure enough, at about four o'clock in the morning, a strong wind blew the main doors open! Everyone woke up in alarm! \"It's Malaria!\" cried the Pagemaster. \"Dearest,\" the Pagemistress told her husband, \"Take Matthias and the others! I'll stay behind and ward off Malaria's magic!' \"Are you sure you can do this?\" the Pagemaster asked his wife. \"Trust me!\" The Pagemaster led the royal family out through a hallway while the Pagemistress stayed behind to guard the palace. Just then, a woman with pale skin, white hair and purple eyes entered; it was Malaria, and she was dressed in a black and purple gown with one sleeve and a black tiara with a purple stone. Circling around her were some small dark spirits that moaned and laughed. \"Well, Pagemistress,\" said Malaria with calmness in her voice, \"We meet again. I'm surprised that husband and family of yours aren't around.\" \"They didn't want any confrontation with you, Malaria,\" replied the Pagemistress, who was getting irritated, \"We will not let you destroy literature!\" \"Then I'll destroy YOU to start!\" shouted Malaria, and she shot her hand out at the Pagemistress, concocting a purple bolt that struck the old woman in her chest, stopping her heart. The Pagemistress fell dead to the floor! \"MOTHER!\" screamed Matthias, who heard the whole thing. The prince came running, with his wife and children following. The Pagemaster only managed to hold Bethylasia back. \"Grandfather, let go!\" cried the youngest child. \"No, Bethylasia!\" said the Pagemaster, \"I won't risk having ALL my grandchildren sacrificed!\" The rest of the family came back to the parlor and found the lifeless Pagemistress lying on the floor. \"How sweet!\" said Malaria, \"The children and grandchildren have gathered around to mourn the departed. Now I will make sure none of you move while I finish my work!\" Malaria waved her hand in the air, and made some black and purple smoky dust; then she shot the dust at the royal family, which turned them all into stone! Bethylasia and the Pagemaster, who were hiding behind a curtain, saw the whole thing. \"Mama and Papa,\" whispered Bethylasia sadly, as a tear fell down her cheek, \"My brothers and sister.\" \"No time to mourn, darling!\" whispered the Pagemaster, \"We must keep going. My book servants are waiting in another part of Libralia to help us!\" For seven days and nights, the Pagemaster and Bethylasia travelled from the palace across rugged terrain and snowy mountains until they came to a secret cave in the fantasy section. \"Grandfather, why are we here?\" asked Bethylasia. The Pagemaster just took the little girl in his arms and gave a big hug; a tear came down his cheek. \"Bethylasia, I am sending you away to the Real World. There you will grow up and live another identity until the time is right.\" \"For what? What about my family?\" \"Not to worry, dearest,\" said the Pagemaster, \"You'll learn in time.\" Suddenly, the young girl began to float off the ground. She was then whisked away into a magic typhoon, which carried her far and wide into a realistic world, where she went from an \"illustrated\" person to a real human being. She fell from the ceiling of a library's rotunda, where she entered the body of Becca Ridges, a girl who looked exactly like her, and was sleeping on a chair. A few seconds later, she woke up. A librarian named Mr. Dewey ran to her side and helped her up. \"Are you okay, sweetheart?\" he asked, \"You can't fall asleep here, you know. Where are your parents?\" \"I don't know,\" answered the girl, \"I had a dream where I was a cartoon, and my parents were turned into stone, and a wizard turned me back into a real person…\" \"Becca!\" said a woman. It was the girl's mother, Tasha. \"I'm sorry,\" Tasha told Mr. Dewey, \"My daughter didn't get a good sleep last night. She's really into books and stays up long hours to read 'one more chapter'.\" \"I understand,\" said Mr. Dewey, \"I see she has quite an imagination with her explanation of her so-called dream!\" Tasha took Becca's hand and the two of them left the library. \"Honey,\" said Tasha, \"I want you to stop staying up all night to read books. You are seven years old and you need your sleep!\" \"Sorry, Mom,\" said Becca, \"But I just had this really cool dream where I was a cartoon, and you and dad were put under some kind of magic spell, and there was this wizard who told me to go home and come back when the time was right!\" \"Oh, sweetie, it's just a dream,\" comforted Tasha as she got her daughter into her car to go home, \"There's nothing to be afraid of.\" But young Becca twirled around with her necklace, which had a charm looking like an open book…[Chapter 2] Chapter 1 - A Flashback and Fear Ten Years Later Boom! Crash! Seventeen-year-old Becca woke up. Outside her bedroom window, a thunderstorm was occurring. The auburn-haired girl with copper eyes was dreaming when she woke up. In Becca's dream, she was sleeping in a meadow chock-full of white daisies and yellow dandelions. She wore her pair of glasses, a purple long-sleeved t-shirt, blue jeans, and brown hiking boots. Then all of sudden, a mysterious figure tapped her on the shoulder. \"Come on,\" it whispered, \"Are you ready?\" \"Huh?\" Becca asked in her dream. \"You know, the hike!\" said the figure, who was her best friend Nicole. She was a girl with short blonde hair and blue eyes. She wore a blue short-sleeved shirt, a brown skirt that cut off at her knees, and gray shoes. \"Oh yeah!\" said Becca, \"Let's go, girlfriend!\" So Becca and Nicole hiked down a familiar path into the forest. The two talked about school, their favorite activities, and their plans for college. Unknown to them, a hungry grizzly bear was watching its freshly killed deer – which was not far away from where Becca and Nicole were hiking! The Bear snuck up behind them, breathing very heavily. \"Do you hear that?\" Becca asked Nicole when she heard the breathing. Nicole turned around, and there – about five feet away – was the bear standing on two legs, growling and huffing! The girls immediately stood broadly and said sternly, \"Go away, Bear! Don't follow us! Go away!\" The bear didn't budge. Instead, it got back down on all fours and charged at the girls! Becca immediately dropped face-down to the ground, playing dead… and woke up from her dream. \"Another flashback,\" Becca whispered to herself, and began crying silently. The dream reflected back to her, how the last summer, she lost her best and only friend to a grizzly bear attack. Nicole was the one who always listened to Becca's stories about her daydreaming in the local library, and always comforted her when she needed help. The two of them always did the same things together since they were twelve years old – swimming at the YMCA, reading their favorite books, and hiking in the great outdoors. \"You two are like peas in a pod!\" Becca's father would always say. But one day, everything changed; the girls decided to go hiking in the local state park with Nicole's family. So far, everything went smooth, but then came the attack; the bear swiped Nicole in the face with its front paw, bit her on the arm, and swiped her repeatedly until she couldn't move anymore. Becca survived with only a few scratches, because she was playing dead. When the bear went away, Becca ran to Nicole's parents, and called for paramedics. By the time Becca's friend reached the hospital, it was too late. Nicole had lost so much blood and had devastating bites and scratches all over her body that she died before reaching the emergency room. To that day, Becca was terrified of animals, especially large ones with sharp teeth and claws. Becca stopped her tears, put on her glasses, and tiptoed to the bathroom to get a glass of water. But while she was in the hallway, she heard her parents talking in a bedroom. \"Tasha,\" said her father, Mark, \"every teenager is afraid of something.\" \"Becca's afraid of cracking an egg open!\" replied Tasha. \"Getting deadly proteins from the egg yolk into her bloodstream,\" corrected Mark, \"She says it's the same as getting bitten by a black mamba.\" \"Whatever.\" \"Tasha, ever since her best friend was killed, the animal kingdom has been a frightening place for her. I think you should be a little more supportive.\" \"Supportive? I'm about the most supportive mother in the world, and I'm running out of supportive things to do! I tried helping her volunteer at animal shelter, she drove the employees crazy about news stories focused on pit bulls attacking people! Did you know that when a pregnant woman cleans a cat's litter box, she may become sick with toxoplasmosis? Mark, she brought a first aid kit. Nobody wanted her volunteering after that! Now our neighbor and I are thinking about having Becca babysit a dog she refuses to even pet!\" \"You know that she's still traumatized about the bear attack,\" said Mark in a comforting tone. \"I know,\" said Tasha, calming down, \"But she can't just let it haunt her for the rest of her life.\" Back in the hallway, Becca was still listening to her parents' conversation when their bedroom light turned off. \"Okay, I'm fine!\" Becca told herself. Just then, lightning flashed, with the light revealing a picture of a ferocious tiger in the hallway! Becca gasped and ran back into her room! \"No, I'm not!\" she said. The girl went back into her bed and pulled the covers over her face. She thought about what her mother said about letting Nicole's death haunt her forever. Mom's right, Becca thought, I need to move on. She took her glasses off, put them on her bedside table, and went back to sleep.[Chapter 3] Chapter 2: That Feeling of Loss The next day, Becca was preparing for a special day at school. Today was the day she and her homeroom class would take a field trip to the local library to learn about ways on helping the community by promoting reading. Becca put on a white long-sleeved turtleneck shirt, a black skirt that cut off at her knees, a pair of black socks up to her knees, and a pair of black Ariat clogs. She also put on her favorite necklace, which had an open book for a charm. When she came downstairs, her parents looked at her in awe. \"You look rather spiffed up today,\" said Tasha. \"It's nothing special,\" replied Becca, \"I'm just going on a field trip with my homeroom class.\" \"Well if you're just going to a library, I don't understand why you're dressing for a special event,\" said Mark. \"I don't know,\" said Becca, \"I just thought it would be nice to dress up.\" \"Well that's fine with me.\" While Becca ate her breakfast consisting of a naval orange, a bowl of Trix cereal, and some iced water, she set about packing her lunch: a peanut butter and jelly sandwich with Goldfish crackers, an apple, and two Oreos. Mark checked his wristwatch and said, \"Well, I think I'd better get going to work.\" \"Okay, honey,\" said Tasha, \"We'll see you this evening. Don't forget – tonight's dinner is going to be your favorite – tuna casserole!\" \"Mmmmmm!\" said Mark, giving Tasha a kiss on the cheek before leaving. \"Great,\" mumbled Becca under her breath, \"Another crappy dinner that I hate.\" \"Becca!\" said Tasha, \"I heard that! Besides, you can make a tuna sandwich out of the tuna I have left.\" The mother's annoyed look then became a softened face of sympathy. Becca paced back and forth at the front door. \"Honey, I'm sorry,\" said Tasha, \"But you know I don't want Nicole's death haunting you the rest of your life. You have to move on. I also want you to do better in school.\" \"I'm trying,\" Becca said with little enthusiasm. Ever since Nicole's death, Becca's school grades had been going down; she went from straight A's to C's and D's. The reason was because she started thinking that she didn't belong to Tasha and Mark anymore; Becca became lost in a world full of darkness and demons that represented grief, fear, and being bullied by other kids in school. \"Becca, your math teacher says you've been drawing pictures of snakes with wings on your homework papers,\" said Tasha, \"And your language arts teacher said to me that some kids call you a crybaby or a coward – and you are none of those things – is something going on that I need to know? Don't be afraid to speak up.\" \"Okay,\" said Becca, \"So I can't get over Nicole's death, and I don't want anybody around me, that's all.\" Just then, Becca looked at the clock above the kitchen stove. \"Oh my God!\" she said, \"I gotta get going! School starts in twenty minutes!\" Quickly, Becca grabbed her paper bag of lunch and put it into her backpack. \"Have a good day, sweetie,\" said Tasha, giving her daughter a kiss, \"And have a nice time at the library!\" \"I will!\" Becca called as she put on her coat, grabbed her backpack, and went out the door. When she got outside to the brisk autumn-touched street, Becca sang a song: The Earth is cold,the fields are bare, The branches fold against the wind that's everywhere A flock of birds then flew by, while Becca noticed a kindergarten-aged boy holding his mother's hand and carrying a teddy bear. The birds move on, so they survive, When snow's so deep, The bears all sleep, To keep themselves alive. They do what they must for now, and trust in their plan. If I trust in mine somehow, I might find who I am! But where do I go from here? So many voices ringing in my ear, Which is the voice that I was meant to hear? How will I know? Where do I go from here? Becca ran to the end of her street, and turned left. Her school was soon in sight. My world has changed, and so have I, I've learned to choose and even learned to say goodbye. The path ahead, so hard to see, It winds and bends, But where it ends Depends on only me. In my heart I don't feel part of so much I've known, Now it seems it's time to start a new life on my own! But where do I go from here? So many voices ringing in my ear, Which is the voice that I was meant to hear? How will I know? Where do I go from here? Then she entered the main building just as the first bell rang at exactly eight-thirty. Little did she know that on this day, her life would change forever… Author's Note: The song \"Where do I Go From Here?\" (c) Disney[Chapter 4] Chapter 3 - The Field Trip Immediately, Becca went to her locker and unlocked it. While the girl was digging out her math textbook and language arts folder, a boy with black hair and fair skin across the hall said, \"Look everyone! It's that funeral-obsessed freak!\" Becca pretended not to hear the other kids jeer her for her zoophobia, the way she dressed, and the way she hung her head low. \"Hey, Ridges! Whose funeral are you going to today?\" \"If you keep being hunched over like that, you'll turn into a hunchback!\" \"You're scared of another teddy bear, aren't you?\" All the kids laughed as Becca just headed to her homeroom class in order to be present for the field trip. Getting to class was no easier, either, because other kids held their mouths to prevent laughing. \"Enough, class!\" said the teacher, Mrs. Clarke, \"Just because Becca stands out, that doesn't mean you have to make a big joke out of it!\" Becca sighed in relief that she had a least one person to stand up for her at school. After taking attendance, Mrs. Clarke said, \"Now class, the bus will be here any minute, so I must ask each and every one of you to line up slowly and calmly in an orderly fashion.\" Becca was the last one to get in line. Soon everyone went out to the bus, which took them on a twenty-minute drive to the public library. The exterior of the building looked almost like a grand museum that one would find in London or New York City. Statues of lions stood on both sides of a grand-looking staircase, and stone pillars guarded the doorway like two stoic Roman soldiers. Becca was very impressed as she followed her classmates into the library. Over twenty years ago, this library was about to go out of business. But one day, a little boy named Richard Tyler visited; he didn't really intend to go, but he wanted to escape a raging thunderstorm. No one to that day knew what happened to Richard inside the library, but he came out with three checked out books and new courage. Since that day, people all around town began to learn about Richard's experience at the library, and decided to visit it again and again. With people's regular visits and checking books out, Mr. Dewey, the owner, was so impressed that he added a few new employees in recent years. Now, the library was getting ready to hire young, aspiring people to help the hotspot for reading. When Mrs. Clarke's class entered the library, they were greeted by an old man with a plain, gray outfit. \"Welcome to the library, everyone!\" he said, \"Now, are you the class from Howard High School?\" \"Yes, sir,\" said Mrs. Clarke, as she introduced herself to Mr. Dewey. \"Now, then,\" said Mr. Dewey, \"As your teacher told me, you are all in here to learn about different types of jobs in the library, correct?\" Everyone nodded their heads. While Mr. Dewey talked about the library's code of conduct, Becca heard a high-pitched sound close by. She turned her head, and saw something moving beside some books on a cart. The girl came closer and suddenly, a white creature with brown markings looked up at her. Becca gasped, and saw that the creature was a little kitten. \"Hey,\" she whispered to the blue-eyed animal, \"You're not scary at all. You're kind of cute. I don't think they allow pets in the library, so I'd better hide you.\" Becca opened her backpack, gently picked up the kitten, and put it inside before zipping it not completely shut in order to give the animal some fresh air to breathe. \"Becca!\" whispered Mrs. Clarke, \"Pay attention, please!\" \"Oh, sorry, mam,\" said Becca, returning to her place in the group. \"You were talking to someone, I think,\" said Mrs. Clarke. Becca just made a face that said, \"No, I wasn't.\" After about five minutes of talking, Mr. Dewey led the kids to the center of the library, where a large rotunda was at the top of the ceiling. Becca looked up and saw beautiful paintings of what looked like a royal family. There was a man and a woman with four children – two boys and two girls. The younger girl looked exactly like Becca with the same auburn hair and copper eyes; she was even wearing glasses and a necklace with a book charm! Another painting had an evil sorceress with light blonde hair, purple eyes, and a purple and black gown; she was surrounded by black, smiling ghosts and purple smoke. A third painting showed a large grizzly bear, standing on its hind legs mouth open, and angry yellow eyes; Becca thought about the bear that killed Nicole. The fourth painting had a detective, a scientist, a hunchback, a pirate, and a fairy godmother standing together with different animals underneath them – a beaver, a squirrel, a woodchuck, a large weasel, and a small weasel. The final painting had a wizard dressed in sky blue and purple robe, carrying a golden staff. Just then, Becca rubbed her hands together, and raised her hand. \"Excuse me,\" she said, \"May I go wash my hands? I promise I'll be right back.\" \"Very well,\" said Mr. Dewey, \"But don't be too long. Your teacher and classmates will be getting ready to research different sections in ten minutes!\" \"Okay,\" said Becca. She then followed the signs to the ladies' restroom, taking off her backpack in the process. When she got to the bathroom, Becca opened her backpack and gently picked the kitten up out from her backpack. She looked at the animal's rear, and saw that it was female. \"So you're a girl, huh?\" Becca said to the kitten, \"I think I'll name you Sheila. That's a nice name.\" She put Sheila into her backpack and washed her hands, leaving the backpack on the counter by one of the sinks. As Becca was drying her hands with a paper towel, she slipped on a patch of water, and fell to the floor, hitting her head against the wall. The girl lost consciousness and suddenly, everything seemed to spin around…[Chapter 5] Chapter 4 - Arriving in Libralia Becca then got up and grabbed her backpack with Sheila inside. When she got out of the restroom, however, all was quiet. Her class and Mr. Dewey were gone. \"HELLO!\" Becca called. The only answer she got was her echo. Just then, other sounds came about – swords clashing, horses running, wolves howling, the wind blowing, and a thunder crash. \"Uh-oh,\" the girl told herself. Suddenly, something dropped onto her hand. It was a drop of purple paint. Becca thought of nothing and just wiped the drop on her backpack. Then, some blue and red drops of paint fell. Then, there came green and white, then purple and yellow. Becca looked up at the rotunda and could not believe her eyes. The paintings were melting, and paint was coming down. Just then, the paint began to pour onto the floor. Becca's backpack turned purple; the girl gasped and threw it down, taking Sheila into her arms! Becca ran away from the messy paint screaming! But then, the paint came together and morphed into the shape of a bear; it roared and chased after the girl and her kitten! Becca kept screaming as she ran around bookshelves, with the magic paint following her! \"Mrs. Clarke! Where are you?!\" the poor girl cried, but no answer came. Finally, the exhausted Becca came back to the center of the library, where the paint splashed all over her and Sheila! Becca looked down at her hands. Something about them didn't seem right. Then she realized that she had transformed into a cartoon, almost like she had seen in Disney movies. \"I'm, I'm animated!\" she exclaimed. \"You mean 'illustrated,'\" said a voice. Becca turned around and saw an old man dressed in a blue, red, and purple robe; he also carried a golden staff with a page wrapped around it. \"Who are you?\" asked Becca. \"I am the Pagemaster,\" answered the old man, \"Keeper of the books, guardian of the Written World, and ruler of Libralia!\" \"What's Libralia?\" asked Becca. She thought she heard the term somewhere, but couldn't figure out where. \"It's where you are right now! Why, we have been waiting for you for a long time. Ten years, to be exact!\" \"I think you must be mistaken. My name is Becca Ridges, and right now I really wanna get out of here!\" \"You can't leave yet,\" said the Pagemaster, \"Your mission has just begun! Let me explain something to you. Long ago, my cousin, Malaria, and I were waiting to see who was going to rule Libralia. When her father and my uncle made his decision, he chose me instead of his daughter. Malaria was outraged; she went far away to the restricted section, despising literature and happiness since then. For a while, all was well with my new family. But one day, Malaria returned to Libralia to seek revenge on me. My wife, the Pagemistress, sacrificed herself to save me, our son, and his family. However, my youngest granddaughter, Bethylasia, and I escaped the siege while her parents and siblings were turned into stone by Malaria. After travelling for seven days and nights, I sent Bethylasia into the real world until it was time for her to return. Recently, I've had a vision that my granddaughter has returned.\" \"That's great!\" said Becca, \"But what does this have to do with me?\" \"Bethylasia hasn't appeared yet,\" said the Pagemaster, \"But until she comes, you must help me restore Libralia to become the happy, peaceful, and literature-loving kingdom it once was. You see, I've heard word that Malaria has found out that Bethylasia is back in this world, too. So now, she has returned with her phantom minions to terrorize my kingdom. A few days ago, I sent my talking book servants to help defeat Malaria, but my cousin has transformed them into animals!\" \"Talking books?\" Becca wondered feeling puzzled. \"You'll see,\" said the Pagemaster. At that moment, a moving cart came by. The Pagemaster put Becca onto the cart and said, \"Let your quest begin! Remember to pass five tests in the worlds of Mystery, Science Fiction, Horror, Adventure, and Fantasy! And when in doubt, look to the books!\" The wizard disappeared and the cart carrying Becca kept rolling along through the hallway! At last, the cart crashed into a wall, and Becca fell off into a pile of books. She felt something move in her left hand, and the girl immediately recognized the feel as fur. A tiny meow escaped the object. Becca looked down and saw that Sheila had turned into an illustration, too! \"Sheila, are you okay?\" Becca asked, \"I know I'm not. How will I know when this Bethylasia person comes? And what am I supposed to do to help?\" \"Ye can start by helping me out!\" muffled a pirate's voice from under the pile of books. \"What was that?!\" cried Becca.[Chapter 6] Chapter 5 - Meeting Adventure Becca rummaged through the pile of books and found a strange animal. It was a light brown beaver that had a hook on his front right paw, and a peg on his left hind leg. He was wearing a red and yellow polka-dotted bandana and a black eyepatch over one eye. \"Aarrgh!\" said the beaver, getting up and pointing a sword at the frightened girl and her kitten, \"Are ye the ones who threw me from the poopdeck?\" \"What are you talking about?\" asked Becca. \"What's yer title?\" \"Becca,\" stammered the girl, \"Becca Ridges!\" \"A very odd title for a book, I must say,\" replied the beaver. \"I'm not a book, and I can prove it!\" Becca dug into the pocket of her skirt and picked up a plastic card. \"See?\" she said, \"This is my name!\" \"A library card?!\" gasped the beaver, \"Shiver me timbers! I didn't know ye was a customer!\" \"Well, actually, I was part of a school field trip,\" explained Becca, \"It's a long story, but your Pagemaster said that I'm supposed to help save a kingdom from an evil curse until the Pagemaster's granddaughter comes and saves the day!\" \"Ye mean Bethylasia?\" \"Yes. But I don't know who Bethylasia is or what she looks like!\" The beaver didn't answer. He just stared at Becca as if she were a magical creature. \"Excuse me,\" said Becca, \"But why are you staring at me all of a sudden?\" \"Oh, beg pardon!\" said the beaver, \"It's just that you look an awful lot like… never mind. Me title is Adventure! I'm the guardian of the Isle of me own name!\" \"You mean you're one of the talking books the Pagemaster was talking about?\" asked Becca. \"Of course! That is, until the wretched sea dragon Malaria turned me into a beaver!\" \"Oh no!\" said Becca, \"But first thing's first! Where do I begin my quest?\" Adventure started thinking. \"Maybe,\" he said aloud, \"We could go down this hallway, and then turn left? No! What about going down the hallway, and just keep going straight? No!\" While Adventure was contemplating which direction to go, Becca began to have a strange feeling inside. She picked up Sheila and said, \"I don't know, Sheila. Something tells me that I know this place, I just don't know what it is.\" Becca's thoughts were interrupted when Adventure said, \"I've got it! We'll journey up this ladder here, and you can get a look around!\" \"Okay,\" said Becca, \"Would you mind watching over my kitten, please?\" She handed Sheila to Adventure while she climbed up a nearby ladder. Immediately, Sheila started playing with Adventure's mustache. \"Stop that!\" said Adventure, but the kitten toyed around with the ends of the beaver's mustache with her paws. Meanwhile, Becca had made her way up to the top of the ladder. She climbed onto the top of a bookshelf and looked around. High above her were clouds, rainbows, and colorful birds flying and chirping; there was even a silver flying saucer and a blue and red hot air balloon with a couple riding in its basket. In the distance, a knight was battling a fire-breathing dragon while a fair maiden was gazing out of her tower. There was also a pirate ship, leaping dolphins, a haunted house, and an enchanted forest. Becca turned around and saw something that was the total opposite. Behind her, there was nothing but dark clouds, a purple sky, and menacing creatures. The sight of it made her scream! Back down below, Adventure heard Becca screaming and bumped into the ladder. The ladder then toppled over and fell to the ground! \"Adventure, help!\" screamed Becca. \"Hold on, lassie!\" called Adventure, as he pulled some books off the shelf to make a cushion for Becca to land safely on. \"Don't tell me I have to jump down!\" cried Becca. \"Tis the only way!\" said Adventure. Instead, Becca slowly began to climb down from the shelf. She placed her feet one by one on the lower shelves while she used her hands to hold onto a shelf above her head. Just when she was two shelves above the ground, one of her feet slipped off, and Becca began to lose her grip! Quickly, she grabbed onto a shelf with both her hands. Sheila and Adventure gathered more books for Becca to land on. At last, the poor girl couldn't hold on anymore; she lost grip and fell into the pile of books! Becca rubbed her sore backside, but then she heard more muffling underneath her![Chapter 7] Chapter 6 - Fantasy's Appearance Becca immediately stood up and rummaged through the book pile. She felt something fluffy, but then something else slapped her hand! \"Ouch!\" cried Becca. Out of the book pile came a female lavender-colored squirrel with a tuft of hot pink hair on her head; she also wore a little gold crown and reading glasses. \"Serves you right for piling me into the pile and squashing me!\" said the squirrel in an African American accent. \"But I'm not the one who threw you into the pile!\" protested Becca, \"It was him!\" She pointed at Adventure. \"Adventure!\" shouted the squirrel, \"I'll deal with you later. Now come over here and help me find my wand!\" \"A wand?\" asked Becca, \"You must be a fairy godmother!\" \"Yes,\" said the squirrel, calming down a bit, \"After all, it was ME who helped Cinderella go to the ball and meet Prince Charming! My name is Fantasy, guardian of the World of Fantasy within this land of Libralia!\" \"Are you another one of those talking books?\" asked Becca. \"I am! At least I was, until the evil sorceress Malaria turned me into a squirrel. Now I have no wings, no pages, and only a little bit of magic in my wand. Then, again, my wand works better when I'm in my own section.\" Becca was looking through the pile of books when she felt something. She picked it up and it looked like a finely thin silver stick. \"Is this your wand, Fantasy?\" she asked. \"Why, yes!\" said Fantasy, \"As a matter of fact, it is, honey!\" Fantasy took the wand from Becca's hand and dusted it off a bit. Becca had another thought – Adventure and Fantasy looked and sounded very familiar somehow, but the girl couldn't quite put the pieces of her puzzled memory together. Her thoughts were interrupted when Fantasy said, \"Who's this little angel?\" Becca snapped out of it and saw that Fantasy was playing with Sheila. \"Oh, that's Sheila,\" said Becca, \"I can see she likes you already!\" \"Yes she does!\" said Fantasy, and then turning to Sheila, she said, \"Aren't you? You little honeybun…\" \"All right!\" said Adventure, \"Playtime's over! It's about time I show ye the way out!\" \"This guy thinks he's too cool for school,\" Fantasy murmured to Becca. Adventure was just about to lead the way to what he thought was the way out, when Fantasy stepped in. \"Just a minute there, tough guy!\" she said, \"Who put you in charge of this quest? Haven't you forgotten about who's the magical one?\" \"Now just a minute there, missy!\" said Adventure, \"I've sailed the seven seas and travelled the seven continents! I know the way out!\" Unknown to anyone, someone was watching them. The strange being crept slowly out of its hiding place and shot a ray gun at Adventure and Fantasy! Luckily, the blast missed both of them. Becca turned her head and looked around for the shooter. \"What was that?\" she called out. \"That was me!\" said a tough female voice, \"What does it take to get a little peace and quiet around here?!\"[Chapter 8] Chapter 7 - Sci Fi and Mystery Becca got a better look at the strange creature with the ray gun. It was a lemon yellow-colored pine marten with short, black hair and brown eyes. It also had on big, round glasses. The marten looked at Becca and asked, \"What are you doing in…. here?\" The marten looked at Becca with a look of surprise and confusion. \"My name is Becca,\" replied the girl, \"My class and I were on a field trip in the library, and I went to the bathroom, but when I came out, everyone was gone, and suddenly, I was in, uh, Libralia, is it?\" \"Yes,\" said the marten, \"Anyway, my name is Science Fiction. I'm the guardian of the Dimension of Science Fiction. But you can call me Sci Fi.\" \"So are you another one of those talking books?\" \"Yes,\" said Sci Fi, \"I was, anyway, until that dirty little slut Malaria turned me into a marten! Now I don't have any of my gadgets or medical supplies or weapons! Only this ray gun that I warned your friends over there with.\" \"You mean Adventure and Fantasy?\" asked Becca. Sci Fi turned around and saw the beaver and squirrel glaring at her. \"You blasted seadog!\" cried Adventure, \"Ye tried to kill me!\" Fantasy was about to yell at the marten when she realized something. \"Sci Fi?\" said Fantasy, \"My best friend?\" \"Fantasy!\" said Sci Fi, running to Fantasy and giving her a hug, \"C'mere and let the good times roll!\" Then, the marten lowered her voice to a whisper. \"Do you see what I see?\" she asked Fantasy, \"That girl may be Incess-pray Ethylasia-bay!\" \"What makes you think that?\" Fantasy whispered back. \"Well, don't you notice her hair and eye colors? Not to mention the necklace around her neck?\" \"What are ye ladies gossipin' about?\" asked Adventure. \"None of your concern, sweetheart!\" scoffed Sci Fi, \"Now if you don't mind, I think this girl here has a quest she should be fulfilling!\" \"How'd you know about that?\" Becca asked Sci Fi. \"I was hearing everything you and the others said. And as far as I'm concerned, I don't think Bethylasia is too far away to give us assistance!\" \"That's good,\" said Becca, \"Because the sooner I can get done with this quest, the sooner I can get home! My classmates, teacher, and even my parents are probably worried sick about me right now!\" \"I wouldn't worry 'bout that too much,\" said Adventure, \"Because I think I found a book to help us!\" Becca took the book from Adventure and looked at the title. It was Cujo by Stephen King. \"Are you sure this is the right one?\" the girl asked as she slowly opened the book. Out of the pages came the infamous titular dog with foam coming out of its mouth! Becca screamed and yelled, \"RUN!\" She, Sheila, and the other animals ran away while the rabid St. Bernard chased them. Not far away, someone heard their cries for help. It was a jade green-colored fisher weasel with a tuft of mahogany-colored hair and green eyes; he also wore little reading glasses. The fisher saw what was going on and cried, \"Oh my! Everyone hide here!\" Becca heard the request, and she gathered her new animal friends to hide in a bookshelf among other books. When they were well hidden, though, they tumbled down a hill and landed on a pile of leaves! \"All right!\" said Sci Fi, \"Whoever called for us to hide here is gonna get a big red scar on his butt!\" \"It was me!\" said the voice of the fisher weasel. He came out from the pile of leaves. \"Are you yet another book who talks?\" Becca asked as she looked at the fisher. \"Indeed I am,\" replied the fisher, \"My name is Mystery, guardian of the Paths of Mystery! Now, I don't mean to be personal, but you, young lady, look exactly like Beth- er, someone I used to know.\" \"Is this game?\" asked Becca with an annoyed look, \"Are you guys trying to say that you think I am Bethylasia?\" \"Not exactly, honey,\" said Fantasy, \"But you do look a lot like her.\" \"But I'm not! My name is Becca Ridges, and I'm just an ordinary girl who's lost in this library! But this place doesn't look a library to me…\" Becca looked around and saw dark clouds, dead trees, and a graveyard in the distance. \"I think this the Crypts of Horror,\" Said Sci Fi, \"And speaking of which, Mystery, what are you doing here in the wrong section?\" Mystery replied, \"Well, my section is not far away from this part of Libralia. It's just that shortly before I became a fisher, some dim-witted employee from the real world mishelved me! Anyway, we should probably start looking for some way out of this creepy place.\" \"I agree,\" said Becca, clutching Sheila tightly to her warm chest. The kitten let out a contented purr. So the newfound friends started to make their way toward the graveyard. Unknown to them, however, someone not far away was watching and listening to them.[Chapter 9] Chapter 8: Malaria's Plot A black-feathered raven with a yellow beak was perched on a dead tree branch. \"Did those animals say what I think they said?\" he asked himself, \"Oh, Malaria's gonna be so mad when she finds out that Bethylasia's back!\" The raven flew many miles back to the restricted section, Malaria's domain. The restricted section looked like something out of a horrific fairy tale; the skies were purple with black clouds, bats and birds of prey circled high above, and up atop the highest hill was Malaria's castle. It was a black castle with smoky clouds and ghosts coming out of its dark windows, a moat filled with cloudy water and hungry crocodiles and snakes, and a distinctive high tower where Malaria concocted her evil spells. Eddie flew up to that particular tower, and found Malaria nervously fidgeting her hands and hips in her favorite chair. \"Ten years of peace and quiet,\" she said to herself, \"And now something's troubling me!\" \"Your excellency,\" said Eddie, \"I think I may know…\" \"My ghost minions are acting stranger than usual. They're moaning harder than they've ever been in the past decade! I need to look at my crystal ball and see.\" Just then, Malaria saw Eddie. \"Eddie, where have you been?\" Malaria demanded as she grabbed the raven around his abdomen, \"Here I am, feeling sick and suffering horrific dreams while you go lollygagging about?\" \"But your excellency,\" protested Eddie, \"I think I know what may be troubling you!\" \"You do?\" Malaria asked, calming down. \"Yes! I saw Bethylasia and those books-turned animals walking in the Crypts of Horror!\" \"But this can't be!\" said Malaria, \"Bethylasia has been missing for ten- wait! Did you say, 'Bethylasia?'\" The poor raven nodded. \"Do you mean that I will be defeated?\" Malaria asked with worry. Eddie was lost in words for what to say. \"I hope not,\" he said, \"But there's a slight chance that this girl in the library might…\" \"Bethylasia or not, she can't stop me!\" said Malaria, \"I'll make sure that my revenge against the little brat's family and grandfather is complete!\" Malaria summoned her ghost demons and started singing: In the dark of the night, I was tossing and turning, And the nightmare I had was as bad as can be, It scared me out of my wits: A corpse falling to bits! Then I opened my eyes, and the nightmare was me! The evil sorceress went over to her black crystal ball, waved her hand, and was given a vision of Becca walking through the graveyard with her new friends. I was once the most mystical dame in all Libralia, When my family betrayed me, they made a mistake! My curse made each of them pay, But one little girl got away! Bethylasia, beware! Malaria's awake! Then the ghosts, bats, spiders, and rats sang a chorus: In the dark of the night, evil will find her, In the dark of the night, just before dawn! Malaria rummaged through some books and picked up a big, purple book with an onyx on the front cover. Revenge will be sweet, When the curse is complete! (In the dark of the night) She'll be gone! The sorceress turned a few pages until she found the right one to concoct a magic spell from the onyx pendant on her necklace. I can feel that my powers are slowly returning, Tie my sash and a dash of cologne for that smell, As the pieces fall into place, I'll see her crawl into place! Do svidaniya, Becca, your grace! Farewell! Creatures: In the dark of the night, terror will strike her! Malaria: Terror's the least I can do! Creatures: In the dark of the night, evil will brew! Malaria: Soon she will feel, That her nightmares are real! (In the dark of the night) She'll be through! In the dark of the night, evil will find her! (Find her) In the dark of the night, terror comes true! (Doom her) My dear, here's a sign It's the end of the line! (In the dark of the night (2x)) At last, Malaria sent her tens of thousands of ghost minions to scale the horror section and find the perfect fright for Becca and her friends! Come my minions, rise for your mistress, Let your evil shine! (In the dark of the night (2x)) Find her now! Yes, fly ever faster! (In the dark of the night (3x)) She'll be mine! Author's Note: The Song \"In the Dark of the Night\" is from Anastasia (c) Fox[Chapter 10] Chapter 9 - Meeting Horror Meanwhile, back in the graveyard, Becca and the book animals were making their way through the cemetery when Mystery saw something. It as a strange-looking house with two distinctive features: a long lightning rod on the left of the roof, as well as a bell tower and the right of the roof. \"Hmmmm,\" said the fisher, \"Maybe whoever is living in that house could help us?\" \"I don't know about that,\" replied Becca, \"It looks questionable.\" \"I'm afraid it might be the only way out of this creepy place,\" said Sci Fi. Eventually, the friends made their way to the house. Scary-looking iron gates guarded by ferocious gargoyles circled the residence. Luckily, the gates were not locked, so Becca pushed open one of the entry doors with all her might to let herself and her friends in. Fantasy read the sign on the entryway. \"Dr. Victor Frankenstein,\" she said, \"That name sounds familiar.\" \"Sounds familiar to me, too,\" said Mystery, \"I can't put my finger on where I heard it last at the moment.\" Becca didn't like the sound of the name \"Victor Frankenstein\". It reminded her of watching the movie with Boris Karloff as the infamous monster. Her fears were pushed aside, however, when she saw Sheila running toward the front door. \"Sheila, come back!\" Becca whispered. She picked up her kitten and stared at the door. \"Better see if anyone's home, lassie,\" said Adventure. Becca took a deep breath and hesitated. \"Go ahead,\" said Sci Fi, \"Ring the bell. Becca breathed very fast and slowly pulled the rope to ring the doorbell. When the bell rang, however, a screaming creature fell from the roof! Sheila ran out of Becca's arms in the nick of time; the creature landed straight into the girl's arms! It was a woodchuck with blue-green fur, long arms, and heterochromia; his left eye was yellow, but his right eye was purple. He also had three little blue curls of fur on top of the right side of his head. \"Good catch!\" commented Sci Fi, who saw Becca catching the woodchuck in her arms. \"Here, take it,\" said Becca. \"No, you can hold him,\" said Sci Fi, \"He is such a sweetie!\" \"I know,\" said Fantasy, kissing at him. The woodchuck looked up at Becca. \"Oh, I scared you and your little kitty,\" he said, \"I'm sorry.\" Becca didn't like the look of the woodchuck's face; it was so misshapen that it disgusted her. \"You shouldn't judge a book by its cover,\" said Fantasy. \"You mean this thing is another one of those books under Malaria's spell?\" asked Becca. \"Yes, I think so,\" said Sci Fi. She saw Becca made a disgusted face and said, \"Look, he's smiling at you, see?\" The woodchuck smiled a big smile at Becca. The girl laughed a little bit as Sheila rubbed her leg with her head and let out a big purr. \"Alright, ladies!\" said an impatient Adventure, \"Enough chit-chat! Let's start navigatin' this house!\" The woodchuck gasped and jumped out of Becca's arms. \"Wait!\" he cried to Adventure, \"Don't go in there!\" \"Why not?\" asked Mystery. \"It's scary inside!\" said the woodchuck. \"Pfft! I'm scared of anything!\" scoffed Sci Fi, \"Back in my dimension, I was an alien exterminator!\" \"I'm afraid,\" said the woodchuck, tugging on Becca's skirt. \"Of what?\" asked Becca. The woodchuck made several scary faces, noises, and screams to indicate that he was afraid of the horror genre. Ironically, the group learned that his name iwas/i Horror, the guardian of the Crypts of Horror! \"I know just how you feel,\" said Becca, \"I'm scared of animals with sharp claws and teeth.\" Horror began to feel sad, because most of the other books had stories with happy endings. \"Horror never has happy endings,\" sighed the woodchuck, \"They're always sad endings.\" \"Well I come from a world of happy endings,\" said Fantasy. \"I think you should come with us,\" said Sci Fi, \"Becca, here, says she needs help with a quest.\" \"Yeah,\" said Becca, \"You see, it's a long story, but somehow I ended up getting separated from my class during a field trip, and now I have to help save Libralia from Malaria's curse – until a person named Bethylasia arrives. Then, she will finish the quest!\" \"Bethylasia?\" gasped Horror; he started to think about whether or not he should accompany Becca and her friends on this seemingly scary and dangerous journey. \"You can do it,\" said Sci Fi. \"Okay,\" said Horror. He held out his hand to Becca. \"Friends?\" he said. Becca just gulped and wondered if she should take Horror along; after all, she thought he was kind of adorable. Just the, a spider crawled on top of Horror's hand! He grabbed it with his other hand, and squashed it. Becca then put her hand down to Horror's as he held it. \"It's a deal,\" she said, \"You may come with us!\" The woodchuck then led the group into the house of Victor Frankenstein. Unknown to them, however, Malaria's ghost minions had snuck into the bell tower, and were now travelling under the roof! Soon, they would give their mistress a helping hand in getting rid who she thought was Bethylasia…[Chapter 11] Chapter 10 - Dr. Frankenstein Inside the house, everything was very dark and quiet. A fireplace housed a dying fire, lonely tables and chairs had white sheets covering them, and in the corner, there was a mysterious door. Becca wondered where that door would lead. \"Hello?\" she called. There was no answer. The girl and her friends stepped inside. \"Anyone home?\" called Sci Fi. The open door suddenly closed behind everyone! \"What was that?!\" cried Horror in alarm. \"I don't know!\" said Mystery, \"But whoever closed the door can't be far away from here!\" Just then, the mysterious door in the corner of the room opened! \"Who's there?\" called Becca, holding Sheila close to her chest. \"Only I, the master of this house,\" was the answer. In walked a man holding a lit candle. He was a tall, pale-skinned man with dark hair and hazel eyes. He was wearing a white lab coat over a white shirt, black pants and black shoes. \"Oh,\" said Fantasy, \"Excuse us, mister…\" \"Doctor,\" said the man, \"Dr. Victor Frankenstein.\" \"Well, sir,\" said Sci Fi, \"We did ring your doorbell.\" \"We're sorry for intruding,\" said Becca. \"It's all my fault!\" confessed Horror, \"I was trying to help them find the other side of the house!\" \"The other side?\" said Dr. Frankenstein, \"Follow me to my laboratory. I need a little help with an experiment.\" \"Experiment?\" repeated Becca, sounding a bit worried. \"This is something I've never shown anyone, but you and your friends may have a glimpse of what will be soon – life after death!\" Meanwhile, Horror was hearing some laughing up in the roof. He searched under a rug, and then he looked at a broken mirror, where he saw many eyes! \"AAAAAAAHHH!\" he cried, \"Not again!\" Becca shushed him and told him to relax. Dr. Frankenstein then asked Becca to hold out her finger. \"Why?\" the girl asked. \"I need a blood sample,\" replied the doctor. \"But I'm not eighteen yet,\" Becca protested. But the doctor picked up a sharp needle and struck the girl's index finger with it. Becca let out a yelp as five drops of her blood fell into a petri dish. \"Perfect!\" said Dr. Frankenstein, \"At last we are ready!\" He added Becca's blood to something on a table that was covered by a long white sheet. Next, he put two cables under the sheet on one end of the table; Becca and Sheila both had a bad feeling about this. At last, Dr. Frankenstein commanded, \"Pull the switch!\" Outside, a thunderstorm was starting just as Becca and her friends looked around for a switch; eventually, Horror found a large switch attached to the wall. \"I think he means this one, Master!\" Becca ran over to the large switch and, with all her might, pulled it down to the bottom. \"Now stand back!\" Dr. Frankenstein commanded. Everyone did as they were told. Suddenly, a bolt of lightning hit the rod on the roof outside! The electricity from the bolt carried down through the rod, and then it went through a special wire attached to the rod, where it travelled down to Dr. Frankenstein's experiment. The doctor laughed wildly and madly while Becca and her friends stood back in awe. Then, something began to move under the sheets! \"It's alive!\" whispered Dr. Frankenstein. An ugly green hand from a corpse started to move out from the sheets! \"IT'S ALIVE!\" cried Dr. Frankenstein. The creature under sheets began to moan as it slowly sat up. \"I don't like the looks of this!\" said Becca, who was now full of fear! The white sheet came off the table, and there, on the table sat what looked like a green skinned man with bolts in his neck, tattered clothing, and stitches covering his body! \"What is this?\" Sci Fi asked Dr. Frankenstein. \"May I present – life after death!\" announced the doctor. Becca then realized that this creature was the infamous monster that would eventually turn against its creator! \"RUN!\" she yelled to her friends. The girl and the animals tried running back to the door where they came in, but when they got there, they found that it was locked! The creature let out a snarl, then a growl, and then, it slowly made its way toward its master…[Chapter 12] Chapter 11 - The Monster Goes Mad Frankenstein's monster let out a terrifying groan as it began to turn on its own master! \"Please!\" cried Dr. Frankenstein, \"I am your master! Do as I say!\" The creature stopped for a moment, wonder whether or not he should harm his master or not. Instead of getting angry again, he calmed down quite a bit and smiled. \"Friend,\" it said, lending his hand out to the doctor. \"That's right,\" said Dr. Frankenstein, \"No harm.\" Meanwhile, outside the laboratory, Malaria's ghost minions were laughing as they toyed around with the door key; they were the ones who locked Becca and her friends in the lab! \"Now let's have some more fun!\" said one of the ghosts. It got out a box of matches and said to his comrades, \"Outside! Up to the roof!\" The other ghosts laughed with content and they made their way to a wall, went through it, and flew up to the top of the house's rooftop. One of the ghosts lit a match, and set it down on the roof, where it began to burn! Back in the lab, Frankenstein's monster was just getting ready to help his master, when suddenly, he smelled smoke! The monster let out a big roar and yelled, \"FIRE! NO FIRE!\" Becca and her friends just stood there, terrified. But then, Mystery noticed a trapdoor underneath the experimenting table. \"Quick,\" he said, \"Into that trapdoor!\" Becca got down on her knees and crawled toward the trapdoor. It was quite a struggle to open the door, but she managed; however, the force of pulling the door open caused to fall back and land on her backside! The monster noticed and charged toward the girl! Horror tried to stop him by climbing onto the top of a medicine cabinet, but the cabinet was so wobbly that it toppled over! Luckily, Horror was unhurt; Becca picked him up as the group all scrambled into the trapdoor. As everyone travelled under the laboratory, Becca could hear the monster stomping around and growling above her. \"I think he's gonna follow us!\" she said, \"We have to keep going!\" Everywhere the friends went, the walls were decorated with cobwebs, spiders, and rats. \"I hate this place!\" cried Becca. Eventually, they came to another staircase that was going up. \"We have to go up!\" cried Horror, \"Oh, sanctuary! Sanctuary!\" Everyone went up the stairs. It was a long, dark and scary journey up those steps, but at last, they made it to the roof of the house! However, just when they thought they were safe, a fire was building up! \"We have to jump off!\" said Sci Fi. \"But where will we land?\" asked Becca. \"Down there!\" said Adventure, pointing towards the ground. Where he was pointing, there was a pile of snow. \"How did THAT get there?\" asked Becca. \"Maybe it snowed while we were in the house,\" suggested Mystery, \"Anyway, we should get moving!\" The fisher jumped into the pile of snow. Then, one by one, all the animals jumped into the snow pile (except Sheila, who was too little to jump). \"Well!\" shouted Sci Fi from down below, \"Come on, Becca! You can do this!\" Becca hesitated for a moment, but then she noticed the burning flames and heard the monster's voice from inside the house. \"I'll do it!\" she said. Clutching Sheila close to her chest, Becca jumped from the roof of the house and into the snow! When she got up, neither the girl nor her cat felt any pain. All the other animals cheered! Meanwhile, Malaria's ghost minions were furious that they were defeated. Quickly, they flew away to the restricted section to spread the news to their mistress. When Malaria heard the news, she became red with fury. \"This can't be!\" cried the sorceress, \"Why did the little brat and those animals have to escape?\" \"I don't know, your Excellency,\" said Eddie, \"But maybe you shouldn't be so vengeful and violent. You know, you should try poisoning her or drowning her.\" \"Eddie,\" said Malaria, \"This girl is a feisty one. Just as feisty as Bethylasia. She needs something else, something that she fears the most!\" And so, the wicked sorceress went back to her big book of spells to research another way to kill Becca.[Chapter 13] Chapter 12 - Entering the Mystery Section Meanwhile, Becca and the book animals were making their way through a snowy countryside. \"Brrrrr!\" said Adventure, \"Tis sure is colder than the Arctic!\" \"I agree,\" said Mystery, \"But something tells me we're getting close to MY section!\" \"You mean we'll be solving mysteries?\" asked Becca, with her teeth chattering from the cold. \"I think so,\" Mystery replied. \"Let's see,\" said Fantasy, tapping her wand, \"I think I'd better help you out a bit, Becca.\" She waved her wand and pointed it at Becca. In a flash, the girl was wearing a dark blue cloak around her neck to keep her warm. Sheila, who was sleeping in Becca's arms, let out a contented purr. \"Thanks, Fantasy,\" said Becca, \"I'm not so cold now!\" \"Anytime, honey,\" said Fantasy. The group walked through the snow for several minutes until they came across an English town at dawn. \"Ah, merry old London town!\" said Mystery, \"I think anytime soon we'll be meeting an old friend of mine.\" \"And who would that be?\" Sci Fi asked. \"Why, Sherlock Holmes, of course!\" replied Mystery with big enthusiasm. Sherlock Holmes was one of the most famous detective characters in the mystery fiction genre. Even though Becca never read mystery stories, she felt very relieved when she learned that she may have help if there were any challenges in the Paths of Mystery. So the girl and her animal friends travelled into the streets of London and saw Victorian and Edwardian commoners getting ready to start their day. Shops, restaurants, and bakeries were opening up their doors, carriages pulled by horses were going by on the main streets, and people were walking on sidewalks saying \"Good morning\" to each other. \"Now then,\" Mystery told Becca, \"The Street we're looking for is Baker Street. That's where Mr. Holmes and his friend Dr. Watson reside.\" \"How are we going to find Baker Street in this big place?\" Horror asked worriedly. Suddenly, everyone jumped to the sound of a policeman blowing his whistle and shouting, \"Stop! Come back here!\" A mysterious person with a dark cape ran past Becca and her friends with something clutched in his or her arms, with the policeman right behind, blowing his whistle! However, the mysterious stranger disappeared in a large crowd of shoppers before the policeman could catch him. \"Excuse me,\" Becca said to the policeman. \"Yes?\" the man said in a gruff tone of voice. \"My friends and I are looking for Baker Street. We were wondering if you could tell us how to find Mr. Sherlock Holmes.\" \"Mr. Holmes?\" said the policeman, \"You mean you're researching the case of the Blue Carbuncle, too?\" Becca was lost in words. \"Uh, yeah,\" she stammered, \"W-we are, uh, employees of the, er…\" \"Hotel that the carbuncle was stolen from!\" finished Mystery. \"Very well,\" said the policeman, \"Just turn right at the next block, and Mr. Holmes's residence will be the second apartment on the left.\" \"Thank you, sir!\" said Becca, gathering her friends together. Then, she turned to Mystery and whispered, \"And thank you for helping me out.\" The fisher just winked at her as they all made their way to Baker Street.[Chapter 14] Chapter 13 - Sherlock Holmes When Becca and the animals reached the right destination, the girl knocked on the door. A few seconds later, the door was opened by an elderly man who had a bald head white white sideburns and mustache, and was wearing a black and white suit. \"Good morning,\" he said, \"How may I help you lot?\" \"Are you Dr. Watson?\" asked Mystery. \"Why, yes!\" replied the doctor, \"What brings you here to Baker Street?\" \"We're looking for Sherlock Holmes,\" said Becca, \"Is he around?\" \"As a matter of fact, he is,\" said Dr. Watson, \"Allow me to lead you inside to me him!\" The doctor took the friends inside the apartment, where they saw a young man sitting in an armchair and smoking a pipe while reading a newspaper. \"My dear Watson,\" said the young man, \"It appears to me that we have unexpected company.\" \"Of course,\" said Dr. Watson, \"Allow me to introduce you to uh, er-\" he looked at Becca and asked, \"What is your name, miss?\" \"Becca Ridges,\" the girl replied, \"My friends and I were wondering if you could help us.\" The young man sat up from his chair and stepped forward toward Becca, introducing himself as Sherlock Holmes. Mystery cleared his throat and said, \"Well if it isn't my dear friend Mr. Holmes!\" he cried, rushing into the detective's arms to hug him. Sherlock immediately recognized the fisher as his friend. \"My dear Mystery!\" said the detective, \"What brings you and your friends here onto Baker Street?\" \"Well, sir,\" said Mystery, \"Becca is on a special quest, and I was wondering if you and Dr. Watson may be able to help us for a little while.\" \"Elementary, my dear,\" Sherlock said to Becca, \"I, too, am on a quest. Well, if you would call it a quest, but it's more of a mystery involving a carbuncle.\" \"Ewww!\" said Becca, but then she remembered her manners, \"Excuse me. It's just that-\" \"I know what you mean,\" said Holmes, \"Tis not that kind of carbuncle. It is a kind of diamond that is supposed to be owned by the Countess of Morcar; however, I have received news that it has been stolen! So Dr. Watson and I were just getting ready to set out when you came knocking on my door. Are you on the same mission, too?\" Becca thought for a while, but she was still thinking about getting home. The girl missed her mother's smile and her father's cheerful laugh already; however, her look of worry turned to determination when she said, \"It's kind of a long story, but I was on a trip with my class from school when something odd happened and I ended up here. I'm trying to get home, but maybe I could spare a little time to try and help you.\" \"Splendid!\" said Dr. Watson, \"Starting this minute, we should all head out to the hotel where the carbuncle was stolen!\" So Watson and Holmes put on their coats and grabbed their detective kit, with Becca and the animals following. Sci Fi wasn't so sure if Becca should be tagging along on something that seemed dangerous, so she whispered to Mystery, \"Are you sure you want this girl to be solving mysteries right now? I saw that she was looking a little worried about her other quest.\" \"Not to worry,\" Mystery whispered back, \"Something inside me is saying that Becca needs to pass a test here in my section.\" Sci Fi just shrugged her shoulders and kept on walking with the others. Meanwhile, Holmes signaled a cabby coachman driving a horse and carriage to stop by the street. When the coachman arrived and opened his carriage door, Holmes and Watson signaled to Becca to step in. \"Ladies first!\" said Dr. Watson. \"Why thank you,\" Becca said, curtseying a little bit. When she sat down inside, she wondered why she curtseyed to the men. Have I done this before, she thought. Her thoughts were interrupted when her new friends hopped into the carriage beside her. The coach then started moving, and the horse trotted a snappy pace to the hotel where the carbuncle was stolen.[Chapter 15] Chapter 14 - On the Case of the Blue Carbuncle About twenty minutes later, Becca, the animals, Dr. Watson and Mr. Holmes arrived at a grand inn in downtown London. \"Here we are,\" said Holmes, \"The crime scene. I only hope the countess is still here to explain everything.\" Me too, thought Becca, because the sooner we get done here, the sooner I can go home. After everyone got out of the carriage, Mr. Holmes and Dr. Watson went through the main doors to speak with the innkeeper, while Becca and the animals waited outside, because pets and other animals were forbidden inside the building. \"How are we going to get in without being spotted?\" Mystery asked Becca. The girl shrugged her shoulders and said, \"I don't know.\" \"Well, we have to think of something to help you succeed this quest!\" insisted Sci Fi. Mystery snapped his fingers and said, \"Wait a minute!\" Meanwhile, Holmes and Watson had finished speaking with the innkeeper inside the inn. They learned that the countess was still in her room, and was getting ready to leave the next day. When the two detectives came outside to check on Becca, they were surprised to find the animals gone. The girl, however, was carrying her cloak over her shoulders. There was something unusual, though; the cloak had some kind of bundle inside it. \"Might I ask what you are carrying, my dear lady?\" asked Dr. Watson. Becca motioned the doctor to come close to her ear so she could whisper. \"It's the animals,\" she whispered, \"I doubt that the innkeepers will let pets in the inn, so Mystery and I came up with a plan to have everyone hide in my cloak and be still. You know, they could be my luggage or my laundry!\" \"Excellent thinking, my dear!\" said Dr. Watson, \"And you're right – the innkeepers do not allow any kind of animals in this building.\" \"Elementary, my dear Becca,\" added Mr. Holmes, \"Shall we?\" He motioned for Becca to enter in the inn first, followed by Dr. Watson, with Holmes going inside last. Inside the inn, people were staring at Becca; she wore her skirt at a rather low level for Victorian times, and her feet and ankles were showing. The girl looked around feeling rather sheepish. Meanwhile, inside the cloak, all the animals were feeling rather crowded, being in a dark, enclosed space. They didn't dare say anything, because they didn't want to add any more suspicion. After about ten minutes of walking through hallways and stairs, Sherlock Holmes and his party came to the duchess's room. When he knocked on the door, a middle-aged woman opened it. She had fair skin, dark brown hair, sapphire blue eyes, and wore a blue and indigo dress with a blue headdress on her head. Holmes and Watson removed their hats and bowed to the woman. \"Your excellency,\" they said. Becca did a curtsey. \"Are you Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson?\" asked the woman, who was, indeed the countess. \"Yes, your grace,\" said Holmes, \"May I present a new friend of mine, Miss Becca Ridges?\" \"Your grace – I mean, your excellency,\" said Becca, \"The pleasure is mine.\" \"This friend of yours seems like an American girl, if you ask me,\" said the countess. Then she motioned for everyone to come in. In the hotel suite, Becca put her heavy cloak gently onto the carpet. \"Okay,\" she whispered to the animals, \"Stay very close and act inconspicuous! The last thing I want is for the countess to see any suspicious behavior!\" \"Why?\" asked Horror. Becca shushed him. \"And be very quiet, too!\" she added. \"Whomever are you talking to?\" the countess asked the girl. \"Eh, no one,\" lied Becca, putting her hands onto her hips. The countess just rolled her eyes and said, \"Now, about my carbuncle. It is a very rare blue diamond shaped like an oval that I have usually worn as a brooch on my neck. The carbuncle was given to me by my husband on my last birthday, and I treasure it very much. I had it with me just last night, and I put it on that dresser over there. About two hours after I went to bed, I heard a sound like breaking glass! I woke up and saw that my window was broken into, and a strange, dark figure ran over to the dresser and stole my carbuncle! I tried to stop him, but he got away!\" The countess then burst into tears and began crying. Dr. Watson put his hand on the countess's shoulder and reassured her, \"Tis all right, your excellency. Mr. Holmes and I will solve this case, I guarantee it!\" \"Yeah,\" added Becca, \"And besides, I think we, er, I saw the thief not too long ago!\" Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Watson, and the countess looked at Becca as if she had lobsters crawling out of her ears. \"What do you mean?\" asked Mr. Holmes. \"You see,\" explained Becca, \"As I was walking through town this morning, some man wearing dark clothing was running on the streets and being chased by an officer. Maybe you two men could come with me to where I saw him?\" Dr. Watson and Mr. Holmes thought for a moment. \"I don't see why not,\" said Dr. Watson, \"Besides, don't you have other business to do after helping us?\" \"Yes!\" Becca said with a smile on her face. She then went back to where her friends were staying to tell them the news. But when she looked closer, Becca saw that Sheila was missing![Chapter 16] Chapter 15: An Unexpected Heroine \"Where's Sheila?\" Becca whispered to the animals. \"I don't know, honey,\" whispered Fantasy, \"But the last time I saw her, she went that way.\" The squirrel pointed to the door to the suite, which was open! \"Oh no!\" Becca said softly, \"Sheila could be wandering around anywhere – and someone might see her!\" She got back on her feet and walked towards the men and the countess. \"Pardon me,\" said Becca, \"But I have some unexpected business to take care of. May I be excused?\" \"Of course,\" said the countess, \"You have such nice manners for an American. Maybe you'll come back to assist me with finding my carbuncle?\" \"Maybe,\" replied Becca, heading towards the door. She then motioned for her animal friends to follow her, and act inconspicuous. The girl and the animals looked down the hallway for Sheila. The kitten wasn't anywhere. They tried searching on all the floors of the hotel, but Sheila was nowhere to be seen! Down in the lobby, Becca was getting very worried until she heard a faint meow from behind her. She turned around and saw a wall that had a large hole at its bottom. \"Sheila?\" Becca wondered. She and the animals were about to look into the hole, when Horror tugged at the girl's skirt. \"Mistress, I see her!\" the woodchuck whispered. He pointed to a window, where he saw Sheila prancing on a street. Becca turned and immediately saw her kitten. \"We have to get her!\" she cried. So she and the animals ran out of the hotel's main entry door to follow Sheila. Outside, the streets and sidewalks of London were much busier than earlier in the morning; it was very hard for Becca to find a tiny kitten within a large crowd of people, horses and carriages! Down by the girl's knees, Mystery saw something and pointed. \"There's the kitten!\" he cried, \"And someone has her!\" Becca looked in Mystery's direction and was horrified by what she saw: Sheila was trapped in the arms of a man in dark clothes – and the man looked very much like the runaway criminal earlier! The girl and her friends immediately ran after the man, while people and carriages swerved and tried to move out of the way. \"STOP, THIEF!\" Becca screamed at the top of her lungs. The thief jumped over a fence, but the girl had fast reflexes, so she and her friends were able to jump over and catch up to him. Eventually, Becca caught up with the thief and pushed him to the ground. \"Where's my kitten?\" she demanded angrily. \"What kitten?\" the thief questioned in a thick Cockney accent. As if it were instinctive, Sheila carefully crawled out from the thief's grasp and over to Becca. The kitten was carrying a shiny blue object in her mouth, so the girl picked her up and gently took the object away. \"So this must be the missing carbuncle!\" Becca exclaimed. \"I think so,\" said Mystery, then he turned to the thief and said, \"Where and how did you get this carbuncle?\" \"I ain't telling you blokes!\" shouted the thief. \"TELL US!\" Sci Fi shouted with fury. \"All right!\" the thief said, getting up, \"I wanted to surprise my dear mother for Christmas by hiding a jewel in the goose dinner!\" Becca gave the animals a look of suspicion. \"This doesn't seem right,\" she whispered to them. \"But being a poor chap,\" continued the man, \"I had no pounds or shillings to afford such a thing. So I saw the closest thing, which was an open hotel window, and there was the prettiest blue thing I've ever seen. So I took it!\" Just then, two police officers, Sherlock Holmes, and Dr. Watson arrived at the scene. One officer asked, \"All right, what's going on here?\" \"Never mind what's going on!\" said Mr. Holmes, \"This girl is a hero!\" The detective made his way over to Becca and took her hand. \"Elementary, my dear, you've caught what appears to be the carbuncle thief!\" said Holmes. \"Well, actually,\" said Becca, \"He was after my-\" Her sentence was cut off when the second police officer said, \"Good show, Mr. Holmes! Another criminal has been caught, thanks to your new friend!\" Meanwhile, Fantasy and Sci Fi motioned for Becca to walk away slowly from the action. The girl did as she was instructed and gathered all her friends. They ran through the streets of London until they came to a meadow away from the bustle and action. \"Good riddance!\" scoffed Adventure, \"I've never cared for the stench of old London, anyway!\" \"I most certainly agree,\" said Mystery. Then he turned to Becca and said, \"Excellent job, my dear! If it weren't for you, that thief would have never been caught!\" The girl only blushed a little and said, \"I wonder what will happen next?\" \"I can't exactly say what happens next, because that would be a spoiler for you!\" laughed Mystery, \"But unless you've read that story…\" \"I haven't,\" Becca said with a smile, \"So maybe I'll look for it back in the real world.\" \"Speaking of worlds,\" added Sci Fi as she cleaned her glasses with her tail, \"I doubt that we're far away from my section – the Dimension of Science Fiction! Just follow me, and we'll be there in no time!\"[Chapter 17] Chapter 16 - Sci Fi's Tour Science Fiction headed to the left side of Becca, and everyone else followed her. Slowly, the meadow began to change into a place filled with neon colors, an open sky, and shooting stars. One large star flew towards the ground, and close to the party! Sci Fi hopped onto that very star and said, \"Come on, everyone!\" Becca and the other animals followed her lead. After everyone was aboard, the star began to levitate off the ground and up into the sky. \"Where are we going?\" Becca asked. \"Into the atmosphere!\" said Sci Fi. As they went higher into the sky, Sci Fi began to sing: I can show you a world, Shining, shimmering, splendid! Tell me, Becca, now when did You last let your heart decide? The star stopped by a cloud. Sci Fi stepped onto the cloud, and didn't fall through! As she motioned for everyone to follow her, she kept singing: I can open your eyes, Take you wonder by wonder, Over, sideways, and under On an atmospheric ride! Everyone ran and skipped around on the cloud, having the time of their lives! Sci Fi: A whole new world, A new, fantastic point of view! No one to tell us no, Or where to go, Or say we're only dreaming! Becca: A whole new world! A dazzling place I never knew, But when I'm way up here, It's crystal clear, That now I'm in a whole new world with you! Mystery: Now I'm in a whole new world with you! The sky was getting dark when another shooting star came to the cloud that Becca and the animals were on. Sci Fi hopped onto the star, and then had everyone else get on, too. When the whole party was aboard, the star began to float slowly, but then it picked up speed and took everyone on a ride of excitement! Becca: Unbelievable sights! Indescribable feeling! Soaring, tumbling, free-wheeling, Through an endless diamond sky! A whole new world! Fantasy: Don't you dare close your eyes! Becca: A hundred thousand things to see! Sci Fi: Hold your breath, it gets better! The star holding the group darted right into the Northern Lights, and Becca held her hand up against the bright colors! Then, the star kept going around the universe. Becca: I'm like this shooting star, I've come so far! I can't go back to where I used to be! Mystery: A whole new world! Becca: Every turn, a surprise! Mystery: With new horizons to pursue! Becca: Every moment gets better! All: I'll chase them anywhere! There's time to spare! Let me share this whole new world with you! The group flew by a planet inhabited by friendly aliens. The aliens waved hello to the travelers before Becca and the animals made their way back to Earth. Sci Fi: A whole new world! Mystery: A whole new world! Fantasy: That's where we'll be! Horror: A thrilling chase! Becca: A wondrous place! All: For you and me! The shooting star slowed down upon entering Earth's atmosphere, and then made its way towards the ground. When they landed, Becca and the animals found themselves on a green plain with strange-looking trees and odd marble structures. \"Sci Fi, do you know where we are?\" Becca asked. The marten looked around a bit and said, \"I think we may be in a certain novel by H.G. Wells about time travel.\" \" The Time Machine ?\" asked the girl. Sci Fi nodded. Suddenly, from out of the blue, a flashing yellow light appeared about ten feet away from Becca and her friends! Author's Note: The song \"A Whole New World\" belongs to Disney. No Copyright infringement needed.[Chapter 18] Chapter 17 - The Time Machine 's World The light flashed and sparks flew before all of a sudden, a strange machine appeared in the place of the disappearing light! At that moment, Becca and her friends ran to a nearby bush and hid behind it. The friends saw a young man step out of the machine. He had fair skin, golden brown hair, and hazel eyes; he also wore a white shirt, a dark green vest with a matching tie, a brown jacket and slacks, and black shoes. \"Where am I?\" the man asked himself as he looked around. Everywhere he looked, there were trees that looked as if they were made from stone or metal instead of wood; the sky above was also a pale purple color with streams of white clouds. Meanwhile, Becca and the animals tried to stay absolutely quiet. \"It must be another mad scientist,\" whispered Horror nervously, \"Oh, I hope he doesn't have any more experiments or monsters! Sanctuary, sanctuary!\" Sci Fi softly shushed him and whispered, \"This guy's a scientist, alright. But I don't think it's what he's brought with him that we have to worry about – it's what's in this time period that I'm concerned about!\" \"What do you mean?\" Becca asked. \"No time to explain!\" whispered Sci Fi, \"They're coming!\" She motioned for everyone to stay low and keep silent. Becca had many questions to ask Sci Fi, but she knew better to keep her mouth shut. In the meantime, the Time Traveler heard strange and scary noises, so he decided to hide behind a marble statue and study the sound source in secrecy as it came near! Out of nowhere came little people with pale skin, white hair, and blue eyes. They also wore cream-colored tunics and gold sandals as they walked along, looking for any nearby danger. Then they spoke in a strange language, unlike any Becca had ever heard; the little people then moved on their way, but one of them stayed behind. That one looked like a young woman, and she wandered down the hill and disappeared; the Time Traveler decided to follow her while Becca and the animals kept watching silently. When the coast was clear, Becca asked Sci Fi, \"Who are those people? Do you know?\" \"Those are the Eloi people from the year 802,701, A.D,\" answered the marten, \"They are gentle descendants of humans who live in fancy, futuristic structures, and they only eat fruit.\" \"So they're kind of like monkeys or chimps?\" Becca wondered. \"Almost. They usually avoid conflict, and they don't eat insects.\" Becca giggled at the last part, but then she heard a squeal from the hill! \"Someone's in trouble!\" she said, \"I should go check it out!\" So the girl got on her feet and ran out from the behind the bush. However, Sci Fi tried to stop her by saying, \"Wait! Becca, I forgot to warn you…\" But Becca had already disappeared to the nearby hill. \"What were you going to warn her about?\" asked Mystery. \"The morlocks,\" answered Sci Fi, \"They're kind of like ancient troglodytes – the polar opposite of the Eloi. They are vicious and aggressive like wolves or lions!\" \"I think we should help her!\" suggested Horror worriedly, \"Oh, sanctuary! Sanctuary!\" \"Great idea!\" said Sci Fi, \"I'm going after her!\" \"NO!\" cried Mystery, grabbing Sci Fi by the tail. \"Why not?\" the marten asked with a frown. \"Because I don't want you to become venison stew with those creatures – if they're out there,\" replied the fisher, \"I care about you very much.\" Sci Fi could see a look of love in his eyes, but she ignored them and ran off to find Becca. \"Be careful, Sci Fi!\" called Fantasy. Little did anyone know that certain scary creatures were hiding not too far away… Meanwhile, on the other side of the hill, Becca saw what was happening. The Eloi woman had fallen into a raging river, and the Time Traveler was swimming to her aid. I guess she doesn't need my help, after all, thought Becca. Her thoughts were interrupted when the Time Traveler cried, \"Excuse me, Miss! I need help here!\" Becca looked around, thinking of what to do, and then she took off her glasses, put them in her skirt pocket, and dove into the river! She grabbed the Time Traveler's arm with her right hand, and then helped him and the Eloi girl to shore. Sci Fi arrived just in time to see what was going on. \"Becca, did you save their lives?\" she asked with astonishment. The girl was about to speak up when the Time Traveler said, \"Of course she did! I thought this poor creature and I were to be swept away, when I saw this other time traveler looking around, and I called for her aid. And sure enough, she saved us!\" Poor Becca was dumbfounded. She was at the wrong place, but at the right time. \"Um, I'm not really a time traveler,\" she explained, \"It's a pretty long story, but I got transported to Libralia, and I'm trying to help save this kingdom from a curse until a lost princess comes.\" The Time Traveler looked at Becca like he didn't believe her, but then his expression softened. \"So you must have been transported here as well, haven't you?\" he asked. \"In a way, kind of,\" replied the girl. Then she looked at the Eloi girl and asked, \"Is she going to be okay?\" \"Of course,\" replied Sci Fi, \"Look. She's breathing.\" It wasn't long before the Eloi girl opened her eyes and looked at the strange visitors in her land. \"Weeee-naaaahh,\" the Eloi woman said, groggily. \"I wonder if that's her name,\" said the Time Traveler, \"Weena. That's an interesting name.\" Then he looked at \"Weena\" and made movements with his hands to communicate with her. \"What are they saying?\" Becca asked Sci Fi. The marten studied the man and woman and replied, \"I think he's trying to ask her what happened, and why she ran away to the river.\" She paused with a suspicious look on her face, and then said, \"I think I know why. Morlocks!\" When Weena heard that word, she shuddered. \"What are morlocks?\" Becca asked. Suddenly, there came a menacing growl, followed by several more growls. Everyone turned around and saw large, green ape-like creatures with white fur and sharp teeth! \"Those are morlocks!\" said Sci Fi.[Chapter 19] Chapter 18 - A Battle and a Love Confession The morlocks approached the party with angry and fierce eyes that were glowing red. All Becca could do was scream; that made one of the morlocks roar a loud roar! Poor Weena helplessly pointed out the creatures while making noises that sounded just as frightened as Becca was. \"Stand back!\" Sci Fi told her friends as she ran forward, \"At my place, I'm an alien exterminator. I know what to do with these punks!\" \"Be careful, Sci Fi!\" said Becca with fear in her voice. The marten didn't listen; instead, she just darted right in front of the morlocks, and began to fight with them! Back on the hilltop, the other book animals and Sheila watched with cringes and amazement. \"What is she doing?\" wondered Fantasy. \"It looks like she's tryin' to beat those things like a wave does to a navy ship,\" said Adventure. \"I think she may need help,\" said Mystery, \"Because, well, I… love her.\" Everyone looked at the fisher with awe. \"You what?\" said Fantasy. \"Ever since I first saw her beautiful brown eyes and raven hair,\" said Mystery, \"I admired her. Even if she seems tough and serious, I think she's the kind of girl for me. That's why I'm going to help her!\" And with that, Mystery ran down the hill to help Sci Fi confront the morlocks. Down below, Sci Fi bit one morlock hard on the leg, making it scream in pain; just then, another morlock grabbed the marten by the tail and threw her towards the hill's slope! After she fell, Sci Fi struggled to get up, but two morlocks surrounded her. That didn't stop her, though, because she regained composure and jumped into one of the creatures' face and clawed and bit around its cheeks! Becca, the Time Traveler, and Weena cringed as they watched the sight. Suddenly, Mystery appeared and jumped onto one of the morlocks, biting it on the neck! The morlock turned around and growled at the fisher. Sci Fi became distracted, and gasped when she saw Mystery fighting the morlocks, too. \"Mystery?\" she said softly. Unfortunately, one of the morlocks she was fighting subdued her by grabbing her by the waist, roaring a monstrous roar at her, and throwing her to the ground. Meanwhile, Mystery fought with all his might to defeat the morlocks, but the creatures were all too much for him, too! While watching her friends fight the morlocks, Becca began to think a bit. She remembered the horrific day when she lost Nicole, and couldn't do anything to save her. This made her not only afraid, but also gave her a deep and terrible fury. Almost immediately, Becca screamed and charged towards the morlocks! She grabbed one of them by the neck, and pushed it to the ground. Next, she kicked another morlock in the rear with her foot, making it wince in pain. Finally, Becca picked up a large stick that was nearby, and whacked two more morlocks on the heads with the stick. \"YOU LEAVE MY FRIENDS ALONE, YOU MONSTROUS APES!\" the girl screamed while she beat the creatures. Eventually, the morlocks whimpered and ran away, because they knew that Becca was too much for them. When the morlocks disappeared, Adventure, Fantasy, Horror and Sheila ran down the hill to check to see if anyone was hurt. Becca didn't have any cuts or bruises, Mystery only had one scrape on his back, and Sci Fi – well, she was hurt pretty badly. \"Is your friend okay, Miss?\" the Time Traveler asked Becca. \"I don't know,\" replied the auburn-haired girl, running to her friend. Sci Fi moaned and looked up at Becca, saying, \"You and Mystery just saved my life.\" \"Of course,\" said Mystery, \"I care about you, Sci Fi.\" He then blushed red and stammered, \"In fact, I-I… love you.\" Sci Fi's eyes lit up and she asked, \"You do?\" Becca smiled and said, \"He's your friend, and he would do anything to help you, Sci Fi. In the meantime, I think I should help you.\" The Time Traveler and Weena saw Sci Fi's plight and they both walked up to her. Weena reached into her tunic pocket and pulled out a small, transparent bag containing herbs. The Eloi girl gave the bag to Becca, who sniffed it and said, \"Willow bark! That's perfect for helping with pain.\" The Time Traveler then reached into his coat pocket and got a small pouch with first aid items. He gave the pouch to Becca, who opened it and found a canteen of wine to disinfect Sci Fi's gash on her back, along with some bandages to dress her wound. After Becca tended the marten's wound, Sci Fi said, \"Thank you, sweetheart. You know, you showed a lot of courage battling those morlocks.\" \"I did,\" said the auburn-haired girl proudly, \"Watching those meanies beat you up reminded me of a bear attack, and I had to help.\" Her smile turned upside-down when she thought of the terrible day when Nicole died. \"What's wrong?\" Sci Fi asked before chewing on some willow bark. Becca shook her head and said, \"Nothing.\" Weena made a sympathetic noise and gave Becca a little hug. \"It looks like my new friend thanks you, too,\" said the Time Traveler, \"I know that I thank you, too. Now I'd better keep exploring this futuristic world with Weena if you don't mind.\" Becca began to smile and said, \"Not at all. In fact, I think my friends and I should get going. I have to save this book kingdom from a curse until a lost princess comes!\" \"She's right,\" said Adventure, \"I think I know where to go next!\" After waving goodbye to the Time Traveler and Weena, Becca and the animals kept on travelling through the Science Fiction section until they could smell an ocean nearby. \"Ahhhh,\" said Adventure, \"Breathe in the salty air, for the Isle of Adventure is near!\" Becca smiled a big smile as she hugged Sheila and Sci Fi in her arms, because she knew that she was another step closer to finishing her quest![Chapter 20] Chapter 19 - Malaria's Next Scheme Back in the Restricted Section, Malaria was up in her castle, still pondering for a way to kill Becca and strengthen her curse. Suddenly, Eddie, who was looking at his mistress's crystal ball said, \"Malaria! Come look at this!\" Malaria rushed over and asked, \"What is it?\" \"It looks like Bethylasia and her friends have gotten past the Mystery and Sci Fi sections without any trouble!\" answered Eddie with enthusiasm, \"Except for fighting those thieves and morlocks, of course!\" Malaria groaned and said, \"WHY?! Why must passing these kinds of tests be so easy for the little brat?! But just you wait, Eddie. My precious amulet around my neck will give me answers!\" She then waved her fingers over the purple pendant on her necklace, and smoke arose from the stone. \"Spirit of my magic necklace,\" said Malaria, \"I command you give me answers! What other ways do you know of destroying Bethylasia?\" The smoke formed into a large purple ghost with black eyes. \"Powerful Malaria,\" it said, \"Must you disturb me from my nocturnal bliss again? You do know that there is a price you pay for using my magic, right?\" Malaria looked at her hand, and saw that it was slowly wrinkling. Over the years, her magic kept her looking young, but every time she called upon the ghost in her necklace, she had to give up some of her youth to get more dark magic. \"I understand, spirit,\" said Malaria as she looked back up at the ghost, \"But I insist that I have just a little more so I can do away with my cousin's granddaughter. She is a threat to my plot of destroying literature and happiness!\" The ghost waved his cloudy fingers in the air, and then purple and black smoke and sparkles appeared, scattering all over the room. \"Now, Malaria,\" the ghost finished, \"I want you to promise that you will use this magic wisely. If you do, I will restore your youth. But if not, the next time you call upon me will be the last! Good day!\" With that, the ghost disappeared in thin air. The evil sorceress then looked at her crystal ball and ordered, \"Show me that girl and the animals!\" The crystal ball gave an image of Becca and her animal friends in the Isle of Adventure, preparing to ride a small boat in the ocean. \"So, you're in the Isle of Adventure, eh?\" said Malaria to Becca's image, \"There are wicked demons all around when it comes to these kinds of stories! And as your little beaver friend probably knows, not all sharks or killer whales are in the water. I shall send some company upon the sea to subdue you and your friends!\" After the image disappeared, Malaria called for her ghost minions, and ordered them to travel to the Isle of Adventure. \"Yes, most powerful sorceress!\" saluted one ghost. \"We'll see to it that Bethylasia never breaks your curse, my lady!\" said another ghost. \"Excellent!\" said Malaria. Her evil smile turned into a frown as she added, \"But do NOT fail me like you did in the Horror section! Understand?\" The ghosts all saluted like soldiers and shouted, \"YES, MA'AM!\" \"Now go out there and stop that little brat!\" Malaria ordered as she pointed her finger to an open window. Once again, the ghosts moaned and laughed as they flew off to the Adventure section to do their mistress's bidding…[Chapter 21] Chapter 20 - Stormy Seas and Pirates In the Adventure section, Becca and her friends had just finished launching a boat out to sea. \"Oh, I don't feel confident about this boat, mistress,\" Horror said with worry, \"What if we spring a leak, or meet hungry sharks? I can't stand the thought of either of them!\" With those words, he hid his face into the front of Becca's skirt. \"It's okay, Horror,\" said Becca as she knelt down and comforted the woodchuck, \"I've been on boats lots of times. I don't think anything like leaks or sharks will happen! I hope.\" \"If anything does,\" added Sci Fi with a sly grin, \"I can help us – in my time period, I travel a lot by airplane and flying saucer!\" \"Not to mention stars!\" Fantasy added. \"All right, ye mermaids!\" said Adventure with impatience in his voice, \"That's enough chit-chat! Let's get this boat a-movin' if the curse is ever going to be broken!\" \"Right,\" said Becca as she helped her animal friends into the boat. She looked out at the open water for a moment and wondered. I think I may have actually been here before, she thought, It's just that I can't really remember. Mystery saw Becca trapped in a train of thoughts, and asked her, \"Um, Becca, darling, is something wrong?\" Becca shook her head and said, \"Um, no! It's just that I vaguely remember this part of the library. I think I dreamed one time about travelling through all the different sections of this place with someone - an old man to be exact… But that's just crazy! Why would I be travelling here with a total stranger?\" Meanwhile, Sci Fi, who had been eavesdropping, gasped and turned her head away from the rest of her friends. She knew that there was something about Becca all along – she may have actually been Bethylasia this whole time and never even knew it! After a few minutes, Becca took up an oar that was in the boat, and began pushing the water along with it. \"Here we go!\" she said with enthusiasm, \"Off on another merry adventure!\" She looked at Adventure with a big smile, and the beaver smiled back. Unknown to anyone, the sunny skies were turning dark, and several purple ghosts were travelling up in the air, looking for trouble. It wasn't long before they came to a scary-looking ship that had a black flag with a skull and crossbones. A ruthless pirate captain named Long John Silver looked up and saw the ghosts. \"Well, if it ain't a message from that sea dragon in the Restricted section!\" he beamed. The ghosts came down to see Silver and whispered something in his ear. \"She is?\" said the pirate captain, \"Well, she'll be in for a big surprise!\" He then laughed a wicked laugh as the ghosts floated away. Back in their little rowboat, Becca and the animals kept happily sailing along when Sheila meowed a very frightened meow. \"Sheila, what is it?\" Becca asked the kitten. The girl looked up and was shocked by what she saw – dark clouds were forming high above in the sky! Just then, raindrops began to fall all around. \"Oh no!\" cried Becca, \"We've got a storm coming!\" \"This can't be!\" added Fantasy, \"This whole rowboat's gonna fill up with water, and we're gonna sink!\" \"Or we could get caught in a massive wave and go down that way!\" added Adventure. \"Either way,\" said Mystery, \"I don't like the sounds of those kinds of deaths!\" \"Me neither!\" cried Becca. Suddenly, a large wave appeared and crashed down on top of the party's boat! Becca felt herself fall into the water, and held however much air in her mouth as she could hold. Since she couldn't see any of her friends anywhere, the poor girl had no choice but to swim to the surface and save herself! Upon reaching the surface, Becca swam over to a large piece of wood leftover from the broken boat and climbed onto it. \"WHERE IS EVERYONE?!\" she yelled. For a while, there was no answer; but then, a faint meow came into Becca's ears. She looked down and saw Sheila struggling for life in the water. Carefully, the girl pulled the kitten aboard and held her in her lap. Then, two more figures gasped for air. One of them turned out to be Adventure, and the other one Sci Fi. \"Adventure! Sci Fi!\" Becca cried happily as she helped them onto the board, \"You guys are okay!\" \"Of course we are!\" coughed Sci Fi, \"It's that damn wave and rainstorm that caused the trouble!\" \"Well, I've seen worse!\" added Adventure. He then looked at a worried Becca and asked her, \"What's wrong, lass?\" \"Where's Mystery? And Horror and Fantasy?\" the girl asked. \"Oh, I don't know,\" answered Sci Fi, \"They may have…\" she stopped speaking, because she could feel a lump in her throat. \"They may have what?\" Becca asked as her eyes became moist. Adventure removed the bandana from his head and said, \"They may be sleeping with the fishes by now.\" Poor Becca knew what her friends meant, so she put her head above her knees and wrapped her arms around herself. Sheila meowed in sympathy as her human friend started crying. Sci Fi began to cry, too, because Fantasy was her best friend, and the marten secretly loved Mystery. Adventure put his paw on Sci Fi's shoulder for comfort while Becca looked up and said, \"They can't be dead! They have to be out there somewhere!\" She then called out, \"MYSTERY! FANTASY! HORROR!\" \"Becca, honey, it's no use,\" comforted Sci Fi, \"I'm sure they're all in a better place now. I'm sure… they're… happy now!\" At the last sentence, Sci Fi tried to comfort her friend, but she couldn't – she had to continue crying. \"Maybe someone will help us,\" said Becca as she calmed down a bit. Then she noticed a large ship in the distance; her face lit up as she cried, \"Maybe these guys can help us!\" Adventure also saw the ship and became nervous. \"I don't know, lassie,\" he said as he put his bandana back on, \"Just remember that not all sharks or killer whales are in the water!\" \"He's right,\" added Sci Fi, \"There's something about this ship that I don't trust.\" And she was right. As the ship came closer, a familiar black flag with a skull and crossbones came into view on top of the mast. On the pirate ship, two dark-skinned pirates climbed into a lifeboat, and then made their way down to see the lost friends. \"Looks like we've got ourselves a mermaid and her animal friends!\" said one pirate. \"Those animals would do fine to become either snacks or fur hats,\" added the other one, \"And the girl would make a fine present for our captain!\" So the pirates rowed their boat to Becca and the animals, and then they snatched them! \"Ugh, what are you guys doing?\" Becca asked them with disgust. \"You wanted help, didn't ye?\" The first pirate asked, \"Well, ye've come to the right place!\" \"Today's the captain's birthday, and we're going to Treasure Island to celebrate!\" added the second pirate, \"But first, we must present him his gifts!\" \"Gifts?!\" scoffed Sci Fi, \"What do you mean by 'gifts?'\" \"I think he means us,\" whispered Becca. The pirates then took their prisoners back to their ship, where the lifeboat was hauled up, and the poor girl and animals were given a not-so-warm welcome! A ruthless pirate named Tom Morgan came up to the girl and said, \"Well, look here! Looks like we have a beautiful sea flower. I think she'll make a great gift!\" \"Shhh!\" shushed a fat pirate named George Merry, \"Here comes the captain! We have to hide these sea-dogs!\" The pirates all surrounded their prisoners as Captain Long John Silver, the infamous captain from Treasure Island , approached his crew. \"All right, ye sea dogs!\" he boomed, \"What are ye doin' now?\" The pirates all jumped out of their circle and cried, \"Surprise! Happy Birthday, Captain!\" \"We found these salties floatin' beside our boat,\" said one of the dark-skinned pirates, \"And we thought that the animals would all make great snacks, and the girl would make an excellent gift for a man like you!\" \"I will NOT!\" screamed Becca, \"Let me and my friends go!\" \"Be silent!\" ordered Tom Morgan, \"Or else YE'LL be the one who will make a good snack!\" \"You heard the lost princess!\" yelled Sci Fi, \"You either let us go or die!\" Suddenly, she put her paws over her mouth, not believing what she just blurted out! Becca looked at her in disbelief. \"I'll explain later,\" whispered Sci Fi. Silver looked at the marten and said, \"Oh, we have a feisty sea otter, eh?\" \"Awk! Sea otter!\" repeated Silver's parrot that was perched on his shoulder. Sci Fi growled and tried to bite the captain on his finger. However, George Merry picked her up and squeezed her in the stomach, making her struggle to get free. Adventure didn't say or do anything. He just stood beside Becca and Sheila as if to defend them. \"And what have we here?\" Silver asked the beaver. \"What ye have,\" answered Adventure, \"Is a quartet of toughies like you – only we're the ones who are gonna leave ye weepin' home to yer mothers!\" The captain was about to kill the beaver when a voice came from the crow's nest. \"LAND HO!\" cried a pirate who was serving as lookout. All the pirates scrambled to the side of the deck and saw an island off in the distance; this wasn't just any island – it was the titular island from Robert Louis Stevenson's classic novel. \"TREASURE ISLAND!\" the pirates all cheered, \"HAPPY BIRTHDAY, DEAR CAPTAIN!\" Long John Silver just smiled, because he knew that his birthday was going great so far![Chapter 22] Chapter 21 - A Swashbuckling Fight and Letting Things Out When they reached the island, the pirates had their prisoners all tied in ropes. Poor Sheila, though, was locked in a little cage that was carried by Long John Silver. As the crew and their prisoners made their way around the island, they argued about which way to go in order to find a treasure chest. \"I'd say we should take ten steps east, six steps north, and then four steps to the west!\" suggested Tom Morgan. \"So complicated!\" argued one of the dark-skinned pirates, \"Let's go south all the way!\" \"No,\" added George Merry, \"I'd say we go three steps north, twelve steps east, and then…\" \"THAT'S ENOUGH!\" shouted Silver. \"Rawk! Enough!\" repeated the parrot. Silver got out a map of instructions and said, \"We're all going twenty steps west, three steps south, and then seven steps east!\" \"Men!\" muttered Sci Fi, \"They never ask for directions.\" \"Sci Fi,\" whispered Becca, \"Did you call me a princess on the ship?\" The marten was about to answer when the pirates ordered her and the other prisoners to follow them towards the buried treasure sight. After several steps, the pirate crew finally found a treasure chest! But when they opened it, they were shocked and surprised by the results – all the treasure was gone! \"What's this?!\" Long John Silver shouted angrily, \"No treasure?\" \"Think again, boys!\" shouted a familiar male voice from above. The pirates all became scared, and George Merry asked, \"Who said that? Are ye a ghost?!\" \"No, but they don't call me Horror for nothing!\" said another familiar voice. Becca and Sci Fi smiled when they heard what was going on; they knew now that their friends were around somewhere! Suddenly, a familiar woodchuck jumped down from a nearby palm tree, shouting, \"SANCTUARY!\" Horror kicked two pirates in the face, making some of their teeth fall out! \"Horror!\" Becca cried with excitement, \"You're okay!\" \"Of course he's okay, honey!\" came a familiar female voice. Fantasy jumped down from another palm tree, and landed on Tom Morgan's head! The pirate tried his best to capture the squirrel, but she got away and scurried to a coconut tree. Tom charged towards that tree, but Fantasy climbed up the trunk, making Tom whack himself in the head, and have coconuts fall and knock him out! Becca watched in excitement as Mystery leaped from another palm tree, and then landed and bit a dark-skinned pirate on the head! \"This will teach you a lesson or two!\" remarked the fisher with a smirk. He then ran over to Becca and the other animals, and undid the ropes that held them together. \"Fantasy, get the keys to that cage and free the kitten!\" Mystery called to Fantasy. \"Will do!\" said Fantasy with a wink. She then went over to Long John Silver and undid his belt, making his pants fall down and exposing his underwear! The squirrel found a set of keys, and then went over to Sheila's cage, where she found the right one and freed the kitten. Sheila ran into Becca's arms, and the girl cuddled her, but not before Silver snatched the kitten again! \"You and your friends leave me crew alone,\" threatened Silver, \"Or ye'll never see your precious cat again!\" Becca reached for a nearby sword and held it in front of the pirate captain. \"No!\" she shouted, \"You and your crew should leave me and my friends alone!\" Sci Fi and Mystery growled at Silver, while Adventure, Fantasy and Horror stood by with angry looks on their faces. \"Be grateful that I'm not going through a certain time of the month,\" added Sci Fi with a deadly glare, \"Or there will be blood shed!\" Silver motioned for his crew to come close to him, while he gently put Sheila down. \"All right, ye feisty mermaid,\" he said to Becca, \"I'll let you and your friends go just this once. But next time I see ye, I will have victory!\" The pirates all walked away from Becca and the animals before they went back on their ship and departed. Becca put the sword down and said to her friends with a smile, \"I did it! I actually defeated one of the meanest pirates in literature!\" \"Of course ye did!\" added Adventure, \"Ye just needed a little extra help!\" Sci Fi looked at Mystery, Fantasy and Horror with a glare and asked, \"So where did you guys go after the storm? Becca and I thought you were DEAD!\" \"Sci Fi, calm down and we'll explain everything!\" Mystery said patiently. After Sci Fi took some deep breaths, Fantasy said, \"Horror and I thought we were dead, too! But Mystery proved to be an excellent swimmer, and we swam all the way over here!\" \"You did?\" Becca asked with astonishment. \"Yep!\" said Mystery, \"Fishers are excellent swimmers, even though they don't eat fish!\" \"Speaking of which,\" said Horror with worry, \"I think we should hurry along, because I don't wanna be a woodchuck forever!\" \"I doubt you will,\" said Sci Fi, \"But you are right. The longer the curse is delayed, the more we books become animals. We'll start losing our human-like skills, and we'll resort more to the animals we have become!\" Becca looked at her friends and said, \"I guess so. But I'm so glad that Fantasy, Horror, and Mystery are okay! You guys are the only friends I've ever had in my life besides Nicole.\" All the animals became confused and looked at Becca. \"Who is Nicole, honey?\" asked Fantasy. Becca's smile dropped as she said, \"I don't think you should know.\" \"Oh, but we should!\" said Horror, \"Even if you don't wanna talk about it.\" Becca took a deep breath and said, \"Okay. Well, Nicole was my best friend from the real world. Ever since seventh grade, we have been best friends. My dad said we were like 'peas in a pod.' She always listened to my stories I told, my adventures from my dreams, and a very special dream I had when I was seven.\" Sci Fi felt her stomach churn as Becca continued, \"But then one day, things changed. I was on a hiking trip with Nicole and her parents, and she and I decided to go for a walk in the woods. Everything was going fine, but then a grizzly bear came and growled at us. We tried scaring it away, but it wouldn't budge. Then it began to attack, and I dropped to the ground and played dead. Nicole wasn't so lucky, though.\" The girl could feel sobs coming as she continued, \"When the bear was gone, Nicole was so badly injured that I ran to her parents and told them what happened. We got the paramedics to take her to the emergency room, but she lost so much blood, that she…\" Becca started crying at the last part. Horror walked up to her and nudged her with sympathy as he, too, began to cry. All the other animals bowed their heads in sympathy, and Sci Fi thought to herself for a while. \"Becca doesn't have to wait for her,\" she told herself, \"Because Becca really is… Bethylasia. I know, because of what she said of dreams and travelling with an old man – the Pagemaster.\" She then gathered herself together, and motioned for her friends to leave Becca alone for a while. Sci Fi led the other animals to behind a bush and told them, \"She's the real thing, did you know that?\" \"What are you talking about?\" Fantasy asked her. \"What I mean,\" said Sci Fi, \"Is that Becca is really Bethylasia. Remember when she told us about travelling with an old man through Libralia? And remember when she told us about a special dream? I'm telling you that she is the lost princess!\" \"Why do you say that?\" asked Horror. \"Because I remember when we were there to help her and her grandfather when Malaria's curse was just starting!\" replied Sci Fi. Adventure thought for a moment, and remembered the tragic day when Malaria killed the Pagemistress, and then turned the rest of the royal family (except Bethylasia and the Pagemaster) to stone. \"Oh, now I remember!\" he said with enthusiasm. Fantasy grinned and said, \"Me too! In fact, I don't think we're far away from my section – and I hear that the Pagemaster is at some royal ball in a palace somewhere!\" \"He is? Oh, that reminds me!\" said Mystery, picking up a nearby piece of paper. He showed it to everyone and said, \"This piece of paper says that the Pagemaster is paying fifty million pieces of gold to anyone who returns Bethylasia to him!\" Everyone glared at him as he smiled weakly. Meanwhile, Becca finished crying and was taking some deep breaths to calm herself and continue with her journey. The animals came back to her and Sheila just as the girl was getting back on her feet. \"Where to next?\" asked Becca. \"I think my section!\" said Fantasy, \"My wand feels like it's gaining a little more power. That means we're getting close to the World of Fantasy!\" \"Woo-hoo!\" cheered Becca, \"That must mean I'm one step closer to home!\" \"You sure are, sweetheart,\" said Sci Fi as she winked to herself, \"You sure are!\" So all the friends happily skipped along, making their way to the fantasy section.[Chapter 23] Chapter 22 - Whatever You Imagine Back in the restricted section, Malaria was moaning and groaning over her plan being ruined again! \"No, no, no, NO!\" the sorceress screamed as she smashed some nearby objects, \"Why does that little brat have to win again?!\" \"Gee, I don't know,\" said Eddie with a worried face, \"Maybe she's just trying to show off to her friends about how brave she thinks she is.\" \"I don't think that's the answer,\" said Malaria as she calmed down a bit, \"I think what's going on is that this girl is smarter than I thought she was. I might know what to do, but I'm not sure. I'd better talk to my necklace's spirit again and apologize!\" So she waved her fingers over her necklace pendant and said, \"Oh, spirit of my magic necklace, I ask you for forgiveness. I have misused your help, but I still seek your advice!\" Just then, the ghost from her necklace appeared! \"Oh, Malaria, you useless snail!\" he insulted, \"Why must you disturb me again?\" \"Please, great spirit,\" begged Malaria, \"I apologize for screwing up again. I just want another answer!\" \"To what?\" the spirit asked as he looked at wrinkles around Malaria's eyes. \"I just want you to tell me how to kill Bethylasia!\" Malaria cried. The ghost laughed and said, \"YOU?! Needing help to kill someone?! If you could kill the Pagemistress easily, I don't see any difficulty in killing your cousin's youngest granddaughter!\" Malaria grimaced and motioned for the ghost to look inside her crystal ball. An image of Becca and her friends coming to the fantasy section appeared and Malaria said, \"Do you see this girl? She's smarter and stronger than I thought she was. She needs something that she fears the most – something very frightening!\" The spirit kept looking at Becca and recognized her. \"I know her!\" he said, \"She's a common school girl from the real world who fears dangerous animals, especially ever since her best friend was killed by a grizzly bear!\" \"Grizzly bear, huh?\" pondered Malaria, as she thought a bit, \"Spirit, I need some advice on how to include a brown bear in the World of Fantasy.\" \"I'm afraid you can't do that!\" said the spirit, \"But I can give you advice. However, this is the LAST time I'm helping you. Got that?\" \"Yes.\" \"Very well,\" continued the ghost, \"In order to kill this girl with a bear, you'll have to meet her in person, and then turn into a bear!\" Malaria was dumbfounded. \"That seems utterly impossible!\" she argued, \"I can't just appear out of nowhere and…\" \"That's the point!\" said the ghost, \"You have to wait until the right time to kill her. You wanted help, didn't you, so this is the advice I'm giving you. Good day!\" With that, the ghost disappeared into thin air. After the spirit left, Malaria told Eddie, \"It's time to go! We're going to the fantasy section, and stay in hiding until the time is right!\" \"But your Excellency,\" protested Eddie, \"What about the animal friends and the characters from fairy tales? Won't they see you and report you?\" \"Of course not!\" insisted his mistress, \"We'll change ourselves into an inanimate object, and we'll wait – just wait!\" She then picked up a ball full of glitter, and then threw it on the ground while Eddie picked up his suitcase. Then the raven and sorceress disappeared under a cloud of glitter and smoke! Meanwhile, in the World of Fantasy, Becca looked all around in amazement. She had never seen so many magical things in person; she only saw them in pictures within her favorite books. Fairies played among flowers, a pan played his panpipes, and sparkles appeared everywhere! As they travelled, a voice began to sing: Whatever you imagine Can one day come to be There are dreams to awaken Roads to be taken Follow them and they will set you free! Becca saw Mother Goose fly through the sky on her gander, and waved to her. The nursey rhyme mistress waved back before some mice appeared beside Adventure. A fairy waved her wand, and the mice turned into horses, just like in Cinderella ! Whatever you imagine Is where your heart can go There are worlds filled with treasure Time without measure To learn whatever you may need to know! Becca saw the seven dwarfs climbing a far-off hill, and then she saw a cow jumping over the moon! She and Horror both laughed at the sight. Imagine, And you and I can fly past the sun And leave all our doubts and fears behind us! You'll see that's just what can happen If you look inside your mind! Some sparkling pixies appeared, and landed in Becca's hands. They danced and performed a show for the girl as she smiled. There's no limit to The wonders you can find! Whatever you imagine Can make your life brand new There are miracles waiting So keep concentrating And I promise that if you do Whatever you imagine can come true! (Whatever you imagine) The pixies then got mischievous and decided to take away Becca, Fantasy, Sci Fi and Mystery's glasses! \"Hey!\" Becca laughed, \"Give me back my glasses!\" Fantasy and Mystery happily played along, but Sci Fi got aggressive with the pixies and chased after them! \"Clam down, Sci Fi, it's just a game!\" giggled Fantasy. As everyone followed the pixies, Humpty Dumpty waved at the group, only to fall off his wall; Dorothy Gale followed a yellow brick road with her dog, Toto, the Scarecrow, the Tinman and the Lion; Alice followed the White Rabbit; and Rapunzel let her long, golden hair down out of her tower window. Whatever you imagine Can make your life brand new There are miracles waiting So keep concentrating And I promise you Whatever you imagine will come true! A few minutes later, the sky was getting dark. Becca and her friends caught up with the mischievous pixies and retrieved the glasses. After placing her own glasses back on, Becca looked off in the distance and saw a grand palace, along with some fireworks being shot in the sky. \"Looks like a grand party is going on there!\" she gasped. \"Not just any party,\" said Fantasy, \"That's the Pagemaster's annual party to celebrate the day he was coroneted as the ruler of Libralia!\" \"You know what?\" Becca said with a sad smile, \"I think I'm ready to go home. I should tell the Pagemaster that I've done my part of the quest, and Bethylasia can do the rest.\" \"Are you sure?\" Sci Fi asked with concern, \"You could check us out in the real world, or go to that party.\" Becca thought for a moment and said, \"I don't think that party would be too bad. Maybe I could spend a little extra time here and go to a grand ball for the first time?\" She was just about to run to the castle, but Fantasy stopped her. \"Wait a minute, honey!\" said the squirrel, \"You can't go dressed like some peasant! Remember when I said I was the one who helped Cinderella? Well, we may not have a pumpkin or mice, but I can certainly change your appearance a bit.\" Becca smiled a big smile and said, \"That would be wonderful!\" \"Okay, now what's your favorite color?\" asked Fantasy. \"Hmmmm,\" said Becca, \"I kinda like dark colors – such as purple or indigo!\" \"I choose purple,\" said Fantasy, \"Now, close your eyes, honey! And don't open them till I tell you!\" Becca happily closed her eyes and Fantasy gently touched the girl with her wand. In a matter of seconds, gold sparkles flew all around the girl, and slowly, Becca's appearance transformed into something else – her hair was done in a bun, a white tiara appeared on her head, and she donned a purple gown with golden sparkles at the hem of her skirt, white elbow-length gloves, a black choker with a pearl in the center, and a pair of flat shoes made out of onyx! \"Okay, Becca, you may open your eyes now!\" said Fantasy. Becca looked down and gasped. \"It's a gorgeous dress!\" she beamed, \"In fact, it's the most beautiful dress I've ever worn – or seen in my life!\" Fantasy smiled and said, \"I'm glad you like it. But I think you should have a few chaperones to take you to the ball.\" \"What are ye talking about?\" Adventure asked with a raised brow. \"Close your eyes, and I'll show you!\" said Fantasy. All the other animals (except Sheila) closed their eyes, and Fantasy touched each of her friends with her wand before using the wand on herself. In just a few minutes, the animals all became humans. Fantasy turned into an African American woman with magenta-dyed hair tied in a large bun and lavender eyes; she wore a lavender dress with puffy sleeves, pink motifs on her bodice and skirt, a pearl necklace and matching earrings, and hot pink wrist gloves. Adventure turned into a man with light skin, brown hair with a matching mustache, and brown eyes; he wore a white dress shirt, a black captain's jacket with a matching cravat, breeches and a tri-pointed hat with a white feather, gold epaulets, a gray vest, white gloves with a matching belt and stockings, and black shoes with gold buckles. Horror turned into a man with light skin and blue hair while keeping his heterochromia; he wore a white shirt with a matching vest and stockings, a light blue cravat, a blue and black jacket, black trousers, and gray shoes with gold buckles. Science Fiction turned into a woman with light skin, while keeping her black hair and brown eyes; she wore a silver Russian-style court gown with long, split sleeves, a red sash, white gloves, a pearl necklace, diamond earrings, and a silver tiara. Mystery turned into a man with light skin while keeping his mahogany hair and green eyes; he wore a white dress shirt with a matching vest, a black and white jacket with gold epaulets, a gold and white belt, gray slacks, and black boots. Becca looked at her friends with a speechless look and said, \"Wow! You guys look amazing!\" Everyone opened their eyes and looked at each other with amazement, complimenting on how gorgeous they looked. Horror's voice had also changed into that of a handsome man's, asking, \"Are we ready for the ball, mistress?\" Becca smiled and replied, \"I think so. Come on, Sheila.\" The little kitten hopped into her mistress's arms, and everyone walked towards the palace.[Chapter 24] Chapter 23: At the Ball A few minutes later, Becca and her friends made it to the entrance of the palace. \"Oh, Becca, I forgot to tell you!\" said Fantasy, \"My magic only works until the last stroke of midnight.\" \"Like in Cinderella ?\" asked Becca. \"Mm-hmm,\" said Fantasy. She looked at Sheila and added, \"I also think it would be best for your kitty to stay outside and not get into trouble.\" The girl looked at her kitten and said, \"Okay. I think it's for the best that you stay out here, Sheila. Just don't wander away too far.\" With that, she set Sheila down in a little flower bed to play in. Upon entering the palace, all the guests stopped what they were doing and looked at Becca. They were amazed by her beautiful gown, and they whispered questions like, \"Who is she?\" \"Where did she come from?\" \"Do you suppose she is a princess?\" \"Is she the lost princess?\" Sci Fi saw what was going on and whispered to Becca, \"Just ignore them. You're doing fine!\" Becca continued walking, and everyone became more confident about her. Mystery then pointed to a golden balcony above the ballroom and whispered, \"There he is! The Pagemaster!\" Becca looked up and saw the old wizard happily looking down at his grand ball. \"I hope he'll listen to me,\" the girl prayed. Just then, the music conductor played some music. Everyone in the ballroom gathered around, picked partners, and began to dance. \"I think we should be dancing,\" said Fantasy, who teamed up with Adventure. \"How would you like to get hooked on a good book?\" she asked him. Adventure only blushed deep red. Mystery looked at Sci Fi, gently took her hand, and asked, \"May I have this dance?\" Sci Fi smiled and said, \"Of course!\" While the two pairs danced, Becca looked at Horror and asked, \"Would you like to dance with me?\" Horror couldn't believe his ears! \"Dance?\" he asked nervously, \"With you?\" Becca smiled and took Horror's hand. \"Here, I'll help you,\" she said convincingly. She put his left hand behind her waist and his right hand into her left hand. Becca began to dance slowly, and Horror picked up on the steps; then he decided to take the lead. Sci Fi looked over her shoulder and saw Becca dancing with Horror. \"Look at that,\" she said to Mystery with a smile, \"It's Beauty and the Beast !\" Mystery chuckled and beamed when he saw the two. At around eleven o'clock, the dancing ended, and everyone went about at engaging in conversations, drinking wine, and enjoying little hors d'oeuvres at the refreshment table. Sci Fi walked up to Becca and gently put her hand on the teen girl's shoulder before asking, \"Are you ready?\" \"For what?\" Becca asked. \"You know, to meet the Pagemaster and tell him that Bethylasia can finish breaking the curse!\" \"Oh yeah,\" Becca remembered, \"I think so.\" Sci Fi then motioned for Adventure, Fantasy, Horror and Mystery to gather around and follow her. Everyone went up a grand staircase, and came to a set of large, red doors. \"Sci Fi,\" said Fantasy, \"I don't think that meeting the Pagemaster will be easy.\" \"What do you mean?\" asked Sci Fi with a raised brow. \"Well, the Pagemaster probably doesn't wanna see just any girl right now,\" remarked Fantasy, \"I think he just wants to see his granddaughter herself!\" Sci Fi whispered to Fantasy in an annoyed tone, \"Don't you remember? Becca IS Bethylasia! The Pagemaster will have to see her!\" Science Fiction walked over to Becca and told her, \"I'll tell you what – Mystery and I will go behind those doors and make the Pagemaster think you're Bethylasia, that way, he can talk to you easily!\" \"Guys, whatever you're planning sounds like it won't work,\" said Becca. She sighed and continued, \"I've met this guy before, and he seems like a nice man.\" \"He is,\" said Mystery, \"But I promise – we won't let you down. We'll make sure you get back to your own world, and we'll find the lost princess on our own!\" \"And you can also check us out, too!\" added Horror. Becca thought for a moment and then nodded. \"Alright,\" she said, \"But I hope we get this over with soon. My parents are probably calling the cops by now!\" Sci Fi gently shushed her and coaxed, \"Don't worry. Your parents will be fine. Mystery and I will just try to talk to the Pagemaster, and everything will work out.\" The girl smiled a small and sad smile as Sci Fi and Mystery prepared to go behind the red doors. The others just stayed behind. Mystery and Sci Fi knocked on one of the doors, opened it, and then went in. But instead of closing the door all the way, they left it open a small crack. Mystery cleared his throat and announced, \"We would like to announce to the Pagemaster that we have found his long-lost granddaughter, Princess Bethylasia! She is waiting outside the door to speak to him.\" A servant walked up to the couple and said with an apologetic tone, \"I'm sorry, you two, but the Pagemaster will not see anyone.\" \"What?\" Sci Fi said with shock. The Pagemaster, who was sitting in his balcony, angrily called the servant, \"You can tell that impertinent couple that I've seen enough Princess Bethylasias to last me an eternity!\" Over the past several years, The Pagemaster offered a huge reward to anyone who could find Bethylasia and bring her to him to end Malaria's curse. However, all the hundreds of people who brought the \"princess\" were really con artists who searched far and wide for Bethylasia imposters. The wizard believed that Mystery and Sci Fi were another couple of con artists looking for money, and refused to see them. Meanwhile, the servant wearily told the couple, \"I think you two should go.\" Mystery started, \"But you see…\" \"Now if you'll excuse me,\" interrupted the Pagemaster, \"I wish to continue waiting for my real granddaughter to destroy my cousin's curse in peace!\" Sci Fi tried to say something, but the servant reluctantly took her hand and Mystery's while saying, \"Come now, off you go! To the exit, please!\" Mystery motioned for Sci Fi to hide behind some curtains for a while. Then the two of them snuck out and approached the Pagemaster. \"Pagemaster, please,\" said Mystery, \"We intend you no harm. It's us – Mystery and Sci Fi, two of your book servants!\" \"Nonsense!\" scoffed the Pagemaster, \"Malaria turned all my servants into animals, not humans!\" \"But Fantasy used some of her magic to change us!\" protested Sci Fi. \"Fantasy or not,\" remarked the Pagemaster, \"I'd say you're still imposing!\" As the wizard got up from his chair, Mystery cried, \"Wait! Don't go! If you'll just listen to us, please!\" \"Haven't you two been listening?\" the Pagemaster shot at them angrily, \"I've had enough with my granddaughter for now! I don't care how much you two have fashioned this girl to look like her, sound like her, or even behave like her! In the end, it never is her!\" On the other side of the doors, Becca held her ear up to eavesdrop when she heard the shouting. When she heard the Pagemaster talking, the girl gave a look of shock and anger. Back at the balcony, Sci Fi pleaded to the Pagemaster, \"This time, she's the real thing!\" \"Cut the balderdash, already!\" said the Pagemaster, \"I know people like you. You're just another couple of con artists who train these teenage girls in royal ways until you find the perfect Bethylasia imposter!\" Becca gasped when she heard this on the other side. At the balcony, Mystery pleaded, \"But sir, this girl has come all this way from the real world just to see you!\" \"And others have come from as far as Middle Earth,\" remarked the wizard. \"But, Pagemaster!\" Sci Fi protested, \"Mystery and I promise we won't bother you anymore. We just want you to understand!\" When she put her hands onto his hand, the Pagemaster asked her angrily, \"Just what good is there for you two to waste your time troubling an old wizard for money?\" Becca gasped again when she heard that part on the other side. Meanwhile, the Pagemaster snapped his fingers for two of his guards and ordered them, \"Remove these two at once!\" Each guard took Mystery and Sci Fi away while Mystery pleaded, \"But we're telling you – she's the real Bethylasia!\" \"Yeah!\" added Sci Fi, \"She's the actual princess – if you'll just listen for a minute!\" The guards then dropped the couple outside the door by Becca as they walked away. Mystery and Sci Fi got back on their feet, and became surprised when they saw the teen girl glaring at them. Fantasy, Horror, and Adventure, who had gone off to get more wine, approached the three and also became surprised when they saw Becca. \"Honey, are you okay?\" Fantasy asked with concern. \"No, I am not okay,\" Becca said under her breath, \"Because I know now… that all of you were hiding something from me this whole time, weren't you?\" Sci Fi gave a look of shock and asked, \"What are you talking about?\" \"Come on!\" Becca said, \"You guys USED me? I wasn't really a customer, or a kingdom's savior. I was just part of your guys' little con to get his money, wasn't I?\" \"Becca, please!\" said Mystery, \"What you heard back there was a misunderstanding. None of us would EVER use you as a part of anything, because you know what? Sci Fi says that you are really Bethylasia – you are!\" \"STOP IT!\" Becca shot at her friends angrily, \"Stop it, all of you! Ever since I first came here, you guys lied to me! I can't believe I was so stupid and naïve to not only believe all of you, but actually think that…. Ugh! Never mind what I thought!\" As the girl walked away furiously, Sci Fi stopped her and said, \"Becca, wait! Remember when you spoke about running away through this place with an old man? And about a certain dream? Listen, that…\" \"NO!\" the girl furiously shouted, \"I don't wanna be reminded about ANYTHING I recalled or dreamt about! So all of you traffickers should just leave me alone!\" Sci Fi put her hand on Becca's shoulder, but the latter half turned around and smacked her in the face! \"And we thought she would be so happy to get home,\" said Fantasy with a sad look as the girl walked away. But then she frowned and told Sci Fi and Mystery, \"But you two just had to do it, didn't you?! Now look what's happened!\" She pointed to Becca storming down the stairs, past a crowd of surprised onlookers, and out the palace doors.[Chapter 25] Chapter 24 - The Biggest Challenge Yet Becca soon found Sheila in the flower bed, picked her up, and then ran away to a nearby forest. The clock in the tower near the palace began to chime twelve, and Becca angrily stood tall and let the spell break; her ball gown transformed back into her school clothes, her choker turned back into her book necklace, and her onyx flats turned back into her clogs. Her tiara also disappeared and her hair also turned from a bun into a low ponytail. Once the transformation was complete, Becca felt warm moist in her eyes as she dropped to her knees and laid face-down on the ground near a little pond. Sheila just sat in sympathy as she watched Becca cry. The girl lifted her head and sobbed, \"I can't do this! I can't help break this curse! Who said I was actually Bethylasia? No one! That's why I can't do it!\" As she kept on sobbing, a white light shone above the pond. The light flashed a little bit, and the spirit of a woman appeared. Becca looked up with tears in her eyes and saw the woman; the girl was surprised as she asked with a lump in her throat, \"Who are you? And what do you want?\" \"Do not be afraid, my dear,\" the woman gently told her, \"I am the Pagemistress, the Pagemaster's late wife.\" Becca looked at her in confusion. Had she heard the word \"Pagemistress\" before? \"What happened to you?\" the girl asked. \"I risked my life to save my family,\" the Pagemistress told her, \"My husband's evil cousin wanted revenge on him, so she stopped my heart and turned my son and his family to stone. The only people to make it out of the coup were the Pagemaster and my youngest granddaughter, Bethylasia.\" \"Yeah, I know,\" Becca said with slight irritation, \"The Pagemaster told me that. But he didn't tell me that I would be part of some con!\" The Pagemistress gently shushed Becca and told her, \"Calm down, dear. You know, none of his servants were actually using you. In fact, they never even wanted money to begin with!\" \"They didn't?\" Becca asked, feeling guilty for getting angry at her friends for no reason, \"But I heard…\" \"What you heard was a misunderstanding,\" the woman spirit continued, \"My widower is just feeling so stressed at already seeing many other girls claiming to be the princess. In fact, here he comes now!\" She pointed to something behind Becca. What Becca saw was the Pagemaster, who had witnessed the people he argued with transform back into animals at midnight back at the palace. \"My dear Pagemistress!\" he exclaimed when he saw the spirit, \"What are you doing here? I thought you were dead!\" \"I am,\" said the Pagemistress, \"But the magic of imagination and literature, along with your heart, keep me alive. This poor girl has clearly been through a lot, and I just came over to comfort her.\" The Pagemaster touched Becca's shoulder and said, \"My dear child, I misunderstood your friends. They were trying to help me, but I thought I was being conned again. I see you'd like to speak to me.\" \"Yes,\" Becca said as she wiped the last of her tears away, \"I want you to know that I'm through with this quest, and I want to go home!\" \"But you haven't faced your last challenge yet,\" said the Pagemaster, \"Your last challenge in this section involves finding out who you really are. Look at the charm around your neck.\" As Becca looked at her necklace, the Pagemistress sang a song: I have crossed the horizon to find you I know your name You have lost the heart from inside you But this does not define you This is not who you are You know who you are. Becca looked carefully at her necklace pendant, and sudden images came to her mind – the picture of the youngest girl in the rotunda, a birthday party, a royal family, opening up a book, and travelling through Libralia with an old man (who was the Pagemaster). Suddenly, Becca's eyes widened as she finally figured out her challenge's solution! \"I'm living a double life!\" she told the Pagemaster and Pagemistress, \"In the real world, my name is Becca Ridges – an ordinary school girl who's constantly being bullied. But I've known this place far longer than I've thought. In this world… I am Bethylasia. None of the animals were lying, after all! I am Bethylasia!\" \"Of course you are!\" beamed the Pagemaster, \"I knew it all along. But you had to prove yourself worthy of a brave princess in order to come all this way to see me again – not to mention, your grandmother's spirit, also!\" And with those words, Becca, whom we now know as Bethylasia, embraced the Pagemaster with a tight hug as she cried tears of happiness. The Pagemistress also hugged her husband and granddaughter for a few minutes before she disappeared completely. Sheila meowed a happy meow while off in the distance, a quintet of certain book-turned animals watched with happiness. Author's Note: The song \"Know Who You Are\" is from the movie Moana. ((c) Disney)[Chapter 26] Chapter 25 - Keys to the Past Meanwhile, in a heavily dark and forested area of the fantasy section, a certain evil sorceress and her raven were plotting something. \"Eddie, I think it's finally happened!\" Malaria said with an evil grin, \"I think Bethylasia has finally been found!\" \"Oh boy, that's great!\" beamed Eddie, \"Now what?\" \"We just wait until the right time,\" said Malaria, \"I can sense that there may be a party coming real soon!\" \"A party?\" cried Eddie as he grabbed a party hat and put it on his head, \"I just LOVE parties! Especially the kind where you get to show off your dancing skills – I could show you the latest dance moves, and…\" \"It will be a grand and wonderful party,\" continued Malaria with a smirk, \"Bethylasia will have her moment.\" \"Who cares about the princess?\" said Eddie as he danced the Bossa-Nova. \"And then, I will frighten her with her greatest fear and kill her!\" finished the sorceress. \"Okay, then – kill her?!\" cried Eddie as he stopped dancing and his party hat fell off, \"But your Excellency, why? What about the party?\" \"That's the place I'm choosing to kill the little brat,\" laughed Malaria, \"I'll transform into what killed her friend, and then I will finish her off!\" \"But why not just forget about her and your cousin and get a life?\" asked Eddie with concern. \"Oh, not to worry, I'll get a life,\" said Malaria before laughing, \"HER'S! Not to mention the lives of her little animal friends and her grandfather!\" The evil sorceress then went back to work looking at her spell book for more evil magic. In the meantime, after being comforted by the Pagemaster, Bethylasia was ready to go back to the palace. But then she noticed the book animals and stopped. \"Um, Grandfather,\" she said, \"I need to talk to these guys for a moment.\" The old wizard nodded and let his granddaughter get down on her knees. The book animals gave her sad looks, and Sci Fi said, \"Sweetheart, we're so sorry we let you down.\" \"No,\" said Bethylasia, \"I'm the one who should be sorry. I shouldn't have eavesdropped, I shouldn't have gotten angry, and I shouldn't have hit you in the face, Sci Fi. I'm so sorry for everything!\" She then embraced all her friends in a big group hug. Sci Fi nuzzled Bethylasia's cheek while shedding a tear and said, \"Bec-er, Bethylasia, nothing was your fault. Mystery and I were just trying to help you, but the Pagemaster misunderstood what was going on.\" \"She's right, honey,\" said Fantasy, \"And we never wanted any kind of reward. The only thing that matters to us is helping you help us break this curse.\" \"Aye,\" said Adventure, \"The sooner you break this curse, the better. But for now, I think ye should spend time with yer long-lost grandfather and remember all the happy times before anything bad happened.\" The Pagemaster then put his hand on Bethylasia's shoulder, indicating that they should get moving. \"I'd say that I think we're all even now,\" the girl said with a small smile. \"Of course,\" said Mystery, \"You can't stay mad at your closest friends forever, you know.\" \"Good luck, sweetheart,\" said Sci Fi, \"And remember that we're all here to help you if you need it!\" Bethylasia got up and walked with her grandfather while looking back at her friends. The animals all smiled at her before they decided to go their own ways back to the palace. Back at the palace, the Pagemaster showed Bethylasia a secret room in the cellar. Inside, there were the stone bodies of the royal family all huddled together. Since that dreadful incident, the Pagemaster had ordered his servants to keep the stone family in that very room to rest in peace until the lost princess could return and break Malaria's curse. Bethylasia sighed and said sadly, \"I remember now. It was an awful day when your cousin killed Grandmother and turned the others into stone.\" \"Yes,\" said the Pagemaster, \"But tomorrow night, we shall have a bittersweet celebration. We will remember your fallen family, but we will also celebrate your return until you decide to end my cousin's evil curse once and for all!\" Bethylasia smiled a little bit as she then noticed a dusty chest. \"Grandfather, do you know what's in here?\" she asked. The Pagemaster just smiled and used some of his magic to open the chest. Inside, there were old pictures of the royal family, along with some of the children's most prized possessions. \"Oh, all my drawings!\" Bethylasia cried as she searched through pieces of paper with drawings on them. She held up one of them depicting the palace chef and laughed, \"This one's my favorite! I remember when I showed it to everybody, and Donovan made me so mad! He said it looked like a horse vomiting out spaghetti! He was right.\" The Pagemaster laughed and said, \"When I hear your laughter, I hear my wife laughing.\" He then reached into the chest and pulled out the book he gave to Bethylasia on her seventh birthday. The girl gasped and said, \"Hey! I think I know how to open this!\" She took off her necklace, inserted the book charm into the keyhole, turned it to the left, and the book unlocked! Bethylasia opened it up and saw pieces of the past on pages. \"This was your book of secrets and events, wasn't it, Grandfather?\" she said. The Pagemaster nodded as Bethylasia turned a few pages and saw a picture of her and her grandfather reminiscing happy memories. \"Just watching you smile reminds me of your father,\" said the Pagemaster, \"Crown Prince Matthias. If he saw you right now, he would be beyond delighted.\" The wizard then reached into the chest and took out a jeweled box. After blowing the dust off a bit, he opened it and revealed a golden tiara with a red ruby in the center. \"Do you know what else you inherit?\" he asked his granddaughter, \"You inherit the beauty and intelligence of your mother, Natalia, Crown Princess of Libralia!\" The Pagemaster placed the tiara on top of Bethylasia's head, and the girl looked at herself in a nearby mirror. She was surprised and delighted when she saw her reflection. We then cut away to the next morning when Bethylasia was in her bedroom, looking at herself in the mirror again. This time, she still had the tiara, but she also had her hair done in a high bun, and wore a silvery white gown with a halter neckline, long, white gloves, a deep red sash going across her chest and around her waist, diamond earrings, a gold necklace with a shiny pendant, and white high heels with bows on them. Bethylasia smiled as she turned around and admired her new dress, while Fantasy and Sci Fi looked on in awe.[Chapter 27] Chapter 26 - Longing Desires Later that morning, all the book animals gathered with the Pagemaster in his throne room. \"If you wish,\" said the Pagemaster, \"I will reward you with fifty million pieces of gold for returning my granddaughter.\" The animals all looked at each other with thoughtful faces until Sci Fi spoke up. \"That's a very nice offer,\" she said, \"But I'm afraid we can't accept any pieces of gold. After all, we are your loyal servants, and we already serve you well within our respective sections.\" \"I agree,\" said Mystery, \"I think only your gratitude is a big enough reward.\" The Pagemaster looked at his servants in a puzzled way before he asked, \"You mean you've come all this way with my lost granddaughter, and you want nothing? Surely there is something I can give to repay all of you in helping Bethylasia?\" \"Unfortunately, no, sir,\" said Fantasy, \"We've done all we could, and I think it's time for Becca, I mean, Bethylasia to continue living the life she has been missing.\" \"Wouldn't you all at least care to attend the ball tonight?\" the Pagemaster asked. \"A ball?\" inquired Horror, \"What kind of ball is it, my Pagemaster?\" The old wizard smiled and said, \"It will be a bittersweet occasion. We will remember my family and wife who fell at the hands of Malaria, but we will also celebrate the return of my granddaughter, who can break the curse!\" \"Well if it involves celebrating our heroine,\" said Sci Fi with a small smile, \"I guess my pals and I will come. Too bad we won't be checked out by Becca.\" The marten sighed sadly before telling her friends, \"I think we should go now.\" So all the animals bowed to the Pagemaster, and his dismissed them. When they all left, the Pagemaster thought about something. Meanwhile, Bethylasia was outside the palace, wandering in the garden with Sheila. The kitten now had a big pink bow around her neck, along with a tiny pearl tiara on her head. When the princess and her pet reached a water fountain, Bethylasia sat down at the edge of the fountain, and Sheila joined her. When the kitten saw her reflection in the water, she shook her head, causing her tiara to fall off into Bethylasia's lap. The girl picked up the tiara and looked at it with a thoughtful look. \"You know what, Sheila?\" said the princess, \"I know I should be happy here and feel honored to have a royal family that I'm going to save. But I'm not sure if this is where I really belong. In fact, I'm not even sure if I should stay a princess for the rest of my life! It's not that I'm next in line for the throne – my imaginary father and Alexander are – but even if I was, I know nothing of ruling a kingdom!\" She sighed and looked at her reflection in the fountain's pool before singing: Look at me, I will never pass for a perfect girl, Or a perfect princess Can it be? I'm not meant to play this part? Bethylasia got up from the fountain and began walking among a path lined with roses, lilacs and delphiniums while wondering if she should stay a princess or return to the real world and be whom she really was. Now I see That if I were truly to be myself, I would break the family's hearts! The princess and her kitten made it to a koi pond near a labyrinth, and Bethylasia looked down at her reflection in the water while watching the fish swim to and fro. Who is that girl I see Staring straight back at me? Why is my reflection someone I don't know? Somehow I cannot hide Who I am, though I've tried! When will my reflection show Who I am inside? Bethylasia turned her head away from the pond, and then picked a peony from a nearby bush before finishing: When will my reflection show Who I am inside? Bethylasia picked up Sheila, and then made her way back to the palace while thinking about her song. Author's Note: The song \"Reflection\" is from Disney's Mulan ((c) Disney)[Chapter 28] Chapter 27 - The Final Conflict Later that evening inside the palace, the book animals were busy getting ready for the ball that was to take place soon. Adventure, Horror and Mystery all had black bowties around their necks, while Fantasy and Sci Fi each wore a white ribbon around their necks. Fantasy happily hummed a tune while brushing her tail in the mirror, but Sci Fi just looked very glum as she combed her fur. \"Sci Fi, what's wrong?\" asked Fantasy with concern when she saw her friend, \"You tell your best friend about it.\" Sci Fi sighed and said, \"We're never going home with that girl.\" \"Who, Bethylasia?\" asked Fantasy. \"That's her name in this world,\" remarked Sci Fi, \"But in the real world, she's Becca – the person I know best.\" Mystery came over to Sci Fi and comforted her by saying, \"Come now, Sci Fi. You should be happy for the princess! After all, she's found out her identity, and she's found the courage to take Malaria down when the time is right! Besides, would you rather be checked out from the real world's library as a marten, or as a book?\" Sci Fi chuckled a bit and said, \"A guess as a book.\" Then she thought for a moment and said, \"I suppose you're right, Mystery. Bethylasia should at least spend a little time with her family when the curse breaks!\" \"Now that's the fearless and confident friend I know!\" laughed Fantasy as she embraced her friend with a hug. Adventure heard some music from outside the dressing room, and said, \"I think it's time we get out and start celebrating on the main deck!\" Everyone else agreed, and followed the beaver. Out in the main ballroom, people were dancing, talking, laughing, and enjoying refreshments in honor of the princess's return. Just then, a chamberlain blew a horn and announced, \"Ladies and gentlemen! Let me be the first to present the Pagemaster and his long-lost granddaughter, Princess Bethylasia!\" The Pagemaster and Bethylasia entered the room, while Sheila tagged along at her mistress's feet. Everyone cheered and bowed to their rulers before they went back to dancing and socializing. The Pagemaster and Bethylasia sat down at their thrones and watched all the guests happily enjoy themselves as the wizard told his granddaughter, \"Look around you, my child. You were brought into this world of high society, sparkling jewels, and all of the world's greatest literature. But I wonder if this is truly enough for you?\" Bethylasia took Sheila into her lap and looked at her grandfather, saying, \"I guess so. But I miss my life back in the real world when I was Becca. I miss my real parents Tasha and Mark just about as much as I miss my parents in this world.\" The Pagemaster could see his granddaughter's eyes get moist, and he gently held her hands as he coaxed, \"Bethylasia, I can tell that you're homesick. But I need you right now, because my cousin's curse is growing immensely. However, when you defeat Malaria, you may think about which family you would like to live in for the rest of your life. But no matter what you choose in the end, we will always have each other – as Becca Ridges, you can still dream about me and the rest of your family and friends here in Libralia, and we will all be there for you.\" The wizard then got up from his chair to check on his guests. Bethylasia turned around and thought about her grandfather's advice for a moment. She was about to say something to him, but he was already gone when she looked up. The princess then decided to join in the dancing when she heard some meowing outside. Somehow, Sheila had run away from her, and was outside! \"Sheila?\" Bethylasia called softly. She looked straight on, and saw a faint figure at the edge of the doorway to the gardens. Sheila was out there! So Bethylasia picked up her skirt and walked quickly over to the doorway while quietly calling, \"Sheila, what are you doing out there?\" By the time the princess got outside, Sheila was already scurrying down some steps to the garden. \"Sheila, come back here!\" Bethylasia softly called again; but the kitten had disappeared into the labyrinth. The girl had no choice but to follow Sheila in the maze. \"Sheila, where are you?\" Bethylasia called as she ran, \"Sheila?\" Unknown to her, the labyrinth made some thorny branches that closed behind her, and a topiary of a lion was given glowing, red eyes! Back at the ball, the book animals were at the refreshments table enjoying some snacks when Fantasy became a little concerned. \"Has anyone seen Bethylasia lately?\" she asked the other books. Mystery finished eating a chocolate brownie and replied, \"Um, the last time I saw her, she was going outside for something.\" \"I thought I heard some meowing from her kitty,\" said Horror. Sci Fi gave a look of fear and said, \"You know what? I think she's in serious trouble! I have a gut feeling.\" She then turned to her friends and gave a serious expression before she said, \"We need to go out and help her – NOW!\" The other animals stopped what they were doing and nodded at the marten. Meanwhile, in the labyrinth, Bethylasia was getting worried about Sheila. The kitten kept running away and meowing, and the princess kept following her. \"Sh-Sheila?\" called Bethylasia, \"Here, girl!\" Another set of thorns blocked the part where Bethylasia went through, and the princess turned around and gasped in fright. When she turned back around, she saw Sheila sitting by some bushes and meowing with fear. \"There you are!\" Bethylasia said as she embraced her kitten. Just then, a voice called, \"Bethylasia!\" The girl got up from her knees and gasped as the voice kept repeating her name. Suddenly, some purple smoke appeared from behind the princess, making her cough and run towards an open entrance in the labyrinth; however, Bethylasia tripped over a rock and fell face-down on the ground, knocking her glasses off her face! But she got back on her feet, put her glasses back on, and dusted herself off. When she looked forward, Bethylasia found herself in a meadow and was shocked by what she saw – an evil-looking woman in a purple and black dress smirking at her – Malaria! \"Bethylasia,\" said Malaria, \"Your royal highness! So much has happened within the past ten years in this kingdom. You have grown from a scrawny blossom to a beautiful young rose, and my curse has grown into an apocalypse for literature and happiness!\" Bethylasia studied Malaria's facial features with fright and gasped, \"I know that face!\" Malaria chuckled, \"Yes. Do you remember seeing it at a celebration like this one?\" \"My seventh birthday,\" the princess remembered. \"Followed by a tragic day for your grandmother and the rest of your family!\" finished Malaria, \"Remember, Bethylasia!\" She then put her hands in the air, and pointed at the ground, creating a purple atmosphere all around the meadow. The princess immediately recognized who this woman was now. \"Why, you're Malaria!\" Bethylasia gasped with fright. \"Of course,\" Malaria chuckled before she snapped, \"Your grandfather's cousin who was turned down when it came time to rule Libralia! But you know what they say, 'what goes around comes around!'\" She then summoned some of her ghost minions out of her necklace pendant and told them, \"Why don't we humiliate this girl a little bit, boys?\" \"Yes, ma'am!\" saluted the ghosts. They then floated their way towards Bethylasia and laughed at her. All the poor girl could do was stand in terror as the ghosts began to push her around, yank her tiara from her head, and pull her necklace off from her neck. Eddie, who was watching the scene from a high branch in a leafless tree, called to Malaria, \"Your excellency, I think this is going too far! Maybe you shouldn't be so cruel to this girl. She hasn't done anything wrong to you!\" \"SHUT UP, YOU OVERSIZED CROW!\" Malaria snapped from down below. Meanwhile, Bethylasia tried to escape the ghosts, but one of them caught her hair and sneered, \"Where are you going, princess?\" \"Yeah!\" laughed another ghost, \"The party's just starting!\" Bethylasia's hair came undone as the ghosts continued harassing her; this time, they started tearing her dress in a very cruel fashion. One ghost ripped the girl's sash from her waist when Malaria ordered, \"Alright, my phantom friends! I think that's enough. We shouldn't do too much more tearing, or she'll be a nymph!\" The ghosts all disappeared as Bethylasia sneered at Malaria, \"I'm not scared of you, you heartless fiend!\" \"Oh, I can fix that!\" said Malaria with an evil grin, \"Care to meet an old friend? One who murdered your best friend?\" She then waved her hand over her necklace pendant and slowly transformed into a monstrous grizzly bear. Bethylasia watched in terror as she recognized the scary animal from the terrible day when she lost her best friend in the real world. Malaria, who was now a grizzly bear, stood on her hind legs and gave a big roar before going back on all fours and asking the princess, \"Remember me now?\" Bethylasia was speechless. \"You mean you were the one who…\" she started. \"Yes!\" said Malaria, \"I was there. I travel in the real world quite a bit, where I take many forms when you least expect me around! That day, I was a bear who was enjoying a freshly killed deer, when I saw you and your little friend disturbing my peace! I smelled you, and I immediately recognized you as the one who escaped your family's coup! I wanted to charge at you, but you played dead and I had no other choice but to take someone else that you cared for most!\" \"Why?!\" Bethylasia shouted angrily, \"Why didn't you just take me?\" \"Because my bear instincts were immediately kicking in,\" replied Malaria, \"And when I saw you playing dead, I knew this wasn't a good time to get rid of you. So someone else had to die and make you suffer for the loss! But enough with memories of your friend; now it's time to take you down once and for all! That way, I will be able to destroy literature once and for all!\" \"Think again, sweetheart!\" shouted a tough female voice. \"This is mutiny!\" cried a familiar pirate's voice. \"SANCTUARY!\" shouted another familiar voice. Bethylasia turned and saw all her animal friends come to the rescue! Sci Fi ran and jumped onto Malaria's head and bit into her nose, making her roar in pain! Adventure bit her on the leg, and Horror jumped onto the bear's back! Bethylasia found a nearby thorny stick and picked it up as she cried, \"I can't believe you guys are here to help!\" \"Naturally, honey!\" said Fantasy as she ran to her aid, \"That's what real friends are for!\" Malaria, meanwhile, put up a major fight with Sci Fi, Adventure, and Horror. First, the bear shook Sci Fi off her face, making the marten land on the ground; but Sci Fi wasn't hurt! Malaria also grabbed Adventure and Horror by her front paws, and threw them into a bush, where they stayed hidden. Bethylasia whacked the bear on the head with her thorny stick, and Malaria roared another big roar; she swiped her front paw at the girl, and sent her down to the ground! Bethylasia wasn't seriously hurt, but Malaria got in front of her, and then tried to attack her again. Suddenly, a familiar green fisher appeared and bit Malaria on her front leg! He then let go of his bite and growled at the bear. \"Mystery?\" Sci Fi wondered as she saw the scene. She then got back on her feet and ran towards Mystery. She growled menacingly at Malaria, and then bit her on the shoulder. Bethylasia, meanwhile, got back on her feet and picked up a sharp rock. She tried stabbing the bear in the back with it, but Malaria turned around and attacked her again. \"BECCA!\" Sci Fi cried as she and Mystery ran to her aid. But Malaria snorted and sneered at the girl, \"Goodnight, sweet princess! It's time for your demise!\" Bethylasia looked closely at Malaria's neck, and saw that she was still wearing her magic necklace. Quickly, she snatched it off the bear's neck, and then whacked it on the ground, creating a large crack in the stone pendant! A light purple beam shot out from Malaria's right shoulder, making her roar in agony. \"What are you doing?!\" she demanded. Bethylasia held up the necklace and said with rage, \"This is for Nicole!\" She whacked the necklace's pendant on the ground, creating another crack. This time, another beam shot out from Malaria's abdomen, making her scream, \"You give my necklace back, you little brat!\" \"This is for the Pagemistress and the rest of my family!\" Bethylasia shouted as she whacked the pendant again, making yet another crack. Another beam shot out of Malaria's right leg as the bear shouted, \"You better stop doing this to me, or you'll be very sorry!\" \"And this one is for YOU!\" Bethylasia yelled with fury, \"Farewell, Malaria! Parting is such sweet sorrow!\" She then whacked the necklace's pendant again, this time, making it shatter into a thousand pieces! A powerful beam shot out from the left side of Malaria's chest, making her roar in deep agony. Suddenly, the spirit of Malaria's necklace appeared, and then he circled around the helpless bear while mocking, \"What's the matter, little teddy bear? Are you all out of magic because of not using it wisely? Well, now you will suffer dearly for it, thanks to the girl who has defeated you!\" With that, the ghost went inside the bear's mouth, and an explosion of purple and black smoke happened! Bethylasia managed to escape the impact, and shielded all her animal friends while Malaria withered away to a pile of purple dust. The atmosphere went back to a normal nighttime setting, and poor Eddie the raven was so terrified of the princess, that he flew away, never to be seen or heard from again.[Chapter 29] Chapter 28 - The Curse is Broken! After destroying Malaria and her magic, Bethylasia sat on the ground, and all the animals gathered around her in a circle. \"Is everyone all right?\" the princess asked. \"Yeah, I think so,\" said Mystery with a smile. \"But, sweetheart, your dress!\" cried Sci Fi with a shocked look. \"Yeah, I know,\" said Bethylasia with a bored tone, \"You see…\" \"Oh, never mind the dress,\" said Fantasy, \"What matters is that everyone's okay. And Malaria's curse is broken!\" Bethylasia remembered something and snapped her fingers. \"My family!\" she said, \"Come on, guys, we need to check on them!\" So she carried Sheila in her arms while all the animals followed her to the cellar. Upon reaching the cellar, the princess led her friends to a secret room where some faint light was glowing behind the door. She opened the door, and saw a pink light glowing around the stone bodies of the royal family members. All the other animals gasped in surprise, too. Suddenly, tiny little pink and blue hailstones sprinkled from the top of the room, covering the stone statues completely! A white beam shot out from an opening, and everyone covered their eyes as more beams came shooting out from the hail-covered statues. The Pagemaster, who had heard some noises from the cellar, came bursting through the doors to witness what was happening. \"My child, has Malaria been defeated already?\" he asked his granddaughter with surprise. Bethylasia only nodded. Just then, all the beams and hailstones disappeared, and in place of the statues were some people who were moving about. Bethylasia got a better look as the people began to stand up. One person was a man with brown hair, a beard and mustache, and brown eyes – that was Crown Prince Matthias! Another person was a woman with auburn hair and blue eyes, and she wore glasses like Bethylasia – that was Crown Princess Natalia! \"Mama? Papa?\" Bethylasia inquired with a surprised look in her eyes. Matthias and Natalia looked at their long-lost daughter with big smiles, ran to her, and hugged her real tight! Bethylasia cried tears of happiness as she then noticed more figures moving; two of them were young men, and one was a young woman. The two men revealed themselves to be Alexander and Donovan, Bethylasia's brothers, and the woman was revealed to be Mirabelle, Bethylasia's sister. All the siblings embraced their youngest sister with a tight hug, laughter, and tears of happiness. Suddenly, some fireworks shot off outside the cellar, and lit up the night sky with many colors! Quickly, the dark sky transformed into a sunny morning, and leafless trees began to grow beautiful green leaves and pink blossoms; some thorny bushes transformed into green bushes with white roses, and then something else happened. A magical stream of sparkles spun around Adventure, transforming him from a beaver back to a pirate book! \"Arrrgh!\" he said with happiness, \"It feels good to be a pirate again!\" Another stream of sparkles spun around Fantasy, transforming her from a squirrel back into a fairy godmother book! She laughed and felt herself flying as she exclaimed, \"Look at that! I'm flying again!\" More streams of sparkles then spun around Sci Fi and Mystery, making them jump for joy at being books again! \"What about me? What about me?\" Horror asked excitedly as he jumped up and down. Yet another sparkle stream flew around him, and he transformed from a woodchuck to a \"hunchbook!\" \"Hooray!\" he shouted as he continued jumping for joy. Bethylasia gave a big smile and cried, \"Now I remember what you guys looked like before you were animals! This is a big miracle for me!\" \"Not just for you,\" Matthias added with a smile, \"But for all of us!\" \"Of course,\" added Natalia, \"We thought we'd never see you again! Too bad we didn't get to see you transform into a beautiful young lady.\" \"Yeah,\" said Bethylasia with a sad look. She looked at the ground and remembered her life in the real world as Becca. \"If you guys don't mind,\" she told her parents and siblings, \"I wish to continue my life living in the real world as Becca Ridges.\" The siblings all gasped, and Matthias and Natalia gave surprised looks. However, the Pagemaster assured everyone with a smile, \"Not to worry. Bethylasia and I had this kind of discussion earlier, and I told her that no matter where she chooses to live, we would always have each other. After all, she could dream about us, imagine us, or possibly write a book about us! Whatever she does, we will always be there for her.\" \"Very well,\" said Natalia with a confident tone, \"The most important thing we want is for our youngest daughter – our heroine – to be happy at all times.\" Bethylasia gave one last group hug to her family before the Pagemaster motioned for her and the books to come with him. In another part of the palace, the Pagemaster opened up his book of secrets, and showed Bethylasia what was going on in the real world. The princess saw a picture of Becca still lying unconscious in the library's restroom. \"That's me!\" she cried, \"And I'm still unconscious! Grandfather, I wish you could take me back to the real world. And not just me – I also want Sheila and all my book friends to come with me!\" When they heard the last part, all the books gathered around Bethylasia with big smiles, and the girl knelt down and hugged them all. \"Well, what do you know?\" chuckled Sci Fi, \"She's going to check us out, after all!\" \"Of course,\" replied the girl, \"I couldn't stay mad at you guys forever, you know!\" \"We knew you couldn't, mistress!\" said Horror with tears of happiness in his eyes. Bethylasia then turned to her grandfather and asked him, \"Do you know a way we can all go back to the real world?\" The Pagemaster nodded and said, \"Just close your eyes and think of the happiest things that have ever happened in your lives!\" As everyone shut their eyes, Bethylasia thought long and hard of happy memories. She thought of her real world family, laughing with Nicole, and her recent adventure in Libralia. Then, the Pagemaster waved his staff in the air for a little bit, and his granddaughter, Sheila, and all the books disappeared into sparkling blue smoke. The smoke travelled up in the air, and then made its way to the page showing Becca in the bathroom. Back in the real world, Bethylasia and her friends fell from the ceiling, and the princess landed into Becca's subconscious. Becca moved around a bit as she woke up; she also heard five little thuds outside the restroom. She opened her eyes and looked around; Sheila was sitting on the sink counter, and the girl's backpack was lying next to the kitten. Becca then stood up, carefully put Sheila back into her backpack, and then ran out the bathroom door. To her surprise, Becca's class was still listening to Mr. Dewey talk before he broke them up into groups for the field trip project – hardly any time had passed since Becca went unconscious. \"Becca, are you okay?\" Mrs. Clarke asked her as the girl rejoined her class. \"Um, yes!\" said Becca, \"I just slipped on a patch of water, but I'm okay!\" A meow escaped the girl's backpack, and Mrs. Clarke gave her a suspicious look. \"Becca, is there something in your pack that I should know about?\" Becca took off her backpack and stammered, \"Umm, no! W-why do you ask?\" Mrs. Clarke just looked in the pack and saw Sheila. She was surprised at seeing a kitten in her pupil's backpack, and she cleared her throat and gave Becca a stern look. Mr. Dewey, who had seen what was going on, walked over to the teacher and girl and said, \"Oh! My cat, Natalie, lives in the library with me. She had kittens a few weeks ago, and I'm getting ready to give the little ones a new home. Young lady, if you are a responsible and loving person, you may have this feisty little girl all for your own!\" Becca beamed with joy and said, \"Oh, thank you, Mr. Dewey!\" Mr. Dewey picked up Sheila and said, \"In the meantime, I'll hold onto her while you do your project with some of your peers, okay?\" Becca nodded and went with Mrs. Clarke back to the center of the library, where all the other students were waiting.[Chapter 30] Chapter 29: Home Again for Real Throughout the rest of the afternoon, Becca had a grand time on her field trip. She did her best to socialize with her peers, and if anyone bullied her, Becca just ignored them. At the end of the day, she remembered her promise to her book friends back in Libralia. Sure enough, as she and her classmates exited the library with some books, Becca had gathered up five familiar-looking books – one of them was a brown adventure book, another one was a lavender fantasy book, a third one was a blue horror book, the fourth one was a yellow science fiction book, and the fifth one was a green mystery book. There was a big line at the check-out desk to see Mr. Dewey, but then a younger employee waved his hand for the next customers. That employee was a young man in his thirties, and he had blonde hair and blue eyes; he also wore a pair of glasses, a red dress shirt, a pair of dark blue jeans, and brown shoes. It wasn't long before Becca went up to the desk and saw the young man. He greeted her as she handed him her library card. As he checked out the books, a surprised look came to his eyes. \"Hey,\" he said, \"I remember checking out three of these books a long time ago when I was a kid!\" \"You did?\" asked Becca with interest, \"Which ones?\" \"The adventure one, the fantasy one, and the horror one,\" said the man, \"My name's Richard, by the way. And you are?\" \"Beth- er, I mean, Becca Ridges!\" said the girl as she pointed to her name on her card. \"Oh, yeah, I see now!\" said Richard as he handed his customer her books. He printed a receipt from the computer, placed into the mystery book, and finished, \"Okay, Miss Ridges, these books will be due in three weeks' time. I hope you enjoy your adventures within these stories!\" Becca smiled and said, \"Oh, I will! Thank you!\" As the girl headed towards the bus, Mr. Dewey stopped her and said, \"Miss, I think this little friend belongs to you, too!\" He walked over to her with Sheila the kitten in his hands. Becca stopped, placed the books down, and then gently placed Sheila into her backpack. \"Thank you, Mister,\" she said, \"I had a great time in your library!\" Mr. Dewey smiled and winked as he watched Becca take her belongings and catch up with the rest of her classmates. Sometime later, Becca was walking home with her books in her hands and Sheila sleeping in her backpack. \"Okay, Becca,\" she told herself, \"You can do this – you can convince Mom and Dad that you can take care of a kitten. And maybe even the neighbor's dog, too!\" When she arrived home, Becca opened the front door and called, \"Mom! I'm home!\" Tasha, who was doing some chores upstairs, came down the staircase and greeted her daughter by saying, \"Hello, sweetie! How was the field trip?\" Becca smiled and said, \"It was great! It was basically the adventure of my life!\" Her mother gave a puzzled look and said, \"Gee, I didn't know that learning to be a librarian could be so interesting.\" \"Well, it is,\" replied Becca, \"Because you get to explore different genres with books, and travel in different worlds. Who knows? You may even become a different person!\" She then showed her mother her books and then took off her backpack. She opened it up and pulled out Sheila. \"Mom, the librarian there told me that his cat had kittens a few weeks ago,\" she explained, \"He probably said that they're old enough to be on their own, and I really like this one. I named her Sheila. So may I keep her, PLEASE?\" Tasha thought for a moment and said, \"I don't know. I thought you said you were afraid of animals.\" \"But that was before my field trip,\" pleaded Becca, \"Something inside me changed, and now I like animals. In fact, I can even babysit the neighbor's dog sometime if I had to! I swear, Mom, I'll protect and take care of Sheila with all my heart!\" Becca's mother also couldn't resist Sheila's cuteness, and then she grinned, \"All right, darling. She's yours. But please promise me that you will feed her and clean up after her every day!\" \"I promise, Mom,\" replied Becca as she hugged her mother. \"In the meantime,\" continued her mother, \"I'll call your father and tell him about your new family member so that he can swing by the store and pick up some cat food and cat litter on the way home!\" So Tasha went to telephone Mark while Becca took Sheila and the books upstairs to her room. Becca spent the rest of the day telling her parents about her day at the library, taking care of Sheila, and her aspirations to become a children's author. \"Sounds like my little princess had a busy day!\" said Mark with a smile during dinner, \"I'm also very glad that you aren't scared of animals anymore. Maybe in a few months, after you get the hang of taking care of Sheila, I might ask the neighbor to see if you can babysit their dog.\" \"That would be great, Dad!\" said Becca, \"But let's hope that the dog isn't like Stephen King's Cujo !\" \"Oh, no!\" laughed Tasha, \"This dog is a friendly Great Dane. He's just as lovable as Scooby-Doo!\" Becca just grinned. \"I'm also going to do better in school – I promise! I'll stop drawing pictures, and I'll focus more on studying variables and poetry!\" \"That's my girl,\" said Tasha, \"I knew you would put your bad memories past, and keep the good ones at all times!\" Becca made a sad smile. She remembered the day Nicole died, but she also thought of the happy times she spent with her friend; she also thought about feeling lost in the morning, but then she replaced that sad memory with a happier memory from her dream when she broke an evil curse, and was reunited with her imaginary family.[Chapter 31] Chapter 30 - A Happy Ending That night, before she went to bed, Becca looked at her library books. \"Horror,\" she said to the blue book, \"You helped me face the forces of evil. Every barrel has its bad apples, and Frankenstein's monster started as a good apple before he went wild at the sight of fire. You should always be aware of strangers.\" Becca looked at the green book and said, \"Mystery, you helped me step up when no one least expected it. I unknowingly helped Sherlock Holmes catch a criminal, and nobody else expected me to do so!\" She looked at the yellow book and said, \"Sci Fi, you helped me stay strong in times of danger. I rescued that time traveler and the Eloi girl, and later I rescued you from those awful morlocks! Standing up for friends is what loyalty is all about!\" Becca looked at the brown book and said, \"Adventure, you taught me the importance of standing up for myself. Those pirates wanted to kidnap me and make me a slave, but I gathered up all my strength and confidence, and then scared them away!\" Finally, she looked at the lavender book and said, \"Fantasy, I want to thank you for helping me face my biggest challenge yet – finding out who I am. Sure, I live a double life, but I didn't know that when I first came to Libralia! But you showed me the magic of imagination and what it means to find your destiny. Without your help, I probably wouldn't have gone to see the Page-, I mean, my imaginary grandfather again!\" She then climbed into bed and said to all the books, \"Good night, everybody. Tomorrow's Saturday, and I'll have lots of time to read you guys!\" With that, she turned off her lamp, took her glasses off and placed them on her bedside, and then drifted off to sleep. Sheila climbed onto Becca's bed and then set herself to sleeping next to her new mistress. In a dream, Becca looked around, and saw that she was back outside the palace in Libralia. This time, she was wearing the same dress she wore at her debutante ball, only it was all repaired, and she now had a golden brooch pin on the top-left side of her bodice. Something small and furry rubbed against the hem of her skirt, and the girl looked down. It was Sheila, who was happy to see her mistress as Princess Bethylasia! \"Sheila!\" the princess cried as she lifted the kitten in her hands, \"I think we'd better go into the palace!\" So the two of them walked in through the main doors, and a pair of royal guards bowed to the princess. A chamberlain beside the door blew a fanfare on his trumpet, and then announced, \"Her Royal Highness, Princess Bethylasia!\" Bethylasia looked around and saw a crowd of people clapping and cheering for her. Then she looked straight-on, and saw some familiar faces. The entire royal family was dressed in white and light gray clothing, with red sashes around their waists, and golden crowns with matching brooch pins on the top-left sides of their jackets and dress bodices. The Pagemaster was also watching from atop the grand staircase, with the Pagemistress's spirit right beside him; both of them smiled as they saw their granddaughter make her way towards her family. Bethylasia also saw all her book friends wearing the same outfits they wore when they were humans. Mystery happily sighed, \"It's good to see a family reunite and be together again.\" \"Yes,\" agreed Sci Fi, \"You know, Mystery, I've always wanted to have a second family of my own, too.\" Mystery beamed and asked, \"So, Sci Fi, I have been wondering this for a long time – will you marry me?\" He reached into his pages and pulled out a diamond ring. Sci Fi placed the ring on her finger and exclaimed, \"Of course I will! I've always wanted a man besides my father who would care about me and support me at all costs!\" She then placed her hands into Mystery's, and the two of them shared a passionate kiss. Adventure watched the scene and scoffed with disgust, \"Ah, love! Why do we always have to have a mushy-gushy scene at the end of these kinds of stories?\" \"Now, just a minute there, honey!\" said Fantasy with a smirk, \"Don't you wanna curl up with a good book, too?\" Adventure stammered, \"W-why, that's MY line!\" He became more speechless as Fantasy kissed him on the cheek, making him blush bright red. Horror playfully laughed at him and said, \"It's a happy ending, after all!\" Meanwhile, Bethylasia and Sheila had just finished making their way to the royal family. \"Mama! Papa!\" the princess said with high enthusiasm, \"Alexander! Donovan! Mirabelle! I'm so glad to be with all of you right now!\" \"The same goes for us, too, my child!\" said Matthias as he gave his daughter a hug, \"Your mother and siblings and I are glad that you have a chance to visit us tonight.\" \"Of course,\" added Natalia, \"For we are celebrating our reunion with all our storybook friends! Now let us join in the fun!\" Bethylasia smiled as she looked up at the top of the stairs. The Pagemaster smiled and winked at her, while the Pagemistress's spirit smiled before disappearing into the sky. Everyone then danced along with some joyful music while Bethylasia felt deep warmth in her heart; she knew that she didn't have to feel lost or afraid anymore, because she had new courage and confidence with the help of the imagination and literature. Back in reality, Becca smiled a content smile as she dreamed on. THE END ","Summary":" Prologue Once upon a time, there was a library. It was no ordinary library – it had a magical secre"}]
