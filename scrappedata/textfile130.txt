People will be OOC in this story. But this is fanfic so it shouldn't matter. Mac will still love killing people, cook/use meth, and is still crazy. But he will be nicer in a way. 'There's nowhere to hide.' I think as I watch the shadows start to close in on me. I scream when I feel them grab my arms and push me down on the bed. I feel something cover my mouth, I could smell the chemicals coming from the object. As everything starts to fade to black I see the face of my attacker come into view. As I wake up I notice my head is pounding. I look around and see that my arms and legs are no longer tied to the bed. Getting up I walk to the closet and grab an old plaid shirt. Once I have it on I start walking around the house to find I'm alone. I see a pair of car keys sitting on the counter. I move to grab them, but think better of it. If I took the car he'd find me easier. Opening the front door, I look around. Seeing no one around I walk outside and shut the door behind me. I see the old path that leads to town that is no longer used due to the terrain being unsafe. I start walking down the path, hoping he doesn't come back before I get to town. I've been walking for what felt like hours. My bare feet were cracked and starting to bleed from kicking to many rocks. I look ahead of me and let out a breath of relief as I walk up to the Luna Mesa. I don't see his car as I approach, but I recognize the old red pickup that's outside . 'Thank god, someone's here.' I think to myself as I stand in front of the door. As I walk in I notice there are only three others inside, all staring at me as I quickly scan to be sure he's not here. I walk over to the bar and sit at the end, away from the other two. The older guy, behind the bar, walks over. \"What can I get you?\" He asks, leaning on the counter. \"If it's not too much of an imposition could I just get some water, please.\" I say in a hushed tone. I lowered my head, staring at my hands. \"Sure thing, sweetheart.\" He says as he fills a glass with water. He places it in front of me then walks away, disappearing into the back. One of the other guys walks over, beer in his hand and takes a seat on the stool next to me. \"Hey I'm Devon.\" He says, holding out his hand for a handshake. \"L-L-Lizzy.\" I stutter out as I shake his hand. As I reach out he notices the bruised skin on my wrist. \"Sorry.\" I mutter as I hide my hands in my lap. \"What happened?\" Devon asks looking from my hands to my face, finally noticing the bruises and black eye. I look down at the floor in shame. I hear the stomping of boots and look up to see that the other guy has walked over and is pulling over a chair. \"My dad.\" I mumbled under my breath. \"What are you bothering her about, asshole?\" the new guy asks Devon. \"Nothing. I just asked her what happened to her face and hands.\" He says gesturing to my face. The new guy reaches up and grabs my chin making me look at him. I tense up when I feel his hands on me. \"Jesus. Looks like someone used her as a punching bag. Hey dumbass, go ask Walter for the first aid kit and some ice.\" He says to Devon, who immediately jumps up and goes to the back. \"Names Mac.\" He says letting go of my face to look at my wrists. Devon and the older guy walk back out with the first aid kit and some ice. ","Summary":" A/N: I will warn you now. People will be OOC in this story.

I could think of better ways to spend my weekend than being dragged along to some stupid family reunion – I didn't even go to my own family reunions, what had been going through Luke's mind when he'd agreed to drag me to his family's home? It kept my parents happy, I guess. \"Oh, c'mon…\" Luke sighed, squeezing my knee as he turned to look at me. \"How about we turn that frown upside down and go inside, hmm? I promise it will be alright once we're in there and you have a nice glass of wine in your hands.\" \"How about you stop talking to me like I'm three years old?\" I raised my eyebrows, pushing his hand off my leg and opening the car door. \"This just isn't exactly how I wanted to meet your parents for the first time, Lucas.\" \"We'll get our bags later, when everyone is leaving.\" \"But I want my-\" \"Darling, there are people inside alright, it's impolite for us to traipse in with our luggage…\" Lucas interrupted me, throwing an arm around my shoulders and guiding me into the house. I shook him off me, crossing my arms again and chewing the inside of my cheek as I looked around. \"Fix your hair, pull it out from behind your ears.\" \"Excuse me?\" I frowned at him. \"You look a little like a pixie when you wear your hair like that.\" \"Are you serious ? Jesus Christ, Luke,\" I rolled my eyes, but did as he asked. \"Much better!\" he smiled, pecking me on the lips. I huffed, letting him lead me further into the house – which, honestly, was a little more like a palace compared to what I used to. I hadn't known Luke's parents were so… well off . Obviously, my mother had, and I was betting that's why she'd set me up with him. He pushed open a door and I paused, the chatter from inside becoming louder and I looked around, feeling self-conscious at the amount of people in there. \"When can I get that glass of wine?\" I mumbled. \"Soon,\" he chuckled, pressing his lips to the top of my head \"Look, the bar is over there, why don't you go get a drink? My parents have paid for everything.\" Oh, of course. A bar. In someone's house . That was normal. I nodded at him and turned towards the bar, smiling nervously at the guy stood behind it. \"Uh… Can I have a large red wine, please? Like, as large as you can manage? And- wait, can I have a whiskey, too? Thanks,\" I nodded, watching as he turned around and grabbed a bottle of whiskey. I chewed on my bottom lip as I looked around, jumping when I saw a man sat leaning on the bar next to me. He looked as out of place as I did, his ratty jeans with his shirt hanging out of them matching my own clothes. \"I take it you've been dragged here against your will too, huh?\" I asked him. He eyed me curiously, looking me up and down as his lips curled up into a smirk. \"I fuckin' wish,\" he shook his head. \"Ain't one for all this family shit but they insist on invitin' me to these damn parties.\" \"You- you're related to them?\" I pursed my lips. \"Sorry, I didn't mean to offend, this just isn't really my thing. Oh, thank you,\" I looked up with a smile as my drinks were placed in front of me and I went to take hold of the small glass of whiskey, but the strangers hand reached out and swiped it away, lifting it up and downing it in one. \"Well, that's rude,\" I frowned. \"You don't look like a whiskey kinda girl,\" he shrugged his shoulders, pushing his sleeves up his arms. Oh. He had pretty nice arms. Big. Kind of tanned. Not like Luke's scrawny arms which hardly ever saw daylight because he was always shut away in his damn office. \"Oh?\" I raised an eyebrow. \"And what does a 'whiskey girl' look like?\" \"Kinda slutty. More skin on show. Looks like she'd drop to her knees soon as I unzipped my jeans.\" \"…Huh,\" I paused, swirling my wine around in the glass before taking a sip. \"Should have seen me this time last year. You definitely would have classed me as a whiskey girl.\" \"Fancy takin' a trip down memory lane?\" he grinned, his tongue snaking out over his lips as he took a step away from the bar, his finger fiddling with his belt buckle as I smirked at him. \"In the middle of a crowded room? Please, I have a little more class than that. I'm practically a lady now. Hey, can I have another whiskey seeing as this guy stole it?\" I pointed a thumb at him as I spoke to the bartender, who nodded with a chuckled and grabbed two glasses. \"What's your name, anyway?\" \"Why? Wanna know what you'll be screamin' later?\" \"Presumptuous,\" I scoffed. \"Wanna know who I need to file a restraining order against.\" \"Mac,\" Luke's voice came from behind me as he slipped an arm around my waist. \"I do hope you're not bothering my girlfriend?\" \"She's botherin' me,\" he – Mac – grunted. \"Ain't my fault you can't keep your bitch in line.\" \"Excuse me?\" I frowned. \"Offerin' to suck me off when she don't even know my name.\" \"I did no such thing!\" I spluttered. \"Oh my God, what's your problem?\" \"Here you go,\" the bartender whispered, pushing the glass of whiskey towards me and I screwed my eyes shut as Luke's arm tightened around my waist. \"Why are you drinking that disgusting drink again?\" he asked me. \"We talked about this on the way here, darling.\" \"I know we did, I-\" \"S'mine,\" Mac shot Lucas a look as he grabbed the glass. \"Well, that doesn't surprise me,\" Luke sneered at him. \"Cheap drink for a cheap guy.\" \"That why your Momma drinks it? S'in your parents stash, after all,\" Mac raised his eyebrows and I stifled a laugh as he drank the drink, slamming the glass down on the bar. \"That how your daddy likes 'em? Fast and easy?\" \"If he liked them fast and easy, Mac,\" Lucas took a step forward. \"He would have gone after your mother instead.\" \" Lucas ,\" I hissed, yelping as he jumped back when Mac took a quick step forward. \"Dammit, watch where you'd going, you stood on me!\" I grumbled, reaching down to rub my toe through my shoes. \"Come on, let's go and introduce you to my parents,\" he plastered a smile on his face as I picked up my glass of mine and he took my free hand in his before pulling me away. I looked at Mac, smiling apologetically and he shrugged his shoulders as he gestured for another whiskey. \"He didn't seem so bad…\" \"Stay away from him, beautiful,\" Lucas mumbled. \"He'd bad news, alright?\" \"Who is he?\" \"He's my cousin, Mac,\" he sighed. \"His… His mother was a whore, she was my mother's sister. She moved to the backend of nowhere and had this bastard kid with no dad in sight. She died and my mother vowed to take care of her Mac, no matter what. That's why he gets invited to these things, my mother feels like it's her duty. He's… He's not a nice guy, okay? He's dangerous. Just stay away from him.\" \"Okay,\" I whispered, turning to glance over my shoulder, my eyes connecting with Mac's as I bit my bottom lip. I'd always liked a little danger. *** Lucas stuck to my side for the rest of the night, frowning whenever he caught my eyes wandering over to where Mac was still leaning against the bar. His grip tightening on my arm or on my waist whenever he caught me looking over at his cousin and he'd constantly hiss in my ear that he was no good, that he didn't belong in their family, that he was a monster. I chose to ignore him. I could decide for myself. Mac was the kind of guy who I'd be interested in through my own choice – not like Lucas, who had been forced upon me by my parents after a particularly disastrous year which ended with me getting kicked out of college. Mac seemed like the guys who I'd used to surround myself with and so, when I saw him ducking outside, I excused myself as politely as I could from speaking with more of Luke's boring relatives by telling them I needed the bathroom. \"Excuse me,\" I hissed at a passing waitress, a tray of vol-au-vents in her hands. \"You didn't happen to see where- I mean, I'm looking for someone, he's taller than me and wearing jeans? He's uhm-\" \"He slipped out of the side entrance a couple of minutes ago,\" she smiled politely as she pointed towards a set of doors, shooting me a wink as she stepped away. \"Have fun, he's hot!\" \"Thanks,\" I laughed quietly and walked in the direction she'd pointed me in, slipping outside and closing the doors behind me quietly. \"He let you off the leash for a while, then. You followin' me?\" \"Well,\" I shook my head when Mac spoke from behind me and I turned around to face him. \"I think you wanted me to follow you. You made sure I was watching before you left.\" \"Ain't my fault you been watchin' me all night,\" he growled. \"Makin' eyes at me. I see what's goin' through your head, I ain't stupid. Been undressin' me with your eyes since you walked away.\" \"And you haven't been doing the same to me?\" \"Never said that,\" Mac grinned at me, shaking his head. \"Just wonderin' why. I know he told you I'm bad news.\" \"Lucas thinks everyone is bad news,\" I rolled my eyes at him. \"Yeah, he's right though, I am bad news.\" \"Hmm…\" I crossed my arms over my chest as I took a step back and looked him up and down. \"You don't seem so bad.\" \"You don't know the half of it, sweetheart.\" \"What have you done that's so bad, then?\" I asked, leaning backwards against the wall and watching as he took a drag of cigarette. \"I've done some pretty bad stuff, too.\" \"Not like me,\" he shook his head. \"Best get back inside before he comes lookin'. Can't promise I'll be nice to him this time.\" \"I'm sorry for what he said, about your mother,\" I whispered, frowning alright. \"Don't be. I ain't,\" he pulled a face. \"S'true,\" he told me and I paused, unsure of how to reply to that. \"He doesn't know he's picked up a whiskey girl, does he?\" \"What?\" I looked up at him. \"My cousin. He doesn't know what you're really like.\" \"Oh, and you do know what I'm really like?\" \"Yeah, guess I do,\" Mac flicked his cigarette to the ground and stepped closer to me, his voice dropping. \"See, a good, nice girl like he thinks you are wouldn't have followed me out here. Wouldn't have been eye-fuckin' me all night and wouldn't have told me she practically used to suck guys off for a livin'.\" \"I never said that,\" I frowned at him. \"I just implied that I used to do it for fun.\" \"A nice girl woulda stayed inside and acted like the perfect little girlfriend, made conversation with the parents, had a couple of drinks. By my count, I reckon you've knocked back a couple of bottle of wine by now.\" \"So you have been watching me then,\" I grinned up at him, his hand coming to rest on the wall against my head. \"And who said I was a nice girl?\" \"You're fuckin' dirty, knew it as soon as you walked in,\" Mac breathed in, his eyes closing as I ran my hand over the front of his jeans. \"So what are you gonna do about it?\" I hissed into his ear and he jerked back, his eyes dark as he slammed his lips on to mine, his tongue forcing his way into my mouth and I whimpered when he pressed me against the wall. He tasted delicious – a mix of whiskey and smoke, the faintest hint of something minty and I could smell the car oil on his clothes. I melted against him, my fingers hooking into his belt loops as I pulled him closer and he growled, his lips leaving mine and travelling down to my neck, his teeth sinking into my skin. \"Mac,\" I grumbled. \" Mac ,\" I put my hands on his chest and tried to push him away, but his hold tightened around my waist and I felt him pressing against my thigh. My eyes rolled back in my head as his fingers dipped into the waistband of my jeans and I moaned quietly, feeling him smirk against my neck. \"I ain't even started yet,\" he growled in my ear. I took the opportunity to push him away and his face hardened, his fists clenching as he opened his mouth to speak. \"Shut up,\" I grumbled, shaking my head and dropping to my knees, as I fiddled with his belt. \"Let me be one of your whiskey girls, Mac,\" I looked up at him with a smirk as I dragged his zipper down as slowly as I could. \"Oh, fuck,\" he hissed, grabbing a fistful of my hair as he hauled me off the ground. \"Someone's comin'.\" \"Yeah, you would have been if you hadn't stopped me,\" I mumbled. \"No, someone's fuckin' comin' outside. Come with me,\" Mac held on to my elbow and dragged me towards the front of the house, opening the door of a dusty red pick-up truck and shoving me inside. \"Stay the fuck down,\" he ordered, slamming the door shut after me. I was about to say something when I heard Luke's voice and I clamped a hand over my mouth to stop me from laughing. God, ten minutes with Mac was more excited than all the months I'd been with Lucas for. \"Where is she, what have you done with her?\" \"Who?\" Mac asked, a trace of mock innocence in his voice as I snorted quietly. \"Don't bullshit me, Mac, where is she ?\" \"Dunno who you mean, just came out for a smoke,\" Mac shrugged his shoulders and there was silence, until Lucas sighed loudly. \"Then why are your pants open?\" \"Oh,\" Mac paused. \"One of those cute little waitresses. Couldn't keep my hands off her, I'm done with her though if you want your turn? Y'know, if you can't keep yours under control.\" \"Stay away from her, Mac, I mean it. If anything happens to her-\" \"You'll what ?\" Mac interrupted with a snarl and I bit back a laugh when I saw Lucas jump backwards, his face red. \"S'what I thought. Run back to your little party, pretty boy. I'm goin' home,\" he grumbled, turned round and looking at me through the window of his truck as I raised my eyebrows. \"The fuck you still here for, Lucas? Ain't my problem if you can't keep your girl happy. Maybe she's fuckin' one of the waiters. The bar guy was makin' eyes at her, too.\" \"I-if you see her, tell her I'm looking for her.\" \"No,\" Mac huffed in reply and I shook my head with a grin as Lucas turned around to walk away. Mac pulled open the door of his truck and pushed me over to the other side, climbing in himself and turning the keys in the ignition. \"Ain't stayin' here. We're goin' back to my place.\" \"Wh- I can't I don't have any clothes or anything with me,\" I protested, leaning over him to open the door. He grabbed my wrist, smirking as he placed my hand just above his boxers and looked at me. \"You ain't gonna need any clothes, whiskey girl,\" he told me. I paused before I let the grin take over my face, my hand slipping into his boxers as he grunted. \"Well in that case,\" I whispered, my tongue tracing his earlobe. \"Take me home, Mac.\" ","Summary":" Sighing, I uncrossed my arms from across my chest and unbuckled my seatbelt, pulling a face as I lo"},{"Movie":"Lilo & Stitch","Title":"Stitch's Christmas Special","Author":"TheNaturalLlama3","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13087963","Passage":"[Chapter 1] It was a sunny day in Kawaii. The air was warm, but there was a cool breeze coming off the ocean. It had been almost a year following the events of Leroy and all was peaceful. But anyone who was anyone knew that something great was coming up. The people were bustling around in a rush, some wearing special hats, and others putting special decorations up. That's right. It was soon to be Christmas. In three days in fact, and people were rushing to buy gifts. All was merry and cheerful, everyone was excited for the upcoming holiday. All except one little girl who just got world shattering news. \"What?! What do you mean we can't have Christmas this year?!\" Lilo shouted at her older sister. Nani was rushing to leave for work and wasn't too happy that this was her only time to break the news to her sister. \"I'm sorry Lilo, I just don't have the money this year. I'm really sorry baby\" She apologised to Lilo at her level. Lilo shoved her away \"Sorry's not good enough!\" While this was going on, Stitch looked on from the table confused. While he got the main concept of Christmas, he still had a lot to learn about it. Pleakley was running around in a panic like it was the end of the world. \"No Christmas? No Christmas?! Oh no! No stockings? No lights, no tree?! Oh the horror!\" he cried falling to the floor. Jumba just huffed. His planet never had any celebrations of the sort and while he did like Christmas, he wasn't about to throw a fit because they couldn't have one that year. \"Relax Pleakley, is not end of world. Besides, that gives evil genius more time for inventions\" Jumba said getting up from the table and heading back to his bedroom/lab. Lilo ran to her room in tears and Nani rushed out of the house for work. After shoving his breakfast down his throat, Stitch ran after Lilo who was heartbroken and sobbing. Stitch knew better than to try and help her when she's this upset, so he waited until she was done crying to let her vent. It was quiet for a few minutes after Lilo's crying ended and Lilo pulled out her burnt family photo. \"Christmas was always a time where you could enjoy and remember the best parts of your family. It's the time where I could always remember my parents and be happy even if they weren't there. Now we don't even have a Christmas to remember our ohana\" Lilo said to Stitch, sniffling. Stitch looked down, ears at his sides. He still had so much to learn about Christmas and Ohana. Stitch went to give Lilo a hug, but she leaned away from it. \"Just leave me alone Stitch\" she said pulling the covers over her and laying on her pillow. Stitch recalled her doing this same thing on the anniversary of her parent's death. He just let her be and went down to talk to Jumba and Pleakley. Pleakley was still moaning and groaning about not having Christmas while Jumba was busy building something. \"No Christmas. No Christmas….Oh life how could you do this to me…\" Pleakley whined dramatically. \"Oh stop you're whining Pleakley, there's always next year\" Jumba said irritably. Stitch was sitting on the same table that Jumba's new invention was being made. He pushed up his goggles and waited for the metal of his new invention to cool. \"So little girl is having hard time with no big holiday to enjoy, yes?\" he asked to Stitch. Stitch nodded in reply looking devastated at everything that was happening. \"Is not looking like you are taking it well either\" Jumba commented. Stitch looked up at him, but looked back down. \"Well, if 626 is not liking outcome of older sisters words then changing it. Is was evil genius did anytime someone else bested Jumba in test score\" he said poking at the metal box. While it was a small comment, it gave Stitch probably the best idea he had since first saving Lilo. \"Aha!\" Stitch jumped up in joy, startling Jumba to burn a part of metal he wasn't supposed to and making Pleakley jump up from his bed and hit his head. \"I got it! Takka Jumba!\" Stitch said, giving his creator a swift hug and running out of the room. \"Oh great. It's bad enough that we don't have Christmas, but now the Little Monster's got an idea\" Pleakley said, rubbing his sore head. While Pleakley, Jumba, and Lilo were all carrying about their day at the house, Stitch was busy running around the island, going to each of his cousins. He could be seen at Slushie's stand giving him an invitation, at the Jail giving Bonnie and Clyde a temporary let out, at Sparky's lighthouse giving him batteries, and finally Kixx's beach workout place. While everyone was busy, he took his red police cruiser up into space and sped towards Turo to meet up with Reuben and Gantu. \"Aloha!\" Stitch said to the Grand Councilwoman when he found her. \"Stitch? What are you doing here?\". \"Agata Reuben and Gantu?\" he asked. \"Oh, if you're looking for Captain Gantu and his officer Reuben, you may find them in their headquarters\". Stitch nodded and thanked her, running down the hall until he found their headquarters. \"Cousin Stitch?\" Reuben asked when he opened the door. \"Aloha Cousin!\" Stitch said cheerfully, giving Reuben a hug. The two had become more friendly towards each other since the Leroy incident. They actually found out they had a lot more in common than they originally thought. \"Hey cuz! What's with the surprise visit?\" Reuben asked. The ground shook with each giant footstep as Gantu approached. \"Experiment 626? What are you doing here?\" he asked. Stitch handed them both fancy Christmas cards. \"Oh, I get it. It's that fancy holiday back on Earth, right?\" Reuben said. \"Ih! Nani naga have money, so Stitch planning this year!\" Stitch said. \"Well, I can't say taking a night off of this job will be easy, but I'll see what we can do\" Gantu said looking down at Stitch. \"Takka. Nice seeing you cousin!\" Stitch waved. And off he was again. The next three days went by as a blur for both Lilo and Stitch. Until Christmas night, that is. Lilo was sitting on the couch with Jumba, Pleakley, and David, watching Dr. Seuss's \"How The Grinch Stole Christmas\". Lilo looked worn out and blank at the movie. Everyone else was chilling out. At the scene where The Grinch ran off with the gifts, Nani had returned home. She looked fairly upset at the gloom in the air when she arrived. \"Aloha Nani\" David greeted. \"Hey David\" she replied a little awkwardly. She got down to her knees when approaching her sister. \"Baby…\" \"It's ok Nani. I just want to watch the movie\". Nani sighed and sat down next to her 9 year old sister, pulling her into her lap. They watched the movie, unbeknownst of the little aliens waiting outside for the right moment. That moment came at the movie scene when The Grinch's heart grew 3 sizes. Stitch listened and walked through the doggie door. Everyone looked at the excited blue experiment as he ran over to Lilo and began to lightly, but eagerly tug Lilo's arm. \"What? What is it Stitch?\". He didn't just tug Lilo though. He pulled on Nani's pants and motioned for everyone to follow him. Nani switched the TV off and they followed Stitch out to the porch. \"Ta Ka!\" He shouted. Angel, Sparky, Slushy, and Kixx were outside. \"Oh, hi guys, what are you doing here?\" Lilo asked curiously. Everyone else looked confused. In her time living on Earth, Angel learned to speak English. \"Because we have a Christmas tradition to celebrate!\" Angel spoke. Sparky zapped around them in agreement. \"Tradition? What kind is my experiments having?\" Jumba asked. \"Lilo!\" Stitch piped up. \"What?\" she asked dully, misjudging the question. \"Naga, Lilo isa tradition!\". Everyone was quiet with confusion. \"Huh?\". \" Sure it's nice to open a gift, that's tied up with a perfect bow… \" Angel sang while putting a Christmas bow tie in Lilo's hair. \" ...but the greatest present of all was given to me long ago… \" she continued. \" ...it's something I would never trade, it's the family that we've made… \" Stitch sang. While not Angel quality, his voice wasn't horrible either. \" Cause when we're together, I have everything on my list.. \" Angel continued. Lilo's eyes lit up as they sang. \"... and when we're together, I have all I wished… \" Stitch sang as he wrapped an arm around Lilo's shoulder. Slushy blew a small ice tree right next to Lilo as the song continued. \" ...All around the Christmas tree, there'll be dreams coming true… \" Angel went, grabbing Lilo and Stitch's arms in a follow-the-leader type way around the small tree. Stitch spun Lilo around as he took the next verse. \" ...But when we're together! Then my favorite gift, is youuuu! \" Stitch motioned out to the walkway where Sparky grabbed Slushy and flew across the path. Slushy, while in the air, blew on the ground, creating an ice pathway for Lilo. She looked at Stitch for approval before running through the pathway, giggling all the while. They continued down the path, along with the song. Both Angel and Stitch sang while holding Lilo's hands. \"... I would travel miles and miles and, I would follow any star. I would go almost anyplace, if it's anyplace you are! \" They sang, leading the family to a secret pond, pre-frozen by Slushy. All of Stitch's cousins were there. Tables of food, sandwiches, and desserts were set up, and everyone was enjoying the gathering. \" ...Cause when we're together, I'll forever feel at home! \" Stitch and Angel sang. Lilo looked on in wonder as a few cousins gave her gifts. \" ..and when we're together, we'll be saafe and warm! \" they sang, skating around the ice with Lilo. \" ...Doesn't matter where we are. If you're there with mee! \" they sang, excitingly pulling Lilo a little more in the middle of the lake then the other experiments. Stitch nodded at Sparky and Slushy as he sang. \" ...but when we're together! That's my favorite place, to bee! \" they sang, gesturing in front of them as Sparky flew Slushy in a circle, allowing Slushy to create the biggest Christmas tree Lilo ever saw. Only, it was ice. \" ...Cause when we're together! It's a holiday, every night! And when we're together, then the season's bright! \" Stitch sang, gesturing to Sparky, who zipped through a few lamps, catching them on his tail, and circling them onto the new tree. \"... I don't need the bells to ring. I'll know when it's heeeeeere!\" Angel and Stitch sang softly as Slushy blew his ice one last time, creating the star to the tree. Stitch gave it to a crying Lilo. Sparky flew her up to the top to let her place the star on the tip of the tree.\" ...cause when we're together! I could stay forever. And when we're together… \" \" ...It's my faaavorite time… \" Lilo sang as she was set back on the ground. Then they all ended together. \" ..of yeear! \". Lilo sniffed and wiped her eyes. Stitch's ears fell. \"Lilo...naga happy?\" he asked. She just laughed and jumped into his arms. \"Of course I'm happy silly! I couldn't be happier!\" She pulled away, but Stitch still looked confused. \"If happy...why Lilo crying?\". She laughed while Nani bent down to explain. \"They're tears of joy. Humans cry when they have too much emotion inside of them. Not just when they're sad, but when they're happy too\" She said, poking his nose. Stitch perked up in understanding. Lilo gave Stitch and Angel the biggest hug of her life. \"Thank you guys! This is the best Christmas ever!\". The two accepted the hug gladly, although Angel said \"But it was his idea to do this\". \"It was? So that's where you've been the past 3 days!\" Lilo shouted in realization. Everyone laughed at that. \"Male kellikakiki maka!\" Stitch shouted. \"Ugh Stitch, no! It's Mele Kalikimaka!\" Lilo corrected. \"I thought we went over this!\" Everyone laughed again at that. And it did turn out to be one of Lilo's best Christmases ever. Reuben and Gantu showed a little later, but they made it nonetheless. Lilo only received a few gifts from closer cousins, but she enjoyed it. The following days Myrtle and the group would brag about their gifts, but anytime she'd try to size up Lilo, Lilo would just say her present wasn't a pretty gift in a bow, but it was her family. The group would look at her weird, but she'd just smile and say they would understand when they're older. Author's Note: Hey, hey, hey!

Everyone had fallen asleep before the storm had gotten bad, so the loud thunder and bright lightning was falling on deaf ears. Well, almost everyone. A small blue alien known by the numbers 626 and the name Stitch was huddled into a ball on his bottom bunk. With large floppy ears, huge black eyes, and deep blue fur, Stitch was designed to be an unstoppable monster with no fear of anything, water not included. But, with every crack of lightning he flinched, and with every boom of thunder he whined in fear. In his light turquoise onesie, he trembled and held onto a plush turtle trying to will himself to sleep. It was all for not, as whenever he came close to the bliss of sleep, another crack or boom would shake him awake. Pride alone is what kept him from seeking comfort from his new Ohana thus far. His creator Jumba Jookiba designed him to be able to handle himself in nearly every situation. Deserts, Jungles, Tundras, you name it. Which only begged the question for Stitch: why was he curled up in fear by a simple storm? Was it the noise? The little blue experiment thought so. He buried his paws into his ears, but it did little to drown out the raging storm. He thought the storm would have been a quick one, one that would last for a few minutes, but it only worsened as time went on. Along with his fear. Finally, after a ton of stalling the experiment had enough. He jumped up, and clung to the bottom of his new friend's bunk. He crawled on her bed and tried to wake her up. \"Lilo? Lilo!\" he cried, shaking her, but in her deep sleep she only swatted him away. Said little girl was a small, Hawaiian girl a tad taller than the experiment with long black hair and deep brown eyes. While young and ignorant, the small girl had claimed the heart of the once raging monster before her over a month ago. She and her older sister were struggling with the loss of their parents until the miracle that was their new Ohana came from space. It was a rough start, but had a happy ending nonetheless. There was a flash of lightning followed shortly by a ground-shaking boom. \"Ahh!\" Stitch screamed, clinging to his friend who somehow managed to stay asleep through all of this. The house creaked from the wind and Stitch could hear every raindrop that smacked into the house. Lilo was dead asleep, so she wasn't going to be able to help him. He flinched at a softer flash of lightning and jumped down from Lilo's bunk and ran down the stairs. He ran into Nani's room, Lilo's 18 year old sister, and tried to shake her awake. The thing with Nani was she hadn't gotten used to all the aliens living with her, and it was only Lilo who could wake her up at night or she'll stay asleep, much like her sister. So when Stitch tried to shake her awake, there was no result. \"Nani?! Nani, up! Up, s..storm b..bad!\" he cried. His English, while improving, wasn't very good. He shrieked at another flash and boom. Tears leaked out of his eyes as he charged out of Nani's room and into the hall. He ran up the stairs that led to his creator's and Pleakley's room, Lilo's old one. Now, Jumba was the last person Stitch wanted to go to in fear, afraid of making his creator disappointed. He was gasping in breaths of fear, too caught up in his own needs, Stitch forgot how easily afraid Pleakley was of him. So when he jumped into Pleakley's bed and shook him awake, Pleakley screamed. \"AHH! MONSTER!\" Pleakley cried, shoving Stitch out of his bed. What he said cut deep into Stitch, but another crack of lightning, one close enough to feel, had him scream and dart under the bed. Tears streamed down his face, and he pressed his back to the wall, pulling his small legs to his chest. All the noise woke Jumba, and Pleakley shakily turned on the light. \"Pleakley, would you stop making loud noises and let evil genius sleep?\" he asked. \"Well, maybe if you had better control of your little monster, I wouldn't be waking up screaming!\" Pleakley ranted. Jumba sat up and rubbed the left side of his face, four eyes slanted from the light. \"626? Why would he be comings to our room in middle of night?\" Jumba asked. A crack of thunder that got both Jumba and Pleakley jumping was there answer. \"Little Monster? It's ok, you can come out now\" Pleakley said in a calmer tone, looking under the bed. Stitch didn't move, only flinching at the storm. Jumba came down from his top bunk. \"Yeesh, is bad storm\" he commented. He noticed where Pleakley was looking. \"Is alright 626, can be coming out now\" He said. Once again, Stitch didn't react, only keeping his head buried in his arms. He screamed when a sudden boom of thunder knocked the power out. He whimpered and whined, full out crying now. \"Oh no! The power's out! Jumba hold me!\" Pleakley cried, clinging to Jumba. \"Ack! Get off me you one eyed noodle!\" he replied, shoving Pleakley off. He opened the drawer of his desk and pulled out a flashlight. Through the storm however, Stitch's crying became apparent to both of them. The sound of his experiment crying was heartbreaking, but quite the shock to Jumba, though he's never admit it. \"Pleakley, can you be going to get cup of water for 626?\" He spoke. \"Wait, you...you mean...out there? As in, where there's no light?\" he asked nervously. Jumba just rolled his eyes, shoving his flashlight into Pleakley's hands. \"A scared 626 is not being one you wanna mess with. Unless, you want to be getting him out and Jumba can get water?\" Jumba offered. Pleakley just gulped and left the room, taking the light with him. Stitch whimpered again. Jumba pulled out another flashlight and got to his stomach. Now that he could see, Jumba saw his newest creation trembling against the wall, ears flickering towards every sound. \"It's alright 626, you can be coming out\". At hearing his creator's voice so close, Stitch froze completely. \"Come out 626. Nothing to be scared of\" Jumba pressed. Stitch peeked a terrified eye out at his creator. \"Naga...mad?\" he barely whispered. \"Mad? Why would Jumba be being mad?\" he asked. \"Cause Stitch...Stitch is s..scared\" he whimpered out. Jumba didn't understand why his creation would think him mad at being afraid. He never got mad before when his experiment was scared. \"No my little one. Jumba is not being mad at 626\". Stitch felt a little better knowing his creator wasn't mad, but the ache of fear was still very much present in his chest. Slowly, he uncurled himself and went to crawl out, but another boom made him jump back against the wall. \"Hey, shhh\" Jumba continued. Stitch looked back at his creator, who at that moment, stretched his arm out at Stitch. \"Is alright, no need to be scared\" he soothed. Slowly, Stitch finally came out, Jumba rubbing his back. \"There we go, is no need to be scared. Of storm, or creator\" he said. Stitch jumped again at a crack of lightning, but to his surprize, the fear didn't overwhelm him like it did before. Jumba picked him up and held him against his chest, rubbing slow circles on his back. \"Shhh, is alright. Jumba is here\". Pleakley came in that moment with a glass of water. Jumba grabbed it and set it on the table next to him, taking a seat in his chair. \"Is he ok?\" Pleakley asked. Jumba nodded in reply. \"Will be just fine. Can be going back to sleep if you are liking\". Pleakley said no more as he got back into bed. Jumba stayed up, however, as he knew if Stitch ran into his room from the storm, he wasn't able to sleep. Not on his own at least. Stitch at the moment, was trembling in Jumba's arms, crying softly into his chest. Jumba just continued to soothe him, letting him cry and nuzzle him. Thankfully as if the storm was holding out, it began to lessen which helped Jumba calm his creation. Stitch eventually stopped crying and shaking, but he didn't plan on letting go of his creator anytime soon. Jumba on the other hand had what Stitch said nagging him. \"626?\" he asked eventually. An ear flicked to let him know he was listening. \"Why think Jumba mad at 626?\" At the mention, Stitch tensed up again. It was silent for a few minutes after that. The rain had turned into a shower, and thunder could be heard moving away from the house. \"Cause Stitch...naga s..sup..posed to b..be scared\". Jumba could put the rest together. His creation was afraid of being scared because he was designed not to be afraid. Jumba chuckled a little at the irony. \"Yes, you were designed to not be afraid of anything big or small. But were also designed to never have family. Look at 626 now. Made family of Jumba, little and older girls, and one eyed noodle\" he started. Pleakley spoke up, sounding offended. \"I heard that!\". Stitch choked back a laugh, beginning to relax. He looked up at his four eyed creator. \"Point is 626, is no telling how you'll turn out. Passed all expectations Jumba made for you; still are passing them now. If you are being scared of something like storm, is completely normal. Would scare anyone to pieces if they're awake\". Stitch nodded in reply, burying his face back into Jumba's chest. \"Get some rest 626\" Jumba said, getting up and going back to his own bed, small experiment in hand. Now that someone was there with him, Stitch fell back asleep quite easily. Pulling the covers over his little blue creation, Jumba watched Stitch fall fast asleep, nuzzling his chest and cuddling close. \"Passed all expectations indeed. Goodnight my little one\" Jumba whispered to no one in particular, shutting his own eyes and heading back to sleep.

The Grand Councilwoman took a seat on her bed, a little anxious of the day to come. It was her first term of being the Grand Council member, and tomorrow was to be her first Unnatural Ceremony of her time. Her former Superior, and father had taken over in her place until she was 2 years into her role, and now she was to bring an unnatural being into the universe. To other galaxies this practice was forbidden, as the talent of the Unnatural could be of great help, or great destruction. The only reason their galaxy still did this was for science and knowledge only. The rules they agreed on were to be no more than a thousand of them created, any whose talent was a threat to life as it was known was to be put down if seen unworthy, and they were to be treated as equals; so not give any rightful reasons to behave out of line. The government decided that to keep the order, and to not overwhelm the scientists that one shall be brought to life every 4 years. Incase the latest one was too much to handle. During the ceremony, each new life was to be given a random number, for science purposes she did not fully understand. Her role was to greet the new life in peace and happiness, as well as being the first to give her energy for a stable pulse in the new life. It's hard to explain, but all will be answered the next day. The Council Woman has seen many Unnaturals created in her time, some friendly and helpful, others mean and dangerous. A total of 48 out of the 700 that already exist have been judged unworthy of their life and put to death. Her only worry is that one would appear in her rule that could change the course of life. Forever. If only she knew what was to come from that statement. Chapter 1: EX-626 Jookiba's POV It was a chilly spring night on planet Turo, and normally I would feel annoyed at everyone and everything that got in my way. But not tonight. Tonight was the Annual Unnatural Ceremony. The ceremony where another experiment would be brought to life by the Grand Councilwoman herself. She had done so twice already, bringing to life Experiment 010, a.k.a. Felix into the world, abilities pronounced in the Useful column of the talents. He was a neat freak, needing to clean everything dirty. Sadly when there isn't anything to clean, he tends to eat anything old in his reach. This problem was solved when the government relocated him to planet Mechlon, a planet full of factories that constantly need cleaning. She also brought to life Experiment 300, a.k.a Spooky. He's a shapeshifter that is meant to form into anyone's worst fear. He started out bad, but was turned good when his talent was put to use in therapy. He's now used to help people with strong phobias, traumas, and other various problems to recover or get over their fears. I know from first hand he does a terrifying impression of my Ex-Wife. I shuddered in memory. His talent was pronounced as Random. But, the ceremony itself isn't what I was afraid of. For the past 8 years since I've worked with the Scientific Defense Industry, I've studied, monitored, and on the rare occasion taken care of these experiments. 10 months ago, though, I was nominated and chosen as the lead scientist to take care of the next experiment to come. ME! And for the past 10 months, that's what I've been training to do. Being a purebred Kweltiquanian, my brain is initially better than most; not to brag or anything. One of the top GPAs of the modern universe. A 336.945 GPA. Thinking it over, I guess it wasn't a complete mystery as to why I was chosen. Bringing me back to the present, I walked the nearly empty halls of the normally busy HSDGF ( Head Science Department of the Galactic Federation ), heading towards the elevator. I know I'd taken care of experiments before, but that was never a full time commitment. This? This was a huge responsibility. Like taking care of a new pet. And not to worry anyone, but I'm the last person you'd wanna trust with this kind of thing. I can barely take care of myself, let alone another living being. I would have said no if I could, but saying no would be like saying I didn't qualify as a head scientist of my position in the HSDGF. I knew I wasn't truly prepared for this, but my whole life has been learning everything I could about everything. History, Math, Science… You name it, I know it. I was always the top of my classes, always appreciated by teachers and schools. But never by my family or people around me. So I figured if I can learn the hardest of Quantum Physics, I can learn to take care of an experiment. But, socially, I'm not the most healthy alien. That's due to family issues. Mostly because I was never enough for my father, always 2nd or 3rd, and always extra weight to my mother. She would have aborted me had she had the money. My older siblings were their dream children, never me. Which is why I dedicated myself so much into learning, to give me a reason to think I was more than what my parents cracked me up to be. They even went as far as to marry me off to that devilish hag MaryBerth. That's one year of my life I'll never get back. My heartbeat quickened as I approached the elevator to go down to the front. I was so nervous. As the numbers ticked down, level by level, I suddenly felt like it was taking hours. By the time I got down to the first level, my nerves gave me as Earthlings would call it, a knot in my stomach. I walked through the front door and saw cameras flashing, others recording, scientists from other galaxies, and crowds of local people. There were also military soldiers guarding every square inch of the place. I walked past the herd of reporters, all asking me random questions. \" How are you feeling right now, ? \", \" What made you accept this position in an experiment's life, Dr. Jookiba? \", \" What name are you thinking of giving the experiment when it's created? \". The last question stuck with me. And yes, the lead scientist does in fact get to name the experiment and it's number. I thought about that as I walked into my spot on the stage, awaiting the Grand Council Woman's arrival. 'Jumba does not want to be giving silly name such as 'Jumba' like parents did; is wanting to be giving it name that fits' I thought. If it's talent was something like a steamer, then obviously he'd call it steamer. But if it was something like a….like a plant grower, then that would be different. My thoughts left me as the crowd started up again. The Grand Councilwoman had arrived. She was a rare breed called a Speckdomoses. Most of her kind died off when her race was split due to a dying planet. I watched as she elegantly walked up the steps, her outfit proclaiming her position in the galaxy. She silenced everyone with the wave of her hand. \"It has been 4 years since the last gathering of the experiments. And 4 years since an Unnatural has joined our universe. Tonight we welcome another new creature with uncanny abilities, strange new customs, and above all, a new part of the Galactic Union.\" She spoke loudly, but wisely. \"Chosen by Turo's greatest minds, we have Dr. Jumba Jackson Jookiba as this new creation's head scientist and health inspector, Proffeser Nani Pelekai as it's guidance and head nurse, Dr. Wendy Alexander Pleakley as it's agriculture and head planetary teacher, and finally Dr. Joc Von Hamsterviel as it's secondary scientist and observer\". My eyes widen as they announce the annoying rodent's name. I look to my left to see the others in order. A dark Earth female with brown eyes, lighter brown, curly hair, and standing about my chin height. Next to her I was expecting a female from the name Wendy, but found a male one eyed noodle who was shorter than the Earth girl. A Plorganarian. And after that, just as promised, a small white gerbil sat on a small hovercraft, with beady red eyes, and a small red cape that matched. He seemed the only one without nicer things on. I was broken from my thoughts as the currently existing experiments were brought to their special spots. They were to bring small samples of their talents for the new life to pick from. \"Now, let the ceremony begin!\" The Council Woman stated. I might be thinking coherently, but my throat was retracted in nerves. If I was supposed to speak, I wouldn't have been able to. At that moment, some side scientists brought out a clear glass container containing a mixture of vitamins for a natural being to survive in, along with some heavily spiritual herbs inside. It was placed under a VERO 30,000 series, a high electricity weapon created to disable power in planets within a 4 billion light year radius. Least to say, it wasn't something to be tampered with. Before it was activated thought, an invisible force field was placed around the circle, making it so whatever power was in there, stayed in there. I pulled out my Turo Amber Goggles like everyone else and the VERO was turned on. A light so bright burned through the goggles into my four eyes. So much so, I had to look away. Minutes later, the light died down and a glowing fluorescent mass floated out of the glass container. It looked like a floating fluid, which it most likely was. It had a faint green pulse go through it every few seconds. The strange thing was, It had a glowing cell in it's center. It was supposed to die down, but after a few seconds, it stayed. That could only mean trouble. In both ways. It swayed an end around like a head and seemed to look around. It had no form, no eyes, ears, nose, or mouth. Just a mass. \"Made of matter, brought to life by power, we have created you here. I hope you made your way alright\" the Grand Councilwoman said. It tilted it's 'head' to the side in question. \"Allow me to help that pulse of yours\". She said softly. Walking down onto the platform, she held her hand out, placing it on it's 'head'. It's pulse glowed brighter until it remained a bright glowing green. She backed away and on que, 10 different pedestals rose around it. An experiment of each different category came down and placed a representation of it's talent down for it to choose. The categories being Elements, Random, Construction/Destruction, Natural, Unnatural, Useful, Strange, Exotic, Power, and Useless. Now it was my time to act. I stepped down from the stage onto the platform where this creation was hovering. It seemed to sense me as it flew towards me in a tense ease. Strange how it looked. I stayed still and waited for it to get used to my presence when something historical happened. A 'limb' as I'll call it reached out to touch me. It stopped halfway, as if waiting for me to respond. A bunch of gasps could be heard, but I paid no mind. I felt trapped in the moment; in a good way. This thing was making moves not even thought possible for it! Wanting to make contact, but stopping before doing so in an attempt to keep peace, I was, as you could say, awestruck. I moved my hand up to it and let it touch me. The area felt numb and hot, but cold and on fire all at once. I have no idea why, but the moment had me feeling emotional and had made it feel like the most real thing that's happened to me in years. It pulled away as the lights from under each talent caught it's attention. But the hot/cold feeling stayed in my hand as if it left a part of itself in me. I took out my E-Pad and recorded what just happened, as well as what was. The mass flew around the different pedestals, coming to a stop at the Ever-changing Fire/Water/Flower/Cloud of the Elements category. It touched the cloud with it's 'head' and it went down, signifying that wasn't it's talent. It backed away skittishly, looking at the Grand Councilwoman, but she urged him on. I recorded the results. Next he stopped at a lit lightbulb for the Power section. It touched it and it fell, turning off. Another strange thing about this is they usually know their talent by first or second pick. It went through the Useful and Exotic sections, but still no result. Then fate had decided there wasn't enough history made today. As it passed by the Hammer for Construction/Destruction, it gravitated up on its own. The lifting of the hammer got the mass' attention and it stopped. It flew back towards the hammer and once again hesitated on if it should touch it or not. After a good five seconds, two 'limbs' came out to grab it, but pulled back again, unsure. But then reached out and finally grabbed the hammer. Light suddenly shot through the mass, giving it a faint outline of a white creature with long ears and large eyes before it got too bright to look at. Once the light faded, a small, blue creature stood before us. It had an oval shaped head with large black eyes, large ears that went another foot off it's head with a large, dark blue nose. It had 4 arms and 3 back spines with a stubby tail. It's coloring was mainly a soft grey/sapphire blue, dark blue splotches on its head and back, with light blue around its eyes and going down from it's chin to its lower stomach. It blinked a few times before looking down at itself for the first time. It looked at it's back and finally looked around. It began to look nervous and curled in on itself, holding the hammer close. I made myself known to it by getting up from my one knee. It still held the same skittish look as it jerked it's head over at me. I stopped a foot from it and kneeled again. I looked it straight in the eyes and said softly and quietly \"It's alright, my little one. You are being safe\". It's eyes grew a bit calmer and it took a step closer to me. It held out a paw, much like before it gained physical form. I smiled gently and held the same hand it had touched me with before out. When it touched my hand I instantly knew he was a boy. I could also feel his unease and his fear. I noticed when he touched me his spines fell and he uncurled himself a little. The Grand Councilwoman announced \"Now, Jookiba may name him, and may assign a number for him within 010-032, 113-154, 223-245, 301-303, 482-500, 503-524, and 620-644. Anything outside of those has already been taken\". But taking one look at him, I already knew what his number was. And his name. \"Allowing me to introduce myself. My name is being Dr. Jumba Jookiba, but you can be calling me Jumba. You are being experiment number 626\" I proclaimed loud enough for others to hear. \"Welcome to the 21st century, Stitch \" I said softly, naming him. He seemed to catch my drift as his ears twitched in happiness and a smile grew on his face. I couldn't help but smile back. The whole area erupted into cheers after that. Normally public displays of any loud noise would get me into a damp mood, but the crowd's cheers fell into deaf ears and I was once again caught in the moment with my 626. ' My 626. I am liking the sound of that \" I thought. Maybe this won't be so bad for me after all. He looked down and placed the hammer into his bottom, left hand and raised his arms to me to be picked up. After everything, I couldn't say no to that. I picked him up and carried him up to the stage. He looked around more curious, than cautious now and held on to me, though it was not needed. We approached the Grand Councilwoman. \"Yes, welcome indeed Experiment 626\" She announced. He looked at her for a second before holding his hand out to her. She held it and he relaxed, seeming to recognize her presence. \"Now Experiment 626 will be taken to his training room where he will learn to control his Constructive or Destructive talents. There he will stay for the next 4 years until he's able to control himself. Once he does he will have earned his name and his place in our galaxy\" She announced. \"You know what to do, Dr. Jookiba\". I smiled and replied \"Yes, Jumba is knowing\". I carried him off the stage as the Councilwoman finished the ceremony off. The others who will help teach him followed me to my lab room. The Earth girl smiled at him. \"Hello there\" she said kindly. He looked at her and tilted his head. \"Can you say hello back?\". I looked down at him as he figured out how to work his voice. \"Err…..he….heh...looo\". It sounded adorable. ' Adorable? Come now Jumba, don't be losing head because pair of large eyes ' I thought. \"Come on, little guy, you can do it\" she urged. \"He..lo….Hell..o..Hello\" He managed to say. \"Theere we go. Good job!\" She praised. He smiled, showing off a full set of razor sharp teeth. The Plorganarian did not like that. \"Ahh! It...it's got...sharp teeth!\" he said, cowering behind the Earth girl. 626 looked on, confused. \"Ah, calming down one-eyed noodle. If all goes well, shouldn't have reason to be using sharper teeth\" I said. If you were a really big nitpicker like the Earth female, you would have caught the humor in my voice. This was not the case with the noodle, as he looked even more terrified. \"Ha, ha, ha, don't encourage him\" the Earth girl said. I smiled a little evilly at her. That's when I noticed how quiet the gerbil was being. \"Has been long time, Hamsterviel\". He chuckled. \"You and you're oh-so-very genius mind have gotten greatest honor of all. I would be lying if I said I wasn't a little jealous\". I stayed cool on the outside, but couldn't help the feeling of unease that settled into my stomach. I could hear the hints of evil lingering in his voice. \"Wait, you two know each other?\" The noodle asked. \"Yes, are old college friends\" I said. It was quiet after that. I looked down at 626 and noticed he was falling asleep. \"Please to be keeping awake, 626. Need to be running some tests on what your talent is bringing\". He jerked his head up when I talked, but laid his head back down on my shoulder, looking tired. We entered the sliding doors into my lab and I handed the tired 626 to the Earth female. 626 looked skittish when I did. \"It's ok little guy. He's not going anywhere\" she said. I turned away from them and set up the special scanning machine. \"Since 626 is closely resembling common Earth pet, will be comparing him to one. Any suggestions?\" I asked. \"Umm….\" she thought. \"Any dog should work\" she mumbled. \"Jumba is not having all day\" I said impatiently. \"Just do a Collie then\" she said at last. He looked nothing like the dog, but I didn't complain. I reprogrammed a few things in the setting and adjusted the tube size, before I walked back over to get 626. \"Alright, now we shall see what special abilities you are having\". I carried him over and set him into the small tube. He clawed at the glass, but he stopped at my word. I pressed a few buttons and the machine began scanning him with red, blue, and green rays. 626 did not like that. He growled, and thrashed at the lights violently. \"Calming down 626!\" I said. He just growled at me and kept at it. \"We don't have to drug him, do we?\" the Earth girl said uneasily. \"Am hoping not, Professor Pelekai, am hoping not\". He calmed down after a minute and yawned. Clearly being alive was taking up his energy. The machine beeped, signifying that the scan was over. The Earth girl took him out while me and Hamsterviel went to look at his abilities. \"Wow. He is very oh-so-powerful\" he said. My eyes were as wide as his when I read his talents. \"Sh..should I ask what he can do, or..\" The Plurganorian asked nervously. \"It's not bad, is it?\" the Earth female added in. \"If scanning is right, will be harder for us to control him\". \"Well (gulp) wh..what can he do, exactly?\" asked. \"He is being Fireproof, can be lifting objects up to 3,000 times his weight, can be seeing in dark, and can climb walls. His back spines are also proving to be poisonous and his antennae can sense radiation and heat. His senses are also being higher than average animals\". \"Wow. That is strong\" The Earth girl said. \"Yes, but it's not the scary part\" Hamsterviel said. \"I..it's not?\" the Plurganorian asked, scared. \"Nope. Scary part is when instincts start to be kicking in, will be wanting to destroy everything he can be touching\". The one eyed noodle gasped and the Earth female said \"That is bad\". She looked down at 626 in her arms who looked confused. He did that annoying, but adorable head turn telling us that he was confused. \"H..how l..long before h..his instincts k..kick in?\" the Pluginorian asked nervously. \"If lucky, not for a few days. If unlucky, will be in morning\" I said. I took a deep breath. \"Well, will need to put him in a Cell Room until we know he's ok to be letting out\" I said, looking back at the newest experiment of the Galaxy.

There are a lot of arguments like these will break friendships. This time, it almost did. Everyone knew Lilo Pelekai loved Elvis. Like, to the point that she knew more about Elvis than the King of Rock'n'Roll himself. She spread this 'pro-Elvis' attitude to the aliens she had living in her house. To the point that the family themselves loved Elvis too. Stitch, for example, became the second biggest fan of the King. So, obviously, this made picking out the music for drives in the car super easy. So easy in fact that they kept an CD of Elvis in the radio, not changing it ever. Yep. It was a good thing so many people in their Ohana loved Elvis... ...except, however, Hero. Otherwise known as Experiment 628 aka Leroy . He didn't like Elvis. This led to one of the biggest arguments the Ohana ever had. ==KVQ== They were driving into town for groceries when it happened. Pleakley was driving the car. Why the car instead of walking? Because they had two teenagers and a dozen experiments living in their house, a handful of groceries wouldn't cut it. They had a bigger car too, than in the movies. With some many people in the house, squeezing everyone in Nani's five-person was too much. The new car could fit eight. A much better fit for them. Plus the trunk- wow- it could fit a Thanksgiving feast inside it. Which is about how many groceries they bought a week. One of Lilo's favorite Elvis songs was coming over the radio. She turned it up louder, to the delight of Stitch and Pleakley. They began to sing it. Hero groaned, lowering his ears so they were flat on the side of his head. His human- Mahina Jookiba- reached her hand over to his head. She scratched the back, reassuringly. Hero accepted the kind gesture. Until Pleakley started to sing. Everyone in the car had to admit that Pleakley couldn't sing. It drove Hero over the edge. He screamed in annoyance. He jumped up, reaching for the radio and slamming his fist on the power button. Lilo and Stitch complained when the music stopped. \"Now, now, children. No need to fuss.\" Pleakley reached for the power button. Hero growled at him. Pleakley pulled his finger back, focusing on driving again. \"O-okay. No more music.\" \"That's not fair!\" Lilo complained. Typical of a teenager her age. Yeah she was a proper teenager now. Thirteen years old, the perfect age to gripe about music and life being unfair. \"Hero, turn the radio back on!\" Hero shook his head, angrily crossing his arms over his chest. \"Hero!\" Lilo growled. \"Lilo!\" Pleakley scolded. \"It's fine. We're almost at the market anyway!\" Lilo-ever mature-crosses her arms over her chest. All the whole, Mahina sat in the backseat of the car. The only sign she had been listening was that she lifted out her earbud to see what had happened. ==KVQ== Mahina had her own money- so she set about to buying her own food. She had stayed at Yamanouchi Ninja School for a year for world experience (and they offered her a scholarship for helping save the planet from Draken, which was like no big deal) and she picked up a taste for a lot of the food she had over there. For the most part, what the grocery store in Kauai had was ingredients for different types of ramen. Mahina didn't mind. She knew a lot of different recipes that were better than just the plain noodles. She was putting all her ingredients in a basket when Lilo came to her side. \"Can you believe Hero?\" Lilo scoffed. She crossed her arms over her chest angrily. \"I mean, he cut off the song right when it was getting to the fun part!\" Mahina said nothing. \"He's been doing that a lot lately.\" Lilo mused. She gasped. \"You don't think that means anything, do you?\" Mahina looked at a spice. She was trying to remember if this one tasted good when added to the ramen she was planning to cook that night. \"Yeah. It does.\" She dropped it in her basket. Lilo gasped again. \"Mahina you're right! Hero is up to something! Oh but what ?\" Mahina walked away. She moved to the next aisle. Lilo followed behind. Mahina suddenly wondered if she wanted that ramen recipe tonight, or if she should save it for another night. There was a new episode of CSI coming on later this week that she could make something special for. \"I'm thinking tonight.\" Mahina decided. \"Yeah, tonight.\" She'd make some popcorn for the show. Mahina tried to remember which aisle had the popcorn. This one just had bread and small cakes. \"What's tonight?\" Lilo asked. \"You know what he's planning?\" \"Oh yeah.\" Mahina walked to the next aisle. \"This is gonna be fun.\" \"Mahina! Will you answer-\" Lilo paused. She chased after her friend. She pushed back Mahina's black hair. \"You had your headphones on the whole time?!\" Yeah. Mahina tended to wear her hair down. The long black locks blocked away the sight of her headphones. Mahina saw her friend glaring angrily. She reached for her headphones, taking one off her ear. \"Oh. Hey Lilo. What's up?\" Lilo face palmed. \"Ugh. I was trying to talk to you about Hero!\" \"You were?\" Mahina hummed. She scrunched up her face in confusion. \"Why?\" \"Because he turned off the radio in the car!\" \"Oh. Right. When did he do that, again?\" \" In the car ! Ten minutes ago!\" Mahina understood. \"Oh. Gotcha. I'll talk to him about-\" \"How long have you been wearing those?\" Lilo asked, pointing to the headphones. \"...I plead the fifth.\" Mahina answered. She moved to put the headphone back on her ear. Lilo stopped her. \"Okay I've been wearing them since I got in the car!\" \"Why?\" Lilo asked, confused. \"Because I would've gone insane if I had to listen Elvis again.\" Mahina admitted. Lilo dropped her jaw in shock. Mahina sighed. She put her hands on her hips, shaking her head. \"Here we go. The questions. Don't even start with me, Pelekai. I'm not-\" \"What could you- what do you mean -\" Lilo felt like her world had turned on it's side. Mahina didn't want to listen to Elvis ? What kind of world did Lilo live in now? Where people didn't like Elvis? \"What are you listening to? What's so good you picked it over Elvis? \" Mahina held up her pink iPod for Lilo. On the screen was the logo for band called Queen . \"Who's Queen?\" Lilo asked. Now it was Mahina's turn to gawk. \"You don't know-?! Forget it.\" She turned away from Lilo. \"I can't have this conversation with you right now!\" Except she would. Lilo caught up with her, blocking her path. \"Who the heck is Queen and why are they better than Elvis?\" \"Umm, because Freddie Mercury is the best thing ever .\" Mahina stated, plainly and dumb-downed for Lilo. \"Because their songs are all different and not all of them are romance ones!\" \"Neither is Elvis'!\" Lilo defended. \"Well sorry, you only play the romance ones in the car!\" Mahina argued. \"So I'd much rather listen to ' I'd Like To Break Free' instead of ' Blue Moon' for the millionth time!\" An awful realization came to Lilo. \"You're the reason Hero turned off the radio! You told him about Queen!\" \"You're darn right I did!\" Mahina stated proudly. \"He was pulling out his fur when you and Stitch sang out your songs! I'm not gonna say sorry for liking another band! Especially one that's better than Elvis!\" \"You take that back!\" Thus began the most awful fight the Pelekai/Jookiba house ever withstood. ==KVQ== Once they made it back to the house, Hero and Mahina stormed off to their room. Lilo and Stitch went to theirs. Pleakley was left behind to unload groceries. Mahina slammed her door, enraged. Hero growled as he climbed up to his bed. \"Did you have to turn off the radio?\" Mahina huffed in a low voice. She picked up another iPod on the dresser, this one red. \"We got you an iPod for a reason.\" Hero snarled. Mahina gave him a flat look. Hero stopped snarling. Mahina continued to give him the flat stare. \" She just wouldn't shut up about Elvis!\" Hero complained in his alien language. Well, he called Elvis the ' dancing sparkly big hair man'. \"Yeah. That's why I got you the iPod, and built earpods you could use.\" Mahina explained. She pointed at said headphones. \"So when you got annoyed at music or us you could ignore us until whenever you wanted. Now we're in a battle of the bands with Lilo and Stitch.\" Hero scoffed. \" What is this 'we' thing?\" \"Well since you turned off the radio, and I insulted Elvis to Lilo's face, it's going to take literally another apocalypse before I can get her to like us again.\" Hero turned on his side. \" Why do we want them to like us again? They are annoying.\" \"We're going in our teenage angst phase. Everyone's annoying.\" Mahina supplied. She climbed into her bed, letting out a heavy sigh. \"We're so dead.\" \"Eh.\" ==KVQ== When Mahina came downstairs for dinner, she was met with stone cold silence. Which she was used to, really. She wore her headphones all the time, so the table being quiet wasn't anything different. Mahina was making herself some ramen. The one she had bought all the ingredients for at the store. She was super excited to try eat. Except...she couldn't find the stuff. Oh the noodles were there. That was the easy part. It was just all the other things she'd bought today were gone . She knew she hadn't taken them to her room. She knew she didn't feed it to any experiments. Which meant...the food had been stolen. Probably by a teenager, with black hair and brown eyes and a blue alien. Mahina sighed. She closed the drawer. \"Lilo. Give them back.\" Lilo, who was sitting at the table eating dinner, pretended not to hear. Mahina turned. Everyone else at the table watched the exchange silently. They had learned not to get involved when Mahina was annoyed. \"Lilo. Give me my food.\" More silence. \"Alright then.\" Mahina walked out of the kitchen without another word. Lilo's smug grin was dampened some by the lackluster reaction. She would have to up her game... \"What's going on?\" Nani asked Lilo in a stern voice. \"Nothing.\" Lilo lied. Nani gave her a flat stare. \"We're just fighting.\" \"About?\" When Lilo didn't answer, Nani turned to Pleakley. \"Well?\" \"They're arguing about music.\" Pleakley revealed, beaming wide. \"Oh it's so fascinating to watch! I've heard about teenage fights in my research, but I've never witnessed it in real life before!\" The alien squealed in delight. Nani let out a sigh. \"What's the stupid fight about now?\" \"It's not a stupid fight!\" Lilo snapped. \"Mahina said Elvis was a bad singer, so I'm getting even!\" \"By taking her food?\" Nani countered. \"Lilo! Give Mahina her food!\" Lilo groaned in annoyance. She turned to Jumba. \"Jumba, can't you stop her?\" Jumba held up his arms. \"No! I'm not getting in middle of Earth girl fight.\" He got up from his seat. \"But you will fix Mahina's dinner.\" ==KVQ== When Lilo got Mahina's food back to the kitchen, she found Mahina grinning smugly. Screw fighting. This meant war ! ==KVQ== The war lasted three months. It was awful. Some battles were fierce. With Lilo blasting Mahina with a ray blaster that left burns on her arm. Or Mahina trying to 'accidentally' set off the blasters on the ship. Or Lilo setting it up for the Yin/Yang experiments to follow Mahina around for a week, and blast her whenever they felt like it. Or Mahina asking Kixx to follow around Lilo, and push close every door Lilo was trying to use. Some were more annoying than fierce. Mahina asked Clip to give Lilo a bad haircut while she slept. Lilo told Kettle (an experiment that had a furnace as a stomach that Mahina decided would be great at making popcorn to replace the broken popper at the theatre) to make sure whatever popcorn Mahina got was burnt. It needed to be stopped. ==KQV== Mahina was sitting at the dinner table. Her eyes were darting around, looking for something that was off. Because that's just how life was now. Mahina was usually hyper aware of what happened around her- a side effect of training as a ninja. It had saved her from a dozen of Lilo's pranks. That's what she called them, pranks. 'Attacks' were too strong a word. She glanced at the toaster. She used it to cook toast, except now she wondered what Lilo had done to it. There were a lot of options . Sparky could've messed with it (except he'd been recruited for Mahina's team after an unfortunate incident with Babyfier). So...maybe it was safe. Mahina walked up to it. Slowly. The toast popped out. Mahina continued walking. Slower. Just when she was within reach, she heard someone coming around the corner. She grabbed the nearest object, throwing it in their direction. Jumba blocked the glass plate before it could hit his face. Unfortunately it fell to the floor, shattering. Mahina gasped. \"Oh my- Pops I'm sorry!\" She rushed to grab the broom and dustpan. She swept up the broken glass littered on the floor. \"I thought you were-\" \"Little Girl?\" Jumba guesser, giving Mahina the look of parental disappointment. \"Or 626?\" Mahina awkwardly stared down at the broken glass. \"Mahina, this fighting has to end! Just apologize to Little Girl about saying Elvis bad singer-\" \"I did not say that about Elvis!\" Mahina complained. She had finished sweeping up the glass. She stormed over to the trash can, dumping it. \"All I said was that I liked Queen better!\" \"That. Apologize for that .\" Jumba corrected himself. Then he puffed up his chest, feeling like a proud Earth father. \"Ugh. Do I have to?\" Mahina whined. Jumba gave her a glare. \"Mahina...\" \" Fine.\" ==KVQ== Later that afternoon, Mahina and Lilo Met in the living room for a peace talk. Lilo was sitting on the couch, arms crossed over her chest. Stitch, beside her, was doing the same. Mahina was standing beside the window. Hero was on the wall behind her (despite the 'no climbing on the walls' rule Nani made after replacing the wallpaper for the tenth time), fading at the couch as if he had laser eyes that would set it on fire. \"Lilo. Stitch.\" Mahina began, taking a deep breath. \"We've been fighting for...too long.\" She paused to make sure she had her wording exactly right. \"So I asked you to come here, so that I can say...I'm sorry.\" Lilo huffed, turning her head away. Mahina grit her teeth. \"I'm... sorry ...that I...called Elvis a 'bad singer'. He's not.\" She said, even though she didn't actually say that. Sometimes you have to apologize for things you didn't do just so the fighting would stop. \"... and ?\" Lilo prompted. Mahina stayed strong. \"And that I used Dorkifier to embarrass you in front of that cute boy you liked.\" \"And?\" \"Made Phantasmo follow you around and scare you.\" \"And?\" \"...and that one time I took all your left shoes.\" Lilo accepted the apology. \"Hero?\" Lilo prompted. The Red experiment snorted. \" What?\" \"You did stuff too!\" \"Eh.\" Stitch nodded his head. Mahina winced. \"Like when you tore apart my history book!\" Lilo ranted. \"Or got spit all over my new clothes!\" \"You did it to me too...\" Mahina murmured. She slid her hands in her pockets. \"And make Stitch smelly!\" Stitch yelled. \" You turned me pink for a week!\" Hero argued. \"Alright. Alright!\" Mahina cut him off. \"Hero, just please say it?\" Hero gawked. \"No!\" \"Hero-\" \"No! I won't do it.\" Hero jumped off the wall, running to their room. Mahina sighed. \"I'll...talk to him. We good?\" Lilo and Stitch exchanged a look. They began whispering to each other. Mahina stood impatiently waiting. She'd rather not leave Hero alone too long. He got...weird. After a minute, Stitch stood off the couch. He walked up to Mahina. She knelt down, expression open. Stitch beamed. He hugged Mahina, who returned it happily. She let out a sigh in relief. \" Mahalo .\" Mahina sighed into Stitch's fur. She looked up at Lilo. \" Mahalo plenti.\" She pulled away from the hug. \"Now I'm going to go keep Hero from destroying our room.\" She ran off to the room. When she opened the door, it was to a flurry of feathers. Hero had ripped apart another pillow again. She wasn't surprised. Hero had it in his teeth, shaking it around. \"You know I hate feathers in my stuff.\" Mahina remarked dryly. She grabbed all the feathers she could, throwing them out. Hero spat out the pillow. \" You know I hate Elvis !\" \"Yeah, I do.\" Mahina stated. \"We still had to apologize.\" \" Why?\" \"Because that's what ohana does. Apologize to each other. If we had both apologized, they would've said sorry too!\" Mahina pointed out. She walked up to Hero. \"I know it's a weird human custom.\" \" It's also a weird custom that when someone doesn't like your music, you say sorry and stop playing it in front of them!\" \"Hero would you please -\" \" It killed them!\" Hero raged. Mahina stopped. Her face fell, as she'd heard this a hundred times and each time hurt like the last. \" A-all of them! Every Leroy like me died because of Elvis! And they were singing it with so much happiness that I couldn't take it anymore!\" ' Which is why I convinced them to get you the iPod.' Mahina thought to herself. Instead of saying this, she pulled Hero into her lap. \" They didn't need to die.\" Hero continued to rant, as Mahina brushed her hand through his head fur. \" They were just lost.\" \"I know.\" Mahina agreed, feeling a haunting ache in her chest. Hero turned into Mahina's hug. He buried his face in her shirt. \" We could have made them better . Like you made me better.\" Mahina never knew what to say when he said that. ' Maybe we could have...' , ' Maybe they were too far gone...', 'no way we could keep them from Elvis for long', 'I bet some of them were kind.' \"Okay.\" She found herself sniffling. They say like that a long time. Neither crying, neither making any real noise of any kind. The room was full of the sounds of their shaking breaths. Mahina rocked Hero in her arms, relief that he was there and alive because remembering that festival was intense. \" Who wants to live forever.\" Mahina sang under her breath some twenty minutes later. \" Who wants to live forever. Forever is our today...\" \"Who waits to live forever, anyway?\" She and Hero sang. ==KVQ== AN: Yeah none of you were ready for this were huh?!

He knew he would have to talk to Lilo and Stitch first about it because this thing concerns with them. He knows that Pleakley and Jumba would be happy for them but doesn't know about Lilo as she doesn't deal with huge change well. He would move in with them to make life easier but they would be husband and wife which is new thing for everyone. He goes over to the house and knocks on the door. Nani opens the door surprised to see him. \"David? Wasn't I going to meet you at the restaurant after work?\" asks Nani \"We are I actually came to see Lilo and Stitch.\" says David \"Uh. Okay.

How about we go down to the beach and build some sandcastles? You can bring your camera.\" says David The two look at each other and head out the door heading for the beach. When they get there the three start building sandcastles. \"I wanted to talk to you two about something.\" says David, he rubs his neck like he does when he's nervous \"What's wrong?\" asks Lilo \"Well I wanted to know how would you guys feel if I married your sister.\" says David The two gasp all happy and look at David. \"Yeah! Finally!\" says Lilo and Stitch They hug him happily. \"When are you asking her?\" asks Lilo \"Tonight actually during dinner. I don't know if she will say yes. She might be worried about you and Stitch.\" says David \"Then tell her that we will be happy for you too.\" says Lilo \"Yeah!

Do me a favor and turn it over and carry it over for me over there to be waxed.\" says David \"Sure.\" says Nani David leaves quickly, Nani looks on the board and looks confused as she sees the question that says \"Will you marry me?\" \"Oi David what is this about?\" asks Nani She heads over and drops the board gasping seeing David on one knee holding a ring. \"That question is asking you to marry me. Nani, we have been going out for a long time, and I love you just as you love me. I love Lilo and Stitch too, absolutely adore those two. I asked them this morning if they would be okay if I asked you for your hand today, as their opinion is just important to me as it is to you. I would love to take your hand and walk down the aisle, err I mean uh..\" says David Nani smiles and kisses his cheek and takes the ring. \"I would love to David. Yes, I will marry you.\" says Nani He smiles and scoops her up in his arms happily, they kiss. They go home and find that Lilo, Stitch, Pleakley, and Jumba are waiting for the two. They smile and walk in the door, they see the four waiting. \"Well?\" asks Pleakley \"She said yes!\" says David There is cheering then a big celebration with one of Stitch's huge birthday cakes. The next few months is getting ready for the wedding, Lilo is the flower girl, Stitch is the ring bearer and best man, David's dad is a best man, Pleakley is maid of honor. That leaves father of the bride, which Nani is pretty sad about since her father can't walk her down the aisle. Days before the wedding, Lilo hears Nani crying she goes into her room slowly and finds her sitting with the last of the photos of their parents. \"Nani?\" says Lilo Nani quickly whips her tears. \"Are you hungry baby? I will make you and everyone food for breakfast. Okay? Wait in the kitchen.\" says Nani She doesn't instead she climbs up next to her older sister and sees the photo she's holding. \"Mom would be proud of you and I'm sure Dad would love to walk you down the aisle. You are missing them huh.\" says Lilo \"Yeah I am. It's hard to think of this. I mean we got it all set up for him to live with us, but we didn't think about the wedding part, the father walking the daughter down the aisle and the father daughter dance.\" says Nani Both girls look at the picture for a little bit. \"Hey! I think I have an idea.\" says Lilo \"Oh?\" says Nani \"What about Jumba!\" says Lilo \"Jumba?\" asks Nani \"Yeah I mean he is our uncle, I'm sure Dad will understand if Uncle Jumba takes his place. Plus what do you always say about Mom and Dad?\" asks Lilo \"That they are always with us.\" says Nani \"Even if we don't see them. They are stars in the sky. The wedding is at night time right? So Mom and Dad are already there in spirit so why can't Jumba be Dad so Dad won't worry about you walking down alone and he can shine brighter?\" says Lilo Nani smiles at her little sisters analogy. \"You know that is not a bad idea, thanks Lilo.\" says Nani They hug and they find Jumba thinking of his newest invention in his ship. \"Jumba! Nani needs to talk to you.\" says Lilo She turns to her sister. \"You can do it. He might be big but he has the biggest alien heart I have ever seen.\" says Lilo She leaves quickly, Jumba turns toward Nani. \"Nani?

Here it would come … oblivion. At least now Lilo wouldn't be hurt anymore. He wouldn't be there to make any mistakes, to break her life with his inescapable bad . He'd just … fade away … So … why wasn't he fading away? Stitch's eyes fluttered open as coolness fluttered over his being. His weakness was gone, replaced by … stillness. He wasn't hyper, he wasn't tired. He just … was. With no discomfort or difficulty, he sat up and looked around. He was surrounded by … clouds? A quick look down showed what looked like simple brown stone, all surrounded by softly-glowing white clouds. Was he on a mountain? Stitch stood up, not shaky and not quick. Just … stood up. What was happening here? Stitch had heard of the Earth belief in a place that came after death. They called it \"heaven.\" Jumba had always laughed it off as unprovable, and thus not worth his time. Pleakley had loved the idea in an afterlife, even if he doubted it was all clouds and rainbows. Lilo believed in it … and Stitch had never really thought about it beyond that. Was he in heaven? No, that didn't make sense! He was bad, he'd broken things and ruined family night and scratched Lilo . But … the clouds made it look an awful lot like heaven. \"He-hello?\" Sitch asked. No answer. Stitch swallowed thickly, lacing his fingers as he usually did when upset. He wasn't angry — some part of him doubted it was possible to be angry here. He just … was. Was this a punishment for his badness. To spend eternity here alone? Before Stitch could dwell on that possibility, the sound of falling gravel caught his ears. \"Hello?\" Stitch asked. There was no more noise, but two shadows appeared in the mist, slowly drawing closer. Stitch took a step back, suddenly uneasy. The shadows drew silently closer, gaining more and more definition. Finally, two figures emerged … and Stitch gasped. The figures were a man and a woman. And though he had never met them, Stitch knew who they were. The man had a close-cropped hair and an easy-going grin, while the woman's hair fell in soft waves that framed a soft, motherly smile. They were dressed in white, a button up and pants for the man and a sundress for the woman. The man favored Lilo, while the woman was all but identical to Nani. These were … Lilo and Nani's parents. \"Hello, Stitch,\" Mrs. Pelekai said, kneeling down to his level. \"It's good to finally meet you, little guy,\" Mr. Pelekai greeted, lowering himself to one knee. Stitch clasped his hands tighter and took another step back, head bowed in shame. \"Stitch sorry,\" he whispered. \"Stitch … bad.\" Stitch started at the feeling of faint pressure under his chin, guiding his gaze back up to the Pelekais. \"It wasn't your fault, Stitch,\" Mrs. Pelekai said softly. And somehow, he knew without a doubt that she was right. \"You were only sick. But that sickness has passed. You'll be alright.\" \"Alright?\" Stitch asked. But … he was dead, right? \"Nah, this isn't the end, Bud,\" Mr. Pelekai chuckled. \"Just a little taste of the afterlife. You'll be going back soon enough.\" Stitch thought it over for a moment, and decided he was happy. If he wasn't bad, like the Pelekais said, then he was happy to return home to Lilo and the rest. They were his ohana. \"Ohana means family,\" Stitch said slowly, just as he had to Nani after Lilo had been taken, before they had gotten her back. \"Family means …\" \"No one gets left behind …\" Mr. Pelekai finished proudly, \"... or forgotten.\" He chuckled and tousled Stitch's head. \"Glad to see I did something right with the girls.\" Mrs. Pelekai snorted at her husband's antics and looked Stitch in the eyes. \"You'll be going back to them soon, Stitch. Thank you.\" Stitch titled his head in confusion. \"For what?\" \"For looking out for our girls,\" she answered. Mrs. Pelekai stood and scooped Stitch up in her arms, Mr. Pelekai crowding in to complete a group hug. \"No matter what happens, you are ohana to us as well.\" A tear traced down her cheek. \"You're our son.\" Stitch felt his eyes water as he held tight to both of them. \"And tell the girls,\" Mr. Pelekai said, \"we're so proud of them, too.\" Stitch watched as the two slowly faded into the clouds. The surroundings drew closer, inexorably but not threateningly. Stitch felt his eyes droop, like he was sleepy. He slowly descended back into nothingness … Stitch's awareness slowly crawled back. The first thing he heard was … crying. Familiar crying — Lilo crying. He felt her arms around him, the cold point of her tear on his chest. With his little strength , he moved his hand over hers. Her crying stopped. \"Stitch, not bad,\" Stitch said, eyes fluttering open. \"Stitch … fluffy!\" \"Stitch!\" Lilo cried, joy in her voice. Before he knew it, Stitch was wrapped up in a hug by his ohana. And some part of him, a part that remembered his little \"trip\" felt two extra pairs of arms around him. \" Thank you … son.\" A single tear fell from Stitch's eye as his heart felt warmer than ever before. Because in that moment, he knew Lilo had been right. Love was more powerful than death. And not just his own ... After watching \"Stitch Has A Glitch\", I wondered what would have happened if Stitch had had a near-death experience. This is the result of that line of thought. Leave a review if you like it!

The sun was shining, there was a slight tropical breeze from the ocean, and Yuna was in a rush to get to school on time. She and Stitch had slept in. Again. \"Come on Stitch!\" she shouted, strapping on her helmet and waiting for her blue friend to start pedaling her ride. \"Never fear, the master of cycling is here!\" he replied, hopping on the tricycle and zooming off, causing a yelp from Yuna. \"Come on Stitch! We need to be there soon!\" Yuna pressured. Stitch narrowed his eyes in motivation and went faster. Meanwhile at the school, Jessica, Toriko, and Makiko were conversing, slowly heading up to the school. \"Well I don't know about you guys, but this hair band looks great with my outfit. I guess you could say it 'ties' everything together\" Jessica said. It was silent for a moment, a soft breeze passing by the three. Toriko and Makiko were making sour faces when Jessica cleared her throat. Then they burst out into fake laughter. \"That was a good one!\" Toriko said first. \"I think I'm going to pee my pants, that was so funny!\" Makiko said after. Just then, a shout rained out from Hiroman. \"Look out!\" He yelled as a soccer ball went flying towards the three girls. They screamed and ducked, and the ball flew right over their heads. But at the same moment, Stitch and Yuna arrived, coming to an abrupt halt. Stitch saw the soccer ball heading for Yuna and jumped to push her out of the way. \"Yuna!\" he cried. She looked in time to see the ball and braced herself for impact. Stitch was quicker, however, and took the hit in the face, headbutting the ball back to the field. Stitch on the other hand, was knocked back from the force into a nearby pile of mud. \"Stitch!\" Yuna said, running over to see if her friend was hurt. She grabbed his shoulders and lifted him up. \"Hey, are you ok?\" she asked with a worried tone. The front half of his body was covered in mud, including his face. He blinked and shook his body, sending some mud everywhere. Yuna blocked the spray with her hands. \"Yeah I'm ok. I'm fluffy!\" Stitch replied with a smile, arms out trying to show off his blue, and unharmed body. Yuna laughed. \"I don't know about that anymore Stitch. You're covered in mud!\" she said between laughs. Stitch looked down to see that he was in fact caked in mud. \"Details\" he replied. Hiroman then ran over to the two of them. \"Sorry Stitch, one of the guys went for the goal and I tried to block it\". \"It's ok\" Stitch said with a smile. First bell went off. \"Oh! I got to get to class Stitch. I'll see you after school\" Yuna said. She took off her helmet and set it on the tricycle before running off. She paused and turned back towards her dirty best friend. \"Oh, and go take a bath!\" she called out. Stitch's ears fell, and his face went unamused. He stuck his tongue out at her. She returned the favor before second bell went off. Then she went back to running. Stitch remained holding a pouty face before getting back on the tricycle and riding off. It had been a few months since the Dark End incident, and all was quiet. Hamsterviel and Delia were imprisoned, and no other threat loomed around the corner. At the capture of Hamsterviel, all of Jumba's experiments were returned to him, courtesy of the Grand Councilwoman. Her only condition was that they were not to be used for anything bad. Stitch, although pouty, was content with his life. He had thought his life was meaningless when Lilo had left him, and everyone else had found their calling, but when he met Yuna, she brought him back. It made him wonder if there were more out there like his two best friends. More lonely people looking for a 626 of their own. Stitch wondered, but wasn't going to leave his immediate family to find out. All was peaceful in life. Little to everyone's knowledge, that was soon to change. On his ride back home, Stitch spotted something twinkling in the sunlight on the cliffs. He pulled the tricycle to a stop to look at it. It was a silver necklace with a pink-jeweled cursive Y on it. He picked it up and looked around for someone who could have lost it. He got up to retrieve the small necklace. \"Well, no use in letting it go to waste\" he mumbled to himself. A habit he picked up from his creator. He walked over to the edge and picked up the sparkly thing. Stitch smiled, knowing that his best friend would love it. But as he was admiring the bejeweled piece of jewelry, the ground below him began to crack and shift. The small movements caused the blue alien to freeze, his back hairs standing on edge. He looked behind him to see the small ledge he was on about to fall. \"Smitik\" he said as the ledge gave out and he fell. He smacked into the water and instantly began to sink. He thrashed until he got to the bottom, where he began to hop over to the cliff side, climbing back up. He gasped in a breath of air when he breached the surface, and moved to climb back up. The only problem was when he got past the rocky area, there was only dirt. And he was soaking wet, which turned the dirt into mud. He slipped and fell back into the water, having to repeat the process over and over again. At one point, he accidentally breathed in salt water, causing him to choke for a minute before coughing it back out. But never once did he let go of his new gift for his best friend. It took most of the day, but he finally made it back to the top where he jumped back from the edge of the cliffs and collapsed to the ground, exhausted. He coughed out any remaining seawater, his lungs aching strangely, but passed it off as normal. He laid there, with only one thought in mind. One he voiced quietly. \"Dunga haga bla bla\". Once he was rested enough, he sat back up and looked at his prize once more. Which reminded him: \"Chuuta! Time to pick up Yuna!\" he shouted, jumping up and zooming off, still soaking in water. Back at school, Yuna was starting to worry. \"Stitch is never this late. Where could he be?\" she asked, waiting outside the school. Her worries were soothed however, when a few minutes later, Stitch zoomed in on the tricycle. Yuna thought he would crash into her, so she prepared for impact, but was only met with a face full of dirt. Stitch screeched to a halt, once again gasping for breath. He leaned forward on the bike, panting. \"Nailed it!\" he said between breaths. \"Stitch..\" Yuna began to scold, coughing a few times. She was going to continue, but she could see how tired he looked. \"We'll talk about this later, why don't we go home for now\". \"Ih\" he agreed tiredly. She put on her helmet and got on. Stitch then began pedaling the two home. It was quiet, but Yuna was looking at her best friend with more worry. She noticed how tired he was and the fact that his fur was soaking in some areas. She decided to wait until they got home. And when they did, Stitch fell to the ground with a dramatic sigh. Yuna knelt down in front of him. \"You ok Stitch?\" she asked, watching him take deep breaths. He gave a thumbs up. \"Never better\". Yuna moved to lean on her side. \"You could've fooled me\" she replied. \"What happened?\" she continued. Stitch wanted to save the surprise for later, but knew Yuna could tell when he was lying or hiding something. So he held up the still sparkling necklace, sitting up. \"Found this by the cliffs and went to get it for you, but fell off. Spent all day trying to get back up\" Stitch said, exhaustion clear in his voice. Yuna gasped at the gift, taking it in her hands. \"Wow\" she breathed. \"It's beautiful\" she commented, playing around with the sparkling Y. She smiled and looked to her wiped, but grinning best friend. Although still wet, she picked him up and gave him a hug. \"I love it Stitch, I really do, but this looks expensive. I'm sure whoever lost it really wants it back\". Stitch's ears fell, but he still smiled. His best friends was right, as usual. \"But, until we find who lost it, how about we hang onto it?\". He gave a large nod with an \"Ih\" to that as a reply. Yuna put on the necklace and stood to go inside. She had some homework to get done. Stitch followed her with the hopes of drying off and a nice, long nap. He was truly wiped. \"How about I make you some food. You look like you could use the energy\" Yuna asked. She expected Stitch to perk up with excitement, or do a backflip, or something normal when food was mentioned. But to her utter surprise, none of that came. In truth, Stitch swallowed too much salt water and wasn't feeling all that good. All the exercise didn't help him at all. He yawned in reply and just plopped on the couch, out in seconds. She sat down next to him, rubbing the fur on his back. \"I suppose 8 hours of trying to swim and climb would do that to anyone\" Yuna spoke. She pulled back her hand, now drenched in water and decided he needed to be dried off before anything. So without any hesitation, she stood and grabbed his shower towel. She ran back over and gently began to dry him off. He subconsciously began to purr and cuddle into her. To him, she felt really warm. Yuna did her best not to giggle. To her, Stitch was really adorable in moments like these. When he was no longer soaking, she set him on a pillow and went to start her homework. Something that made her bored really quickly. She noticed how quiet it was when Stitch was sleeping and decided to take her homework somewhere else. Or to a certain evil genius who could offer help. She would enjoy a ride there, but Stitch was so worn out. She could live without a ride. She packed her things and took one last look at her best friend. He was curled in a small ball, much like a cat or dog would be. She smiled at the image and took out a camera to capture the image. Then she left quietly to Jumba and Pleakley's house. At the mention, Pleakley was cleaning around the house, as usual. \"Hmm, such a lovely day for cleaning\" Pleakley spoke with a duster in hand. \"Clean a little here, clean a little there, oh! I see you there hiding from me!\" he went on in a sing song voice. Yuna walked in at that very moment. \"Hey Pleakley\" she called. \"Oh, hello there Yuna\" he replied. He looked to see if Stitch was around, but no sign of him. He thought that was strange. \"Where's the Little Monster at?\" he asked, walking up to her. \"Oh, he had a long day of climbing up a cliff and falling back into water, so he's asleep right now\". She said. \"Aww\" Pleakley replied. \"But check out what he found!\" Yuna piped up, excited. She picked up the charm on her necklace and showed it to Pleakley. \"Oh wow, it's so shiny and pretty!\" he replied, just as excited. \"I know. I plan to give it back to whoever lost it, but I'm hanging on to it until we find them. Isn't it neat?\" she asked. \"I would say so. Shame, if it was me who found it, I would keep it to myself!\" Pleakley exclaimed. Yuna laughed. \"Yeah, it is pretty, but I figured whoever lost it might be missing it\". Pleakley patted her shoulder and went back to cleaning. \"Say, where's Jumba? I wanted to see if he could help me with my homework\" Yuna asked. \"Oh Jumba? He went to visit an old friend of his. Said something about needing some evil genius company instead of me. His loss I say!\" Pleakley replied. Yuna's face fell. \"Aww, that sucks. I was really hoping he'd be here to help me with my fractions\" she said. \"Hmm, well I'm no evil genius, but maybe I can help some\" Pleakley offered. Yuna looked unsure, but sat down countless. Some help was better than no help, right? It was rocky, but Pleakley actually did help her. Maybe not the way she was hoping for, but it got her homework done so she couldn't complain. It was sunset by the time she got home, and Tigerlily was on the couch watching some drama. Stitch hadn't moved since she had left. \"Hey Tigerlily\" Yuna greeted, setting her backpack on a chair. \"Where have you been?\" Tigerlily asked, a hit of impatience in her voice. \"Oh, at Jumba's and Pleakley's. I needed some help with my math\" she answered, sitting down next to a sleeping Stitch. She began to stroke his back as he slept, causing him to curl more into himself and purr. Both Tigerlily and Yuna gave amused smiles. Yuna looked at the TV and faked gagged. A girl and a boy were gushing out each other's love for the other. It was too mushy for her taste. Yuna decided cooking was better than watching a couple make out, so she got up and began to make dinner. \"Was there anything you wanted for dinner?\" Yuna asked her cousin. She just shrugged. Yuna decided to make sushi. Again. It was one of the few things she was good at making. Especially because there was never any leftovers to go bad in the fridge. Anything she and Tigerlily didn't finish, Stitch normally would. It took a half an hour to make enough of each different roll, but when it was done, she was very hungry. \"Ok, dinner's ready\" she said. Tigerlily got up to see what was made and smiled evilly to see her favorite kind of sushi in the mix. \"Stitch!\" Yuna called. While Tigerlily didn't wait for anyone, Yuna walked over to the couch where Stitch was resting. She shook him a little. \"Stitch, come on dinner's ready\" she said softly. He just groaned and turned the other way. \"..naga hungry\" he said softly. That set off a few warning bells in Yuna's mind. Stitch was always hungry. And she meant, always . \"You're not hungry? Are you feeling ok Stitch?\" she asked. She checked his temperature, but he didn't feel feverish. He nodded. \"..m'okay\" he mumbled. Yuna didn't believe him, but knew he'd eat when he woke up. \"Ok, but food will be in the fridge when you change your mind\" she said, standing up. The two ate their fill, and Yuna cleaned up afterwards, putting away whatever was left. \"I don't believe it\" Tigerlily spoke. \"What?\" \"Stitch actually chose not to eat. I never thought I'd live to see the day\" she commented. In Yuna's mind, her cousin made a valid point. Even when he was tired, Stitch would never pass up a chance for food. It worried her greatly. \"He's just really tired. He said he spent all day climbing, and falling into water. I think that would make anyone wiped\" she said, hiding her concern. Tigerlily just shrugged. \"Whatever you say\". It wasn't long after that that they both cousins retired to sleep. Yuna put on her PJs and took down her hair. She took the job of carrying Stitch up to his bed. She had never seen him so tired. 'Stop worrying Yuna. He'll be back to his old self by morning. He always is' she thought. She still rubbed her face into his soft fur, enjoying the comfort he always brought her. She set him down on his couch, and went to her bed. Yawning, she turned off the light and went to sleep. Her worries still remained heavy in her mind, though. Morning came quickly, and like normal, Yuna slept in. Her worries of her friend were forgotten as she needed to be up and at school soon. She was too caught up in her panic that she didn't realize how Stitch had a slight cough. \"Stitch wake up! We're going to be late!\" She shouted. He coughed and rubbed his head, sliding off the couch. \"Come on Stitch, we have to go!\" She yelled yanking his arm. Stitch yelped. \"Ok! Ok! I'm coming\" he said. He took slow hops to the tricycle, trying to ignore the small headache he had. He didn't even put on his helmet. Yuna threw hers on and hopped on the tricycle. It was a slow start, but with some pushing on Yuna's end, they made it to school by second bell. \"Thanks Stitch, I'll see you after school!\" Yuna shouted, running off. Stitch gave her a small glare before going to see Jumba and Pleakley. He was a little moody because he wasn't feeling well. When he arrived there, Jumba was still gone. \"Yeah, he said he'd be back in a few days, why?\" Pleakley asked. Stitch coughed. It was a little hoarse. Pleakley looked a little worried, walking over to feel his forehead. \"Well, you don't have a fever which is good. You probably caught a cold or something\" Stitch nodded. He'd never gotten sick before, so he didn't really know what to do. That's why he went to see Jumba, but since he wasn't here, Stitch just hopped on the couch and laid down. \"Pleakley?\" Stitch asked. \"Yeeese?\" \"Can you pick up Yuna today? Naga want to move a lot\". Pleakley put a finger to his chin. \"Well, I don't have anything else to do today. Sure, why not\". Stitch smiled. \"Taka\". Stitch closed his eyes and went back to sleep. Another day of school passed for Yuna, and she had to ask herself once again why she bothered rushing in the mornings. She was talking to Dolores when Pleakley walked up to them. \"Oh, Hey Pleakley. What are you doing here?\". \"Oh, the Little Monster wasn't feeling well, so I came to get you\". Yuna's eyes widened. \"He's not feeling well?\" She shared a glance with Dolores who just shrugged and walked off. \"Yeah, I think he caught a cold\". Yuna looked down feeling a little guilty. Looking back, she recalled how Stitch was coughing when he woke up, and how they made it to school a little later than they normally would've. Heck, he didn't even grab something to eat before they left, edible or not. Pleakley talked to her the whole way back, but she was too worried to say anything. When they got to the house, she ran inside and saw Stitch on the couch. He was asleep, much like yesterday. This time however, he would cough every so often. She rubbed his back. \"Gee, I hope he's not coming down with something serious\" she voiced. Pleakley just gave Stitch a pat on the head. \"Relax, the Little Monster has never gotten sick before. Jumba made it so that if he were to ever get sick, it would be with something common like a cold. No need to worry, he'll be back to causing trouble in no time\" He said. That didn't make Yuna feel any better. \"Oh, alright. But can we let Jumba know? Just incase?\" she asked. \"Alright, but don't be disappointed when he says the same thing\" Pleakley said. He went upstairs, and after a small, internal debate, Yuna picked up Stitch and followed. Pleakley was looking at Jumba's computer, pressing a few buttons every now and then. Stitch shifted in Yuna's hold, but stayed asleep. He coughed. Eventually Pleakley got the computer working and sent a call to Jumba's ship. After the fourth call, he finally picked up. \"Unless is emergency, please to stop calling Jumba\" he spoke. It looked like he just got up. Pleakley huffed. \"Well, I told Yuna it wasn't an emergency, but she wanted me to call you\" \"And what is being so important that Jumba is needed?\" \"That the Little Monster caught a cold\". \"626 has caught cold?\" Jumba asked. He was a little surprised, but not worried. \"Yeah, it started yesterday. He fell off a cliff into water and spent basically all day trying to climb back up. He was pretty exhausted when he came and got me, and when we got home he just slept. He didn't even want to wake up for food!\" Yuna piped up. Jumba rubbed his chin in thought. \"Yeah. So far the Little Monster only has a cough, but Yuna thinks he's coming down with something bad\" Pleakley spoke. \"Wake him up. Jumba wants to be seeing how he feels\". Yuna nodded and began shaking him. \"Stitch? Stitch wake up\" she said softly. He groaned and swatted her arm away lightly. \"Leave me alone\" he said, coughing right after. Yuna shook him a little more this time. \"Jumba wants to talk to you\". He groaned again, but opened his eyes. He blinked and held his head. He looked around the room before looking up at the screen. \"Gaba?\" he spoke with a hoarse voice. \"626 is not feeling well, yes?\" Stitch rubbed his eyes and yawned, nodding. \"What is not feeling well\". \"Meega head hurt, and throat scratchy\" he replied, coughing right after. \"Is stomach bothering 626 at all?\" Jumba asked again. \"Little bit\" he mumbled in reply. \"Bah, is just being cold. No need to be worrying. All 626 needs is rest and maybe some soup\" Jumba said. Hearing it from Jumba eased Yuna's mind very much. \"Alright, thanks Jumba. When do you think you'll be getting home?\". \"Will be staying for a few more days\". \"Alright, thanks Jumba\". He smiled in return. \"Get some rest 626\". Stitch, however was fast asleep. Jumba pressed a button and the screen went blank. \"See, what did I tell you? It's just a cold\" Pleakley said. Yuna just shrugged, running her hands through the fur on his chest. \"Well then, let's get you home and get some soup. Tomorrow's Saturday so we don't need to be up early\" Yuna spoke to Stitch, even though he couldn't hear her. \"Well, thanks for the help Pleakley\". Pleakley smiled. \"Sure, anytime. Let me know how he is tomorrow\". Yuna grabbed her bag off the couch with a grateful nod, and made her way back home with Stitch in her arms. When they got home, she set him on the couch, on the exact same pillow as yesterday, and went to make him a chicken noodle soup. She snacked on leftover sushi from the night before as she did. Since she was home before Tigerlily, she put on her favorite show: New Town Wide. She and Stitch loved all of the food related shows. It didn't take long to make chicken noodle soup, so it was no surprise that she was done within a half an hour. \"Alright Stitch, I made you some soup\" she said as she walked into the living room with a decent sized bowl. She set it down on the coffee table in front of her when Stitch remained asleep. Sitting down next to him, she brought him into her lap and began to shake him awake again. \"Stitch, come on you need to eat something \" she pressed. He peeked a drowsy eye open at her. She looked worried. He sighed and sat up slowly, head pounding. He held it softly as she reached forward for the soup. She supported it as he began to eat it slowly. Human pace, actually. She rubbed his back as he ate. 'Poor Stitch. He looks really miserable' Yuna thought. He ate about half of the soup before leaning back on his best friend. Yuna set the bowl back on the table in front of them, leaning back with Stitch in her lap. He nestled into her stomach, getting comfortable. Yuna just stroked his back as she watched her show. Homework can wait until later, right now her family needed her. The rest of the evening was uneventful. Tigerlily came home around 7, rolling her eyes at Stitch's predicament. She thought he was faking it for attention, as he had no fever. Yuna was mad at her for thinking such a thing, but held her tongue, as Tigerlily could shut her down real quick. Afternoon came and went, and soon it was time for bed. Yuna, however, didn't fall asleep so soon. Her mind was full of unspoken arguments and doubt. 'What if he is faking it?' she thought. 'I mean, it is a way to get people to do what you want for them'. Yuna sighed and rolled on her back, looking over at Stitch. He was curled back into a cat position, sound asleep. She could see each individual breath, hearing a cough or two every so often. He couldn't fake a cough like that, so she went to bed with her mind at ease. But uneasy still, as she had a bad feeling. Hours pass, and Stitch wakes up to an ache in his stomach. One that's traveled up his throat. He struggled to get up because every movement caused his stomach and his chest more distress. He got off his couch, holding his mouth with both paws as he ran to the bathroom to throw up. He lost track of time, but his nausea wouldn't go away. He threw up until only bile came out and up until he was dry heaving. He lightly pounded the toilet seat, not even making a dent. Flushing it, Stitch let himself collapse to the floor, shivering. 'When did it get so cold?' he thought. He wrapped an arm around his stomach and curled into himself. He coughed, a cough that sent spikes through his chest, trying to sleep, but the floor was far too cold. Willing himself up, he grabbed onto a cabinet and stumbled up, almost falling over again. His head pounded and he whined, crawling back on all fours to his and Yuna's shared room. He wobbled and swayed the whole way back. He got over to Yuna's closet, barely holding himself up. He put on his old, blue onesie from when he lived in Hawaii and also grabbed his old plush turtle. This time when he fell, he laid there for a few seconds to let his stomach stop turning. No matter what he did, his head seemed to pound though. He dragged himself up to Yuna's bed and crawled under the covers with her. He was shivering uncontrollably, so everything around him was freezing. He cuddled up to Yuna and let himself fall back into a restless sleep. Jumba said it was just a cold, but Stitch was beginning to believe otherwise. Morning came slowly, and by habit, Yuna got up fairly early. What she didn't expect was for Stitch to be in bed with her. \"Ahh!\" She screamed, falling out of bed. \"Ouch!\" she said, rubbing her bottom. Standing back up she was about to yell at Stitch, but looking at him, she couldn't bring herself to. His fur was at least two shades lighter, and even in his onesie, he was shivering like mad. She had rarely seen him in his onesie, let alone holding his small, stuffed turtle. She gasped softly. \"Oh Stitch…\" she said softly. Colds could give small fevers, but one look at her friend and she knew this wasn't a cold. She could just tell. Climbing back into bed, she shook him awake. \"Stitch? Stitch, come on, you need to get up!\" she pleaded. Stitch just squeezed his head with a whine. \"Stitch wake up!\" Yuna tried again, a little louder this time. Both of Stitch's eyes opened, but they weren't their healthy black. They had a tinge of grey to them. Yuna was stroking the back of his head when the last thing she expected for him to do happened. He burst into tears. He whined and curled more into himself. \"...naga wanna be sick anymore….make it stop! Naga sick, make it stop!\" he cried, whining in a heartbreaking manner. One could mistake him for a child. Yuna swore her heart was breaking. \"No, no Stitch, shhh, it's ok, I'm here\" she soothed, wrapping him in her blanket, and picking him up. He cried into her shoulder, trembling like a frightened child. \"...make it stop, naga feel good…\" he whined. \"Shh, shh, shh, shh, it's ok, just...just go back to sleep Stitch\" Yuna said softly. She was struggling to hold her own tears back. It took awhile, but eventually, Stitch cried himself to sleep. Yuna never let go of him until she was sure he was fast asleep. When he was, she laid him back down and rushed to put her clothes on. This was serious in her mind. She never saw Stitch cry until now, and it broke her heart. Not when he was betrayed, not when he was hurt. Not even when she herself disowned their friendship. Only when facing his cousin Remmy did he cry, and that wasn't even his fault! When she was dressed, she picked him up gently, and rushed to Jumba and Pleakley's house. When Yuna arrived, she didn't wait for Pleakley to answer the door, she barged right in. \"Pleakley! Pleakley, he's getting worse!\" she cried. Seeing as he was in her arms, Stitch grabbed his ears and whined. The noise made the thumping in his head worse. \"Pleakley screamed at the sudden intruder, but calmed when he noticed it was Yuna. \"Yuna, he has a cold\" Pleakley said calmly. \"Look at him Pleakley! Does this look like a cold to you?\" She shouted at him. That woke Stitch up, and he began to cry again. \"Oh my...Little Monster?\" Pleakley asked. Stitch sobbed, holding his head as if it was about to explode. \"Make it stop! Naga, it hurts, make it stop!\" he cried. Pleakley went pale at the sight, running up the stairs. Yuna followed. She tried to soothe Stitch while waiting for Jumba to answer. \"Shhh, go back to sleep Stitch, go back to sleep\" she tried to say. He only sobbed louder into her shoulder. He began to cough uncontrollably. \"..Ahh! Jumba, of all the times you chose not to answer!\" Pleakley shouted, banging the table. He ran back over to Yuna and looked at Stitch. He took him from her arms. \"Go get him some water from the kitchen\" Pleakley shouted. \"But, Pleakley!\" \"Ahhooow!\" Stitch screamed in pain, holding his head. \"Go, and get him a bowl too!\" he ordered. Yuna finally realized the longer she waited, the more pain Stitch was in. She ran and quickly got a large bowl and a glass of water. Pleakley on the other hand, turned on the Fusion Chamber, and set Stitch in it. Stitch was holding his head in pain, trembling, and rocking side to side slowly. Tears streamed down his face, and he cried out for someone to make it stop. His head felt like hammers were banging directly on his brain. \"Jumba! Make it stop! Please make it stop!\" Stitch called. He knew if anyone could help him, his creator could. He always was the one who could fix any problems. He just wanted it to stop. Pleakley got a wet rag and placed it on his forehead. Yuna came up at that moment with the cup of water and the bowl. She was crying from both seeing and hearing her best friend in such pain. \"What do we do Pleakley?\" Yuna asked. She was shifting nervously, crying and anxious to help her ohana. \"I….I don't know Yuna. We...we just have to wait for Jumba to call back\" he replied. They both went back to soothing Stitch, cleaning up any vomit he threw up, and to keeping him both warm and cool. Sometimes he would be sleeping, and other times he would cry out for someone to help him. Jumba was the main person he cried for, followed by Yuna and Lilo. Only one of them was there to calm him down. It was way past midnight when Jumba finally called back. Stitch was asleep and Pleakley and Yuna were, in a word, traumatized. \"26 calls Pleakley! Seriously, can evil genius not be gone for more than one day?\" Jumba yelled annoyed. Yuna glared at him, but at hearing Stitch whine, she hushed him and plugged his ears. With that being done, Pleakley gave Jumba a piece of his mind. \"Well, maybe if said 'evil genius' weren't wrong about a certain someone having a 'cold', we wouldn't need to call you so much! Do you know what even happened?!\" he started. \"No, so please to be enlightening Jumba\". \"Well, your Little Monster does not in fact have a cold. We have no idea what he has! Yuna brought him here early this morning, and guess what?! The Little Monster was bawling and screaming out in pain! He's been on and off throwing up, crying, and coughing, and what were you doing? Off doing whatever it is you evil genius' do! I swear when you get back you'll never hear the end of it!\" he ranted. Jumba groaned. \"Pleakley, Jumba is not having time for games! Is needing…\" at that moment, all the fighting woke up Stitch, despite the covered ears. He began his routine of crying. \"Just look at him Jumba! Look at him and tell us it's a joke!\" Pleakley interrupted. Yuna picked him up, Stitch all but sobbing in pain. His head was in a constant exploding pain. His body was on fire, and his lungs felt like they were being stabbed with each breath. \"Make it stop! Make it stop, please I'll do anything! Lilo! Yuna, SOMEONE! Please!\" He cried. The only pain that topped this one was when his circuits burned out from his glitch. \"Please, Someone! Jumba help me, please! Stitch soka, just make it stop!\" he continued. Jumba was rendered speechless. Never had any of his experiments cried out to him like that. With his finest creation being the one to do it made it all the worse. \"626...Stitch\" he said softly, but firmly. \"Oww!\" he cried, gripping the fur on his head. \"He's not very coherent right now Jumba. He's in too much pain\" Yuna choked out. \"Pleakley, go in cabinet above Jumba's desk. In there you will find some syringes with a yellow medicine in them\" Jumba said. Pleakley followed his orders like clockwork, picking up a small syringe. \"Inside is sedative that will knock 626 out for 12 hours. Give shot to him in his thigh\" Jumba ordered. Pleakley tried, but Stitch kept thrashing. \"Stitch, shhh, it's ok, I'm here, shhh\" Yuna whispered in his ear. He let out a choked sob and shook his head. \"Make it stop, it hurts!\" he cried out. Yuna took a quick seat in the open Fusion Chamber and began her normal routine of trying to get him back to sleep. She began to sing her Ichariba Chode song while rubbing his back. He stopped thrashing but was curled up on his side, bawling. She took the syringe from Pleakley and positioned it on his thigh. She bit her lip and lightly stabbed it in, earning a small shriek from Stitch. She picked him back up and continued with her singing, and before long Stitch was knocked out in her arms. She broke down crying afterward. \"Jumba is leaving right now. Will be home before noon tomorrow\" Jumba said, pressing a few buttons on his ship. Pleakley was sitting next to Yuna rubbing her and Stitch's back. \"Keep him sedated until Jumba gets back\" Jumba said finally, turning off his camera. Neither Yuna or Pleakley said anything for awhile. It was quiet aside from Yuna's crying until a phone rang. Pleakley got up to get it. \"Hello?\" he said. \"Oh, hey Tigerlily. Yep, she's right here. Look, now isn't the best time to be giving any lectures. The Little Monster is badly sick, and it took until a few minutes ago for Jumba to call back. You what? Alright then, why don't you come over hear and listen to him scream bloody murder in pain! That's what he's been doing every moment he's awake!\" Yuna lifted her head up from Stitch's fur. She was in no mood to hear Tigerlily yelling at her. \"Well, that's because Jumba showed us where the sedatives are! Fine! If you wanna come over and see for yourself, go for it! But it's your funeral!\" Pleakley finally shouted, slamming the phone back onto the wall. Back with Tigerlily, she seriously thought Stitch was faking it. She locked up the house and made her way to Jumba and Pleakley's house, ready to give both Stitch and Yuna a piece of her mind. When she approached however, she saw a few neighbors out. \"Hey, do you live here?\" one guy asked. \"No, but my friends do\" she answered in her sweet voice. The guy looked crabby and mad. \"Well, tell them to stop screaming in there! It's almost one o' clock in the morning, and some people need to sleep!\" He shouted, heading back into his house with a few other angry neighbors following. She would never admit it, but that startled her more then anyone would ever know. She went into the pink house and dropped her bag on the couch. She walked upstairs to Jumba's lab, seeing Pleakley asleep in Jumba's chair. Yuna was sitting on a stool next to the Fusion Chamber, Stitch inside of it. Tigerlily didn't keep an angry face as the scene was sad. The air in the room was empty feeling, and it affected her greatly. She walked over to the Fusion Chamber and looked at Stitch inside. Although sedated, he was pale and shivering. He was still in his onesie, a rare sight for Tigerlily, and he was curled into a ball. Yuna didn't look at her as she spoke. \"He can't fake a high fever like this, or s..screams like that. He's never been sick before, so how would he know what it's like?\" she said with a hoarse voice of her own. Tigerlily didn't say anything. They both just watched him until they both fell asleep. Yuna was the first one to wake up the next day. She awoke to the sound of a landing ship. It took her a few seconds for her brain to catch up, but when it did she realized that it must have been Jumba returning. Tigerlily was nowhere in sight and Pleakley was still slumped in Jumba's chair, asleep. Yuna sat up from the glass of the Fusion Chamber and looked down at the shivering form before her. Not much had changed about Stitch in the time she'd been asleep. In fact, he actually looked paler if she was being honest. She looked at the bar lines on the screen next to the glass to see the first bar and half of the second were no longer green like they should be. She gasped as, only in dire times had those green bars ever went down. She put her hand on the glass, too worried for her own good. Jumba came up the steps not a few minutes later. She looked at him disheartened. Jumba set some of his things down, and walked over to the chamber to look at his creation. He was quiet as he observed his experiment. Yuna couldn't read his expression when he looked at the green chart that showed Stitch's health status. \"If correct, have another hour before sedation wears off. Can be doing tests until then\" he said suddenly. Opening the machine, Jumba grabs his best creation and looks him up and down. Stitch never wore his onesie anymore, and when he did was usually for a special reason. Or a bad one. So, Yuna watched for the next hour as Jumba ran blood tests, did scans, ran labs. Never once did her eyes leave her best friend. Jumba was looking on his computer when Stitch began to wake up. It started as a twitch of his fingers, then a flick of his ears. Having been watching him for the past hour, Yuna noticed right away as he began waking up. \"Jumba, I think he's waking up!\" Yuna said, jumping up, and running over to the table he was on. She ran her hand through the fur on his head, trying to sooth him before he started crying again. He began moving more and more as he came to, whining every now and then. Jumba eyed him every few minutes, but kept his attention on the screen in front of him, typing faster than any human could. It was only when Stitch cracked his eyes open did Jumba remove himself from the screen. \"Stitch? How are you feeling?\" Yuna asked. Stitch didn't respond, he just looked around in a daze. \"Is still sedated little girl. Just not enough to keep him unconscious\" Jumba answered. He held a light up to Stitch's eyes, flashing the light back and forth. It took Stitch a few seconds to respond to the light, flinching and shutting his eyes again. \"Reactions are slow, even for sedative\" Jumba thought out loud. He snapped his fingers right at his ears and it only registered a few seconds later, much like his eyesight. Stitch began his typical whining, curling more into his stomach like before. Yuna was about to sooth him when Jumba pulled him over to his metal desk. He placed a large finger on Stitch's abdomen and he flinched. \"Stomach is sensitive\" he mumbled. Stitch began to sob now, clawing at his head like before. Jumba noticed this instantly and began to pry his little blue paws away from his head. \"626, look at me\" Jumba asked firmly. Stitch didn't. His head moved around in a daze, like delirium. He was rasping in breaths and coughing harshly. Something old, but worse in his case. At that moment a machine beeped, catching Jumba's attention. Still holding the sobbing experiment, he picked up the printed results of what appeared to be blood test results. \"Huh..\" he said, giving Stitch a strange look. \"What? What is it?\" Yuna burst out, extremely worried. \"Results are showing that 626 had caught Earth pneumonia. But, even with experiments, shouldn't be this bad\" he mumbled, handing Stitch over to Yuna who was looking a bit dumbstruck. \"Pn..pneumonia?\" Yuna gasped. Author's Note: Hey Everyone! I know, I know, this isn't a Lilo and Stitch story, but I thought of this idea and thought it would be worth a shot. Anime or not, let me know what you think; if you like it, or if you don't. Should be interesting either way. ","Summary":" It was a typical day at Newtown. The sun was shining, there was a slight tropical breeze from the o"},{"Movie":"Lilo & Stitch","Title":"Lilo and Stitch a Different Way","Author":"TheNaturalLlama3","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12846319","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Lilo's POV It started out as a normal day for me. Well, if normal is Nani taking me to Hula class, getting teased by the others, and Moses telling me to calm down. Mertle had told me I was crazy and I hit her. And bit her. I guess I deserved the scold by Moses, but Mertle had it coming! \"Lilo!\" Moses called. \"I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I won't do it again!\" I called. \"Maybe we should call your sister\". \"No! I'll be good, I wanna dance! I practiced! I just wanna dance, I practiced...\" I faded. Moses rubbed his face, clearly displeased. \"Ew, she bit me\" Mertle said. All the others 'ewwed', a small armadillo-looking alien named Caro shoved her arm away in disgust. A few minutes later, I was sitting on the stairs out of my Hula stuff. Everyone else burst through the doors to be picked up. It had been about 4 years since Earth had discovered life beyond itself and united with the United Galactic Federation. Since then, aliens from all over moved to Earth, trading knowledge and supplies. It put all fantasys of an alien invasion to rest, sadly in my case. I always thought it would be cool to have Earth be invaded by hostile aliens and have Earth save itself, but what's done is done. Dad used to say not to take things for granted, otherwise we'd pay the price. Back then I didn't really care for the saying. But after the accident….both me and Nani have been very thankful. Nani was struggling with keeping me and the house, thanks to social security on her back. I know I wasn't helping her when I defied her; leaving the house when I'm not supposed to, causing trouble in Hula, not waiting for her to pick me up, ext. But what Nani and my babysitter Pleakley fail to realize is even though I'm only 6, almost 7, life isn't a breeze for me either. I talk to Nani and Pleakley about the other bullies in my Hula class, but Nani is too busy to do anything about it, and Pleakley is physically and mentally incapable of doing harm to anyone. Even when he tries to be intimidating. \"I called your sister. She said Pleakley would come to get you. We'll try again tomorrow\". I sighed. Just then a large, (and I mean large!) purple, 4 eyed alien walked up holding a smaller, dog-like alien's hand. \"Excusing me, but is there a Moses being here?\" I just pointed inside, face expressionless. The dog-like alien looked at me and smiled. He was such a...how do I put it? Weird looking alien, even for an alien. He had large black eyes, blue fur, and paws with large ears going a foot over his head. Each ear had a chip in it. He walked on two feet, but looked like he could go on all fours as well. I looked away angrily. I wasn't in the mood for more taunting. \"Will 626 be staying out here?\". \"Ih\"; he gave the dog-like alien a fond smile. \"Very well\" and walked into the school. He approached me. \"Hi?\" I looked away. \"Yugga new here?\" I gave him a dumbfounded look. \"I'm Hawaiian! Of course I'm not new here!\" He flinched back and I instantly regretted my words. He sat down next to me, though. There was an awkward silence before \"Yugga..h..have bad day?\". I looked down sadly. \"Yeah. I got in some trouble\". \"For what?\". I looked over at him. His legs were straight out and he had his arms straight, hands balled up together in a childlike manner. His head was tilted sideways, making him look really cute. \"I hit a girl in my class\". \"Yugga hit?\" \"uha. Before I bit her\". \"Yugga bite?\" I nodded, waiting for him to yell or something. \"M..must have m..made yugga mad\". I looked over to him a little shocked. \"You don't think I'm crazy or weird for doing it?\" He looked a little confused. \"Naga. Owner says n..normal\". I don't know why but I kind of brightened up at this. Just as I was about to introduce myself, his 'owner' came out. \"Thankings you very much. Alright 626, let's be going\". He held his hand out and the blue guy took it. \"Bye! N..nice to meet yugga\" he said with a smile. And for once, I smiled back. Pleakley came by shortly after that. He inspected me like I was about to die. All he heard from Nani was that I was in a fight, not that I caused the fight. I held his hand on the way back to the house. \"So Pleakley, did you see anyone new around?\". \"Define new? Because there's temporary new, staying for a while new, finding something new, new trends..\" \"I mean, like, more aliens new?\". \"Uhh, no. Why?\" \"I saw a few new aliens around and was wondering if you knew anything about that?\" \"No, I haven't. Must be new comers! Oh, maybe this is the perfect time to wear my new welcoming outfit!\" He said. Now Pleakley was a bit...weird. Like me! Though, he finds his happiness with studying Earth and what it has to offer. Mostly fashion. He typically finds more fashion in girl stuff so he dresses like a girl most of the time. We got back to the house and my mind drifted to that blue alien. Why did he seem so..different from everyone else? He didn't seem to think me weird or a freak like everybody else I've met. Of course, he hasn't met everyone else so he'll probably follow them instead of me. It's sad too, because he seemed really nice. 'Oh quiet Lilo, what do you care? He'll probably follow Mertle and her gang in taunting me anyways' I sighed and laid on the floor, putting on an Elvis record. Pleakley rummaged around in the kitchen, most likely cleaning up. After the accident, he's come over more frequently. We consider him Ohana, Nani and I. Bet you're wondering what that means, well…. \"Hey guys, I'm home!\" Nani called. I didn't move. \"Oh, hi Nani, how was work?\" Pleakley said. \"Oh, same as usual\". She looked at me and I turned the record player up, mouthing the lyrics. I felt her walk over and sit behind me. She began stroking my hair. \"Lilo, honey..\" \"I don't want to talk about it, so don't make me!\" \"Lilo, you know you can't go around causing trouble whenever you feel like it\". I sat up and pouted, facing away from her. I sighed. \"People treat me different\". I mumbled. She pulled me into her lap. \"They..they just don't know what to say\". I turned around and gave her a hug. \"Shhh, it's ok baby\". The lights flickered and a whooshing noise came from outside. I walked over to the window as the lights went out. A small meteor was going to crash in the woods. Some officers on police cruisers rode in and blew it up before it hit the ground. The lights came back on. \"I call it! Get out, get out, I have to make a wish!\" I said pushing Pleakley and Nani out of the kitchen. \"Oh..no! Gravity's increasing on me again\" Nani said, slowly falling. \"No it's not!\" I shouted. \"It is too Lilo, the same thing happened yesterday\" she said calmly before going limp. \"You rotten sister, your butt is crushing me!\" I shouted, crawling out from under her. \"Why do you act so weird!\" I shouted slamming the door a little too hard on her head. \"Ooo, random falling rocks from space grant wishes? Fascinating\" I heard Pleakley say. I kneeled on the floor, pressing my palms together. \"It's me again. I need someone to be my friend. Someone who won't run away. Maybe send me an angel! The nicest angel you have\". I walked into Hula today and saw the blue alien again. He was looking around the room at all of the Hula stuff in a Hula outfit. I walked over to him. \"Hi\" I said. He jumped and yelped. Looking he saw it was me. \"Oh, um, Hi?\" He said with a sheepish smile. I giggled. \"So, I never got to introduce myself yesterday. My name's Lilo\". He gave a wide smile. \"Meega 626, but yuuga call me Stitch\". \"Stitch?\" He nodded. He seemed so Naive. It was really cute. \"So, are you knew here?\" He nodded. \"I've never seen an alien like you. What kind are you?\". \"Naga kind. Meega made in lab. Stitch special\". \"Wow, you were made in a lab?\" \"Ih\". \"Cool!\" Mertle decided now was the time to bug me. \"Hello Weird-lo\". Stitch burst out laughing. \"What's so funny?!\" She asked him. He laughed a little before saying \"Yugga pronounced name w..wrong\", giggling every now and then. \"What? No, I…\" \"Name is Lilo. LEE LOW\" he pronounced. I laughed. Mertle's face grew red in anger and embarrassment. \"I meant to say it like that!\" He still was giggling. \"Yuuga sound weird s..saying 'Weird lo', hehehe\" he said, laughing again. \"What?! Who do you think you are, blue ?\" Caro said. Stitch recovered. \"Meega Stitch!\" Mertle 'pffed'. \"And you think I'm weird?! Your name is the definition of weird\". Stitch didn't seemed fazed. \"Who yuuga?\". \"Me? I'm about the most important person you'll ever meet. EVER! I, am Mertle Edmonds\". \"Mertle? Naga heard that before. Yugga sure yuuga important?\" I covered my mouth in an attempt to stifle my laughter. He's so clueless! \"Am I sure!?\" My laughing was harder to hide, mostly because Stitch looked genuinely confused. He looked to me. \"It...it's fine Stitch. Go easy on him Mertle, he's new\". \"Well, new or not he should be more respectful of future princesses!\" She said while walking away. \"Stitch...don't get it\" he said scratching his head. I giggled; \"It's ok Stitch, you'll get used to it. Come on, class will start soon\". I said grabbing his hand, walking over to a random spot on the floor. \"Ok, do we have everyone?\" Moses asked. No one spoke against it, so he started. I noticed him wave Stitch up to the front. \"Everybody, I'd like you to meet Stitch, he's new to Earth and Hawaii, so he'll need all of your help to get used to living here. Stitch, would you like to say something?\" He brought his claw to his mouth in thought. \"Naga\". \"Alright, go on and take a seat then\". He smiled and walked crawled back over to me on all fours. I smiled back. Moses went through the routine with us, having Stitch sit out to watch us practice. Once we finished our rehearsal, Moses helped each individual with their dances. He started with the teenagers first. I walked over to Stitch. \"What did you think of the dance?\" \"Isa good!\". I pulled him up and began to teach him some of the moves. \"Like this?\" He asked. I moved his hips more to the side and checked. \"Now you can try\". He moved his hips and arms, mimicking the dance moves. I got to say, for someone who just learned the dance and has never been to Hawaii, he did great! \"Wow! You're a natural!\" He shied away a little, smiling. \"Stitch do good?\". I nodded. \"So, Yuuga have family?\". It was an innocent question, but it cut me deep. My face dropped and all enthusiasm left my mind. \"Lilo?\". He stopped dancing. I just turned away. \"I...I..it..it's complicated\" I said quietly. I heard a few whining noises. \"Soka. Naga mean to m...make sad\" he said quietly. I gave a small smile, but looked away. \"C..compi...complic..cated for S..Stitch too\". I looked back at him swiftly after he said that. His ears were hanging down lifelessly and he was hunched over a little, rubbing his hands on his elbows. I smiled sadly at him, silently shocked he knew my pain. \"It's ok. You couldn't have known\". His face remained sad, but his ears lifted up. \"Lilo! You're up next\" Moses called. I smiled at Stitch and ran over to Moses. Stitch's POV I watched as Lilo ran over to Moses, mood saddened. I hoped her family wasn't as cruel as what I consider mine. My creator is nice to me, always kind and helpful, but my owner wants me to do bad things. If I don't, I get thrown into punishment. I shiver as I'm reminded of it. My siblings were all put away until needed, leaving me on my own. Some were helpful, and some were not. 621 I saw as an older brother figure. He taught me everything I know and what to watch out for. For this he was dehydrated. We as experiments aren't supposed to interact with other creatures outside of Jumba and him , otherwise we could get attached and fail our missions. To be honest, I don't want to do the things he makes me do, but it's either this or the punisher, and I'm more towards the job. But Lilo..she was different from everyone else I've met. She knows so much for a six year old, and seems so lonely. It reminds me of myself. They all think I'm 6, and just another transfer from a distant galaxy, but I'm not. I'm a monster. Unlike Lilo who fears being weird, I fear being the monster I was created as. I honestly don't know what I'm supposed to be, but I know it's not good. Otherwise I could be living the life everyone thinks I am. I snap out of my thoughts as I hear the small group of humans talking about Lilo. \"She's so weird! I mean, come on! Her hair is always down straight, she's always in that stupid red mumu, and she's always carrying around that ugly doll!\" I heard the redhead say. I guess that explains why she was in a bad mood yesterday if they constantly talk about her like that. \"That was beautiful, Lilo. Alright, Elena you're up next\" Moses called. Lilo ran back over to me. I gave her a thumbs up. \"So that guy who brought you here yesterday. Was he your dad, or something?\". 'I wish' I thought. \"Naga. Is creator. Made meega b..by accident\" I say, using the cover story that's been drilled into my head. \"Wouldn't that still make him your dad?\" I shake my head. \"He naga like to think so\". She gave me a small smile. \"Yeah. I have a hard time remembering my parents sometimes…\" I look on, hoping nothing bad happened. \"There was an accident, and they….\" she stopped, looking about to cry. I rested a paw on her arm. \"Naga n..need say if too hard\". She sniffed. \"Thanks\". The rest of the time she showed me how to dance and what the routine was for the concert the next week. Aside from the sad moments of family talk, it was a fun day. Up until the redhead, Mertle decided to step in. Lilo was showing me her doll, Scrump when a paper airplane hit my head. I looked over to see the small group look over evilly. I grabbed the paper plane before Lilo and opened it. It said 'Weird-lo and Blue' on it, pretty sloppily with a heart around it. I stand up and walk over to the teacher. \"Stitch, don't. It's fine\". I heard Lilo behind me, but I didn't stop. I pulled lightly on Moses' skirt thingy. I put on the biggest kicked puppy look I could when he looked down. \"Oh Stitch, what's wrong?\" I made my bottom lip tremble and handed him the plane, pointing at the group. \"Theygga threw at meega\". He opened it, and got a saddened look. The group was too busy laughing at us to notice. He walked me over to them and asked \"Kids, what is the meaning of this?\" They all stopped laughing. Lilo looked at me from across the room. I looked back at her and winked. She huffed in disbelief. What can I say? I'm a little devil when I want to be. I turned back to the group, a look of heartbreak on my face. \"This is no way to treat someone. Especially someone new. You should all feel ashamed of yourselves\" he said softly. 'He lets them off too easy' I thought. \"But we didn't do anything!\" Mertle said with fake innocence. 'Man, Ex. 604 could have done better acting! And he's a rabbit!' I thought. \"Mertle, tell the truth. I would hate to have to talk with all of your parents because of this\" he said. I whined, rubbing the spot where it hit my head. Lilo ran over to me. \"Stitch, are you ok?!\" she asked in a small panic. I could see her following my lead. \"Oh, come on, I didn't even throw it that hard!\" she finally said. Then she covered her mouth after. Moses let out a breath of disappointment. \"I'm sorry Mertle, but this behavior can't go unnoticed. I will have to talk to your mom\". \"What!? But, I didn't do anything wrong!\" she said again. \"That's enough Mertle\". Lilo gave me a hug, and I gave my devilish smile at them. She looked at me with daggers. They all looked a little scared at that. After class ended, me and Lilo waited outside for her sister. \"Can I h..hold her?\" I asked, referring to Scrump. She smiled and I held her doll. I'd never seen a doll before until the one she let me hold. \"It's cool!\" I said. \"Not it Stitch! She !\" she pushed. \"Oh, sorry\". \"Well, if you'd call that cool\" I heard Mertle say. I turned to look at her and smiled. \"Hi\" I said overly cheerfully. \"Don't hi me! I know what you did. And you should feel lucky that I'm not going to punish you for it\" she said as if she had a hold of the situation. \"Not, or can't?\" I asked. Lilo giggled. She growled. \"You better hope you don't run into me again, furr ball ..\" she got close to my face. \"...because around here, I , am queen\". I just smiled and gave her a nice, slobbery lick across the face. \"ACK!\" She said. \"Stitch!\" I heard Moses say. I looked at him with bright eyes. \"What?\". \"We don't lick other people\". \"Oh. Soka, wanted to a..apolo..gise for making mad\". I said guilty. He rubbed my head. \"It's alright, just be sure not to do it again, ok?\" I nodded and smiled. She called out to Mertle and she with her possey walked away. \"Stitch naga like her. M..mean\". Lilo got sad. \"Yeah, she's usually like that. It's why I get in trouble a lot\". \"Isa okeytaka. J..just play it off cool! Like meega!\" I said. She smiled. \"Yeah, it was pretty fun to get her in trouble, huh?\" I nodded. \"So, do you wanna come over to my house? It'll be fun!\". I thought it over. He wouldn't like it very much. But, she's nice to me. Not mean, or harsh like him. \"Sounds like f..fun!\" I say after a minute. Her eyes lit up like a supernova. A few minutes later an older girl ran up to us. She looked rather similar to Lilo, so I figured it was her sister. \"Nani! Nani! I made a new friend!\" Lilo said, running up to her sister with excitement. \"Did you now?\" she asked, humoring her. Lilo looked at me and waved me over. \"Come on Stitch!\". I smiled and hopped over to her. \"Hi\" I said. She looked at me a little weird. \"Hi?\" \"This is Stitch, Nani. I met him yesterday. He's new\". I smiled one of my harmless smiles. \"Ok, anyways, baby I have to work late today, so Pleakley will be watching you until I get home, alright?\" She nodded. \"Oh yeah! I invited Stitch over to play, can he?\" She asked. \"Lilo, I don't think….\" me and Lilo looked at her, holding our hands close to our faces and saying \"Pleeeeeeaaaaassee?\". She laughed. \"Ok, ok. Just make sure it's alright with his parents, ok?\" I nodded, and we both ' yes-ed '. Lilo's sister walked us back to their house. It was isolated from the rest of the town. It was through the wooded area, through a creek, and up a hill, right next to a small lake. It looked really cozy. \"Ooo\" I said. Lilo and me ran up to the door and she opened it. \"This is my house! It's not very bright like the other houses, but it's good!\". I smiled. 'So this is what a home looks like' I thought. I looked around and sniffed a few things. I heard a 'beep, beep' noise and looked at Nani. \"Awe man; look, Honey, I gotta head back to work. Until Pleakley gets here, stay up in your room, lock the door, and don't answer for anyone..\" \"Don't answer for anyone, I know Nani\" Lilo copied. Nani bent down and gave Lilo a kiss on her forehead. \"Alright see you at dinner\". She then turned and walked out the door. I sat there, looking on a bit sadly and empty. I didn't know why. \"Are you ok Stitch?\" Lilo asked. I shook my head. \"Yeah, Meega Fluffy!\" I said, raising my arms. She giggled and ruffled the fur on my head. \"You're right! You're really fluffy!\". I giggled this time. She led me up to her room and said \"This is my room! Isn't it neat?\". I nodded vigorously. \"Isa lot b..bigger than Stitch's room\". \"It is? Where do you live?\". \"Live in ship with creator. Isa big, but naga meant for living. M..more for S..sien...science!\".

Love As A Family Stich hung his head as he saw Lilo and the others having a great time. Even though the alien counsel said he could stay, he still felt bad about what he felt he put Lilo and Nani through. \"I need to go,\" he said quietly to himself. \"Stich?\" A voice asked. He almost jumped out of his skin as he turned and saw Nani look at him. \"Are you alright?\" Stitch sadly looked away and he tried not to make eye contact. \"Stitch?\" She asked, now walking over and trying to make him look at her. \"Stitch, look at me.\" \"Nani…,\" \"Finally…he speaks.\" She chuckled, now sitting down in front of him. She had become very fond of the little alien that she now called brother. \"Now what's going on?\" \"Nani…Stitch must go.\" He said sadly. \"What?!\" She said in shock. \"What are you talking about?!\" \"After all that happened, I need to go. I cause enough trouble,\" he said quietly. \"Oh now, come on; it was a mess, but we made it. We're Ohana!\" she said, now looking at him. \"B-But…,\" \"No buts, Stitch; now c'mon…it's time for a swim. Let's go,\" she smiled. \"Sorry, Nani, but Stitch can't swim,\" he replied. \"I know. But we created a shallow pool. That way you will be safe, now c'mon!\" She said, now coaxing him towards the door. \"B-But Nani…,\" Stitch protested. \"Now stop that, Stitch; I HEY!\" She said as he accidentally moved and she fell on the sofa. \"Nani! Nani! Sorry!\" Stitch said, now running over, but he gulped as she moved her hair from her face and smiled deviously. \"Oh, that does it! C'mere!\" She said, now jumping up and chasing him! Stitch didn't know whether to be afraid or excited! Nani was definitely a force to be reckoned with. \"N-Nani! Nani, no!\" Stitch begged, trying to get away and not sure what she was going to do. \"Come back here, Stitch!\" Nani laughed, now running and pouncing on him. Soon they both went rolling on the floor and landed among some beanbags. Stitch tried to get up, but Nani pinned him down and held his hands. \"Now listen, you little alien. No one leaves this family. We love you, Stich.\" \"But Nani, Stitch can be so much trouble.\" He said sadly. \"Stitch, no, you're not. All of that was just a misunderstanding. What is most important is that we are all together now,\" Nani smiled, now bending down towards his face. Stitch gasped and closed his eyes, unsure of what she was going to do. But his eyes opened when he felt a gentle kiss on his forehead. \"Do you believe me now?\" Stitch blushed a bit and Nani only giggled. \"Why Stitch, are you blushing?\" She smiled, now bending down and planting more kisses on his face. \"Eeeheeeeheeeheeheeeheehee, Nahahani! Nohoho!\" Stitch giggled. \"What's wrong, Stitch? Ticklish?\" she grinned deviously, now letting his arms go and wiggling her fingers on his furry stomach. Stitch was literally in stitches as Nani grabbed him as he tried to get away. She held him with his back to her chest and sat down against the wall for support. \"Nope! Not gonna let you go, ya little blue troublemaker,\" she chuckled, now letting him rest a bit. As Stitch panted, he felt her rubbing his head gently. \"We love you, Stitch.\" \"B-But…,\" Nani responded by planting more ticklish kisses on his face and tickling his neck and stomach. Stitch was literally in stitches and he couldn't escape her! After a few moments, Stitch appeared tired and exhausted. \"C'mon, Stitch. How about a nap and then you can join us in the pool later?\" Nani cooed, now picking him up and hugging him to her chest. \"N-Nani, Stitch is still sorry…I….\" But he could say no more as she placed a gentle finger to his lips and hushed him gently. \"Hush now…everything is okay. We are family and no matter what, we will always be together,\" Nani cooed quietly, now hugging him and running her hands over his head until he was slowly falling asleep. \"Thank you, Nani. I love you,\" Stitch cooed, now rubbing against her and falling asleep. Nani kissed him gently on his head as she watched him go to sleep. Lilo came in a few moments later and grinned at the cute sight. \"Is he okay?\" \"He's fine, Lilo.\" Nani reassured her. \"He just needed some reassurance.\" \"What kind of reassurance?\" She asked, now sitting down next to them. \"The reassurance that no matter what, we are always family and nothing on this Earth or galaxy will EVER separate us,\" Nani said, now bringing them both closer to her chest and cuddling them. No matter what, they will always be family and be together. guestsurprise's words: A treat for everyone!

College is just a part of life after high school. I won't be there forever. Plus, I'm not leaving until September, we still have the whole summer together!\" Stitch starred blankly at the ocean. \"I wish I could take you, I do.

Nemrég újra megnéztem a Lilo és Stitch filmeket, illetve a sorozatból is láttam pár részt. Ez volt a kedvenc mesém, mielőtt kijött az Így neveld a sárkányodat. Úgy döntöttem ez a franchise is megérdemel pár sztorit. Vannak is terveim. Egyébként pedig, ha valaki nézi a profilom, ott megpróbálom folyamatosan frissíteni a sztori(ai)m állapotát/állapotait. Ez itt csak egy One-shot, remélem tetszeni fog. A Nap már megközelítette a horizontot, de még mindig erős fénnyel árasztotta el a szigetet. Kezdett esteledni. Ekkor nyílt az ajtó és egy viszonylag elszigetelt házból egy lány lépett ki. Ritkán szokott ilyenkor elindulni otthonról, inkább hazafelé szokott tartani ekkortájt, a mai nap viszont szokatlan volt számára. A ház nélküle üres maradt. Mindenki, aki ott lakik, nem tartózkodott ott, abban a pillanatban, amikor a lány kilépett. Ugyan nem volt hideg, a lány mégis vacogott. Egy gyönyörű, piros színű ruha volt rajta, ami ugyan épphogy csak jó volt rá, hiszen már kinőtte, de megfelelt neki. Ez volt a kedvence, talán még most is az. Az enyhe szellő gyengéden mozgatta hosszú, fekete haját. Nem a város felé indult, épp ellenkezőleg. Az erdőben kóborolt, miközben hallgatta, ahogy a szél zörgeti a leveleket és a fák ágait. Hallotta a sok, általa nem látott állat neszeit és hallotta a saját gondolatait is, amint minden egyes lépését megkérdőjelezték, de ő tovább halad előre. Korábban még eszébe sem jutott ilyet csinálni, de most úgy érezte, hogy nincs más választása. Ahogy haladt előre, egyre jobban meggyőzte magát arról, hogy már nincs visszaút. Elbotlott egy gyökérben, aminek egy része kiállt a földből. Halkan elsuttogott egy szitokszót, de többre nem méltatta a dolgot, felállt és ment tovább. Egyre határozottabb léptekkel közeledett úticélja felé. Végül odaért. Ahogyan megpillantotta a helyet, elfogta a kételkedés. Biztos, hogy ez a legjobb? Biztos nincs más választásom? Mi van, ha tévedek? Ilyen gondolatok szöktek a fejébe. Fejét arra fordította, amerről jött. Olyan érzése volt, mintha követték volna, de az igazság az volt, hogy azon a néhány apró erdei állaton kívül, senki sem tartózkodott a közelében. Miután ismét úticéljára emelte tekintetét, vett egy mély levegőt, sóhajtott, ezzel pedig testéből elszállt az eddigi kétség. Egyet előrelépett. Aztán még egyet. És még egyet. Végül ott állt egy fa előtt. Ismerte ezt a fát. Ismerte a történetét. Hogyne ismerte volna, hiszen ő találta ki. A történet maga szomorú, de az idejövetelének oka is az volt, ezért tökéletesen passzolt a helyszín. Ismét sóhajtott, majd nekikezdett az előkészületeknek. Stitch éppen szerelmével sétálgatott a parton, várva a naplementét. Szerettek volna egy fagylaltot nyalni, miközben nézik, ahogy a nagy, fényt adó égitest eltűnik a horizonton. Angel, mert természetesen ő volt a szerelme, elment a fagyos édességért, miközben Stitch egy kövön ülve várta, közben felváltva szemlélte az óceánt és a homokos partvonalat. Szeme végül megakadt egy kis épületen. A kölcsönző volt, ahol Nani dolgozott. Most is ott volt, látta, ahogyan az ablakon keresztül szemléli azokat az embereket, akik úgy döntöttek, hogy a nap vége előtt még meglovagolják egyszer a hullámokat, vagy a gyerekeket, akik még gyorsan befejezik a homokváraikat, mielőtt a szüleik nagy nehezen elvonszolják őket, mondván, majd holnap is kijönnek. A kis kék űrlényt egy szörnyű érzés kerítette hatalmába. Csak most realizálta, hogy már nagyon régen látogatta meg Lilot. Már több hónap is eltelt, mióta utoljára voltak együtt valahol, látta az arcát, vagy hallotta azt a gyönyörű hangját. Annyira Angelre figyelt folyton, hogy el is feledkezett minden másról. - Lilo… - suttogta. Felállt és elindult a kölcsönző felé. Biztos volt benne, hogy Nani nem fog örülni neki, hogy ennyi idő után felbukkan, de kérdezni akart Lilo hogylétéről. Ahogy közeledett és a nő észrevette, arcáról eltűnt a fáradtság, helyét a harag vette át, de aztán közömbös arckifejezésre váltott. Mikor Stitch odaért, várt egy kicsit, hogy Nani szólaljon meg először. de ő csak kereszbetett karokkal figyelte a kék lényt. - Hello Nani! – köszönt, alig hallhatóan Stitch. – Hogy vagy? – hangján még mindig lehetett hallani, hogy nem beszélte teljesen folyékonyan az emberi nyelvet. Ugyan Jumba beépített számára egy programot, amivel sokkal érthetőbben beszélt, de nem tudta tökéletesre fejleszteni, mégis hálás volt érte mindenki, hiszen a kommunikációt jelentős mértékben megkönnyítette. Természetesen Stitch továbbra is beszélt azon az idegen nyelven, de legtöbbször más kísérletekkel. - Hello Stitch! – köszönt vissza a nő. – Jól vagyok. Tőled is megkérdezném ugyanezt, de mivel az utóbbi hónapokban nagyon elfoglalt voltál, gondolom te is jól vagy. – hangja olyan közömbös volt, hogy Stitch fájdalmat érzett tőle a mellkasában. Tudta jól, hogy megérdemelte. Elfeledkezett az ohanaról és ezt nem lehet csak úgy megbocsájtani. – Mit csinálsz itt? – hangzott el az egyszerű kérdés. A kék űrlény csendben volt. Nem akart válaszolni, de nem is kellett neki. Nani tudta jól mit csinál itt. Őket is látta az ablakból, nemcsak az embereket. A hullámok morajlásán és a néha felkiáltó gyerekek hangján kívül kínos csönd telepedett a környékre. Stitch úgy érezte felforr körülötte a levegő. - Hogy van Lilo? – kérdezte, ezzel megtörve a némaságot. - Mit érdekel az téged? – Nani reakciója Stitch számára felért egy hatalmas pofonnal. Akármennyire nem akarta, hogy ilyen bánásmódban részesüljön, tudta, hogy teljes mértékben megérdemli. - Meega… Én… sajnálom… csak azt akartam… - hiába akarta azt mondani, hogy sajnálja, hogy mostantól ismét fog Liloval is foglalkozni, hogy bármit megtesz, amit kér tőle, képtelen volt rá. Pedig komolyan gondolta, amit mondani akart. Tényleg bármire képes lenne, hogy visszanyerje barátja bizalmát, az egész család bizalmát. Jumbat és Pleakleyt sem látta már régóta. De nem tudott több hangot kiadni. Mintha hangszalagjai eltűntek volna. - Tudod te milyen volt neki nélküled? – fakadt ki a nőből, ami meglepte Stitcht, de ezt nem mutatta ki. Lehajtott fejjel hallgatta Nanit. – Olyan szomorú és depressziós volt, hogy még a szüleink halála utáni viselkedését is túlszárnyalta! Jobban hiányolt TÉGED, mint őket! Érted ezt?! Minden nap arra várt, hogy felbukkansz majd és játszotok együtt, vagy mittudomén mit csináltok, de azt EGYÜTT! De hiába várt! Senki sem tudott egy cseppnyi jókedvet sem kiváltani belőle! Pedig próbálkoztunk! Jumba még azt is felajánlotta neki, hogy készít egy új kísérletet, aki pont olyan, mint te, de elutasította, mondván, hogy neki csak TE kellesz! Stitch úgy érezte, hogy már órák óta kiabálnak vele, de tűrte. Végül abbamaradt és ismét néma csend költözött a környezetükbe. Angel ekkor érkezett meg. Hosszú sor állt a fagylaltos előtt. Hallotta ugyan az üvöltést ő is, de nem szentelt különösebb figyelmet neki. Végül megkapta, amiért várt és elindult volna vissza a sziklához, de már onnan látta, hogy senki sincs ott. Ekkor körülnézett és megpillantotta a fiúját. Ekkor jött rá mindenre. Stitch-csel kiabáltak, mert elhagyta Lilot. A nőstény kísérlet szívébe fájdalom költözött. Az ő hibája volt minden. Úgy emlékezett a napra, mintha tegnap lett volna. Stitch-csel nagyon jól szórakoztak valahol az erdőben, mikor a kék lény mondta, hogy mennie kell, mert megígérte Lilonak, hogy együtt elmennek a tengerpartra. Nem volt újdonság, Angel tudta, hogy Stitch vele is és Liloval is szeretne valamennyi időt tölteni, de minden egyes alkalommal, mikor Stitch elment, úgy érezte, hogy nem szeretne vele tölteni több időt. Ez természetesen nem volt igaz, de a rózsaszín nőstény féltékeny volt Lilora, hiszen Stitch körülbelül ugyanannyi időt szánt rá, mint őrá, holott Angel volt a barátnője. Akkor először nem hagyta az egészet szó nélkül. Megragadta a karját, magához húzta, majd megcsókolta. - Naga! Maradj Angellel! Még kicsit! – mondta neki a csók után. Ahogy Stitch, úgy Angel is átesett egy beszédfejlesztő programon, így ő is viszonylag érthetően beszélt emberi nyelven. Stitch ugyan nehéz szívvel, de vele maradt még órákig. Mikor végleg elment, Angel nagyon boldognak érezte magát. Megtette ezt érte, tehát ő volt a fontosabb, nem Lilo. Másnap, mikor találkoztak, Stitch elmesélte neki, hogy Lilo ugyan csalódott volt, de megértette és azt mondta, hogy annyi időt töltök veled, amennyit csak akarok. Ez indította el az egészet. Angel egyre több közös időtöltést akart, végül megkérte Stitcht, hogy éljen vele. Angel az erdőben élt, elég nehezen lehetett megtalálni a házát. Jumba épített neki egy kis viskót. Azért akart ilyen elszigetelten élni, mert szeretett énekelni, de azt nem akarta, hogy valakit véletlenül ismét gonosszá változtasson. Stitch vonakodva ugyan, de elfogadta az ajánlatot. Akkor találkozott utoljára Liloval. Angel látta rajta, hogy hiányzik neki a lány, de nem érdekelte. Nem akarta, hogy bárki is közéjük álljon. Hónapokkal később már Stitch teljesen elfeledkezett Liloról. Angel szomorú tekintettel indult el a bódé felé. Ahogy körbenézett látta, ahogyan egy baráti társaság éppen indulni készül. Két férfi volt ott két nővel, két pár. Viszont volt ott még kettő másik férfi is. Ők igazából egy négyes baráti társaság voltak. Mindannyiukon látszott, hogy jól szórakoztak, noha volt szerelem is a csapaton belül, ez nem akadályozta meg őket, hogy hatan együtt jól ellegyenek. A rózsaszín lényt ez a látvány csak megerősítette abban, hogy hibázott. Ahogy tovább lépdelt a kölcsönző felé, érezte, hogy a szél egy kicsit felerősödik és némi homokot fújt az arcába. Szemét becsukta, mancsait az arca elé tette. Ám a légmozgás gyorsan alább hagyott, így néhány pislogás után, minden rendben lett. Ahogy odaért, már elcsitultak a viszonyok, Stitch pedig elindult a szikla felé, ahonnan jött. Észre sem vette az ő boojiboo-ját, aki eldobta a fagylaltot, amiért annyit várakozott, majd mikor beérte, megfogta a vállát. - Boojiboo… Gaba a baj? Segíthetek? – kérdezte tőle. Ugyan tudta, mi bántja Stitch lelkét, de szerette volna hallani tőle, mintegy megerősítésként. - Stitch szomorú. – válaszolta a kék lény rövid hallgatás után. – Hiányzik Lilo. Elfelejtettem őt. Megyek megnézni. – gyengéden megfogta Angel kezét, majd elemelte a válláról, ezután elindult. - Meega megy veled. – szólt utána Angel, majd sietett, hogy beérje Stitcht. Egymás kezét fogva értek a házhoz, ahol a szeretnivaló kislány lakott. Ugyan már nem volt kislány, hiszen tizenkét évesen már nem mondanak ilyet valakinek, Stitch számára mindig ugyanaz fog maradni. Kopogás nélkül mentek be. A nappali sötét volt és üres. Olyan volt, mintha egy régóta elhagyatott házba léptek volna be. Stitch azonnal elindult a toronyszoba felé, ami Lilo szobája. Korábban ő is ott aludt. Angel eközben a földszinten nézett körbe, hátha a lány valahol ott van lent. Stitch amint felért a szobába a lifttel, megdöbbenve tapasztalta, hogy üres. Arrá számított volna, hogy az ágyán fekve fogja találni a lányt, de nem ez történt. Beleszagolt a levegőbe. Megérezte azt a szagot, amit bármikor megismert volna, még úgy is, hogy hónapok óta nem volt az illető közelében. A szagot követve visszaindult a földszint felé. A nappaliba ért végül, de a nyom a házból kifelé vezetett. Már indult volna, követni a szagot, de megpillantotta barátnőjét, aki egy papírral a kezében szaladt felé a konyhából. Stitch felkapcsolta a villanyt. Ugyan nem volt szüksége a fényre, tökéletesen látott sötétben is, de ez már egyfajta megszokássá alakult. Angel odaállt mellé és a lapot úgy tartotta, hogy mindketten el tudják olvasni, amit ráírtak. Lilo búcsúlevele az ohananak! Nani, Jumba, Pleakley, mindegyik kísérlet! Fáj megírnom ezeket a sorokat, de szóban nem mondhatom el mindazt, amit ez a levél tartalmaz. Nani! Gondolom emlékszel arra a napra, amikor anya és apa meghalt. Aznap szétesett a családunk. Olyan sok konfliktus volt közöttünk, és majdnem elszakítottak minket egymástól, leginkább az én hibámból. De a lényeg az, hogy tudod, hogy milyen voltam. Nos mindez megváltozott, mikor először találkoztam Stitch-csel. Ugyan nem indult nagyon jól a kapcsolatunk, de végül mi lettünk a legjobb barátok. Stitch! Levelem nagyrészt neked szól. Remélem, hogy valaki eljuttatja hozzád is, hiszen nem hinném, hogy pont te találnád meg. Emlékszem a legtöbb közös pillanatunkra. Ahogy megtaláltuk a helyet Jumba összes kísérletének. Emlékszem, amikor kiderült, hogy valami hiba van a programodban, ami miatt néha visszatért a rossz éned. Emlékszem, hogy csak a csoda mentett meg téged. Emlékszem, amikor elmentél, hogy a NPCS 9000 kapitánya legyél, de a Leroy sereg megtámadta a földön élő kísérleteket, viszont a te segítségeddel sikerült legyőzni őket. Emlékszem arra a napra, amikor először találkoztál Angellel. Először féltékeny voltam, hiszen láttam, mennyire beleszerettél. Őszintén bevallom, kicsit örültem, hogy Gantu akkor magával vitte, de amikor láttam, mennyire letört voltál, rádöbbentem, hogy egy önző szörnyeteg vagyok. Megígértem tehát, hogy kiszabadítjuk, és amint lett rá alkalmunk, sikerült. Annyira örültem, hogy végre megtaláltad a szerelmet. És azért pedig külön hálás voltam, hogy amellett rám is jutott az idődből. Viszont aznap, amikor nem jöttél el a megbeszélt időben a tengerpartra, kicsit csalódtam benned. Végül, mikor hazajöttél és bocsánatot kértél, úgy döntöttem, hogy végtére is Angel a barátnőd, és te döntöd el, kire mennyi időt szánsz. Emlékszem, hogy többször is megnyugtattalak, nem haragszom, amiért olyan sokat vagy Angellel. Még most sem haragszom. Viszont aznaptól, hogy elköltöztél és nem láttalak többé, olyan ürességet hagyott bennem, hogy az túlszárnyalta a szüleim halála utáni űrt. Nani alig volt otthon, Jumba a hajóján volt, Pleakley meg nem is tudom merre kószált el sokszer. Tisztában voltam vele, hogy mindenki a maga életét éli, de mivel nekem nem voltak barátaim rajtad kívül, így újra egyedül maradtam. Emlékszem, hogy egyik nap Jumba odajött hozzám és beszélgettünk rólad, hogy mennyire hiányollak. Emlékszem, hogy felajánlotta, hogy készíthet egy új kísérletet, amit arra programoz, hogy legyen az én barátom és hasonlítson rád. Elutasítottam. Nekem te kellettél, nem egy másolat. De te már nem vagy itt nekem, hanem Angellel vagy. Tudom, hogy boldog vagy, ezért nem is akarlak arra kényszeríteni, hogy visszatérj hozzám. Csupán azért írtam le ezeket a sorokat, amiket remélem, valaki megmutat neked, hogy ne felejts el teljesen. Stitch! Köszönöm az együtt töltött boldog éveket! Nani! Köszönöm, hogy gondoskodtál rólam, még ha nem is voltam egy mintatestvér! Jumba! Köszönöm, hogy megalkottad Stitch-t és a többi kísérletet, főleg Angelt, hogy legyen Stitchnek valakije! Pleakley! Köszönöm, hogy amikor szükség volt rád, te ott voltál és kisegítettél! Én úgy érzem, hogy már nincs többé értelme az életemnek, ezért inkább elmegyek, hogy találkozzam a szüleimmel. Most már értitek, miért nem szóban búcsúzom. Elmentem a Magányos Fához. Viszlát és köszönök mindent még egyszer! Lilo Stitch szíve egy pillanatra megállt. Képtelen volt elhinni mindazt, amit olvasott. Tudta, hogy mit jelent ez. Lilo végezni akar magával. Nem akarta elhinni, hogy az a kedves lány, akit megismert, ilyenre vetemedne. De tudta, hogy nem csak viccből írta le. És azt is tudta, hogy azért csinálja ezt, mert elfelejtette őt. Mert elhagyta őt. Összetörte a szívét. Angel is tudta, mi történt. Már korábban is rájött, hogy hibázott, most viszont szembesült önző tettének szörnyű következményével. Azt kívánta bárcsak sosem találkozott volna Stitch-csel. Bárcsak ne szerettek volna egymásba. Bárcsak ne vette volna el Lilotól Stitcht. - Lilo… - hallotta Stitch hangját. Látta, ahogy a szeméből egy könnycsepp indul el, majd az arcán végigcsúszva végül lecsöppen a padlóra. Nem akarta ilyennek látni. Csak egy rosszabb dolog volt ennél a számára, mégpedig a tudat, hogy őmiatta megölte magát az a lány, aki szintén nagyon fontos volt Stitchnek. Oda akart menni hozzá, hogy egy csókkal megnyugtassa, de érezte, hogy ez nem a megfelelő alkalom. Neki most Lilo kellett. Hirtelen eszébe jutott, hogy Lilo talán csak nemrég írta levelet és még meg lehet állítani, mielőtt még túl késő lenne. - Boojiboo! Lilo talán él! Gyorsan menjünk megkeres! – próbálta lelkesíteni és örült neki, hogy sikerrel járt. Angel szavainak hatására Stitch visszazökkent abból a sokkból, amit a levél okozott neki. Feltámadt benne a remény, hogy a lány még életben van és ha elég gyorsak, akkor még megakadályozhatják ezt a tragédiát. Stitch tudta hol van a Magányos fa. Lilo egyszer megmutatta neki és mesélt neki egy történetet, amit ő talált ki. Nem is vesztegette tovább az idejét, kirohant a házból és az erdő felé vette az irányt. Futott amilyen gyorsan csak tudott, Angel pedig követte. Volt egyszer egy fa, aki egy nagyon szép dombon élt. Nagyon sok fatársa volt és mindannyian boldogok voltak, hogy nincsenek egyedül. Egy nap aztán egy villám csapott be, lángra lobbantva az erdőt. Rengeteg fa elégett és elpusztult. Mikorra végre véget ért a tűz, a dombon csak egyetlen egy fa maradt. Az, amelyik egy meredek szakadék szélén volt. Szerencséje volt, hogy nem volt másik fa, nagyon közel hozzá, így a tűz nem érte el. Viszont így egyedül maradt. Azóta sincs egy barátja, ő pedig nagyon magányos és szomorú. Lilo befejezte a halk szavalást. Nagyon bugyuta mese volt, hiszen nagyon kicsit volt, mikor kitalálta. Most viszont teljesen átérezte a fa helyzetét. Rengetegszer járt itt, a szülei halála után, valamiért mindig megnyugvást hozott számára ez a fa. Most is ezért van itt. A válláról levette a kötelet, hogy ellenőrizze még egyszer, hogy jól csinált-e mindent. Számítógépen megnézte, hogyan kell hurkot csinálni a kötélre akasztáshoz. Néhány napig bajlódott vele, de végül sikerült. Felmászott a fára. Azt az ágat szemelte ki magának, amelyik viszonylag vastag volt és a szakadékba nézett. Lent rengeteg szikla volt, amit néha-néha megmosott a vízhullám. Választhatta volna a leugrást is, de számára az túl sokáig tartott. Ő azonnali halált akart, viszont gyáva volt ahhoz, hogy késsel, vagy más fegyverrel vessen véget az életének. Megpróbálta, de karja képtelen volt engedelmeskedni. A kötelet hozzákötötte az ághoz, a hurkot pedig a fején keresztül a nyakához juttatta, majd szorított rajta, amíg teljesen a bőréhez nem simult. Szemét becsukta. Vett egy mély levegőt, majd felkészült arra, hogy leugorjon. - LILO! – hallott egy kiáltást. A hangot már hónapok óta nem hallotta, de mégis megismerte. – LILO! – hallotta újra. Nem akarta elhinni. Hallotta, ahogy nem olyan messze tőle előjön Stitch, majd mikor megpillantja megáll. - LILO! Naga! Állj! – kiabálja, majd elindul feléje. – Sajnálom! Lilo… Ne tedd… Kérlek… - mondta már sokkal halkabban. És Lilo hallgatott rá. Stitch volt az, aki utána rohant. Ez csak azt jelenthette, hogy őt kereste és megtalálta a levelet. Egy részről örült, hogy mégiscsak gondol rá, de képtelen volt hozzászólni. Annyira magányos volt, annyira szomorú és annyira hiányzott neki Stitch, hogy képtelen volt folytatni az életét. Most pedig itt van és azt próbálja megakadályozni, hogy valami ostobaságot műveljen. Legszívesebben elkezdett volna magyarázkodni és bocsánatot kérni, de gombóc volt a torkában. Stitch lassan közeledett felé. Lilo eközben megpróbálta levenni a nyakáról a hurkot, de nem tudta. Megpróbálkozott azzal, hogy kibogozza a csomót, amivel az ághoz rögzítette a kötelet. Azonban az ág megreccsent és eltört. Lilo felsikoltott, miközben a szakadékba zuhant. - LILO! – utoljára Stitch hangját hallotta, azután pedig minden elsötétült előtte. Mikor felébredt egy ismerős helyen volt. Abban a toronyszobában feküdt, amit Jumba épített. Ez volt Stitch-csel a közös szobájuk, de egy ideje már csak az övé. Azon gondolkozott, hogy vajon meghalt-e. Nem volt biztos benne, nem ilyennek képzelte el a halált. Ráadásul mindene fájt. A háta, a lábai, a karjai. Lassan felemelte a fejét és amit látott, az meggyőzte, hogy még él. Nani, Jumba Pleakley, Stitch és Angel álltak a szobája közepén és őt nézték. Megkönnyebbült sóhajtásokat hallott. Nani rohant oda hozzá először. - Oh Lilo... Végre felébredtél! – mondta, miközben megölelte. – Soha ne csinálj ilyet! Mégis mit képzeltél? – jogosan volt rá mérges a nővére, Lilo mégsem tudott válaszolni. Túlságosan is kínos volt neki elmondani, miért akart öngyilkos lenni. - Jumba örül, hogy Kicsi Lány rendben van! – hallotta Jumba hangját is. A nagydarab űrlény rámosolygott. - Lilo! Hogy tehetsz ilyet?! Hát gondolhatnál másokra is néha! – szólalt meg Pleakley is a maga fura hangján. Egyeszem szeme aggódást tükrözött, nem pedig haragot. Tudta, hogy csak azért mondta ezeket, mert féltette. Ami a legjobban fájt Lilonak az Stitch némasága volt. Nem szólt hozzá egy szót sem csak bámulta Angellel együtt. Látta, ahogy fogták egymás kezét, ez szintén rosszul esett neki, de úgy döntött, hogy nem fogja érdekelni. Nem fogja többször megpróbálni megölni magát, nem fog többet szomorkodni, inkább megpróbál továbblépni és élni az életét Stitch nélkül. - Lilo… - törte meg a csendet a nővére. – késő van és biztosan fáradt vagy! Hagyunk pihenni, de erről még beszélünk később! Jumba! Majd megtennéd, hogy holnap megvizsgálod Lilot, nincs-e valami sérülése? - Természetesen! Jumba holnap megnézi Kicsi Lány állapotát! – monda Jumba, majd a két kísérlet kivételével elhagyták a szobát. Lilo figyelte, ahogy eltűnnek és csak hárman maradtak a helyiségben. Lilo a fejét visszahelyezte a fejét a párnára. Nem bírta tovább nézni őket. Nem az volt a baj, hogy együtt látta Stitcht és Angelt, hanem az, hogy azok után kellett a szemükbe nézni, hogy megmentették az öngyilkosságtól. - Hogyan? – kérdezte végül, mert eszébe jutott, hogy lezuhant a szakadékba, Stitch viszont messze volt tőle, nem menthette meg. Angel odasétált hozzá, majd felült az ágyára. - Angel látta Lilo mire készül. Angel futott szakadékba. Ha Lilo leesne, Angel elkapja. Lilo zuhan, de Angel megfogta. – kapta meg a választ. Hálás volt, hogy a rózsaszín lény megmentette. Amikor meglátta Stitcht, azonnal meggondolta magát és rájött, hogy ez nem megoldás, emellett a halálfélelme is visszatért. - Köszönöm! - Angel sajnálja! Angel vette el Lilotól Stitcht! Angel miatt történt mindez! – vallotta be. – Ha Angel nem lett volna féltékeny, nem kéri meg Stitcht, hogy folyton vele legyen, Lilo nem lett volna magányos, nem akarta volna megölni magát! Lilo nem haragudott rá. Nem örült neki, hogy így alakult a helyzet, de nem tudott haragudni rá. Akár ő is megtehette volna, sőt gondolkozott is ilyenen, de végül nem vitte rá a lélek. - Nem haragszom. – adta tudtára Angelnek. Stitch nem szólalt meg, mióta felébredt. Még mindig csak ott állt és Lilot bámulta. Ő is magát hibáztatta a történtekért. Lehet, hogy az ő boojibooja volt az, aki megkérte, hagyja el Lilot, de mondhatott volna neki nemet néha. Elmehetett volna meglátogatni Lilot néha. De nem tette. És ezt tartotta élete legnagyobb hibájának. Szeretett volna valamit mondani, de nem tudott. Még nem. Szeretett volna egy kicsit kettesben lenni a lánnyal. Angel látta ezt rajta. - Angel megy. Angel látja, nektek kell egy kis együttlét. – ezzel leugrott az ágyról, és kiment magára hagyva Lilot és Stitcht. A kis két lény csak most vette rá magát, hogy közelebb menjen. - Lilo… Stitch sajnálja… Stitch elfeledte Lilot… Pedig az ohana… - eddig tudta mondani, mert Lilo ebben a pillanatban kiugrott az ágyából és megölelte őt. A lánynak már annyira hiányzott a közelsége, a puha szőrének érintése, hogy nem bírta tovább. Stitch viszonozta az ölelést. Percek teltek el, mire szétváltak. Mindkettőjük szeme tele volt könnyekkel. Végre meg tudtak szólalni. - Ó Stitch! Ne haragudj! Mit is képzeltem! Akkor egy balfék vagyok! – tört ki Liloból. - Naga! Stitch balfék! Stitch elfeledte Lilot. Stitchnek nem lett volna szabad ezt tennie! Stitch szakítani fog boojibooval és csak Liloval lesz ezután! Az utolsó mondat nagyon meglepte a lányt. Tudta, hogy csak kényszerből teszi, de ő nem akarta, hogy emiatt hagyja el Angelt. Arról viszont nem tudtak, hogy mindezt Angel is hallotta. Vissza akart menni hozzájuk, hogy ő megpróbálja valahogy kiengesztelni Lilot és nagyon fájt neki, amit Stitch mondott. Azonban nem fordult meg és rohant el, nem kiabált, hogy ne merészelje. Megérdemelt büntetésnek fogta fel. Fejét lehajtva indult volna haza, de meghallotta Lilo hangját újra. - Ne! Tudom, hogy szereted és nem akarom, hogy miattam szakíts vele! Menj csak nyugodtan, én pedig most megpróbálok továbblépni! – Angel szemébe könnyek szöktek. Lilo még azután is azt akarja, hogy együtt legyenek, hogy elvette tőle Stitcht. Valamit ki kellett találnia. És ki is talált. Azonnal elindult felfelé a szobába. - Angelnek van ötlete! – kiáltotta, amint felért. – Angel ötlete, hogy legyünk együtt hárman! Akkor mindenki boldog lehet! – Senki sem tiltakozott. Néhány nappal később már minden úgy ment mint régen, vagyis majdnem minden. Nem volt több gond abból, hogy éppen kivel volt Stitch. Angel, Lilo és a kék lény hármasban csináltak mindent. Angel még oda is költözött Liloékhoz, így a szobán már hárman osztoztak, de nem bánták. Boldogok voltak. Lilo és Angel között majdnem olyan mély baráti kapcsolat alakult ki idővel, mint Lilo és Stitch között. Egy sziklán ültek a tengerparton. A levelek és ágak zörgésén és a hullámok becsapódásán kívül minden csendes volt. A nap már elérte a horizontot és narancssárgára festette az égbolt egy részét. - Bárcsak hamarabb jutott volna eszünkbe ez! – szólalt meg Lilo. A két kísérlet bólintott. A kimerítő, egész napos játékban elfáradtak. Nagyon jól érezték magukat és azt kívánták, hogy bárcsak minden nap ilyen lenne. Végig nézték, ahogy a nap eltűnik az égboltról és sötétség borul a szigetre. Csak ekkor indultak el hazafelé. Nem siettek, hiszen ráértek és minél tovább akarták élvezni egymás társaságát. Amikor hazaértek egyből a szobába mentek fel. Fáradtak voltak és aludni akartak. Ahogy felértek, mindenki azonnal ágyba bújt. A mai nap együtt aludtak Lilo ágyán. Középen feküdt Stitch, akit közrefogott a két legkedvesebb nőnemű ismerőse. Így aludták az igazak álmát, várva, hogy az új nap még több örömet hozzon. ","Summary":" Sziasztok!

Within the bridge of the spacecraft, a solitary figure sat in one of the two padded seats positioned in front of the ship's illuminated control unit. Wordlessly, the figure pressed a series of buttons on the console, resulting in a holographic image of the planet Earth to appear above a monitor screen. \"So, Karanga,\" the armored figure mused, speaking to nobody in particular, in a voice that was made distorted by the grated mouthpiece built into the armored helmet. \"This is where you have chosen to hide. Did you think that I wouldn't follow you onto this planet? Or that coming here would give you the advantage? I thought you knew me better than that.\" As the mysterious pilot went to work in setting up a trajectory towards Earth, the door to the bridge slid open, allowing a dome-shaped hover robot to enter the room. \"Master Comet,\" the robot began. \"At your command, I searched the roster and identified all noted aliens who are registered on this planet.\" \"Thank you, Gigavolt,\" the pilot replied, not even bothering to look away from his task. \"Proceed with the identification. What did you find?\" \"There are technically only three registered alien lifeforms living here, all on a volcanic island called Kauai.\" \"Technically?\" Comet repeated, finally looking away from the computer monitor to glance at the small robot. \"What does that mean? Clarify that statement.\" \"Numerous genetic experiments can also be found there, but I didn't see applicable reason to label them as actual aliens. Generally speaking, they are merely creations, like me.\" \"Genetic… experimentation,\" Comet echoed, speaking slowly. \"Gigavolt, these registered aliens; would one be known as Jookiba?\" \"Indeed, if you are referring to the disgraced scientist from Quelte Quan who…\" \"Yes, yes, yes,\" Comet replied, waving a gloved hand impatiently. \"We all know what he did. So, who else is there?\" \"An Earthophile Plorgonarian. And your old friend, the former Captain.\" \"Are you talking about Guppy Gill?\" Comet demanded, suddenly sounding affronted. \"He is not my friend. He never has been.\" \"I know,\" Gigavolt beeped, a distinct note of amusement in the robotic voice. For a moment, Comet seemed to regard the robot in silence. Then, he let out a low chuckle. \"Gigavolt, I do believe you're finally starting to develop a sense of humor. I admit, I'm pleasantly surprised. But there will be time for levity later. I'd like you to go and perform a final diagnostic on the Star Dragon's arsenal. I'd prefer everything be in peak condition when we land.\" \"As you command, Master Comet,\" Gigavolt replied, obediently gliding away. Once he was alone again, Comet looked out of the ship's viewport, where Earth was just coming into view. \"Jookiba,\" Comet muttered. \"Now that's a name I never thought I'd ever hear again. I believe things just got more interesting.\" ","Summary":" A few kilometers away from the surface of the moon, a sleek, streamlined spacecraft appeared almost"},{"Movie":"Lilo & Stitch","Title":"Life's Avatar","Author":"dragonwriter24cmf","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12511551","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Life's Avatar Summary: How DID Lilo bring Stitch back? Jumbaa might not know and Lilo might not care, but someone does. The world is not what it used to be. People have moved on. They have turned away from the old ways, turned to other things. Technology. New dreams. Not that she is a forgotten goddess. Far from that. Her people still sing her songs, dance at her feasts, remember her in their festivals. Offerings are still made, songs still sung. They are not as plentiful as the songs or worship to her sister-goddess, Pele. But then, she does not govern the smoking mountains and their explosions. She is not known for her vengeful wrath or her violence. Her name is that which symbolizes love and compassion and miracles. Her name is symbolic of life. Still, when a child claims her name and her story, the novelty is enough to earn her attention and her interest. The child is young. But there is is that in her spirit which makes her a pleasing representative, a grace and a compassion that might one day flower into something impressive. And this child, like herself long ago, has an unlikely suitor, in the blue-hued being who follows her, counsels her and comforts her. Who helps her. Lilo, the child is called. A good name. Stitch, she calls her companion. An odd name, but then he is an odd being, unique among all the creatures and peoples of the islands. And yet, there is in him a light and a gentleness of spirit that is most intriguing and pleasing, in spite of his strange form. He is a suitable companion for this child who has claimed her story. Suitable in more ways than one, for like Her Consort of legend, he is in grave danger. The fire that scorches him burns from within, rather than without, but is no less dangerous for all of that. In fact, one might argue that the peril is even greater, for this is not a fire that can be escaped, as Pele's mountain fires might be. It is fitting, that this child who would be her avatar shall face the test she herself faced, eons ago when the islands were young. She wonders if Lilo will pass this trial by fire, and what she might do. The moment of truth comes. When Stitch's condition becomes grave, when Lilo's dreams intersect with her companion's fall. She is pleased, when her young avatar sacrifices the dream of her young heart to seek her companion, who is wounded and frightened and dying alone. That is as it should be. That is what it means, to be Her avatar. The willingness to face trouble, toil and grief for Love. She watches as the child Lilo races to her beloved companion's side, aided by her champions, as She was once aided by her fellow gods and the island peoples. This too, is as it should be. Like Her, the child comes too late to her companion's side. Her consort falls and fades, his final spark of life flickering out, even as the child holds him close. Even as their family gathers round. She watches Lilo take Stitch's body in her arms. The blessing of the flower. Tears, as bitter as the ones She once shed over her fallen Beloved. Words of family. Words of Love, everlasting and deep and true, in the face of all that may be. It is good. Her child, Her Avatar, has proven herself worthy. Worthy of Her Name, worthy of Her blessing. Worthy of a miracle, as was once bestowed upon another Beloved Consort. She bends near, bends close to Her Avatar, and breathes upon the fallen form. And with Her breath, comes life. A spark, which under Her will and Her blessing, becomes a blaze. She breathes until the tiny figure can hold no more light, no more strength. And then she steps back, still unseen, as Lilo holds her dear companion close, as the family crowds around with cries of joy. She hears the question asked by the skinny, nervous one, and the quiet answer of the large one, and she smiles. For her Avatar, many things are possible. And Lilo is hers, from now until the end of time. Author's Note: I love Lilo and Stitch, both movies. And I always thought that it was just so...convenient, that Lilo's dance and their situation would mirror each other so closely...and my brain would just NOT let go of this.

She was scared for a lot of it. She was alone for a lot more of it. She missed her parents. She missed her annoying brothers and cousins and classmates. She missed having her parents act as parents, rather than Morgan take care of everything herself. Except there were times when she stopped. She'd had enough of being scared. Of being alone. Of being unsure. Lucky the universe had given her a way out. It wasn't an easy thing, having superpowers. Morgan thought she was doing a good job. Her powers allowed her to jump around the multiverse. The worlds you saw on TV were a playground to Morgan. She could stay there for years and years, with barely a blink of time passing back Home. Morgan Spencer decided to go to the one world she had always known she'd be welcome in. She had to go to the world where the main character was introduced in commercials by appearing in other movies. That was her whole life! It would take some time to get ready. Despite her actual age, she had the mindset of a ten-year-old. Ten year olds were impatient little things. ==M&J;== She woke up in a body that was half the size of her original one. She saw a deep Hawaiian tan instead of her normal tan skin. Her hair was a thicker black that fell in short, bunched up waves down her back. She was wearing a water blue version of Lilo's signature bright red dress. She looked around where she had woken up. It was an old alleyway. Morgan saw a box nearby. The box was on its side, the top facing outward. There were other dresses like the one she was wearing inside, as well as a grass hula outfit (homemade), sneakers (she was new to this body, but even she knew those shoes were two sizes too big), and dolls made out of twisted metal spoons. A rolled up sleeping back was stuffed in the back of the box, keeping it upright. One of the flaps had a stick tied on, to keep it up at night Morgan assumed. Her backstory was that she apparently lived in this box. Morgan mentally shrugged. She'd lived in houses up until now. Being homeless would be a cool adventure! She crawled into her new home. The box smelled like mildew and rotten fruit. Morgan found some writing inside the box, written by an obviously young hand. ' Mahina's Box' The 's' was done backwards. The 'i' had no dot. As for the 'm', it was somehow done cursive. Morgan was impressed. She couldn't write like that at all by age six. Or whatever age this body was. The sun was going down. Morgan squinted over at the fading sun, seeing the colors that danced along the sky for sunset. The colors reminded her of a rainbow, except this rainbow covered the entirety of the sky itself, stretching on until the orange hues changed to yellow which changed to blue that became that purple of the night sky, with white stars scattered across them like a color all their own. She thought it was beautiful. Morgan moved herself to sitting against the side of the box. It could barely support the weight of her, so she moved to lean against the wall beside her. She watched the sky until the orange took away the red. She waited for the yellow to take the orange. For the blue to take the yellow. For the blue to become purple. Lastly, when the stars took over the purple. Morgan let out a content sigh at the sight. She climbed down the alleyway which led into a forest. She had a better view of the stars from their, but not perfect . There were always trees, when getting a better view. Morgan climbed up one, taking pains to remember she had the body of a small child. They were fast and agile, but also short . As she reached the top perch, she studied the stars. She looked for differences between this sky and the one from her Home. It looked like all the summer constellations were there, although three of the stars in Draco were dimmer. Morgan reminded herself aliens existed in this world. Aliens. For every star she could see, millions of aliens surrounded it as it was their sun. She wondered if maybe- just maybe- right now, a trial was being held for a little blue alien. She wondered if Stitch even existed yet. She wondered... She wondered for so long, her eyes had become droopy. Knowing how hard children could fall to sleep when it suited them, Morgan climbed down the tree. Morgan went back to the tiny little box that she reasoned was her home now. She couldn't say how she knew this place was home, that it had been for a while now, or that it had to stay her home for just awhile more. She had to wait. She wasn't sure if she was waiting for the movie to start, or waiting for Mahina's family. ==M&J;== It had been a week. That didn't sound like a long time, usually. When you were a child alone on the street, it felt like a month. Mahina had made a tiny little home for herself in that alleyway. Morgan could scarcely believe it. After some checking, her body was the age of five (at most, six). No five year old should have a box for a home. No child sure want this home, or feel saddened whenever she was too far away from it. Morgan did her best to ignore the impulse to stay in the alley, but even she had to give in when tired. As for food, Morgan had to get creative. She swore she'd pay Mrs Hasagawa for the fruit when she had the money. Morgan had taken from trash bins too, but she craved fresh fruit. Morgan supposed if needed she could scrounge up the island fruit, after checking that it wasn't deadly. Morgan looked at her ill gotten gains from the day. The various pieces of half eaten food, a small pile of peaches from Mrs Hasagawa, and a bag of chips she'd snagged from a woman's grocery bag. ' For now, I'll have to steal things.' She told herself. ' Yeah...yeah this isn't forever...' She looked up at the night sky. She'd always loved the night. Her new namesake was full in the sky, like a protector over her. ' As great as this box is...I'd like someone to find me now.' But they didn't. So she sat. Waiting... Waiting... Waiting... ==M&J;== AN: Here it is! I hinted at this story in my Doctor Who series. Now it's finally being done![Chapter 2] The hula class was starting. Mahina stood outside, watching the lesson begin. Deciding to follow the hula class had been one of sorta kinda deep thought. On one hand, it let Mahina watch the other kids her age. She had no supplies like a normal hula student would have, so that meant she needed to improvise. She took some tall leaves off of bushes, tying them together (using other leaves) until a skirt was fashioned. She was able to use an old t-shirt she'd found in the garbage. Her hula halo was actually the hardest bit, though Mahina liked to think she got away easy on that one. She made a daisy chain, but without the flowers. This long tale ends with Mahina standing beside a window to the hula class, watching the lesson taking place. Mahina stood in the first position of the dance. She followed the beat with a tap of her foot. The moves were easily to replicate. Some hand movements, which Mahina enjoyed doing. The feet movements were a bit tough to follow at first but Mahina caught. Mahina followed the movements of the other girls, being careful not to lag behind. She didn't have the advantage of a teacher watching for corrections. Everything she did wrong she had to self-correct. While dancing Mahina sang along her breath. She had no idea what the words really meant, nothing at all. She enjoyed it all the same- all the fun she was having. She enjoyed dancing. Mahina barely acknowledged Lilo's presence on stage. She giggled to herself. The dance was coming to a close. Mahina made sure to keep extra close eye on the last moves, not tripping on her feet or something on the ground. The music cut off. Mahina struck the final pose. \"He Inoa No Kalani Kalakaua. Kulele.\" Mahina recited. As soon as she did, there as screaming coming from the dance hall. Mahina winced. She stood up on her tiptoes, pushing open the window. It creaked- the old wood not agreeing with the 'quiet' plan. Mahina grabbed the wooden barriers of the window to halt it. Thankful the screaming hula dancers covered the sound of the creaking window. \"Stop. Stop.\" The instructor assured. His students froze, stopping their high pitched screams. Well, all except Lilo, who had neither fallen nor screamed. \"Lilo, why are you all wet?\" \"It's sandwich day.\" Lilo stated plainly. Everyone gave her blank stares back. Lilo sighed deeply. \"Every Thursday, I take Pudge the Fish a peanut butter sandwich.\" She clarified. Mahina winced. \"Pudge is a fish?\" The instructor asked. \"And today we were out of peanut butter!\" Lilo went on. She was more distressed from the sandwich than being late for class. Which, given her reasoning, made sense. \"So I asked my sister what to give him and she said a tuna sandwich. I can't give Pudge tuna!\" Lilo leaned in towards the instructor. \"Do you know what tuna is?\" The instructor winced, already knowing he wouldn't like whatever it was that Lilo said it what would follow. Mahina knew what she would say, she barely liked it. \"Fish?\" \"It's fish !\" Lilo yelled. \"If I gave Pudge tuna , I'd be an abomination ! I'm late because I had to go to the store and get peanut butter 'cause all we have is-is stinkin' tuna!\" She ranted. Mahina had to give Lilo credit. That explanation did make sense. \"Lilo, Lilo.\" The instructor spoke up to calm the girl done. Lilo took a deep breath. She also fixed her hula hat. \"Why is this so important?\" \"Pudge controls the weather.\" Lilo answered. Everyone exchanged confused looks. Mahina shrugged, accepting the explanation. While Mahina understood that it wasn't what actually happened, she kept an open mind about what might be true in this world. \"You're crazy.\" Myrtle told Lilo. Mahina wished she had a camera- as she was missing the opportunity to capture the real life fight between Lilo and Myrtle. Meaning, Lilo punching Myrtle in the face or trying to bite her or scratch her. The other girls were less excited about this. They screamed loudly, running away from their seemingly insane hula classmate. The other adults in the room watched in the same way all adults would've: Not my problem but holy shit is that weird. Mahina was snickering now, leaning on the window to enjoy. \"Please! Please!\" The instructor tried to keep the peace. His efforts made Mahina snicker more. \" Everybody calm down !\" He lifted Lilo off of Myrtle. The instructor made sure to stand between the other girls and Lilo. Mahina stood up on her feet, watching it all go down. The instructor calmed down the girls, whispering to them. Even when Mahina strained to hear, it was all murmurs to her. \"Lilo...\" The instructor began. \"I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I won't do it again!\" Lilo pleaded. \"Maybe we should call your sister.\" The instructor sighed. \"No! I'll be good! I want to dance.\" Lilo begged. \"I practiced. I just want to dance. I practiced.\" Myrtle looked down at her arm. Mahina couldn't hear her, but she heard all the girls groan is disgust. ==M&J;== The girls all shouted as they ran from hula class. They had all changed into their normal clothes- Mahina too, mostly because her grass skirt was sorta kinda definitely in need of repair. She was wearing her favorite dress- one that looked a lot like Lilo's only dark blue. She'd nicked it from a store about two weeks after she arrived in Hawaii. Mahina peeked from around the building, watching the girls all run away. Except Lilo. She sat on the steps, alone. That warned Mahina that she was about to run up to Lilo's side and offer comfort. How did she know this? Because Mahina had a bleeding heart for the outcast. \"Hey Lilo.\" Mahina greeted, trying to wave hello. Lilo tilted her head. \"I haven't seen you here before...\" \"I haven't been around before.\" Mahina supplied. She sat down beside Lilo, looking out on the trees. \"I'm Mahina.\" Lilo raised an eyebrow. \"Hey...how'd you know my name?\" \"I heard the teacher telling you.\" Mahina answered. \"After you punched the other girl.\" Lilo sighed, looking down at her feet. \"It was awesome.\" Lilo smiled. Mahina moved to sit beside Lilo, when the teacher walked out. She ducked to hide around the building. She had never really liked adults. Even if she was one...kinda. ==M&J;== Mahina was walking downtown. Well not downtown-downtown, Kaua'i was too small too have a proper downtown. It was more like...a few roads with a lot of extra shops. Mahina knew the island had a resort, which had a lot more stores and things by it, however the local shops were more...quaint. Sometimes she'd swing by the resort- if she knew she could make it back to her box-house before sunset- to take what stuff she could. It was never much, but Mahina was getting better at this whole 'thieving' stuff. She'd get the 'much' as her skill improved. Yeah. Mahina decided. She was gonna be a thief when she grew up. She'd been a lawyer, a cop, an FBI agent, thief was the next logical step. Anyway. That's a big tangent. Back to what Mahina was actually doing downtown. She'd stopped stealing the fruit from Mrs Hasagawa. The guilt had been getting to her. When Mahina eventually became a professional thief, things like 'guilt' wouldn't hold her down anymore. But anyway, without stealing the fruit, she needed food . Lucky for her, someone had thrown out a computer. Mahina had some experience with computer analysis, so a couple of days connected to the local power grid had the computer running like normal. Mahina had been able to make a bogus credit card. The funds generated would be completely fake- just lines of code that led to nowhere. Not that the card readers were know. Think of it like monopoly money that actually worked in the real world because nobody knew what fake money was. It was so much work . Mahina knew, that when she achieved her dream of being the next big thief (or some kind of ninja thief, that'd be so cool) she'd do less work than that. Three days it took to make a fake credit card. Three . Ugh. Exhausting. She was walking in a grocery store. Mahina was actually proud of herself for doing it so naturally. She used a basket to pack all the food she wanted- and some plastic spoons. Mahina even grabbed some vegetables- even if they were gross. That was just her child brain talking. Mahina was fully aware vegetables were important. That didn't mean vegetables weren't gross. (Well except Veggietales. Those guys were great) Mahina heaved her basket to check-out. She dropped the basket on the counter. After, she put down the credit card she'd made. It looked a lot like the real deal- a stolen hotel key, lots of paint, and some good old elbow grease had it looking perfect. The cashier stared in confusion. Mahina stood up on her tiptoes, peeking over the counter. \"I would like to buy food please.\" She stated. The chaser gawked now. Mahina pushed the basket- which was heavy . As though deciding she must be hallucinating, the cashier began ringing up the food. Mahina beamed. Two minutes later, she was walking away with the bags of food. They were heavy, but lighter than the basket. It would take Mahina awhile to get home but meh. Needs must. She didn't make it far away from the grocery store when she walked by Cobra Bubbles. Talk about being starstruck. Mahina stared. Bubbles raised an eyebrow above his sunglasses. Mahina stared back. She reminded herself to keep it cool. If you hadn't done anything wrong, there was no reason to be suspicious. (Which was a lie. Mahina has done a lot wrong. But if she believed it, Bubbles would too...she hoped.) \"That looks heavy.\" He remarked. Mahina shrugged. She had an idea in the works to fix that. She would need tiny wheels- which were hard to find in the trash. Also a plan. Honestly just finding a wagon would be easier...but Mahina apparently liked making her life difficult. \"I can handle it.\" Mahina decides to say, when she realized she'd been quiet a while. \"How old are you?\" Bubbles asked. Mahina paused to remember. \"Six.\" The eyebrow stayed. \"I'm big.\" Mahina told Bubbles. \"What's your name, little girl?\" Bubbles asked. She narrowed her eyes. \"I'm not supposed to talk to strangers. And this stuff is heavy.\" Bubbles pulled out his ID badge. Mahina glanced at it. \"Cobra is a weird name.\" Bubbles tucked the badge away. \"Where are your parents?\" \"Mommy's at work, and Daddy's taking a nap.\" Mahina supplied. Bubbles continued to stare beneath the sunglasses. Mahina swore to one day to be that badass. \"And they sent you for groceries?\" \"No. Daddy's chores are for Daddy but he was sleeping so long I knew he wouldn't get it done in time.\" The lie came together so fast in Mahina's mind, she gave herself a self-five. Bubbles lowered his eyebrow. \"Who are you?\" \"Mahina.\" She answered. At his questioning eyebrow, Mahina shrugged. \"I don't know my other name.\" She admitted. Because she well and truly had no idea what Mahina's last name was. \"I'm going home.\" Bubbles let out a sigh. \"Look, Mahi-\" Mahina ran off. \"Hey!\" She ran around some alleyways, ducking behind things to keep out of Bubbles' sight. Somehow, she managed to do exactly that. ==M&J;== Later that night, Mahina was finishing up a can of corn. She had cooked it. She only looked six, she wasn't actually six. She was twenty-six. She could cook her food. With it done, Mahina tossed the can away in a nearby garbage bin. Mahina let out a sigh as she climbed back in her box. She had set it up to prepare for the upcoming rain, using a thrown out tent to lead the water away from her 'home'. She peeked out from the box, looking up at the sky. The stars were still shining bright. Mahina could make out the dark spots as clouds. In the distance, thunder. Mahina silently wished Stitch the best of luck. A green flash lit up the sky. Mahina tucked myself under her blanket, looking up at the green star that was falling. A gentle smile came to her face. ==M&J;== AN: Well here we go!

He looks like a dog, but he's really an illegal genetic experiment from outer space! His experiment number is 626, which is what our channel is named after\". Stitch nodded vigorously as Lilo spoke. \"Today is just the intro to our life and our channel\" She continued. \"Ih, yogga get to meet ohana and learn about us!\" Stitch spoke at last. \"Alright, let's go!\" Lilo said excitedly, grabbing the camera. \"If you couldn't already tell, this is me and Stitch's room. This is where we create hulas, sleep, play games, and catalog all of Stitch's cousins! Or if you want a better explanation, all of the other experiments. Come on Stitch!\" she called again, Stitch running over to the elevator. \"Now, the only way in and out of our room is through the elevator. It's pressure sensitive, so when you step on it…\" Lilo explained, her and Stitch stepping on it. It hovered down to the main level. \"Ta da!\" Stitch exclaimed in front of the camera, a bright smile on his face. \"This is our hallway. Upstairs is where my 'Aunt Pleakley' and 'Uncle Jumba' sleep\". The two walked up the stairs and ran into the half clean and half messy room. \"As per usual, the two are arguing\" She commented. \"I'm tired of having to do all of the cleaning around here! So you're going to put down the blow torch, stop whatever evil invention you're making, and help me pick up around here!\" Pleakley shouted, broom in hand. \"That green, walking noodle right there is Pleakley. I call him a her because his disguise is as a girl, but he's really a guy\" Lilo spoke. \"Ahh, Little Girl! 626\" a big, purple alien said, lifting his goggles, and revealing his four eyes. \"That right there is Jumba. He calls himself an evil genius, but he's really a big softie. He's Stitch's creator, and adopted father. The whole father thing is new\". The video shows Jumba rubbing Stitch's head. \"I see you are playing with new camera I invented\" he comments with his russian accent. \"...that you created , not invented…\" Pleakley mumbled while glaring at Jumba. \"Hey!\". Both Stitch and Lilo laughed. \"Ok, now moving on!\" Lilo perked up, grabbing Stitch's arm and pulling him out the door. \"Bye!\" Stitch called out. They walked down the stairs and hall, into the living room. \"This is the living room. See? Comfy!\" Lilo said as she plopped down on the couch. Stitch just bounced on it. \"Stitch! What have I told you about jumping on the furniture?!\" Someone shouted from the kitchen. Stitch grabbed the camera from Lilo and pointed it at a teenage female with tan skin and puffy hair. \"That isa Nani! Nani isa boring ika patooka\" he said. \"I am not!\" she argued. \"That's my older sister Nani. She's always working or out with David, leaving me all alone…\" Lilo stated dramatically. \"Lilo, you know why I have to work. And put that camera down!\" she ordered, walking back into the kitchen. \"Before any of you say anything, she is a big ika patooka\" Lilo whispers into the camera. \"Hey! I heard that!\" Nani shouted from the kitchen. At that moment, a few knocks were heard at the door. \"I'll get it!\" Lilo volunteers quickly, handing the camera to Stitch. He follows her to the door, which opens to reveal a tall man with shiny black hair and a chill face. \"Oh, hey Lilo\" he says calmly. \"Hi David! That's David, Nani's boyfriend\" she told the camera. \"Lilo! I told you to put the camera down!\" Nani yelled, walking over to the door. \"How'sit Nani?\" David asked. Lilo stuck her tongue out at her sister and began to walk away from the two. \"Ok, so now you've met some of our Ohana! Now let's talk about the channel\" Lilo began to say. At that moment, Jumba and Pleakley walk down the stairs, still arguing. \"Is not Jumba's fault if one-eyed noodle wants to clean\" Jumba said. \"But first, let's get some privacy!\" she announced. With a snap, the video teleported them back into their room. \"Ok, so this channel is going to be about us and our Ohana\" she started. \"Ih! There isa ch..chall..eng..es anda...pranks, and a coffee!\" Stitch piped up, arms open with excitement. \"No coffee\" Lilo correct. \"Awwe\" he whined. \"But, there will be vlogs, challenges, and of course, PRANKSS!\" She shouted, Stitch whooping in the background. \"So, I know this video isn't very long, but I hope you enjoyed it! Click on that like button if you want more of me and my Ohana, and be sure to subscribe, as it'll make us feel better. Comment down below if there's any challenges or videos you want us to do\" She said excitedly. \"You want to end it Stitch?\". \"Ih, Ih, Ih!\" He exclaimed, hopping up and down. \"Please subscribe! If yogga do, then yogga Ohana! Ohana means family, and family means nobody gets left behind!\" \"Or forgotten\" Lilo added. Stitch giggled. \"Come back for more please! Aloha Ohana!\" He ended.[Chapter 2] The screen turns on and you can see Stitch looking in the camera. \"Isa on?\" he whispered. \"Okeytaka! Isa me! Stitch! So, Lilo isa being ika patooka lately. Shega been playing with other ika patookas. Look\" he said. The camera peered around a tree to see Lilo playing dolls with a few other girls. One of them with red hair was pouting a few feet away, a sad look of hurt on her face. Stitch turns the camera back onto himself. \"So, Stitch going to scare Lilo with this mask meega make!\" He whispered evilly, pulling out what looked like a ghoul mask covered in slime and leafs. Stitch covered his mouth in attempt to conceal his laughter, but the camera picked it up anyways. \"This isa gonna be fun!\". The camera cuts to a point of view higher than the girls, a few leafs and twigs sticking up, hinting the camera was in a tree. You could see Stitch creep around a wooden building and almost get caught by the redhead. She does see him, but he shushes her and holds up the mask, pointing to the group behind her. Her eyes grew a little evil and she walked over to them. Stitch face palmed until he heard what the girl was saying. \"Well, I'm going to get out of here before I start to become weird like Weird-lo here! Or before….\" she leans in close, covering one side of her mouth \"...the Bush Crawler gets me!\". Lilo looked on weird and Stitch silently fisted the air, continuing around the building until he was out of the camera's view. \"The Bush Crawler?\" Lilo asked. Another girl with two blond pigtails asked \"What's that?\". \"Wait, you've never heard of the Bush Crawler before? Ha! I should've guessed you losers wouldn't know! It's a legendary animal, said to kidnap children left unsupervised!\" the redhead spoke ominously, waving her hands around in a slow manner. \"Come on Myrtle! There's no such thing as a Bush Crawler\" another girl with curly brown hair pulled back in a purple headband. \"Yeah, you're starting to sound weird\" the final girl spoke up, with short, flat brown hair. \"Whatever! Just remember the day you didn't heed my warnings. It'll come for you! It always does! Hahahaha!\" the girl Myrtle laughed as she walked away. The other three girls looked unsure, but Lilo spoke up to reassure them. \"Come on guys, she's just trying to scare us\". But before any of them could react, a nearby bush began to shake. The four girls stood up and huddled close to each other, Lilo being pushed in front of them as protection. \"It's the Bush Crawler! It's come for us!\" One of the girls screamed. The suspense grew as the bush shook harder and louder, until….a bunny rabbit hopped out. The girls relaxed. \"See? What'd I tell you? It was just Myrtle trying to scare us\" Lilo spoke up, taking a few breaths of her own. But then out of nowhere, Stitch jumped out from the shadows behind the girls, roaring. All the girls screamed. \"It's the Bush Crawler!\" one of them cried. \"Ahhhh!\" another screamed. One of the girls fainted. After the initial scare, Stitch fell on his back laughing, Myrtle coming out from behind a tree laughing too. Lilo saw the blue fur and called out. \"S..Stitch?\". Still dying of laughter, he pulled up his mask and high-fived Myrtle. \"Stitch!\" Lilo shouted, now angry. He laughed harder as Lilo stomped over to him, punching his arms and head. This didn't hurt him in the slightest, and he just continued laughing, and running away from his best friend. The other girls recovered, even the one who fainted and just looked on confused. \"Uhhh! Get back here you overgrown fur ball!\" Lilo shouted. Stitch jumped on the tree the camera was hiding at and pulled it out, revealing what he caught on camera. \"Yugga just got PRANKED!\" He shouted, pointing down at all of them. \"You were recording!?\" Both Lilo and Myrtle shouted at the same time. \"He can talk?\" the girl with short hair, and who also fainted piped up. Myrtle laughed even harder and Lilo glared daggers at both the camera and Stitch. Stitch, holding the camera, jumped down from the tree, pointing the camera in Lilo's face. \"That's what yugga get for being ika patooka to Stitch!\". Lilo shoved Stitch who laughed. She crossed her arms and pouted, much like Myrtle was before. Stitch just laughed and tackled Lilo an a backwards hug. She began laughing too. \"Stitch get off me!\" She yelled between laughs. The other girls began laughing too. The camera cut to a later scene, back at the house. The two had just walked back in the house. \"Okeytaka! Hope yugga liked prank! Was fun to do..for meega at least\" he chuckled. Lilo shoved him and spoke to the camera. \"Don't get too full of yourself fur ball! I'll get you back for this!\" She said with a lighthearted threat. \"Sure...Anyways, like and sub...subscribe! Comment below! #TeamCuteandFluffy , weega off to great start!\" \"But don't worry guys! Team Lilo will be coming back five times as strong!\". Lilo walked off as Stitch did the outro. \"Until Next time, please subscribe! If yugga do, then yugga Ohana! Ohana means family, and family means nobody gets left behind or forgotten! Please come back for more! Aloha Ohana!\" The camera shuts off.

It's the first day of school after summer vacation ends and people are rushing through the hallways of Catonsville High School, trying to find their first period classes. One of those people are Jeremiah Jankowski, a kid with brown hair, blue eyes, blue jeans, and a blue and white striped shirt. He was luckier than most new students, he found his way to class before the late bell rung. \"Well this is a nice class I have,\" He thinks sarcastically. \"I don't know anyone!\" \"Welcome to your first period class everyone!\" The teacher exclaimed. \"I'm Mr. Early! Because this is your first day, the school would like you to learn about your fellow classmates and make new friends!\" \"Let's see, what am I willing to tell others!\" Jeremiah thought to himself while walking around the class room. \"That I think I'm slightly insane? No. That my best friend Sully moved to Florida? No. That I'm a writer? Yeah that will actually work.\" \"Ok, that was enough time to talk about yourselves! Time to take your seats!\" Mr. Early called out, jolting Jeremiah from his thoughts. \"OK, That was not nearly enough time for us.\" Jeremiah thinks annoyed. He takes his seat at a table in the corner, while other people choose their seats. No one sits with him. \"YEAH, I'm a loner!\" He thinks sarcastically again. While the same rules and guidelines from every school are explained, Jeremiah doodles on a blank sheet of paper. He draws a character he made called Stitch and NO, This is not the Stitch from Lilo and Stitch, He just looks like him and is called Stitch. They're different entities entirely. Jeremiah looked at his drawling and smiles. The drawling smiles back at him and waves. \"Some how this doesn't surprise me.\" Jeremiah thought. Stitch puts up a finger to say \"Hold on.\" Then he walked off the piece of paper and seems to disappear. Then in Jeremiah's mind, he hears a door open and close. \"Hi, I'm Stitch.\" A voice in his mind said. \"Oh, well hi...\" Jeremiah answers back. \"If your in my mind, then do I have powers and what not?\" \"Yeah, You have powers of chaos, change, and me. Chaos meaning you can do anything if there is chaos,\" Stitch starts before Jeremiah asks him something. \"Wait, but isn't there always chaos?\" Jeremiah asks. \"Exactly. Anyways, Change means you can take or get powers of stuff like if you touched ice, you would get ice powers.\" Stitch explained. \"And you can turn into me whenever you want. Also you have my backpack and stuff.\" \"Huh. Not gonna to lie, I thought I would inherit powers or get them from a weird accident, but I like that nothing has really happened to me.\" Jeremiah thought in response to Stitch. Then it hit him. \"I'm in a fan fiction, aren't I.\" \"Yep.\" Stitch replied. \"Cool.\" Jeremiah thought. \"Your taking this surprisingly well.\" Stitch chuckled back. \"Eh, I just go with the flow of things.\" Jeremiah answered back. \"Anyway lets continue with the school day\" Once Jeremiah was back home, he biked to the parking lot of Saint Tim's Church. \"So, practice time?\" Jeremiah asked out loud. \"Practice time.\" Stitch answers back. \"Try chaos first.\" Jeremiah just looked at the blacktop and made some of the blacktop into water, then made the water turn in to a duck, that flew away shortly afterwards. Stitch clapped. \"Nice job! Now try change!\" Jeremiah made a flame appear in his hand. His striped shirt then turned orange and red and he shot a fire ball into the air. He then turned back to normal. \"Doing great!\" Stitch cheered. \"Now try becoming me!\" Jeremiah then just changed into Stitch. There was no weird morphing. No flash. No anything. He just became Stitch. Jeremiah then looked at himself. He was Stitch and had Stitch's backpack on. \"Fantastic ki-\" Stitch started before a fire truck drove past and went down Wallerson Rd. \"That may be worth checking out.\" Stitch suggests, but Jeremiah (Ok we're going to start replacing Jeremiah with JR to not waste anymore space. Ok?) was already running. As he turns the corner he sees his house in flames. Fire Fighters are trying to put out the flames to no success. JR hears them say \"6 dead\" and \"7 lived in the house\", As well as \"One missing\". JR just walks away and into a portal he makes. Still in Stitch form, he appears on top of a building and lays down, looking at the sky. \"Should have seen this coming.\" JR sighs. \"People with powers tend to lose their families.\" He lays there for an hour before dropping down to the side walk below and walking into the building, which happened to be a Starbucks. Basically everyone was giving him weird looks, probably because he was still Stitch. He order an Iced Carmal latte with whipped cream and tried to find an open seat. He ended up sitting in front of someone with a black hoodie with most of their face covered by shadows. JR takes out his phone to check where he is. Turns out, he's in Florida. \"Might as well see if I can find Sully. He opens Messenger and texts \"Hey Sully! Guess what! I'm in Florida right now!\" Sully texts back. \"How?\" \"This is going to be fun to explain.\" JR thought before texting back with \"When you find me, I will explain. I'm at a Starbucks on 433 Cleveland St.\" Then on the TV, the news came on. \"This just in, a fire burned down the house of Nick Jankowski. Six people were found dead, But there was no trace of the son, Jeremiah Jankowski anywhere. Also authorities found the O'donalds dead, but their son was also not found anywhe-\"JR pointed a remote at it and changed the channel. Sully just then texts \"I'm there and just found out you might be dead.\" \"Same here.\" JR texts back. Then he opens a portal and goes onto the roof of the building again. Then he texts to Sully \"If you can go onto the roof, I'm there.\" Sully replies with \"Ok then.\" Then the guy in a hoodie rises from a shadow in front of him, still his face is covered in shadows. He takes out two scythes. JR takes out a big blue Butcher's Knife. JR's just wondering two things. \"First, Who is this guy? Second, Why does this son of a bitch have my friends phone?\"[Chapter 2] Chapter 2 : Oh boy a fight scene! The roof then erupted with fire, but I was already laying on a energy platform I made. The guy looked around confused, probably doesn't know where I am. \"So how's it going, friend?\" I chuckle. He looks up at me, his stance changed to prepare for an attack. \"Your no fun.\" I sigh. His head tilts as if he is confused about why I said that. \"You don't talk. Nothing said to be laughed at\" I explain. He just shrugs. \"Well if you won't talk on your own...\" Then I take out a weapon he would never expect. \"I'LL MAKE YOU!\" I growl before smacking him with a ladder. The hooded man gets launched into the next building. \"I bet with this ladder, I'll climb to succses!\" I joke. \"Good hit and good joke!\" Stitch chuckles in my mind. Then from the building a fire ball gets launched at him. I just turn the ladder into a base ball bat and send it back. \"Batter, batter, SWING!\" I chuckle. I hear Stitch laughing in my mind. Then the guy reappears with two shotguns in his hands. \"Your alot like Reaper from overwatch, minus the fire.\" I remark. He nods his head. \"You even almost look like him, But...\" Then I pull out Reaper's shotguns and because of my change powers, I now look like a mini Reaper with a Stitch head and ears. \"I look better.\" Then shot him in the cheast while he was amazed. He goes sprawling on the ground, shotguns out of his hands and me standing on his cheast. \"Death comes to you!\" I say mocking Reaper. I throw the guns at his wrists, so they're stuck in between the barral and the grip. He now can't move his hands. \"Now,...\" I began taking out my butcher's knife. \"Lets see the man under the hood.\" I push it back with my knife and see a very farmiliar face. \"SULLY, ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME!!\" I yell at him. \"Take down the hood sometimes, I couldn't reconise you!!\" \"Wait, so your...\" Sully started before I changed back into my human form. \"Sorry Sully.\" I say while scratching the back ofr my head sheepishly. \"You have alot of explaining to do.\" Sully growled. \"I know.\" I sigh.

The same scenario happened with Stitch, but with 627 instead. But, 627 never learned the whole meaning of Ohana. He still stayed the same, only his evil side mellowed out thanks to Lilo. He's still evil, but Lilo can tame him when he gets too bad. The two are friends, but not Best Friends. The story goes 627 was evil, but some part of him liked Lilo, and she grew on him during what would be the first movie. He saw that she needed him, so he made a deal with the Grand Councilwoman to be good if his Exile was moved to Earth. She saw the change in him, and agreed. Lilo called him Charles at first, but now calls him 627, or 7 for short. Pleakley is still the same 1 eyed, Earth obsessed noodle from the first movie and Nani is still the same worried and protective older sister. We all know Bubbles is the same. Jumba, on the other hand, was always drifting of into his mind. His humor never died, but he never had that same smile or spark as he did in the first movie. Almost as if there was something he was missing dearly ( Hint, Hint ). The 2nd movie, where Stitch glitched never happened with 627. 627 was fully charged, and then caught ( You'll find out why in the story ). That leaves the 3rd movie, where all of Jumba's other Experiments were discovered. The same things basically happened, only Sparky watched from the sidelines and didn't rescue 627, and 627 busted Lilo out before he could be cut in half. 625 was activated, and will play as one of the key Experiments in this revision, along with 626. This story starts when Lilo and Stitch the series starts, only instead it's Lilo and 627. I hope you enjoy the story that is to come, and if you don't, there's other stories to read. Now, turn the page to the first chapter on the story of What if?[Chapter 2] Chapter 1: 625 \"625!\" I hear blubber butt shout. I grumble and pull my pillow over my head. \"625! Did you not hear me?!\" he called out with his booming voice. \"Oh no, I heard ya, I just chose to pretend I didn't\" I reply. He growled and picked me up. \"Hey, Hey, Hey! I'm trying to sleep here!\" I yelled at him. \"I don't care, you need to start pulling your weight around here!\" He ordered at me. He dropped me to the floor and handed me clear container. \"Follow me! We're going hunting\". \"Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow! You expect me to win against 627?\" I said, a bit fearful. Trust me when I say he's the last experiment that I'd like to dance with. \"I expect you to help. Or else no sandwiches for a month!\" I froze. \"What! For a month?! Now that's just cruel!\". I watched as he put on his blaster belt. \"Cruel or not, I haven't been paid for a month. And I can't lose another job\". I threw the container on the floor. \"Trust me, big guy, your career is the last thing on my mind!\" \"Then how would you feel if I kicked you out if you couldn't help me further on with my job? Would save me the trouble. And money!\" he argued. \"You're not going to kick me out! Then you'd really be a loner. Besides, you like my egg salad sandwiches too much\". I finish smuggly. \"Maybe. But if you don't help me catch an experiment by the end of the day, then it's your career that you should be worrying about\". He walked past me towards the elevator. \"Wait, your serious!\" I said. \"Well, look at you! Finally getting things done!\" I said, trying to get on his good side. \"At least when you get fired, you won't go down a complete moran\". He growled again. I yawned. I followed behind him as we headed towards town. Low and behold, guess who's already there? \"Gantu!\" the little girl called out, pointing at blubber face. \"Sorry stupid head, we beat you to her!\" 627 said. \"Oh well, you heard the guy, now let's go..\" I began to say before I was interrupted. \"No! We're taking that experiment!\" Gantu said shooting at 627. \"625! Make yourself useful for once!\" He shouted. 627 gave me an evil smile and took a breath. \"Oh no! I'm not getting into this!\" I shouted. Too late. He was already breathing fire at me. I look to my left and quickly grab a nearby table and use it as a shield. I felt the heat, but the table was working. When it stopped I looked up, and dodged a punch. \"Hey! Leave me out of this!\" 627 just laughed and kept trying to hit me, being his evil self. Gantu chased after the little girl who ran off with the experiment. I dodged another fire blast and jumped on a nearby building. 627 followed in suit. 'Man, this is getting annoying!' I thought. I ran as he kept trying to take me down, I yelped as a ice blast nearly hit me. \"Awe, come on! That's not fair!\" 627 just laughed. I ran until I bumped into Gantu. The little girl ran past us as 627 froze us together. \"Ya!\" she shouted. They left us with a wave after that. Gantu hopped us home, as one leg was caught in the block of ice. \"So, that went well. What do you say you go back out there and show them who's boss, eh?\" I asked. He didn't answer. I reached for his blaster in his pocket and began to blast the ice. \"AH!\" he screamed. The ice broke, but we both were covered in soot. \"Eh, I can always take a bath. I'm going to go make a sandwich\" I said. I reached for a knife, but was picked up. \"What, hey!\" I was carried to the door and thrown to the ground outside of the ship. \"625, I have no more patience for your games. Unless you have an experiment, you're not allowed back into my ship!\" \"Wha.. Hey!\" I called as the door slammed shut. I banged on it a few times, but only heard him walk away from the door. \"Great. Just great. Was made purposely by a mad scientist, seen as a failure at birth, and get thrown out onto the streets!\" I ranted. \"You know what? I don't need you!\" I shouted \"I can live happily and have a good job without you!\" I called out. \"Just me, myself, and I! Do you hear me?! Me, Myself, and I!\". There was a bang at the door. I huffed and turned away. I don't know why I felt so crushed by this, but I didn't care. If he wanted to throw me away, I'll do the same to him! Just like I did to Jumba. I walked through the forest until I came upon a small stream. As much as I hate baths, I stepped into the cold water and cleaned the soot out of my fur. \"Stupid blubber butt. Who needs him anyways! He snores like a hurricane!\" I muttered to myself. When I was finished, I shook the water from my fur and continued towards the town. \"Ok, now no one's going to accept a yellow gofer at work, so I'll need a disguise. I could probably nab something from a store or gift shop\" I said out loud. I whacked a branch in frustration, which broke from the tree. \"Who am I kidding! I'm a failure that no one wants. Not Jumba, not Gantu, not even the girl whose job is to find people's one true place!\" I sat on a rock and crossed my arms sadly. \"Is that what you think of me?\" I heard a girl say. I looked over to see the same girl who 627 helps. \"Well you haven't made any efforts to try and help me, so you can't blame me if I feel a little abandoned!\" I say bitterly. She looked genuinely guilty. \"I'm sorry. You're right, I have kind of left you out\". I threw the branch with all my might at a tree, breaking the stick, and knocking the tree over. \"It's fine. It's not the first time it's happened\". She walked up to me and sat down. \"Yeah, but it's no excuse for ignoring you. It's my job to make sure all of you find your place\". I huffed. \"Not to be a negative Nancy, but as you can tell I'm a failed experiment, so good luck\". She just thought for a second. \"Well, what do you do instead of what you were created to do?\". I just shrugged. \"I don't know, make sandwiches?\". She snapped her fingers and said \"That's it! I know a shop in town looking for a chef!\" I looked at her. \"A sandwich chef?\" she shrugged. \"There's no harm in finding out\". I sighed and slid off the rock. The girl just stayed there. \"Well, are we going or not?\" She smiled and followed me. \"My name's Lilo, by the way\". \"625\" I replied friendly. She 'hmm'ed. \"So you like to make sandwiches, right? How about I name you...Patty, short for pattymelt?\" I reeled back a little. No. \"..or, Monte? Like a montecristo?\" I plugged my nose, meaning that they stank, and I didn't. \"Or Pita-Pita-Sandwich Eat-a! Haha!\" she laughed. \"Ha, ha, ha, I don't think so!\" I replied. \"I know! Reuben!\". \"Huh, the classic corn beef, sauerkraut on rye. Reuben! Oo, I like that!\" I said. We walked into town and people gave me strange looks. \"So, uh, should I disguise myself, or?\" \"Just don't worry about it. If you start to get nervous, people will start asking questions. I don't know why\". We continued on until we arrived at a small cafe called \"Bret's Lunchtime!\". She took us in and asked \"Hello, are you Bret?\". The cashier smiled. \"That I am, now what can I get you?\". \"Actually, I just saw your hiring sign and have a friend who wants to apply for the job\". She pointed at me. \"This is Reuben. He's really good at making sandwiches\". I waved. \"Uhh, hi?\" he asked. I hopped up on the counter. \"So, what do I do to get the job?\". He seemed surprised that I talked, but didn't go on about it. \"Well, the job requires you to be available from 8 in the morning til 3 in the afternoon. You need to be able to cook and clean, and work fast pace\". He said. \"Well, I'll need to know what I'm cooking, but otherwise I'm open all day\". He looked at the empty cafe and took me to the kitchen. No one was in there and the place seemed dirty. \"Alright I'll be honest with ya kid. I'm running this out of my own pocket and have no staff. If sandwiches is all you can make, then I'll take it as long as their good. So, make something that'll wow me\". I gave a thumbs up as he went back out to the front. I hummed. \"Well, I'm not working in a dump, so I'll clean up a bit\" I said to myself. For the next half an hour I cleaned the kitchen, and made 3 sandwiches. A Reuben, because why not, a BLT, and a Tuna sandwich. I carried the plate out and set it next to him. Lilo was sitting at a nearby table. \"Sorry it took so long. I cleaned the place up a bit. Alright, I made a Reuben, a BLT, and a Tuna sandwich. Take your pick!\" Lilo came up and took the BLT. Bret took the Tuna. I took the Reuben. \"Wow! This is great!\" Lilo said. Bret seemed pleased. \"Wow. That's better than my mom's! You're hired!\" I smiled for the first time in a while. \"I'll need to make changes to the menu, though. What kind of sandwiches can you make?\" \"Any kind. I like to kind of experiment sometimes and make new kinds\". He took note of that. \"Well, my work here is done. Let me know if you need anymore help Reuben!\". I nodded. \"Thanks Lilo!\" She waved and left. I still felt sad, though. I really thought Gantu sort of liked me. So much for that.[Chapter 3] Chapter 2: 626 I sigh. Another fun day of catching cousins and beating up Gantu. That yellow dude was fun to play with. He was so weak! We brought the light blue experiment to Jumba. \"Ahh, Experiment 248! Designed to terrify enemy with high pitched scream!\" I flinched as she screamed again. \"I think I'll call her Belle. Short for Decibel\". \"You're 7 years old and you know what that means?\" I asked Lilo. She shrugged and smiled. Lilo still surprises me sometimes. \"Ahh, yes. Little girl is being very intelligent for such young age. Is reminding Jumba of… never mind\". I hate it when he does that. \"Come on Jumba! Tell us who you're always talking about!\". He gave us a sad smile. \"In time little girl, in time\". Both me and her moped. That's the one thing Jumba never tells us. Why he's always sad, or who he's missing. It's not his Ex-Wife, I know that for a fact. It's not his parents, because his hints don't add up to it. It could be a younger brother, or an old friend. He doesn't have any children, so it's not that. We thought it was an experiment, but I looked and through his files and didn't find any evidence of a favorite. That's one thing that constantly bothers me and some of my cousins. Me, Angel, Sparky, and Holio mostly. I like to think I'm more bothered by it because I'm his latest and most powerful experiment, but I'm not his 'best' or 'most successful' creation as he likes to describe. It's not something I can change, though. I just hope whoever it is, turns out to be good to him. I don't like to show it, but I do care about him and Lilo. If anything happened to either, I would probably lose it. But, no one really believes me because I'm still evil. Yeah, it would've been nice to be pure good, but this isn't a fairy tale. I was created to be completely evil, and no amount of good can change that. A good amount of it can change me, though. Which is why I stayed here with Lilo. She grew on me. I hated to say it, but she's my friend and she understands me. So here I stay, catching all of my cousins. It's not the worst life. It's better than being locked in a cramped cell, that's for sure. \"So, 7, what could Belle's one true place be?\" I thought about it. Just then Nani walks in the door. \"Oh, Lilo! What did I say about having experiments in the house!?\". Nani looked tired and crabby, which got me thinking. \"But Nani! She's in a container, and Jumba needed to identify the experiment!\". \"Yeah, that's nice Lilo, but we already have one wrecking ball in here, we don't need another\". She ranted. \"Actually, Experiment 248 was designed to..\" \"You're not helping!\" she snapped at Jumba. \"Look I'm really tired. I'm going to sleep for a few hours and when I wake up, I want that thing out of the house, got it?\" Lilo pouted, but I gave her a thumbs up. When Nani was gone, I chuckled evilly. \"What is 627 thinking?\" Jumba asked. \"Well, Nani's always complaining how her alarm clock doesn't work\". Lilo got the idea not a second later. \"Heh, heh, heh, very cruel you two. Would make excellent evil genius' one day\" Jumba said, walking away. We snuck up to Nani's room, and on my signal, let Belle into the room. We told her in a few hours to let out a scream. After a good laugh, we went back into our dome to practice our hula. We practiced for a while until I got tired myself. I fell asleep. Sometimes I wonder what would've happened if I wasn't the one to meet Lilo and stay on Earth. I guess we'll never know, right? Gantu's POV I began to regret kicking 625 out right about now. Though to be honest, I didn't have a choice. He was dead weight and only taking up money. I kept telling myself that, and as plausible as it seemed, I still felt bad. He did make a pretty good Egg Salad sandwich. I sighed and casted 625 out of my head. \"Stop it Gantu! It was a good choice and you know it!\" I yelled. I heard the feminine voice of the Pod Carrier go off. \"Warning! Experiment 6-2-6 has been activated. Primary Function: Military Weapon and Bringer of Destruction\". \"626? Bringer of Destruction? Perhaps this day wasn't a total loss!\" I said to myself. I got on my gear and left the ship. \"If luck is on my side, the little girl and the trog haven't found it yet!\" 626's POV I woke up in a jungle of sorts. I looked around on guard for a few seconds when some sort of liquid dropped on my nose. My guard fell and I looked up to see a clear liquid dropping off a leaf. I stuck my tongue out and let it fall. It tasted like nothing. I shook my fur and looked around. I wonder where Jumba is? Last thing I remember was him telling me to get into a strange machine kind of frantically. I listened to see if there's sort of inhabitants around me that I could destroy. I waited a minute and finally heard some sound of life. I rolled up into a ball and went into the direction of the noise. I stopped when I got to the end of the forest. It was no city, and I didn't feel any strong urge to destroy, but it was still nagging me, so I caved and ran into the street. It was active and, what seemed to be under advanced cars, stopped, crashed, and swerved away from me. I laughed and picked up a car that had crashed into a pole. People screamed and I snarled at them. I threw the car, it being about to crash into a small building when something stopped it. I looked on, curiously. What I did not expect was it to come flying back at me. I growled and held my ground as it smacked into me and sent me into the building behind me. Alarms started going off, riling up my need to destroy like a hound. I shook off the dull sting I got from the impact to see who my attacker was. Another experiment, looking almost exactly like me. Only his head was larger. And his fur was red. He looked just as shocked to see me as well. I growled and got on all paws. He took a battle stance as I charged him. Lunging at him he rammed his head into mine, which to my surprise, actually hurt . I fell on my butt and rubbed my head, but decided not to go easy on him. I waited a few seconds to throw him off when I lunged again and hit his head with equal force as his, surprising him. He crashed into a maintenance store window. A little girl with long, black hair and a red-flower dress looked at me, jaw practically hitting the floor. The red guy looked just as surprised. I fell on my clutching my stomach, practically dying in laughter. That made me all giddy and ready to fight. I jumped back and snapped out of my laughter when I barely dodged a blast of fire. Not that it would have harmed me, I just wasn't in the mood to clean off soot from my fur. The red guy looked officially pissed. I giggled again. He sucked in a large breath and I tensed ready to jump from whatever blast he was preparing. What I didn't expect was a glass pod to trap me between the ground. I looked up to see a giant shark-guy. \"Gantu!\" cried the little girl. 'Gantu? Is that some sort of language for run?' I thought. I still stayed on guard, though when he knocked me to the back of the pod, and closed it, I fumbled. I snarled and tried to claw my way out, but my claws weren't enough. \"That's right little earthling, looks like I got the upper hand this time. Wait, his name was Gantu? The poor soul. Oh right, he captured me, I change my mind. The red guy growled and breathed fire at us, but the shark ran. He threw me onto his back. 'Is this guy dumb or something? You don't turn your back to your enemy, and most certainly don't put the person your capturing out of your sight, let along facing the enemy! I guess he'll have to learn the hard way' I thought. I pressed my paws to the glass and smashed my face into it, breaking a hole big enough to get out. \"What the…\" he said. For the second time I was met with shocked faces. \"Dinko te faba!\" I laughed while running away. \"He talks?!\" both the red guy and girl said. I jumped off a poorly made car, onto a tree branch, and on top of a strange looking tree. 'What was this planet, Earth he said? How did I end up on such a weak planet?' I thought. I gave an evil grin as I picked some of the hard, brown fruits off and threw it at them. The red experiment shielded the red girl from them while the shark just took the hits. Maybe the red female was the red experiment's mate? Amature. I laughed and was about to throw another when he finally pulled out something I recognized. A blaster. He shot me with it, hitting my stomach. I caught it as it bounced off of me and threw myself up again, looking at it. \"Ooo\" I said curiously. \"What!?\" The shark said. I growled and threw it right back at him, destroying his blaster. I fell back, cackling madly. This guy was too funny. \"Hey that was my favorite blaster!\" he complained. I sat back up and stuck my tongue out at him in a raspberry. \"Wow. Not five minutes after meeting you and the experiment already doesn't like you. That must be a new record, Gantu!\" The red experiment said. \"Wha...he doesn't not like me….he's...he's just confused! Yeah!\" Gantu said. 'As if!' I thought. Gantu's attention was off of me, so I felt ok enough to go down to them. They didn't notice. I was actually a few feet from them, and they were too busy arguing to notice. At least the experiment and Gantu. 'Hehe, Gantu. Funny name for a funny guy'. \"Is not!\" Red shouted. \"Is too!\" Gantu argued \"Is not!\" \"Is too!\" I crawled up the the girl curiously and pointed at them with a look that said 'Seriously?'. She giggled. I just looked at them curiously. \"Sorry about those two. They kind of hate each other after he tried to kidnap me\". I looked at her curiously. I sniffed her and realized she was a child and that she was REALLY weak. \"What experiment are you? I mean, if you can talk english at all\". I put a hand on my hip and a claw to my face, going over the translation, blocking out the arguing. \"E...exp..p..periment s..s..626!\" I stuttered out. She gasped softly. \"Really?!\" I gave a fierce nod with an \"Ih!\" I puffed out my chest and snarled playfully. She wasn't threatened so I figured she could tell. I smiled back wondering why I wasn't attacking or destroying anything. 'Too small a town for my programming I suppose' I thought. I brought my attention back to the fighting to my right. I sat down next to the girl and just looked on as the shark-guy got his butt kicked. I honestly have never seen anything funnier in my life. All the destruction he made, all the fire. I liked this guy instantly. When he threw Gantu into a building, he clapped his hand in a 'job-well-done' fashion. I clapped excitedly from where I was. \" Do it again! \" I said in Tantalog. \"Wow, you tamed him fast\" he said to the girl. \"I didn't tame him. I think? He just crawled right up to me and started to sniff me. He even spoke! He said he was 626!\" she said. Yep, definitely a child. He looked at me evilily, but with some shock. I looked at him curiously. He walked right up to me and I stood, sniffing him a little. \"So, you're the experiment Jumba made before me. 627\" he said, holding out a hand. I looked at him strangely. I didn't really care if Jumba made more experiments after me, as long as they didn't get in my way. I reach for his hand to greet him when he shocked me. Like, electricity shocked. I pulled back cradling my wrist. \"Oww!\" I whined. He chuckled. \"Consider that payback for headbutting me into a building\". I growled at him and lunged at his head, biting down with all my jaw strength. \"Ow! Hey, get off!\" He yelled. I wasn't scared. Nothing but water could do that. 627's POV Sadly, despite my best efforts to move him, this is how we took him back to the house. Latched to my head. He stopped biting me, and was nuzzling into me, but anytime I tried to pry him off, he would clamp down on my head. He's got guts, I'll give him that. Lilo managed to convince him to hide his extra arms, antenne, and back spines, but that's all we could do. We sadly enough for Lilo, ran into her 'friend's' and made the excuse of him being my brother. They called us Ugly's #1 and #2. That was the only time 626, as he was called, came off my head. He growled at them and chased them away. We ran after him, and me grabbing his ears stopped his pursuit. He mumbled in Tantalog about tearing them limb from limb before climbing back on my shoulders. We walked back the rest of the way, when we saw Jumba and Pleakley about to test one of Jumba's inventions. \"Why is one-eyed noodle so worried? It is small chances of explosion!\" I heard Jumba complain. \"B..Because! It's...it's..Evil!\" I rolled my eyes at Pleakley. 626 perked up when hearing Jumba. \"Jumba?\" he said from atop my head. \"Jumba! Pleakley! We found another experiment!\" Lilo shouted. Jumba looked at us, ready to tell us to hold on when he froze. Jumba never freezes. \"626?!\" Author's Note : Surprise, surprise my llamas! What do you think?

I also wanna put songs for the chapters so if someone could help with that, that'd be great. We've all seen at least one or two episodes of the TV show Friends, right? When Joey says, \"How you doin?\" that's what my character Colbie is going to say. Just saying! Chapter 1 (~Colbie's POV~) Louie and I were in his front yard tossing a football back and forth to each other. \"I heard from your mom that there was supposed to be a football meeting today.\" I said I tossed the ball to him. He went inside his house and came back out and drug me with him and we started running for the school. Lucky for us it was only two blocks away. We ran like the devil was chasing after us and the only time I've ever seen Louie run was for food. I went through the front door of the school to find the gym. I looked threw the gym doors and saw a bunch black guys goofing around. I saw Louie come threw another set of doors he ignored the look I gave him and we went in. \"I'm Louie Lastik,\" He introduced himself to the coach trying to catch his breath \"Naval family just moved here from Bayonne someone said football so I come runnin. What's going on everybody?\" I finally caught up with him and ran into his arm \"Damn it, Louie!\" I stumbled backwards and was caught by two strong hands that helped me steady myself. \"He just drug me with him.\" I said, pointing at Louie explaining to the coaches why I was here trying to catch my breath back. It was a really awkward silence and they were looking at Louie. I straightened myself up whoever helped me up had their hands still on me. While the rest of the guys where occupied and really didn't know what to think of the white boy and this white girl that showed up with him. I turned my head around my big round blue eyes looking into big brown eyes I smiled at him (his hands where still on my waist). I was probably blushing really badly. \"I'm Colbie.\" I whispered. \"Jerry, but everyone calls me Rev.\" He whispered back, I could feel his breath on his face. I got goose bumps. The doors burst opened in a not so friendly way and more than 20 white guys came in. I turned back around with Rev's protective hands still on me. He brought me closer to him, his hands practically covering my tiny waist. (~End of Colbie's POV~) (~Rev's POV~) I helped the girl, who was named Colbie from falling backwards my hands where on her waist which practically covered it. She was petite; if I'm right she's probably 5'0. Colbie had the biggest round bright blue eyes I have ever seen, a round face, she didn't have fair skin like a lot of these white boys have or her friend Louie but she shad warm complexion and you could tell she goes out in the sun a lot, and she has black hair that was down to the middle of her back. Some of the white guys where glaring hard at Colbie and I. I hugged her even closer to me; they probably thought we were dating. She was still tense but relaxed a little bit. Coach Boone and Coach Yoast walked out and that only left Coach Hines and the other white coach. You could hear a pin being dropped some were. (~End of Rev's POV~) (~Colbie's POV~) I read mostly everybody's mind and they were not happy about this whole situation at all. I didn't want to but I read Rev's mind and he was starting to like me. Yeah, that's the thing about me I can read people's mind and from some of the minds I've read I've got a little bit of dirt on everybody in this gym. The meeting was finally over and everybody started to leave the gym. I leaned back against Rev. \"Well that was fun.\" I said sarcastically some of the guys chuckled. I turned to look at Rev. \"Um, hey, you can let go now.\" I smiled up at him. He let me go. Some of the guys were still in the gym (yes, Rev was still in there). Louie came over. \"Hey, let's go talk to coach.\" \"Coach Boone, this is my God – Sister Colbie Cooper.\" He went on to saying that he didn't feel comfortable enough to leave me at my house when my mom is staying with a friend and my dad is dealing with personal business. \"I think we can find something for you to do.\" Coach Boone said \"Thanks, Coach!\" I said and Louie and I left and some of the guys that were about to be a team where still here. \"You coming to camp with us?\" I turned around, he was taller than me. He had blonde hair, a strong jaw line and facial features, his eyes were a cold dark blue. \"Uh, maybe, I think why?\" I already didn't like him my 6th sense started kicking up and I read his mind on what he wanted to do to me at camp. He came closer to me. I hated being short. \"I'm gonna make your life a living hell for you and your boy,\" He said, he was referring to Rev. \"Pipsqueak.\" We were staring each other down.

I watched Remember the Titans earlier today. My favorite character is Sunshine - how could he not be, after seeing him do Tai Chi? Haha, I was more impressed by Sunshine's kissing of Gerry, and sending him flying into a table, at that. You gotta admit, he's smooth! But, this is my take on his emotions when Rev was injured. Hopefully I got all the dialogue right, but enjoy, nonetheless! \"Let him Through\" Ronnie 'Sunshine' Bass could have sworn his heart nearly stopped when Jerry 'Rev' Harris was crunched under the body of number 48 of the opposing team. C'mon, this has got to be a joke... Rev, get up! Rev didn't rise. He watched on anxiously as Coach Boone went over to investigate. They soon hustled him away - he only caught a glimpse of Rev's pained face as they passed. Oh damn... He's hurt bad... Sunshine frowned, face twisted with a mix of emotions. \"Ronny Bass!\" Coach Boone's shout broke Sunshine out of his thoughts, and he strode forward. \"Coach? You guys going back in, right?\" Sunshine asked anxiously. He was a squirming bundle of nerves on the inside, but kept a somewhat calm expression on his face. \"Not a quarterback, son,\" Boone said. Sunshine groaned inwardly - he knew what was coming. \"I-\" Sunshine stammered. \"I can't make that pitch, coach.\" He knew he was a great runner, his accuracy was good, but... Under the pressure... Sunshine wasn't sure if he would perform correctly. \"Yes you can,\" Boone said, his voice barely over a whisper. He pointed a finger at Sunshine, before launching into a lecture mode. \"When I was fifteen years old, I lost my mother and my father in the same month Ronny, same month!\" Sunshine started to look at the ground, in a movement of awkward embarrassment. However, the Coach kept eye contact, and Sunshine gave himself in. \"Twelve brothers and sisters, I was the youngest one, but they were all lookin' up to me. Now, I wasn't ready yet either, but they needed me. Your team needs you tonight.\" His voice rose a fraction. Sunshine looked to one side, before bringing his head back up. \"Y-\" He was cut off. \"You're the Colonel, you're gonna command your troops tonight, you understand?\" Sunshine wavered under Coach Boone's fierce glare. The pointer finger on his chest didn't help a bit either. He said something Sunshine didn't quite catch, (he was still trying to get his emotions under control,) but when the Coach gave him a push on the back, he knew the game was on. Fastening his helmet on, Sunshine jogged out onto the field, facing the other Titans milling around in the field. They were a bit lost, startled and shocked. Sunshine could understand why, but they couldn't dwell on it now, not where there was a game to win. And Sunshine had an idea, personally crafted for that number 48... \"Let's go, he panted, fixing the last strap of his helmet. Facing his 'troops', he gave a strange, somewhat chilling grin. \"What'sa matter, haven't you seen a football injury before you wimps?\" Nodding, Sunshine continued with all the bluster he could draw upon. \"Let's go, show some confidence in me, I got it,\" he continued. \"It's gonna be alright.\" \"Budds, you release this time,\" he said. Ray nodded, still trying to catch his breath. \"Louie, let him through, alright?\" He placed a hand on Louie's helmet. They both knew who he was talking about. \"What?\" Louie stared at him, as if he had lost his mind. Sunshine nodded. \"Just let him through,\" he said calmly. \"Trust me.\" No more words needed to be spoken. They were on the same wavelength now, even if they weren't quite sure what Sunshine had in mind. As the referee blew the whistle, Sunshine's heart began to pound. He took a deep breath, trying to calm his racing heartbeat. He placed his hand on the football, stilling his shaking limbs. \"Ready?\" he barked out. \"Set! Blue 21, blue 21, hut!\" As 48 charged at Louie, he straightened, letting 48 barrel right past him. Sunshine ran back, his mind a plethora of emotions. No... What am I doing, this is crazy! If I miss... Sunshine pushed all thoughts out of his head. He had survived a rage driven Gerry before - this was nothing. Behind the guard of his helmet, he gave a private smile as he noticed 48 bearing down on him. He flung the ball a moment before 48 closed on him. The next few seconds were a blur to the blonde - he ducked the instant 48 lunged at him, and flipped the marginally larger player over his back, slamming him on the grass. A sprig of pleasure shot through him as he completed the motion, staring down at the fallen player. Tai Chi served him well after all. Sunshine barely noticed as the crowd cheered, letting the elation sweep through his soul, his anger slowly dripping away. Louie gave a big yell, and 48 groaned. Sunshine only stared as 48 was helped up by his teammates. He met the icy glare with one of his own, a small smirk dancing its way across his face. The rest of the game was played wonderfully. Every move was cold, calculating, and in the end, the game was won. Let him through, eh? Sunshine thought to himself, as they were back in the locker rooms. Not one of my smartest decisions ever... But worth the risk. Let him through. I should remember that more often. Mew: Like it? Any other suggestions for Remember the Titans fanfictions? Well, leave me a review! :D Always appreciated.

Julius and Gerry slowly walked on the field talking to each other, realizing this is their last game in high school together, realizing this state championship game is much bigger than their team. It's a game for their community to finally come together as black and white unite, realizing that color is only a color. Demanding that they make every single play between those white lines. They realize how far they have come from where they and their team stated, from foes to best friends on and off the field. On the opponent 20 yard line down five points with ten seconds left on the clock. Enough time for one final play, Julius goes over to Coach Boone and Coach Yoast to call in the last play of their career. \"Whats it going to be coach?,\" says Julius. Coach Boone calls their third and final timeout, gathering his thoughts. Realizing how much is riding on the state championship game. The announcers in the press box are talking about this situation, \"They have to pass. They have no choice but to pass, all their backs are out,\" Coach Yoast is tweakin right now because we aint got no running back. \"I need a running back,\" Coach Boone shouts to the bench. \"Gerry, can you do it?,\" Says Coach Boone. \"yes, sir,\" Gerry crys out. \"Can you hang on to the ball,\" Boone demands. \"This is my ball coach,\" says Gerry. \"All right now heres what were gonna do. I right wiggle, switchblade,\" Boone delivers the play to the offense. Julius looks at Gerry without hesitation, telling him, \"this is your time,\". He gets to the huddle and says the play in pain, \"I right wiggle, switchblade.\" \"For the state championship. I love all y'all, baby. I love all of ya. Lets go on one, ready? Break!,\" Crys out Julius. \"Twenty-two thousand people in the stadium, folks, and every seat is empty because everyone is on their feet,\" Says the announcers. The offensive line digs in. The defense digs in to face it. Julius. \"Ready. Set. Hut\" Julius hands the ball off to Gerry, runs over a defender and another, looking like Walter Payton. Both teams pushing with all their mite, with blood, sweat, and tears. Clock strikes zero. Down to the one yard line. \"Is he in?,\" announcers shout. \"You got him short?,\" yells the official to the other. \"That's the ball game,\" announcers yell. With the opponents rushing on the field with such joy. Coach Boone gathers all the players in the locker room after the game to give his postgame speech, with everyone bawling their eyes out. \"You men played like champions, you never gave up. And champions hold their heads high,\" Says Coach Boone. \"What you guys achieved goes way beyond the win-lose column, you achieved something people spend their whole lives trying to find. You gentleman taught this community to trust the soul of a man, rather than the look, and I am so damn proud of you\" Coach Yoast waits his turn to talk, and says, \"Thank you all, and good luck to the seniors with their future plans, good luck to Gerry and Julius at the University of Notre Dame where they continue to pursue their playing career, and underclassman lets get right back to this game next season, I demand perfection between those white lines,\" ","Summary":" Demanding perfection between the white lines \"We're in a fight, you boys are doing all that you ca"},{"Movie":"Remember the Titans","Title":"Dusk Till Dawn","Author":"RobicheauxRocks101","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12097825","Passage":"[Chapter 1] It was good that Ronnie lived alone. At least it was for Gerry, anyway. That way he wouldn't be caught. Not that they weren't already risking that, with the way the bed was rocking and clanging. Surely the neighbors could hear. If they couldn't they were deaf. In moments like this, though, Gerry could care less. His world at that particular point in time revolved around a beautiful blonde quarterback and the way he was squirming and moaning beneath him, his pretty face gasping and scrunching up in pleasure. Those sweet supple lips parting to reveal a delicacy of a mouth. Emma would hate him. His mother would disown him. The guys would never let him live it down. He didn't care now, though. Sure, tomorrow, just like all the other times, he'd avoid Sunshine in the halls and at practice, pretend nothing had happened and crush his precious heart all over again. But then the very next night he'd end up right back here, his hands full of soft blonde hair as he plowed the smaller boy into the bed, kissing on his neck and nipping at the skin as he did so. \"Gerry...\" Ronnie gasped out, face pressed into the pillows. \"Fuck, Ronnie...\" Came a grunt of a reply. Gerry didn't want to hurt him, and he didn't try, but every time he walked away from him, every time he ducked his head in the halls, it killed Sunshine a little bit inside. But ofcourse all was always forgiven. Ronnie knew that Gerry was still figuring things out, and that was fine. He'd been there once. It was rough. That didn't stop him from falling hopelessly in love with Bertier, though. Even if the feeling wasn't exactly mutual. \"You going home?\" Sunshine asked the next morning, still resting in bed, snuggled up close to Gerry, who had an arm around him. \"Guess so.\" Gerry shrugged. \"Yeah well...\" Ronnie didn't finish the thought. Gerry wouldn't stay. He never did. Most of the time he was lucky to catch him before he left in the morning. Gerry took his arm away from Sunshine and stood up from the bed, looking for his pants that he'd tossed to the floor the night before. \"See you at practice then, right?\" Sunshine asked, sitting up in bed and pulling the blankets around him for warmth. \"Right.\" Gerry nodded, pulling his pants back up and zipping them before walking towards the door to leave. \"Gerry...\" Ronnie called to him before he could close the door back behind him. \"Yeah?\" Gerry asked, looking back behind him. Ronnie couldn't do it. Not yet. \"Never mind.\" He sighed. \"See you at practice.\" Gerry waved to him before leaving. \"I love you...\" Sunshine mouthed, after the door had shut. He wondered if he'd ever work up the guts to say it to his face. ","Summary":" It was good that Ronnie lived alone. At least it was for Gerry, anyway.

He took a seat next to Petey and Blue. \"All right, all right.\" Alice, Gerry's nurse, would really be mad when she found out Gerry was hiding his whole team in his room. Gerry hurriedly shushed his friends. Rev looked around the room. Everyone seemed a little down. Their all-American paralyzed—it was hard to comprehend. \"Did you bring it?\" Gerry suddenly asked. Julius, who had been leaning against the wall closest to Bertier, looked up. \"Bring what, man?\" Rev shrugged. \"Aw, c'mon, man, you know what he means. The Bible, yo! The Holy Bible, the Word of God the Father!\" Blue chuckled, patting Rev's back. Jerry Harris shrugged again. \"Yeah, I brought it.\" \"All right, cool, man, read me a story.\" Gerry suggested. \"A story?\" Rev laughed, looking around. Everyone seemed in on it. \"Y'all want a story?\" \"Yeah, man, somethin' uplifting and all.\" Petey represented the team with his words. Gerry nodded. \"Well, what'd y'all wanna hear?\" Rev asked, pulling the small Bible from his pocket. \"All I've got is the New Testament.\" \"Lemme see that, man.\" Julius held out his hand. Rev was hesitant, his hands firmly held around the binding. \"Man this is personal, man.\" He whispered. \"I won't tell nobody nothin', man.\" Julius promised with a trustworthy nod, and Rev handed it over. Flipping it open, Julius filed through the dog-eared pages. Most of the four Gospels had been underlined so many times Julius could barely make out the words. Words were written on the sides of the page where the text wasn't, in Rev's neat cursive, the words were easily readable. And shall we not be united, too? Just like Samaritan to the Jew, can we not receive such kindness from white folk? How different are we, really? We believe in the same God and we go to the same heaven, how different are we? Why did that poor brother have to be- Campbell tore himself away from the words, clearing his throat. He didn't want to recall the story of the black boy who had been shot. He looked over at his best friend, his Superman, and smiled. \"How about the 'Good Samaritan'?\" He asked. Gerry smiled at him, they both knew the story. Other players groaned. \"We've heard that story before man!\" \"That's so old!\" \"Well?\" Gerry threw the old Bible to Rev, who caught it. He stared at Julius; somehow he knew Julius had read what he wrote. His eyes softened. \"So, y'all know the story, huh?\" He asked, opening up to the chapter of Luke where his notes had been written. Everyone nodded. \"No.\" A voice broke through the silence. Louie Lastik was looking down at his folded hands. \"I don't know the story, man.\" he mumbled. \"You don't know the story? Did you go to Sunday School?\" Alan asked in disbelief, lightly throwing a football to Sunshine, who caught it in one hand. \"No one in my family ever went to no church.\" Louie shrugged. \"All right, man, I'll tell it to ya.\" Rev smiled. \"Hey man, there another Bible in this room?\" he asked Gerry, who nodded, pointing to the cupboard. Julius got it out and threw it to the Rev. \"Hand that to Louie, will ya, brother?\" Rev asked Petey. \"Tell him to read along. Luke 10: 25-37, got it?\" \"Who's Luke?\" Louie asked. Petey shook his head in disbelief. Alan laughed, opening the Bible. \"It's right in the middle, dude. Matthew, Mark, Luke .\" He skipped to Luke 10, and then pointed it out to Louie, who mumbled his thanks sheepishly. Without further delay, Rev began. \"On one occasion an expert in the law stood up to test Jesus. 'Teacher,' he asked, 'what must I do to inherit eternal life?' \"'What is written in the Law?' He replied. 'How do you read it?' \"He answered, 'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind'; and, 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' \"'You have answered correctly,' Jesus replied. 'Do this and you will live.' \"But he wanted to justify himself, so he asked Jesus, 'And who is my neighbor?' \"In reply Jesus said: 'A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, when he was attacked by robbers. They stripped him of his clothes, beat him and went away, leaving him half dead. A priest happened to be going down the same road, and when he saw the man, he passed by on the other side. So too, a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side. But a Samaritan, as he traveled, came where the man was; and when he saw him, he took pity on him. He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he put the man on his own donkey, brought him to an inn and took care of him. The next day he took out two denariiand gave them to the innkeeper. 'Look after him,' he said, 'and when I return, I will reimburse you for any extra expense you may have.' \"'Which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of robbers?'\" Rev asked Louie. While reading the passage Rev had gotten up, sitting down next to Louie and helping him stay on the right verse. Louie looked up and saw everyone's eyes on him. \"The guy who was kind—the Samaritan.\" Louie answered quickly, hopeful he was right. No one said anything. Very slowly, Rev began to smile. \"Jesus told him, 'Go and do likewise.'\" From outside the door, Coach Herman Boone flagged down a nurse. \"Could you give Gerry Bertier some water? He's real thirsty.\" \"Of course, sir.\" she replied, walking off to do so. \"Me?\" Louis asked, from back inside the door. \"Yeah, you.\" Rev elbowed him playfully. \"All of us, man, all of us brothers.\" He looked down at the Word. \"I mean, that man—the Samaritan—he helped the Jew even though everyone in their countries were against each other having a relationship. And shall we not be united, too? Just like Samaritan to the Jew, can we not receive such kindness from whites and blacks?\" Rev looked at Julius as he spoke, his own words speaking to the men. \"How different are we, really? We believe in the same God and we go to the same heaven, how different are we? The same Jesus that died for Alan died for me. And He died for Petey, Sunshine, Blue, Gerry, Julius, Coach Yoast, Coach Boone, Coach Hinds, and Coach Tyrell, all of us.\" Some of the players clapped. \"Amen,\" Blue whispered. \"And you know what; He died for you, too, Louie Lastik.\" Rev placed a hand on the big man's shoulder. \"He died to wash away your sins, because He loves you, brother. He loves whites, and He loves blacks, and there ain't no difference to Him what color we are, because in His eyes we are all His children. His creation. His to love.\" \"What if He doesn't care about me?\" Louie whimpered. \"I was told there was no God, He's not real, He doesn't live anywhere, you can't see Him or nothin', man!\" \"You know what, He does live, He lives right here.\" Rev pointed to Louie's heart. \"He's always been there, waiting for you to let Him in, for you to accept the Lord Almighty as your Savior and Father.\" \"Amen,\" Petey called out. \"How do I let Him know?\" Louie asked urgently. \"I gotta let him know, man.\" \"Well we gotta pray, brother.\" Blue said, watching as a nurse placed a cup of water on Gerry's nightstand. \"Uh, I didn't ask for this-\" Gerry called out but she already closed the door. Shrugging, Gerry reached for it. \"Don't, man.\" Julius slapped his hand away. \"What?\" Gerry spluttered the water he took a sip of. \"You can't drink that water, man.\" \"Listen, Campbell, it ain't no kryptonite, don't worry.\" He joked. \"Nah, man, can't you see?\" Julius looked at Rev. \"This here is Holy Water. And we gonna baptize big Louie.\" \"Baptism? What's that?\" Louie asked Rev, who was looking at Gerry and Julius, a big smile on his face. \"We gonna have a baptism!\" A player cheered. Everyone joined in as Rev shrugged, got up, and took the water. He poured it into the vomit bucket that was left on Gerry's nightstand. He hadn't used it, and it was the only thing he could find. \"All right, everyone, gather in around Gerry.\" Rev called. He waited for the players to file in. \"If we could just close our eyes and remain silent.\" He was surprised to see Coach Boone walk in and join them. \"Coach,\" he whispered. Boone put a finger to his lips; he didn't want to be seen, this was not his time to intrude. \"Lord, we come to You today as a united team. We are all united in Your eyes, there are no barriers to break through to get to You, except maybe our own stubbornness. Father, we want to lift up the names of some of our brothers to You, that You may watch over them and care for them like You do to everyone in this world. Know that they love You back Lord, they love You. \"We come here today to pray over Gerry Bertier, we all hope he gets better and learns how to use a wheelchair soon, Lord.\" Gerry smiled, eyes closed. \"'Cause You know he's gonna be coming to every one of our games, sitting right there on the bench next to us. \"We know Gerry knows You, and loves You, but some of us here don't, and we want to…we wanna baptize them, Lord.\" Rev motioned for Louie, who walked over to him. \"Lewis Lastik, do you believe that our Father is Jesus Christ your Lord and Savior?\" \"I do.\" Louie nearly choked up. He grabbed Rev's hands, squeezing them so tight he cringed. \"All right, all right , brother.\" Rev chuckled; his wrist was still broken, after all. He took some water and placed it on Louie's head, keeping his hand there as he spoke. \"Upon your profession of faith and in accordance with the Lord's command, I baptize you, brother, in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Buried in the likeness of His death and raised in the likeness of His resurrection.\" \"Amen. Amen !\" Louie whispered. He pulled Rev into a tight squeeze, picking him up off his feet and spinning him around. \"Amen, brother!\" Rev cheered, and when Louie set him down some other players stepped forward, led by Sunshine. \"Could you baptize us, too, bro?\" Sunshine asked. \"You know California, and, I mean-\" \"Sure.\" Rev smiled and began the process again. Boone had walked over to Julius, and was patting his back. \"You're a good friend, Campbell.\" he said. \"Gerry really likes you.\" \"Thanks, sir.\" Julius smiled shyly, looking down at Bertier, who was asleep, his hands still folded, a smile still on his face. \"I think he's a pretty good friend, too.\" Boone looked down, smiling. On the ground lay Rev's open Bible. Boone picked it up, staring at the footnotes and lines, and shut it. Wasn't his business. \"Rev!\" he called to his Titan, who was busy being hugged by Petey and Blue. Alan looked ready to pounce as well. \"Sir!\" Rev called from the crowd of people, breaking free to stand in front of him. \"I'm proud, son.\" Boone held out his hand. Rev took it, pulling his coach into a hug. \"Yes, sir.\" he smiled. \"Thank you sir.\" \"You're going to need this, son.\" he handed the New Testament back to Rev, who gratefully slipped it in his pocket. \"Yes sir.\" \"Now, what do you say we all let Bertier get his rest, huh?\" Boone suggested. \"Oh, we're gonna need it too, 'cause we gonna when the championship, y'all!\" Blue cried and the boys cheered, leaving the room in a mass of people. \"Oh, sir?\" A nurse stopped Boone. \"Did you get the water you needed?\" \"Yes, ma'am.\" Boone answered, smiling at the Rev, who was staring at him, dumbfounded. \"Goodnight, son.\" he patted Harris's shoulder. \"And God bless!\" \"God bless us, everyone.\" Alan said in a high-pitched voice. The other Titans groaned or laughed, but the Rev smiled. It was true, after all.

I just realized that by pure coincidence, I published this on Father's Day. :) It's Friday afternoon, late, but with the the long summer days, the cool of evening is still hours away. The boys are doing drills on the football field, exhausted and sweating into their uniforms. Coach Boone stands at one edge of the field, steely-eyed behind his sunglasses, as the scorching sun beats down on his back and shoulders. His whistle is tight between his lips and blows it at regular intervals, ordering the boys to push their bodies further. Their muscles are already in agony, and he can feel their hatred for him rising up from the field like heat waves. That's when he hears the bumpity-bump of the old station wagon's engine. He turns his head and sees it pulling up in the parking lot beyond the football field. He can just make out Carol and the girls through the windshield. They must be here for a surprise visit for the weekend. Coach Boone sighs around his whistle, mixed emotions churning up inside him. The situation here is so tense - between the black and white students, between the players and him - and even though he's missed his family every day, he doesn't want to see them in this outdated, uncomfortable camp. Hell, even the nicest cabins are hot and sticky from racial hatred and faulty air-conditioners. She didn't tell me they were coming. His lips purse around his whistle, and he blows twice, signaling the end of practice for that day. The boys groan in relief as they start off the field, and he heads slowly towards the parking lot. As happy as he is to see Carol and the girls, he has to be careful about greeting them. Too much affection would set the boys snickering at him, and he can't afford to lose face after he's worked so hard to establish authority. Dammit, baby, he thinks as Carol climbs out of the car and waves to him, you know I don't like surpises. Then he sees the soft, familiar curve of Carol's back as she leans over to take Karen out of her carseat, and it makes him stop short. Suddenly he just wants to grab her in his arms and kiss her so badly that he wouldn't care if every boy on his whole damn team was watching. Just in time, he tears his eyes away from Carol to notice that Nikki is running at him full-speed, a blur in a pink dress, her pigtails flying out behind her. Even though she's never been athletic, she covers the distance from the car in no time at all, and before he knows it, she's flinging herself at him, filling his arms. \"Daddy, Daddy, Daddy ! I missed you so much !\" He smells her nail polish as she wraps her arms around his neck, and he can taste her strawberry lip gloss when she kisses him on the lips. Her cheek is smooth against the rough, sweaty stubble on his. For a second, he just holds her tightly against his chest. It's like he's been transported to an alternate universe. Ever since he arrived at this camp, his days have been endless replays of grueling practices, bone-breaking tackles, football fields and locker rooms crowded with sweaty, smelly players. But Nikki is a world away from that. She's the color pink and giggling and dolls and hair ribbons. It's the most welcome change he's had in weeks, and the warning he gave himself just a few minutes ago to greet them with some reservation goes right out his head. He hugs Nikki, kisses Carol, and scoops Karen up in his arms and tosses her into the sky, which makes her shriek with laughter. He has a sudden urge to toss her up again and again, just to keep hearing that sweet sound. God, he's missed them. He's holding Karen on his hip and has one arm around Carol, while Nikki dances in a circle around them, recounting every every single thing she's done since he left, when, over the excited babble of his daughter's voice, Coach Boone hears an entirely different sort of laughter. He just turns his head halfway, but it's enough to see that only about half the team has cleared the football field for the showers. The other half is still on the grass, watching their coach greet his family with a variety of different expressions on their young, pimply faces. Many of them look shocked. He can see Blue's mouth hanging open behind his helmet, as he tries to wrap his mind around the fact that the coach who nearly murdered him for asking for a water break - \"Water is for washing the blood off your uniform, and boy, you don't get no blood on my uniform!\" - is now greeting his little girls with hugs and kisses. But other players are snickering behind their hands at their coach's display of affection. A few even laugh openly and point at him. Coach Boone sees a few black and white boys grin and nudge each other, and he grimaces. Mocking him is not how he had wanted them to overcome their differences. Herman, you idiot, he scolds himself. He gives Carol directions to his cabin and tells her to take the girls there. He'll be along in a minute. He just has to give the boys a few last pointers about practice. Then he turns on the spot and quickly walks back towards the field. It's almost funny how immediately their laughter stops. The grins freeze in place, then slide off their faces, and Coach Boone can almost hear their stomaches dropping into their shoes in fear at his approach. He's chewed his players up and spit them out for far less. Once he reaches his favorite shouting distance - right in front of them, so he can scream right into their faces... \"All right, listen up!\" he yells in his most dangerous voice, and he can see several boys swallow hard, their eyes wide above the black smears of paint. \"I'm gonna tell you all a little something that I hope you idiots will remember when you're men.\" Coach Boone stalks in front of them, getting a good look at their faces. He wants to make sure they each hear what he says next, because it's important. Hell, it's as important as the lesson that he's been trying to drill into them all summer - that they can't judge one another by the color of their skin. He raises one hand at points to the goalpost at the end of the field. \"It don't matter how many touchdowns you score, how many miles you run, how many pounds you bench-press.\" His voice is loud, but slow, letting the words sink in. \"It don't make you a man. It don't matter if you grow up, marry the prettiest girl at Williams High, and make a dozen babies.\" Some of the boys blush at this and lower their eyes, embarrassed to hear their coach talk about the facts of life like this. \"That don't make you a man, either,\" he goes on. \"Because any father who keeps his children at arm's length will never be a man.\" The boys who had been looking down raise their heads thoughtfully, and Coach Boone is sure that his words have found their mark. \"Now hit the showers,\" he orders over his shoulder, as he turns and walks with a smile on his face back to where Carol and girls are waiting.

I figured why not? Disclaimers/Warnings: No own. No harm intended. Not real. Wave It's your first day of physical therapy after the accident, your first day looking at the pool, and all you can think is it looks a lot like the torture devices you saw in your World History books at school. You know it's not, that it really is just a big ditch full of water. But right now? When you're sitting in your wheelchair and the therapist is smiling at you all innocent? It's so much more than it should be. Just staring into the water is making you tired. \"Get your butt in the water, Bertier,\" she calls out. A little too sadistically in your eyes. She sounds like Coach Boone, though, and it helps. You ease yourself to the edge of your chair as she jumps in. \"Good. Now just let yourself fall in.\" Fall in? You can do that. Right. Not as easy as it looks trying to make yourself trust that the water will somehow just be there. When you finally do it you realize she forgot to teach you how to float with no legs to buoy you. She catches you before you sink and proceeds to command you to swim. As if you were normal. Normal...After a half hour you're so damn exhausted you're literally hugging the ladder railings. She's congratulating you on a job well done, says you're doing better than anyone expected (you're a Titan, you know about going beyond expectation) and you're nodding without paying much attention. All you want is to be out of the water, dry, warm. Suddenly, arms scoop you up and carry you out, holding you close to a solid chest. It's embarrassing and comforting and when you see it's Julius, that it's him cradling you, you begin to cry for the first time since you've been in the hospital. \"I gotcha, Superman. It's okay. I'm here,\" he murmurs as you bury your face in his neck. \"Don't worry. I ain't lettin' go...\" You remember the therapist's words about letting yourself fall and think about the musky scent of Julius's neck. You get the sudden feeling falling will be happening a lot more in your future... Courage Before the semi-finals when Gerry was hurt you thought you knew what pain was. Football camp before the season? Suicides in 100 degree heat? Yeah, you figured you knew pain. And then he got side-swiped while you were with your girl and suddenly real pain made itself known. He feels that pain now. And every time you see him in that hospital bed you feel it too. But he smiles through it all as if he's made of steel. And in a lot of ways he is. That boy, you're pretty safe in saying, really is Superman... You see her walk up looking nervous, scared really, and you're frozen in place. Because despite her fear (hell, she broke up with him for not giving you up) her stride is determined. \"Julius Campbell?\" Her voice is a little hesitant but she's got spunk. It's easy to see why Gerry was so sweet on her. The refs are calling you. Coach is calling you. The game's about to start and you're needed on the field. \"Yeah,\" you say, ignoring everyone but her, \"I know who you are. We just ain't never been properly introduced.\" She blinks and takes a breath to gather her courage. \"I'm Emma Hoyt.\" Suddenly she sticks out her hand to shake. They keep calling, getting frantic now. You don't get out there and you make the team forfeit the game. You know that. It's just that she's doing this for Gerry. So you reach out and shake her hand gently, respectfully. \"There. Now we've met.\" She smiles now. You can't help thinking it doesn't take a genius to understand why she's here. It's the same reason you stayed, that makes you smile in return. For him you're willing to do most anything... Kryptonite It wasn't until you saw him there, sitting up, breathing, alive, that it hit you. You almost lost him. For good. Without him ever knowing, well, anything really. Your family. Your friends. You. you were still learning each other before the accident. Getting there. Wherever there was. And now? Everyone surrounding him, protecting him? All you want now is to take him in your arms and hold him until it all goes away. \"I won't break, ya know,\" he says softly when you sit gingerly on the edge of the bed. It's late and the others have gone home. You're all that's left. For some reason Gerry won't let you leave and you don't mind staying. He looks like he's in some pain when you shift to stand. \"I should go, Gerry.\" He grabs your hand as you turn, an undefined look in his eyes. \"It's late and even Superman needs his sleep.\" \"Julius?\" As broken as he is his grip is still iron-clad. \"Stay?\" \"I don't think the nurses'll like that too much.\" He blinks and smiles wearily. \"Please?\" You pull a chair up close to the bed and make yourself comfortable. \"Just so you know, I'ma need a couple of those pain pills tomorrow.\" You have to grin because there is no other option. Not for you. Not anymore. Symbiosis \"Emma's the kinda girl you can't help but love, man. Small, blonde, smart. Fun.\" \"So why isn't she here instead of me?\" Gerry rolls over in his bed to face the other boy laying beside him. \"Because...\" He hopes he won't have to answer, hopes being naked and sweaty in the afterglow explains everything. Julius quirks and eyebrow and grins. \"Because?\" He sighs, resigned. \"Because she isn't you.\" And that's the real reason right there. Gerry wouldn't, couldn't, give him up. Not even for her. He didn't understand why in the beginning but it's clear now. Especially when he runs a finger down Julius' muscular chest and feels the other youth shiver. Gerry wasn't a virgin before he and Emma started dating. Not that he'd had a lot of experience either, but enough to think he was satisfied. Then Julius came along and changed everything. With him it's his first time all over again. Julius's grin eases into a soft, private smile as they stare into each other's eyes, prompting him to say, \"Because we never had this.\" Beginning You wrestle. Which is no big thing to anybody else. But more and more whenever one of you ends up straddling the other you immediately get turned on. And even though you try to pass it off as being a teenage boy you get the feeling it's more than that. Something about the way his hands grip your wrists as he laughs in your face, the contrast of his skin when it flushes with exertion, his muscles visibly tightening in a show of strength. His body calls to you in a way your girl's doesn't. You don't have to be gentle with him or him with you. And yet when he helps you up off the ground his hand is soft, relaxed, and his smile is sweet. When he bumps helmets with you after practice there's no jarring in your head and neck from the impact. He is different with you and you can't explain why. But you like it in spite of yourself. Until one night when you're wrestling in his room after dinner and his mama calls up for you two to quit acting like little boys. You both giggle, leaning against each other, breathless. Suddenly his face is too close, his lips are against yours and the moment is so fine it makes you ache in a place deep inside. Without even realizing it your hand is on his neck to hold him in place while your mouth opens in a groan. When he whimpers in the back of his throat you think maybe this is what the wrestling has been leading up to, the fighting, the growing. Maybe this is what you were meant to have all along.

I am Lovemet123 and I am proud to present this new Lilo and Stitch Fanfic! This was a collaboration that I am extremely happy about. Co-Writers are Deathmetal180, Quanktumspirit, and IchBinAufKurs. Main Director is Deathmetal180. Check out those awesome writers that helped bring DeathMetal's story to life! We own the story, not the characters, except Sam, who is courtesy of me. Without further ado, please enjoy the special presentation of, \"A Change Of Hearts!\" Hehe, I remember this very was into Lilo and Stitch at the time, which he still is. He had an idea that he felt he couldn't do anything with and I was like, \"Let me see what I can do with this.\" Sure enough, we ended up with something and it felt good to put it down and we kept at it until we felt like we had a story that we could tell to the world. 5 years later, this thing needs to be fixed lol. I told everyone I would do it and now here is the proof. I hope you enjoy this revision and that it was worth the wait. Stitch slowly opened his emerald green eyes to a bright ray of sunshine hitting his face flinching as he feels the spot next to him only to find that it was absent of warmth. He sat upright and turned to see that he was the only one in the room, moving his hand into his short shaggy blue hair. He took note that he must have overslept after his coffee chug down the night before resulting in him being the last to wake. Curious as to where everyone else was, he swiftly jumps off the bed and made his trudge downstairs to the kitchen, hoping to find Angel or Lilo or both. \"Lilo? Boojiboo? Where are you?\" Stitch called out. As he traveled down the incline, the scent of coffee hit his nose and he moaned in anticipation of finding a pot to inhale through his mouth. Lilo hurriedly rushes into the kitchen and opens all of the cabinets and even the fridge door in an attempt to find something to eat and could only score with a banana, immediately peeling and eating it without much hesitation as she runs out of the room; apparently not registering Stitch's presence despite seeing him out of the corner of her eye. \"Oh! Sorry Stitch. I've got some big news to tell you, but I need to get some things together first.\" She calls from the laundry room, gathering some of the clothes she had washed and dried. He was perplexed by all the quick movement his human friend was doing this early in the morning and then turns to hear another sound. Footsteps. He knew someone was coming and knew who it was just by the scent. It was Nani, Lilo's older sister. Maybe she had some answers about her younger sibling's strange behavior. \"Nani, why is Lilo running?\" \"You didn't hear?\" Nani asks him as he shakes his head. \"Oh, that's right. You were out with Angel when Lilo found out she was accepted to a college.\" Nani said as she recalls Lilo's excitement during Stitch's absence. \"She's been accepted into California University and she waited for the last day to get everything situated.\" Nani adds as she shakes her head. \"She may be an adult now but she is still the same Lilo.\" It was at that moment that Stitch finally realized what that meant for him. \"Is Lilo going away?\" When no response was given Nani walks over to Stitch and placed her hand on him trying to comfort him. While the two didn't always see eye to eye on everything, Nani did understand how deep of a relationship the blue alien had with Lilo and knows how lonely Stitch would be when Lilo takes off, especially with the departure of Angel coming soon as she would have to take off for work outside of Earth. \"Hey, Stitch... She's all grown up. She needs to leave the nest and as much as it kills me - and it really does - I've to let her go so she can pursue her dreams. I can't keep her here. She wouldn't be happy here if I did. You understand right?\" She hugs Stitch. \"I know. It is a lot to take in.\" \"B-but I wanted time to prepare for this. I-I...LILO!\" Stitch shouts out to a hurrying Lilo who didn't look or sound like she was in the state of mind to talk as she puts her things together, which is made more evident by her reply. \"Can't talk now! Trying to pack my clothes in my suitcase! My flight leaves tonight at 8:45 P.M. sharp and I don't intend to miss it!\" She said as she rushed back out. \"But Lilo. What about me?\" Stitch questioned weakly and sadly. The young adult stops with what she was doing and runs down the flight of stairs to see Stitch there. Nani had released him moments ago and decided to leave the two alone. \"Stitch,\" she states as she kneels in front of him. \"I'm so sorry, I was so focused on today. I didn't mean to forget about you,\" She hugs him. \"But Mr. Bubbles did everything he could to help me find a college that could accept me, and you know how much I have wanted to pursue a chemical engineering career. Believe me, I wish it was closer to home, but it isn't.\" Stitch could not find any words he could cling on to that which would be able to express the emptiness he was feeling from the hug his best friend was giving to him. Best friend...what was in such a title that made someone feel good about themselves for being someone's favorite person, but failing to receive such important information in which they would be able to plan their last days with their friend accordingly? Such was a mystery that made him feel hollow as Lilo tightens her hug with him. \"You know I would never want to leave you. If there was another choice, I would choose it in an instant. Are you upset?\" Stitch sighed as he pulled away from a saddened. \"Lilo, how can I not be mad for you not telling me sooner.\" He answered honestly. \"I mean you would think that, if you were my best friend and knew you were going away for a long time, you would want to spend a little more time with me before you take off.\" \"Stitch,\" Lilo said sadly, \"we've spent these last few years together. They had given me something I thought I had lost - a family. And as a family, we don't ever forget each other; no matter what.\" \"I didn't mean to hurt you Stitch,\" she admitted, \"I never intended for it. I'm truly sorry.\" He held his stare at her, reading her sorrowful eyes and then added. \"Make sure you call at least once a week.\" \"Call, text, email, whatever you want. I'll do it all, Stitch. I wished all of this happened at a better time. That way, I could've at least had one more day with my best friend.\" she said as she wipes her tears. Lilo kneels down to Stitch's height and gently wraps her arms around his surprisingly small frame. He was a strong individual, which had been proven many times, but this would have been one of the few moments that had been powerful enough to make him crack slightly. Lilo dreaded the idea that if she held him any tighter, she would break him in two. Finally, she let him go \"I know, but as long as you don't forget about me, I'll be here for you when you get back,\" Stitch tells Lilo with a smile. \"How could I? Your Stitch, Experiment 626, the strongest out of all the experiments here in Hawaii, and my alien \"dog\". I would never forget you,\" she said as she laughs while breaks the hug. Lilo gets up and leaves to her room with Stitch following her and they both carried bags out to the beach buggy. They pile it and tied a rope around it. She turns and faces her unique and loving family. She hugs Jumba and Pleakley together as Pleakley blubbers while Jumba's eyes are watery. She waves to them as she goes to Nani and David and tightly hugs them. Nani kisses Lilo's head and they both hug her for what feels like quite a while. She finally breaks away from them and turns to Stitch, whose fur on his cheeks had been damp from the salty tears that had been cascading from his eyes. A lump began to form in her throat from seeing her best friend looking so shattered the way he was in front of her. The alien bit his lips and clenched his fists as he shook in his place; unable to move. \"Oh, it's — it's really going to be so hard to say goodbye to you, Stitch. I think I'll miss you most of all,\" she faced Stitch and noted how the pit in her stomach grew. Stitch felt the warmth from his heart lessen as a chill started to take it's place. She kneeled down and tightly embraced him as she caressed his back fur. She let her fingers grasped it, as if desperate to make sure Stitch knew how much she loves him. Stitch froze, as if his body was lifeless. He slowly moved his arms and reciprocated Lilo's hold, hoping the ache in his heart would stop. Stitch's voice cracked as the tears resumed falling, \"Bye, Lilo.\" \"Bye Stitch,\" she cried as she buried her face into his neck. They remained like that until Stitch releases Lilo and she stood up. Lilo waves to them all as she walked over to the car with Nani and David following her. Lilo starts the car and drove away while Jumba and Pleakley walked back to their rooms. Stitch stood alone by the house in the cold, torturous silence that was left behind in the clouded dust that was occupied by the human Earthling. The first human friend he had ever made. He pondered what was he going to down now since he was alone. He softly smiled as he snapped his fingers, \"I got an idea.\" He turned around and started walking towards the house with excitement, \"I'll go check to see if Boojiboo wants to-\" He paused as he remembered that the day before Angel left town to pursue her galactic music career. He collapsed onto the floor with tear-rimmed eyes, \"Oh...yeah. How could I have forgotten.\" His ears drooped to his waist and he listened to the cry of the wind that caught some of his tears. He closed his eyes and sniffled a bit before completely dropping his head low; puling to himself. \"6-2-6!\" Stitch looked up and sees Jumba running to him with a space cell, though his vision had been blurry from crying, \"6-2-4, is on line. Vanting to talk to you.\" He heaved, panting in his place from the amount of energy he used up to travel to his experiment. \"Evil genius needing more exercising.\" Stitch jumped onto his feet, swiftly snatched the space phone from Jumba's hand and brought it to his face. He eagerly spoke into the device while wiping his tears away to clear his vision, \"Angel?\" He sees another experiment on the receiver who looked almost like him but in pink and seemed a bit more effeminate. Her blue eyes traced over the image that was her boyfriend. \"Hey, Boojiboo! How is your day?\" she asked him as she was sitting in a space limo while it cruised over a planet. \"Naga bootifa. Lilo left for college, you are out singing, and I'm just...here.\" Stitch replied depressingly. \"Lilo left? Yuuga mean today was the day she goes to college?\" Angel asks as she looks at her watch, \"But isa too early. Isa only 6:00 pm.\" \"She wanted to make sure she got to the plane. She forgot to pack her things, again. Sometimes I don't understand her and the way she does things, but I guess it's ok,\" Stitch said, \"Still...I feel lonely.\" \"Well, I have some time we can talk about things. Is that okay with you?\" she asks him. Stitch's face lit up.\"Ih\" She laughs, \"Ih, of course. So gaba youga talk about?\" \"Well, how's your singing career going?\" Stitch offers thinking it was a good way to start the conversation. \"It's going great. I'm going to the Nova system next and then hopefully I'll be back on Earth soon afterward,\" she speaks honestly, \"Can't believe it has been months since I left Earth. I miss everyone so much, including you Stitch.\" \"Months? No, you left yesterday.\" Stitch told Angel. \"Oops,\" Angel chuckles at her mistake, \"Sorry. Every system has a different time zone on their planets and this one just happens to feel like it had been months since I left. It can get annoying at times, but the fans are always super supportive, so I felt that I needed to do it.\" She notices her manager approaching her and sighs. She covers the phone as he whispers in her ear, but Stitch could still hear some of the things being said. \"Really... Meega... Boojiboo... Home,\" Stitch only caught those words and then he sees her face on the screen again, but with a more sullen expression etched on her face. Catching the change, Stitch knew immediately that something was wrong on her end of the call. \"Soka... Meega manager just told meega that we've to attend a benefit concert in a galaxy so far away, not even the space cell will be able to get a good reception, so I won't be back anytime soon like I initially thought.\" her ears droop sadly. Stitch couldn't believe what he just heard. His girlfriend was moving further away from him in order to continue chasing her dream. He won't be able to reach her with the only form of contact that he has with her. That idea alone was enough to make Stitch panic internally, causing his stomach to go into knots. \"I have to go now. Bye, Stitch. Meega loves yuuga misa much,\" she speaks as she blows a kiss to him.\" \"...Oh...Ok...B-bye...boojiboo,\" Stitch said and closed the space phone, tears rushing down his face once more. The two people he loved most were gone. He knows it's only temporary and he still has friends on Earth; however, at this very moment, he has never felt more alone. If only there was something that he could do to change that. Jumba, who had heard the conversation, sympathized with Stitch feeling helpless to the issue. The giant alien creator thought of Stitch as a child of his own and it pained him to know that this wasn't something he could simply fix with the tools he worked with. He sat beside Stitch and placed his hands on his shoulders in an attempt to comfort Stitch. \"Stitch,\" Jumba called him and Stitch turns to him as Jumba knowingly stated, \"Evil genius knowing saying goodbye is no easy task, but you are strong with good heart. Just have hope that they'll come back and that should help lessen pain. Besides, you still have me, Pleakley, and your cousins here.\" He wiped Stitch's tears. \"Big Earth Girl Nani and Surfer Boy David here as well,\" Jumba commented. \"I barely even see my cousins, half of them are maniacs, the other half are too far to visit, Pleakley is still a noodle, and dinko te fabba.\" Stitch said, tears still coming down his face. Jumba huffs in an effort to disregard the insult the blue creature threw at him and added, \"What has Lilo told you about Ohana?\" \"Ohana means family, family means nobody gets left behind...or forgotten...but SHE LEFT ME!\" Stitch shouted as he broke down and threw himself at his creator. Jumba was caught off guard by the gesture and felt awkward about the exchange as he didn't feel that he was the best person to seek such solace from. However, he reluctantly allowed it and even placed one of his hands on top of Stitch's head. \"Because she had no other choice,\" Pleakley entered concern displayed on his face, \"Don't you think she's hurting inside just as much as you are or even more? Same with Angel. You just have to wait for them to come back. They will come back, you'll see.\" \"I don't why I feel like this, but I do. I have this horrible ache in my chest like my heart is about to fall apart,\" Stitch said sniffling. Pleakley explained kindly, \"You feel like that because the two closest people in your life are gone because Lilo, is your first friend and Angel is your first love. With them gone, you feel like you've got a void in your heart. I'm sure if anyone was in your place, they would feel the same pain you are going through.\" \"...What can I do...to be rid of the void?\" Stitch asked. \"Hope, pray and try not to think about it,\" Pleakley spoke, \"Do you really think that Lilo and Angel want you to be sad and mope around because I know they wouldn't approve of those actions.\" \"Maybe 6-2-6 can be lab assistant to Jumba? 6-2-6, wanting help Evil genius with new invention?\" Jumba asked him elatedly. Stitch thought about it for a few moments and then turned to Jumba and agreed. \"Ih, meega try.\" \"Good,\" Jumba stood up, \"then let's get going.\" Stitch and Pleakley got up and followed Jumba into the house, where Pleakley sectioned off to the kitchen. Stitch reluctantly continued on to the lab with Jumba to be his assistant for whatever Jumba has in mind. Things couldn't possibly get any worse than they are now.[Chapter 2] Renfurry chapter 1 . Sep 27 I'm confused, is this just a rewrite of the original A Change of Hearts? Like the one from over 2 years ago? Because I don't understand the point of that, why not just keep writing the sequel? I did this redux for a number of reasons, but mainly, I did it because this story was written years ago. When I read it again to try and get more ideas for the sequel, I felt that what was posted was terribly written and I noticed it had a lot of errors that needed to be fixed, especially when the way we wrote it back then is different from how we write now. This is a story I really care about and I will see to it that it is much better written. A week later... Stitch tried helping Jumba with his inventions, but he was so out of it that, on more than one occasion, he almost destroyed Jumba, himself, and the ship because of mixing the wrong chemicals together. Jumba thought it would be better if Stitch tagged along with Pleakley for a bit to try and relieve the stress he had been under since he said goodbye to Lilo and Angel. The blue alien decided to not test Jumba's patience any further than he already had and agreed, which led him to try out yoga in the living room with Pleakley. \"Now release all of the tension that has been building up inside of you,\" Pleakley speaks calmly as he stretches and Stitch copies him. They had been at it for thirty minutes, which was an impressive feat for someone like 6-2-6 to achieve considering the amount of patience it was demanding of him. However, Stitch found it difficult at times to keep up with the flexible ex-galactic agent turned friend. \"Let go of all of your burdens. Free your mind from those things that hurt you,\" Pleakley continues as Stitch slowly breathes the air in through his nose is and blows it out through his mouth. He became a bit wobbly while standing on one leg, despite doing his best to keep himself balanced. He wondered just how much more of himself needed to be exerted just to keep his posture still. \"Feel the negative energy leave you and being replaced with positive energy,\" he comments as his body moves into a warrior one pose. Putting one foot forward to keep his balance and arms as he could reach, Pleakley pulled his other two feet behind him to keep his posture still he stretched out his back. His yoga companion altered his movement to mirror the model being set for him and continued breathing slowly. Stitch was becoming more serene. \"Feel the good, positive energy coming into your being as you breathe in through the nose,\" Pleakley instructs as he breathes in which Stitch copied him, \"and all the bad, negative energy leaving your being as you breathe out of the mouth.\" He does so and Stitch mimics him. \"That's it,\" Pleakley smiles as he turns to Stitch, signaling the end of the session. \"So how do you feel?\" \"I still feel the same,\" Stitch said as he looks down at the ground. \"Thanks though. I know both you and Jumba as well as Nani and David did your best, but nothing seems to be working. Not one thing has made me feel any better,\" he adds with his ears drooping. Pleakley sighed to him, placing a hand on Stitch's shoulder. \"It's okay Little Blue Monster. It will all work out. You will see.\" Some time later, Nani found Stitch laying on the living room floor and felt a pang in her chest. She smiled as she had gotten another idea to help him, offering Stitch to be her assistant in the house. While in theory it was a good idea, the job was poorly done; since Stitch didn't pay attention to the stove and almost burnt down the house. This accident made him distance himself mentally from everyone, fearing he would destroy something else and would harm others in the process, even if he didn't mean to do it. Nani called David to see if he had any new ideas. He then suggested going to the beach. \"Stitch will go,\" Stitch says flatly, much to the surprise of his family. So David took him down to the beach, where Stitch can surf and build sand castles, but even this didn't seem to break through the feelings Stitch harbored inside. After the miserable time at the beach, he left without saying a word to David and walked back home. As he approaches his abode, his doopy ears perked up at a sound. Ring! Ring! Ring! Ring! He immediately hears the familiar sound and runs to the house, climbs the outside of it and into his room. He pounced on his bed and searched for the space cell, throwing pillows and blankets off of the mattress. Ring! Ring! Ring! Ring! \"Where did I put it?\" he asks himself as he looks around. Then he snapped his fingers and remembered, \"That's right, let me check the living room.\" So he rushes out of the messy bedroom and quickly climbs down the tube, and bolts to the living room. He rummages around the place in an effort to find the space cell. He looks into the couch and smiles as his fingers touch something. \"Ah ha! Here we go!\" he exclaims as he pulls the device and flips it open. He sees the familiar face appears on the screen waving happily and smiles, \"Boojiboo!\" \"Hi boojiboo!\" she responds back to Stitch, \"Sorry for not being able to stay in touch for a long time. My vacation had to be postponed because...\" She stops and Stitch was impatient, \"Because? Because what? Tell me?\" He sits on the couch as Angel thinks of how to say what was on her mind, \"I think it is best if you take a seat?\" \"Um... No, offense but I'm already sitting down,\" Stitch comments and both laugh. \"So seriously, what is it?\" he asks her. \"I was just accepted for a movie deal,\" Angel stated. Stitch congratulates her, \"You did! Wow! That's good. No, it's great! Awesome even! When you come back, we can throw you a party; maybe even invite Lilo and all of the Ohana. I bet they'll be happy to hear the news about you getting a part.\" Stitch ecstatically bounces up on the couch with a wide grin on his face. \"So...when do you go away to make the movie?\" She looks away as her ears droop and Stitch asks her, \"Angel? Angel, what is it?\" \"Just...\" she holds back a sad sigh, \"They want me to go Friday.\" \"What...\" Stitch's voice shrunk, almost inaudible, but repeated the statement much louder the second time. \"What? Wait... What? As in this Friday? This coming one?\" \"Yes. The producer asked my manager and they were talking, which soon turned into the beginning of a deal to then an already made deal,\" she explains as she sniffles, \"But...it is ultimately my choice.\" \"Then...when you come back we'll throw you a party,\" Stitch replies and Angel shakes her head, \"No. This is a one time offer and my manager is telling me to go for it.\" \"Then why not go for it?\" Stitch asks as he felt his heart sink further the longer this conversation went on. \"I know it'll help my career,\" she remarks, \"but at the same time I'll be further from you.\" \"Really?\" Stitch questions. \"Yeah, I've to go to a distant planet that requires two Hyperdrives and I'm going to be there for 6 years to record the movie,\" Angel adds with a sob. \"But... You were supposed to be back here,\" Stitch said sadly, \"You said you'd be back and we could be together.\" \"Don't you think I know that!\" Angel cries, \"I know what I said. Stitch, I fully trust you. What do you think I should do?\" \"I...I don't know, I'm still in shock over everything. Um… g-give me a few minutes,\" Stitch says as Angel nodded. 'I...I don't want her to go away because I'll miss her too much, but... I shouldn't keep her either just because I'm selfish. If she goes though, I'll be crushed... No, devastated. But, if I make her her stay; she'll be sad and miserable and may even resent me. ...I need help,' Stitch thinks deeply as he leaves the room. \"Nani! Nani, where are you! I need help!\" Stitch calls out as he hears Nani rushing to him. She replies while panting, \"Yes, Stitch! What is it!?\" He walks out of the living room and finds her coming through the backdoor of the kitchen, \"What? What do you need? What happened?\" She quickly, but carefully sets the food on the table and walks over to Stitch. She examines him and places her hand on his forehead, \"Are you okay?\" \"Nani... I need help with a decision,\" he admits as he averts his eyes onto the floor.. Nani nods as she retracts her hand, \"Oh good then.\" She adds as she stands back up, \"Okay...What is it?\" \"Angel has been offered a spot in a movie,\" he begins and Nani smiles, \"Oh really, good for her!\" Stitch softly smiles, \"I know right.\" The smile fades into a frown as his eyes look up to Nani. \"But...if she accepts it, she'll have to go this Friday, which is three days away, and stay on the planet for a long time; however, if she doesn't, she'll be back here and that might not be good for her down the road.\" Nani pulls up a chair as she listens to Stitch's query \"She asked for my opinion on the predicament and I don't know what to tell her. Nani, what should I do?\" \"Stitch... I think it is best if you think about it real hard,\" Nani offers with a wise and knowing smile. \"That doesn't help,\" Stitch retorts with a sigh. \"Stitch, I can't make the choice for you. You have to do it yourself,\" Nani offers with a small smile, \"In the end, only you can decide what you think is best. I can't force you to choose.\" \"Oh, fine. I get it,\" Stitch says disappointingly as he walks back to the living room and speaks on the cell. Both him and Angel say in unison, \"Hey, I've something to tell you.\" Both lightly laugh and Angel speaks, \"You go first, Stitch.\" \"Okay,\" Stitch sighs, \"I-I think it is best if you take the deal.\" \"Oh...\" Angel comments and Stitch asks confused, \"What?\" \"Well... I-I just thought... I was leaning not to taking the deal,\" Angel confesses as she looks down and away from Stitch. \"Really, why?\" Stitch asks her surprised. \"Because... I don't want to leave you. I don't think I can do it,\" she admits as she returns her gaze at Stitch. \"Angel...this is a great opportunity for you. You should take it. It will help you in the long run and if you don't take this chance, you'll regret it for the rest of your life. Come on Angel, do it. It's the right thing,\" Stitch counters with a sad smile. \"Yeah...but there are other deals I can make out there that are closer to where you are. I can wait, really. I just want to be close to you,\" she comments. \"No Angel, you've got to take the deal. You have to do it. Think about how many people have actually been given the opportunity to go somewhere they have never been before.\" Stitch insists.. \"Yeah, but boojiboo... What about us?\" she asks him. \"Well...there is still an 'us' now with our current long distance relationship. I think we'd be okay with a longer distance,\" he explains to her as he softly chuckles. \"I suppose so...Do you really think we can make that work?\" she asks him concernedly. \"Ih, nothing is too far away. We can send hologram messages to one another,\" Stitch answers happily, \"Boojiboo... It's going to be okay. Everything is going to okay.\" \"Ih, of course. Yeah, you're right,\" she nods with a smile. Stitch asks her, \"When you get there, will you call me?\" Angel answers with a big smile, \"Yeah. Bye boojiboo.\" She blows him a kiss as he blows one back to her, \"Bye.\" He closes the space cell and sighs as he looks around the messy living room. He begins cleaning the clutter he made as he loses himself in deep thought. Friday Evening... Stitch was holding the cell intently in his paws. He brought it everywhere with him, like EVERYWHERE with him. Just waiting for the ringing to happen. He stares at it on the hammock begging, \"Come on and ring. Ring now. How about you ring now?\" The machine stays quiet through the starry night. The still slick design and shiny red coat of paint made it look like he had gotten it new; however, he had always had this object. He noted the slight wear on the machine, but knew of its importance. Yet, the one job it was made to do wasn't happening and it was trying on Stitch's diminishing patience. \"I'm gonna count to five and if you don't ring,\" Stitch threatens the machinery. \"1…. 2… 3… 4…...,\" Stitch pauses as he looks at the item. The space cell seemed to be mocking its owner for the empty threats being sent its way. Stitch growled in frustration at the phone's refusal to heed the warnings. \"Don't make me say it,\" he speaks seriously,\" or so help me I'll end you.\" His frustration died down into sadness and his ears drooped again with a sigh releasing from his mouth, setting the object aside from his view. He knew he was only talking to an emotionless piece of equipment and felt more like an idiot for thinking that threats would suddenly cause it to become obedient. The loneliness he felt from the realization made his heart ache in sorrow, thinking that he might never hear from Angel again. Just when he was about to lose hope on getting the call. Ring! Ring! Ring! Ring! He jumps jovially and tries to connect, \"Come on, come on. Connect already!\" He sees his beautiful girlfriend on the screen and speaks excitedly, \"Hi boojiboo! Oh, I missed you so much.\" \"I miss you too,\" Angel comments happily, \"And sorry... The producer had so many problems and everything. That is why I couldn't call you before.\" Stitch smiles, \"It's okay, it's okay. I know, I get it. I'm just happy to be talking to you now. So how is it?\" \"Stormy,\" she states with a nervous laugh, \"Really stormy here.\" \"Just be careful,\" Stitch comments worryingly. \"Yeah, I will I'm worried that the storm might-\" Angel's picture froze and Stitch knew what just happened. He angrily sighs as he falls back onto the hammock. They lost connection because of the storm. He sits back up and tries to beat the device to make it work. He did everything he could to see if he could get a better signal, even as far as going on top of the house and pointing the cell to the sky. However, all of his attempts were futile. Midnight... \"How is long distance relationship working out?\" Jumba asks as he sees Stitch slumping on the couch. \"Not good. Not good at all. We both have different schedules and not to mention she has a storm on her end... We barely got to talk,\" Stitch admits while clenching onto the space cell. He jumps up off the couch, \"I know it has only been a couple of days, but I miss her so much. I just wish I could see her, just one more time.\" He paces as he looks at the phone while Jumba took note of the damages done to the phone. Shaking his head, Jumba turned away from Stitch. '6-2-6 having first world problems.' The big alien man thought to himself as he left the living room. He believed it was best to give Stitch some alone time. Ring! Ring! Ring! Ring! He immediately answers it, \"Hello?\" \"Boojiboo! Sorry I lost you for a moment,\" Angel explains. \"It's okay, we can at least talk to each other. Right boojiboo?\" Stitch asks her. \"Yeah...for only 5-7 minutes,\" Angel answers with a nervous chuckle. \"What?\" Stitch asks shocked about Angel's statement. \"Yeah... We still have to do certain movies scenes that can only be achieved with what we have,\" Angel comments annoyed. Stitch starts to tear up, \"Great... Just great, now I've to wait until you're on break to see you again?\" Angel turns her head and Stitch knows she is talking, but can't hear her say anything. He concludes that she must've muted herself and just waited for her to speak up again. \"Oh...I-I can't. The producer doesn't want any other electronic equipment running while we're recording the scenes,\" Angel speaks as her eyes start to water. \"Wait... So, we've only a few minutes now to talk to each other?\" Stitch comments hurt \"Angel... What are we going to do?\" \"I-I don't know. I didn't know it would be this hard,\" she admits to him. \"Yeah, same for me. I didn't think it would be this hard either,\" Stitch confesses to her. \"Stitch... I... I can't spend all of that time without thinking about you. I'll make myself crazy,\" she lightly sobs. \"I know how you feel Angel. I feel the same,\" Stitch replies as he fights back the tears. He looks down as he inhales and then back at the screen, \"Angel... Boojiboo, what do we do? What do we do now?\" Angel responses as she tries not to cry, \"Well... There's nothing we can really do except... except...I don't want to say. I-I can't say it.\" Stitch replies sadly, \"Yeah... I-I can't say it either. I don't ever want to say it.\" Stitch and Angel both look down as Stitch speaks, \"I love you... I love you so much.\" Angel cries, feeling her heart break in two, \"Oh...Boojiboo... I-I love you too.\" Tears escape her obsidian eyes and roll off her pink furred face as she sends him kisses and he sends a few to her. He struggles to keep his composure, but seeing how hurt Angel was just makes the pain in his chest more evident. The pressure of the pain was building and he did everything he could to keep it under control. Angel's voice cracks, \"I-I'm going to miss you so much. I really, really am.\" Stitch suppresses a sob, \"I'm going to miss you a lot as well.\" \"I-I don't want to say goodbye to you Stitch,\" Angel states with more tears cascading down her face, \"It is really hard for me to do.\" \"I don't want to say goodbye either,\" Stitch speaks as he gulps. He struggles to continue feeling a knot in his throat,, \"So...how about instead of that, we say hello. I-I think I can do that, how about you?\" \"Yeah...I think it would be easier than saying goodbye,\" Angel states as she looks at Stitch with a sad smile and tears glistening, \"Hello, Stitch.\" Stitch sadly waves, \"Hi, Angel.\" Both send kisses as Angel ends the call and Stitch numbly leaves. He walks pass Jumba, who could only watch in sympathy, as he climbs up the tube and goes into his room to try to sleep; even though, he knew he wasn't going to get any sleep tonight. Up in Deep Space... Unbeknownst to anyone on Earth, in the deep reaches of space beyond the Milky Way star system; commotion was running amuck in a gigantic spaceship. The ship teetered back and forth followed by the sounds of many booming explosions. The echoes rocked the ship and the lights flickered at various points as voices were shouted in apprehension during the chaotic event that went underway for those stuck in its crosshairs. The guards on the ship were unprepared for the fugitive that roamed the darken ship. \"Stop him!\" The Grand Councilwoman shouts. Guards left and right tried to surround the fugitive, but the figure slipped through their line of sight each time with unbelievable ease. \"He's moving too fast,\" One exclaims as the being outmaneuver the guards. Then, one by one, guards were \"disappearing\" off the screens. She asks while watching the different monitors, \"Locate him and contain him! We can't afford to lose him!\" One guard replies, \"We're trying ma'am, but... He's movements are even more unpredictable than 6-2-6 himself.\" \"I don't want excuses! I want results!\" She yells through the intercom. Suddenly. the power cuts off completely and the screens and communications went dead. She falls back onto her chair and massages her forehead, 'Not again...' \"Damn, How do we stop this thing?\" One guard asks in the door. \"Hey, I saw it go that way,\" Another guard pointed. When the others left, the guard that pointed them in the direction looks to see if anybody was watching. When no one was around, he looked up and says with a smile. \"Alright, coast is clear. You can come out, now.\" The banging of a vent echo until there was a loud Clang! The fugitive jumps from the vent and lands beside the guard. The being looks at the guard resembling to be an exact duplicate of Stitch with rougher red fur, his canine fangs sticking out of his closed mouth, frilly ears with light purple inside, a seemingly small haircut with spiked tips, and wearing a black prison jumpsuit. \"You know, you are much more different than they make you out to be,\" The guard speaks as he helps Leroy to the garage, \"I'll stall them long enough for you to get out without being noticed. Be careful out there, Leroy.\" \"I'm gonna miss you,\" The guard tells him. Leroy turns to the guard and speaks, \"Thank you, Sam. Thanks for everything you're doing. I do appreciate it, but aren't you worried about the consequences?\" Sam shakes his head in dismissal of the idea, \"Of course I'm not worry about that.\" He smiles and presses the button to open the garage. They found a ship and both look to each other. \"I guess this is goodbye,\" Leroy speaks as he enters the ship, \"Goodbye Sam.\" The door of the ship begins to close as they wave to each other. \"Hope I get to see you again someday,\" Leroy calls out. \"Don't worry...\" Sam states back. \"...I'm sure you will.\" The door closes and Leroy starts the launch sequence. Sam sees the guards and rushes towards to them. When he reaches the group, one points to him and says. \"Have you seen the fugitive?\" \"No,\" Sam replies as he prays Leroy departs soon. The leader of the group suggests, \"We should probably do a second sweep here.\" \"Aye!\" the other four guards; excluding Sam, cheer in unison. They seperate amd search the area as best as they could with their limited resources. The guards look around the place bewildered as to where the prisoner was. All of a sudden, a rumble shook the ship. \"One of the space crafts!\" One of the guards yells. They start running towards the sound, but by the time they arrive; it was too late. Leroy and the ship were gone and Sam stood there, watching the ship leave the premises with the other guards. \"Well, what do we do, now?\" asked another guard. \"We wait for the Grand Councilwoman's command. Until then, we will have to hope and pray that he doesn't land in an area filled with life forms or total destruction will rise on that planet,\" Sam states seriously as the guards leave the room. \"We've to first repair the power so we can relay the information to the Grand Councilwoman,\" another speaks as he walks off to the power main frame. In a matter of minutes, the lights and communications were back on and the Grand Councilwoman pages them. \"So what happened? Where is the fugitive?\" \"He got away, ma'am. What do you want us to do?\" asked one of the guards, as if they didn't already know what it was. \"Sam, since you were his keeper here on the ship, you will track down the fugitive and bring him back here. The rest of you will stay here and make sure everyone on the ship is safe. Is that understood?\" The Grand Councilwoman ordered. \"Yes ma'am,\" they all chorus together and she nods to them. The transmission ended and the guards scatter to do their jobs. \"Good luck, Sam,\" One hollers at him. \"Be careful, Sam,\" Another one shouts. \"Will do,\" Sam replies as he opens the door to the police spaceship he was about to take, but stop for a minute to think about what he was about to do. If he takes the police car and Leroy notices it; either he will get scare and run away or throw something at him to keep him from landing. So basically a police chase or death, and he was not in the mood for either of those; especially, since not only does he get to see his friend again, this could also be a chance to show the Galactic Alliance that Leroy is not a bad experiment. Instead, he was mistaken as one, and a police chase or death would hinder rather than help the cause. \"Although,\" Sam speaks as he gazes around, \"If he took a regular spaceship… Maybe I should follow suit.\" His eyes land on a nice decently size craft and smiles as he decides to ride in the ship. He quickly walks over to it and starts the ship. Before Leroy left, Sam places a tracking device in the ship, unbeknownst to Leroy, as a way to easily find him. He activates the tracker and reads it as a smile forms on his face. He sees the red dot showing on the map as it travels to a planet. The same planet in which fugitive 6-2-6, now known as Stitch, had escaped to, Earth. Sam pulls on the leverage and launches the ship out of the garage. 'Hang on, Leroy,' Sam thinks to himself, 'You're about to have your wish come true because I'm on my way to you.' He pushes the button and the spaceship speeds away in the pursuit of Leroy.[Chapter 3] Hello people, everywhere! I am Lovemet123 and I am proud to present this new Lilo and Stitch Fanfic! This was acolab that I am extremely happy about. Co-Writers are Deathmetal180, Quanktumspirit, and IchBinAufKurs. Main Director is Deathmetal180. Check out those awesome writers that helped bring DeathMetal's story to life! We own the story, not the characters, except Sam, who is courtesy of me. Without further ado, Behold! Ch. 3 of, \"A Change Of Hearts!\" (Crowd Goes Wild) It has been a while since Lilo and Angel left. Stitch couldn't stand it. He felt like he was going crazy. The power went out at some point, but luckily for Stitch, his cousin and best friend, Experiment 221 or 'Sparky', heard about Stitch's depression and decided to come over and stay for a few weeks to keep Stitch company and fix the electricity. Despite the fact that they live very far from each other, they are very close, considering that Sparky was the first \"cousin\" Stitch met. \"I don't know what to do, Sparky. I miss them so much.\" Stitch told Sparky, sighing as he rested his head on his hands. The two were sitting on the window sill with a small orange spongy mattress that rested atop the sill, decorated with colorful, vibrant pillows. The sunlight of the afternoon drapes itself over their shoulders and made the two glow a little bright than the other objects in the room. The electric experiment places a hand on Stitch's shoulder, his blue eyes locking on to Stitch's face. \"I'm sorry. I've never been in that situation. Hey, why don't you and I go to the mall. Do some shopping, get our hair done, make fun of women with bad hairdos...or should I say hair don'ts.\" Sparky suggested, running his hand through his small pompadour hairstyle he had grown out. Throughout the years, Sparky had grown to be very feminine attitude wise and all of the things he listed were hobbies he only did with Stitch. One activity that he enjoys doing with Stitch is taking different combinations of clothes and throwing them on himself and Stitch to hopefully create a look silly enough to make the two of them laugh. He wasn't ignorant in fashion however and would simultaneously make an attempt to find a style that he believes he could fit best and such was the case with the outfit that adorned him today. A simple, comfortable baby blue hoodie that complimented his yellow fur color, blue jean shorts that hung around the top of the knee, and red leather heels that covered his ankles. \"As tempting as that sounds, I'm not in the mood to shop, get my hair fixed, or make fun of bitches with those nasty messes the call hairdos...and they are most definitely hair don'ts,\" Stitch smirked at the last thing he said. Sparky laughed at that, though it made him sad that Stitch declined the mall, which was usually a hilarious time for the both of them. It would have even made Stitch happy for just a few hours; forgetting about his current dilemma. Seeing Stitch this down made Sparky feel glum too. Imagining if he didn't have Stitch now made his heartache a little. \"I guess that is fine too,\" He noted, \"I just don't want you to drown yourself in misery. Your happiness is very important to me and I want to do the best I can to help you feel better. It is the least I could do after all the times you have saved me.\" Sparky's lost his train of thought as his ears perked up. Then, out of the corner of his eye, Sparky saw a spaceship coming down from the sky. Most of it was engulfed in fire as it approached closer and closer. \"What is that?\" Sparky pointed at which Stitch looked and noticed the ship before it crashed. Stitch looked to Sparky, \"I think we should check out that area.\" \"Yass cuz,\" Sparky agreed as they left the house and headed towards the downed ship. Deep in the Woods... Once they arrive at the crashed ship, they saw it in a crater. The ship was laying right in front of them, battered and broken. Sparks lit from the broken cords of the exhaust tank. Smoke billowed from the damaged ship while it still burned. Stitch threw dirt onto the ship to take care of the fire while Sparky looked on fearful. Once the fire was put out, Stitch and Sparky ventured closer to the ship. \"Stitch, I'm scared. What if a monster comes out?\" Stitch looked at Sparky, wishing Sparky already knew the answer to that. \"...Sparky...I have super strength and you control ziz-ziz. We'll be fine,\" Stitch turned back and saw something run by. Stitch questioned, \"Did you see that?\" Sparky nodded and they went over to it and gasped at what they saw before them. \"Leroy?\" Stitch said, seeing an unconscious Leroy laying there. \"Should we call the Galactic Police?\" Sparky asked. Stitch stared at the unconscious Leroy. He looked so peaceful when he's unconscious and not trying to kill or steal any cousins. \"...No, don't call them. He's a wanted fugitive, so I'm assuming someone is already on their way. Besides, there's something telling me that Leroy is...different,\" Stitch said as he motioned Sparky to help pick Leroy up and drag him to a safe place. After ten minutes... Leroy struggled, tossed and turned while he grumbled in his sleep. \"Sam!\" Leroy yelled as he woke from his deep slumber. The dim light pierced his eyes as he opened them. He felt cool, fresh air on his heated fur, which made him want to look around at his surroundings, but said black eyes could barely see. \"What happened?\" he asked himself, \"Where am I? \"Oh, good. You're awake.\" a voice greeted. Leroy turned to the hall and saw the outline of his look-alike standing there. \"Stitch?\" Leroy asked in confusion. A few more minutes passed in silence, until Leroy steadily regained his sight. Finally, he could recognize the blurred silhouette, which made him curse mentally. \"Hey, Leroy. Trying to escape prison?\" Leroy was processing the appearance of his twin when he heard another voice and jumped up in the bed on all fours, growling. \"The hell?!\" Leroy shouted, confused by the voice and turned around to the experiment from the lighthouse, albeit with a much more forward appearance than he last remembered. \"2-2-1?\" \"The name is Sparky! Get it right,\" Sparky corrected Leroy. \"Sparky?\" Leroy pondered. The electric cousin giggled at the sight of watching his enemy getting scared by those that he had previously faced off. Sparky rose from his seat and made his way over to Stitch, click-clack his heels echoed as he walked and finally stood beside his best friend with arms crossed. The two of them stare at Leroy as the latter struggled to analyze the situation in front of him. \"Sparky? Stitch? What happened?\" his mind added. Leroy felt a paw touching his shoulder to push him back to lying down again. \"Don't move, you're still recovering. Just relax,\" Stitch said and sat back down in his chair, which was placed near the bed Leroy was on. Sparky left the room, believing that Stitch would be better at tackling this. Leroy sighed and looked around himself. He noted it was past nightfall and that the source of the dim light was small, almost barely noticeable. A few white candles in the room lit the area. \"Hmm… where are we?\" he snorted, although he knew exactly where they were. \"My room,\" Stitch admitted honestly, \"You'd better rest.\" \"Why am I here?\" Leroy finally calmly asked them. \"Because you're not lying on the ground during this storm,\" Stitch chuckled, \"Or do you prefer the ground? We can arrange that, you are in my bed after all.\" '…Why am I so tense? So...nervous?' Leroy thought. \"What about your family?\" he asked Stitch. \"Don't worry. We're in my room in the Bed-And-Not-Breakfast,\" Stitch stated. The rest of the night passed in silence. With Leroy's wounds severe as they are, had him in a light drowse; however, severe enough for Stitch to decide that 6-2-9 would not be leaving anytime soon. He allowed himself to close his eyes and catch up on his well deserved sleep after his weeks of hell. Leroyon the other hand was perplexed about the whole situation, while constantly sighing angrily and growling a lot, but half an hour or so had passed and Leroy found his own actions annoying, as well as unsuccessful. One last sigh was let loose, as his gaze at the ceiling and he closed his eyes, feeling the overpowering exhaustion. L123: So, what do you think of the story so far? Read and Review.

Leroy, it's time to wake up!\" a voice yelled, pulling the dark red-furred experiment from his – oh, so desired – sleep. 'Huh?', he thought to himself while opening his eyes. A frown, accompanied by big eyes with emerald green pupils and blue shades of fur stood a tad too close to his face. \"Stitch... what do you want?\" he asked tiredly. \"I brought you some food,\" Stitch answered and placed a plastic tray on the nightstand. \"Aren't you grateful? At least a little bit?\" 'Oh... so he isn't planning to starve me to death. Terrific...he probably would want me to pay him back if I accepted it,' Leroy thought inwardly. \"Like I need it...\" Leroy slightly mumbles angrily, \"I don't need to eat. I'm an experiment and we can survive on the scarcest of things.\" \"Yeah, but your recovering so you need to eat to get your strength back. Right?\" Stitch pointed out as Leroy turns his head to the side, \"Hmph.\" \"Just take the food,\" Stitch gives him the tray. \"I'm not hungry,\" Leroy counters. However the moment was broken up by the faint growling of Leroy's stomach. The small, embarrassing countering of his claim made Leroy blush, despite the red fur keeping it from being visible. \"Do you think I'm an idiot?! I know you are. Now eat up so you can heal quickly!\" Stitch exclaims, sitting on the chair next to the bed, crossing his arms in front of his chest. \"And what do you care if I'm healed or not?!\" Leroy's eyes shimmered, an unusual feeling welling up inside him. What did he care, anyway? They were rivals, weren't they? So Stitch could have used this chance to dispose of his opponent... Or called the Grand Councilwoman and Leroy could've been on a trip back to the asteroid prison. But he didn't. Why? Why didn't he do it? There has to be reason. Does he want something from his supposed twin? Does he expect Leroy to pay him a favor? Stitch remains adamant, \"Just take the damn food, please.\" Leroy had to bite his tongue and hold his pride like a mad dog. \"Listen... I don't want you to die, I've got enough problems as it is,\" Stitch finally admits out loud. Leroy lost his words for a few seconds, not sure how to respond. His mind replayed the words in his head. 'I don't want you to die,' his heart thumped a bit harder as the words echoed in his head. Regaining once again the ability to speak, Leroy frowned again. \"Fine. Whatever,\" he murmured, looking in the opposite direction. Not really sure why, he felt the urge to avoid Stitch's eyes at the moment. Leroy sat up, wincing from the pain. His fur burned and slightly charred, making him hiss. Sure enough, he noticed that his whole body was severely damaged. He inspected his arms that were bandaged from the tips of his fingers to his elbows and probably bared the worst marks from the landing. Leroy had tried to protect himself from the unexpected crash landing and the speed of the ship seemingly abandoned him...Like he was flung out of the ship. The sensitive, swollen skin on his back protested when he tried to nudge to the side. 'How... how did I get myself in this predicament anyway?!' Leroy sighs and took a glance at Stitch, startled to find out that the experiment was also watching him. Almost like he was waiting for him to do something, anything. Stitch had observed Leroy sitting up and examining his fingers, feeling a slight hint of guilt. \"Whadda you want?\" Leroy snorted. Stitch didn't respond, simply placed the tray on top of the fuming Leroy's lap - a bowl of soup, two slices of toasted bread, a cup with what seemed to be tea, it had some honey in it and some coconut cake. With an eyebrow lifted, Leroy turns to Stitch with a questioning glare. \"What are you looking at me like that for? There's some honey in it, it'll warm you up... Go ahead. Eat. Eat away,\" Stitch speaks and made a slight nudge to the right, shifting his gaze. Leroy sat silent for a moment, after which he chose to proclaim further arguments as useless. Nodding to himself, he took the spoon in his right paw and started eating. A couple of minutes later, the bowl was empty and the only thing left from the bread and cake were some crumbs on the tray and all over the covers. Leroy finished the tea and drained it in one gulp, a muted \"Aah\" escaping his mouth as the smooth surface parted with his lips. \"See? I told you that you were hungry! Mama knows and Mama tried.\" Stitch said triumphantly, then went into deep thought. 'Maybe I can find something in Jumba's ship? Ointment, First aid kit or...' A rustling sound broke his train of thought as he snapped back towards Leroy's spot as his eyes widened. Leroy growled at himself as he forced himself onto one knee. \"What the hell are you doing?\" Stitch shouted as Leroy stood up shakily on his legs, tearing him further away from his thoughts. \"Leaving. Like hell I'm staying here!\" Leroy yelled in response. An angry scowl was placed upon his face, sharpening his features. Stitch shook his head and stood up, pushing him back to the bed. With the air kicked out from his lungs, Leroy gasped and wincing from the impact – his burned skin screeched furiously. \"STITCH, I NEVER ASKED FOR YOUR HELP! I CAN HANDLE MYSELF! I DON'T NEED YOU!\" \"I DON'T care. You're getting it anyway!\" Stitch replied as calmly as he could. \"I know you ran away from the prison! Like hell that wasn't predictable. But take a moment and look at yourself right now. You can barely go anywhere! Just look at what happened. You lost the air from your lungs not that long ago! If you still insist on trying to leave this bed, I'm going after you and then drag your sorry ass back here again and again until you heal completely! Do you understand how injured you are!\" Stitch explained while Leroy glared daggers at his nemesis, fuming mentally. Growling silently in his throat, Leroy snorted. \"Asshole...\" he sighed, feeling frustrated for the first time after escaping his hell. \"You are lucky I still care enough to want you to get better. I would have pounded the living daylights outta you if I didn't.\" \"What is there to do around here anyway?\" he asked in a calm tone after several minutes passed. \"Until you get better, the only thing you can do is shut up and rest,\" Stitch said sternly, \"It is far too dangerous for you to be walking in the condition you're in.\" \"Stitch... I'm part wild beast, I need my freedom. You can't keep me cooped up in here. You should know that feeling. It's still inside you! The part that wants to break and destroy, you know I'm right,\" Leroy shouted as he snarled at Stitch. \"Yes, I know because I feel like that sometimes, but right now, your life is more important than your freedom. I also know that you can suppress that feeling at anytime, because that's what I'm doing right now, so stop whining, \" Stitch replied. \"I'm not whining,\" Leroy protested, \"Just expressing myself.\" \"There are many ways to express yourself, that's one of the ways. It's called whining,\" Stitch argued. \"You can't keep me here,\" Leroy grumbled, \"I'll get out one way or another.\" \"Why?\" both turn and spotted Sparky at the door frame. \"Why are you so insisted of leaving?\" Sparky asked him. Leroy looked at Sparky like he's ready to pound him for asking a question he had already established an answer to. \"Leroy, even if you did leave here, where are you going to go? You have no transportation, and no home to go to and certainly no one who will take you in,\" Stitch asked. Leroy thought for a moment. He hated to admit it, but Stitch was right. The only time he paid attention to the places he was going to was the time he captured all the experiment in different areas. Other than that, he vaguely remembers where he went. Even if he has some recollection of the places; no one would accept him. Not after all the hell he and his clones caused the last time he came around. The red creature gritted his teeth in silence, an emotional pool of sadness making knots in his throat. Nobody could ever love a little twisted red devil; a monstrous creation like himself. 'I'm a monster... I'm bad, evil, malicious... Evil...heh. That's not even half of it. ...For as long as I can remember, I've lived my entire life in darkness. Darkness. Isolation. They can't even imagine the hell I've been through. I know how my life is going to be. Full of loneliness. I don't need love... Love is an emotion. Emotions make you weak. But why then do I...' Leroy thought as he broke into tears. The drops cascading down his face as he looked away from Sparky and Stitch. \"Leroy!\" Stitch called as Leroy changed his demeanor; quickly curled himself up as he cried. Stitch looked at Leroy with high interest. 'Man...Leroy...he's much more of a human than I remember. Maybe he is more than I realized.' While Stitch was looking at Leroy, Leroy looked back at Stitch and Sparky, and finally made Sparky his main focus. Suddenly a devilish plan formed in Leroy's head, 'Hm...This could be my ticket.' All he had to do was win the trust from Sparky, then maybe, his cousins. \"Hey yellow thunderbolt, what is your name?\" Leroy asked while looking at Sparky as he wiped his tears. Sparky snapped his head away from Leroy, crossing his arms over his chest. He had noted the wounds on Leroy's body earlier on and admitted to himself that he must be strong as ever. However, he was not willing to bring himself to allow any sort of meaningful conversation between himself and the Stitch look-a-like. \"Hmph, how dare you describe me in such a derogatory way. You, as intelligent as you are, should know the difference between thunderbolt and electricity since thunder does not cause electricity to move. Second, we already established what my name was minutes ago. You must have hit your head harder then we initially thought if you can't remember my name, though with you be the ever so famed 629, I can't expect you to care that much to remember it.\" \"Sparky, calm down. You can't expect him to learn your name overnight,\" Stitch reasoned as Leroy glanced down at the ground feeling, sorrowful. He muttered, \"Sorry.\" In comparison, Stitch looked over at Leroy carefully and he must admit that Leroy was one hell of a looker, after all Leroy was based on his own design; however, he was annoyed that Leroy was much nicer to Sparky than himself. Sparky noted the same look in Leroy's eyes. A deep pain of betrayal to Stitch and Lilo streamed into his being. In fact, the whole Ohana thing felt like a betrayal. Nobody visited each other because everyone's different jobs on the island kept them enormously occupied. Never once apart from the one group photo did they ever get to spend some quality time together. Still, he wasn't too keen on the idea of offering Leroy a spot in group that is his happy family \"So, are you just another one of those Leroy clones or did the coward incarnate finally decide to toughen up and show himself?\" Sparky asked him questioningly. \"Sparky,\" Stitch snapped. \"Actually, I'm the original Leroy,\" Leroy commented, \"the only one out of 50,000 to be honest.\" Silence hung around them as Sparky and Stitch looked at Leroy. Leroy sighed as he looked at them. \"Anyway, I just would like to know...what do you think of this whole Earth-Ohana thing?\" Leroy asked out loud. Before Stitch could give a reply, Sparky interjected, \"How would you even know about that?!\" Sparky gritted his teeth, sparks coming from his antenne. This sudden burst of emotion caused Leroy to jump a bit. Was this a taboo topic that was not allow be talked about? It seemed like an honest question to him. Stitch jumped in front of Leroy and raised his arms out, \"Sparks, calm down. Leroy was only asking a question. You don't need to try and electrocute his head off.\" \"Asking that sort of question is the least of his problems,\" Sparky suggested. \"You can't tell me that he tried to destroy us all and then come to this to planet to ask about family because he is curious. Villains don't work that way, Stitch.\" \"We can't just turn our back on him when he is asking about something we have knowledge about.\" As if to fulfill a literal request, Sparky turned away from Stitch and Leroy. \"I have a bad feeling about this. Who knows what kind of devilish plan that filth has up his sleeve.\" Leroy was taken aback by the comment. Yes, it was true that he tried to destroy them in the past, albeit under Dr. Hamsterveil's orders, but it was also true that people do get curious of concepts such as togetherness, even villains. While the way Sparky voiced his opinion sounded rude, filth was definitely a word Leroy would have used to describe himself. \"Now, you don't actually mean that, especially since he had been out cold hours after he crashed landed here. We both had been watching him when we brought him in.\" Stitch pointed out Sparky rolled his blue eyes as he turned back to Stitch. \"Alright then, Stitch. You can answer his inquiry. I'm sure that it will do wonders for his bad guy tea party he is planning behind our backs.\" \"Um… Yeah. Okay then,\" Stitch said, turning back to Leroy. \"Well… Before Ohana, I only ever thought of myself and being selfish. I didn't know how to trust others or even let them understand me.\" His ears droop as he continued, \"I guess I wanted to close myself away from others. But, those walls I built to protect me also hinder me.\" Stitch spoke, \"It's...it's almost as if you're-\" Stitch and Leroy said at the exact same time, \"Alone.\" Stitch looked shocked over to Leroy who nodded and he asked him, \"How did you know I was going to say that?\" \"I know the feeling, the bitter loneliness from the realization that life is just a bad hand that was dealt to you and you are forced to make do with it.\" Leroy explains. Sparky lightly descends by Stitch, Stitch stared at Leroy confused. Leroy frowned a little, but didn't allow his face to show how hurt he was and sighed. Stitch carefully walked over to Leroy's side with a blank expression. While Sparky just huffed and leaned on the wall, his face showed his disapproval. Stitch extended his paw out to Leroy as Leroy sniffed it in bewildered by the notion. Sparky chuckled in amusement, which caused Leroy to look at his face, \"What?\" \"You shake the paw,\" Stitch explained, \"not sniff it.\" Leroy looked into Stitch eyes, wondering if there was some malevolent intentions; however, there was none. \"You can trust me,\" Stitch said with a comforting smile. \"Can I really?\" Leroy questioned as he looked between them. Sparky looked at Leroy with his eyes saying what was on his mind. \"You can say or think whatever you want , but know that everything you did to us in the past no longer matters. I want to trust you. I want you to be Ohana. I want to treat you like my family, but you have to earn trust. You need to show us that we can trust you,\" Stitch commented. \"Trust isn't easy to earn, but it isn't out of the realm of possibility for you.\" he added \"Stitch, I don't want there to be strain between us, but my Ohana is very important to me. If he wants to be apart of it, he has to show me that he cares about someone other than himself,\" Sparky stated. \"Ohana is something that should be respected and treasured. I know I had my fair share of not doing that. I thought I was the absolute perfect experiment until Jumba made Evile and had my ass handed to me,\" Stitch stated. \"Don't forget some of the other petty problems you displayed in the past. You can't go a single day without eating EVERYTHING around you. You wreck things that you can get your claws on, and you \"accidentally\" have seizures and tend to spin out of control, hurting everyone around you,\" Sparky added simply. Stitch glared at Sparky as Sparky remarked, \"What? You didn't say we couldn't discuss everything that is wrong with you. One of those traits is that you make rash decisions too quickly, which is what I think led you to act civilized toward that evil bastard and immediately give him your trust.\" \"We've all been where he was Sparky,\" Stitch responded hotly, \"if Lilo hadn't helped us we could be worse off than him.\" \"Then, where was she when he needed her to show him the way?\" \"She couldn't get any time with him. Remember when you were activated? You wanted to play and destroy. We couldn't find you for a full day, you changed only after Lilo and I got captured and then you decided to help us and our cousins,\" Stitch explained. \"Right, because she couldn't pull one of the fifty thousand Leroy clones aside and talk to him.\" Sparky said with a deadpan expression, starting to get annoyed. \"We were in a battle, Sparky, and I couldn't live with myself if something had happened to her. But she risked herself for us countless times. Always believing in the good in others and I'm saying we should try that for Leroy,\" Stitch stated as Leroy looked between the two. \"Because that is what she would do? Is that what you are trying to say?\" \"Yes, I am. I know for sure this is what she would do,\" Stitch replied. \"Do you think she should've turned her back on you once we found out about the cousins?\" Sparky remained silent as he looked away from Stitch. He would never forget that fateful day when they had found him and he immediately bonded with Stitch. At first, Lilo wanted to give him away as part of a ransom, though it was to save another family member. However, with persuasion from his best friend, Lilo changed her mind. So, truthfully, it was Stitch believing in the good of his cousin that he was able to become good. With this small, but significant detail in mind, Sparky looked at Leroy who had been silent the entire time. If Stitch was able to turn so many evil experiments to the side of good, what was to say that he couldn't do it for Leroy no matter what the creator may have claimed? Stitch looked at him with honest eyes, \"Sparky, please tell me, have you ever been on the edge of death? I have. More times than any experiment should have to be. The only thing giving me purpose to continue living this life is my Ohana and I don't want any of them facing the challenges that I have been through. If he is seeking to redeem himself, we should try to give him a chance, don't you think?\" After awhile of contemplation, he looks back at Stitch and nods his head. \"Yeah, I do.\" Stitch reaches over to Sparky and pulls him into a hug, which the electric experiment reciprocated. Sparky could only hope his best friend wasn't making a mistake by doing this. ","Summary":" Hello people, everywhere! I am Lovemet123 and I am proud to present this new Lilo and Stitch Fanfic"},{"Movie":"Lilo & Stitch","Title":"Stitch Versus the Volcano","Author":"I.S.L.Supporter","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10784710","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Two days had passed, since Lilo left the house. When Nani and Stitch saw that she was not anywhere or hiding, they went to every possible place where she could have gone, but without success. Her sister was missing since the afternoon of that Tuesday, few hours after she asked Nani two or three things about an apparently very complicated question. Jumba and Pleakley helped that very night before the Friday, trying to find her at the beach or anywhere around it. Stitch, for his part, more than looking for Lilo was crying her name; and the three or four times Nani heard the calling, she could note something in his voice much like the desperation of whim has lost a very dear person. After a bad night, but early that Friday, they restarted the search. This time, Angel and Reuben joined; however, with the same results. And soon, another little problem was making their search even harder: Stitch, who seemed angry with himself for some reason, had got to a state of madness... He threw down twenty four Palm trees and used the coconuts as cannonballs, firing them to the walls of many houses and and shops while screaming the name of Lilo, among other things that none of them could understand completely -the Good Deeds counter shining dangerously in red-, before Jumba could get Stitch and put him inside a very strong glass capsule, then leaving the enraged blue experiment in the living room of his house. That's when a policeman went there and called Nani by phone. And she told him all about the disappearance of Lilo. \"Something bad was happening that could have made her leave this house?\" \"No, not at all... (Sob) ...She only looked a little troubled... I don't know. Maybe thoughtful\". \"Or worried?\" \"Yes... (Sob). But only for moments\". \"Ok, we'll be looking for her and stop only when we can bring your Lilo here in one piece\". The policeman left and Nani went to cry on the coach; maybe later would continue the searching with Pleakley and Jumba.[Chapter 2] That Tuesday morning, Lilo woke up ready for another normal day. But as she was collecting the things for her school day, she found a letter in her geography book; and soon the girl saw it was a love letter. But her eyes grew bigger with each word as soon as she started to read them. Still not believing her own eyes, Lilo read again the letter three or four times until Nani's voice called her. \"Lilo, the school bus is here!\" She put the paper where it was and went to what she hoped it would be a normal class day. But there, other problems started for her. \"Lilo, did you hear my question? -muffled but general laughs. -How many volcanoes are there in Maui?\" \"Sorry, professor. There are three. No, one. Um, no, I mean two!\" \"Lilo, you live in Hawaii, don't you? Unless I'm very confused and we're in Iceland\". -Much more laughs barely contained. \"I'm sorry, professor… I'll try to know it next time\". -Answered the girl looking downwards, still with the love letter filling her thoughts. \"Why he had to fall in love with me? …I'm sure he still has a girlfriend. When did they finish their relationship, then? Or there's another reason?\" \"And should I accept him as my boyfriend? How would Nani take it?\" Many more thoughts like these crossed her mind for the rest of that day in the classroom. So she could breathe only when the school bus left her in front of her house. Or at least Lilo thought she could do it.[Chapter 3] \"Hello, Nani! Hello, Stitch\". -Her voice wasn't as happy as usual; it only had a strange kind of seriousness. \"Lilo, youga fine?\" \"I guess so. Stitch, can we go and…?\" \"Lilo, why you look so sad?\" -Inquired Nani. \"I'm not sure. Maybe I can answer you later\". -She went to her room, to read again the letter and think, after having locked the door from inside. But after the lunch, Nani took Lilo to the living room and went back to that question. The little alien followed them, not wanting to be left behind. \"Lilo, can you tell me what's the problem?\" \"And to mega, Lilo?\" -Asked Stitch looking annoyed at Nani for a second. \"I don't know if I can, sorry… At least not in front of both. Stitch, could Nani and I have a private conversation? I promise to talk to you later\". \"Okie-taka\". -Answered he, but not exactly leaping for joy. \"Nani, somebody left me a letter in one of my school books\". \"Really? But that's very good, and instead you look so troubled. What's the problem, then?\" \"I don't know what to answer\". \"Why not, Lilo?\" -The sister kept in silence for some seconds and then asked. -\"Who's that boy?\" The little girl felt a short but strong shiver and hoped that Nani had missed it. \"I'd like to tell you… And of course I should, because then… Well -she sighed. -Can I ask you just one more thing?\" Her sister nodded. \"Do you know how love works?\" \"Not exactly, Lilo. That's a very hard question\". Lilo took a deep breath before speaking again. \"But what happens when a boy, let's say, falls in love with a girl knowing that… They're so… Different inside?\" \"Well, I guess that… In such cases, the love doesn't bother to ask one's heart if it's right or wrong to fall for another person. It goes on like crazy until it gets the cake, to say it somehow. Hey, wait! Lilo, where are you going?\" …But the little girl went running to her room, where she would try to think and decide soon something, about what was written in that love letter.[Chapter 4] Three hours later in which Nani had gone to the market and Pleakley asked Stitch to help him with something a little ridiculous, came the time for supper but Lilo wasn't getting out of her room. \"Lilo, the supper's ready!\" -Called Nani with no answer. Stitch went up after a few seconds. \"Nani calls, why youga naga ans…?\" -He cut the question right after he opened the door. \"Nani, Lilo naga in her room!\" -Shouted, running to the elevator. \"What? Are you sure she's not playing hide and s…?\" \"AND NAGA AT HOME!\" -Stitch was almost finishing the short trip downwards. \"WHAT? I can't believe it. LIIIILOOOOO!\" \"AND NAGA AT HOOOOOME!\" -Yelled Stich this time, raising his clenched fists and jumping in his place. Nani finally understood but tried to stay calm and think. \"We'll look for her right now. Let's start the search in David's house\". Not finding her there, they went to ask in the market. Then they tried in the Café (\"No, we didn't see her\"), in other nearby houses (\"No, Lilo wasn't here\"), in the Hotel (\"We don't remember having seen her today\") and in many shops, with the same kind of answers. She wasn't even with Victoria, her best friend. Then where…? Another hour later Jumba started to help along with Pleakley. They searched in the beach and all around it while Nani went on in every street. But now and then, she and the two aliens could hear the voice of Stitch, calling Lilo but apparently with much more desperation than Nani herself. Somebody else, of course, was hearing him… Only that she had to stay there, hiding for the moment even though her heart could break. ","Summary":" Two days had passed, since Lilo left the house.

Most Americans were against the war in Vietnam, Led Zeppelin was releasing a fourth album and Jim Morrison had been found dead in Paris. Above all things happening in the country, before mini-skirts and The Partridge Family, The Brady Bunch and knee socks, the turmoil in Alexandria was of the greatest importance. The school board was forcing an integration for the following Fall, the same year my family chose to move to the small town in Virginia, the same year a young black man was killed by a white store owner. I hailed from New Jersey, a state that seemed worlds away and one where race was not as fixated on. There is prejudice everywhere, but I had never seen any as vocalized as I did upon our move to Alexandria. I had never actually seen a protest outside of the news, but that changed just a few days after arriving in the small town. We were white. I'd never had any issues because of my skin. I saw the struggles, I could sympathize and try to understand but I would never pretend to know what it felt like to be judged because of my race. I grew up Irish in an Italian neighborhood but that was nothing but innocent ribbing between friends, especially compared to this. People stared at me from time to time, I dressed more relaxed and \"hippie\" than most, especially in Alexandria. I had long, flowing red hair that I parted down the center with a bit of bangs and layers to keep it from my face, corkscrewing into ringlet curls at the very ends that I always wore down unless I was playing or training. I had my father's gray-green eyes and my mother's rosy cheeks and perfect lips, all set in a warm, friendly oval face. I dressed simply, skirts and dresses were reserved for church on Sundays and most school days but I was very fond of jeans and slacks. I still am. I played soccer for six years, I danced ballet for eight and I was fortunate enough not to move around too much before now. My father was in the Marines during the Korean War, remaining in the service reporting in at Fort Dix doing whatever it was he did, and both of my older brothers were serving or had served in Vietnam. My mother, though supportive of my athletic and academic endeavors, worried more for me than I thought necessary as I, the youngest of her children, had yet to fly the coop. In this dynamic I was raised to judge a man, not by the color of his skin, but by the caliber of his character. This was something I quickly learned was not practiced by most in Alexandria. The integration of the schools was announced a week or so after our move and I was excited for the prospect of diverse friendships and for the opportunity to play ball. Upon our move, I realized that there was no soccer team, let alone a women's team but I had quickly resolved to play the sport I so often played with my brothers and cousins at family cook outs. A sport I loved and could provide a valued skill to, football. Yes, football. I immediately checked Virginia state regulations for the rules regarding females in male sports and according to regulation; \"if a women's team does not exist, the intermingling of the sexes is allowed to ensure equal play opportunities to both parties.\" I was left to assume that it came down to the coach for a final decision; whether or not I was up to snuff. Part of me was nervous to go out for the high school football team, with all of the integration business I knew that the furthest thing from anyone's mind was going to be a girl playing football . Then there was the other part of me, the part that knew this would be an amazing opportunity and that I was capable of making the team. I was tiny, very tiny especially in comparison to most football players. I stood at 5'3\" and couldn't have weighed more than a buck-oh-five. I knew I would be underestimated because of my size, because of my gender and, by some in Alexandria, my skin, but I was determined– resolved to prove myself and not only show that gender didn't matter, but that race didn't either.[Chapter 2] Chapter 1: \"Zero fun, sir.\" It was late July, Alexandria had a bubbling undercurrent of caution, ill-masked hatred and anger. The city was on the verge of explosion but dad took it in stride. We'd moved in two weeks ago. Mom was excited about getting to decorate the new place and the neighbors were nice, some black and some white. It was a passing thought that dad had chosen this house because it was closer to \"The Berg\", as the locals referred to it, and thus a more diverse area, which made me smile. Mom had hit it off with everyone very quickly as was her bubbly, welcoming nature. Cal had driven out with us, to help us settle in and I'd sent Ben a letter immediately with Polaroids of the house so he'd have the new address. I missed him so much and had been ticking down the days left in his tour, tucking our letters into a shoe box. (Copies of the letters I'd send and his responses. I knew he'd want them all some day, sentimental geek.) Ben completely supported my idea to go out for the team, to be the kicker. He believed in me and mom and dad were supportive, only minimally concerned for my safety as they knew I could handle myself. (Cal had gotten very into Tai Chi when he came home from his last tour in Vietnam and I volunteered to learn with him.) And lo and behold, the football team was meeting that week to take on new players. Mom dropped me off on her way to work at the local salon. She was a perfect fit for the place; warm personality, beautiful and an excellent stylist. The high school was what I expected, standard. I made my way to the gym, standing off to the side as not to draw attention to myself. Myself and the rest of the town knew that they had given the head coaching position to Coach Boone over Coach Yoast and none of the young men in the gym with me were white. It took all of my self control not to roll my eyes at the narrow-mindedness of the community. The boys laughed and joked with one another, some sitting in the bleachers behind them, having friendly, light-hearted conversation. I smiled as I watched the interactions until a commanding man with a medium skin tone, followed by another with a goatee marched in. The boys on the bleachers shot up and fell in line quickly. I assumed the commanding man was Coach Boone as he came to a stop in front of a young man, I believed was called Petey, with his fist raised. \"Put your hand down. You smiling.\" The coach addressed him so sternly, the younger man immediately lowered his arm. He then proceeded to cut into him a bit, asking him why he was smiling and why he thought football was 'fun'. The rest of the group remained silent, not wanting to bring the coach's wrath upon them. \"All right, listen up. I'm Coach Boone. I'm gonna tell you all about how much \"fun\" you gonna have this season. We leave for camp; Gettysburg College, August 15th, 7:29 am. If you report at 7:30, you will not be playing football this season, you will be watching. You will wear a jacket, shirt, and tie. If you don't have one, buy one. Can't afford one, then borrow one from your old man. If you don't have an old man, then find a drunk, trade him for his. 'Cause I can guarantee you there isn't a bum on the street that looks as raggedy and ridiculous as what I'm looking at right now.\" Boone spoke, his eyes sweeping across the boys, spotting me in the process as I wrote down the date and time for camp in my pocket-sized notebook. \"This is no democracy. It is a dictatorship. I am the law. If you survive camp, you will be on the team. If you survive. Check 'em in, Coach.\" He spoke with brief pauses for effect, turning the teenagers over to the facial hair sporting coach. \"Check 'em in.\" He repeated Coach Boone's last phrase before drawing up his clipboard. \"I'm Coach Hinds, your offensive line coach. Yell out your name and position starting from the right.\" I didn't hear much of the positions being called as Coach Boone approached me. \"Excuse me young lady, but may I ask why you're at my team meeting?\" He was polite and formal, but had a no-nonsense tone that made what he asked more so a command than a request. \"I'm sorry, sir.\" I began, nervous. \"I'd like to try out for the team.\" He looked at me skeptically, glancing down at the information I'd written in my notebook. \"Uh-huh. What position do you play Miss...\" Boone trailed off, expecting a name. \"Catherine O'Shea, sir.\" I stammered, \"I'm a kicker.\" I was minutely aware of the others calling out positions and names. A Petey Jones, the boy whose arm was raised. Jerry Harris, who the boys called 'Rev', and a heavy-set boy with blonde hair and a kind face named Louie Lastik. Coach Hinds turned his head to observe Coach Boone and I, with a look in his eye, I couldn't quite place. \"Miss O'Shea, I'm not sure you understand that this is–\" I interrupted him before he could finish. \"Excuse me, sir. I know I'm asking an awful lot but before you say no, please let me demonstrate my skill. You don't owe me anything, heck, you don't know me from Eve but all I'm asking for is a shot and I don't think you'll be disappointed.\" Coach Boone's eyes narrowed as he contemplated it for a moment, sharing a look with Coach Hinds before returning his fierce gaze to me. \"Would you be able to demonstrate before you leave?\" I nodded my head eagerly. \"Yes, sir.\" I watched him nod, returning his attention to the assembly as a whole as the doors burst open. A stern, but not unfriendly looking man led a group, of what I could only assume were football players, into the gym. Coach Boone nodded over toward the already assembled boys for me to take my place beside Lastik, while he and the man I can only assume was Coach Yoast went to have a chat. The air was thick with tension as the two groups glared at one another while Hinds continued through check-in. Being the only girl in the room and the only person with a flaming mop of hair, drew quite a bit of attention my way. There were whispers and glares from both sides but the heavy-set boy paid them no mind. \"I'm Louie Lastik. My family just moved here from Bayonne.\" He smiled warmly down at me for a moment. \"Catherine O'Shea. Just moved here from Barnegat.\" I smiled as recognition flashed across his face. \"Small world.\" Louie said with a small chuckle. I turned to Rev next. \"I'm Catherine.\" I spoke, holding out my hand for him to shake. \"Jerry Harris.\" He said softly, shaking my hand with a small smile. His skin was lighter in tone than Coach Boone and his hair was cut very neatly with a deep side-part. He had a warmth to his countenance, and I relaxed a bit given the circumstances. Beyond Rev, was Petey as he'd so flirtatiously introduced himself. I smiled politely, noticing the small mole on his upper-lip as I shook his hand. \"Young lady?\" Coach Hinds' voice drew my attention. \"Yes, sir.\" I snapped my head back toward him. \"Name and position, please.\" He smiled at me, drawing what little attention wasn't on me, to me. \"Catherine O'Shea. Kicker.\" After Coach Boone and Coach Yoast had their pow-wow, the group was dismissed with one last reminder of camp and when they would need to arrive. Coach Boone approached me and he and the other coaches led the way out to the football field. It didn't escape my notice that some of the boys had stuck around curious about what a girl could do on the field. Rev, Louie and Petey had stayed as well as some of the white players; a broad young man with light brown hair, a blonde and a very stern looking boy. Coach Tyrell, who was introduced as the Special Teams coach, handed me a bag of balls and a tee. I gave a brief 'thank-you' before turning to the coaches. \"Regardless of your decision, I'd like to thank you for giving me the opportunity to prove myself.\" I said softly, eyes darting between the four men and mainly staying on Boone and Yoast. I walked out to the 50 yard-line, dropping the tee and sack before setting up the kick. I stepped back a few paces before charging forward and sending the ball flying straight through the center of the goalpost. The boys were talking amongst themselves at my successful field goal but the coaches were silent. I picked up the tee and walked down field 30 yards, resetting my kick at the 80 yard-line. \"Now, darlin', don't be foolish. Nobody can kick a successful field goal from that far out.\" Coach Tyrell's accented drawl droned out, some of the boys chuckling. I paid him no mind and repeated my first kick, sending the ball through the goalpost– dead center. I picked up the tee and bag of balls and returned to the sidelines. The coaches were silent, the boys were staring at me as if I had grown two heads; I'd blown it. \"I, um. I understand. Thank you for humoring me.\" I dropped the ball bag and tee and moved to leave before Coach Yoast's voice halted me. \"Have you played football before?\" He exchanged a glance with Coach Tyrell and Coach Boone. \"No sir, never on a team. I played soccer and did ballet. I only played football with my brothers and cousins.\" I did my best to keep my answers short and my voice level. \"Miss O'Shea, will you be joining us at camp?\" I turned my head to Coach Boone. \"Yes sir, if you'll have me.\" I replied with a smile as he nodded his head, a small smile of his own playing at his lips. \"We'll see you August 15th.\" The boys were still aghast with shock but most seemed mildly impressed expect for the stern one. That night I told my parents the great news over dinner and wrote a letter to Ben as soon as I got home. Dad was proud, he and mom raised me to believe I could do anything a boy could do and better if I pushed myself. Mom was excited for me, if not also a little nervous about me playing such an aggressive sport. The two weeks between now and camp couldn't come fast enough.

When the yellow light ball stopped it showed a experiment that had. Purple eyes, bluish-grey fur, a shark's dorsal fin and a tail like a shark, claws as long as Stitch's and sharp teeth's. the experiment looked up and instantly locked eyes with Stitch and gave him an evil glair. \"MEGGA NALA KWEESTA!\" Shouted experiment 629 who then tackled Stitch to the ground. Stitch kicked Experiment 629 off him and then tackled him to the ground but he missed. 629 then jumped on to Stitch and bit his arm. \"FUCK THAT HURTS.\" Shouted Stitch in pain \"ANNIE SHOOT HIM.\" Shouted Angel. Annie was aiming at experiment 629 and then shot him with the net \"GOT HIM!\" Shouted Annie. Experiment 629 tried to wiggle out of the net but could not escape. \"Stitch are you okay?\" Asked Angel in a worried tone \"yup luckily our cousin did not bite threw skin and make me bleed.\" Said Stitch who was holding his arm. 629 bit through the net while Stitch and Angel were talking. 629 then got up and turned around to see Annie pointing a plasma gun at him. EXPERIMENT 629 POV I turned around and saw her face. She looked so beautiful with that cowboy hat on. She had a face of an angel and had a stunning body. My jaw dropped and I heard my beat loudly. I wanted to attack because she shot a net at me but I could not. She was just standing there staring at me as well I wonder what she thinking? ANNIE'S POV I see him turn around and stared at me and his jaw drops. I found it cute and funny. He looked handsome and charming. I wanted to fire a net again but I wanted to keep on staring in to his purple eyes. I thought is this how love feel's like because if so I want more. Angel and Stitch saw the two experiments staring into each other eyes. They knew what was happing, Stitch walked up to Experiment 629 and said \"hello cousin.\" Experiment 629 snapped out of it and saw Stitch reaching his paws out. \"cousin?\" asked Experiment 629 in a confused tone \"ih you ohana.\" Said Angel who walked up behind Stitch \"ohana?\" asked experiment 629 \"ohana mean's family.\" Said Stitch \"and family means no one left behind.\" Said Angel and Lilo in sync \"or forgotten.\" Said Annie who was giving a smile at 629. 629 blushed and said \"megga soka for attacking ohana.\" \"that's fine Annie did that to.\" Said Stitch \"okay time to name you.\" Said Lilo who was looking at 629 \"how about the name Jaws.\" Asked Lilo \"okie-takka.\" Answered Jaws \"Stitch why don't you show Jaws the town and find his true place while I do my homework.\" Said Lilo \"okie-takka.\" Said Stitch \"come on cousin.\" Said Stitch to Jaws.

I loved this movie ever since I saw it for the first time in 10 th grade; and since I play flag football in college now, I just wondered how the movie would be if a black girl joined the TC Williams team. Hope you enjoy and don't forget to leave a review for this and my other stories! DISCLAIMER: The only things I own are my OC(s), Disney owns everything else! A new family from Los Angeles, California was driving down the swerving roads of Alexandria, Virginia in the family truck: a '66 dark blue Jeep Gladiator. In said car was a father, mother, and their only daughter, who was slightly mashed up against the window; but she was alright with it. It was the summer of 1971 and the girl's family decided to make the move to her mother's old hometown. She could see the immediate difference in the environment. It was nothing like LA. Home was way more accepting and relaxed than Alexandria. In this town, the integration was more forced and you could see the tension between black and white people. \"Hey Ma? Is Virginia like you remember it?\" the girl asked. \"I don't know, Rae. It's changed since I left, that's for sure,\" her mother replied. The woman looked like one of those backup singers for a musical group with her hair styled like Diahann Carroll, complete with soft and caring hazel eyes. Rae's father looked younger than he was and had a small afro with dark brown eyes. The car drove up to a house at the edge of a street which was not too far from the new school the girl would be attending, T.C. Williams. It was recently announced that it would be integrated in the upcoming school year. But that wasn't what interested Rae (short for Rayelynn). She researched the ins and outs of the sport team regulations, specifically for football. There was a fine print amendment in the rulebook that stated if there was no specific girls' team, then females could try out for the boys' team. And she was determined to try out and possibly play on the team. You see, Rae had three older brothers and played football with them when she was little, with a bit of coaching from her father. Now, her eldest brother was in the Navy and wouldn't be back until maybe Christmas; her two elder twin brothers were in college and they all played football during their high school days. In was in her blood, and she took after them so much. She absolutely detested anything \"girly\" and would often wear jeans, t-shirts, and regular pants; no dresses or skirts. This annoyed her mother to no end, and often made her worry about when she would play with her dad in the front yard or pretend wrestle with her brothers. Rae stood at a small, but respectable height of 5'4'' and weighed 110 pounds. She had pitch black hair that was in a pixie cut with bangs that were swept to the left and had her father's dark brown eyes. \"It is nice to be back home, but I ain't gonna lie. Things are different here,\" her mom continued. \"What do you mean?\" Rae asked uncertainly. Rae's dad cut right to the chase and replied, \"It's racist over here, baby. The black folks here aren't accepted like back in LA. But since they're integrating the school, maybe things'll change for the better.\" The family started to unpack their car and move their things into the new house when a voice came up and yelled, \"Hey!\" Rae turns around and sees a young man who looks like one of her brothers and is waving at them from a few houses down. She waves back and jumps out of the trunk to go talk to him. She could see that this boy was built for sports and was quite attractive in strong, no-nonsense type of way. \"Y'all must be our new neighbors. I'm Julius. Julius Campbell.\" \"Nice to meet ya. My name's Rae Barstow,\" she replies hold her hand out for him to shake. \"You headin' to T.C. Williams?\" \"That's right, and I'm guessin' you are as well,\" Julius wondered while shaking her hand. She nodded and went back to her family's pickup and continued to unload boxes. \"Let me take those for you,\" Julius offered. \"Naw, I got it. Thanks though,\" Rae said as she lifted two large boxes and one small box in a stack. \"Look at my girl, making friends already,\" Rae's father said from under the car hood, after giving it a once over. Julius noticed how much Rae took after her dad as she was handing him the tools he needed. \"Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Barstow,\" he said. \"No need to be formal with me, son. Call me Saul,\" Rae's father insisted. After everything was unpacked and the family had moved in, Rae thanked Julius for his help and Mr. Barstow invited him to come over anytime. As her new friend was leaving, Mrs. Florence Barstow came outside and said, \"Who were you talking to dear?\" \"Rae's new friend, Julius,\" Saul replied. \"He seems like a nice boy,\" Florence commented looking at her daughter. \"Yeah… but wait 'til school starts up,\" Rae mused before going inside their new house.[Chapter 2] Ok, people are slowly starting to acknowledge this story. Y'all are busy and may not have time. I completely understand. Here's the next chapter. DISCLAIMER: The only things I own are my OC(s), Disney owns everything else! The next couple of days sped by in a blur as Rae prepared her sports clothes and school clothes. She wanted to make a good impression on the coach for the Titans and get a spot on the team, despite the fact that she would be the only girl. Her dad kept reassuring her that she was well qualified, but her mom was still a bit on the nervous side of how they would treat her baby and that the only time you saw girls on the field was if they were cheerleaders. Rae also learned that Julius was going for the team and that there was a mandatory meeting for those interested this season. Watch, there ain't gonna be one black dude willing to go over to the white side, or vice versa. She waited until Julius was far enough away so that she started walking to the gym for the meeting. Rae opened the doors to the gym and saw that all of the people that had arrived were black, and no one had mixed up the group yet. \"We gonna play some ball, my man! Black inside! Uh, uh, uh, uh!\" She hears a teen with a charming boyish face yell while high-fiving the other guys. \"Yo, Petey!\" Another male shouts the smiley boy's name getting his attention. \"How many yards you figure you gon' get?\" \"You know I ain't the one to brag, Big Blue. But I figure at least a thousand,\" Petey told his friend. \"Who knows? You may get more,\" I piped up. That made Petey and Big Blue whip their heads around to look for my voice. \"Down here,\" I said jokingly. They switched their gaze down to my height and looked at me in jest. \"Well, lookie here! We got ourselves a Titaness. You figure you gonna steal some yards from me, doll?\" \"Naw, but I was puttin' in my two-bits worth if that helps,\" I replied. Apparently Julius heard my voice and came over to us. \"Rae, what are you doin' here?\" \"Hey Julius. I'm here 'cause I want to try out like all y'all,\" I said, and noticed that Petey and Blue went back to their conversation and Blue started to sing. \"Didn't I tell you how them white boys weren't gonna play for no brother?\" Julius asked Blue. \"Hey, who needs them, baby? From now on, the Titans is gonna have soul power!\" Blue cheered and Rae started to hum along with him. All of a sudden, a shrill whistle pierces the air and in come two dark skinned males in TC Williams polo shirts and beige pants. The one with the whistle around his neck walks over to get a look at all of the black players. He stops at Petey, who still has a grin on his face and his hand in the air like he was in a classroom. \"Put your hand down,\" Whistle Man almost shouts. Petey obeys but still has that goofy grin on his face. \"You're smiling.\" \"Yes…\" Petey hesitantly responds before correcting himself by saying \"Yessir!\" \"Why are you smiling?\" Whistle Man asks with a hard tone in his voice. \"'Cause I love football. It's fun,\" Petey responds slowly, not wanting to upset the man in front of him. That kid is gonna die under this man's glare. \"Fun, sir. It's fun? Are you sure?\" the man continues with his voice raised. \"I think –\" Petey starts, but the man cuts him off. \"So now you're thinkin'. First you smile, then you think. You think football is still fun?\" \"Um, yes!\" Petey smiles again, until he quickly takes it back, showing his awkwardness in the situation. \"Sir,\" the man reminds the boy. \"Yes – Uh, no, sir. Well, it was fun,\" Petey stutters under the man's steel glare. \"Not fun anymore, is it?\" the man shouts, spooking Petey and the boy manages to get out a couple of no's. \"No, it's not fun anymore. Not even a little bit?\" Petey comes up with an \"Um…no.\" \"Make up your mind! Go ahead,\" the man urges on. \"Make up your mind, think since you're thinking!\" \"No, sir.\" \"No? Absolutely not?\" \"Zero fun, sir,\" Petey finishes with a small smirk. The man finally steps away from him and continues pacing, \"Alright listen up! I'm Coach Boone. I'm gonna tell you all how much fun you gonna have this season.\" He directed that last part at Petey, reminding everyone of their conversation. \"We leave for camp: Gettysburg College. August 15; 7:29 AM. If you get there at 7:30, you will not be playin' this season; you'll be watching.\" He even goes on to tell everyone that they are to wear proper attire and look professional, going on to say how bad some of the players looked. Great, I gotta wear a damn dress as if I going to work with Mom! Rae groaned in her mind. \"This is not a democracy; this is a dictatorship. I am the law. If you survive camp, you will be on the team. If you survive. Check 'em in, Coach,\" He said before turning it over to the other coach that came in. \"Checkin' them in! I am Coach Hinds, your offensive line coach. Yell out your name and position, starting from the right side.\" \"Petey Jones: running back. THE running back, y'all!\" Petey declares happily causing a lot of the guys to laugh with him. \"Jerry Harris: quarterback,\" another boy states with someone at the edge shouting, \"Rev!\" He's got a soft smile and a sort of \"good boy\" attitude around him. \"Rev?\" Boone wondered. \"It's just a nickname,\" he explains. \"Now, hold on, before we continue…young lady, what may I ask are you doing here?\" Boone turns to me, causing all of the guys to glance in my direction, most of them surprised that a girl showed up. \"I'm sorry, Coach Boone, sir. I…would like to try out for the team\" Rae starts, but ends up getting nervous under the scrutinizing glare of the coach. \"Speak up, and tell me what position you play Miss…\" Boone stops when he expects my name. Gathering up any courage left her, the girl looks at him, dead in his eyes, speaks up and says, \"Rae Barstow, and I'm offensive tight end.\" \"Well, Miss Barstow, I hope you're aware that this team-\" Boone starts before Rae interrupts him. \"Pardon the interruption, sir. I know I'm reachin' out there, but please give me a shot to show you my skill, before you tell me no. Y'all don't own me anything, why, know me from another girl off the street; all I'm asking is for you to let me demonstrate what I can do, and I don't think it will waste your time nor will you be disappointed.\" Coach Boone narrowed his eyes at her mini plea, turned his head towards Coach Hinds, then set his gaze back to Rae. \"See me after the meeting, young lady.\" \"Yessir!\" Rae responds without missing a beat, and Coach Boone nods her way. Just then, a large white teen makes his way over to Coach Boone, trying to catch his breath. \"And who in the name of Heaven might you be?\" Coach Hinds asks. \"Louie Lastik: offensive lineman. Naval family, we just moved in from Bayone. Somebody said football, and I came runnin'. What's going on, everyone?\" the heavy guy answers, but an awkward silence fills the room. Glad to see someone trying to mix us up, Rae mused. Not three seconds later, the doors were pushed open again, and this time a bunch of other guys with another two men in TC polos and beige pants entered the gym. The only major difference was that they were white. The tension in the air was so thick, you could almost see it. Being the only girl with short hair brought some attention to me from the white side. The whispers quieted down after Coach Boone and Coach Yoast of the white players had their little pow wow. The group was then dismissed after a last-minute reminder of camp and what to wear. Rae jogged over to Coach Boone so she could see what he wanted to talk to her about. \"Miss Barstow, this is Coach Yoast for the defense and Coach Tyrell of the Special Teams. I believe you wanted to prove to us why you would be valuable to the team.\" \"Yessir, and regardless of y'alls decision, thank you for this opportunity,\" Rae answered. A group of boys, both black and white stayed behind to see the girl who was trying out, and what she could do on the field. \"Go long, Barstow!\" Coach Tyrell called and that was Rae's cue to run like hell from the 30-yard line and attempt to catch a far pass. She caught it with ease at the 15-yard line on the other side of the field. This drill happened a couple more times and Yoast switched off from catching to blocking. \"How well do you think you can hold your block?\" \"I'll do my best, sir\" Rae answered. Yoast called over a young man with a stern face and told us to get into position. \"Down…Set! Hut!\" He pushed against her and she pushed against him. Neither of them wanted to give in to the other. This continued on with four more guys until Coach Yoast called the drill off and asked, \"Have you ever played football before?\" \"Not on a team, sir. Just with my brothers and father. I also did a little bit of track and field,\" Rae replied. After about two minutes of delegation between the coaches, Coach Boone spoke up, \"Will we be seeing you at camp, Miss Barstow?\" \"If y'all will take me, then, yes sir!\" Rae replied with a grin almost as big as Petey's. Coach Boone nodded with a small smile on his lips, \"See you August 15th.\" \"At 7:29, not 7:30 in professional attire!\" Rae called while jogging back to her house. Coach Boone looks at her retreating figure speechless and laughs to himself. \"Can you believe the audacity of that girl?\" \"Are you sure that we should have her practice with the boys?\" Coach Yoast asks and receives a knowing stare from Coach Boone. \"The girl's tough, and is willing to work for a goal,\" Boone comments. Yoast thinks back to before the exhibition and how some of the boys muttered words of doubt for her under their breath; however, he thinks to himself, \" Perhaps she could help get these boys together, both black and white. And maybe she would get along fine with Sheryl. \"The boys that stuck around to see Rae's exhibition had mixed expressions. Some went slack jawed that a girl made it on the team, while others were impressed that she was tough. The only one whose expression didn't change was the one who had a stern face through the whole show. That night at dinner, Rae told her parents, wrote a letter to her brother in the Navy, Marcus, and called her twin brothers, Tyler and Kenneth. Saul spun around the room hugging his daughter, saying how he was proud of his little linewoman. Florence was happy for Rae, but still was apprehensive that she would be playing a rough sport, with a bunch of boys, no less. The time between now and August 15th couldn't come fast enough for Rae.[Chapter 3] Thanks to those who posted reviews so far! I also want to thank you guys for following and favoriting. Hopefully more people will start reading and/or keep tabs on this story. Also, sorry for taking so long with the updates. I am trying to bounce back from a bad college semester, and I'm focusing on finals right now as well as working on my other stories, so the new chapters might be coming in slowly. Thanks for your patience and support! DISCLAIMER: The only things I own are my OC(s), Disney owns everything else! August 15 finally came and Rae couldn't be more excited. She woke up early that morning and found her mother reading the morning paper and her father at the stove. \"Daddy's cooking? Lord, have mercy!\" Rae exclaimed dramatically, getting her mom to laugh with her. \"Oh, you think you're fresh, huh, little girl?\" Saul retorted back in jest, pointing the spatula at her. \"But seriously, what's the occasion? You rarely cook breakfast. Usually it's either Mom or me here at the stove,\" Rae wondered. \"We just wanted to send you off to camp with good wishes before you leave. Your father even made your favorite: short-stacked pancakes, bacon, and some toast,\" Florence answered as Saul put the plate in front of Rae. \"Besides, we want to meet the coaches that accepted you.\" \"Eat up, champ. You gotta get dressed properly and be there by 7:29, right?\" Saul asked. \"Dammit,\" Rae muttered under her breath, slightly hoping that they would forget about the professional attire. \"Language, Rayelynn. Besides, it's just on the way there. It ain't like you gotta wear it the whole time at camp,\" Florence said. \"I guess,\" Rae mused while eating. \"I got the perfect outfit for you, dear.\" Florence practically dragged her daughter to hers and Saul's room. \"Now, where is it?\" she wondered while sifting through her work outfits. When she reached the back of the row, she pulled out a sharp-looking black pantsuit. \"Your Aunt Clarisa gave me this for Christmas two years ago, but it doesn't fit me. Maybe you'll get into it.\" Rae hurried to get dressed and showed her mother. \"It fits,\" Florence gasps. With her bags packed from the day before, the family headed over to the school gym. Both of her parents drove down in their Jeep and saw the other players either boarding the buses or they were already on them. However, the players and their families were completely divided. Not only did the white and black players get into separate buses, but their families stood on separate sides of the parking lot. Rae happened to spot a familiar face about to head up to the bus, \"Hey, Julius.\" \"Rae, what's gon' on?\" he responds with a one-armed hug. \"Julius, how are you, son? Haven't seen you much since we moved in,\" Rae's dad greets as he patted him on the back. \"I'm fine, Mr. Saul. Is Rae going to camp with us?\" Julius asks. \"Absolutely,\" he responds pointing to her bags. \"Now, don't doubt her abilities. She's been playin' with her brothers ever since she was a little thing. Being the only girl never stopped her, and it doesn't bother her now.\" \"I may be tiny, but I bet I could run circles around you, Campbell,\" Rae scolds playfully. \"Is that a challenge, Barstow?\" Julius retorts back in jest. \"Maybe it is,\" Rae quips. \"Alright, you, go find your mother and take her to the Coach,\" Saul advises. Rae looks for her mom and heads off in her direction. \"Son, make sure you watch over my little girl at camp, will you? She may kill it on the field, but as her father, I worry about how the others will treat her. Also, her mother is on edge with her even doing this thing, cause this sport is pretty dangerous. Can I depend on you?\" \"I'll do my best, sir,\" Julius responds and earns a quiet, \"Good man\" from Saul. \"Coach Boone! Coach!\" Rae calls causing him to look her way. \"Well, well! Good morning to you Miss Barstow. Glad to see you here early and properly dressed!\" Coach Boone greets the girl and shakes her hand. Rae also greets Yoast and Tyrell before her parents come over. \"I wanted to introduce my parents to y'all,\" she motions to her mother and father standing on both sides of her. Saul reaches out and greets them firmly with Florence gently shaking their hands. \"It's a pleasure to meet you coaches. Saul Barstow, and this is my wife, Florence,\" he announces and gestures to her. \"We want to thank you for accepting her on the team.\" \"It's not a problem, Mr. Barstow. We look forward to having her and she made a convincing argument during the meeting,\" Coach Yoast responded. \"Will she be doing the same practice workouts as the gentlemen? If so, is it safe?\" Florence asked, trying to hide her nervousness. \"Mrs. Barstow, I can assure you that she will not be treated differently than any of the other players, and we will ensure the safety of all,\" Coach Boone replies. \"Besides, your daughter has a strong will and looks capable of holding her own slack. We could use a player like her on the team.\" \"That's good, and thank you Coach,\" Florence said, relieved. Her parents took her off to the side one more time and gave her a quick good-luck hug and kiss before she boarded the bus with the black players. Rae started looking for a seat, but instead found familiar faces from the meeting. \"Hey y'all! What's good?\" she calls out. They glance over to her and her bags, surprised that a girl was joining them. \"Wow, would you look at that! If it isn't the Titaness doll!\" Petey smiles from his seat and goes to greet her. \"The one…and only, Petey!\" Rae points to herself in jest and high-fives the grinning boy. She hears Big Blue humming, and leans over to him and cheers \"Sing it, Blue! Sang it loud and proud, man! Give us that soul power.\" This gets the guys cheering for him, and Big Blue starts humming louder until she turns to Julius and sits next to him, \"Ready to play some football, Campbell?\" \"As ready as you are, Barstow,\" Julius responds with a slight smirk. \"Hold up, hold up. How come you know our names, but we ain't heard yours, girl? That's a cryin' shame! And how do you and Julius know each other?\" Blue asks, pausing his humming. \"Right, how silly of me. I'm Rae Barstow, and I live a few houses down from Julius,\" Rae responds receiving hand slaps from around her. \"Well, alright then, baby!\" Petey announces shaking her hand. Rae turns to another boy and it's the one who has the \"good boy\" attitude around him. \"I'm Jerry Harris, but you can call me Rev. Everyone else does. Nice to meet you, Rae,\" he greets politely. \"Likewise, Rev. You're a quarterback, if I remember correctly,\" Rae responds. \"Yes, ma'am.\" Rev said smiling warmly at his new teammate. \"Rev, ain't no need for this 'Yes, ma'am' business around me. We're all friends here,\" Rae gently shut down. Outside the bus, she could hear Coach Boone mock two white players named \"Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin\" in front of the crowd. But the man's ire didn't end there. He came on to the buses and pulled everyone out. \"Listen up; I don't care if you're black, green, blue, white, or orange. I want all of my defensive players on this side, and all players going for offense over here.\" They all got into their lines and he started pairing them up to sit next to each other. \"Get comfy, because the person I have you sitting next to is the same one you will be rooming with for the duration of this camp.\" \"Miss Barstow, you will be rooming with my daughter, Sheryl. Usually she has a room with me, but it would make sense for you to be with her since you're both girls,\" Coach Yoast said and pulled Rae aside. \"I understand, Coach,\" Rae replies. \"Go find a seat on the offensive bus. There should be some room since the others have a partner.\" Rae nodded and started looking for an empty seat inside the bus. She eventually found one near the back and sat down in awkward silence. The tension was so thick; you could cut it with a butter knife. \" Cause, baby, there ain't no mountain high enough. Ain't no valley low enough, ain't no… \" Blue started to sing. He tried to get Julius to sing with him, but he wouldn't even crack a smile. Blue tried with a player in front of him, and they started singing some more until Julius got annoyed at them. \"Blue, shut up. I don't want to see you smilin' and shufflin', and hear all yo' minstrel show singing on this bus. You too.\" \"Jerry Lewis\" was sitting next to him and added his criticism while looking at the window, \"You got that right.\" \"You can shut up, too,\" Julius snapped at him. I whispered to myself, \"Lord, give these fools strength not to kill each other at camp.\" When the buses finally arrived at Gettysburg College, all of the boys rushed out of them like they were on fire, hurrying to grab their bags. Rae was about to grab her stuff when the stern-faced boy shoved her and made her fall, \"Outta my way, nigra. Besides, you won't last long here, anyways.\" Rae, irked at his choice of terminology, huffed in response. \"Doll, you alright? How'd you fall?\" Petey asked as he found her on the ground. \"Jerk pushed me down as I was grabbin' my bag,\" she said. \"Where's that white boy?\" he started to charge, but Rae held him back. \"Don't; we're here to play football, not fight and get kicked out after the first day,\" Rae warned. \"At least let me help you,\" Petey offered. \"Thanks, man,\" she accepted and he helped her up and got her bag for her. \"Barstow, this is my daughter, Sheryl. Sheryl, meet your roommate, Rae,\" Coach Yoast motions between her and his daughter. \"Nice to meet you, Rae,\" Sheryl replies, but Rae could tell that it was kind of forced. \"You as well, Sheryl,\" Rae returns back with a handshake. \"Good to know I can talk football with a girl, and not just with Daddy,\" Sheryl says kind of smiling. \"Likewise,\" Rae responded as Coach Yoast led them to their room. The girls had barely sat down on their beds when they heard shouting from the hallway. Rae and Sheryl peeked their heads out from the doorway. \"What's goin' on?\" the little girl asked. \"I don' know, but stay inside. I'll go check it out,\" Rae warned. \"What?\" Sheryl complained. \"Your daddy would kill me if you got hurt in this crowd, and I was supposed to be watching you, so stay here, okay?\" Rae explained. \"Fine,\" the girl pouted and Rae went to go investigate. \"What the hell?!\" \"Whoa girlie, you don't wanna go in there,\" someone held onto Rae's shoulders and she turned around to see Rev holding her back. \"What happened?\" she asked. \"Not sure, but Julius and Gerry are rooming in there,\" he pointed over the crowd of guys. Rae wiggled out of Rev's grip and wormed her way to the center. \"Who started it?\" she asked over the shouting. One of the white boys, a bit caught up in the fight, didn't notice her but answered. \"Don't know, they just started arguing…\" He didn't finish when everyone started backing up and gave Julius and Gerry space to tussle. Not three seconds later, a pained cry echoed through the hall and the crowd went silent. Apparently, Gerry had accidentally punched Rae in the face, where a black eye would soon form. He was aiming for Julius, but missed and hit the girl instead. There were hisses from both sides until black and white started to go crazy on each other. There were shouts from both sides blaming each other. \"What is going on here?!\" Coach Boone's voice bellowed and got everyone to quiet down. \"A bunch of tough guys, huh?\" He paces up and down the room where the coaches are standing in front of the players. \"You look like a bunch of 5th grade sissies after a catfight. No offense, Barstow,\" he replies, taking a quick glance at the girl with a blooming black eye. \"None taken,\" Rae responds quietly. \"You got anger, that's good. You're gonna need it, son,\" Coach Boone says to Julius with a hard look on his face. \"You've got aggression, that's even better. You're gonna need that, too,\" he directs this at Gerry who gives him a hard look back. \"But any little two-year-old can throw a fit. Football is about controlling that anger. Harnessing that aggression into a team effort to achieve perfection!\" He continues his speech. \"No some coaches, they cut a player if they think they're not up to snuff. When they think the player is hurting the team,\" he lectures on. It is dead silent in the room. \"But this is a public school program. I will never, ever , cut a player who comes to play for me. But when you put on that Titan uniform, you'd better come to work.\" He finishes his lecture with the following ultimatum. \"We will be perfect, in every aspect of the game. If you drop a pass, you run a mile. You miss a blocking assignment, you run a mile. You fumble the football, and I will break my foot off in your John Brown hind parts…and then you will run a mile. Perfection!...Let's go to work.\" ","Summary":" Hey it's me, fictionfangirl1, and I'm back with another story with an OC insert.

CG; I'm here. JC; I'm here. Freddy; I don't want to be here. CG; Tuff crap asshole. Ya got no choice. Freddy; (Grunts) SG; Guess what? CG passed here brown-white belt for karate. CG; yea, I will have to give credit to Freddy, for being my punch bag. JC disclaimer. JC; Owners Cynder not ME! CG; alright, chill. Intro I can never forget who could? I am the last. They hunted us. My magic couldn't save her, I couldn't save her. I can see her in my dreams, what fate awaited her. Her blood spilled on this earth. They say my heart is cold and dead. Since I was a child I believed them, my skin is as cold as death. They thought I had no emotions, but the day I found out my sister was dead, I shed my tears. My sadness was known, my tears turned into flames and the flowers around me started to die. The rain started falling and purple lighting started forming, my body started forming fire, a cold burning flame. I screamed into the starless night, my fire exploding. I hugged my form, as my fire started dying off. This is what my emotions can cause; a land full off blossomed trees burned, they died from my emotions. I wasn't in control, my emotions spoke for me. The next day I went to school, the children started bullying me again, the leader slapped me. I clenched my fist and used my magic. I grabbed her wrist in a bone crushing grip. She yelped in pain and stared into my eyes, but all she saw were her fears, I could see them as well. I used emotions and fears to break her down. I now do come to realize that what I used that day was 'childish fears' a dark gift that can reveal another's worst fears, its magic I didn't know I possessed. That day was about two-hundred years ago, in Victorian ages. I have been living for over two-hundred years. I don't age like a human, in fact, I'm not human. I visit those who are ready to die, if you deserve another chance then I will grant you that chance. But the souls of the wicked see me, a dark shadow; I feed of your predators, their blood flows on your land. I wear a haunting black dress. My hair is always down; dead leaves sometimes entwine themselves in my roots. My skin, barley holds colour but my touch, some people say \"touch of death.\" My skin is so cold. My eyes are yellow. My wings are like a demon, but are torn. Where the crows fly, and the flowers die. Where the trees lie fallen, and the sun never shines. Where the abandoned house stays on sinister land, and the lives of men coat the ground. You find me there. In my eyes, my heart is broken, not dead. My magic won't heal the cracks.

He soars through the skies looking for his next victim. He eyes someone down below him; a young girl taking out some trash. She appeared to have trouble with the heavy bag. A perfect opportunity for the Creeper to strike. He begins to fly downward, closing his wings to pick up speed. Then suddenly, he is hit by white fire. The attack sends the Creeper plummeting down to the ground. Infuriated, he looks around to find the attacker. A young boy, with long hair and a huge tail. The Creeper quickly flees. The boy chases right after him, hot on his heels. Finally tracking down the Creeper to an abandoned warehouse, he breaks through the window. He listens for any noise that the Creeper makes. Then he catches its scent, coming from the upper rooms. Thinking quickly he charges through the walls, tackling the Creeper. The Creeper wasted no time to retaliate. They both charge at each other, getting into a power struggle. The Creeper grabs the boy by his neck and flies upward, breaking open the roof. Once he is high enough the Creepers flies back down, sending the boy crashing into the warehouse. The boy quickly recovers and wraps his tail around the Creeper's leg, tossing him into several walls. His time quickly running out, The Creeper hisses at the boy and flies away into the sky. The boy tries to jump after him, but The Creeper is already too high. Then without warning, The Creeper tosses a shuriken into the boy's chest. The boy falls down in pain, as he slowly pulls the shuriken out of his chest. Whatever that weapon had on it severely weakened him. He couldn't chase after the Creeper any longer. The boy glared up at the sky, silently vowing to stop this monster's terror at all costs. 23 years later…. \"That'll be $30.46, sir.\" \"(*Pays the clerk*) Alright, take care now.\", Ketsueki said as he takes the bags. \"You too.\", the clerk says with a smile. Ketsueki walks out, and heads back home. Virginia wasn't too big, so it's fairly easy to navigate around the city. He made sure to follow the path he came though. The last thing he wants to do is become lost. He keeps along the street curb for the rest of his walk. About 20 minutes or so later, Ketsueki hears a truck blaring its horn behind him. He turns slightly to face the truck, and then turns back around. Ketsueki steps onto the sidewalk so the truck can pass. As he continues to walk, he can still hear the truck on the side of him. Confused, he pretends to stop and ties his shoes. Once he stopped, so did the truck. Now knowing that the truck is purposely following him, he continues walking. The truck kept following Ketsueki for what seemed to be forever. Then out of nowhere, the truck sped off. Ketsueki paused for a moment. \"What the hell was his problem?\", Ketsueki muttered to himself. Ketsueki watches the truck drive away, making sure it actually leaves. Then he walks home in a different direction. Ketsueki continuously listened around to ensure that he wasn't be followed. 30 minutes later he finally reaches home. He goes to sit down. And thinks about what just happened; Why was that truck following him like that? Why did that person blare his horn for no reason? These questions had 3 possible answers; 1. That person is some sort of creep./ 2. That person wanted to find out where he stayed. Possibly to rob him./ 3. Both. After his encounter with the man in the truck, Ketsueki decided to go to the police to investigate who he was. They have him describe the truck to them. He explained that since he was blind, he could only hear the truck. With this limited information, the police just decide to search the area for any suspicious truck driving around.

But thanks to every reviewer who reminded me. Not sure how many of these segments there will be, or whether or not they will cross into the second movie. In any case, enjoy! Sorry it's so short. By the way, if you haven't read the alternate ending, this story probably won't make much sense. Trish wondered through the streets, her head down. It had been the third day and she was still just as uneasy and upset as she was the first time. However, she had yet to find a way out of the trap she was in. I have to keep him alive, no matter what it takes. The first time she went out, she failed to find anyone for the Creeper. As punishment, he cut off one of her brother's fingers. The sight sickened her, to say nothing of his screams. From the outside, she looked calm, but it was easily seen through if you knew how to look inside. Let's see: my instructions were to bring back a young man, between 20 and 30 years old, has to be healthy. Trish shed a single tear as she reached into her bag. She took out a syringe meant to knock the intended victim unconscious and hid it within her palm. After a few minutes of wandering around, she walked into a bar, knowing it was the easiest place to find what she was looking for. \"So what can I do for you, Ma'am?\" The bartender asked, bringing the barflies' attention to her. \"Do you have some Dr. Pepper in stock?\" Trish asked, although she was sorely tempted to drink. She looked him over, analyzing him. He's the right age, but doesn't fit exactly. I can't afford to make a mistake. He nodded and poured her a glass. \"Put it on my tab.\" A man told him, and turned toward Trish. \"What's a sexy lady like you doing here?\" His teeth were almost bright yellow, and he smelled like he hadn't bathed for weeks, so Trish did her best to ignore him. He continued talking but she drowned him out, drinking her Dr. Pepper. She looked around and found someone who fit what the Creeper asked for. She approached the man and smiled. \"Hey, handsome, can you give me a hand?\" \"Sure, uh…what's your name?\" he asked. \"Trish,\" she replied, figuring it wouldn't hurt to tell him. She smiled and told him to follow. \"So what do you need help with?\" he wondered. \"Name's Tyler, by the way.\" He held out his hand for a few seconds before lowering it. \"You look troubled; what's wrong?\" \"I'm just worried about my brother.\" \"What's wrong with him?\" \"He got into a car accident; he's hurt pretty bad. We think he'll make it, but the doctors aren't sure.\" Trish really, really hated this job. She glanced at him and felt a certain attraction, making her regret even more what she had to do. \"That's too bad; something similar happened to my brother a couple years back. Me and dad still aren't sure what happened to him.\" \"Did he recover?\" \"Yes and no; don't want to get into it.\" They walked to the Creeper's truck. \"So is this what you needed help with? At the least, this truck of yours needs a paint job.\" \"Actually, I didn't need any help, not really. I just brought you here because…\" Trish put her arms around his neck and kissed him soundly. He kissed back after a momentary hesitation, pushing her against the door. Tyler stopped the kiss, catching his breath and smiling, but before he could say anything, Trish injected him with the compound. He fell to the ground. Trish opened the door of the truck, and with difficulty, hauled him into the passenger seat. She hopped into the driver's seat and started the vehicle. Despite its beat-up appearance, it ran quite well, which made her wonder just how intelligent the Creeper was. It took about half an hour to get to the factory. She got out, and grabbed him by the arms, straining with his weight. Trish's eyes were glinting with tears, wondering what kind of monster she was starting to become, but nonetheless, she completed her task. This was the part she dreaded the most. \"Okay, I found what you were looking for.\" The Creeper walked towards her, studying her and Tyler carefully. She was barely able to breathe out of fear. He simply stood there until he finally said: \"Acceptable; dismissed.\" Breathing a huge sigh of relief, she run to the room where her brother was chained up and hugged him tightly. When she wasn't running \"errands\" for the Creeper, she spent most of her time with her brother. \"So good to see you; are you all right?\" Trish asked. \"Well…I've been better.\" Darry moaned. The Creeper made sure his wound was not lethal, but even so, he was in an enormous amount of pain. \"I'm sorry I dragged you into this, Trish.\" \"Look, none of this is your fault. I tried to convince him to take me, but he won't.\" They heard Tyler's screams echo throughout the factory; Trish broke into full tears. \"None of this is your fault, sis.\" Darry tried to comfort, his head on her shoulder, trying to help however he could. \"That thing is terrible; why is he doing this?\" \"I have no idea.\" \"Look, I can't watch you destroy yourself anymore. Just get the hell out of here; it doesn't matter what happens to me. I'm your brother; I'm supposed to protect you.\" \"Not a chance in hell; I am going to keep you alive and that is final! I don't care what I have to do.\" She was unable to continue, curling into a ball as the last of Tyler's screams subsided. \"but you do care, don't you? It's tearing you apart inside, Trish!\" \"I know, I know. Even if we get out of this alive, I'm going to have to live with this on my conscience for the rest of my life.\" \"Look, you want to blame someone, blame him. He's the one forcing you to do this. Look, I saved you some food. You need to eat.\" Trish's first instinct was to say no, but her hunger wouldn't let her. She gulped down the food. Ordinarily, she would have simply thrown it away, but due to their current situation, neither of them could afford to be picky. \"I wonder what our parents are doing.\" \"Probably going crazy, wondering what happened to us. Maybe they even think we're dead; not like there's any evidence to the contrary.\" Both of them stayed silent after that, not knowing what else to say. I'll get you out of this Darry, somehow. Trish said to herself. Even though the screams were gone, even though neither of them were talking or even moving, one word echoed in her ear. Murderer! Hopefully, this will be something resembling an apology. I'll be adding to this story whenever I get a sudden inspiration. However, I'm not sure how often that will be, and I'm not about to lie to you. In any case, I hope you enjoy. ","Summary":" Wow, I have to admit, I nearly forgot I wrote an alternate ending at all.

I would like everyone to Review if they can and give me some pointers. This takes place the days before the first Jeepers Creepers movie and gives a little more light on what happened. Thanks for reading. Oh and sorry if there are spelling mistakes, I don't have Microsoft word yet and I don't have a spell checker. Enjoy David Henderson hated driving. Simple as that, he hated everything about it. Stacey Butler, his class assistant at the Poho Community college, lost her license; it was probably due to zero tolerance. (Hint: She's not 21) He wasn't extremely fond of Stacey, but the problem was, they had a project. Fuck the project. It's never going to accomplish anything, especially not their relationship; they were just two different people. They had a week to do what they had to, then hopefully they would never have to be in the same room, excluding class room 256, again. David, of course, thought Stacey was crazy, but why wouldn't he? She suspected serial murders in the county for the last 92 years. Her idea was crazy. She noticed a \"pattern\" of murders in Poho that happen in Spring, every 23 years. David believed this \"pattern\" was more coincidense, he figured that murders happen all the time and just because there were some missing people in Spring, doesn't mean their is a crazed killer hanging around abducting people. It appeared she was just trying to make an edge piece go in the middle of a puzzle. \"You don't have to stay quiet.\" Stacey suggested. \"Just concentrating on the road.\" David answered. He looked over at Stacey and noted her small comperhention notebook sitting upon black skirt. He wondered why she wore it today. It was a tad cool and the wind was stronger than most days. \"It's Poho, it's not like there is the Sears tower to look at or the mountain side of the Appalachins\" She fired back, but with a small grin on her face. \"I'm not exactly excited about driving, to be honest.\" David explained, still starring at the road side. \"Why is that?\" Stacey asked while pulling back her think brown hair. \"That's a boring story, I'm sure your \"pattern\" is much more exciting.\" David snapped back with a mocking tone. She looked over at him and gave him a sort of sigh, it wasn't what he expected. \"You know, it's not like I made you do this with me.\" Stacey responded, looking down to the diry floor board of the 1998 Chevy Tahoe. \"You know I need the extra credit in Hapka's class, then you caught me on the spot to be your partner, so of course I said yes. I didn't expect you to pick something so off the wall.\" David said in the calmest voice he could say it in. \"Look, I really think there is something going on, I looked through newspapers,\" she began to count on her fingers, \"...through some police record, that they would let me look at, I even did a little research online to see, and it all matches.\" David thought for a minute about what she said. He took it all in. He finally thought of a question, one that was so simple, maybe if she could wrap her head around it, she would put this to rest and they can do something else for extra credit. \"So you're saying: For the last 92 years in this county, their have been murders that occur ever 23 years, but there have only been confirmed missing; not dead. Plus, if these weren't coincidense, which I think they are, wouldn't the guy have died, how long has it been since the last 'pattern' occured?\" David asked, feeling confident. He fixed his glasses to rest easier on his nose. \"About 23 years.\" She answered. David once again took in her answer before responding. He was a very intellegent man, he thought of his answers carefully before making a fool out of himself. This was important to him. He didn't believe he was attractive. Most people would tell you differently. He had short, light brown hair. A very fair face; he wore glasses, but he hated them. He couldn't stand anything at all near his eye. He wasn't a very confident man, well not confident in his looks at least. His brain was a brain most people would want. He was logical and very smart. \"Well, by your logic, the murders/missing persons should start up again, correct?\" \"I suppose, unless you are correct and he's dead.\" Stacey said in a soft voice. \"I'm not even saying the guy is dead. I'm saying all of this is by shear coincidense and these missing persons are not interrelated.\" The car was now quiet, both Stacey and David were silent for awhile. David soon began to feel bad. David could be a harsh man, but he still didn't like making people feel bad, even if it is someone he didn't exactly like that much. \"I'll tell you what...\" David began. \"...I'll humor this idea, and will treat it as if I believed it. Who knows, maybe I'm wrong, but you can't make pieces fit that aren't there. I want you to have a reasonable outlook on this, deal?\" David glanced back at Stacey to see her expression. Stacey stopped looking down at the floor mats of the Tahoe, and looked back up at David. She gave a grin, and her even prettier face lightened up even more. \"Thanks.\" Stacey began, still having a smile on her face. \"It does mean a lot to me.\" \"Look at this asshole that's right on me.\" The large green truck was inches away the Tahoe; the horn on the truck was loud and the person would not stop laying down on it. They used it very freely. \"Just let him pass you!\" Stacey said paniced. The truck was swearving on both lanes of the road, acting like it wanted to pass. \"He's not exactly friendly is he?\" The truck hit the back end of the Tahoe. It caused Stacey and David to jolt forward in their seat. A thought suddenly hit David's head. \"Hold on.\" David said while jerking the wheel to switch lanes. The tires screetched across the road, leaving tracks. They were now driving the opposite way of the green truck. The truck obviously had no real interst in them. They continued driving. Both of them were breathing heavily and Stacey's hair was a complete mess. \"Where are we going?\" Stacey pondered. \"I seen him pull out somewhere. I'm going to check and see if anyone else is home and maybe we can get some information or at least tell someone that some asshole is ramming people off the road. Are you okay?\" David asked, actually seeming concerned for Stacey. \"You care? You always seem like you don't really like me.\" David sat there, quiet of course. He didn't really know what to say at that moment. Did he like her? Even as a friend? He felt that she wasn't extremely logical on how she acted. When he heard that she lost her license for underage drinking, maybe he judged her a little too hard. Maybe she's not as dumb as he suspected her to be. To be honest, he felt that she was mentally strong for keeping to her accusations. \"It's not that I don't like you. I felt that when I heard about the underage drinking, maybe you weren't the smartest individual and you didn't belong in the class if you make a mistake like th-\" Stacey began to interupt. \"That's what you think happened?\" Stacey asked with her mouth curve to her right side, she seemed to do that numerous times if she was puzzled about something. \"I'm just repeating what I heard.\" David answered. \"I didn't figure that would get around. I guess I should explain. I didn't lose my license, I never had it. I was asked to go to a party from a girl, Meagan Vipper, I don't know if you know her, well I didn't want to go, and I guess, this is going to sound really dumb, but I told her I lost my license for drunken driving. I know it was dumb, but I guess I'm still like one of those girls at high school that want to be somewhat popular. I know it was really stupid though.\" Stacey said, she was obviously upset about it, and David knew that. \"As hard as it may be for you to believe, but I understand.\" Stacey looked up at him; she didn't look him straight in the eye, but far enough to see if he was being true to what he was saying. She gave a slight grin on her face, emotions had been everywhere in the last few minutes. More than should probably be going around after an incident like they had. They continued talking and after awhile. There was a mutual respect between them both, and they actually got to see a glimpse of each other's true personalities. Before they realized it, they were where the truck pulled out at. They looked around the place for a moment and seen an old church.

Jack Taggart, sentado en su desvencijada y querida vieja butaca, aspiró lentamente por la nariz, inhalando el aire rural cargado de la creciente cantidad de polen que avisaba, sin resquicio de duda, de la inminente llegada de la primavera. Sus ojos, antaño claros y brillantes, ahora presentaban una molesta capa blancuzca que iba creciendo conforme avanzaban los años, inflexibles en su recorrido de desgaste por el cuerpo del hombre, mermándole la vista y generándole una permanente sensación de pesadez general al esforzarse tanto por enfocar cualquier cosa a más de dos metros por delante de sus narices. En América, si no tenías un seguro médico, no te operaban ni de algo tan simple como unas puñeteras cataratas. Y Jack Taggart, que había sido granjero toda su vida, no podía pensar en costearse una operación que le impediría hacer vida normal durante un período de tiempo, si breve, vital en sumo grado en relación a la fecha a la que estaban. Veintitrés años. Veintitrés años de espera, aguardando el día en que aquel engendro despertara de su estado de hibernación para, finalmente, acabar con él de una vez por todas. Los despojos… de ésa cosa, ahora poco más que un triste pellejo polvoriento y desinflado, eran imposibles de destruir. Lo habían intentado de todas las maneras posibles: troceándolo y echándolo al fuego, metiéndolo en una cuba de ácido sulfúrico, dejándolo al sol para que se pudriera… y nada, la carcasa de piel aquella se regeneraba sola, era ignífuga, resistía el ácido y no se corrompía. Eso sin mencionar los movimientos espasmódicos acompañados de ruidos de succión que la cosa emitía cada vez que atentaban contra su integridad. Jack y su hijo, un adolescente por el tiempo en que cazaron a aquel ser demoníaco, no habían tenido muy claro qué rayos hacer con aquel bicho hasta que la vidente ésa vino a hacerles una visita. Vino en coche, irrumpiendo como una tromba en su casa sumamente alterada; decía llamarse Jezelle Gay Hartman y, además de haber visto \"en sus sueños\" lo acaecido con la criatura aquella, afirmaba que sólo se le podría destruir en su siguiente período de caza, no mientras estuviera dormido. Jack Taggart siempre había sido un hombre de creencias firmes, escéptico en sumo grado… pero en el momento en que la loca aquella le soltó lo de las veintitrés primaveras durante veintitrés días, las mismas palabras que le había oído decir a la chica rubia del autobús, Minxie, no pudo por menos que cerrar su enorme bocaza y escuchar lo que la mujer tenía que decirle. Y así había llegado hasta el día de hoy, teniendo muy claro que tendría que hacer frente a un monstruo cabreado en el momento en que éste despertara, atravesarle el corazón con el arpón que tenía preparado para, finalmente, cortarle la cabeza y rezar para que el engendro se descompusiera tras aquello… porque, de lo contrario, aun logrando retenerle e impedirle que se merendase a nadie en su período correspondiente de caza… tocaba esperar otros veintitrés años para volverlo a intentar de nuevo. Y Jack ya sería demasiado viejo como para andar persiguiendo bichos feos por todo el condado de Poho. Quedaba su hijo, Jack Jr… pero tampoco es que Taggart sintiera una especial inclinación por convertir esto en una macabra tradición familiar. La bestia era suya desde el mismo momento en que le puso las zarpas encima a Billy. Cada vez que lo recordaba, sentía la punzada de la culpa clavarse muy hondo en sus riñones como una maldita estaca imposible de quitar. Por éso bebía. Sí, el viejo Taggart llevaba aquellos veintitrés años convertido, además de en guardián de la bestia, en un jodido alcohólico depresivo hasta los mismísimos cojones del mundo, de los demonios que lo habitaban y de sí mismo. Se odiaba por no haber podido defender a su hijo pequeño, el que más semejanza física guardaba con su difunta esposa, del ataque de un monstruo de tiempos remotos que, sin ningún tipo de apuro, se lo había llevado volando para hacerle quién sabe qué aberraciones antes de… comérselo. La pobre criatura no había tenido más que diez años y aquella cosa repugnante se lo había arrebatado de su lado para siempre. Y Jack, impotente, le había visto alzarse sobre los campos dorados de maíz con sus alas membranosas llevándose a Billy mientras éste, desesperado, llamaba a su padre para que le salvase. Nunca encontraron su cadáver. Hasta éso se le había negado: poder darle digna sepultura al niño. Jack Taggart, furioso como nunca, jamás se lo había podido perdonar a sí mismo. Por éso resistía todos los días al pie del cañón, con el arpón a presión preparado por si acaso, dejando a su hijo al cuidado de la granja, sentado frente al pellejo crucificado del monstruo sobre la puerta del granero… - Lo siento, pero vas a tener que irte. Ya no se admiten visitas – oyó que decía su hijo de muy malas maneras afuera, en la entrada. Otro crío gilipollas que había venido a ver al famoso \"Murciélago del Infierno\". Joder, ¿es que no sabían leer?, habían cerrado ayer. El momento estaba demasiado cerca como para exponer vidas innecesariamente al hambre del monstruo. - Venga, tío. He venido de a tomar por culo de aquí sólo para ver la cosa ésa – oyó Jack que le replicaba una voz femenina con las mismas malas maneras – Quiero ver con mis propios ojos si es un tongo o no. - ¿Es que no sabes leer? \"El plazo de visita ha concluido\" – replicó Jack Taggart hijo con sequedad – Lárgate. - ¿Qué pasa? – se burló la voz femenina - ¿Se os ha podrido el bicho o qué? Venga, tío, sólo un vistazo… - ¡No me toques los cojones y lárgate de una vez! - Te pagaré el doble. Diez pavos. - Mira, guapa, si lo que buscas es pasar el rato a costa de dar por culo, has ido a dar con el tipo equivocado. Llevaban años exponiendo el pellejo del demonio como suplemento extra de ingresos ya que los precios en general habían subido con la crisis de los años 10 y la granja daba mucho trabajo y pocas ganancias. Venía mucha gente y a los críos les gustaba susurrarse los unos a los otros la leyenda urbana que ellos mismos habían ideado en torno a la criatura, a la cual habían bautizado, muy convenientemente, como \"el Creeper\" y alardear de haberlo visto. - Que te jodan, tío. – replicó nuevamente la voz femenina sin dejar de lado aquel tonillo de sorna. - ¡Fuera de mi propiedad!, ¡ahora! Hubo un instante de silencio y el viejo Taggart se sobresaltó en cuanto oyó ruidos de pasos apresurados acompañados de los bramidos furiosos de su hijo acercándose por segundos. - ¡¿Qué coño crees que haces?! ¡Ven aquí, me cago en la leche!, ¡ven aquí! Repentinamente, irrumpiendo como un montón de ladrillos en el interior del granero, la pequeña figurilla de una chica embutida en una sudadera negra con capucha que llevaba puesta de tal manera que le tapaba hasta las cejas, se precipitó de bruces contra el suelo lleno de paja para levantarse casi de un salto en cuanto vio a la figura considerablemente más alta de Jack Taggart Jr. perseguirla sumamente cabreado. El viejo Taggart contempló la escena surrealista de ver a su hijo, un hombre de casi cuarenta años, perseguir en zigzag a una micarraca cuarto kilo en shorts y deportivas que le toreaba como le daba la real gana escabulléndose, metiéndose en todos los rincones del granero y rodando por el suelo a fin de que el hombre no la pillara. - Déjala Jackie, que mire – se rió el viejo al ver que no la cazaba – Se lo ha ganado. Jack Taggart Jr., frustrado, bufó entre dientes como un gato escaldado al tiempo que propinó una buena patada a uno de los cubos metálicos rotos que había por allí tirados en el suelo. - Haz lo que te salga de las narices, papá – masculló el hombre dándose la vuelta para marcharse – Pero luego no quiero saber nada si la mocosa se hace pupa. No me responsabilizo de esto. Estoy harto de éstos críos tocahuevos. El viejo resopló con gesto de chufla mientras la chica salía de debajo de una lona y ésta, al ver al tipo alejarse, se echó a reír. - ¡Hasta otra… Jackie! – se burló. El hombre sólo se giró un momento para darle una mirada asesina y se marchó murmurando entre dientes otra más de su interminable retahíla de palabrotas. Sacudiéndose la paja y la suciedad que había adquirido durante su breve persecución, la joven le dio una sonrisa de oreja a oreja al viejo Taggart al tiempo que daba un silbido de alivio. - Eh, gracias – dijo llevándose las manos dentro de los bolsillos de su sudadera casualmente y echando la cabeza hacia atrás – Un poco más y me agarra de los pelos. El viejo asintió, divertido, y le hizo un gesto a la chica con la cabeza para que mirara lo que con tanto ahínco deseaba ver. Ella se volvió, alzó la vista y ladeó un momento la cabeza, confundida. Lo que estaba viendo o era real o era el tongo mejor escenificado que había visto en su vida. La criatura clavada a la pared, o lo que quedaba de ella, estaba entera de cuerpo, con las alas extendidas y crucificada como un Cristo mártir. Era una cosa arrugada, verdosa, llena de polvo, con cuatro pelos blancos y muy largos asomando por detrás de la nuca. Tenía garras en lo que debían de ser las zancas, pues aquello no parecían pies se mirase por donde se mirase; alas membranosas como las de un murciélago de una envergadura de dos a tres metros de longitud rematadas en picos, y la piel flácida y escamosa que lo recubría semejaba la de un reptil. - ¿No tiene cara? – preguntó la muchacha distraídamente. - Tiene una membrana oscura cubriéndola durante su período de hibernación – respondió el hombre como si aquello fuera la cosa más natural del mundo. - Pero está muerto… Los ojos de Jack se pegaron directos a la cabeza de aquella cosa. - No del todo – dijo sencillamente. - ¿Qué quiere decir?, ¿qué sigue vivo? – la voz de la chica denotaba una aguda nota de cinismo e incredulidad – Vamos, si éso sólo es la piel… seguro que lleva ahí más años que la leche acumulando mierda. - Veintitrés años hará ésta primavera – replicó el viejo. Ella se dio la vuelta. - ¿Cómo lo cazó? Taggart sonrió levemente y le dio un golpecito cariñoso a su viejo arpón, preparado en cualquier momento para dar en el blanco en cuanto el bicho aquel diera señales de vida. - Con esto – repuso enigmáticamente – Y con mucho aplomo y paciencia. No creas que cayó a la primera. La chica alzó las cejas en un gesto escéptico hasta que la capucha de su sudadera le rozó los párpados. - ¿De dónde salió la cosa ésa? - Parece ser que lleva mucho tiempo merodeando por nuestro mundo. Es bastante viejo. - ¿Y éso cómo lo sabe usted? - Oye, a mí no me mires. Me lo dijo una que decía ser vidente. – respondió Taggart alzando las manos sin dejar de sonreír. Quitarle hierro a un asunto tan serio como es custodiar un engendro en estado de latencia había sido siempre uno de sus méritos personales pese a saber lo muy amargado que estaba y las pocas ganas de vivir que tenía con aquel peso recayendo únicamente sobre sus espaldas. La chica sonrió y se aproximó al viejo. - ¿Por qué no ha enviado nunca una muestra de tejido a un laboratorio para que lo examinaran? – preguntó con verdadera curiosidad – Dicen los rumores que es indestructible, a lo mejor sacando algo de su ADN se podría ver la manera de \"acabar\" con él – dijo marcando las comillas con los dedos. Taggart enarcó una ceja. - ¿Y arriesgarme a que ésos doctores Frankenstein lo clonen y acabemos todos jodidos hasta las patas? No, gracias. La joven se echó a reír. Aquella era la conversación, con diferencia más extraña que había tenido en su vida con un completo desconocido. Le parecía un viejo simpático, un poco tocado del ala, evidentemente, pero simpático. - Son quince pavos – saltó el tipo de repente y sin venir a cuento. La chica se quedó un momento a cuadros. - ¡Pero si ponía que eran cinco! - protestó. - Diez por verlo fuera de plazo y cinco más por irrumpir en una propiedad privada sin permiso – replicó Taggart con una sonrisa torcida – Es justo. La muchacha bufó, se llevó la mano a una pequeña mochilita que llevaba a las espaldas, la abrió, sacó la cartera, contó quince y se los largó al viejo con un golpe seco sobre el arpón. - Es usted un viejo usurero, pero me lo he pasado muy bien – admitió la chica con una sonrisa de chufla – No deje que se le escape – añadió haciendo un gesto con la cabeza indicando los despojos del monstruo – Bye. Y, mientras la chica se alejaba para salir del granero, el rostro del viejo Jack se contrajo en una mueca sumamente seria. - Ten por seguro que no lo haré – murmuró acariciando distraídamente el arpón – No ésta vez.

Yes I know it sounds stupid and babyish for a sixteen year old to be afraid of something that never existed and can never exist, but I was very young when I saw the movie one night on TV and it basically traumatized me, so please try to understand this and bear with me. It crept upon me when I was only a child. Mama insists to this day that it was never my fault, that it was my uncle who allowed me to stay and watch. \"Uncle, what are you watching tonight?\" I asked, as I came into his room. \"A movie called Jeepers Creepers, one that will give you a fright, but if you have the courage enough, Desi, you may stay.\" A mistake was made that night, Uncle knew what was going to happen, he warned me, but he did not tell me to get away. I watched with morbid curiosity, as The Creeper ate, not knowing the horror that was going to be, at the end for me to see. My uncle told me, how the film would end, a man missing his eyes would be staring at me, but perhaps I wished to prove that I had courage and pressed on still. Then that terrible moment at the dreadful end, empty eye sockets looking at me. I gave a cry of fright, and ran out of the room for Mama, seeking comfort. At first Mama was stern with me but saw how this had affected me, and then she turned on my uncle and berated him for letting me watch something such as that. Sleep did not come easily that night. I could not rest, due to the fear The Creeper would catch me and take my eyes as well. At one point, I thought I heard wings flying over my bedroom, and I went to Mama for comfort, vowing I would never watch it again. Many years passed, and I grew up a lot, but fear unconsciously never really vanished. The second movie came on one day; a few months before I turned sixteen, thinking I could conquer my fear, I decided to watch it, even though Mama warned me against it. At first it was alright, I was doing fine, I jokingly referred to The Creeper as Freddy Kruger's brother because of the way he was dressed when on top of the bus. But Mama was right and she knew that something was going to happen, for a few scenes later a vision came forth from one of the girls, showing Darry without his eyes. I screamed and covered my eyes, for my fears were renewed all over, and a panic attack ensued. Mama helped me that day, comforting me trying to console me as I shook with fright, clutching one of my plush wolves for safety and security. I believe this fear will never go away, in fact just the night before, before our wrestling program, Smackdown came on, I turned it to that channel. Not being able to finish the second movie, my heart began pounding in nervous anticipation on what this was on the account of what the characters were saying, although there was no doubt in my mind what it was. Mama was out in the living room as well, and sensing all too well what this was, she told me to shut my eyes and don't open them for anything until she told me I could. Heeding her warning I did as I was told, shaking and quietly reciting The Lord's Prayer. When it was over, our suspicions were confirmed, it was as I feared. I am still very squeamish about certain deaths in horror movies, I will not look if someone's eyes are being gouged out, I cannot look and will not look, Yes I know it's just a man in costume and make-up but I still am scared after all this time. Now you know my story, and I hope you will not judge, but understand why I fear what I fear and will not watch those movies. So I hope I did well on this. I'm not very good at writing poetry, but oh well I tried. Now obviously my uncle and I did not talk like that, I was just trying to convey emotion. I'm also not Christian, but I used to be until my church got all fanatical and I stopped going. I have my own beliefs and faith which I follow, No this does not mean I'm a Satanist in case anybody out there is wondering! Anyway please review and tell me your thoughts, I will be continuing my WWE fic soon! Have a wonderful day!:D ","Summary":" I'm taking a short break from my fic The Confusing Wolf for a day to write a poem/story based on on"},{"Movie":"Jeepers Creepers","Title":"Eyes For Only You","Author":"Joy Pedler","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8421418","Passage":"[Chapter 1] The late afternoon sunlight shines in waves through the glass of the front room windows, leaving long shadows on the carpet. They lie slumped on a couch, draped across each other, melding into the touch of the other. Darry runs his fingers through her hair, running his nails across her scalp. She lies with her head on his lap, facing the setting sun, eyes almost clouded over with the sleepiness that arises when sunning yourself in the rays of the setting sun, having your scalp massaged and laying together with the one you love. It's the touch of Darry's palm to her cheek that prompts her to angle her head towards him. He smiles down at her and leans to connect their lips. She smiles into the kiss and places her palm on his cheek, rubbing the side of his face affectionately. When she turns her head back to the sun he lets out a small groan of disappointment, and moves himself so he is lying parallel to her, back pressed against the couch as she slides perfectly into his embrace. He fits his neck into the crook of hers and looks out at the sky along with her. \"It's so beautiful,\" she whispers, taking his fingers into her palm before pressing them gently to her lips. \"Hmm,\" Darry breathes in agreement, pressing his own lips to her neck. She turns her head back to face him. \"Do you have to go?\" she asks quietly, touching his nose with a finger. Darry sighs and sits up on the couch, pulling her with him. \"I have to Ali,\" he explains, seating her beside him as the sun slips behind a building. \"I haven't seen my parents in ages.\" Alice scrunches up her nose in an attempt to not cry. It strikes a chord with her that he hasn't asked her to come with. She'd like to meet his parents, and she has for a while, though he's never offered to take her with him when he visits. And that hurts, especially since, according to him, she's his world, his everything, what he would die without. He notices her indignant silence and sighs exasperatedly. \"Look, I've told you why I haven't taken you to meet them yet,\" he whines, pulling her onto his lap playfully. \"It's not the right time, but it will be soon.\" Alice rolls her eyes and tries not to giggle as Darry pinches her sides. \"Don't,\" she moans, swatting his hands away. \"I'm angry at you.\" Darry stops trying to tickle her and looks into her eyes seriously. \"Ok, how about I promise you this? After this time everything will be set and I can take you to meet my parents next month,\" \"Everything will be set for what?\" she asks, wrapping her arms around his neck and leaning close enough so their noses touch. \"Well I was hoping to ask my mom for the ring her dad gave her mom when he proposed when I see them this time,\" Darry explains casually. Alice's heart stops beating then starts again, at three times the speed it was going at before. \"A ring?\" she asks in what she hopes is a nonchalant tone. \"What do you need a ring for?\" Darry smiles at her, leaning his forehead against hers. \"To propose silly,\" he replies, flicking her forearm. \"To who exactly?\" she asks, her stomach in her mouth as her heartbeat gets faster and faster. Darry gives her a sarcastic look. \"Who do you think? You of course!\" he exclaims, momentarily shocked at her supposed naivety before realising his mistake when Alice fixes him with a killer withering look. \"Jesus Christ Darry you are the least subtle person I know,\" she says exasperatedly, before grinning widely. \"I do try,\" Darry replies sheepishly, running a hand through his hair. Alice whacks him on the arm. \"Where was the restaurant, the getting down on one knee, the romance?!\" she shouts, hitting him with each syllable. He winces and grabs her wrists to stop the barrage of slaps. \"Ouch! I'm sorry! I didn't realise you wanted that kind of stuff!\" Darry claims defensively, shaking her wrists. He slides off the couch and gets down on one knee. Alice rolls her eyes. \"Darry it doesn't count now that I've told you off for it!\" Darry shushes her and mimes pulling out a ring from his pocket. \"Alison Marie Richardson,\" he pronounces regally, taking her hand in his. \"Would you do me the honour of becoming my wife?\" Alice hesitates just to watch Darry squirm for a little while, wobbling on his one knee. \"Of course I will you moron!\" she finally answers, wrapping her arms around his neck. Darry stands and lifts her off her feet, kissing her as the final rays of sun disappear behind the buildings. Alice deepens the kiss as Darry places her feet back on the ground, leaning in towards him. Darry seems taken aback and pulls away. \"If I'd have known that romance gets you going we'd have gone on a whole lot more romantic dinners over the years,\" he says cheekily, running his hands over her arms. Alice shakes her head exasperatedly, but reconnects their lips anyway. She runs a hand up his shirt and runs her fingers along the tattoo on his stomach. He mimics her actions, sliding his own calloused fingers along the identical tattoo that adorns her navel. \"Second best decision ever,\" he murmurs as he pulls his shirt off over his head. \"First being?\" she asks as his gentle hands grasp the bottom of her shirt. \"Take a guess,\" he whispers as he lifts her shirt off, kissing her again. \"Hint: it's asking you to marry me,\" he says in a mock whisper that makes her laugh. \"I dunno, I think the tattoos were a life-changing decision,\" Alice replies as his fingers once again trace the outline of the ink black rose on her belly, before he kneels down and presses his lips against it. She entwines her fingers into his hair, and it is as the first stars start to come out that they lay down on the couch, identical tattoos pressed together. When Alice wakes up the next morning Darry is still there. Fast asleep on the couch with an arm draped over her waist. Her hair is a mess and lies in long strands across hers and Darry's shoulders, though he doesn't seem to mind, breathing in the scent of the hair she washed two nights before deeply as he sleeps. She stretches as the early morning sun brings a bit of light into the room then rolls over to face Darry, watching his peaceful face as he breathes in and out rhythmically. The strong muscles in his arm clench as he wraps an arm around her, pulling her closer to him, and she closes her eyes and leans into his chest, knowing she'll be happy waking up every morning to his face. The phone rings once, twice, before Alice answers. \"Hello?\" \"Alice?\" \"Trish? Hi, is Darry with you?\" There is a pause, and Alice knows Trish has moved the receiver away from her mouth. \"Trish? What's going on?\" \"Listen Alice I'm at Bob's, can you meet me there in 5 minutes please?\" \"Sure Trish, is everything ok?\" Another pause, another silence. \"Just come please.\" There's a click and Alice replaces the phone, and runs a hand through her hair. Darry had only been gone five days; he'd said he'd call when they arrived at their parents, though he should have arrived yesterday afternoon and was yet to call, so she was confused as to why Trish was here. It would have taken her at least a day to get back here. In any case, the best way to get answers was to meet Trish, so Alice slid one of Darry's hoodies over her head and left her apartment silently. Alice smiles at Trish as she enters the diner, sitting opposite her at the table. \"Hey Trish,\" she greeted her brightly, placing her bag on the table. Trish doesn't look up from the cold coffee that is sitting in front of her on the table. \"What's going on? I thought you guys were going to see your parents,\" Alice asked, smiling hesitantly, paranoia gripping her nerves like a vice. Trish finally looks up at Alice with wide eyes. \"Alice,\" she begins quietly, hands gripping the mug. \"I have bad news.\" Alice doesn't say anything. She doesn't say it but her first thought is that Darry's parents have said no to giving him the ring and their good wishes, but that wouldn't explain why Trish is back, looking like she's seen something horrible. \"What's happened, where's Darry?\" Alice demands, panic rising in her like bile. Trish takes a sip of the cold coffee, and Alice notices her hands shaking. As she places the mug back down on the linoleum table Trish glances around, nervous in this environment, as though in the last 5 days she'd seen something awful. \"Darry's gone,\" Trish says finally, tears immediately springing to her eyes, and she presses a knuckle to her cheekbone to stop them from falling. A chill runs down Alice's spine. \"Gone where?\" she asks before laughing nervously. \"This is a joke isn't it? He's gonna jump out any second right?\" she reasons, nails digging into the edge of the table. Trish looks to the side. \"He's gone. He was taken.\" She says simply, glancing down at her wrist to check the time. \"Taken? What the fuck does that mean Trish? Taken where? By who? Why?\" Alice demands, voice rising to the point that some people start to look in their direction. Trish places a reassuring hand on Alice's, now both of them are shaking. \"It's a long story,\" Trish says wearily, rubbing at the area under her eyes where visible dark circles lie like bruises. \"I've got time.\" Alice insists darkly, sticking her nails into the palms of her hands to stop herself from screaming. Trish pauses, as though choosing her words incredibly carefully. \"He was taken by the most evil being I've ever heard of, and I don't know where or why,\" she explains quietly, looking up at the cloudy skies that loom outside, weighing down on the diner like a wet blanket. \"All I know is that I tried but couldn't save him.\" She finishes softly, a tear falling down her cheek. Alice stares at the table top, taking in all the details of the surface, from the crude apple pattern to the stains left by past patrons as a way of blocking out what Trish has told her. \"He was getting a ring,\" she whispers, more to herself than anyone else. \"He was going to ask your parents for a ring so he could propose to me properly.\" Trish nods silently, and without another word she stands and pays for her coffee, leaving Alice sitting at the table, head down, arms limp at her sides. Somehow she gets home late in the afternoon, still too shocked to operate properly. She sits herself down on the couch in the front room and brings her knees up to her chin, wrapping her arms around them. It's the underwear that does it. Lying under a chair across from her are the pink boxers Darry had been wearing 5 nights earlier, dyed from a college prank. The sight of them, something so intimately Darry, is what breaks her. The tears leak out at first, eventually flowing without end, her silence turns to whines which turn to howls. She lays herself down on the couch, watching the sun set as she had with him only days earlier, though it's not the same. It's as if the world knows of her grief, of her loss, and the clouds that stretch across the sky, the rain that begins to fall, the wind that begins to whistle all sympathise, giving her noise and dark and cold to block out the world from the sounds of her broken heart. Hi, thanks for reading, I wrote this because I love to invent OCs who are the motivation behind the actions of characters in movies. (Don't judge meeee) and I couldn't help but think that Darry needed a love interest to add meaning behind a couple of actions. Um, if you want a song to listen to while reading I suggest either Blue Jeans ( watch?v=JRWox-i6aAk) or Born to Die ( watch?v=Bag1gUxuU0g) both by the incredible Lana Del Rey simply because I was listening to them while writing.

I only wrote the story… The wind rustled the old hay bales and filled the barn with their scent. His entire body was numb, similar to the feeling you get in your leg after sitting on it for a long while. After awhile the feeling returned after the annoying pins-and-needles feeling went away. He could hear voices, first just echoes then they slowly grew louder and clearer as his keen sense of hearing returned to its fullest. \"This thing isn't real…\" \"Just a fake…..\" He narrowed his eyes at these voices. They were obviously young teenagers with nothing but arrogance, but the next voice he heard make him bare his sharp teeth with anger. \"About 23 more days….give or take a day or two….\" He recognized this voice as the one of the old man who had supposedly killed him 23 years ago. This man he wanted dead. He wanted the feel of his flesh ripping between his teeth and his blood running down his throat. The thought of revenge made him want to jump from the wall where he hung like a museum display and rip the old man's limbs off, one by one. But he knew that patience was a virtue and that while these kids were here, he could do nothing. The sound of footsteps growing fainter made him anxious; he heard the last pair of footsteps shuffle out of the barn, the old man's. He waited for a few minutes then tried to move his arm, the one that had not been torn off in the pickup accident. He started to remember his last 23 days awake. A large yellow vehicle, children and their fear-scent. He closed his eyes as he remembered the ones he had killed and devoured, then the ones he had frightened into insanity. He finally found the strength to pull himself free of the wall and slowly crawled over behind the large harpoon that had caused him much grief before. He heard footsteps enter the barn and he took the risk of peeking behind the harpoon gun. It was the old one's son, who had aided him in bringing down the Creeper. His eyes burned with anger and he crouched down, ready to strike as the boy took one look at where the Creeper used to hang \"Pa! It's gone!\" He exclaimed. The man ran towards the harpoon, probably wanting to get ready for him, the Creeper thought. As the man ran up next to the harpoon he saw what was waiting for him and just as his eyes grew wide with fear, the Creeper smiled maliciously, flashing razor-sharp teeth. He jumped at him and held him down, despite being thin enough to show each bone clearly. He bit into the man's neck and felt blood gush out of the wound, he pressed down on the front of the man's neck, closing off his wind pipe. He felt the man struggle and gasp for air. His eyes looked like they were going to pop right out of the sockets and his face was turning blue. His body convulsed violently and gave one last struggle before lying still for the rest of eternity. The Creeper looked at what he had done and smiled triumphantly. He then proceeded to devour the man's left arm and both of his legs, happy with the feel of fresh flesh between his teeth. After he had had his fill he waited for his limbs to regenerate then stood up and stretched them out. He looked around and recognized the weed field he had snatched the young blonde boy up so many years ago. His head snapped around at the familiar shuffling of the old man's footsteps. He quickly ducked around behind the barn and peeked around the side, waiting. The old man stepped out of the swinging barn doors and stared in horror at his son's mutilated body. Tears of anger and hatred filled his eyes. He grabbed a spear with a corkscrew looking tip on it, the one he had stabbed the Creeper with repeatedly in the chest with last feeding. He looked around, his eyes filled with pure rage. \"Come on out and show yourself you horrible demon!\" He yelled, his old voice booming. This was going to be to easy, The Creeper thought. He went back behind the barn and flexed his large, bat-like wings to test them. They had grown back while he was feasting. He jumped high in the air and opened up the wings, they carried him well enough. He glided silently high over the old man's head, hoping that his shadow was seen, the fear-scent would be delicious on this one. He dived down, right on to the old man. He snatched him up then took off again, feeling the old man struggle but his old limbs were not strong enough to over-power the Creeper. His flight was fast and he landed in front of the old abandoned factory that he took in as his lair. The old man tried to run away once his feet hit the ground, but the Creeper's strong grip kept him in place. They walked through the old, flooded halls, knocking away cobwebs along the way. \"Let me go you monster!\" Yelled the old man as the Creeper threw him into an empty, windowless room. \"You killed my sons! Now I'm going to kill you, you bastard!\" with that he charged at the Creeper and tried to knock him over, but the Creeper was to strong for him. He swatted him to the side as if he were swatting an annoying bug away. The old man crashed against the wall, lying motionless on the ground. The Creeper smiled and walked away, leaving the old man more crippled than he was before. He entered a room where a pile of dissected and preserved bodies lay. He look towards a rack of crude, handmade weapons and picked up a dagger, sharp in his hands and crafted out of bone. He walked back into the room where the old man lie, waiting, looking up at the Creeper. He waited for that dagger to strike him, either fatally or just somewhere to cause him pain. \"Please….make it quick…I want to see my sons…..\" gasped the old man. The Creeper only smiled that malicious smile of his and held the dagger pointed downwards. He threw it off to the side and grabbed the old man's jacket. He dragged him into another room; he had plans for this one. The old man made no attempt to struggle; he had accepted death and felt no reason to fight back anymore. The Creeper dropped him in front of what looked like a metal examination table, although this one was covered in dried blood and dehydrated organs. He dropped the old man, knowing he wouldn't try to escape, and went over to an old wooden chest. He rummaged through the chest; it was filled to the brim with weapons and torture tools. He took out a rather strange looking contraption. It was made of rusted metal, giving it a very rough appearance. It looked like a saw, but attached on the end were three rusty, bloodstained knives. He walked over to the old man and picked him up easily, then set him on top of the table. He held the contraption over the old man's head, grinning ear to ear, and then plunged the strange saw into the old mans chin. He screamed in agony as blood poured from his chin and mouth, this was horrible pain, not enough to kill him though. The Creeper twisted the saw around, causing more pain and gushing more blood. He pulled it out very slowly, and then ran one of the knife blades under the old man's eye, creating a cut that dripped with crimson blood. He took the bloody tool and stabbed the old man in the stomach, above his belly button. He knew this would kill him once he pulled it out, so he let go of the handle, leaving it impaled in the old man's intestines. He walked into the prison room and grabbed the dagger, examining it, making sure it wasn't damaged. He stood over the old one and sliced his belly open, cutting only the flesh to reveal all of his vital organs. The old man's fear scent was overpowering and so was the stench of his fresh, oozing blood. The man screamed in horrible agony, the blood was covering every inch of his body, soaking his torn clothes and the dissection table. The Creeper smiled at his pain, and bent his head down an inch away from his organs and began sniffing. His nostrils flared open to take in even more of the scents. He sniffed every organ individually, working his way down from the old man's heart, down to his penetrated intestines. He repeated the process working his way up, ignoring the blood being splattered on his face from the old mans convulsions and thrashing. He stopped at the man's heart, which had an absolutely delicious scent; he bent even lower down and licked at the still beating heart. He looked the old man right in the eyes and slowly took his heart in his mouth, tearing it away as slowly as possible. The man cried out in pain and agony, his eyes began to grow pale and glazed over, his body thrashed around, making him grow weaker by the second. His muscles started to relax and he lay his head down on the table and stared up at the ceiling. The Creeper swallowed his heart in one gulp and smiled in triumph, revenge had been sweet….as sweet as the blood from the old one's heart. …more? If I get enough reviews I will write more on the Creeper….I just need ideas… Thanks for reading! ","Summary":" I do not own the Creeper, Jack, Jack Jr. or any other characters.

Hopefully it's not been done before. Disclaimer: I do NOT own Jeepers Creepers From the second I dreamed about Darry and Trish Jenner, I knew I had to help them. After dreaming so vividly about all the bodies that creature had killed, I just couldn't let them suffer the fate I had foreseen for them. I had spent eighteen days- eighteen long days- dreaming of the people it killed. Seeing their deaths and hearing their screams. Those screams would haunt me forever and I knew that if I couldn't save the Jenner's then their screams would also haunt me. It had taken a while to drive to the Poho County Police Station and darkness encased the car. I feared for my life but I feared for the lives of those kids more. The only thing that broke the silence was the barking of Rufus, my old golden retriever. He was sat in the front seat because I don't like him to be left alone, especially not on a night like that. I didn't like the still, quietness of the night but I daren't turn the radio on in case THAT song came on, blasting out it's lyrics as a warning and cruel joke to Darry Jenner- not that he'd understand it yet. I knew everything about that song. The way it was meant just for poor Darry because the 'Creeper'- that's what it was known as- wanted the eyes that saw it's 'House of Pain'. As soon as I'd arrived at the police station, I hurried inside, leaving Rufus in the car with the window down because I didn't want to take him in there with me. From the second I got in there, an officer was ordering me to leave but I was just pleased that I'd found the Jenners and I was in time to save them. They looked a little shaken but they were smiling. Darry had a bound hand- just like in my dream- and was examining missing person posters which all showed photos of the poor souls I'd dreamed of the past eighteen days. I explained everything to them. Everything I knew about the Creeper and what it did but I couldn't bring myself to tell them about the dream I'd had for them. Trish didn't seem to believe me but Darry did. He figured out I was the woman who'd phoned them at the diner. I relayed every piece of information I knew- which was more than I'd thought. A shiver ran through my whole body when I'd told them that 'Every Twenty Third Spring, for Twenty Three Days, It gets to eat.' It wasn't long before the lights went out and I knew the Creeper had found us. The emergency lights came on, providing some shelter from the biting dark. We were in a 'lockdown situation'. When Officer Tubbs and the other officers went to sort out a situation- no doubt one they wouldn't be returning from- I led Trish and Darry away, attempting to get them out. I didn't know where to take them or if we'd survive the night but I had to try or God would never forgive me. I'd never forgive myself. Gunshots rang through the whole station, toy soldiers firing their toy guns at an undefeatable enemy. The door we came to turned out to be locked, automatically shut in the lockdown. I hadn't foreseen it but it looked like my dream was more likely to come true. My only hope was to send Trish and Darry upstairs even though the Creeper had gotten them up there in my dream. Everything had gone quiet now, draining all hope of the fate of Tubbs and his officers. I just hoped Trish and Darry would come out of this better than they would. Darry was demanding to know if my dreams were ever wrong until the Creeper shot around the corner, making my heart skip a beat. \"Get upstairs!\" I ordered because it was the only chance they had. They obeyed and the Creeper started creeping along the wall towards me. I was frozen, too scared to move and trying to push that fear deep down to a place where not even the Creeper could smell it. Not that such a place existed. I kneeled down and started praying. Uttering the Lord's Prayer but not for my benefit, for the benefit of the two kids upstairs. When I looked up, he was gone and I stood up, hoping he hadn't found them. Suddenly, a cold, rough hand closed over my head, bending it back. I screamed as the Creeper sniffed at my neck and face. Burying my fear was impossible and the Creeper shoved me to the ground and started towards me, a cruel smile on it's grotesque face. It had clearly forgotten all about the Jenners so in some way, God had answered my prayers. I was on my feet in seconds and running back the way I'd just come but the Creeper easily caught up with me and dragged me down the corridor towards a window. I didn't scream because I didn't want those kids to be lured back downstairs. The window smashed, showering me in smashed glass and before I knew it, I was so far above the ground I got Vertigo. I was closer to heaven than I'd ever been before but I was in the arms of a devil. That was the moment when I knew I was going to die but at least I'd saved Trish and Darry. They'd get to live full and long lives. This was how things were supposed to end. In my eyes anyway. ","Summary":" AN: This is a oneshot I thought of whilst watching Jeepers Creepers.

Or, he was assuming that he had been. It had been daylight when he first caught a glimpse of those wings, spread out as it took to the air behind him. Since then, it had turned dark, and now if he looked to his side he could see daylight on the horizon, between the houses and trees that obscured the city's view of most of the skyline. Another clue was the pain, the tightness, in his arms, legs... his whole body. He had to of been running a long time, because he did the likes of this on a daily basis. Perhaps not as fast, or frantic, but unlike now, his life didn't depend on how fast he went. No, it didn't depend on it even now, did it? This thing was playing with him, and he knew it. If it wanted to take him off, wherever the demonic beast so desired to go with him, it could. It was keeping up easily. He could hear the leathery beat of it's wings, and aside from the occasional car horn, it was the only thing he heard. It had never changed pace, never seemed to fall behind. It was right there, just above him, a few feet away. Going home was a thought continually going through his mind. But the other thought, was his son. He couldn't have been about five. What if that thing followed him home, and got him, too? He would fall to his knees and left the thing rip him apart then and there before he lead it home. No, he was doing just the opposite. He was running just as far away from home as he could. He already knew very well that he probably wouldn't see his house again, or his wife, or his son. Or his son's dog... it sent a pain through his chest worst than the pain in his legs. But if he wasn't going to see them again, then by God, he was going to do everything he could to protect them. Then he saw a picket fence just up ahead. He couldn't go any faster, but he took off up it as he hit it, and vaulted over the top. He felt the hands graze his back, felt the breeze come off the creatures wings as it was right over him. And just as quickly, his feet were on the ground and he was running again. It was closer now, right above him, but he didn't allow his dark eyes another glimpse of the beast. Before he got to the other side of the yard, there was a slight tug at his back, and then his feet were running on air. He gasped, shifting as he realized the creature had taken hold of his clothing and lifted him off the ground. His heart rate picked up, and the higher up he got, the dizzier he got, until he realized; it took hold of his clothing . He struggled a bit, then slid out of the trench coat, and collared white shirt he wore under it. He hit the ground hard, but he got up, and turned sharply in the yard. Again, he ran. He was slower now. His muscles had the time to relax, and it was difficult to make them go more, but he did. He took up another fence, but this time, the claws didn't graze his back. They took hold of him, digging into his bare sides before he even had the chance to get all the way over the fence. It only took another beat of it's leathery wings to pry free his weak grip on the top of the fence, and it took to the air with him. He groaned softly in pain, moving to try and grab it's claws, and pull free. Then it moved, and pulled him up closer, pulling an arm tightly around his torso, which effectively restrained his arms, and pinned him against it as it flew. He grimaced, looking down at the scaly gray arm clutching him. Now all the stories he had read, that his wife had dug up, about the Jenner girl who'd lost her brother to the monster, or the Taggart family, who had lost their youngest son to it, didn't seem so absurd anymore. It seemed almost ironic; he had been the first to tell his wife it was nothing but a load a bull, that the girl was probably on drugs, and the family just wanted to gain money and publicity from it. And the bus full of kids that was attacked, he had claimed were working along side the family for the sole purpose of pulling a prank on everyone. But now he knew the truth to it, and it was a little too late for that. But if he had known, if he had believed it, would it have really made much of a difference? He didn't think so.

I could feel the tight grip he had on me, there was no was I was going to escape him. Even if I did I would just fall to my death, the ground below look like a much better way to go then having him do whatever he was going to do to me. It was worth a shot I would rather fall to my death anyway. I started pounding away at his grip hopping I would hurt him and he would just drop me already. No such luck who was I kidding he got me and there wasn't anything I could do. I sat there helplessly listening to the noise his huge bat-like wings made. My mind was wandering from thought to thought. This couldn't be it there had to be a way out of it. It felt like we had been flying for hours I nearly fell asleep. He dropped to the ground and threw me hard on the ground. I let out a groan and rolled onto my back. He gazed down at me and smiled that wicket and unpleasant smile of his. I took a chance and rose quickly to my feet, as fast as I could I started running towards the road which was only a mere 10 feet away. He was too quick his hand connected with my head giving me a powerful and painful blow. I felt like my skull had just cracked. He smiled again and grabbed me by my hair and started to drag me inside to wherever we were. I kicked and struggled making it difficult for him to drag me inside. He was too big and strong for me. Of course it was hard for me to struggle this guy wasn't human; he was an abomination a disgrace against nature. He had to be stopped what he was doing was wrong of course it was wrong. I knew I couldn't do anything to stop him, it was my end, the life I lived would end tonight and I would face death. He took me into a room filled with human body parts everywhere. Immediately I puked because of the foul stench that pierced my nostrils, it was the foulest thing I had ever smelled in my life. I caught sight of a very large metal table and I knew then what he was going to do to me. He wanted one of my body parts to eat or regenerate or whatever the fuck this creature did. But which body part did I have that he wanted. My lips, my ears, what was his reasoning for taking me away from my sister. Wherever Trish was I prayed to god she was safe that he wouldn't fly back to the police station and take here after he was done with me. I gazed at the metal table in horror it had a bloodstains all over it. He yanked me to my feet so hard that my shoulder popped out of place. I groaned in pain tried to hold my now out of place shoulder. He wouldn't have that with one swift movement he popped my other shoulder out of place. I couldn't move both my arms without searing pain shooting through both of them. He threw me back on the floor and moved over to his table. I sat there groaning in pain from my arms and crawled away from him a bit. He rummaged through his materials and weapons for what seem like ages. I managed to crawl a good distance away from him. He took a dagger from his desk and held it in his left hand, his head turned and his eyes were now on me. Heavy footsteps came in my direction, I panicked and quickly rose to my feet, and before I could run away he came up behind me and shoved me against the dirty hard ground. My face connected hard with the floor causing my lip to crack. Blood started gushing out of my mouth. He once again grabbed me by my hair and dragged me towards the metal table. He yanked me up again and placed a hand at my throat causing me cough. He took his dagger and sliced open my yellow Bannon shirt. With his hand still on my throat his dagger ripped off my pants then my boxers leaving me nude. He threw my nude body onto the metal table and shackled both my hands and feet. I laid there for a good hour or two pressed up against the cold metal. I was so frightened I could hear him at his desk rummaging and sharpening his weapons. He finally leaned over me and smiled that smile of his frightened me so much. It was time for me to go through the worst pain I have ever experience in my life. Death was so close to me I could see it. He started off by smelling every single part of me starting with me head, down to my chest and in the lower areas. I kicked and thrashed against the shackles so that he wouldn't touch me anymore. His face was by my knee smelling and licking at my body. His smelling traveled upwards until it finally settled on my face again. He smiled widely as soon as he smelled and licked my eyelids. He took his dagger and roughly cut off my thin eyebrows. I started to shake violently out of fear and hatred, I hated him so much everything he did to people. Without warning his dagger tip slide under my eyelid and was yanked up. I cried hard as I felt my eyelid being cut off. \"AHHHHHHHH\" I screamed loudly. Minutes later both my eyelids were gone, I sat there whimpering and groaning wishing he would kill me before taking my body part he wanted. I finally realized what he was after; he had been after my eyes the whole entire time. \"JUST KILL ME PLEASE\" I begged. He plunged his dagger just above my eyebrow and popped out one of my eye. I screamed as my vision became blurry. All I could think about was dying and I just wanted him to kill me and end my suffering. It wasn't long before he popped out my other eye. Everything was dark; I didn't know what he was going to do next. I was in agony it wouldn't be long now until I died. Without eyes I was still able to feel and sense. How someone could live for a few minutes without eyes was a mystery to me. I screamed as his dagger sliced off my lower area. Why did he have to make me suffer like this? I kept telling myself it will be over soon, deep down I knew he wasn't going to let me die just yet. Twenty minutes later relief overtook me, there was no more pain and I felt nothing, heard anything, saw nothing. Finally I was dead or at least I thought I was. Was this what dead was seeing, hearing and feeling nothing. To my surprise a flash of light appeared in front of me giving me my eyesight back. I glanced around my surrounds and realized I was still in his room. It was strange though my yellow Bannon shirt and pants were back on and I had eyes to see out of. The strangest part was I was see through only a blur. I studied my hands and my body examining closely to my new appearance. I was in fact a ghost. A large light appeared in front of me it beamed through his roof and into the sky. Was this a ride to heaven? I didn't touch it didn't move, finally the light vanished and I was left in his room nothing but a blur. I was unsure of what to do so I stared at my lifeless body; he had taken my eyes and did something to the back of my head. I watched for hours as he cut up my body making my flesh and bones weapons. The small tattoo of a rose I had on my belly button was now a hand held weapon. Finally I had enough of watching him decapitate my body. My shadowy figure rose and disappeared through the wall into the sunny daylight. My goal as a ghost was to find a way of communicating with the living and warning them of the Creeper. I had to do it I didn't want nobody else to suffer the same fate I did. Walking was the only thing I could do at the moment. I sat down on the edge of the road and looked into the tall cornfield that was behind me. This was were I was going to hide and warn the living. I walked into the cornfield not looking back at the life I once lived.

The embalming process [36 days] is official labeled complete and therefore will be ready for the funeral on the date above. The funeral will take place at the ceremonial house of Ms. Marthers. After the ceremony is finish the body will be taken to Yale Dales Cemetery where it will be properly buried. Signed, Harmony Carter ...x I thoughtfully bit the end of my pen as I read what I wrote four; five times wondering what else I could possibly write. I felt like there was something missing; do I write rest in peace or something at the bottom of my report in remorse for the now departed loved one of the Marthers even if I never knew the man. At that moment my nose picked up the all to familiar scent of the sweet smelling coppery tint and I slowly dropped my pen and swiveled around in my stool to look upon the lifeless body of Mr. Marther as he lie on a metal table in the middle of my work space. I sighed, closing my eyes drawing in the very tempting scent. I got off the stool and made my way over to the table and stood at its side; observing. Mr. Marthers had a white sheet that covered his body from the top of his stomach down. My eyes at first landed upon his calm face; his wrinkled features, his white brows and hair. I looked further down to analyze the accurate stitching that began at the base of his torso leading down somewhere under the sheet to his abdomen; which was obviously necessary to remove all the appropriate organs and replace it with other 'items'. I placed a finger at the tip of the stitching and gingerly began to run my way down the lining; admiring my work. I immediately averted my eyes back to his face, catching the faint traces of blood building up at the corner of his mouth and finally spilling over his lips. I watched entranced at how the crimson liquid made the journey down his cheeks ever so slowly and- I frowned at my thoughts and even caught myself slightly leaning over the table; as if about to lick the blood from his cheek. I recoiled, appalled by my urges and quickly backed off reaching for the blood stained towel on my desk to wipe the blood up with. Once the blood was properly cleaned up I covered the body completely with the thin sheet before rolling the table to a certain part of the room. There I pulled open a latch to reveal the small space in which bodies were placed in. I aligned the table parallel to the opened casket-like space; and with that I smoothly slid the table on the space removing the attachable legs as I did so. With that I pushed the body back in and closed the small door; securing the body safely. I rolled the metal legs to the side of my desk; leaving it there. I scooped up all the bloody rags and towels in my arms and proceeded to walk up the stairs, looking back once before flicking off the lights to my basement and emerging from the dark depths. With my right foot I lazily kicked the basement door closed and heard it firmly lock in place. [I had one of those heavy metal doors with the locks and password and everything. Strangely, in this world there are people called body snatchers; the name is exactly for what it implies. I take my job very seriously]. I stomped my way up the stairs [God! I have too many stairs] and walked down the hall to the laundry room where I dropped off my burden and hurriedly stomped back down the stairs. Oh, forgive me, I bet you all are in a stump. Your probably wondering what the hell are my 'urges'. Well it's only proper that I perhaps start from the beginning; you see for some odd reason I have a thing for meat and well, the smell of blood. Ever since I was little I use to gorge myself with meat and nothing but it. [Maybe not all the time though; I spare myself and health with some different foods]. The whole blood thing wasn't really a problem back then till now; seeing as I'm practically always around dead, bloody things everyday. Anyways, I and many other friends and family, at the time, thought that that was normal [The whole meat thing]. Sadly, as soon as I moved here and got this job [Embalmer] everything began to make a turn for the worst. I'm pretty sure that wanting to literally nibble on your 'patients' isn't anywhere near normal. On top of that weird 'things' began to take effect that I never knew about. Does all of sudden sprouting wings and growing claws/talons fit the bill of being weird and or abnormal? Once back on the main floor I made my way to my room where I walked over to my computer to turn it on. While waiting I sat in the chair in front of the computer and lifted my right hand before me. I squinted my eyes ever so slightly and used every brain cell imaginable to calm my nerves and concentrate. Slowly but surely black claws began to replace my once trimmed nails, adoring every finger with sharp tipped talons about an inch, give or take. I smiled. I'm getting pretty good at this concentration thing, I thought. All of a sudden a loud whooshing sound erupted from be hide me quickly followed by a loud crash. I abruptly stood up and looked over my shoulder to see black and gray [My wings?] I quickly turned around finding my computer and a vase that use to be on my night stand now on the hard wood floors; broken, shattered and now useless. \"Damn! I lost my concentration,\" I snarled, my wings on its own angrier flapping be hide me, reacting to my mood. It was practically inches away from knocking and thus breaking my child. [My precious television] I quickly took deep, even breaths seeing as I was more in control of my wild abilities when calm. I closed my eyes and thought happy thoughts and imagined myself without the additions and sure enough when I opened my eyes and looked over my shoulder; no wings! I looked down at my hands and smiled that they too were talon-free. The 'happy' moment was short lived when I sadly looked upon my ruined possessions. It's a shame I can't close me eyes and imagine that those would magically appear fixed and unscathed. . . . Or can I. I hurriedly closed my eyes and counted to three; on three I opened my eyes with a huge smile that instantly decimated into a frown at the items still lying on the floor. I sighed and looked at the computer first; it could be easily replaced. My eyes then landed upon the shattered blue and gold pieces that use to be a vase; sadly that on the other had been a gift from my mother. [Irreplaceable; it was truly one of a kind] She will be highly disappointed when she hears I broke her 200 something dollar gift. Ha, and what is my accuse: 'Uh, yeah my wing knocked it over'. Bah!

I know you haven't seen anything from me in a long while, but that's going to change, because summer's here! Nothing was coming to my mind in terms of what I could do for my stories, so I decided to delete all my unfinished ones (leaving one left that nobody really reads, anyway *cue weary sigh*) and start them over from scratch. Mixed Messages is the first. This first chapter is much longer than the original, and hopefully much better, too! Chapter 1: Moving In Laura stuck her head out of one of the backseat windows, more than a few locks of dark, auburn hair flying out of her ponytail and whipping her in the face. As her parents' car sped along, the businesses, restaurants, and large buildings of downtown gave way to a dirtier and run-down neighborhood; black kids, most of them her own age, stared as they whizzed by. The houses eventually became nicer and more cozy-looking, until black faces changed to white. As the car slowed, the faces became clearer and more incredulous, until finally they stopped. Laura's father stopped the car, and her parents stepped out. Her mother appeared in front of her. \"Come on, you lump,\" she said affectionately, and opened the door, ignoring Laura's cry as she nearly fell out of the car. \"We have to unload the commuter van (1) , and then go to your school, so we can find out what classes you have to take.\" Laura, by now out of the van, looked up hopefully at this. \"Do you think that they might let me join the football team?\" Her mother sighed and brushed Laura's hair away from her face. \"Maybe.\" Then she frowned. \"But I don't want a repeat of what happened in Mississippi. What possessed you to ask one of the most close-minded states in the country a question like that, I can only imagine.\" Seeming to get over this, she pointed to the back of the van. \"We can talk about this later; let's get back to unpacking.\" The strange thing was, Laura noted, as they went back and forth carrying various items, was that no one was to be seen. Oh, she would catch a glimpse or two of faces behind flickering curtains, but no one would come out of their houses and greet them. Suddenly, the reason came over Laura and hit her like a ton of bricks. She turned to her mother when they were outside, unloading one of the last items from the van. \"Mom?\" Her mother—who was pulling out a particularly stubborn box—didn't answer, but nodded to show she was listening. \"Why did we move into a white neighborhood?\" Her mother stopped pulling and stared at her. \"Wouldn't black people maybe be more understanding of our situation? I could understand if it wasn't by much, but they'd at least try. \" The older woman put the box down. \"Do you remember what it was like in Mississippi? How our family was ostracized, more than any black family? How Chiumbo had to struggle to survive each day, with almost no one's help? Oh, all the times we came close to losing him...\" She took in a shuddery breath. \"We—Chiumbo and I—chose this house to fight that. We as a family can legally buy the best house we can afford, no matter which neighborhood it's in.\" She gave a little half-smile. \"It also helped that I was the one who checked the house over with the realtor and brought the money to pay for it.\" She picked up the box and carried to the house, Laura following her with the last few packages. \"Hello, darling,\" Setting down the box, she kissed her husband on the cheek and took Laura's load away from her. \"Why don't you two go down to the school and get Laura's schedule and do the tour? I can meet the movers and help finish the unpacking.\" Squeezing her mother in a tight hug, she kissed her cheek and smiled. \"Thanks, Mom.\" Releasing her, Laura bounded out the door and climbed into the passenger seat, already buckled by the time her father was down the sidewalk. He chuckled as he slid in next to her. \"Anxious, honey?\" Smiling at the face his daughter gave him, he buckled and started the car, and they drove off. Keeping the windows up this time, she could see the faces rewind at top speed: white, nice house; white, less than nice; black, ghetto. Downtown was more diverse, but it was still clear exactly where the black and white stores were. Eventually, the schools began to show up, and her father stopped at a large, brown brick building. T.C. Williams High School. It was funny; it seemed more imposing in person than it did on a brochure. Perhaps that was the power of leaflets, she wondered, as she and her father walked up the almost never-ending sidewalk to the front door. Thankfully, it was unlocked, and they walked into the colder, cleaner—not to say that the outside wasn't nearly impeccable—interior of the building. The secretary looked up, eyes flickering over Chiumbo's obvious blackness. They widened as they took in Laura's hair, her green eyes and olive skin. \"How can I help you?\" she said awkwardly. \"My daughter should be transferred to your high school for this fall,\" Laura's father said quietly. The woman nodded smartly, regaining her composure. \"Name?\" \"Laura Eldon.\" \"Can you spell her last name for me?\" He did so, and her fingers flew across the keys. \"Ah, here we go.\" She glanced at him. \"Is your name, um...Chi-yum-bo...?\" \"No, it's pronounced Chee-yoom-bo.\" She took note of that. \"And your mother is Barbara Eldon?\" She stared at something at the screen, frowning a little. \"Yes. And she is white.\" He gave the secretary a very pointed look. She flushed, and began typing again. After a while, she asked, \"Are there any extracurricular activities you'd like to join?\" She looked at Laura. The girl grinned eagerly. \"Are there any spots open on the football team?\" \"You know, I think they accept players each year.\" She paused, typing for a few seconds. \"They have a three-week training camp for the players at a nearby university, and anyone who chooses to stay on after the camp is over, that's good enough, stays on the team for the rest of the season. There's an informational meeting in the gym on Wednesday at 2:30, and then camp starts exactly a week after, on August 1st. \" (2) Are there any other extracurriculars you'd like to take?\" Laura and her father shared a smile. \"Do you have any cooking classes, Mrs. Brooks?\" She'd sneaked a look at the plaque on the counter next to the woman. \"Yes, we do, actually.\" Mrs. Brooks glanced up at the pair in front of her. \"Why? Is there any particular reason?\" \"It isn't exactly one of my strengths...\" Laura began, and her father gave a loud bark of laughter, ignoring her glares.. The secretary smiled. \"I see,\" she finally said. \"Well, I'll have you signed up for those as soon as possible.\" She stood up from her desk and walked around, ending up next to them. \"Would you like to take the tour now?\" \"Of course,\" said Chiumbo. With that, they walked out of the main office and turned, going down the hallway. \"I had no idea that the school would be so huge!\" Laura said as she and her father strode back to their car, giving one last wave to Mrs. Brooks. They turned around, and her face grew sullen. \"But I'm going to be all over the place; all four of my morning classes are consecutively on opposite sides of the building, on the third floor (2) , and gym's right after lunch!\" She sighed. \"Between that and football—if I even get onto the team, that is—I'll probably have one of the worst classes in the history of this school.\" Chiumbo smiled, and patted his daughter on the back. \"Laura, this school is only eight years old.\" \"See? That only emphasizes my point!\" They climbed into the van, and drove off into the newly setting sun. The large, beige moving van blocked the driveway, and Chiumbo was forced to park across the street. As he and his daughter moved into the house, they ducked and dodged the bulky movers, and found Barbara amidst the flurry of furniture. She kissed her husband on the cheek. \"How was the tour?\" she asked, ruffling Laura's hair. The girl shrugged. \"It was alright. I mean, I don't exactly have the world's best schedule, but it seems like a nice place. And at least I'll have a secretary to turn to if anything goes wrong.\" Barbara smiled. \"That's my girl.\" Then she released Laura's head and stepped away from the other two. \"Laura, there are supposed to be people in the kitchen installing the refrigerator. Would you mind checking on them while I see how things in the parlor are? Thank you.\" Without waiting for an answer, she stalked away, dragging Chiumbo with her. Wow; thanks, Mom, Laura thought as she oversaw the movers fiddling with her family's appliances. The doorbell rang, bringing her out of her stupor. \"I'll get it!\" she yelled, ready to do anything to get out of her current situation. Weaving her way to the door, she opened it, and almost closed it again. For there, standing right before her (well, one was in a wheelchair), were two boys about her own age, one white, one black, and both completely unfamiliar to her. She stepped a bit further behind the door, ready to slam it at any second. \"Who are you? What do you want?\" They both grinned at her. \"I'm Gerry Bertier ,\" the white one in the wheelchair said, \"and this is my friend Julius Campbell.\" The black boy, Julius, extended a hand to her. \"Nice to meetcha.\" She shook it, and Gerry's, too. Laura let the door hang open now. \"I have to ask, though; how did you know I was moving in here?\" \"I saw your family come in earlier this mornin',\" Gerry said, \"and Julius and I both saw the moving van come in. I'm in your neighborhood, so I thought we should both come in and say hi.\" \"You two going to T.C. Williams?\" She had to stop herself from correcting her grammar slip, thanking the Lord that her parents weren't there. (3) \"'Course.\" This was Julius. \"That's the only place where a black boy and a white boy could be friends and expect to live. You goin' to school there?\" As Laura laughed, she couldn't help but notice the one thing Gerry and Julius seemed to have to have in common. \"Yeah. Are you both on the football team?\" She knew a letterman jacket when she saw one. \"If you lookin' to find a man there, I'm not really sure that's the best way to go.\" \"No, actually I was wondering if I could join.\" That put a stop to the boys' laughter; they stared at her. Gerry began running a hand through his hair. \"First black people, and now this.\" He chuckled as Julius hit him. (1): Vans like the one Laura's family has were called commuter vans, because they could hold fifteen or more people. The idea of having such a huge van just appealed to me, and it's really practical for moving, too. (2): Before anyone says anything, I know that camp started on August 15 th in the movie. And there wasn't an informational meeting, either, as far as I know. (3): Bad grammar really irritates me, and I've decided that it's going to irritate Laura's parents, too. I might include some 70's lingo that doesn't sound too stupid in the next chapter, but I don't know if that would make it sound fake or not. Well, that's it! This is a rewrite, so I'm really being serious when I ask you all to review and PM and tell me what you think about this chapter. It's going to be a lot more developed than the last story (Those of you who've read it will know what I'm talking about.), and much better. Trust me. -inspiration-arts[Chapter 2] So this is it, Laura thought, suddenly wishing she hadn't told her parents to park the car and let her go in by herself. She checked her watch; three minutes until the meeting was supposed to start. She took several deep breath that didn't help, tried clearing her mind of all thoughts, gave up, and re-checked her watch. Two minutes until the meeting was supposed to start. Well, it wasn't like standing out here was doing her any favors. She pushed open the door to the gym and walked inside, hoping that no one had noticed her entrance. Of course, everyone turned in their seats to look at her. They're probably wondering why I'm here without my brother, she thought, and that almost made her smile. Almost. Searching desperately for a friendly face, she found two in Gerry and Julius; even though she'd only known them for a few days (barely even half a week, in fact), it was unsurprising that they were sitting together. Luckily, there was an empty seat by Gerry, and she eagerly took the opportunity. \"Hi,\" she whispered to the people—all big, strong-looking boys (men?) that were probably on the team—at her table. They said nothing back, although Julius and Gerry did smile at her. Just as the silence was becoming extremely awkward, a microphone from somewhere behind her gave feedback, and she turned around, grateful for the diversion. A tall, lean, hard-looking (1) black man stood on a raised platform on the far side of the gym, two or three yards away from the wall. \"I,\" he said, \"am Coach Boone, your head coach for this season. As most of you know, for the past two years we've held a training camp prior to the beginning of each school year. This year, although the camp is still being held at Gettysburg College, and the students are still my two assistants Coach Yoast and Coach Heines—\" he inclined his head to the two men, one black and one white, standing behind him \"—and I have decided to extend the camp, and hold it two weeks early, on August first instead of the fifteenth, to ensure that team members have more time to prepare for the upcoming season.\" An outbreak of mutinous murmurings began, and Coach Boone held up his hand. \"Although camp has been extended, members of the team who are unable to come on that particular day will be able to arrive on any day from the first to fifteenth. Coach Yoast's daughter Sheryl will pass around a clipboard and pencil; anyone unable to come on the first should write down their names, their son—or sons'—name, and what day they'll be arriving. We'll resume the meeting in twenty minutes.\" He turned and stepped over to the other two men, and the boys around her stood up, going over to their parents. \"Hey, honey,\" Barbara said as Laura sat down at their table, and kissed her daughter's forehead, ignoring the looks she was getting from the other parents and students at their table. \"I like this camp idea. We probably have enough time to unpack the rest of our household items, and you can unpack some of your things and take them to the bus.\" She turned to Chiumbo. \"What do you think?\" \"I see no reason why this can't work; it's only a week away, and we have a week to prepare.\" He smiled. \"You can go on August first.\" \"Thank you!\" She leaped onto both of them and kissed both their cheeks. \"Thank you, thank you, thank you so much; you won't regret this!\" (2) The bus hit yet another bump, and Laura's head struck the back of its seat. \"Damn,\" she muttered, rubbing her head. She turned to her silent seat mate, hoping to get at least a word out of him. \"You're lucky you're so tall; you can at least catch before you fall to the floor.\" He smiled, but said nothing. \"So what's your name?\" Both of his hazel eyes looked into hers. \"Sam. Sam Kerrigan.\" Finally, an answer! \"What position are you playing?\" \"Either running back or fullback.\" He shrugged. \"Wherever they need me.\" He leaned back into the chair, more relaxed now. \"Why? Are you playing?\" His eyes looked her up and down. \"As a matter of fact, I am.\" She squared her shoulders. \"I'm going to be a wide receiver.\" His reaction wasn't what she'd been hoping for. \"You're going to play ?\" \"Of course I am!\" she cried. \"What did you think—\" \"Sammy boy!\" A black boy stuck his head between theirs—effectively ruining their conversation—and put his arms around their shoulders. \"I'm disappointed in you. I knew you were a player, but monopolizing the only pretty woman on the bus? Boy, you oughta be ashamed of yourself!\" Turning his head, he grinned at Laura. \"Hey, Miss Thing; I'm Petey Jones, star safety. And who might you be?\" Although it wasn't the best come-on in history, it made her smile, and she introduced herself. \"I'm Laura Eldon; it's very nice to meet you...\" (1) I mean \"hard\" as in \"stern, a bit emotionless\" I just knew all you hormone-driven teenagers would misinterpret that. (2) I actually tried to write about what happened after the meeting, but it was just so badly and awkwardly written that I just decided to skip the entire thing and just have Laura meet the rest of them at camp. This chapter is extremely short, but trust me; nobody wants to see that. This chapter is a bit more of a filler than anything else, because it felt like the part where they got off the bus would be an add-on. Don't worry; the next chapter—which is already underway—will be much better, and much more worthy of dedicating to my wonderful reviewers and PM-ers! Of course, thanks are rightfully given to all my readers! See you much sooner this time! -inspiration-arts[Chapter 3] This was, admittedly, a very long wait. But this chapter is long, and hopefully worth it. This chapter is dedicated to: JanuaryBaby192, albinoblackswan, Alex B. Goode, anexandra, and last but not least, hippielicious. In short: thanks to all my reviewers! Chapter 3: University Laura took a right turn, hopefully down the right hallway. No matter how beautiful or enchanting a place was, a building was still a building. \"201...,\" she murmured. \"Yes! 203!\" She opened it, and there stood Coach Yoast's daughter, her wavy blond hair tied into a frizzy ponytail. \"You must be the new player,\" she said, with surprising conviction for such a small girl. \"I hope you fit in well with the team and have a good time at camp.\" Turning her back on Laura, she began putting her clothes into her dresser. Not very sure whether she should be offended or relieved, she hauled her suitcase over to the other side of the room and began to do the same. Slowly she became immersed in her task, and was only aware of her surroundings when her hand scraped the bottom of her suitcase. She checked it: all her dental things, underwear, and toiletries were still in the side pockets and compartments. She smiled; she wasn't that far gone yet. Still smiling, she turned around. \"Gah!\" Sheryl was giving her one of the most intense stares she'd ever seen, and it seared into her bones from all the way across the room. \"Miss Yoast,\" she said hesitantly, \"what exactly are you doing...?\" The girl shrugged. \"I was just thinkin'. And it's not Miss Yoast,\" she added as an afterthought. \"It's all...old, y'know? Call me Sheryl.\" Suddenly, inexplicably, her eyes narrowed. \"How old do you think I am, anyway?\" Sheryl looked almost furious, so Laura thought she should go at least a bit higher than what she really believed, but under the circumstances, decided to go with the truth. \"Nine? Ten?\" She was more than relieved when Sheryl looked mollified. \"That's close enough,\" the blond conceded. \"I'm eleven and a half.\" Feeling that this consent was enough of a signal to leave for breakfast, Laura stood up and glanced at the clock on the wall. 8:49. \"Sheryl,\" she began, \"I—\" \"I know, I know,\" the blond sighed. \"I'll be thankful that I look younger than I am when I get older. That's what Mama always says. But Coach Boone thought I was five when I was nine and a half! That's practically a baby!\" Laura had to smile. \"I feel your pain, Sheryl, but that's not what I was going to say. Shouldn't we go to breakfast now?\" Sheryl blinked. \"Oh.\" Regaining her composure, she walked out of the room and stopped just outside the threshold. \"Are you coming or not?\" The cafeteria was enormous. Seemingly endless numbers of players sat together, several conversations lost amid the din. \"Food's over there,\" Sheryl said beside her, and she looked over to where the younger girl was pointing. At the far end, some players were picking up food from trays on a spare table. \"I'll see you!\" Sheryl called. Laura spun around; she was already a few feet away, and still walking. I guess it's true; everyone does leave you at some point.\" Snickering at the joke, she walked over to the table of food, her smile slowly failing as she tried and failed to ignore the looks she received from some of the boys as she walked by. She picked up a plate at the 'buffet'. \"Hey, guys,\" she said to the players still there. They only stared. Giving them a weak smile, she turned her attention to the food and didn't look up until she'd served herself all the food she thought she could eat in thirty minutes. Walking away from the platters, she stopped and look around. This was the real problem—trying to find a place to sit. \"Laura!\" someone called. She looked up towards the sound, and grinned as she saw Gerry and Julius. Pushing the fact that they were sitting with six other people out of her mind, she hurried over. \"How's it goin'?\" Gerry asked. She took a deep breath. \"Do you guys mind if I sit with you?\" She looked at the others, and they looked back. \"What position you goin' to play?\" She turned to Julius, the one who'd spoken. \"Receiver. Why?\" \"Well, we're a defensive table.\" He scratched the back of his neck. \"I don't wanna be rude or anything like that, but if you eat with us, you won't get to know any of the people you'll be playing with the most, you know what I'm sayin'?\" She sighed. \"Yeah. So where's an 'offensive table' I can sit at?\" Julius pointed to a table to their left and down two rows. \"Sunshine, Louie and Rev are sittin' there; they're some of the best guys you could meet.\" She thanked him and began to migrate once again. At this new table, she didn't hesitate and just sat down. The five people with her looked up. \"Julius said I should eat here,\" she explained, and their heads went back down. Silence reigned, but after a few minutes of forks scraping against plates, one of the players, a big, blonde one, asked her, \"So what's your name? Where are you from?\" She looked at him and swallowed. \"I'm Laura Eldon, from Mississippi.\" He nodded. \"Which city?\" \"Strawberry.\" (1) He nodded. \"Well, I'm Louie Lastik, offensive lineman, and these two—\" he indicated the two boys, one black and one white, \"—are David and Tommy, both running backs.\" They nodded at their plates, still shoveling food into their mouths. \"You two should be ashamed of yourselves,\" said the black player at the end of the table. \"Here we have a new player, a lady no less, and you two are just eating?\" He shook his head, and turned to Laura. \"I'm Jerry Harris, but you can call me Rev; everyone else does.\" He reached over and shook her hand, giving the other blond sitting across from her an expectant look. Taking Rev's cue, she let go of him and turned the last boy there. \"And who are you?\" she asked. He gave her a wide, bleach-white smile. \"My name's Ronnie Bass. Call me Sunshine.\" His smile turned wry. \"Everybody else does.\" \"Oh. My. GOD. Why?\" The team was on its twenty-fifth up-down, with only ten left to go, and she was just about ready to collapse. The whistle blew, and she nearly threw herself onto the ground, the weight of the world on her shoulders as she struggled to get back up. She tried to make it seem like she was jogging in place while lifting her legs as little as possible. What had she done to deserve this? Coach Boone blew the whistle again, and she felt like slapping him across the face. He'd said he was going easy on them because it was their first day! She glared at him as she jogged, glad he was looking at the defense. Another shrill tweet, and she went down and up. Five seconds of jogging, and she did it again. Just one more time! Five seconds passed, and they were still upright. Ten, fifteen... What is going on? Her legs felt like burning noodles! Finally, just as she was getting ready to scream something, the whistle tweeted twice, and she collapsed. \"Water break!\" she heard Coach Boone yell, and she slowly picked herself up and walked to the table where Sheryl was standing, cooler and cups at the ready. As she drained a cup, the cold of the water rushed to her head, and something in her stomach violently reacted. Dropping to her knees, she put her head into the trash can by the table and promptly began to vomit. Her stomach churned, and up came the eggs, toast, bacon, fruit, and juice of that morning. After she was finished, the smell and taste of what she'd done surrounded her, and she began to heave, choking and spitting out bile as her stomach tried to remove what wasn't there. Eventually she had the sense to take her head out of the trash can, and sucked in fresh air. When she could finally focus on something other than her insides, the first thing she noticed was the silence. \"Are you okay?\" someone asked hesitantly—she recognized Sam, the guy she'd sat next to on the bus. \"No, I'm fine,\" she said, and stood up shakily. \"I just need to sit down for a bit.\" Arms looped around her waist and shoulders as she began the trek back to where Sheryl was standing. \"I told you, I'm fine...\"She tried to shake them off, but they steered her to a soft-looking patch of grass near the coolers and lowered her gently onto the ground. \"Thanks,\" she said, suddenly too spent to bother to look up at her two helpers. They jogged off, and twenty minutes later, Laura was back in the game. So that was it! It was definitely longer than the last chapter, and hopefully a lot better. So, once again, thanks to all my beautiful readers, and even more to my reviewers and PM-ers! I appreciate you all. —inspiration-arts[Chapter 4] Hello, everyone. This is inspiration-arts. I know that this might frustrate some of you, but I'm re-vamping this story again . It's been five years—five years!—since I've updated, but from time to time I see alerts and reviews for this story. I know that I do have a following, small as it might be, and I'm sorry for keeping all of you waiting for so long. I would go ahead and continue with the story as written, but here's the thing: I've changed. A lot. When I started this story, I was in high school. Now I've finished my second year of college. I've done a lot of growing up, and it's pretty safe to say that I've gone from child to quasi-adult! And that's a good thing: how can a child understand love and romance? How can a child write about the nuances of racism, sexism, and homophobia in the 1970s? As I've grown I've experienced the pain and humiliation that comes with having to deal with racism and sexism, and I've experienced the misery and confusion that comes from realizing that I sometimes really hate myself because I'm a black woman and that although I've experienced prejudice I have, on some level, internalized homophobia, ableism, etc. But because I've confronted those feelings, at least a little, I can write about them and give you characters that actually seem like real people. And all that aside, my writing's much better now! Yay! To be honest, I started writing Mixed Messages because I thought that Kip Pardue was hot and I wanted to see him make out with someone that looked like me. And that's fine! But now that I'm older, that's not enough. I want to give all of you the story that I would have loved to read when I was younger: a well-written story with human-seeming characters that undergo a real conflict and come out on top. I can't say that this story will come out soon, but I'll restart it by mid-August at the latest. And to put in a shameless plug for another story, I'm working on a Samurai Jack fic that I'm posting in a month or so, so watch out for that while you're waiting to be entertained! As I said, I'm in college, so I can't promise that I'll update every week, but I'll do my best. Thank you for your time, and thank you so much for choosing to support a story that I'm sure you all thought was dead. It means a lot. Sincerely, inspiration-arts ","Summary":" Hey, guys! I know you haven't seen anything from me in a long while, but that's going to change, be"},{"Movie":"Jeepers Creepers","Title":"Jeepers Creepers: Sins of the Father","Author":"SilverPilot","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5756141","Passage":"[Chapter 1] (ONE) Outskirts of Poho County Spring, 1886 The sound of hooves pounding the ground echoed across the night sky. The rider could see the flickering embers of candles and lanterns reflected under the moonlight from his perch atop the rough leather saddle as the majestic creature beneath him pumped its legs, muscles contracting as it moved at full speed across the open prairie, kicking up dust in its wake. The rider swore he could almost hear the sound of flapping leathery wings mingle with the whistling wind in his ears. But he knew he must be imagining things. He hadn't seen it in nearly a whole day. He must have outrun it, at least for now. He hoped that he might find relative safety in the tiny settlement up ahead. Or was he simply condemning the simple townsfolk ahead to a horrible, grisly fate? He knew he couldn't think like that. He had to believe that there would be strength in numbers. One man alone couldn't stop this terrible tale from unraveling into a twisted, bloody ending. With a renewed sense of vigor, the rider kicked his heels into the horse's side, spurring the animal forward even faster than before. The horse let out a shrill whinny of exertion, its breath coming in short, sporadic gasps of cloudy mist emanating from its flared nostrils. The rider knew that he had been pushing the beast far too hard for far too long, but he had to insist on moving at this pace. He knew that the horse would be fine once it got the chance to eat, drink and rest. The settlement ahead began to grow larger in the rider's view as he drew nearer. The rider pulled tightly on the reins, signaling the horse to slow its pace ever so slightly, reducing their gait to a quick trot rather than full-on galloping. The horse and its rider passed a couple of small ramshackle, nondescript buildings on the outskirts of the town, their uses unknown. For all the rider knew, they were long-since abandoned when the town began to colonize further inward within the settlement. The uneven clumps of dirt and grass began to give way to a poorly carved dirt road, but it was far easier to maneuver than the hills and gullies he had been traveling across since leaving Kistle County several days earlier. The cloud of dust behind the horse began to shrink, the hooves now simply kicking up tiny mounds of dirt and dust as it clomped into the town. The rider's beaten up old leather trench coat flapped listlessly in a slight breeze as its stead yet again reduced its speed to a slow, ambling walk. Its rhythmic hoof beats reverberated across the town, signaling the rider's approach. A couple of curious townsfolk poked their heads out of windows or doors, hoping to catch a glimpse of the mysterious stranger entering their land at such a late hour of the night. They passed a few small houses as they reached the center of town, a tiny strip of dilapidated old wooden structures consisting of a general store, a towering inn that jutted up into the night sky like a poorly lit beacon, a tiny saloon and not much else. A deep rumbling within the rider's stomach reminded him that it had been over two days since his food rations had disappeared, and he hadn't had anything to drink in almost half that time. He steered the horse towards a couple of posts dug into the earth and hopped off, his boots shifting slightly in the crumbling dirt. He tethered the horse to the post, noticing that a trough sat before it, half-filled with water. The horse began to greedily slurp up what was available, not caring that a thin layer of scum had begun to creep across its surface. The rider gently patted the horse's flank, silently thanking the beast for guiding him this far safely. His spurs clicked against the old wooden steps as the rider mounted the porch that stretched across the entire front of the saloon. The lantern hanging by the swinging double doors in a rusted iron sconce was lit, its flames flickering and dancing weakly in the slightly cool night air. A distant thunderhead roiled across the black sky to the East, threatening a storm. The rider was distantly aware of the fact that the entire township would become nothing more than a giant mud bowl should the storm hit hard enough. He pushed through the doors, his leather coat stretching and squeaking at the seams from the effort. He was aware of what a sight he must be, after riding for so many days through the open wilderness. His face was marked with a dozen tiny scratches from bramble and stray branches. His hands, rough and calloused, clenched and unclenched with jittery, unspent nerves. His coat and pants were smeared with dirt, mud and in more than one place, caked with a much darker liquid that had grown crusty and dry, flaking off as he moved, floating in his wake like macabre dust motes. The inside of the saloon was poorly lit, a few haphazardly placed lanterns and a candelabra or two, casting withering shafts of firelight across the place. The rider noted that there were a few patrons within, each one accompanied by little more than their own private thoughts and their liquor. One or two of them cast the newcomer with sidelong glances but didn't dare greet him or question his appearance. This place had seen more than its share of fights, most of them ending in a funeral and a widow or two left in their wake. Blood had been shed in this place, and it wouldn't be long before it happened again. The rider slowly approached the bar, the sounds of his boot heels clicking against the wooden floorboards drowning out the muffled whispers that began to circulate around the tavern. Ignoring them, the rider took a seat at one of the rough-hewn chairs situated in front of the old bar counter, never removing his long leather trench coat. He did, however, take off the dusty old hat perched atop his head, revealing a long, straggly mane of dark, inky black hair that spilled down around his neck like a polluted waterfall. The more intuitive onlookers with a far more curious eye could just barely make out a couple of strange dark markings that trailed across the man's neck, seemingly stretching all the way down past the collar of his thin cotton shirt. Partially hidden by sweat-stained bangs that hung across the man's forehead were a pair of eyes that had seen their fair share of pain and suffering, betraying a lifetime of horror better saved for battlefields and nightmares. The soft brown of his corneas seemed to glow like gold beneath the weak white-orange flames of the lantern hanging just behind the bar, causing the various bottles beneath it to sparkle and glow with a surreal sheen. A grizzled old man who was probably only in his forties but had been hardened by too many years of alcohol, gunfights and hard work approached the rider from the other side of the bar, clutching a water-marked glass in one hand a dirty old bar rag in the other. Les absentmindedly wiped the inside of the glass with the rag, despite the fact that neither one of them were going to help the other get any cleaner. His graying hair had once been a lustrous hazelnut brown, but years and years of stress and sun had caused him to loose the shine it once had, leaving behind a balding mess of gray and white tufts. His eyes darted to and fro in their sockets nervously, and he licked his dry, cracked lips. The tiny valleys and craters if his skin were cast into shadows, giving the man a rather sinister and aged look. \"Help you, sir?\" the old bartender asked. These were the first words that had been spoken to the rider since…He honestly couldn't remember the last time he had spoken with another human. It took him a few moments to process the sounds and to realize that he had been directly asked a question. The bartender stared at him with slightly hooded eyes, awaiting a response. He began to wonder if the strange, battered man was a mute. \"Water,\" the rider finally responded, his voice raspy and crackling. \"This here's a saloon, my friend,\" Les explained, sitting the dirty glass and rag down on the bar in front of him. \"We only serve the good stuff 'round here.\" The rider met his gaze with eyes of steel. The bartender watched with mounting horror as the man reached into the folds of his trench coat, knowing that he may have just made the last mistake of his life. There was no time to reach the shotgun mounted under the bar on the far side. He should've known this stranger was a gunslinger… With an echoing slam, the rider pounded his fist against the bar, opening his palm to reveal several dirty coins and a couple of crumpled, rolled up bills. It was more money than the old man had seen one person carry in a long time. \"Water.\" The rider spoke more clearly this time, his tone unmistakable. Bring me what I want and there won't be any trouble. \"Comin' right up,\" Les mumbled, leaving the money laying on the bar. He moved instinctively, his years of experience taking over as he let his body move on autopilot. He was much too preoccupied with trying to figure out who this man might be and why had chosen tonight to come carousing into Poho. He sat a glass of filmy water before the stranger who greedily scooped it up and poured the liquid down his gullet, a couple of small streams leaking through his dry lips, sluicing down his chin, tracing the odd symbols that trailed down his neck, glistening like trails of sweat. The man finished his water, quietly sitting the glass back down next to the small pile of money in front of him. He wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and seemed to visibly relax for the first time in what looked like days. His entire body just shrugged in on itself, shuddering slightly. His eyes, once permanently fixed into tiny slits of concentration, slid open further, softening. \"Thank you,\" the rider said softly, nodding a couple of times in gratitude. \"Lester,\" the bartender said, pointing at himself. \"Call me Les. Everybody else does. Don't bother me, none. Welcome to Poho County.\" The man in the trench coat did not respond. He simply stared down at his hands, inspecting the cracks and lacerations with great interest. Les followed the man's gaze and began an inspection of his own. He whistled lowly. \"You been ridin' a long ways, feller?\" he asked. \"Kistle County,\" the rider replied despondently. He rubbed his face, as if he were trying to stay awake, though it seemed to be a losing battle. His eyes, now that they were loose and relaxed, fluttered a few times, and for once, he looked about as vulnerable as a stray cat, finally seeking shelter from a storm. \"That's more 'n a week's journey,\" Les exclaimed, leaning his weight against his arms as he propped himself upon the bar with his palms outstretched. \"It's a wonder you weren't skinned alive by some injuns.\" \"I ain't afraid of them,\" the man replied. \"They ain't what'll get you in the dark.\" Les felt a tingle run up and down his spine. Something about the way this man spoke sent tiny shivers of fear through his body. What could be worse than a swarm of injuns coming out of the night and dragging you off to God knows where to have their way with you? \"Who are you?\" Les asked. The rider looked up at him, wrapped his hands around the empty glass before him, gripping it so tight Les was afraid it might shatter within his grasp. His eyes seemed to shake with a deep, primordial fear. Eyes that had seen something so horrific, so unrelentingly terrible, that words could not express how chilling it must have been. \"A man on the run,\" the rider replied carefully, his voice dropping low. Les swallowed, hard. The lump in his throat traveled down, deep down, and he could almost feel it nestle in his chest, latching onto his heart, never letting go, filling him with a sense of dread. \"On the run from what?\" \"The devil,\" the mysterious rider said, and in his eyes, Les saw the truth.[Chapter 2] (TWO) Shelly Birmingham sat before the speckled mirror at her vanity, lightly brushing her long blonde hair out, running her fingers through it as she did so. She stared numbly at her reflection as Holloway stirred between the sheets on the bed behind her in the small room above the saloon that she called home these days. Sometimes she stayed at a room in the inn, but most nights she was here. Her undergarments glowed pale white beneath the soft, supple glow of the candlestick sitting next to her at the vanity, sputtering softly from a slight draft blowing through the room from outside. A cursory glance towards the window confirmed that a storm seemed to be brewing up outside. Shelly crossed her legs at the ankles and continued to brush her hair, staring into her dead, empty blue eyes in the mirror. \"Come back here,\" Holloway whispered from the bed. \"I ain't done yet.\" \"You're done when I say you're done,\" Shelly said back, not letting her gaze leave the reflection staring back at her. She saw out of the corner of her eye through the looking glass that Holloway had sat up in bed, his scar-ridden chest barely illuminated by the firelight. His lower half was obscured by the sheets, thank God, as Shelly really didn't want to have to witness that sight more than she had to. \"Don't make me ask twice, Shelly,\" Holloway threatened. Annoyed, she half-turned in the chair she was seated upon and let her icy gaze fall upon the naked man in her bed. Soft ringlets of hair fell across her face, partially obscuring her view. She hastily blew a couple of them away, hating that she could appear so frail and weak. \"What more do you want, Holloway?\" she snapped. \"You got your roll in the hay. It's over, now. Go back downstairs and have a drink.\" \"But I didn't finish,\" the man whined. Shelly rose to her feet, padding across the wooden floor, her footsteps creaking slightly as she made her way over to the bed. \"Oh, I apologize,\" she whispered, smiling softly. \"I didn't realize. I must have misunderstood you, somehow.\" Shelly inched onto the bed like a lioness, crawling on all fours across the mattress like a predator stalking its prey. Holloway grinned, awaiting more pleasures like the ones he had experienced with her earlier. She slowly reached one smooth, slender arm under the sheets. \"That's a good girl,\" Holloway said breathily, revealing torn up gums and more than a few blackened spots where teeth once resided. His breath reeked of tobacco and cheap liquor. \"You want to finish?\" Shelly asked, almost purring. Holloway nodded greedily, licking his lips, readying himself. Shelly let her arm snake further beneath the sheets before she latched onto him, squeezing her fist as tightly as she could manage, wrenching her hand sideways. Holloway wailed in anguished pain, his body thrashing beneath her. With her free hand, Shelly pushed him down by the throat, silencing his cries. \"Like I said,\" Shelly snarled through gritted teeth. \"You're done when I say you're done. Don't make me say it twice.\" Holloway nodded swiftly, his choked sobs muffled due to his windpipe being severely blocked by Shelly's fist. She slowly released him from his grasp, and it was all he could do to throw her weight off of him, leaving her to tumble atop the stained sheets as he dashed for the door of her room. \"Crazy bitch!\" he exclaimed, bolting out into the hall as he buckled himself up, leaving his other clothes behind. Shelly stifled a giggle as she listened to Holloway's receding footsteps as he hurried downstairs to the bar, likely to tell Les all about the travesty that had just occurred. Considering Holloway was nothing more than a drunkard with a tendency to commit petty crimes, it was unlikely that Les would give the man any time of day. Sighing, Shelly scooted to the edge of the mussed bed, letting her pale, slender legs dangle over the edge. She glanced over at the pile of battered coins discarded on the bedside table, eyeing them disdainfully. Had it truly come to this for her? She knew she needed the money, seeing as she was left with nothing after Earl was killed more than a year ago. A young widow didn't have a lot of options in the frontier. She slid off the bed, scooping the coins off the table, and walked back over to the vanity, opening a tiny drawer to reveal a small bag tied with a ribbon. She opened it, letting the coins trickle into it, hearing them tinkling against the meager amounts of money they joined. Shelly had never told anyone, but this secret fund was going to be her way out of this little town someday. She'd heard about bigger places, bigger towns, even further out West, near the coast. She would go there one day and start over with a brand new life. Not the dirty, messy, confusing one she led here. This one would be different. She wouldn't be haunted by the memories of Earl and the life she had led as a deputy's wife. She knew of a caravan that traveled back and forth across the West, carting people off to greener pastures - for a price. She would save up enough money to pay that fair, and it would take her to that better place out there that she knew must exist. Slowly but surely, this life was killing her. Already she felt that several pieces of her heart had been chipped away, mostly after Earl passed. Closing the drawer, keeping her dreams locked within it, Shelly ambled over to her one and only window that looked out over the main street of Poho. Mostly, it was just a desolate street with little to no activity save maybe a stray dog or coyote lingering just close enough to humanity's doorstep, searching for scraps of food. But tonight she saw something else. A horse was hitched to a post just off the saloon's porch, one she had never seen before. It stood there listlessly, glancing balefully around with large, empty eyes. Its coat was sleek and midnight black with just a few tiny strokes of white cresting its massive chest, leading up its throat. What brave soul could have wandered all the way into Poho at this midnight hour? Curious, Shelly slipped back into the old, tattered dress she'd been wearing when she'd led Holloway up the creaky old steps at the back of the saloon to her room. She took one last glance in the streaked, stained mirror, appraising her appearance. She pushed and pulled at her hair and hem, trying to straighten herself out. This, she deemed, was about as good as it was going to get. Hoping that Holloway knew what was best for him and had gone home to turn in for the night, Shelly left her tiny room and headed downstairs into the bar proper. Instantly, she noticed the stranger that must belong to the dark horse tethered outside, sitting solemnly at the bar, holding a small glass of water between his thick, rough palms. He was attractive, in a rugged sense, but that was par for the course when it came to cowboys and gunslingers. Thick stubble had begun to overtake his slender facial features like thick black vines threatening to overtake a dark but strangely beautiful old house. He seemed to have an aura of loneliness around him, the likes of which Shelly felt she could strongly relate to. Not many people could sit in a room full of other people going about their lives and yet seem so utterly alone. Shelly knew exactly how that felt. She made her way around the far side of the bar, coming inexorably close to the lonely stranger. He didn't move, didn't even seem to recognize her incoming presence. She hoped he wouldn't be able to smell the stink of Holloway still lingering around her. She could almost still taste his tobacco stained breath on her tongue as he writhed and pulsed above her. \"Awful late to be traveling,\" Shelly remarked as she took a seat at the bar next to the man in the leather trench coat. She propped herself up with her elbow, staring over at the stranger, trying her best to maintain a sense of innocence and curiosity. This had become like second nature to her. Smooth talking strange men into giving her their time and money had become like a hobby, one she never thought she would acquire, nor need to. Alas, there it was. \"This one ain't much for talkin', Shelly,\" Les said, approaching the two of them with his ever-present filthy bar rag. Shelly had known Les for quite some time, seeing as Earl had spent a lot of his free hours hanging about in this old tavern. He and his deputy buddies would laugh and cavort with each other, telling stories and bragging about their women and what they could get them to do with them in bed. Since Earl had passed, Les had taken her under his wing, despite his misgivings about her current choice of profession. \"Don't be rude, Les,\" Shelly admonished the old barkeep. \"Introduce us properly.\" \"Would if I could, darlin', but like I said, this one ain't exactly a chatterbox.\" Les came to a stop as he stood opposite them, absentmindedly rubbing the dirty old cloth in his hands across the bar top, unsuccessfully cleaning not a single damn thing. \"He told me a pretty radical story, though, didn't 'ya, feller?\" The stranger simply rose his glass to his lips, taking another swig of water. \"It ain't a story,\" the man said softly. \"You 'n me got business to attend to, missy,\" Les said to Shelly, pointing an accusatory finger towards her. Shelly feigned ignorance, glancing plaintively up at the old man. \"Holloway came wailin' through here like a rattlesnake got it's tail torn off. Spewin' about how's you gave him a real what-for upstairs. How many times I gotta tell you not to abuse the clientele?\" \"And what about them abusing me?\" Shelly asked dangerously. \"You know I don't care for that sorta thing,\" Les said distastefully. \"A woman enters into that sorta thing, certain things are gonna happen. All I'm sayin' is you get what you get when you play those games.\" \"Oh, what do you know,\" Shelly said, waving the old man off. He sighed and shook his head like an irritated father, then busied himself watering down some of his cheap old liquor bottles, trying to make them appear fuller. Shelly turned her attention back to the brooding stranger. \"Les don't know what he's talkin' about. He's been knocked in the head a few too many times, if you know what I mean.\" The stranger finally turned and faced her, pinning her down with his deep, dark eyes. Shelly felt transfixed looking into his gaze. The things she saw deep within those twin pools of brown were like nothing she'd ever experienced before. \"Pardon me, miss, but I'm not really up for socializing,\" he said in what appeared to be a rather polite tone, but the hidden meaning was remarkably unmistakable. Leave me alone, before you really piss me off. \"Maybe if I buy you a drink, you might tell me that story Les mentioned,\" Shelly propositioned, leaning closer. The stranger continued to regard her with the same blank, empty stare, freezing her in place. She began to fear that maybe she'd begun pushing the wrong man's buttons. Perhaps she'd finally gotten in over her head. She'd heard stories of women like her being killed by men like this. \"Believe me, you're better off not knowing,\" he finally replied. \"Man says he's got the devil on his heels,\" Les explained, raising his eyes from the liquor bottles for the briefest of moments. \"And from what I can gather, he meant it rather literally.\" \"And what'd you do that got the devil, himself, so cross with you?\" Shelly asked. \"It has nothing to do with me,\" the stranger said darkly. He pinned Shelly with his intense stare once again, waves of fear and anger flowing off of him. \"And yet…everything.\" Shelly could feel a strange sensation gnawing at her stomach. It was a mixture of fear, trepidation and maybe even a little bit of excitement. This man, this strange and dark, brooding man, reminded her so much of Earl. He had the same intensity about him, and Shelly wondered what could have happened to him to make him this way. \"Tell me,\" Shelly said softly. She waved to Les to pour them a couple of drinks, and the old man ruefully complied. In seconds, two shots of whiskey appeared before the two of them. Shelly quickly downed hers, letting the shot glass tumble back onto the bar. The man eyed his own shot for a moment, then swallowed it fast. \"If you insist,\" he murmured. \"I'll tell you my story. But you have to make me a promise, first.\" Shelly looked into his eyes, searching. For what, she didn't quite know. Answers? She hardly knew the question. \"Promise?\" she asked curiously. \"Promise me that you'll believe me,\" the man whispered, voice so low that Shelly had to strain to hear him, despite the relative quiet of the saloon. \"That you'll believe me, and possibly even help me.\" \"I promise,\" Shelly said without hesitation. The man seemed to relax for a moment at this, as if he was about to unburden the weight of the world onto another human's shoulders for once. \"My name is William,\" the stranger said. \"And I am being hunted…\" Author's Notes: I know that this has been somewhat of a slow start, but I am trying to get the characters all set up and established firmly before we start moving into the action. And trust me, there will be plenty of action. I have always wanted to tell a story set in the JC-universe, and I am really excited to be bringing this one to life here at FFnet. Please stick with me on this, even though it is something of a slow burning tale at the moment, but things will be heating up soon. As always, please R&R;!

You freakish retard why would you keep him in a bag.\" I said smacking him upside the head. \"He needed help.\" Jared said grabbing a cage that we once used for a bird we had. \"It's a damn raccoon Jared, Nora will kill us, and what did she say about you going in the woods at night.\" I said hitting him again. \"I didn't know what to do it was being attacked by a big raccoon, and I didn't get hurt.\" Jared said wincing a little when he bent down. \"Lift your shirt up Jared.\" I said walking towards him. \"Fine but its not that bad, just a little scratch.\" Jared said wincing just to lift his shirt. \"Look you have scratch marks all over your stomach, did your stupid butt go out without a shirt.\" I said. Before Jared could answer the front door opened as I grabbed his hand and grabbed the Raccoon running up the stairs. \"Jared!, Tyson!, get your asses down here now!\" Nora yelled holding bags. \"Yes Nora.\" Jared said earning him a slap across the face \"Mom!\" He yelled holding his cheek. \"Mind your manners Jared, Now both of you up with your shirts.\" Shane said checking our stomachs for bruising or scratches. \"Jared, Again, I thought we said no more woods without Ty.\" Shane said. Shane can be the fatherly type but on the other hand Nora was just down right pissed off at him. \"Jared Andrew Atwood you've been in the woods again haven't you.\" she said \"And Tyson this is your fault you know, you two are nothing but trouble since your parents died.\" Nora said. \"Nora.\"Shane said as Jared started to cry silently. \"You two should have died in that fire as well as your parents, you two don't deserve life because you are just ungrateful children, and I've about had enough of it.\" Nora said slapping Jared once more for crying \"Stop that crying boy.\" \"Nora stop it, do you think hitting us will do any different,You have no respect for anyone but yourself you know, And Shane we love you like a father but I have to do this to both of you, Nora I hate you with all my heart and now, you die for it.\" I said throwing the lighter at Nora's shirt which caught fire and she hit Shane who's shirt did the same. \"Tyson, we have to run now.\" Jared said walking up the stairs behind me. when we entered our room, I grabbed mine and Jared's clothes, and put them in a bag as he put the raccoon in the cage. We began to run out the door to the street and didn't stop running. Tyson's PoV It's been 6 years since the day I killed Shane and Nora. But I'm proud I did, we didn't deserve to live like that definitely if your only 10. \"Ty, Mark wants us home by 10 tonight.\" Jared said. \"Okay that's fine.\" I said. Mark and Amy are our best friends and they know our past, plus there all 17 so they live on there own. \"It's today huh.\" Jared said. \"It's the day you killed them.\" He added in. \"Shh, no one needs to hear, do you want me to be in jail for murder.\" I said hitting him upside his head. Me and Jared are identical twins so if me and Jared go in front of a mirror it's like seeing double except he dyed red highlights in his hair. \"Hey baby, hey Ty, what you guys up to.\" Ally said kissing Jared on the cheek. \"Nothing much just about to head to the mall and meet, Eric, Mark, Sydney, Kendra, and Elise.\" Jared said winking at me when he said Elise which Ally happen to catch. \"No way, you like Elise.\" Ally said holding her hands to her face. \"So why does it matter to you.\" I said a little pissed that Jared made it a little obvious. \"Well just that she likes you too, I mean who wouldn't, you have dirt blonde hair, blue eyes, and a great personality.\" Ally said. \"Well that's all true, very true. so today I'll ask her out, but first, lets all get to the mall.\" I said laughing a bit. \"Yeah, so who's driving us there?\" Ally asked. \"Uh...me.\" Jared said. \"Well into the car we go then.\" I said opening the car door for Ally to get into the back of Jared's red Ford Mustang 2012. We got to York dale Shopping Center in like, five to ten minuets because we took back streets. When we arrived to the mall Eric and Kendra where in a hot make-out, then Mark and Sydney where flirting so much they didn't notice us walk over to them, Elise was looking at flower's, her favorite. \"Why don't you two breath for once.\" Ally said. \"We breath but its only for a short moment.\" Eric said. \"Well anyways, once you guys finish kissing and flirting lets go, and by finish I mean now.\" Ally said. \"Hey, why don't we go to the hmv to buy some music.\" Elise said. \"Okay that works.\" I said earning a grin from her \"Now if me and Elise could stop being fifth wheels we can go.\" \"You wouldn't be one if you guys dated.\" Mark said in a singly tone. I looked over at Elise who was looking down blushing which caused me to start blushing. \"Aw look there both blushing.\" Jared said gesturing over to Elise. \"Okay, okay, I get the hint.\" I mumbled walking over to Elise \"Hey, uh... Elise can I um, talk to you for a minuet.\" I said making a fool of myself but she agreed to talk to me anyways. We walked over to the bench not to far from the others but out of sight and out of ear shot. \"Uh...so I hear you like someone huh?\" I asked. \"Yeah, and I hear you like someone as well.\" Elise said getting redder. \"Yeah, but who you like is my question.\" I said, adjusting my self to face her as she did the same. \"Why don't you tell me first.\" She said smiling. \"Okay, how about I describe her instead.\" I said as she nodded in agreement. \"She has dark brown hair, hazel eyes, a great personality and shes beautiful.\" I said blushing. \"Well the person I like has dirty blonde hair, blue eyes and is captain of the hockey team, and has a wonderful personality and happens to be sitting next to me.\" She said grabbing my hand and holding it. \"Hey, Elise?\" I said. \"Yeah.\" She said. \"Will you go out with me?\" I asked. \"That depends, is this a joke.\" She said. \"Nope, my own question for the answer yes.\" I said. \"Then yes.\" Elise said pulling me into a loving embrace but got ruined just as I was enjoying it. \"It's about time you lover's got together, we've been behind the wall for like five hours now.\" Kendra said. \"Oh shut up Kendra.\" I said grabbing Elise's hand to lift her off the bench, but deciding to hold it the whole day. \"Oh, look there already acting like a couple.\" Sydney said making me and Elise turn red. \"Well let's head for hmv!\" Elise said gripping my hand harder so we could run to the store. We ran though out the mall all of us laughing together, until Sydney fell in the middle of a crowed. \"Smooth Sydney, smooth.\" I said pissing her off more than she already was. \"Shut up Ty!\" Sydney said being picked up by Mark. \"Are you okay?\" Mark asked her. \"Yeah I'm fine.\" Sydney said. \"Well, where is hmv anyways?\" I said. \"It should be on the other side of the mall.\" Ally said. \"Do you know how big this mall is!\" Kendra exclaimed. \"Well I do now.\" Ally said looking at the mall map. \"Well let's get a move on then.\" I said glancing over at Elise's smiling face. Today's going to be wonderful. Chapter 2 will be up as soon as possible.[Chapter 2] Chapter 2 Yay |_Tyson's PoV_| \"Damn Kendra, you live on dirt road with nothing but farms. Where's the nearest store?\" Mark asked. \"About 4 miles down the road.\" Kendra said. \"Okay...looks like there's not gonna be any snacks tonight.\" I said. \"Nope.\" Kendra said cheerfully. Then suddenly... \"AAAAAARRRGHHH!\" Mark yelled as the car started swerving. All I saw was Kendra's hair as our car tipped. When my vision became clear again, we crawled out of the car. \"Wow...great going.\" Kendra said. We heard a POP! and we turned to see Jared's car turn and flip and finally land upside down on the side of the road. \"Okay, from now on...only the girls drive the cars.\" Ally said. \"Whaaaa? Girls are way worse drivers than boys!\" Jared said. \"I'm going to pretend like I did not hear that sexist comment.\" Kendra stated. We heard Elise scream. \"ERIC IS HURT!\" She called as she pulled him out with all her might. It was bad. The whole left side of his face was bloody, and we could see the bone in his left leg. Jared turned and threw up all over the dirt road. \"What should we do?\" Kendra yelled. \"Look! There's a barn!\" Ally yelled and pointed at a creepy looking old fashion barn. \"Maybe someone lives there...But, I don't know who would live in that.\" Jared said. \"Don't be mean.\" Elise said. \"If you got a problem take it up with my butt, cause it's the only one that gives a crap!\" Jared said, and then laughed like crazy. \"Hey, shut up and come help us.\" I said as we picked up Eric. We waddled over to the barn as we opened the door. \"I'm going to go check out our cars.\" I said. I headed out of the door and towards Mark's wrecked car. The cars were smoking and smoldering. I looked at the tires, trying to find any clue about what cause this giant crash. I pulled back a cut part of the tire and found something. It took me a few tries to get it out. I pulled it out and held it in my hand, It was a piece of tar with four very sharp pieces of bone like stuff. I turned it over and I saw... I heard a scream from the barn. I dropped the thing and ran back. Once I was back I found A strange-looking thing standing over Eric. It was missing an arm and leg so it was kinda swaying side-to-side. Then suddenly, Wings appear out of it back and it grabs Eric with the one arm it has then just flies away with him. Kendra started running after the flying figure holding Eric in its hand. I ran and grabbed Kendra's arm swinging her into my chest. \"It has Eric!\" Kendra sobbed into my chest clinging it \"We have to find it and get Eric back!\" Kendra yelled hitting my chest. \"Kendra...\" I started. \"We have to get Eric back!\" Kendra yelled starting to run in the direction the thing flew. \"Kendra!\" I yelled bringing her back \"I'm sorry but that thing is way to fast for us to get it. And...I don't think we're getting Eric back.\" I said. \"What do you mean?\" Kendra asked falling to her knees. \"I mean, He's gone forever, there's...Nothing we can do. The second that thing grabbed Eric, he was gone.\" I said kneeling next to her \"Let's go back to the barn.\" Kendra nodded slowly.I stood up and helped her up. We walked back to the barn to find most of everyone sleep. Ally sleeping in Jared's lap who was also sleeping, Sydney and Mark both sleeping on the ground and Elise pacing around. \"Elise...calm down.\" I said. \"That thing might come back. What will we defend with?\" Elise asked. \"I don't know, but tomorrow we will figure it out.\" I said. \"How do you know it won't came back tonight?\" Elise asked. \"Hold on. Kendra go lay down next to Sydney.\" I commanded and she did so and fell asleep. Fast. \"So how do you know?\" Elise asked. \"I've heard about this story, so I did some research. I found out that thing's name is the Creeper and he's immortal. He feeds everyday for 23 day and sleeps for 23 years.\" I said. \"So you mean we have to survive with this thing trying to eat us for 23 days?\" She asked. \"Pretty much, but calm down. It takes one or 2 people a day.\" I said. \"So it might come back for more?\" She said getting scarred again. \"No, I doubt it would make this big of a trip back. Elise please just get some sleep.\" I begged. \"Fine. Come here.\" She said as she sat down and patted the spot next to her. I sat next to her and started to sing. \"Call me crazy if you've got it in you\" \"But these people don't seem to mind\" \"Sweet vermouth now you're telling me the truth\" \"A little stubbornness will work out fine\" \"A bottom feeder at the end of my rope\" \"But I'm wondering where this rope began\" \"Gonna circle around what I couldn't help bring down\" \"It's just supply with demand\" \"Ooo, nothing looks the same\" \"Ooo, even when there's been no change\" \"Ooo, say that something's gonna give\" \"And it's all giving out on you\" \"When it's all over now\" I ended the first verse of the song and laid on my back. \"Good song.\" She said as she hesitantly laid her head on my chest. \"You know it?\" I asked. \"It's all over now by Eric Hutchinson. Of course I know it.\" She said looking up at me. Her Hazel eyes piercing mine, her a strand of her brown hair fell in her face. God was she cute. I moved the strand of hair behind her ear. \"What are you thinking about doing?\" She asked with a smirk on her face. \"This.\" I said as I lifted her head and put my lips to her's gently. She kiss back then we pulled away. \"I think I like that Idea.\" She said as she pulled me into another kiss. We had been going at it for about 5 minutes so far then pull apart startled by a shuffle of feet. \"You guys just started dating and the first thing I see when I wake up to take a piss, Is my brother and his girl in a hot make out.\" Jared said as he lifted Ally up and placed her back on his lap. \"Now you know how I felt when you and Ally were getting it on in the room while I was sleeping.\" I said. His face turned red with embarrassment and plainly says \"At least I didn't have morning wood over Elise.\" Now its my turn to turn red with embarrassment. I looked at Elise whose face couldn't get more red. \"Low blow man.\" I said as I glared at him. \"No you had a low blow.\" Jared said then laughing so loud. \"Shut up!\" Ally mumbled thinking she was hitting her leg but hit his balls instead. \"My Balls!\" Jared said grabbing his crouch then falling over to the side. \"Talk about low blow.\" Elise said laughing with Ally. Jared glared at her then went back to groaning in pain. \"I'm sorry.\" Ally said putting her hand on his leg pretty damn close to where she hit him. \"I need these for us.\" Jared said shaking his hand still groping himself. \"Shh. We still have a thing flying around trying to eat us.\" Ally said sitting up. \"Oh right. Oops.\" Jared said laughing awkwardly. \"God how about we all just sleep?\" I suggested. \"I think it's a good idea.\" Elise said as we laid down again. \"Naw I think I'm good.\" Jared said. \"Me too.\" Ally said. \"Suit yourselves.\" I said. Soon the slight pressure I had felt on my chest was now heavier as Elise fell asleep, and due to her warmness everything soon went black. Chapter 2 like I promised so yeah.

A little feedback would be most appreciated and would give me a feel of whether the story should be continued or not. ~oOo~ This wasn't fear. Fear drove him, sustained him, but this, this was something else. It excited him, perplexed him and ignited a new hunger, one that roared from the darkness deep within him. Winter Embers ~oOo~ The scent of winter hung effortlessly in the air, moving freely on the breeze across the twilight skies. The intense cold made his sleep fitful until finally he awoke. His withered body ached and his hunger was unbearable. It wasn't his time, not yet, though time was a concept the Creeper didn't fully understand. He slept, he awoke and once his hunger was satisfied he slept again. The cycle repeated without fail, twenty three years of death for every twenty three days of life; until now. ~oOo~ There had been whispers and murmurings over the years. Stories that had been passed down from generation to generation, myths and legends, rumours of a demon's existence; tales of a demon that feasted upon the hearts of mortal men, that bathed in the blood of his chosen few and wore their skin like armour. The modern world had credited these stories, these myths created over time to over active imaginations and drug fuelled delusions of the weak. There were few that knew the truth; for their sins. Kali had known the demon had awoken when the earth trembled with fear beneath her feet and the star speckled sky shrieked with terror. She chuckled softly to herself as she glanced up to the moon, knowing that he would seek her out eventually. With a gentle shrug of her shoulders her wings unfolded and spread out behind her. Within seconds she took to the skies with the silver moonlight casting her shadow across the untouched snow beneath her. ~oOo~ The Creeper's dry and damaged skin tore away from his body with even the smallest of movements. Pain ripped through him, contorting his face as he struggled to his feet. The ground was colder than he remembered and the faint traces of breath hung in front of his eyes as fine mist. He inhaled deeply, tasting the delights that the breeze had to offer. There seemed to be nothing of any real interest for miles around, save for the scent of distant fear. He inhaled again, ignoring the burning chill in his withered lungs. As the seconds and minutes passed, his senses grew sharper. The scent of fear grew stronger; causing his pale, dead eyes to cloud over with deadly intent. Gingerly but with an increasing sense of purpose, the Creeper made his way from his resting place. Solid, frozen ground gave way to snow almost three inches deep and the sudden, intense chill sent shivers racing up and down his crumbling spine. His grey lips curled into a snarl as his torn wings erupted from his back, causing him to roar in pain. The ravens that stood guard over his grave scattered into the sky, each in search of what the Creeper desired most. The longer he waited, the weaker he felt. His body trembled with hunger and cold; then without warning, he dropped to one knee, shivering in the gentle wind. The cold ate at him, ravaged him until the distant call of the Raven snapped him from his daze. They'd found what he had begun to crave. With one mighty flap of his wings, the demon took flight, splitting the eerie peace of the night with a terrifying roar.[Chapter 2] From a branch high above he watched them; how they moved, how they breathed, how their sins shaped the shadows that were cast out behind them, stretched and twisted before being consumed by the darkness that surrounded them. He heard their hushed whispers though he didn't understand their words, he didn't care to. He was there for one thing and one thing only; to feast upon the damned. He inhaled deeply, ignoring the burning in his lungs as the winter chill carried their scents. Their sins called to him in the darkness, their hypocrisy sang to him and enchanted him more than any song could. He growled softly as he allowed his eyes to close and his body to listen. Their hushed tones became softer and almost silent as the breeze carried the sounds of prayer filled paper high into the bare bones of the trees. The Creeper smiled as his steel coloured eyes opened to the repetitive melody of petition. It was time. The two figures, a man and a woman knelt beside each other in the snow, their hands entwined and their heads bowed in prayer. From high above them the call of the raven sounded a loud and shrieking sound that caused the woman to startle. \"Ruth, be still your racing heart. You will not be able to hear the word of the Lord if you are being deafened by the Devil.\" Ruth nodded silently and cast her eyes skywards for a brief moment before returning to her prayers. A wave of uneasiness crashed over her, causing her to tremble in the cold. Josef gripped her hand tightly and continued the prayer for his soul. One of the ravens swooped down from a bare branch and landed opposite them, cawing throughout their Mantra. Another arrived, joining in the chorus, and another and another until at least two dozen ravens circled the duo. Ruth opened her eyes and screamed breaking Josef from his intense concentration. His eyes snapped open, anger etched on to his face. He was just about to turn and chastise her but then he saw what she was screaming at. The Ravens scattered into the air, moving in all directions around them, forcing them to lose their grip on each other. The Demon swooped down from his hiding place, landing before them on one knee. His eyes burned into them, staring into their rotten cores. Neither Ruth nor Josef noticed him at first; both were too pre-occupied with the swarm of black feathers that encompassed them. Their shrieks of terror awoke Miriam from her restless dreams. Quickly she scrambled from her makeshift bed and out of the wagon. The birds quickly circled her, clawing at her before she found cover behind the boxes her father had unloaded from their vessel. The Creeper sniffed the air, latching onto the fear that poured out of Ruth in abundance. He lunged for her, cutting through the air as precisely as the birds that surrounded him. Josef caught the movement out of the corner of his eye and threw himself between his wife and her attacker. The Creeper careered into him, sending both bodies flying backwards into the side of the wagon. The vehicle flipped, the wooden panels breaking and splintering like sugar paper. The impact left Josef crumpled in a heap and the Creeper standing over him. Miriam gasped and made a run for her father. Ruth caught her around the middle and shouted through the furious flutter of wings and squawking of birds, terror screaming through the words. \"Miriam, RUN!\" The Creeper turned to face both mother and daughter upon seeing that Josef was neither moving nor held any significance for him. Ruth shoved Miriam, forcing the young girl to break out into a run. The demon ignored the blonde girl. Ruth was the one he'd came here for, her flesh was the flesh he wanted to gorge himself on; it was Ruth that would be the first person to satisfy him after his slumber. He snarled as the clawed wings on his face expanding and opening up for the first time in over a decade. Ruth visibly shook with fear. He approached, his steel gaze fixed upon her through the torrent of birds. Josef; dazed and bruised came up behind him, armed with a shattered plank from the side of the wagon. The Creeper knew he was there and with one swoop of his arm brushed him aside; sending him hurtling into a tree. From the darkness there was a gasp followed by a deep groan before the clearing fell silent; the ravens disappearing into the shadows. Ruth dropped to her knees, feeling around in the snow for her husband's bible. Any hope of salvation was slipping through her fingers like the melting snow. The creature grabbed her by the hair; dragging her from her knees with a tug of his arm. He grinned, flashing his yellowed and rotting teeth to the woman who remained quivering within his iron grip. For a split second their eyes locked and for what felt like an eternity the air fell silent. Her glassy eyes begged him, pleaded with him for mercy but there was none; for the creeper snarled and lunged forward, fangs exposed as the ravens scattered skyward and the woman's blood drenched screams dripped from the cradle of the crescent moon. The demon feasted; the way he tore at the flesh of her throat, the muscles of her upper arms and chest, it was clear he was driven by and his actions dominated by pure animalistic hunger. The Creeper's victim clawed at his arms, her movements erratic and frightfully desperate despite the viciousness that ripped into her. A thousand images flashed through her mind before her gaze fixated on a single point behind her attacker. A single tear trickled down her cheek, cutting a delicate pathway through the blood that splattered her face. Miriam starred back at her. The young girl watched with horror as the demon feasted upon her mother. Tears welled in her unblinking eyes; she daren't move or even breathe for fear of the demon seeking her out. The longer she watched, the more her heart raced until it finally broke when Ruth's gaze fell upon her. Miriam found her breath hitching in her throat. Desperately she wanted to fight off her mother's attacker, to protect her as she had once been protected but fear had found her rooted firmly to the spot, huddled behind the remains of the wagon that carried them through the winter forest. The demon paused only to deeply inhale the rich copper scent of fresh blood that was entwined and knotted with the intoxicating vapours of Ruth's fear. He could feel his body rebuilding within seconds of tasting her crimson nectar. He roared in ecstasy as the blood dripped from his chin and splattered against his chest like the spring rains he was used to. He felt alive. With each drum of his heart, he felt Ruth's life slip away from her until the blood pumping from the gaping wound in her neck slowed to a painful stop. He pulled back and looked into her vacant eyes. Instead of seeing the fear filled expression of the dammed, an expression he craved, he saw that she looked oddly at peace and her vision fixed elsewhere. Miriam's gaze remained on her mother; even after the Creeper dropped Ruth's body into the snow, leaving it in a crumpled and bloody heap. His head snapped around to see what or who she was staring at but he saw nothing. Where a fire once danced in the night, illuminating the shadows and banishing their presence beyond the reaches of its touch, logs lay smouldering with their essence drifting into the chilled air. The clearing was silent save for the heavy, exhausted breathing of the creeper and the flutter of raven wings high overhead. Miriam's eyes flickered back and forth between the bloody carcass and the vicious jaws of death; her heart hammering against her ribs. She was almost certain the creeper could hear the blood rushing around her body and the scent of fear as it oozed from her body. He stared at her but didn't see her; she held her breath as he advanced closer, his increasing body weight leaving deeper and deeper imprints in the snow with each step. Miriam buried her head into her knees and held her breath in deadly expectation. \"Be … Gone … Demon\" The raspy voice from mid-way up a tree startled Miriam as much as it did the creeper. The beast turned quickly and stared up at the body impaled on the twisted branches. Thickening blood dripped slowly from the gnarled wood that protruded grotesquely from Josef's chest. His body hung loosely around it, his legs limp and numb and clutched within his weakening grasp, a silver cross that had once been a gift from his Mother. He raised his arm gingerly, drawing the object in his hand to the demon's face. \"Be ... Gone … Demon … God … Commands … You.\" Blood oozed from the corners of his mouth and rose like agonizing fire in his throat with each word spoken into the night. His arm grew shaky and weak through loss of blood and his grip loosened still. The Demon watched him, his head falling to one side and grey, dead eyes narrowing in concentration. Josef, devout in his faith struggled to present to cross further to the Creeper as the pain emanating from his chest increased ten-fold. The Creeper looked down at the object and smiled before it slipped through Josef's fingers and into the snow along with his last breath. Miriam watched as the cross tumbled from her father's grip and vanished into the ruby speckled blanket of snow. She stared, unmoving as the demon crushed it into the ground. She ignored the sound of the Ravens as they called out to the Creeper from the shadow, as he turned and advanced upon her. Everything she had known had been ripped away from her and crushed underfoot like her grandmother's crucifix. The demon could smell her now, the rich scents of her despair and loss; they made him quiver with excitement. He had killed her parents for a purpose, to quench his thirst for blood but this; this was for the outright thrill of it. Suddenly aware of what was happening; Miriam looked up, panic and fear etched across her childlike face. Quickly she scrambled from her hiding place to the base of the tree beneath the hanging corpse of her father, sending a flurry of snow into the air behind her. The creature roared and chased after her, snatching her by the hair as her fingers found the twisted crucifix. The creature roared again and leapt into the air, his leather like wings unfolding behind him. Miriam screamed as she rose with him, leaving the slain behind her and the crucifix slipping through her fingers. ","Summary":" A/N: I am a little unsure if I should continue with this. A little feedback would be most appreciat"},{"Movie":"Remember the Titans","Title":"The Lone Titaness","Author":"anything but thisssss","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6271382","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Disclaimer: I'm doing this once. I do not own any of the Titans or the coaches. I own only Jimmy Michigan, Sully Michigan and whoever else I add that does not belong to whoever made Remember The Titans. Senior Changes TC Williams High School had went through a lot of changes the year when the school district of Alexandria, Virginia decided to integrate the schools. Suddenly the blacks were mixed in with the whites. None of them were happy about it, especially the T.C William's Titans. The whites, who had always been in charge of their school were angered by the very idea of a black man taking the head coaching job and moving in with his negro players to take their team. In the beginning, things were awful, fights breaking out and harsh words flying. All types of racial slurs being flung around. That is, until Herman Boone took his team to football camp. No one knows what exactly happened at that camp that inverted all those racially challenged boys. When they left Alexandria for camp, squashed into seats with someone of the opposite race, they hated each other. Though the public may not know what exactly happened, it's an easy assumption, and probably a correct one, that they hated each other. But when they came back, all of them peacefully packed into their respected busses, Alexandria was drawing at straws. The boys were getting along, no fights, no yelling, they were friends. Alexandria was against it and nearly tore them apart. They did, for a short amount of time. But like every relationship, even a football team, there are ups and downs. And it was mere fate that got them through the tortures of Alexandria's racial issues. By the end of the season, not only had the Titan's won all the games they played but somehow they'd managed to break through the barriers of Alexandria's world. The black's and whites were together. Everything was peaceful … for awhile. For the rest of the school year, the junior year for the boys, was calm of course they had their disagreements and arguments. But they always remembered the Titans. And it pulled them through it all. It got them through the summer. That is … until another problem came up. They'd spent so much time on what color your skin was. They worried over whether you had white or black skin. They attacked you if you were darker or lighter. Anything different made them go on the offense. And when they made it through that problem. They were so relieved that they ignored any other problem they may have in that small Alexandria town. Until a girl came to football try outs. Then the problem came out. A/N Yes another girl on the football team. This is going to be original, I hope. My own little twist to the idea of a girl on the team I haven't decided who I want my OC to be with. So review and tell me what you think of the prologue and if I should continue. And if you do think I should continue, tell me who you would like to see with my OC. By the way her name is going to be Sully, short for Sullivan.[Chapter 2] Ride To The New \"Dad, why did we move here again?\" A girl with long black hair, braided down her back into a loose plait asked. She twisted a loose piece of string from her old t-shirt around her finger, so many times that it tightened painfully and turned the tip of her finger purple with blood. She couldn't comprehend her father's decision to move them, from the sunny perfect place of LA to Alexandria, Virginia. She'd asked him repeatedly over the summer but the only answer she ever got was a weird anxious shrug and a change of topic. She continued to ask but stopped expecting an answer. \"Are you going to be okay going to the office alone? Your looking for a Mrs. Krueger, she's supposed to give you all your paperwork and stuff. The normal school papers and stuff.\" Her dad said, his babbling drifting off into the back of her brain. Ever since the divorce she'd tended to space out on her dad more often. She didn't mean to do it, if she could she would stop. She'd chosen to live with her dad. Her mother, Christine had tried to get her daughter to stay with her. But she hadn't succeeded. Whenever asked why she chose her father over her mother, by close friends and family, she answered the same way. \"He needs me.\" And it was true. Her father, Jimmy Michigan was a novelist who studied history like it was human evolution and he was Charles Darwin; the only reason he stopped thinking about dates and big events was because she presented him with fresh food and cleaned clothes. She had to be there for him, as he trekked through history. Her mother didn't need her. Never had. For a only daughter, she'd spent most of her years outside in jeans and a t-shirt, running around with boys her age and trekking through the woods, and archeological digs with her dad while her mother got her nails done and socialized with the other desperate housewives while juggling her hard earned business, Jacques Favorite, a lingerie store. Really it was a no-brainer for why she chose her father instead of her mother. The choice had been obvious as soon as her mother and father announced the divorce two years ago. Since then she and her father Jimmy had moved all over the US. She'd adjusted to every place they went but she'd most liked LA. It fit her personality, everyone was open and happy there. They had gang problems and there was A LOT of attitude in LA but no one had minded that she played football and didn't wear skirts. LA was the one place where she truly fit in. And now they were going to VIRGINIA. Virginia wasn't even considered a state in her mind. Until her father brought it up she hadn't known it existed. And that's the way she liked it. \"Dad I'm not 6 and going into kindergarten. I'm 18. I've gone to high schools all over the country, Daddy. I can handle one more.\" She said, her accent a mixture of Southern and Northern. They'd moved so many times that whenever she really started sounding like the locals, which only took about two weeks tops, they'd move again. Her voice was choppy and mismatched and sometimes it made her mad to just hear it. It reminded her of how many moves they'd gone through. How many friends and opportunities she'd given up for her father. She tried her best to not be bitter. She'd chosen to go with him, she couldn't guilt him two years later. So she held it in, the anger and the bitterness that threatened to overwhelm her at times, and let it out on the football field. That's how she got through the day. Without football she would have exploded into a million angry pieces years ago. \"I know sweetheart. But you're my little girl and I worry about you … Here we are.\" He said pulling the old beaten up Nissan that he'd gotten out of the divorce into the big high school's parking lot. With a loud creak and clank it crashed to a stop. The only thing stopping her from crashing head first through the wind shield was the thin, crappy seatbelt that wrapped around her waist. But that didn't stop her from banging her head on the back of her seat. \"You need to get the new seatbelts installed. The ones that go across the chest.\" She popped open the door with some effort, using her foot to kick it open. Before getting out she leaned across the seat and pecked her dad on the cheek. He smelt like ink and paper, a crinkly smell she'd grown to love and know well, even as a child. She smiled at him and climbed out of the car. As soon as her sneakers met the pavement she wanted to tear something apart. The very ground here felt different under her feet. She frowned down at the salt-and-pepper ground underneath her before pasting a happy smile on her face. Waving at her dad she watched him go sadly. Today was going to be another horrible first day. Like the rest of them. A/N Sorry about these being so short. They'll get longer when the Titans actually get in it. Disclaimer: I still own nothing but my copyrighted characters and this plot.[Chapter 3] Take Me To Infinity On the way to the office she got jostled around so much that her brain was literally bouncing around in her skull. By the time she got to Krueger's desk she had a horrible migraine. She wanted desperately to hit something. The opportune person was a skinny little blonde white boy who crashed into her while following closely behind a group of tall, muscular black boys. She glared at him until he finally looked away and disappeared inside the building with the group. Before she could get her brains knocked out her ears she hurried into the school office. It was like something out of a science fiction movie. Every flower was perfectly placed, a vase full of only red and white flowers another full of only red. The desk was made of dark mahogany and had red all over it. Red pens, red paper, red hair scrunches, red pencils, more red flowers. It was a cheerleader haven, full of school spirit. \"Hi how may I help you?\" The secretary jumped up from behind the making the already kind of fearful girl jump feet into the air. The woman was a true Titan's fan with her clean cut, ironed white button up, red skirt, and Titan's school pin. \"Umm, I'm new to the school. My name is Sully Michigan. My dad came and registered me the other day.\" The woman's eyes lit up in recognition despite the use of her nickname. Either they'd been waiting for her arrival or her Dad had made a fool of himself yesterday when he registered her. The latter was most probable. \"Of course. I have your stuff right here.\" She shuffled papers all over the desk, a stray clip popping off her crazy bun and popping Sully in the eye. Sully grunted softly kicking the annoying red clip under the desk while simultaneously rubbing at her eye to get rid of the stinging. Her hands were suddenly filled with paper and she looked down at the stack of neat papers. On top was a schedule. \"They assigned you a guide. He should be here soon. He might be a bit late. He's pretty popular and is probably still talking before class starts. Underneath the schedule is a school map to help you when he can't.\" \"Wait, he? Dad said that you guys were assigning me a girl.\" She didn't care really. Actually it made her happier. She was always more comfortable around guys. But it made her kind of nervous. She'd anticipated a girl, and no matter how much a tomboy she was she didn't want a new guy to see her dressed like him. She nervously looked down at her big black t-shirt and tight jeans. As the secretary turned away she snatched a red hair tie off the desk and pulled her shirt back, tying the back so that it hugged her hips and front but bagged in the back. Tucking the leftover shirt into the back she hid it away. When the secretary disappeared into a back room she grabbed two white and black pencils from the desk and another hair tie. Pulling her hair up into a tight bun she carefully pushed the two pencils in to make a X on the back of her head. Tilting her head this way and that she looked at herself in the television screen and deemed herself so girly it was sick. She smiled at the secretary hoping she wouldn't notice the pencils in her hair. She didn't. \"Oh here he is. Meet your student guide.\" She turned at the secretary's words and came face to face with . . . A/N And here's where it gets good. THANK YOU SO MUCH TO THE REVIEWERS I GOT! I'M STARTING A POLL ON MY PROFILE FOR WHO YOU WANT TO BE THE MAIN GUY! PLEASE VOTE. WHEN I'VE DECIDED THE NEXT CHAPTER WILL BE UP REALLY QUICK. THANKS SO MUCH FOR THE REVIEWS! LOVE YA. PLEASE REVIEW AND VOTE ON MY PROFILE.[Chapter 4] Disclaimer: Sadly I don't own any Titans. I own a Titaness but I'm sadly not a lesbian and she's not my type. Sigh. Quarterback His skin was chocolate brown and he had eyes that shined as he smiled at her. \"Hi I'm Jerry Harris. Welcome to T.C. Williams.\" His voice was polite and calm as if he were the most confident person on the planet. It made her feel a bit insecure even though all her life she'd lived by the motto of, say what needs to be said and never be afraid to say it. \"Sullivan Michigan but you can call me Sully.\" She wasn't sure whether he liked her name or not because his smile never faltered, didn't grow or shrink and his eyes were the same glorious brown they'd been in the beginning as well. But she found herself entranced with the way his teeth sparkled as he led her out of the office. \"So what locker number do you have? We'll drop off your stuff then I'll drag you around the school.\" He said grabbing the heavy books from her arms in a gentlemanly fashion. She smiled at him nervously, unused to guys with manners. Back in LA, chivalry had been gone for years. \"Umm 791.\" She said scanning her schedule for the number. It would be somewhat easy to remember because her locker number in LA had been 781. He smiled brilliantly, his teeth shining against his skin. \"Good thing mine is right next to it. 792.\" He said smiling as they made their way to her locker. His eyes shined and she found herself smiling back. \"So where did you move from? You did move here right?\" He asked looking away and over at the lockers to scan for their numbers. She looked down at her feet for a moment before glancing up. \"Los Angeles. Yeah my parents are divorced and I've been living with my dad for years now. One day he just . . . Packed us up and moved us here.\" She finished awkwardly, feeling stupid. She'd just bared out her family story to a complete stranger. Her cheeks were getting red and she tried to hide it by staring down at her feet. He noticed but like a gentleman didn't mention it. Instead he smiled and pat her on the shoulder. \"My father is a reverend and when I'm old enough I'll be one too. Parents always want us to be like them, to follow them, to be with them. It's the way their programmed.\" He smiled at her trying to make her smile and stop looking like he was ready to pitch her off the top of the school. Lips lifting into a tiny smile she nodded but still opted for staring at her feet. He sighed awkwardly bumping his shoulder against hers when his eyes caught his locker number. \"Here we are. Do you know how to open the loooccckkk?\" He drew out the last word as she expertly spun the lock and pulled it open. \"Apparently you do. Have much practice with these, huh?\" His voice had lost some of his smooth calmness at her actions for some reason and she glanced over at him surprised. \"Yeah, um I've been using one since 6th grade. Eventually you don't even have to look at it to open it. It's like breathing or something.\" She said shrugging confidently, happy that, for the moment, she seemed to have the upper hand in the conversation. Hanging her jacket on the hook and sitting her backpack down she reached out for her textbooks. The top shelf was a bit too tall for her but if she stretched she could make it. Hopefully, she didn't fancy losing her balance and toppling onto the floor like a Klutzilla in front of Jerry. \"I'll do it.\" His southern drawl coming out and wrapping her up in his words. She tried to keep the smile down but it dragged her lips up and she grimaced. Damn Jerry Harris, having an effect on her so soon after the move. His shirt sleeve rode up and she watched the muscles in his arm contract and flex as he reached up with one hand and shoved all six heavy books onto the shelf. \"Thanks, Jerry. Is your name really Jerry because it doesn't really fit you. Though I guess I shouldn't be talking at all what with my name being Sullivan. I think my parents were hippies or something when I was born because who names a girl Sullivan.\" She babbled as he watched her fight with her stuff. She finally managed to get her English binder out of the backpack. She was going to be carrying her bag all day with her but English was her last class and she didn't need it with her all day. Her backpack was noticeably lighter when she zipped it up and pulled it on. \"Hey Rev! Yeah Coach Boone says that . . . Well hello.\" Another brown boy came skidding up besides them and when he noticed Sully his eyes roved her up and down, taking in the strange, non-girly outfit she wore. \"Who's this Rev?\" He asked punching Jerry in the arm lightly but never taking his eyes off of Sully. \"I have ears. Who are you?\" She said, he had the air of a cocky bastard, the type of guys she saw all the time in LA. What was more disturbing than that was that this guy seemed to know Jerry, which seemed so drastically weird that she wondered whether maybe they were related or something, brothers. \"Petey Jones, running back for the T.C. Williams Titans.\" He smiled proudly his arm wrapping around Jerry in a manly way. He had a strange accent that made his name sound less childish than it was. She found it endearing somehow but his next words washed that sense away and filled her with anger. \"The Running Back.\" She knew, though he probably didn't know she did, that there were ALWAYS two running backs on the team. It was cocky to discount the backup running back. \"Is that your title or something? Sir Petey Jones.\" She said in a fake British accent. \"What's this 'Rev' business?\" She asked tilting her body so it cut Petey slightly out of her view and she focused on Jerry. Petey, obviously not getting the subtle brush off she was giving him cut Jerry off and answered in a loud and proud voice. \"It's a nickname. Rev here is my best friend, aren't ya Rev? He's always reading the bible and praying to the lord. Especially before our games.\" Petey smiled as her eyes narrowed. \"Games?\" She asked. \"Rev here is the star Quarterback of the T.C Williams Titans.\" A/N Hahahahhahah the poll is still open. You guys thought it was Rev didn't you? Hmm, it might be. Or Petey. Or Julius. Or Gerry. Ooooh I'm a big mean fanfiction author. The poll is still open. THANK YOU SO MUCH. TO EVERYONE THAT REVIEWED AND STORY ALERTED THIS STORY. I LOVE ALL OF YOU![Chapter 5] Disclaimer: If I owned these characters and plot I'd be a rich woman. But I'm not. A/N: Sorry about the wait. I've been working on this one for a long while. I needed to get through this entire monumental chapter. Please And Thank You After narrowly getting away from \"Rev\" and Petey she twisted and turned trying to find her way to the Biology class room that was listed first on her schedule. She was disappointed almost about how Rev was on the football team. She knew that when she signed up to play he would side with his other outraged teammates. Teammates like Petey. It was strange with Petey. His obnoxious attitude was almost endearing, a refreshing jump from Rev's obviously polite attitude. It reminded her of an ex-boyfriend she'd left in LA who had spent the entire time they'd known each other antagonizing her. Petey carried the same aura of him and it made her smile slightly at the thought. It was nice, annoying but nice, to find something similar to home in the new foreign place. \"Hi I'm Sullivan Michigan and I'm new.\" She said to the extremely tall man hovering in front of the large mahogany teacher's desk. He was holding a stack of papers and attempting to take the role. But the class was crazy loud, with people perched on desks and talking at all sorts of volumes. He whipped around as if she'd just snuck up behind him. \"Ah yes I got your information yesterday. Umm there is an open desk in the very back, table on the right. SIT DOWN MR. JONES!\" She blanched at the sight of Petey Jones, standing on top of one of the desks and whistling at blushing girls all around him. So he was a playboy too, she thought frowning as he blew a kiss at her. She started to turn to go around along the wall instead of passing Petey but instead found herself with a face-full of chest. Looking up from the ground her eyes were caught in the most startlingly bright blue eyes she'd ever seen. \"Sorry,\" He muttered limping past her slowly. His blonde hair glinted in the sunlight from the tall classroom windows. She watched over her shoulder as he silently pushed his way through the crowd of students. Mere seconds before the entire class had seemed crazy, but now they went silent, bowing their heads and parting to let him through. Even Petey was silent still standing on the table but silently avoiding the boy's eyes. She wondered silently why everyone was acting like God had just walked into the room. He didn't look like he was too popular, so it wasn't mere friendly respect that was keeping them from bothering him. He wasn't catching anyone's eyes or smiling at anyone. In all actuality he looked like a pained war veteran who'd seen and gone through things he shouldn't have, what with the hard set of his jaw and the cold icy color of his eyes. His entire stature screamed strong. He looked like even a tornado wouldn't knock him over. But he still held this air, the limp maybe being the source of it, of fragility. The class started back up as soon as he sat down and Sully sighed. He'd sat down at the far back table on the right. The table the teacher had assigned her too. She wasn't intimidated. But uncomfortable, he didn't look like the type of guy who enjoyed people or chatting. He most certainly didn't look like he wanted to share a table with her or anyone for that matter. But she forced herself forward, walking past Petey as if he wasn't there, and to the table. Sidling around him like a baby cub around the male lion she placed her bag on the floor by the table and slipping into her chair without moving it. Her hair was still tied up and she wished it was down, to put a shield between her and the intimidating guy next to her but it would be to obvious for her to do it now. So she sat there, exposed and feeling awkward as the first day of kindergarten. Fumbling with her binder she nodded to the teacher as he passed by her table, dropping a small stack of papers on her desk. Flipping through the papers she saw a syllabus, curriculum and a lab safety contract to be signed. She pulled one of the pencil's out of her hair and filled in the necessary boxes then signed messily in cursive. Her signature was unreadable, and it wasn't ever going to change. She wondered how she could have such neat print but have chicken scratch cursive. Finally it seemed the teacher, Mr. Goleta, seemed to gain control of the class and people sat fidgeting in their seats and conversations dying slowly. As Goleta took role, people whispered feverishly trying to fit an entire conversation into a minute or so. Sully sat silently, watching her table partner anxiously out the side of her eye. She wanted to introduce herself but he was staring down at his own hand as if it was the most interesting thing on Earth, pointedly avoiding looking at her. \"Ok for today were studying Human Biology. Not as in reproductive ways.\" Mr. Goleta pointedly said smiling at the fake disappointed faces. \"But as in the way of human reactions. For the rest of class I want you take each other's pulse, if you don't know how I'll come around and show you how, and have a conversation. Ask each other questions and answer in lies and honest answers. Try to guess which is true. When your done I want you to write me down four sentences on a piece of paper on the differences of how truth and lies affect the blood pressure. Get going.\" Sully wanted to disappear through the floor. On her first day, sitting next to the only guy who hadn't tried to speak to her, she had to speak and hold his wrist for a hour long class. What was she going to say to him? Her blood pressure was high enough without her lying. \"I'm Gerry Bertier.\" His voice might as well have been God's as the timbre ran over Sully. Her chest froze up and she averted her eyes, staring down at the table instead of him. \"Your new.\" With that she looked up and met his eyes. They were gorgeous, that she had to say, the blue was sparkling and deep and she couldn't look away. \"Umm yeah just moved to town.\" She, pushing away the girly awkwardness that had filled her moments before, grabbed his arm and pushed up the wrist of his jacket to get to his wrist. Thankfully he wasn't wearing a watch or anything so she pressed two fingers into his wrist and waited to find the pulse. And there it was, a wet pounding sound so consistent it rocked her to her very core. She'd always loved heartbeats, her own, her father's when she'd sleep on his chest. The heartbeat was always consistent and strong and it was partially why she liked running. Some people didn't like running because their heart is pounding so hard, she enjoyed the sound. His fingers were warm when he carefully pushed them into her wrist. His skin on hers sent shocks through her arm and she held her breath. His fingers were rough and his entire hand was giant next to her own. His monster hand looked like it could snap hers in half. \"Where'd you move from?\" He asked unconsciously leaning closer to her. She wanted to look away, gather her bearings and her mind again, but the blue of his eyes wouldn't let her. So instead she stared at him as if she'd never seen a boy before. He didn't repeat himself or make any gesture or move to get an answer, he just waited. \"Umm… Los Angeles. My dad's a historian and wanted to get out of the big city.\" She said nervously, her eyes finally darting away from him and to the other pairs. Most of them were friends who, in their friendship, had simply struck a conversation throwing the instructions to the wind. \"What happened to your arm?\" His voice was suddenly alarmed, making her heart rise further when her wrist was abandoned and her shirt was brushed up a bit. \"My god.\" He whispered his thumb brushing up a pool of blood. She gasped, as he lifted her shirt further to find a long, maybe four inch, deep cut. She hadn't known she had the cut and it didn't hurt, but she groaned anyway, though for a different reason. His hand was warm and rough on her smooth skin and the contrast excited her body, though unwillingly. \"Umm I don't know. I didn't know it was there.\" She said moving away from his hand. He hadn't bothered to move it and it was starting to make her uncomfortable. He cleared his throat and wiped his hand on his jeans. The cut on her arm was starting to burn now that she even knew it was there. Burn really badly. \"How do you not know that your arm is slashed open?\" His voice had a tint of panic in it as if he was actually worried about her. He didn't even know her name! She couldn't object before he was standing and she was up out of her chair and being dragged out of the room. Petey wolf whistled and cringed when they both spun and sent him a death glare. \"Shut your mouth! Shut up!\" She froze and looked at him, noticing how in sync they were. He smiled and grabbed her wrist again, his hand easily diverting her wrist easily. He dragged her through the loud class, obliviously ignoring the stares and whispers as he shuffled them to the front where Mr. Goleta stood watching them. \"Mr. Bertier, Miss. Michigan. What can I do for you?\" He asked crossing his arms across his chest. \"She's hurt, may I bring her to the clinic, sir?\" Gerry said carefully avoiding Sullivan's eyes. \"Of course Gerry, Sullivan be more careful with yourself. I'll call you up.\" A/N Reviews really do make me want to get the next chapter out. Reviews are motivation and silent readers aren't. Please review. Even if it's to say two words.

It was hotter. Hotter than hell—or at least, that's what I liked to think. I fanned my face with my hand as I walked the familiar path from the asphalt parking lot to the football field with my kid sister, Sheryl, in tow. Well, if I was being honest, Sheryl was several paces ahead of me skipping toward the field, but that was just a minor detail. What really mattered was that we practically lived on the football field, even before Mama had left us. But now it was just Sheryl, Coach, and I. A broken family held together by one thing: football. I didn't even want to think what would happen to our family if that game was no longer a part of our lives. You see, Daddy was the head coach of the Hammond High School football team—and they were pretty damn good, thanks to my daddy. Sheryl, was a spitfire at nine years old, helped Coach out with the team; but it was obvious that she lacked frequent interactions with a motherly figure. I tried my best—but that wasn't my job. I was only seventeen years old and on the football field, I preferred to observe—not wanting to get too caught up in the game, despite my harbored passion for it. I was already made fun of enough simply for all the time I spent on the gridiron by both boys and girls. High school was rough enough as it is and I didn't need to make it any worse. I knew my classmates would think less of me if they knew I could throw a football just as well as most of the boys on the team—maybe even better. Well, there was one person who knew; but I had sworn him to secrecy when we were little and so far, he hadn't betrayed my secret…yet. Although, I wasn't sure how much longer that was going to last. Sheryl started to run farther ahead of me onto the practice field while I sat down on the bench nearest to the shade. I was here because I had to be, not because I wanted to be…or at least, that's what I wanted people to think. If I was being completely honest, I was really looking forward to seeing the team win this year. We had a good team. They were going to win state, I just knew it. As I sat down on the bench I adjusted my blouse which was sticking to skin, it was so humid. Summers in Alexandria could be brutal. I reached into my book bag and pulled out my copy of Pride and Prejudice before I began to fan myself with it. At least good literature was good for something, right? I'm just kidding. I'm a bit of a bookworm in between my tomboyish ways. Yet another reason for the girls to make fun of me. I haven't exactly been trained to be ladylike or a future homemaker. Coach ain't much of a lady and Mama ain't around. So, I've been teaching myself…fine, more like miserably failing at teaching myself. While my Mama may have abandoned us, she did have some influence over me and a love of literature was one of those things. But I would much rather read the book than fan myself with it. So I looked around me to see if there was anyone watching. The coast looked clear, so I dug in my bag once more and pulled out the Hammond baseball cap Coach had given me for my birthday two years ago. I piled my long sandy-blonde hair on the top of my head before pulling the baseball cap over. I opened my book up to the page I had marked. Pride and Prejudice was only my favorite books as cliché as that may sound. I tried to read it at least once every summer break since I was fourteen. There was just something about Elizabeth Bennett's relationship with Mr. Darcy that makes one's heart swoon. While I had never gone steady with anyone, I really was a romantic at heart. It's not that I didn't want to go steady with anyone, it's just that…well, Coach could be a bit intimidating. I heard that Alan once was going to ask me to a dance, not even going steady or anything, just a dance; but whatever Coach told him convinced him not to. I tried talking to Coach about it, but he just denied anything ever happened. I still think Coach sees me as a little girl, not as a nearly grown woman who was probably going to leave him for college next year—to pursue some sort of degree that I was pretty sure would once again make me the odd-one-out in a man's world.I was going to be a senior in high school this year, not starting the third grade; but I suppose that's just daddies for you: overprotective. I adjusted the brim of my baseball cap before I turned my attention back to my book. I was to the part where Mr. Bingley came back for Jane. And soon I'd be to my favorite part: Elizabeth and Darcy finally admitting their love for each other. Sometimes I wish a Mr. Darcy would swoop-in and find me, but then I got a reality-check and realized that there were no Mr. Darcy's in front of me, especially not on the gridiron. I turned the page when I was rudely interrupted. \"Hey there, Julie,\" Gerry Bertier greeted me. I looked up to find him standing right in front of me. Shielding my eyes, I commented, \"You're blocking my sun.\" Gerry chuckled to himself and sat right beside me on the bench. I rolled my eyes and turned so that my back was to him. I tried to continue reading my book, but he obviously wasn't giving up. Instead of giving up, the obnoxious boy started to poke at my back until I turned around and glared at him. He just smiled. \"What ya, readin'?\" \"None of your beeswax, Bertier.\" \"C'mon, Juju don't be rude. I'm sure Coach won't like about hearin' 'bout you bein' rude to his best player.\" \"First of all, it's Julie. Ju—lee. Not Juju. Just because you heard my kid sister calls me that, doesn't mean you get to. Second, the only way Coach would find out is if you told him. Thirdly, if you really think you're his best player, you've got another thing coming, Bertier. You hardly rank in Daddy's top ten.\" I turned my back toward him once more. He remained silent for a moment as I hoped he didn't see through my blatant lie. Gerry Bertier was by far Coach's best player, but there was no way in hell I was going to give him the satisfaction of thinking I thought so. Gerry Bertier was probably the most self-centered, egotistical, arrogant boy on the team. Well, besides Ray, but Gerry was in a close second. It was funny because Gerry and I were friends when we were younger. We both had a parent walk out on us, giving us something to bond over. He used to come over to the house quite a bit. Most folks thought he was working on his game with Coach, which was partly true; but he also used to come over to play with me, but when we got to high school things changed. He became the popular, well-liked football player while our friendship was left trailing in his dust. Not to mention that his girlfriend was probably the person who hated me most. He claimed he was just in a hard place with Emma, but really he should just man-up and not let her dominate his life. But then again, going steady with someone meant that you had certain hold on someone else and sometimes stooped to their level of pettiness. \"You stayin' for practice?\" Gerry asked breaking the silence. \"You already know the answer to that,\" I retorted. \"Hey, I'm tryin' to be nice here.\" \"What would your girlfriend think of you bein' nice.\" Gerry didn't answer. I turned my head to look back at him, as he appeared deep in thought, but I just shook my head at him. \"That's what I thought.\" I roughly stood up, not even noticing my book fall from my lap. I just wanted to get away from that boy who infuriated me. I stormed away from the immature football player across the field toward the table where my sister was filling up cups of water for the team. Coach was over there too, talking with her as she worked. I only hoped he didn't see me stomping away from Gerry, otherwise, I was in for some trouble. But it's not like housework was much of a punishment. I already was doing most of the housework: cooking, cleaning, laundry, and babysitting; but Coach's silence and disappointed looks were enough to drive one mad. I was almost to the table when I hear Gerry Bertier calling my name from behind me. I groaned before I turned around to see him hurtling toward me, with my book in his hand. I stop and fold one arm across my chest while I hold the other one out for him to place the book in. \"You forgot this,\" he said. \"I can see that,\" I retorted holding my hand out to take it back. \"Give it here.\" \" Pride and Prejudice; what's it about?\" \"Something you and your tiny brain can never possibly begin to understand.\" I attempted to snatch the book from his hand, but he then held it above my head. I couldn't reach the thing. I jumped a few times to get it, but he then just raised it higher. So, I folded my arms across my chest and glared at him. He smiled at me before he handed the book back, saying that he was just teasing. I gave him a fake smile before I turned around on my heel and walked toward my little sister, Sheryl. \"You're welcome!\" Gerry called after me. I raised my hand in the air to acknowledge his response. If my sister and Coach hadn't been there, I would've considered being very unladylike and flipped him the bird; but I refrained. I walked over to the table and took one of the paper cups filled with water and drank it quickly. Sheryl yanked at my arm causing the paper cup to go flying to the grass. \"Hey! That's for the team,\" Sheryl complained. \"I'm close enough to being part of the team,\" I responded. Sheryl gave me a pointed look. She had near perfected that look and no doubt she had learned it from me. \"You know what I mean.\" \"Do I? Maybe I have amnesia or something.\" \"You'd better be nicer to me or I'll tell Coach you was arguin' with Gerry Bertier again.\" Damn, she was good. For being nine, she was already becoming a professional at manipulation. But I really didn't want to get in trouble again. I was still in trouble from two practices ago for arguing with Gerry in front of Coach. For once I just wanted to be on Coach's good side. For once I wanted to show him that I was capable of some maturity and that there was a reason he depended on me as much as he did. It was just that everything Bertier did made my blood boil. I leaned close to my sister's ear. \"What do you want?\" \"Nothing now, but you'll know when I do.\" \"Fine.\" Coach walked up to us and wrapped his arm around my shoulders. \"Was that Gerry bringing you your book back?\" Coach asked. I nodded my head in response, not really wanting to voice the words. \"Nice boy; he's a real nice boy.\" I bit my tongue as Sheryl looked over to me with a smirk on her face. She's had it in her mind for years that Gerry and I were gonna wind up married someday. And the only way that would happen would be if hell froze over and he was the only man left on the planet…and even then it was still a slim chance. Coach patted my back before he walked away toward the field where his football players were beginning to huddle around the fifty-yard line. I looked back to my sister and she shook her head. \"There's no way this is gonna last,\" Sheryl said. \"You just do your part and keep your mouth shut,\" I responded. \"It's not me you need to worry about.\" I ruffled my little sister's hair to which she responded by pushing me away. So I wrapped my arms around her, hugging her from behind. \"Juju, stop. I'm tryin' to watch.\" \"They just started. I doubt anything interesting will happen anytime soon.\" \"Let. Go.\" I released my sister and placed a kiss on the top of her head before I told her to get a drink. In this heat, one had to drink plenty of water. \"You ain't my mom.\" \"Good as.\" Sheryl rolled her eyes as she plopped herself in front of the water table to watch the practice. I sat on the grass too, but I turned my back to the practice and opened my book again. \"C'mon Kurt, don't let Ray back you down like that!\" \"I'm trying to read,\" I hissed at her. She turned around and stuck her tongue out at me before she went back to watching the team practice. \"You're twice his size!\" \"Sheryl!\" \"Aargh, what are they doing?\" I turned around to see Gerry sack Alan. As much as I loathed, Gerry, he was going to lead this team to victory this year. \"If they keep playing like that, we'll lose every game!\" \"I didn't think that was so bad.\" \"Shows what you know.\" \"Hey, I've been on a football field since before you were born.\" \"I thought you didn't care about football.\" \"I—I don't. I just happen to know about it.\" \"Mhmm, right, you keep telling yourself that.\" I shook my head and tucked a tendril of hair behind my ear. Little sisters could be so annoying sometimes. But then again, it wasn't easy playing mom to someone who was only supposed to be your sister. I never really knew what my role was as far as Sheryl was concerned. Was I supposed to suck-it-up and act like the mother? Or was it a moment when playing the annoyed older sister was appropriate? This time, I just let the conversation drop. There was no use in getting her all riled-up. I sighed and reached over to ruffle Sheryl's hair when she knocked my hand away and pointed off in the distance. One of the senior boys who wasn't out for the football team, but was still popular with the guys came running down the field. He was screaming at the top of his lungs for the other boys to get down to the store. Something was happening, but after that, the only words I could make out were colored and shot. My heart sank and I instinctively reached for Sheryl's arm. This wasn't good. A colored kid had recently been shot not too long ago and now the town was up in arms, especially with the forced integration they were planning. Everyone and everything was tense in Alexandria. To be honest, it was all somewhat terrifying and I wasn't sure how I was supposed to feel about the situation. I just wanted to make it out of high school alive. I could see Coach tense up as I held on tight to a struggling Sheryl. He started yelling something at the boys; but without even listening to a word Coach was saying, the boys took off in a sprint headed for downtown. I was somewhat thankful when Coach Herb came running for us. He opened his arms for Sheryl to run into. He swiftly picked her up with one arm and wrapped his other arm around me. I tried to watch the boys, but Coach Herb told me to keep my head down until we got to the school. After one last glance at the boys who were becoming small black dots, I lowered my head and focused my eyes on the ground. Coach Herb opened the door into the school for me, still holding onto Sheryl before he led us into Coach's office. I opened the door and stopped suddenly in my tracks, causing Sheryl, whom Coach Herb had let down, to run into my backside. She went crashing down to the floor, but I stayed there as if I were frozen in place. I definitely wasn't expecting someone to be standing in my father's office. And I especially wasn't expecting to be seeing him . Author's Note: I'm reposting stories I deleted in a rash decision. Sorry.[Chapter 2] Chapter 2: Rock You Like a Hurricane I couldn't believe it. I slowly blinked as I stared at the colored man standing in front of me with my mouth gaping. I knew it wasn't proper manners to do so, but I really couldn't help it. Especially give the ruckus going on downtown at that very moment. The man was sharply dressed in a suit coat and necktie as he tossed a football in his hands out of pure boredom. Now normally, I wouldn't act so out-of-sorts, but the problem was that this man was standing at my daddy's desk playing with our championship ball from last year. Of course, the man probably didn't know the value of the object. How could he? Although it did raise the question, who in his right mind would play with someone else's belongings? I was certainly raised better than to do that . When Sheryl finally managed to stand on her feet once again, she tried to push me toward him. Thankfully, I was bigger. I stood my ground and didn't budge. She groaned before she side-stepped me and looked right at the man before us. \"Who are you?\" Sheryl blurted. \"Sheryl, that's rude,\" I reprimanded her, flicking her behind the ear. She groaned and held her hand up to her ear before looking at me with her eyes narrowed. \"Do you know who he is?\" \"You know I don't.\" I rolled my eyes before I continued. \"I've never even seen him before.\" My younger sister folded her arms across her chest. \"Then are you gonna ask who he is or not?\" \"Now, if you'd just give me a minute to talk to him, maybe I'd be able to.\" Younger sisters could be so annoying sometimes. I then looked at the man in front of my daddy's desk. The man nodded his head toward us before he tossed the football once more in his hands. It was clear he had been watching the exchange between Sheryl and myself. I faked another smile. I then pulled Sheryl directly in front of me and placed my hands on her shoulders. I dug my fingernails into her shoulders to keep her from going anywhere. She yelped in pain under my grasp, trying to swat my hands away, but I moved my grip from holding tightly onto her shoulders to yanking on the back of her overalls. Sheryl still tried to fight to get away from me, but this time she was trapped. She could only get a few inches before being pulled back toward me. The man in front of us looked at us with an amused expression on his face, as if the scene was quite familiar to him. Since he wasn't going to say anything, I reasoned that I probably should. \"I'm sorry for my sister's lack of manners,\" I apologized. \"We're working on them.\" \"She's young yet,\" the man spoke as he shrugged his shoulders. \"I got a girl about her age.\" \"If you don't mind me asking, who are you?\" I was trying my best to maintain my composure, but at the same time, I was curious enough to want to know who he was. The man in front of me moved to stretch his hand forward like he was thinking about extending it forward. Instead, he brought it to his head and scratched behind his ear. He then responded, \"I'm Herman Boone, the new assistant coach. And you two young ladies might be?\" I bit my bottom lip before I responded. \"I'm Julie and this is Sheryl.\" I pointed nodded down toward my sister before looking at him with a raised eyebrow. \"And you're at my daddy's desk.\" The man opened his mouth to speak before he simply nodded his head. He set the football down back on Daddy's desk and then took a small step away from it. \"Nice to meet you, Julie and Sheryl.\" \"Wish I could say the same.\" He must have caught onto my sarcasm, but wasn't sure if that was how I actually had responded because his brow furrowed as he questioned,\"Excuse me?\" But I never responded to him. I looked beyond him and out the window. Through the blinds, I could see my daddy's truck pulling back into the parking lot. As much as this man standing in my daddy's office bothered me, I was quite curious to see what had taken place. Right now Alexandria drama seemed a little more interesting than a man who was threatening to change a stupid boys' football program. I slowly inched backward, \"Now, if you'll please excuse me, there's something I need to be checking into.\" \"No there's not,\" Sheryl said bluntly. \"Yes, there is,\" I said through gritted teeth before I faked a cough. \"I got a tickle in my throat. I-I need a drink of water.\" I pulled Sheryl by her overalls out of the office, leaving the new coach standing alone in my daddy's office. I released my sister as we began to walk down the hallway. She folded her arms childishly across her chest as we walked. \"I know you're not thirsty,\" she muttered. \"You're right, I lied. But Coach is back and I wanna know what happened. Don't you?\" Sheryl's interest piqued as she ran in front of me as I walked to meet Coach. Once outside, we found Coach Tyrell waiting by the door that Coach was going to walk through. He tried to tell us to go back to Coach's office, but the door flung open before he could enforce what he was telling us to do. Coach walked through the door with Alan, Gerry, Ray, and John. Alan noticed me standing there. He smiled and nodded his head at me. John and Ray simply nodded their heads, while Gerry ignored me. It was as if he only noticed me when no one was around. Although, right now he was just too pissed off to even notice me. Sheryl and I ran to catch up with Coach, who was followed by Coach Tyrell and the boys. Not watching where I was going, I ran into Gerry, quite literally. He glanced over at me but didn't say anything as Coach Tyrell started talking to him while I passed him to walk next to my father. \"Gerry, son, your heart's in the right place, but you ought to know better than to embarrass the coach like that,\" Coach Tyrell spoke. I looked back at Gerry, but his face was like stone. He scowled for a moment before he began to talk. \"Hell, why don't you just kick them all off the team?\" Gerry sneered. \"I don't want to play with any of those black animals.\" Gerry finished his sentence as we rounded the corner into Coach's office, only to find the man who had been waiting for Coach, still there. This man who claimed to be the new assistant coach was still standing there holding that damnfootball, , he must have picked back up. The man must have heard Bertier because he was looking right at our group in the doorway. Everyone's eyes widened at the sight of him, well everyone except for Sheryl and me. Seeing as we had already met the man. \"Nice one, Bertier,\" I hissed. \"Shut it, Julie,\" Gerry scoffed. Daddy stood the closest to the stranger in the office, while Coach Tyrell stood back a few steps with his arms folded across his chest. He was clearly trying to intimidate the man. \"Who are you?\" Coach Tyrell blurted. \"As I already told the young ladies, I'm Herman Boone. I'm the new assistant coach,\" the man spoke. Daddy, Coach Tyrell, and the boys looked at myself and Sheryl. I grinned sheepishly as Daddy shook his head. \"Julie, you and your sister go for a little walk,\" Coach said. I stood there and waited for him to dismiss the boys, but he didn't. Coach pushed Sheryl over to me. My brown furrowed. \"What about them?\" I asked as I nodded to the boys. Coach folded his arms across his chest. He meant business. \"You're my daughter and that was an order.\" While I probably shouldn't have continued to defy him, I didn't think it was fair that the boys would be allowed to stay but I had to leave. So, I pointed that out. \"Fine we'll go, but what about them?\" Coach's jaw jutted. He wasn't pleased with my response. \"You worry about you and your sister and do as you're told.\" I rolled my eyes childishly and groaned, \"This is completely unfair.\" Coach shot me a look and I knew that was my last cue to take Sheryl and leave without facing repercussions. Hell, I was probably already facing them for acting disrespectfully in front of a complete stranger. But it wasn't fair that the boys got to stay in there and I wanted to make sure that he realized that. The women's suffrage movement hadn't been for nothing, not that he cared. Sheryl and I walked out of the office and into the hallway. I leaned up against the locker closest to the door, knocking my head backward onto it. Sheryl leaned against the locker across the hallway from me with the same glum expression on her face. I wanted to sneak back and figure out what was going on. But I couldn't do it if Sheryl was going to tattle on me. Plausible deniability was my best option. \"Why don't you go for a walk or something,\" I suggested. She raised an eyebrow at me. \"I'm not going if you're not,\" Sheryl sassed. I narrowed my eyes at her. \"Well, you're younger and should do as you're told.\" \"So should you.\" Damnit. She had me there. I groaned, \"Well it's not fair that he lets them boys be in there. I'm older than Alan and he gets to be in there.\" \"Coach isn't gonna be happy when he finds out you're listening.\" . \"You're annoying, you know that?\" \"So are you. But I'm nine, what's your excuse?\" \"Fine, how 'bout this: we both stay here and listen and no one does any tattling? Deal?\" I held my hand out. Sheryl held her hand out and we both shook the air. \"Deal.\" \"Good, now get over here and be quiet.\" I motioned for her to come to my side of the hallway quick. Sheryl quickly tiptoed across the hallway and we both inched closer to the office door. She stood the closest and I stood behind her, leaning slightly over her trying to hear what they were saying in there. I poked my head around the corner to see into the office, but the colored man noticed me and raised his eyebrows at me. I quickly pulled my head back; there wasn't much of a prayer to get a good look in there. We were stuck just with listening. \"I won a couple of titles down in North Carolina,\" the new coach stated. \"That's double \"A\" ball,\" Coach Tyrell scoffed. \"This here's Virginia. We play triple \"A\" ball.\" \"What an opportunity for me then…\" the new coach started before pausing for a moment. \"To learn…from the best.\" \"Well, I think that's enough for today,\" Coach said. \"I'm sure we'll be in touch.\" I could tell that Coach was trying to dismiss the man as civilly as he could, but I could tell from his tone that he was none too happy about the last part. I heard the man thank Coach for allowing him a moment of his time before his footsteps could be heard coming closer toward them. I quickly pulled Sheryl away from the corner and slid to the floor. \"Act natural,\" I hissed at Sheryl. Sheryl nodded and followed my direction as she slid to the floor. I then slid her across the tile floor so that she sat in between my legs as I began to braid her hair which was already pulled back in a ponytail. The colored coach walked out and looked down both directions of the hallway before he looked down to Sheryl and me on the floor. I pretended not to notice and focus on Sheryl's unruly hair while my younger sister sat with her head in her hands while I played with her hair. Sheryl looked up at the man and he nodded his head. \"Your secret is safe with me ladies,\" the man stated. \"What secret?\" Sheryl asked innocently. \"Don't know what you're talking 'bout, sir. I've been sittin' here fixin' my sister's hair,\" I added. \"You girls may be able to fool your daddy with that act, but you can't fool me,\" the man said. \"What are you gonna do about it?\" I asked. The man shook his head. I looked up to him and nodded my head. He pretended to have a hat on his head to tip forward before he walked down the hallway, headed straight for the door. Sheryl and I still continued to sit on the floor while I played with her hair. \"That was close,\" I said. \"Yeah because you opened your big, fat mouth,\" she said. \"He already knew. He saw me trying to look in the office. What was I supposed to do, lie?\" \"You don't seem to have a problem lyin' to Coach.\" \"I don't lie to Coach...\" I began. Sheryl turned around and gave me a pointed look. \"Much. I don't lie much.\" \"You still lie to him.\" \"A little white lie never hurt nobody,\" I said as I tugged a little extra hard at Sheryl's hair for effect. Her hand flew back to her hair, but I moved it out of the way. \"Ouch, that hurt.\" \"You should try brushing your hair.\" Sheryl shot me a pointed look. \"I brushed it this morning.\" But I knew she was bluffing. I had watched her roll out of bed, head downstairs for breakfast, and then go right out the door. \"Now who's the one lyin'?\" \"Fine, I brushed it last night,\" Sheryl said wincing in pain. \"Besides, I thought you said a little white lie never hurt nobody.\" \"Looks like I lied,\" I chuckled, but my sister didn't. She just groaned. But the more I thought about it, Sheryl did have a point. I probably lied to Coach more than I should have, but what else did he expect? After all, I was still partially my Mama's daughter despite the lack of her presence in my life. The boys began to walk out of the office, so I stood up to follow them to try and get some more information out of them. Well, by them I was going to get it out of Alan. He always had a soft spot for me and I could at least stand him. \"Alan,\" I called as I jogged after him. Alan stopped and looked back, but so did Gerry who held back Ray from walking any farther by placing his hand on his friend's chest. I tried to ignore Gerry's looks as I jogged up to Alan while Gerry stood only a few feet away with Ray. \"Hey Julie,\" Alan smiled. \"I was wonderin' if you could tell me what happened in there,\" I said sweetly. \"Well, Coach…\" \"He won't find out that I know. And if he does, I'll just tell him Bertier told me.\" I looked over to Bertier and raised my eyebrows, daring him to challenge me. He didn't say anything, but instead he walked over to where Alan and I stood in the hallway. Alan looked at us and even he could easily see the tension between Gerry and me. Alan placed his hands up in defense as he looked between Gerry and me. \"I don't wanna cause any trouble,\" Alan stated. \"I promise you that any trouble won't be started because of you ,\" I said glaring at Gerry who just shook his head. \"Well, I…\" Alan fumbled for words. \"You wanna know what happened?\" Gerry questioned, taking a step closer toward me and towering over me. He was trying to intimidate me. But I held my ground. \"Not from you,\" I scoffed. \"Well, I'll tell you what's not going to happen. I ain't gonna be playin' for no Coach Coon.\" Gerry looked rather angry. He had over a foot in height on me, but I was not going to be intimidated by him. Especially now that he was trying to make a show in front of Alan and Ray. He could be nice and sweet to me with only my father and sister present but throw anyone else in the mix and Gerry Bertier became an ass. \"You can play the tough guy Bertier, but just remember that I know things you don't want gettin' out,\" I hissed. I knew I had probably just delivered a low punch to him, but I was sick and tired of his games. He quickly backed away and bit his bottom lip. He immediately knew what I was referring to. I had seen him cry so many times that I probably couldn't even count them all. Having his football teammates knowing that he was somewhat in touch with his emotional side could be easily embarrassing. \"My mama taught me right, so I'm not gonna get into this with you and simply walk away,\" Gerry said. \"A move you've perfected,\" I retorted. \"Julie Elizabeth Yoast,\" Coach shouted. I groaned and threw my head back as I could hear my father stomping toward me. I was in trouble. He probably hadn't even heard the entire conversation. Probably only the bits where I had been nasty to Bertier. Through narrowed eyes, I looked at Bertier who was turning away attempting to hide the smile on his face. I then turned my head to see my father standing in between Alan and me with his arms folded across his chest and a stern look on his face. \"Apologize,\" Coach said sternly. I looked at him and I could tell that he meant business. If I wanted any life outside of chores and going to football practices, I had to do as he said; and even then it wasn't guaranteed. \"Sorry,\" I muttered in Gerry's direction. \"Julie Elizabeth you know how to speak properly,\" Coach reprimanded. \"It's fine, Coach,\" Gerry said. \"No, it's not Gerry. Go on, Julie.\" I folded my arms across my chest. I knew that there was no way of getting out of this unless I just grit my teeth and did it. So, I did. \"I'm sorry, Bertier,\" I apologized once more through gritted teeth. Coach shook his head and looked at me disappointedly. \"Julie go wait in the truck with Sheryl while the boys and I carry some boxes out.\" \"Yes, Coach.\" I looked for my sister and we walked out of the school to Coach's truck where I would soon be receiving my punishment for sassing Gerry Bertier. I don't know what it was about that boy, but something about him got me all riled up and I really needed to stop letting Gerry Bertier get the better of me. Author's note: Chapter 2 is back up! Thank you to everyone who read/reviewed/favorited/followed this story. Means a lot![Chapter 3] Chapter 3: A Change is Gonna Come By the next day, I stood at the stove stirring a pot of mac & cheese for lunch. Personally, I thought it was too hot to make mac & cheese, but Sheryl had asked and so I obliged. I would have been more than satisfied with just a sandwich, but my maternal instincts toward my sister won me over. And what was mac & cheese without hot dogs sliced up and mixed in? It's about as gourmet as my cooking gets. I turned the burner that was cooking the hot dogs off before I went to strain the noodles. It was almost time to eat. I glanced at the table and rolled my eyes. I had told Sheryl to set it when I started cooking and it still hadn't been done. \"Sheryl!\" I called dumping the noodles into the colander. \"Get your little buns in here and set the table.\" She didn't respond, so I hollered, \"Now!\" \"Geez, I was coming,\" Sheryl groaned as she walked into the kitchen a few seconds later as I dumped the ingredients for the mac & cheese into the pot. I glanced at her over my shoulder as she wiped her hands on her overalls. She reached for the upper cupboard door where we kept the plates, but I swatted at her hand and pointed to the sink. \"Wash your hands first. Daddy ain't gonna wanna eat on plates touched by your grubby hands.\" Sheryl looked down at her hands and frowned. \"They ain't grubby.\" \"Were you playing outside?\" I asked her with my hands on my hips. She rested her hands on her eyebrows and arched an eyebrow at me. \"Yeah,\" she responded as if the answer was obvious. She was gonna be trouble some day, but I had to stay strong. Sheryl was my responsibility. So, I didn't back down. \"And have you washed them since you got inside?\" \"No,\" she muttered, knowing full-well that I had her there and that I was gonna win this one. I smiled. \"Then they're grubby. Wash 'em and then set the table.\" Reluctantly and grumbling under her breath the entire time, Sheryl did as she was told. When she wasn't looking, I breathed a sigh of relief. It wasn't easy playing mother to your sister. I started slicing up the hot dogs as Sheryl set the table before I mixed them in with the mac & cheese. \"Is there anything for dessert?\" Sheryl asked. I looked back to find her leaning against the kitchen peninsula and behind her, the table was set. I then nodded my head toward the refrigerator. \"I made Jell-O,\" I responded. Her expression soured for a moment. \"Did you mess it up this time?\" she asked. After rolling my eyes, I said, \"I followed the directions.\" Which was true, but I also thought I followed the directions the last time. \"Sure, you did.\" \"I did,\" I quickly retorted back at her, despite knowing that it probably wasn't the best idea to argue with a ten-year-old. Thankfully, Daddy chose that time to walk into the room, which shut both of us up. \"Smells good,\" he said offering me a smile. I smiled back at him. I knew he was grateful that I had slowly taken over the cooking responsibilities because, despite my poor cooking skills, he was even worse. To be fair though, I was pretty sure I received a few more cooking lessons than he had. Daddy sat down at the table and looked at my sister. \"Sheryl, why don't you give your sister a hand.\" Before Sheryl could say something about already having helped me, I said, \"I got it. Just gotta bring the food over to the table.\" He nodded his head and gestured for Sheryl to sit down as I dumped the macaroni, cheese, and hot dog concoction into a serving dish. Honestly, I would have sooner preferred just to set a hot pad on the table and then set the pot on that because it would mean fewer dishes, I knew that it wasn't the proper way to do things. Once the macaronidish, , the store-bought rolls, and a pitcher of lemonade were on the table, I sat down to eat with my family. Daddy said grace and then Sheryl quickly scooped herself some macaroni. I said a silent prayer hoping that I hadn't messed the dish up. But I breathed a sigh of relief when my sister took a second bite without commenting on the first. I then dished myself some food and began to eat. We were almost finished with lunch when the doorbell rang. Daddy told Sheryl to go answer the door and she did as she was told. A few moments later a man from the school board followed Sheryl inside. \"I apologize for the interruption,\" the man said. \"Why don't you join us, Jim,\" Daddy said gesturing to the open seat. \"Julie makes a mean mac & cheese that'll make her future husband a happy man someday\" He gave me a quick wink and I felt my face flush. I knew he was just trying to be nice and compliment me, but it wasn't that good. The man smiled at me and nodded. \"I wish I could, but I told Helen I'd be back for lunch.\" Daddy softly smiled. \"So, what can I do for you, Jim?\" he asked. Jim shifted rather uncomfortably. \"Perhaps we should discuss this in your office.\" It was obvious that whatever he wanted to tell Daddy, he didn't want to do in front of Sheryl and me. But Daddy figured that out too. \"Anything you need to tell me you can say in front of my girls,\" Daddy said folding his arms across his chest. \"Besides, they're just gonna listen in and find out anyway.\" Sheryl and I looked at each other rather sheepishly, but we both knew it was the truth. Jim slowly exhaled a breath he must've been holding onto. \"Then why don't we do this outside. I don't wanna spoil your meal.\" It was obvious that whatever Jim had to tell us, he didn't look happy about it, meaning that it couldn't possibly be good news. I looked at Daddy. He nodded. \"Girls, why don't we head outside for some fresh air.\" It seemed like an odd thing to do, but I could tell that Daddy was trying to make this easier on Jim. Whatever it was. The only thing I could tell was that it was going to be bad. Thoughts raced through my mind as I followed Sheryl through the patio door. I tried to figure out what he could possibly need to tell us. But my predictions were nowhere close to the news he actually delivered to us. \"There's no easy way to say this, so I'm just gonna come out with it Bill,\" Jim said shoving his hands in his pants pockets. \"The school board held an emergency meeting this morning and it was decided that that negro, Herman Boone is gonna be the head coach at T.C.\" The news felt like someone punched me in the stomach. Daddy was supposed to be the head coach. He had earned that title. He had worked hard and now just to have it taken away from him, it seemed wrong. Just plain wrong. While I couldn't hide my dismay, I kept my thoughts to myself, unlike my sister. \"It's not fair!\" Sheryl shouted as my father absently tried to hold onto her, still processing Jim's words. \"It's not fair! My daddy's head coach! This is gonna be his Hall-of-Fame year!\" I wished I could react the way Sheryl was, but I was old enough to know better. Jim tried to plead with Sheryl. \"Now one is trying to take away your daddy's future in the hall.\" But Sheryl continued as she started to fight against the grip my father held on her shoulder. \"You can't just walk in here and take away my daddy's job.\" \"That's enough, Sheryl,\" Daddy said rather quietly the first time. But when she wouldn't listen, his voice became stern as he repeated himself. \"That's enough, Sheryl.\" He gave a firm tug on her overalls, which made her quiet down and instead, she started to silently sulk. I stood there, still trying to process it all. Jim and Daddy continued to speak, but I wasn't listening to them. I couldn't focus on their conversation because my own thoughts were drowning them out. Just when things finally seemed to be going good for us, the rug was slipped out from beneath us again. We had mostly recovered from Mama leaving us and now, here we were facing another challenge. My first thought was to curse God for forsaking us, but I knew that wasn't right. At least not from what I had learned at church on Sunday mornings. Daddy rested a hand on my shoulder and I looked at him, trying to hold back my tears. I could tell that he knew what I was thinking. Probably, because he was thinking it too. I sniffled and then said, \"How 'bout that Jell-O?\" It seemed stupid, but I had to say something otherwise I would just continue to dwell on what I couldn't change. Daddy seemed to like my idea, so he ushered Sheryl and myself inside as Jim walked back to his car and left us to deal with the aftermath. Surprisingly, we ate our Jell-O in silence. Silence rarely happened at our dinner table. The last time I remembered it being so quiet was just after Mama left us. But we all ate our Jell-O, which turned out just fine this time. An hour later, the phone rang. I answered the phone. It was a school calling to make Daddy an offer. Bad news sure travels fast around here. Daddy took the phone from me and talked with the man on the other line while I cleaned the dishes and straightened up the mess I had made in the kitchen. It was supposed to be Sheryl's job to do the dishes, but I needed something mindless to do, to keep my mind off things. By eight o'clock that night, the phone had rung ten more times with schools calling to make Daddy offers. While it was comforting to know that schools were wanting Daddy to work for them, I wasn't sure I was ready to leave Alexandria. This was home. But if I was being honest, I wanted to stay just in case my mama ever came looking for us then she would know exactly where to find us. Despite knowing that would never happen, it was a childish longing of mine. I was knocked out of my reverie when the doorbell rang. When Sheryl didn't yell got it , I walked over to the door. Who could possibly be coming to visit us at this hour? Sometimes, one of the guys from the football team would show up, so I just assumed it was one of them. I certainly wasn't expecting to see Herman Boone on the other side of that door. But that is who stood in front of me. \"Good evening,\" he greeted me. \"It's Julie, right?\" I was sure my expression was gobsmacked, so I just curtly nodded my head. But before I could say anything, Sheryl appeared at my side with a scowl on her face and her arms folded across her chest. \"What do you want?\" she snarled. Coach Boone pursed his lips for a moment before he said, \"Is Coach Yoast here?\" Sheryl responded before I could. She was quick like that. \"We're busy...interviewing for head coaching jobs. Gotten 11 offers already and certainly no time for you.\" Knowing how rude she sounded, I flicked my sister's ear. \"Ouch,\" she hissed before looking up at me. \"It's the truth.\" \"It don't mean now's the time to go running your mouth,\" I hissed back at her. \"Girls, I can take it from here,\" Daddy said approaching the door. Sheryl and I looked back at him and hung our heads. Daddy looked at Coach Boone and nodded his head. \"Well, come on in. I've got an office out back.\" Coach Boone looked at Sheryl and I before he took a step forward. \"Excuse me,\" he said as he passed between us and followed Daddy into the house. They were headed back for the patio doors and then out into the barn in the back which was Daddy's office. Sheryl and I waited a few seconds before we looked at each other. \"Let's go,\" I whispered to her, nodding my head outside. \"If we go out the front and sneak around the side he won't see us coming.\" \"I thought you were trying to be all mature now,\" Sheryl said with her arms folded across her chest, glaring at me. I rolled my eyes. \"Do you wanna know what they're talking about or not? Besides, Daddy probably already knows we're gonna listen in any way. He said as much earlier.\" Sheryl smiled and shook her head. \"Who are you and what have you done with my sister?\" I couldn't think of a great comeback, so I just muttered, \"Shut up.\" And then we quietly escaped out the front door. We rounded our way around the house and dove into the bushes beneath Daddy's open office window. Clearly, we had never done anything like this before. I motioned for Sheryl to be quiet as I put a finger up to my mouth. She just nodded as we listened in on Daddy and Coach Boone's conversation from the bushes. Coach Boone's voice carried through the open window, \"Look, I can't even spell diplomacy and I'm sorry about the way things went down, but make no mistake, I am qualified to be this school's head coach.\" Sheryl and I couldn't help but look at each other. We both rolled our eyes and waited for Daddy to respond. \"Sure. You've been in, what, 4 or 5 programs in the past 10 years?\" Daddy asked. \"With 4 or 5 championships,\" Coach Boone argued back. There was a moment of silence between them. I almost wondered if it was the end of their conversation, but Daddy added, \" This isn't about me. I'm worried about my boys.\" I could see where that would matter. Those boys had worked very hard to get to where they were. Even Gerry Bertier, whom I couldn't stand, didn't deserve this . Coach Boone scoffed. \"Well, I ain't gonna cook 'em and eat 'em. The best player will play. Color won't matter.\" Daddy replied, \"From the looks of our little situation we got us here, I'd say it's about all that does.\" I sighed. I agreed with him. Don't get me wrong, I didn't think I was better than them , but I didn't think it was fair how my daddy's job was taken right out from underneath him. Coach Boone sighed. \"Yeah, you're right. We're in a tough spot., Coach. You. Me. The whole city. But I think that it would go a long way to smooth things over if you would stay, work on the staff, be a defensive coordinator, assistant head coach.\" My eyes widened. He wanted Daddy to work with him? But Daddy was thinking the same thing. \"Work under you?\" Daddy asked. \"If that's the way you see it,\" Coach Boone responded. I quickly clamped my hand around Sheryl's mouth. I knew she was going to have something to say and I didn't want her big mouth giving us away. I was surprised when she didn't fight me. Instead, we both sat there and listened for what Daddy was gonna say next. \"Good night, Coach,\" he said and I knew the conversation was over. Daddy didn't want to say any more on the matter. Things went silent and I removed my hand from Sheryl's mouth. \"Who does he think he is? Coach ain't gonna work under him. No way,\" she whispered. I nodded my head as I heard the door to the barn swing shut. I could feel Sheryl wanting to move away, but I wrapped my arms around her overalls to keep her back. Through the bushes in the dim light, I could see Coach Boone come to a stop. He stood there for a moment with his back to us. \"Good night, girls ,\" Coach Boone's said. Sheryl and I looked at each other in shock as the man started to walk away down the gravel path. How did he do that? How did he know we were there? My sister and I saved these questions until after Coach Boone had disappeared and we ran back to the house, trying not to get caught by Daddy. But as we journeyed across the lawn, we couldn't figure out answers to any of our questions. Although Sheryl was quick to believe that the man had eyes on the back of his head. I knew better. Once we were in the house, I shooed Sheryl upstairs to get ready for bed. I followed her upstairs, not wanting a run-in with my father tonight. Sheryl went to the bathroom to brush her teeth and I went to my room and closed the door behind me. I flung myself onto my bed, the springs of the bed groaning beneath my weight. It was funny how much things could change in a day. But this wasn't the first life-changing day of my life. I think what scared me most was how it resembled the day Mama left and I wasn't sure how long it would take for me to find normal again. I rolled onto my back and glanced upward at the ceiling. I said a silent prayer, hoping that a miracle would happen because I couldn't think of any other way to fix what had just happened. Author's Note: So there's that. haha. I'd just like to thank that anon on Tumblr for asking about this story. It's what got me going! :)[Chapter 4] Chapter 4: A Family Affair I walked into the kitchen still in my pajamas the next morning to find Coach making breakfast. I froze and stood there staring at him in confusion. He never made breakfast. I made breakfast. I made breakfast every morning since Mama left. Coach smiled at me as he scrambled eggs in a bowl. It was a strange sight. \"Good morning, Julie.\" \"Good morning,\" I responded hesitantly. He just smiled at me. Weird. I blinked several times to make sure I wasn't hallucinating. I had never done drugs, but I suspected that this feeling could be comparable. \"Have a seat,\" Coach said and gestured to a chair with his head. \"I'm making breakfast.\" \"Yeah, I can see that,\" I responded as I slowly inched toward the chair. \"Are you sure you got that?\" Coach stopped and looked at me pointedly. \"I know how to make scrambled eggs and toast, Julie Elizabeth.\" I nodded head in agreement, not quite sure if I believed him. I couldn't remember the last time I saw him cook. Coach's cooking was usually a bowl of cereal or heating up leftovers. Although, someone had to do the cooking when I was younger when Mama was too drunk or up and left for a time. I don't remember much of those days, but if Mama wasn't there to do it, then I suppose Coach must have done it. I must have blocked those memories out. Truthfully, most memories of my mama were too painful, so it was probably better that way. \"Sheryl should be coming down soon,\" Coach stated. I just nodded my head, unsure of what to talk about with him. Usually, we talked football, but since he wasn't coaching anymore, I didn't want to bring up a sore subject. So, I just sat there watching him cook the eggs. They were almost done, so he sprinkled some cheese in the pan and cooked the eggs and cheese for about thirty seconds before he dumped the eggs into a bowl. Usually, we just scooped the eggs onto the individual plates. Cheese in the scrambled eggs? Put in a fancy bowl? I couldn't help but wonder if this was Coach's way of trying to soften an upcoming blow, that he was fully aware of but Sheryl and I were not. Coach called for Sheryl. A few seconds later, she walked in, still in her pajamas. Her hair was going off in all directions as she yawned and rubbed her sleepy eyes. I looked at my dad who just shook his head before he put a cover on the bowl of eggs and set to making the toast. \"What's he doing?\" Sheryl asked me. \"Making breakfast,\" I told her, opening my arms for her to come to me. She waddled over to me and rests her head on my shoulder as I wrap my arms around her. She closed her eyes, but I gently shook her to stay awake. She groaned. Coach ushered us to the table and we sat down. He offered grace before the scooping of eggs and grabbing of toast commenced. Sheryl immediately dug into the scrambled eggs as I spread strawberry jam from the Boselys on my toast. \"So, girls, I was thinking we should go out for dinner at a restaurant tonight,\" Coach said. We never ate out at restaurants for dinner. We usually only went out if we were invited to someone else's house or it was understood that someone else was paying. I stared at my father. He was acting really weird. There was something else going on. \"Any special reason?\" I asked. \"Does there have to be a reason to take my girls out for dinner?\" \"This wouldn't have anything to do with that meeting they've been planning at Hal's, would it?\" I took a bite of my toast as I watched him figure out how to respond to me. \"Julie, I'm the parent around here. Don't question me.\" His voice was stern and his expression told me that his decision was final and that was that. No ifs, ands, or buts about it. I nodded my head, \"Yes, sir.\" I then focused my attention on eating my food, while still thinking that there was something more than just dinner happening tonight. My suspicions about something going on at Hal's were confirmed when the mailman asked what Coach's announcement was gonna be. I just smiled and told him that he'd have to wait and see. That the only thing I could tell him because even I wasn't entirely sure what he was gonna announce and I lived in the same house as him. I suspected that it was that he wasn't gonna be coaching in Alexandria anymore, but Coach hadn't discussed the decision with us. And while I understood that he was the parent, I felt I was old enough to at least be included in the decision-making process. Later that afternoon, Coach came in the house from his office and told Sheryl and I to get ready to go out for dinner. I figured I should probably make myself look presentable for public. A pair of jeans and a school t-shirt wasn't going to cut it, especially if Coach was going out of his way to make this dinner special. So, I should do the same. I walked to my closet and opted for a long floral print skirt and a blue sleeveless blouse. I softly curled my hair and let it cascade down my back. The last time I had been this spiffed up had been the homecoming dance last year. Coach made me go. Although, I suppose it didn't really matter what I looked like tonight. We weren't likely to see anyone besides the team, and their fathers at Hal's-none of whom I really wanted to my any impression on. But, I also didn't want to be an embarrassment to Coach in front of them. I groaned. Sometimes is sucked being a girl. Why hadn't I been born a boy? Things would have been so much easier. With the first battle won, I moved onto the next one: Sheryl. I tried to get her to wear a skirt. I honestly tried, but she flat-out refused and I knew that was a battle I had no hope of winning. So I made a compromise with her. She could wear her jeans and a nice blouse if she let me French braid her hair. I was happy she accepted my deal, but that didn't stop her from complaining while I braided her hair. It was then time to head downtown. When we got to Hal's, Coach held the door open for Sheryl and me to walk inside. To my surprise, the place was already full. Although my prediction about it being the team and their fathers proved to be accurate. I placed my hand on Sheryl's shoulder and tried to push her through the crowd. We walked past Gerry Bertier who stood there with his mouth wide, staring at me in shock. I rolled my eyes. \"You're gonna catch a fly with your mouth open like that,\" I retorted before I flipped my curls and moved past him. I looked around and tried to find someone to stand by that I could tolerate. I chewed my bottom lip when I spotted Alan Bosely waving at me. He was seated at a table with his father and there were extra places. I smiled at him and tried to push Sheryl in that direction. \"Why are you always so mean to Gerry?\" Sheryl asked, looking back at Bertier. \"You wouldn't understand,\" I said before I gently smacked her bottom. \"No, scootch, scootch.\" She rolled her eyes at me, but she at least did as I told her. We sat down at the table with the Boselys. Alan offered me a smile as I sat down next to him. \"Hey Julie,\" he greeted. \"Hey, Alan. How're you doing?\" I asked him. He shrugged his shoulders. I chuckled. \"Yeah, I get that.\" Alan looked over his shoulder before he leaned a little closer to me and whispered, \"Is it true they gave the head coaching job to that colored fella?\" I saw Bertier turn around and look at Alan and me. I nodded my head in response to Alan's question while glaring at Bertier. Bertier narrowed his eyes before he turned back around, muttering something to Ray who was sitting beside him. I wasn't quite sure what I had done to piss him off this time. Then again, he always seemed pissed-off as far as I was concerned. It was then I realized I was still staring at him, so I shifted in my seat and turned to give Alan a smile. Alan's father, Fred, sat on the other side of his son. He looked at me and smiled, leaning toward his son. \"You look nice today, Julie,\" Alan's father said. \"Thank you, sir,\" I responded, tucking a stray tendril of hair behind my ear before I glanced at Alan. He looked rather uncomfortable, his face a little redder than it usually was. \"Alan tells me that you…\" \"Dad,\" Alan groaned before he leaned forward and rubbed his face. I watched him curiously as he ran his fingers through his hair. Alan's father looked at his son just chuckled. \"Forget I said anything, Julie. Forget I even said anything.\" Alan shook his head and I arched an eyebrow in confusion. I certainly had missed something there. I wasn't sure what it was nor was I sure that I wanted to find out. Thankfully, I didn't have long to dwell on things because Coach stepped onto the small platform in the front of the room, causing everyone to instantly quiet. For a moment, you probably could have heard a pin drop it was so quiet. But soon the whole room erupted in thunderous applause. Coach smiled all embarrassed-like before he motioned for the applause to stop. Slowly, the clapping stopped until it was just Sheryl. I reached over and grabbed her hands and looked her in the eye. She rolled her eyes at mine and then shoved her hands into her pockets. I returned my gaze to Coach. He fidgeted a little with everyone staring at him. I could tell that he was planning his words very carefully even though I was sure he had probably went over these words a hundred times in his head this afternoon. \"Come on, Daddy,\" I whispered under my breath. Coach cleared his throat. \"It's been a rare privilege to have lived here as long as I have coaching your boys…\" He paused. There were a few grunts and other acknowledgments to Coach's statement. I took a deep breath with Coach, knowing that what he said next was going to deliver a blow. He began again. \"I'll be taking the year off.\" Whispers of no echoed through the room. Angered expressions began to fill the room. I folded my hands in front of my face. This was the part I didn't know yet-what he planned on doing. It was probably easier for him this way. To tell Sheryl and I when he was telling everyone else. After all, a lot of these boys seemed like family after all the years they had spent together. I glanced over at Alan, he seemed very much like the brother I never had. Coach managed to quiet them down again before he continued. \"After Julie graduates, I'll be moving to Loudon and taking the head coaching job at Loudon High.\" I inhaled sharply. That was why he hadn't told me. He knew I would try to change his mind because I had been a big part of his decision. Even though the schools were integrating, he wanted me to finish out my senior year even though he easily could have found something somewhere. The crowd instantly reacted to Coach's statement. Cameras began to flash. Men were on their feet shouting. Alan's father pounded his fist against the table. Sheryl who had been resting her elbows on the table with her head in her hands jumped a little Alan's father's reaction. I reached out and grabbed her hand before scanning the room myself. Alan and I briefly made eye contact but he too was searching the room. I started chewing my lip and made eye contact with Bertier as he looked at me over his shoulder. But he quickly tore his gaze away. Why the hell was he always looking at me? Alan's father pounded his fist against the table and shouted, \"I say boycott T.C. Williams!\" \"You tell 'em, Fred!\" one of the other fathers shouted. Alan's father nodded his head, seemingly feeding off the negative energy in the room. \"Our boys aren't gonna play for some Coach Coon! \" he hissed which was met with a rather enthusiastic response from the others in the room. Coach tried to settle things down. Bertier looked back at me once more before he stood up. \"Coach, he stole your job!\" Bertier shouted. I blinked in surprise. While Bertier and I were almost never in agreement, this looked like one of those issues we were in complete agreement. No matter how you played it out, Coach Boone did steal Coach's job. It was fact, not up for debate. Bertier folded his arms across his chest. \"I'm not playing for him. I started a petition and I'm sitting this season out.\" I blinked slowly, trying to process what Bertier just said. Next, to me, Alan nodded his head in agreement. I couldn't help but watch Bertier. Even if I didn't particularly like him, Gerry Bertier was the best player we had. Hell, he was the best player in Virginia and probably even the whole country. The fact that he was willing to give it all up for Coach surprised her. Coach stepped off the stage and walked up to Bertier. He rested his hand on Bertier's shoulder. \"Only place you're going to sit is back in that chair, Gerry,\" Coach said sternly before he softly smiled. \"I appreciate it, though.\" I knew Coach thought of Bertier like the son he never had. I suppose he had similar feelings about all the boys on the football field, but there was always a soft spot for Bertier since he didn't have his father. Coach oftentimes tried to fill that role for him. I remember when we were younger, Bertier was over at our house quite frequently. He and Coach would play catch and most of the time, I would join in. Bertier would usually stay for dinner until his mamma got done with work. Back then, Gerry Bertier was probably my best friend. But once we got to high school, things changed. Bertier came by the house less and less and suddenly, it seemed like I was almost invisible to him unless he was poking fun at me. It was almost like he seemed embarrassed to be associated with me. But he never stopped looking up to Coach. I watched as Coach gently patted Bertier on the shoulder and smiled at him. Alan's father then shot to his feet. \"Boycott T.C.,\" he shouted raising his fist the air. \"Boycott the school!\" Echoes of agreement filled the room. Almost everyone seemed in support of the proposal, but Coach glanced at Mr. Bosely and shook his head. Coach told Bertier to sit once again before he walked over to our table. He stopped in front of Mr. Bosely, his expression was terse. \"Stop this, Fred,\" Coach hissed. \"You know none of these boys can afford to go to some other district just to play ball. They sit this one out and they put their futures on the line.\" Before Mr. Bosely could respond, Ray Budds, who had been sitting next to Bertier, jumped to his feet defensively. \"Coach, I'm out too,\" Ray stated. He folded his arms across his puffed-out chest, wearing a solemn expression as Coach turned to look at him. \"I'm not playing for no thief. It ain't right.\" \"Don't you do this,\" Coach argued taking a few steps toward Ray. \"Don't you make this any harder on me than it already is. This isn't a decision I came to lightly.\" Alan had been sitting beside me fidgeting, tapping his hand against his knee. Suddenly, he was on his feet. 'Coach, if you go, I go,\" Alan said. I could tell he was trying to stand a bit taller to look a little older. Suddenly everyone in the room was on their feet all up in arms shouting in support of Coach. One boy shouted, \"I'll only play for you, Coach Yoast!\" \"Don't go, Coach!\" came from another boy. \"You can't leave us!\" several boys pleaded. I looked at Coach. I could tell he was trying to contain his emotions. His eyes were glistening when chants of Coach Yoast echoed through the room. He tried to wave them off, but soon everyone was on their feet clapping their hands in a standing ovation for Coach. Coach made eye contact with me and I offered him a smile. He sighed. He still wasn't sure how to respond. He was flattered by the boys' loyalty, but he also didn't want to see them put their futures in jeopardy on account of him. Coach nodded his head at several people and sai several thank yous. He looked and me once again and mouthed for me to come along. I grabbed Sheryl's hand and headed for the door. Coach waited for us at the door as the crowd continued to cheer. Coach opened the door for Sheryl and me before he waved once more to those inside. Sheryl and I exited the building and stopped on the sidewalk for Coach to catch up to us. He did, wrapping one arm around Sheryl's shoulders and one around mine. \"How about that dinner?\" Coach said with a smile on his face. He led us to the diner just down the street. Neither Sheryl nor I could find the words to say to him. I was surprised to see tear stains on my sister's cheeks. I hadn't paid her much attention in there, but it was clear she didn't like the situation either. Once inside the restaurant, the waitress seated us at a booth. She told us that our order was on the house. Coach tried to argue with her, but she quickly shot down his attempts. He looked back in the kitchen to see the cook salute toward him. Coach sighed and then we ordered our food. We all ordered burgers and milkshakes. Coach got a chocolate milkshake, Sheryl a strawberry milkshake, and I went with plain ol' vanilla. As Sheryl and I sipped the milkshakes the waitress brought us, Coach drummed his fingers against the table looking very deep in though. Sheryl and I exchanged concerned glances. \"Coach?\" I asked. He sighed. \"That's not the way things went in my head.\" I nodded my head in understanding. I took a sip of my milkshake trying to figure out what to say to him before I responded. \"You're their coach. You've been their coach for years. You're practically a pillar of this community. Of course, they're going to be loyal to you.\" \"Yeah, they're loyal all right. Loyal enough to put their futures on the line because of me.\" Coach shook his head and put it in his hands. Trying to think realistically, I said, \"Well, it's not like all of 'em could play college ball anyway.\" Coach looked at me pointedly. \"That's not the point.\" I opened my mouth to argue my point when the bell on the door jingled. Natural instinct was to look at who was coming through the door. I couldn't fight that urge. So, I looked over my shoulder. I shouldn't have done that. Walking through the door was Bertier with his girlfriend Emma Hoyt. He had an arm wrapped around her waist as he led her into the diner. I quickly turned around and began to sip my milkshake. If anyone hated me more than Bertier it was Emma Hoyt. She went out of her way to make me miserable, which I couldn't really understand. I had never done anything to her. Although maybe that's what she and Bertier had in common: hating me. They were the perfect match in that sense, stuck-up and full of themselves. I tried not to look too flustered as they walked by our table. I hoped they would just ignore us, but of course, leave it to Bertier to stop at our table. \"Coach,\" Bertier greeted. Coach smiled. \"Gerry, I'm glad to see you've managed to cool down some.\" Bertier's arm left Emma's waist and he folded his arms across his chest. I continued to drink my milkshake, trying not to look at them. \"I still haven't changed my mind, Coach,\" Bertier said sternly. \"Gerry, I'm gonna go find a table,\" Emma said. Bertier didn't even look at her, he just nodded his head and said, \"I'll be right behind you.\" Apparently, that wasn't the answer she wanted. I saw her roll her eyes before she put a fake smile on her face and look at me. I tried not to make eye contact with her, but it was like a watching a train wreck, it couldn't be helped. Once she had my attention, she placed a kiss on Bertier's cheek before she walked away with her ponytail swinging as she walked. I rolled my eyes. That was so unnecessary. There was no need to be so possessive of Bertier in front of me. It wasn't like I even liked him a little...because I didn't. I shook my head and sipped my milkshake again before focusing on Coach again. \"Gerry, you need to rethink what you're doing, son,\" Coach said. His concern was evident in his tone. \"I have thought about it, Coach. I've been thinking since I found out that Coach Coon took your job. The thing is I'm your player, not his. Plain and simple.\" \"Gerry, I appreciate that. I do. But you're too good to throw this away.\" \"I won't play for him, Coach.\" \"I'm asking you to give it some more thought, son.\" Bertier looked at Coach and then at Sheryl and me. Although, I was very interested in my milkshake at that moment. Bertier sighed and pointed at Emma. \"I really don't wanna keep my lady waiting, Coach. So, if you'll excuse me.\" Coach simply nodded his head and Bertier walked away. I watched as Bertier sat down beside Emma. Of course, Emma had sat down at a booth where I had a perfect line of sight at them. I got up and motioned for Coach to scoot over. He looked confused but he moved over, this way my back was to the couple that would no doubt be sucking face at some point. Our burgers came and we started eating them. I was mid-bite when Coach asked me, \"Why don't you go on any dates, Julie?\" I momentarily choked on my food before I managed to swallow it down. I looked at him with bewilderment which made Sheryl laugh. \"The boys are too scared to ask her,\" Sheryl giggled which made Coach laugh. \"First of all, boys aren't scared of me. Second, who says that I even want to date,\" I argued with my sister. Sheryl rolled her eyes. \"You do. I'm not stupid.\" I rolled my eyes back at her before I took another bite of my burger. \"Do you want to date?\" Coach asked. I blinked rapidly several times. \"Excuse me?\" I couldn't believe he was asking me about this. We never discussed stuff about boys or dating, which he recognized. \"We never talk about that sort of stuff. You know you are allowed to date, right? I was just joking when I said that you couldn't date until you were forty. Don't get me wrong, I would be much happier if you didn't date until after you were married…\" \"Not here,\" I hissed, covering my face with my hands. I could feel my cheeks aflame as both Coach and Sheryl laughed at my expense. \"Fair enough,\" Coach chuckled before he looked over his shoulder and then back at me. \"Although, I gotta say for a long time there I thought that you and Gerry…\" I didn't want to hear what he had to say, so I slurped the bottom of my milkshake extra loud so that I couldn't hear him. Coach just smiled and said nothing more on the subject. After we finished eating our burgers, Coach thanked the owner for the meal and then we headed home. Once we were home, I was glad to be able to change out of my skirt and blouse and into a t-shirt and jeans. I was definitely not a girly-girl, but that probably had something to do with being raised by a single father with an absent mother. I walked downstairs to the kitchen for some water when I noticed Coach sitting outside the old tree with the tire swing out back. I filled a glass with some water for him and walked out to meet him. Coach accepted the water I offered him and took a drink as I sat down beside him. He leaned back against the tree with his eyes closed. He groaned. \"What's on your mind, Daddy?\" I asked. He rubbed his eyes and sighed. \"You know that everything I do, I do in yours and Sheryl's best interest, right?\" I hugged my arms around my knees. \"Yeah, I get that,\" I responded. \"You two are my world. You're both so important to me and all that I have especially since…\" \"Since Mama left?\" I asked. Coach nodded his head. Resting my head on my knees I turned to look at him and gave him a half-smile. He rustled my hair. He sighed again. \"Sometimes, it seems like I can't do anything right and now I've gone and made a mess of things.\" \"This stuff with the team isn't your fault,\" I offered. \"The schools made the mess. Not you.\" \"Yeah...but I've coached most of these boys since they were Sheryl's age. I've seen them grow up in front of my eyes almost like they were my own kids.\" \"Almost,\" Sheryl stated as she suddenly appeared from behind the tree. I wasn't sure how long she had been back there, but it was obvious that she had been listening to our conversation. Coach patted the ground on the other side of him for Sheryl to sit, so she did. \"I'm the only father some of these boys have…\" Coach began. I knew he was referring to Bertier. He sighed again. \"This is a heck of a time to be abandoning them to look out for themselves, ain't it?\" I chewed my bottom lip. \"So, what are you gonna do?\" \"I have this idea. It's probably a crazy idea, but I wanna think on it for a bit yet.\" I rested my hand on Coach's arm. \"I know you'll do what's best, Daddy.\" Coach smiled and wrapped an arm around my shoulders. He wrapped an arm around Sheryl's shoulders and then placed a kiss on the top of each of our heads. \"I know I don't say it enough, but I love both of you so much.\" I knew he meant his words. But I also knew that Sheryl and I weren't the only kids he was thinking of either. In Alexandria, football was a family affair. And our family's affairs were about to get much more complicated.

Mornings were just about the only time I got to myself. The only time I really got to think about things. I had a lot to think about these days. Especially about my future. I really had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. I had always seen taking care of Daddy and Sheryl as a life sentence, but deep down I knew that wasn't the truth. But it did do the trick to help me avoid thinking about my future. Most girls my age were probably thinking about finding the right guy to eventually settle down, maybe some a job...or college. I really didn't have a clue. A gentle knock came at my door. I knew it was Coach. Maybe if I lay quietly enough, he would think that I was still sleeping and he would go away. I closed my eyes and prayed that would be the case. But soon his gentle knocks became pounds. \"Julie Elizabeth Yoast,\" he called through the door. I sighed. He only used my full name when he meant business...or I was in trouble. Assuming this time it was the latter, I kept my eyes closed and attempted to slow down my breathing to that he might think I was asleep when he inevitably came marching through my bedroom door. A few seconds later, my door creaked open. I heard Coach's footsteps crossing my bedroom toward my bed. I held my breath hoping that he would just go away, but instead, he gently started to shake me. Knowing there would be no easy way to be rid of him, I slowly opened my eyes, pretending that I had just woken up. \"Coach?\" I asked before faking a yawn. \"Julie, you gotta get up,\" Coach said to me. I scrunched my face. \"But it's summer,\" I groaned. \"I got some things I need to do today and need you to keep an eye on Sheryl.\" I groaned again before I looked at him suspiciously. Wasn't today that meeting for the football team? \"Where you goin'?\" But Coach ignored my question. Instead, he said, \"I need you to make Sheryl some breakfast.\" \"She knows how to make cereal.\" Coach looked at me pointedly. \"And you know how to make pancakes.\" I threw my head back against my pillows childishly and groaned. \"Now, get a move on. Don't make me have to tell you again.\" \"Yes, Coach,\" I said forcing myself into a sitting position. He gently smiled at me before he left my room. Dressed in my Hammond football shirt, which was really more of a dress in comparison, and a pair of old sweatpants, I headed downstairs on Coach's orders, not bothering to change from the clothes I had slept in. I threw my unruly hair in a ponytail as I descended the stairs, hearing Coach attempt to wake Sheryl up. I growled under my breath because I knew that Sheryl would be allowed to go back to sleep. That was the trouble with being the older sister, I was always stuck babysitting. Sheryl was nine years old and more than capable of fending for herself for at least a few hours, especially with me still in the house. But after Mama left, Coach didn't want Sheryl alone. He didn't want her thinking everyone had abandoned her. I understood his reasoning, but that didn't mean that I liked it. When I was finally downstairs, I headed straight for the kitchen and opened the icebox. I reached for the milk carton and poured myself a glass for breakfast. I took a sip of my milk when the doorbell rang. I stood there for a moment, waiting to hear Coach's footsteps upstairs. Instead, he shouted for me to get it. I rolled my eyes and took a big swig of my milk before I walked to the door. Upon opening the door, I found Gerry Bertier standing on my porch in a short-sleeve button-up shirt with the top undone and a pair of blue jeans. For being such an ass, he looked decent…I suppose. Not that I was paying him much attention or anything. \"Yes?\" I asked, leaning against the doorframe. He studied my face for a moment. I narrowed my eyes at his scrutinizing. He then motioned to his mouth. \"You...uh...you have a little something…\" his voice trailed off before he started to chuckle. With the back of my hand, I wiped away the milk mustache he had pointed out while he continued to laugh at me. He was such a jerk. How younger Julie ever could have considered him a friend was completely beyond me now. He was always acting superior to me. I hated it and he knew it. \"What the hell are you even doing here?\" I groaned. \"Coach told us to meet him over here,\" Bertier said with a shrug. I stood on my tiptoes to look over his shoulder. I saw some of the former football players from Hammond standing on my front lawn. I rolled my eyes and folded my arms across my chest. \"Of course he did.\" \"Is he here?\" \"Yeah,\" I said before puffing a stray tendril of hair from my face. \"Can you get him?\" He looked rather annoyed. This time I shrugged my shoulders and turned back toward the house. \"Coach!\" I called. \"Bertier's at the door.\" I looked back at Bertier, he shook his head. \"I coulda done that.\" \"But you didn't.\" I looked at him rather smugly. As I leaned against the doorframe, I tried to prop one of my feet up on the doorframe too, but I lost my balance and fell, crashing toward the floor. But Bertier reached out and grabbed hold of me, hooking his arms around mine. \"Still haven't managed to stand on your own two feet yet, huh? You always were falling when we were little. Never knew anyone but you who could fall just standing or sitting there.\" \"I'm not clumsy,\" I growled as I managed to stand upright once more. Bertier just looked at me skeptically before looking over his shoulder. \"I gotta few guys back here that might disagree.\" He stepped aside to reveal what was left of the Hammond football team that would be going out of the T.C. Williams team. My face flushed when I saw Ray and John pointing my direction and chuckling at my expense. Alan waved at me. Feeling self-conscious, I folded my arms tight across my chest defensively before I looked up at Bertier angrily. \"You can go now,\" I retorted. \"Coach will be down in a jiffy.\" He leaned against the doorframe with a stupid grin on his face. \"You sure you can manage without me?\" Bertier laughed at his own words before he turned around and walked back toward the rest of the team. Now he'd gone and done it. He'd pissed me off and looking back on it, I let him. For some reason I always let Gerry Bertier rile me up and push all my buttons. While I admit that I shouldn't have, I let my temper get the best of me. One of my greater faults and sins: my temper. But there was no way in hell I was going down without a fight. I looked around to make sure Coach was nowhere in sight when I grabbed the football that Sheryl had carelessly strewn on the floor. I wrapped my fingers tightly around the ball before I turned around back for the front porch. Some of the boys looked at me and wolf-whistled before they turned their attention back to whatever important conversation they were having. Luckily for me, Bertier stood with his back to me. I smirked as my fingers found their proper positions between the laces I pulled the ball back and released it. While it didn't perfectly spiral as it should, the ball did hit my intended target right in the back of his head. He instantly jolted in surprise and turned around to look at me, a wild expression in his eyes. \"Apparently, I can manage,\" I shouted before I stood on the porch with my hands on my hips and a smirk on my face. Gerry rubbed the back of his head, biting back a retort. I could hear the others questioning him about how I managed to hit him, to which Bertier responded that it was a lucky shot. He shot me a look, which told me that he and I both knew he was lying. No matter how much of an ass he was, I suppose there were still some things that Bertier knew better than to mess with and one of those things was our secrets we pledged long ago to keep. But I couldn't help but wonder if the cover-up was because a girl had bested him in front of a bunch of football boys. I sneered at him as Coach yelled for me to get inside. My face instantly dropped as I ran back inside the house while I could hear Bertier laughing in the background. Clearly, this wasn't over. Coach quickly pressed a gentle kiss against my forehead before he headed out the door to meet his boys. He was dressed in a nice dress shirt and slacks, a little nicer than his usual field attire. I walked over to the window and moved the curtains to get a better look. I watched Coach walk and his boys greeted him as he walked to his truck. Bertier and Ray hopped in the front seat beside him, while some of the other boys hopped in the bed of the truck. I sure hoped they knew what they were doing. The sound of a throat being cleared behind me garnered my attention. I turned to find Sheryl standing behind me with her arms folded across her chest and an annoyed expression on her face. \"Where are my pancakes?\" she asked me. I rolled my eyes. \"Does it look like I've had time to make them?\" I scoffed.. \"No.\" This time it was Sheryl who rolled her eyes at me. We made a great pair. She narrowed her eyes at me and continued, \"Because you were too busy making eyes at Gerry Bertier.\" Needless to say, I was shocked. Wherever had she gotten such an idea? But if I didn't refute her, I wouldn't hear the end of it. \"I was doing no such thing. You take it back.\" Sheryl rested her hands on her hips. \"Yeah, you were. I saw you.\" \"Well, for your information, I hate Gerry Bertier. I loathe him.\" \"Mama used to say there's a thin line between love and hate.\" She was getting bold now. I scowled at her and hissed her name, but she took off running, screaming at the top of her lungs. \"Julie and Gerry sittin' in a tree. K-I-S-S-I-N-G…\" I took off running after her, but she continued to sing that stupid song. \"First comes love, then comes marriage, then comes the baby in the baby carriage.\" After about her third time singing the song, I stopped. I realized that I was supposed to be the more mature of us. So, I did the one thing I knew I could hold over her. I held her breakfast hostage. \"You'd better stop singing that stupid song or you ain't getting any pancakes.\" Sheryl came to a quick halt. \"You wouldn't do that,\" she sneered. \"Wouldn't I?\" I breathed, puffing a tendril of hair from my face. \"Try me.\" She scowled but eventually caved to my will. \"Fine,\" she muttered before she plopped down onto one of the kitchen chairs. I breathed a sigh of relief and stood a little taller, praying the neighbors hadn't heard Sheryl's song. That was the last thing I needed, the entire town thinking that I had a thing for Gerry Bertier...especially when he had a girlfriend. The idea was ridiculous. Preposterous. I hated him. I held my head high and shot Sheryl a look of superiority before I walked into the kitchen to make her pancakes. I made Sheryl chocolate chip pancakes, just like Mama did for me when I was little. There weren't many good things I could say about my Mama, but she did make the best pancakes this side of the Mason-Dixon Line. I knew her secret ingredient. Mama used to tell me it was love she added in, but I eventually figure out that it was a hint of almond extract that made them so special. Sheryl and I practically devoured our pancakes, although breakfast was a rather silent affair. Neither of us said anything, but I knew we both were wondering how the football meeting was going for Coach. When we were done eating, Sheryl washed the dishes without needing to be told. But I think she knew that doing the dishes would help keep her mind off Coach until he got home. I settled down on the sofa with a book while Sheryl went out back and played in the grass. We were both trying to pass the time before Coach got home, both of us nervous about the outcomes. It felt like an eternity before he finally got home. The dishes had dried and had been put away for quite some time before he finally walked through the front door. Sheryl must have heard his truck pull in because she nearly pounced on him the moment he walked through the door. \"How'd it go?\" Sheryl asked. I watched as she held her breath waiting for Coach to respond. I found myself leaning against the doorframe to the front room watching Coach. He looked at both of us and then shrugged his shoulders. \"Well, you're looking at T.C. Williams assistant football coach.\" Coach tousled Sheryl's hair before he walked further into the house. He must not have been in much of a talking mood before he sniffed. \"Is that a pie I smell?\" \"It's actually a summer berry crisp,\" I responded having made it during my spurts of restlessness reading my book waiting for him to get home. He smiled and headed toward the kitchen. Sheryl and I exchanged glances with each other before we followed after him. \"Is that all you're gonna tell us?\" I called. By the time Sheryl and I got to the kitchen, Coach already had dug a spoon out of the drawer and scooped a bite of the crisp. \"There's really not much more to tell,\" Coach said after taking a bite of the crisp. I rolled my eyes. I wished I could have been there. I hated that it was expected of me to stay home and be left out of everything. I must have worn my annoyance on my face because Coach took a look at me and then offered. \"Coach Boone's letting Coach Tyrell come on board for the special teams.\" \"And how does Coach Tyrell feel about that?\" Coach took another bite of the crisp. 'This is mighty darn good crisp, Julie.\" I looked at him pointedly. Coach just chuckled. 'That's what took me so long. I had to convince him to come on board, but everything should be squared away now.\" \"Not everything,\" Sheryl said stubbornly with her arms folded across her chest. \"You should still be head coach.\" \"Yeah,\" Coach sighed. He was silent for a moment before he continued. \"But it is what it is. I'm just thankful that to have the opportunity to work with my boys for another year. And I don't want to hear another word about it, Sheryl. You hear me?\" Sheryl cast her gaze downward and nodded her head. I chewed my lip. I could tell that most of this was a front for Sheryl. But I can't say I would have done things any differently. I wouldn't want to drag a nine-year-old into the politics that was integration either. I barely understood them, so there was no way she would. I was about to walk away when Coach called, \"Julie, don't make any plans for Thursday evening, okay?\" I turned around and said, \"I can't. I'm grounded, remember?\" \"Oh, that's right. I almost forgot,\" Coach chuckled, clearly still amused. \"She don't have any friends anyway,\" Sheryl retorted. I shot her a dirty look before I looked back at Coach. \"Can I ask why?\" \"You can,\" Coach responded as he put his spoon in the sink. \"We're going over to the Bertiers' for dinner Thursday night.\" \"Come again?\" He chuckled. \"Mrs. Bertier caught me as I was dropping Gerry off at home and she invited us to dinner. I said we'd be there...with bells on.\" I folded my arms across my chest. \"Well, I'm not going.\" I knew I was being stubborn, but I didn't want to have to endure an evening of torture at Gerry Bertier's expense. \"Yes, you are,\" Coach said sternly. He was rarely ever this stern with me. But I fought him anyway. \"I can't. I'm busy.\" Coach arched his eyebrow. \"But you're grounded, remember?\" I groaned at the fact that he used my own words against me. I knew it was immature and childish, but I still found myself rolling my eyes and stomping out of the kitchen and upstairs to my bedroom. I wanted to make sure that Coach knew I wasn't happy about the situation. But it didn't do me any good. Thursday night, I would be headed to dinner at the Bertiers.

Here goes nothing. I love watching horror movies; they're a ton of fun. But unfortunately, most of the time my favorite character always ends up dying lol. It happened again when I saw Jeepers Creepers for the first time a month ago or so. And what made it worse was that it totally could've been prevented if not for the Hollywood-cops that were terrible at their jobs. JUST SHOOT IT'S WINGS. For real guys, it would've been so easy to hit the Creeper and NOT hit Darry in that stand-off scene. Esp since you guys were like…5 feet away from them. *rolls eyes* typical horror-movie cops. So anyway, I decided enough was enough and I wrote an \"alternate ending\" if you will. It's nothing spectacular but here ya go. This seemed unnecessary to explain all of this, sorry haha. / / / \"You let him go!\" But Trish's scream is ignored. The creature spreads its wings and Darry's body tenses, his grip still clawing at the grotesque arm wrapped around his neck. The creature lunges backwards, twisting his body around as he and Darry smash through the large window behind them. Trish's scream is lost amongst the shattering glass and flapping of the powerful wings. For a moment she's frozen in shock. Then she turns and bolts from the room, shoving aside flabbergasted police officers and skidding over the window shards. Tears blind her vision as she races down the building's stairs and through the dark hallway. She slams the police station's front doors open and continues to run, her steps echoing on the sidewalk. Her eyes never leave the sky, never waver from the form of the creature flying above her, her brother in its arms. She cannot hear Darry screaming; she wonders if he even is. Maybe he's too much in shock, or maybe he's still trying to be a stupid hero. Like when he had insisted on going back to that tunnel by the church in the first place. If only she had forced him to get back in the car and just drive… The sidewalk runs beneath a looming tunnel of arched trees. Her view of the sky is obscured, and fresh panic at this forces her to move faster. She makes it into the open again, and stumbles to a stop. The creature – and Darry – are gone. The sky is empty, it's darkness decorated only by the distant moon and clouds. She spins around, scanning every inch of the sky; nothing. \"Darry!\" she screams. Tears stream down her cheeks, and a sob escapes her as she again shouts her brother's name. \" DARRY! \" But there is no sign of him, or the creature. She is completely alone. Her breath comes in shaky gasps; she had failed Darry. She had failed to protect her little brother. I hear it playing. While one of you is screaming – screaming down in the dark somewhere. \"Darry…\" \"Miss Jenner!\" Trish jumps at the sudden voice, and jerks around to see five cops running towards her. The one leading the group skids to a stop before her, scanning the surrounding area frantically. \"You shouldn't have run off…are you alright?\" Trish vaguely registers the name stitched onto his jacket – Dep. Weise – before nodding dully at him. \"My brother…\" she whispers brokenly. Then she glares up at him with a sudden rage. \"You!\" she cries out, slamming a small fist into his chest. He stumbles back a step, unharmed, but surprised nonetheless. \"You were supposed to protect him! You said you would protect us –protect Darry!\" She's sobbing now, her fists striking Deputy Weise with every accusation. \"And you all just stood there . Stood there while that thing took off with Darry! You useless bastards!\" Weise grabs Trish's wrists, holding them in the air where she had been swinging them furiously. \"Patricia!\" he says sternly. Trish stops, staring at him; her crying has ceased, but her face shines with the tear streaks left there. \"You need to calm down. We're not going to abandon Darry; we're going after him.\" Trish stares at Weise, tears still brimming her reddened eyes. \"What?\" she chokes. \"We're going after him,\" Weise repeats. \"How?\" Trish asks weakly. \"We don't know where they went. The church…it burnt down.\" \"We'll have some men check the church, just in case,\" Weise says. \"The rest of us will search for Darry elsewhere. Now think . Where else could they have gone? Is there any other place you can think of that the creature would have gone to?\" Trish creases her brow as she rakes her mind for any possible answer. \"I…I don't know,\" she admits. \" I don't know .\" The phrase is obscured by a panicked sob the second time it's said. She stops and her body stiffens as a sudden idea comes to her. \"Jezelle,\" she says. \"What?\" Weise says. \" Jezelle ,\" Trish repeats. \"She had those visions – of us and Darry. Of one of us screaming in the dark. Of…Darry screaming in the dark. She knows where that thing had taken him!\" She pushes past the deputy and runs back towards the police station, not bothering to see if Weise or the other cops follow her. She bursts through the doors of the station and skids to a stop. The lights are back on – the ones that work anyway. A lot of them are smashed, or completely burnt out. But it's bright enough. Contrary to the scene of chaos Trish was expecting, the atmosphere is surprisingly calm in the station. A few policeman walk about, talking to each other in low voices as they examine rooms and check to see what other damage had been inflicted on the station. Sergeant Tubbs stands beside the front desk, speaking into the attached phone gravely. It pisses Trish off. Her brother had just been captured by that demon, and none of the policemen looked concerned by it at all. Maybe there was an air of defeat, of mourning, in the station, but nothing close to a frantic search being started. At the end of the hallway is Jezelle. She looks badly shaken, and her eyes dart about the station wildly, like a frightened animal. She is carefully making her way to the front entrance, but freezes upon seeing Trish heading towards her. \"Jezelle!\" Trish exclaims, hurrying forward. Jezelle looks about her awkwardly, as though searching for an escape. \"Jezelle!\" Trish stops before the woman, panting slightly. Weise comes up behind her, two cops following closely. \"Jezelle please, I need your help.\" \"I've interfered too much already,\" the woman said nervously, rubbing her arms in apprehension. \"I shouldn't have come – I made everything worse. I've got to go.\" \"Jezelle, please ,\" Trish says. She puts her hands on Jezelle's shoulders, forcing the woman to look at her. \"It took Darry.\" A hint of sorrow cuts through the nervousness clouding Jezelle's face. \"I know, honey. And I'm sorry. I did everything I could to help you.\" \"No,\" Trish says sternly. \"No, you have not. You know more than what you were telling us before. What did you see in those visions?\" Jezelle wrings her hands, glancing about her frantically. \"I can't…I can't…\"she mutters. \" Jezelle !\" Trish gives Jezelle a hard shake so the woman's head snaps back to look at Trish. \"This is my brother . I have to find him. I'll ask again: what did you see? There has to be something in those visions that will tell us where Darry is.\" \"It's not right…not right what it does to that boy…\" Jezelle doesn't even seem to be talking to Trish anymore. She's staring right past her, gazing at the double doors at the end of the hallway. Trish shakes the woman again. \"What? What does it do?\" Jezelle gives Trish a strange look. \"Haven't you figured it out yet?\" she whispers. \" Jeepers creepers, where'd you get those peepers? Where'd you get those eyes? \" Trish stares at Jezelle in confusion and Jezelle grits her teeth, clearly not wanting to continue. \"It needs to eat us to keep itself alive,\" she explains, her tone similar to that of a teacher who is tired of having to tell a student something over and over. \"It needs…parts of us.\" It takes a second, and then Trish's eyes widen in horror. \"His eyes?\" she whispers. \"It needs….Darry's eyes?\" Her hands slowly slip away from Jezelle's shoulders and she takes a shaky step backwards. \"You – you saw it. You saw it take Darry's eyes. Darry screaming in the dark… \" Tears spring to her eyes, but the look in them is fierce. \"No. No, it's not going to happen. Where is it, Jezelle? Where did it take Darry?\" \"I don't…I don't know…\" \"Damn it Jezelle, think! \" Trish steps towards Jezelle viciously, but a warning gesture from Weise keeps her from grabbing the woman again. \"Tell me everything you know! Everything you saw in that vision!\" \"I can't see everything in them!\" Jezelle exclaims. \"I can only see pieces of them – I told you that! Fragments…\" she shudders. \"But enough. I saw enough.\" \"Then tell me!\" \"I…I don't…they were in a room.\" Jezelle closes her eyes momentarily, grimacing at the memory of the vision. \"It looked like it might have been underground. It was damp, and dark there. I…I'm not sure what else could be of help…it looked like they were in a boiler room of some kind? An old one, and definitely unused.\" Trish looks at Weise. \"Does that help at all? Can you think of any place?\" Weise frowns, thinking. \"Well…there was an old meat factory that was in use until about ten years ago or so. An accident happened there, I don't know, the details were covered up pretty heavily. It was really old – built in the early fifties, I believe. It had been run by a boiler room. It's quite far from here, but we could probably make it in under half an hour if we hurried.\" \"You sure that's right place?\" Trish asks him. \"I'm not sure of anything, but it's the only lead I can think of,\" Weise says gravely. \"Fine,\" Trish said. \"Let's go.\" She and Weise turn away and begin walking towards the station's doors. \"You won't make it in time.\" They stop, and turn to look back at Jezelle, who is watching them with wide eyes. \"You should not go, Patricia. What you will find…\" Trish sets her jaw. \"I will make it in time,\" she says venomously. \"Darry is not going to die.\" Then she turns away and shoves the station's doors open, stalking off into the night.[Chapter 2] WARNING: Slight torture in this chapter. And nudity, though the nudity is not sexual. If you've seen the movie, you know how the Creeper works when picking out his victims. He's not into Darry in any sexual way – it's just a predator reveling in his prey he caught. / / / Trish's final scream echoes in Darry's ears as the creature smashes through the police station window and soars up into the night. As the ground rapidly pulls away, Darry's first instinct is to clutch to whatever he can to keep himself from falling. But the only thing there is the body of the creature that is currently holding him in a choking, vice-like grip. Darry recoils from the clammy touch, trying to twist away, though he knows full-well what would happen if he were to loosen the creature's grip. While the logical part of his brain is screaming to hang on, the other, more frantic and emotional part, is urging him to do it; whatever the creature has planned for him will be far worse than a quick death from falling, Darry is sure of that. He desperately scratches and pulls at the arms wrapped around his neck and torso; it does nothing to the thick, almost scaly skin. The creature doesn't even try to stop Darry, seemingly undisturbed by the boy's attempts to escape. But as Darry releases his grip on the arms to try and pry them away, the arm wrapped around his throat tightens; either to hold Darry up, or as a warning, Darry doesn't know. But soon he's gasping for air, and black spots spark in his vision. He immediately stops clawing at the arms and returns his grip on them. It would do no good if he were to black out, making it that much easier for the creature to take him to wherever it's planning. With the cold air blasting across his face and the arms encircling him getting steadily tighter as they continue to rise in altitude, each minute they are flying is a torturous eternity to Darry. He has no sense of time as the creature carries him through the night, and has no idea how long they have been traveling before the creature finally starts to descend. The creature's feet thud to the ground, its wings giving a final few flaps as it steadies itself. Darry, too winded and dazed by the flight, stumbles over his feet and would have fallen to the ground if not for the strong grip holding him up. Blinking heavily, Darry looks around them. They are in a small courtyard of some kind. In front of them is an old-looking building. From the state of it, Darry assumes it's been abandoned for some time now. The creature approaches the double doors of the building, dragging Darry across the weed-infested ground. Now that they're no longer flying, Darry's senses finally return to him. He gives a sudden, hard jerk in the creature's grip, attempting to break the circle of arms around him. To Darry's surprise, he does manage to fling the creature to the side a few steps, though he's sure that that's due to surprise rather than strength. He is jerked along with the creature, but Darry can feel a slight loosening on the creature's grip as they stumble. Immediately, Darry throws himself backwards, slamming into the creature's chest. The grip on his neck loosens. Using every bit of strength he has, Darry pulls at the arms and drops to the ground, slipping out from beneath the loop of arms. He…he's free . Shock courses through him at his success, but he doesn't pause to revel in it and instead propels himself forward, away from the creature. He doesn't even get three feet before a sharp blow is delivered to the side of his head. He sprawls to the ground with a pained cry, striking his shoulder on the cold dirt and sliding a foot or so before rolling onto his side. Wheezing, he tilts his head up and watches as the creature stalks towards him, fury etched into its wretched skin. Bending down, the creature wraps an enormous hand around Darry's throat and uses the grip to lift the boy off of the ground. Darry chokes and claws desperately at the hand, but the creature ignores Darry's struggling and begins walking towards the building's doors, dragging the boy beside him. The doors slam open and they descend a nearby set of stairs. A dimly lit hallway waits at the bottom of the stairs and the creature follows it into a rather large room. It's so dim Darry can hardly make anything out, but the creature moves fluently and without caution. The creature suddenly throws Darry unceremoniously to the floor. The back of Darry's head smacks against the cement and stars flash in front of his vision. He groans, pain shooting through his head as he coughs violently. Strong hands seize him and he feels his body lifted into the air and slammed onto a cold, smooth surface. Before Darry can command his body to try and move, he feels a leather strap being secured around his left wrist. Immediately he starts flailing about frantically, trying to tug himself away from both the restraint and from the creature looming over him. The creature strikes Darry across the face and the boy's head snaps sharply to the side. Dazed, Darry's can only gasp for breath as the creature ties his remaining wrist and ankles down. Darry blinks and tries to focus his hazy vision to gather his surroundings. He's panting hard, desperately trying to draw in the muggy air but unable to fully do so in his panic. It looks like they're in a basement of some kind – an engine room maybe. It's hard to see, tied down as tightly as he is. The surface he's tied to is metal; he can feel the edges of it with his feet and his hands, and wonders if he's on some sort of old-fashioned operation table. That idea only worsens his fear. He feels a sudden weight on his right foot and yelps in alarm. His shoe and sock are roughly pulled off, and a second later the ones on his left foot are too. The dull thuds of the shoes being tossed to the ground echo loudly. A moment passes, and then the creature suddenly reappears at the edge of Darry's vision, holding a pair of rusty scissors. Its gaze travels up and down Darry's body, and Darry squirms uncomfortably, eyeing the scissors warily. \"What are you –\" he begins tentatively. The creature does not look at him; it acts as though Darry had not spoken at all. Then it brings the scissors down to the edge of Darry's shirt in a swift motion, making Darry cry out in alarm. Ignoring Darry, the creature cuts upwards rapidly, and tears away what is left of Darry's shirt. \"No, don't –\" Darry stutters, but the creature is already shredding his pants and jerks them away, along with his boxers. Darry gasps as the cold air hits his body and tries to pull in on himself to hide his nudity, but the straps holding him down are tight, and he can do nothing but turn his head away in embarrassment from the creature leering down on him. \"Please…please don't…\" he whispers, squeezing his eyes shut. His hands tighten into fists, straining uselessly against their bonds. He feels the creature shift closer and Darry's eyes shoot open; the creature is leaning over him, his face horribly close to Darry's. Darry cries out in terror and tries to move away, but there is no where to go. The creature…it's eyeing him hungrily. The look in his eyes – it's the look of something that has not eaten in a long time. The image of the \"strippergram\" cop's disembodied head flashes across Darry's mind. Well…eaten something he had truly been wanting . Then the creature starts sniffing. Its takes its time, taking long, deep sniffs of Darry's body, the expression on its face pure ecstasy. Again Darry tries to squirm away, though he knows he's going no where bound like this. It feels like it goes on for hours, though whatever logic is left in Darry's mind is insisting it can't possibly have been that long. He had closed his eyes again, unable to watch the creature inspect his body so closely. So he jumps when he suddenly feels rough hands clamp down on his ankles, tugging at the restraints and loosening them. He eyes fly open and he stares as the creature tugs the leather straps off of his ankles and then moves to his wrists. The straps are not even completely pulled off before the creature grabs both of his wrists in one hand, and keeping them above Darry's head, uses the grip to harshly jerk the boy off of the table. Darry does not have enough time to find his footing as his body rolls off of the table; he doesn't have to though, as the creature holds him almost completely off of the floor by his wrists, dragging him across the room. Darry's toes scrap against the cold cement as he tries to support his weight, but the effort is wasted and he has to settle for the pain of his wrists being forced to hold his entire body up. They stop, and Darry's hands are ripped away from each other. He then feels the shocking coldness of metal encase his left wrist, and then his right. Jerking his head up, he sees that he's being held upright by a pair of old shackles. His feet barely touch the ground, and he has to stand on the tips of his toes to try and hold any of his weight up by himself. The creature circles him once, studying him as one would a fine art piece. It stops in front of Darry, staring into his face; Darry looks away, a horrible mixture of shame and fear pooling in him. The creature's hand whips out and grabs Darry's jaw, its claws digging into the boy's skin. Darry's head is jerked back to the front, but Darry keeps his eyes downcast. The creature gives the boy's head a hard shake and finally Darry relents, lifting his gaze to match the creature's. The creature stares into Darry's eyes intensely, gray-blue to brown. It takes its time, studying Darry's eyes with an obvious air of pride, as though satisfied that it had found the perfect pair. Darry holds the creature's gaze, though he feels unwelcome tears start to well in his eyes. He's furious with himself the moment he feels them forming, but he can't help it; the humiliation, terror, and confusion of the whole situation has become overwhelmingly exhausting to Darry. The creature smiles upon seeing the unshed tears form, and for the first time since Darry was brought down to this room, he feels anger towards the creature. White hot and fast it strikes through him. And so he fights back the only way he can; he spits in the creature's face. The creature jerks back with a hiss of fury. It stares at Darry coldly for a short second before backhanding the boy; the blow is so hard Darry's vision goes black for a few seconds, and a dull ringing echoes in his ears. By the time Darry is able to see again, the creature is already gone from his line of sight. He can hear it though, rustling through things behind Darry. The soft tap of something being set against a hard surface is heard, and then soft music fills the room. \" I don't care what the weather man says, when the weatherman says it's raining… \" Darry feels as though his blood has turned to ice. It's the song. The song Jezelle warned them about – the one that's been haunting him and Trish all night. The creature is still moving things about behind Darry. Darry tries to twist around to see what it's doing, but the simple task of holding himself up is so demanding that it's impossible. The noises stop, and then it's just the heavy footsteps of the creature as it walks over to Darry. \" I don't care how the weather vane points, when the weather vane points to gloomy…it's got to be sunny to me when your eyes look into mine… \" A hand presses against the back of Darry's head, so sudden and without warning that Darry gasps at the contact. Then he feels something else press alongside the hand; it's cold, and sharp – a nail file? A knife? The object presses harder against the back of Darry's head and Darry twists against the shackles, a new wave of tears brimming in his eyes. Hanging naked in an unknown place, at the mercy of a monster, completely helpless…it's too much. He thought he would be able to control himself, keep his composure – be strong, like his sister. But then that metal instrument presses deeper into his hair and breaks through his skin. \"NO!\" he screams. \"No,\" he says again, this time the word more of a whimper than a shout. \"Please…please don't. Please…\" he repeats the word over and over, his frantic mumbling bordering on sobbing. His face reddens in shame; begging? Begging like this? But he can't help it – after being terrorized for hours on end throughout the night, and finally captured like this, it's too much for him to handle. He can't do it. \" Jeepers creepers, where'd ya get those peepers? Jeepers creepers, where'd ya get those eyes? \" The object begins to cut upwards. And Darry screams.[Chapter 3] The police cars could not drive to the meat factory fast enough for Trish. Even with the sirens going and the roads already practically empty, it still takes them a good twenty minutes to get to the abandoned site. The car Trish is in hasn't even pulled to a complete stop before she jumps out, ready to bolt towards the doors. Deputy Weise immediately stops the car and gets out. \"Miss Jenner, wait!\" Trish halts and turns in annoyance. \"What?\" she snaps. \"You cannot simply rush in –\" \"My brother –\" \"Will probably be killed instantly if that thing knows we're here,\" Weise says sternly. \"If you want to save Darry, you must listen to me and obey my orders. You have to do what I say, understand?\" Trish glares at the policeman, her body nearly shaking with the desire to run. But she jerkily nods her head, her jaw tight. \"Good.\" Weise turns to address the officers standing by their parked cars, waiting for instructions. \"Muñez, Thompson, and Brady – you come with Miss Jenner and me. Everyone else – block every entrance. If you see that thing, shoot it.\" The officers nod and all turn to find the entrances, save three men. They walk to Weise and Trish's side, guns ready. Weise looks at them grimly before glancing at Trish. \"Let's go.\" The doors they choose open up to a set of stairs leading downwards. Weise descends without hesitation, Trish following closely behind, with the three other policemen bringing up the rear. A dimly lit hallway awaits them at the bottom, looking damp and desolate in the low light. They start to walk down it, eyes straining to pick up any sign of movement. \"Wait,\" Weise says, holding up a hand. \"Do you hear that?\" They all stop, listening. It's soft at first, but steadily picks up volume as the seconds go on. \"It's music…\" one of the other officers – Muñez – mutters. \" …when the weatherman says it's raining, you'll never hear me complaining. I'm certain the sun will shine… \" Icy horror washes through Trish. \"It's the song…\" she whispers. \"What?\" Weise asks sharply. \"The song…it plays when that thing is near…\" Trish's eyes widen. \"Darry screaming in the dark, while that song plays…\" Then she breaks into a run, pushing past Weise. \"Trish, wait!\" he hisses, hurrying after her. But Trish ignores him. She continues to run, past locked doors and dead-end turns, her ears straining to pin-point where the music is coming from. Then a scream echoes down the hall. Both Trish and Weise skid to a stop, horror on their faces as they glance at each other. \"Darry?\" Trish shouts. The screaming picks up again, and this time it does not stop. \" Darry! \" Trish screams, running once again beside Weise. \"Darry!\" A set of double doors looms from the shadows on her right and she immediately turns, pushing them open and sprinting into the room. Weise and the other policemen follow her in. It's a boiler room. The air is stuffy, and it's so dim that it's hard to make things out clearly. But there's enough to see across the room, where two figures are outlined in the little light there is. Darry hangs from the ceiling, stripped completely naked. Behind him stands the monster they've been hunting for hours now, its hands held up to the back of Darry's head. Upon the five newcomers bursting into the room, the creature jerks away from the boy's head in surprise, pulling with it what looks to be like some sort of scalpel. The freeing of the object cuts off Darry's screams instantly; the boy utters a low moan, and then his head falls forward, his body going limp. \"Darry!\" Trish shouts, starting to bolt across the room. But Weise holds her back as he and his three men aim their weapons at the creature. \"Back away from the boy,\" Weise orders. Having recovered from the moment of surprise at the intrusion, the creature gives them a look that's some horrible mix of both a sneer and a smirk. Trish expects the creature to use Darry as a body shield again, or try to escape, even if it means leaving Darry behind. She does not expect it to suddenly drive the scalpel towards Darry's head. But Weise seems to have. Trish has barely begun to scream before a shot rings out. The creature staggers back, its now wounded arm dropping the scalpel. It snarls viciously, and steps around Darry, the look in its eyes murderous. Weise shoots again, and manages to hit the creature in the side as it leaps away. With a screech of rage it lunges at the officers, its wings expanding despite the cramped confines of the room. Weise and Trish throw themselves to the side, and the creature lands on one of the officers behind them instead. Immediately, the other two policemen and Weise start opening fire. The bullets do little to hurt the creature; already it has ripped apart the skin on the trapped officer's face and chest. The creature leaps off of the still-twitching body of the policeman and lunges at Weise. Weise pulls up his gun and shoots just as the creature crashes into him, knocking both of them to the floor. Instantly the creature jerks back, roaring in both pain and fury from the new puncture hole visible in its wing. Weise squirms from beneath the creature's body, struggling to bring up his gun again at the odd angle his arms are pinned. The creature swing up a clawed arm, but it is shot to the side by Officer Muñez. He and the remaining officer – Brady – continue to open fire on the creature, making it hard for it to maintain its balance over Weise. The creature stumbles off of Weise to the left, colliding into the double doors. It tumbles into the hallway, where five new officers are running towards it from outside. Muñez and Brady run into the hallway to join the other policemen and the double doors swing shut behind them. Shots continue to rain through the air, along with thuds of men being thrown and the screeches of rage from the monster. But the sounds gradually start to lesson as the creature is pushed further down the hallway, away from the boiler room. Weise and Trish wait no longer. They run across the room to Darry's side, both reaching up to tug on the shackles holding the boy to the ceiling. Trish gives up after one yank and turns her head to look at Darry's face, tears spilling down her cheeks. \"Darry,\" she sobs. \"Darry, come on. We saved you. You're gonna be fine. Come on, Darry. We're getting you out of here.\" No response. \"Darry… Darry …\" She presses a hand to the side of Darry's head, tangling her fingers in the thick hair to stroke her brother's scalp. But she immediately recoils, repulsion on her face. She glances at her fingers, which are now covered in blood. Horror in her eyes, she focuses her attention on the back of Darry's head; his hair is drenched in blood. The grotesque liquid continues to flow alarmingly fast, running down his neck in a thick river and snaking out along his back muscles in dark streams. If Weise is shocked at the sight, he does not show it. His expression grim, he presses two fingers against Darry's neck, just below his jaw. A long second passes. And another. \"He's alive,\" Weise finally breathes in relief. Trish's exhales shakily. She gently lays her right hand against Darry's head and strokes his temple with her thumb. \"Darry,\" she chokes, her entire body trembling. \"Darry, please wake up. Please say something.\" Nothing. He – and the entire room – are quiet. She blinks in confusion, suddenly realizing just how silent it is. \"The song…\" she mutters, glancing about her and Darry. \"I shut it off.\" Trish jumps as Weise rushes back to her and Darry's side; she hadn't even noticed he had walked away. Trish gives Weise a grateful look, but he focuses his attention on Darry's imprisoned wrists. He's holding a rusty key, which he swiftly brings up to the right shackle and inserts into the lock. \"Found it on the work table behind us, among all of these other…operating tools,\" he mutters as the shackle opens. He jerks forward to catch Darry as the boy's body slumps over. He holds the key out towards Trish. \"Trish, here.\" She takes the key and hurriedly unlocks the left shackle. Darry falls from the ceiling like dead weight and Weise staggers slightly under the suddenness of it. But he quickly recovers and eases both himself and Darry to the floor. A low moan escapes Darry's lips as he is moved, and he shifts slightly, trying to resist the handling. \"Trish, take Darry.\" Trish kneels on the floor beside Weise and helps adjust Darry so he is leaning against Trish, his face pressed into her shoulder. Weise crouches down in front of the siblings, inspecting the back of Darry's head. \"That bastard was cutting into the back of Darry's head,\" Weise says darkly. He squints, trying to see better. \"He didn't get too far though, I think.\" \"Then why is he bleeding so much?\" \"Head wounds usually bleed a lot more than wounds on other places of the body,\" Weise says. He digs into his jacket pocket and pulls out a handkerchief. He gently presses the cloth against the bleeding wound; upon contact Darry flinches horribly in Trish's arms. He moans and Trish's head snaps down to look at her brother. \"Darry?\" she says weakly. \"Dare, can you hear me?\" \"…Trish?\" the name is so soft and slurred that it's hard to make out. But Trish gives a loud sob at the sound, raising a hand to hover beside Darry's head; she hesitates, unsure where to touch him. \"Darry?\" Darry mumbles something incoherently and blinks heavily. He tries to tilt his head up, but he groans at the attempt and closes his eyes tightly, the pain on his face blatantly obvious. \"Where'd you…\" The words trail off and he grits his teeth, swallowing hard. He looks like he might throw up. Tears trickling down her cheeks, Trish presses her forehead against the top of Darry's head, careful not to go near his wound. \"It's okay now, Darry. You're safe.\" Darry winces at the touch, but does not try to move away. \"I'm so scared Trish…\" he whispers, the words strung together sloppily in his haze. Tears drip from his eyes, streaking through the dirt smudged on his face. \"I know, Darry,\" Trish says. \"I know. But I've got you now. You're okay. You're okay .\" She wraps her arms around her brother as tightly as she dares, burying her face in the crook between Darry's neck and shoulder. \"We have to get him to a hospital,\" Weise says gently. Trish looks up at him; Darry keeps his face buried in Trish's chest. \"We have to go. If my men can't hold that thing off, it could come back…\" Darry stiffens against Trish's body. \"I'll carry him,\" Weise says, taking off his jacket and draping it across Darry's shoulders. Darry flinches at the foreign contact, but Trish pulls the jacket securely around Darry's body. \"He's right, Dare,\" she says softly. \"We need to get you out of here.\" A moment passes, then Darry gives a tiny nod. \"Deputy Weise is going to help you, okay? He's a good man, you'll be alright.\" She starts to unwrap her arms from around her brother, but Darry grabs her wrist tightly. Trish is surprised he has any strength left for such a harsh grip. \"Trish…don't leave me,\" he whispers, terror etched into every syllable. Trish forces herself to hold back tears; she's never heard her usually carefree brother sound like this before. \"I'll be right beside you,\" she says, her words firm, determined. Reluctantly, Darry releases his grip. \"Here, take this,\" Weise pulls his gun from his belt and sets it on the ground beside Trish. Leaning forward, he gently pulls Darry out of Trish's arms. Darry's body tenses as strange hands handle him, but he does not resist. Weise settles Darry in his arms and begins to stand, adjusting the jacket to cover as much of the thin body as possible. Then Darry's eyes suddenly flutter droopily and his head falls against Weise's chest. \"Darry?\" Trish grabs the gun and stands up, eyeing her brother worryingly. \"He just passed out,\" Weise says, looking at Darry's slack face. \"Most likely from shock and exhaustion. It's probably for the best – I can't imagine how painful that wound must be, especially now that we're going to be moving him about.\" The muffled sound of a crash seeps its way beneath the double doors. Weise and Trish glance at each other nervously. \"Let's go,\" he says. They hurry across the room, Weise going a bit faster and rougher than he would have had Darry still been awake, and step into the hallway. The hallway is empty, though distant shouts and gunshots can be heard further down in the opposite direction they had come in. They turn away from the noise and quickly make their way back to the stairs. Though still unconscious, Darry begins to shiver violently. Weise tightens his arms around the boy as they ascend the stairs. By now rays of sunlight have begun to pour over the horizon and across the courtyard, touching Weise and Trish's feet as they hurry to Weise's police car. Trish yanks open the back door and slides in. Weise eases Darry's limp body onto the seat, adjusting him so he is lying on his side, his head cradled in Trish's lap. \"Here,\" Weise says, holding out the bloody handkerchief. \"Press it against the wound. It'll have to do for now.\" Trish nods and takes the offered cloth, gently pressing it over the still bleeding wound; Weise pulls a shock blanket from the car's trunk and drapes it over Darry. It's all they can do for now. Slamming the door shut, Weise gets into the driver's seat and pulls the car away from the meat factory. He picks up the radio microphone and begins speaking into it. \"Deputy Weise to Poho County station. We need an ambulance immediately. We're heading east on the 203, just outside of Poho County…\" / Trish and Darry's parents are expected to arrive at Poho County Hopsital in about half an hour. Having already spoken to doctors, policemen, and her parents via numerous phone calls, Trish does not have any desire to see them or anyone else anytime soon. But then, she does not want to stay in Poho County any longer than necessary also. So she'll endure her parents' frantic questions and overbearing worry if only it means getting Darry away from this place. Trish rubs her face with a sigh, bending forward slightly in her seat. She is sitting on an old metal chair that looks like it was made in the 1970's. Its cushions are thin and badly padded, and a large chunk is missing from the back cushion. Despite the numbness that's starting to set in from sitting in the uncomfortable chair for hours, she does not move to get up. She leans forward, elbows resting on knees and hands cupped over her mouth. Darry lies on the bed before her, his head tilted in her direction to lesson the pressure on the wound on the back of his head. He looks relaxed in sleep, and she's content simply watching his chest steadily rise and fall. The cut the creature had made had been alarmingly deep. It was over three inches in length, and had required thirteen stitches. The scalpel the creature had used had scraped across the surface of Darry's skull, but fortunately had not broken through it. Darry had woken up by the time they had reached the hospital, and the doctors kept him awake while they treated his wound, so they could determine whether he had any other head injuries besides the gash the creature had inflicted on him. Once they had finished, they gave him some anesthesia. He and Trish were left alone, but it was not long before he had fallen into a heavy sleep. Trish reaches out, gently brushing away strands of Darry's dark hair from his face. From where she is sitting, she cannot see the stitching job or the area that the doctors had had to shave Darry's hair off surrounding the wound to do the task. Despite her exhaustion and the vague terror still lingering from the entire ordeal, she can't help but smirk slightly; she wonders what Darry will think about his new – yet temporary – bald patch. The creature had gotten away. Three policemen had been killed in the struggle that ensued after they had burst in on it and Darry. And the body of one of the killed policeman had actually been carried off by the creature at the end of the fight. Guilt flickers in Trish as she remembers the muggy details Deputy Weise had relayed to her. Guilt from knowing that those men had been killed because they had gone after her bother. And even deeper guilt because, even though she's trying to deny the feeling, a part of her almost thinks it was worth it, if it meant Darry could be saved. Three men died . But Darry is alive because of that. One boy versus three men, who probably had families of their own… \"…Trish?\" Trish's head snaps up to face the hospital bed. Darry's eyes are half-open, and he's watching her drowsily. Shoving aside the conflicting thoughts, Trish scoots her chair closer, a small smile sliding onto her face. \"Hey, Darry. How're you feeling?\" \"Fine, I guess.\" He frowns slightly, as though trying to decide for himself whether that was the truth or not. \"You really scared me. I'm so glad you're alright now.\" Darry hesitates, looking almost uncomfortable at that statement. \"Yeah, me too.\" He glances about them. \"What time is it?\" \"A little after seven in the morning.\" Darry brings a hand up to his eyes and rubs them slowly. He sighs and drops his hand, staring at the far wall of the room. Then returns his gaze to Trish. \"Is it dead?\" Trish bites her lip. Darry waits for an answer, watching her with a deep seriousness and a shadow of apprehension. \"…no. No, it got away.\" She does not want to tell him that, but she knows that lying would be worse. Her brother hates being lied to, especially if Trish is the one doing the lying. Besides, she knows he'd find out eventually. And despite all of that, he plain just has a right to know. Darry's face pales, but his grim expression does not change. He nods slightly. Trish notices he doesn't seem to be showing any pain concerning his head wound; she assumes the pain relief medication the doctors gave him is still working strong. \"Yeah. Yeah I figured it wouldn't be.\" Darry's frown deepens as he looks down at his bandaged wrists and left hand. A few seconds pass. Darry's lips are pressed tightly together, and the expression on his face is one of someone about to ask something they really don't want to know the answer to. \"It's going to come back for me, isn't it? You heard what Jezelle said; it never stops once it finds something it wants.\" \"Jezelle doesn't know jack shit about anything,\" Trish snaps viciously. Thrown off by her sudden change in mood, Darry blinks at her in surprise. But Trish doesn't relax. Though her expression is fierce, fresh fear from Darry's words has sprung up inside her. Subconsciously, she had been thinking that very thought all night since Darry had been rescued. That the creature wasn't done with them. That it would be back, it would continue to hunt them – hunt Darry. But hearing it said out loud, and by Darry of all people, it's as if it had sealed their fate for good. That it really would come back. Trish grinds her teeth. That's not going to happen. \"Mom and Dad are going to be here soon, and then we're getting far away from this shithole of a place,\" she says. \"That thing likes to stick around here; it won't follow us.\" \"But –\" \"And if it does try to follow us, we'll be ready for it. We have the police on our side; they've seen it, so we have validation now. Other police stations should be looking out for it. Dad has weapons too, but our house is so far away from here that it's never going to find us. It's not going to get you, Darry. I promise .\" Darry watches Trish with an expression both weary and disbelieving. But Trish returns his gaze with eyes so vehement in their determination that he does not bother to try and argue. He bites his lip and nods, his eyes flickering away from his sister's. Silence fills the gap between them. \"Thanks for coming after me, Trish,\" he finally whispers. Trish shifts uncomfortably in her chair, her fear and anger melting away at hearing the broken voice giving gratitude. She hesitates, and then gets up and sits on the hospital bed, pressing the side of her body against Darry's. Darry looks at her strangely, but as she settles down he finds himself leaning into her warmth. Trish lays her head on Darry's shoulder; after a moment, Darry rests his head atop hers. \"Well, I wasn't about to face the entirety of spring break alone with mom and dad,\" Trish says. \"What'd you expect me to do?\" Darry smiles at that. Trish slips her arm through Darry's and links their hands together. \"Holding hands, Trish?\" Darry teases quietly. \"It's been, what, a good ten years since you've voluntarily done that? You know, so your baby brother couldn't ruin your image?\" Trish nudges Darry's shoulder. \"Shut up, brat. It's only till mom and dad get here, so enjoy it while you can.\" \"I'll try.\" Trish smiles softly. And together they wait. / / / Right now, this is the end of this story. Later on, if I feel like it (or have the motivation), I might continue it. We'll see. :P ","Summary":" I've been debating for well over a week now whether to bother uploading this or not. Here goes noth"},{"Movie":"Lilo & Stitch","Title":"Island of Adventures","Author":"PerkyGoth14","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10821333","Passage":"[Chapter 1] A/N: More RP's with AnnaleaseTurner. This was first started September 30th and since we're on a brief hiatus for it, I decided maybe to upload it. We only own our OC's, read & review! It was a typical normal day for Hawaii. Sunny, warm and full of visitors. One of such visitors was a young girl with lightly tanned skin and red hair. Her eyes were so dark brown they looked black. She was wearing a blue dress and was making her way towards the Hula school. She had just moved to the island and was already being forced into one of the traditions by her cousin. In her hand was a black rabbit doll with red eyes. There was a little Hawaiian girl underwater who had a peanut butter sandwich for someone. It wasn't a normal person, this was, what she called, a weather-controlling fish named Pudge. After she fed it, she started to swim up and the waves gently danced against her wavy, thick black hair and she was looking all around for someone. The red-head sighed and looked around for the cousin who was her age. \"Where are you, Lilo?\" She mutters, knowing her older cousin Nani would throw a fit if Lilo was lost. \"Has anyone seen Lilo?\" a blonde girl in pigtails asked her friends. The other girls shrugged as they waited. They had to practice their performance for the next week before they go on a big school trip together. Lilo came onto the sand and grabbed her bag, getting dressed for hula class. The girl had changed into her hula outfit and was waiting for them to be called on. She slapped a hand to her forehead as she remembered what Lilo did this time of month. ' She's feeding Pudge... ' she thinks. \"I'm coming, Kahila!\" Lilo called as she quickly got into her skirt and tube top. Before she did, she was distracted by a large sunburned man with sunglasses and an ice cream. Lilo blinked at him, reached into her bag, took out her camera, flashed a picture and ran off to continue to get to school on time. The red-haired, girl, Kahlia sighed gently but smiled. She was amused by her cousin. Lilo came to her side. \"Come on, let's go.\" she told her older cousin and rushed to make it to class for practice. They ended up arriving a little late. Kahlia waited for the perfect opportunity to slip in to join the dancers. Lilo waited for a signal as the teacher called the four girls to come dance with the older girls and there was another little girl, but she was sitting and watching with the teacher. Kahlia slipped in with Lilo, as the others were already dancing. She took on a look of peace and concentration at the same time. Lilo hid as the teacher had already counted the girls for the day and was now wondering where Lilo ran off to. The girl then decided to dance with the other girls to the song as she memorized the dance and practiced and practiced day in and day out ever since they were first taught it. As the music stopped, the girls stopped and sang a Hawaiian proverb together. Kahlia forced a smile on her face as they all spoke it. She then looked around as the other girls except her and Lilo fell. Lilo looked around and grew nervous. \"Stop, stop!\" the teacher came close to the stage and noticed something. \"Lilo, why are you all wet?\" \"It's sandwich day!\" Lilo excused herself. Kahlia nodded. \"Yes, Lilo has to honor sandwich day...\" she says, not actually being mean. She wasn't ever mean to Lilo. The teacher and girls blinked at them. Lilo took a deep breath to explain, her mother always told her to explain things people don't understand front hand. \"Every Tuesday, I bring Pudge the Fish a peanut butter sandwich...\" \"Pudge is a fish...?\" the teacher glanced at her. \"Yes, Pudge is a really cute little fish...\" Kahlia pitches in. \"But today we were all out of peanut butter, so I asked my sister to go to the store, but she told me to take a TUNA sandwich,\" Lilo continued to explain. \"I can't feed Pudge tuna! Do you know what tuna is...?\" she whispered with slight disgust. \"Fish?\" the teacher asked. \"IT'S FISH!\" Lilo yelled. \"If I gave Pudge tuna, I'd be an abomination! I'm late, cuz I had to go to the store, cuz of my sister, and cuz all we have is... is... STINKIN' TUNA!\" \"Lilo, why is this so important?\" the teacher asked softly. Kahlia said it at the same time as Lilo. \"Pudge controls the weather.\" though Kahlia herself added 'apparently'. The teacher, older girls, and music players were a little weirded out by that response. Myrtle looked at the two. \"You're both crazy...\" she says. Kahlia blinked slowly as Myrtle called them that. She then was the first to lunge at the ginger haired girl. Lilo then did the same and started to beat up Myrtle with Kahila and bit against Myrtle's arm which made the other girls, Yuki, Teresa, and Elena recoil in fright. The teacher tried to settle them and remove Myrtle from Lilo and Kahila. Myrtle ran from under them and hid with her friends. Kahlia looked angry and had tears in her eyes though at the moment they weren't visible. \"Lilo...\" the teacher was about to scold her. \"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, we won't do it again!\" Lilo said, anxious about getting in trouble. \"We just want to dance...\" Kahlia mutters. Myrtle was checking her injuries. \"Ew, one of them bit me...\" she says. The teacher looked soft at the girls, then glanced at the ones behind him. \"Ewwww!\" the three girls with Myrtle cringed in disgust. Kahlia looked at the teacher then. Myrtle shot a small glare to her blonde haired friend for pushing her arm. \"I wanna dance... I practiced... I just wanna dance...\" Lilo said softly. Kahlia wondered what the man would say. Myrtle looked closer. \"They broke the skin...\" she says. It was just a couple of layers so wasn't bleeding though. The teacher sighed and took Myrtle's hand. \"Come on, let's get you a bandage.\" he took her to the back to get fixed up. \"You could've killed her!\" the puffy haired girl huffed. \"She called us crazy, we are not crazy!\" Kahlia says. She then decided she would have to leave practice today and changed into her normal clothes and waited outside. \"If you get banned from hula, it serves you both right!\" the shorter haired girl said. \"Yeah!\" the blonde girl agreed. Lilo huffed and glared at them. She got changed into her red dress and waited outside with Kahila for Lilo's sister to pick them up. Kahlia was hugging her bunny toy as they sat out on the porch. Myrtle came running out with the other girls when class ended. \"Does this look infected to you?\" She asks her friends. They all clutched dolls. \"Yeah!\" the puffy haired girl sounded very disgusted. Lilo watched them and looked at them leave. \"They said I could play dolls with them when I got my own... Technically, I do.\" she told her cousin. \"Let's go and see then...\" Kahlia says. Myrtle didn't notice the two come up to them. Lilo and Kahlia came behind the girls which made them all stare at the two. \"What do you two want?\" Myrtle asks harshly. Kahlia silently glared at Myrtle. \"You better not have rabies,\" the short-haired girl said to the girls, not exactly giving them eye contact. \"If you have rabies, the dog catcher will have to cut off your-\" \"Are you going to play dolls?\" Lilo asked, really wanting to join in. The other girls did the same. Kahlia merely hugged her stuffed rabbit. It's red eyes seeming to stare blankly at the girls. Lilo dug into her bag and took out a sickly green doll with a flock of blonde hair with a big fat bow. \"This is Scrump,\" she explained. \"I made her.\" The girls recoiled in horror while another girl blinked, but looked intrigued. Myrtle gasped actually pushing her friends behind her. Kahlia looked at the other girl and tilted her head. The girl looked at her, smiling and waved her fingers. \"Get over here!\" the puffy haired girl grabbed the new girl as Lilo was explaining the creation of Scrump and a fictional biography about how she only had a few more days to live. Kahlia had started to wave back but stopped when one of the group pulled her away. Myrtle got everyone to run away from the two 'freaks' as she called them. Lilo saw the other girls were gone and threw her doll on the ground. \"Come on, we're going home.\" she muttered to the girl and went to storm off on her own and not wait for her sister. Kahlia looked at poor Scrump. She picked her up and followed Lilo. She looked a little sad. Lilo looked back at Kahila, took Scrump and pulled the doll into a tight hug and they continued to walk home together. Kahlia decided to help Lilo. She then ended up lying in a fetal position on the sofa. Lilo put on a very depressing Elvis record and lay on the floor while Kahila was on the couch after they got to the house. The door was unlocked, but Lilo's sister wasn't around. \"We should nail the door shut...\" she mutters. \"Yeah...\" Lilo muttered back, then went to get the hammer from the kitchen drawer. \"You know where the nails are?\" Kahlia got up and found the box of nails. Lilo and Kahila nailed the door shut together and went to continue to sulk. Kahlia returned to her position on the sofa.[Chapter 2] Nani made her way to the hula school to pick up the girls. \"Lilo, Kahlia?\" She asks, looking around. No one answered, there was no one on the school's front porch. Nani looked inside through the glass on the door. \"Girls?\" She asks, groaning as she got no reply. Even the teacher was gone. Nani sighed and headed back towards their house. \"You girls better be home...\" she threatens. A blue car was starting to back out and almost hit the older girl, Nani. Nani backed away a second then scowled at the car. She kicked the front of the car. \"Watch where you're going... Stupid head!\" She scolds before running to her house. Inside there was a bald man in black suit with dooming sunglasses. He briefly scowled at the girl as she was running home. Nani ran home and tried to open the door. \"Lilo, Kahlia, open the door, girls...\" she says both relieved and annoyed. \"Go away...\" Kahlia drawls. Lilo just continued to sulk and stare at the ceiling. Nani manged to get her head and one arm through. \"We don't have time for this, girls, the social worker is going to be here any minute.\" she informs. Lilo blinked and glanced at her sister. \"Leave us alone to die...\" she droned. Nani sighed and managed to get the lock undone, only to see the door was nailed shut too. She growled and started to threaten them about turning them into pies for the social worker. Kahlia merely turned over ignoring Nani. Lilo started to lip sync a bit to the Elvis song in the background. Kahlia was acting like this as she was depressed. She always was after anything mentioning 'Craziness' in a bullying or joking way. Lilo turned the music up a little, still depressed. The social worker came and was revealed to be the man Nani insulted earlier. He saw her at her door, struggling to get in through the dog door and kicked her foot a little to get her attention. Nani looked shocked as he pulled her out. \"Love, and kindness.\" she finishes as she stood up. She hid the hammer quickly. The social worker glanced at her as she held a hammer. Nani dropped the hammer to the side. \"You must be the...\" she starts, before trailing off. \"The stupid head...\" he answered for her. \"Oh. Ohhh...\" Nani says, sheepishly. \"I'm sorry, if I knew who you were, I'd never, uh, I can pay for that...\" she flounders, ending in a defeated tone. \"It's a rental...\" the man said sharply. \"Are you the guardian in question?\" \"Yes, I'm Nani... and you are...\" Nani trails off to get to know the man's name. \"The stupid head.\" the man growled. Nani looked sheepish again. \"Once again, I'm sorry... but I meant your name... Anyway, shall we sit out here and talk?\" She asks. \"Bubbles...\" the man forced out his name, feeling slightly embarrassed by it. He then noticed the offer and glanced at her. \"No, thank you...\" Nani bit her lip. \"This way...\" she says softly and jumped over her porch rails and headed towards the back door. Bubbles followed her and saw a bit of a mess in the back door. \"You think she gave up?\" Lilo whispered to Kahila as Nani seemed to have stopped trying to break into her own house. Kahlia shrugged. \"Doubt it...\" she sighs. Nani held a hand up to him. \"One moment...\" she says and ran to get through the window. She got in through the window and then headed to open the door, turning off the music on her way. \"Hey!\" Lilo and Kahila complained. Bubbles was curious of what was going on inside the house. Nani came to the door and opened it. \"Lemonade?\" She asks, sounding breathless. Bubbles came into the kitchen. \"Do you often leave your sister home alone?\" he questioned, looking around. There was a crayon drawing of Lilo and Kahila drawn alone on the fridge. Nani hid the drawing. \"Well, not usually, except for just now...\" she says. Kahlia looked at Lilo. Lilo looked back. \"He doesn't look like a social worker.\" she whispered to her cousin. Kahlia nodded, looking up at the man. She thought he looked cool. Bubbles hummed at her, then heard high steaming from the oven. \"You left the stove on when you went out?\" Lilo blinked. \"Just a simmer...\" Nani says, smiling. \"Mm... coming along great... Wah!\" She cries out. Kahlia looked at them \"We found that this morning.\" she says. Lilo came as well. Bubbles looked down to the two girls. \"Lilo, Kahlia... there you are, cupcakes...\" Nani says with a smile. \"This is Mr. Bubbles.\" she says. Kahlia looked at him still. \"Nice to meet you...\" Bubbles held out his giant hand which looked as big as Lilo's entire body mass. The young girl tilted her head. \"Your knuckles say 'Cobra'... Cobra Bubbles...\" Bubbles got on one knee to observe the little girls. He wasn't as rough with them as he was with Nani. \"You don't look like a social worker...\" Kahlia says. She shook his hand though. \"I also work special in the government.\" Bubbles told them. Lilo was taken aback by that. \"Did you ever kill anyone?\" Bubbles noticeably smirked at that question. \"We're getting off subject... Tell me about you, are you two happy?\" Kahlia gave a smile and then looked calm. \"We're adjusted...\" she starts. Nani was guiding them behind him. Lilo watched these and tried to follow Nani's gestures. \"We eat big breakfasts, take long naps, look both ways before crossing the street...and get disciplined?\" she saw that Nani was shaking a fist, though it was in victory and not in abuse. \"Disciplined?\" Bubbles questioned. Kahlia nodded \"Yeah, sometimes five times a day.\" she says. Nani was now trying to stop them and looked shocked. \"With bricks!\" Lilo added. \"Bricks?\" Bubbles glanced at them. Kahlia looked down slightly. \"Uh-huh, in a pillowcase\" she says. \"Okay, that's enough sugar for you two,\" Nani says. She patted their heads. \"Why don't you run along, you little cuties...\" she says and pushed them towards the living room. Lilo went in the living room with Kahila. Bubbles stared coldly at Nani. Kahlia passed Lilo the jar of pickle juice. \"Thirsty?\" Nani asks nervously and looked into the fridge. Lilo was looking through a book as she collected spoons and made grass skirts and faces on five spoons. She then threw them into the jar and shook them up. Bubbles was warning Nani about how the visit was going and glanced at the two girls using 'practical voo doo'. \"Our friends need to be punished...\" Kahlia says sounding weird. Lilo nodded in agreement as she stared at the jar. Nani merely looked down, groaning. Bubbles handed his card for either one of them. \"Call me next time you're left here alone.\" Kahlia took it. \"Yup.\" she agrees. Nani looked at Cobra. \"In case you're wondering, this did not go well,\" Bubbles told the older girl and unbolted the door from the wall, making the nails drop instantly. \"You have three days to change my mind.\" he nearly slammed the door. Lilo got up with Kahila and looked at Nani. As soon as Cobra left Nani turned to face them angrily. Kahlia gulped and looked at Nani. She screamed as Nani started to chase them. Lilo screamed and ran with Kahila. Nani started to chase them. \"Lilo! Kahlia!\" she shouts and lunged at them. Kahlia dodged the catch. Lilo was caught, but she slobbered on her sister's gripping arm. \"Ew... girls!\" Nani groans and shouts following them into the hall. She then listened to where they would hide. Kahlia had pulled Lilo to the dryer to hide. Lilo shushed her and hid close. They were small enough to fit inside the dryer. Nani walked up and climbed onto the dryer, after laying down a towel. She opened the door and slammed it shut with her foot. Kahlia opened the dryer door and then climbed out, helping Lilo out too. Lilo jumped out and landed on the towel, curious. Nani snuck down and scooped both up in the towel, carrying them like a sack. Kahlia growled and complained like an animal. Lilo growled too and even started to hiss like a vampire exposed to the sunlight. Nani grabbed both their arms. \"Why weren't you at the school, you were supposed to wait there!\" She scolds. Kahlia didn't looked at her, her eyes filling with tears. \"Do you want to be taken away?\" Nani asks them then. Lilo grunted and she was nearly crying at the thought of being taken away. \"Don't you understand?\" Nani asks them. \"No!\" Kahlia exclaims. \"No!\" Lilo yelled too, wanting to go away right now. \"No, what?\" Nani asks. \"No!\" Kahlia repeats. \"NOOOO!\" Lilo moaned and slammed her head against the floor, mumbling and nearly crying. Kahlia copied. Nani listened and sighed. She let them go and clenched her head. \"You are such pains...\" she sighs. \"Well, why don't you sell us for rabbit instead!?\" Lilo sneered, climbing up the stairs to her bedroom. \"At least a rabbit would behave better than you\" Nani retorts. Kahlia followed Lilo. \"You'll like it 'cuz it's smarter than us too!\" \"And quieter!\" Nani yells back. \"We don't like it, cuz it's stinky like YOU!\" Lilo glared at Nani and as Kahila was inside her room, she slammed the door with a 'Keep Out' note attached to the front of it. \"Go to your room!\" Nani shouts. Kahlia hugged her toy rabbit. \" WE'RE ALREADY IN MY ROOM! \" Lilo yelled, then slammed the door again. Nani grabbed a pillow from the sofa and screamed into it. Kahlia cried silently. Lilo did the same of what Nani was doing and fell back against her bed. A little while later Nani came up with two plates of Pizza. \"Hey, I brought up some pizza, in case you are hungry...\" she says softly. Kahlia was brushing Lilo's hair. Lilo looked at Nani and kept playing with Scrump a little. \"We're a broken family, aren't we?\" Nani placed the pizza down and sat on the bed behind the girls. \"Maybe a little, maybe a lot...\" she sighs softly. Kahlia looked down. Lilo still stared at Scrump. \"We beat up Myrtle Edmonds today...\" \"What?\" Nani asks. \"And we hit her.\" Kahlia admits softly. \"I bit her.\" Lilo put in. \"You hit and bit her?\" Nani asks. \"Oh, girls, you know you shouldn't do that.\" she tells them. Kahlia hugged her rabbit tight. Lilo got a grasp of Scrump. \"It's just that people treat us differently...\" \"They just don't understand.\" Nani soothes. \"I like you better as a sister than a mom...\" Lilo nearly murmured. \"And I, a cousin.\" Kahlia sighs. \"How about I promise not to shout at you except on special occasions?\" Nani asks. \"And you'd like two rabbits better than a cousin and a little sister, right?\" Lilo almost sounded like she was about to cry then. Nani decided to joke. \"Yeah... I called the rabbit store... they said they'd give me 30 rabbits for you both.\" she says. \"What?\" Kahlia asks shocked. \"We're worth 30 rabbits...?\" Lilo whispered, then saw the joking expression on her older sister's face. \"You didn't call the rabbit store!\" she giggled a little, feeling a bit better than earlier today. Nani smiled at them both. \"Oh, don't forget your camera.\" Kahlia says smiling. \"Oh, yeah!\" Lilo piped up and handed the camera to Nani and looked at her photograph collection in admiration. \"My camera's full again... Aren't they beautiful?\" As Kahila and Nani looked at the candid pictures of tourists, the lights went out suddenly and there came a green light. Kahlia looked at it. \"A shooting star!\" She calls out. Nani stood up to look. Lilo looked to see something falling from the sky and it landed, bringing the power back on. \"I CALLED IT!\" she waved her hand up and started to push Nani out of the room. \"Get out, get out, I have to make my wish!\" Kahlia looked at Nani and Lilo. Nani smirked and suddenly put weight on Lilo. \"Oh, no! Gravity is increasing on me.\" she gasps. \"No it's not!\" Lilo yelled as she continued to try to push out Nani. Kahlia was amused. \"It is too, the same thing happened yesterday...\" Nani retorts before falling down on top of Lilo. \"Get OFF, sister, your butt is crushing me!\" Lilo slithered off from under Nani and got back to the door. \"Why do you have to act so weird!?\" she slammed the door to privately make a wish to the shooting star. Nani rubbed her head and sat up and listened through the door. Kahlia would wish for the same as Lilo. Lilo was quiet and on her knees beside her bed as she was making a silent prayer and wished for an angel. Someone, anyone, that could be her new friend and not run away. Nani overheard this and decided that maybe it would be a good idea for Lilo and Kahila to have a pet since she couldn't force the school girls to be nice to them. Nani nodded she would get them a dog. \"Thank you and amen.\" Lilo finished her wish and opened the door to see if Nani was still there. Nani had gone to not be caught. Kahlia climbed into bed. Lilo made her bed ready to climb in and cuddled with Scrump. \"I hope I can make a friend, Kahila...\" \"Either way you have me.\" she says quietly. \"That's true... School's hard when no one in class likes you, but I'm glad you're here.\" Lilo said softly. Kahlia nodded softly. \"Sweet dreams Li-Li...\" she whispers. Lilo nodded and yawned. \"Good night.\" Kahlia closed her eyes. She tried to block out the memories of why she came there. Lilo hugged Scrump and her pillow tight and was starting to slowly fall asleep.[Chapter 3] The next morning Nani woke the girls up. \"Get up and dressed.\" she says cheerfully. Kahlia groaned but sat up. Lilo grunted and rubbed her eyes. \"It's so early...\" she muttered. \"There's no hula school today, Nani!\" \"But we're going to get a dog.\" Nani says. Kahlia beamed then and got ready. \"A dog?\" Lilo said quietly as she got ready. \"I want a lobster...\" Kahlia chuckled. Nani had gone downstairs to get them breakfast. Lilo stroked her long hair down instead of getting it brushed and slipped on her sandals to meet Nani downstairs. She had slept very peacefully last night because of the rain, but when it stormed a little bit, it made her think of her parents. Kahlia had to brush her hair or it would look as bad as Myrtle's. \"I never had a real pet before...\" Lilo sounded a little excited about going to be able to adopt a pet. \"You think our friends will like us if we get a pet?\" \"They might do.\" Kahlia says as she came down. Nani smiled and handed both their breakfast fruit. \"Mahalo.\" Lilo thanked her sister and ate a tiny bit of fruit. \"Thank you, Nani.\" Kahlia says. She started to eat too. Nani smiled at them. Lilo munched on an orange slice, but leaked some juice on the table. She didn't notice. Kahlia nudged Lilo lightly. Nani was making her own breakfast. Lilo noticed her mess and took out a giant paper towel and wiped it down so it wouldn't stress or worry Nani. Kahlia smiled. \"So are you girls excited?\" Nani asks. \"Yeah!\" Lilo cheered. \"I always wanted an 'aminal' of my own to keep as a pet, like Pudge! Can we adopt Pudge?\" she asked shyly. \"No Lilo, Pudge is a wild fish...\" Nani says gently. Kahlia finished and wiped her mouth. \"Aww...\" Lilo moaned. She was still excited about having a pet, even if she couldn't keep Pudge. She took care of him when no one else would. Nani looked at them after eating breakfast herself. \"Are you both ready?\" She asks. Kahlia nodded \"Yes, Nani.\" she says. Lilo finished and pushed away her plates for now. \"Nani, what if the new pet runs away...? It might think we're weird...\" Nani looked at her. \"Don't worry baby, it won't.\" she says. \"I want one that's unique like me...\" Lilo beamed. \"I'm sure we can find someone like that.\" Nani says. She slipped on her tan boots. Kahlia slipped her own sandals on. Lilo slid on her blue sandals and followed the girls out to visit the animal shelter. Nani held both their hands. \"This will be great.\" she smiles. In the animal shelter, there was a special on adopting puppies today. Two dollars to take a puppy home and have their owner with a paper to make it official. It would really make a child feel grown-up as they would adopt a little fluffy animal to take care of and love forever and ever. Nani was talking to the woman. \"We want something that won't die... something sturdy...\" she says. Kahlia grinned at Lilo. \"Like a lobster!\" Lilo beamed, much to the woman's surprise. Nani looked down at her. \"Lilo, you Lolo... do we have a lobster door? No, we have a dog door, we're getting a dog.\" she says. The woman smiled. Kahlia looked suspiciously at the woman, she looked like Myrtle. Lilo glanced at her sister. Everyone shifted as they could've sworn that the front door opened and closed, but no one else had come in. \"Oh, well, the kennel is this way...\" the woman says lifting a part of the counter. Nani looked surprised then pushed Lilo and Kahlia a little. \"Go, pick someone out.\" she says with a loving smile. Kahlia looked around. Lilo looked over and followed Kahila. They saw empty cages and such, it seemed like no one was there. \"Hello?\" Lilo called as she walked to see any pets she could possibly adopt. \"Hello! Are there any 'aminals' in here?\" There were all the dogs shivering over their cages, they seemed to be startled over something or someone they were staying with overnight. Kahlia looked around. Suddenly a blue dog-thing came up and sat wagging his stump of a tail. Lilo felt a presence behind her that wasn't Kahila. She turned around shyly and waved to the blue dog. \"Hi...\" she waved and smiled at the creature. Kahlia turned to look too. \"H-Hi...\" the dog-thing says. He then went up to them and hugged them. \"Wow!\" Lilo couldn't believe what the dog just did. \"Kahila, did you see that?\" Kahlia looked surprised. \"Yeah...\" she gasps. The dog-thing waited for what he needed to do after letting them go. \"I think we're gonna like you, boy,\" Lilo smiled and petted the blue-dog on his head. \"I think he's a Chihuahua...\" she observed his ears. \"Could be part Collie.\" Kahlia says. Nani was talking to the woman. \"Oh yes, all our dogs are adoptable.\" the woman says. Lilo took the dog out with Kahila to have him looked at and get adopted by them. Kahlia smiled. \"Except that one!\" The woman shouts grabbing the dog-thing. Nani picked both girls up. \"What is that thing?!\" She yells. Lilo struggled to get free as the blue dog creature glanced all around the room. Kahlia hung there. \"C'mere, boy.\" she says. The dog-thing pulled the woman forwards. He tried to get the girls. While Nani was talking with the woman and how it was 'dead this morning', the girls were really drawn to the dog-thing. \"We like him!\" Lilo smiled up at her sister. Kahlia nodded. The dog looked eager to get to them. \"Does it have to be this dog?\" Nani asks them. Lilo watched the dog-thing. Despite it licking inside its nostril to pick its nose and eat it, the girl was very fond of it. \"Yeah, he's good, we can tell.\" \"You'll have to give him a name...\" the woman told the girls as she was filling out the adoption paper with their names on it to make it official in the state of Hawaii. Kahlia looked at Lilo. 'Stitch?' She mouths. Nani was leaning against the counter again. \"His name is...Stitch!\" Lilo put in as the blue-dog was looking out the window, appearing to be looking out for something. The woman scoffed at the young girl. \"That's not a real name...\" she didn't mean to sound nasty about that, but it was just too unusual for her, name for a dog or not. Kahlia looked at her. Nani shook her head going \"Mm-mm mm-mm.\" nervously. The woman looked at Nani and tried cover up what she said to spare the girls' feelings. \"In... Iceland... But here, it's a good name!\" she smiled apologetically. \"Stitch it is.\" Lilo beamed about letting her pet be called Stitch. Kahlia grinned. Nani smiled. The blue-dog was looking out all around, curious. Probably trying to get used to his new surroundings. The woman had the paperwork done and held her hand out for two dollars to be paid for adopting the puppy. \"I wanna buy him!\" Lilo called, then dropped her voice low to a whisper to her sister. \"Can I borrow two dollars?\" Nani looked bored, handed the money to Lilo and waited a second. Stitch went outside then. Kahlia watched. Lilo took the money, then nudged her sister with the money to give to the woman to pay for the dog. The woman took the money after Nani gave the money back and handed the paper to Lilo. \"He's all yours.\" Lilo beamed and hugged the paper close as she was now going to have her very own pet. Stitch saw something and started to bark. \"Coming!\" Kahlia calls and ran out to hug him. \"We're coming!\" Lilo followed her out and joined in the little group hug. There was some distant yelling heard, but the girls saw no one out besides them. Kahlia looked confused at the sound of a laser. Stitch chuckled. There were some rustling in the bushes in the distance. \"Do you see someone?\" Lilo asked Kahila, wondering what Stitch was barking at. Kahlia shrugged. Stitch stood on his front paws and wiggled his butt in the air. There was more yelling in the distance which then made Stitch start barking. \"What is it, Stitch?\" Lilo asked her new pet. \"Bad dog, barking at nothing!\" the woman sneered and squirted Stitch with some water to make him behave for his new family. Kahlia looked. Stitch started to rub his face on the ground making noises of complaint. \"He's probably just anxious to get home.\" the woman told Nani who seemed very worried about their new pet. Nani nodded \"We'll have to go around town first, but thank you.\" she says. Kahlia looked shocked, she had seen two strange creatures who ended up in the bushes. \"You okay, Kahila?\" Lilo asked as she helped Stitch in the car to join them into town. Hopefully their friends would be out and they could meet the little puppy. Kahlia nodded. \"Yeah...\" she says softly and followed. Lilo buckled up with her and made sure Stitch would be safe and comfortable as they would drive into town. Lilo and Kahila were going to teach Stitch how to be a real dog and all about Hawaii when the time would be right. Of course, Stitch was a puppy, so it might take some time before they get him to do amazing things like jumping through a hoop or dancing on his hind legs like the girls once saw in a circus. Kahlia hummed an Elvis tune. Nani handed the girls some money. \"I'll meet you at 1:00...\" She says kissing Lilo and Kahlia's cheeks. Lilo giggled, then pointed to their dog. \"What about him?\" she asked about the dog getting a kiss like that too as he was watching a B-movie. Nani merely looked disgusted and walked away. As the cousins were going to be on their own, four of five familiar hula girls were on their mini bikes together about to meet another one of theirs. They were looking for any cars coming. Kahlia went up with Lilo and Stitch. Stitch stood behind Lilo, but in sight. \"Our friends!\" Lilo chirped, running to the girls. Myrtle, Yuki, and Teresa tried to get away, but the other girl blinked as she looked at them. She didn't seem to want to avoid Lilo and Kahila like the others. Kahlia gave a small smile. \"We have a new dog!\" She says. Stitch looked at them. \"His name is Stitch!\" Lilo added to what Kahila said. Myrtle looked disgusted. \"That is the ugliest thing I ever saw.\" she sneers. \"Yeah!\" Yuki and Teresa agreed with Myrtle. \"He's a little weird looking, but I think he's kinda cute.\" the other girl smiled at the blue dog. Kahlia smiled at the girl, before frowning at Myrtle. Stitch started to sniff at the bike. \"Eww, get it away from me! I could catch a disease!\" Myrtle cries out. There was an unusual couple watching Stitch as they heard Myrtle screaming. Lilo blinked at Stitch and Myrtle. Kahlia gave a small wave to the girl then looked at the strange couple. Stitch grabbed the wheel and tipped Myrtle off. Myrtle started to cry. Lilo was pulled along and she laughed to enjoy the free ride. \"Myrtle, are you okay?\" the unknown girl asked as Yuki and Teresa merely stared as Lilo and Kahila's dog got away with Myrtle's bike. Kahlia was too focused on the couple then, frowning. Myrtle sobbed. \"They stole my bike!\" She cries. \"Oh, great, he's loose and that girl recognizes us.\" the strange woman told her companion quietly. \"His destructive programming is taking affect,\" the strange man told her quietly, trying not to acknowledge Kahila. \"He will be irresistably drawn to large cities, where he will back up sewers, reverse street signs and steal everybody's left shoe...\" he then looked at Kahila, she was hard to ignore. \"Be going away now, red-headed little girl... Nothing to see here! Just with my wife, being!\" Kahlia just looked at him. \"I've seen you somewhere before.\" she says quietly. \"What should we do?\" Pleakley whispers. \"Just blend in,\" Jumba told him quietly, then spoke loudly to draw Kahila away. \"Oh, do not be worrying about us, little girl, we do not need any help! Go selling your scout cookies elsewhere, we do not need help crossing street, or child assistant things like that!\" \"Yes, please, go ahead and play.\" Pleakley says in a high pitched voice. \"You were by the pet store...\" Kahlia mutters glaring, but started to walk away. \"Uhh... You must be mistaking us for other ugly wife and evil genius husband, running along now!\" Jumba tried to cover up as she was walking away. \"Evil genius? I'm five not stupid, I know what I saw.\" she says quietly and a little darkly. \"We can't be discovered by anyone else...\" Pleakley whispers. \"Oh, very interesting, why don't you go home and comb your dolly's hair?\" Jumba tried to get rid of her. \"He's a stuffed rabbit and his name is Simon!\" Kahlia retorts. Though worried Pleakley was slightly amused by the argument between Jumba and the little girl. \"How illogical, to have a toy, stuffed lagomorphic mammal...\" Jumba used his scientific dialect. \"Is Simon an illegal creation that could destroy everything it touches?\" he laughed quite loudly. Hopefully Kahila wouldn't know what he was talking about with an illegal creation from another planet not known by Earth astronomers. Kahlia looked at him then. She didn't really like him, but his voice was actually cool. \"We should be getting going now, right, wife ?\" Jumba asked his colleague, putting emphasis on 'wife' to keep in their guise. Pleakley nodded. \"Yes, dear... Now, run along, little girl.\" he says in his high pitched woman voice. Kahlia grumbled. \"Stupid scientist evil guy...\" she mutters. Jumba chuckled as he went away with Pleakley. \"Earth people are being easy to fool, no?\" he was unaware that Kahila seemed to slowly figure out that he was an evil genius visiting Earth. \"Yes, very primitive.\" Pleakley agrees. \"We better be keeping closer eye on little girls with Experiment 626 around them.\" Jumba said in a hushed tone to the one-eyed alien. He wanted to destroy the humans, but they were all told that humans were on the diet for the local mosquito and were endangered species. Pleakley nodded. \"Especially that little girl, we must do our best not to let her know what and who we truly are.\" he says. \"Indeed, no doubting we will be in bigger trouble than unleashing 626 into the world!\" Jumba sounded extremely cautious. Pleakley gulped, but nodded. Kahlia was making her way to find out where to meet Lilo again. Lilo and Stitch came back on the bike they hijacked from Myrtle. \"Stitch and I were just looking around the island,\" Lilo smiled at her cousin. \"Isn't it nice to live on an island where there are no large cities?\" Kahlia shrugged smiling. \"Mostly.\" she says. Stitch looked utterly annoyed. Lilo looked down at the blue-dog. \"Are you okay...?\" \"I think he wants a city...\" Kahlia states. Stitch nodded miserably but shrugged. \"Well, we'll have to visit the city sometime.\" Lilo shrugged, but held Stitch close to comfort him like a good pet owner. The quiet girl from hula class was with Myrtle and the others and she noticed the 'weird girls'. \"I want my bike back...\" Myrtle whines. Stitch grumbled, but didn't break from the hug. Kahlia looked around and noticed the girl. The quiet girl looked at Myrtle, then went to the girls and the dog. \"Excuse me, but could Myrtle have her bike back?\" she asked in the nicest, gentlest way she possibly could. Lilo petted Stitch and looked at the girl. \"Hey, you're that quiet girl...\" \"Okay...\" Kahlia says with a small smile. Stitch growled at the girl, acting predatorial. The quiet girl jumped back nervously. \"Stitch, no!\" Lilo commanded. Kahlia flicked Stitch's nose. Stitch stopped growling and flopped down. \"What did you do that for?\" Lilo blinked at her cousin. \"Stops them being bad...\" Kahlia says as if it was simple. Stitch gave a half-hearted growl. \"Oh, okay...\" Lilo said softly, then smiled back at Stitch. Kahlia smiled slightly. Stitch kicked the bike towards the girls, making sure Lilo was off it ok first. The quiet girl took the bike and rolled it to Myrtle. \"Good, boy!\" Lilo beamed at her pet. Kahlia waved to the girl. Myrtle took her bike without a smile. Stitch groaned. The quiet girl looked back at Lilo and Kahila with a friendly smile. \"Aleka, let's go!\" one of the other girls called for her. The girl blinked and then slowly started to follow after Myrtle, Yuki, and Teresa to get to Elena's house for an exclusive play date. Kahlia looked at Lilo. \"We should go and meet Nani again soon.\" she says. Stitch looked annoyed. \"Stitch is probably hungry too.\" Lilo saw how tedious Stitch felt. Kahlia nodded and went with Lilo. Stitch followed too. He wasn't going to let his shields get away from him.[Chapter 4] Everyone decided it would be a good idea to picnic in the beach. While Nani was getting food ready, Lilo was teaching Stitch how to play fetch. She waved a stick to him and threw it in the distance, expecting him to go after it. Kahlia stood by to watch Lilo. Stitch merely stood there, looking around. Lilo saw Stitch wasn't going anywhere, so she squirted him a few times to get him to do what she wanted him to do. Kahlia watched. Stitch growled and grabbed the water bottle and threw it away glaring at the girls. Lilo gaped at him, then growled and walked off to get the squirt bottle back, much to Stitch's delight. Stitch grinned. Kahlia looked at Stitch and tutted. She looked around as well. Lilo got the bottle back and dusted some of the sand off from it. Stitch looked at Lilo. Kahlia didn't see anyone else suspicious yet. A white ball came over by Stitch. \"Over here, little buddy!\" a man in his shorts came, wanting the ball and smiled. Stitch picked up the ball and hit the man on the head. Kahlia rushed to help the man up. The man glanced at Stitch. Lilo looked down at him, feeling a little sheepish that had to happen. She then saw Nani preparing their lunch. Kahlia helped the man up. Nani smiled at the girls. Stitch followed Lilo. Lilo reached for her sandwich and handed Kahila one before Nani would get hers. Kahlia took the sandwich with a smile. \"Thank you...\" She says quietly. Stitch reached to get one. Nani shook her head \"Ah-ah.\" she half scolds. She didn't notice that he was going to punch her then. \"Ahem!\" a voice called. It was revealed to be Jumba with Pleakley and he had a laser ready to capture him with if he was going to be bad, unless he was holding that 'little Earth girl' as a shield. Lilo munched a little on her sandwich, smiling her welcomes to Kahila. Kahlia looked at them and frowned. Stitch growled rubbing his face and hugged Lilo. Nani merely ate her sandwich. Lilo smiled at the hug and was proud of her dog for being so loyal. Kahlia glared at the two and ate her sandwich slowly. Stitch didn't let it go. Pleakley looked nervous. Lilo petted Stitch as they had lunch together. \"I was this close...\" Jumba muttered as the blue creature kept a firm hold on Lilo. Kahlia was still staring at them. Stitch put up with the petting so Jumba couldn't get him. \"She's staring at us...\" Pleakley whispers. \"Do not be looking at her.\" Jumba averted Kahila's gaze. Kahlia smirked as he looked away. \"She's doing that smirking thing Gantu does...\" Pleakly whispers looking away. \"Do not be worrying, she is a small child and might not tell anyone, if she is doing so, they are likely not to be believing you.\" Jumba told his colleague. Kahlia looked at them still. She may have disliked them, but she was also intrigued. Pleakly nodded a little. Lilo finished her sandwich and wiped her mouth, smacking her lips. \"That was the best sandwich ever!\" Kahlia nodded \"Yeah, it was nice, Nani.\" she says. Nani smiled. \"What's for dessert?\" Lilo put her hand in to get anything else, hoping Nani brought a sweet treat for them. \"It's fruit, as I know, you'll be having a big meal tonight.\" Nani smiles. Kahlia looked at the fruit with a shrug. \"Really? We can go to a Luau tonight?\" Lilo sounded very excited. Kahlia looked. Pleakley looked confused. Nani nodded. \"Yes, I'm working tonight after all.\" she says. \"Awesome!\" Lilo beamed. \"We're going to a Luau tonight! Oh, you'll love it, Stitch!\" she then dropped her voice low to a whisper to her cousin. \"Nani's boyfriend will be there...\" \"Boyfriend?\" Kahlia asks, tilting her head. Stitch looked bored. Lilo giggled. \"Nani likes David, David likes Nani!\" Kahlia giggled sweetly. She looked totally different than when she was glaring and smirking at Jumba and Pleakly. Stitch looked at her. Nani blushed. Lilo...\" she half-whines/half-scolds in embarrassment. Lilo giggled a bit as she pet Stitch. Kahlia smiled. Stitch sighed, but put up with it. Nani blushed. \"You still have your money?\" She makes sure. \"Check.\" Lilo showed the dollars and cents she was given. Kahlia nodded. Stitch looked at the money. Nani smiled. \"Okay, I'll see you later, okay?\" She asks. \"Okay, aloha, Nani.\" Lilo waved to her after their lunch was done and she decided to take Stitch out for more sights. \"Aloha, Lilo, Kahlia.\" Nani smiles. Kahlia waved. Lilo waved, then looked down at her pet. \"Come on, we still wanna show you around!\" Nani left to do what she had to. Kahlia followed with Lilo. Stitch followed both to keep them in his sights and as he was curious. Lilo decided maybe Stitch needed a cool down. \"Kahila, have you ever had shave ice before?\" she asked before going to the man who ran the local dessert stop as Hawaii was often hot and needed to cool down. Kahlia shook her head. \"Nope.\" she says quietly. Stitch looked curious. As Lilo got the shave ice, he was looking at a few postcards. Lilo went to buy three cones of shave ice with enough money. There was a street dog coming down the sidewalk, looking curious of Stitch. Kahlia took one with a smile. \"Thank you, Lilo.\" she smiles. Stitch took his and tried some. Lilo focused on licking hers. The dog came closer behind Stitch and started to sniff his stump to introduce himself to the 'new dog on the block'. Kahlia licked her own too. Stitch glared at the dog and stuck the cone on the dogs head and then told him off. Lilo looked with horror as this happened and took Stitch away before they could get in trouble. The dog went away with daze. Kahlia followed. Stitch threw the postcards at the dog. Lilo took Stitch and Kahila closer away as they passed a spaceship ride that was only a quarter. Stitch looked excited and jumped into the rocket. He tried to get it to take off. Kahlia watched, raising an eyebrow. \"You wanna ride too?\" Lilo asked Kahila before inserting the coin to start the ride, seeing Stitch wanted to try it out. Kahlia smiled. \"No, you and Stitch enjoy it...\" she says. Stitch looked at Lilo, confused. \"Okay,\" Lilo put in the coin and climbed in to join Stitch. The rocket wasn't going off to the galaxy despite being called 'Space Adventure', it only rocked back and forth, being a ride stuck to the ground. \"If you are ready to give up, just let us know!\" Jumba called to Stitch and laughed. Stitch groaned and hung there annoyed and dismayed. Kahlia turned to look. She binned her cone and headed towards them. Pleakley looked worried slightly. Jumba was looking around casually, noticing a lot of tourists on this land did, and tried to follow their example. Lilo was having too much fun to notice where Kahila was going. Pleakley nudged Jumba a little too late. \"Why are you following us?\" Kahlia asks in an eerie voice. \"We are not to be following you, little girl, we are just tourists...\" Jumba tried to cover up. Kahlia looked at them. \"I don't believe you... You have been to almost every place we have... I will get you arrested for following two five-year-olds and their new dog.\" she says. Pleakley looked at her nervously. \"I don't know what you are talking about.\" Jumba said, trying to cover up his guise, but was getting just as nervous as Pleakley. Kahlia looked him dead in the eyes. \"Don't mess with me, I may be young, but as I'm speaking the truth, I WILL be believed...\" she says. Pleakley gulped slightly. \"Look, we're not after you or your friend...\" he says quietly. \"Yes, this does not concern either of you, it is for a certain creature I have full custody of.\" Jumba added to the explanation. \"Our dog is not yours... We have adopted him\" she says. Pleakley sighed nervously. \"Dog?\" Jumba sounded as though he had never heard that animal species before. Almost as though he were an alien of sorts. Kahlia looked at him strangely. Even other countries knew what a dog was. Her eyes widened and her mouth dropped open. Pleakley blinked his eye as he watched her. \"Do you know?\" Jumba whispered to the one-eyed being. \"Some species of animal on this planet...\" he whispers. \"You're aliens...\" Kahlia squeaks. Jumba laughed a bit to Kahila. \"Do not being silly, red-haired little girl! There are no such things as these... Aliens...\" Kahlia glared at him. She was sick of being treated as dumb. Pleakley looked at Jumba, what would they do if she stuck to the actually true story she knew. Jumba wasn't sure what to do now. Pleakley sighed. \"Okay, but you can't tell anyone who we are...\" he tells her quietly. Kahlia looked at him, almost suspiciously. \"Are you promising?\" Jumba questioned before they got serious and down to business. Kahlia nodded. \"I'm not saying I'll tell, but what'll happen if it comes out while I sleep?\" She asks. Pleakley looked more relieved that she wouldn't tell on purpose. Jumba sighed. \"Very well... This pet of yours,\" he pointed to Stitch as he was dizzy from the spaceship adventure ride and Lilo was helping him out. \"He is not a member of this planet's species... He is no, how you say, dog. He is an illegal genetic mutation created by I and I alone.\" Kahlia looked at them. \"Oh...\" she says. Pleakley watched her. \"You can't let anyone know.\" he reminds her. \"Can we be trusting you, wiser beyond years little girl?\" Jumba asked to make absolute sure they could trust a mere Earth child. Kahlia nodded. \"Yes, you can.\" she says. \"Good, now not to be telling other little girl.\" Jumba warned. Lilo stretched her legs after the ride and started to look for Kahila. Kahlia saw Lilo looking and went off to her. \"I promise.\" she told the two aliens before she left. \"Maybe we spare her with Experiment 626's wrath.\" Jumba suggested. Pleakley looked at him. \"How do we do that?\" He asks quietly. \"He can eat the other little girl.\" Jumba laughed a little darkly. Pleakley looked at him. \"No, no humans are to be eaten.\" he says. Jumba rolled his four eyes. \"Fine... But the sooner the little girls are away from 626, the sooner we can be taking him away.\" Pleakley nodded. \"Hey, Kahila, you missed our spaceship adventure!\" Lilo beamed, making it sound like it was a real spaceship going into outer space and not just a coin operated game to entertain children. Stitch groaned. Kahlia smiled. \"Aww, Stitch got dizzy.\" she coos. \"Aww, poor Stitch... You had too much fun, huh?\" Lilo patted the alien's head, not knowing he was actually an alien and not a dog. Kahlia watched him. Stitch groaned and looked at Kahlia. \"Don't worry, Stitch, we'll have lots of fun tonight before we go to your new home.\" Lilo smiled at their pet to cheer him up from the ride that wasn't much for the 'puppy'. \"Luau...\" Kahlia grins. Stitch looked confused. \"You'll see when we get there, it's a lot of fun, plus we get free food cuz Nani works there.\" Lilo added, seeing Stitch's curiosity of what that might be. Kahlia nodded and led to where Nani was going to meet them. She gave a little smile to the 'couple' as she passed. Stitch followed by Lilo's side. Lilo smiled at the couple too, waved, and walked to where Nani worked at night. \"You'll both get to meet David.\" she told her cousin and pet. Kahlia nodded curious about David. Stitch looked around warily as they walked. \"We have to find out where they're going.\" Jumba whispered to Pleakley. \"Yes.\" Pleakley agreed. \"Do you know of these 'Loo Owes'?\" Jumba tried to pronounce. Pleakley shook his head. \"Maybe we could ask.\" he suggests. \"Hopefully no one will notice we are not being Earth peoples.\" Jumba said, then looked around to see an old woman by her fruit stand. Pleakley nodded. \"We have time for one last stop if you guys want.\" Lilo offered before they would see Nani and she had a dollar and a couple of coins left. Kahlia looked at her and shrugged. Stitch merely looked. \"Well, we can get going then, I don't think we can pay for anything else until dinner tonight.\" Lilo continued to walk and decided to see Nani then since they were done for a little bit of Stitch's tour of his new home. Kahlia followed. Stitch growled a little. Lilo went to the spot, showing Stitch and Kahila how to get there and she looked around for Nani as there were other girls there who were about the same age as the older sister. Kahlia also looked around. Nani came out, looking around. \"There's Nani!\" Lilo nearly squeaked and went to the older girl she grew up with. Kahlia followed. Stitch stuck closer to Kahlia at the moment. Nani smiled. \"Hi, girls.\" she says. \"I had fun, Kahila had fun, I think even Stitch had fun, right Stitch?\" Lilo asked her precious pet. Stitch rolled his eyes. Kahlia smiled. \"You promised we could have free dessert too when you give us dinner.\" Lilo told her older sister as she helped Stitch into a table to let him sit like a person even if it was against the rules. Nani sighed. \"Okay, take your seats, I'll grab you your food.\" she says, not seeing Stitch on the chair. Stitch looked around. Kahlia looked around too. \"It'll get dark pretty fast.\" Lilo told the two as they got settled before the show would start. David was coming just then to get ready for a show tonight to entertain people with dinner and a show. It was a great tradition. Kahlia smiled. Stitch scratched his chest a little. \"There's usually a fire dance when David's around.\" Lilo explained to them, looking around for the older boy who she felt was like a big brother to her most of her life. Kahlia looked confused. Lilo reached into her bag and took out a book to draw in with some crayons from the kids menu. Kahlia shrugged and settled down. Nani came by with the girls' food. Night was coming fast as more people came and David was getting ready for his show. Lilo cringed a bit at the sweet potatoes, but started to eat the other stuff. Kahlia just ate all her food. Stitch looked bored.[Chapter 5] Night fell and David started doing his act. He danced and juggled sticks on fire to entertain the people. Lilo watched a little, but was drawing something up as she finished her food and Stitch was actually watching the show as it started. Stitch was entranced by the fire. Kahlia watched also entranced. Nani was busy. David finished his dance which got him applause from the crowd. He smiled, very thrilled, even after his fire breath move. He then panicked as the stage caught on fire and some of the roof broke off and he tried to put it out. Stitch laughed and clapped. Kahlia looked at him. Lilo looked too and pushed her book to the alien to show it open to a drawing that resembled him, but red. \"This is you, this is your badness level... It's high for someone your size, we'll have to fix that.\" Stitch looked at it. Nani came along. \"Lilo what about your sweet potato? I thought you liked them.\" she says as she collected their plates. \"Stitch is troubled, he needs desserts.\" Lilo said as she saw her older sister. \"You didn't eat your sweet potato...\" Nani says frowning. Stitch looked confused a little. \"Desserts!\" Lilo pointed with her crayon, not letting her not eating sweet potatoes get in the way. Nani sighed and rolled her eyes. Kahlia nudged Lilo as David came up to them. \"David!\" Lilo beamed as the boy came up to their sides. She didn't even seem to notice or care that he was sooty. \"I got a new dog!\" David took a look and was taken aback by Stitch. \"You're sure he's a dog?\" \"Yeah, he used to be a Collie before he got run over.\" Lilo explained. Nani looked at David. \"Did you catch fire again?\" She asks. \"Just the stage...\" David said in defense, then tried to organize something in his mind and get it off his chest. \"Listen, Nani, if you're not doing anything... Maybe you and I could-\" One of the kids at a different table was starting to throw poy. Nani sighed \"Not now, David... The boy at table three is throwing poy again... And you smell like a lawnmower... Some other time okay?\" She asks rushing off. Stitch waited for Nani to leave and shoved all three peices of cake into his mouth before spitting them back. \"Okay...\" David sighed in defeat. \"Don't worry, she likes your hair and thinks its fancy and your butt,\" Lilo told David as Nani was leaving to settle the angry boy. \"I know, I read it in her diary.\" \"She thinks it's fancy?\" David smiled sheepishly. Stitch started to sniff a little, smelling something that was actually edible. Kahlia giggled then watched Stitch. Lilo beamed as she was about to eat her slice of cake, but Stitch ate it and spit it back up, disgusting her. She then decided to go back to drawing until Nani's shift would be over and they could all finally go to the 'dog's' new home. The smell was an interesting, delicious smell. It was coming from another table. Stitch got off the chair and saw the thing. He followed it and reached into the bag to get it. \"Mm.\" he hums. Kahlia watched and recognized the couple and raised an eyebrow. The smell was being drawn to a purse that had the certain food inside that was attracting Stitch. Stitch gave a few noises of hunger and rummaged to get the food. Pleakley looked around calmly at first. Jumba captured Stitch as Pleakley had the shackles to officially take him away from this island. Stitch struggled and punched the handcuffs away. He then bit Pleakly's head. \"Ahhh!\" Pleakley cries out. Kahlia came to help remove Stitch. Nani heard the commotion and rushed to help. Jumba tried to get Stitch off Pleakley's head and squish it in the his aggressive jaw. Stitch growled, holding on. Pleakley's arms were flailing a little in pain. Nani threw the pitcher of drink over Stitch. As none of this worked, Kahlia went over and flicked Stitch's nose. She watched as he let go and fell to the floor, groaning. Lilo blinked, a little nervous at the scene. Jumba stood by as Pleakley was coughing on the drink splashed on him after Stitch nearly squeezed his head in his jaw. The manager was coming by a little firmly. \"Nani, is that your dog?\" Stitch held his nose. Nani looked at him. \"Ma'am are you alright?\" She asks Pleakly. \"Yes, yes, I'm fine, please go about your business!\" Pleakley calls out in a womanly voice. The manager looked to see how odd and out of it Pleakley seemed due to Stitch chewing on him. \"Her heads looks swollen...\" Lilo muttered quietly. \"Actually, she's just ugly.\" Jumba stated as he looked at his 'wife'. \"U-Ugly... look at me! He's joking.\" Pleakley laughs, nervously. Stitch glared. Kahlia offered a handkerchief, a clean one, to Pleakley. Nani looked nervous a little. The manager looked at Nani firmly and folded his arms at her. Jumba glanced at them, still rolling his eyes at Pleakley. This one-eyed alien was really annoying. Pleakley took it to wipe his face a little. \"Thank you, little girl.\" he says. Nani looked at the manager and frowned. \"Fine, who needs this stupid fake-y luau anyway?... Come on, girls\" she says, walking off. Stitch followed with Lilo. Kahlia followed after her family. The manager was a little surprised Nani didn't have an emotional breakdown and handled it like a real adult. He let them go for the night. Lilo was eager to finally have Stitch see their home after a long, exhausting day out in town. \"Did you lose your job because of Stitch, Kahila and me?\" she asked her sister softly as they were getting to their house. Nani looked at them. \"No... The manager was a vampire and he wanted me to join his legion of the undead.\" she says. Kahlia looked surprised. \"I knew it...\" Lilo whispered, not knowing that was supposed to be a joke. \"This is a great home, you'll like it a lot.\" she told her pet, then opened the front door to let Stitch inside and give him a personal tour. Stitch looked around and looked at the sofa. Kahlia picked up the pillow. \"Look... comfy...\" she says happily. Nani watched carefully. \"Hey!\" Lilo noticed that Stitch was trying to scratch at the pillow like it was a victim. Stitch scratched at the pillow and pushed Kahlia down. \"Oi...\" Kahlia complains. Nani frowned. \"Don't touch them...\" she scolds. \"Be careful of the little angel!\" Lilo warned Nani as she tried to stop Stitch from the couch pillows. \"He's just cranky because it's his bedtime.\" \"He's not an angel... I don't think he's even a dog.\" Nani says. Stitch rolled into a ball and rolled into the kitchen. Kahlia got up and straightened out her dress. Lilo was arguing a bit with her sister as Stitch was playing with the blender, but made a mess all over the kitchen floor. Kahlia tried to stop Stitch. Stitch growled and tried to attack the blender. Nani picked stitch up and tried to drag him away. Lilo was still outraged with Nani's behavior. \"He was an orphan and we adopted him!\" she stomped her foot. \"What about ohana!?\" \"He hasn't been here that long!\" Nani says. Kahlia tilted her head. Stitch looked confused too. \"Neither have I!\" Lilo was still angry, then remembered something from her early childhood. \"Dad said 'ohana means family'.\" she knew that would break Nani down, but she didn't mean to be touchy about their father. She saw how confused the new members of their family looked, so she decided to use the family motto on them since that's what they were. \"Ohana means family, family means nobody gets left behind...\" Nani stopped, sighing. Stitch looked between them. \"Oh...\" Kahlia says. Lilo prompted Nani to say the 'or forgotten' bit. Once she did, the two sisters stuck their tongues out at each other and Stitch fell from Nani's arms. \"Don't worry, you can sleep right next to me.\" Lilo told her pet as she, Stitch, and Kahila went upstairs to her bedroom to get settled in for the night. Kahlia came up with Lilo. Stitch had opened the door with his face and sniffled around. \"Look how curious the puppy is,\" Lilo observed like a nature show host, then went to show the bed she made for her new pet when Nani said they would be getting a dog. Even if that dog wasn't a dog. \"This is my room and this is your bed,\" Lilo then took out Scrump and a baby bottle filled with a brown substance. \"This is your dolly and bottle, see, doesn't spill.\" she handed the bottle to Stitch. \"I filled it with coffee.\" Stitch took the bottle and climbed up onto the girls' bed. \"Hey, that's mine!\" Lilo whined, then climbed in after him, looking protective against her pillow. \"Down!\" Stitch squashed Lilo with the pillow. Kahlia tried to stop him. There was a photograph of four people together under the pillow. Lilo snatched it before either of them could see it. \"Be careful of that! You don't touch this! Don't ever touch it!\" as Stitch was now off her bed, she put the picture back in place and put her pillow over top of it. Stitch got off and started to cause more destruction. Kahlia flinched at Lilo's tone. \"Sorry, Kahila, it's just-\" Lilo looked to her cousin, then saw Stitch trying to eat Scrump. \"NO!\" she rushed to take the doll into safety. \"Don't pull on her head, she's recovering from surgery.\" Stitch rolled off to rip the poster. Kahlia sat on the bed, looking down. \"No, that's from my blue period!\" Lilo cringed, then saw it being ripped. She then found a flower necklace and put it around Stitch to hopefully calm him. The flower lei made Stitch flop down, purring. Kahlia didn't speak. \"Kahila, take note of this,\" Lilo said as she looked down at the blue thing. \"Stitch, you know, you wreck everything you touch. Why not try and make something for a change?\" she suggested, hoping that her room wouldn't have any more destruction, but she was calm about it than freaking out like Nani. Kahlia did so. Stitch got an idea and built a fake San Francisco. \"Wow, San Francisco.\" Lilo said as she clung to her bed. She then watched with a stoic expression as Stitch destroyed his model city and went around in a Godzilla fashion. \"No more caffeine for you...\" she shook her head. Kahlia went to the window seat. Stitch continued a while. What they all didn't know, at least Lilo and Stitch, was that Jumba and Pleakley were watching over them in the forest away from the house to spy on the Pelekai family with Stitch's custody. \"This unknowing little girl is wasting her time,\" Jumba chuckled. \"626 cannot be taught to ignore its destructive programming.\" Pleakley was trying his black wig on again. Jumba chuckled, then looked over his shoulder. \"What are you doing?\" \"Nothing...\" Pleakly says too quickly. He hid the wig. \"Say, I want to try it on!\" Jumba reached for it, seeing it even when Pleakley swiftly hid it away. \"No, it's mine!\" Pleakley says, half-whining. Jumba and Pleakley fought for the wig. However, Jumba won and had it over his head, but he was wearing it wrong. Just then, a mosquito came onto the noodly alien's arm. Pleakley made Jumba be quiet and went on about how this 'rare' creature had chosen him as it's perch. More mosquitos came for Pleakley. He wouldn't be excited about them for long. Pleakley was happy until he realized that they were biting him. After they were all shooed away he was bandaged up and lying down. Jumba decided to get some rest for the night since Stitch was powering down with nothing left to destroy. Pleakley looked up at the sky. Kahlia was now asleep on the window seat. A small frown on her face as she slept. Stitch was wandering aimlessly, looking at books. Lilo was fast asleep in her bed. The 'destruction of San Francisco' really took a lot out of her. Stitch found the 'Ugly Duckling' book and went to ask Lilo what it was. Kahlia was still asleep. Lilo shifted in her sleep, feeling Stitch's touch. She yawned a bit and sat up to see what he wanted and saw he had one of her favorite books. \"That's the ugly duckling... See? He's sad, because he's lost and nobody wants him... But on this page, he is found and he finds his one place where he truly belongs...\" she smiled at her pet, allowing him to go back to to bed. She then decided to go to her record player and take out the black vinyl disc in it while Stitch got settled in. \"Wanna listen to the King? You look like an Elvis fan.\" Stitch looked at her. Lilo then took out the record player and put some headphones on Stitch's ears to listen to some of Elvis's best hits so she wouldn't wake up Kahila or Nani. She had put on Hound Dog and smiled at Stitch as she used the other piece to put on her free ear. Stitch looked at it and then had an idea. He took the needle off, gently though, and put his claw on it. He took the headphones' plug and the song actually played. Lilo smiled, then noticed this. Her eyes widened and closed his mouth which made the music stop. She opened his mouth again and the song played again. \"Whoa...\" she couldn't believe how talented her 'dog' was. Stitch looked at her. Kahlia shifted in her sleep. Lilo looked to Kahila and shook her awake. \"Kahila... Kahila! You have to see this!\" Kahlia yelped and fell off the window seat. \"Ow!... Morning, Lilo...\" she mumbles. \"Oops, sorry...\" Lilo said quietly as it was still late and Nani was probably sleeping. Kahlia looked up at her. \"Yeah...\" she mumbles. She got up and stretched. \"Watch this.\" Lilo said, then went to play her record player. She gave a moment signal, as she put Stitch's claw on the record like a needle, then opened Stitch's mouth to play Blue Christmas. Kahlia looked shocked. She blinked a few times and her mouth dropped open. \"Wow...\" she says. \"We gotta show Nani...\" Lilo suggested as she closed Stitch's mouth. \"Yeah.\" Kahlia agrees. She yawned quietly a little. Lilo saw how it was still late, then decided to get some sleep. \"Night, guys, we'll see her bright and early.\" The next morning Nani was asleep still. Kahlia carried the record player for Lilo. \"Nani... Nani!\" Lilo was trying to wake up her sister, despite how early it was. Nani pushed herself up a little. She looked at the girls. \"Look.\" Lilo told her. She then gently took the record player from Kahila and put Stitch's claw on the needle. She then opened Stitch's mouth to play Elvis's Suspicious Minds. She closed and opened Stitch's mouth over and over again. As that happened, there was pounding on the front door. Nani looked shocked then scrambled to get the door. Kahlia followed. \"Heard you lost the job...\" It was the social worker, Cobra Bubbles. He looked just as plain and stoic as always. Lilo was on her way too as Stitch was at the door with a book in his hands. \"Uh, yes...\" Nani says, trying to hide Stitch. Stitch snuck out though and threw a book at Cobra. Kahlia flicked Stitch's nose again, watching as he fell again, holding his nose. \"Ow, HEY!\" Cobra glared at Stitch as he was picked up by Nani apologetically. \"What is that thing!?\" \"That's my puppy!\" Lilo chirped. \"Really...?\" Cobra glanced at the sisters as his sunglasses had been blown off, but he surprisingly had no injuries. \"I'm so sorry about him.\" Nani apologizes. Stitch growled at Cobra. Kahlia handed him his sunglasses. Cobra took them from the other little girl and remembered the reason why he came to the door, other than about the elder sister losing her job. He then stated he wanted Nani to find a new job to help look after her younger sister and the next time he would see the 'dog' to become a model citizen. \"Capiche?\" \"Uhh... Yes?\" Lilo didn't understand that word. \"New job, model citizen, good day.\" Cobra put his glasses back on, one of the lenses popping out and hitting the ground as he left. Everyone exchanged looks and it was time for job hunting and hula school was closed for the day meaning Nani had to bring Stitch and the girls with her.[Chapter 6] Nani went looking with the girls. \"Be good, Stitch.\" Kahlia says. \"Yes, you should be like Elvis Presley, he was a great model citizen.\" Lilo took out a glossy photograph of the king of rock and roll himself. Mrs. Hasagawa was watering her fruits as Nani came by. \"Mrs. Hasagawa?\" Nani asked. Stitch looked at her and then the picture before Lilo again. The old woman looked up, recognizing her name, even if her hearing was really bad with her age. Lilo was teaching Stitch about how to properly dance and gave him a hula skirt. She told him what to do and did a bump with the music they had on in the background. \"Kahila, you can do it too.\" \"I'm here to inquire about the job.\" Nani says. Stitch and Kahlia both copied. \"I can't talk now, dear, I'm waiting for someone to answer my ad.\" Mrs. Hasagawa stated. Lilo and Stitch started to dance, nothing too chaotic yet. \"That's why I am here!\" Nani says a little louder. Stitch danced but then spun crazily. Kahlia was swept up to end up crashing into Mrs. Hasagawa with Stitch. Mrs. Hasagawa realized that Nani had her want ad and was on the ground with Kahila on top of her, a watermelon on her head and Stitch's head was sticking out from the fruit. \"Why is everything so dark!?\" Nani groaned, but helped everyone out. \"I'm so sorry...\" she says before taking the three away. The trio were now at Kiki's Coffee Shop. The woman behind it was pouring another cup to another satisfied customer. No one seemed to notice Cobra was there on a break. Lilo took her ukulele from Kahila. \"Mahalo, Kahila... Dad loved this.\" \"I love coffee and I like to help customers...\" Nani was trying to convince Kiki. Kahlia nodded. Her mom had loved the ukulele too. \"I'm sorry, Nani, I just hired Teddy and with the tourist season starting...\" Kiki trailed off as she heard ukulele strings being strummed. Stitch was playing pretty good, but a bit too loud. He played so loud that the coffee shop windows broke, Kiki's coffee pot broke, and it alerted Cobra's attention to look up from his newspaper. Nani looked annoyed and nervous. Kahlia blinked. Lilo made a face-palm gesture. Stitch was now wearing one of Elvis's best casual clothes with a rose as they all followed Nani to a hotel and she had gone to the front desk. \"This is the face of romance.\" Lilo showed her photograph of a very young Elvis to the two with her. Nani tried to get the receptionist to see if there were any jobs going. Kahlia looked at the elderly lady nearby. She looked a bit lonely, in Kahlia's opinion anyway. The man took out papers to check anything for Nani about an opening at the hotel. \"She looks like she could use some lovin'.\" Lilo commented about the old lady who was on the couch by herself. Nani leaned on the counter. Kahlia bit her lip a little. The lady was reading a magazine. Stitch sat on the couch and took the lady's hand suddenly. \"Oh, we might have something...\" The man told Nani as he looked through his papers. Nani smiled hopefully. The woman put her magazine down. Kahlia covered her eyes, not wanting to see, getting a bad feeling about this. \"Good, now kiss her.\" Lilo told Stitch. Stitch soon leaned over and kissed the woman. The man was just about to hand Nani a paper from his collection. The woman let out a scream. Nani gasped in horror, then grabbed Lilo and Kahlia's hands and ran so fast the girls' feet didn't touch the ground. Kahlia pouted towards Lilo and Stitch. \"I'm sure Elvis had his problems too!\" Lilo told Stitch as she was being pulled by Nani. Stitch ran after them as he looked unsure of what had went wrong. After a short break to calm down, Nani went to the lifeguard on the beach, her last chance at a job. \"I'm all about saving people?\" She said, though it was more of a question after her tiring day. Kahlia stood beside Nani, watching her cousin and Stitch though too. The lifeguard paused for a moment before looking back to Nani. \"Actually, I do think we have an opening.\" She then told her with a smile. \"Really?\" Nani asked with a big hopeful smile. The lifeguard smiled back and told her more as Stitch wandered out onto the beach. \"Oh, that'd be so great! You have no idea how badly I need this job.\" Nani told the woman. \"Okay, this is it,\" Lilo told her pet. \"Time to bring it all together.\" Stitch was now dressed like Elvis and even had his own wig and had a ukulele. Kahlia watched her cousin and her pet, wondering what was going to happen. \"It's all you!\" Lilo called out to Stitch before plugging in the stereo. \"Knock 'em dead!\" Everyone stared at Stitch until he began to play music for them. Kahlia blinked. Soon, a whole load of people crowded Stitch, taking flash photography. \"Don't crowd him!\" Lilo told the people. Stitch groaned as he looked like he was having a meltdown due to the crowd and flashing lights which made him go berserk. Kahlia looked worried. The crowd continued, one guy getting to close with his camera. However once he started going beserk they ran from him screaming, leaving the two women and the girl at the lifeguard stand which fell over. Lilo looked around before looking toward Nani. Stitch felt bad for this as he stood between Lilo and Kahlia. The lifeguard blamed Nani for the incident and soon stormed away, not giving her a chance much her dismay. Nani dropped down with a sigh. Kahlia looked sorrowful but sat next to Stitch and patted his head soothingly. Lilo took out her photograph of Elvis and soon tossed it aside herself. Stitch looked up at Kahlia with a pout. \"Whoo-hoo, surfing lesson!\" Aleka cheered as she came beside David as she was going to learn how to surf for the first time from him. Nani looked up to David and then away. Kahlia put her arm around Stitch in a hug. \"It's alright, Stitch... I hate cameras too.\" she soothed. She then noticed Aleka and gave a small wave with her free hand. \"Hey, Lilo,\" David smiled. \"Howzit... Nani...?\" \"We're having a bad day.\" Lilo sulked. Stitch looked up to Kahlia. \"Ooh...\" Aleka pouted sadly for the others. Nani just glanced away. Kahlia cuddled the blue 'dog'. David looked to them before kneeling in front of the sisters with an encouraging smile to cheer them both up. \"Hey, I might not be a doctor, but I know there's no better cure for a sour face than a couple of boards and some choice waves... Your cousin could join us. Whatya think?\" \"Ooh, would you?\" Aleka smiled which made Lilo smile back to her and David. \"I think that's a great idea.\" Nani smiled. Kahlia shook her head. \"I don't wanna surf.\" she said quietly. \"No?\" Aleka pouted to Kahlia. \"Why not?\" Stitch nuzzled up against Kahlia while Lilo and Nani looked interested in surfing. \"I'll... I'll stay with Stitch.\" Kahlia covered up, stroking the blue 'dog's' fur. Stitch smiled up to Kahlia as he didn't seem to want to go near the water anyway. \"Okay...\" Aleka sighed. \"I'm gonna learn how to surf then, I'll see you guys later, okay?\" \"You and Lilo enjoy it.\" Kahlia smiled. Nani went and fetched her and Lilo's bathing suits. Lilo looked excited about surfing as she forgot all about her gloomy mood. \"All right, you guys stay safe and dry.\" Aleka smiled back. Nani came back with the bathing suits. Kahlia waved them off with a smile. \"Oh, I guess I better go, see you guys later.\" Aleka smiled before going with Nani and Lilo. Lilo smiled to Aleka as they were going to surf with David. Stitch looked nervous about the water. \"Don't worry, Stitch, you stay here on the dry land with me.\" Kahlia soothed him with a cuddle. Nani took Lilo on her board. Stitch smiled back. Aleka was on David's board as she was going to surf with the Pelekai sisters while being taught how to surf by their friend. Kahlia smiled to him and watched her family and friends. \"Ooh~...\" Stitch said once he caught the gist of surfing before standing up and pointing like an excited child before he looked to Kahila and sat on the ground like a dog sitting since that technically wasn't normal canine behavior. Aleka laughed as she loved surfing so far. \"You wanna go surf?\" Kahlia giggled. Stitch tilted his head curiously about surfing, but he actually seemed willing this time despite his hydrophobia. \"We'll just wait for them to get back, then maybe later, you can go surfing too.\" Kahlia smiled softly. Stitch smiled back to Kahlia. Kahlia built a sandcastle with Stitch. Lilo, David, and Nani took a break from surfing and made their own sandcastle. \"Mind if I join you?\" Aleka asked Kahlia and Stitch. \"I don't wanna ruin their little family moment.\" Stitch looked curious as Aleka considered David as part of Lilo and Nani's family. Kahlia nodded, looking a bit down at that comment. \"Sure you can.\" she gave a small smile. \"Thanks... Um... Mahaylo?\" Aleka replied as she tried out some of her own Hawaiian. \"It's Mah-ha-low.\" Kahlia taught, spelling it phonetically. \"Mah-Ha-Low...\" Aleka enunciated herself before she got it. \"Mahalo.\" \"Mahalo.\" Stitch copied. Kahlia blinked then gave a nervous smile. \"This is the coolest dog I've ever met.\" Aleka smiled. Stitch smiled back to her. Kahlia gave a small smile. \"You put a couple of shells on it, and Stitch, you can put a gentle paw print on the roof... I'll go grab us a stick for a flagpole.\" she suggested. Stitch smiled back with a nod. \"Okay, Kahlia.\" Aleka agreed as she went to find the perfect shells. Kahlia smiled and headed off towards the trees to find a good stick. Stitch sat by the sandcastle to guard it while the girls went off. Lilo giggled as this was turning out to be the best day ever after a rocky start. Kahlia found one that had a leaf on the end. Nani smiled and tickled Lilo's nose with a small flag. Aleka came back with a blue shell and an almost red shell to symbolize Lilo and Stitch's friendship as she came back. David smiled down to Lilo as he got to bond with them. Kahlia came back towards them and her face fell a moment, but she hid it quickly. Nani smiled to Lilo. Lilo smiled back up to Nani and David. Stitch smiled up to Kahlia as Aleka included her seashells. Kahlia fetched a board. \"Stitch, I can take you surfing.\" she told him. Nani kissed Lilo's forehead and glanced to David. Stitch tilted his head before looking hopeful. Lilo smiled to her big sister. David looked back at Nani while looking bashful since he liked her. Kahlia nodded and took off her light jacket, her shoes, and her socks too. \"You don't mind, do you, 'Kela?\" She asked quietly. \"I don't mind at all,\" Aleka smiled. \"I just hope you guys have fun.\" Stitch ran around on the sand in excitement. Kahlia smiled and giggled. \"Just a couple of waves.\" she told her friend and then took the surfboard, resting it on the water before helping Stitch onto the board and pushing them further into the sea before jumping on it herself. Stitch was a little nervous at first, but he felt calm and a little quiet with Kahlia's help. Little did anyone know, they were being watched by Jumba and Pleakley. \"Oh, can't complain, Mom. I'm camping out with a convicted criminal, and, uh... Oh, I had my head chewed on by a monster!\" Pleakley was explaining to his mother before the last bit being directed at Jumba. \"Wait, something is not right,\" Jumba said as he took a closer look from where he hid with Pleakley. \"626 is returning willingly to water.\" \"Oh, hold on, Mom... Got another call.\" Pleakley said and changed to the other line. \"Mr. Pleakley, you are overdue. I want a status report.\" The Grand Councilwoman said. \"Oh, uh, things are going well.\" Pleakley said nervously. Kahlia was taking Stitch through a couple of small waves to get him used to it. \"He cannot swim!\" Jumba complained. Stitch smiled to Kahlia's help while Aleka stayed on the beach. \"Things are going well. Jumba, aren't they going well?\" Pleakley said then asked the criminal. \"Why will he risk drowning?!\" Jumba still couldn't believe what was happening. \"Jumba?\" Pleakley asked then covered the speakers. \"Jumba, help me out here.\" He hissed. \"I would have expected you back by now, with 626 in hand.\" The Grand Councilwoman said. \"Just a few things left to pack and, uh, we'll be...\" Pleakley said nervously. \"Hang up,\" Jumba smirked as he put his hand over the communicator as he was climbing down from the palm tree. \"We are going swimming.\" Once Jumba had left the tree, it flung Pleakley into the sea. Aleka looked around before shrugging as she sat at the beach with the others while Kahlia and Stitch would surf. Kahlia smiled. \"I'll let you on a bigger one now, just hold on and you'll be okay.\" she told Stitch. \"Ih!\" Stitch nodded to Kahila. Kahlia easily handled this wave. Stitch held onto Kahlia as they were going out to surf together. Kahlia then approached a bigger one and was struggling a little, but eager to show she could do it. Stitch gasped at the sight of the bigger wave. Kahlia rode to the big wave and flew down the crest with the board. Stitch held onto Kahlia before laughing once they were okay and soon enjoyed surfing with the girl. Aleka smiled as she felt happy for them both. Jumba was in the water and soon lunged out toward the surfboard to nab Stitch. With a scream Kahlia was thrown from the board along with Stitch and said board drifted ashore. Nani heard the scream then looked around. SPLASH![Chapter 7] \"Kahlia! Stitch!\" Lilo yelped. \"What happened?\" Aleka gasped as David came beside Nani in a worrying panic. \"Kahlia was out on a board, something must've made them fall in the water!\" Nani exclaimed. \"Where is she and Stitch?\" Lilo pouted. David soon decided to swim after Kahlia and Stitch. \"Lilo, you stay with Akela while I go and help David.\" Nani said and dived in after him. \"Okay, Nani.\" Lilo replied softly. Aleka came beside the girl as they stayed put while Nani and David went into the water. Jumba was trying to grab Stitch so that Pleakley could put him in handcuffs to take him back to the Grand Councilwoman. Pleakley got the handcuffs ready, with a oxygen tank. Kahlia managed to swim over and went to push the two adult aliens away. Nani went down, looking for Kahlia. Stitch bit onto Pleakley's oxygen tank to send him and Jumba flying away. Jumba struggled to get a hold of Stitch. David swam with Nani so that they could both save Kahlia and Stitch. Kahlia pushed Stitch up towards the surface but was grabbed. Pleakley's yell was muffled in the mask he was using. Nani handed Stitch to David and looked for Kahlia until she needed to breath and so swum up. Jumba grabbed a hold of the nearest one he could before he and Pleakley were punished by an act of karma. Stitch gurgled since his mouth was open and he soon passed out in David's arms. David held Stitch close and swam up to the surface. Nani swam out of the water, gasping and panting for breath. \"I-I couldn't find her!\" She gasped out. \"What?!\" Lilo and Aleka yelped. David brought Stitch to the surface. \"You couldn't find her?!\" he then asked Nani out of shock and dismay. \"No,\" Nani said, her face full of worry. She picked Lilo up and Akela to get them away as Stitch sat up and started snarling. \"What was she doing out there anyway?\" She asked. Stitch coughed up water and growled slightly, mostly from Jumba and Pleakley. Aleka looked a little worried about Stitch as she was with Lilo. \"She was surfing with Stitch...\" she then told Nani. Cobra seemed to be at the beach not too far away. Nani then noticed Cobra and gently placed Akela and Lilo down. \"Girls... Stay with David,\" she said. She then went towards Cobra. \"This isn't what it looks like. We were... It-It's just that-\" she was trying to explain, but unable to think of one. \"I know you're trying, Nani, but you need to think about what's best for Lilo, even if it removes you from the picture,\" Cobra sighed as he slowly removed his sunglasses as he felt bad for doing this, but it was part of his job. \"I'll be back tomorrow morning for Lilo. I'm sorry.\" Nani looked worried, and sad. \"C-Can I borrow your phone?\" She asked him, knowing this wouldn't help her case, but needing to anyway. Cobra was about to walk away and soon reached into his pocket and brought out his cellular phone for her to use, he was curious why, but he decided not to ask. Nani called the police and the coastal guard, she needed help finding Kahlia. Lilo and Aleka looked worried about Nani and Kahlia. Nani called the necessary emergency services. \"Nani?\" David asked his girlfriend before she got an answer on the next phone call. \"Is there something I can do?\" Nani looked to David, held up a finger and then told the services. She was told to go home to wait after they asked for a description of Kahlia. \"Um, not really, David... I-I need some time with Lilo and to keep listening out for if they find Kahlia.\" she said sadly, but a bit flustered too. She didn't really want to be alone though, but she had to try to spend some time with Lilo before the girl would have to be taken away. Lilo frowned as she soon went home with Nani. \"You know, I really believed they had a chance,\" David sighed as the sisters went home. \"Then you came along.\" Stitch looked up to David. Was he talking about him? \"Aleka, why don't you go with Nani?\" David suggested. \"I... I could try...\" Aleka shyly told him. Nani carried Lilo off, after giving Cobra his phone back, but wasn't too far ahead. \"Excuse me?\" Aleka stopped the sisters. \"Mind if I come along?\" Lilo looked over. \"Nani, that's mine and Kahlia's friend from school.\" she then told her older sister. Nani looked at the girl a long moment, but then thought it would be nice for Lilo later so nodded slowly, offering a hand to the girl. Aleka gave a small sad smile as she took Nani's hand. Lilo looked to Aleka as David wandered off away from the beach with his surfboard. Nani walked towards her house with both girls. \"When we get back, I need to speak with Lilo, but you can help yourself to a juice from the fridge while you wait.\" she told Aleka. \"I understand, ma'am.\" Aleka told Nani. \"Nani, I'm sorry.\" Lilo told her big sister about today. \"It wasn't your fault, baby.\" Nani comforted Lilo. She would save the heavier talk while sitting in the hammock once they got back. She gave a weak smile to Aleka for her comment. Aleka came inside of the house and decided to get some juice for herself, she wished there was something she could do to help. Stitch wandered about as he soon found Lilo and Nani talking on the hammock. Nani looked to Lilo. \"Lilo, honey... We have to, uh...\" she started to say but wasn't sure how to say it. \"Don't worry,\" Lilo softly told her big sister. \"You're nice, and someone will give you a job. I would.\" Nani sighed and held out her arms. \"Come here.\" she told her. Lilo crawled toward her sister's open arms. Stitch watched them as he was going through various emotions personally right now. Nani held her in her arms a second then pulled the flowers from their hair. \"Aloha Oe, Aloha Oe, E ke onaona noho i ka lipo~ One fond embrace, a ho'i a'e au, Until we meet again~\" she sung before letting the flowers fly through the air with Lilo's help. Lilo watched the flowers while curling up against Nani. Stitch looked curious and saddened for the girls. Nani held Lilo close as she watched the flowers float away. \"I love you baby girl.\" she said softly. \"I love you too, Nani.\" Lilo replied softly. Nani kissed her forehead then sat with her for a little longer. Sadly, it was soon time for bed for the girls. \"Come on, I want to show you something.\" Lilo told Stitch. Stitch looked over to her and followed her upstairs to her bedroom. Nani sorted out an old shirt for Aleka to sleep in and then sent her after Lilo. \"Thanks, Nani.\" Aleka told the older girl. \"No problem.\" Nani said softly. \"You have a good night.\" Aleka told Nani as she gently hugged her before joining Lilo and Stitch upstairs. Nani watched her then headed into the kitchen to sit by the phone and keep a watch on time too. Aleka gently knocked on the door and Lilo let her come in. Stitch then lifted the pillow to see an old photograph of Lilo and Nani with a pair of two adults he had never seen before. \"That's us before...\" Lilo softly told Stitch and Aleka, though mostly Stitch. \"It was rainy, and they went for a drive. What happened to yours?\" Stitch looked at her, confused, gripping his book. \"I hear you cry at night,\" Lilo told Stitch as she had been through things like this before and she was only a little girl. \"Do you dream about them? I know that's why you wreck things, and push me. Our family's little now and we don't have many toys, but if you want, you could be part of it. You could be our baby, and we'd raise you to be good.\" Aleka looked rather emotional over what Lilo was saying. Stitch stood a moment, but wanted to find his family, so headed towards the window. \"O'hana means family, Family means nobody gets left behind, but if you want to leave, you can,\" Lilo softly told Stitch before she lay down in her bed. \"I'll remember you, though. I remember everyone that leaves.\" \"Oh, Lilo...\" Aleka frowned sadly. Stitch left before he changed his mind, after Lilo was going to sleep. \"Good night.\" Lilo told Aleka. \"Good night...\" Aleka nodded before she fell asleep with Lilo. Nani stayed in the kitchen. Stitch went to the woods. Lilo and Aleka soon fell asleep as this was Lilo's final night at home. Back with Jumba and Pleakley, Kahlia was half concious as she came onto some dry land with them. Pleakley was complaining about sharks and octupi. \"Little monster!\" Jumba complained as he was washed up on the dry land. Pleakley answered the communicator as it beeped. \"Uh, Agent Pleakley here.\" He said, glancing at Kahlia. \"I have lost patience with you both. Have you captured 626 or not?\" The Grand Councilwoman asked. \"Um... Uh-uh...\" Pleakley stammered. \"Consider yourselves fired and prison bound. Your incompetence is nothing short of unspeakable!\" Came the reply from the Alien woman. Kahlia sat up and then tried to crawl away from the two. \"We're... Fired!\" Jumba realized before he sat up in excitement. \"Now, we do it my way! Eh, where are you going?\" he then glared to Kahlia. Pleakley looked worried. \"Trying to escape?\" Kahlia stated, though it came as more of a question. Jumba laughed. \"Oh, nice and clever try, but I am thinking of not possible.\" Kahlia tried anyway. Jumba grabbed Kahlia and threw her over his shoulder and ran off with her. Kahlia yelped as she was lifted and tried hitting his back while kicking his front but of course not hurting him as she was only young. Pleakley gave chase though was slower than Jumba. Stitch woke up slowly in the woods and glanced around. Jumba laughed as he soon went to find his experiment. Stitch looked eager as the bushes rustled but stood up quickly, about to run as he noticed it was Jumba. He let out a gasp. Kahlia struggled, but recognized Stitch's gasp. \"Stitch?!\" She gasped out herself. \"Don't run, don't make me shoot you,\" Jumba softly told Stitch at first. \"You were expensive.\" Stitch took a single step back, his ears drooped and then looked to Kahlia. He looked unsure. Kahlia tried to lift herself enough to see Stitch. \"Yes, yes, that's it... Come quietly.\" Jumba told Stitch. \"Mm... Waiting,\" Stitch said. \"And... Let friend... Go.\" he added. Kahlia smiled a bit to the friend remark. \"Waiting for what?\" Jumba glared slightly as he refused to let go of Kahlia. \"Family.\" Stitch told him, then glancing to his book on the floor. Kahlia squirmed, trying to get free but the hand keeping her down was larger than her waist so kept her in place. \"Ah... You don't have one...\" Jumba told Stitch firmly, glaring his four eyes at him. \"I made you.\" \"Oh... Maybe I could...\" Stitch started to say. \"You're built to destroy, you can never belong,\" Jumba told Stitch. \"Now come quietly, and we will take you apart. If you're good, then you can eat this creature.\" Stitch wanted to help Kahlia, but didn't want to caught so ran. \"Go, Stitch!\" Kahlia shouted, wanting the blue 'dog' safe. \"No, no, no, no, don't, don't run!\" Jumba tried to stop Stitch, though it was no use. \"Don't run!\" He then groaned and chased after Stitch, nearly dropping Kahlia as he brought out his plasma gun. Kahlia yelped as she was almost dropped. \"Be careful of the human!\" Pleakley yelled. \" You be careful of human, I catch 626!\" Jumba scoffed at Pleakley. Pleakley glared, though worried the human girl would be hurt. Jumba kept chasing after Stitch with a glare as he wasn't even going to spare Lilo if she would be around. In the kitchen, Nani sighed into her coffee cup as she looked at the clock. Lilo and Aleka soon came in slowly to the kitchen to see Nani. \"Lilo, Aleka,\" Nani sniffled, wiping her eyes though. \"I didn't hear you get up,\" She told them both before noticing Lilo's attitude. \"Baby, what's wrong?\" She asked. Lilo still looked down at the floor. \"Good morning, Nani.\" Aleka wearily told the older girl. Lilo glanced at her sister softly. \"Stitch left.\" Aleka comfortingly patted Lilo on the back. \"Good morning, Aleka,\" Nani greeted softly. \"Lilo... Sometimes, you try your hardest, but things don't work out the way you want them to. Sometimes things have to change and maybe sometimes they're for the better... Even if-\" she told her then pulled Lilo close at the knock on the door. \"Nani!\" David's voice called out. \"I guess that means I have to go now too.\" Aleka said since David was at the door. Nani opened the door. \"David?\" She asked. \"I think I found you a job.\" David smiled to Nani. \"You, what?!\" Nani gasped, her face lighting up a tad. \"Old man Kukhkini's store, but we got to hurry.\" David told Nani. \"Oh, um, okay,\" Nani said then turned her attention to her sister. \"Lilo? Baby, this is really important. I need you to stay here with Aleka for a few minutes. I'm going to be right back. Lock the door and don't answer it for anyone, okay? Things are finally turning around,\" She smiled and kissed Lilo's forehead. She then ran out with David. \"Aw, David, I owe you one.\" She told him. \"That's okay,\" David smiled to Nani as he led the way. \"You can just date me, and we'll call it even.\" Nani chuckled. David and Nani were soon out of sight.[Chapter 8] Stitch ran to the front porch. \"Come back here, you little-!\" Jumba glared as he chased after Stitch while trying to shoot him down. Stitch escaped inside and slammed the door shut, panting rapidly. \"Stitch, you came back?\" Aleka asked. \"What is it?\" Lilo asked her former pet. \"Shh.\" Stitch hissed and pulled them safely into another room. Lilo and Aleka blinked at first. \"Oh, hiding behind your little friends won't work anymore,\" Jumba smirked to Stitch.\" Didn't I tell you? We got fired this morning. New rules.\" Stitch hid with the girls, then noticed Scrump and a rollerskate and had an idea. \"What're we gonna do now?\" Lilo frowned to Stitch. \"What can we do?\" Aleka looked a little worried. Jumba shot all around and soon fell over as he shot the record player, making it play an Elvis song. \"Ooh, I love this song!\" he then smiled to the beat before he went back to work. \"Screwdriver.\" Stitch said in his alien accent. Aleka handed the screwdriver over. Jumba looked all around with his gun intact as he looked for Stitch. Stitch did some surgery on Scrump to make it into a bomb. He then wheeled it out towards Jumba. \"What the...?\" Jumba asked as he was about to reach out until it exploded on him, blowing him back and the doll even bounced on his belly. Stitch then scurried along the roof. \"What's the big deal?\" Jumba smirked as he grabbed plates to throw at Stitch to knock him down. \"I'll put you back together again. I'll make you taller, and not so fluffy!\" \"I like fluffy!\" Stitch exclaimed. Seeing the stuff flying through the roof, Pleakley carried Kahlia over to the house. \"No, no, no!\" He exclaimed. Jumba glared as he kept trying to get Stitch with whatever he could throw at him. Stitch then stood up on the roof and said something in his and Jumba's language. \"Oh, leave my mother out of this!\" Jumba glared. The roof collasped on top of Stitch at that. \"You could do with a makeover,\" Jumba said as he looked for Stitch. \"I tried to give you my good looks, but let's face it, something went wrong.\" \"NO!\" Lilo and Aleka yelled out, trying to beat up Jumba with the broom and mop. Stitch snarled, kicking Jumba away. \"There has to be someway out.\" Aleka told Lilo. \"There is, but we gotta get Stitch.\" Lilo nodded. Stitch came over to the girls after knocking Jumba away. \"Come here, Stitch,\" Lilo told the blue 'dog' so they could get out as she opened one door. \"Quick, follow me! If we make it to-\" \"You're alive!\" Pleakley exclaimed. \"Lilo!\" Kahlia gasped. \" THEY'RE ALL OVER THE PLACE, AND THEY GOT KAHLIA! \" Lilo yelped. \"Let go of Kahlia, you mean alien!\" Aleka glared as she kicked Pleakley against one leg. Pleakley yelped and dropped Kahlia inside just as the door was slammed shut. Kahlia got up from the floor. \"Running away?\" Jumba smirked as he held out a homemade weapon made out of combs, a tube of toothpaste, and toothbrushes before tossing it like a ninja throwing star only for it to hit the door and just miss Pleakley by a few inches. \"Here, let me stop you.\" Lilo and Aleka took Kahlia out of the way to safety. Pleakley glared at Jumba. \"Call Mr. Bubbles... I'll help Stitch.\" Kahlia said. \"What do I do?\" Aleka asked Kahlia. Lilo soon took out Cobra's calling card and dialed the number, waiting for an answer. \"Make sure Lilo can call him.\" Kahlia nodded then went to grab some plates to throw at Jumba. Aleka nodded an rushed over. \"You always get in the way!\" Jumba glared back at Pleakley. \"Where's the girls? What have you done to the girls?\" Pleakley gasped out and grabbed Jumba's face. \"Hello, Cobra Bubbles?\" Lilo said once she finally got an answer. \"Aliens are attacking my house.\" \"No, no, no! No aliens!\" Pleakley exclaimed. Kahlia threw the plates at Jumba. \"They want my dog and tried to take my cousin!\" Lilo continued. \"Why, you!\" Jumba glared. \"There's no need to alert the authorities!\" Pleakley yelled then put on a calm voice. \"Everything's under control.\" He tried to cover, taking the phone. \"Leave Stitch alone! And this is for grabbing me you big bully!\" Kahlia exclaimed as she threw the plates. 'Lilo, who was that?' Cobra asked on the other end. Aleka glared at Pleakley, trying to take the phone from the one-eyed alien. Stitch laughed as he got the chainsaw. Pleakley was pushed away from the phone. Kahlia backed away after finishing the plate throwing. \"Oh, good, my dog found the chainsaw.\" Lilo said before getting off the phone. 'Lilo, don't' hang-' Cobra tried to tell her, but it was too late. Jumba came toward Kahila before he saw Stitch with the chainsaw. Stitch threw the chainsaw at jumba then picked up the plasma gun. Kahlia gasped. Jumba dodged the chainsaw, but put a carrot in the gun. \"You shouldn't play with guns~\" he then scolded slightly. \"Oh, okay.\" Stitch said and tossed the gun to Jumba. Kahlia watched in shock. \"Thank you,\" Jumba replied until he then realized what just happened and gave the gun back. \"Oh, uh, I just remember, it's your birthday, Happy Birthday!\" \"Merry Christmas.\" Stitch retorted, throwing it back to Jumba. Kahlia watched, intrigued. \"Is not Christmas!\" Jumba replied, throwing back the gun. \"Happy Hannukah!\" Stitch exclaimed. Kahlia was curious about the exchange. \"Is not Hanukkah!\" Jumba told Stitch. Stitch continued the tossing of the blaster between them. Kahlia looked between them like following a tennis match. Pleakley picked up Lilo and Aleka and ran off with them. \"We're leaving Stitch and Kahlia?\" Lilo asked Pleakley. \"Put us down!\" Aleka groaned. \"Trust me, this is not going to end well.\" Pleakley told the girls. \"But Kahlia's in there!\" Lilo told him. \"I have to get you two to safety first!\" Pleakley said. Jumba continued to go against Stitch as the gun was about to explode due to the blocked pressure. Once they were safe enough away, Pleakley put them down and started to run back for Kahlia only to fly back overhead from the blast of the plasma gun. Stitch had just enough time to protect Kahlia from the worst of the blast. Kahlia, however, was blasted away with Jumba, separated from Stitch. Nani was at the shop, and just stepped out. \"Thanks. Mahalo plenty. You won't be disappointed. I'll show up early to help with the morning deliver-\" she started only to be interrupted. A firetruck was soon driving down the road, passing Nani at the shop. \"Oh, don't turn left...\" Nani pleaded quietly. Unfortunately, the firetruck did in fact turn left and was on its way to Lilo and Nani's house. \"Oh, no...\" Nani groaned before running to her house. The firemen took care of the house as Cobra came over while holding Lilo. \"One of them had a giant eye in the middle of his face.\" Lilo told Cobra about the alien invasion. \"Oh, Lilo.\" Nani gasped out in relief, about to come over. Cobra soon saw Nani and put Lilo inside of the car. Aleka looked horrified for the sisters now because of what was happening. \"Please don't do this.\" Nani begged quietly. \"You know I have no choice.\" Cobra firmly told Nani. \"No! You're not taking her! I'm the only one who understands her other than Kahlia! You take that away, she won't stand a chance!\" Nani shouted only to be restrained by a firefighter. \"You're making this harder than it needs to be.\" Cobra told Nani. Lilo looked over in dismay as she feared for the worst. \"You don't know what you're doing!\" Nani exclaimed. \"She needs me!\" \" IS THIS WHAT SHE NEEDS?! \" Cobra replied as he yelled back at Nani. Lilo frowned as she had to get out of there somehow. Nani flinched to that. \"It seems clear to me that you need her a lot more than she needs you,\" Cobra told Nani before opening the door as Lilo ran out of the car. \"Lilo? Lilo!\" \"Lilo!\" Nani shouted. Lilo kept running as far away as she could. Kahlia tried to sit up only to let out a small cry of pain, though it was only painful when she moved. \"What happened?\" Jumba groaned himself. Kahlia managed to lie on her good side. \"We got blown up.\" she gasped out. One side of her body was burned, though not disgustingly, though it had traces of the green plasma glowing like her blood on that side was green. The hair on that side had burned so it now resembled a shaved side of her head. \"Uh... Are you being okay...?\" Jumba glanced oddly at the girl since she looked quite different now. \"No...\" Kahlia whimpered, but trying to be brave, she then looked up at Jumba, her eyes filled with tears. \"Please don't leave me here.\" she whimpered. Pleakley came looking for Jumba. Jumba could only stare at Kahlia as he wasn't sure what to do or say right now. Pleakley came over and gasped at the sight of Kahlia. \"We can't leave her like this,\" he said. \"Lift her up carefully and we'll have to get her to the ship as soon as possible so we can get her fixed up.\" he said. \"Is this normal for humans?\" Jumba asked Pleakley as he did as instructed. \"No, that blast has hurt her badly.\" Pleakley said. Kahlia held in a pained yelp as she was lifted, but was glad they weren't leaving her. \"It's okay, Jumba's got you...\" Jumba actually comforted. Kahlia looked up at him and gave a small nod though cringed in pain. Pleakley sprayed her with a painkiller that would work for a while. \"Better?\" Jumba asked softly. \"Ih.\" Kahlia managed, it easier on her body to say that than 'yes'. Pleakley also clipped a small scanning device to one of her good fingers. \"I am not understanding, I thought she was human child.\" Jumba said to Pleakley. Pleakley looked to Jumba. \"She is, but she was hanging around your experiment... She probably learned it from him.\" he said. He then led the way. Jumba shrugged as he walked with Pleakley. Kahlia used her good arm to gently grip at Jumba's jacket. Jumba looked back to Kahlia. Kahlia looked up at him with dazed, but clear eyes. Jumba looked back down to her, right in the eyes. \"Please don't drop me this time.\" Kahlia said quietly, moving her mouth as little as possible though. She thought that even under the madness she could see the fatherlyness to Stitch under it. \"Ah, did I drop you?\" Jumba asked. \"When you first got fired.\" Kahlia explained. \"Ah... I am sorry...\" Jumba told Kahlia. Aleka soon ran off to find help as she went into the neighborhood as Myrtle and her friends were on their trikes. Myrtle ignored Aleka. The blonde, Elena, looked at Aleka. \"What's wrong?\" She asked her. \"Lilo... Aliens... Stitch... Kahlia...\" Aleka panted once she came to a stop. \"Help...\" \"Aliens...?\" Yuki asked. \"What aliens?\" Myrtle looked at Aleka. \"What are you talking about?\" She asked. Elena looked to her other friends then Aleka. \"What's up with Kahlia and Lilo?\" She asked. \"Aliens attacked Lilo's house to get Stitch...\" Aleka told them all. \"They even got Kahlia! We have to save them!\" Teresa and Yuki looked to each other. \"Are you sure?\" Teresa asked Aleka. \"Uh-huh!\" Aleka nodded. \"I don't believe it.\" Myrtle stated. \"Well, I do... Aleka has never lied to us before.\" Elena told the others. \"Yeeeeeah!\" Yuki and Teresa agreed. Aleka smiled as they believed her instead of following Myrtle like they did before in hula class. Myrtle glared to them. \"If you go with her, don't bother speaking to me again.\" she said. Elena looked at her, but then went to Aleka's side. Yuki looked nervous at first and Teresa soon went to join Aleka. Myrtle glared at the ones by Aleka. \"Let's go, guys.\" Elena suggested. \"Hey, wait for me!\" Yuki called out as she joined Aleka and the others. Aleka smiled to this and then led them back to where she came from. Myrtle watched them go, then huffed and pedalled off without them. Elena gave a smile to Aleka. \"You didn't have to do that.\" Aleka told the other girls. \"Well, to be honest, I actually didn't wanna play Dolls...\" Yuki said. \"Me neither...\" Teresa groaned. \"It was fun at first, but now it's a little annoying after a while.\" \"I didn't mind the doll thing, but she only wanted us around to boost her ego.\" Elena nodded. \"It's bigger than space!\" Teresa added. \"Oh, uh, sorry, Aleka.\" \"I'm sure we can make it in time, at least, I hope so.\" Aleka replied. Elena put a hand gently on Aleka's shoulder. \"We will.\" she soothed. \"Lilo! Stitch!\" Aleka called out. \"Here, doggy!\" Teresa added. \"Hey, Weirdl-I mean Lilo!\" Yuki helped. \"Lilo!\" Elena called, then heard the sounds of a rocket engine or something. \"This way!\" Elena said, leading the way. The other girls followed after Elena. ","Summary":" A/N: More RP's with AnnaleaseTurner.

Instead of writing the entire story and uploading it all at once, I'm going to write it chapter by chapter so I can get feedback! So please, REVIEWS ARE LOVE . The more reviews I get, the sooner I'll upload the chapters! So here I give you the Prologue to \"Wild Cards.\" Enjoy, laugh, cry, smile, and review! How fickle my heart and how woozy my eyes I struggle to find any truth in your lies And now my heart stumbles on things I don't know My weakness I feel I must finally show -\"Awake My Soul\" by Mumford & Sons \" ...And with the new federal desegregation order in act, T.C. Williams will be the first integrated school in Alexandria. The school board has issued a statement saying that are currently in the process of integrating the staff as well to help relieve tensions among incoming students this school year. The new head football coach, Herman Boone, has recently commented that he is in the process of making last year's head coach, Bill Yoast, assistant head coach this year in order to help encourage students of both races to join the team- \" \"June, could you shut that off? It's time for dinner!\" June Simmons sighed as her mother's shrill voice cut off the reporter. She shut off the TV on her dresser and walked downstairs, a scowl evident on her face. When she walked into the kitchen, her mother was setting the table, her dark curls pinned away from her face as if she was going out. Her brother, Ken, sat at his spot at the table, drool nearly coming out of his mouth as he watched their mother set a steaming bowl of mashed potatoes on the table. \"I've got meatloaf in the oven,\" her mother said, lightly smacking her brother's hand away from the potatoes. \"Hurry up and wash up before your brother eats the table.\" The thirteen year-old frowned, sticking his tongue out at her as she turned around to get the meatloaf. June smiled to herself and washed her hands, moving out of the way as her mother literally waltzed past her with the main course. The meal was a quiet one, not unusual with their family though. The only sound that could be heard was the clinking of silverware and her brother's loud chewing from the other side of the table. \"Ken,\" her mother scolded, \"For heaven's sake, try to have some manners!\" He stopped, rolling his eyes and taking a sip of his iced tea. Her mother's gaze wandered to June, who was playing with her peas on her fork. She sighed and let them plop back onto her plate. \"Nervous about school?\" her mother asked. \"You've still got another couple of weeks or so before it starts up again.\" \"I guess so,\" June mumbled, throwing her napkin on her plate and leaning back in her chair. \"I'm just nervous about... well...\" Her mother nodded, immediately understanding what she was talking about. The school district had finally been pressured into integrating the high school. They'd held off as long as they could, but it was rumored that the head of the school board would be arrested if they waited any longer, so they finally broke down and announced at the end of the school year last year they'd be letting the colored school down the street into the senior high. It was a pain in the butt, especially since they had decided to integrate the two schools her senior year. There would be protests for weeks from angry parents and staff outside the school grounds, just like the ones she'd seen on the news from other integrations around the area. \"Things will turn out alright,\" her mother said, pouring herself another glass of iced tea. \"Yeah, but we'll have no football team!\" Ken blurted out. They both turned towards him, taken aback by his harsh tone. \"You know,\" he continued, his voice softer, \"There being a colored coach and all. None of the boys are going to want to join!\" Her mother coughed lightly. \"Well, let's just be thankful no one in this family is on the team.\" \"Momma,\" June said, \"Integration doesn't just affect classes and sports. There will be colored girls on the squad now too. And a colored girl may end up as captain.\" \"See?\" Ken said, shoving another spoonful of mashed potatoes into his mouth. \"There won't even be cheerleaders!\" \"Don't talk with your mouth full,\" her mother scolded. \"You've only got one year of high school left, June. Just keep your distance and I'm sure everything will be fine!\" The table fell silent again and Ken shoveled the last of his dinner into his mouth before running out the door to play football with the neighborhood boys. Her mother began to clear the table while June shuffled to the sink to wash the dishes. A late summer breeze blew through the open screen doors, warming the room with its smell of late evening barbeques and campfires. She patted her blonde hair, hoping the humidity outside wouldn't make it frizz. Her mother plopped tonight's dishes into the soapy water below her, interrupting her thoughts. She began scrubbing, glad to have something to keep her mind off the upcoming school year. The phone rang on the other side of the room, making her jump and splash water on the floor. As she grabbed a towel to clean it up, her mother answered it. \"Hello? Oh yes... yep... yes, she's right here.\" Her mother held the phone out to her. \"It's Emma.\" Emma Hoyt had been June's best friend since the seventh grade. She was editor-in-chief of the school newspaper, won homecoming queen two years in a row, and was dating All-American football star, Gerry Bertier, which turned many of the girls in their grade green with envy. \"Hello?\" June said, putting the phone to her ear. \" June !\" Emma's voice said excitedly, \" Did you hear the news ?\" \"About what?\" she asked, twirling the phone cord in her hand and leaning against the kitchen wall. \" Coach Yoast had a big dinner with the boys tonight announcing that he was going to take a year off- \" \"He's what ?\" \" Hush up, June! Let me finish! He was in the middle of explaining he was going to take a year off because of the demotion, when the boys announced they weren't going to play if he left !\" \"But these boys love football! I bet you at least half are counting on this season to get college scholarships!\" \" No, listen ! Coach Yoast agreed to stay! There's rumors he may get the position of assistant head coach !\" June's face lit up. \"That's great! Oh gosh, Emma, you have no idea how much all of this has been worrying me! If we don't have a football team, that's it for cheerleading season!\" \" Don't worry about it. Gerry and the boys will run these colored players right off the field and the team will be just like it was last year. And with no colored guys on the team, what colored girl is going to want to join the cheerleading squad ?\" She has a point , June thought. \"Yeah, I suppose you're right. So when does Gerry head off to football camp?\" \" A couple days or so... I'm scared for him! All those colored folk hate us and who knows what they'll do to him !\" She laughed. \"Emma, you really don't have anything to worry about. With his size and strength, he could take any one of those black boys down in a second!\" She heard relief in her friend's voice as she said, \" Yeah, I suppose you're right. Anyway, since we're on the topic of sports, how's Walker doing? Still wrestling this year ?\" \"Yeah, he's alright. He's been at the beach for the past couple of weeks with his family. My mailbox has been flooded with postcards!\" June said, smiling as she glanced at the postcard currently sitting on the kitchen counter. Walter Jones and June had been going steady for nearly eight months. He was the captain of the wrestling team and brought the team all the way to the regional's championship last year. They were crazy about each other, and this beach trip was the longest they'd been away from each other since they'd started dating. \" How adorable !\" Emma's voice exclaimed from the other line. \" You two are cutest thing ever! You guys will definitely get a nomination for homecoming court! \" \"That's sweet, but we both know you and Gerry are going to win.\" \" You never know ,\" her friend said, but she was only saying that to be polite. There was a short pause, both of them not knowing what to say before Emma spoke up again. \" Well, I gotta go. I'm meeting Gerry for a picnic. But before I go, are you doing anything next Friday? Kelly, Paula, and I were going to have a sleepover at my house !\" \"Sounds like fun! Yeah, I'll be there.\" \" Awesome! See you then! Bye June !\" \"Bye, Emma,\" she said, cut off by the receiver on the other end. She glanced up at her mother by the sink, eager to hear what Emma had to say. As she hung up the phone, she sighed heavily and ran her fingers through her hair, worrying about the frizz again. It was going to be a long year.[Chapter 2] 6/19/12 I would really appreciate some reviews you guys! :) What's the point of even publishing this if I don't know anyone's reading it? I'm heading to Europe for the next couple weeks (Yeehaw, I can't wait!). I'll be in Austria, Germany, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia touring the world's music capitals on my American Music Abroad trip! I spent nearly all day packing and trying to keep my luggage under 35 lbs and trust me, it's been a struggle when you're addicted to shoes like I am! However, that means limited internet access and I won't be able to publish anymore chapters until I get back on the 9th. But don't worry, I will have plenty of time to write on my ten hour flight... (totally NOT looking forward to that!) So if, AND ONLY IF, I get enough reviews I will publish three or four chapters when I get back. Yes, I know I'm being mean by holding my chapters hostage until I get reviews... but I'm tired of publishing stories and not getting very much feedback. SO REVIEW PEOPLE. REVIEW LIKE JUNE'S LIFE DEPENDS ON IT. (I know you're not that attached to her, we're only on chapter one, but for my sake just pretend like you are.) So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin You're waiting for someone to perform with And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do The movement you need is on your shoulder -\"Hey Jude\" by the Beatles The boys were back from camp. The town had been unusually quiet while they had been gone. The rowdy teenagers weren't there to fill the silence with their laughter and jabbering. The town had been in an uproar before they left for camp due to a white man shooting a black teenager outside one of the convenient stores in the town's shopping center and the boys had been some of the first to start the riots. Gerry and Walker had lingered outside the shop for days, warning any colored man that walked past they'd be next. But with them gone, this had quieted down significantly and things were almost back to normal. Walker, Emma, and June were sitting at one of the booths in the back of the local soda shop. Walker had his arm around June, stroking her shoulder with his thumb while Emma slurped away noisily at her root beer float. \"He'll be here any minute,\" June comforted, pushing the float away from her. \"I know, I know,\" Emma said, pushing her long blonde hair from her face. \"I'm just nervous. He gets so tense around colored folk and he just spent two weeks cooped up with one of them in a dorm!\" Walker's arm tensed up around June's shoulders. His dark eyes narrowed, giving him an appearance she didn't like. She patted his leg with her free hand, giving him a small smile as she continued to look over her menu. Emma began slurping away at her float again until there was none left and she resorted to biting her nails, worry evident in her light green eyes. The bell to the shop's door rung as it swung open. Gerry Bertier's crooked smile could be seen over the many rows of booths and in one swift movement, Emma was out of the booth and in Gerry's arms, kissing him lightly on the lips. They walked back to June and Walker, hand in hand, huge grins on both of their faces. \"Welcome back, Bertier,\" Walker said, taking his arm from around her shoulder to shake his hand. \"June,\" Gerry said, flashing her a smile as Emma and he slid into the booth. \"Missed seeing you two while I was gone. Camp was hell!\" Walker tried to ask more about it when the waitress came to take their order. \"Double bacon cheeseburger with fries,\" Walker ordered, handing June his menu. \"And a chocolate milkshake, please.\" \"Shouldn't you be watching what you eat?\" June teased as the waitress took Emma and Gerry's orders. She playfully poked him in the stomach, smiling, but it quickly vanished from the harsh look he gave her. She sighed and ordered a salad, giving the waitress their menus as Emma whispered something in Gerry's ear, making him laugh. She sometimes envied Emma of having such a well rounded boyfriend. Gerry was well-mannered, handsome, tall, well-built... someone you wouldn't want to get into a fight with that's for sure. Walker on the other hand had a tendency to be rude and quick tempered when he was angry. When they first met he was strong and muscular but had let himself go after the wrestling team lost regional's and had gained some significant weight. She loved him, but sometimes she wished he would be more patient and understanding. \"How's the new coach?\" Emma asked nervously to Gerry. He looked around the table at the three of them, his eyebrows drawn together in deep thought. June looked at Walker, whose expression had grown dark and serious again. Gerry had always been one of the first to put a colored student in line if he ever crossed him. In fact, she couldn't remember a single day after school last year where she didn't hear him throwing insult at the colored students walking home from school. It was unlike him to be hesitant if he was given an opportunity to insult colored folk. \"He's... crazy,\" he said at last. \"For the first few days he had us doing three-a-days and doing up-downs like we were machines created to play football or somethin'.\" She could hear Walker gritting his teeth together. \"Yoast's still on board?\" he asked. \"You bet,\" Gerry replied, leaning back as their waitress set a glass of pop in front of him. \"Him and Boone were at each other's necks the entire time but we survived.\" He took a sip of his cream soda before another crooked smile broke across his face. \"I'm team captain.\" \"That's great!\" Emma exclaimed, throwing her arms around him. June took Walker's hand as he relaxed and he smiled at her, obviously relieved Gerry still held his position from last year. \"Telling those blacks who's in charge, right Bertier?\" he laughed, putting his arm back around June. She sat back into the crook of his arm, a smile on her face. Walked was like an animal when he was angry, and it was rare he was this affectionate in public. Gerry's smile faltered slightly before he responded, \"Somethin' like that...\" They were interrupted by their waitress returning with their food. Walker practically dove into his cheeseburger while Emma and Gerry shared their basket of chicken tenders. June poked around at her salad, eyeing Gerry as he laughed at one of Emma's jokes. She had never seen him so... well... happy . Before he had left, he had spent nearly every day complaining about the integration of the team. It was strange that he seemed alright with colored players on the team after only a couple of weeks, and she wasn't sure if she liked it. The rest of the meal continued with Walker and Gerry talking about defensive positions and tactics while Emma and June secretly smiled at each other and shook their heads. They didn't understand boys and their need to talk about sports all the time. Even though June had been on the varsity cheerleading squad the past three years, she didn't really understand football that well. She just knew to cheer when a touchdown was scored or a first down or something along the lines of that occurred. When they paid and left, Gerry gave a quick nod and smile to the colored bus boy who was cleaning the booth next to theirs. June's eyes widened and she glanced at Walker nervously, but he hadn't seemed to notice his actions. Emma was too busy putting change in purse to notice either. \"Gerry,\" Emma said, \"Let's head down to the Sears, they've got a new line of dresses I've been dying to try!\" She flashed him that smile could melt any guy's heart and get her anything she wants. As she guessed, Gerry's eyes grew soft as she grabbed his hand and began to pull him down the sidewalk. \"See you, Jones!\" he called over his shoulder, laughing to himself. \"Later, Bertier!\" Walker called. He glanced at June, shaking his head and smiling, before beginning to head back to the car. \"Did you notice anything different about Gerry?\" she asked, taking his hand. He shrugged, interlacing their fingers. \"What do you mean?\" She sighed. \"He seemed, well, really laid back. I mean you saw how upset he was about the new coach and players before he left.\" \"There's not much for him to worry about,\" he said. \"I bet you Bosely, Budds, and him put those blacks in their place.\" She nodded, biting her lips as they reached his car. As he drove her home, she put her elbow on the window and rested her head on her hand, watching the trees and buildings whiz by as they both remained silent. They both sat deep in thought, and she could tell Walker was thinking about the upcoming season from the way he was gripping the steering wheel. If she knew any better, she guessed Gerry had made peace with the colored players, or even yet, had become friends with them. It made her extremely nervous. \"I'm going to stop by the auto shop, that okay with you?\" Walked grunted. It really wasn't a question, he just asked to be nice. \"Fine with me,\" she said, \"I'll go return my library book while you're in the store.\" He nodded as they pulled into the auto shop's parking lot. She grabbed her book from the backseat and hurried to the library a couple buildings down, trying to shake all thoughts of football camp from her mind. As she approached the red brick building, she was slightly taken aback that there was no \"WHITES ONLY\" sign on the front door. She glanced nervously around her, trying to decide if she was supposed to go in. Her gaze found the small drop off slot right next to the front doors and sighed in relief. \"What? Dammit!\" she said softly when her book wouldn't fit into the small opening. She sighed heavily, smoothed down her hair, put on her best game face, and marched through the front doors. She flinched slightly when she used to much force to open the doors, causing a loud bang to echo around the silent library. One of the librarians jumped, her reading glasses falling off her nose. She shot June a dirty look as she strolled past, heading towards the drop off desk on the other side of the room. She had been to the library nearly two weeks ago and there had been two separate sections for white and colored folk. She hadn't been downtown since then because of having to make arrangements for cheerleading tryouts and camp. It was amazing how much it had changed in that short amount of time. The colored section was gone, replaced by a new children's section (empty of children and their parents, of course) and the white section had been transformed into a non-fiction section. She paused, lingering to look around at the old library which had been a part of her childhood. It was hardly the same place, and she was beginning to second guess herself if she was in the right building when she saw two colored girls sitting at a desk a few feet away from her. They were pouring over a book and giggling to themselves while three colored boys about her age were shooting them looks over the top of their comic books at another desk. The only other people in the library were a handful of white men and women who were sitting at the desks at the other side of the room. They turned up their noses every time one of the colored girls laughed, one woman even wrinkling her nose and shifting her chair so it faced away from them. Suddenly, something crashed into her, sending her into a nearby book cart and spilling a set of encyclopedias onto the floor. \"Oh shit! Sorry about that!\" A pair of brown hands were suddenly in hers, pulling her up from the floor and putting her book back into her arms. Her gaze met a pair of dark brown eyes, some of the darkest she'd ever seen, filled with concern. He was her age, maybe a little older, with short black hair, full lips, and skin the color of mocha chocolate. She dropped her gaze, turning red with embarrassment as he dropped to the floor, scooping up four or five encyclopedias at a time and dropping them back on the cart. She stood there, dumbfounded, until he was finished. He straightened his button down shirt and flashed her a set of the whitest teeth she'd ever seen. \"Sorry again. I wasn't looking where I was going!\" She stared at him, wide-eyed with her mouth slightly open for a split second before mumbling, \"M'fine\" and scurrying away. \"Hey!\" he called after her, sending a barrage of \"Shh!\"s from every direction his way. \"C'mon, the least I can do is carry that for you!\" He was beside her in a second, taking the book from her arms and flashing her another smile. God, she wished he would stop doing that. \" A Beginner's Guide to Guitar ,\" he read off the cover. \"Ah, so you're a musician!\" She remained silent, wishing she could just melt right here and disappear into the shaggy gray carpet beneath them. The white folk were staring at them from the other side of the room, some of them whispering to one another. He was completely oblivious, staring back at her like a conversation between the two of them was perfectly normal. \"Uh,\" she said, stumbling over her own words. They reached the drop off desk and she thanked God under her breath, taking her book from him. She was glad he would finally leave her alone, but he stayed, that stupid smile on his face as she handed the librarian her book. \"Library card?\" she asked June, an eyebrow raised towards the boy next to her. \"Oh, right,\" June said, fumbling through her purse until she found the flimsy piece of plastic. \"I'm Jerry,\" the boy said as she took her card. \"M'June,\" she muttered, barely audible and averting her gaze. \"Jude? Like the song?\" he said, laughing. \" Hey Jude, don't make it bad! Take a sad song and make it better !\" \"Shh!\" the librarian scolded, making him laugh harder. \"No, June ,\" she snapped, looking him dead in the eye. The librarian gave her card back and she shoved it into her purse, perfectly annoyed with this boy. \"Thanks for your help, but I would appreciate it if you would leave me alone.\" He put up his hands as an act of surrender as she began to march back to the front doors. She could hear him giggling behind her as she began to leave. \"Bye Jude!\" he called after her, making her grit her teeth together and give him a dirty look on her way out. She could hear his laughter the entire way back to the auto shop. Disclaimer: June is yours truly, and her views do not reflect mine or anyone else's for that matter. She's a character for goodness sakes![Chapter 3] 7/19/12 Hey guys! I'm back with another chapter and I've got one almost finished, it should be up in a couple days! Europe was FANTASTIC, and I apologize for putting this chapter up almost a week late! (You guys still love me, right?) I was on an American Music Abroad Burgundy tour as a soprano 1 and had the most amazing experience in the world! I spent the first few days of the trip rehearsing at Franklin & Marshall college in Lancaster, PA and then the rest of the trip consisted of tours in Switzerland, Austria, Germany, the Czech Republic, AND Slovakia! It was ana amazing experience! I wrote this chapter on the seven hour flight from JFK to Zurich so I hope you guys like it! \"Where are we? What the hell is going on? The dust has only just begun to fall, Crop circles in the carpet, sinking, feeling. Spin me round again and rub my eyes. This can't be happening. When busy streets a mess with people would stop to hold their heads heavy.\" ~\"Hide and Seek\" by Imogen Heap It was blistering hot outside. June couldn't help but lower her arms in the middle of every other cheer to wipe the sweat from her eyes. It had to be at least 95 degrees outside and the new uniforms they had been given just hours before were more well-insulated than the ones from last year. \"Liz,\" she pleaded as the girl currently twirling in the air landed gracefully in the squad's arms, \"Can we have a break? We're practically dying!\" Their coach, Lizzy, an alumni of T.C. Williams with frizzy red hair and freckles that dotted her entire body, shrugged and nodded, biting her pencil as she walked back to her bench. June sighed, lifting her ponytail from her neck to let the summer breeze cool her skin. Cheerleading captain tryouts had been going on for the past four and a half hours merely because Liz couldn't make up her mind about which one out of the five four-year-seniors would become captain for the upcoming season. \"Liz...\" one of the girls, Kelly, said softly, her brown eyes wide. Three or four black girls were marching towards the squad across the field with Mrs. Hudgens, the woman how had previously taught English at the black school. The woman was large with dark curly black hair and full lips that were made for lipstick commercials. Her stance was strong and sure and even white men feared her when she had a reason to argue back. As she came closer, Liz's face grew pale, bringing out the freckles that dotted her cheeks. The girls in the squad all stared with their mouths slightly open as the parade of girls crossed onto the track and stood opposite of them, arms crossed and eyes narrowed. They hadn't even spoken to one another but the tension surrounding all of them was incredibly high. June put her hands on her hips, coming to Liz's side as an amused smile broke across Mrs. Hudgen's face. \"Can we help you?\" June asked, trying to sound fierce but her voice broke, causing her face to flush in embarrassment. One of the colored girls bit her lip to keep from smiling and June shot her a dirty look, causing the girl's expression to darken. \"Yes,\" Mrs. Hudgens said, her voice firm and biting. \"These girls are here to try out for the cheerleading squad.\" Liz frowned. \"Auditions aren't until next week.\" A smirk crossed Mrs. Hudgens's face, almost as if she was laughing at what had just been said. \"No, honey, the cheerleading captain tryouts. These girls are the most qualified in our phys ed department. They all received the presidential fitness award.\" Liz laughed, tossing her fiery red hair over her shoulder. \"Where are their records? I highly doubt the school district has been keeping track.\" Mrs. Hudgens frowned. \"The district has integrated all the extracurricular sports, including the cheer squad... unless you don't consider that a sport.\" That had done it. Liz's face had turned as red as her hair and she stuttered around to find the right words. The colored girls held back their laughter before she finally grumbled, \"Fine.\" June's jaw dropped as Mrs. Hudgens shoved a stack of papers into Liz's hands. The colored girls gathered together, laughing and looking over their shoulder at June and Kelly who stood side-by-side with their arms crossed. Mrs. Hudgens looked around, satisfied with the situation, before hiking up her long skirt and marching off the field. However, almost immediately as she left, the colored girls' smiles disappeared as they looked at the number of white girls outnumbering them. Suddenly, June didn't feel so sure they were laughing at them. Maybe that was the only way for them to hide just how afraid they really were. Liz glanced around, unsure of what to do. She looked at the stack of papers in her hand before chewing on her bottom lip and sitting back down on her bench. \"Well girls, looks like we're going to have to start the audition process over now that there's more... competition .\" She had a hard time getting the last word out, and the girl who had previously laughed at June shot another scowl Liz's way. She scowled right back, before putting a hand to her forehead, as if not sure how she was supposed to handle all the tension surrounding them. \"Come back tomorrow morning, bright and early. I'll have a routine worked out for auditions.\" As she began packing up her things, June curiously looked over her shoulder at the group of colored girls once more. They all looked well built, with toned legs and strong arms. A couple of them had already done backhand springs and a forwards flip down the end zone, something June had struggled with until last fall. \"June!\" Kelly called, her long brown hair already out of its ponytail. \"C'mon, I'll drive you home! It's too hot to walk anyway.\" She nodded, grateful that she wouldn't have to endure the embarrassment of walking home with the other girls. The two of them walked to Kelly's car, trying to make small talk while they thought about the possibility of a colored girl becoming captain. But June shook these thoughts from her head. It would never happen, she'd known Liz since before she was a freshman. As she threw her bag in the backseat of Kelly's car in the parking lot, she spotted something out of the corner of her eye. Two of the colored girls were coming their way, the one with the scowl in the lead. Kelly, who was already in the driver's seat, glanced at June with wide eyes before starting the car and motioning for her to get in. \"Hey,\" the girl said as June began to climb in. \"Can we have a lift?\" June scoffed at the request and shut her door quickly, leaving the colored girl surprised with her reaction. She walked up to June's rolled down window, getting so close that she could see the sweat dotted across her forehead. She was wearing a shade of lipstick that was too bright for her and her jet black hair was coming out of her clips. Kelly was trying to hold back another laugh and June held hers back as well before putting on a serious face. \"Sorry,\" she said, flipping her blonde ponytail back over her shoulder. \"Our stuff is in the backseat and frankly, we don't feel like moving it.\" She couldn't help but release her laugh when she saw their expressions as they drove away.[Chapter 4] 7/20/12 Back with another chapter so soon? Why yes! I figured I'd give you guys another chapter since I made you wait for what... three weeks? This one has a little more action than the previous so I thought this would motivate you guys to REVIEW. PLEASE. All I want is for you to review one measly chapter! :) The more reviews the sooner I'll have the chapters coming! Don't look so shocked Don't judge so harsh You don't know You are only spying Everyone knows it's going to hurt But at least we'll get hurt trying ~\"Firewood\" by Regina Spektor \"June!\" Her mother's voice tried to break through her bedroom door as she jiggled the doorknob. \"C'mon sweetheart, you can't stay in there forever! Let's talk about it!\" \"Go away!\" June had her head buried beneath the pillow on her bed, fresh tears seeping onto the the soft fabric. She knew she was being dramatic but she didn't care. After a week of waiting, she had gotten a call from Liz half an hour ago, telling her that she hadn't gotten the spot as cheerleading captain. The school district had insisted that because Gerry had the position of captain of the football team it was only appropriate a colored girl should become cheerleading captain. So the colored girl who'd been denied a ride, Regina Myers, had taken the position June had been dreaming of since she was a freshman. She heard her mother's footsteps leave, letting her head emerge from her pillow and throwing it across the room. She rolled onto her back, staring at the ceiling, unable to stop the new flow of tears running down her cheeks. She lay there for a moment, squeezing her eyes shut with her fists balled up before she exhaled slowly, letting herself relax. She sat up and picked up her phone. It rang three times before a familiar, husky voice said, \" Hello ?\" \"Walker? Hey, it's me. Do you want to do something tonight? I need to get my mind off things.\" \" Yeah I heard, babe. I'll pick you up in half an hour. We can go to the lake. \" She smiled through her tears. \"Thanks. See you then.\" Half an hour was just enough time for her to put on a new skirt and freshen up her makeup. Her new cheerleading uniform, the one with T.C. Williams branded on the front, lay in a crumpled heap at the foot of her bed. She had kept it at the foot of the stairs since tryouts but her mother insisted she move it after Ken had tracked mud all over it. She frowned at it, putting her hands on her hips and trying to decide if she should hang it up when she heard a car's horn outside. She ran to her open window, leaning out and a smile breaking across her face when she saw Walker's car sitting in the driveway. She bounded down the stairs, narrowly avoiding a rubber band Ken shot at her from the living room. On a normal day, she would confront him and twist his ear, but right now all she wanted was to get out of the house. \"June!\" Her mother emerged from the kitchen, drying her hands on a dish rag. \"It's 8:30... where are you going? I have brownies in the oven-\" \"I have to get out of here,\" she mumbled, throwing open the screen door and running down the porch steps. Walker began pulling out of the driveway as soon as she had shut the passenger door behind her, putting one arm around her shoulders and using the other to steer. The drive to the lake was a short one, but they sat in silence. She smiled slightly, leaning into his arm. She already felt better, like someone was finally here to protect her. Most people took Walker as an angry person who was a machine that could tear through opponents like they were paper at wrestling matches, but he was just protective and didn't like change which was why the integration was such a challenge for him. The car pulled into the parking lot just in front of the edge of the shore. The two got out and walked towards the pier, hand in hand. Her hair blew in the late summer breeze as they took off their shoes, sitting themselves on the edge and dangling their feet in the warm water. The sun was still setting, its reflection giving the water an orange glow. A group of children were playing at the old tire swing a few feet away, jumping into the water and creating small waves that lapped at their feet. \"This sucks,\" she said at last, biting her lip. Walker remained silent, his fists clenched into balls, but he loosened one enough to tuck a stray piece of hair behind her ear. \"I know, babe. I know.\" The children's laughter echoed around them, as if to mock how they were feeling. Walker took a few deep breaths, putting his hand around her waist and pulling her closer. She blushed, her cheeks turning a rosy pink she knew he adored. She rested her head on his shoulder and began to hum one of the marches they play at the football games. \"June,\" he said, pulling away slightly. \"Please, I don't need to be reminded of football anymore.\" She nodded, splashing her feet in the water. She didn't understand why all of a sudden the school district she had been to dedicated to all these years had taken away the only thing she'd really wanted since entering high school. \"This is just shit!\" He couldn't help himself, but he burst out laughing. He knew she was upset, and he was too, but that was the first time he'd heard her curse since they'd known each other. She was the type of girl that went to church every Sunday and wore a cross around her neck. He hadn't even seen her so much as burp without saying \"Excuse me!\" afterwards. But her dark expression made him stop and he picked up a stone, throwing it as far as he could. \"I don't even know what to say anymore,\" he said. \"It's like everything we were ever taught as kids is being thrown to the wind. They give us a nice school building with PTA meetings and shiny red slides, separating us from the black school with every ounce of power they have. But with one little threat, they throw all morals to the wind and expect us to just get along?\" She was quiet, knowing there wasn't an answer to his question. Instead, she stood up, putting on her shoes, and walked to the other side of the pier, leaning far over to watch the fish. The sun had finally set and the water was an eerie black, the darkness broken only by the glimmer of fish scales in the moonlight. A pair of strong arms wrapped themselves around her waist, and when she spun around she was looking into Walker's dark brown eyes. A small smile was playing on his lips as he put a hand on the small of her back and leaned in to kiss her. All thoughts of cheerleading and football were lost as he leaned her backwards and deepened the kiss. His fingers were tangled in her hair, pressing himself closer to her. The two were lost in the moment until June took a step back. Her heart skipped a beat when she realized she'd stepped off the pier! She grabbed Walker's shirt, hoping to regain her balance but instead, it sent them both over into the water, their lips still pressed against one another's. June came to the surface gasping for air, letting out a groan when she saw her skirt had mud on it. Walker surfaced next to her, his matted down hair covering his eyes. As he pushed it out of the way, they stared at each other in shock with water dripping from their faces before he began to laugh. She drew her eyebrows together, irritated he found it funny they were both soaked, but she couldn't help but smile when he swam close to her wrapped his arms around her once more. She hadn't seem him this romantic since when they'd first started dating. Maybe it was the integration that had made him so passionate, or maybe the fact she'd been cheated of out cheerleading captain. Either way, she liked the way he was channeling it all. She leaned into him a little too much, sending them toppling back into the water once more. However, he didn't let go but continued to kiss her. Even when they were both momentarily underwater. They broke apart for a moment, catching their breath and looking up at the half moon above them, its reflection in their eyes. \"We should go,\" she said, brushing wet strands of hair from her eyes. \"It's getting late and my mother didn't want me out anyway.\" He nodded, kissing her one last time before swimming back to the pier and hauling himself up. He offered her a hand, helping pull her up as well but burst into laughter when she realized she was missing a shoe. They saw the red Mary Jane floating away from them and she muttered something along the lines of \"Forget it\" before chucking her other shoe into the lake as well. Her mother was waiting at the door when they pulled into her driveway. Giving him a peck on the cheek, she climbed out of the car and wrung her hair out the nearby rose bush. She could tell her mother wasn't angry, just annoyed. It wasn't until they were inside did her mother finally say something. \"I don't even want to know,\" she said, eyeing her wet clothes. \"But you are not to run out of this house without my permission.\" \"Yes ma'am,\" June said, keeping her voice low. Her mother nodded, seeing anymore discussion of the topic would be overkill. \"Now go clean up and don't get any mud on the carpet.\" After a hot shower, June was back in her room staring at her cheerleading uniform. She should just quit the squad, that would show what she thought of Liz's decision! But she knew colored people made Liz as uncomfortable as herself. The decision had probably been made by the head of the phys ed department and she was just the messenger. She paused to stare at herself in the mirror, almost laughing at her appearance with wet hair and no makeup on. Her piercing blue eyes stared back at her as she laid out other possible decisions. She could still quit, but that would motivate the other girls to quit as well and that would leave the high school with an all black cheering squad which was the last thing any white student would want. She'd have to stay and represent the better side of the district. And maybe with a little intimidation the colored girls would leave and she'd be back on top. She grinned as she pulled her covers back and crawled into bed. When her lights were out and her eyes had adjusted to the dark, she rolled on her side where she could see the moon through the slits of her blinds. The events from the lake began to play back in her mind and she felt butterflies in her stomach as she though about her kissing Walker in the water. She fell asleep smiling. Disclaimer: June's views obviously do not reflect mine in any way! She's just a character.[Chapter 5] 7/27/12 I am so excited! This story is really starting to take off and I couldn't help but upload another chapter! (We've got some Rev action in this one, ALRIGHT!) I've had a lot of time to write since I've been back from Europe and I hope I can write the majority of this story before marching band kicks off. In the middle of writing this chapter I fell asleep with my head on the page and woke up with half of the chapter on my cheek since the ink hadn't dried yet when I put my head down. LOL! Thank you to those of you who have reviewed this story so far! Just remember, I not only write fanfics to get crazy alternate story lines out of my head, I write for you guys! RTT hasn't gotten nearly enough fanfic and I want to bring some attention back to this movie since it's one of my favorites! So if you haven't reviewed yet, REVIEW! I want to know what you guys like and don't like so I can improve and work on my writing! So anyway, enjoy chapter four! I really enjoyed writing this! :) That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles, And my daddy said, \"Stay away from Juliet\" ~\"Love Story\" by T-Swift The first day of school arrived faster than anyone had anticipated. Tensions had risen once the word spread that a colored girl had been chosen as cheerleading captain and June's entire family had been playing nice to her since Liz's phone call. She sneezed at the dinner table a couple of nights ago and Ken had actually said \"bless you\" to her for the first time she could remember. And Walker had invited her to go bowling with some of the guys on the wrestling team, something he'd never done before. Ken was out the door, running to the middle school while June lagged behind, caught up with kisses, tears, and photographs about her last first day of school. When she had finally wrestled herself out of her mother's arms she only had fifteen minutes to walk to school and get to homeroom before the bell rang. \"Bye Momma!\" she cried over her shoulder, skirt flying as she raced out of her neighborhood. The elementary kids snickered at her as she ran past them. She kept her books tight under one arm as she glanced at her watch, yelping at how she only had seven minutes and she wasn't even halfway there yet. She rounded the corner and the high school came into view, but the very sight of it made her stop in her tracks. There were protestors backed up all the way to the baseball fields, some of them jumping in front of the buses as they rolled into the parking lot. The police were struggling to keep it under control as they held back the crowd from students trying to enter the building. But the protestors weren't the ones catching her attention the most. It was the crowd of black students fathered by the school's front doors. They looked terrified, shoulder to shoulder with the person next to them as they looked at the chaos. She recognized one group as the girls that had showed up at cheerleading tryouts. They were all staring at her, their lips pursed and eyes narrowed. Regina Myers stood the closest to her as she walked but past, but she either didn't see her or chose to ignore her, absentmindedly tucking a stray piece of black hair back into her headband and they carried on with their conversation. As she neared the front doors, the shouting from the protestors became increasingly louder. A few parents held signs that read \"Mothers Against Busing!\" and \"Separation, NOT Integration!\" while others shouted rude names to the colored students getting off the buses. She looked around, noticing she was the only white student standing near the doors. She panicked, looking around wildly through the sea of dark faces. Just because they integrated the two schools didn't mean they had integrated the student body. \"June! Hey, June, over here!\" Emma was waving to her from the lunch tables not far off. She sighed in relief as she saw returning students, white students, from last year swarming use a few feet away. She ran to greet her, a smile breaking across her face when she saw she was standing with Alan Bosely and Ray Budds, two of Walker's close friends who were on the football team. Both boys were stiff and looked tense, especially Ray. Walker, Gerry, and he had been best friends since before she could remember. And even though Gerry was now, god forbid, friends with some of the colored players on the team after football camp, Ray's views had stayed the same and for that she was relieved. \"Hey June!\" Alan said as she neared them, flashing her a smile. \"How was your summer?\" Alan Bosely had been going to church with June since they were six. She couldn't remember a single Sunday school class without his pranks on the teachers and witty comments. He still had the baby cheeks he had then and his blonde hair was slicked back in the same way it had always been, accenting his blue eyes. He looked scrawny compared to Ray, who was well built with a firm jaw line. Alan looked like the type who should run track or play soccer, not play defense on a football team. He only played because his father had signed him up as a freshman for junior varsity, but everyone knew he had a slim chance of becoming an All-American now that he was a senior. \"Crazy,\" she said, keeping her voice low as she looked around. \"Can you believe this?\" Ray's eyes narrowed and he shook his head in frustration. \"It's bullshit.\" Alan looked from Emma to June to Ray, looking uncomfortable and unsure how to respond. It wasn't until Emma ran off to go talk to Gerry did he speak up. \"The bell's been postponed for half an hour so staff and police can get this cleaned out,\" he said, running a hand through his hair. \"I wouldn't be surprised if we had protests every day this month!\" \"Hope they keep it up,\" Ray said, loosening his collar as he spoke. \"The longer they stay, the longer we get to avoid being put in the same room as them .\" He said the last word as if there was something bitter in his mouth he needed to spit out. Alan shuffled his feet, excusing himself and disappearing into the crowd. It seemed Gerry wasn't the only one who had changed. \"Where's Walker?\" she asked, moving closer to Ray as a pair of black boys brushed past them. He shot them a dirty look, making them walk faster. \"With some friends, I suppose. The wrestling team had sign ups early this morning.\" One of the principals burst through the front doors, signaling for everyone to come inside. \"I'll walk you to homeroom,\" Ray said, taking her books and putting his hand on the small of her back, urging her forward. The black students had already begun climbing the steps to the doors but a group of white students, including June and Ray, stepped in front of them. A black boy a year or two younger than June stuck his foot out, causing Ray to stumble as he walked by. She saw fire flicker in his eyes as he turned around, arm raised. \"Ray!\" June hissed, grabbing his arm. \"C'mon, don't be stupid. You'll be kicked off the team!\" He was gritting his teeth together as a smile played on the boy's lips. He lowered his arm, his stare deadly as he said, \"You better watch it, boy. One more step out of line and you won't have any teeth left to smile with.\" He put an arm around her shoulders and they hurried inside. That morning was a blur or textbooks and forms parents needed to sign. She ended up being locker buddies with Emma which was quite a relief. Physics and American Government were going to be a snore because she had the same teachers as last year. And they hadn't bothered making a seating chart so the black students sat on one side of the room while the white students sat on the other. It wasn't until she reached AP English at the end of the day did she start getting anxious. Mrs. Hudgens was sitting at the teacher's desk, straightening papers with a smile on her face. Students were milling about, the white students feeling the most uncomfortable as they pushed to the back of the classroom. Kelly was standing near the window and June went to join her. The two girls stood side by side, silent, until Kelly spoke up. \"Did you see the new student from California?\" she asked. \"His name's Ronnie Bass! He's on the football team and he's so cute!\" \"Oh, really?\" June said, perking up at the conversation. With all the new black students wandering the hallways, she hadn't had time to see if there were any new students she didn't recognize from last year. The bell rang and Mrs. Hudgens stood up and closed the door, causing the chatter among the students to stop. \"Welcome to AP English!\" she exclaimed, the swish of her long skirt the only sound that could be heard as she went to stand in front of her desk. \"I have a seating chart printed on this paper.\" She waved it around before setting it on the stack of books in front of her. \"No arguments, no switching. This is where you'll be sitting for the duration of the semester so you might as well get used to it. Please put your reports from your summer reading on your desk and I'll be around to collect them.\" June swallowed nervously before joining the other students to find her seat. \"Third row back, second from the left,\" she muttered under her breath after reading her name on the list. She sat down at the creaky old desk and looked around her. Mrs. Hudgens was clever. She had the students completely integrated! Now that white and black students were sitting next to each other you could hear a pin drop in the room. A colored girl sat on either side of her, but thankfully, there were more white students than black so she also had classmates from last year sitting around her. Once everyone was settled, Mrs. Hudgens looked around, smiling to herself. \"Good! No problems? Alright then, introduce yourself to your neighbor while I come around and collect your reports.\" June bit her lip, pretending to be intrigued with the zipper on her jacket. Many students did no more than merely mumble their names. Alex Cliff, the kid with goofy glasses and curly brown hair who had been her lab partner last year, turned around and flashed his crooked teeth at her. He was nearly eighteen and still hadn't gotten his braces off. She rolled her eyes and glanced behind her, seeing she was sitting in front of Alan. He leaned forward in his seat and said in a low voice, \"Talk about awkward situations...\" She nodded, pushing her report to the edge of her desk when Mrs. Hudgens began walking down their row. She grimaced when her dark, meaty hand lingered on her desk. When she finally walked away, she let out the breath she'd been holding, surprised Mrs. Hudgens hadn't left dirt marks where her hand had been. \"It's okay, sweetheart. She scares the best of us.\" The voice came from the black girl sitting next to her. She was twirling a pencil through her dark fingers, a small smile on her face as they made eye contact. Regina Myers. June instantly felt such intense hatred bubbling up in her stomach that it made her want to throw up. She was so pathetic, with her knock off shoes and drug store lipstick. The only thing keeping her head that high was that she knew she was cheerleading captain and June was jealous. Her stiff, black hair was pulled out of her face by a headband and she had a plaid skirt on which showed her scabby knees. Her lips were pursed together until she opened them to say something, her hand held out. \"I'm Regina Myers.\" June's eyes narrowed and she scoffed at her outstretched hand. Her dark fingertips lingered for a moment before she dropped it, turning to talk to the girl behind her. \"Geez, June, a bit harsh?\" Alan said, eyebrows drawn together. \"Get off my case, Bosely,\" she snapped, tucking a stray piece of hair behind her ear. \"She hates me just as much as I hate her. No use in pretending otherwise.\" Mrs. Hudgens spoke up again, listing off her expectations for the semester. All the black students were attentive, but everyone else was slouched down in their seats, rolling their eyes and crossing their arms. \"I'm going to start off the course with a little class discussion,\" she said, seating herself on the edge of her desk. \"I know tensions are high right now and no one wants to be seated next to the person on either side of them, but we can all get along and respect each other at the very least.\" \"Like I'll respect one of those animals,\" the white boy behind Alan muttered. Alan and Regina both whipped around, their eyes like daggers as they stared at him. \"Got a problem, Bosely?\" he mocked. \"You're just a piss off to everyone in the room... anyone that matters at least-\" \" Romeo and Juliet !\" Mrs. Hudgen exclaimed, startling all of them and making the boy shut his trap. \"Y'all had to read it over the summer so I thought we could start off by discussing their relationship.\" Her eyes sparkled as she spoke. \"Do you think Romeo and Juliet were really in love or was it just lust and hasty decision making?\" The class remained deadly silent. No one dared raise their hand. A black student would immediately get their opinion shot down and no white student wanted to admit they were alright with the integration by answering to a black woman. Well, maybe except one. \"Yes, Mr. Bosely?\" June groaned, putting her head in her hands. He was going to get his ass kicked for sure. \"Well,\" he began, his eyebrows drawn together in deep thought, \"I believe it was true love. I mean, if I like a girl but don't love her, I wouldn't be drinking a vial of poison just because she died. I think if any of us were to ever consider killing ourselves for someone else we'd have to really love them!\" A couple of wolf whistles came from the black students on the other side of the room. Alan grinned, mouthing something to one of the boys before turning back to Mrs. Hudgens. \"Thank you, that was very... honest ,\" she said, hiding a smile. \"Anyone else?\" Again, silence. The only sound that could be heard was the shuffling of feet and creaking of desks. Mrs. Hudgens sighed, looking around the room. \"Since no one wants to volunteer, how about you, Miss Simmons?\" June felt her face grow warm as everyone turned to look at her. She swallowed hard, trying to gather her thoughts before she blurted out, \"I disagree!\" \"Interesting,\" Mrs. Hudgens said. \"Go on.\" She looked at Alan, who was ready to laugh at whatever she had to say. She sighed, balling up her hands into fists under her desk as she continued. \"Juliet is only twelve. I don't know a single twelve year-old girl that can handle a relationship, much less a marriage! Romeo is only a few years older than her, and we all know boys take years longer to mature than girls do.\" Her last comment drew chuckles from the girls around her, making June smile herself. \"Their marriage , I feel, was done out of spite towards Juliet's unwillingness to marry Paris. Marrying Romeo was the only way to get revenge on her parents-\" \"Mrs. Hudgens,\" a voice said from the back of the room, \"I'd like to disagree.\" June whipped around, daring to see who was going to challenge her. But when she saw the mocha chocolate skin and the dark eyes, she let out a small gasp. The boy from the library was smiling at her as he leaned back in his chair, cocking an eyebrow. \"Jerry Harris?\" Mrs. Hudgens asked, reading his name off the seating chart. \"Yes ma'am,\" he said. \"May I?\" June crossed her arms as he began to speak. \"You talk as if marriage lies in one person's hands. Romeo agreed to marry Juliet just as she did with him, so the marriage wasn't out of spite towards her parents-\" \"Then out of lust!\" she exclaimed, slamming a fist down on her desk, making the students around her jump. \"I mean, as soon as they were alone together they were taking their clothes off and having quite a party if you know what I mean!\" Most of the students began laughing under their breaths. The boy's eyes lip up, amused at her response. \"Going at it after marriage was completely acceptable! A relationship is built upon emotional and physical attraction! You can't have one without the other! They may have been young, but keep in mind most girls married at that age.\" \"But they got married to much older men!\" she snapped. \"They were both acting out of lust and inexperience. Their whole relationship resembles nothing more than a silly middle school crush!\" She was growing frustrated and annoyed at this boy. He had an attitude that he knew everything and was the shit. His full lips were now twisted into a grin she wanted to slap off his face. \"Romeo and Juliet may have moved quickly into their marriage,\" he said, leaning forward to get a good view of her, \"But who are we to judge that it's not true love? Just because some of us wait and date our partners for years doesn't mean your relationship is better than a couple who just started dating.\" June's face grew red and she pursed her lips together, racking her brain for a response. Regina was keeled over at her desk, laughing her head off at June's expression. The rest of the black students were giving him high fives and pats on the back. Mrs. Hudgens was smiling before she shushed the class and moved on to explaining the first assignment of the year. June slouched in her seat, trying to ignore the snickers coming from Alan. Regina continued to laugh until Alan poked her in the side, warning her to stop. When the bell rang at the end of the period, she quickly gathered her things and bolted out of the room. \"Jude! Hey Jude!\" \"Dear God, no!\" she muttered under her breath, glancing around the hallway to try and find someone she knew, but it was the end of the day and most of the students had already packed up and left. She looked over her shoulder, seeing the boy from the library coming her way. She dashed into the school's choir room, going to shut the door but it was too late. He was already right behind her, humming \"Hey Jude\" under his breath. \"Jerry Harris,\" he said, offering a hand out to her. Again, she stared at it, trying to ignore he was there at all. \"I realized I never introduced myself at the library a couple of weeks ago.\" \"I'm just here to pick up some choir music,\" she blurted out, waiting to slap herself for making up such a silly excuse. She wasn't in the chorus! She couldn't even sing! His eyes lit up once more. \"Me too! I'm a tenor! What are you?\" \"Uh,\" she said, trying to think of a response. \"Never mind, that's not why I'm here,\" he said, flashing her a smile. \"I'm sorry if I came off as rude today in class. I just think that in Romeo- \" \"I don't care what you think,\" she butted in, grabbing a piece of music off the nearby piano. \"Just stay away from me!\" She stormed out, leaving him confused as she walked outside. Walker was waiting for her, taking her books as soon as she was close enough. As he walked her home, complaining about all the black students and having Coach Boone as his gym teacher, she decided she wouldn't bring up Jerry Harris to him. The last thing she wanted was Walker to get kicked off the wrestling team for fighting. He kissed her cheek when they reached her house, running off to meet some friends of his at the soda shop. Her mother and Ken weren't home so she sat down at their old upright and began to play. After a few minutes of Chopin and Mozart, her curiosity got the better of her and she looked at the piece of music she'd taken off from the choir room, groaning when she saw the title. It was an African spiritual.[Chapter 6] 7/31/12 So let's talk about feedback! I want to know what you guys think of June, because she's not your typical Mary-Sue OC, right? :) Does she deserve Rev or do you think Walker suits her just fine? Review and tell me! Constructive criticism is always welcomed! I'd rather have someone tell me how to improve instead of just complimenting me! Yes, this chapter is much shorter than the previous but has a new twist in it which I think you guys will find exciting! I'm really enjoying writing this and I can't wait to start getting to the football games! Again, REVIEW REVIEW REVIEW! You'll make my little heart dance with joy if you do! Thank you for those who have taken the time to do so. Now, on with the chapter! Oh, all that I know, There's nothing here to run from, 'Cause yeah, everybody here's got somebody to lean on ~\"Don't Panic\" by Coldplay \" Titans got the power! Titans got the heat! Titans got the spirit to knock you off your feet! \" June carefully positioned herself in front of the row of girls, doing a backwards flip and gracefully landing in a split that made her wince. The squad had been rehearsing every day after school for the past two weeks. There were only fourteen girls, but including June and Kelly, only six of them were white. The squad was half the size of what it was last year mainly because most of the girls' mothers wouldn't let them cheer on the same squad as colored girls. \"Get off our field!\" \"Go back to where you came from!\" A group of boys were standing by the entrance to the stadium, pointing and laughing at Regina and two of her friends. A policeman saw them, scaring them off with a wave of his badge, but their jeers echoed around the field until they were well out of sight. Regina's face was scrunched up into a scowl as she faced the squad. \"Alright girls,\" she cried, clearing her throat, \"One more time! One, two, ready, go!\" The run went smoothly, white and black girls cheering next to each other with little conflict, but when the girls split into groups for lifting the segregation became evident. June helped hoist Kelly into the air with the other white girls on the squad, nearly screaming their cheers as she positioned and twirled herself in the air. \"GIRLS!\" June jumped, nearly dropping Kelly as she landed in her teammate's arms. Liz was marching across the field, a grown on her face as she neared them. \"Regina,\" she said, putting her hands on her hips. \"This isn't what we discussed yesterday.\" The captain stepped forward, looking around at the separated girls and shrugged her shoulders. \"There's not much I can do. If they don't want to interact, then that's just fine with me.\" \"I agree,\" June said, stepped forward as well. \"It's bad enough we lost half the squad to the integration. We did what they wanted, I mean, we're all on the same field and not killing each other yet. Don't make us mix.\" Liz cocked her head to the side, studying them both. \"I don't understand this squad,\" she said, now addressing all the girls. \"For the past few weeks the football team has come together but we're still struggling to even speak to one another!\" June and Regina quickly glanced at each other, averting their eyes almost as soon as they made eye contact. The rest of the girls were looking at Liz, not quite sure how to respond. \"Myers, Simmons, I want you two in the same group. Johnson, Peters, and Gawn can join you.\" With a flip of her red hair, she began yelling at the other girls to get in groups for lifting. Suzanne Johnson and Chanel Gawn were two colored girls June had see hanging around with Regina searlier, who she assumed were her close friends. Lily Peters was a junior who had cheered next to June all last season. She towered over the rest of the girls, standing at a solid 5'11\". She almost wasn't let onto the squad but June convinced Liz she'd be great for spotting. They all stood in a circle, facing each other. Lily had her arms crossed as she stared at Regina who was deep in thought. \"June,\" she said at last, \"Suzanna, Chanel, and I will lift you. Lily'll spot you, alright?\" \"Why do I have to be lifted?\" she asked, putting her hands on her hips. \"Gawn is definitely lighter than I am!\" Regina grabbed her arm, pulling her off to the side. \"Lay off!\" June exclaimed, ripping her arm from her grasp once they were behind the bleachers. \"What's your problem?\" Regina growled, leaning against the ticket counter. \" My problem?\" June hissed, taking a threatening step forward. \"I don't know, maybe I was the most qualified to be cheerleading captain and suddenly the school district thinks some black trash can take it away from me!\" Anger flickered across Regina's dark eyes. The angry expression on June's face turned to shock as Regina slapped her. She held a hand to her cheek, feeling it beginning to swell. \"What the he-\" \"Listen,\" Regina threatened, coming so close to June their noses were almost touching. \"I worked just as hard as you did for this position, probably even harder! I've spent years doing gymnastics in my backyard and lifting broken weights after school. I wasn't just handed this position out of the blue. I earned it and you just can't accept that fact!\" June was surprised that smoke wasn't billowing out of her nostrils. She had slapped her! And not only that, but she talked back to her! \"I could get you kicked off the squad for hitting me!\" she cried, showing off the red mark on her cheek. Regina merely rolled her eyes before replying, \"And I could get you kicked off the squad for not being a team-player! I don't have anything personal against you. If you hate me, fine, but just as long as you are on my squad you won't let a damn ounce of prejudice show when you are out there cheering.\" She fell silent, breathing hard and watching June as she bit her lip, hands clenched into fists. \"I will catch you when we lift you,\" Regina said, tightening her ponytail and wiping sweat from her forehead. \"You have to trust me. I want to be on this squad just as much as you do and this white and black shit isn't going to stop me from being on this team, if you can call it that.\" She paused long enough to hand June a handkerchief as a drop of blood fell from the corner of her mouth. \"Sorry I hit you,\" she said, lowering her voice. \"Let's get back out there and get this over with.\" June held the handkerchief to her face, the soft fabric soothing against her throbbing cheek. She was still angry, but she was glad to know they were both passionate about the squad and willing to fight their way against anyone who wanted to tear it apart. As they emerged from behind the bleachers, she quickly wiped all the blood from her mouth and shoved the handkerchief back into Regina's hands. The squad was silent, including Liz, as the two girls went back to their group and got into position. \"What happened to your face?\" Lily asked. \"Shut up,\" June replied, motioning for the girls to gather around her. \"What are y'all staring at?\" Regina shouted at the rest of the squad who were motionless and wide-eyed. They began bustling about, girls being tossed and lifted in a matter of seconds. Regina, Chanel, and Suzanne all had their hands out, ready for June while Lily stood behind them. June took a deep breath, closing her eyes for a moment before opening them again and stepping onto their hands. June had only been lifted a few times in her cheerleading experiences. By the end of her freshman year she was deemed too tall to be lifted, standing at 5'6\", three inches over the school's limit. She tried to remember the proper form and positions to assume but it couldn't stop the shaking in her knee as she was lifted over the girls' heads. \" Titans are ready! Titans are smooth! Titans will take control and stomp all over you !\" She felt her heart leap into her throat as she was lowered slightly, giving her momentum as she was launched into the air. Her actions seemed to move in slow motion as she did a toe touch. Squeezing her eyes shut, she braced herself for impact with the turf as she began to fall back down, but four strong pairs of hands caught her. When she peeked one eye open, she was looking into Regina's dark ones. \"I told you I would catch you.\" ","Summary":" Hey guys! I am completely ecstatic to be bringing you my newest fanfic, \"Wild Cards!\" Yes, it's a"},{"Movie":"Jeepers Creepers","Title":"fallen for a demon","Author":"centipedegirl","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9522252","Passage":"[Chapter 1] centipedegirl: yo what up, this is are JC story.

JC; at least I can get laid. Freddy; always from the people you rape. CG: Abby disclaimer and help. Abby; owns nothing, apart from her OCs Intro Fate, it's shorter for my real name. Fatal, is my name or as they used to call me, project 13. I no longer live as an experiment but as the village call a vampire. I think they've misunderstood a legend to reality, I ain't no vampire, fair enough, I drink blood but I don't change into a bat, yea I have wings but I don't know how to fly and since, when dose a vampire have the mark of a dragon on the right side of her face or has, horns coming from her head, titanium talons for nails, bat wings with titanium thumbs a flippin' tail with a flippin' titanium blade on the end. Would you still call me a vampire….I wouldn't and I don't think the splices would ether. They know what I am…but they don't know who I am. They don't know, what lies beneath my human skin. They don't know, if I have a soul or not…to be honest I don't know ether. Do I have a soul? Did I have a soul? Was it that agonising, burning pain I felt, when they filled my prison with their white gas, were they destroying my soul? I don't know…but do they know, it wasn't a monster they were slowly killing, it was another of their kind, a little girl. The human skin, I wear isn't always a disguise but it shows you a part of me, something that not many humans notice. A little girl, who looks the age of 12. That's true, I look that age but I'm not, I just simply stopped growing but keep ageing. What would you see me as? A human or monster? Would you say I have a soul or not? Do the humans, who tortured me, deserve to live and keep their soul's…I didn't think so and so they died. I'm not someone who believes in God and Satan (sorry if it's spelt wrong) but I do believe in karma and the angel of death who wouldn't? Karma is what they got and the angel is who took their disgusted souls. So far my life is stupid, I still hide, I still hunt, I still feed but I can feel something; rumours say, there's another, another what? And why do they keep saying \"the creeper's back.\" / Chapter one Bump, in the night My mind, was wondering who is the creeper? That question has been biting my ass all day. My hunt hasn't even started and still, humans keep panicking over his name. I chose to ignore their chattering and started focusing on my drawing. Yea, I draw so what, bite me. I draw my dream and my horrible past. I draw my containment; metal walls all around, see through 2in glass and a girl inside; her chest cavity is covered in bloody bandages also her breeding cavity, that's what she had to wear. Her legs are bought into her chest, her arms are tucked in and her tail is coiled around her body. She is cold, but that's how her body always has been. I remember that day, it was my first change, my heart ceiled itself in bone and my tail grew. They took me for operation, when I awoke I was the picture, a bloody mess. I sketch the prison with all the detail although there isn't much. I add no colour, why should I? It was never warm… always cold. It hurts to remember these things but I can't help it, there burned in my brain and forever, the truth to what I am now. After finishing my drawing, I flip through the other 6 pages one certainly catches my eye. It's one I drew after a hunt; it's me, feeding from my victim's neck. I was out in the open that day. I had no other choice. The male, was part of the police force; a child had been abducted that day and they mistaken me for the child. I was dreadfully wounded, after a fight with the village dog packs. The male only flashed the light on me and for that I was thankful. I could already see the male, thanks to my nocturnal (sorry if spelt wrong) eye sight. The carcass were already starting to wreak the air and I knew, if I didn't feed I would bleed to death. I laid low as the male approached, waiting for the right time to strike. He stopped and turned the light to one of the carcasses, this wasn't good so I just struck. My fangs, pierced his soft flesh with ease. A shadow flew over me but I didn't care, I was feeding, nothing matters. This picture shows the shadow; wings. Big wings that's all I drew. Myself, my victim and wings. My stomach growled, I haven't fed in 3 days. After closing my art pad, I reached for my over coat then stalked to the roof. The sun shimmered over my pale face. I closed my amber eyes, enjoying the morning sun until my stomach demanded feeding; giving me burning pain, making me clutch my stomach in agony. I listened to its orders and jumped. With lethal silence, I land on the earth and take a deep breath. It's good to be out I think and head for the village. / After walking a good 3 miles I see the village but something's wrong. I pull my hood down and carry on walking until a very strong scent coats the air. Panic…the village is in panic their scared…of what. Once I'm in the centre I start planning who I'm going to have. They keep running but why. My mind wonders. I take no notice of their stupidity and carry on with my business. \"The creeper back!\" a women screams catching my attention. Alright I give up, who the hell is this creeper guy. I'm really sick and tired of hearing his name. There's no point with trying to find a meal here and WHAT THE HELL ARE THEY DOING HERE. The men from the lab are here… but why. I take no chances, and just walk away. I will have to come at night, to hunt. (5 hours later) \"Nightfall.\" I whispered, staring at the stars, I haven't turned yet and for that I'm glad. I chose to hunt somewhere else, an old factory I grabbed my art pad and pencils to head out. When I got to my destination, I caught a familiar scent .blood just what I need, to satisfy my hunger. My eyes turned changed, so I could see in the dark. I could see a tall man, un-loading what seemed to be a white sheet, covered in red stains. I'm really losing my energy. I took my chances, and leapt for his throat. He knew I was coming and simply helped my momentum. He grabbed my leg and chucked me into a wall. I've lost too much energy, so I just let the darkness take me all I remember is his figure looming over me and those dagger like teeth stare down on me. CG; yea, first chap. I am a bit bad with spelling and comers so sorry if I've missed or misplaced any. Abby; have you cooled down. CG; no. what did you do with Freddy and JC? Abby; knocked them out, then nailed them to the roof. CG; (shocked face) what did you do about JC wings. Abby; drilled them into the wood. CG; harsh…what did they do to you. Abby; (glares) annoyed me with the insults and JC said I sucked on Freddy's demon. He involved me for no reason. CG; (shuts mouth) Abby; and Freddy said he heard you screaming JC name, when he raped you last night. CG; (steam forming from her ears) what did you do to him. Abby; that's your job…not mine. CG; review, please, while I attended to some merger issues (grabs kitchen knife) Abby; review, if you want Freddy to live or not…and quickly. Freddy; review please! Abby; how did you hear us.[Chapter 2] CG; Thank you my fellow reviewer 'cetanukawm' I will keep writing this story. I heard from spidergirl about that 'lucky you' fellow all I can say is ignore him and keep doing what you love best. If you have any trouble from him again tell him what u think. SG; like I said in the review, what he said was insulating and un-called for. We would all like to say thx anyway. Abby; thx. JC; thx for reviewing (CG threatened chock him with his own manhood, if he didn't say thx.) Abby; say thx Freddy. Freddy; why should I? Abby; because, if it wasn't for the review you would still be on the roof with CG skinning you alive…slowly. Freddy; grrr. CG; (holds up kitchen knife and drill) do you want to continue. Freddy; (glare) CG; (glare) Freddy; fine (growl) thx for the review. SG; (pats Freddy on the head) good boy. CG; Abby disclaimer. Abby; CG and SG own nothing apart from the story board and OC. Dose not own JC. JC; thank heavens. Freddy; never knew you believed in heaven. Ghost rider; read and review. CG and SG; WHO THE FUCK R U! Chapter 2 Why? Pain, that's all she could feel, agonising, burning pain; needles were being jabbed into her skin, blood samples they were taking. This, this is why she kill humans. She was mistreated…misunderstood, she killed their predators; criminals of their own kind, she killed. 30min of brutal pain, felt like being skinned alive, you can guess how much it hurt but your guesses will still be wrong. I watched the figure scream in agony; her pale face showed nothing but pain, her fanged mouth, splayed in a silent scream; why I say silent…well it fell on deaf ears. Her dark hair, draped over her shoulders. I could feel the pain she went through, you could say they were skinning her alive because that's what it felt like. Torture. She never deserved this! Nobody deserves that kind of pain! They covered her chest and breeding cavity, with clean bandages however, speckles of blood still stained the ends. When the humans left, I approached the girl; she showed no signs of life; you couldn't see her breathing nor her heart beating. No matter how selfish it seems, I wanted to believe she was dead; she was better off 6ft under then a living creature who only knew pain and hatred. I just couldn't wrap that thought around it though, a strong vibe was telling me 'life remains in this specimen' who am I to judge a vibe that tells the truth. The humans came back with a more equipment. I still stand by the girl, and the humans never notice me. \"Doctor, do you think she will survive this virus?\" a female questions. \"She has already survived the titanium liquid, she could survive this. If not it won't matter she's given us more than enough analysis.\" The male replies, grabbing the needle with clear liquid and a few blue speckles. Before the male injects the girl, he places his gloved thumb on her tribal dragon mark. With that action, the girl shoots her eyes open. Her eyes, the colour of mine; amber with flecks of green. The males glare, was no match for the girl's death glare. She grabbed his arm in a bone crushing grip. The male looked at the female, giving her a silent plea, she obeyed. Stupid female. The girl looked at the female, daring her to make a move. As soon as the female turned to the door, the girl grabbed the injection from the male's hand and throw (sorry if it's the wrong word or term) it at the fleeing female, effetely piercing her neck, even stabbing her jugular. The female instantly dropped to the floor. Satisfied with the scene, the girl turned back to the male. A grin plastered her face; human and fanged teeth reviled. The fangs were a few centimetres longer than her human teeth but that's how she feeds and that's what she did. She stabbed her fangs in the male's neck, viciously draining his life. With a snarl, she tore her fangs from his throat; A small trail of blood, leaked from her bloody lips. 12 holes remained in the male's lifeless corpse. She neatly, lade her black/grey and yellow wings on her back; you would think there a tattoo but there not. She hooped off the table and approached the dead female. Her eyes roamed the corpse until they landed on a card. With ease, she tore the card from its chain and slammed it on the monitor. The door lights turned green and the door swished open. The corridor was empty that was until footsteps were heard. A choice had to be made, confront them or run, she did just that, she ran to a room with all the controls. A young male was in the room, but because of it being so dark, he couldn't see what danger lurked in the shadows. She enclosed on her prey and with one move, had him pinned agents the wall. He chocked and grasped her hand, wanting nothing more than to breathe but that wouldn't happen. His other hand reached for the alarm but she saw this and grabbed his wrist, crushing his bone. \"How do I get out?\" she demanded \"I'm not telling shit.\" He sputtered out, clearly not caring about his life. She only smiled at his reply and replaced her hand with the blade of her tail. Giving no warning, she decapitated his head and let his body fall to the ground. A faint smile, crept its way onto her face. \"My name's fatal for a reason. It means death and that's what I bring.\" she spoke, almost a whisper but it was soft like silk but as deadly as a pack of hunting wolves. That was the day I escaped from the containment. My first escape was a fail; I broke the glass to get out but in doing so, set the alarm off. Armed men ran in and started spraying white gas on me. It hurt very badly; parts of my skin, flacked of, my blood was painting the floor. After that incident, I swore on my mother's grave, I will break free. I kept that promise. I snapped my eyes open, my head hurt and my body felt broken. I could hear a song playing. Jeepers creepers where did you get those eyes. Then the music stopped. The male was nowhere in spectrum…or as I thought. Suddenly, the door crashed open and a blood curdling scream echoed throughout the room. 30min, 30min of the victim screaming till all went silent and I don't mean silent when you hear water droplets I mean dead silent. My mind was screaming at me to run but my stomach was growling for food. I wasn't afraid about my surroundings but rather the opposite…curious. I lifted my head and caught the smell of blood. That did it. I was on my feet in no time and stalking the door. When I reached my destination, I peeked inside. My blood froze; there was a dead male with his eyes ripped out, in the middle of the room. I could feel eyes on me and there was. All I could do was stare at the creature; his gaze burring into mine, teeth bared, claws out and a knife in one hand. I could feel my claws forming but I refused to change. He was faster than I thought; he was already an inch away from my face, his hand was coiled around my throat, suffocating me. One minute I'm 3in of the ground the next…I'm slammed on a table and having my wrist chained together, my trench coat gets torn off and now I'm only in my bandages. Thank the angels, he hasn't torn them off as well. He just stares at me. He shouldn't be able to see my scales, my bandages, hair and wings cover them. He dips his head down to my neck and starts…sniffing. I just keep still, resisting the urge to stab him with my tail instead a warning growl, rumbles from the depths of my throat. He lifts his head back up and glares at me then goes back to my neck. I can smell him, but it's not a bad decaying smell that you would expect to find but…quit sweet…clean. Oh god I can see his pulse beating, I could feel my primal urges. Bite him bite him was what my stomach was telling me and I could feel my eyes changing and my fangs extending, ready to bite. I couldn't, instead I closed my eyes and turned my head. He seemed pleased by this act and placed a hand on my stomach. He's warm my, god HE'S WARM. I was trying with all my strength no to slice his hand off, from the sudden contact. Time went on, until he…un-chained me and I was great full. I rolled of the table and ran to the back of the room, away from him not because I was scared but because…I felt something…unfamiliar. He just looked at me and all I could ask was. \"Why?\" he shocked me when he replied. \"Different. Don't show fear. Don't smell right. Different scent.\" He rasped out before he opened these huge bat wings and flew away. Since when did humans have wings? CG; yay, chap2 up for ya (spins around) sorry for misplaced or missing grammar. JC; no, humans don't have wings. CG; (evil glare) I know that dumass. SG; Abby left to go hunt. CG; (feels tears) SG; so I found the ninja turtles (points to the turtles) CG; (squeals) Freddy; great more hybrids (folds arms) Mikey; no, not hybrids mutants. CG; review (sits on JC and hugs him) Everyone including JC; WTF? SG; review before CG dies with knowing what she's doing. Ghost rider; quick! SG; I thought I delt with you before (grabs hose) Donnie; review no flames because we've a lot here.[Chapter 3] SG; OMG thank god you reviewed, CG held a shotgun to her head so I had to knock her out with the frying pan. FREDDY; why didn't you just let her finish the job? SG; (getting angry) Donnie; if she let her finish the job then she wouldn't be able to wright the story. Freddy; so? SG; (getting angrier.) JC; (making the cake.) SG; MICKY DISCLIMER! Micky; owns OC not JC and SG is writing. SG; read review. Enjoy. Chapter 3 \"Different. Don't show fear. Don't smell right. Different scent.\" What did he mean by that, I know I'm a hybrid but how does he know my scent is different everyone has a different scent so why is mine the most different…I'm confused, great the winged man has confused the hybrid well done, round of applause. I just smash my head on the wall \"I hate being confused.\" I growl while fisting the wall with my right hand. To pass time I start singing. Some days, I just wanna up and call it quits. I feel like I'm surrounded by a wall of bricks. Every time I go to get up, I just fall in pits. My life's like, one great big ball of shit. If I could just, put it all into all I spit. Instead of always tryin' to swallow it. Instead of starin' at this wall and shit. While I sit writer's block, sick of all this shit can't call it, shit. All I know is I'm about to hit the wall. If I have to see another one of mom's alcoholic fits. This is it, last straw, that's all that's it. I ain't dealin' with another fuckin politic. I'm like a skillet bubblin' until it filters up. I'm about to kill it, I can feel it buildin' up, I've been sealed enough. My cup, runneth over, I done filled it up. The pen explodes ink spills my guts. You think, all I do is stand here and feel my nuts? Well I'ma show you what, you gon' feel my rush. You don't feel it, then it must be too real to touch. Peal the dutch, I'm about to tear shit up. Goosebumps yea, I'ma make your hair sit up. Year sit up, I'ma tell you who I be. I'ma make you hate me, cause you aint me. You waite, it ain't too late to finally see. What you closed-minded fucks were too blind to see. Whoever finds me is gonna get a finder's fee. Out this world, ain't no one out their mind as me. You need a piece of mind? Here's a piece of mind. All I need's a line. But sometimes I don't always find the words to rhyme, to express how I'm really feelin at that time. Yea sometimes, sometimes, sometimes. Just sometimes, it's always me. How dark can these hallways be? The clock strikes midnight, one, two, then half past three. This half-assed rhyme with this half-assed piece of paper. I'm desperate at my desk, if I can just get the rest of this shit off my chest again. Stuck in this slump, can't think of nothin'. Fuck I'm slumped, but wait, here comes somthin'. Nope, it's not good enough, scribble it out. New pad, crinkle it up, and throw the shit out. I'm fizzling now, thought I figured it out. Ball's in my court, but I'm scared to dribble it out. I'm afraid, but why am I afraid? Why am I a slave to this trade? Cyanide, I spit to the grave. Real enough to rile you up. Want me to flip it, I can rip it any style you want. I'm a switch hitter bitch,Jimmy Smith ain't a quitter. I'ma sit until I get enough in me to finally hit a fuckin boilik point, put some oil in your joints. Flip the coin bitch, come get destroyed. An MC's worst dream, I make 'em tense. They hate me, see me and shake like a chain-link fence. By the looks of 'em, you would swear that jaws was comin'. By the screams of 'em, you would swear I'm sawin someone. By the way they're runnin', you would swear the law was comin'. It's now or never and tonight is all or nothin'. Momma Jimmy keeps leavin on us, he said he'd be back. He pinky promised, I don't think he's honest. I'll be back baby, I just gotta beat this clock. Fuck this clock, I'm make them eat this watch. Don't believe me watch, I'ma win this race. And I'ma come back and rub my shit in your face, bitch. I found my nitch, you gon' hear my voice. 'Til you sick of it, you ain't gonna have a choice. If I go scream 'til I have half a lung. If I had half a chance, I'd grab it- Rabbit-Run By the time I had finished rapping, the wall had a dent and my knuckles were bloody. He hadn't returned yet which spared me time. I chose my option wisely, his fresh victim was what I needed and the only fresh victim would be the naked blind man. I could feel my fangs growing and my eyes changing, primal instincts were taking over and this time I listened. I crawled to my waiting victim, with little strength I had. In no more than a split second, I had my jaws latched on his throat; blood pouring into my mouth, cold and partly fresh, it was ether this or dying slowly and painfully; the creature inside would growl, scratch, roar and snap. This world will never be safe unless I confront this demon myself…but I can't…she's inside me…I can see her, it's hard to make out but I can see her red eyes and the dragon mark. When I finished I sensed disturbance, he's back. With the speed of a striking rattlesnake, I make a run to the corner. I wasn't scared but just…uncomfortable with his presence; having spent many years behind glass. Having human males spray your cell with knock out gas then take your unconscious body for samples and a whole world of pain. Feel like you're being skinned alive, that's only the beginning imagine the ending. You can't guess because it never ends every pain I felt was only the beginning of something worse. My chamber was no safe place. The 2in glass couldn't hold the threat the outside world had to give. The iron walls couldn't mute my victims dying screams; the glass was always stained with their life. My cell was never safe, not for me, not for anyone. My chamber was always dark; the darkness was my ally, kept me hidden, in my eyes kept me safe. Darkness was my only friend. When they created me, they thought they had control over me, they were wishing death. They had to be, I take no responsibility for my actions, it's their fault I'm as savage as I am now. They put their citizens in grave danger. Try living my life, then you'll know how uncomfortable it is being around strangers…especially men. He came in and just stared at me; my body was huddled into the corner, my legs were brought into my chest and my arms were tucked inward. My eyes just locked with his. I gave off no scent of fear but just stared. He stalked over to me, before he could reach me the bag moved, his victim was still alive. He turned his head and faced the bag, then left. I wanted to see who this survivor was. When I approached the bag I caught the scent of a female. My claws shredded at the bag until a face perked out. Before I could stop myself, a vicious growl ripped from my throat. This was the female that I thought I could trust and instead, she led me into an ambush. \"you.\" I growled with venom. \"Specimen four.\" Her words came out with shock and I wouldn't blame her, this is the first time she has ever heard me speck. \"Please help.\" \"Help yourself.\" I couldn't believe she asked for me to help after what she did. I dismissed her rotting body and left her for dead. If he found her then it must mean that the men are close by, I would have to protect myself and the creature. Why do I care? JC; made the cake. CG; (semi-awake.) EVERYONE; HAPPY BIRTHDAY CG. CG; thanks (faints.) SG; lol.[Chapter 4] SG: hey, thank you my lovely reviews, I'm sorry this chapter is short but next Friday we're breaking up and I don't know when we're coming back so I wanted to get in this sneaky chapter. If you was wondering what the song was in the last chapter it was (whispers) Eminem. Freddy: why did you whisper emi- SG: (slaps a hand on Freddy's gob.) don't say that word and never say you diss or hate that word. Freddy; (smirks) SG: (glares) Freddy; (shouts) SG hates emine-! SG; (whacks Freddy out with a baseball bat.) JC: what happened to the frying pan? SG: It got a massive dent from CG's head. JC: so why is Freddy out cold? Leo: because he said something about emi- SG; (whacks Leo out with the bat.) JC: emin- SG: (ready to swing.) JC: ok. So why can't we say that word. SG: (shout) Because CG goes into a massive lifelong lecture that time can't even count. I'm tempted to say I hate Eminem! JC; (blank look.) SG; I just said that out loud. JC: (nods) CG (shouts) you what! SG and JC: (gulps) SG: JC disclaimer. JC: owns hybrid not me. SG: you guys review while I go find someone to blame. Chapter 4 Voices and a secret out. I listened to the creature gouge on his victim while drawing my next picture, my picture reposents the feeling that are clouding my entire form. I could feel my wings getting sour for bonding with my skin for so long. The creature came out of the room and started sniffing, I did as well. My eyes turned to slits when I caught the scent of humans. 'Humans,' I thought. The creature whipped his head towards me. 'How can you smell them?' I heard him think. My eyes shot up with surprise. 'How can you hear my thoughts?' I asked. 'I have been able to do it for a long time, how are you able to?' he growled. I shut off my mind communication and opened my mouth but then shut it, as I felt my fangs flex backwards, why is this happening? \"I am going to hunt. You stay.\" He commended me. With that his wings opened and he flew off. I watched him leave. When I was sure he wasn't in range, I walked outside to see my problem. It was a full moon. I went back inside and waited and stared at the remains of the human's body, wondering, remembering. My blood was leaking fresh, and my vision was blurry. I stayed in human form, not wanting to give my real form away. No birds sang and no crickets clicked. I heard someone approaching. Going by instincts, I jumped and grabbed a tree branch. A lonely female human appeared from the shadows. I jumped down behind her. She spun on her heals when I made my location known. I stopped thinking about that time when I heard a voice's. \"Jack, what are we doing here?\" I heard. The humans were here. With lethal silence, I crept to the corner of the room. The humans came in, their lights checking the perimeter. There were at least 17 humans. I hissed and drawn in my first human. My tail rammed in her body. She stuttered then went silent. I could hear the creeper returning. My wings opened and my horns broke from my skin. The humans were shooting their weapons but I was already climbing to the roof. Once on, I could see an air craft. I growled and ran to the air craft. Once in distance, I jumped and grabbed a hold on the screen. I hopped I could smash the screen but a bullet went through my leg, and I lost my grip. When I was about to fall, I saw a shadow. My body started turning human. I felt my body being caught. I looked up through half lidded eyes, it was the creeper, and he was carrying me. My body was so weak. I allowed my eyes to close. I trusted him. When I woke I was still in his arms, his wings were wrapped around us. I pushed his wings away so I could see where we was, it was the forest. I heard a growl behind me but I never wanted to look. My secret had finally been reviled. 'What are you?' that was a question that demanded an answer. I didn't want to answer at first but his wings wrapped around me again and the hand on the back of his neck told me to confess. \"I don't know what I am.\" I told the truth. A sharp pain came in my chest making me gasp; the pain felt being stabbed with a knife and it slowly turning. \"Please, let me out.\" I begged. My tail started to appear and my wings started to break out. He still didn't move so I shoved his wings open and lunched out. \"change.\" I heard in my head. \"What did you say?\" I asked the creature. \"I didn't say anything.\" The creature replied. He started to stand. \"Change.\" It was that voice again, it was demanding me to change and my body followed the demand. \"I'm sorry.\" Was my last sentence. I let the pain consume me, my wings broke out of their prison, my tail and horns did the same. My secret was now out in the open. I stared into his eyes, I could only identify two emotions; confusion and rage, and does he know what I am? \"Well done.\" The voice spoke. SG: this is the last chapter I am doing until we come back to school. JC: so, how did you get out, alive? SG: (smirks.) I got Freddy to take the blame. JC: how? SG: told CG that Freddy said it and CG MADE Freddy listen. JC: how? SG: you know how CG works, she said she would chop off the thing between the legs and grill it put some vinegar on it and force feed it to him. JC: didn't know he had one. SG: me neither, but he must have one for CG to threaten to chop it off. Freddy: (stumbles down the stairs holding an ice pack at his lower region.) SG: so she didn't chop it off? Freddy: no, she put a lighter to it. SG: (winces.) Knock at the door SG: the door is open Noob saibot, Scorpion and Ermac walks in. CG; yea, it's the MK people. SG: I'm in love. Freddy: oh, Crap, her hormones are at it again. SG: (knocks Freddy out.) don't say anything about MY hormones. ","Summary":" centipedegirl: yo what up, this is are JC story.

I'm finally getting started on the sequel. Sorry about the long wait, I just ended up working on too many fanfictions at the same time and the original document that I had started making notes in for my plans for the sequel disappeared when I got a new computer, so I had to start over. Honestly if I didn't still get fairly regular reviews asking for the sequel I may have just given up on it, but since so many people wanted to see a sequel here it is. I can't guarantee that updates will be very regular, certainly not as quick as with the first story because the first story was nearly finished when I started posting it and this one all I have written is this first chapter and I still have more fanfictions started than I can remember, so updates will be based on when I feel inspired to work on it and the number of reviews I get on it, most of the time reviews motivate me and help me decide which stories I work on first. After dropping the people off at the hospital William had Maggie drive, stopping at a couple of fast food restaurants on the way home, \"You know this stuff is very unhealthy?\" Maggie asked. \"It's the first time I've been able to eat anything other than humans in over two hundred years, I couldn't care less how healthy it is. Anyways there's so many new foods for me to try that weren't around before I was cursed, I want to try them all at least once.\" William told her. \"Alright, I just don't want you to end up sick from all the greasy food that you're body isn't use too.\" Maggie said. \"I'm sure I'll be fine.\" William replied before digging into the cheese burger and fries Maggie had just gotten him. \"Well you enjoy that, I'm going to go get us some real food.\" Maggie said as she pulled up in front of a grocery store, \"Just try not to scare anyone.\" she said before getting out of the truck. By the time they got back to the cave it was late evening and Maggie had fallen asleep in the passenger seat after William had offered to drive when she had finished with their last stop before heading home. \"You know I can get myself inside.\" Maggie said when she started to wake up when William picked her up and started to carry her inside. \"Of course I do, but after all the running you've done to get food and stuff today it's the least I can do.\" William told her. \"Okay.\" Maggie said laying her head on his shoulder. The next morning Maggie woke up to find William laying behind her with his arms and wings wrapped around her. For a moment she had to fight back tears of relief and joy as she realized how close she had come to losing him. After a moment she turned to face him, doing her best to act serious as he woke up and she asked, \"What do you think you're doing?\" \"I- well-\" William stuttered as he quickly let go of her as well as he could considering one of his one wing was still underneath her. \"You know, I put up with the occasional wing being draped over me when I wake up and that I could believe was an accident, but there's no way I'm going to believe that you accidentally wrapped both arms and wings around me in your sleep.\" Maggie said trying not to grin at the nervous look on his face, \"Now you're going to have to deal with the consequences.\" she told him then, after hesitating a moment to drag out his suffering just a little, she wrapped her arms around him and kissed him. When they finally stopped kissing William smiled at her, \"Well if that's the consequence for holding you while you sleep I think I'll have to start doing it more often.\" \"Good, because I could definitely get us to waking up like that.\" Maggie told him then slipped out of his wings when the alarm on her iPod started to go off. \"What's that for?\" William asked. \"I called Jen while we were out yesterday and told her it was safe to come home and she was able to get a flight back this morning. I told her I'd pick her up at the airport.\" Maggie told him as she got out of bed, \"I think you should probably take me back to my place so I can take my own car to get her, your truck was getting some concerned looks when we did the shopping yesterday.\" When Maggie got to the airport Jen's plane was just landing. As soon as Jen stepped off the plane and spotted Maggie she ran over to her and hugged her, \"I've been so worried about you, I was so afraid I was going to come home to find out you had been killed.\" she told her. \"William would never hurt me, didn't you read my report that I emailed you?\" Maggie asked. \"Yeah, it's just kind of hard to believe something that was going to kill and eat me wouldn't hurt you.\" Jen said as they got her bags. \"I know, but that wasn't his fault, it was the curse, he had no control over what he was doing. When the curse isn't controlling him he's really a great guy.\" Maggie told her as they loaded the suitcase into her trunk, \"I really need you to accept that it was the curse that forced him to attack you and forgive him for it.\" \"Why? Does it really matter now that he's gone for another twenty-three years.\" Jen asked as they got into the car. \"He's not gone.\" Maggie said. \"But you said-\" \"That it was safe for you to come home, not that he was hibernating for another twenty-three years. That won't be happening again and he won't be killing anyone again either.\" Maggie said. \"Wait a minute, you mean the curse was broken? How?\" Jen asked. \"It's not exactly broken yet, more put on hold, there's sort of a couple of steps to breaking it, step one stops it, step two actually breaks it.\" Maggie told her. \"So how was broken, stopped, whatever?\" Jen asked. Maggie smiled a little nervously, mentally praying that Jen would handle it well then said, \"It was sort of a Beauty and the Beast thing.\" \"Whoa, you mean you're in love that thing?\" Jen asked. \"Like I said, when the curse isn't in control he's a great guy.\" Maggie told her. \"Okay, I guess you're right, if he's going to be your boyfriend I guess I do need to forgive him for what the curse made him do.\" Jen said. \"Actually, unofficially I think he's more my fiancé, that's the second part of the curse, we have twenty-three weeks to get married or he get's stuck hibernating again and the curse won't be broken.\" Maggie told her. \"Wow, you met him less than a month ago and have to marry him in less than six months?\" Jen asked. \"Yeah, I know I always said you should know someone at least a year before getting married, but that's not exactly an option.\" Maggie said. \"Are you scared about all this happening so fast?\" Jen asked. \"No.\" Maggie replied, then added, \"Maybe nervous, but not scared, I'm sure I'm going to be happy with him, but I don't even graduate from collage for a couple more months. I never thought I'd have to worry about getting married until at least a year or two after collage. So, yeah, nervous, but not scared. I don't even know what he really looks like and won't find out until after we're married.\" \"At least anything would have to be an improvement over what he looks like now.\" Jen said. \"True.\" Maggie agreed, \"You'll help me figure out what I'm going to do for a wedding and be my maid of honor, right?\" she asked. \"Of course, although a traditional wedding is probably out of the question.\" Jen said. \"Yeah, I don't really know what exactly we're going to do for a wedding, we haven't really had time to discus it yet.\" Maggie told her. \"So does your mother know about any of this yet?\" Jen asked. \"No, last time I contacted her, I told her I needed a break and was leaving for a month, she doesn't even know about William taking me.\" Maggie replied. \"How do you think she's going to handle everything once she does find out?\" Jen asked. \"I really don't know, she's always been pretty accepting of my interest in mythical and legendary creatures, but I'm not sure how she'll react when she finds out I'm marrying one. I think I'll start by emailing her a copy of my report, let her read it and then use that as a way to bring up everything that's happened with William and I. That should work better than trying to explain to her that he's not evil after she finds out about us.\" Maggie said. \"Sounds like a good plan to me. Do you want me to be there when you tell her?\" Jen asked. \"Yes, I'm sure having someone there who was nearly killed while he was being controlled by the curse, to tell her he's really not that bad would help. Of course that means you have to actually meet him and believe what you're telling her or she won't believe you.\" Maggie told her. \"Oh yeah, I forgot about having to actually meet him.\" Jen said sounding a little uncertain. \"Don't worry, he may look scary, but he's harmless now.\" Maggie told her, \"How about a picnic tomorrow? The weather is supposed to be perfect, that way you don't have to go back into the cave to meet him.\" \"I guess that would work.\" Jen replied as they pulled up to her apartment and they carried her bags in then visited some more for a while.[Chapter 2] Sorry about the long wait, my mom's health has really been deteriorating over the last year causing a lot of stress, I've actually gone months at a time without writing anything and I have so many stories I'm working on both fanfictions and a few original ones that I just can't seem to keep everything updated regularly. But a nice relaxing weekend staying with my grandparents got me writing again, so here's the next chapter. The next morning Maggie returned to the cave after a quick shopping trip and set a couple of bags on the desk where William was sitting. \"What's this?\" he asked. \"An attempt to make you look a little less scary for our picnic with Jen,\" Maggie told him, \"Hopefully they're the right size,\" she added as she pulled out a pair of blue jeans, a belt and an obnoxiously bright florescent pink Hawaiian shirt with equally bright yellow and orange flowers on it. William looked at her like she was crazy, \"You seriously don't expect me to wear that shirt do you?\" he asked. \"What? It'll need a little modification for your wings, but I thought it was pretty,\" Maggie said acting hurt that he didn't seem to like it. \"But-\" William started then hesitated looking torn between telling her what he thought of the shirt or not saying anything to avoid hurting her feelings. \"I figured the shirt is so horrifying and you're so horrifying looking that if you wear it, it'll just look too funny for you or the shirt to look so bad,\" she said then grinned, \"Although if you really don't like it, you could always just wear this,\" she said, pulling a black, long sleeved, button front shirt out of the bag. \"You are evil, you know that?\" William asked. \"But it was so worth the look on your face. Anyways it was marked down to fifty cents and I swear everyone working at the second hand shop let out a sigh of relief when they realized someone was actually going to get it out of there,\" Maggie told him, \"I stopped at home and washed everything so you go ahead and get dressed, I'll go pick up Jen and meet you at the house in a little while,\" she said before leaving. \"So are you ready to go meet my fiancé?\" Maggie asked when she got to Jen's house to pick her up. \"No, but I don't think I ever will be, so let's just get this over with,\" Jen replied. \"He really is harmless now. You know that horrible Hawaiian shirt that's been on the sale rack at the second hand shop for the last five months?\" Maggie asked as they got into her car. \"Yeah.\" \"I bought it for him and I think he was actually going to wear it just to avoid hurting my feelings,\" Maggie told her. \"Oh my gosh, that would have been hilarious to see.\" Jen said laughing at the idea, \"You're right, if he was going to wear that just to make you happy, he can't be that bad and he has to be either insane or insanely in love with you.\" \"And he was so cute when he was sitting there trying to figure out whether or not to tell me what he really thought of it,\" Maggie said. \"The Creeper, look cute? Is that even possible?\" Jen asked. \"It is, I never would have believed it was possible if I hadn't seen it myself, but he just looked so unsure and confused about how to react that there's just no other way to describe it than adorably cute,\" Maggie replied. A little while later they pulled off the road at the edge of a large forest, \"Where exactly are we having this picnic?\" Jen asked. \"At my new house, granted it'll need a bit of modernizing, but it was built by William's grandfather. I'm still doing some research, but so far I think the state owns the land since as far as anyone knew there were no relatives to claim it. We'll probably have to buy it back since I doubt they'll accept a two hundred year old claim to the land, but hopefully that will be easier than it would have been if the property had been split up and sold to different people and we had to deal with regular owners,\" Maggie told her as she led her through the woods. \"It certainly looks like your type of place, middle of nowhere and no neighbors for miles,\" Jen said then fell silent as they stepped into a small clearing. The house sat at one side of the clearing and at the other side a blanket was spread out under a large tree and William was getting their picnic set up. \"It's alright, he doesn't bite, not anymore,\" Maggie said as Jen grabbed her hand in a death grip. \"I'm really sorry about attacking you, I really had no control over it and I would never hurt you now that the curse can't control me,\" William told her. \"I know, I'm just having a hard time making part of myself believe it,\" Jen replied sounding on the verge of panicking. \"You had better be right about this,\" William said to Maggie. Before she could ask what he was talking about he started to unbutton the loose fitting black shirt. \"Oh dear lord,\" Jen managed to get out as both girls clamped a hand over their mouths and she let out muffled snort of laughter as he took off the black shirt to reveal that he was wearing the Hawaiian shirt under it. They finally gave up their attempts at controlling themselves and started laughing so hard they had to lean against each other to avoid falling to the ground. William just sat down, leaning back against the tree and said, \"When you to are done, lunch is ready.\" After taking a moment to compose themselves Maggie and Jen joined him, Jen sitting as far away from William as possible and looking nervous, but still cracking a smile every time she looked at his shirt. Maggie sat down next to him, kissing his cheek and saying, \"You're the best, I guess I was right about the shirt, now I just wish I had my camera with me.\" \"It's already embarrassing enough having to wear this thing, there's no way I'd let you get any evidence to prove that I wore it,\" William told her. \"Even if I begged you to let me take a picture?\" Maggie asked. \"Even if you begged and promised to marry me today so I could escape the curse and get back to looking normal,\" he replied. \"Oh well, and it would have made such great blackmail,\" she said. The rest of the day they spent visiting and showing Jen the house and property. Luckily by the end of the day Jen had warmed up to him and had pretty well gotten over her fear of him. \"So you going to come with me when I tell my mom about him?\" Maggie asked as she drove Jen home. \"Yeah, I think I'll be fine to do that. I guess you were right, he doesn't seem so bad when he's not trying to eat you and wearing that shirt,\" Jen said grinning, \"Oh by the way, I got you something.\" \"What?\" Maggie asked as she pulled into the driveway at Jen's house. Jen pulled out her cell phone, \"Well you know this thing just happens to have a camera on it,\" she said as she brought up a picture of William and Maggie, \"He was distracted talking to you about something and I just couldn't resist making sure we got a picture of him in that shirt. Maggie grinned, \"You are the best, you'll email a copy of that right?\" \"Of course. You don't think he'll be mad though, do you?\" Jen asked a little nervously. \"No, I won't even let him know I have it right away and by the time he does find out I have it I'm sure we'll all get a good laugh out of it,\" Maggie told her then asked, \"Are you free on Sunday? Mom want's me to come over for dinner and I thought that would be a good time to tell her about William.\" \"Yep, that should work out fine,\" Jen told her.[Chapter 3] \"Are you sure this is a good idea? Maybe we should wait until after we're married and I look human again,\" William said as they got ready to meet Maggie's mom that Sunday. \"I don't think that would be any better, telling her you more or less kidnapped me and now we're getting married is bad enough, but to tell her that we already got married and didn't invite her to the wedding, I think that would be worse,\" Maggie told him then added, \"plus if we tell her now at least if she freaks out and does anything drastic you still can't be killed.\" Williams face went a few shades paler before he asked, \"Do you really think she'd try to kill me?\" \"No,\" Maggie told him then smiled, \"but you are just so cute when you're scared and nervous,\" she said as she placed a broad rimmed hat on his head and kissed his cheek, \"Well I think we're done, you look as human as possible. We'll go in and give her some time to get to know before we tell her who you are,\" she said stepping back to look at him. He was covered from head to toe, wearing leather boots that he had made himself that fit over his less than human shaped feet, the pants and shirt Maggie had gotten him, with the collar flipped up to help hide his face a little more, a long coat that concealed his wings, black leather gloves and finally the hat which, if it was kept pulled down in the front would hide his face as long as no one got too close to him. \"Are you sure this is going to work? What if she wants me to take my hat off once we're inside?\" he asked. \"Don't worry, she won't say anything about it, at least not to you,\" Maggie assured him, \"Now let's go get Jen and get this over with.\" Half an hour later they pulled up the driveway to a small white house with green shutters and a large flower bed that wrapped around the house. \"Maybe this was a bad idea, maybe you should just tell her about me and then introduce us later,\" William said looking nervously at the house. Jen laughed, \"Even the big terrifying Creeper is afraid of meeting his future mother in law.\" \"Most men have to worry about their mother in laws not liking them, I know she's not going to like me. I'm a monster who has killed thousands of people and kidnapped and held her daughter prisoner for the last month, there's no reason for her not to hate me,\" William said. \"Except that I love you and she knows how picky I am about guys, the very fact that I love you should, hopefully, be enough to convince her to give you a chance and once she get's to know you I'm sure she'll like you,\" Maggie told him before getting out of the car. Maggie made it as far as the front porch steps before she started to feel nervous and hesitated, \"Okay maybe you guys should wait around the corner and let me make sure she read the report I emailed her, it was pretty long and has only been a couple days and if she hasn't read it it'll make this more difficult if we have to explain everything.\" \"That sounds good to me,\" William said. \"Of course it does, you coward,\" Jen said to him, \"But you're right, this would be easier if she already knew the basics of what was going on,\" she agreed then she and William stepped out of site around the corner of the porch. Taking a deep breath Maggie knocked on the door and a moment later her mother, Anna, answered the door, \"So where have you been for the past month? You've never just run off without any warning like that before. What did you do, run off with that Creeper thing?\" she asked. Maggie stared at her, too shocked by her question to come up with a coherent response, after a few seconds she finally asked, \"Why on earth would you think that?\" \"That story you sent me, the parts about before he became the Creeper, the way you described him was pretty much exactly the type of guy you've always talked about wanting to find. You said you wrote it for school, didn't you?\" Anna asked. \"Yes,\" Maggie replied. \"I didn't know you were taking any fiction writing classes this semester. Why use the Creeper as a character that you pretty much turned into Mr. Right?\" \"I-I can't believe I didn't realize that,\" Maggie said thinking over everything William had told her that she had included in the report. \"Realize what?\" Anna asked. \"That the whole time I was writing that, I was describing the man of my dreams and never realized it,\" Maggie replied. \"Seriously, you didn't notice that? How could you have created a character like that and not noticed it?\" Maggie took a deep breath then said, \"I don't know, maybe because I didn't create him, I just wrote about him. Mom, it's not fiction, everything in that report is true.\" \"How could you have possibly learned that much about the Creeper? I was pregnant with you last time it was out and no one knew anything about it, even when they tried to research it all they could ever find were a few vague local legends. Nothing that went anywhere near into the detail of his life as you wrote,\" Anna said. \"Well, you were kind of right,\" Maggie said hesitantly. \"Right about what?\" Anna asked. \"Where I was for the past month,\" Maggie replied. Realization crossed Anna's face and she seemed to take a second to process the information before she said, \"You're the one that monster kidnapped this time?\" \"When did he go from being Mr. Right to a monster?\" Maggie demanded a little more angrily than she had intended. Anna stared at her in shock for a second then said, \"You're in love with it, him.\" Maggie smiled slightly, \"Yeah, and it turns out that's all it took to sort of break the curse.\" \"Sort of?\" Anna asked. \"Well, turns out in real life turning the beast back into prince charming is a little more complicated than in fairy tales. It's fine though, the only hold the curse has on him now is that he still can't change his appearance, but he no longer has to hurt anyone or anything like that.\" \"And what does more complicated mean?\" \"It means we have a wedding to plan,\" Maggie told her. \"You're going to marry that thing?\" Anna asked. \"You mean, Mr. Right? Of course I am, come on you're the one who said, what I wrote about him he's exactly what I've always been looking for in a guy,\" Maggie pointed out. \"Except for the murdering and eating people part,\" Anne countered. \"That wasn't his fault, it was the curse,\" Maggie told her. \"What about the first group of people he killed, wasn't he cursed because he killed them? No one forced him to murder them,\" Anna argued. \"He only killed the people who had killed his family, you read what they did to his family, they killed them all, even an innocent two year old child. Can you honestly say if someone killed your entire family and the only way to get justice for them was to go after the people yourself, that you wouldn't do it?\" Anna hesitated a moment then said, \"I don't know.\" \"So how can you hold against him something that you might have done yourself if put in the same situation?\" Maggie asked, \"Just give him a chance, please. Because like it or not, I love him and I'm going to marry him.\" \"Fine,\" Anna relented. \"Good, so you ready to meet him?\" Maggie asked. \"What? Now?\" Anna asked. \"I did tell you was going to bring a couple guests with me to lunch,\" Maggie said. \"I thought you said you were bringing Jen,\" Anna said. \"I did, I just never said she was the only one I was bringing,\" Maggie told her. \"Don't worry,\" Jen said coming around the corner of the porch, \"Once you get to know him he's not as scary as he looks.\" \"You knew about this?\" Anna asked. \"Yeah, he kind of tried to eat me, Maggie was there and rescued me. So now I'm here to help convince you that he's really not that bad now that the curse isn't forcing him to kill people. It's true, he really isn't that bad and he'd do anything to make Maggie happy, even it means embarrassing himself,\" Jen said grinning as she leaned in and whispered, \"Remind me later to show you the pictures of him from when Maggie was trying to convince me he was harmless.\" \"He tried to eat you and now you really think he's harmless?\" Anna asked skeptically. \"Yep, so how about giving him a chance? Trust me he's more afraid of you than you are of him,\" Jen told her. \"Right, I'm sure this thing that has killed countless people is going to be afraid of me,\" Anna said sarcastically. \"Take it from the person who has been stuck waiting with him while you two were talking, he's terrified, he comes from a time where if the brides parents didn't approve of a match they could keep their daughter from marrying who she wanted to. It's kind of pathetic really, seeing this big scary monster so nervous and jittery about meeting his future mother in law,\" Jen said. \"Stop picking on him, he's not pathetic and he may look like a monster, but he's really just a normal guy who, like most men is nervous about meeting his future mother in law. So be nice, both of you,\" Maggie told them before heading around the corner of the porch where William was pacing back and forth nervously. \"Well I guess we didn't need to go through all the trouble of trying to make you look human,\" Maggie said. \"She knows? How much?\" William asked. \"Pretty much everything. Come on, it'll be alright,\" Maggie said taking his arm and leading him around to the front porch. Although William and Anna were both clearly nervous around each other they slowly relaxed and lunch went well. After lunch they moved into the living room to visit more and William sat down in a reclining chair. \"Is this a chair or a bed? It's shaped like a chair, but it's as soft as a bed,\" William said. \"You've never sat in a recliner before?\" Anna asked. \"Only being awake for twenty three days every twenty three years doesn't leave much time for catching up on all the changes in the world,\" William replied, \"Why is it called a recliner?\" \"Because it does this,\" Maggie said pulling the lever on the side to raise the foot rest. \"We have got to get one of these,\" William said leaning back. \"It won't fit it in very well with all that antique furniture you have,\" Maggie said as she started to untie the laces on his shoes. \"Who cares how it looks,\" he replied then asked, \"What are you doing?\" \"You've been twitching a fidgeting your feet for an hour, I'm getting these shoes off of you before they drive you crazy,\" Maggie replied. \"Are you sure that's a good idea?\" he said. \"Of course, I'm sure,\" she said turning her attention to Anna, \"He's not use to wearing shoes for very long, but he's afraid the big scary claws on his feet will bother you, but they won't, right?\" \"If I can handle those teeth I'm sure I can handle seeing claws,\" Anna replied, although her eyes widened slightly as Maggie pulled his shoe off. A while later Anna, Maggie and Jen were still talking when Jen nudged Maggie's shoulder, \"Now I have to admit, that's almost kind of cute,\" she said motioning to William who had fallen asleep in the chair, with Anna's white cat curled up on his chest. \"See mom, Snowflake likes him, and you always said you trusted the judgment of kids and animals,\" Maggie said. \"I guess he seems okay, still those teeth and claws, he just looks so scary,\" Anna said. Maggie suddenly grinned, \"Can't do anything about the teeth, but maybe we can do something about the claws.\" \"Take a chain saw to them? Because I don't think nail clippers are going to work on those things,\" Jen said. \"I was thinking more along the lines of making them not look as scary,\" Maggie told her, \"Do you still carry nail polish around in your purse?\" \"Oh you are evil,\" Jen said grinning as she grabbed her purse and started digging through it then a second later pulled out a bottle of florescent pink and a bottle of bright green nail polish. \"You can't be serious, what if you make him mad?\" Anna asked. \"He won't care as long as he knows it was Maggie's idea, anyways he looks good in bright colors,\" Jen said pulling out her cell phone and bringing up the picture of William in the Hawaiian shirt, \"Like I said, he'd do anything for her,\" she told her before she and Maggie set to work on William's claws. An hour or so later Anna, Jen and Maggie were in the kitchen making dinner when William walked in and just stared hard at Maggie, his arms crossed and his claws tapping against the tile floor. \"Did you have a nice nap?\" Maggie asked walking over to him, kissing his cheek and smiling at him as she started to take a step back. In a lighting fast move his wings tore out of his coat and wrapped around her, pulling her closer and into his arms as they closed around both of them, almost forming a cocoon around them, \"You think you can paint my claws like that and get away with just a kiss on the cheek?\" he asked quietly. Maggie slipped her arms around his neck and kissed him passionately, when she pulled away she smiled up at him, \"Better?\" \"Much better,\" he said kissing her one more time before letting her go and folding his wings to his back. \"What was that?\" Anna asked. \"That was one of the benefits of a guy with wings, built in privacy screens for spur of the moment making out,\" Maggie replied as she went back to preparing dinner. They were just getting ready to leave that evening when they heard the neighbor's dog started barking, \"Maybe you should stay a little longer,\" Anna said, a hint of nervousness edging into her voice. \"Why, what's wrong?\" Maggie asked. \"There have just been a few break-ins in the area the last couple of weeks, and-\" she was cut off by the sound of breaking glass that sounded like it came from the detached garage. \"Oh my gosh, we've got to call the police,\" Anna said nearly panicking. \"I have a better idea, stay inside and lock the doors,\" William said smiling before sneaking off the porch. \"What's he going to do?\" Anna asked as she locked the door. \"I don't know, but we can see the garage from the window in my old room,\" Maggie said before heading upstairs. They watched from the window as a flashlight flickered through the windows of the garage and William jumped up onto the roof of the garage, slipping silently across it to wait just above the door. A moment later a man stepped out the door carrying something then screamed and dropped it as William dropped down in front of him. The man took off running, but with a single flap of his wings William landed in front of the man and he changed direction to try to escape, but each time he did William would let him get a little ways a way before landing in front of him again. That went on for about a minute before Maggie noticed movement near the garage and realized there was a second man trying to sneak away. Maggie opened the window then called, \"When you're done playing with that one there's another one trying to sneak away from the garage.\" William landed in front of the first man one more time, catching him by the leg and giving it a sharp twist, breaking it before going after the second man and starting up another game of cat and mouse with him. \"He does like to play with his food doesn't he? This is just like the night he attacked the bus and took me, only he doesn't have as many people to terrorize or as many places to jump out from,\" Jen said. \"Yeah, but they're not food this time and these guys deserve to be terrorized a little,\" Maggie said then froze when she heard a click behind her and something press into the back of her head. \"You're helping that monster!\" a man said angrily. Maggie and the other two turned slowly to face the man. \"If you're helping him, that mean he'd want to keep you alive?\" the man asked. \"It means threatening me would be the biggest mistake you could make, so why don't you make a run for it while you've still got the chance,\" Maggie replied. \"I think I'd rather have a little something to keep that thing from attacking me while I leave,\" he said grabbing Maggie and shoving her in front of him with the gun still pointed at her head. \"You're making a big mistake,\" Maggie said as he forced her down the stairs and out the door. They barely made it half way to the road before William landed in front of them, \"Let her go,\" he practically growled. \"Stay back, or I'll kill her.\" the man said. \"I'm sure you would, you've killed before,\" William said. That sent a chill of fear down Maggie's spine, she had hoped that the man was just a petty thief who wouldn't actually be able to go as far as killing anyone, but if he had killed before that made the whole situation more dangerous. \"How'd you know that? Never mind, just let me leave and I'll dump her somewhere when I'm a safe distance away,\" the man said. \"You think he's just going to let a murderer go free and trust you not to hurt me?\" Maggie asked. \"I've only killed half a dozen people, if the stories are true this monster has killed hundreds if not thousands. Anyways why should it care what I do to you?\" Maggie smiled subtly at William and once she was sure he had seen, she replied, \"Because I'm going to marry him.\" The man's grip loosened slightly on her in shock, \"You're going to marry that monster?\" he asked in disgusted shock, pointing towards William with the hand that had the gun in it. In an instant Maggie stomped on his foot, loosening his grip on her even more and William lunged forward, grabbing the gun and wrenching out of the mans hand while Maggie darted several feet away. The man stumbled back then reached behind his back and pulled out another gun, \"I heard you can't be killed,\" he said aiming the gun at William, \"but I bet she can,\" he added as he swung the gun to aim at Maggie and fired. Maggie cried out as pain shot through her shoulder, but she was quickly distracted from that when William let out an inhuman roar and darted towards the man. He grabbed the man's arm that held the gun and in one swift movement tore his arm clear off. Then threw the man half way across the yard, where he was stopped as he slammed into a tree with a sickening cracking of bones and dropped to the ground moaning. \"Are you alright, other than your arm?\" William asked kneeling next to Maggie and tearing the sleeve of her shirt off where she had been shot. \"I'm fine, how bad is my arm?\" Maggie asked. \"It's not bad, the bullet just grazed you, probably won't take more than half a dozen stitches,\" he told her as he applied pressure to the wound. \"Maggie, Maggie are you alright?!\" Anna called franticly as she and Jen ran across the yard towards them. \"I'm fine, thanks to William,\" Maggie replied. \"Thanks to him? If he hadn't been playing with those other men like some type of demented animal the third man probably wouldn't have had a chance to get near you!\" Anna said angrily. \"Mom! What do you think would have happened to us if those men had broken into the house and William wasn't here?\" Maggie demanded. Anna ignored Maggie and told William, \"The police are on their way, if you don't want them to get a hold of you, you need to leave, now.\" As William started to stand up Maggie grabbed his arm and he said, \"It's alright, I'll come back for you after the police leave,\" then he took off into the air. \"How could you be so mean, after he just saved our lives?\" Maggie asked angrily. \"Did you see him toying with those men? Or rip the arm off of that other man? You say this curse will be broken and he won't look like a monster, but you said it already isn't controlling how he behaves. He could have just caught those men and ended it, but he chose to torment them instead. And was it really necessary to rip that man's arm off?\" Anna asked. \"Well maybe he was more concerned about making sure the guy didn't get another chance to shoot me, than about being gentle when he was getting the gun away from him,\" Maggie countered before heading towards the house. When the police arrived they told them as little as possible, only that they had heard the people breaking in and looked out in time to see the creeper attacking the first man. Maggie had bandaged her arm well enough to conceal that it was injured, so they wouldn't have to explain it and the man who had shot her bled to death before the police arrived so there was no one to say anything about Maggie interacting with William. Calling his attention to the second man was easily enough explained by them simply not wanting the other man to get away and potentially break into the house and find them. After getting their statements the officer said, \"I don't know what you saw tonight, maybe someone in a costume, but it couldn't have been the Creeper. It's been over twenty-three days since the first sighting and it's been days since the last sighting. Not to mention nothing from these men was taken.\" \"Maybe someone in the neighbor hood got tired of the robberies and decided to do something about it,\" Maggie suggested, more than happy to throw the focus off of William. \"That's entirely possible,\" the officer replied. \"I don't think so, unless we've got a group of people running around dressed up like the Creeper,\" another officer said walking up to them, \"We just got notice from the city police in the next county over, got a couple reports from downtown, in some of the worst neighborhoods. No signs of any parts being taken and eaten, but there's a woman who said she was dragged into an ally by a couple guys, then the Creeper attacked, removed the men's genitals. Then the really shocking part, he actually spoke to the woman, made sure she was alright, then escorted her back to her car. A while later a couple was being mugged, then the Creeper attacks, disarms the guy, luckily this time he only broke the guys arm instead of completely removing it, and the guy takes off into an ally. According to the guy, the Creeper chased him around, harassing him for a while before finally catching him, breaking his leg and dumping him on the steps of the police station. If it's not the Creeper then how did it get from here, to the far side of the city and then to this side of the city in such a short time? It was definitely the same one on both sides of the city, that was the strangest thing about both reports, all the witnesses said the claws on the thing's feet were painted pink and green. It's like somehow it went from being a murdering monster to some type of violent vigilante.\" \"I don't know what's going on, but it can't be the Creeper, it always eats parts of it's victims,\" the first officer said then turned his attention back to Maggie, Jen and Anna, \"If you think of anything else that might help us find the man who stopped these men please give us a call, and we'll let you know if we find anything.\" \"We will, thank you,\" Maggie said then they headed into the house. \"So now your boyfriend is going around mutilating people?\" Anna asked as soon as they were in the house. \"No, it sounds to me like he's going around saving people. Anyways, who are you to complain? Didn't you always say you thought rapists should have their penises cut off?\" Maggie asked. \"The point is he's a violent monster and I don't want to see my only daughter get hurt or killed by that thing,\" Anna told her. Maggie sighed, \"Mom, he'd never hurt me, you're just going to have to trust me that I'm sure of that.\" \"She's right, I haven't spent a whole lot of time with them, but from what I have seen he loves her and would never hurt her,\" Jen added. \"This whole situation just has me so worried about you, I don't know what I'd do if I lost you,\" Anna admitted. \"Oh mom,\" Maggie said hugging her, \"You really don't have to worry. Yes he terrorized those men, but didn't you always say it takes thirty days to form a habit? Well, every time he's been awake for the last two hundred years the curse has forced him to harass and scare the people he's gone after. You put him back in a situation where he's going after someone for whatever reason and it's not surprising that, that habit of terrorizing them kicks in. He's been through a lot more than most people could survive and he's not perfect, but I love him and I really need you to accept him.\" \"And if I don't?\" Anna asked. \"Then holidays are going to be really uncomfortable, because nothing is going to stop me from marrying him,\" Maggie told her. \"Alright, I'll try,\" Anna relented, before there was a knock at the door. \"Thank you,\" Maggie said kissing her on the cheek before heading to the door. \"Is everything alright?\" William asked as she answered the door. \"Yeah, everything is taken care of, except for my arm, I figured it would be easier to have you stitch it up than have to explain to the police how I got shot,\" Maggie told him. \"We'd better get you home then,\" William said. \"Sounds good to me,\" Maggie agreed then went to say goodbye to her mom and Jen. The flight back to the cave was silent, Maggie was exhausted from the hectic day and dozing off in William's arms until they got back to the cave. \"So did you have fun on your trip to the city?\" Maggie asked to distract herself from the pain as William stitched up her arm. \"How'd you know about that?\" William asked. \"The police heard about it while they were still at the house talking to us. So you going for some type of superhero gig now that the curse can't control you?\" she asked. \"More like looking for a constructive way to blow off some steam,\" William admitted as he tied off the last stitch and started to clean and bandage her arm. \"I'm really sorry about the way my mom was acting, she has a couple sisters, but they're not very close, so I'm pretty much the only close family she has and she can be over protective at times,\" Maggie told him. \"She was right, I didn't have to terrorize those men, if I hadn't then you probably wouldn't have been hurt,\" he said walking away from her, \"The truth is I enjoy terrorizing humans, at least the ones I think deserve it.\" \"It's alright, I understand, it doesn't bother me, I agree with you, they did deserve it,\" Maggie said walking over to him and resting a hand on his shoulder. \"Do you really?\" he asked turning to face her, \"Once the curse is broken I may be able to make myself look human, but I'm not, I'll never be human. I love you with all my heart, but there's still a part of me that hates humans for what was done to my family. That's why I terrorized those men, not because they were criminals, but because they were human, the fact that they were criminals just gave me an excuse to terrorize them.\" \"But you don't hate me for being human?\" Maggie asked. \"Of course not, you're the only human I can look at and I don't see a human, I just see the woman I love,\" he replied. \"Then that's good enough for me. You have every reason to hate humans, I can't blame you for that and as long as you're restricting it to criminals it doesn't bother me one bit if you go out terrorizing them once in a while,\" Maggie said wrapping her arms around his neck, \"And I wouldn't want you to be human, I think it would be absolutely depressing if the curse were broken and you just became a normal, boring human. I don't think I could ever be happy with a man who didn't have wings to wrap around me,\" she told him. \"You like them that much?\" he asked as he wrapped his wings around her. Maggie let out a contented sigh as she relaxed into the double embrace of his arms and wings, \"I love them,\" she replied before kissing him. I didn't realize how long it had been since I last updated this, a lot has changed in my life since the last chapter, our landlord sold our house, when we couldn't find a place to rent that worked with my mom's disabilities she had to be put into a nursing home in February 2013 and I started college that fall, going for my near lifelong dream of becoming an archaeologist, which has left with with almost no time to write. In spring of 2014 I found out the college was canceling the archeology program, but was promised they'd continue the classes one more fall and spring so the current students could graduate. In May 2014 my mom got pneumonia and had to have a trech tube put in, her health fluctuated after that until October when she finally started improving. The field school for archaeology that should have taken place over the fall semester was canceled. The beginning of November we still thought mom was improving until she was taken to the hospital because of blood pressure problems, we found out she had stage 4 bedsores, to the bone and so big you could easily fit 2 fists into them. She was semi conscious when we saw her on that Friday, the doctors told us she would never recover and at best might survive 6 months, but she was constantly in pain. The following Monday we went back to see her and she was so heavily sedated she didn't wake up at all, but when they changed the bandages on the bedsores she was just screaming in pain and when we actually saw the sores for ourselves we decided it was time to let her go. The following Friday she was taken to Hospice and my sisters and I stayed with her for a week. During that week I found out the spring archaeology classes had been canceled. Mom died Friday November 14th. I was a complete emotional wreck to the point that I couldn't sleep, couldn't eat and pretty much barely functioned at all until sometime in January. I'm doing better most of the time, but still have times after dealing with stuff that reminds me of her that I can get pretty depressed. As if losing mom wasn't enough to push me over the edge the dean of the college has consistently told me that I can substitute other classes for the archaeology ones that were canceled. About a month ago I went in to talk to her and find out what classes I need to take to be able to graduate in May and now she's saying unless I can pay out of my own pocket to go somewhere else and take a field school I can't get the archaeology degree, there's way I could afford that. Now they want me to switch to an associates of technical studies degree and claim I'll still be able to get a job in archaeology even though I haven't had half the classes I was supposed to have had. And that's just the major thing, it seems like ever since mom died it's been one thing after another and I just can't get one week where nothing bad and overwhelmingly depressing or stressful happens. One thing that has helped me through and given me little moments of distraction from the stress of life, and happiness is when I get reviews for my stories or going back and reading over the older reviews. So since this story has gotten new reviews, favorites and watches more consistently than any of my other stories I decided it would be the first one I write a new chapter for now that I have a two week break between semesters.[Chapter 4] Done with college and back to writing! When Maggie and Jen walked into the college the first day after spring break everyone seemed to fall silent as they walked by and start whispering after they had passed. \"The way they're looking at us you'd think we had brought William with us. I know you said everyone thought I was dead, but this is crazy,\" Jen said. \"It's not just you they're staring at. The teacher read the whole short version of my report about William in front of the class and then I kind of admitted I was the one he took and that I had been staying with him for the last month. It seemed like a way to get a great grade and maybe make people understand him at the time. Now that he doesn't have to hibernate again and we're getting married I'm starting to think it may have been giving out too much information about him,\" Maggie told her. \"At least after you're married he'll be able to make himself look human so no one will recognize him, right?\" Jen asked. \"Yeah, but me going from never dating to married in less than six months and no one seeing the guy I'm marrying before we get married could seem suspicious,\" Maggie pointed out. \"True, we'll just have to pray no one pays that much attention,\" Jen said, \"How are the wedding plans going?\" \"Not so great, I mean we can't find a pastor to marry us because of what he looks like and I think it's kind of depressing him. He hasn't said anything, but when we were talking about who in my family we could trust to invite to the wedding, he just looked so sad.\" Later that day Maggie headed to the college library after her last class of the day. She stayed there until almost nine pm when the library closed and spent all of her time between classes there the next day using the college's access to . By the time her last class ended she had a list of names and addresses and headed out to see if she could find what she was looking for. Half an hour later she pulled up to an old farm house, not far from it was an old log cabin that, according to the records she had found was the original home built on the land and the decedents of the builder's still lived on the property. As Maggie got out of her car a woman stepped out onto the porch of the house, \"Can I help you?\" she asked as Maggie approached the porch. \"I hope so. My name is Maggie, I'm doing some research into the history of the area and when I heard you were descended from the original owners of the property I thought you might know something about it,\" Maggie told her. \"That'll be no problem, our family has always been good about passing down the family history to the next generation. I'm Christiana. What do you want to know?\" \"I was wondering about the first few generations who lived here?\" Maggie told her. \"Why don't you come inside, I have portraits of many of the early members of the family and I can tell you about them,\" Christiana told her. A long hall way led from the front of the house to the back and along both sides were dozens of old paintings that had to have come from the seventeen and eighteen hundreds. Christiana told her about each one and the person's life at the property. Finally they came to one of a woman and man with three children, the woman while she had darker hair and skin looked amazingly similar to Christiana, \"This is my many greats grandmother, Christiana, I was named after her. This was painted shortly before she came to live here with her in-laws after her husband died,\" Christiana told her. \"Why didn't she stay with her own family?\" Maggie asked although she was sure she already knew the answer. \"Her family was part Native American and back then people didn't like half breeds living among them. The rest of her family was murdered because of being different. She would have died too if not for her nephew getting her and her children here,\" Christiana told her, then turned and pointed to a picture on the wall behind them. Maggie turned to find a portrait of a man with long black hair and high cheek bones betraying his Native heritage, around his neck a pendant with a carving of a man holding an ax standing between a young girl and a bear. Maggie reached to her neck to touch the pendant that was hidden under her shirt. \"He's something of a family hero since none of us would be here today if not for him saving our ancestors. He's one of those family members you know you'll never meet, but would love to be able to thank for what they did for us. He's suffered so much because of it,\" Christiana told her. \"Do you know what happened after he got your grandmother here?\" Maggie asked. Christiana hesitated a moment then said, \"It's said that when she hadn't heard from any of her family after they were being attacked she went back to try to find them. According to family rumor she found they had all been killed, except for her nephew, she saw him briefly, but- that's all we know,\" she finished quickly. \"You're not a very good liar,\" Maggie told her. \"Well there are just somethings that have to remain a family secret. I really can't tell you anymore,\" Christiana told her. \"Because you're ashamed to admit you're related to the Creeper?\" Maggie asked. \"Never, he-\"fear flashed across Christiana's face, \"I- I mean he's-\" Maggie rested a hand on her arm, \"I'm not going to tell anyone. So were you serious about wishing you could thank him for saving your grandmother's life? Would you want to meet him?\" \"Yes I'd want to thank him, but our family isn't immune to the curse, enough generations of marrying white people and he killed my uncle forty-six years ago. It's too late anyways, we always keep track of when he'll be awake, he'd be hibernating again,\" Christiana told her. \"Your grandmother only saw him that one time? Right after her family was killed?\" Maggie asked. \"Yes,\" Christiana replied, then asked, \"How do you know about him?\" \"The curse was changed later on too give him a chance to escape it,\" Maggie told her. \"How? And why should I believe anything you have to say?\" Christiana asked. \"It's sort of a Beauty and the Beast thing, only the beast doesn't turn into prince charming until after the wedding. And you should believe me because he gave me this,\" she said pulling the pendant out, \"and I'm the one who is going to break the curse,\" Maggie told her. Christiana reached out to touch the pendant, glancing from it to the picture, \"You're serious? He's going to be free of that curse? I could actually get to meet him someday?\" \"The curse is no longer in control, you could meet him any time you want,\" Maggie told her, \"He's nowhere near as good looking as he was in that picture though.\" \"I know,\" Christiana replied as she reached behind the picture of William and pulled out an ancient looking piece of paper sealed in a plastic sleeve and handed it to Maggie. On the paper was a sketch of William after he had been cursed, \"Grandma drew that after she saw him, is that really what he looks like?\" Christiana ask. \"Yes, the teeth may be exaggerated, but just a little, can't blame the artist for that though, those teeth are scary. Otherwise that's amazingly accurate.\" After talking for nearly another hour Maggie headed back to the cave. As soon as she walked in William asked, \"Is everything alright? You've been out awfully late the last two days.\" \"Everything is great,\" Maggie said kissing him, \"I was just working on a little surprise for you.\" \"What kind of surprise?\" William asked as he wrapped his wings around her. \"The kind I think you'll really like. You'll find out this Sunday,\" Maggie told him. \"You've got to give me a better clue than that,\" William told her. \"Nope, no clues,\" Maggie told him. \"Please?\" William begged. \"No.\" \"Fine, no clues, no wings,\" he told her pulling his wings away. \"Fine, no wings I'll just start sleeping at home,\" Maggie said turning to walk towards the door, but only got a few steps before his wings closed around her and pulled her back into his arms. \"Alright, it can be a surprise,\" he relented. \"That's better,\" Maggie told him before kissing him. That Sunday Maggie woke up to the feeling of William trailing his fingers over her face and through her hair, \"What time is it?\" she asked drowsily. \"The sun is rising,\" William told her. \"Why am I awake?\" she asked. \"Because you said I get that surprise today,\" William told her. \"Not until this afternoon, we have plenty of time to sleep in,\" she said grabbing the edge of his wing and pulling it over her head. \"Do I really have to wait that long?\" he asked. \"It won't be ready until then. Just let me sleep a little longer,\" Maggie told him. \"If you insist,\" he told her, pulling his wing down from her face and kissing her cheek as she dozed off. By noon they left the cave and Maggie was leading William, who was blindfolded through the woods, \"I understand the blindfold so I don't see the surprise too soon, but why do I have to wear clothes and this awful shirt? You only make me wear this if we're going to be around other humans,\" William pointed out. \"You'll see when we get there and maybe you can take it off later,\" Maggie told him. \"We're not trying another meeting with your mother are we?\" he asked, a hint a nervousness in his voice. \"Definitely not. I told you, you'll like this surprise. Now no more questions,\" she told him. Several minutes later they came into the clearing where the old house was and while she had planned it, Maggie was still surprised at the site that she saw. Folding tables and chairs had been set up, a long line of tables with various types of food sat at one end of the yard which had been neatly mowed and cleared of the years of fallen branches and weeds. Easily over fifty people were gathered on the porch and in the yard. If not for the guest of honor it would look like any other family reunion. \"We stopped, can I take the blind fold off yet?\" William asked. \"Just one more second,\" Maggie told him. Christiana walked over to stand in front of him, they had agreed that since she looked so much like her grandmother who William had rescued that it would be best for her to be the first person he saw. Christiana had taken the lead on contacting and sharing pictures of William with the rest of the family who had known about William saving their grandmother and the curse. When Christiana had told her the family was good about passing down the family history, she hadn't imagined there would be so many people who knew about William, but the fact that there were so many that cared enough to meet him warmed her heart. Finally Maggie started to untie the blindfold as she told him, \"So those nights I was out late I was doing some research and tracking some people down.\" As the blindfold slipped from his eyes, William gasped when he saw Christiana, \"Chrissy? –No, but you- how,\" he stuttered out until he noticed all the other people by the house, \"What is this?\" he finally asked. \"This is your family, just a small handful of the decedents of your aunt you saved, if not for you none of us would be here,\" Christiana told him. The rest of the day was spent getting to know his family, playing games and making wedding plans. It turned out that one of his cousins was a pastor who was thrilled to be able to perform the wedding. Another was a caterer and insisted on providing food for the reception. When William had said he didn't think there would be that many people at the wedding he was told that if he would have them, everyone at the reunion would want to be there. Plus several more who hadn't been able to make it that day, would want to be there to celebrate the marriage of the person they had grown up hearing had single handedly been responsible for their family's survival. When Christiana had told Maggie that William was thought of as a family hero she hadn't been exaggerating. They also discovered that while the land had actually been split up over the years all of the land that had originally belonged to William's family still belonged to members of the family and he and Maggie were more than welcome to restore the house and live there. When the sun started to set everyone left and William and Maggie headed back to the cave. \"I can't believe you did this, that you were even able to find them,\" William said, pulling her into his arms and wrapping his wings around her as soon as he was sure they were alone. \"It actually wasn't that hard, I've been doing genealogy for half my life and the college has access to a site that has a lot of records that made it easy to find out their names and then all I had to do was check another website to find out where they lived. It's not the first time I've traced a family forward like that. I had a cousin who had been adopted and only knew he was my cousin because of a DNA test. I was able to trace it forward from the mid eighteen hundreds and narrow it down to two brothers who might have been his father. Finding your family was easy compared to that,\" Maggie told him. \"It still seems like a miracle to me,\" William told her then kissed her. ","Summary":" It's here! I'm finally getting started on the sequel. Sorry about the long wait, I just ended up wo"},{"Movie":"Jeepers Creepers","Title":"A Devil's Legacy","Author":"StoryBookGhoolies","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9730376","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Disclaimer: I don't own Jeepers Creepers, The Creeper, or any canon based ideas, characters, sets and such involved in this fanfic, it belongs to Victor Salva who invented the set up anyways. Nicole Alkins and The Raven (the Creepers son), belong to the ever wonderful and talented TheMortition and I suggest you check out the fanfic ' What Do You Want From Me? ' before you read this, just to clear anything else up. Any other original concepts, characters, ideas or settings belong to me however. I am sadly not profiting off this in anyways. A/N: Well, here we are again, at the beginning of a new tale! Today we're taking a trip to Prescott County in Florida (this is fictional of course and I made it up because I don't remember the Jeepers Creepers location ever being formed). I've sadly had to do a lot of guess work with dates so sorry if anyone doesn't like my timescale but I was simply working via guesses, not via actual facts which I'd been able to discover. The only information I could get about the location is that it was the Florida countryside and the time it was set in was unknown. My fanfic is set in 2004, with Nicole's experience having happened back in 1985. Sorry if you hate me for this, but I had to take a couple of guesses about the time Jeepers Creepers was set in, and I chose the 80's because to me it seemed a safe bet. I hope you enjoy reading this fanfic and I hope you like my protagonist Noelle; this chapter is a little basic, but I wanted to ease you into the story and what's going on. Please rate and review, but I'm not enforcing it! I just hope you enjoy my work! The atmosphere in the car was almost as suffocating as the blistering heat roaring down from the sunny skies which sat up above our small car; I'd never been much of a summer girl, and the way the weather was making me definitely reflected that side of me. I was surprised perspiration hadn't begun to build up on the windows the heat was becoming so unbearable; it was like the time my parents had taken me to one of those tropical domes where you can feel like you live in a rainforest, and I almost fainted then anyways. Maybe being born in December had this impact on me, or maybe I was just born as one of those people who react badly to intense heat? Trickles of sweat were beginning to form on the inside of the cast which encircled my right arm, itchy little bubbles beginning to slowly slide down my arm. Dozens of names littered the fading, creamy-whiteness of it; most of the names belonged to the 'hooligans' (what dad called them), more commonly known as my friends, but the odd signature or name belonged to one of my many former classmates. My bags, one of which was my former school bag, aligned the back seat like a little battalion of soldiers waiting for my orders to attack or something along the lines of that. The boxes I'd packed on Thursday were placed in the boot, the ones with precious valuables in them wrapped with a protective cocoon of bubble wrap so my more expensive, and important, possessions weren't broken during the sometimes bumpy car journey we'd been taking across the states, but I figured my dad wanted to improve our somewhat fractured relationship. But this wasn't a holiday or some family trip out, and we weren't moving house. I was moving. I would've moved out five months ago, but we were waiting for the leg brace to come off, so my house moving was postponed. It was just me going to Granny Kath's house, neither my parents, nor my older sister Annette were going, just me. It was impossible for my older brother Luke to go, because he'd moved out our suburban three story home over a year ago. I guess you could argue this was a form of punishment, but it wasn't directed at me; it was directed entirely at my best friend, Kendell Richmond, the causer of my broken wrist and leg. I'd told her she shouldn't have been driving after drinking the sheer amount of beer she had at Stacie Copula's seventeenth birthday, but she'd insisted on driving me home, although I'd only had half of one, making me the much more competent, and safer driver. She hadn't seen the navy blue pickup truck coming when she'd attempted to jump the light, just five minutes away from my house. The truck had slammed into the side of Kendell's red mini, practically crushing the door on impact, knocking her unconscious the second the door connected with right hand side of her body; but it was me who had the real damage inflicted. Due to the force of the truck hitting her car, my seatbelt had managed to snap on impact, causing me to fall straight onto the passenger side's door; although I'd span mid-air, making it my right hand side which had slammed harshly against the door, not my left, embedding my wrist with tiny bits of broken glass and snapping my upper leg bones straight upon impact. A sharp, red-hot needle of pain had burst sharply into my leg, numbing the sparking stinging sensation which had erupted in my wrist in comparison. And all I remember before passing out was shrieking like a banshee as I heard the sound of sirens begin to chime in the distant. Just my luck I lived near a police station; and it didn't help that my dad was the sheriff's deputy. One 'official family meeting' later, my mom and dad ended up coming up with the conclusion that me moving to the backwood, countryside of Florida where my dad had grown up, would be the best for me. Maybe he figured there would be no 'party crazy, drunken, reckless drivers' in the backwoods of Florida as he'd oh-so politically correctly put it! Having deputy sheriff, Lee Manning, as my father meant I couldn't get away with breaking strangely without his ears pricking up and then being asked a hundred and one questions relating towards it; and he figured that a town with less than three thousand people living there was the perfect destination for me to begin living, in an attempt to get me away from my 'reckless' friend Kendell. Part of me figured my dad never truly liked Kendell, even though we'd been best friends from the second grade, although I couldn't really blame him for it; her mom, Sasha Richmond, had been a call girl who'd abandoned Kendell from a young age and she'd ended up going into care, which had probably influenced her issues when it came towards alcoholism and drug abuse. She was filling a hole her mother had put there. Maybe I'd become friends with her because part of me always wished I could be a little bit more like Kendell; a fiery, tough, vibrant, somewhat reckless, fun-loving, exciting, exhilarating, confident, secure, inciting, sociable, colourful badass, compared to my boring, meek, well-mannered, rule-obeying, overly mature, reclusive, quiet, cowardly nobody. During my time in junior high, if someone ever picked on me, I'd simply look down at my work and swallow back my rising tears; Kendell would usually end up getting in either a verbal or physical fight, and would even end up getting in them if someone dared pick on me when she was there or if I told her. In return I'd always end up helping her out with some form of homework and explain things to her. That was the only thing I had an advantage over her with: intelligence. I grew up a law-abiding, straight-A student whilst she grew up an immature, straight-D student. I guess we were quite the spectacle to our classmates who'd known us since we became friends all those years ago. Kendell with her eventual 5'1 and chubby build which made people often underestimate her massively because of her weight and height; with her chubby, pleasant face which was almost heart-shaped but not quite, a nice snubbed nose and high, impressive cheekbones which definitely stood out on her plumped face, not discounting the amazingly deep colour of her tree-sap amber eyes which shone out of her face like beacons on a lighthouse. Her face was outlined with perfectly straightened hair which wavered around her shoulders, a shade of blonde so light it borderlined white; of course this wasn't her natural coloured, and she'd bleached it two years ago when we were fifteen and liked it that way. Her natural hair colour had been a sort of chestnut brown which I'd always loved, so I'd never understood why she'd bleached it but didn't ask; sometimes the tiniest of things put her in a bad mood and she'd refuse to speak to me for days. The bleached blonde looked a little…Tacky I suppose against her naturally russet skin. She'd always wear dark leather jackets, dark jeans with a pair of pointy-toed, black leather heeled boots which reached her calf level; like I said total badass material. Then you'd have to turn your eyes to me, or should that be drag your eyes to me? I'm taller than her, but that's just because my dad's 6'3\" and my mom's 5'11\", so it figures I'm not too small when it comes to the height stakes. I'm not as tall as my big brother Luke, who stands at an incredible 6'5\", or my sister Annette who stands at 6'1\"; I simply stand at just 5'7\" but I guess I'm going to grow even taller as time passes. I had a couple of friends back in the city, such as Robin Drake and Jesse Gilbert, towered above me but I was pretty tall compared to the girl's. I've always been fair skinned opposed to her tan, looking like a little snowwoman compared to her Amazonian warrior princess; I've always had a very pale complexion, which isn't helped by the naturally tanned majorative of my bunch of friends. It doesn't help that I inherited my mother's dark brown hair, the colour of seal fur, called that because it resembles the colour of an appropriately named fur seals fur; it's long, straight and just peaks my waist, although it sort of flicks outwards at the end. My face is heart-shaped, only just though, with a slim jawline, long nose with a point to the end, and large, even spaced eyes; my eyes are an iris blue colour, so blue they almost look purple. Overall, people tell me I'm pretty, and I have to agree, but my bland personality puts people off me immediately; and I lack the breast and thigh Kendell does. Looking back on it though, none of my \"friends\" were really my friends; they were definitely more Kendell's friends; even with my slender figure, large iris blue eyes, and pretty face, yet bland figure, they never really accepted me, only liking me because I could help them get out of trouble when it came to my dad. Sometimes I even doubted if they were proper friends with Kendell, mainly relying on her for drugs and booze; but recently I hadn't even been sure what terms I was on with Kendell. She wasn't too happy when I announced my dad's decision and pestered me to 'stand up to him', but that's impossible, impossible for someone as cowardly and overly-paranoid as me. I knew if I tried standing up to someone, it'd only end up with my father becoming more determined to send me to my gran's, and, even though I still ended up going, arguing back with him would just worsen the situation. Wearing a grey tank-top didn't accelerate my chest like it would with most women, and my pale blue jeans were only just bearable in the burning summer sun; being slim is good in some aspects, but my overall body proportions played out fairly. I lacked circumstantial chest area, and my thighs were slimmer than all the other girls I'd ever really known, bar a few. Being tall as well as slim limits your chances of getting a good chest and thigh mass, but I've gotten over it as my teenage years have passed by. The worse causer of sweat was my arm cast but that was something I couldn't deal with so I'd simply had to turn the air conditioning up to full blast and sit it out, waiting for the heat to mercifully calm down a little so I didn't feel faint or dizzy anymore. I was only thankful our car wasn't any more crowded or I would've fainted by this point. So far my father and I hadn't spoken so much as a line of dialogue without it being stuffy and awkward, just feeling plain wrong. Dad knew how annoyed I was with him, resenting the fact I was being dragged away from my friends and the city which I'd grown up in, feeling comfortable there; but it wasn't really all because of that. If you overviewed my annoyance directed towards my father, it was more to do with my Granny Kath. It was nothing personal, I'd just never really gotten to know her over my seventeen years of life; the last time we'd visited her I was six years old, a full eleven years ago. We'd spent Christmas with her, which awkwardly coincided with my birthday, on the 24th of September, which resulted in my practically ridiculous name. I was born Noelle Delia Manning, named Noelle because I was born so near to Christmas, only missing out by a day; I swear if I was born on the 25th, I would've literally been named fucking Christmas Manning. Then there are my older siblings Luke Alexander Manning and my older sister Annette Nancy Manning; Annette's nineteen and at college, studying fashion journalism, whilst Luke's moved out of our house and is living in Arizona now, with his wife Alice and daughter, Mollie. So my families pretty broken apart at the moment. I suppose dad must be pretty broken up about me moving away to the desolate countryside of Florida, but he's clearly reasoned it over in his head, making sure he's totally assured with his reasoning for why he's sending me off to live with Granny Kath. His eyes, the same iris blue as my own, shone with concentration as he steadily kept his eyes focused onto the road; his sandy coloured hair, curling like the ends of my own, fell slightly in front of his eyes and clearly needed to get a haircut sometime soon although so far he hadn't been able to arrange one. What, with me and my physiotherapy, Luke getting married to Alice, and Annette planning for college, he was pretty stressed, meaning haircuts were probably the last thing on his mind by that precise point in time. Part of me wished I could've inherited my father's sandy coloured hair, because it would've looked better with my violet-blue coloured eyes; then again, no-one gets to pick their own chromosomes, which is a good thing or people would literally model themselves to look like anime characters or some crazy shit like that. In today's modern world, with image being everything, I should know that all too well. As trees and fields flew by, including the odd house, I saw something which slightly mystified me; hidden within a large grove, mainly composed of trees and long, overgrown strands of grass sat a building which I thought would never appear in such a desolate area. It was a church. It was constructed out of either white wood or white plaster with a coppery coloured roof, but apart from that was rather different to any other church I'd ever seen; it was old and desolate looking, and the closer we got I could tell it was in fact made of wood, due to the fact several planks of it had fallen out over time, mainly near the top of the construction. The spire had been broken off and now only a small, rather pitiful stump remained, marking it as a holy building; the moss smothered steps which led up to it looked so old I think if I'd so much as stepped on one they would have crumbled and I would've fallen over. The windows and doors were all open and empty, with the windows being boarded up with beige planks of wood and secured, but the two doors were left wide open, which surprised me. But more surprising still were the two vehicles which sat outside, nestled in the mint green coloured grass, but they were clearly visible to someone with sharp eyes like me; one of them was a huge, brown, rusting truck, something I'd never seen before it was so odd. To be fair, where I come from not many people own any form of trucks, but it still surprised me then. It looked like it hadn't been used in years, and no wonder why, but it was the second object which surprised me more. It was a 66 Harley Davidson, painted purely white; the only reason I knew its make was because my brother owned one of the same, only his was painted red. The strange thing was though, how fresh and new it looked compared to the crumbling church and rusted truck. \"Quite the eye saw, isn't it.\" My father spoke up, making me jump slightly so I turned my eyes back to him, and nodded, not sure of what to say. \"When I was a kid everyone used to say a monster lived in the old church; a huge, winged creature which fed on the flesh of humans every twenty-something years. Didn't stop us from going up there and drinking every weekend.\" \"Oh Lee, you badass!\" I muttered under my breath, causing him to begin laughing and he smiled at me, which immediately managed to evaporate the tension which had formed between us in the car, a huge relief to both of us. \"Seriously though, why monster? I mean…Even home had that stupid legend about the man with a hook who stalked the woods, which at least eighteen other states in America probably share. I mean, as mom likes to say, when you're making up an urban legend at least try to make it believable; last time I checked, winged batman wasn't too realistic .\" \"First of all,\" he started, pausing to increase our cars speed from fifty to sixty mph, \"Well…\" He looked unsure of how to continue but found a way pretty quickly because he continued speaking. \"Every twenty-three years, Prescott would be plagued by a series of murders or missing persons. The victims ranged in age and gender, but they'd always disappear after spending time driving out on the highways. They were often tourists but the police department out here got a really bad rep because of it.\" \"I'm guessing that's why you didn't stay here when you decided to join the force.\" Was all I could say, trying to ignore the cold plummet forming in my stomach, wondering why dad had let me come to live here with all these unsolved murders and missing person's. Prescott County, Florida turned out to be the state's unsolved murder capital when I checked it out at the local library; never a promising sign if you're going to be living here. \"Exactly,\" dad nodded and looked at me. \"But you don't need to worry, Noe.\" Noe was the nickname I'd earned from an early age, but it felt weird to be called it again by him, because since I was twelve he'd simply called me Noelle. Maybe coming out here had changed something about him and his worries, due to all the murders and disappearances, were beginning to creep back in. \"It's only been nineteen years since the last case, and if this is an incredibly organized gang or even family of serial killers, and by the time it's reached twenty-three I have a feeling you'll have come back to the city. Look, I know you're not exactly thrilled, or even happy, about coming out here but…The accident, it just really shook me up, me and your mom. I worried that it wouldn't be the last time either. Ever since that girl got a drivers licence I knew something like this was going to happen. I just didn't know it was going to be you.\" \"Dad, I'm sorry!\" I sighed, looking at him and smiled slightly at him. \"I just didn't know how drunken Kendell was. She told me she'd only had a couple of beers and I believed her; I didn't know how well she could fake being sober…\" He put his hand on my shoulder and squeezed gently, smiling softly at me, his eyes warm for once. \"I know, Noelle. I'm sorry if this feels like a punishment because you're being sent away from Kendell and all your other friends but…Well, as you've probably guessed, me and your mom aren't exactly the biggest fans of the crowd you socialize with. This wouldn't have happened if Annette hadn't started getting worried too, and she's never been the greatest one for decision making.\" Now that was true, Annette had gotten into a really bad crowd when she was in high school; I'm talking drug dealers and addicts, people who were really off their faces when it came to drugs. Her being concerned over my friends automatically made everything clearer. \"It was her worries which made me certain sending you to live with my mother was actually for the best.\" \"I understand,\" I said solemnly before realising there was something I needed to ask him. \"Um…Dad, did you see that Harley outside the creepy church building? It was like, really new and shiny looking, painted white? It looked kinda out of place.\" \"No…Why?\" He asked, looking at me suspiciously. \"It just seemed really strange,\" I nodded, agreeing with my own statement, strange as it was. \"The way the truck looked so old…\" He cut me off then. \"Oh that truck's been there for years! No-one's ever claimed it as their own; it's just sat out there. But, every twenty-three years, apparently people see it roaring down the highway. But a bike you said?\" \"Yeah,\" I nodded, but this time it was rather uncertainly. \"It was really white, the same make of Luke's I think, and it was just sorta…Standing there, leaning against the wall, it looked really out of place because the rest of that church area's just so run down.\" \"Were there any other vehicles with it?\" My dad asked, and I had the embarrassing worry he wanted to go all cop and bust some drug taking teens. \"No,\" I shook my head quickly, trying to save my own dignity in case he did decided to go and try investigating the old, rotting church. \"Just that one bike, which was…I guess what I found the strangest. It was just parked there by itself; no other cars were with it.\" My dad shook his head, but luckily kept the car going in the direction we'd been flowing in, not doing one of the U-turns he occasionally did which made me almost fall out the car once. \"Maybe it was just some kid taking a look at the old place? A lot of us used to do it when I lived her, and, seeing as there's still enough kids for a high school, I guess a lot of them must go and check out the old place sometimes. Me and your uncle once went there exploring, but we ended up scaring ourselves more than the house did; the place works solely on the art of using your imagination to frighten you more than anything you'll end up seeing. The worst things you'll ever see are just a couple of dead rat and the odd dead crow. For some reason those birds seem to love that church, maybe it's all the rats.\" He shrugged. \"All I'm saying is, it was probably nothing; nothing to get yourself worked up over.\" I nodded and leant back into my seat, still wondering about the odd car. \"Anything else you can tell me about this place dad? Y'know,\" I added quickly. \"Just so I can get prepare myself for Monday, when I start school.\" It was Friday, but it was already 2:24 in the afternoon and dad knew there was no way we'd have arrived quick enough for me to be able to start school today. \"So I know what the kids will be like.\" \"Hmm…\" He paused for a couple of minutes before responding to my question. \"Well I guess, this place is traditionally tight nit, like most small towns located in the South. The kids might be a little standoffish at first, but they'll warm up to you over time, especially once they realise I'm your dad. Being the kid of a local immediately makes your time easier here, even if said local moved away over twenty years ago.\" He laughed at that, then smiled back at me, but it faded after another minute of thinking happened. \"But…There's someone I'd suggest you stay away from. I mean, I never believed the rumours which circulated around this particular person, but…There were a lot of rumours, even back then when she first arrived.\" \"Who is this?\" I asked uncertainly. \"I mean. I think I might need a name and description so I can hopefully stay away from this woman.\" \"Oh sorry!\" He said quickly, but I just smiled at him and he continued. \"Her name's Nicole Alkins, she'll be about forty-one by now, couple years younger than your mom.\" Two to be precise, I thought. \"I was twenty-four and had almost completed my police training when she turned up in town; she used to be a friend of your mom's for her first couple of years here, while your mom was doing her geography studies so she could become a teacher.\" Good old mom, teaching high school level geography, although she'd luckily not chosen my former high school to teach at. \"She was about 5'5\" and last I heard from your gran she'd stayed that height; shoulder length dark brown hair, probably longer by now, hazel brown eyes, pale skinned. Fairly pretty, but there was something which hung around her, a cloud of misery.\" \"What does that mean?\" I asked cautiously. \"Do you mean like…She was cursed? Bad things kept happening to her?\" \"Not to Nicole specifically,\" he shook his head. \"But to those around her. She came out here with her cousin, Elizabeth Isleton, more commonly known as Bess, and her cousins' friends; Paul Armstrong, Bess' boyfriend, Taylor Stokes, her best friend, and their three other friends James Gray, more commonly known as Jimmie, Devon Castaneda and Deanna Sargent. To be fair, the six of them were drug taking, reckless lowlife's, but…They didn't deserve what happened never the less.\" He swallowed thickly, as if the next bit was unpleasant. \"They came here in 1985, twenty-three years after the past spree of killings and…Well,\" he sighed and shook his head. \"I'm sure you can guess what happened then.\" \"They were killed.\" I mumbled and my dad just nodded to tell me I was correct. \"Only Nicole survived, but she was kidnapped and raped by the murderer; she claimed she couldn't remember anything about him and the baby…\" He paused again, swallowing tightly. \"It was born horribly deformed and presumed dead, but she persuaded them to let her keep it and she did.\" He shook his head again but patted me lightly on the shoulder, as if to reassure me it was all fine. \"She left town after that to attend art college but returned three years later with a baby; obviously not the one she'd had after her traumatic experience, but apparently she'd met another guy, they'd even got engaged but in the end things hadn't worked out, although she was left with her son, Robert, more commonly known as Rob.\" I nodded and gestured for him to carry on talking. \"It's just…Due to the winged demon legend circulating around the town, some people believed she'd in fact bred with the demon and the deformed child was a result. They called her a witch and…\" He sighed again, this time it was a lot sharper though. \"Basically, I heard a couple of dogs went missing when she came back and even I'm not too sure about her now. She owns the Earth Child Emporium on White Street; it's a Wiccan shop, dishes out spell books, equipment for spells, crystal balls ect. In fact, your gran really likes her, but…I'd just be careful.\" \"So…Let me get this straight…\" I muttered. \"This Nicole Alkins lady is apparently a witch who had a baby with a demon and killed dogs to feed they're demon baby blood?\" \"That's what folks like to say,\" was all he replied. \"I mean, like I said, don't believe everything you hear around these parts, people are fanatical when it comes to legends, so a woman opening a Wicca shop really stirred them all up. Especially because of the brutal killings which happened revolving around her; people just got superstitious and began throwing ridiculous theories out there, because they didn't truly understand the situation. Don't listen to the town crazies, but just…Stay away from her too. It's nothing personal, I just don't want you getting involved within people's rumours; if you began hanging around Nicole and her shop, people would then assume you were a demon groupie as well and would begin hassling your gran over it. She's not too well already and that could seriously harm her, so no visiting Nicole Alkins, deal?\" \"Deal.\" I said firmly and then laughed slightly. \"No visiting the supposed witch on White Street, and no getting involved with demons.\" We both laughed at that and I shook my head. \"But what about the son? I mean…Does he know about all these rumours? What happened to him?\" \"Still lives here,\" dad explained. \"He'll be in your year actually, but, and this is just speculation; I'm guessing he won't be the football team captain or king of the socialites. Due to the rumours about his mom I'm guessing his reputation was tarnished as well, which really isn't his fault, but I suppose life's unfair like that. Not to sound like a stereotypical dad but I don't think it'd be good if you hung around him either; I'm not discounting he could be a lovely boy, but again, the rumours which would speculate could make your gran really ill and I feel I've caused her enough hassle. I mean, it'll be good with you there I guess,\" He turned and smiled at me, his eyes radiating warmth. \"Just so she has someone to talk to and keep her company…\" He trailed off as the car rounded a bend and we began making our way up a long stretch of greenery, which I realised led up to my gran's house. \"Where do they live then?\" I asked and he looked at me strangely, making me realise he had no clue who I was talking about. \"Nicole Alkins and her son, Rob, I mean. Like, where do they live out here?\" \"Apparently,\" my father continued looking straight ahead, but occasionally his eyes would slide to the side, watching me, making sure I was fine. \"She earned a lot of money selling paintings in college and I can understand why, I've seen some and they're amazing. But anyways, she earned herself a lot of money, enough to build her own house and that's what she did. A couple of miles north of the old church, she built this farm, where she and her son now live. From the photos I've seen its spectacular, nothing I've ever seen is that complicated or wonderful. Stained glass windows, endless fields, it looked more like a church than the actual church!\" He laughed slightly. \"But apparently it's pretty hard to find. You have to drive quite some way out of the main town area to find the farm, and even then people keep away, for obvious reasons. But hush now!\" He tapped me on the shoulder. \"We have reached your gran's house and for some reason she has a fondness for Ms Alkins, so don't tell her what I've been telling you.\" \"Promise.\" I grinned at him and laughed, before turning my eyes back to the house which was now directly in front of me. It was a lovely house, and even reminded me a little of the spooky old church if someone had been keeping it in better condition; like pretty much every other house I'd seen as we'd taken the long journey out here, it was made of white wooden planks, and stood at the traditional two stories high, maybe three if you counted the infamous basement my dad used to tell me about as a little girl. The windows were all partially covered with the same white cloth curtain and the porch had one of those hanging swing seats on it, dangling from two silver chains. It was a pleasant house, much nicer than our boring brick one, and radiated a much nicer aura due to its white colouring. An elderly woman, with slightly wrinkling, pale skin stood on the front porch, at the top of the freshly painted white steps. It was the eyes which evidently gave her away as my dad's mother, they were the same iris blue of my own and his, almost glowing in the midst of her creamy-white skin. Her hair was silver coloured, running down her back in a neatly fashioned French plat; she was dressed strangely practical for a woman of seventy-one years old with her creamy-yellow coloured slacks and white cardigan which matched the whiteness of her top. Her feet were covered with a pair of beige coloured sandals, and her toenails were painted a bright red colour. Her face was soft and heart-shaped, like my mom's and my own, but much more defindely so and her thin mouth was pulled into a smile. \"Leighton!\" She grinned, calling my dad by his full name, not his abbreviated 'Lee'. \"How lovely to see you again! And this must be Noelle,\" she turned her eyes to me. \"My! You have grown into a beautiful young woman! It'll be lovely to have you stay with me!\" I felt the colour rush to my cheeks but dad, thank god, spoke up for me. \"Hasn't she just!\" He laughed. \"And I'm sure she's going to be very happy staying here, especially because the move caused me to buy her a present she's very much going to be needing if she's going to live out here!\" \"Present?\" I asked cautiously. My parents haven't always had the best of tastes when it comes to buying me gifts, but this time, I was pleasantly shocked. Not 'surprised', I was 'shocked', and that was solely down to the price tag which must've come with this rather expensive gift I was being presented. \"Oh my God…\" I muttered the minute I looked to my left. \"You bought me a car!? \" On the driveway's incredibly empty space, bar my gran's old, fading green 1950's Chevy Pickup, was a car which looked startling modern opposed to it. The car was sleek and black, it's make was a Mercedes-Benz S-Class, according to my dad, and looked far too modern for Prescott County with its pickup trucks and vast collection of motorbikes; I figured it'd make me stand out even more when I started my new school. But then it hit me. I needed a car to get around. It was only then when I realised how isolated my father's hometown truly was, and how isolated I was going to become.[Chapter 2] Disclaimer: I don't owner Jeepers Creepers, nor any of the original content which can be found within this fic, they all belong to Victor Salva.

A/N: Chapter 2! And the introduction of Robert 'Rob' Alkins is to be revealed, as well as his slightly odd reaction to Noelle. This is set on a Sunday, two days after her arrival in Prescott County, and she's nervously awaiting her first day of school, so she decides to go and check out the local diner (the one Derry and Trish went to in the first movie) in the hopes of making some new friends. There she meets teenage outcast and horror film addict Jamie Camacho who offers her some advice on how to deal with school and his own 'theories' on the truth behind Rob Alkins-the school's star baseball team runner. But are any of these half-baked ideas accurate or is Jamie truly suffering after spending eleven years caring for his depressed and unstable mother? Is there something more than what meets the eye about Rob or is it all just misunderstandings upon his behalf? Read and see. Streams of light shot through my new bedroom's window, peaking through a crack in the fading white coloured curtains which I hadn't drawn as expertly as my Granny Kath could've. I'd dressed loosely for bed, wearing a simple white tank top and navy blue shorts, with my hair tied back into a tight plat, so it didn't tangle during the night. Gently slipping the band off the end of my hair, I did the timewasting process of unlinking each lock of hair from its intertwined pattern which threaded the locks of my hair neatly together. I'd kept the window open by a couple of cm's that night because of the stuffy, sweat inducing heat which had been radiating throughout my new room. Even with my new Mercedes-Benz S-Class, courtesy of my dad, it couldn't draw anything away from the burning heat which rolled over the fields of the Floridian countryside. Thinking about it however, it suddenly made sense why people might see the appeal living out here, especially people with teenage kids. Prescott County appealed to them in the exact same way it'd appealed to my dad when he was trying to decide what sort of place would be good for me to go for some 'cooling down' period whilst my wrist, and trust in Kendell, healed. Places like this were full of god-fearing, law-abiding citizens, with little to no crime; sure, Prescott was a little different, but as long as you weren't living here during the twenty-three year period time leap, you were perfectly safe from whatever was out there, stalking the highways for victims. Part of me wondered if it was all just some elaborate hoax, a bunch of drunken college students had invented, roping in more and more people over the course of time, so it became one of the biggest stunts America had ever witnessed. But the other part of me, the nervous, proper part of me knew there was at least some truth behind it. Looking back, I remembered how as we'd driven past the sign which announced we'd finally reached Prescott County, how I'd seen a load of white pieces of paper stuck around the borders of the sign, and it hit me. They were missing person's flyers; the sorts you see in places like New York and Seattle. They littered the edges of the sign and it finally hit me how many people had gone missing over the years. I simply shook my head at the thought, trying to push it to the back of my mind, but it'd unnerved me; knowing all those people had met some sort of brutal or even yet unknown, end in my new hometown. Part of me wanted to run over to my chest of draws, grab my cell phone and ring dad, begging him to take me home where I'd end up feeling safe and where no nasty, ugly, winged demon men could catch me and do god-knows-what to me. but I didn't want to leave the gran I barely knew alone again, and besides, I figured I should've known better when I got into the car that Kendell had lied about her alcohol intake; besides, like I mentioned, I wasn't even too sure any of my 'friends' were missing me. Maybe I could make some real ones here. Sighing, I looked around my gran's former guest room and couldn't help but smile at the lavender painted walls and white bedspread with a deep indigo throw, which felt like it was made of silk but I wasn't too sure, tossed across the duvet cover. My gran had judged my taste in colours well. Several, spiralling glass decorative objects hung from pieces of string attached to nails embedded into the window frame, wavered slightly in the wind which was blowing gently through the open crack at the bottom of the window where I'd opened it. Most of the unpacking had been done last night luckily, with only a couple of boxes containing simple things such as bags and coats remaining; my clothing had been packed away into the large, oak chest of draws, and my ornaments I'd received as presents from Granny Kath sat along them in a small, neat row of carefully crafted pieces of art. My favourites were the dancing glass elephants, with little tutus glazed around their waists, the glass having been dyed a special pink colour for contrast. Looking so neat, prim and beautiful. Shaking my head slightly, so my hair could bounce out a little, I opened the top draw to rifle through my clothes. The clock which hung above my bed ticking quietly read 11:18 and I'd wanted known the journey would cause me to sleep in; besides, I wanted to get out today and explore town, or at least what remained of it, because I'd hoped to actually meet someone of my own age, or at least close to it, meaning I wouldn't have to spend all my time indoors surfing the internet or doing homework. Besides, I figured my gran wouldn't want me to come downstairs in a loose-fitting strappy top and a pair of shorts, it'd be incredibly awkward for the both of us, even with her being one of the kindest people I'd ever met. There are some things you don't want to see when it comes to family, and granddaughters in tank tops and shorts probably rank pretty high on that list as long as you're not counting situations involving nudity. Heat was still lingering in the already stuffy, uncomfortable atmosphere, so I knew today would be another lightly coloured clothing day. Wearing something like navy, or even a deep purple, would've been incredibly stupid on my behalf and, seeing as I've never been good during the heat, probably would've ended up with me fainting. Fishing through my draws, picking up pieces of clothing, inspecting them and deciding that I didn't want to wear them took longer than usual that morning; looking through my clothing collection, most of my chosen pieces were unfortunately darker coloured, meaning they weren't ideal summer clothing. My previous home had never gotten too warm, so I'd never needed a load of floral dresses or pure white shorts; I'd only ever needed navy jeans and deep grey jumpers. Lightly coloured, good summer clothing had never seemed too important to me. Until now. Eventually I was forced to settle with a black pair of shorts, although not ideal they were my only relatively comfy pair of denim shorts; and a white tank-top, although this one had a much snugger fit than the one I chose for bed attire. A simple white belt threaded through the shorts and a dark green pair of heeled Mary-Jane's, with white socks reaching my kneecaps to finish off the cutesy look, I was ready. I'd always been a safe driver, but my recent accident had made me even more cautious, despite the fact I hadn't been driving at the time of it. I practically ended up crawling round the corner at the end of the wooded lane which lead to my gran's house, nervously peering into the open, silent air, paranoid a random car was going to shoot round the bend and slam into my own. When I'd gotten up finally, I'd found that gran was still in bed and had simply written a simple note telling her I was heading out to the diner I'd seen on the side of a road about twenty minutes from her house, and had placed it on the table where I'd know she'd find it. I'd ended up scraping my hair out of my eyes with a velvet green hairband I'd found at the bottom of one of my boxes, one I hadn't used in years, but realised it went nicely with my shoes and, being a total perfectionist when it comes to my looks, decided to use it opposed to tying my hair back. On the way out the door, I'd subconsciously picked up a jacket, a habit I'd grown into after years of being used to a frosty nip in the air. Even in the summer it would occasionally grow a little bit cooler than any other place I'd ever been to, so picking up a jacket when I was due to go out was a deep settled habit I'd ended up having after years of living in a cooler place. The jacket, to my surprise, was another gift from my Granny Kath, which had only arrived last Christmas so it still fit; it was pleasantly surprising to know she knew my jacket size and so I still fit it when I tried it on and decided to keep it on. Of course, sweat immediately began to form, but going to a diner in a pair of shorts and a strappy t-shirt often radiated bad signals to others, who end up believing I'm up for being hit on. Of course this wasn't personal knowledge, but Annette knew all too well what it was like, and I often ended up listening to her advice. The jacket was dark green, a sort of murky colour, like the colour of swamp water and made out of leather, making it increase the amount of perspiration levels which formed on my upper body, especially my back. Beads of sweat had already begun to form on my skin, making my back itchy and leaning into the leather of the seat became very uncomfortable, but I knew I'd rather wear a heavy leather jacket opposed to having some perverted drunk try to feel me up. The jacket had zips at the ends of the sleeves which, when pulled back, exposed up to the highest point of my wrist; not very practical, but fashionable I guess. The main bit of decoration on the jacket was a large, golden eagle which had been stitched on with matching golden thread. All in all, it made me look partially badass, but my personality would immediately let me down. I silently thanked my gran in my head, loving her even more for buying me such lovely clothes and opening her home up to me. We hadn't spoken much over dinner, but I could tell she was pleased to have someone living with her now that my dad, aunt and uncle were off living their own lives in other parts of the state, or with my aunt, other continents of the world. All I gathered was that she was incredibly content in Prescott County, and was even more content now that I'd come out here to join her in her pretty, white wooden house, to keep her compassionate, friendly self company. I knew she had several friends in the main town area and had learned how to drive when she was fifty so she could visit them; she'd informed me there were several practical stores, a book shop, a couple of cafes, and some other things but clothes shopping had to be done in Winslow, the nearest largely populated town near Prescott County, which was a forty-five minute drive away from our house. It wasn't going to matter to me much though anyways; I had a large selection of fitting clothes and figured I'd only need to go there for a prom dress. Ouch. Now that was two scary thoughts in one: prom and dating. Or it would've been if I hadn't have seen yet more missing persons signs littering the wooden fences borderlining an old farm which aligned the highway. I think dad once mentioned he knew the owner there, Jack Taggert, whose younger son had died during the 1980's and he'd died at some point during the 90's, with his older son Jack Jr. taking over the farm after his death. Part of me theorised whether his younger son, Billy I think my dad had called him, was a victim of the all too well-known winged bat creature which apparently stalked the area but I tried to push that thought to the back of my mind. Winged, flesh-eating bat creatures weren't real and they never could be. Why? Because evolution had proved such ridiculous theories incorrect; there were no such things as immortal, winged bat men, or even still, winged demons. It was all totally fictitious , I told myself for the eighth time that day. Stepping on the gas pedal a little harder to increase my speed; and get past the cornfield a little faster, seriously those places always really creeped me out, I turned on the radio, probably as a form of distracting myself from my somewhat wilder imagination now that I was alone in the backward county without my dad in the car to comfort me about my winged, bat man fears. To my disappointment, the radio stations were all typical backwards style shows. There was a country music station which really wasn't to my taste by any standards; a conspiracy theory channel which rambled on about how the government was genetically creating werewolves which even I found hard to believe; one news station which only blared out the same depressing information about more disappearance's; and the rest were pretty much those three on repeat. All the music channels weren't my style, the other shows topics either baffled or frightened me, and the news was just depressing. The only other form of channel I found was just unfathomably bizarre hissing, static noises and I figured it wasn't connecting so I shut it off. I cursed myself mentally for leaving all of my CDs and the odd cassette I owned back in my room, and for being so naïve to think I'd actually enjoy any of the news stations found in this neck of the woods. Letting my imagination run wild was never an intelligent decision after discovering a giant, winged bat creature was stalking this neck of the woods, and all I could now think about was school. Some nagging idea at the back of my head told me everyone in my classes would automatically know who I was, and I figured that might be true; for some reason small towns always made that amazing ability of literally knowing who you were two seconds after arriving, look easy as pie. Judging by the odd bulletin board which flew past as I drove down the lane, I could figure out that my new school's baseball team mascot was a crow named Corny. Even by my standards, that seemed a little cheap, but based off what I'd heard from my uncle Stefan, who was a member of the baseball team, they never really played many games apart from the odd few against Prescott County's surrounding little towns like Walsh Falls, Colbat Cove and Miscousin who all also had baseball teams. I figured building a baseball field was possibly cheaper for the towns of backwood Florida, than building a football one so I figured it actually made sense. Luckily he told me Gym wasn't compulsory by the time of Junior year, so I wasn't going to be forced to, embarrassingly I might add, end up hitting every poor person in my path with a hockey stick. Part of my mind drifted back to the infamous Robert 'Rob' Alkins, daughter of the 'Town Witch', and regular mysterious guy who enjoyed keeping himself to himself. I wondered if he actually had any friends at Prescott County High, or whether he kept himself totally alone. If he was a member of any athletic teams or intellectual clubs; dad had informed me the school also offered clubs in the forms of a swim team, a cheerleading squad, and two music clubs, a chess team and a debate team. Naturally I figured all the games were played against Walsh Falls, Colbat Cove and Miscousin high schools but I guessed it must be nice knowing your opponents pretty well. Mixes the game up a little. Apparently the baseball team had gone to other places such as Texas and Louisiana a couple of times but they were mainly playing against the usual trio of opponents, despite actually winning all their games against other state baseball teams. Baseball was a refreshing change to the usual football squads most of the schools I knew of having, because I wondered if maybe baseball players were less hot-headed, arrogant and brash than footballers. I'd always found the art of baseball a little bit more graceful than football with all its practical fights with several boys or men fighting over a ball. In my opinion, English football seemed a lot safer. For some reason simply hitting a ball as far as you can, then running whilst other people ran to catch the ball and throw it down on a diamond so you could be declared 'out' seemed a lot safer than most other sports which mainly compose of smashing into each other. That must be why all the superstitious and incredibly paranoid parents here approved of baseball being the school's main sporting team. With that said, I was the sporting genius who could make volleyball seem dangerous, by accidentally smashing the ball into all my teammate's heads and shoulders when I hit it. Being caught up in my past life of accidentally attacking people with rubber sports balls almost made me completely miss the small diner situated off to the left of the main highway. Like the creepy old church, the building looked older than most of the houses, although nowhere near as ancient as that creepy demonic dwelling place. The words 'DINER' were lit up in bright, red, almost neon writing which was situated above the old place which looked straight up fifties; it seemed to be constructed of corrugated metal, with deep ridges aligning the outer sides, and the formerly probable shining grey coloured metal was now rusting and faded. Pulling my car into one of the surprisingly few parking spaces, I excited the car and looked around. Then it hit me-the cars were all making small, simplistic pit stops along the highway, like most people often do when they're taking a long trip and have neglected pre-packing food pre-setting off for the journey. My jacket was practically sticking to my skin now, but I'd rather be safe and not perved on, than cool yet harassed so I kept it tightly wrapped around my upper body area. Pushing the door open as quietly as I could, I was relieved that I didn't get immediate stares from everyone inside the building. Most of them were too caught up in their own conversations and/or eating their meals to pay some random seventeen year old attention when she entered the establishment. The only people who did stare were the waitresses' dresses in their turquoise uniforms, and the busboys in their entirely black getup. I figured the busboy job title was new because most the teenage boy's mulling around's uniforms seemed pretty makeshift-as long as you had a black sleeved t-shirt, black jeans, and a good pair of trainers, along with good manners, eligible writing and a competent memory, you got a job it seemed. Some of them were even smoking whilst delivering the food to the tables, so I figured it was pretty easy to get a job, even for someone as stupid as me. But another voice decided to bring me out of my thoughts. \"Hey new girl!\" An over excited, thickly southern accent called and I jumped, almost falling over due to the heels making it hard to jump without stumbling slightly. Did I mention I've not got exactly the best balance, and often end up falling over when someone makes me jump? Call me klutzy, I guess? Well, I think that was just a prime example. Before I could question who'd called my name, a boy, about my age jumped over the counter with all the grace of a cat prowling along a fence. Like me, his skin was pale, which stood out amongst all the tanned teens and sunburned adults who littered the room, at least all of those who were locals to the area. And I could tell he was local because he was wearing one of the now familiarized makeshift busboy outfits like the other four male teenagers circulating the room. All four of them had cast at least three glances my way so far. The boy in front of me's skin was so pale it was almost luminous, making me look positively rosy in comparison, and the more I looked at it, the more worried about him I became. He looked positively ill , he was so pale. Luckily the animated sparkle in his soft brown eyes the colour of fudge made me feel a little more comfortable in his company, and less worried about his health levels. His hair, which was a dark brown with a tinge of red to it, kind of like the fur of a seal, hung around straight and neatly brushed, sweeping just over his shoulder, having been tied back with a solid black hair bobble which stood out against the reddish-tinged brown of his hair. I figured it was for health regulations, so his hair didn't accidentally end up in someone's cheeseburger. His skin was riddled with some of the most amazing tattoos I'd ever seen; there was a large, spiralling combination of colours shaped like the pattern you see inside a kaleidoscope tattooed onto the side of his neck, with several dragons, unicorns and griffin's dancing up and down his arms. They were so spectacular I couldn't help but stare. \"Nice, eh, Noelle Manning?\" He grinned and I jumped, immediately staring up at him, my eyes widening as I looked up. \"How do you know my name…\" \"Small town!\" He interrupted cheerfully. \"And besides! You're the daughter of now deputy sheriff of the city of Oswell's, Lee Manning! Of course we were pre-informed of you!\" He held his hand out and I stared at it dumbly, but managed to take it in time before he believed I was mentally challenged or something along those lines. \"I'm James Camacho, but most people call me Jamie, even those who supposedly hate me!\" He laughed at that and I felt my eyes widen at his light hearted nature. \"I work here, live with my depressed, wretched mom in a caravan about four miles away from this diner and love horror more than your parents love you! Sorry, I'm forgetting myself!\" He shook my hand again, harsher and faster this time, grinning like a lunatic. \"Welcome to Prescott County, Florida!\" He flew his hands above his head all theatrical style and several people stared at that. \"Should've been more subtle I think…\" He snickered and I stared at him bemused. \"Does everyone here know my name and who my dad was? Or is it just you?\" I asked him cautiously, although I practically predicted his answer before he even spoke it. \"Pretty much everyone.\" He nodded. \"Believe me, in small towns like this, nothing gets passed no-one, and everyone knows everything about everyone!\" It seemed odd that he sounded so cheerful and optimistic, with his illuminated pale skin, maple brown hair draping across his shoulder, and the sparkling glimmer in his eyes. Especially with an apparent 'depressed, wretched mother', living in a most likely small, slightly cramped trailer, and being totally obsessed with the gory, gruesome, violent world of horror movies. People like him always bemuse people like me, and strike up that typical, bitter cord of envy within us; we wish to be like them-all sunny smiles, constant optimism, and laughing joyfully, happy about even the worst of things you could imagine. \"Probably got a few questions of your own, right?\" He questioned me and I simply nodded. \"Um…Yeah…Is there any advice you could give me about um…Starting school here?\" The constant pausing and mumbling made the sentence painfully longer than it needed to be but he didn't smile cruelly or role his eyes like most people would and stared blankly at me for a couple of seconds before finding an appropriate response. \"Good question!\" He grinned, that strong, happy quality hidden within his voice returning with such a smooth, sophisticated ease I immediately envied him a little more, although I knew that was childishly mean and incredibly unfair. \"I'd say…\" Another pause followed. \"Stay away from the cheerleaders, the entire fucking swim team-they're the most arrogant bastards you could ever imagine in your worst school themed nightmare; and the baseball teams captain, although the rest of the team are nice enough, and of course, there is our very own star fielder-Robert, aka Rob, Alkins.\" I froze and felt my eyes widen in a comical, almost cartoonish fashion. \"I'm guessing you've heard about mommy-fearest then, the practically famous Nicole Alkins?\" I nodded. \"My mom, Whitney Manning, then Whitney Peck, was sort of friends with her when she first came her in the 1980's, or so my dad says. Do you know anything about her?\" I asked him, my curiosity instantly peaking. To my disappointment he shook his head. \"Sorry, Noelle, I haven't got much on the illusive Nicole Alkins. I once took a trip down to her shop, Earth Child Emporium, on White Street but the second I walked in, she gave me this really evil stare and I ended up rushing out about two seconds later. I guess even the town horror nut pissess her off!\" I must've given him a confused or bemused look because he chuckled before answering. \"Basically, Nicole isn't a big fan of anyone, bar her son and your grandma-no offence.\" Jamie added quickly but continued speaking. \"It's nothing personal, she's just cautious after all those rumours and assumptions which came about after she reappeared in town with Rob, then a baby...\" \"Um...Not to seem incredibly brash!\" I muttered quickly after interrupting him so suddenly, with a new array of questions already swimming inside my mind. \"But, could you possibly tell me a little more about her son, Robert?\" I asked the last part quickly, trying to make it seem offhand and not like I'd been wondering it for quite some time, instead of running it over and over inside my head. Jamie Camacho's face broke into a grin and he looked incredibly mischievous, as if he knew he could get an interesting outcome from this situation. \"Sounds fair enough, but I'll only answer you if you explain what that little cast on your wrist symbolises?\" \"Car accident.\" I said quickly and one of those maple coloured eyebrows raised itself slightly amidst his cheerful, elfin features which constantly conveyed a constant sense of happiness and intelligent glee about them. \"I wasn't driving, my best friend, Kendell was. We'd been at a birthday party and she always was good at hiding at how much she'd drank…\" I trailed off before regaining the ability to talk again. \"Basically, she tried to skip a red light, a truck hit her car, and during the chaos I broke my wrist, as well as my leg. But as you can tell, the leg's healed, with the wrist not far behind it. Good job, I'm left handed eh?\" That comment made him laugh and he leaned back against the counter which stood, obviously unmoving behind him, an elfin grin shining out from his cleverly composed face. The rest of the diner were ignoring us, and I guess I liked it that way, because I'd rather be the bland furniture piece than the shiny toy everyone wants to manhandle and fuck around with for their own boredom and lack of things to do. \"So that's a shortened version of how I broke my wrist. It was actually what made my dad move me out here to live with my gran.\" \"I'm guessing he isn't a big fan of your best friend, right?\" He raised his eyebrow all over again and grinned, knowing he'd read me write. \"He's never been a fan of my friends, but I guess I agree. They were all a little too wild for a boring, rule-obeying girl like myself. I've always got good grades, handed in my projects on time, and haven't had one detention in all my schooling years. Kendell had at least three a week. We were very much divided in more ways than just appearance. Dad wanted me to make better, less wild friends and live somewhere that Kendell's somewhat troublesome attitude couldn't affect me I guess. So he chose his very own hometown.\" \"Fair explanation,\" Jamie nodded, \"And I guess I can even understand your dad's reasons.\" I nodded at that. \"Besides, I'd much rather be friends with a law-abiding, homework doing, detention-never-receiving type like you than your Kendell best friend forever. I get to look like a total badass!\" I smiled myself at that remark. \"But more importantly, you won't do stupid things that will make my neurotic mom worry anymore.\" The look on my face made him enter yet another detour away from the main subject. \"My mom was born with a high chance of depression, because both her mom, her granddad and ever her great-grandmother all had it, as well as two of her siblings, meaning she was high in the stakes of getting it. She had postpartum depression after having me, and it would've gone away in about six years but…When I was six my dad died in a car crash and she immediately spiralled back down again, and hasn't been the same since.\" His facial expression was slightly sad and wistful for the stories telling time, but it immediately returned to his smiling mask a couple of seconds after finishing, although his eyes were faded slightly, having lost their sparkle. \"She wrapped herself up in blankets, sitting in bed all day, whilst I wrapped myself up with horror films. Originally the classics- Dracula , The Wolf Man , Frankenstein , but eventually I got into the more conventional stuff like Halloween , Friday the 13 th and A Nightmare on Elm Street . You into horror?\" He asked optimistically, grinning with hope, and I had to disappoint him. \"Not really…\" I shook my head. \"Dad didn't ever let me watch it and when I did see it in secret at friends sleepovers or whatever, the blood made me feel really sick, even though it was fake. And then I'd always get massive nightmares and have to fake needing the loo at night whenever they woke me up so I wouldn't get teased.\" I shrugged. \"I don't have a problem with others liking them,\" I interrupted myself, stuttering quickly. \"But they're really not my thing…\" \"No problem!\" Jamie grinned like an extremely happy bunny and patted the top of my head, making me stare up at him, something I found a little strange. He was 5'9\", two inches taller than my 5'7\", and having the sensation of someone patting my head was a little strange for me, being taller than most of my female friends, and male ones too. \"Besides, I'd be happy to show you around school tomorrow,\" he offered hopefully and I figured he was someone mainly bullied, which he confirmed. \"Seeing as half the kids here think liking horror makes you a Satanist, I figured I might need a friend in some form and…Well, to be honest, I was kind of excited when I heard you were emigrating her. I figured I'd finally meet someone who didn't judge me for living in less than ideal circumstances-courteously of mom being too sick to work, liking horror-equalling devil worshipper, and of course-being gay.\" \"You're gay?\" I asked him, slightly surprised of this. He hadn't given off any signs regarding sexuality, and part of me had actually believed him to be asexual for the past twenty minutes of our conversation. \"Sorry…I didn't guess…\" \"Most people don't guess,\" he laughed and jumped up slightly so he was sitting on the countertop, hair flopping slightly in front of his eyes so he had to shake his head. \"But I am. And it means I'm every parent here's worst nightmare-one of those homosexuals ,\" he whispered the last word like it was incredibly taboo before bursting into laughter. \"I'm not kidding, people are actually like that, but , my sexuality isn't what you wanted to know!\" He tapped the side of his nose knowingly, the sparkle returning to his eyes quicker than a stream of light hitting a windowpane. \"We're here to discuss the always illusive, yet incredibly gorgeous , not to mention gifted sportsman, Rob Alkins.\" He gestured to the barstool next to him and I sat down on it after thanking him. \"Well, to be honest, I think…\" But something stopped him, and that something was the sound of the door's automatic jingling noise triggered whenever it was opened. A series of chimes and bells had been woven into one of the loose nails, alerting you whenever it was opened and I turned round in my seat. Everything about me seemed to just freeze; my blood stopped being pumped round my body via the heart, my lungs quit producing oxygen, and my brain just melted itself down. This had to be Robert Alkins. And he was a lot more attractive than I'd originally imagined him to turn out to be; I'd always figured witches children would look somewhat odd, but he was actually one of the normalest boys I'd seen in quite some while-if you didn't count his superior attractiveness or the strange cloud of malevolence which seemed to seep into the building the second he walked in. all the staff members, and locals, looked up, before all quickly turning their heads away; with the only exceptions being myself and Jamie. Several tourists stared, especially the young female ones, but they looked away after sensing the almost creepy aura which lingered around him. I'd never met someone so young who seemed so frightening or dangerous and never figured I would've, till then. His skin was chalky, even paler than my own and surprisingly Jamie's, seemingly practically sheet white against all the darkness of his other features. White as paper or swans or…Onion skin I figured at the time. His face was strong and almost sculpted, as if someone had been incredibly careful whilst creating him-maybe God, if he did exist, decided some of us should be attractively gifted much more than other more unfortunate people. It was all angular and sharp, as if nothing about him could be soft or delicate; the slight point at the end of his long, sleek nose, the almond shape of his eyes, his strong, pointed, jawline, the slight point at the end of his chin like that of his nose, and the prominently angular shape of his cheekbones. His lips were thin, curved into a slightly unimpressed sneer, something which diminished his attractiveness slightly, although it seemed as if only I could see that because when I looked back at Jamie, his eyes had clouded over dreamily. His hair was such a deep shade of brown I thought it was black until the light bounced off it and the chocolate colouring shone vibrantly through, and cut neatly, with a fringe and being shorter at the back, matching the creamy brown of his eyes, which were like chocolates. His entire darkly coloured getup made him look incredibly chalkier than normal, with the only exception being his burning crimson shirt which had sloppily cut sleeves. The darkness of his black jeans, black converses and black leather, fingerless gloves was blinding against his pale skin and I swallowed thickly. \"Beautiful, right?\" Jamie whispered in my ear and again I jumped at how close he'd suddenly got, although this time it was incredibly embarrassing because I managed to fall off my stool and land on the floor with an echoing thud; people automatically stared and I felt all my blood swill inside my cheeks, turning them a mottled red to match my ears, but I couldn't take my eyes off him. He was sniffing the air, his nostrils flared, but the ever embarrassing consequences of my clumsy nature made him turn to face me and his eyes widened, dilating slightly. He looked at me, his face a mixture of amazement and horror, before slowly backing away towards the door and exciting smoothly, jumping onto his… White 66 Harley Davidson . I froze on the inside. \"What was that?\" Jamie giggled, staring down at me from my oh-so not embarrassing position of sitting on the floor, my eyes fixed on the door. \"Why did he look at you like that?\" He held out his hand and helped my haul myself off the floor. \"Don't you want to know my theory about him?\" He asked hurriedly and I nodded, although my mind was elsewhere. I'd just possibly angered the son of Prescott County's witch and tomorrow I had the task of facing him at school.

Hope you're enjoying my work, and please R & R. I'm not making a profit, sadly, but I hope you enjoy it anyways! Paranoia had gripped its usual talons around me as I lay in bed that night, the image of Robert Alkins white 66 Harley Davidson running through my mind like when someone puts a CD track on loop. Even Jamie's crazy story hadn't drifted my mind away from the chilling image of him hopping on the bike and riding off, his entire body shaking violently, as if trying desperately to control himself. The way he'd backed up, those dark brown eyes boring into me, staring me down as if he was both horrified and terrified by my mere presence in that backwood diner. As for Jamie's theory? He'd got the bright idea that Rob was actually the winged creatures, known as The Creeper by the locals, biological son and was searching for the flesh of humans to feast on like his father before him. Although based off the stories I'd heard from my dad and gran, I figured if Rob Alkins was consuming anything just plain fucked up, it was performance enhancing drugs. Even by my standards of frightening, that was a little far-fetched. But it didn't stop that image of the bike repeating in my brain, running itself over and over, stuck on a constant loop. I'd fashioned a rather ugly bruise on my right thigh after my less than graceful barstool fall, which I'd cleverly concealed from my nan so she didn't ask any awkward questions which would have led to my shameful explanation. We'd had a rather pleasant, simplistic dinner of sweet potatoes, chicken casserole with steamed vegetables, after which I'd done the washing up and gone upstairs to have a bath, wash my hair, dry it with my hairdryer, and then go to bed. All before ten o'clock; early I know, but I thought getting an early night would improve my mindset, but my ridiculous memory put a rather abrupt halt to my plans. Somehow having brief, yet pleasant conversations, then departing in our own directions worked better for me and Granny Kath. Maybe that was because we'd barely known each other for the past couple of years and I was still settling in, so she was giving me some breathing space? That sounded a lot like something dad would do. But my overactive imagination made the simple act of trying to sleep near impossible. I kept imagining what this 'Creeper' looked like, with the only constant feature which remained being the large, scaly, almost reptilian like wings extending from his back, illuminated by an eerie white light which seemed to burst out of nowhere-as if a stage queue which was waiting for the appearance of him , it , whatever it was. A cold, irritating sweat seeped over my body at about 11:45 and made me wriggle uncomfortably in my new bed, curling my legs up to my chest, resting my head on the tops of my knees, trying to make myself as small as possible so the irritancy would get smaller too. Even wearing a plain grey vest top and light blue baggy shorts the sweat seemed to pile up, clinging to my skin in its usual sticky coating, collecting in large, uncomfortable droplets on the back of my bare neck, despite my hair being tied tightly back behind my head in a ponytail. Something about Rob Alkins had made me incredibly uncomfortable to the point my skin prickled just at the thought of him, as I attempted to rationalize why he'd been outside the church that Friday. He was probably just doing what my dad used to do , I told myself. Hanging around there because it'd be quiet and maybe he was waiting for friends, or they'd already arrived, or something along those lines. That bought up another question: Did Rob Alkins actually have any friends? Being one of the best runners on the baseball team I figured he'd at least have one close friend, and probably a large fanbase as well. When you're an excellent sportsman, especially someone who has the capability to win many games, you're bound to have a large amount of followers buzzing around you, asking you questions, beginning for autographs in some circumstances I figured. In my hometown of Oswell, that would've never happened, but here, I figured a lot more things might just be possible. I mean, these people believed a giant, winged demon loomed the highway skies, picking out its prey based all around fear-why wouldn't they do anything a little bit more abnormal? Even by my standards. It was 1:48 precisely when I finally managed to calm my nerves and get some sleep, although part of me was dreading that more than being forced to stay awake all night. Nightmares were steadily beginning to form in my mind even before I finally managed to start feeling a familiar warm, sleepy feeling rush over my body. That lulling feeling which would inevitably drag me back into the world of dreams, where anything could be waiting, especially winged bat men wanting to grab me- STOP! I told myself. It's all just one big stupid legend made up by a load of drunken town loonies and Rob Alkins isn't that things son! Jamie's probably been watching one too many horror films! I quickly rationalized that part at least. Due to his, self-admitted, tendency to get a little too into the films he watched, it was obvious how Jamie could've just let them get to him and made him believe Rob Alkins wasn't entirely human. Besides, I figured if Rob Alkins wasn't human, there'd be a lot of missing persons circulating this here area, and Nicole would've moved away to a bigger city where there'd be more prey for him to hunt. Yawning slightly, with the sheets tangling themselves around my creamy, slender legs, my eyes begun to flutter shut, my vision blurring slightly and I knew sleep was winning a battle which was already pretty futile, even by my shitty standards of the word. Rob Alkins is a hundred percent human , I told myself, and then I began repeating it inside my head a smooth, solid movement of words swirling over and over. Rob Alkins is a hundred percent human. Rob Alkins is a hundred percent human. Rob Alkins is a hundred per… The weather had gone through a bipolar episode when I finally opened my eyes at 7:12 the next morning. A light, greyish-blue mist had settled over Prescott County, and the beginnings of a refreshing drizzle were starting to form, something which greatly uplifted my mood-drizzle was familiarized territory for me, something which reminded me of home and comforted me slightly. Although I could practically hear all the kids across the large sprawl of the open countryside county groan, I didn't care at all. The drizzle hadn't evolved properly into rain yet, so I was safe to venture outside without getting soaked to the skin first, although my ever growing collection of waterproof coats and jackets. Owning a good pair of waterproof boots helped my life become a little bit simpler, and I figured I had somewhat of an edge compared to my new classmates. Untying my plat and picking up my black plastic hairbrush I began raking through the locks of my reddening brown hair, although mine was a little more on the brown side of the scale compared to Jamie's maple colour. Staring into the mirror, I finally recognized how pale I looked compared to the dark blues, purples, and the odd greens of my new room. I'd managed to make my room much more personalised over Saturday, and I hadn't left the house that day, sorting through objects and arranging them neatly, meaning Sunday was the day I'd adventured outside to explore my new surroundings which ended up with me becoming twice as paranoid as I had been before. A horrible sick swelling began to form in my stomach as I raked through my clothes, after the dawning realisation that I was going to be forced to see Rob Alkins today, regardless of my nerves. I couldn't hide away from school forever, cooping myself up in my room, pretending none of the events of yesterday had happened. I hoped maybe we could end up on better terms today and maybe work our way around the awkwardness between us. Fumbling through the pieces of clothing which made up my outfit menagerie made me smile slightly to myself-dark clothing looked better on foggy, drizzly days such as today, and I figured I'd accomplish fitting in much better today than I had yesterday-that was in the hope I didn't successfully fall over or do something equally as stupid. I was going to be at reception for nine o'clock so I could know where my first class was at ten past; I'd been told by my dad that, like in Oswell, there were four classes in the morning each an hour long, with one in the afternoon after the hour and ten minute lunch break, then I'd be free to return home. The day sounded pleasant enough, especially because PE wasn't forced upon students at Prescott County High. Flipping through my extensive waterproof jackets, I decided my light blue one was probably the best if I wanted to fit in. Dark brown, dark blue, or even medium green would seem a little too dark coloured for people around these parts standards; I hadn't even seen the kids, but something told me they'd all be in lightly coloured jackets, maybe even with matching handbags to accomplish their colour coordinating clothes. Part of me smiled at that. Colour coordinating all your outfits amused me for some reason-it was just so perfectionistic. I picked out my light grey, swishing with light blue, t-shirt to go with my light blue jacket and decided that my navy blue jeans worked best, finishing off the outfit with my black waterproof boots. A little too dark, but they were my best pair. Breakfast was quiet and simple for both me and my nan, but luckily lacked an awkward tone which could've followed. Nan asked me a couple more questions 'was I nervous about school?', 'did I meet anyone at the diner yesterday?', things along those lines worked best for all of us. I told her about Jamie and she shook her head sadly; she knew his mother, Sonya Camacho, and felt bad for her in the state she ended up at after the untimely death of her husband, Dexter. Apparently it'd been a truck which had hit his car, killing him on impact and I'd nodded sympathetically as she'd told me, listening to all the somewhat gory details. I neglected the part about Rob Alkins for both of our sakes-I didn't want her worrying about anything going on in my life, because it wouldn't be good for her health. She kept an array of pictures on the top of her kitchen cabinets-one of her own wedding to my deceased grandfather, Patrick; one of my parents on their wedding day, my mom's usually straight, dark brown hair curled into a series of ringlets around her glowing face, my dad grinning, his purpley-blue eyes glowing with happiness; another photograph of my Uncle Stefan and Aunt Isla's wedding, my uncle's eyes which matched my father's sparkling more than glowing, and my aunt looking incredibly picturesque with her long lace veil trailing around her white-blonde hair; yet another wedding photo, only this time of my Aunt Jess and Uncle John on their wedding, both looking incredibly young at just twenty one, my aunt hadn't inherited the traditional blue eyes, but her own pale green ones ignited the beauty of her face, with my uncle looking much more laid back with his shortly shaven black hair practically stubble. The only other photos were composed of school pictures taken of Luke, Annette and myself; Uncle Stefan and Aunt Isla's kids, my cousins, Henry-now sixteen, and Celeste-now fifteen; with a final complementary set of Aunt Jess and Uncle John's only daughter, Olivia. It was strange seeing myself with gappy teeth aged five, and my cheeks chubby like a chipmunks, my dark hair pulled back into a ponytail as I grinned animatedly for the camera placed in front of me; it was stranger still seeing Luke aged nine with his dark, ringlet style curls brushing in front of his face as he grinned mischievously for the camera, back then I could never imagine him marrying at twenty one; but stranger still was seeing Annette when she was nine, with her sandy blonde straight hair swinging down past her shoulders, her pale, china doll like innocence shimmering through the glossy glass framing. You would've never guessed she'd end up nearly on drugs and having to spend time in a 'clinic' for bipolar disorder induced via excessive stress; but it was a pleasant surprise that she'd been able to get her life back on track, and was now attending art college. Sometimes I never understand why men don't flock around my beautiful older sister, with her total perfection and the sheer amount of head turning she did upon entering a room, like she possessed some bizarre magically ability when it came to making people automatically find her attractive. Standing at an incredibly impressive 6'1\" for a nineteen year old girl, with the build of someone who should be found in underwear catalogues, and probably one of the worst big sisters you could ever imagine appearance wise. Not to mention she's practically the most beautiful girl on earth, at least by my current standards. Sure, I don't know too many people, especially female ones, but based upon looking at most women you see on the street, I've figured that she must be at least in the Top 10 of \"10 'Normal' Women Who Are Completely Gorgeous\". Pale, like me, with a creamy peachy tinge to her skin which my ivory-skinned pallor could never accomplish having; having my heart-shaped face and slim jawline, but she possesses strong cheekbones and a smaller nose, with fuller, rose petal lips. Her eyes however, aren't the purpley-blue Luke and I have, instead mom's warm hazel tinted with navy blue. Her face is outlined with long wavy blond hair that falls halfway down to the middle of her back that perfectly suits her hazel-blue eyes and perfected figure. Even when she was washed out and borderline on drugs, she still managed to look apathetically innocent and tortured, unlike Luke or myself who'd just look like drugged up junkies. I guess I envy my big sister, but have come to accept there's nothing I can change about myself, at least through legal means. Grabbing my blue satchel on the way out, calling goodbye to my grandma, I excited to my car and began the twenty-something minute drive to my school. But it didn't stop the already swelling feeling of sickness and panic which was beginning to develop within my stomach the second I stepped inside my car. Despite the student body being incredibly low in number, it didn't diminish my fear of them all. In small towns, everyone's been to school with everyone and outsiders are never welcome; I can only scrimp these lines because of who my father is. Even then I wasn't too sure people were going to be too accepting when I finally arrived at the school. Increasing the speed of my car, nervous I'd be late, my head turned to the side automatically, staring out into the countryside; there was a larger selection of houses in the direct Prescott town, most of which housed the children who attended the junior and high schools. I figured myself; Jamie and Rob Alkins were some of the few people who lived outside the main town circuit. It was helpful that the school wasn't hard to miss, being located on the very outskirt of the town, probably so children from the countryside area could also find the school just as easily as the inner town kids. The school wasn't like many schools I'd attended; it wasn't split into separate blocks like my previous school, it was just one huge, slightly squarish shaped building, built from several tan coloured bricks with a corrugated white roof. The parking lot was full of cars already, with two stereotypical yellow school buses off just to the side. Several trees and shrubs surrounded the place, simply because it was located on the edge of the local swamp. I remembered how Jamie had told me that the school often attended school trips out to the swampland to study the deer, frogs and birds which lived out there, as well as the plants and checking that the water wasn't dangerous for the animals. On the odd occasion they were allowed to do outside lessons within the swamp, which were fun, but only sport trips were really done for the various teams. Drawing my car into one of the free parking spaces, I gently opened my car door and shut it behind me, locking the door carefully before I began walking forwards towards the building situated at the very front of the school. Located just off to the side of the main entrance was a little building extended onto the side of the school with the words 'RECEPTION' neatly blocked out on a small banner over the set of double doors located at the front. I figured that this was where I needed to go to collect my timetable. The rain was still at drizzle level, meaning I was tolerating the weather, but a lot of the other kids looked unhappy and uncomfortable because rain wasn't a regular even out here, as I'd 'oh so cunningly figured out'. I got the odd glance, but luckily no-one paid me too much attention, probably because they hadn't truly figured out who I was, not just yet. Inside it was warm and I enjoyed the feeling of hot air creeping up my skin, numbing the chilling cold of the outside, and little droplets of drizzle stained the glass, sliding down pitifully. Like all school offices, its walls were covered in little awards and certificates, and a large ticking clock sat on the wall, displaying the time for anyone who entered. The floor was carpeted, a standard bluey-green colour, nothing too extravagant. Several plastic grey chairs littered the sides of the room, and a couple of plants hovered around the main desk area which was situated directly opposite the door. The harsh wind which whipped through the air stopped the second I wrenched the reception room's door open and stepped inside, my hair flailing out around my head madly like someone had directly stuck a couple of hairdryers around me and switched them onto the highest wind level. Cold wind shot through the room, making the secretary at the desk shiver. She was a young woman, only about twenty-eight, with a long stream of coal black hair tied into a neat plat which swept round the side of her face and went well with her beige coloured eyes. Dressed in a light pink blouse and black pencil skirt, she was tapping carefully away at her computer, eyes fixated upon it. Her skin was creamy, like milk chocolate and as I got closer, I could see there was a name tag attached to her pink blouse; it had the name 'Stephanie Finch' written on it, and I was surprised that she wasn't simply Ms, Miss or Mrs Finch. Maybe people were just more informal out here, I couldn't tell yet. \"Um…Excuse me?\" I asked, somewhat nerves detectable in my voice, but I tried to null them down so she didn't think I was anywhere near as frightened as I felt. The sound of my voice made her look up, her dark eyes hitting me and studying my face, confusion passing across her face when she didn't immediately recognized me how she probably could recall every teenager who came into this office's name. \"Yes, may I help you?\" Her voice was polite and calm, although her accent originated somewhere from the north of America, not the southern drawl the likes of myself or Jamie possessed. \"I'm Noelle Manning, the new student,\" I added the last part on the end just in case she didn't realise I was the new student. I then realize how patronizing that must've sounded and cursed myself inside my head; I couldn't believe I'd possibly gotten off on the wrong foot with Ms Finch, but luckily she didn't seem too peeved at my response, and instead sorted through a carefully sorted wrack of paper, finally pulling out a sheet which had my timetable on it and politely leaned forwards, leaving it suspended in the air and I took it from her hand. \"There you go,\" she nodded politely. \"Thank you.\" Was my quiet response, although her sharp ears must've picked up on it before I turned to leave, on which she called out to me. \"Excuse me! I also have a map of the school if you'd like it?\" That made me turn around and head back towards the counter of which her desk was hidden behind. Several photos cluttered the desk, as well as a plushie lizard, and several stationary pieces were positioned around the computer. Two other secretaries sat further back in the office and I realised the building was bigger than I'd originally perceived; they probably took turns serving at the main desk so all of the work wouldn't be forced on Stephanie Finch. I politely took the map out of her hands and smiled, which she returned, before I turned around and ventured back out into the cold, drizzling air. Some secretaries go through the school route but something told me that Stephanie was new to the job, so she didn't know everything about the job. She simply told me to have a nice day and I replied with a slightly overused 'you too' before leaving the office properly, venturing into the rain which had deeply increased since I'd accepted a map from Ms Finch. The rain was pelting down in bigger drops and smacking against the parking lots tarmac, but I tried to ignore it and took a brief glance at the timetable I'd been so courteously given by Stephanie Finch. More students had arrived by now, but I tried to ignore them, and they ignored me luckily as I walked back to my expensive car. To my relief, there were other expensive looking cars parked in the lot, most much more pricey looking than mine. I hated to think how much my car had cost dad, but I tried to reassure myself that he worked as a deputy sheriff, so he'd got enough income to support himself and mom, especially because she also worked which was a relief. My rain boots made sloshing noises as I walked across the puddles which were quickly forming now, my first lesson was Biology with a Mr Allen, and I was feeling slightly more optimistic about it than other classes. Biology had been my favourite science class since I started high school, so it was relieving that it was my first lesson every day; checking back to my time table, it was actually my last lesson as well. Inbetween sat Maths with Mrs Blair, English with Mr McPherson and Art with Mr Swanson for me, and I hoped Jamie might be in at least one of those three classes with me so I had someone to actually speak with. It was strange the way I had these five lessons every day, never changing, but I figured they weren't too bad, even by my standards. \"Hey Noelle!\" A familiar voice called and I turned around to see Jamie Camacho walking towards me, although skipping might be the more appropriate term now that I look back on it. He was smiling as if it was his naturally programmed response to all situations, although the cheery disposition he seemed to carry himself with fit perfectly like a glove. Dressed like some bizarre Slipknot homage, he grinned at me; entirely black, his outfit, but it didn't surprise me too much to be honest. \"Loving the car still,\" he grinned and nodded before glancing back at his own means of transport-a black, rather old looking bicycle. \"Pretty pitiful, isn't it!\" He laughed though, not moping like most people would. \"But I love it,\" he nodded, \"I think it's just fine for me!\" \"Don't you have a car?\" I asked, trying not to seem incredibly snobby or rude, instead sounding awkward and stumbling, but he just laughed it off and I relaxed. \"Well, yeah, but mom won't let me use it.\" He sighed, running a hand through his long hair which hung around his shoulders and fluffing it outwards slightly, how girls sometimes do but less effeminate. \"Because dad died in a car accident she refuses to let me so much as edge towards the car without her being in it with me. Dad was a criminal speeder and that was what ended up killing him; he was going at over a hundred mph down one of the back roads situated around this place-probably just for fun, y'know-and he ended up swerving out the way so he didn't hit a deer…His car hit a tree and…He died on impact. So, if you can't guess, I fucking hate deer!\" He laughed at that but there was a sad, somewhat lonely undertone to his voice I detected the second his lips pursed to let out a laugh. \"I'm sorry!\" It was an automatic response on my behalf. \"You must really think people like me are so fucking stupid for having friends who get them into car accidents,\" I held up my wrist and he laughed slightly, shaking his head. \"I don't hate anyone, Noelle,\" he smiled and this time, to my relief, it was genuine. \"I just think my dad was being stupid-as per usual. He thought driving like a lunatic was a good pastime and look where that got him: dead and buried. Of course, he didn't know it was going to do that, but if you plan on driving at over seventy on a thirty road, you've kind of got it coming. I'm more surprise he didn't get anyone else hurt during his time on the road,\" Jamie nodded. \"I mean, if you're gonna be a shit driver, at least don't endanger others, but he did. I'd often be stuck in the car with him when he was driving like a maniac; being a little kid however, I thought it was all a game and if he hadn't died well…I might've ended up driving just like him. Anyways!\" His bright smile returned and he gestured to the pieces of paper in my hand. \"Mind if I see your schedule? See if you're stuck with me in any classes?\" \"Oh sure,\" I smiled, feeling slightly flustered and passed him my schedule, which he closely studied, eyes flicking over the lessons. \"Oh god I pity you…\" He muttered under his breath before tutting slightly, shaking his head and staring back at me, his face solemn. I felt my stomach drop and my eyes widen at his disappointed, or should that be upset, facial expression. \"You're stuck in all my classes!\" At that I burst out laughing, my hair falling in front of my face loosely, briefly clouding my vision before I looked back up at him, smiling. \"I don't think that's a bad thing,\" I smiled at him and he smacked me on the arm lightly, grinning like a maniac. \"In fact, I'm very happy I have you with me! You can protect me from all those evil swim club members you were warning me about yesterday!\" With that it was his turn to burst out laughing and he wrapped his arm around my shoulder, hugging me slightly to him, still chuckling. \"For a sheriff's kid, you're pretty funny!\" He grinned down at me. \"And for a drunk's kid you're pretty funny too!\" That just made him laugh harder and I relaxed slightly, jokes like that can go either ways, and I'd put my neck on the line making it; if the payoff had failed, I could've lost my only friend I'd made in this town. \"No offense though,\" I added quickly, just to be save. \"I could never dream of offending you!\" \"Don't apologize,\" he smiled down at me. \"At least you're humouring me and not teasing me like so many people. Besides,\" he added with another grin, only this one was more excitable and there was a glint in his eye which told me something. \"I do have some friends,\" he nodded as if affirming it to himself. \"Yep! Believe it or not! Good old freaky James Camacho has accomplished the art of making friends. Why am I telling you this now, Ms Manning? Well, I just saw one of them role his sorry ass into the parking lot!\" The way he called me 'Ms Manning' reminded me slightly of James Bond and Miss Moneypenny-although I figured Jamie and I's relationship was very much similar. \"Korey motherfucking Martin and Veronica bitchy Alkins!\" He waved at a boy and girl getting out of a car-some silver make of a Volvo, but I've never been too accurate with cars. \"You call your friends that?\" I asked Jamie; surprised he could be so rude to the boy I assumed was his best friend and the girl I assumed was at least his close friend. \"Oh naturally!\" Jamie nodded as the boy known as Korey headed over, whilst the girl, Veronica, stayed, clearly locking the car which must've been hers'. There was something about Korey which reminded me of Jamie to an extent; his hair, like Jamie's, was longer than most boys I've known's, only it just brushed his jawline, like it'd recently been cut. He was 5'6\", an inch smaller than me which made me feel slightly embarrassed, and the brightest hazel eyes I'd ever seen. Unlike Jamie, his face was much more adult looking though, much sharper and defined, and he was dressed in more conventional clothing. Black waterproof, navy jeans, brown hiking boots. He had a backpack slung over his shoulder, bright red, and looked slightly confused when he saw me. \"This is Sheriff Manning's daughter!\" Jamie called, and Korey simply nodded, only speaking when he finally reached us. \"I pity you,\" he chuckled, \"being stuck with Jamie all alone-you must have a strong spirit to put up with him. Noelle right?\" I nodded and he stuck out a hand which I graciously took. \"I'm Korey Martin, as Jamie explained,\" he shot a false glare in my oldest friend here's direction, \"And the girl faffing with the car back there is my boyfriend's adoptive sister, Veronica Alkins.\" A large bang sounded, followed by the irritating blare of a car alarm and a lot of cursing. Veronica wasn't agreeing with the car. \"You're gay?\" I asked, trying not to sound rude or homophobic in any means. \"Sorry!\" I added quickly, \"I just didn't figure I'd meet to gay people attending one school who were practically best friends.\" Both of them laughed, but it was Korey who answered my statement. \"In a town like this, we gay guys have to stick together! Normally, I'd try and keep as far away from this horror film psycho as I could, but no-one else accepted me when I arrived just under a year ago, so I was stuck with this bastard ever since.\" He chuckled, before looking back at Veronica, who had finally managed to get the car under control but was walking off in another direction; long blood red hair was flying off in opposite directions as she ran for cover from the wind and rain which had hit hard. \"Don't mind Alkins,\" he said it in a way which made me know she was referred to by her surname and not her first. \"She hates the rain-always has. Almost as much as Pazuzu.\" \"Pazuzu?\" I asked, bewildered. \"Oh sorry!\" Korey smacked his forehead. \"Pazuzu's my boyfriend and Alkin's adoptive brother, they all live with Ms Alkins on her giant farm with her son, Rob.\" My stomach plummeted at that-I was now in direct contact with Robert Alkins…The boy who'd looked at me like I was a meal and who I'd seen outside the creepy, demon church. \"Do you hang out with your boyfriend's adoptive family much?\" I asked, trying not to let my nerves show but Jamie went and revealed it all anyways. \"We had a run in with Gorgeous Alkins yesterday,\" he said cheerily, \"And he gave Noelle this really weird look. It was like he wanted to fuck, kill, then eat her all for his own sexual amusement!\" I shuddered at that and he patted my shoulder. \"No offence, Noe, but…That was the vibe I picked up from him.\" \"You should be flattered!\" Korey interrupted, obviously trying to lighten the tone significantly from the dark drop it'd taken. \"Rob barely looks at anyone these days, bar his family, me and Jamie. If you can make him look like he wants to have sex with you, it's a complement-although a strange one. People thought I was weird for attracting Pazuzu because he never seemed interested in anyone til he met me, you get used to it.\" \"How many of them are there?\" I asked, voice practically a whisper, and my voice trembled slightly. \"The Alkins family I mean…\" \"Six altogether, if you count Ms Alkins,\" Korey answered, and I figured it'd be him. He knew the family better-he was dating one of the members for Christ's sake! \"Four adoptive children-Pazuzu, his real name's Patrick but I nicknamed him that, like the demon from Exorcist 2 because his mom looks like Linda Blair; Alkins-the older girl, she's okay but can be either incredibly grumpy or incredibly annoying, sometimes both if you're unlucky; Alastor-the eldest boy, and he's not at school anymore, he manages the store for their mom whilst she's painting; and then there's Emily-Rose, the youngest girl, and she's in the year below us, the nicest I'd say, as well as most approachable. Pazuzu and Rob are both in our year, Emily's a Junior, whilst Alkin's actually a teaching assistant now, and Alastor's turning twenty in December.\" \"They're like the Cullens in Twilight !\" Jamie laughed and we both stared at him, before Korey continued talking whilst Jamie chuckled at his joke. \"Well, if this is Twilight , I'm Bella to Pazuzu's Edward,\" that made me laugh and Korey smiled at me. \"Seriously though, don't take Rob giving you a bit of a weird look negatively, in fact, like I said, see it more as a complement. Barely any of the girl's here get his attention, so if you can get it just by being a room, you're different to say the least. You in all of Jamie's lessons?\" Korey asked. \"Yep,\" was my response. \"Well, you're with me too!\" He grinned, \"And if you're lucky, you'll be put with me in most classes. I figured they'd stick Manning next to Martin!\" He looked at Jamie who'd begun to walk towards the school, although he was approaching a small gaggle of teens, which I realised were the Alkins' family and my stomach clenched but Korey smiled at me. \"Jamie's lucky enough to be sat next to Rob in Art and he never shuts up about it. He's um…\" Korey faltered and stared ahead, blinking quickly, as if he was nervous. \"He's liked Rob for a long time and at one point it looked like Rob was interested, til yesterday apparently…Don't know why.\" Korey shook his head. \"But it's awkward at lunch when we sit with them now. Just…Try and ignore that, kay? It's not your fault if Rob's taken a liking to you, and Jamie won't care too much. Plenty more fish in the sea, eh?\" On that note the bell rang and he grinned at me, face softening. \"Well, shall I walk you to class my fair lady?\" With that all I could do was laugh and nod. That went better than I expected.[Chapter 4] Disclaimer: I don't owner Jeepers Creepers, nor any of the original content which can be found within this fic, they all belong to Victor Salva.

The one period most high school age people seem to love, yet I was dreading it with a horrifying passion so deep it almost scared me. I knew why I was dreading it so strongly, of course I did, but that didn't help numb the fear which had been bubbling deep within my stomach from extinguishing itself by any means. I was going to see Robert Alkins. Korey had smiled politely at me for most lessons, asked me simple questions about my family which I answered as truthfully as I could without making my family seem like a total dysfunctional mess, and helped explain to me what position of learning the class had reached; I noticed many children from one of my classes would then be in another, and that was probably because of the schools smallness, meaning everyone knew everyone. Jamie enjoyed smirking flirtatiously at me, although I knew it meant nothing, and tried to make conversation with said Robert Alkins for most of Art, but the boy mainly shrugged off his questions with a somewhat rude dismissal and simply stared down at his sketch book. Navy blue made his pale skin have a blue tinge to it in the Art rooms entirely natural lighting forms; great beams shimmering through the large, expertly cleaned classroom windows, although Rob seemed to hate it and squirmed uncomfortably as if it hurt whenever a beam directly touched his open skin. Occasionally he'd look up at me, as if questioning why I was daring to look at him for such long periods of time, and I'd be forced to drop my gaze away, deeply ashamed. By the end of art, I'd only managed a few measly outlines of the taxidermy black birds we were studying, although Mr Swanson seemed to grant me a benefit of the doubt, being the new girl. A lot of teachers seemed to grant me this if I didn't know what the class was studying, despite my sheepish efforts of apology and the scalding blush which shot outwards from my cheeks, splashing all the way up to my ears, leaving me to squirm uncomfortably as I wondered how to approach lunch without him believing me to be a total stalker. Originally, I considered feigning sickness or flat out refusing to accompany Korey and Jamie to lunch with their unusual friends, but what would that look like? That I was an ungrateful bitch? That I was frightened of one boy giving me funny looks? That I was just selfish? My stomach was clenching so tightly that by the end of Art that I could genuinely claim I was going to vomit, as the sudden sloshing and whooshing within my stomach was telling me; but that would be cowardly and letting my internal anxiety's win would just make them come back twice as worse when I next had to face Rob. Gran had pre-packed my lunch in my satchel, which I noticed was beginning to look a little too worn for comfort; and that meant I didn't have to que, which would save a lot of time, and meant if I did vomit, it wouldn't be school food-making me look bad or possibly even snobbish in front of my peers. Korey's arm was practically propping me upright as we walked down the pale blue and white hallway together, which lead to the cafeteria; Jamie had rushed on ahead, still attempting to make small talk with Rob, which was evidently failing, even by body language on Rob's behalf, and every so often he'd turn round, casting those lovely eyes on me, although the stare wasn't. It was hungry-hungry with sexual desire and primal hunger, which made my skin break out in goosebumps, and I squirmed slightly, although Korey mustn't have noticed, because he didn't make any comment. That look reminded me of the rather macabre conversation Korey and another student, Billy Utah I think his name was, had been having during Art; Billy and Korey weren't friends by any means, but they both shared common ground-disgust and fear-regarding the subject of the conversation. Apparently there had been some murders back in my hometown, Oswell, and that was what struck me harder; three drug dealers had been attacked savagely during the early hours of Sunday morning, and it hadn't been pretty. They'd been torn to shreds. Parts of them eaten. Great! A cannibal serial killer was now out there for my dad to catch! I hadn't dared add to the conversation, mainly listening and hoping my face didn't become too ashen due to the topic, which it either didn't or Billy and Korey just didn't notice because neither of them asked me any questions, thank God! The shock of the murders had probably made me even more shaky, which was possibly why Korey had offered to take my arm; I figured he might've guessed that I wasn't too comfortable hearing about murders which happened in my own town, and knew I probably wouldn't be feeling too stable. It was an incredible miracle Korey even managed to drag me into the cafeteria without me collapsing in the hallway, probably dragging the poor boy down with me because I was an inch above him on the height scale. Jamie would occasionally cast a glance backwards, but I doubted he was too preoccupied regarding my welfare; he was too wrapped up in attaining Rob Alkins' attention to be paying a wobbly girl all his undivided attention. Even as we entered the cafeteria, he didn't turn round, his eyes transfixed on Rob Alkin's a hundred percent perfectionised beauty; Rob, not surprising me with his behaviour, simply stared ahead, seemingly unaffected by the blinding, shiny whiteness which made up the cafeteria. It was littered with several long, pale grey coloured rectangular tables, with white benches lining them. Two benches would be pushed together, although people had clearly shoved extras on whenever they needed them; and groups of teenagers clustered around them, talking, arguing, shouting and laughing all at once so it joined together, forming one overpowering booming bark which rang through the air. I was immediately able to pick out which table was the Alkins' families however, there was no mistaking which table they'd claimed as their own; two teenagers were sitting at the table, both on opposite benches, talking in hushed tones. They both had untouched food trays sitting in front of them, and were oblivious to everyone else, although I could pick their features out from a mile off, they were so striking; the girl, Emily-Rose if I'd remembered her name correctly, was tiny. Small, thin as a pencil, with long, silken blonde hair and a fringe hanging in front of her face. She was dressed in an odd outfit composed of a lace blue shirt and denim skirt, which looked bizarre compared to the other boy, Patrick-aka Pazuzu. He was taller than Korey and I, standing a little smaller than Rob, leaning against the table although he was standing; his hair, the colour of night sky-with a twinge of blue to it, was spiked on top of his head, in several strange points. A cuff was swinging off his right ear, and a bull ring style piercing hung from his nose-and I thought Jamie was gothic! Dressed from head to toe in black, with even a long black trench coat hanging down, it was his eyes which struck me; they were obsidian-a pure blackened colour, not deep brown or grey, a pure, shining black which shone out of his face. His nose was slightly hooked, like a raven's beak, but it didn't make him unattractive; in fact, you could legitimately argue it made him twice as noticeable. It was also a little crooked-but I figured that matched his crooked smile. Large patches of stubble had formed along his strong jawline, although his upper lip was smooth and chalky, unlike the scratchy patches of half-formed hair along his jaw. The very second his eyes glanced across to Korey, however, they shone with an undeniably potent emotion: love. He stood up by the time Korey had managed to drag me close enough to the table, about seven paces if I guessed, and strolled over to us; radiating confidence and an undeniable swagger to the way he seemed to glide forwards-all I could sense was complete and utter confidence leaking from his tall, slender form. \"Hi babe!\" I felt slightly uncomfortable at the mentioning of an endearment term like 'babe'-it reminded me of that film about the little pig who could talk or something. \"Hey!\" Korey's own eyes automatically shook up when he saw Pazuzu and he untangled himself from my rather firm grip, strolling towards Pazuzu, although he lacked all the swagger-seeming more shuffling, but he automatically got a confidence boost himself. Standing on his tiptoes, or it seemed that way to me; he threw his arms around Pazuzu and buried his face into Pazuzu's rather slender chest, pushing his face against the Metallica logo printed onto the taller boy's ebony shirt. When he pulled gently away, still smiling adoringly up at Pazuzu, he turned back to me and smiled gently, before casting his boyfriend another glance which clearly meant something because the black eyed, icy pale boy nodded politely at me. \"This is Noelle Manning,\" he grinned at me, his entire face blossoming into a beautiful smile. \"Pazuzu Alkins.\" He gestured to the boy and I managed to haul my hand upwards, gently waving. \"Hi…\" I managed to croak, allowing the sick feeling to swirl in my stomach some more. \"Korey's mentioned you most of the day.\" My eyelids felt a little heavy but I attempted to make them sparkle a little more-trying to take the advice my big sister had almost constantly showered me with. Annette was the practical empress of making her eyes shimmer whenever she needed them to and she'd attempted to teach me; I could make it happen sometimes, but often I fell flat on my ass regarding twinkling eyes. At that moment in time, not vomiting over the floor and everything else in sight was my main priority. I swallowed tightly and clasped my hands together, although I managed to maintain eye contact with Pazuzu despite the overpowering sick feeling pooling in my stomach. \"Has he now?\" Pazuzu had one dark eyebrow raised but he was still grinning; it was a grin which was somewhere between maniacal and beautiful, which suited his attire perfectly. \"Hope he's spared the gory details,\" he winked slightly at me and I smiled, despite the fact I was worried I was about to vomit all over the floor, completely disgracing myself in front of these new, impossibly kind people. I didn't understand how people who outwardly seemed so solitary, even a little awkward, were welcoming me so willingly into their tight-knit circle. Had Rob objected? I couldn't help but wonder. It sounded plausible based on his bizarre attitude towards me, but maybe Korey had persuaded Emily-Rose and Pazuzu to outvote him or something. I'd be grateful if he had. \"So!\" Pazuzu's voice bought me back to reality. \"Would you like to sit next to Em?\" I figured 'Em' was a shortened version of Emily, meaning it was the only other girl at the table he was referring to. \"You can sit next to her, with Korey on your other side.\" He added. \"Then I'll have Jamie opposite you and Rob next to him! That sound good?\" I nodded and smiled at him. It seemed like he was aware of my nervousness around Rob, so he was trying to keep us apart from each other. I partly wished the table arrangements at this school could be somewhat more like that of Oswell High School, with rounded tables, meaning you didn't have to sit directly opposite or next to someone. But it was just wishful thinking, and I couldn't ask the school to change dining room tables just because I was uncomfortable around a boy who hadn't technically done anything wrong. You couldn't get someone suspended for giving you a funny look, regardless of how frightened you were of them; but with Rob it was more his opinion of me that was frightening. \"Could you guys wait here?\" Pazuzu added. \"I just need to grab something.\" As if to enhance his swashbuckling glamour, he strolled away with a swagger to his walk and Korey grinned at me, the enamourment evident on his face for the punk rocker who'd deliberately placed me away from Rob on the table. \"Come on,\" he smiled kindly and linked my arm with his own, practically hauling me over to the table, due to the shaking in my legs. I still felt like I needed to be sick, urgently, but Pazuzu, Korey and Jamie's kindness had eased some of the tension, which I was incredibly grateful for. Emily was smiling when I sat down, and she was nibbling at her sandwich like a sparrow, picking it apart delicately with her slender, pale fingers, the tips being painted a light blue colour, matching the shade of her shirt. \"Hi!\" She grinned at me, her face looking even more pixyish when she smiled. She had a small, slim, button nose, with large doe eyes and slightly pointed ears peeking through strands of her sunkissed blonde hair. Her entire appearance seemed innocent, vulnerable and fragile, reminding me of a kitten; with a classical, yet unconventional beauty akin to that of a pixie or a faerie. Sitting next to her, I realised I was an entire foot taller than her, seeing that she only stood at 4'7\", with a diminutive, possibly even undeveloped physique. Her voice matched that appearance, being high pitched and melodic, reminding me of birdsong. \"I'm Emily-Rose, but just call me Emily, everyone does!\" She extended a hand which I graciously took and smiled at her, immediately at ease in her presence, with the sick feeling numbing slightly. \"You must be Noelle, I've heard so much about you-\" \"Emily.\" A voice spoke up, and I almost jumped out of my skin upon hearing it, feeling my blood chill into ice and the sick feeling shoot back throughout my system, causing me to desperately clamp my hand over my mouth in fear a fountain of vomit would spew out. The voice was deep, yet sharp and straight to the point, yet possessed the same melodic, hypnotizing undertone which I recalled both Emily and Pazuzu had. But it belonged to Rob, meaning there was something terrifying about it simultaneously. \"Don't even begin attempting your usual interrogation of her; she's probably been plagued with enough questions for one day, so save them.\" He sounded authorative, but underneath I picked out tones of jealousy. Why would he be jealous of Emily talking to me? Maybe it was because she could have a conversation with me, something he didn't think he could do. But why would he be so insistent to talk to me? He glared at me for looking at him! Why had his attitude towards me changed so suddenly? I didn't want to ask. \"Sorry about Emily,\" he apologized for her, but I was reluctant to even glance in his direction. \"She isn't in our year, and enjoys talking. A little too much for her own good.\" Emily stuck out her tongue playfully, looking even cuter than I imagined was possible, but I managed to compel myself to look at Robert Alkins. When I did I automatically regretted it. He was staring directly at me, his dark eyes shining with something that sat inbetween intrigue and annoyance, two emotions I'd never imagined would go together. I could uncomfortably feel everyone at the tables attention directed at me; Jamie was fixated on Rob, as if he was unsure of how to react to the amount of attention the beautiful-yet-dangerous baseball player was giving me, Korey's eyes flicked between the two of us, and he kept glancing towards Pazuzu, as if he wanted to run and get his assistance, whilst Emily was smiling at me, as if delighted I was here for some strange reason. \"Sorry I haven't spoken to you today,\" Rob began, ignoring the fact I opened my mouth to tell, no lie tohim it was fine, and continued speaking. \"I'm just not too good with new people, despite my status as baseball star. I guess I want to make a fresh start with you.\" He held out a hand. \"Rob Alkins.\" \"Noelle Manning,\" I took it gently and he shook it. His hand was freezing, colder than the snow which fell around my birthday. The muscles on his arm flexed as he shook it, but he kept his eyes firmly transfixed on my face, as if he was deciding whether or not I was attractive; and I felt myself being to pale at the thought of someone judging my looks so calmly. The sickness clenching my stomach was unbearable, and I had the horrible feeling I was genuinely going to vomit all over the table. Upon having my hand released from Rob's grip, I felt a hand on my shoulder and I jumped, but I realised it was Korey's and automatically relaxed. \"Are you okay?\" He asked me, staring at my probably ashen complexion, clearly worried. \"You look like you're going to be sick.\" He slid off the bench and helped me up, although by now I was amazed standing was possible at the amount of nausea which was overtaking my body, having to rest my hands on his shoulders, worrying I was going to drag the smaller boy down with me. \"I think you need to go home,\" he told me gently. \"You really look like you're not well, no offence. I'll be back in a bit guys,\" he faced the others who were all staring at us. \"Emily, could you tell Pazuzu I've taken Noelle home because she doesn't look too well-\" \"Don't.\" Rob's voice interrupted and he stood up now, walking around the table and gently pushing Korey back, taking hold of my non-casted forearm with his hand, putting the other on my shoulder. \"I'll take her. I have a free period next anyways, so it's not like I'm missing out on anything unlike you guys.\" He leaned close to me, so close our noses were almost touching and his dark brown eyes stared into my almost violet-blue ones, as if he was using my pupils to see how ill I was. \"Yeah, you really look like you're gonna be sick or possibly even faint.\" He sighed, although he sounded professional, like he was a doctor. \"Come on.\" He told me, in a gentle voice I didn't realise he possessed, gently turning me around towards the doors. I could see a look of both shock and jealousy pass over Jamie's face, but he didn't get up and object; knowing Rob might snap at him in a similar fashion to Emily if he claimed Rob couldn't take me back to Nan's house before I vomited over the table, the floor or whatever was unlucky enough to be close. \"I could help!\" Emily protested but Rob shook his head. \"You've missed enough school already,\" he told her, but he was smiling playfully at her, something which completely changed his entire demeanour and made him even more beautiful, something I'd assumed impossible, but there was something much more attractive about him having a positive facial expression than simply looking uninterested or scowling. Emily opened her mouth to protest but Rob just smirked at her and began walking back towards the dining room exit, ignoring the scowl which had graced Emily's own pixyish face. \"Tell Pazuzu I'm doing something good for once.\" He called, and I heard someone-probably Korey or Emily-laugh at that comment. I doubted Jamie would be laughing. How deep did his feelings for Rob go? Something told me it had extended beyond crush, but did it delve into 'love' yet or was it still around deep feelings and lust? I prayed he wasn't in love with Rob because I could feel a rift might be forming at the sudden amount of attention Rob was paying me. Love triangles weren't something I enjoyed being witness to. Kendell had been involved in one during her mad, party filled life, and it'd ended messily when the boy, Daryl something, in the middle had chosen cheerleader, Carolina Callahan over her. I couldn't blame him in the end. Carolina was an A grade, bubbly, driven young woman who had plans to become a ballet instructor or gymnastic teacher; Kendell's life was always very sporadic, and even dangerous, meaning it would've been awkward introducing her to his parents. Daryl was one of the richest boys in the school, and his parents had high standards which Carolina could meet, but Kendell couldn't. In Oswell, people had a habit of marrying their high school sweethearts, and something told me Carolina and Daryl were going to follow that path. Something told me Prescott County had similar values. But being stuck in my own love triangle wasn't something I would accept easily, and I'd try my best to keep away from it at all costs; I'd probably be the one to back down first, but it was all up to the centre triangle member in the end. It was their choice. And in the Jamie, Rob, Noelle situation, Rob was definitely the centre person; that was crystal clear to everyone. But was this even a situation? Maybe Rob was just being a nice person towards me and I was taking this the wrong way? I hoped that was the truth, not the horrible possibility of a love triangle forming. My feelings towards Rob were mixed. I didn't dislike him, but I was still fearful and distrusting of him, unsure of how to accept his sudden change of approach towards me. He seemed polite, even sweet, now, but was this the real Rob? WHO was the real Rob Alkins? There seemed to be a million different versions underneath that cool, uncaring façade, so which one was the right one to trust? For now, I couldn't be sure. But I was going to be stuck in a car with him for almost half an hour, so I needed to know the stance I was going to take. And I needed to know it now . Rob's car smelled strongly of disinfectant and cigarette smoke, an odd combination which made my nose sting slightly, but had a strange comforting feel at the same time. Luke's car always smelled distinctively of smoke, even after he quit when Alice became pregnant and he didn't want to potentially cause problems for the then-unborn Mollie. I had several pictures of my niece in my new bedroom, and several on my phone as well. Her cheerful, round face with her 'chipmunk cheeks', light pink flush and violet-blue eyes the same colour as Luke's; her face outlined with a series of tight, strawberry coloured curls, similar to her mom Alice's flaming hair which had always made her distinguishable in a crowd. I could always pick out my sister-in-law due to her striking hair. Two years old, turning three in November. Dad would allow me to leave my temporary 'punishment home' to visit the family down in Florida for Mollie's birthday. It'd probably be us, Alice's dad, stepmom and stepbrothers, and a couple of Mollie's little friends from kindergarten. Dad had promised I could invite a friend, but Kendell was off the limits, so it was probably going to be someone from here upon consideration. The car was filled with just the sound of the radio, a band called CKY who I vaguely remembered, blasting throughout the car; but every so often Rob would cast a glance in my direction, checking I was okay. The deep brown leather seats in Rob's car made slightly uncomfortable to lean back on, because I kept sliding downwards, but they were comfortable once I'd pulled my knees up to my chest and rested my head on top of my kneecaps, my eyes half-closed. I still felt incredibly sick, but Rob had promised to pull over if I thought it was going to vomit, so I was reassured I wouldn't ruin the fancy interior of his shining, expensive black Mercedes Benz B-Class 2005. I tried to keep my thoughts controlled and relatively normal to push back the sick feeling pooling in my stomach, and asked myself some relatively normal questions to keep my mind off the temptation of vomiting all over the place. What would Nan think of me being ill? Would she ring mom and dad back home? What was dad up to regarding the cannibal murder case? Was mom's teaching going okay? How was Annette doing at college? Were Luke and Alice coping okay with the ever energetic Mollie? How had Korey and Pazuzu met? Why had Nicole Alkins decided to adopt so many children? Who did Korey live with? Were any of the other Alkins' siblings related or were they all adoptive siblings? Was I genuinely ill or was this nervousness and anxiety completely overwhelmingly? Did Rob Alkins want to kill me, or did he secretly find me tolerable? How did I feel about Rob Alkins? \"Noelle?\" I almost screamed when Rob's freezing hand came down on my shoulder, the skin so cold it seeped through the material of my shirt and caused my skin to break out in a festering mass of goosebumps. \"Are you okay? You seemed to be zoning out then?\" It was strange to hear the concern in Rob's voice regarding my welfare. For a boy who'd so determinedly glowered and scowled at me a mere couple of hours earlier, his entire demeanour towards me had done a U-turn. I couldn't remember doing anything special or particularly endearing to make him suddenly like me; but I was relieved and pleased that he wasn't looking at me like he wanted to brutally murder me just because I existed. I rubbed my eyes slightly and looked towards him, feeling my vision become clearer and his perfect face came into clear focus now, making me smile slightly upon pure instinct. \"Sorry!\" I apologized to him, wishing I could wipe the stupid little smile off my face, but it was refusing to budge, causing me to probably look completely stupid to the star baseball player of Prescott County High. \"I just figured that by distracting myself with thoughts on other topics, I wouldn't profusely vomit all over the interior of your car or something.\" He laughed then, and it was a beautiful sound; rich, flowing, like music and my smile widened automatically, making my face look what other people had called beautiful. \"Ah. There's my sense of humour.\" I sighed somewhat. \"It has a tendency to leave whenever I need it most; good job that it's returned. I would've hated this car journey to simply be silence between us, accompanied by the occasional glance in each other's direction, and when you open your mouth to say something but then the conversation starter you intended on using suddenly vanishes from your head like a rabbit into a magician's hat or something!\" I was amazed at how perfectly sociable I was being, figuring I'd be awkward during the car journey, but since he'd laughed, everything seemed so much easier. \"Sounds like a usual conversation for me.\" Rob raised an eyebrow. \"I mean sure, I get along with my teammates, I go out with them sometimes and most of them bring along their girlfriends and whatnot, but they're aware I'm more into hanging out with my siblings and mom. Ever since my dad had to leave, things have been difficult for her. That's why she adopted Pazuzu, Emily, Alastor and Alkins when I was still a toddler; she needed the company to fill the hole dad had left. He promised he'd return someday, but so far we haven't seen hide nor hair of him. I can't really blame him to an extent. After my mom's cousin and her friends were brutally murdered, life was tough for her. My half-brother, the one who died, was born…Horribly disfigured.\" Rob swallowed somewhat but didn't drop his gaze from me. \"When I was born she was fearful I'd turn out the same. She believed she carried some rare fluke gene which made her children born that way, so she was delighted when I turned out half-normal.\" He laughed slightly and I smiled again, blushing somewhat, like a typical teenage girl, a feeling I'd missed until now. \"But my adoptive siblings have given her more conformation she's a good mother.\" He told me, and I was surprised he was admitting so much, seeing as previously he'd seemed to enjoy avoiding me. It was like he'd had a mini-epiphany of his own and had decided to become a kinder person towards not just me, but everyone. \"My dad mentioned your mom.\" I admitted to him, my head still rested on my kneecaps, making me look smaller than I usually did the way I'd curled myself into a ball. \"He said she owned a shop in the town centre, and told me she was a painter.\" Rob nodded, as if gesturing for me to continue. \"He also mentioned my Nan is a huge fan of your mom; treating her like a surrogate daughter of sorts.\" Rob laughed at that comment, smiling at me again, seeming to relax even more. \"Oh she is. Your grandma is always popping in, checking mom's okay, asking how me and the others are doing. She's close to another friend of my mom's; a woman called Jazelle who helped my mom after the brutal murders of her cousin, Bess, and her friends. Jazelle's sort of like my adoptive grandma. She has no children or grandchildren of her own, so she sort of took me and my siblings on as her own grandkids, with my mom being her surrogate daughter. Oddly enough there seems to be no uncles, granddads or fathers in our family unit.\" Rob sighed somewhat, and I figured he probably had some form of 'daddy issues', which could probably explain his difficult attitude in the first place. \"But we get along,\" he smiled, more to himself this time. \"And you're welcome at my family's shop anytime, Noelle. I'll inform mom so she doesn't worry you're just in the shop to take the piss of her belief's; besides, something tells me she'll like you.\" He winked, but as he did so, I felt my eyelids begin to close again and Rob gently shook my shoulder. \"You tired?\" He asked me, and I nodded. \"I'm just gonna…\" I yawned and stretched my arms upwards, feeling my eyes flutter shut again. \"I'm just going to rest my eyes…For a bit…\" I muttered, falling into the world of sleep. Something seemed so peaceful about the situation when I fell asleep; it was like I trusted Rob for a reason I couldn't explain externally, but internally, trusting him suddenly felt so right. When I awoke, I was back in my room, lying on top of my bed covers, my hair covering my face, jarring my view when my eyes first sleepily fluttered open and I hauled myself upwards. A sudden, horrible urgency to be sick shot throughout my entire body and I charged across the hallway, rushing into the bathroom and vomiting in the toilet. My throat burned as I vomited the few remains of my breakfast into the toilet bowel, but I felt a lot better upon leaning back and resting the back of my head on the tiles of the bathroom wall. I closed my eyes slightly, feeling tired again, and let my hands drape down by my side, putting my hands on my hips, and felt something in my pocket. A piece of paper. I pulled it out of my pocket and unwrapped the neatly folded piece of paper, recognizing it to be a handwritten note the second I began reading it. ' Dear Noelle, You fell asleep in my car whilst 'resting your eyes', so I carried you inside and explained the situation to your grandma. By the time you wake up, she'll have probably gone to visit my mom, so you'll be by yourself till about half nine when our store closes up. Like I told you in the car, you're welcome at our emporium anytime, and when you're better, I promise you can continue sitting with our little clique at lunch, nothing will have changed between any of us. The guys understand you're not well, and they all wish you to get well soon, especially Em and Korey. Sorry if I seemed rude at first, there just seems to be something a little different about you; maybe it's because you haven't lived here your entire life? I can't be certain, but there's something which makes me feel ashamed about acting so obnoxious, cold and bizarre around you at first; I hope that our chat in my car gave you a better picture of me and the type of guy I am. I have a baseball game in about three weeks, and you can come if you'd like. I've written down Pazuzu, Em, Korey, Jamie and I's phone numbers beneath this, so feel free to call or text us anytime you like. Hope you're feeling better soon, Robert Alkins.' I smiled slightly as I read the note and hauled myself to my feet, clutching to the sink as I pulled myself upwards and managed to drag myself out the bathroom, padding softly across the hall and shutting my bedroom door behind me when I got in. I gently transferred the numbers of my new friendship group into my purple address book, and then set about changing into some more comfortable clothing, feeling slightly grubby and unclean in the clothes I'd been wearing whilst profusely vomiting into the toilet. I had a feeling I was going to be sick again, but would rather have some rest before that came around, because I could feel the urgency to vomit had been quenched for now. Slipping off my clothes and placing them into my washing hamper, I searched through my draws, looking for the most comfortable, comforting clothing I owned. Eventually I picked out some of my common relaxation clothes which served as somewhat of a comfort for me. My grey tracksuit bottoms with a pattern of various cat breeds on it, a plain black tank top, and a pair of thick, pale and bright pink woollen socks Nan had knitted for me when I was just fifteen but still fit because my feet hadn't grown an inch. I pulled a white, knitwear cardigan and pulled it over my head in case it got colder when I awoke, and walked back towards the bathroom after getting changed, participating in a simple ritual I participated in every time I vomited. I washed my face, brushed my teeth, tied my hair into a messy bun on top of my head to ensure it didn't get vomit plastered in it, before turning back around and leaving the bathroom, turning off the bathroom light in the process. As I shut my bedroom door behind me and walked over to my bed, turning on the bedside lamp and slipping underneath the covers, cocooning myself within them like a bizarre caterpillar. Now the former issue with Rob Alkins having been thankfully solved, I felt a lot more relaxed about going to sleep, but I couldn't help but wonder about several details in the note Rob had wrote for me. He'd commented there was something 'different' about me, but I'd always somewhat prided myself on my boring, somewhat humble nature. I didn't understand how someone so attractive, so mysterious, so glamorous in his own right found me different. I didn't stand out with my looks, and although intelligent, I wasn't someone who got A+'s in every subject known to man, so there wasn't anything phenomenal about me. Closing my eyes and curling myself up into a tight ball within my duvet, I wondered what'd changed. I was thankful, but curious. Why had Rob Alkins' attitude towards me suddenly changed in such sporadic fashion?[Chapter 5] Disclaimer: I don't owner Jeepers Creepers, nor any of the original content which can be found within this fic, they all belong to Victor Salva.

For the rest of the week, my routine was mainly composed of leaning over the toilet, puking up my guts, alongside the very little amount of food I had left in my stomach. My daily routine was mainly composed of sleeping, vomiting, bathing, talking with my Nan, and occasionally texting one of my friends on the phone numbers Rob had so graciously provided me with. Jamie's replies were understandably awkward-showing he wasn't quite sure what his current opinion of me was; Emily's were positive, upbeat, radiating with sympathy and cheerfulness which no-one else I'd ever known seemed to possess; Korey seemed friendly and positive, which matched his in person personality, wishing me to get well soon; Pazuzu's humour was darker, with him making jokes about STI's and terminal illnesses, but I could tell it was nothing cruel or unkind; but Rob's were the most interesting to read. His responses to my texts were almost immediate; always full of concern, compassion and kindness, something which originally I'd figured he'd never show me. The idea of him brutally murdering me seemed more realistic they first time we'd met. But as I sat on my bed, gently tapping away on my phone as I stared intently at the screen, I couldn't help but smile at the screen of my phone, in that typical teenage fashion, whenever I received a text from any of them, but especially Rob. It was odd, how both of our opinions of each other had changed so drastically, but I couldn't quite grasp why my opinion, never mind Rob's, had become so positive towards someone who'd formally seemed to negative towards me; and to him, it was probably vice versa. Clutching the pink, purple and blue knitted armadillo Nan had knitted me when I was a little girl, I considered Rob's offer about visiting his families' store. Nan had gone to visit an ill friend of her's, Rose, leaving me alone for a couple of hours. Despite her age, Nan owned a car and could still competently drive, so I didn't need to drive her anywhere. I was feeling a lot better now, but Nan had insisted I had at least two weeks off school to make sure the virus had completely left my system. Originally she'd wanted it to be four weeks, but I'd managed to convince her I couldn't miss that much school, and she'd cut it back to two weeks. It was Tuesday of the second week, and I'd been spending most of my time since Friday-when I felt significantly better, and the profuse vomiting every couple of hours had ceased-baking pastries, cakes, pies and various other sweets my Nan specialized in. There was also her special chocolate and honey pie, a traditional family recipe she'd passed down to my mom, alongside her other daughter-in-laws and her own daughter. She hadn't taught me the recipe just yet, waiting till my eighteenth birthday, but I'd helped make the pastry regardless. Nan was a huge comfort to me, dutifully standing by me, and being a mini-doctor in her own right. It was hard to believe someone of her age could rush around; fetching me cups of water and aspirins to sooth the pounding headaches which constantly seemed to be forming post-vomiting. I had no idea how I'd suddenly become so ill with no warning signs prior apart from a bad night's sleep; but pregnancy was well out of the question, thank God. I'd never really dated anyone when I lived back in Oswell, meaning I'd never had sex-something which was much more embarrassing whenever I had to admit it out loud-so that was physically impossible. As a child, I'd gotten ill easier than most children, but my mom's constant cleanliness and borderline OCD cleaning routine had contributed towards that, so I couldn't be sure why I suddenly got so ill. Maybe I'd just picked up a bug before leaving Oswell which only kicked in a couple of days after contamination; or someone in the restaurant Jamie worked at could've made me ill. I wasn't sure, but getting better was my main concern. Visiting Rob was becoming more and more appealing, but I decided that visiting Korey first was a better idea. He'd texted me his address, 51 Parkmore Crescent, which was near the Earth Child Emporium, so I figured I'd pop into Korey's house, then visit Rob, and possibly Pazuzu and Emily ,at their store on the way home. White Street was apparently only about ten minutes' drive away from Parkmore Crescent and on the route back towards Nan's house anyway, so it seemed like common logic. Looking towards my clock it read 3:31 PM. It was hard to believe I'd been sleeping since 7 AM after a night of painful headaches, coupled with period cramps because it was 'that time of the month' for me, something which had only managed to increase the uncomfortableness I'd been put through during the late hours of Monday to the early hours of Tuesday morning. I'd managed to fall asleep at around four o'clock, only to be woken up at seven due to Nan doing her daily work at a charity shop in the town centre. Sometimes the amount of energy she possessed completely amazed me; she did more work than half of the teenagers I knew. The shop was open from 8 AM-6 PM and I was surprised when she told me she did all ten hours of work necessary. Nan said she enjoyed meeting new people in the shop, but the long, strenuous hours and the fact she was seventy-one still made the decision to work for ten hours slightly surprising. My Nan-always full of surprises. Parkmore Crescent was typically suburban, even for the standards of a small town like Prescott. The houses were all identical, with the only distinguishing features making them different being adjustments and customisations made by the residents themselves. Every house was covered in a smooth, white plaster which was chipping around the edges; being three stories high once you included the attic and fairly squarish in shape. They had an identical set of two, white paned windows on both the upper and lower stories on the front side of the house; with a small front garden, and white wooden gate leading through to what I assumed was the back garden. Each house had small porch, most of which had a couple of chairs and a table on, with several plants, and a grey slate roof. Overall they looked slightly odd-an amalgamation of modern housing and traditional Southern church style homes out on the bayou. It was like they weren't sure which look they liked more so they spliced two very different home styles together. But I had to agree they looked like good sized family homes. Korey had mentioned during the lessons we'd had together he lived with his dad, soon-to-be stepmother and he had a soon-to-be stepbrother who often hung around the house, despite having his own place back in Miami where Korey had moved from. Apparently things had become stressful there due to an incident with a mentally unstable priest claiming Korey, who attended a Catholic school, was possessed by a demon; and after the whole affair had died down, they'd moved here. Ironically, Pazuzu and Korey were already dating, and Korey had hinted Ms Alkins' had contributed to Korey's dad agreeing to move out here to Prescott County. Apparently she could be very charming and persuasive whenever she wanted and/or needed to be. My car had slowed to a practical crawl by the time I saw No. 51 come into view from my position in the driver's seat; the sign at the end of the street informed me I could only travel fifteen mph because there were constantly children playing in the street. That was true. As I drove I saw gaggles of children aging from as young as six to as old as thirteen standing on the sidewalk or sitting on lawns or lounging on porches; the entire atmosphere was that of a homely, suburban dream which felt slightly odd. It gave the small town a somewhat cityish vibe to it, reminding me of the neighbourhood I'd grown up in in some aspects. The peach coloured ribbon I'd threaded at the bottom of the small section of my hair I'd platted flitted into my view as the light wind breezing in through the open window pushed it into my vision. I'd straightened my hair after brushing it, despite it being naturally straight; to make sure I didn't look as awful as my sickroom pallor had made my skin look. I had deep lavender circles under my eyes and a sickly complexion; the circles had been hidden with a layer of foundation and I'd used some blusher to return the colour to my cheeks. Hopefully the expert application of my eye liner and mascara would drive people away from the chapped, cracked texture of my lips; and I made a mental not to by a chap stick the second I found a shop with them in-stock. And I hoped my outfit would contribute to ignorance in favour of ignoring my ill appearance. I'd picked out a simple, yet pastel coloured outfit to try and bring some colour to my complexion, making myself look less well…fittingly unwell in a physical sense. My orange, a sort of blend between peach and tangerine, t-shirt was tied off in a small knot at the side, exposing some of my pale skin; it had the word 'Free' printed on it in a navy so deep it looked black and the writing was swirling and extravagant with three small birds-one above the word, one below, and one flicking off the last 'e'-for decoration. My skirt was pale blue, denim and buttoned up the front, reaching above the knee but covering my thighs, with a brown belt threaded through the waistband to keep it closer to my skin because it was slightly too big for me. I'd finished the outfit with tan wedge lace-up shoes and I'd brought along a wide, loose fitting cardigan just in case the weather took a change for the worst. Overall, I was very coordinated, right down to the peach colour of my finishing ribbon. There was a small gap on the pavement outside Korey's house, just short of the drive where a maroon coloured Nissan Altima sat. Gently parking, I got out of my car, locking the door behind me and slipping the keys into the small, over the shoulder tan purse I'd brought with me, and walked towards the front door. There was a 66 Harley Davidson parked nearer the house, but it was pitch black, and I took an educated guess that it belonged to Pazuzu. Waltzing into the house was out of the question, probably because Korey's family would be home, and I wanted to make a good impression on them by not just storming into their home, unannounced, with only a text from Korey confirming I could come over just over half an hour previously. He'd seemed pleased I was well enough to get out the house, but understood school was out of the question in case I infected everyone I came in contact with. As I contemplated this, I gently padded up the front porch steps which the pathway led up to, curling my hand into a fist and gently rapping on the door. After standing on the porch for just under two minutes, I heard a latch click from the other side of the doorway and the door was gently pulled open. It wasn't Korey. It was a woman, who I assumed was his future stepmother, but I couldn't put a name to the face. The woman had a dark tan, the sort you get from a sunbed, and her skin looked slightly wrinkled where her laughter lines were, probably due to the heat from the tanning bed. She could've just lain outside in the sun, but the deep, rich, almost overpowering tan indicated it'd been done mainly through salons and not sunbathing. She was shorter than me, about 5'3\", despite being in her mid-forties; her weight was healthy and she had circumstantial bosom, so she wasn't the stereotype of most women in their mid-forties with a child or children. Her hair was black, but I figured it was dye because of the limp, somewhat straw-like texture of her hair-excess dying I assumed. She was wearing a pair of lemon yellow jeans, a black-and-white striped t-shirt and had a black waistcoat over the top. Overall she looked fairly stylish and young, despite her overly-dyed hair and tan wrinkles. \"Can I help you?\" She asked politely, although she sounded tired, and from inside, I could hear a baby gurgling. Did Korey have a younger half-brother or half-sister? \"I'm sorry,\" I smiled at her. \"I'm Korey's friend, Noelle, from school. We arranged that I could come over a while ago.\" \"Oh yes!\" She smiled at me and stepped aside, allowing me to walk into the hallway, looking instantly prettier now that she didn't look as confused and tired. \"I'm Vickie,\" she introduced herself politely, holding out her hand which I shook, although I could tell she thought me slightly odd for being friends with Korey. They didn't seem to be on bad terms, but I had a feeling she probably didn't approve of Pazuzu and Korey's relationship; not in the homophobic sense, but I could imagine Pazuzu wasn't the most responsible of boyfriends at times. \"They're in the living room, with Dante,\" she added the last part apprehensively but didn't elaborate. \"Go right through, Korey's waiting.\" \"Thank you,\" I nodded politely at her before heading through to the front room, which I picked out because it was the only room with the door ajar. The living room was made up of warm, autumnal colours, with two red, comfy looking sofas, and a matching red chair; a white carpet with a beige rug with tan leaf patterning on it; the wallpaper was green, contrasting well with the peach and red coloured curtains. There was a white fireplace opposite the doorway with a crackling fire, and there were several photos on the wall behind it of floral plants, with a white vase of snowdrops, a clock and two candlesticks either side of it for decoration. There was an oak coffee table in between the two sofas, and it had two cups and a bowl resting on it, with an afghan throw partially hanging on the side pointing towards me. \"Well, well, well!\" A familiar, somewhat scratchy voice called from the left hand side of the room, where there was a large, white cabinet with dishes, glasses and other bowls stacked in it pressed up against the wall. \"Look who showed up in this one horse town!\" When I turned to face Pazuzu Alkins, I was not expecting him to literally be wearing a cowboy had to match the Wild West style dialogue that had preceded me turning towards him. There was something incredibly surreal about seeing him with a black cowboy hat perched on his head, his black hair sticking out from under it-jell not sticking it upwards in a series of crude spikes, and he was dressed like a cowboy too. Heavy black jacket, that for once wasn't leather, but his black leather pants made up for that, and he had a white dress shirt underneath. His lacking of shoes or socks revealed his bare feet, and his toenails were alarmingly long. He had a small, child's plastic gun in his hand and was pointing it at me. \"You haven't got your gun, Ms O'Hara?\" He asked me, raising an eyebrow. I shook my head. \"No, sir.\" He stuck out his foot and kicked another plastic gun towards me, allowing me to bend over and pick it up before standing. \"Now we're equal!\" He grinned at me and raised an eyebrow, stepping up onto the back of one of the red sofas, looking twice as tall as usual and aiming his toy gun at me. This Wild West re-enactment was interrupted when a tiny, two year old boy toddled into the room from the archway which lead to the kitchen on the right hand side of the room. He was miniature, even for a two year old, and had skin even paler than the likes of Jamie and Pazuzu. His skin was so pale it was tinged blue around the edges, he had straight black hair similar to Pazuzu's now it was flattened, with a red cowboy hat placed upon his head which was kept secure by a piece of string tied underneath his chin, securing it on his head. His eyes were deep grey, almost purely black like Pazuzu's, but distinctively grey. He had long fingernails like Pazuzu's toenails, and was gently clasping a toy gun in his own small, fleshy hand. He was dressed in a miniature cowboy outfit: white shirt, black waist coat, black pants, and he was grinning in that traditional cutesy way little boys could pull off. \"Look Dante!\" Pazuzu addressed the little boy, who I assumed was Korey's little half-brother. He looked up and winked at me before continuing to address the adorable child. \"O'Hara's shown up to grab our loot!\" Dante gasped at the mentioning of me, and began giggling, clapping his hands together in delight. \"We've just gotta wait for Korey Kilpatrick to show up, and then we're good to fire!\" He announced, causing Dante to giggle even more. As if it was a stage cue, Korey walked into the room then, and he was similarly dressed for the occasion. He was wearing a long, deep brown coloured overcoat which swept the floor, and had a similar white dress shirt underneath, which was partially covered by a tan leather waistcoat. He had brown jeans on, and he too was barefoot. \"Whoa whoa whoa!\" He raised his hands in the air, signalling a cease of possible fire, and showing he too had a toy gun. How many did these guys own? \"This isn't fair, Pazuzu.\" He scolded his boyfriend. \"She needs to be dressed up too, or it isn't authentic, and Dante won't have learned anything!\" Pazuzu rolled his eyes but lowered his gun and looked at Dante. \"Lower the gun, Sundance Kid,\" he told the little boy. \"We gotta wait for her to deal with her 'girl stuff'.\" Dante pouted, looking incredibly adorable, but lowered his fake gun and looked at me, grinning in a cheeky, yet charming fashion. \"We've got a spare costume for you,\" Pazuzu told me, jumping off the sofa and walking over to me. \"Did you take my measurements somehow?\" I asked him, raising an eyebrow, although I was slightly worried he had. \"'Course not!\" Pazuzu rolled his eyes. \"We just guessed!\" He told me, slapping me on the shoulder gently with his gun. \"Em's Calamity Jane, Rob's Rob Butler, Korey's Kilpatrick and I'm Pazuzu the Kid!\" He grinned at me again. \"And I figured you'd make a brilliant Noelle O'Hara.\" This time he followed it with a wink and took his phone out of his pocket, beginning to text. \"I'll invite Rob over now and we can have a proper cowboy shoot out!\" He announced, making Dante begin to clap his hands enthusiastically again, although this time he bounced on the balls of his feet, clearly delighted at the idea of a full cowboy game. \"Korey got you it at the weekend whilst you were ill, hope you don't mind.\" He told me and I smiled at him. \"I'd love to play!\" I told them both. \"And I'd never let your little brother down.\" I looked at Korey who was standing next to me. \"He's adopted,\" Korey said quickly, although he was still smiling. \"His parents just left him on our doorstep one night when we were living in Miami, and we decided to adopt him. Vickie can't have any more kids, so she and dad decided he'd be the perfect addition to our little family; but, truth be told, Pazuzu and I act more like his parents half the time because dad and Vickie have to work. Tuesday's Vickie's only day off, so most of the time, Pazuzu's mom has to come over and take him back to the shop with her. He's great with the customer's though-takes after Rob in the charm offensive.\" Korey laughed slightly, sounding like a proud father. \"Doesn't Jamie join in with you guy's cowboy games?\" I asked, but Pazuzu answered just as Korey opened his mouth. \"To be honest, I don't really know if I like the guy.\" He admitted and Korey shook his head, as if he was displeased at Pazuzu's brutal honesty. \"He only really hangs around with us because he's a huge Rob groupie; I often get a sense he has to put up with me and Em, but genuinely likes Korey and Rob underneath the surface-\" \"Actually,\" Korey butt in. \"For a while he showed a bit of interest in Jamie, Rob I mean.\" I nodded, but felt an odd sense of intense, uncontrollable jealousy begin building in my chest, making me feel like I wanted to shout about how unfair it all felt; but Jamie had met Rob first, so I was considered the one the jealousy should be directed at. \"In fact, he showed a lot of interest…\" Korey mused, leaning down and picking up Dante before continuing explaining. As Dante was now nearer to me, he began gently tugging on the small plat of hair I'd got, but it wasn't harsh, and he was grinning at me merrily. \"Then you showed up,\" Korey met my eyes then. \"And Rob just seemed to lose any interest he'd ever shown in Jamie…\" He shrugged slightly, gently squeezing Dante's cheek, making the little boy giggle. \"It was like he'd never even been interest in Jamie.\" Pazuzu resumed speaking now, folding his arms across his chest and walking back over to the sofa, pulling a white bag from behind it and walking back over to us. \"The second he met you, he just seemed to put all of his previous interest in Jamie onto you. You just seemed to spellbind him, it was like you had some power to manipulate his emotions, but in a good way.\" He smiled slightly. \"He cheered up the day he met you, like he was certain he'd met someone he knew he'd be attracted to or something…\" I tried not to let pride overwhelm me, but it washed over me like a tidal wave before I could stop it. \"And he just showed no interest in Jamie since. I swear he's actually avoiding the guy now or something; he seems to make him really uncomfortable now. Seriously, ever since you got that bug, Rob's been spending all of his free time at practice or working in the store; always making sure he's preoccupied so he doesn't have to see Jamie. It's weird…\" Pazuzu sighed. \"Ignore me!\" He grinned again. \"Go get changed, I'll text Rob and Em, we can have a blast!\" He winked and I nodded. \"Where do I get changed?\" I asked him. \"There's a bathroom opposite this room.\" Pazuzu answered, and I figured he knew Korey's house plan as well as he knew his own. \"If you need anything, just give me or Korey a shout,\" he told me, grinning. \"I mean, neither of us are into women, so we're not gonna get turned on by walking in on you getting changed though.\" He winked and I shook my head, although I was smiling. I crossed the hallway, as instructed, and opened the bathroom door, stepping inside and locking it behind me. I stared at the cast on my arm; I had a doctor's appointment in two weeks' time, to get the cast taken off my arm, and I couldn't wait. Finally I wouldn't have to retell the same story, and my forearm would cease getting uncomfortably hot, irritated and sweaty underneath he cast. Korey's downstairs bathroom was fairly simple; white tile walls, white and navy tiled floor, a rigged glass shower, toilet, sink, mirror and a silver towel rack with a navy bathmat. Overall, fairly simple and impersonal. Gently and carefully, I slipped off my clothes, placing them into the white bag the clothes had come in, having already taken them out and placing them on the towel rack so they didn't get stained or wet on the floor in case it was somewhat damp. The outfit wasn't a typical red number, and thank God it wasn't a traditional, long Wild West dress which would've probably ended up with me falling over. The top of the dress was a black and yellow gingham check with a v-neckline and the lower part of the dress was a creamy yellow satin pencil-skirt shape, matching the creamy yellow involved in the gingham pattern. I pulled the peach ribbon out of my small plat, placing it in the bag, and tied my hair back behind my head in a high ponytail. The outfit came complete with my own black cowgirl hat and creamy yellow boots. Wow. I really owed either Pazuzu or Korey some money. After getting changed, I crossed the landing back into the front room, and found Korey, Pazuzu and Dante waiting for me. \"I seriously owe one of you guys some money,\" I told them, gently placing the white bag down next to the sofa on the right hand side of the room. \"No you don't!\" Pazuzu slapped me on the shoulder again and grinned. \"My mom's loaded, Noe,\" it felt slightly odd to be called 'Noe' again, but comforting at the same time. \"This didn't put the tiniest, meekest of scratches on her bank account, don't you worry. Besides! Em was the one who picked out the costume for you, so if you owed anyone money, it'd be her. But you don't, so don't even mention it!\" He winked and slapped me on the shoulder again. \"By the way, we were thinking of having our duel out in the field's behind my house, that okay with you?\" \"Sure,\" I smiled at him and nodded. \"But seriously, I'm driving.\" I told him. \"No you're not!\" Pazuzu raised an eyebrow and grinned at me. \"Rob's totally want to let you ride with him on that glamorous bike of his,\" he winked at me again. \"If it's alright with you, Korey can take Dante, himself, Em and I in your car and you can travel with Rob. You two really can be a modern day Rhett Baker and Scarlett O'Hara!\" He laughed, but as he opened his mouth, the sound of a bike cut him off and he raised his eyebrows at me. \"I think they're here.\" As if Pazuzu was a director of some film, Emily ran into the room, like some pink, silken whirlwind of cuteness. Her blonde hair had been tied into two bunches either side of her head, finished with pale pink bows, and matching the entire pink theme of her outfit. She wore a pink and violet checkered shirt, white short-shorts, pink, authentic cowgirl boots and a white cowgirl hat. She had a plastic gun with her, hanging off a pink holster threaded through her pocket and she was grinning at us all, her eyes shining. \"Noelle!\" She launched into a hug based attack upon seeing me, throwing her arms around my neck and pulling me downwards into a bone crushingly tight hug. Note to self: Emily-Rose Alkins is a lot stronger than she looks. \"Omigod!\" The entire sentence came out smushed together. \"It is so amazing to see you!\" She grinned, pulling away from me and jumping up and down excitedly. \"We really need to go shopping and have our hair done and-\" \"Stop acting like you're on Class A drugs.\" An irritated, yet beautiful voice cut through Emily's speech, and Rob Alkins stepped into the room. \"Seriously, are you on M-CAT?\" He asked her, raising his eyebrows as he stepped into the room. His own outfit was similarly cowboy based; his cowboy hat placed on top of his dark hair was pitch black, making his skin look ethereally pale. He had a normal, black t-shirt on, with a white waistcoat on top, but no jacket on top. He had black jeans and white converses on his feet-and he two had a toy gun. \"Hey Noelle,\" he looked instantly breath taking the second he smiled at me, walking over gracefully, in a relaxed fashion and hugged me, wrapping his arms around me and pulling me close. He smelled strongly of cigarettes and honey, two smells I'd never associated with each other before. \"Hey Rob!\" I was aware how obviously infatuated and somewhat immature I sounded in the high-pitched, over excited tone of my voice, but Rob brushed it off and gently pulled back, although he still had his hand on my shoulder. \"Pazuzu said you've been doing baseball practice, how's it been going?\" I asked him, undoubtedly grinning like an idiot. \"They've been going wonderful,\" he grinned back at me, his eyes glowing somewhat with an emotion I couldn't automatically place. \"I have my game in two weeks' time and I insist you're attending. My special guest or whatever.\" He laughed somewhat, and it was incredible, making me smile even more goofily at him. \"Can you come? It's on a Friday.\" \"Yes!\" I nodded at him, feeling myself smiling at the premise of being invited to a game by the school baseball star, Rob Alkins. \"I have my cast taken off on the Thursday night before anyways, so I'm not going to be as awkward in my movements when I attend.\" I told him, still smiling, although I could feel my face begin to flush slightly. There was something seductive about his unnaturally godlike beauty, but I wasn't complaining about how outwardly beautiful he was, and now I was beginning to see he was internally beautiful as well. Even though he had flaws like the rest of us. \"Um…\" I paused slightly, remembering something which had happened in Art the only day I'd been at school. \"I think I've been invited out by someone in cahoots with your baseball team.\" I told him, and saw a flash of jealousy shoot up in those hypnotizing eyes. \"Consolacion De La Cruz,\" I told him, remembering the Latino young woman who'd spoke to me in Art, being automatically friendly. The jealousy vanished the second he realised this person had been female and he smiled at me. \"Ah yes! I know who you're talking about. She's the girlfriend of Isaac Flynn, our bowler. Now I understanding why she was asking about me.\" He chuckled to himself and looked at me. \"You want to go out with her?\" \"Sure,\" I nodded, wanting to make some friends' outside the small group who'd accepted me. I was grateful and cared about these people to the extreme, but I knew making other friends was the healthy option, so if it came to issues between me and Jamie, he could stay with the gang and I'd spend time with other friends. Although I could imagine Pazuzu or even Rob telling me to not allow myself to be pushed aside, I owed Jamie; he was the first friend I'd made, and I couldn't betray him by forcing him out of the group he'd been in first. \"She was mentioning something about me, her and a girl called Tessa Parrish going out for coffee or something back in Oswell.\" \"I'd recommend you go,\" he told me. \"Consolacion's great, she's Cristian De La Cruz's twin sister, and Cristian's probably my best friend. As for Tessa? I haven't interacted with her as much, but from what I've heard and seen, she seems great.\" He smiled at me again, tugging my ponytail gently. \"You have a best friend?\" I asked him, slightly surprised someone as seemingly isolationist and standoffish as Rob had chosen a boy to be his best friend. He laughed and nodded at me, raising an eyebrow. \"It sounds insane, but I do have friends outside the group; sure, I always eat lunch with my family and closest friends, but I can't be completely trapped with my family. All of us have friends outside the group who we hang out with after school and go into Oswell with.\" He informed me. \"Cristian isn't into baseball, he's more based around stuff like self-defence and weight lifting, but he's one of my oldest, most trusted friends.\" \"Allies!\" Called Pazuzu, who was busy buttoning up Dante's black coat, threading golden buttons to keep him wrapped up warm. Rob rolled his eyes but smiled still. \"Allies, okay,\" he gestured towards the door. \"Want to travel with me?\" He offered and I nodded, chucking my car keys at Korey who caught them and nodded. \"See you guys at the field,\" Rob called as we walked out the house and over to his bike. \"As I was saying, I do have a small collection of people I hold near and dear to me. Our little gang consists of Cristian, Jesse Moore-he's also on the baseball team, we joined around the same time, and Elijah McGowan, the son of one of my mom's friends.\" He told me as he climbed onto his bike and gestured for me to get on the back. \"Don't I need a helmet?\" I asked him and he chuckled again, shaking his head. \"I trust you're sensible enough to hold on tight.\" \"Okay…\" I felt somewhat nervous, but managed to push my fears aside and climbed onto the back of the bike, my skirt riding upwards somewhat as I did so. \"I'll continue explaining when we get to the field,\" Rob told me, slamming his foot down on the pedal and off the bike rocketed. The field behind the Alkins' family home was huge. It was full of rich, golden wheat which had been hacked short in the past couple of weeks for harvest. It had become so short even Dante could be seen coherently in the field at his tiny height, making me feel instantly at ease. I would've constantly been worrying if there was a possibility of Korey's little brother going missing. \"Alright!\" Pazuzu announced, spreading out his arms like he was about to burst into song. \"We're gonna pick teams, and Dante, seeing as you're the most dangerous of us all, you get to pick your team first!\" Dante giggled slightly again and immediately pointed at Korey, who smiled gently at him. \"Who else?\" He asked. Upon being asked that, Dante did something which not only seemed to surprise Pazuzu, but also surprised me. He pointed on pale, chubby finger at me. \"You want O'Hara?\" Pazuzu raised an eyebrow, before faking a theatrical gasp. \"Dante, you have broken my heart,\" he bawled, raising his hand to his forehead in mock faint. \"You have chosen the sheriff's daughter over your long standing ally; you are a cruel posse leader!\" Dante shook his head, but he was laughing at Pazuzu's overdramatic response, and clapping his hands together as if he was exited. \"You want to begin?\" Korey asked him gently, but he shook his head and Korey cocked his head to the side. \"What do you want to do?\" \"Walk!\" Dante's voice was quiet and humble, unlike the brash and loud tone most toddlers commonly spoke in when they were at the first stages of speech. Korey grinned at his little brother and turned around, facing the field. \"Alright people, you heard the boss! He wants to go for a walk before we wage in our war-needs to survey his territory. Let's go.\" With that, Korey began walking through the short wheat crop, hand tightly clutching Dante's, who had his lower half hidden by the corn, but his black hair was visibly striking. Pazuzu snickered slightly and turned on his heels, bounding after Korey and leaving Em, Rob and I to stand there. \"Let's go then,\" Rob grinned and began walking through the corn, the short height of it making him look abnormally tall, but it didn't even cover my knees, so I was no different. Emily and I set off behind him, with Rob walking a couple of paces before stopping and holding out his hand towards me. \"Want to hold my hand?\" He asked politely, and I was surprised he hadn't just taken mine in his own like most boys would. It was a slightly old-fashioned gesture, but I found it romantic and graciously took his hand, smiling like an idiot the entire time. \" Woohoo!\" Emily sung prettily, her voice high-pitched and melodious, like a tiny, blonde and pink bird chirping beautifully from a tree. \"Nobody knows it! When I was down-I was your clown. Woohoo!\" She was singing Elton John and Kiki Dee's iconic song 'Don't Go Breaking My Heart', and it was evident by the way her pitch changed whenever she was signing either part. Part of me though Rob would tell her to stop singing but he just smiled and shook his head, grinning down at me. \"You enjoying this?\" He asked me. \"Yeah,\" I nodded, biting my lip slightly, but I felt more at home with these people than my original friends had ever made me feel. \"I'm having a great time. You guys have been so kind to me and I've done nothing in return to thank you for your kindness.\" I sighed, gently resting my head on his arm, looking up at him. \"I really have to thank all of you for being so accepting of me, even though there's two members of your family I haven't formally met.\" \"You can come over once the shoot-outs done!\" Emily called, pausing her singing for a second. \"Meet mom, Alastor and Alkins!\" She grinned at me. \"You can even stay for dinner with us if you want, that is…\" She paused, blushing slightly. \"If you can eat food again without being sick.\" \"Emily!\" Rob hissed but I smiled at her. \"No! It's fine!\" I told them both. \"The vomiting part of the bug has ceased, now all I get is these really pounding headaches; so I'd love to come for dinner with you. I'll need to text my Nan beforehand though, would it be okay if I invited her over to your place for dinner too? She's been so wonderful whilst I've been ill and I'd hate to leave her alone.\" \"'Course you can.\" Rob assured me. \"Your gran practically became our second adoptive grandmother to be honest, the amount of time she put into visiting our crazy, dysfunctional family.\" He laughed and shook his head, still grinning at me. \"But I definitely don't see you as my adoptive cousin or something. You're definitely someone I'd call my friend,\" he told me, but he sounded strained, as if he wished we could be something more. To be honest, I wished that too. \"You're someone I think we need,\" he told me, running a hand across his jaw, where slight patches of stubble were forming. \"You aren't like Jamie.\" He told me. \"He seemed lovely but…Something about you is just so much more appealing to be around.\" He admitted. \"That's probably the nicest thing someone's ever told me.\" I gushed, blushing madly. \"Thank you, thanks to all of you, you've been so wonderful, not getting pissed at me for getting ill a matter of minutes after meeting some of you; and accepting me into your family. Emily, you picked me out a wonderful dress. Pazuzus' cheered me up throughout being ill with his sarcastic and dark sense of humour. Korey for just being so wonderfully kind and compassionate towards me. Even Dante for not being terrified of me!\" I laughed slightly. \"Jamie for befriending me and letting me meet you. But of course, you too Rob.\" I told him, squeezing his hand. \"You didn't need to apologize for acting a little odd towards me…I was off with you. But I'm so glad we've started over and everything's so wonderful now. I feel like I'm in some crazy fairytale.\" I laughed and looked at them. \"Thanks.\" They grinned back, Emily looking the picture of everything adorable and cuddly; Rob looking insanely handsome, and for once in my life I felt accepted. ","Summary":" Disclaimer: I don't own Jeepers Creepers, The Creeper, or any canon based ideas, characters, sets a"},{"Movie":"Remember the Titans","Title":"A love story from 1971","Author":"pinkfanatic454","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6090659","Passage":"[Chapter 1] I have been reading every single Gerry and whoever, fanfic for this entire week. Ive read pretty much all of them, and they are all great! I got so inspired by the writers I had to start my own. So here it is let me know what you guys think, please feel free to give all of your ideas. I don't own anything except my own character Stephanie. Ohh and check out my other fic, cause no one has read it and reviewed it and that makes me sad lol Also this is just a starter off chapter just to get the basics put in Enjoy! …... I, Stephanie Marie Yoast, was lying down in the bleacher soaking up the hot summer sun. I could hear her sister, Cheryl, and dad yelling at the boys on the field. The guys were grunting, and huffing. Cheryl started blabbering something about Kurt being twice the size of Ray. Blah blah blah, summer was the best time for me. I could just let my mind roll and wander. I looked up for a second and saw Gerry, my best friend, and my boyfriend, talking to my dad, Coach Yoast. It looked kind of serious so I just laid back down. I'm not like my sister really. She's obsessive about football, or any sports really. While I do enjoy all sports, I'm just a little bit more of a lady then she wants to be. I also don't have the urge to yell my head off everyday cause the boys aren't do something right or aren't working hard enough. Suddenly Alan was running down towards the field yelling about how there's a fight at the store cause the color kid got shot. As soon as he told the guys they took off running up the street towards town. \"Stephanie, take Cheryl and go to the school. I'll meet you girls there. Hesitantly I replied\" Uhhh alright Coach. Come on Cheryl get to the car\" Cheryl hoped into the front seat and started whining about how she never gets to see anything exciting. \"Trust me sis you don't wanna be there to witness this, lets just hope Coach gets to the boys before all hell breaks lose.\" I pulled out of the parking lot and drove to T.C. William high school. We pulled into the parking lot just as my dad's truck drove in and in it where Gerry, Ray, and Alan. I put the car in park, and let Cheryl hope out before I let Gerry have a new one. \"What were you thinking you big lug!\" I looked at him and just so he could understand how scared I was I gave him a quick shove. \"Stephanie not now.\" I knew he hated getting yelled at in front of his friends but right now his wants weren't so important to me. \"Oh yeah lets just see how long you would've have lasted in that fight! Geez Gerry why don't you ever think about someone beside yourself.\" I knew I was kinda being over the top but who knows what would've happened if Gerry and the guys got involved. Gerry knew I was just scared and pulled me into his arms and softly whispered into my ear \"I'm sorry baby I just…\" \"Yeah I know\" We stood there for a few more seconds till my dad cleared his throat really loudly \"Enough you two\" Gerry and I pulled apart quickly and glanced around trying to look innocent. \"I want you all to come to my office and cool down. Help me pack the rest of my stuff up.\" Cheryl walked up in the front with Coach while I was walking besides Gerry. My dad's assistant Coach was there lecturing Gerry about his actions. \" Now son I know you heart was in the right place but don't embarrass the Coach like that\" \"Hell, kick' em all off the team I don't wanna play with those black animals\" right as Gerry said that we all walked into my dads office to find a black man standing by the desk holding a football. \"Gerry!\" I scolded him. \"What Stephanie, I see him and I don't care.\" I was ashamed of him for being so rude. I could feel the awkward tension and decided it was time to go.\" Dad, Cheryl and I are gunna go home alright?\" \"Ok sweetie I'll see you girls soon.\" I didn't even look at Gerry as I brushed past him. I did however feel his hand brush slightly against my waist almost ads if he was trying to hold me back. Cheryl was mad at me for once again taking her away from where all the big news seemed to be. \"Why, Steph, why can't I just for once be where everybody else is!\" \"Everybody was not there I'm not there missy smarty pants and because you just aren't old enough.\" \"yeah, yeah you always use that excuse and one day its gunna stop working.\" \"But not today Cheryl and that's all that matters\" Cheryl looked over at me and stuck her tongue out at me and ran outside into the backyard. I sighed and leaned against the kitchen counter, now I just had to decide what's for dinner.[Chapter 2] Here's chapter 2! Once again I don't own anything except Stephanie. Also just so you guys know Gerry wont die or probably even be injured badly and that's because I love Gerry Bertier soo much (not the actual person cause u kno I didnt kno him but Disney's version and the guy the cast ohh boy im week at the knees for that man haha. …... \"hmm listen baby..\" I was humming along to the radio in the kitchen as I was clean the dishes from dinner. I could see out the window, whatever the official hall of fame man was talking about, Cheryl didn't like it to much. Hell I could hear her screaming from in here. I knew that if Cheryl was upset then Coach defiantly wasn't pleased. Coach bent down to sooth Cheryl and patted her on her back, she walked towards my dad's office then suddenly spun a round and kicked Mr. Official in the back of his leg. Even though I know they couldn't hear me I tried to cover up my laughter. I poked my head out the backdoor \"Cheryl! Why don't you come in here ill give you some cake?' This seemed to satisfy her cause she huffed and puffed her way back to the main house. \"Sis what's wrong?\" I had no idea what news could make her so mad so quickly. \"They gave away daddy's job! To that black man today!\" I almost dropped the dish that was in my hand \"Wh...what? Bu…but what about the hall of fame and his team! What about the guys?' Cheryl gave me one of her most famous looks of all. The gee sis I never thought about that till now oh wait your just being stupid look. I was shell shock I knew later I'd have to talk to Coach. \"So uhh how bout that cake Steph?\" I shook my head laughing \"Alright, alright\" Later in the evening after I tucked Cheryl into bed and made sure she was asleep. Several times she would just pretend to be asleep and then get up and follow me. I crept out of the house to go to my dad's office. The night summer air captured me and I stood simply enjoying the feel and smell. I could dimly hear voices coming from the office; as soon as I got there I peeked inside and saw the black man from earlier today. Daddy and him were arguing about something. I slowly crept away, and back into the house. I slid into my bed and was finally able to relax. I had feeling that things in Alexandria were about to change in a big way, I just couldn't figure out if it's for better or worse. IT was mid afternoon now and pretty much the entre football team and their families had gathered to Hal's to hear my daddy's announcement. I tried distracting myself from the nerves by playing with the ends of my hair or smoothing out my dress from invisible wrinkles. I was sitting next to Gerry; he lightly had one of his hands on my thigh under the table. We were sitting near the front, where my daddy was now standing and explaining to everybody what was going to happen. \"It's been a rare privilege to lived here, as long as I have coaching your boys. I'll be taking the year off, after which I'll be moving to Lowden, taking the head coaching job at Lowden high.\" I heard Alan's dad in the back, Mr. Bosley \"I say boycott T.C. Williams, our boys aren't playing for some Coach Coone.\" I felt Gerry squeeze my thigh before standing up \" Coach, he sole your job! We're not playing for him. I started a petition and I'm sitting this season out.\" Shocked I looked up at Gerry. I knew he was mad about this but so was everyone else, I didn't think he'd sit the season out. Gerry,…. Gerry doesn't know life without football. Its just not who he is, he loves to play! Him sitting a season out is like Pigs flyin. You never believe its gunna happen! Before I could get a word out my daddy stepped in again\" The only place you gunna sit boy is right back in that chair, I appreciate it though\" Alan's dad started up again bout boycotting the school but I wasn't really listening anymore I was just staring at Gerry. \"Gerry what … you cant be serious? Football is your life, you can't just not play this year, it's your senior year.\" I could hear more and more of the boys standing up saying that if my dad isn't Coach then they aren't gunna play. Gerry looked at me, and our eyes met. The thing with Gerry and me is that we've been best friends since we were five and practically been dating since we were ten. We can kind of communicate with out ever saying a word. I've gotten so good at reading him he swears I'm inside his head sometimes. He slowly tore his eyes from gaze and stood up and started clapping with the other guy in the room. Cheryl and I slowly walked towards Coach, who was sitting at the base of an oak tree looking at the fields. \"Dad\" I whispered scared that if I talked to loud something would break this moment. He turned his head to look at Cheryl and me \" It'll be alright coach\" Cheryl sat down next to him and I St down on the other side. He put both of his arms around us. \"I've coached most of these boys since they were your age Cheryl. I've seen em grow up in front of my eyes, almost as if they were my own kids.\" Cheryl and I both interrupted him. \"Almost.\" Dad laughed a little bit at us and nodded his head. \"This is a heck of a time to abandoning em to look out for them selves, aint it?\" Cheryl asked \"So what are you going to do?' My dad looked out at the field once again and then looked at me then Cheryl. \"You girls know what I need to do.\" He got up and gave us both a hand. We all walked back into the house smiling. ... SOOO what do you all think? Please let me know with a review, I really enjoy seeing what you guys think. Im trying to make each chapter a little bit longer in length. I know this is following the movie but it will get different i swear! :)[Chapter 3] Chapter 3! Yay I hope you all enjoy reading this just as much as I like writing it. Disclaimer: don't own anything :( ... \"Come on Cheryl start packing.\" Every year I always have to argue with my sister about packing her clothes if it were up to her she would wait till the last minute and forget almost everything that was essential. I threw some more shorts, and skirts in my suitcase as well as both of my bathing suits. I made sure Chreyl was busy packing in the other room before I went to my closet and my super secret item. It was my lavender dress that would drive Gerry crazy. Its kinda become a tradition of me and Gerry sneaking out to have a romantic dinner by ourselves during football camp. No one could figure this out cause if someone finds then my dad would defiantly find out. There's this bridge over a stream and we'll both meet each other there midnight. Its so romantic, Gerry swears that he's not a softy but deep down he's just a giant teddy bear. I popped out of my daydream when I noticed Cheryl bouncing back into my room \"All ready, sis!\" I could tell Cheryl was excited for football camp this year. \"Good now go tell dad and ill bring our bags to the car.\" Dad parked the car in the school parking lot. I could see the two big blue buses that would be taking all of the football players to camp.\"I'm so excited Steph! Two whole weeks of nothing but eating breathing and playin football.\" Cheryl was practically bouncing up and down. \"Yeah, yeah squirt its gunna be great' I was lookin around for Gerry and some of the boys. I spotted Alan and his dad, Ray and his parents, and finally Gerry and his momma. I was walking towards Gerry when I reliazed, for the first time, that the black and whites had split straight down the middle of the parking lot. \"Hey Mrs. B!\" I loved Gerry's mom as if she was my own since I was Cheryl's age. Gerry wrapped his arm lightly around my waist, pulling me up against him. \"Hello, Stephanie, ready for another year of camp with the boys?\" \"Oh yes, but honestly I think Cheryl is more excited than me.\" I giggled and Mrs. B joined in She knew how crazy Cheryl was about football. \"Now Gerry you listen to me and take good care of Stephanie for the next two weeks\" I looked up at Gerry and saw him blushing but still answered \"Yes momma\" \"Good now ill let you kids get to the bus\" She gave Gerry and me once last hug before slowly walking away to talk to some of the other football mothers. I turned inward so I could wrap my arms around Gerry's neck \"So honey you excited?\" \" You know Stephanie every summer you always ask me that question\" \"And every year you say yes.\" \"Yeah, but sweet cheeks this summer I'm not sure what the answer is\" I frowned when Gerry told me this. \"Well if all is a waste, at least you get to see me everyday\" Gerry's face brightened at this and he lightly kissed my nose. And whispered in my ear \"Now that baby is something to be excited about\" I giggled and blushed as he kissed down to my neck. I felt a presence next to us and Gerry looked up from my neck. It was just Ray \"Hey lovebirds\" \"Hey ray\" \"So Gerry man we still gunna talk with him?\" Wait talk with who? \"Yeah Ray lets go find him\" Gerry let go of my waist and was about to walk away when I put my hand on his chest \"Gerry Nicholas Bertier just what are you about to do?\" \"Nothin you need to worry pretty little head about Stephanie\" \"I wasn't askin you Ray! I don't give a flyin shit about what you do. Now Gerry answer me.\" \"Ray and I are just going to take of some business about the guys.\" He looked me straight in the eye and he had no worry or fear that I could see. \"Ohh alright then. See you on the bus.\" Gerry and Ray walked away right as Cheryl came up tome \"What's wrong kid you look grossed out. What happened?\" \"You and Gerry that's what happened. You two are sickening! Ugh!' I just laughed when Cheryl told me this \"Just wait till you get your own boyfriend, you wont want him to take his lips off you.\" She looked at me like was some kind of alien. \"Umm Stephanie what's Gerry doing?\" \"What do you mean?\" I looked around till I saw him and Ray walking towards Coach Boone. Oh dear lord Gerry Bertier what are you about to do. \"He's being an idiot that's what he's doin.\" I couldn't hear what he was saying to Coach Boone, but I know what Gerry is feeling right now. Gerry is in protective mode and if you don't know Gerry, he's just gunna come off being a jackass. Some random football captain that's thinking he better than everyone. Suddenly I heard Boone say \" Ladies and Gentlemen, I've got an announcement to make, we've got Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin going to camp with us this year.\" I could see more and more people staring at him. \"Jerry tells the jokes and Dean sings the songs and gets the girl. Let's give them a round of applause.\" He was the only person clapping. They started talking back softly till Gerry pointed towards his mother. Then after a few minutes Gerry turned around put his jacket on and got into the bus. \"Hey Stephanie?\" \"Yeah Cheryl?\" \"Whose Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin?\" Before Cheryl and I could get onto the buss all of the guys, black and white, got off and stood there listening to Boone \"Look I don't care if your black, blue, green, white or orange. All of my defensive players on this side\" He pointed to the right \"All of my offensive players on that side.\" He pointed to the left. He started paring the boys up into groups of two. \"Get comfortable, cause the person who you are sitting with, will also be your roommate for the next two weeks.\" After he said that, Cheryl clinged to my leg for dear life. I heard her mutter, \"You're my partner! Don't you dare leave me\" I laughed and shook my head \"I'm not leaving besides if I did Coach would kill me\" \"Good' was all she had to say. We sat one seat front and across from Gerry and his \"roommate\". I could hear someone start to sing then the black guy sitting next to Gerry told him, or Blue I think his name was to shut up. I heard Gerry mutter, \"Got that right.\" Then the black guy turned to Gerry \"You can shut up too.\" I stifled my giggle. While Gerry and his new.. buddy started at each other. It was another long two hours of silence before we reached Gettysburg collage. I swear once Cheryl stepped foot off that buss she was tempted to kiss the ground. Cheryl follwed me, who was following Daddy, to our rooms. \"Now you girls set up and someone will come get you when we need some help ok.\" \"Yes Coach\" we replied at the same time \"Oh and Stephanie keep an eye out on your sister?\" \"Don't I always Coach?\" He shook his head and closed the door behind him. \"So sis what bed do you want?\" ... Soooo please let me know what you guys think about this chapter. Btw this is the longest chapter i've ever written yay![Chapter 4] Chapter 4! I also include one of my favorite scenes in here from Indiana Jones raiders of the last ark, best one! Disclaimer\" I dont own remember the titans and I sure as hell don't own Indiana Jones. Cheryl as I were filling up paper cups with water for the guys. I noticed something went on with all the guys because a) they were all-quiet while lining up and b) Gerry had a huge shiner. Once my table was filled with cups, I sat down on the bench and relaxed in the heat. I enjoyed just listening the sounds around, while the sounds of football players isn't as soothing as the ocean, it can still be enjoyable. \"Why do you all ways sunbathe Stephanie?\" \"Cause I like looking like I have a natural glow about me.\" \"Ugh your so weird!\" \"Hey you're my sister, that means some of my weirdness is bound to rub off on you\" Cheryl made a disgusted sound and walked away to help Dad yell at the boys. Man put her and Boones yelling voices together you could burst someone's eardrum. The first water brake didn't happen till about 3 hours after the guys started. The ice-cold water was now at bout boiling temperature, but the guys didn't seem to mind as they chugged it down. I looked up from laying position to see Gerry eyeing me. I winked and laughed as he blushed and turned back to the field, even after years of being together and best friends he's could still be as shy and nervous as when we had our first kiss. \"Stephanie!\" I heard my dad yelling for me so I got up, and ran to where he was on the field. The guys had gone back to practice by now. \"Yes coach?\" \"I don't want you sittin in the sun all day alright. I'm not saying you have to go inside but do something active with your day ok sweetie?\" \"Yeah Coach I was actually just thinking about going down to the lake. That ok?\" \"Yeah sure, Cheryl?\" Cheryl turned around to face dad \"You wanna go to the lake with your sister?\" Cheryl rolled her eyes and mumbled something before turning around to start shouting at Ray. \"I'm taking that for a no dad.\" We both laughed. This lake was the best place to spend the summer I stripped down to my bathing suit and jumped in from the dock above the lake. The cool water soaked into my sun kissed skin. I spent about an hour more swimming in the lake when I decided I should get back to the campus for lunch. I put back on my regular shorts and button up blouse. When I walked into the cafeteria I prayed this cook was better than the one we had last summer. I practically starved because the food was so terrible. I grabbed a tray and plate and looked under the silver lids. I let out a sigh of relief when I saw mashed potatoes, green beans, rolls, and grilled chicken. When I turned to see all of the tables I groaned, finding Gerry was about to become a little more difficult. After 3 minutes of searching number down the aisle of tables, I find my number 42. I walked to the opposite side he was sitting on, because Ray and Alan were sitting of either side of him. He looked up from his lunch tray when I sat down, and we both smiled at each other. \"So boys, how was the first practice?\" Alan was the first to answer \"Rough, Boone's acting tougher than any of us ever gave him credit.\" \" I heard you guys got into a fight? What happened?\" Once again Alan was first to jump into the conversation \"Gerry and Julius started it, walked into he room and they were swinging at each other.\" I turned my head to look at Gerry, and I'm guessing Gerry kicked Alan in the leg cause Alan said ow and Gerry gave him a look. \"Gerry, what is with all the fighting?\" Gerry didn't have a chance to respond because Boone was shouting at Louie Lastik to come up to the front. Louie stood up in front of the entire lunch crowd \"I want you to tell me something about one of your black team mates.\" \"Sir yes sir. I'm rooming with Blue sir, and I noticed that he wears those leopard spotted underwear, bikini style, sir.\" \"Ok maybe, someone whose not your room mate.\" \"Sir I eat lunch with Rev, that's Jerry Harris, sir, people call him Rev cause he's always praying and he wont abide to a foul tongue sir.\" \"What is Rev going to do after high school?\" \"I don't know, go to collage and all that I guess?\" \"What about you, you're not going to collage?\" \"Oh not me coach, I aint a smart one like Rev.\" \"Think you got a future in football?\" \" Ahh heck no, I just figured if I gotta be I school in might as well hit some people while I'm at it.\" \"Alright, I like that, self aware man, I like that.\" Boone stepped closer to Louie and I couldn't hear what they were saying I turned to the guys \"Remind me to never be against his team when we play in the park.\" I told em while laughing. Gerry said to me \"Stephanie nobody would ever hit you, you're beautiful.\" I blushed and looked down at my tray, while Alan and Ray called Gerry out for being a softie. Then Boone started up with his questions again \"So what kind of music does the rev like?\" \"Oh me and Rev both dig on the Temptations\" \"Oh yeah\" and then Louie Lastik broke out into song, with Aint too proud to beg. Everybody started giggling. Boone laughed at his player and told Louie to stop beggin \"Anybody else? No volunteers? Campbell? Bertier?\" when Boone said Gerry's name I look to Gerry and slightly kicked him under the table. He gave me a stern look and I slumped back in my seat, while Gerry just kept eating his lunch. \"No huh? Each one of you will spend time every day with a teammate of a different race. You will learn about him and his family. His likes and dislikes. You'll report back to me until you meet every one of your teammates. Until that time we will go to three day practices.\" Everyone (well except me and Cheryl) groaned. \"Continue to ignore each other we will go to four day practices. Now any part of this that you don't understand?\" That night after dinner I took Gerry by his hand and led him to the field. \"Stephanie, sweet cheeks, what are we doing out here?\" \"I just wanted to spend some time with my man, who I have barely seen all day. Who got injured cause he was being a jerk.\" \"Stephanie, really im fine, its nothing .\" \"oh yeah then why are wincing with me just barely hugging you?\" He looked away and I knew I was right \"where doesn't it hurt Gerry?\" \"Here\" and he pointed to his elbow. I leaned down to kiss his elbow. \"And here\" he pointed to his forehead. I smiled and pressed a kiss to his forehead \"well here isn't soo bad\" he was pointing to his lips. I smirked; Gerry Bertier thought he was awfully smooth. I placed a light kiss on his lips when he suddenly dipped me and I gasped. As I did so he took this opportunity to slip his tongue into my mouth. I moaned as he kissed me thoroughly. He pulled me back up straight. \"Hmm baby' I whispered as I leaned against his chest. Gerry chuckled; he always loved how easily he could make me swoon. We sat on the football field looking up and the stars and giving each other sweet kisses occasionally. We stayed on the field till lights out which was at ten. Gerry walked me back to my room once we reached my door I stood there looking at him. \"You ready for tomorrow?\" \"Yeah just gunna be the same as today.\" \"Don't forget about what Boone said bout socializing?\" \"Yeah I know\" \"Good\" he came closer towards me and I backed up till I was against my door. \"Goodnight Stephanie\" and then he kissed me one more time, before I could even respond he was walking down the hall \"Goodnight Gerry\"[Chapter 5] Ok sorry this chapter took a little bit longer than my other ones; I was away because of the holiday. Hope you all had just as an amazing time as I did. I was so glad to have reviews! JanuarBaby192, and Damonandonnie4ever thank you guys for being my first reviewers! I really appreciated what you guys told me and the ideas and input! IT really helps me get a sense of what you guys enjoy reading. This chapter is dedicated to you 2! Also I know that Cheryl leaves and comes back to camp but for the sake of the story they are both leaving cause I really want to have Gerry introduce Stephanie to Julius like he did to Emma just so you guys know Enjoy Disclaimer: I don't own anything ... Over the next three days the guys followed coach Boones orders, and spent \"quality\" time together. The practices were getting harder, which I had learned to mean that Boone wasn't pleased about something. I wear that man could make army soldiers shake in fear. I really hope that soon they could learn to get along. It was mid morning and Cheryl and I were packing up our room we had to leave to go see momma and her new husband. We would help out daddy and Boone on one more practice before I drove us to Myrtle Beach, in South Carolina. I was not looking forward to it, and I don't think Cheryl was either. We would be there until two weeks before school started. Once Cheryl and I got to the field, we started on our daily routines, filling up as many cups of water as we could. I was also watching the guys, suddenly Gerry was yelling at everybody \"Get him get him get him get him! What are y'all doing? 44 stack your suppose to know your jobs! Campbell your playin selfish show off football. Hold your man down!\" Geez Gerry way to call him out, I sure as hell didn't expect Julius to make a comeback remark, and don't think any of the team did either. \"Don't you single me out like that! What'd you think I'm stupid or sumthin?\" \"Listen I'm the team captain and I don't need you up in my face all day!\" Once Gerry started going at Julius I straightened my back and slowly was moving in front of the water table. I could my sister hissing my name; right as I turned around Boone blew the whistle. I turned back around to sit on the bleachers. Soon enough they were back to hard-core practice. I had brought some magazines out to look at while Cheryl was watching the practice and picking some flowers. The blue I think it was said something about a water brake, I knew this wasn't going to be good. Boone was suddenly up in the pooor guys face askin him all kinds of questions \" What did you say? I know you just ddint ask for water because water is for cowards, water makes you weak, water is for washing blood off that uniform and you don't get no blood on that uniform, boy you must be outside your mind!\" Cheryl and I looked at each other and nodded. Yepp not good. \"We are going to up downs till Blue is no longer tired and thirsty.\" \" I swear Cheryl how long do you think hell keep makin them do this?\" Boone had been making the boys do up downs for over 30 minutes. Cheryl shrugged cause she was just about as bored as I was. I saw my daddy walk over, I couldn't hear what they were sayin but suddenly Boone blew the whistle twice which let the boys know they were done. Once they stopped they hurtled to the water tables. I could see Alan throwing up. Ugh that's so gross. Suddenly Ray was yelling at someone and then a huge fight broke out. Someone fell down and knocked down the table. Along with all of the paper cups and water dispenser Cheryl got so upset she was throwing cups at them \"Quit it Jerks! Come on your all a bunch of sissy's!\" \"Cheryl!\" I yanked her shoulder back so she would move away from the fight. \"You gotta know better then to get in between the guys when they're fighting you could've gotten hurt!\" Cheryl just stomped her feet and walked towards the main hall, huffin and puffin the whole way. I looked back at where the fight was, to see my daddy breaking it up. Oh dear lord if they cant even agree about whose getting water, then how the hell are they going to pay football as a team! Once they were all sitting on the bleachers, listening to Couch Boone lecture them, once again. I made my way back to talk to daddy. \" Hey\" I said softly as he was standing there watching Boone. \"Hey sweetie. Im sorry you girls have to be seeing all of this.\" I laughed because truth be told, Cheryl's more upset she hasn't been seeing anything. \"Yeah well I think Cheryl doesn't agree with that statement.\" \"Yeah thanks for getting her out of the way.\" \"Of course, speaking of which me and Cheryl should probably hit the road soon. You know cause it's a long drive.\" \"Yeah I can't believe I'm not going to be seeing you girls for quiet some time.\" \" I know daddy, I'm gunna be missing you so much!\" I leaned on his shoulder to give him a half hug. In which he kissed the top of my head \"I love you darlin. I'm going to see Cheryl and give her a hug as well. Is she in the car?\" \"Yeah I believe so, if not could you see if she's in the room, please.\" \"Will do sweetie\" \" Thanks\" I gave my daddy one more kiss and hug before I wander over to where Boone had left the guys. I guess it was lunch break cause some of them had started to wander toward the food hall. I saw Gerry sitting on the bleachers talking to Ray. \" Ill see you Gerry. Have fun talking to your chick.\" I glared at Ray when he walked past me. He knows I hate it when he refers to me like that. \"Come on Steph you know he's just teasing\" Gerry looked at me and once I saw how banged up his face was, all anger left my body. I let my hand graze his face, I tried to put all my love in that touch so maybe, it would magically heal. He leaned into my hand. \"Gerry, baby, you gotta promise me that while I'm gone you aren't going to get into any more fights ok?\" Gerry could see I was about to burst into tears at any moment. \"Yeah sweet cheeks, no more fightin.\" I sniffled and he smiled. I leaned down and he met me halfway in a sweet gentle, loving kiss. I smiled against his lips as his arms wrapped around my waist to pull me closer. Once we pulled a part I told him I was leaving right now. He sat me down in his lap and we spent a few more minutes just sittin there enjoying each other's company. \" You gotta go for lunch. Call me in few days my dad has the number.\" \"Alright I will.\" \"Gerry..?\" \"Hmm\" \"I hope things get better round here.\" I heard him sigh \"Me too sweet cheeks me too.\"[Chapter 6] \"So how are things going over there?\" I was twirling the telephone cord around my finger. I could distantly hear Cheryl yelling at the bids fly away, from outside my window. We had arrived at our momma's beach house that she shared with her boyfriend. Cheryl was playing on the beach with Jonathan, momma's boyfriend. \"Actually not bad we were kinda able to separate our differences. Boone really shined some light on the situation. I'm actually getting along real well with my roommate.\" \"Ahh Gerry you have no idea how proud I am of you. You really stepped up and made better of the situation. That's the Gerry Bertier, I know and love.\" I could pratactilly feel Gerry blushin from the other side of the phone. \"Im captin, and a leader, and uh attitude reflects leadership.\" I smiled Gerry really was being the man I knew he could. \"You know Gerry, I'm umm all alone here in the house. Kinda spooky.\" \"You'll be fine Stephanie, I'm more likely to jump at scary movies than you remember?\" He laughed a little at his own joke. \"Yeah sure you say that now, hmm I better get goin Cheryl's arguing again with the birds and it never turns out well for her.\" \"Alright, tell I wish her luck on that one.\" I laughed \"Ill be sure to do that.\" \"when are you girls heading back ?\" \"Hmm In about a week and a half.\" \" Ok, cool ill see you then. \" \"Uh Gerry..?' \"Yea Steph \" \"Don't you think your forgettin my goodbye.\" \"I just just said ill see you soon.\" \"Gerry you know what kinda goodbye im talking bout.\" \"Steph the guys are right here!\" \"That's nice tell em I say hello and give me a prouper goodbye Gerry Bertier or else you'll be kissin my butt till the cows come home.\" He knows im just playin with but its soo much fun just to hear him squirm. I heard him do a deep sigh. \"I love you sweet cheeks.\" I heard some snickering in the background and some guy commenting on my nickname. \"Well that's good. Haha I love you ger bear.\" \"Ger-bear that's a new one.\" \"Im testing em out seeing which ones my favorite\" \"uhuh ? Well, alright you have a good evening sweet pea.\" \"You too Gerry. Muhuha\" I smooched into the phone as loud as I could and heard him chuckling before he said goodbye and hung up. … AN: ok so i know this is short and i haven't updated in a while I'm so sorry! but I'm gonna try and get better at it.

Ive read pretty mu"},{"Movie":"Lilo & Stitch","Title":"Human Feelings - Alien Wishes","Author":"Derek-L-J-Sohma","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9596732","Passage":"[Chapter 1] \"Stitch? Where'd you go?\" Lilo called from the living room. I didn't call back. If I did, she'd see and freak out. I glanced at the mirror once more. Not that I was hurt or anything, just... I ran my fingers, pink and fleshy, through my fluffy hair. It was short and spiky, the majority of it was the blue of my former fur and the roots were black. I adjusted the jean shorts I'd swiped from David's dresser. I shrugged; I'd buy my own wardrobe after school. And thank Elvis for acne-free alien genes. \"Don't worry, Lilo, I'm sure he'll show up by the time you get home.\" David reassured her. I snorted quietly; I'd show up before then. \"And Pudge's sandwich is in my bag, right?\" Lilo asked. \"Yeah, 'course.\" David laughed. \"Thanks. See ya David, see ya cousin.\" Lilo ran out the door. I hefted my messenger bag and scaled the wall to the window. I bit my lip and pushed open the window, fingers gripping the sill. I grunted, lip bleeding as I tried not to let out a yelp of unbalanced pain. How did Lilo keep up with me? Why was I more apt to getting injured? I shook my head, these questions could wait. I ran as fast as I could and ended up at the school twenty minutes early. Gathering my breath, I knocked on the main office door. For some reason, I was feeling queasy. The lock clicked and I opened the door. The woman behind the desk smiled up at me. \"Aloha, you're our new student, huh?\" She asked. \"Yes ma'am. Elvis Jookiba. It's nice to meet you.\" I greeted with a shy smile. \"Here's your schedule, dear. If you need any help finding them, try to use that map there and don't be too proud to ask for directions, okay?\" She handed me the papers. \"Okay, thanks,\" I left, glancing at the schedule. It was identical to what I'd asked for. Thank Elvis. \"C'mon, Mertle, I just need Gi-gi for an hour or two! Please, I couldn't find Stitch anywhere this morning.\" Lilo's voice caught my attention. \"No way. I don't care if you lost the little blue freak.\" Mertle glared. \"But Gi-gi might, he is her cousin.\" Lilo put her hands on her hips. I felt my stomach churn as Mertle scoffed. \"Uh, excuse me?\" I said hesitantly as I walked up with my schedule and map. I smiled sheepishly at Lilo, \"Could you help me? I really can't figure this map out.\" \"Oh, sure.\" Lilo stepped close, examining my schedule. She smiled up at me, \"It seems we've got the same first class. So you're new, right?\" \"Yeah, just moved here.\" I shrugged and held out my hand, \"I'm Elvis.\" Lilo's smile grew and she shook my hand, \"Lilo.\" \"And I'm Mertle.\" The redhead intruded, far too close to me. \"Hi.\" I said with only a glance at her. Lilo's brow furrowed in confusion when Mertle pressed closer. \"Lilo still carries a doll around, unlike me, who knows how to grow up.\" Mertle blurted. \"Really?\" I asked Lilo. Lilo blushed and shrugged. I grinned, \"Hey, keeping in touch with your childhood is pretty cool.\" Mertle gaped and Lilo peeked up with a smile, \"Really?\" \"Really.\" I nodded. The bell rang, making me jump. Lilo laughed and I blushed. It was apparently obvious because her smile was transforming into a smirk. \"Class is this way, Elvis.\" Lilo lead the way to our first class. I almost pouted that \"Elvis\" wasn't as familiar as I was with Lilo and I couldn't take her hand or hug her without thought. Which, in a way, was the point. To make her see me as not just Stitch, her little brother. Lilo saw my cousins and I as O'hana and, at first, I didn't have any conflicting feelings. But then we started growing up. Mentally for me and both for her. Nani and David got married and I found myself thinking more and more about love. Even Jumba and Pleakley- \"Elvis? You in there?\" Lilo waved her hand in front of my face. \"Huh? Oh, uh, yeah. What's up?\" I asked. She pointed at the teacher. I almost choked in surprise. Standing, in the best disguise I've ever seen on him, with his hands on his hips was Pleakley. He glared. \"Are you going to cause trouble in my class, Mr. Jookiba?\" Pleakley asked, moving a strand of his wig to the side, looking very much like the female he was portraying. \"No, s-ma'am.\" I muttered. \"Good, now take your seat.\" Pleakley pointed at the chair I was next to. I nodded and sat, glancing at my schedule. Period 1: Biology – Lee Bleak. \"Now that I have your attention, this chapter is discussing insects and we will begin with the mosquito.\" Ms. Bleak(Pleakley) said. \"Well, this is going to be interesting.\" I muttered, resting my chin in my palm. Author's Note: Alright, so I began this interesting little fic somewhere near the end of the last school year for me. I have not a clue where it came from but I have enjoyed the writing and challenge its been to keep these guys in character, which I luckily have tons of reference for. So, the main character is Stitch from the Disney film and TV series(es) Lilo and Stitch and most of their canon spin-offs. Anyways, yes, I realize its odd to picture him as a human and romantically interested in Lilo but its how my brain wished to go with it. I hope you enjoy, please fav &/or review! ~Nobu[Chapter 2] \"Why is a whale teaching gym?\" I asked as the school was rushing to the exit. \"Coach Gantu felt safest on this island but couldn't find a place he fit in. So I suggested he try teaching.\" Lilo replied. \"So being the gym teacher is where he belongs?\" I asked, already knowing the answer. \"No, but it's as close as I could get and he seems happy.\" Lilo shrugged. I nodded, \"I like your hair.\" \"A bit random, but thanks, Lilo. I like yours too.\" I laughed. She smiled. \"Is there a reason you asked me for help?\" \"I thought you looked like a good person.\" \"What do you think so far?\" \"I think your 'friends' are jerks.\" I nearly growled. She shrugged and looked away. I took her hand, \"Hey, you don't have to settle for them. There are better people out there.\" \"I know.\" She nodded, then smiled again, \"How do you feel about fish?\" \"Depends on how you mean.\" I raised a brow. \"There's this fish I visit named Pudge. Every Thursday I feed him a peanut butter sandwich because he controls the weather.\" Lilo explained, \"Wanna meet him?\" I couldn't help but laugh. She sounded so excited. Her face fell and I stopped us(still holding her hand), \"That sounds truly awesome, Lilo, I'd love to meet Pudge the Fish.\" She lit back up and was about to say something when a familiar voice cut in, \"Mr. Jookiba, may I speak with you?\" I bit back my growl, let go of Lilo's hand and smiled in Pleakley's direction, \"Of course, Ms. Bleak. See you tomorrow, Lilo.\" Author's Note: Okay, so I had to edit this chpt about 3-4 times on my own to get the spelling right on Pleakley's name and Jumba's last. Also, I watched a good bit of the tv series to tune their characters better. Sorry for the short chpt, the third should be up soon! Please enjoy! Also would appreciate favs &/or reviews! ~Nobu[Chapter 3] \"Bye.\" She replied, giving Ms. Bleak a confused look as I walked to the teacher. \"Yes, Ms. Bleak?\" I asked, watching Lilo leave out of the corner of my eye. \"Is that your natural hair color?\" Ms. Bleak asked. \"Yes ma'am.\" I rolled my eyes. \"And is your last name 'Jookiba'?\" Pleakley's eyes narrowed. \"It's my father's name.\" I said through gritted teeth. I swore to the King of Rock, if Pleakley blew my plan, I'd actually chew his head off. Instead, Pleakley began cussing in his language. Cussing! I stared at him in shock. Finally he noticed and blushed. \"Sorry, it's just that I knew my boyfriend was a cheating man but I needed proof.\" Ms. Bleak began to cry. I swallowed my irritation and pride and patted the sobbing teacher on the back, \"I doubt anyone would want to cheat on you. Such a lovely… lady as you could have whomever she wanted.\" \"Really?\" Pleakley sniffled. \"Really, no smart man would cheat on you.\" I stated, trying not to squirm. Pleakley was so… noisy and sticky when he cried, I didn't want to get stuck to him in this or my real form, \"Uh, Ms. Bleak, I need to get going.\" \"Oh, sorry, didn't mean to hold you up.\" He wiped at his eye. I took off. Maybe I could catch up with Lilo? I smiled as her face shined in my brain. \"Hey Stitch!\" An old, familiar voice called. I stopped on instinct and turned to my cousin, \"Cannonball, hey.\" \"Lilo already went home.\" Cannonball said. I smiled, \"Thanks.\" As I began to walk away, he called again, \"Angel's been looking for you.\" \"Great,\" I growled, making my way to the department/clothing store.[Chapter 4] Halfway to Jumba's second ship, the world got bigger. I cussed, sprouting my extra arms and sped the rest of the way. After putting my new wardrobe in one of the closets and grabbing a handful of Jumba's stash of chocolate covered macadamia nuts, I headed home. Lilo was probably worried to death by now. I felt horrible for my plan but I didn't see any other way. I snuck in, returned David's clothes and entered the front door. \"Stitch!\" Lilo embraced me, tears in her eyes, \"I was looking everywhere for you!\" \"Sorry. Checked on cousins.\" I lied, hugging back. \"I thought you'd been kidnapped or-\" Lilo cut herself off. I shook my head, \"No one gets left behind.\" \"Just don't leave without an explanation, Stitch.\" Lilo said. I nodded. She hugged tighter for a moment. \"School?\" I asked, head tilting to the side. \"Same as usual.\" Lilo shrugged. I felt a blast to my center. I pulled away and walked to the kitchen. As I went, I glanced at my chest just to check. No, I hadn't been physically attacked. I sat and Lilo followed me to the table, \"Everything alright?\" \"Eh. Hungry.\" I nodded and shrugged. Lilo nodded and made me a sandwich. I thanked her and ate it in practical silence. She watched with worry. I left for a moment, coming into the living room where Lilo was sitting with two-year old Kamau on her lap. I placed the old record on the floor and started it up. I put my nail on the spinning disc and projected the King like Lilo had discovered I was able to do shortly after adopting me from the pound. Kamau giggled and did a little jig on her lap. I almost cracked up. The boy was so adorable. And then he started crying. I clapped my mouth shut and went to where he laid on the couch, quicker than Lilo. I gently sat him up and stood on my hand. Kamau began giggling, especially when I fell on my back. \"Hey, Lilo, how was school?\" David leaned against the doorway. \"Alright, same as usual.\" Lilo shrugged then smiled as I did a walking handstand for Kamau. \"Well, I'm glad you're not afraid of clowns anymore.\" David chuckled, \"Cause you live with one.\" I stuck my tongue out at David, getting laughs from all three. David scooped up Kamau and tickled him. The toddler giggled loudly, squirming in his father's grasp. \"Come on to the kitchen, guys, Pleakley and I have just finished dinner.\" Nani called. David airplaned Kamau into the other room. Lilo stood and took my paw. My mind growled a bit at the word. Paw, not hand. I walked with her to the kitchen and we had dinner. [|] \"And the weight grew… Did the inner water level?\" I chewed on some taffy, tapping the dry erase marker against the board I was laying on, \"How'd I measure that? Should ask Jumba.\" \"Stitch!\" Lilo called from the bottom of the elevator. I stood, picking up the board and flipping it just in case. I peeked down at her. Lilo lit up with a grin and I felt my lips echo it, \"Eh?\" \"Nani says lights out.\" Lilo informed me before conspiratorially beckoning me. I crawled halfway down the elevator and leaned toward her. She pulled a \"ParaNorman\" DVD from her back. She waved the movie in front of me, \"Wanna sneak to the ship and watch it together?\" \"School tomorrow.\" I said, wishing I hadn't as her face fell. \"So, that's a no.\" Lilo sighed. \"Meega want to.\" I took her hand, \"Stitch don't want Lilo in trouble.\" \"I'll be fine, Stitch.\" She gave me a pout, \"Pleaaaaassssseeeeee?\" I shook my head before jerking it upward, \"Room.\" \"Awesome!\" Lilo beamed and kissed my nose. I silently thanked Jumba for giving me so much fur and climbed back into my room. I turned the lights off as Lilo followed. I took turned on the computer on my desk, standing next to her. She picked me up and placed me in her lap. The movie was good, a bit creepy but funny and Lilo fell asleep halfway through. She breathed slowly, rustling my fur. Needless to say, Lilo wasn't the only one who missed the second half. When the movie ended, I carried her to her room. As I did, my ears picked up a conversation I wished they hadn't. \"What're we going to do about Stitch?\" Nani sighed. \"What do you mean?\" David asked as I placed Lilo in her bed. \"Y'know, him being… in love with Lilo.\" I dropped Scrump, paws shaking. \"Kweesta!\" I cursed. I paced, I couldn't believe it was that obvious! \"So? It's Stitch, he's not gonna do anything about it. Technically he can't.\" I heard David shrug. \"Still, if he sees her like that we should-\" \"Should what, Nani? Condemn him? Exile him? Put him down?\" David asked before continuing, \"Whatever you do to him will effect Lilo, likely badly.\" \"I know, I know.\" Nani sighed. [|] \"Wishy-washy!\" I walked over. \"Hi Stitch. You're gonna ask the same thing?\" My lavender-bluish teddy bear-like cousin asked. \"If you don't mind.\" I smiled. \"Okay.\" Wishy-washy nodded. [|] \"Thanks, cousin.\" I pulled on some red swimtrunks. \"Good luck with the experiment.\" Wishy-washy walked away. I quickly ducking into the ship and dressed before running to school. I dodged Mertle's group and got to the door about a minute before Lilo. I saw her coming to Pleakley's door and held it open for her. She blinked, blushed a bit and smiled, \"Aloha, thanks.\" \"You're welcome and hello.\" I smiled back. Lilo entered the room and I followed. I perched myself on a desk, \"How're you, Lilo?\" \"Well, and you?\" Lilo asked. \"Good, a bit tired from a movie, but hey.\" I laughed. \"A scary movie?\" Her eyes lit up. \"Despite clay undead, not really.\" I shrugged. \"'ParaNorman'? Or 'Frankenweenie'?\" Her head tilted. \"'ParaNorman'.\" I chuckled. \"I thought it was awesome!\" Lilo grinned. \"It was,\" I rolled my eyes as though that was obvious, \"just not scary.\" \"Hey! Sit on a chair!\" Ms. Bleak snapped. I stared at Pleakley, trying to figure out how he faked two eyes. \"Elvis, please do as she asked.\" Lilo said. Ms. Bleak suddenly wielded a spray bottle, \"Get off my desks!\" I blanched and jumped down, watching the bottle carefully. I took my seat. Proud with herself, Ms. Bleak returned to her desk. I looked up from my fingers to see Lilo looking at me with interest. \"Are you afraid of water?\" She asked. I shrugged, \"I'd say drowning is more accurate.\" \"Oh, sorry.\" Lilo blushed. \"No need, I surf despite it.\" I waved it off, the corners of my lips turning up as my chest warmed. \"Cool! I go with my brother all the time.\" Lilo grinned. I hoped to Elvis she was talking about David. \"Maybe we'll swim into each other sometime.\" I smiled bigger. My brain was screaming every translation of \"no\" that I knew. \"Maybe,\" She nodded, then pulled out a camera and turned to the teacher, \"Ms. Leak?\" The teacher looked up and smiled, \"Oh fine, go ahead, Lilo.\" \"Thank you.\" Lilo snapped a shot of the teacher and turned to me with it held up. I laughed and nodded, putting up a peace sign. She took a pic and put up the camera as the second bell rang. [|] \"What the hell is a 'trog'?\" I asked. \"Not sure, I think it's similar to being called a 'maggot'.\" Lilo shrugged. \"Ah, that makes sense.\" I said. She nodded. I cleared my throat, \"Well, I gotta head home to do some chores. I'll see you tomorrow.\" \"Alright, later.\" Lilo waved. I winked and headed to the ship, wondering why I'd done the former. I was heading home in my true form when I was tackled. A familiar, almost intoxicating scent filled my nose as my ears welcomed the sound of, \"Boojiboo!\" I groaned, looking back at the pink experiment, \"Hi Angel.\" She grinned at me, purring, \"Boojiboo~.\" \"Naga.\" I glared. \"Boojiboo?\" Angel pouted. \"Off.\" I said. Angel continued to pout at me. I gave her a look, \"I will throw you.\" \"Fine.\" Angel stood and got off, looking like a kicked puppy, \"Boojiboo mean.\" \"Meega naga boojiboo.\" I gathered myself. \"Naga, you boojiboo.\" Angel said. \"Naga.\" I snapped. Angel glowered back, knowing I'd not agree. \"Lilo tay boojiboo?\" She huffed. \"Lilo meega achi-baba.\" I stated. She put her hands on her hips and gave me a look. \"Aggaba lying.\" Angel said. \"Meega naga lying.\" I said, then shrugged, \"Yuuga naga smish. Asyrifah.\" \"Megga tay boojiboo.\" Angel called as I walked the rest of the way home. Author's Note: Hey guys, sorry for taking so long but I got seriously blocked by other stories! But to make it up to you guys, I am posting two chapters which you guys deserve more than just two for your patience and I thank you for such patience and support! :) I hope you guys enjoy and it makes you smile. I got most of Stitch and Angel's conversation translated via these links: wiki/Tantalog_language art/Tantalog-183022562 ~Nobu[Chapter 5] A week passed, with only minor difficulties. The change always lasted until about an hour or two after the school day ended. I'd only seen Angel that once so far, praising luck for not having her stay with us. She'd decided to keep Reuben company so that Gantu wasn't always bullying him, or something like that. I strummed my guitar with a smile, mouthing the lyrics of \"Aloha 'Oe\", as I walked along the shoreline. I had my eyes close, navigating by sound and smell. I moved past the guy with mint chocolate chip icecream, hoping he wouldn't drop it this time. My ears perked at the familiar sound of a camera clicking and the icecream falling. I paused, eyes opening, waiting to see if I'd hear who I expected the culprit to be. \"Oh, sorry, that always happens doesn't it?\" Lilo's voice reached me. I turned, seeing him shrug it off and walk on, shoulders slightly slumped. Lilo checked her camera and pouted, \"Dammit, it's filled again.\" I began playing again, turning back the way I came. I smiled as I heard her footsteps behind me. She leaned forward to look me in the face, eyes wide with surprise. I raised a brow at her, \"Aloha, Lilo.\" \"Aloha, Elvis, I didn't know you could play the guitar.\" Lilo fell into step with me. \"I've never had it around you.\" I smirked. She blushed, \"You play really well.\" \"Thanks, I blame my namesake.\" I laughed, smirk warming into a smile. \"He is the King for a reason.\" Lilo smiled, \"I can play too.\" \"Really?\" I asked, fingers stopping. \"Really.\" Lilo nodded. \"Play something then.\" I handed her the guitar. She looked surprised for a moment before her fingers danced upon the strings. I watched, taking in the details. She'd closed her eyes and was singing. I placed my hand on the small of her back and made sure she didn't walk into anyone. I chuckled a bit, unable to stop myself from singing along. \"We should make a guitar club.\" Lilo said, breaking the music. \"That would be pretty cool, do you think we could?\" I smiled. \"Yeah, why not? We're not the only ones who can play and I'm sure we could find a teacher to let us.\" Lilo beamed. \"Okay, but when would we meet and for how long?\" \"Hm, how about Tuesdays? Til three?\" \"That could work. First we should find a teacher to support it.\" \"I think I could get Ms. Bleak to agree.\" \"Ms. Bleak hates me.\" \"She doesn't hate you, Elvis, she just… thinks you might be trouble.\" \"I do have blue hair, guess I must be a juvenile delinquent.\" \"That's not why. You have caused a few disturbances since you got here.\" \"Only like three.\" I pouted. She laughed, \"True, but you still have.\" \"Yeah, yeah.\" I sighed. \"She doesn't hate you, you know that.\" Lilo bumped me gently with her hip. I blushed, \"If you insist.\" \"I do.\" Lilo said. \"Ah, well, I better head home, I'll see ya at school, okay?\" I faked a smile. \"Don't forget this.\" She handed me back my guitar with a look of curiosity. \"Thanks, bye.\" I said, changing course toward Jumba's ship. \"Bye.\" She called after. [|] I slipped into the ship, already heading for my hidden closet. I turned a corner and saw both Jumba and Pleakley standing before me with crossed arms. I blanched, freezing. I calculated the possibility of them thinking I was just a human and the quickest way out of the situation. \"Hello, Elvis.\" Pleakley said. His voice was so condescending that I sneered back, my own arms crossing, \"Well good evening, Ms. Bleak, how are you?\" \"626, would you care to be explaining?\" Jumba asked. \"Depends, are you going to tell the humans?\" I replied. \"Don't you take that tone with him, you little monster.\" Pleakley snapped. I growled, \"I'm not a monster any more than you are, toobaga!\" \"Aggaba, 626.\" Jumba said. I felt my temper turn for the worst as I felt heat sear my chest, \"Ah-Qae jihad! Ah-Qae yuuga, Jumba!\" \"Meega naga baaheth jihadi yuuga, 626.\" Jumba darkened. \"My name isn't 626! It's Stitch!\" I paused, \"Technically it's also Elvis!\" \"Why're you disguised as a human?\" Jumba said calmly, adding, \"Stitch.\" \"Ask Nani or David, I'm sure they could explain.\" I muttered, sinking to the floor. Pleakley gasped, eye wide, \"Lilo.\" \"What about little girl?\" Jumba frowned. Pleakley looked at me. I sighed and nodded, \"Lilo meega boojiboo.\" \"Oh.\" Jumba blinked one set of eyes then the other. \"Have you told her?\" \"Naga, meega O'hana.\" I felt myself shift back into my real form. \"Which is why you decided to enroll at school as Elvis?\" Pleakley guessed. \"Ih.\" I said. \"Elvis Jookiba has a chance I don't.\" \"Why'd you choose that last name?\" Jumba asked. I laughed, looking up at him warily, \"We share genes, right?\" Jumba nodded. Pleakley crouched beside me, \"Heegata no Feebee, little kaphong, yuuga rah'quadon anything.\" \"Naga, I can't.\" I said, \"But Elvis can.\" Author's Note: Hey guys, I can't believe my last update was in friggin' January. Holy crap. Okay, so instead of two, you're getting three chpts today! I am so freaking sorry, guys, I know how it is to be waiting forever on a story update. I hope this makes it up to you. Thanks for your patience and support! I hope you enjoy! I got all the alien speech from: Tantalog_Language Tantalog_Language2 ~Nobu[Chapter 6] At this point, I thought my interest in Lilo was obvious and would have discouraged Mertle. I was wrong about the latter. \"Aloha, Elvis~.\" Mertle purred as she pressed close to me. The angle she held herself allowed me easy viewing of her bosom, something I would never, ever want to see and have mostly bleached from my mind. I held her at arm's length, ignoring my gag reflex, \"Dude, personal space.\" \"Oh c'mon~.\" She cooed with a look that has only worked for Angel and then, only twice. \"No, seriously, I like my air.\" I said. She batted her lashes, \"I like your air too.\" Dear King, someone get her a strait jacket, \"Look, class is about to start and I don't want you getting me in trouble.\" \"Aw, you're so sweet.\" Mertle giggled, kissed my cheek and went to her seat. I swallowed hard, moving the bile back down my throat. I rested my head on the desk, wishing for a firefight with Gantu. Damn, I missed that. [|] Mertle tagged me all the way to the Gym before I broke. I turned to her, frustrated and said, \"I will go on one date with you but you must promise to stop bothering me afterwords!\" \"Of course.\" She beamed, \"Friday at six! See ya!\" I watched her go, knowing she'd lied, but then again, I wasn't planning to be a cooperative date. [|] The rest of week passed depressingly quickly, my favorite parts being mere instants as I dreaded the time I would have to… date Mertle. I so shouldn't have lost my patience. I was such a toobaga. I told Lilo a simple lie about where I was going, one that I actually had cousin cooperation on. Unfortunately, before I could leave, Jumba waylaid me. \"Stitch, come with me.\" He said firmly. \"Busy.\" I replied. \"It being important!\" The scientist snapped. I sighed and followed him to his and Pleakley's room. Jumba closed and locked the door, looking more mad than usual. \"Ih?\" I asked. \"Minute!\" Jumba said, scouring his desk before exclaiming in triumph and turning to me with a large vial of… flesh colored liquid. \"What is that?\" I frowned. \"Solution.\" \"To?\" \"Your use of Wishy-Washy.\" \"How?\" \"It will perform the same effect as your wishing in changing you to human for the same amount of time per teaspoon.\" Jumba stated. \"Teaspoon?\" I asked. He shrugged with a chuckle, \"It was the only thing laying around when I made it.\" \"I see. Thanks.\" I reached for it. \"No, first you must agree that you will tell the little girl before it runs out.\" Jumba stated. \"Ih, I promise.\" I crossed my heart and held out my paw expectantly. Jumba nodded, muttering something and passing it to me. I thanked him and swiftly left to change. Author's Note: The beginning of this chapter is just freaking ridiculous and makes very little sense but hey, it fit the plot. So, I hope you enjoy this chpt! ~Nobue[Chapter 7] Warning! Includes the f-word! After a swift closet raid, I arrived at the movie theater in the tackiest clothing on the island, if not the world. Mertle was resting against a wall in an outfit that would have most teen boys drooling their eyes out. I nearly threw up then and there. \"Elvis~.\" She cooed, moving toward me, \"Don't you look… unique.\" \"So do you, Mertle. Now let's get this damn date over with.\" I headed to the ticket booth. Mertle took my arm, stopping me and giving me the most serious look I've seen her wear in my Elvis skin, \"Look, you're cute and, in a weird way, kinda awesome but I've not been going around flirting with you because I like you.\" \"What?\" I blinked. \"You heard me.\" She pulled at her hair tips, \"No, I've made this big of a flirt of myself because I want to see Lilo admit defeat for once.\" \"What!?\" I growled. She made a surrendering signal, \"Hey, it's not what you think. Okay, so, since forever, Lilo's had all this amazing stuff happen to her. She's got a great family who loves her very much and always tries to be there for her. And I… I'm jealous of the happiness I've always seen her have.\" \"Are you shitting me?\" I snarled, my voice shifting more to my normal tones than Elvis', \"Do you even remember when you two were really young? You tortured her every day because she was weirder than you! And she was and is weird because – as I know you know – her parents died in a car crash! Which is a traumatic experience, mind you! Did you know that or were you just being a cruel little child because she was different!?\" \"I…. She…\" Mertle paled, her eyes wide in horror as she stuttered. \"You're a pathetic little bitch, you know that Mertle? All she wanted was to be friends with you and you tormented her! Y'know what?! Fuck you and fuck this! Have a nice, long, lonely damned life!\" I stormed away, seething and clenching my fists as to not hit anyone. [|] I found the highest not lava'd point on the island, looked to the sky and screamed at the top of my lungs. When I was out of both air and pent up frustrations, I headed down to the beach. The calm lap of the waves, the gentle shifting of sand beneath my feet and the smell of sun-fried tourists filled my senses, as if calling me home. I found a deserted area near enough for short trips to the waves but far from it being swept away in the tide. In an hour or two I'd managed to make a pretty decent sand castle before I rented a board. A tired smile spread across my face as I leisurely headed toward the choice waves. Time to see if I could surf and not drown. I saw my wave, shifting seamlessly into a stand as I came to it. I adjusted my weight just so that I would turn to catch wave beneath my steady board. To my excitement, I slipped into the barrel, a hand reaching into the cool salt water. I push my mass this way and that, the board going faster and I slipped from beneath the wave. Man, there was nothing like a beautiful day and a perfect surf. Author's Note: Yeah, I know it's short and I'm sorry about that but I really think that sums up the chpt. It fits to end that way. Oh and to anyone who's wondering, in the movie subtitles - at least the Netflix ones - spell Mertle as \"Myrtle\", I do realize this but I believe the tv series spelled it the way I've been spelling it the entire story now. Anyways, I do hope you enjoy! ~Nobu[Chapter 8] The weekend proved to be... interesting. Lilo and I ended up spending the entire time together doing chores. You think super strength would make things go quicker, right? You'd be wrong. Part of me thinks Nani meant for it to take that whole time up. Either way, doesn't matter, we did the chores. Jumba managed to save us a little by having us help him with an experiment about chemical reactions that caused semi-explosive results. The three of us had giggled like villains when the twenty two-liters of soda pop were met by mint candies and blasted upwards. Even Nani's scolding couldn't keep that from being awesome. The weekend came to a close with the humans, Pleakley, Jumba and I watching an old movie together. It had been Lilo's favorite one. Something about a giant ape being calmed by a human woman who it'd fallen for. Ironic, huh? Anyways, Monday began with Lilo giving me a tight, happy hug and jogging off to catch the school bus. Pleakley had left about half an hour earlier to get to school before any of the students. Shortly after Lilo, Nani headed to work herself. I managed to slip out of the house, knowing Jumba had my back for once. A quick change and I found myself almost late. Pleakley gave me a look as I settled into my seat. And so began the mundane schedule of school. Finally, the school day came to an end and I was walking with Lilo to the exit. For some reason she kept glancing at me, biting her lip. I turned to her and raised a brow, \"Need something, Lilo?\" \"Oh, uh, no.\" She gave a sheepish laugh and looked thoughtful for a moment, \"Hey, do you want to hang out tomorrow after school?\" I blinked in surprise but couldn't keep a smile from my lips, \"Yeah, I don't see why not. Where do you want to meet up?\" \"How about my house?\" She asked. \"Sure.\" I smiled. Shit . We said our goodbyes and went our separate ways. [|] That night, I stayed up, working on giving myself a vehicle out of the hover crafts Jumba had made us for our first Christmas. It was pretty simple, after all, I was able to keep the wheel structure and changing ability and simply had to craft the body. Okay, so it would have taken a normal human about two months, but not only was I made to be super strong, I was made to be super smart so it was nothing to whip up in about two days. Tuesday morning, I was helping myself to some coffee just as Lilo was heading to school. Ah, perfect timing. Like normal, I changed and headed out except today I had my guitar. After school had finished it's final class, I took a sip of the potion Jumba had given me, shuddered at the taste and slipped back into Ms. Bleak's class. Lilo and several of other students sat atop desks, guitars in their laps. Ms. Bleak clapped, \"Alright, so, shall we hear everyone do a piece?\" A mumbled acceptance of this idea was heard and I sat next to Lilo. Our eccentric teacher grinned and took it a step further. The songs had to be meaningful to us in some fashion. I was rather surprised at how willingly the others did so and how skilled they were. Most seemed to pick a song from their early childhood and Lilo was no different, picking an Elvis song. I was after Lilo and I hadn't intended to do the song I did. My fingers strummed of their own accord and my voice followed suit, doing Safetysuit's \"You Don't See Me\". As I sung and played, I could feel Lilo and Pleakley staring at me though my eyes were closed. I felt a bit selfish about the song, but it was my truth. One of the students played and sung \"This Song Saved My Life\" by Simple Plan and pretty much everyone got up and gave the young man a tight hug. Even I had been caught off guard and hugged him because of the truth that came from him when he'd sung it. It was amazing and beautiful and I was incredibly glad to have been part of that moment. Author's Note: Okay, guys, here is the eighth chpt, if there are any editing issues, please inform me, I wrote this about an hour before I posted it here, so I have not edited it at all. Anyways, I do hope you enjoy! ~Nobu[Chapter 9] Here's chapter 9, guys. I know it's been nearly a year since I updated this, so I apologize. This chapter so did not go as planned, so it took a while to write. Please enjoy! ~Nobu So the day that Lilo and I had scheduled my hanging out at the house arrived. All through the school day, my left leg wouldn't stop bouncing. My hand never left the small vial of potion I'd be using to be Elvis after school Shit, why had I agreed? I thought again and again as the time flew. I jumped when the last bell rang. This was such a bad idea. Lilo came to my side with a smile, \"Hey.\" \"Hey, Lilo.\" I gave a smile back. My heart was beating faster and my stomach twisted with anxiety. \"Ready to go?\" She asked. \"Uh, I actually have a few things to get from my locker.\" I swallowed, \"So, I'll meet you there. Could… could you tell me the, um, address again? Sorry.\" \"Yeah, no problem, Elvis.\" Lilo kindly repeated the address. I nodded, making sure I looked like I was committing it to memory, \"Got it. See you there.\" \"Alright, see you.\" Lilo waved and headed out to the bus. I turned and opened my locker, banging my head lightly on the back wall of it. I heard someone walk toward me and looked up at them with a sigh. \"How far are you going to have this go?\" Ms. Bleak asked. \"Not much farther.\" I murmured. \"She's not going to take it well when she figures it out.\" The teacher stated. \"What do you suggest I do?\" I asked. \"Elvis could die.\" \"No. I can't do that to her. Lilo has lost too many people and almost lost me several times. I can't hurt her like that.\" There was a quiet moment between them before Pleakley got a look. I realized what the look meant and I shook my head fiercely. \"It's the best way to keep her from hurting a lot in the future.\" He whispered. \"I am not standing her up!\" I snarled. I clenched and unclenched my fists trying to reign in my emotions. Didn't Pleakley understand? This was my only chance to be with Lilo! The only way she'd see me as something other than O'hana! But what happens when she finds out? The stray thought burned my heart more than Lilo forever viewing me as O'hana. Tears pricked my eyes. I knew what would happen if she found out. She'd hate me. Forever. \"What I'm doing is unforgivable, isn't it?\" I asked, voice shaking. \"No, not unforgivable, but it'd be really hard to forgive for certain.\" Pleakley said gently. I nodded and closed the locker. With a whisper of thanks, I left. I drove to Jumba's ship. I went inside and settled into a corner. I stared at the floor, feeling numb and empty as tears flowed from my eyes. The potion wore off but I stayed, my eyes not empty of the pain I felt and the pain I knew I was causing Lilo. All Lilo had ever wanted was a trustworthy friend and a happy family. And I was throwing such a wrench in that because of my stupid selfishness. [|] It was about nine-o'clock when I finally entered the house. Lilo met me at the door. She looked upset. I wasn't sure by whom. Stitch or Elvis. Part of me really didn't care. I had hurt her any which ways. \"Stitch! I was just about to go find you. Is everything alright?\" Lilo asked. I nodded, \"Ih, sorry. Was tinkering.\" \"It's okay. I'm just glad you're okay.\" Lilo smiled gently. \"Want me to heat up some leftovers for you?\" \"Naga. Safiya.\" I said. Lilo frowned but nodded, \"Um, alright. Night.\" \"Jhau tehrqua.\" I meandered off to my room. I collapsed unto my bed and groaned into my pillow. Tomorrow was going to be pure hell. [|] When I woke, I was considering just not going to school. But that would just make matters worse. So, I did my school day routine and got to school five minutes before Pleakley's class. Lilo noticed me and walked over, frowning. I took a deep breath and waited for her. She reached me, \"Hi, Elvis.\" \"Hey, Lilo.\" I said quietly. The floor was very interesting, I'll admit. \"So, what happened yesterday?\" She asked. I gulped, \"Well, my, um, dad called me while I was getting the stuff from my locker and…\" \"And?\" Concern was slowly overshadowing irritation. \"And apparently we're leaving next week.\" I whispered. I glanced up at her through my lashes. \"What? But you've only been here like two weeks.\" Lilo's brows furrowed. I gave a half-shrug, \"My dad and I are always moving for his job. I'm sorry about yesterday.\" \"No, it's okay.\" She looked at me with sympathy. By Elvis, do I hate myself. I thought and gave her a partial smile. \"Oh, hey, Lilo, been awhile.\" An older teen approached with a smile. My stomach twisted as I recognized Lilo's first crush. The knot it formed fell to my feet as she blushed and beamed at the older human. Bitterness and jealousy filled where my stomach should have been. Guess it's a good thing I'm giving up. \"So, who's this you're hanging out with?\" He asked, looking to me. \"Oh, this is my friend,\" Lilo gestured to me, unaware of how my shoulders stiffened, \"Elvis.\" Keoni froze midway in holding out his hand to shake and looked to me with a crooked smile, \"Elvis? Really?\" \"Yeah, really, my dad's a big fan.\" I shrugged, making sure my voice wasn't alien. \"What about you?\" \"Pardon?\" He asked. I put on a polite smile, \"I didn't catch your name, dude.\" \"Right, sorry, I'm Keoni.\" He completed the gesture of offering his hand. We shook. \"Nice to meet you.\" I lied. \"Pleasure's all mine.\" He said. \"Morning, Lilo, Elvis.\" Pleakley murmured as he walked by distractedly. \"Uh, Lilo, does your aunt work here?\" Keoni asked, gaze turning to Ms. Bleak. \"Yup.\" Lilo shrugged, \"Why?\" \"Oh kweesta.\" Pleakley quietly gasped. The three of us all looked over at the teacher. Lilo's eyes had shot wide and her lips parted in shock. Keoni must not have caught exactly what Pleakley had said because he looked confused. My brows had risen, having not expect that word from the one-eyed man. \"Pardon?\" Lilo managed after a few moments. \"I said 'fiesta'.\" The teacher stated, \"I was thinking your uncle and I could go on vacation to Spain soon, Lilo.\" \"Oh, that'd be really cool for you guys.\" Lilo gave a false smile. \"Sounds fun.\" I agreed. Keoni simply nodded, his eyes still on Ms. Bleak, and Pleakley scurried off. \"So, you're aunt's still… weird, huh?\" Keoni said. Lilo frowned at him, \"Yes, is there a problem with being weird?\" \"No, no, I was just surprised by how little had changed is all.\" He gave a tense little laugh. \"Well, Elvis and I have to get to class.\" Lilo said, taking my hand and beginning to follow after our teacher. \"Oh, okay, so I'll talk to you later, then?\" It probably hadn't meant to come out as a question. I gave Keoni a salute as we moved into the classroom, trying not to smirk.[Chapter 10] Hi guys! I'm sorry it's taken such a long time to update this! Lots of personal stuff got in the way, so yeah, you know how it goes. Anyway, there's probably only one or two chapters left but I really hope you guys have enjoyed this so far and will enjoy how it ends as well! Thank you so much for your patience and I hope you like it! ~Nobu \"Old crush?\" I asked as we settled into our desks. Lilo's head snapped up and over, her cheeks darkening, \"Wh-what?\" \"That Kohai dude or whatever.\" I gestured to the door. \"You had a crush on him, right?\" \"What? Why would you think I had a crush on Keoni as a kid?\" Lilo frowned. \"Because I never said it was a childhood crush.\" I smirked and wagged my brows. Lilo lightly slapped my arm, \"Shut up. Besides, he's obviously an ass. Did you hear what he said about my aunt?\" \"Yeah, that was pretty rude. Ms. Bleak is a pretty awesome teacher. A bit obsessed with insects, but that's cool and really informative.\" I smiled. \"So you like bugs?\" Lilo asked. \"Ih, I mean, they're really fascinating to watch.\" I nodded. Her head canted, strands of her hair falling over her shoulder, \"True, depending on which ones. I doubt mosquitoes have interesting patterns like caterpillars or bees.\" \"Well, that's quite a shame, Miss Pelekai, for mosquitoes are going to be our subject today.\" Ms. Bleak smiled. [|] \"So, Elvis, are you going to tell me your secret?\" Lilo asked. I nearly choked on my water, \"What?\" \"I was just wondering how you got Mertle to stop acting so weird.\" She shrugged. \"Oh, right, that.\" I let out a nervous chuckle, \"Well, she asked me out.\" \"Wait, what?\" Lilo's brows furrowed in confusion. \"She asked me out?\" I frowned at her, \"And I said no, of course.\" \"But why?\" Lilo asked. My grip tightened around my bottle, \"I don't know. Maybe she thinks I'm hot or that it'd bother you.\" \"But you were very clearly not interested in her.\" \"Yeah, well, I don't know what to tell you, Lilo.\" She sighed and fiddled with her phone. I turned my gaze to my food. We sat in that heavy silence until the lunch bell rang. [|] \"So, two more days.\" Lilo greeted. \"Yup.\" I shoved my hands into my pockets. Her gaze stayed on me as we walked to the classroom. I felt myself scrunch up under her scrutiny. We got all the way to our seats before I couldn't take it any longer. \" What ?\" I snapped. \"Nothing, I just,\" Lilo blushed and looked down, \"I just kinda wondered why you seem so sad. I mean, this happens all the time with your dad's job and all, right?\" \"Yeah, it does.\" I muttered. She furrowed her brow at me. I figured she wanted me to answer the first statement. A small laugh left my lips, \"And I'm sad because I don't really ever make any friends when I move to new places. Let me tell you, Lilo, you make an amazing friend.\" \"So do you.\" Lilo gave me a sad smile. \"Thanks.\" I blushed. Ms. Bleak looked up from her notes then, \"Oh, Mr. Jookiba, Miss Pelekai, you're in early.\" \"Yeah, sorry for not greeting you when we came in.\" I smiled. I turned to Lilo to find she was frowning at the blackboard. I followed her gaze to see plant anatomy. I frowned. Why is she frowning at something we were already told we'd be covering? [|] I frowned down at a note scrawled in familiar handwriting. \"Elvis, Would you please meet up with me in Ms. Bleak's class after school? There's something I want to talk to you about. Lilo\" I couldn't stop glancing at it every few seconds. What does she want to talk about? Please, please, please tell me she hasn't fallen for Elvis. Or-… Shit. What if she knows ? No, I've been super careful, there's no way. Maybe a going away party? Dammit, I don't know. I was pulled from my thoughts as I got close to the familiar door. I took a deep breath, counted to ten and opened the door. [|] \"Lilo?\" I entered the room, \"Ms. Bleak?\" \"Hello, Elvis.\" Lilo said. I turned to find her standing at her desk, \"Oh, hey, Lilo.\" The door shut and I jumped, noticing Pleakley standing by his desk. \"Hi, Ms. Bleak.\" I greeted. \"So, is this how you maintain your form, Stitch?\" Lilo asked. My head snapped toward her. She was holding up the full potion beaker. I let out a confused laugh, \"Stitch? Who's that?\" Lilo's eyes narrowed and she stepped forward, \"Cut the crap.\" \"Wh-what?\" I managed. \"Do you think I'm stupid? That I wouldn't find out?\" Lilo growled. \"What? No, of course you're not stupid, Lilo.\" I said. \"Then why the hell are you pretending, Stitch? Why did you turn into this ?\" She gestured at my human body. \"Language, Lilo.\" Pleakley said. Her glower turned to the teacher, \"And you knew about this, right? You knew from the beginning.\" \"I knew before Jumba made the potion.\" Pleakley said, shrinking. I shot of panicked look at Pleakley. The teacher showed sheepish sympathy. \"Are you going to explain, Stitch? Or should I guess?\" Lilo's voice drew my gaze. \"I wanted… I wanted to see… to see what it was like. To be,\" I swallowed, \"human.\" \"Why?\" Lilo asked. \"Because… well, there's only two others who are like me and one of them is obsessed. And even then, we're so… different.\" I whispered. \"Why didn't you tell us? Me? I could've helped you learn. I would've been there for you.\" Lilo said. I shrugged and looked down. \"There's another reason then.\" Her tone filled with frustration. \"It's none of your business.\" I breathed. \"We're O'hana, Stitch!\" She objected. \"If it matters to you, it's important to me.\" Pleakley stepped forward, looking to say something. \"No.\" I snapped, firm. Her eyes widened. \"I am not your O'hana, Lilo.\" I growled. \"Wh-what?\" She squeaked. \"I am not your dog or your little brother or your damned cousin! I haven't felt like we were O'hana since we hit puberty. And,\" I winced before whispering, \"I'm in love with you.\" Silence suffocated the room. I cleared my throat and swallowed, \"So, now… now you know.\"[Chapter 11] Author's Note: I'm sorry this took so long to get out but the ending kept changing on me and ever evolving until finally I wrote this chapter. To be honest, I'm a little concerned that you guys will hate it but I feel like this is the right way to end it. It's the only ending that actually stuck. So for the last time in this fic, I hope you guys enjoy! ~Nobu Frustration filled Lilo's voice, \"What the fuck do you mean you're in love with me?\" \"It means I'm not O'hana!\" I snapped. \"That's bullshit! We adopted you!\" \"To be your dog ! Which I've had to pretend to be ever since! Despite that I'm more intelligent than any fucking human on this damned island!\" \"We've treated you like a brother since we found out!\" \"I am not your brother !\" I slammed a fist into a desk. It kiltered and clattered upon the ground, \"Why can't you wrap your head around that!?\" \"Because I don't get it!\" Lilo said. \"Why not?\" I snapped. \"Because I'm Aromantic , dammit!\" She shouted. I blinked a few times, leaning back. Lilo ran a hand through her hair. I felt my brow furrow and my frustration ebb into confusion and curiosity. I bit my lip and cautiously said, \"I don't know what that means.\" \"It means,\" Lilo took a long breath, \"It means that I'll never be romantically attracted to anyone. That I won't fall in love the way Nani and David did… The way you did.\" Lilo straightened her shoulders and glared me down, \"Not that that makes me any less than someone who will.\" \"I never would think you lesser than anyone, Lilo.\" I said. \"I wouldn't either.\" Pleakley interjected, \"I mean, it's not like it's a strange thing, aromantism. It's perfectly common.\" Lilo frowned at Pleakley. He raised his hands in surrender. \"But what about Keoni?\" I couldn't help but ask. \"He was a squish or,\" Lilo sighed, \"A platonic crush. I thought he was cool and really wanted to be his friend.\" I leaned down and picked up the desk. I frowned at it, chewing over the information. I took a deep breath and looked up at her through my lashes. \"Okay. I am a complete asshole and I'm so sorry I forced you to come out.\" \"Yes, you are.\" Lilo crossed her arms. \"And it's gonna take a lot more than just an apology to fix this, Stitch.\" \"I-I know.\" I nodded. \"You should probably also know that I'm Asexual as well.\" Lilo stated, her eyes blazing with pride, \"And you're the only two who know.\" \"I'd never out you, I promise.\" I swore. \"Me either.\" Pleakley said. Lilo nodded. [|] My last two days of school were a lonely and strained ordeal. Lilo and I barely talked in or out of school. Nani had asked what happened but neither of us told her much. Just said we were tired. That wasn't exactly a lie. That weekend, we got sat down for a horror film day and it managed to melt some of the ice between me and Lilo. We started talking about what was next and what we could do to work through this strain on our relationship. And then we realized. [|] I took a step back. We exchanged slightly sad smiles. \"Be safe, okay Stitch?\" Lilo said. \"Ih, I'll try.\" My smile twisted mischievously. She rolled her eyes with a laugh. My smile got harder to hold, \"Promise not to get into any trouble or fights?\" Lilo huffed, \"I haven't gotten into a fight since third grade.\" \"Promise?\" \"Okay, I promise.\" I took a deep breath and nodded, glancing at the ship the Grand Councilwoman had sent. Lilo sighed, \"I'm going to miss you.\" \"I'll miss you too, but this isn't our last goodbye.\" I smiled gently. Lilo's lip wobbled and she bit it. She pulled me into a hug. I hugged her back, \"You're not losing me, I promise. We'll work this out. I'm gonna come home and visit.\" \"I know.\" We both stepped back from the hug. Lilo gave a small smile, \"Aloha, Stitch.\" \"Aloha, Lilo.\" ","Summary":" \"Stitch? Where'd you go?\" Lilo called from the living room. I didn't call back.

Wow, it's been forever since a new RtT story has been written, or an old one been updated. Yay, a new one! Disclaimer – I do not own Remember the Titans, not even on DVD. Wish I did. In Virginia, high school football's a way of life. It's bigger than Christmas Day, even. My Daddy coached in Alexandria. He worked so hard our mama left him, but my sister Sheryl stayed with Coach. He needed us on that field. Up until 1971 in Alexandria, there was no race mixin'. Then the school board forced us to integrate. The combined the white school and the black school into one, called T.C. Williams High School. That summer a black teenager was killed by a white store owner, and the city was on the verge of explodin'. Alexandria, Virginia has been my home since I could remember. For the longest time it was Daddy coachin' the Hammond High School boys while Mama took care of the house. I would help Mama when I could, but whenever I could get away with it, I was on the field with Daddy. When I was eight, Mama told me I was gonna have a little brother or sister. I remember Daddy laughing while reminding me of my exact words: \"But I already have enough brothers as it is! Why do I need another one before next season?\" Then, shortly after my baby sister Sheryl was born, Mama left. She always hated that daddy was always working with the boys, she said that it was his fault I was more a boy than a girl. She ran off with a white man from down the road, and was never heard from since. That was when I stopped calling him 'Daddy' and started calling him 'Coach'. While he worked with the boys on the football field, I took care of Sheryl and the house. It was a lot of responsibility to dump on a nine year old, but Coach was always there to help. Something Mama could never figure out: if you just ask for some help, you'll get it. Maybe not in the way you imagined, but you'll always get it. I couldn't remember a time that Sheryl and I didn't get along. When she was old enough to start crawling I would set her next to the boys as they were made to deathcrawl down the field, and I teased them when she made it to the end before they did. The boys took it well, despite being beaten by a toddler and laughed at by a kid. When Sheryl learned to talk, the first word out of her mouth was 'Coach,' the second 'Football,' and the third, Sissy.' I almost cried. I taught her everything I could about football, and coach taught her the rest. Sheryl was amazing at catching things on the field, but had an intensity that would push those boys to death if she was truly in charge. Football may have ruined our parents' marriage, but it saved our family. Football is what kept Coach from becoming a vegetable on my sister and I; football is what kept Sheryl and I close; football is what kept us all together and down to earth. Football probably saved our lives. I stood beside Coach watching the boys practice for the next season, smiling as Sheryl screamed on Coach's other side. \"What are they doing!\" she cried. \"If they keep running plays like that we'll lose every game!\" Coach and I shared a smile before he turned to my nine-year-old sister. \"Well I didn't think that was so bad.\" I laughed lightly and shook my head. \"You never do\" I teased lightly. After Herb Tyrell, Coach's assistant coach, blew the whistle again, Gerry Bertier, team captain and fellow senior, came up to Coach. \"That's good, Gerry, I can see you've been working\" he smiled at Gerry. Coach was always a real positive guy, unless the guys really messed up. Gerry, though he looked pleased at the compliment, still looked really bothered. \"Thanks a lot, coach. Umm, listen, with the schools integrating and all, some of the guys are worried about losing their starting positions\" Gerry explained, glancing between me and Coach. It was a well-known fact that Sheryl and I were authorities on football, and the boys really took Sheryl seriously…sometimes. But, I was twice Sheryl's age and Coach took my opinion in much more serious consideration. \"Well that's something that we're just gonna have to figure out, but you don't worry about that now. You just keep at it\" Coach assured him. Gerry finally smiled and nodded, heading back to practice. It was then that Alan came running down the steps, fully dressed, not wearing his uniform. Only a select few of the team had come today. \"Hey guys!\" he yelled. \"It's coming down! It's coming down at the store! They wanna burn that place down cause that colored kid got shot\" he informed everyone, stopping at the chain-link fence that surrounded the practice field. The boys all grumbled and started running, ignoring Coach yelling at them to stop. Coach started running after them, stopping briefly in front of me. \"Sandra, get Sheryl and yourself to the school\" he said, watching the boys. \"Yes Coach\" I said, grabbing Sheryl's hand and heading to his office. For once, she didn't complain. We were both silent with worry as we walked with Tyrell. We didn't make it all the way to Coach's office. Instead, we waited by the doors for the boys and coach to get back. After a while, they finally came walking in, and we all headed for his office. \"You boys are gonna cool off, come to my office, and help me finish packing my things\" Coach ordered, marching at the front. Sheryl and I flanked him, as usual. I glanced back at the boys, slightly worried. I knew how hot-headed they were. \"Gerry, son, your hearts in the right place but you ought to know better than to embarrass the coach like that\" Tyrell lectured him. \"Hell, why don't ya just kick them all off the team, I don't wanna play with any of those black animals\" Gerry snarked rudely as we went into Coach's office. I winced as I noticed the new assistant coach, a black man, standing in the office. Now, I have nothing against black people, and neither does Coach. It's never really been a big deal; they were just people. Sheryl, Coach, and I all looked alike: blond hair (though Sheryl's and mine were obviously longer and curlier), blue eyes, and white, freckled skin. This man was tall, had short black hair, and dark chocolate skin. He stood straight, and looked formidable. \"Whoa\" Tyrell tried to stop him. Gerry dismissed the coach's warning. \"What? I see him.\" We all stopped once we were inside. Tyrell crossed his arms and flared at the man. \"Who are you?\" \"I'm Herman Boone. I'm the new assistant coach\" he introduced himself cordially. I watched him carefully, interested. I was curious. \"Well, from the looks of things, I'd say we got about all the help we need around here\" Tyrell said snidely. Coach gave Sheryl and I meaningful looks and pushed us gently away. \"Why aren't you outside with all your little friends hollering?\" \"This was the tie that was arranged for me to meet with Coach Yoast\" he explained patiently, setting down the football he had been holding as Sheryl and I sat down near where the guys were all standing. I could hear the tension in his voice as he tried to remain polite as Tyrell blatantly insulted him. \"I never miss an appointment\" \"Well maybe, um, maybe you just better reschedule\" Tyrell insisted. I had no idea why he was being so rude, except that this man was black. I had thought better or Tyrell than that, but not all men can be Coach. \"Coach Boone, the school board made the decision to put you on my staff. I did not hire you\" Coach explained plainly. \"Well, I came up here to coach at G.W. I didn't ask the schools to re-district. I didn't ask to be assigned to your staff, so I guess were both in a situation we don't want to be in, but I can guarantee you this, coach: I come to win\" Coach Boone explained. \"Win?\" Tyrell mocked. \"Coach Yoast here has been nominated for the Virginia High School Hall of Fame. Fifteen winning seasons\" While I was really proud of Coach, Tyrell was going too far. They didn't need to mock this man or make him feel insignificant. I wish everyone could see past skin color. Why did it matter, really? Coach always said a man is a man, and our choices define us, not our appearance. But here was a man that decided to be a bigger person and take a position under a white man, while everyone was all white vs. color. \"Well, I've won a couple titles down in North Carolina\" Coach Boone said modestly, trying to appease Tyrell. \"That's double A ball\" Tyrell said with a cocky smile, looking around like Boone was an idiot, \"this here's Virginia, we play triple A.\" \"Well, what an opportunity for me\" Boone replied with a smile. \"To learn…from the best.\"[Chapter 2] A/N – Hey all! I'm so glad people like this story! I just wanted to ask you all to check out my poll! I have already decided who to pair my OC with, obviously, but I'm still curious. So...check it out, please! \"The school board has decided that Negro Herman Boone is gonna be the head coach at T.C.\" the representative from the school board said gruffly. When the car had driven up are drive way while we were all outside playing basketball, the news we would be receiving couldn't be imagined. It felt like the bright, sunny, warm day was mocking us. I didn't mind Boone, really, I didn't, but this was not fair. Coach had taken these boys through fifteen winning seasons. He had been doing this since I was in diapers! Sheryl agreed with me. She was clutching onto Coach tightly, crying, just furious. It's not fair, our daddy's head coach! This is gonna be his Hall of Fame year\" she cried. Coach had one hand on one of Sheryl's arms and another around my shoulders so that both Sheryl and I were both wrapped in his arms, as I was on Sheryl's other side. \"No one is trying to take away your daddy's future place in the Hall…\" the man tried to appease her, but we were both very hot-headed, Sheryl the more so. \"You can't just walk in here and take my daddy's job away!\" she screamed. I sighed and knelt down, wrapping my arms around the angry nine year old. \"Sheryl, will you come with me, please? Let Coach handle this. Come on, I've got some cookie dough with your name on it\" I tried to entice her. Sheryl scowled but her face softened slightly at the promise of cookie dough. She stomped ahead of me, only to turn around, heading for the representative. 'Sheryl!\" Coach and I both called in warning, but she still sent a quick kick to the back of the man's leg before stomping into the house. \"I'm sorry\" I quickly said, running after her. \"Sheryl\" I sighed, seeing her sitting on the floor in the kitchen, knees pulled up to her chest with her arms wrapped around them. \"I'm not sorry, and I'm not going to apologize\" she said before I could say anything. \"I wasn't going to make you, or say anything about it\" I told her gently, sitting down next to her. Sheryl rested her head on my shoulder. \"Why are they doing this?\" she said softly. It breaks my heart to hear such a loud-mouth, out-spoken little girl speak so quietly. It was almost unnatural. \"Because people are finally bowing to the pressure of seeing that it doesn't matter what you look like. But the people that make the decisions, like who's head coach, are going about it the wrong way because they don't really want equality and they don't understand. Have you ever seen how other people treat colored folks?\" I asked her. Sheryl nodded. \"I see people refuse to let colored's into stores and stuff. Call them names and be real cruel. But you and coach never do\" she explained. I wrapped my arm around her shoulders, fidgeting slightly to get more comfortable. \"Coach has always believed that it's your choices that define you, not your skin color. He passed that on to me. And now I wanna pass that on to you.\" My heart tightened slightly as I spoke my next words, \"Do you remember Mama? She hated colored folk. Thought everyone white was pure and anyone colored was dirty and soiled. I think that's a big part of what got her so set on leaving when you were little\" I told her. Sheryl looked at, her face very serious. \"I don't remember Mama. For as long as I can remember, you've always been my mama, Sandra. You're my mama, and Coach is my daddy\" I smiled, my throat tight, at her words. I mentally laughed slightly at how her words could be taken, but the thought was brief as my heart was touched by her words. \"Oh, babydoll, and you've always been my little girl\" I cried softly, my eyes watering, pulling her into a hug. Sheryl clutched me tightly. We both just clung to each other as if we were the only thing keeping the other from falling apart. Eventually, Sheryl finally pulled away. \"Now, what's this you said about cookie dough with my name on it?\" I stood up, being pulled by her, laughing. \"Alright, let's so look, shall we?\" And everything was okay. For now. Later that night, there was a knock at the door. Sheryl pulled open the door while I stayed sitting, sewing up a whole in one of her shirts. \"What do you want?\" I heard her nearly growl. Curious about who her ire was directed at, I stood, setting down my work, and walking over to stand behind her. It was Herman Boone. \"Is Coach Yoast here?\" he asked, shifting slight. I couldn't tell exactly how he felt, but I could tell he felt something about having a nine year old girl clearly mad at him. Before Sheryl could say something snarky about Coach trying to find a new job, I placed my hand on her shoulder. She turned into me, wrapping her arms around my hips. I saw Boone watch the action closely, and knew he was getting an idea of what my relationship with Sheryl was. \"One moment, Coach\" I said gently. \"Coach\" I called into the other room. \"Someone to see you\" Coach walked in and as soon as he saw Boone he had Sheryl and I in our rooms. I knew he would be talkin' with the coach in the office that we made out of the barn. Sheryl wouldn't talk to me, and I knew better than to try and appease her tonight. I knew as well as most that sometimes you just had to be angry. I left her alone for the night, only checking on her once when I was sure she was asleep. She was curled up on her side, fists balled up, one tight to her chest, the other under her head. I smiled and grabbed the blanket to cover her up, as it was a slightly chilly night. I waited in the front room for coach to come back inside. Coach came in, steamin' a little, but I could see the gears in his mind whirlin'. \"He wants to me stay on the staff as Assistant Head Coach\" he told me without me having to say a word. \"Daddy\" he looked at me very seriously, as I hadn't called him that in a long time. \"You don't have to do it, but I want you to think on something. You have been coach in this town for fifteen years. In those fifteen years, every single boy that's played for you has been a white, All-American, average teenage Joe. \"Now, I know that with the integration, you'd be as fair as you can be, but you'd still be biased. With all this change, something had to change with it up top. The top of a pyramid is only as strong as its base. \"Also, those Hammond boys will follow you anywhere. Fifteen years, they've heard since they can walk and talk that you're the coach that gets them places. They are as racist as it can get in this town. Now I know it'll be demeaning at first, and you feel unfairly treated, but think about it. Please? \"At least he tried to make amends. You gotta imagine what it must be like for him. I've been by the Berg. Now that they feel they finally have something, you really think they'll allow him to back down?\" Coach looked at me, as if seeing me for the first time. I could imagine what he was seeing: my blond hair in a high ponytail, blue eyes sparkling from the constant tears, hands wrinkled from dishes and calloused from constantly poking myself with needs and sports. My shirt was rumpled and my jeans were dirty, my feet bare and as calloused as my hands. \"Sandra, when did you become a young woman?\" he whispered, still staring at me. \"Sheryl called me mama today\" I replied quietly. He looked at me in shock. \"She said for as long as she could remember, I'm the only mama she's ever known. I can't let her down, coach. I just can't\" it took me a moment to realize I was crying again. Coach wrapped me up in his arms, making soft 'shh'ing sounds. It'll be all right, Sandra. You'll see. It'll be all right\" There was a booster meeting at Hal's the next day. Coach was gonna announce his decision 'officially.' \"It's been a rare privilege to have lived here as long as I have, coaching your boys. I'll be taking the year off\" Coach paused, allowing the boys to a moment to cry out their denial before continuing, \"after which I'll be moving to Lowden, taking the head coaching job at Lowden High\" The crowd was clearly upset, several individuals crying out, Alan's father the worst. \"I say boycott T.C. Williams!\" he cried. Gerry stood. \"Coach, he stole your job. I'm not playing for him. I've started a petition and I'm sitting this season out\" he explained. \"The only place you're gonna sit is right back in that chair, Gerry\" Coach ordered firmly, walking towards the captain. \"I appreciate it, thought\" \"Boycott T.C.\" Mr. Bosley cried. \"Boycott the school!\" Coach stood toe-to-toe with Mr. Bosley. \"Stop this, Frank, you know these boys can't afford to go to some other district just to play ball. They sit this season out they put their futures on the line\" he said quietly but clearly. \"Coach?\" Ray stood as well. \"I ain't playing for no thief\" \"Don't do this\" Coach pleaded firmly; \"Don't make this any harder for me than it already is.\" Alan stood as well. \"Coach, if you go, I go\" he said simply, shrugging as if it was the way this went, and he couldn't do anything about it. \"I only play for you, Coach Yoast\" another boy cried as all the boys stood and started clapping. As the boys started chanting, Coach looked me in the eyes. I shrugged, silently telling him, what are you gonna do? I told you so. Sheryl and I silently walked over, sitting on either side of coach as he leant against the old tree in the field. \"We'll be alright, Coach\" Sheryl told him, sitting beside his legs as I sat next to him, curling up to him. Coach put his arm around me, bringing me closer, letting me rest my head against his shoulder. \"I've coached most of these boys since they were your age, I've seen them grow up in front of my eyes, almost like they were my own kids\" Coach remembered softly, reminding me of a young kid that was begging their parents for reassurance. \"Almost\" Sheryl and I repeated firmly at the same time, making Coach chuckled slightly before heaving a heavy sigh. \"This is a heck of a time to be abandoning them to look out for themselves, ain't it?\" Coach asked, more himself then us. \"So, what're you gonna do?\" Sheryl asked, sounding older than her years. Sheryl stayed with our next door neighbor as Coach called Tyrell. I called up the boys and told them to meet Coach at the school. \"Coach is sticking around. He's not gonna let you boys throw away your future, so don't make his efforts for nothing. Get yourselves to the school on time or I'll ma e you train harder than you ever have in your life.\" Instead of intruding with Coach and the boys, I entered the gym silently to see what kind of boys would be joining the team. I smiled as I saw an eager young man, probably a few years younger than me, going through the crowd crying \"black inside\" repeatedly. \"Yo Petey! How many yards you think you're gonna get this season, bro?\" another boy asked Petey. 'You know I ain't one to brag, big Blue, but I figure at least, uh, a thousand\" Petey boasted, causing all the boys to laugh and me to smile. \"Hey, didn't I tell you how no white boy would play with no brother?\" a much taller boy slurred. I nearly winced. If I got the chance, I would make that boy learn to enunciate , if it's the last thing I'll do. Before bringing these boys together, of course. \"Well who needs 'um? From now on the Titans is gonna be powered by soul power\" Blue cheered. I grinned. I had never been fond of the more 'white music', always favoring the music you could hear coming out of the Berg. Blue started singing, but before he could get too far, a whistle blew. Everyone turned to see Boone and Doc walking in. I had yet to be noticed so far. The boys all lined up and stood respectfully, but Bone went straight for Petey. \"Put your hand down\" he ordered. Petey slowly put his hand down, but his smile remained. \"You smiling\" \"Yes\" \"Yes, Sir\" Boone corrected. \"Yes, Sir\" \"Why are you smiling?\" Boone demanded. They had everyone's attention. \"Because I love football, football's…fun\" Petey explained slowly as if talking to a mentally retarded person. \"Fun, Sir\" \"Fun, Sir\" Petey echoed. \"It's fun?\" \"Yes\" \"You sure?\" \"I think…\" Petey's smile dropped. \"Now you thinkin'. First you smile, then you think. You think football is still fun?\" \"Uh, yes\" Petey's smile flashed before dropping again as he tried to find the right answer to please Boone. \"Sir\" \"Yes, no, sir, sir\" \"No?\" \"Uh, it was fun.\" \"Not anymore, though, is it?\" Boone asked. \"No…\" \"No, it's not fun anymore, not even a little bit?\" \"Uh,\" Petey looked indecisive for a moment. \"Make up your mind\" Boone ordered. \"No\" \"Think! Since you're thinking now, go on, think! Is it fun?\" \"No, Sir\" \"Absolutely not?\" \"Zero fun sir\" Boone finally turned away from the boy to walk down the line. \"All right. Listen up! I'm Coach Boone. I'm gonna tell you all about how much,\" pointed look at Petey, \" fun you're gonna have this season. \"We leave for camp – Gettysburg College – August 15th, 7:29am. If you report at 7:30, you will not be playing football this season, you will be watching. You will wear a jacket, shirt, and tie. If you don't have one, buy one. Can't afford one, then borrow one from your old man. If you don't have an old man then find a drunk, trade him for his. 'Cause I can guarantee you there isn't a bum on the street that looks as raggedy and ridiculous as what I'm looking at right now.\" I felt that Boone's words were harsh, but I couldn't help but smile, holding back my laughter, at his speech. \"This is no democracy. This is a dictatorship. I am the law. If you survive camp, you will be on the team. If you survive. Check 'um in, Coach.\" Doc replied, \"Check 'em in! I'm Coach Hines, you offensive line coach. Yell out your names and positions starting from the right\" he directed. \"Petey Jones. Running back, THE running back, ya'll\" Petey yelled, making the guys laugh. \"Jerry Harris. Quarterback\" The guys all cheered and called out \"Rev!\" as he spoke. He was clean cut, and looked really friendly. And cute. Hey, I'm a teenage girl, I can be attracted to other guys, though people in this town would think I was the devil's spawn for being attracted to a colored boy. Still, he was handsome. \"Rev?\" Hines asked as he heard the name. \"Nickname\" Rev clarified. Just then, a large white boy, about twice the size of me, came running in, stopping next to Rev. \"And who in the name of Heaven might you be?\" Hines asked the boy, but not entirely meanly. \"I'm Louie Lastik, offensive lineman. Naval Family, just moved here from Bayonne, someone said football, so I come runnin'. What's goin' on everybody?\" he said cheerfully. He clearly didn't discriminate race. There was an awkward silence as the boys were hesitant to accept Louie. It was then I was finally discovered. \"What the heck are you doin' here, young lady?\" Boone voice boomed throughout the gym. Everyone turned their attention to me. I walked towards the crowd of boys, slightly self-conscious of my simple red and black plaid skirt, white blouse, and black heels. I tend to dress formally when it comes to football. \"Who's she?\" one of the boys asked. I smiled kindly. \"I'm Sandra Yoast. As for my reason for being here, Coach, I'm checking out the team. The rest should be here in three, two, one…\" as my last word trailed off, the doors opened. Coach walked in, Tyrell and all the Hammond players behind him. As I noticed the hostile looks being exchanged, my shoulders slumped. There goes me thinkin' everything would work out fine. But then I looked at Rev, who seemed to be watching me curiously. I smiled, and he grinned back. Maybe there was hope, after all.[Chapter 3] A/N – How you likin' it so far? I'm not entirely sure if I like it or not, sometimes I feel like I go too canon and don't involve enough scene that aren't in the movie, but I'm not that creative, usually. What do you think? Am I doin' alright? I stood with Sheryl, Coach, and Tyrell ass the boys loaded themselves onto the bus. Our things were already on. \"Good morning, good morning, good morning, Coaches, Miss. Yoast, how are you?\" he sounded friendly. He was dressed in a suit, carrying a suitcase and some folders. It was nice that he actually acknowledged me. \"I just wanted to let you know what the offense is doing\" Boone explained, handing the two the folders that were in his hand. \"Awful skinny playbook, ain't it?\" Tyrell asked, looking at it. Boone glared at him slightly. \"I play six plays, quick beaters, like Novocain, just give it time, always works\" he said without a breath in between his words. I could hardly understand him. \"See you on the bus\" he then walked away. \"I'm gonna say 'hi' to some of the boys, Coach\" I told him. He nodded, allowing me to go off. I gave him a quick peck on the cheek and ran off, looking around for familiar faces. \"Louie!\" I cheered when I saw his large frame. \"Hey, I never did get to properly introduce myself\" I said as I came closer, noting that Rev was with Louie. I stopped in front of them. \"I'm Sandra Yoast, Coach Yoast's daughter, and usually I run the work-out drills. Not sure how Boone's gonna play it, now. You'll get to know my sister and I real well\" I told them, extending my hand. Louie shook my hand first. \"Louie, though I'm sure you heard\" he laughed. I turned to Rev, who looked surprised that I was willing to shake his hand. I wasn't surprised; most white people weren't. \"Jerry, right? Or do you prefer Rev?\" \"Rev\" he said slowly, shaking my hand, a smile appearing on his lips. \"Rev works just fine.\" \"So, you're the Quarterback. Looked pretty confident at the school. Think you're ready for camp? Think you can survive two weeks with Boone?\" I asked, teasing Rev slightly. He grinned. \"I can handle Boone. Could you?\" \"Oh, sweetie,\" I laughed, \"I'm much worse than Boone.\" It was then we heard Coach's booming voice, \"Ladies and gentlemen\" we turned to see Gerry and ray standing beside Boone. \"I got an announcement to make. We got Jerry Louis and Dean Martin going to camp with us this year. Jerry tells the jokes; Dean sings the songs and gets the girl. Let's give them a round of applause\" Boone was the only one clapping. He stepped up to the boys and started muttering to them, but they still had our attention. Finally, Gerry and Ray walked away. \"I have a feeling camp is going to be very interesting this year\" I said to the two boys next to me. They both nodded. Once everyone was on the bus, I stayed outside with Sheryl. She rides to camp with coach in his care, but it's tradition for me to ride on the bus with the boys. I sighed as I saw that all colored boys were on one bus, and all white boys on the other. I guess Boone wasn't pleased either, because he got on both busses and made the boys get off. \"Listen up, I don't care if you're black, green, blue, white, or orange, I want all of my defensive players on this side, all players going out for offense over here\" Boone shouted. The boys slowly shuffled themselves to the appropriate side. Coach was watching Boone with a contemplative look on his face. \"You and you; offensive bus, sit together. You and you; defensive bus, sit together. Get comfortable too, because the person I have you sitting next to is the same one you will be rooming with for the deration of this camp.\" The ride to camp was tense to say the least. \" Cause baby, there ain't no mountain high enough \" I turned around to see Blue singing and I had to smile. When Julius wouldn't smile, Blue turned to the guy in front of him, who sang along. \" Ain't no valley low enough…\" I would have joined them, but I felt it was too soon. Before anyone else had the chance, Julius interrupted. \"Blue. Shut up. I don't want to see your smilin' and stuff in' and hear all your minstrel show singing on this bus\" he turned to the other guy. \"You too\" \"Got that right\" Gerry added without looking away from the window. \"You can shut up too\" was all Julius said. I sighed and turned to Blue. \"I liked it. I've always loved that song\" I told him, feeling the need to say something . Blue looked surprised. \"You listen to Marvin Gaye?\" It wasn't the type of music white people usually listen to. I smiled and nodded. \"I've always loved that song in particular, but the guys don't like listenin' to me sing\" I told him. \"Well, hey, we could always use a good soprano\" Blue joked. I smiled before turning around, leaving Blue with a mysterious – if I say so myself – \"Maybe.\" The college was beautiful. Sheryl and I stayed beside Coach; we'd be rooming together and the coaches had the rooming assignments. Coach led us to our room and left us alone. I had brought a few books, not sure how involved I'd be in camp this year, and the rest of my suitcase was filled with clothes. I debated unpacking those for a moment before remembering the wrinkles being folding could give clothes. I had Sheryl unpacking and was helping her when I heard Alan cry \"Fight!\" \"Stay here\" I told Sheryl before running towards the screaming. There was a rather large group of boys gathered in Gerry and Julius' room, fighting. \"Stop!\" I cried, but they didn't hear me. \"Stop!\" I cried again, but again, I was ignored. I grabbed the nearest boy by the ear and pulled him away from the fight. He turned on me, and before either of us had a chance to react, I felt a solid fist hit my face. I cried and hit the floor. Silence. I heard running as one of the boys went to get the coaches. Then, I felt a gentle pair of arms slowly help me up. I looked up slightly to see Rev had his arms around me, holding me up. I was lucky my nose and mouth hadn't been hit. Whoever had hit me hit my cheek. It hurt, especially to smile, but there would be no lasting damage. I had taken enough hits to know that, at least. \"Are you okay, Sandra?\" Rev asked me softly. I could feel the gazes of the other guys, and the glares from most of the white boys at Rev's familiarity with me. But I knew that some of the guys, like Gerry and Alan, would be more worried about me than Rev. \"I – I'm okay\" I told him, but my voice was weak. As soon as I could, I pulled away, standing on my own. It was then that the coaches finally arrived. With one sweeping look, Boone glared at all of them and ordered them to follow him. \"Bunch of tough guys\" Boone paced in front of the guys, who were lined up, not allowed to straighten themselves out after the fight until after Boone had his say. \"You look like a bunch of fifth grade sissies after a cat fight, no offense Miss. Yoast.\" I smile slightly, making sure I was turned away so neither coach would see my face. Boone stopped in front of Julius. \"You got anger, that's good, you're gonna need it, son. You got aggression, that's even better, you're gonna need that too, but any little two year old child can through a fit. Football is about controlling that anger. Harnessing that aggression into a team effort to achieve perfection. \"Some coaches, they cut a player of they think he's not up to snuff. When they think he's hurting the team. This is a public school program, I will never, ever, cut a player who comes out to play for me, but when you put that uniform on, that Titan uniform, you better come to work. \"We will be perfect in every aspect of the game. You drop a pass, you run a mile. You miss a blocking assignment, you run a mile. You fumble the football, and I will break my foot off in your John Brown hind parts. And then you will run a mile\" As Boon spoke his last statement I saw Tyrell uncross his arms and look at Boone, worried. \"Perfection!\" Boone yelled again before speaking his last order calmly. \"Let's go to work.\" \"Miss. Yoast\" as the boys were suiting up, Boone called my name. I turned around and gave him my full attention. \"Your father tells me you ran the workouts for him at Hammond. You work those boys hard?\" he asked me. I grinned. \"Till they dropped and then some, Coach\" I told him. He nodded, peering at me curiously. I realized he could see the nasty bruise from me getting punched during the fight. \"I think that a little thing like you must be really tough if you can take a punch like that and not say a word\" he told me. Before I could reply he added, \"You'll be continuing running the workouts for these boys, if you don't mind, Miss, Yoast\" I nodded. \"Yes, sir\" Guess I wouldn't be needing those books after all. \"Come on, move! My little sister can move faster that that! Gerry, get your John Brown hind parts moving, you know the drill! Get moving. If you can last the next five minutes, maybe you can get some water!\" Between Boone and I, these boys weren't getting a break. I can't imagine why anyone would put themselves through this, but I was enjoying making these boys work towards their potential. The only thing I couldn't agree with was how he treated Petey. Oh, he treated him the same as everyone else, but sometimes that wasn't the best idea. It seems Coach agreed with me. Not that I knew it, yet. Lunch was interesting. Sheryl usually sat with Coach while I sat with the boys. As I was looking around for a place to sit I saw Louie sitting with the colored boys. I smiled and moved to sit with them. \"What you doin', man?\" I heard Julius as Louie. \"Eatin' lunch\" Louie said as if he wasn't doing anything odd. I smiled. \"I see you eatin' lunch. Why you eatin' over here? Why don't you go over there, eat with your people?\" Julius asked. \"Man, I don't have any people. I'm with everybody, Julius\" Louie told him. \"I happen to agree. Mind if I sit?\" I interrupted, standing behind Rev. He looked at me over his shoulder and smiled, moving over so I could sit on his other side. \"What happened to your face?\" Julius asked when he saw the nasty bruise. I rolled my eyes. \"Your fight. Speaking of which, do any of you know who hit me?\" Blue looked a little sheepish. \"Blue?\" I asked. He wouldn't look at me. \"I ain't mad. I just think you should learn to use those fists for good, like, I don't know, beating the other team?\" the boys all laughed and Blue finally met my eyes, giving me a smile. \"You see, Julius, they're just light-skinned brothers…and sisters\" the guy sitting next to Julius said. \"Yeah, and I'm a dark-skinned cracker\" we all laughed at Julius' reply. \"They're just more blessed children in God's lovin' family\" Rev said, wrapping his arms around our shoulders. Blue started humming Amazing Grace, Petey joining in. This time, I couldn't help but join in. \" Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound, that saved a wretch like me... \" as I sang, Blue and Petey stopped, and all the boys looked at me with wide eyes. \"Didn't you say those white boys didn't like listenin' to you sing?\" Blue asked me, remembering what I had told him on the bus. I nodded. Petey looked shocked. \"Are they stupid, or just deaf? This girl's got the voice of an angel, don't ya think, Rev?\" I blushed as we looked at Rev, who nodded. I blushed even more. \"Lastik!\" Boone yelled, thankfully, drawing attention away from me. Louie stood, front and center. \"I want you to tell me something about one of your black teammates\" Boone said, standing in front of Louie. \"Sir, yes, sir\" Louie saluted. \"I'm rooming with Blue, sir, and I've noticed he wears those leopard-spotted underwear, bikini-style, sir!\" I choked on my food as everyone laughed at Blue's blushing face. Rev patted my back, \"Breathe, Sandra, breathe!\" I finally swallowed and laughed. \"Okay, maybe someone who's not your roommate\" Boone suggested. \"Sir, I eat lunch with Rev. That's Jerry Harris, sir. People call him Rev 'cause he's always praying and he won't abide a foul tongue, sir!\" Louie's voice grew louder as he spoke, easily portraying how highly he thought of Rev. \"And what is the Rev gonna do after high school?\" Boone asked. Louie finally spoke normally. \"I dunno. Go to college and all that, I guess.\" \"What about you, are you gonna go to college?\" Boone asked sincerely. I think Boone really respected Louie. \"Not me, coach, I ain't a braniac like Rev and Sandra\" I was startled when Louie mentioned my name, but simply smile when everyone looked at me. I even saw Boone shoot me a glance. \"Think you got a future in football?\" Boone asked Louie. \"Heck no! I just figured if I gotta be in school I might as well hit some people while I'm at it\" Louie told him. We all laughed, even Boone. \"Alright, I like that. A self-aware man, I like that\" Boone moved closer to Louie and lowered his voice so we wouldn't all overhear what he was saying, but I had a feeling it was the same thing Rev and I had been saying to Louie before when it comes to school. \"So, what kind of music does the Rev like?\" Boone asked, taking a step back. \"Oh, all three of us dog on the Temptations\" Louie told him, again including me. \" I know you wanna leave me !\" Louie started singing. Rev and I shared a smile before joining in. \" But I refuse to let you go! If I gotta pray, plead for you sympathy, I don't mind, cause you mean that much to me. Ain't too proud to beg… \" \"Okay, alright, stop beggin'\" Boone laughed. \"Anybody else? Miss Yoast?\" I stood. \"Tell me something about one of the black boys on the team\" Boone demanded, but gently. I looked around. \"Let's see, Louie already picked on Blue and Rev, so how about…Petey!\" Everyone laughed when Petey jumped, and I turned back to Boone. \"Petey Jones, sir, probably one of the biggest jokesters you will ever encounter, but is able to take a joke, and has a true heart of gold\" I said. \"Anyone else?\" Boone asked me. I arched my eyebrows. \"Coach, if you want me to talk about every boy I know on this team, we'll be here for a week, even if I only talk about one race\" I told him point-blank. \"Alright, alright, sit down. Anybody else?\" the laughing atmosphere suddenly died. \"No volunteers? Campbell?\" but Julius shook his head. \"Bertier?\" Gerry didn't even bother to shake his head, he just kept eating. \"Each one of you will spend time every day with a teammate of a different race. You will learn about him, and his family. His likes, his dislikes. You will report back to me until you meet every one of your teammates. Until that time we go to three-a-day practices. You continue to ignore each other, we go to four-a-day practices\" the boys all groaned. \"Now, is there any part of this you don't understand?\"[Chapter 4] A/N – This chapter is a little shorter, but it's the perfect place to end it. Don't worry, I'll update soon! The boys were tired from the three-a-days and the more tired they became, the worse their tempers became. Except Rev. There was something about that boy. He never lost his temper, never became frustrated. He remained calm and patient and…Rev. I was sitting on the bed next to Rev, who was lounged across, holding his little Bible, but we were both talking to Louie, who was pacing. \"Nobody from my family ever went to no college\" Louie cried, frustrated and lacking self-confidence. \"We'll tutor you Louie…\" Rev tried to calm him, but Louie was having none of it. \"I'm white trash! I ain't gonna get no C+ grades, I'm just down-home, no-good, never-going-to-no-college white trash, man! Alright?\" \"Louie\" we went silent. \"Louie, listen to me. You are brave, kind, and have the largest heart of any man I've ever known. Even if you struggle in school, you are not, never have been, and never will be, white trash. I don't ever want to hear you talk about yourself like that again, ya hear?\" I gave him a stern look. Louie sighed. \"Sandra, I don't know what I'm gonna do\" he said in a small voice. \"We'll take it one day at a time. Rev and I are only a phone call away. I can help you before school and after practice. Heck, I'm the coach's daughter, this isn't the first time a player hasn't been confident in school, Louie. Don't worry. We're here for you\" I told him, standing up and placing my hand on his arm. Louie wrapped his arms around me and gave me a hug, lifting me off the ground slightly for a moment. \"Thanks Sandra\" I smiled and hugged him back tightly. I sighed as I saw the boys fighting, again, at practice. Tension was high, and it felt like it was building up to somethin. What, I didn't know. If it was for better or for worse, I didn't know either. \"Something's gotta change, Coach. And soon, or these boys'll kill each other\" I told Boone quietly. He just nodded. \"Rules of cowards: Cowards won't block! Cowards won't tackle. Cowards won't go after fumbles!\" Boone lectures and the boys practiced. \"Coach we need a water break, we been out here all day!\" Blue begged. Boone didn't like that. \"What did you say?\" Blue must have known he screwed up, but he continued anyway. \"Said, we need a water break.\" \"A water break? Water is for cowards. Water makes you weak. Water is for washing blood off that uniform and you don't get no blood on my uniform, boy you must be outside your mind! We are going to do up-downs, until Blue is no longer tired, and thirsty\" Boone yelled. I felt like we stood by and watched the boys so up-downs for hours. \"Coach!\" Coach finally called for Boone. \"There's a fine line between tough and crazy and you're flirtin' with it\" Coach told him. Boone just grinned. Boone finally gave the double-whistle that signaled the boys were done. \"Alright, get some water\" Alan was on the ground, throwing up. I stood behind Sheryl as the boys ran over to get water. I was pleasantly surprised by how courteous the boys were being. The white boys always pushed and shoved to get at the water, but the colored boys all surrounded the table and waited patiently for Sheryl and I to hand them some water if they hadn't already grabbed one of the pre-filled cups. That is, until Ray grabbed Rev and yanked him back, growling \"Wait your turn, boy!\" Julius lunged for Ray, who was tackled by Gerry, and they all started fighting again. I was scared. Really scared. I was dressed formally, in my usual skirt and blouse, though I was wearing flats, and I couldn't do anything to stop the fight. I grabbed Sheryl and pulled her away, remembering clearly when she told me I was the only mother she'd known. I wasn't going to let my baby get hurt. The table was knocked over, the water soaking into the ground. Rev, who never really got involved in the fighting, stood in front of Sheryl and I, ready to protect us if he has to. I couldn't help but be touched. That boy really wasn't doing anything for my crush on him. The coaches finally got the fighting stopped. I took Sheryl up to our room to calm down and waited for Rev outside the locker room. When he finally came out, he stopped short when he saw me. \"Hey\" I said shyly. Rev smiled. \"Are you okay?\" he asked. \"How's Sheryl?\" it was sweet that he would be worried for my sister. \"We're both fine\" I told him. \"I just wanted to say 'thank you' for making sure the guys didn't get too close to us. So…\" I trailed off, kissing Rev gently on the cheek. He froze, in shock, I guess. \"Thank you, Jerry\" I said, using his first name. Without waiting for a reply, I headed back to my room, to make sure Sheryl really was okay, and that if I left with the boys, she'd be okay, because Boone had warned me we'd be up early in the morning, though I had a feeling he hadn't told the other coaches. It was 3am when a sound like a foghorn went off throughout the dorm, waking everyone up. After reassuring Sheryl that she didn't have to get up I pulled on a sweatshirt over my tanktop, still wearing my shorts, tied up my sneakers, and headed out. \"Let's go, let's go, let's go\" Boone called to the sleepy boys who were sluggishly making their way outside. \"Wake up gentlemen, it's late! It's 3am in the morning! Alright, listen up. You will follow Doc, Miss. Yoast, myself and the other coaches. We're gonna go for a little run through the woods\" Boone explained, wide awake. \"If you get lost along the way, don't bother coming back to camp. Just hitchhike your hind parts on home. Any questions?\" \"Coach, this is a high school football team, we're not in the marine's here\" Coach told Boone. Boone just looked at him for a moment, like he always does, and turned back to the team. \"Let's go\" We all started jogging through the woods. We ran for hours. The boys were stumbling and falling. But the time we finally reached where we were going, it was foggy, the sun was rising, and the boys were filthy. But it didn't matter, once they realized where they were. \"Does anyone know what this place is?\" Boone asked, his back to the team, looking out at the foggy graves in the barely-lit field. \"This is Gettysburg. This is where they fought the battle of Gettysburg. Fifty thousand men died right here on this field, fighting the same fight that we're still fighting among ourselves today. This green field right here, painted red, bubblin' with the blood of young boys. Smoke and hot lead pouring right through their bodies. \"Listen to their souls, men. 'I killed my brother with malice in my heart. Hatred destroyed my family'. You listen, and you take a lesson from the dead. If we don't come together right now on this hallowed ground, we too will be destroyed… just like they were. \"I don't care if you like each other of not, but you will respect each other. And maybe... I don't know, maybe… we'll learn to play this game like men.\" As soon as those boys hit the field, I knew that Boone's words had hit several of them hard, but nothing had changed yet. It was well into the night again. Cars surrounded the field, headlights supplying the only visibility. Even the busses. \"Alright. We'll be out here all night till we get this thing right. Let's go. On the ball, Rev\" Coach ordered, walking off the field again. Once the boys finished beating on each other again, everyone got a shock. \"What was that, Ray? Whatever it is, it ain't blockin'!\" Gerry yelled. \"Give me a break\" Ray grumbled, but Gerry was having none of it. \"You wanna break? I'll give you a break!\" Gerry yelled, shoving Ray. I missed part of what Gerry said as Tyrell rushed over to stop the fight. Coach and I stopped him. \"Let him handle it\" I told him. \"…for Rev once, just one time! I swear to God I'm gonna hit you so hard, by the time you come to, ooh boy, you're gonna need a new haircut! You understand me?\" Gerry knocked helmets with Ray, but Ray pushed him away. \"Let's play, fellas!\" Gerry shouted, walking away. \"Let's run it again\" Boone said, smiling at us. I smiled back. Finally. The boys ran it again, correctly this time. Boone blew the whistle as Julius tackled Petey. Petey got up and jerked away from Julius, pouting. \"You alright big Petey\" Julius slapped at Petey, jokingly. I swear, with the lack of sleep, these boys were high. \"You really snagged him, Campbell\" Gerry cheered. \"Love me a little contact Petey!\" Julius called after the younger boy. \"Left side!\" Gerry cheered, punching Julius' left shoulder. Everything froze for a moment. It looked like Julius was deliberating before, finally, he hit Gerry's let shoulder in return. \"Strong side\" \"Left side\" \"Strong side\" \"Left side\" \"Strong side\" \"Left side\" \"Strong side\" \"Left side\" \"Strong side!\" And then they both yelled, basically doing the football-gear version of hugging each other. Almost everyone was smiling. Finally the team had come together. But, as I looked around at the boys, I couldn't help but notice one guy was not smiling. I sighed as I watched Ray scowl. This was not going to end well.[Chapter 5] A/N – Okay, so I'm gonna do something a little different in this chapter. Tell me what you think! The next day the boys were all ready to go, finally acting as brothers, when we got one more surprise. A small red car pulled up. Coach, Boone, and I walked away to meet Colonel Bass and his son. When the boy stepped out of the car, I was a little shocked to see his shoulder-length blond hair. It didn't quite look right on his head, but I wasn't one to judge. But Gerry, on the other hand, was. \"Hey fellas!\" Gerry jeered, \"Look at that fruitcake!\" \"Gerry, shut your mouth and get back on that field or I'll make you run till your feet fall off and then I'll hand you over to Boone!\" I yelled back at him. He followed the other guys onto the field. \"Coach Boone, I'm Colonel Bass. We just got transferred here from Huntington Beach, California. This is my son, Ronnie, he's a quarterback\" Col. Bass introduced, shaking Boone's hand. It was nice to see another man not swayed by race. \"How you doin' Ronnie?\" Boone shook his hand as well. \"Coach Yoast.\" He shook Coach's hand as well before turning to me as Coach shook Ronnie's hand. \"Sandra Yoast, I basically keep the boys in shape, running the warm-ups and such\" I explained, shaking his hand. He smiled and nodded to me. \"We're pretty set at the, uh, quarterback Colonel\" Boone said, \"But if the boy's any good, you might want to check out Wilson or Annandale.\" \"Well, I met Coach Taber\" the colonel explained as Ronnie walked away. I saw him pick up a football from the bag. \"He won't let blacks play on his team. The way I see it, if these boys can fight a war together, they can play football together. Now, he's a pretty good runner...\" Ronnie threw the football, a perfect spiral, and it hit Gerry right between the shoulder blades. I gave a long, low whistle. \"I think we could find a place for your boy\" Coach told him as both stared at Ronnie in awe for a moment, before looking at the colonel again. \"Under one or two conditions\" I grinned. Things were going to get interesting. 3 rd POV (I had too!) Ronnie was running his hand through his short hair, though it was still longer than the other guys on the team. He had to admit, though, that Sandra was handy with a pair of scissors. Petey came up behind the new guy. \"Hey, Sunshine! Sunshine\" Petey started singing, trying to get Ronnie's attention, \"Hey now, all that rubbin' ain't gonna make them golden locks grow back no faster, now, you know that, right?\" Petey teased as Blue and the boys picked up Ronnie's new nickname. Petey continued to sing 'Sunshine.' Ronnie turned with an indulgent smile. \"Sunshine\" he said. \"That's cool\" he said easily, \"I can dig it\" he held up his hand for Petey to take. \"Come on; don't leave me hanging, bro. Come on\" Petey finally took Sunshine's hand and shook it. \"Hey, I liked him better with the long hair, bro. Remind me of Bertier's mama\" Gerry, who wasn't used to mama jokes, started getting mad as the other guys cheered. Julius, who understood what Blue was doing, held Gerry back so he could figure it out. \"How do you know what Bertier's mama looks like?\" one of the other guys asked Blue. Blue grinned. \"Brother, don't you know? Me and Bertier's mama went out into town last night!\" the guys all laughed. Gerry almost lunged for Blue, still not quite getting it. \"Now listen, Blue, why you talkin' bout Bertier's mama like that? See, now you makin' me angry, man, look like I won't be able to take your mama to prom\" Julius said, his tone completely serious till he started laughing. Gerry smiled slowly as he finally understood the jokes. \"What you laughin' at Gerry, bud? You need to tell your mama to shave those legs of hers, bro. And Julius, she's done, maybe your mama can barrow the razor and shave those nasty back hairs\" Blue joked. Julius playfully lunged at him. \"Hey, hey, Lastik man what happened to you?\" Petey asked as Louie walked over, holding his back like he was in pain when the guys settled down. Louie groaned. \"Man I just gave your momma a piggy-back ride and she weighs twice as much as I do!\" All the guys started laughing. \"That ain't funny\" Petey said, trying not to laugh. \"That's a mama joke\" Gerry laughed. As they settled again, Blue turned up the radio above his, for lack of a better word, cubby. 'Ain't No Mountain High Enough' was playing. \"Man, what a time for Sandra not to be here. I'd love to hear her sing this\" Blue said. \"Voice of an angel\" Rev reminded them all. \" Listen, baby \" Blue sang along to the male part. \" Ain't no mountain high, and no valley low, ain't no river wide enough, baby. \" Louie took over as the female part came on. \" If you need me call me, no matter where you are, no matter how far \" \" No no! \" \" Just call my name, I'll be there in a hurry, you don't have to worry, cause baby there… \" Suddenly they were all singing together. \" Ain't no mountain high enough, ain't no valley low enough. \" \"Hey, Julius\" Gerry said as they guys sang, thinking Julius was still beside him, \"I was thinking we could... \" \"He's taking a shower\" Sunshine interrupted him, leaning against the metal. \"What do you want, man?\" Gerry asked flatly, not really liking Sunshine yet. Sunshine looked him up and down. \"You know what I want.\" Then, Sunshine lunged for Gerry, lips crashing onto the unwilling captains. Gerry pushed him off and then took a swing at him. Sunshine dodged. Again. Dodge. Again, Sunshine used Gerry's momentum against him, pushing him into the water table, which collapsed, sending Gerry to the floor. \"Get off me! You have no idea who you're messing with\" Gerry growled at Sunshine, who was just standing there as if nothing happened. \"Alright, what is going on here?\" Julius asked, finally letting Gerry go. Gerry hesitated before finally telling them, \"He kissed me, man.\" Julius couldn't tell if he wanted to laugh or take a swing at Sunshine too. \"I wish Sandra could've seen that\" was all he said. On the other side of the room, Alan was standing with Blue, Petey, Rev, and Louie, singing along with the radio again. When the song finally finished, Alan turned to Rev. \"Hey, man, what's up with you and Sandy?\" \"Sandy?\" Rev asked, never having heard the name before. \"Sandra. When we were younger we used to call her Sandy, before we could pronounce her name right\" Alan explained. \"Anyway, I see the way you look at her, man\" Rev looked a little red in the face as the other guys turned to him. \"She's just…look, the first day I saw her, I thought she was an angel. She's beautiful, inside and out, she knows her football, she doesn't care about race, and she has an amazing voice to boot\" Rev told them, knowing they wouldn't let it go. \"Aw, Rev has a crush on the Coach's daughter\" Petey cooed. \"Hey, man, I think she likes you too\" Alan told him. Rev looked up, hopefully. \"I mean, she's never been too into the guys on the team, even though plenty of them have had a crush on her at one time or another. But, you know, since her mama left, she's had to take care of the house, us boys, and raise Sheryl on her own. \"Not once has she ever looked at another guy, not seriously. But you? It's like she can't take her eyes off you\" Alan told him. Rev couldn't help but think of the song that they had just listened to. It didn't matter how high, how low, or how far he had to go for her, he really like Sandra Yoast. And he wasn't going to let her go if he could help it. Back to Sandra's POV \"Ronnie Bass\" Boone called one day during practice. \"Yes, sir?\" \"I like that haircut, get in there and show me what you got\" the boys set up again. I smiled as I saw Boone talking to Sunshine rationally instead of yelling at him, then I grinned as he called for Rev to show Sunshine what to do. I was spending more and more time with Rev, when they weren't practicing, and it felt like he was seeking me out too. There was something about that boy that had my catching my breath every time he looked at me. He was strong and steady and honest and true. \"Hi Petey\" Rev greeted with a smile as Petey slid in on his other side. Rev continued to bump shoulders with me constantly, and Sunshine, whom I was sitting across from, kept smiling. I didn't bother asking. \"Hey, Sunshine\" Petey sounded like he was gonna ask something. I had a feeling he would, he is rooming with Sunshine. Rev and Louie had told me about what happened after practice that day. \"It's not like I care or nothin', but, being your roommate and all, uh, You's was just messin' with Bertier, right? You're just messin' with my mind, right?\" Petey was practically begging while Sunshine just looked at him curiously, like he didn't understand. \"What are you talking about, Petey?\" Sunshine asked. I looked between the two curiously, wondering how serious Sunshine was. \"Look man, it don't matter to me, it don't, you know, if, if, I just gotta know.\" Petey just couldn't say it. \"If it don't matter, what's the big deal\" Sunshine asked. Now I knew he was messing with Petey, cause I could see the grin he was hiding. But Petey was too wound up to notice. Or it was just because he was a guy, and an oblivious one at that. \"I gotta know\" Petey said, eyes wide. \"Know what?\" Sunshine asked. Rev and I were holding back giggles. I accidently let a snort out and promptly hid my face in Rev's arm. He didn't seem to mind. \"You what I gotta know, don't mess with my mind!\" Petey yelled, standing and getting everyone's attention. \"That white coach has been keeping Petey out in the sun for too long, bro\" the guy next to Sunshine told him quietly. 3 rd POV Sheryl walked over to the coaches, ready to beat down her pride. \"Coach\" she said with a smile when she reached her daddy. \"Hey sweetie\" he said happily in a voice the other coaches hardly ever heard, and never on the field. He gave her a hug. He stood up and allowed Sheryl to say what she wanted. \"Coach Boone, you did a good job up here\" Tyrell's jaw dropped. \"You run a tough camp from what I can see. And you let my sister keep working the boys, which means you're smart.\" Boone looked at Yoast to see if she was serious, but he saw no sign of a joke in the other man's eyes. \"Well I'm very happy to have the approval of a five year old\" she said with an indulgent smile, thinking Sheryl would be just like his own little girl. Sheryl's smile dropped. \"I'm nine and a half. Same age Sandra was when she started taking care of me, thank you very much.\" Yoast knew how much Sheryl idolized Sandra, especially since Sandra told him about Sheryl calling her 'mama'. Sheryl was trying very hard to grow up now that she had reached the same age Sandra had when his wife had left, leaving Sandra to do all of the tasks she should have taken care of. \"Why don't you get this little girl some pretty dolls or something, coach?\" Boone asked Yoast. Yoast looked at him seriously. \"I tried. She loves football, just like her…her mama\" Yoast said, sharing a look with Sheryl. Tyrell nodded, knowing what he meant, but Boone and Doc looked confused. As Sheryl walked away and Toast sat back down, Boone asked, \"What did you mean, 'just like her mama'?\" \"Bill, you don't have to…\" Herb said quietly, knowing how hard a subject this was for the father. Yoast shook his head. \"He has a right to know. Everyone else already does\" Yoast turned to the other man. \"You already know I've been coaching for a long time. Well, when Sandra was old enough to understand football, she spent every spare moment she wasn't helping her mama 'round the house on the field with me drilling the boys, or watching film. When she was nine, shortly after Sheryl was born, my wife left\" Boone looked at Yoast sadly, but Bill didn't let him interrupt. \"Sandra took it the hardest. But, instead of shutting down and crying, she started cooking and cleaning and taking care of Sheryl. She got up at nearly the crack of dawn to cook breakfast and take care of Sheryl so I didn't wake up before I was supposed to. She set out all of our clothes for the day, made breakfast, made our lunches, and had all my football work ready for me before I had time to pour a cup of coffee. I did the best I could with Sheryl, but it was Sandra that really raised her\" Herb and Bill shared a smile. \"When Sheryl first started crawling, Sandra would make the boys deathcrawl. She told them they had to beat Sheryl across the field. Sheryl won every time\" Boone looked at them in surprise. \"Just after you were given the head coach's position, Sandra came up to me and told me something Sheryl had told her. She had said that, for as long as she could remember, Sandra had been her mama, just like I was her father. Sandra took that to heart, and took her role very seriously. Sheryl may not be a girlie girl, but she's not motherless as folk claim\" Boone looked as the small, blond teenage girl with respect. He had a similar story to hers, and he knew how it felt to have to leave your childhood behind. But at nine? At least she had her father. This integration had taught Boone some very valuable lessons, but none more valuable than the one he learned from the two Yoast girls: even when the world is falling apart around you, family and football are everything.[Chapter 6] A/N – What do you think of Sandra's past? Am I makin' her too perfect? I'm trying to portray that she's they kind of girl that pushes herself too hard when push comes to shove. Am I doin' all right? \"What are you?\" Boone asked as he walked among the boys did Pepperdine. \"Mobile, agile, hostile!\" the team chanted in unison. \"What is pain?\" \"French bread!\" I never understood some of this, but I smiled either way. \"What is fatigue?\" \"Army clothes!\" \"Will you ever quit?\" Boone asked, hand to his ear as if he could not hear them. \"No! We want some mo', we want some mo', we want some mo'!\" \"All in\" the boys stopped and got together in a huddle. \"Let me ask you something, Mr. Campbell\" I heard Gerry ask as some of the guys took their helmets off, surrounding Gerry and Julius. \"Uh huh?\" \"What kind of power you got?\" \"Ah, man, you know I got some Soul Power!\" Julius replied. \"What kind of power do you got?\" \"What kind of question is that? I got Soul Power!\" \"Yes you do\" \"Now let me ask you something Mr. Bertier\" \"Yes?\" \"How strong are you?\" \"I'm too strong\" Gerry replied. \"What?\" \"I'm too strong\" \"How strong?\" \"Too strong!\" \"I wanna victory!\" \"I wanna victory. Do you all want a victory?\" the guys all cheered loudly, nearly deafeningly. I was sitting next to Rev, who had his arm around my shoulders, as we all sang. \" Good-bye. Na, na, na, na. Hey, hey, hey, good-bye \" we all sang. \"Let me hear you!\" Petey shouted as we pulled up. Finally, we all loaded off the bus. \"Rev\" I stopped him before I could walk off. I pulled out a pen and grabbed his hand. \"Is this alright?\" I asked before actually writing, trying not to blush, but I think I failed. Rev grinned and nodded. I wrote my number down clearly on his hand. \"Call me sometime, alright?\" I asked shyly. Rev nodded and gave me a gentle hug. I wrapped my arms around him, not wanting to let go. Eventually, I pulled away. I better go find Coach and Sheryl\" I told him sadly. \"I'll see you later, don't worry Sandra\" Rev promised. I smiled and walked away. I found Sheryl and Coach heading over to Boone and His family. \"Hey Coach\" I greeted as I caught up with them, hugging Coach's arm briefly. \"Mrs. Boone, nice to meet you\" Coach shook the woman's hand. \"You too\" \"This is my eldest daughter, Sandra\" Coach introduced me. \"Hi\" I smiled as I shook the woman's hand. \"Why aren't you a beautiful young lady\" I blushed slightly at the compliment. \"This is little Karen\" Bone smiled, gesturing to the little girl in his arms before gesturing to the girl about Sheryl's age next to Mrs. Boone. \"This is Nikki. Nikki, that's Sheryl\" the girls glared at each other. \"Why do you dress so weird?\" Sheryl asked honestly curious. That didn't stop Coach and I from simultaneously flicking her. \"Ouch!\" \"Look who's talking\" Nikki sassed, getting flicked by her mother. I turned to coach Boone. \"May I, Coach?\" I asked, holding my hands out for the little girl. Boone shared a look with his wife, who smiled, before handing Karen to me. The little girl smiled at me, resting her head on my shoulder. \"Hi\" I cooed. \"You are just the most darling thing\" I turned to Mrs. Boone. \"She reminds me of Sheryl when she was a baby, but better tempered\" I told her, making everyone laugh but the two nine-year-olds. I didn't miss the looks some people were giving me at how comfortable I was holding the baby, especially a lot of the guys that didn't know me. I knew that Alan and Gerry knew my story, but the guys that didn't know looked at me curiously. I had been told, often, that I could pass for a young mother. What most people didn't know was that, in a way, I was a young mother. Sheryl has been my daughter since I was her age. \"Well, we're just all getting along, aren't we?\" Boone smiled. September 4th: the first day of school at T.C. Williams High School. There was a giant crowd of mothers, more than there could possibly be students, outside the school, screaming and protesting. I think the entire police department was out there trying to keep them at bay. I stood on the front steps trying to find familiar faces. Finally, I spotted Gerry and Emma. \"Gerry!\" I cried, running over, which was not easy considering I was wearing the same outfit I wore to the first football meeting, including the black heels. \"Sandra, how are you?\" Emma asked me, giving me a hug. \"A little shook up by all the protesters, but I'm alright\" I told her honestly. \"Hey man\" I turned around when I heard Julius. \"Hey\" Gerry greeted, shaking his hand. \"Hey Julius\" I smiled. He grabbed me in a giant hug, making me shriek playfully, laughing. Emma looked at me slightly disgusted as I pulled away from Julius. Julius became serious, looking around. \"Man, it's crazy out here, man\" he said, looking around at all the protesters. \"Yeah, well, what did you expect?\" Gerry asked him. We had both had an idea on what this would be like. \"I don't know, but I didn't quite expect it to be like this\" I looked around again, noting that all the mothers protesting were white. \"Sorry, Julius, this is Emma\" Gerry introduced. Julius held out his hand to shake, but Emma just looked at him in disgust, glared at Gerry, and walked away without speaking a word. \"Camp's over now, huh?\" Julius said, disappointed but not entirely surprised, I knew. \"Back to the real world, guys. This is what they're integrating us for? We're better off staying where we were\" I looked around sadly. At camp we had been so hopeful. But the whole world hadn't been at camp. And, despite how much I hoped otherwise, this just might tear those boys apart. The Titans were getting killed. Hayfield was killing them. Sheryl was pacing, screaming to herself. I let her be, knowing how she could get. I sat there, watching the game intently, but I was equally aware of where Sheryl was at all times. I watched as Coach pulled Alan off the field, replacing him with…Petey? \"He's pulling Alan out\" Mr. Bosley grumbled. He stood and started shouting. \"Yoast! Don't you take out my son!\" \"He's getting beat like he stole somethin', Mr. Bosley\" Sheryl told the older, larger man. \"You just stay out of it, girl\" Mr. Bosley snapped at her. That did it. \"You don't talk that way to my little girl, Bosley, or you'll be watching the game from outside the fence\" I growled. Mr. Bosley simply turned away from us, after giving me a weird look, and started screaming at Coach again. But Coach made the right call. While Alan kept getting beat, Petey tackled 23, no problem. And suddenly, we were winning. Titans won. Coach took Sheryl home, telling me I could go out with the guys. Instantly I went over to Rev, who was walking with Blue, Petey, Sunshine, Alan, Julius, Louie, and Gerry. \"The Titans are here, ya'll, and we ain't going nowhere\" Petey cried, holding the game ball. \"Yo, you gotta be loud all the time? Virginia can hear you, baby!\" Blue teased him. Sunshine put an arm around Petey. \"I think they all heard you fumble, man\" Petey moved Sunshine's arm off of him. I rolled my eyes as Petey rebutted, but I ignored him as I wrapped my arm around Rev's waist. His arm was already around my shoulders, holding me close. Rev and I were like this a lot, but I still didn't know if he meant it as a friendly gesture or something more. I was so used to the boys on the team chasing me around, but with Rev I didn't want to assume. We all stopped outside of Hal's, and I knew what was coming next. \"Come on, man\" Sunshine said, moving to go inside. Petey's smile dropped and he shook his head. \"No, man\" \"What, it's on me, man. We party on, let's go\" Sunshine insisted, no understanding. I never realized how naïve he was. \"Look here, man, this here's Virginia. They got problems, with, you know\" he and Blue gestured towards themselves. \"Ah, man, that's history, bro. Come on, it's on me\" Sunshine pushed Blue and Petey in front of him. I grabbed Rev's arm as he went to follow them. \"You know as well as I do how that's gonna end. Just…wait out here with me? Please?\" Rev looked at me and I saw the look on his face soften. He nodded, wrapping his other arm around me so he was hugging me. \"Everything's just so messed up\" I said, thinking of how Emma had treated Julius. I felt Rev's arms tighten around me. I didn't want him to let go. But he did, as Petey, Blue, and Sunshine came out. \"What'd I tell you, man?\" Petey grumbled. \"Petey, I didn't know, man\" Sunshine tried to apologize. \"I told you! What'd you mean, you didn't know? What, you think I was playing with you?\" Petey cried. \"Man, he didn't know\" Blue tried to defend Sunshine, but Petey was frantic. \"Blue, he didn't want to know!\" Petey turned to Sunshine, who looked real sorry. \"Now, you pull some crap like that you better back it up\" \"Let's go, man\" Blue begged. Petey was quiet a moment before saying, \"Let's go, Rev.\" My heart stopped for a moment when I thought Rev was going to leave me. But Rev looked between me and Petey before sighing. \"I gotta take Sandra home. I'll meet you guys later\" he said quietly. Petey didn't look happy, but he walked away with Blue. As Alan, Julius, and Gerry caught up, Julius left with the others. My heart broke as I saw how this city has torn apart my family already. I looked at the others. \"I think Rev and I need to take off\" I told them, pulling at Rev's arm. The others nodded sadly, our first victory tainted by tonight. \"I'm sorry, you could have gone with them if you wanted to. You didn't have to stick around\" I told him, feeling guilty. Rev shook his head. \"No, I wanted to spend a little more time with you. I'm just sorry that this is how tonight turned out\" he said sadly. I turned so Rev was looking in my eyes. \"While I am sad that my family is being torn apart, I will never be sorry to get to spend more time with you\" I told him, completely serious. I saw Rev smile slightly before turning away as we continued walking. I led him to the park, which was deserted by now for all the parties going on. We sat together by a tall tree near the entrance. \"How is it that there are people like you, Sunshine, and Louie, when the rest of the world hates us so much?\" Rev asked me as we sat. I sat between his legs, leaning against his chest so my head was nestled in the crook between his neck and shoulder. \"A black man saved my life when I was a little girl\" I told him, point-blank. I could tell he was a little shocked, but I just kept going. \"The road looked abandoned, and I was playing with a ball…I was only six. And suddenly, I was in the middle of the road when a pair of headlights hit me. I was frozen, and the driver was drunk, so he wasn't stopping. \"All of a sudden, I felt a pair of arms wrap around me, lifting me off the ground. As I as set down on the other side of the street, I looked up to see my savior. It was a colored man. At the time, I couldn't tell the difference, but as my mother came around the corner and shrieked, I soon learned that the color of skin mattered. \"But no matter what my mother said, I could not discriminate. Every time she tried to teach me that white was superior, I would think about the man that saved my life. I would wonder what happened to him.\" I felt Rev's arms sneak around my waist and squeeze me tightly. I turned my head slightly so I could see his face, though barely in the poor light. \"It was a few years later that mama had Sheryl, and then left. I was left to take care of a newborn infant, as well as the house. I was only nine years old. And I never had to worry about skin color, just my family and football\" We were both silent for a moment before Rev's voice broke the silence. \"You are a truly amazing girl, Sandra Yoast. And I am truly not surprised by the sheer number of people that love you\" he told me. I smiled sadly. \"The girls always make fun of me because I never had a beau, but I was always too busy taking care of Coach, Sheryl, and the boys. But now that Sheryl's nine, she's set on becoming an early adult, just like I had to, which means I'm even more focused on trying to keep her from giving up her childhood.\" \"The heart loves when it wants to be loved. I recon you just haven't been ready yet, nothing wrong with that\" Rev said softly into my ear. I shuddered softly when I felt his cool breathe on my skin, and I felt his arms tighten around me, probably thinking I'm cold. \"I…I think my heart's already been stolen, but I'm scared\" I told him, not looking at him anymore. \"I mean, with everything going on…a lot of people aren't gonna like us together, assuming he feels the same way. But I can't imagine it\" I kept my voice soft as a whisper, nearly terrified of his reaction, if he figured out who I was talking about. I felt one of his hands move from my waist to under my chin, lifting my face so I was looking in his eyes. \"My heart has been stolen as well. She's the most amazing girl I've ever met, but she's white and I'm black, and I was scared. She has the voice of an angel, a heart of gold, and knows football like nobody's business. And now I'm sitting here, alone with her, after our first Titan victory, wondering if she'll be my girl.\" He said softly, his eyes never looking away from mine. \"Do…do you mean it?\" I asked breathlessly. He nodded. \"People won't like it. A lot of your friends will probably turn their backs on you for going with a guy like me\" he told me, making sure I was sure of what I wanted. \"You mean kind, honest, courteous, and smart? If they can't look past the color of your skin, even for me, they weren't my friends in the first place\" I said, curling one arm around his neck, the other on his leg, propping me up as our faces moved closer together. We were a breath away when he asked, \"So…Sandra Yoast…will you be my girl?\" \"I wouldn't have it any other way\" His lips descended upon mine, a warm pressure as his arms held me tightly. He didn't move too quickly, and he didn't try anything, further proving how much of a gentleman he truly was. After a few more kisses, it was getting rather late, so he helped me up and led me back to his car to take me home. We held hands the entire way. We didn't say a word; none were needed. It didn't help that he kept rubbing the back of my hand with his thumb, making my mind blank. When I finally got home he didn't leave until the door was firmly shut, me inside. I leaned against the door, my heart pounding, a ridiculous smile on my face. \"Someone had a good night\" I looked up in surprise and saw Coach sitting at the kitchen table. He must have waited up for me. I blushed and nodded. \"Was that Rev's car I saw?\" I blushed deeper as he asked, and a knowing look appeared on his face. \"Aww, I see. Well, Rev's a good boy, that's for sure. It's about time. You shouldn't be spending so much time looking after you sister and me\" Coach told me fondly. \"But Coach, if I didn't look after you, who would? You sure wouldn't?\" I teased. He laughed. \"Alright, alright, enough picking on your old man. Go off to bed\" I gave him a hug and a kiss on the cheek before changing and climbing into bed. I fell asleep with Rev's face in my mind, and the feel of his lips on mine.[Chapter 7] A/N – Okay, so I missed a part of what Gerry said in a certain scene, but I think I got it right, If I didn't, please don't kill me! It was the second game of the season, T.C. vs. Herndon. The boys weren't working together like a team, and even though they won, I could tell that they didn't win in their hearts. Rev sat with me, his arm around me, as I curled into his side on the bus. We were getting a lot of dirty looks, even from the guys, but I refused to let their hate pull us apart like it did the Titans. They say that high school football is more important than anything in Alexandria, but if that were true, the people wouldn't be pulling our team apart. Football comes second in this town, and race comes first. And that's something that needs to change. The next morning, Sheryl and I were shooting hoops when Boone pulled up. \"How ya doin' coaches\" Boone greeted playfully as both he and Nikki climbed out of his car. \"Good morning\" Sheryl replied respectfully. \"Morning coach\" I smiled, nodding in return. \"Coach's in his office, you know where\" I told him. They only reason Boone would come over uninvited – and I don't mean that rudely – would be to see Coach. \"Thanks Sandra. Nikki, you alright?\" he asked. The little girl nodded, replying \"Yes Daddy\" politely. Boone headed over to Coach's office. \"Whatcha doin'?\" Nikki asked as Sheryl started dribbling again. \"Shootin' some hoops. Wanna play?\" I knew how hard it was for Sheryl to swallow her pride and ask, and I was really proud of her. I also knew how lonely she was, being the only tomboy in town her age. I was surprised she never resented me for it. \"I just did my nails\" Nikki replied, slightly rudely, showing us her pink nails. Sheryl sighed sadly. It was then I saw how truly lonely my little girl was. \"Hey Nikki, if you don't wanna play, would you mind keeping track of how many shots each of us makes while we play?\" I asked. Nikki slowly nodded, before taking a seat at the steps. Sheryl and I started playing, and soon, even though Nikki wasn't playing, we were all laughing and having fun. 3 rd POV (in the middle of the two coaches talking) \"I brought Nikki by, she was asking me about Sheryl\" Boone told Yoast. \"I'm getting ready to take her over to some other friend's house. Anytime you wanna bring her over to the house, we'd be more than happy to have her. I noticed Rev and Sandra, and I figure you might need a sitter sometime\" Boone saw the surprised by happy look on Yoast's face and decided to add, \"Heck, Sandra can come too, if she'd like. I'm sure she'd love a break from taking care of everyone else every now and then.\" They shared a knowing smile at the most alienated couple at T.C. Williams. Back to Sandra's POV I laughed as I walked by, seeing Petey talking to a pair of white girls about Sunshine, who I'd seen doing something he'd called 'Tai Chi' or something outside. I was happy to see that they weren't totally dismissing Petey 'cause he was black, just 'cause he was a flirt. And suddenly, like lighting, they were fighting. And it was black against whites until Gerry and Julius got involved. \"Petey, get the girls out of here!\" Julius ordered. Petey grabbed my arm to get me out of there, but I held my ground. I watched as Gerry and Julius separated the fighters, and were called traitors for it. But, even after it, they wouldn't say a word to each other. But, and I couldn't be sure, I think I felt them come to an understanding. Something had to change. After school, I stopped at Coach's office. \"Hey Coach\" I greeted. He smiled as he looked up. \"What can I do for you, sweetheart?\" he asked. \"Rev's takin' me out for dinner, and I was wondering if that's okay. I knew you were figurin' on leavin' Sheryl with the Boone's, so I thought it'd be okay\" I asked him. Coach nodded. \"That's fine by me. Herb and I are gonna eat at the Silver Skillet, so don't worry 'bout me. Have fun\" he told me. I blew a kiss and ran outside, meeting Rev at his car. Louie and Petey were there too. He instantly wrapped an arm around my shoulders. \"What'd he say?\" Rev asked me. I grinned. \"Sheryl's stayin' at the Boone's place, and he's eating with Tyrell, so it's all good\" I told him, giggling slightly. \"Man, girl, I ain't ever seen you this smiley\" Petey laughed at me. \"Well, I ain't ever had a guy to be smiley about before\" I blushed, but the grin refused to leave my face. \"How you doin', guys? I know things aren't the best, since we got back from camp\" I asked sincerely. \"Louie sighed. \"Man, we ain't a team anymore. Gerry and Julius won't talk anymore, it's like blacks against whites all over again\" he sighed, unhappily. \"Gerry didn't mean to stand Julius up, you know\" I told them. \"Has he said anything to you?\" Petey asked me. I shook my head. \"He doesn't need to, I know his mom. She's like mine, when it comes to race. She hates black people as much as she loved God. She told Gerry he wasn't allowed to go to the Berg. He was goin' to church with her\" I explained. \"Man, I don't think it matters anymore\" Louie sighed. Rev nodded. \"We need something big. Something that'll bring the guys back together\" \"We'll figure it out\" I said after a minute of silence. Rev and I left Petey and Louie, heading off to the park. Rev had made a picnic, and I had to admit, it was nice not having to cook for once. \"Hey, guys!\" I saw Petey running up to us as we were finishing our meal. \"Emergency meeting at the school\" Rev and I shared a look before packing up the stuff and heading for the gym. We met Louie and Blue out front. \"Listen, Rev, you were right. We need something big to bring us all back together, and I have an idea\" Louie started explaining. We waited in the gym for all the boys to arrive. \"Where's coach, man?\" one guy asked as he walked in with some of his friends. Some of the white guys already there glared. \"What he want with us now?\" \"Coaches ain't called this meeting tonight\" Blue told them. \"We did\" Louie added. The guys all started complaining and several started to leave, but Gerry and Julius stopped them. \"Hey, how ya'll gonna walk out on your teammate like that? He say he got something to say, you gonna listen\" Julius scolded. \"Turn around. Turn around\" Gerry yelled. The guys reluctantly did so. \"Coach Boone brought us this far, ya'll\" Blue said as the crowd quieted. \"But he ain't gonna be there for us forever, man\" \"So what, you won a few games?\" I started. Several of the guys looked surprised to see me, and a lot of the white guys glared, but I continued on. \"And ya'll think that's something? Any old fool can win a game! Those all-white teams win games all the time! That doesn't make them good, and it doesn't make us good either!\" \"We ain't nothing\" Blue told them. Several of the guys looked ashamed or thoughtful. \"Yeah, we came together in camp. Cool. But then we're right back here and the world tells us that they don't want us to be together\" He gestured towards me and Rev. We were holding hands, fingers locked. \"We fall apart like we ain't a damn bit of nothin', man! And ya'll think we done won something? Man, we ain't won nothin', ya'll. Nothing\" \"Rev\" Louie took over. \"What's that you and Sandra are always telling me when I get sick of trying to keep up with my grades and stuff?\" he started singing. \"'Even youths grow tired and weary.'\" The guys laughed, both races. \"'Even young men stumble and fall. But those who trust in the Lord will renew their strengths!'\" We were both laughing, though I noticed Ray was still glaring. \"Amen!\" Rev cheered. I smiled and we both high-fived Louie. \"That's what we're talking about, ya'll!\" I cried. \"Amen!\" Rev cried again, going to give Ray a high-five but stopping short, not even finishing his word. Without missing a beat he turned to his other side and high-fived Sunshine. \"Amen!\" \"'We'll soar on wings like eagles'\" Louie continued to sing. \"'Like eagles ya'll, like eagles ya'll'\" Rev and I sang in unison, me high, him low. I heard more than a couple impressed voices. \"'They will walk and not grow faint!'\" the guys started clapping. Rev, taking it in stride, started getting them to clap a certain rhythm, long ago letting go of my hand. I did the same thing to another group behind him, and soon, everyone was clapping. Gerry walked up, \"We play Groveton Friday night\" then, he screamed, \"You all gonna play like you ain't got no heart?\" \"No!\" the boys cried in return. \"Ya'll wanna victory?\" Julius yelled. \"Yeah!\" the team cheered. \"Ya'll wanna victory?\" Gerry screamed. \"Yeah!\" the guys cheered again. \"Turn in\" Julius and Gerry ordered at once, and all the guys huddled in. I was about to back off hen a felt several hands grab me and pull me forward, into the center with Julius and Gerry as we all cheered. When it was all over, and Rev and I were walking to his car, I asked, \"Do you mind stopping over at Boone's house? I wanna check on Sheryl.\" Rev nodded, but as we stopped, we saw a car peeling away from their house, a broken window, and Boone standing outside with a gun in his hands. I was out of the car and running towards him without a second thought. \"Sandra!\" Rev called after me, climbing out of his car. \"Sandra!\" \"Coach! Coach! What happened?\" Boone looked away, lowering the barrel of the gun as he turned to me. \"Some punks threw a brick through our window\" he explained to us, his voice rough. \"Are the girls okay?\" I asked, not only worried for Sheryl, but for Nikki, Karen, and Mrs. Boone as well. Boone nodded. \"May I…\" without having to finish my sentence, Boone stepped aside. I ran into his house, crying, \"Sheryl!\" \"Mama!\" Sheryl ran into my arms, terrified tears on her cheeks. Without thinkin' of what Sheryl just called me I knelt to the ground and wrapped my arms tightly around me. Rev came in behind me and knelt as well, wrapping both of us in his arms. \"Sheryl, are you okay?\" I asked. Sheryl buried her head into my neck and shoulder, and I could feel her nod. I looked at the others. \"Are you all alright?\" I asked them. \"Mrs. Boone nodded, holding Karen like I was holding Sheryl, her other arm wrapped tightly around Nikki. Boone came back in the house. \"Well, they're gone\" he sighed, putting the gun away. \"I am so sorry, coach\" I said, not being able to help but think about what else could have happened. Boone placed a warm, heavy hand on my shoulder. \"Hush, now. This is not your fault, and there was nothing you could have done. We're all safe and sound\" he comforted. Rev and I slowly stood, Sheryl still in my arms as she refused to let go. I heard the sound of a car outside, and looked out the window. Coach was pulling up right in front of Rev's car. \"What happened?\" Coach came jogging through the open door. \"A brick through the window. Don't worry, everyone's safe and unharmed, just a little shook up\" Boone assured him. Coach then noticed me. \"Sandra? Rev? What are you two doing here?\" \"I wanted to check on Sheryl\" I explained softly, still holding Sheryl. Coach nodded. \"Alright, well, I think we ought to get on home, then\" I could tell Coach was a little shook up. Boone nodded. \"I'll see you at school, coach\" he said, leading his family further inside. \"I think I should go with them\" I told Rev as we left the house. He chuckled slightly. \"I don't think she's planning on letting you go anytime soon\" he kissing me on the cheek, then kissed Sheryl's head. \"I'll see you tomorrow\" Rev got into his car and I sat in the passenger seat of Coach's, Sheryl in my lap since she wouldn't let go. \"We're okay, Coach. We're okay and we always will be\" I told him. Sheryl had fallen asleep in my arms, the crash from her adrenaline rush taking her straight to sleep. \"Herb Tyrell's left the team\" Coach told me sadly. I was slightly surprised. \"Is there a particular reason why, outside of the obvious?\" I asked him sadly. He shook his head. \"Said a time comes when a man has to pick sides. Called me a people pleaser. I told him to do what he had to do. He told me to go to…\" \"Coach!\" normally I would have let him finish, but Sheryl has enough of a temper without exposing her to curse words. Even if she was asleep, leave it to Sheryl to still learn it. I sighed. \"I had thought better of him. Still, we'll be alright. 'That darkest hour is just before the dawn' or something like that. It's like what you told me every time Sheryl got a fever. 'It's gotta get worse before it can get better'\" I tried to reassure him. \"Honestly, Sandra, I can't see how it could get much worse\"[Chapter 8] A/N – I need some opinions. Should I finish the year before doing the epilogue, or go straight to Gerry's funeral like in the movie? What do you think? Also, I want to thank LostGirl42311 for being a loyal reader and reviewer. I smile everytime I see your username. I waited with Sheryl, anxious for the boys to come out. I had been with them through every step of coming up with this scheme, and I was nervous as they were finally going to go through with it. But I couldn't help but smile as the boys came in, not running and shouting as usual, but singin' and dancin'. \"Hoo, ha, I feel, hoo, ha, feel good. Hoo, ha, I feel, hoo ha, feel good\" the boys chanted, dancing their way onto the field. \"Five, six, five, six, seven, eight\" Blue chanted as the boys lined up for warm-ups. Instead of their usual warm-ups, they danced, singing \"Everywhere we go, everywhere we go, people want to know, people want to know, who we are, who we are, so we tell them, so we tell them, we are the Titan, we are the Titans, high and mighty Titans, high and mighty Titans\" I had to laugh as I saw the looks on Groveton's faces as the boys performed. I had to admit, their performance was laughable too. But in a good way. But, as soon as the game started, it took a turn for the worst. As the play started, I watched as ray stepped back and let Rev get tackled. \"No!\" I screamed when Rev didn't get up. \"Rev! Jerry! Jerry!\" \"He'll be okay, sweetie\" Mrs. Boone assured me, placing a hand on my shoulder. Sheryl sat herself in my lap and hugged me, something she only ever did with me. \"He'll be okay, Mama. Promise, he'll be okay. Rev's tough\" Sheryl said, squeezing me. Ever since Sheryl had called me mama that night at the Boone's, she had taken to calling me it all the time. It was odd, at first, but Coach took it in stride, and so did the boys, so I did too. The crowd started 'boo-ing' and Boone walked onto the field, a sure sign that everything was not okay. \"Mrs. Boone, watch Sheryl, please?\" I asked, not taking my eyes off of Rev as I left Sheryl off my lap. \"Sure dear\" she promise gently. \"Sheryl, please, be good. I need to go\" she didn't say a word, but as I quickly glanced at her, I knew she understood. I nearly ran down the bleachers and onto the field. I knew I wasn't supposed to, but no one stopped me as I ran to Rev. \"Oh God, Rev!\" I cried, tears streaming down my face. He was crying too, but he grabbed my hands with his good one. \"I'll be fine, Sandra\" he assured me. We sat and watched as Boone put Ronnie in. I was confused when Louie was set up to block, but then let Kip Tyler, who'd just broken Rev's wrist, through. At least, I was until Tyler went to tackle Sunshine, and Sunshine ducked, making Tyler fall to the ground on his other side, hard. Everyone was stunned for a moment before Titan fans began to cheer. And we were winning. Sunshine was un-tacklable. It was easy to see the change, not just in the team, but in the town. Mrs. Bertier finally met Julius. People on the street, black and white, would stop the boys to congratulate them. People stopped giving me and Rev dirty looks. It was then Alan decided to make a video of the team. I laughed as I saw him walking around with his camcorder, recording the boys messing around. He even got shots of Sunshine teaching Blue Tai Chi and me and Rev hanging out outside. And of Sheryl scaring Petey. At a pep rally, the principal donated his car to get totaled. I was extremely surprised when, instead of Gerry taking the first hit with the sledgehammer, it was handed to me. Well, I gripped the hammer and slung it with all my might. It left a dent about the size of Louie's head. Then, the boys started really tearing into it. Louie even pulled off a door with his bare hands. I smiled as Rev hit the car as well, causing the whole crowd to cheer. The Titans kept winning, entering each and every stadium singin' and dancin', even cheering with the cheerleaders sometimes. Rev was still out, but he suited up for every game. It was near the end of the season that the Hall of Fame people met again. \"We are here tonight to honor men that are teaching our young people leadership on and off the field. And high moral standards as well. Ladies and gentlemen, let me introduce to you the 1971 Hall of Fame nominees!\" Two men stood at first, Coach and the other man. When the 'party' started, Sheryl was talking to the other adults like she was one of them, and most of these people had learned to take her seriously. It was our next game that had me worried. Not only was Taber a firm racist, the boys were ruthless. I hate to admit it, but I was slightly glad Rev was sitting out. There was no telling what would have gotten broken with these boys. It was the Regional Championship, and it seemed like all we were getting were bad calls. And it seemed, after a while, that Coach had had too much. In the middle of the game Coach walked onto the field and gave the ref a piece of his mind. Coach ripped into the boys and then, they were playing with all the heart in Alexandria. Gerry even called Taber out. We won. As the bus pulled up to the school, there was a crowd outside sheering, even the pep band was playing. The boys were hanging out of the windows. Rev was cheering with the boys, but stayed seated, keeping a hand firmly on my waist. I looked around the crowd and noticed Coach and Sheryl missing. I pecked Rev on the lips and said, \"I'm gonna find Coach and Sheryl.\" Rev nodded and let me go. I headed for the stadium, and saw them sitting together in the stands. \"I know how much it meant to you\" Coach was telling Sheryl as I sat beside him, one step down so I could see them both. \"I ain't gonna lie, I wanted the Hall of Fame real bad\" Sheryl told us, holding back tears. \"You know what? I wanted it to\" Coach admitted. \"But, there's always next year, or the year after that, as long as it takes for them to wise up\" \"It ain't worth the price, right now. But let's make something clear. Just cause he didn't make the Hall of Fame doesn't make him any less of one of the best coaches in Alexandria, right Sheryl?\" I asked, slinging an arm around Coach. \"Right\" she agreed readily. There was nothing more terrifying then when Coach came in and told us, \"Gerry's in the hospital.\" It seemed like no time had passed when we got to the waiting room. The entire football team was there, and his mom. \"How is he?\" I asked, going straight for Rev. He sat me in his lap and hugged me tight. \"He's paralyzed from the waist down\" he broke softly. We spent every spare moment in the hospital with Gerry. When we weren't at school or at practice, we were down in Gerry's room. Sometimes it was just sitting down doing homework, but we were together, and that's all that mattered. There wasn't a lot of seating, so Rev always had me sitting on his lap, which always made me blush. You knew Gerry was going to be okay because he was always the first person to tease us. Later in the week, Coach came in with Sheryl. \"Hey, Coach\" everyone greeted. Sheryl came up and gave both Rev and I a hug. I was so glad she like Rev and accepted him. It made my life a lot easier. Coach greeted the boys as Sheryl went over to Gerry, handing him an old action figure. \"This for me?\" he asked her gently. She nodded. \"I want you to be my eyes out there, alright? Since Sandra's too busy with Rev, if any of these guys slack of you let me know\" Sheryl laughed slightly and nodded. I think we all had grins on our faces. \"You bet I will\" Coach took her place beside Gerry. \"How you doin', Gerry?\" he asked. \"Alright coach. I was just talking with these guys about Marshal…\" \"You know what, we don't need to talk about football right now, Gerry, I think this is a good time for reflection and for prayer…\" Coach interrupted, but then Gerry interrupted him. \"Coach. I'm hurt. I ain't dead\" we all had to laugh at that, especially by how seriously he had said it. Gerry took 'football is life' to a whole new level. \"No you're not. No you're not\" \"You know, I've been reading up on the activities they got for people in wheelchairs and such\" Gerry said gravely. \"They got Olympics\" \"I can see it now\" I said with a fond smile, grabbing Gerry hand. 'Gerry Bertier, brother Titan, Olympic Gold Medalist\" The State Championship game was played at Roanoke Stadium, also known as Victory Stadium. But I knew, sitting there with Sheryl and the Boone's in the stands, that tonight, the Titans would be the ones with the victory. As Mrs. Bertier walked through the stands, every Titan stood and clapped their hands. As we stood, I waved my hand, bringing her over to us. Without hesitation, Mrs. Bertier sat next to Mrs. Boone, and didn't flinch as the black woman grabbed her hand; only smiled. \"Gerry. Gerry. Gerry\" everyone began to chant. And then, the boys came out, singin' and dancin' as usual. We were ready to take on Marshal. Only we didn't. Not at first. When the Shotgun came out to play, our boys were helpless, and Sheryl and I were almost ripping out our hair. At the first half I turned to Mrs. Boone. \"I know we're not supposed to, but Coach needs some sense knocked into him\" I told her, grabbing Sheryl's hand and heading down. She gave me a knowing smile. \"Sometimes those boys need a smart woman to give them a kick in the pants\" Sheryl and I ran after the boys. \"Coach! Coach!\" we cried. Coach stopped and turned to us. \"Girls. You need to get back to your seats\" he said. Sheryl and I wouldn't let him deter us. \"We can't, Coach\" Sheryl told him. \"Ed Henry's got Blue's number, and you ain't doin' nothing against that Shotgun\" I scolded. Sheryl placed her hands on Coach's shoulders and played parent. \"Look coach, now ain't the time to be proud\" we gave him a long look before Sheryl grabbed my hand and we headed back to the stands, ready for another half. I saw, as the half started, Alan give his spot to Petey, and I knew how far these boys had gotten from when they first arrived on that bus at camp. Petey didn't play games. And then, we were back with a vengeance. I smirked as I saw Ed Henry startin' to look mighty nervous. We had ten seconds left in the game, and I saw Rev go into the game. \"Come on Rev! That's my boy!\" I cheered as Sheryl covered her eyes. \"I can't watch, I can't watch\" she kept say. \"Sheryl, what's wrong?\" Nikki asked. I smiled at the girl. Despite their difference, the girls had become best friends. \"She's just freaking out because Coach made a very risky decision that, if it doesn't pan out, could cost us the game\" I told her. As they broke, Rev and Sunshine ran the field, Sunshine taking down every opponent that went at them, protecting Rev and the ball. They made it all the way to the end field. We won. I watched as Ed Henry ran over and shook hands with Boone, nothing but respect on his face, and I knew that Ed Henry had gained my respect for being a decent loser, and a fair man, not racist. Sheryl ran straight for Coach, while I made my way through the team. They all back away until I reach Rev, who lifted me off the ground and kissed me hard in front of everyone in that stadium. For a moment there was silence, and then everyone broke out into even louder cheers. Rev set me down and I turned to Sunshine. \"You kept him safe out there. Thank you\" I stood on my tip-toes and gave him a quick kiss on the cheek before Rev pulled me back into his side. \"Not a problem, Sandra. We're a family, after all\" Sunshine said with a grin. Suddenly, I was lifted into the air by the boys. They set me on their shoulders so I towered over everyone, completely visible to everyone in the stadium. \"Heart of gold, voice of an angel, and Goddess of Football!\" the boys all cheered. Everyone laughed, but they made no move to set me down. I stayed on their shoulders until they went off to the locker room to change. Instead of celebrating in town, the entire team, coaches, and us girls headed off to the hospital. The nurses let us in to see Gerry, no questions asked. It was a small town, and they knew why we were here. \"Hey Gerry\" I leaned in and kissed him on the cheek. \"Wish you could have been there\" I sat back as the other guys exchanged hugs, fist bumps, and high-fives. \"Gerry\" Boone walked in. \"By popular vote, the entire team, official and honorary, has decided to award you, Gerry Bertier, the State Championship Game Ball\" he handed Gerry the game ball. I sat with Rev, again, on the same chair we sat in every day since Gerry was admitted in the hospital. I loved being in Rev's arms; I felt safe, warm, and comforted. Like the fate of the world was no longer on my shoulders. We sat aside, still happy, but slightly apart from the celebrating team. \"Do you wanna get out of here?\" Rev whispered in my ear. Knowing that he didn't have anything inappropriate in mind, I nodded and caught Coach's eye. He nodded, and both Rev and I stood, clasping hands, and left quietly. We walked down to the park were we had first become a couple. It had special meaning to us. \"I can't believe we did it\" Rev said quietly, as if he was afraid to break the enchanting night by talking too loudly as we sat. \"I can. I always knew you boys could take on the world, and you did. I couldn't be more proud\" I told him, kissing him softly. I felt him smile against my lips. \"I'm just glad to have had you by my side this whole time. I don't know what I would have done without you. You mean the world to me\" he told me. I smiled. \"And you mean everything to me\" I replied, kissing him again. There were so very few nights like this, but now that the football season was officially over, thought the boys still had nationals and I doubt they would stop practicing, we could spend more time together. \"Sandra, I have something to tell you, and I'm kinda nervous how you'll take it\" Rev told me after a few moments of silence, where we simply enjoyed being in the other's presence. \"You can tell me anything, I hope you know that\" I said honestly, grabbing his hand and squeezing tightly. I made sure if was the hand that had remained unbroken, just in case, though I knew he was fine enough to play. \"I love you\" The words stilled me for a moment, but then my heart started pounding, I whirled around, and practically launched myself at Rev, kissing him hard. He fell back, and we both landed on the ground, but the kiss was never broken. Rev's had one hand one the small of my back and the other on my neck, holding me on top of him. Both of my hands rested on his shoulders. I have no idea how long we stayed like that, so wrapped up in each other, but neither did I care. It was just me and him and the night sky, and nothing could be more perfect. Slowly we pulled apart. \"I love you too; I just realized I never said it back\" I told him, blushing at my mistake. I was happy to see that Rev was breathing a little hard as well, as he grinned and assured me, \"Not a problem\" We both chuckled as we sat up. I looked up at the sky and realized how late it really was. \"I need to get home\" I told him sadly, slowly standing. Rev nodded and got up as well. \"Do you need a ride? My car is still at the school\" he offered. \"Thanks\" I smiled, wrapping my arms around myself as the wind blew, reminding me of the thin blouse I wore with my skirt. \"Cold?\" rev asked. Before I could reply he pulled off his varsity jacket and placing it on my shoulders. Instead of pushing my arms through the sleeves I just clutched at the zipper and leaned into Rev. We were silent, not needing words. Rev opened the car door for me, making me smile. Despite society, there were very few teenage boys that were such gentlemen, though nearly every single Titan football player could be called one, something I was extremely proud of. Rev turned on the radio quietly, so as not to bother the sleeping neighborhoods, as we drove to my place. We both sang along when we heard a familiar song, laughing at random moments, completely at peace. Gerry was going to be okay, race no longer mattered in the city, and the Titans had a perfect season. All was good.[Chapter 9] The Titans danced their way into history. 13-0, the perfect season. State Champions and first runner up for the national championship, second best high school team in the country. Gerry won a gold medal for the shot put in the wheelchair games. We coached him, Daddy and I. Ten years later, Gerry died, and that's what brought us here today. Gerry is gone, but his spirit lives on. People say it can't work; black and white. Well, here we make it work every day. We have our disagreements, of course. But before we reach for hate, always, always, we remember the Titans. As Sheryl placed the rose on Gerry's grave, Julius began to sing. \"Na, na, na, na. Na, na, na ,na. Hey, hey, hey. Good-bye\" then, we all began to sing. \"Na, na, na, na. Na, na, na, na. Hey, hey, hey. Good-bye\" and it was time to leave Gerry to the angel, taking him to Heaven, where he could run and play again. Herman Boone coached the Titans' football team for five more years. He is retired and is living in Alexandria. Bill Yoast assisted Herman Boone for four for years. He retired from coaching in 1990. Herman Boone and Bill Yoast became good friends, and they continue that friendship today. Gerry Bertier was a two-time all-American. He became a leader and an inspiration to the handicapped community in Virginia. He was killed in a car crash with a drunk driver in 1981. The gym at T.C. Williams was renamed after him. Big Julius was named to the 1971 all-American team. His football days over, he began a career working for the city of Alexandria. Julius and Bertier remained close friends until Gerry's death. Sheryl Yoast continued to help her father on the field. Ronnie 'Sunshine' Bass became the starting quarterback at University of South Carolina. He lives in Greenville, S.C. and works for ABC. Petey Jones remains in Alexandria and went to work for the Alexandria school system. He continues that work today. Jerry Harris, 'the Rev', retired from football after the '71 season. He attended Federal City College and currently works for the US Air. He and Sandra were married on the Titan footbll field. The whole team was there. Louie Lastik played four years of college football at Austin Peay State University. He graduated and is now a successful businessman in Tennessee. ","Summary":" A/N – I had a real hard time deciding who to pair her with, but I think I prefer Rev. Wow, it's bee"},{"Movie":"Remember the Titans","Title":"Remember Me","Author":"LovelyBullet","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7939162","Passage":"[Chapter 1] A.N. Hey everyone! So I'm on spring break right now, and I decided I should write a bit. I decided on a short Remember the Titans fanfic since it's one of my favorite movies even though I barely understand football. Now, I don't think it ever really mentions what grades all of the guys are in, but it does say Petey is a Junior, so for all intensive purposes, all of the guys will be in their Junior year unless said otherwise. Also, I'm mixing it up a bit and Sheryl and Nicky are going to be older, as in Freshmen, and little Karen is going to be somewhere in middle school. Hope you like it. \"WHAT ARE THEY DOING! If they keep playing like that we're gonna lose every game!\" I heard myself yell, more to express my frustration than anything else. \"Aw, I didn't think it was that bad.\" Coach tried to reason with me, but he didn't try too hard since we both knew it was useless. Coach and I went way back, he was my dad after all. He put everything he had into the game of football that it drove my mom to leave him, but I had no choice, I stayed with Coach. After all, he needed me, how else would he survive. \"And shouldn't you be home, I'm pretty sure all your summer work isn't finished for the start of the school year.\" I just rolled my eyes. Football triumphed over school work any day of the week. Alan came running down the stairs to the fence that separated the old train station from the grassy field my dad was coaching his returning Titans on. \"Guys! It's coming down at the store!\" That's all they needed to hear and the team was off, running full speed towards the store in question, Gary, the big brother I never had, in the lead. Coach ran off towards his truck, with the sole purpose of stopping them. I followed him and hopped in the bed as he was pulling away. Now, being raised by a man had its advantages. One of these advantages was not too much scared you. If I hadn't been raised solely by coach, the sight that greated me at the store would've had me sniveling in my place on the bed, but since that wasn't the case, I was able to take it all in. Blacks and whites segregated on separate sides of the entrance to the store, only being restrained by the police and their nightsticks. The owner of the store could be seen through the window, loading his shotgun, but he was stopped by another police officer; right before a crate crashed through the window. At that precise moment my daddy cut our boys off, just before they reached the ranks of rioters. Gary, Alan and Ray looked at my father with a look of loathing before jumping in the bed of the truck with me. I knew better than to talk to the guys when their testosterone levels were that high, after all, they were each easily twice my size. When we returned to Coach's office, there was a tall man standing behind his desk, clutching a football, dressed in a suit. He was black and here to coach, little did I know that he would be taking my daddy's spot. I didn't know of the treachery until the next afternoon, when some official looking man came to our house. He cut right to the chase, telling us that the school board was giving that Boone my daddy's job since \"every head coach in the system is white, we had to give him something.\" I just started yelling, I didn't know what else to do. I didn't know what I was saying, I just knew that I was angry, and this man was my scapegoat. I stomped off into the field, but not before kicking the man. I ran around kicking at some tall grass, but that didn't satisfy me. So I started walking. I knew the way well, I had walked it several times in my life, sometimes with my dad and sometimes without him. The point is, I knew the way to the little Pee Wee field well. This was my sanctuary. It represented a simpler time, when a girl could be a tomboy and not be accused of being unfeminine. When a girl could hang out with all the guys and not have her intentions questioned. I wasn't at the field long, snapping long passes to no one, before I head a familiar voice, \"Not bad curls, but it could be better.\" I turned around to see Ray. Ray and I grew up together, along with the rest of my daddy's boys. Ray was two years older than me, and while we grew up together, we never really had that brother sister relationship that I had with all the other guys. \"Let me show you how it's done.\" With that, he picked up a football and threw it. Far. Farther than I ever could. \"Psh. I've seen better.\" I said, not giving in to his obvious superiority. After all, he was twice my size so obviously he would through farther. \"Ignoring that... \" He said, rolling his eyes. \"Let me help you. Take your stance.\" I did. \"See that's your problem; standing like this will prevent you from using your full body weight to your advantage.\" He hesitated before speaking again. \"Try it like this.\" He came right up behind me. He slid my feet one at a time with his own. Placing his hands on my hips he rotated me slightly, then he reached around my body, covering my hands with his much larger ones, \"Try holding it like this.\" He moved my hands, \"And now we go like this.\" And with that he moved, pulling me with him. I don't know how it happened, maybe I moved to much or he didn't take my weight into account, but we ended up falling, him on top of me. But before I felt his weight on my back, I heard a grunt and to thuds near my head. Gotta love football reflexes. He had caught himself before hitting me. I flipped over onto my back so I was facing him. \"That didn't go as planned.\" He said quietly, giving me a smirk. \"Really? I never would've guessed!\" I giggled. \"Come on, time to get up.\" He stood, pulling me with him. \"We better get you back before coach finds out you're gone, after all, I'm guessing you didn't tell him.\" \"How did you know!\" We walked in silence back towards the old farmhouse Dad and I shared. It wasn't until we got to the door that he spoke again. \"So, are you ready for camp? Should be interesting this year. You might want to steer clear, things might get messy...\" \"You aren't getting rid of me that easily. Plus, it's my favorite time of year. I get to watch you guys get your asses handed to you.\" I giggled. \"Hardy har har.\" He joked. \"Now get inside, it's getting late, coach must be wondering where you are.\" \"I hadn't even noticed. See ya Ray!\" I watched him walk away, back the way we came. \"Oh, and curls. At camp, the first night. Meet me in the foyer in front of the dinning hall.\" He turned, calling back. \"If I have nothing better to do.\" I called back, before going inside.[Chapter 2] \"Herman!\" Mom called to dad after seeing the sight on our front lawn. He came inside from the back porch with Dr. Davis, \"Herman, I think you might want to look outside.\" Daddy eased the door open, allowing only enough space for him to see out before stepping out. The noise I had heard was not what I had expected. Cheers of approval rather than of hate. Clapping instead of hate. I looked out the front window and saw tens, maybe hundreds of black people, and many of young boys: football players. Words were exchanged and my mother and I watched as his supporters encircled our father. There was a knocking on the door. I set down the figurine I had been examining and opened the door. The man standing before me summoned all of the hatred Ray had helped me suppress back to me. \"What do you want?\" \"Is Coach Yoast here?\" He asked. \"We're busy. Interviewing for head coaching jobs. Gotten eleven offers and certainly no time for you .\" I started to close the door, smirking to myself. Then the door caught. First I looked down, making sure it wasn't my foot that had ruined my dramatic exit. It wasn't; it was the other pair of feet. I looked up, sending a glare at my father before storming away to my room. I tried ease dropping on them, but there was too great of a risk of getting caught, so I retreated into my room once more. I was seeing red. The world had a red tinge to it. My blue walls were purple and the white wood floor was red. I walked to me bed and reached for the phone Coach had just installed in my room. I dialed the number I knew by heart: Gary. Gary picked up on the second ring. \"Sheryl, I can't talk right now... Emma's here. Can it wait until morning?\" \"No.\" My voice cracking. The next morning, when the time had come for Coach to tell the boys, there was a tense feeling as we all crowded into Hal's Dinner. \"It's been a rare privilege,\" My dad started the speech he had been putting together all night, \"to have lived here as long as I have, coaching your boys. I'll be taking the year off,\" they boys and their families expressed their disapproval, but coach plowed through, \"After which, I'll be moving to Louden, and taking the head coaching job at Louden High.\" It was then that Alan's dad began to make noise. Yelling out that they had to boycott the school. He had quite a following too. Gary stood and expressed his frustration, telling the group that he had started a petition and would sit this season out, but my dad wouldn't allow it. Ray agreed with Gary, then Alan, and then the rest of the team. Dad couldn't desert these boys. We both knew it, he had helped raise some of, Gary for instance, after his father past, Coach took on the male role model position. And with the schools integrating, this was the year these boys would need the positive role model. \"So you did remember.\" The voice came from that shadows of the foyer. \"Of course I did.\" I said, looking for Ray. The boy emerged from the corner where he had been encased in darkness, \"So what are we doing?\" \"Come with me.\" He said, walking through the grand double doors that lead out into the courtyards. He led me past the boundaries of the school into the woods. \"Are we supposed to be out here?\" I asked, slowing my pace. \"They didn't say we weren't.\" Ray flashed me a smirk and grabbed my head, pulling me on. \"Ray... I think we should go back.\" I said five minutes later, when we were thoroughly encased in trees, \"Do you even know where we are going?\" \"Ya, we are really close too.\" Then he paused, \"Hear that?\" \"What am I supposed to hear?\" Then I heard it. Rushing water. A few steps ahead there was a clearing, in which there was a small waterfall, no taller than my waist. It was like a scene from a fairytale. Moonlight and the flowers, the stream and the grass. \"Was it worth it?\" He asked, taking a seat on the rocks, patting the seat beside me. \"Ya. But we should really get back.\" I said, backing away. \"No. We have time. Come sit.\" \"No. I'm going back.\" \"You don't know the way, you'll get lost.\" \"Too bad. I'll figure it out.\" And with that I walked off into the woods. I must have walked for a solid ten minutes, trying to follow the same path back when I heard something behind me. \"Ray?\" I turned and called, no answer. I started walking again, faster this time. I came to another clearing, I started to walk into it, but I was grabbed from behind. One arm was around my waist; the other had a hand clapped over my mouth. \"Don't panic. And don't make a sound.\" A voice whispered in my ear. Slowly, the body began to walk backwards, pulling me with it, back into the cover of the trees. This was how I was gonna die: Killed in the woods by some guy. \"Don't scream. I'm going to let go.\" And he let go. I spun around, throwing a punch where I knew his face was, but he grabbed my wrist. I recognized the face. He was one of the black players. My pulse slowed slightly. \"Sorry to sneak up on you like that, there was a bear on the edge of the clearing. It had its back to you, but if you walked in the clearing, I'm sure it would've seen you.\" He said, releasing my wrist. \"Who are you?\" I asked him, refusing to show weakness, truthfully, I was scared, was there really a bear? If there was, I would've been its midnight snack. \"I'm Julius Cambell,\" he stated, \"I'm rooming with your buddy superman.\" \"Oh. And you knew I was here because?\" \"I was in the bathroom, and when I came out, I saw you and that white kid leaving. Now he's one that I could honestly say, I'd hate regardless of his skin.\" \"Oh. Well, thanks, I guess.\" And then there were sounds of a stampede. We watched as Boone and the other coaches ran by, the team following behind them. \"Shit!\" Julius whispered. \"Think you can keep up, 'cause I can't miss this.\" \"Please, I'll be running with the coaches.\" And with that we joined the pack. \"So, Gary, I heard that you have an admirer.\" I giggled when Gary walked into his room, Julius trailing behind him. \"So you come in my room, no invitation, no sign, and sit on my bed. I mean really?\" Gary joked, coming to sit next to me. \"Dude, is this like, a regular occurrence?\" Julius asked, shrugging off his shirt. We both nodded. \"Well then, imma go take a shower. You kids have fun now.\" With that he left the room, towel in hand. \"Ya know, I'd appreciate it if you didn't openly gawk at my roommate, just letting you know.\" Gary told me, smirking. \"So what's up?\" \"Well, other than your man kiss, Ray and I kinda went on a date-ish thing...\" \"What?\" Gary asked incredulous. I quickly explained to him Ray's oasis, Julius's rescue and then the run with the team. \"Ray's a dead man. He should never have let you go out there alone, for obvious reason, your lucky Julius was there.\" \"We're lucky Julius was where?\" Julius asked, walking back into the room in his towel. \"She just told me about Ray.\" Gary said, looking up at his roommate, \"Thank you for saving her. She's like my little sister, I don't know what I'd do without her.\" \"Well, you don't have to worry about that now do you?\" Julius walked over to the corner of the room and made himself a makeshift changing stall with his closet door, \"Did you tell her the story about sunshine?\" \"Trust me, I already heard about that story.\" I lost it, and started giggling uncontrollably. \"Are all white girls that crazy?\" Julius asked once Cheryl had left. \"Nah. Cheryl's special.\" I responded. \"That's too bad.\" He was staring at the closed door the object of our conversation had just left though. \"Ya it is. She's like another one of our teammates, she's been around forever, hell, she was on our Pee Wee team.\" \"You serious?\" He asked, eyebrows raised, \"She was like two, three years younger than you guys though.\" \"She's good. And back then, she was bigger than a bunch of us...\" \"That's something I'd wanna see...\" \"Hey, Cheryl? Can I, um, can we talk?\" Ray asked me, matching my stride. \"You have a minute,\" I stopped, turning to face him, \"Go.\" \"Cheryl, I am so sorry, I can't express to you how much I mean that. I was so stressed out from all the practices and Coach Coon and all that stuff. I was just... ugh... I shouldn't have done what I did. And I am extremely sorry for that.\" \"I almost got eaten by a bear.\" I said, crossing my arms, \"You are lucky that Julius was there! If it wasn't for him I'd be dead. Now don't talk to me.\" And with that I walked on.[Chapter 3] A.N. Just letting you guys know, I would love some reviews! ;) Chaos. Chaos was what greeted me on my first day of high school. Not the regular first day of school, finding of classes and friends, but rioters boycotting bussing. Now I was a freshman, and a small freshman at that, so I was easily lost in the crowd of rebels. I pushed my way through until I finally broke the barrier and stumbled into the less crowded school courtyard, and right into a crowd of big black upperclassmen boys. \"Aw, look at this,\" One sneered. \"Little freshman wants to hang with the the big boys?\" \"Yo. Dyl, leave her alone.\" A voice came in the group. Julius. \"Have a crush on a little white girl, Cambell?\" One of the guys taunted. \"Nah,\" He shook his head grabbing hold of my arm, \"She's my coach's daughter and I think letting her get harassed may result in some extra laps.\" Without another word he started to cut his way through the crowd until we reached Gary and Emma. \"You look like you just saw a ghost, Cheryl.\" Gary said throwing an arm around me. \"Well, Bertier, she was kinda... intimidated... by some guys over there.\" Julius answered for me, \"I handled it though.\" After that Gary refused to let me out of his sight for the rest of the day, it got so extreme that when he had to use the restroom he made me wait outside with Julius. \"I hope you know those guys aren't always like that.\" Julius said, leaning against the wall beside me. \"They hate change almost as much as...\" he trailed off. \"The white guys. Its fine.\" I assured him. And silence again. What was taking Gary so long? \"So um, where do you and Ray stand?\" Julius asked, awkwardly ending the silence. \"We, uh, don't really stand anywhere...\" I responded. \"Oh. Cool.\" \"Ok. Class Time.\" Gary came out, pulling me off away from Julius. \"Well, that foot ball field out there is our universe. Let's rule it like Titans.\" Boone took a dramatic pause. \"Five minutes before we head out.\" The coaches moved over to a corner to discuss game strategy. \"Gary!\" I shouted running over to the man, jumping onto him, hugging him, \"You ready to win! I want you to go out there and kick some...\" \"Keep it PG!\" Gary laughed, hugging me to him, \"Now its time to get down, after all, aren't you supposed to be in the stands?\" \"Not before I said good luck!\" I jumped down. I went around to each of the guys, giving a couple hugs, a select few, Gary included, pecks on the cheek. When I got to Ray, things were awkward. I didn't know what to do, so we just sort of nodded to each other before I moved on to Julius. \"Hey.\" He said quietly. \"Good luck.\" I reached up on my tiptoes and wrapped my arms around his neck. I felt his arms go around my waist, holding me to his padding coated body. When I finally released him, I had just enough time to run up to my seat next to Alan's dad in the stands before the started. Much to Mr. Bosley's dismay, Alan was getting beat like he stole something, and the man nearly had a heart attack when his son was swapped out for Petey, one of the young black players. As soon as Petey came in, the tide turned and T.C. Williams began dominating. Petey shut down number twenty three. Gary took out a man, as did Julius. I couldn't believe that the same arms that had saved me from a bear could tackle a man like that. The game ended after Rev scored us a touchdown, effectively winning the game. I waited for the guys to come out of the locker rooms and then we set off to paint the town. Blue, Rev, Petey, Lois and Sunshine walked ahead of us, basking in the glory that was their first win. \"Don't worry about it, it's not your fault.\" Gary said, putting his arm around Alan's shoulder, \"They like to show off.\" \"Wait, they? I heard you say they.\" Julius turned on Gary. \"Ya, they, them over there.\" The boys continued to fight until Emma, Ray and their friends pulled up, asking Gary to join them, which he refused. We didn't even notice the disappearance of three of our friends until Petey was yelling at Sunshine, and then Blue when he tried to defend him. All of the black guys began to follow an angry Petey away, but I grabbed onto Julius's arm. He turned to face me, \"Um,\" I didn't know what to say, \"I need to show you something.\" \"Well, um, ok.\" He affirmed. \"My car is over that way.\" He gestured across the street. We crossed the road and he led me over to my side of the car. He opened the door for me and gestured for me to sit before closing the door and walking over to his side of the car. \"So where are we going?\" He asked as he pulled out of the parking space. \"Um...\" I paused. \"Go straight.\" He did. \"See the second light, so not this one but the next? Turn right.\" I gave him instructions with no real destination, but somehow we ended up at the little Pee Wee field. \"So, you take me from my football game to a midget stadium?\" He looked over at me. \"This was my childhood. Let's go.\" I led him over to the little shed that contained all the gear. I quickly entered the combination on the padlock. \"Are you supposed to know the code?\" Julius asked. \"What my daddy doesn't know won't hurt him.\" I pulled out a single football, ran from the shed and threw it as far as I could. \"That was pretty good.\" Julius said after he retrieved the ball for me. \"Now, try it like this.\" He came right up behind me. He slid my feet one at a time with his own. Placing his hands on my hips he rotated me slightly, then he reached around my body, covering my hands with his much larger ones, moving my hands slightly, I felt him tense up, and then guide me through a slow motion version of the throw. \"Now you try.\" He released me from his grasp. I tried and it went so far. \"Haha! Yes!\" I spun around and wrapped my arms around his neck, my momentum causing the two of us to spin around. He picked my up bridal style and continued to spin, and then, all of a sudden, water. \"Oh my god!\" I giggled, tucking my head into the crook of his neck, shielding myself from the water. I felt him moving; still holding me until he reached what I guessed was a dry spot and sat down. \"You can open your eyes now.\" He whispered in my ear. I slowly lifted my head from his neck and met his gaze. I felt our faces slowly growing closer together until our lips were just about to touch when another car pulled up. We pulled away from each other. \"There you are!\" It was Gary. \"We were looking all over for you! You just disappeared.\" Gary scolded me for a solid minute, not once did he seem to notice I was partially on Julius's lap. \"I'll drive you home now.\" Julius said, prompting me to stand before Gary noticed. I followed the cue. \"Fine by me, Coach can flip on you.\" Gary said to Julius. \"You're joking right?\" He asked as he held the door open for me. He looked down at me, \"He's joking right?\" I nodded. \"See you guys tomorrow.\" Julius said as he and Gary climbed into their cars and left the Pee Wee field. The car ride home was quiet, just me giving him instruction on how to reach my house. When we reached the little farm Dad and I called home, he got out and opened the door for me and walked me to the door like a perfect gentleman. \"Well, I'll see you at school.\" I offered a small smile. \"Ya I guess.\" I turned to let myself inside. \"Oh Cheryl.\" I turned back to him. One arm wrapped around my waist and the other tilted my chin up. And then our lips met. At first I didn't know what to do, but then I just let instinct take over. I reached my arms up and pulled him in closer. When we finally ended the kiss, he smiled at me, \"I'm not one to leave things half finished.\"[Chapter 4] The next week was uneventful as integrating could be. It wasn't long before I found myself sitting in the bleachers for the second Titans game. The guys were doing horribly. They were playing, but they weren't. Gerry was one you could tell at the first glance. The football god I had come to know was failing. All of the guys were failing. And even with their failure, they still won, don't ask me how, but they did. The next day the Coach Boone and Nicky arrived at our home in the middle of the day while I was shooting hoops. Coach Boone quickly excused himself to my daddy's office. I passed the ball to Nicky, but she refused, saying she had just done her nails. \"Then what are we gonna do?\" I asked her. \"I don't know.\" She said, letting her eyes stray, \"How's high school treating you?\" \"Its fine. You?\" \"Good. The Titans are doing pretty good, I guess.\" She offered. \"Ya, only one game in and its obvious we have a strong team.\" I said. \"And an attractive one...\" She mumbled. \"Did you really just say that?\" I laughed with her. \"Of course! Have you seen them?\" She giggled, \"I mean Rev and Petey are hot, and so is that Ray, but he's a racist ass, and Ronnie...too bad he's not into us... you know about what happened with him and Gary right? And Gary! He's not too bad either.\" \"Gary, dear, is off limits. The kid is like my big brother. And I don't think Ronnie actually swings that way...\" \"Then it looks like Julius will have to settle...\" \"He's off limits too.\" \"I knew it! What's going on between you two? I see you guys talking in the hallways. Do you see the looks he gives you?\" She went on and on, almost like I do with football, \"So what's up between you two?\" \"Honestly, I don't know.\" Was all I could muster. After all, he hadn't talked to me since that day he dropped me off. \"Nicky.\" The men had emerged from my father's office, \"It's time to leave if you want to get to your friend's house in time.\" \"We will finish this conversation later.\" Nicky looked at me before jumping in the car with her dad and driving off. \"What conversation?\" My dad asked, wrapping his arm around my shoulder. \"Teenaged stuff.\" I shrugged. \"Oh.\" This was one of the disadvantages of growing up with only a dad, they don't know how to deal with teenage girl stuff. The next day at school, I got a black eye. I was minding my own business walking through the hallway when I overheard Petey saying to some big white guy \"I don't see any livestock around here, so I don't know what you're talking about.\" He was then attacked. Now, this is where I stopped minding my own business, I ran off down the hallway, trying to find Gary or Julius or some big buff football guy. I found Ray first, but I figured he wouldn't do anything, so I ran on, right into Gary, and he went running; me at his heals. Gary ran right up to the group of guys that had Petey held against a locker, but was ripped off of them by a new group of black guys, they shoved him against the lockers on the other side. Then Julius was there, ripping guys off of Gary. Me being me, ended up getting a foot to the face as Julius spun a guy around, up in the air. I fell to the ground, then I was gone. Slowly, it was all coming back to me: the pain in my nose, the sensation of falling and the pain in my head, then it all became blurry. I remembered being carried and then nothing again until now. I slowly opened my eyes, taking in the white room and the white bed under me. \"You're up. Nurse, she's up.\" A voice called. I glanced around the room and my eyes came to rest on the bluish green chair in the corner. Julius. The nurse came bustling in, \"Do you remember what happened?\" \"Not really. I remember a fight and getting hit and falling and a pain in my head and then nothing really.\" \"Well, you seem fine. A small concussion, if anything. To be honest, I don't really know why you blacked out...\" \"Nurse, we need you in the other room.\" Another nurse called, sticking her head in the door. \"Stomach flu.\" She stated, \"Well, your dad should be here soon, your friend went to get him. Will you be ok here?\" She shot a distrustful glance at Julius. \"I will be just fine thank you.\" I said coldly. She left and I looked at Julius, but he refused to meet my gaze. \"Julius? Are you ok?\" \"Ya. I'm fine.\" He said, looking at me for a minute before turning away. \"Julius?\" He raised an eyebrow, \"What happened?\" \"You don't remember?\" He asked, looking at me incredulously. I shook my head, \"I made that guy kick you in the face! How do you not remember that? I didn't see you and I just lifted him up and... I'm so sorry.\" He buried his face in his hands. \"Julius, come over here.\" I said. He remained motionless, \"Don't make me get up.\" I said. This made him stand and walk to the side of my bed. I patted the empty spot beside me, but he refused to sit. I reached my hand out and grasped onto his hand that was hanging at his side. He allowed for me to hold on, but he didn't return the action. \"I know you didn't mean it.\" I stroked the back of his hand with my thumb, \"You were trying to protect Gary and Petey. I shouldnt have been so close.\" He still refused to meet my gaze, \"Come on Julius, please?\" \"Where is she?\" I heard my daddy's urgent voice. \"In through there Coach Yoast.\" Julius pulled his hand out of my grasp and leaned against the wall. My father came striding in, Gary at his heals. \"Sweetheart, are you ok?\" Daddy asked, stroking my hair. \"I'm fine, Daddy.\" \"Gosh, honey, that's quite a shiner you got there.\" Daddy joked. \"Nothing make up can't fix.\" Gary said quickly, flashing a look at Julius who had turned away. \"Coach, can you come out here for a minute, we need you to sign something.\" My dad kissed me on the cheek and then left. \"Julius, I don't get it. You tackle guys as a sport. I bet a bunch of them get black eyes or bruises or something, but that doesn't faze you. So why does this?\" I asked, getting worked up. \"'Cause I don't care about them!\" He yelled, \"They don't matter! When I saw you on the ground I...\" He glanced at Gary, \"I... I gotta go.\" He walked out of the room. I called after him, but he never came back. \"You know, he stopped because of you.\" I grumbled to my brother. \"So what's up between you two?\" Gary asked sitting on the foot of my bed and ignoring my accusation. \"You are just as bad as Nicky,\" the girl had ambushed me after first period today, \"Well, I told you about my date with Ray, and then he saved me on that first day and we went to the Pee Wee field and he kissed me and then this and...\" \"Wait, what?\" Gary asked, face frozen. \"Well, he's really upset that I got hurt...\" \"Before that.\" \"We went to the Pee Wee field?\" \"You know which one I'm talking about.\" He was getting impatient, \"You two kissed?\" \"Well, um...\" I didn't know what to say to the over bearing big brother staring at me. \"Yes or no question.\" \"Yes.\" \"Do I need to kill him or just hurt him?\" \"Neither. You will not touch him. Unless you want to force him to get over the black eye thing.\" I sighed. \"And don't tell my dad. I don't think anything is really gonna happen, so it'd be pointless.\" \"If that's what you want.\" \"Hey man.\" I called to my brother. \"Hey, superman!\" He went to high five me, but I refused, \"What's up?\" \"Can we talk over there?\" I gestured to the corner, away from the other groups of football players waiting in the gym for the team to fully assemble. \"Ya sure.\" We walked over, \"What's on your mind, Bertier?\" \"What's up with you and Cheryl. Before you say anything, she already told me about the other night.\" \"Oh, um. I'm sorry man. I, I don't know what happened, we were just... and then...\" He was panicking. \"Dude, don't worry about it. I just want to make sure everything is ok.\" \"Ya. I guess.\" He wouldn't meet my eyes. \"Wanna hear a story?\" He didn't respond, \"Back in the Pee Wee league when Cheryl and I were on opposite teams, I tripped while running and knocked into her, before she put her pads on and she went face first into the fence. She got a bloody nose and all she did was turned and laughed at me.\" Julius offered a small smile, \"Honestly, her dad makes a bigger deal out of her pain than she does. And when I told him today, he was worried about her ya, but he didn't blame you at all. So you can calm down.\" \"Thanks Superman. We better get on with this meeting.\"[Chapter 5] \"Come on! Come on! Just ten more yards! NO!\" \"Sheryl!\" My dad scolded walking into the den with the popcorn, \"You were in the nurse's office all day for blacking out without reason. Calm down.\" He sat beside me, resting his arm on the back of the coach behind me. \"So, what did I miss.\" \"Well! Number 46 got tackled by Number 7 and DROPPED THE BALL!\" They doorbell rang, \"You wait here sweetie.\" Dad stood and kissed the top of my head before walking to the door. I continued contemplating the game and the stupidness of some of the players. How could idiots like this be in the NFL? We had guys better than this on our high school team! I mean we had Gerry and Petey and Sunshine and Julius. Julius. What was up with him? First he kisses me, saying he doesn't leave things unfinished. Then he ignores me. If that isn't unfinished, I don't know what is. \"Hey, Sheryl?\" My dad called, \"Are you in the mood for entertaining a guest?\" What could he possibly mean by that? \"Um, ya I guess.\" I heard a set of footfalls coming from the hallway towards me, and another moving away, presumably towards the kitchen. \"I figured the game would be on.\" A quiet voice came from the doorway behind me. I knew the voice, but I had to turn around and confirm it. \"Gerry? What are you doing here?\" I asked, confused. \"I thought you might want a debriefing on your love life.\" He came and sat next to me, placing his arm around me. \"I have a love life now?\" I asked, trying to avoid the awkwardness this conversation came with. \"Oh shut up. You and I both know that you do. After all, I come over here and tell you about Julius and then I go to practice or class or something and I give him a pep talk and then he asks me to come over here and find out...\" \"I get it! I have a love life. A very complicated love life.\" \"And it's even more complicated since he's black...\" I shot him a look. \"What! You know I have no problem with him! He's my best friend! But he isn't everybody's!\" Neither of us thought while this sunk in. \"Doesn't mean he won't be.\" Said a voice from the doorway. \"Oh. Uh, hey coach. We were just talking about... um...\" He tried to find a way out. \"Gerry, knock it off.\" My dad wasn't stupid, \"Honey. If you and Julius want to be together, you should. Take it from someone who knows, love doesn't wait forever.\" Then he left. \"Gerry, what time is it?\" I asked. \"Um...\" He checked his watch, \"Nine thirty.\" \"Wanna drive me somewhere?\" I asked, keeping my fingers crossed. \"Where?\" \"The burg.\" I smiled a small smile at him. \"Anywhere in particular?\" He returned the smile. \"I think you know where. I'm taking that as a yes, by the way, let's go.\" I walked down the hallway into the front entrance, \"Dad! Gerry and I are going out! We'll be back soon...ish.\" I threw on a sweatshirt and a pair of sneakers as fast as I could, meanwhile, hopping towards Gerry's car pulling him with me. \"Am I dropping you off or...?\" Gerry asked as we approached the all black neighborhood. \"I... Let's see how it goes.\" I trialed off, \"You know which house it is right?\" \"I don't think we need to...\" Gerry said, pointing into a yard of one of the larger houses. One with a boy taking out the garbage. Gerry slowly pulled up to the curb. I watched as Julius tensed up at the sight of the approaching car, then relaxed when he recognized the Camero. \"Superman!\" Julius opened his arms when Gerry stepped out of the car. \"Actual, the correct term tonight is cab driver...\" I took this as my cue to open my door. \"Hey Julius, I, um, I thought we should talk.\" His face froze when he saw me, but he quickly regained his composure. \"Ya, uh, sure. Gerry, if you want you could head home, I'll make sure she's taken care off.\" The boys shared a look before Gerry got in his car and drove off that led me to believe that that last part meant more. Julius turned his back to me, opened the garbage can and hoisted the full black bag into it. I couldn't help but notice his arm muscles that were clearly visible in his tank top. He began to walk back up the path, leaving me at the curb. He turned at looked at me over his shoulder, \"Well? You coming?\" I could see his smile even in the dark as I hurried to catch up to him. When I was level with him, he turned to look at me, \"Just a warning. It might be a little... hectic... inside.\" \"Please, I grew up around Ray and Gerry and the guys, hectic is normal.\" He smiled at me, nodding his head a little to the side in agreement. Julius opened the door for me, allowing me to walk in first. The house was big for the burg, but on a normal scale, it barely met normal. The small living room we had walked into was beautiful. It had slightly worn hardwood flooring with cream walls. The couch and love seat were a light shade of blue. In the middle of all this were children. There were four in total. A young girl, maybe 12, was lounging on the love seat, flipping through the channels on the television. Her hair was pulled up into a loose bun, which accented her shoulders that were visible in her yellow tank top. Her legs were stretched out in front of her on the coach, clad in her purpleish pink pajama pants. The other four sat on the floor. The eldest of the group was a young boy, around age 8 maybe. He had on a set of pajamas portraying none other than superman. He was playing with several cars and trains, every once and a while picking them up and making whooshing noises. The final two must have been twins, as they were seemed so similar in age. They were young, probably three at most, using their little play bench to support them on their unstable legs. The little girl had her hair pulled up into two little pigtails on the very top of her head. The boy's had a tuff of long hair spurting from his head, going every which way. \"Maddy, Derek, Emma, Peyton. This is Cheryl.\" Julius announced, the older two gave half-hearted waves while the younger two giggled and cooed at her. \"Hey!\" Julius barked. The older two turned to look, their eyes bugging a bit. \"Julius,\" The boy started, \"You know she's white, right.\" Julius smiled, \"Ya, I know.\" He turned to me, \"That's Peyton, he's nine. Maddy, she's thirteen. Moody, too.\" He grumbled the last part to himself. \"That's Derek, and this little lady,\" he beant down to pick up the little girl who had crawled over to us, \"is Emma. They are two. Twins.\" \"Julius! Do I hear you introducing people?\" A woman appeared in the archway. \"Hello dear, I'm Julius's mother, Hazel.\" The woman whipped her hands on her apron before offering me her hand to shake. \"You just missed Julius's father, he's working the night shift tonight...\" \"Mom.\" Julius cut her off, \"Sorry, It's been a long day. Can Cheryl and I go up to my room?\" He asked. \"It might be better if you go in the den since Peyton is going to bed right after I get the twins to sleep.\" She responded. \"Maddy, go get Emma from Julius.\" After Mrs. Campbell and Maddy disappeared up the stairs with the twins, Julius asked the other boy, \"You're gonna behave until mom gets back right?\" \"Are you?\" The young boy gave him a sly look. \"Go to bed.\" Julius laughed leading me through double doors into a tiny room. \"You had to ask him if he was gonna behave?\" \"You should've seen what he did at Rev's house. Lord, his mother almost lost her curtains.\" We laughed for a bit, but only for so long before it subsided into a quiet awkwardness. \"So, um, how do we do this?\" He asked. We had sat on opposite sides of the little couch, facing in towards each other. \"Hey, I made the first step in coming over here. It's your turn now.\" I dodged the bullet. \"Well, I guess it comes down to whether or not we want to be together...\" Silence, \"Well do we want to be together?\" I had never seen Julius Campbell so timid before. \"I don't know, do we?\" I diverted the question. \"It's gonna be hard,\" he paused looking down at his hands, then up through his lashes, \"but most things that are worth it are.\" I felt a smile come to my lips and without intending to, I leaned across, closing the distance between us, my lips meeting his. It was like nothing I had ever felt before. His touch, as his arms wrapped around me, pulling me closer, was strong, but soft. He was forceful but not in a scary way. I could kiss him forever, that is if it wasn't for the fact we needed to breath. We pulled away from one another, panting slightly. I rested my forehead against the crook of his neck, he turned his head slightly, planting a soft kiss on my temple. \"What time is your dad expecting you home?\" He asked. \"Soonish.\" I responded. \"From now or when you left?\" He smiled warmly. \"Then.\" \"Well, considering it's almost eleven, I think its soonish. Come on.\" We walked to his car, saying goodbye to his mother as we walked out. The ride home was quiet, with him holding my hand the entire way. \"Who are we gonna tell?\" He asked, not taking his eyes away from the road. \"The football team, I think would be a nice start.\" I answered. Silence again. \"Julius. Why was it that you tensed up when Gerry's car came to the curb?\" I asked quietly. \"It was nothing.\" He responded. \"Julius, please.\" \"At night, not even home is truly safe.\" We were at my house now, he looked around at the sight before him. The little farmhouse with warm yellow light streaming out of the windows was the quintessence of safety. \"At least not in the burg.\" \"Oh. I'm - I'm sorry.\" I had no idea how to respond to that. \"Don't be. It's not your fault.\" He turned off the car, \"I never really noticed until the younger kids were born. I just, I want the best for them, and now with the race mixing, well, I've actually thought about giving Peyton and Maddie pepper spray or something...\" \"If you ever need anything, my dad and I would love to help.\" I said to which he offered a small smile and a thank you. \"It looks like your dad is getting a little impatient. He's passed by that window five times in the past minute.\" He laughed, getting out of the car. He walked around the car and opened my door just as I was about to get out. I stood and offered him a smile \"Well I do declare! What a perfect gentleman!\" \"Ha ha ha. Very funny.\" He laughed, wrapping his arm around my shoulders, leading me to the door. Neither of us had to open it since my dad threw it open, \"Cheryl! What happened to Gerry? Why are you so late?\" \"Sorry Coach. My fault. Gerry brought her over and we told him he could go home and that I would make sure she got home alright. We ended up losing track of time.\" \"I did say soonish...\" I trailed off. \"Soonish implies half an hour, an hour at most.\" He said, smiling. \"Julius, its getting late, your folks will be worried.\" \"Yes Sir.\" Julius gave my shoulders a gentle squeeze, \"I'll see you tomorrow.\" With that he walked to his car and drove off. \"So, are you two...\" My dad started. \"Uh...\"[Chapter 6] A.N. Heads up, there is a bit of a, questionable scene a little later in this chapter involving Ray. I just want to say, I do not intend to offend anyone, it's just that, well, Ray is an ass. You'll know it when you get to it, it starts once she stops him in the hallway. I'll recap it in an AN at the bottom for those of you who wish to skip it. \"So, are you two...\" My dad started. \"Uh...\" I feigned a yawn, \"Dad, I'm really tired.\" I made for the stairs. \"Not so fast young lady.\" He reached out his arm, stopping me. \"I let you out of the house with one teenage boy and then you return two hours later with a different teenage both. Not to mention they are both on my football team... Basically, I just want to know if I should be watching you and Julius while you are on the sidelines.\" \"We aren't sure really. Um, we are gonna do a test run type thing. Just tell the team and see how that goes.\" \"Good luck with that.\" The next day, I woke up bright and early, ready to go to early practice with coach. I quickly dressed in the dark, throwing on a pair of jeans and a gray t-shirt with T.C. Williams written across it in maroon. I threw on a pair of sneakers before running downstairs to make breakfast for my father and I. The sun was just rising when we arrived at the field, being greeted by Boone and a few of the team members. Gerry jogged over to me, throwing an arm around me. \"So, you and Julius? What happened?\" I quickly recounted the events of the night to Gerry, \"So you are together now.\" \"Ya we are.\" A pair of arms wrapped around my waist from behind, \"Now, it is five in the morning, why are you not wearing clothing?\" \"I am to wearing clothing! See!\" I pulled the hem of my shirt out. \"Put this on. I don't need you freezing.\" Julius shrugged out of his signature black leather jacket. He allowed enough space between the two of us for him to wrap it around my shoulders. \"There.\" He smiled, nuzzling his nose into my neck. \"Well, before I barf, Julius, we gotta go get ready.\" Gerry said to my boyfriend over my shoulder. \"Fine.\" He planted a light kiss on my cheek before unwrapping me from his arms, \"Keep the jacket on.\" Then the two were gone. I walked around the field while all the men were in the locker room, taking in the dew on the grass and the feel of light moisture floating around in the air. Tonight the boys had their third game. The coaches figured that giving the guys a morning practice, therefore freeing up their time in the afternoon. \"So now you're wearing the animal's jacket?\" I hadn't heard Ray come up beside me, but he was here now. \"Ya. I am wearing Julius's jacket.\" I said curtly, \"Aren't you supposed to be in the locker room with the rest of the team?\" \"I ditched once Coach Coone started giving his pep talks. But enlighten me, why him over me. I come from a great family with money in the bank and a house with rooms to spare, he shares a room with his kid brother while his daddy works nights.\" \"Wanna know why, you pompous ass?\" I spun on him. Just now realizing the rest of the team was out of the locker room now and staring at us, \"He isn't an ass! He doesn't ditch a girl in the woods at midnight! He doesn't expect the world to be handed to him on a silver platter. And most importantly, he isn't a racist jerk!\" I walked back towards the stands, where the entire team was watching, and into the girls locker room. I don't know why it was there, off of a football field, but it was and I was glad for it. The guys couldn't come in. The only reason I was allowed to make the occasional appearance in the boys locker room was 'cause my daddy was the coach and his office was located inside. \"Hey.\" An unfamiliar voice came from the entranceway. \"Your dad sent me in here. He was worried.\" It was Sunshine. \"So they sent you in here?\" \"Wow. Venomous much?\" He feigned a look of hurt. I shrugged, \"They are running defense now, so your boys are both occupied. Is everything ok?\" \"Considering Ray just essentially attacked my boyfriend in front of everyone, just dandy.\" I bit out sarcastically. \"So not to great.\" He smiled. I grimaced back. \"Listen.\" He sat on the bench beside me, \"I'm not gonna pretend that I know how you are feeling, wow, never thought I'd say that, anyway, I never had the issue of dating a black chick during an integration. I've dated a black girl, but California is rather relaxed about race. Sure it matters, but, no where near as much.\" \"So you would date a black girl?\" I could help but think of Nicky and her wonderings regarding the back up QB. \"Ya. Why not?\" He shrugged it off, \"But you know, it would mean a lot to Julius if you came out. He's kinda sucking since his head isn't in the game.\" \"Fine.\" We both stood, \"Can you just answer me one question? I'm really confused, are you gay? Or are you straight? Or? Like, I honestly don't care, but I'm just really confused.\" \"Sweets, I am not gay. Trust me.\" He winked at me and threw his arm around my shoulder and led me outside. \"So, class is out, I don't have practice, you wanna go do something?\" Julius asked, leaning against the locker beside mine. \"Ya, sure. Where are we gonna go?\" I asked reaching up on my tip toes to reach the top shelf of my locker. \"Here, Shorty.\" Julius took the book from my hand and tucked it into place with ease. \"Thanks.\" I scowled at him. \"Not a problem.\" He smiled at me. \"Well, to be honest, Maddie want to meet you.\" \"She already met me!\" I laughed, \"Did someone hit you a little too hard in practice today?\" \"No! She says that meeting you thinking you were a one night stand is different than as a girlfriend.\" It was the first time he used the actual title. \"You have a lot of those? One night stands I mean?\" I asked, trying to sound indifferent. \"Nah, I leave that to Petey...\" He laughed. \"Little Petey? He has a baby doll face!\" \"That's what he wants you to think!\" The two of us laughed. \"Ok, let's go. We'll go see her.\" I closed my locker door. \"She gets out of school in ten, twenty minutes. Let's go.\" We made for the exit, me contemplating my new task of wooing the little sister. My meeting with Maddy went better than planned, she reminded me of the little sister I never had. She was like no girl I had ever met before, she had a certain quality to her that made me feel like I need to be around her, it's the same quality Julius possesses. The meeting went so well that I had no problem \"babysitting\" her, as Julius put it, during the game. The Groveton Lions were already on the field, warming up, trying to intimidate us. How do our boys respond to this? They dance. The entire team clusters into a tight knit box, doing a little skip as they advance along with some arm movements. I couldn't help but notice that a few hands, when they came up, particularly in the middle of the cluster, were sporting raised middle fingers. I point Julius out to Maddy and she finds him easily, in the front row between Petey and Gerry. They are all doing the same dance, but each, at least of those in the front row, have their own version. Petey, forever playful, is really getting into it, throwing his hands up and down. Julius, less into it, but putting in the effort for the team ends up hopping a little to the side each time. Gerry is doing the best he can, not really hopping, more like springing, but his feet never leave the ground. Alan is very into it, moving his head to the rhythm and everything. Blue doesn't jump, instead he skips in a way, enjoying the music, I guess. Sunshine, just walks, only doing the arm motions; I guess that, since half the school thinks he's gay, it be best not to give them something to fuel the fire with. Either way the cheerleaders look taken aback when upstaged by their football jocks. \"Oo! I feel good!\" The boys chant. \"Julius's playing strong side linebacker!\" I explain to Maddy, too swept away in my enthusiasm to hear her calling my name. \"He's so good, he's got All-American written all over her. And Gerry Bertier...\" \"Cheryl!\" Here desperate call breaks through the football haze and I stop talking, \"I. Do. Not. Care.\" The boys start the main part of their dance now. \"Five. Six. Five. Six. Seven. Eight.\" One of them calls out, but its too loud and too far away to make out exactly who. I'd bet it was Blue. \"Ev'ry where we go-o. Ev'ry where we go-o. People wanna kno-ow. People wanna kno-ow. Who we a-are. Who we a-are. So we tell them. So we tell them. We are the Titans. We are the Titans. The mighty mighty Titans. The mighty mighty Titans. Oo, Ah, Oh Yeah. Oo, Ah, Oh Yeah.\" They go on and on. The boys played a good game, and won, but not without losing. During the very first play of the game, Kip Tyler, number 48 blew right by Ray, who seemed to not even attempt to hold him, and crushed Rev, shattering a bone in his wrist. I was positive Ray wanted this, he seemed just too concerned over Rev's wrist. I think Boone suspected it too, but he let it drop. Sunshine went in, and I could tell he wasn't all too sure of himself, but he had to be. I saw him look up at the stands right before breaking from the huddle. I watch his eye and follow their gaze, right to Nicky, who waves at him, causing a ghost of a smile on his lips which somehow I can see. I watch as 48 blows right by Lastik. Sunshine takes quick steps back, not knowing of the oncoming mass. He turns, throws the ball hard and far. Just as Kip is about to reach him, Sunshine ducks down, bending at the waist and slightly at the knees. Kip rolls onto his back and Sunshine stands up, looking down at his prey. Another of Kip's teammates is so taken aback by this feat that he slows to stand by Sunshine, not even trying to tackle him, in fact, he lets Sunshine half heartedly push him away. This gives the boys hope, with Kip Tyler out of the picture, they easily win, even with Sunshine doing a bit of show-boating on the field. I walk Maddy to her mom's car who is waiting for her at the curb. After watching them drive away, I walk back into the gym standing against a wall, wanting to surprise Julius. Gerry is standing beside the doors, obviously waiting for someone. Too bad he wasn't getting Julius tonight; tonight he's mine. He stops Ray and they talk for a bit, it's obvious that Ray is angry. Ray walks away, a grimace on his face, right towards me. I follow him out, needing to know what happened. I stop him in the hallway just far enough that we can't be heard from inside the gym. \"Ray?\" He turns, and boy was I glad looks couldn't kill, \"What happened?\" \"Like you don't know! You bitch! You animal loving bitch!\" He had me pinned to a locker now by my neck. I could feel my airways being crushed. He seems to ponder something, \"You'll have to do.\" He presses his body to mine, driving any air I had out of me, and crash his lips onto mine. I struggle and struggle. \"Filthy little animal slut.\" He backs away slightly. He spits, his saliva landing on his cheek, \"You don't even deserve that.\" He jerks my head forward and then back, right into the locker. And then I'm gone. A.N. So basically Ray acts like the ass he is and knocks Cheryl out. Wow. I could've just written that instead of the last paragraph. Huh.[Chapter 7] \"Why is it that every time I get hurt, I wake up to you?\" My eyes had just opened and rested on Julius, once again in a hideous green chair. \"Thank God.\" His voice was breathless. He crossed the room in two strides, grabbing my face with both of his hands, one on either side and crashed his lips to mine. They moved with an urgency, a strength I hadn't felt in them before. \"I thought I lost you.\" He said, ending the kiss, but not moving away. \"Why? How long have I been out?\" I asked, confused. To be entriely honest I could barely remember why I was in here. All I remembered was the game and the boys special warm up, waiting for Julius and Gerry and then Ray getting kicked off the team and... Ray! \"He... he could've killed me.\" \"You were out for almost a week. But he hasn't woken up yet.\" Julius's eyes were hard. \"Wait. He hasn't woke up yet? But, he didn't get hit.\" Did my mind leave something out? \"When Gerry and I found you,\" he paused, seemingly planning something, \"Ray, he um, he was working on your buckle...\" I processed what he had just said for a moment. Puzzling over his phrasing. Working on your buckle? I don't have any buckles. Except for my... my belt. I stared up at Julius \"He... he was going to rape me?\" \"I, I think so.\" We were silent. \"Thank you. For saving me.\" He didn't answer verbally, but took one of my hands in his two. The small parts of my skin visible through his much larger hands, which almost completely enclosed mine, resembled the moon and the stars shining through the blackest night. The contrast was beautiful. I was released from the hospital three days later. After being monitored 24/7, I was ready to just go crazy and it was perfect timing too, since the Titans had officially made it to the semi-finals of States and Alan was documenting every moment of it. One day, Sunshine tried to teach Big Blue Ti Chi. It was amusing watching the thin Californian move so gracefully through the movements and then observe as Big Blue attempted to copy the motions. Sometimes he almost succeeded, almost. Another day was Petey's birthday and decided to celebrate right before school. We all chipped in to buy him a nice big birthday cake, which Julius promptly shoved in his face. Later on in the party, Petey unwrapped presents, one of which was my duck-tape covered football with the words \"DON'T DROP ME\" written on the side in black sharpie. This got a round of laughs. Later that day, Petey was slacking off in practice. I started yelling, but it wasn't until I actually started to physically go after him that there was any noticeable improvement. Suddenly it was touchdown after touchdown, which led to a round of jokes about manliness at Petey's expense. That Friday, the guys organized a car smash. Each of the boys took their turns. Julius and Gerry went up together, walking with what Julius called \"swag.\" I was jumping and clapping on the sidelines when Julius grabbed onto my hands pulling me into the loop. Gerry handed me the mallet. I tried to hand it back, but they wouldn't take it. Julius walked up behind me and helped me strike the car directly on the hood. I giggled, for maybe the first time in this life, and turned, wrapping my arms around him. His arms snaked around me and our lips met. Flag after flag rose into the air. Fouls upon fouls. This game was rigged. I could see our boys getting frustrated. I yelled and jumped but nothing changed, until my dad walked onto the field and had a hushed conversation with one of the refs. All of a sudden he had a new attitude. The boys huddled around them, but Petey soon left the huddle. I ran down the bleacher stairs. I needed to be with the team, I was a part of that team. I was about to jump onto the field when a pair of arms enclosed me. \"Kiss me now, or else the animal gets shot.\" I felt the gun in the front pocket. The cold hard metal was pressed up against the small of my back. I knew who it was, so I didn't doubt the danger. I turned and kissed Ray with all I had. Obviously no one had told anyone about Ray's assault and attempt of rape towards me, because if someone had, I would not be in this situation. In the situation no girl should ever be in. In a situation where they had to watch their boyfriend jog out of a game where they are finally getting ahead, look up into the stands and see their girlfriend kissing the man , if you can call Ray that, that abused them. Little did he know it was for him that I was betraying him. I kissed him for Julius, because I knew that padding that protected him from two hundred pounds of flesh wouldn't protect him from the bullet Ray would for certain send his way. Julius's expression turned cold and heartless. He sat on the bench his back to me. \"You sit right here. Understand.\" Ray commanded. I followed his instructions, after all Julius was closer and now with out a helmet. Ray's arm snaked around my waist. An action Julius had committed hundreds of times, but never once had it felt like this one. Never once had it felt wrong. \"Julius!\" I ran into the locker room after the team, \"Julius!\" He stopped, but only for a moment before moving on. \"Sheryl. I need to talk to you.\" It was my dad. He pulled me into a deserted part of the bleachers and explained to me how the Hall of Fame officials had fixed the game to assure my daddy would be head coach again. He went on about how it was unfair and how he had to speak up even though he lost the hall of fame. I expressed my irritation with the Hall, but other than that, my mind was occupied. Even with my boyfriend hating me, it wasn't until we got the phone call that I truly went numb.[Chapter 8] \"Where is he?\" I slammed my hands on the desk, startling the nurse on duty, \"Where is he!\" My voice was laced with hysteria. \"You must excuse her Nurse... Ethel.\" Petey read her name tag, \"She's had a rough night, I'm just gonna take her back to the Campbell-Berteir room.\" Petey guided me around the desk without giving the nurse a chance to respond. We took a left, then a right, then another left. He stopped me outside a closed door with two little charts secured to the wall beside it. \"I'm gonna give you time alone with them.\" \"Petey? How, how bad are they?\" I whispered, it was all I could muster. \"Julius is ok, minor scrapes and bruises, small concussion.\" He paused, \"Gerry took the brunt of the impact. He's paralyzed from the waist down. He's unconscious still.\" I felt like I had been hit by the same truck that had hit my boys as they were setting out on their joy ride. I slowly eased my way into the room, closing the door behind me. \"He doesn't want to see you.\" I jumped. I hadn't anticipated a voice so strong, much less a female voice. I turned to see Maddie sitting in one of those horribly colored green chairs beside her brother's bed. \"You don't understand! Hell, he doesn't understand! There were certain circumstances!\" I cried out to her, I'm sure I have hit a million tears in the past hour. \"Like what? That the cracker is rich? Or that he's popular? Or is it simply that he's a cracker?\" She spat out rising to her feet. \"No.\" I yelled though my hysteria. \"Then what was it then? I'm just dying to know.\" She rolled her eyes. \"He had a gun and a clear shot to Julius's head.\" She obviously was not expecting these words to leave my mouth in a whisper. \"Wha-what?\" She sunk back into her seat. \"I was going down to be with the team and Ray grabbed me and force the gun against my back, threatening to kill Julius if I didn't kiss him.\" I whispered. \"You expect me to believe that?\" She yelled back on her feet. \"Please! How would he have gotten a gun! That's just too convenient, too planned almost! It would never happen in real life, so I suggest you go take that gun and shove it up your -\" \"Maddie. I want to talk to her.\" Julius's eyes had fluttered open somewhere in the argument. \"But, she-\" \"Leave. Now.\" The girl shot me a nasty look before she huffed out of the room. There was an awkward silence, something that had never occurred between the two of us before. I shuffled my feet a bit as he stared at me with a cold gaze. \"Is what you said true?\" He broke the silence after what felt like an eternity. \"Yes.\" My voice cracked. \"Alright then. Come here.\" He held open his arms for me and I ran to the bed, climbing in beside him on top of the covers. \"Why do you believe me?\" I asked, resting my head on his chest. He was ok. Julius was ok. \"Because Gerry told me about the gun when Ray was kicked of the team and assaulted you. He told me you were lucky, since Ray always had a gun nearby. No one knows where he got it, but Gerry says he's seen it.\" \"I'm sorry. I would never have... you know... if there was any other way.\" \"I know. I know.\" \"Yoast. Where are they?\" My daddy demanded as we burst through the waiting room doors. Coach Yoast stood from his place beside Gerry's mother. \"They're in the back. Sheryl is in there with 'em.\" He informed. \"How long has she been in there?\" He asked. \"A while.\" \"If I go break in up, will I face the wrath of Sheryl Yoast?\" \"Probably.\" \"Well, imma do it anyway.\" My daddy disappeared. Minutes passed and then hours. I sat beside a tear-ridden Sheryl, trying to sooth her in anyway I could. The boys started to drift away, one by one or occasionally in small pairs. Our dads were with the boys in their room, upon their request, their own families having long since left in order to grieve in peace. \"Do you two want rides home?\" It was Sunshine, the last one left. I found this odd since he was probably the one who knew the boys the least, having just came from California. \"Um...\" Sheryl looked around the nearly empty room, \"Ya, let me just go tell the nurse.\" She walked over to the nurses stall and assumably told the nurse of our changed plans. She walked back to us, wrapping Julius's jacket tighter around her small frame. \"Let's go.\" \"Think she'll be ok?\" I asked Sunshine as he walked me to my front door. \"Who Sheryl?\" We paused at my front door, \"She'll be fine. She's strong.\" I turned and unlocked the door, knowing my mom had taken my little sister to see our grandparents, not knowing of the tragedy that would occur. \"Sunshine,\" I bit my lip, uncertain of myself, \"Could you, um, stay? At least until my dad gets back?\" \"Of course.\" He gestured for me to go inside following closely behind.[Chapter 9] A.N. Little bit of racism here, but it truly isn't me, I blame Ray. The night was calm. The sky was black with little pinpricks for stars scattered throughout. There was a slight breeze as I sat at the base of the old tree, among the tall swaying grass. Nothing about the night reflected what had just happened. Nothing about this night reflected what was to come. \"Ok, now, your turn. Truth or dare?\" Sunshine asked leaning back, studying me. \"Hm. Dare.\" I answered tentitivly. He smiled, mischievously, \"Kiss me.\" And I did. A week later, both boys were released from the hospital. Julius would be able to play in the championship by some miracle, Gerry, for obvious reasons could not, but he was able to sit on the bench with me and cheer on his teammates, which was exactly what happened come game day. The boys were ready. They had danced out on the field and ran through a couple drills. The boys could win this, they just had to believe they could. They had Julius, they had Sunshine, they had anyone they could need. They could win, if they believed in themselves, and in soul power. The boys lined up along the 50 yard line, ready to face the unstoppable Ed Henry's team. He was unstoppable, but so were we. The downs flashed by. The boys knew what they were doing, but they couldn't do it. Alan, as much as I love him, was no Petey, he wasn't fast enough to do any good. By some miracle, we were only down by seven come halftime, just one touchdown, but that might be enough to lose. I left Gerry on the bench, he's a big boy and he's got his chair. I ran after my daddy, \"Coach!\" \"Sheryl, go back outside, you can't come in here.\" \"I always do, but that's besides the point.\" I rushed though my sentence, \"Ed Henry's got Boone's number, sure shooting. You ain't doing nothing against that shot gun.\" I paused, looking him right in the eye, \"Look coach, now ain't the time to be proud.\" \"Hey, you're doing great! Don't worry, just...\" I grabbed a hold of Ronnie before he entered the locker room, pulling him off to the side. \"Now where did you come from?\" He smiled, wrapping his arms around me. \"The stands.\" I answered briskly, \"Just, go play some ball.\" I had no idea what to say with football. \"I'm pretty sure that's typically baseball, but will do.\" He leaned down and kissed me before jogging off to catch up to his team. \"You and I dear, need to have a conversation.\" Now, Sheryl Yoast wasn't my favorite person in the world, but she was one of the only people who understand what I'm going through. Our daddies are both coaches of the sole integrated team in Virginia, where football is life. We are the only two girls in an interracial relationship, though no one knew about mine yet. Sheryl Yoast wasn't my best friend by any standards. She was my sister; we just understood each other in a way no one else could even hope to. That being said, it didn't surprise me when I spent the entire halftime ignoring the cheerleaders and telling the blonde everything there was to tell about my short, but strong, relationship with the Californian dreamboat. The team came out of the locker room five minutes before they had to, gathering into a huddle, but not before Nicky and I squeezed into the middle among all the guys and behind our dads, right next to our boys. I took Julius's hand in mine and gave it a gentle squeeze. He tore his eyes away from Boone for only a moment, but that was long enough to give me a reassuring smile. We were gonna win, he was sure of it. The game began, with extra boys playing on defense and no Alan. Suddenly, the reason for Alan's disapearence became known, in the form of a freight train slamming into a sign or something f the sort. Petey was in and he was destroying. Just having Petey in seemed to be enough to give the team hope. Julius took out the quarter back, just before he threw the ball. Sunshine got an interception, then took a mean tackle. The score was 7-3, but even those few points were enough to give the team hope. They joked and laughed on the sidelines and played their hearts out on the field. There was only a few minutes left and we were on defense, so you could only imagine the rush of joy I got when it was Julius, coming from behind that caused a change in possession. Of course Petey had something to do with it, seeing as he finally learned how to hold the ball, but he wasn't my boyfriend so I didn't pay too much attention to that. We had time for one more play. I heard Boone give the direction, but I had no idea what it meant, and Rev taking the field only confused me further. Sunshine got the ball and handed it of to Rav who cut to the right. The two quarterbacks ran like their lives depended on it down the sideline, Rev with the ball and Sunshine blocking anyone that tried to stop them. They ran and ran and they made it. We had won. I flew up from the bench, dragging Nicky with me. We jumped and screamed before following our dads out to great the boys. I ran straight to Julius who hoisted me into the air. I wrapped my arms around his neck and my legs latched around his hips. We didn't kiss, but he spun me 'round and around. I heard the boys laughing and whooping before I saw it. Julius stopped the spinning in time for us both to see Nicky and Sunshine wrapped around each other in an intense lip lock. \"Did you know about...\" Julius asked, one arm around my waist, the other gesturing to the couple. \"Not until halftime.\" I giggled, spinning into him and kissing him straight on the lips. Eventually everyone calmed down and proceeded back to the bench, Julius still had his arm around my waist, he refused to let go, saying I was good luck since it was me who convince my dad to take Boone' advice or something like that. \"Hey! Monkey!\" Ray's voice came from the side. We both turned in time to se the gun held high, aimed directly at us. Football reflexes allowed Julius to push me out of the way, but not himself. But he didn't need to; someone else's football reflexes were faster. Gerry. Somehow, someway, Gerry had propelled himself from his wheel chair, directly into the gun's path, taking the bullet himself. Guards were on Ray in a flash, but that didn't matter to me. I was at Gerry's side as fast as I could. \"Gerry! You ass! How cold you do that!\" I cried out, clutching at his stomach trying to make the bleeding stop. Julius was beside us in a minute, having removed his uniform with hopes of stopping the blood. \"Please,\" Gerry laughed with a slight cough, \"I'm already half dead.\" \"Man, no you're not.\" Julius spoke, his voice cracking a bit. \"Just take care of her for me ok?\" Gerry looked directly at Julius and the boys seemed to have an unspoken understanding. \"Left side,\" Gerry raised his hand. \"Strong side.\" Julius clasped it with his own. Gerry turned his head to look at me, \"Sheryl, you will survive. Be strong, we both know you are.\" I watched as the lighter hand's grip slacked. My body was wracked by sobs. Someone was screaming, I just didn't notice it was me. Arms wrapped around me, pulling me away from my big brother. \"NO!\" I screamed, squirming in the arms, \"NO!\" I had to get to Gerry. \"Sheryl.\" The voice came through my hysteria. It was calm and comforting. For the first time in I don't know how long I actually saw something and was able to process it, Julius, \"Come here.\" He pulled me into his chest, wrapping his arms around me, tighter than ever. He was being strong for me. Julius wasn't stupid, he knew Gerry took the bullet for him, and that had to be eating him up inside. I had to be strong for Julius, for Gerry. I pulled my arms from between our chests and wrapped them around his neck, \"Let's go to the locker room or something.\" I stood, leading him into the building. We sat down on one of the long benches. I stared at him, trying to suppress my tears, but I couldn't do so as much as I wished I could. I don't know how Julius was doing it, \"Julius, please.\" And then a single tear fell from his left eye. I smiled at him before whisking it away. He pulled me into him once again, holding me against him and burying his face in my hair. \"I love you Sheryl.\" He spoke though the silence some time later. We shared a soft kiss, both of our faces tear streaked. \"Wait here.\" He stood, walking down another hall of lockers. When he returned he was holding something, \"I know, you are just a freshman and all, but I want to ask you something.\" He paused, \"Gerry and I had talked about it right before the game.\" Another pause, \"Would you agree, to agree to marry me?\" He asked, holding out his class ring all juniors had just received. This was what Gerry meant. This is what their silent conversation was about. \"Yes.\" I threw my arms around him catching his lips with mine. Ten years later, on the same day Gerry Bertier died, Julius and I were married, on the T.C. Williams football field. The goal posts were decorated with flowers and chairs were moved into the end zone for guests. The entire team was there. What really made the day special was that Gerry was there. One of the boys had taken a picture of Gerry and posted it on a chair. The day was perfect, both for marriage and for remembering him. ","Summary":" A.N. Hey everyone! So I'm on spring break right now, and I decided I should write a bit. I decided "},{"Movie":"Jeepers Creepers","Title":"Missing Trivia","Author":"Sarah Myers","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11326566","Passage":"[Chapter 1] The weater was hotter than it used to be and what made it worse was: the car's broken air-conditioner. „How far is the farm, dad?\" asked a girl in the back seat who's named Audrey, she is just an everyday 17 years old collage student who's now going on a summer vacation to her grandparents on their farm. „We almost there, don't worry! I'm sure that your grandmother missed you!\" Audrey's father wasn't a big fan of family vacations even he loved his only one daugther, but he's job was way more important than some silly holidays. The view from the black car was not the best, whatever you see is: sand and rocks and if you're lucky you may see little bushes too. Somewhat Audrey liked the fact that she's not in the city anymore, after all she's been learned a lot back in the collage. When she's just even think about learning she always feel like her brain is melting. Well she wanted to be a doctor isn't she? While her hardworking father drove Audrey remebered those nice days in high school: when she got pranked on the first day by some stupid jerks and when she went on parties… and now she is a collage student. Everything happens too fast… „What are you thinking on, dear?\" The dad looked back trought the reaview mirror seeing that his daugther was in half asleep. „Uh, nothing i'm just sleepy.\" „Yep, i see.\" Audrey's father turned on the radio which was played country music, his little Audrey's favourite gener of music. He knows when Audrey was around 6 years old, she often danced on country music what her father liked to see, seeing that his little daugther is happy. Those were the days! Meanwhile it's got darker, finally Audrey's father found the right way to the farm. The farm wasn't a huge one, it only had chickens and a white dog named Stan who was lived there since Audrey's brith. A little bit dirty but nice house was in the middle of the farm and right next to it flowed a small stream. An old lady showed up on the yard helping with the car and suitcases. „Ya'll finally arrived!\" The granny grabed Audrey and gave her a warm hug. She was so blissful to seeing her grandchild again, and probbanly Audrey could feelt the same. „Alright, you've got everything dear? Phone, clothes, books?\" The father steped back to the car checking to make sure that Audrey got everyithing. „It's okay dad! Don't worry i have everything.\" While she say that the grandpa came out to check what takes so long. „Okay honey, you see i gotta go. If anything happens call me, okay?\" The granny looked at Audrey's father and rassured him: „Clam down John! She's not ten anymore, she knows how to use a phone, trust me.\" Audrey's dad got back in the car and checked his phone then looked out of the window. „I know. Goodbye honey, i'll see you soon!\" said the father then he left in hurry. „Are you coming or not?\" asked the grandpa who were stood in the house's door fame. Audrey took a deep breath and enterd in the little house, the first thing what Audrey noticed was the smell of the house. There was stale air inside which mixed with perfume. „Can someone open a window ?\" Said Audrey who was irritadet by the smell. „And this gonna be your room!\" The grandma opened the white door which leaded to an old looking bedroom. It was good enought for Audrey's needs, she liked the vitage style of the room anyway. „Okay, ya will arrange your clothes n' other things i suppose…\" Said the granny with a warm smile on her face. „Yeah, sure i'll do that!\" Audrey started to unpack her suitcase not notecing that her grandpa was still standing in the room's door. „Audrey, can you promise me something?\" He said with a firm in his voice. „Of corse, what is it?\" She had no idea what does he wants from her, prahaps he just wants you to go to sleep early or something like that. „Promise that you will not going out of the house after dark?\" As he said those words Audrey raised her eyebrows, why would she go out after dark? Is it something dangerous out there? Whatever she thought in herself Audrey promised that she won't go out after dark. Meanwhile granny set the table for dinner and made the food which was fried sasuge and egg. The smell of the food was wonderful, „Edgar! Audrey! Ya'll can came down and eat!\" Suddenly both of them was already sitting on their chairs. The grandma served the delicious dinner then she also sat down and eat. Audrey loved her grandma's food, it reminded her to her mother who broke up with her father three years ago. It still kind of make her feel sad and dissapointed but her parents gave her everything what she wanted, even though she didn't ask for it. They broke up because her father cheated on her mother twice, and Audrey knows that her father actually went to his girlfriend, Amanda. „So, do ya have a boyfriend?\" asked the granny who watched her grandchild's reaction. „No. And i don't want yet.\" Audrey's answear suprised her grandparents. Audrey finished the dinner fast and went upsters, back in her room. Lying on her bed thinking about her family, she slowly felt asleep.[Chapter 2] „Audrey, wake up! Do you hear me?\" As she opened her eyes Audrey see that her granny sat on the bed's edge. It was morning, Audrey didn't wanted to belive that she sleept trought the night here. She usually has to suffer to get some sleep in new places. „Hi grandma…\" The girl cutted of her word with a big yawn. It looked like her grandmother find it funny, and expressed with a smile. Audrey's room bathed in sunshine which was coming from her windows. „The weather is really good.\" Said the granny and cleaned her glasess with a cloth. Audrey got out from her warm bed and asked her grandma to leave, because she wanted to dress up. Oh, my god i can't belive it that already morning! Man, i was very tired yesterday. While she thought that Audrey took a look at her phone which was placed on the bedside table. Huh, nothing… prehaps dad didn't have time to text me. Nevermind i'll text him first! Grabbing her smart phone she wrote a short message to her father after that she went to the bathroom to take a shower and brush her teeth. Meanwhile Edgar was sitting on the rocking chair outside and tried to forget the well-known urban legend what always made him feel helpless, and that fact his grandchild is here just made him even more nervous. From the nothing he heard a lound shouting which was coming from the house: „EDGAR!\" It was his wife, Edith. She's probabbly need some help with the owen or simply she's just lost her glasess and can't find them. „What is it, woman?\" Asked Edgar who walked in the kitchen. Only the dog was there, when he's turned he saw Audrey standing next to his wife. „what is it?\" Repeated himself the old man. „Audrey wants to help ya with the chickens.\" Said Edith cheerfully. Edgar took a look on his watch, it was 8:04 am then he looked at his grandchild. „Then you better hurry, Audrey!\" The girl smiled and followed her grandpa out side to the chickens. Audrey's dirty blonde long hair was in a ponytail except her bangs which the breeze easily moved right and left. Her grandpa noticed that a few chicken are missing from their cages. „What in the hell?\" Said the old man with a low voice. Audrey take a step closer to see what is her grandfather looking. „What do you see?\" Edgar looked at his grandchild then turned his head in anotherway saying nothing. Audrey helped to feed the little poultry after that they went to the cornfield what was behind the small house. The cornfield was about a tennis court's size. „I don't remeber about that you had a cornfield!\" Wondered Audrey. „Well, we got this a year now. Not much but somethin'.\" Said Edgar who was staring at the sky. He heard stories that a little boy was kidnapped by the monster on the cornfield. „Don't you think that we will need a scarecrow for the field?\" She pointed at the crowns that were eating the corn. „Maybe you're right, but not now. Go back in the house and do something what you like, you've done with helping me.\" The girl gave a nob for answear and hurried back to her room. She grabed her favourite book and sat on her bed's edge, it was a romance story about two strangers who finds love in the night club. Audrey couldn't put down that book, like it was sticked to her hands. But somehow she couldn't help herself, her attention was on the phone. Still nothing, no massage… She thought to herself. It was really strange, usually her father always send her text massage or just simply call her. Audrey decided to call her father, she picked up the phone and just waited to get some answears. Come on, pick it up! Nothing… the sound of the silence suprised Audrey, also hurted her ears. Maybe he's just busy or has some job to do. The room was suddenly filed with disapointment and worry, Audrey's father John would never do something like that. Something was definitely not right and she could feel in her bones. The time was around three a c'lock, Edgar was on his way in the town to buy dog food and sell the eggs on the market. The car was an old blue truck, it was a miracle that vehicle is still working. Driving on the long road ahead he noticed a broken car next to a tree, as Edgar saw it the car's doors were riped off just like the top of it. What the..? The old man stopped with the vehicle and took a closer look, he discovered a mobil phone on the passenger seat, it indicated one missed call from Audrey. Edgar responded immediatley to the possible danger, he ran back to his truck and tried to clam down a little. If this car John's car then it means that he's got attacked by something, something very strong and fast. As Edgar thought about it, he had a strange feeling like something is still out there, he knew that the truck wasn't too safety but better than nothing. His heart started beating faster and faster, he's got a little bit dizzy. The place looked peacefully, only the windy made sound the storm was coming, the old man slowly looked around from his truck. He didn't see anything, but he had to hurry back home to protect his family from the monster which could already on it's way. As he turned on the truck Edgar was on the maximum speed. Meanwhile on the farm Audrey and her grandmother were making the dinner which is cooked corn and beans with chicken. It was a good time for the girl to learn something about cooking. „Ya doin' it right don't worry!\" Said Edith who was watched her grandchild's work getting ready. Audrey didn't responded just nobed a little, while the girl did the cooking the old woman went out to the yard to call in Stan. The weather was very bad, Edith heard the dog's barking but she didin't see it. „Satan! Where are ya?!\" The withe dog came out from the nowhere then both of them went back in the house. Audrey was done with the beans and corn. She looked out of the window seeing that the clouds covered the sun and everything was dark. The granny noticed that Stan doesn't have his dog collar, he's probabbly lost it aout side again. „Good grief! Where's you're collar, Stan?\" Audrey turned and steped closer to the dog. „Audrey, can you get his dog collar?\" She looked at Edith who was annoyed by that lost dog collar. „Of corse, i'll try.\" The girl left the house and started to look for the dog collar. Where could it be? Audrey went back to the cornfield hoping that the dog colar will be there somewhwere. The crowns were flying abound the scarecrow what was the middle of the cornfield, the wind was blowing strongly, Audrey's hair was in her face. She's suddenly notice the red dog collar what she's been looked for. Ha, got it! It was placed on the ground, after that Audrey took that she gave back to Stan who was sleeping in the kitchen. „Thank you Audrey!\" Said the granny. „Anythime!\" The girl continued the book in her room, lying on the cool floor.[Chapter 3] It was raining and the ranging wind whizzed through the little farm where only the house's lights appered in the whole fram. Edgar had some issues with the truck but he's safety arrived back home. „This damm storm!\" He runned as fast as he could to the front door which was locked. Fuck this shit! The old man started to knocking on the door but no one's responded, only Stan barked at the door. „Quiet Stan it's just me.\" Said Edgar standing outside in the strom. I swear to god this dog somethimes Satan himself! Footsteps noise could be heard in the backorund, the oldman's heart beated very fast, it's nearly jumped out of it's place. When he slowly looked back, fourtanetly it was just his wife who seemed worried. „Where the hell are ya been?!\" Shouted the granny. Her glasess were foggy so she cleaned it with her yellow rain coat. „I don't have time for this! Open the door!\" Edith unlocked the door as her husband commanded then both of them steped in the house. It was quiet, too quiet for Edgar who was hurryed upstears to check his grandchild. Adrey was on the floor listening her mp3, but she suddenly got up the floor seeing her grandpa in the door frame. Edgar clamed down that his grandghild is in safe for now… Edith stood behind the old man's back not understanding what's the situation. „What is all this?\" Edgar looked at his wife's shocked face. „What were you doing out there woman?\" Changed the subject the grandpa. Edith explaned that she were out because she heard weird noises what were coming from the chickens. There was a lot of pressure in the room and what made it worse was the silence. Edgar took a deep breath and countinued: „Did some of you notice anything strange since i left?\" Audrey raised her eyebrows then sat on the bed's edge. „Like your creepy scarecrow? No, i don't think so.\" Said the girl with an incredulously voice. The old man opened his eyes as wide as he could do when he heard that. „But… I didn't finished the scarecrow yet…\" After he said the last words the dog downstears started barking loundly. Edgar ran to their room and grabed the shoutgun, Stan was hidding in the livingroom, under the old couch. The old man's hands were shaking, every step he made he almost droped the weapon on the floor. Meanwhile back in Audrey's room the granny sat next to her grandchild and held her hands. Audrey was scared,she didn't understand why is the gun for? Oh gosh, oh gosh… Audrey couldn't think about else right that moment. And the fact that even her grandmother was in shock made it all worse. Suddenly the shoutgun's sharp voice broke the never endig silence in the house. Edith presently passed out hearing that, Audrey heard her grandpa was swearing downstears. The girl quickly left the room to see what happend, Edgar was stood in the front door's frame with the shoutgun in his hands. „It was just a damm fox!\" Said the grandpa with a ragefully voice. Audrey steped a bit closer but Edgar didn't let her in the door, she had no idea how to tell that garnny passed out upstears, so she just simply said how it came out of her mouth: „Where's the medicine? I'll need it…\" The grandpa closed and locked the door then he gave Audrey the whole box what she used to wake Edith up from the coma. It was such a luck that she knew how to wake somebody up from coma, she used the smelling salt which easily woke Edith up. After that Audrey used her medical skills to check her granny's health what was good for now. „Why was the gun for?! Ya can't just shouting around like an idiot!\" Shouted Edith right in her husband's face who was sat next to her. „I-I thought… i don't even know why!\" The old man knew that wasn't the right answear but he also knew that his wife wouldn't belive that if he would said that he wants to protect them from a man-eating monster. Edith was always skeptical about supernatural things, like ghosts or monsters. The strom passed. The time was around mindnight by now, and yet Edgar still clouldn't close his eyes not like Audrey who were sleeping like a baby in her bed not knowing that a thing was looking inside the room through the window. The man looking creature tried to sniffing around the cool air hoping that he'll can find the girl's smell. It was all in vain because it wasn't enought for the creature to decide if she has something useful inside her what he will can use or she's just another useless piece of meat.[Chapter 4] Sleeping in the warm bed, Audrey woke up suddenly from a horrible nightmare. She was sweating in the bed room what turned into a boiler room, she needed some fresh air. As Audrey carefully walked towards the windows hoping that she won't fall on the floor in the dark she completely opened the windows. „Oh, finally! Some cool air.\" Of course as the air came in that also went out, straight to the creature which was silently waiting the top of the roof. Yuck, i'm literally stinking! Better if i take a shower! I hope granny won't mind it… Audrey left the room with the windows open and went through the hallway. She needed to be very quiet because the wood floor crackled every step that she made. Fuck this place… When she steped in the bathroom Audrey closed the door behind her and turned on the lights. In the whole place only the shower's low noise broke the silence. The girl still couldn't forget her father who didn't give her any feedback, it made her worry about her dad but Audrey planed to ask in the morning about him. Prehaps her grandparents knows something, that what she hoped at least. As she got out under the shower the girl dressed up back in her pyjamas and went back to her bedroom. While Audrey walked back on the hallway she stoped right next to the white door, the girl heard really heavy footsteps what's came from her room. Maybe, it's just grandpa… Audrey was tired from the day, she had no time for imaginary burglars what's come at night and robs you out, the last time when she belived in them she was 12 years old. Audrey finally opened the dark room's door and steped in, there was no one. See? There's nothing that i have to afraid of. Audrey noticed that some of her clothes were on the ground scattered all over the place. She wanted to look them closer not beliveing her eyes when from the nothing a drop of liquid dripped on her left shoulder. Audrey's attention suddenly was on the ceiling where was a big shadow figure watching her with it's piercing eyes. In a quick moment one point to another the thing grabed her from the back before she could scream, but Audrey was frozen from the fear. The man looking creature started to sniffing loundly around the girl, the only thing that he noticed was her warm tears which droped on the his hand. It wasn't the first time that one of his victims started to cry in their fear. Audrey tried to pull herself together then she's tried to move her legs prehaps the monster was pretty strong enought to keep her in one place, but it was all in vain. Suddenly she found herself trowed in the corner of the room, she also hit her head. The man looking creature disappered, even though he left scars on Audrey's neck with his razor sharp claws. „Audrey?\" She heard her grandfather's voice what came from behing the white door. As Edgar steped in the cool dark room where his grandchild was in the corner with a bloody neck he quickly hurried to her. Audrey was still in shock, that thing trowed her from force in the corner and she couldn't speak. The grandpa decided to call the hospital for an ambulance, after that everything got darker for the girl. Wait? Where am i?... The girl looked around in the room with her brown eyes, she was laying in a bed when she noticed a nurse who's been sitting on the bed's edge. „Morning sunshine\" The nurse looked at Audrey's wall white skin which usually not like this. The girl tried to say any word but like something blocked it. „Do you remeber how did you passed out?\" Asked the nurse curiously. When Audrey finally could say something suddenly her grandmother steped in the room. The nurse stood up and told Edith that Audrey can go home by now, also the nurse left the room to give the report to the doctors. The granny brought her grandchild's clothes to dress up. „Audrey, how are ya?\" As she got dressed Edith countinued with a worring voice: „Thank god that you're awake after two days! It seemed forever\" When Audrey heard the last words she almost fell off the bed. „TWO DAYS?!\" Edith made her sit down before she pass out again. Meanwhile back in the blue truck what was standed in the hospital's parking lot, Edgar listened the radio which mediated top local news. „Today two adult and one teenage boy mysteriously disappered from their home, the police said they do their best to find them an bring back to their family. Also, a few days ago a woman found a trashed car next to a tree which was riped of the top an…\" Edgar turned off the radio like it was somekind of light switch. He couldn't even listening all of this, knowing the truth behind of the missing people… But it was all in vain, no one belived in the monster which kidnaps those people who he choosed. After all those horobble things what happened here, Edgar could understand the people why are they don't belive in it. „EDGAR! Open the door will ya?\" Shouted Edith with Audrey on her side.[Chapter 5] As granny and Audrey got in the truck Edgar turned on the the old vehicle. All thoughts that the girl chaised in her head were not understandable, did she just halucinated ont hat night? If so then why does she have scars on her neck? Howsoever Audrey needed to talk with her father as soon as possible. „Uh, granny do you know what's with dad? He doesn't answear my calls and texts.\" Instead of Edith the old man answearded the question: „He's phone crushed, but he knows that you was in the hospital.\" Edgar had to lie about John who's probabbly dead by now, but one thing promised to himself the old man: he'll won't sleep peacefully until that monster is alive. That thing will pay for that! Edgar clenched his fist on the car wheel. „What's the matter?\" Granny looked at Edgar who was suddenly changed the subject. „When we arrive back home you'll have to change the bandage on your neck, Audrey.\" The girl took a look at the bandage which was already bloody again. Edith had a bad feeling about her husband who's been acting strange lately. Driving on the long road, for a moment Edgar rubbed his eyes when Audrey and Edith shouted at the same time: „WHATCH OUT!\" The grandpa responded quickly but he nearly hit the guy who was ran infront of the truck. The vehicle was spinding around like a toy car on the road, when it stoped granny got out of the car and walked towards the guy who looked like he's been hurt. „WHAT DA HELL ARE YA DOIN'? YA ALMOST KILLED US!\" The young man was in the same age as Audrey, he's clothes were dirty and a little bloody. On his face there was a fresh cut right under his right eye which was bleeding a little. „I-i n-need h-help, p-please!\" Edgar jogged to the guy to see what's the problem. „Hey, hey clam dowm. Who are you and what do you want?\" The boy tried to say something undersandable but he's stammering just made it more unclear. „C-call t-the c-cops! P-please!\" Edith left them and went back to the truck to get Edgar's phone. She looked everyhere in the car but she didn't found it. „Damm it! EDGAR! WHERE'S DA DAMM PHONE?\" Shouted back to her husband. The old man turned his head and his answear was: „I left at home.\" The whole situacion were confousing. But they decided to take the boy with them home, Edgar couldn't just leave here to the monster. After they got back in the vehicle and drove back home Edith leaded the guy in the living room, the young man didn't speak at all since they met with him on the road. Audrey brought him a red blanket to cover him. „What's your name?\" Asked Audrey couriously. The guy didn't responded first but then he looked at Audrey's pretty face. „It's J-Jake… It's nice to meet you.\" The girl smilled a bit. „And… What's your name?\" Asked Jake who covered himself with the cover. „I'm Audrey Nelson, it's nice meet you too.\" While saying that Audrey healed his scars with an alcoholic liquid which burned Jake's scars. Meanwhile Edgar tried to call the police in the kitchen but it didn't worked, his phone was dead of course the old man wasn't supised why. His phone was a very old model it was a miracle if he could use without any problem. Edith brought Jake a hot tea to keep him warm because his body was like an iceberg even though it was summer. Audrey was sitting opposite the Jake who was drank his tea. „So, what happend?\" Jake suddenly raised his head to the girl's question. „I-i don't remember…\" The grandpa came out of the kitchen to check what's with their guest, he crossed his arms on his chest. „Alright, looks like you're gonna stay with us for a few days!\" The guy didn't say anything, beshides of Stan everyone was in silence. „Don't you have a family or somethin' who we can call?\" Jake shaked his head and reapited the same what he told Audrey earlier. The old couple agreed that Jake can stay if he'll help around the house. In the meantime Audrey went back in her room searching for answears. The windows were still open since that night, she took a look at them and she noticed a few claw looking marks on the ledge. What are these? What the heck is going on here? While Audrey thought that a very strong noise heard in the backgorund, it was like a huge bird flew away. She leaned out of the window hoping that she'll notice something, it was useless there was nothing on the blue clear sky. The day went off, the family and the guest were having a light dinner, Edgar were telling Jake the urban legend. „…And if it lose an eye, it has to eat an eye or if it's lose a leg it has to eat a leg and so on.\" Edith was in disgust hearing that just like Audrey. „Edgar, for god's sake stop talkin' and eat will ya?\" The old man rolled his eyes but didn't said anything for that and Jake did the same. „Damm it! I left my denim shirt on the cornfield!\" Whitout any word Audrey went out to get his shirt, the sunset was beautyful it lighted the little house what made the place very cozy. The shirt was left on a wood box which was facing the field. However the girl was not alone, the man looking creature was watching her from the house's roof. He doesn't needed any part of Audrey even her smell somewho always attracts him back. It was the very first time since he's living that he's hesitates with something, but he wanted to take and end her very fast without any pain. When Audrey take the shirt a balck leather wallet fell out of it's pocket. Huh? The black wallet was so familliar for the girl it looked like exactly the same like his father's. In the backorund Jakes voice could be heard: „What's takes so long?\" She quickly put the wallet back in the pocket when a big shadow appered behind her back. She turned as fast as possible when the thing grabed Audrey's leg and started to run while he's dragged her behind him. Jake ran back to Edgar who was already satnding in the door frame, they only heard Audrey's screaming which was got lower and lower until they didn't heard anything. The creature flew away with the girl on his side. The world got dark for Edgar who was kneeled on the ground, it was all so surreal…[Chapter 6] It was just like a hurricane for Edgar what happened yesterday, he feelt hollowed and empty. How could he let that happen? He drank over four bottles of beer, some of the bottles were scattered all over the little wooden chair what he sat on in the pub. It's all just a bad dream! He thought while he's drinking, Edgar was half drunk but it was enought to fell of the chair when from the nothing Edith showed up in the pub's door. „EDGAR! I knew it ya'll be here. Came home already!\" The whole pub was wathing the old couple's little bickering. Just like Edgar, Edith feelt the same for Audrey but she couldn't let her husband go drunk and let him lose his sanity. She garbed him and put the old man in the truck what stood in front of the pub. „I can't drive! I'm drunk…\" Said Edgar. The old woman got in the car next to her husban and turned on the vehicle not caring what he said. In the dimmish cave looking place what's the creature called his home, he's been sharpened his daggers to the work what he planed to do. Even though he didn't needed any part of the girl her smell divert his attention and it made way harder to focus on the hunt. Howsoever the creature had to kill the girl. One of the place's darker corner where Audrey was pass out from the shock, her hands and legs were tied up so she couldn't move. The sweet dream that she's had about her family quickly gotten blown away as she feelt the slowly flowing blood dripping on her grey shirt. As she finally opened her eyes from the coma the first thing she noticed was that cold looking blue eyes which looked into hers. The man looking creature pulled back Audrey's blonde hair what was wet from the sweating, with his another hand what he was holding the dagger with, he rised the knife right next to Audrey's chin ready to cut her troath. The monster wanted to give her a quick death, he thought she deserves one. Audrey put herself together and all with her last power she had tried to speak. „…P..lease…\" In the backgorund a very odd and music could be heared with a weak shound: …Jeepers Creepers where'da ya get those peepers? Jeepers Creepers where'da ya get those eyes? Hearing that the creature put down the dagger and left the girl. As Audrey took a look around she saw a few old vintage stuff but she needed to make a plan to escape. C'mon girl, think! Think, how should i get out from this hell hole? Audrey tried to stand up when she heard heavy foot steaps. Oh, fuck! It was the monster, but this time he didn't brought his pointy dagger. He's got closer to the girl when suddenly Audrey feelt something cool and wet around her neck. Audrey was supruised when she realized the fact that the monster cleaned the blood off from her neck with a white cloth. Why is he doing this? The creature decided to keep her instead of end of her life, he feelt very weird about the human but it didn't mean that he'll let her free. After that the man looking creature put a bandage on her neck before she bleeds to death then he left the place. For a few minuets the girl still tried to stand up what was very difficult because of the ropes what keept her in one place. I need something sharp to cut these off… All the pain that Audrey feelt in her legs when she stood up was just the beginig of the suffering from the tight ropes. With all her energy she jumped as far as she could from the corner to reach what she needed, in the end of the little hall way there was a bar table what made of wood with a chair, on the walls there were demonic symbols about eating people and cutting them up. Audrey's stomach were strongly churned when she discovered an eyeless man pinned on the wall, and if it wasn't enought there were many of other dead people's corpse what were pinned up too. She nearly passed out again knowing that prehaps she'll pinned up too, Audrey took out one of the creature's dagger from a fresh courpse and quickly cut off the old ropes from her hands. YES, finally! She also made her legs free and then the girl hid in her pocket the dagger, maybe it will be useful later for her. Okay, now… i just have to find the way out! For the first thought it didn't seem to hard but it was actually a challange for Audrey who were thirsty and nearly fell of her legs. Meanwhile, after so many tries the girl gave up. Even though she discovered a whole which could be the key for her freedoom but it was all in vain, the whole was led upwards. And if she wanted to escape she would needed wings or a hiking kit to leave this hell hole behind. I will die here… That was the last thought before she went back and hoped that the monster won't came back soon. Later the creature flew back home with another prey on his side, the man that he caught was around 30-31 years old. He quickly grabbed the bearly alive man and trowed him in that place where he's torure his victims, but the monster needed to check on the human girl before he does anything. The rage suddenly filled him when he noticed the rope pieces what were left on the ground. Audrey was hinding behind the bar table hoping the best, she knew that was a dumb idea but at least she had one of the monster's daggers. Audrey had nothing to lose anyway… The creature started to loundly sniffing around the table when from the nothing the girl's bladed hand crushed from behind the wooden table. In that moment the thing suddenly caught Audrey's hand before it could reach his face, the raging anger that he feelt nearly burned him up.After that he didn't kill her now she tries to attack him? Those thoughts were mixed in his head like a swirl. When the creature decided to tie her to the wall with a rusty chain, now she cloud clearly see what would happen with her if she tries with this again. The man looking creature nice and slowly walked back to the bearly alive man who was pale as the moon on a night sky. Audrey saw that the creature pulled out on of his knifes and started to cut the man's stomach up with it, the screaming could be heard in the whole place. It looked like the monster enjoyed listening it, for a moment he turned his head into Audrey's way and smiled once. Audrey's eyes drowned in tears seeing that the man being eaten alive. The table where in blood, when finally the monster sewed the man's stomach, the man's attention was on Audrey who couldn't watching all of this horroifying view. „GOD DAMM IT JUST KILL HIM ALREADY!\" Shouted the girl with all her voice. The creature immeditaley stoped with the sewing, he raised his head then looked back to the dying man while the blood's salty smell permeated the place. He grabbed the man's head and broke his neck, then he grabbed the corpse by it's leg and trowed in the nearest corner. Audrey was mentally tortured by seeing all this. Maybe a few minuets the creature watched the girl but after that he left her there. Why is he doing this with me?...[Chapter 7] It was a week since Audrey got kidnapped by the strange creature, her wounds hardly but fully healed on her neck. The creature seemed being less violence with the girl since he chainded to the wall and showed her how does he do his job on bearly alive people. Audrey's right had was tired from the heavy chains what keept her in one place. In the backgorund the same odd music's sound could be heard: Jeepers Creepers where'da ya get those peepers? Jeepers Creepers where'da ya get those eyes? It was from the old phonograph. This music again. Huh, this thing will never get tried listening of it! I always hope that i won't be the next who's get pinned on the wall as a wax figure. Just like a thropy… She knew when she hears this music that means: he does his work with the dead bodies, waxing them. Audrey's stomach was hurted like a hundred little sharp glass peices was stabed inside her. She didn't eat anything since she's got kidnapped. The only thing what she could think on was her father. I wonder if he knows that i'm here… It was very difficult for her to be tough while these thoughts were runing on her mind like a conflagration. Her body was weak, you could easily see Audrey's ribs through her dirty grey shirt. Even she wasn't that very skinny type of girl but also she wasn't that very chubby type either. However she was starving. Ha, he's trying to starving me to death. Great! I'll die slowly and painfull… Meanwhile the man looking creature finished yet another „thropy\" of his. He noticed that his little prisoner was like an undead, pale and almost lifeless. As he got close to the girl she twitched her head and her heart started to beating very fast what he could clearly see. Prehaps it was all strange but he liked the way how she was afarid of him. Audrey didn't even wanted to watch into his cold eyes. Suddenly she feelt a poke on her shouder, as she turned her head in the creature's way she suprised about what she saw. There was a fish can in his hand, Audrey was incerebly hungry so she grabbed the can. „Thank you…\" As her words left the girl's mouth the man looking creature nobed once hearg that. She never talked to the monster, but it looked like he understands the human language. Back in the girl's grandparent's farm, Edgar has done with his plan what was about to get revenge on the demon which took his grandchild away. Edith was still mourned Audrey's death, she couldn't even think about it all what happend. She was in the girl's room all day and prayed to god for Audrey's soul. The old man didn't care about his wife, he didn't care about anything. He just wanted to see that monster as dead. Edgar put all his suplises in one big military backpack and he also cleaned his shout gun to be ready for the hunt. A cracklyng noise could be heard from the hall way. Now who's in the world is that? He was ready to fire with the gun but before he could do that a familiar face jumped out of the nowhere. „DONT SHOT! It's just me, sir.\" Edgar looked at the boy from last week, who they saved on the road. „Should i call the cops or can i shot you down? Why are you here, boy?\" Jake steped closer with a mysterious look. „I just wanted to say i'm sorry about what happend with Audrey, sir.\" Edgar acted like he didn't heard anything and keept doing his stuff with the suplices, Jake noticed a lots of ammo stuffed in a bag and medicin. He raised his eyebrows: „Are you… Are you going on a hunt?\" The old man wasn't sure about if he can share his plan with Jake who probabbly never used a gun before. „Look kid, i have no time for playing around like a 4 years old!\" Said Edgar loundly then he countinued with a lower voice: „If you wanna thank the help what my family gave you, then listen up!\" He told everything about the what he's planing to do, Jake just listened the old man's voice like a little child. „…So, are you in?\" Asked Edgar couriously. Jake's face only just a smile left with a nob what was the answear: yes. Sitting on the cold dusty ground without any hope, Audrey looked up on the man looking creature who's been watching her a while. After she ate the fish from the can that she got from him, he's attention was on her. It was a good time to take a closer look from the creature. Cold blue eyes, bottle green skin which was little scaly on some of his parts, grey curly hair thing grew out of the back of his head and some strange looking tusk-like parts on his face. And his wings… those huge leater wings what was placed on his back just amazed Audrey who only just dreamed about flying. „..Do you like flying?\" Said the girl with a low voice. It was a very silly question from her but she needed to break the silence. The creature stood up from his place and spread his wings to show it for the girl, his wings were double as big as Audrey saw them last time. „Wow..\" The man looking creature smiled a little when he heard that. „Can…can you get off this chain of my heand? Please?\" The little smile suddenly disapered from his face and he closed his wings back. He took a few steps closer to the human. „I promise i won't try to escape!\" The next thing what happened was increable for Audrey. The sound of the rusty chains when they hit the ground was everything what she wanted. Yes! Finally. The chains left some marks on her wrist but it didn't bother the girl who feelt wonderful to be free after a week. While Audrey enjoyed her little free time, the creature watched her with a weird feeling inside of him. It was like something got on fire in his stomach. „Thank you\" Said Audrey. Even she was free, every step that she took the creature watched closely and if it wasn't enought he followed the girl everyhere. Suddenly she noticed that leather wallet on the bar desk, as she grabbed and opened that she discovere's her dad's picture about her family. What the hell? This is dad's wallet, why does Jake keept this? When it all looked all random at frist every puzzle peices got in theri place and showed a big picture what she would never noticed if she wouldn't found the wallet. No, that cannot be… how? Could it be that Jake killed dad on the road and acted like if he's been attacked? Audrey broke in tears when she started playing with the thoughts. The man looking creature put his hands on her shoulders when Audrey turned all into a hug. Edgar and Jake were on their way in the truck which was armed like a thank. „Do you know boy where's that old factory?\" Asked the old man. Jake grimmed once and told him what he knows: „It's an end of this road you'll see!\" Edgar looked at the young man. „How can you be that sure that the demon will be there?\" Hearing the last words of Edgar Jake soft voice suddenly turned into an angry one: „Just…trust me. I heard some legends about the siblings, that the brother been killed there.\" From the nothing Stan started barking loundly. „Shut up Satan!\" Commanded the old man. Jake seemed courious heari ng that. „Satan?\" „My wife calles him Satan\" Answeared Edgar. „I see..\" In the dark night they found the old building what they looked for, Edgar was filled with adrelalin when he got out of the car with Jake. They entered the place's old rusty iron door then walked deep into the total darkess. Somehow Edgar found a deep gap plucked into the ground, the young man nearly fell in the large hole. „Damm! That's one deep gap!\" Said Jake. Before Edgar could anwsear that he suddenly found himself falling into the gap where at the end, he suvived with a broken shoulder and a half broken leg. „FUCK!\" It hurted him like nothing before, and what made it worse that was the sight: dead people's corpse everyhere pined on the walls. The creature broke the embrace with Audrey who's face was red like a tomato in her emberresment. „Sorry… i didn't meant tha-„ Before she could finish her words the creature shuted her mouth with his hands. He started sniffing loundly around the air when he found something diffrent. When the old man finally arrived where the creature and Audrey stood, he pulled out his gun. „Haha! I've got you now!\" Edgar was shocked when saw Audrey alive. „Audrey! Go, RUN! Run before he kill you!\" He shouted as he could. The girl knew if she would start runing the monster would kill them both, and she promised him that she won't try to escape. „Come on! It killed John! Do you hear me?!\" Audrey took a step next to the creature who was in rage. „No… i'm sorry\" In a moment the old man pulled the trigger of the gun which was in his grandaugther's way but before it could reach her the man looking creature blocked it with himself. In another moment Edgar found himself stabed in the chest. The blood splited everywhere in the place, he's last moments was looking at Audrey with a his eyes. The girl didn't seemed to bothering her grandpa's death after losing her father she's just wanted answears. After that the Creeper walked back to the girl when from the nothing Jake's arms grabbed her neck around ready to kill her. „What'ya gonna do now, huh?\" Maybe Jake feelt the taste of wining in his mouth but Audrey made sure that it won't be a jackpot. She kicked Jake in the nuts and grabbed an old pipe then slashed his head with it a few times until he's blood splited out. Jake was laying on the grount waiting for Audrey to finish him, the girl threw away the iron pipe and looked in Jake's black soulless eyes. „Start speaking! What did you do with my father!\" Jake grimmed as he heard Audrey's claiming. „Ha! What do you mean?\" He took a lightly breath. „Yes, i finished with him but he was already dying! I just wanted to kill him beacuse i couldn't watch him suffering…\" The girl's eyes drowed in tears. „What if you're lying?! How do i know if you telling the truth?!\" Her feelings filled the her words as she spoke them. „Not i'm the one who's taking the demon's side, ya know…\" She turned her head into the Creeper's way who was watching and listening the converstation, It was all madness. Were she in love with the creature? In one moment Audrey heard a gun's sharp shound behind her in another moment she found herself in the Creeper's arms. Audrey were literally bathed in her own blood. Everything got darker and darker when the last thing that she heard was that old song from the phonograph. …Jeepers Creeper where'd ya get those peepers? Jeepers Creepers where'da ya get those eyes? Thanks for reading! Also sorry for my litreture, i used google translate some words. I know that made hard to read it (or understand it) But i hope you like the story. ","Summary":" The weater was hotter than it used to be and what made it worse was: the car's broken air-condition"},{"Movie":"Remember the Titans","Title":"Black and White","Author":"4ne1","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13162527","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Disclaimer : I do not own anything from Remember the Titans. Author's Note : Another Coach Yoast's daughter fanfic. I really love those here and I don't mind them. In reality, the actual Bill Yoast had 4 daughters including Sheryl. This is about my OC, Angela Yoast, in a romantic story with Julius Campbell. A story about an interracial relationship in the early 70s. I just thought it'd be interesting, and hopefully, something different. Please read and review! In the year of 1971, at Alexandria, Virginia. My father is the Head Coach for my school's football team. He's really great at his job. In fact, he's been nominated to the Virginia High School Hall of Fame. My little sister, Sheryl, is at his side being his little helper. She knows more about football than I do. I can't say I'm a sports fanatic like them, but I give every ounce of my support to Daddy, the coaching staff, and to the rest of the team. As for me...well, there's nothing special about myself, really. I'm just an ordinary girl living in Virginia. I'm not on any sports and I'm definitely not on the cheerleading squad. That's for sure. I'm simply living my life as a sixteen year old in eleventh grade at Hammond High School. I support Daddy and even go to a couple of his games. Sometimes. I don't get that enthusiastic about it like Sheryl does and I have very limited knowledge of it. That girl sure is a spitfire. I do have that sassy attitude as well, but only if you get on my nerves. So it'd be wise for your well being to stay on my good side. My parents are divorced. I had the choice to either live with Daddy or Mama. I chose my Daddy because I can't stand living with my other two sisters, Rachel and Lucy. They also have their own lives. Now, Rachel is twenty four and engaged to her high school sweetheart. Lucy is twenty and she works as a waitress for now. I also don't approve of my mother, Judith, remarrying another man. His name is Paul and I absolutely refuse to have him as a step-father. So, that leaves me to go to my father. Despite that we hardly have anything in common, but it beats being homeless. Everything was going great for the four of us. Until the school board forced us to integrate. White and black people are mixed together into one school. It's called T.C. Williams. Not everyone is happy about that. My father raised me and my sisters to not be prejudiced so I see no problem. I mean, truthfully, it was kind of weird and different at first. Something to get used to. But everyone is still human. No matter what color. Right? I wanted to be friendly and get to know them. But my friends wouldn't let me because the colored people probably have friends of their own and won't want to associate with us white folks. I went along with my friends figuring they might be right. It's like most people don't want us to get along. The tension was thick in the air, not even a knife could slice it. I guess I could understand them not befriending us. A white store owner did shoot a black kid this summer. That increased more division and hatred between the races. The team was worried about losing their starting positions. I don't see how they can be replaced when they're some great players out there. For instance, Gerry Bertier is one of Daddy's favorite players. We can't lose him that's for sure. Not only was he Daddy's favorite, he is also my ex-boyfriend. We've dated for a year and broke up last summer. It was hard to date me because I'm the Coach's daughter and any guy who is on the team is off limits for me. Daddy worked Gerry twice as hard during practices and was extra tough on him during the games. Not only was it my father being in the way, but our relationship wasn't working out well for each other. I became distant and focus more on my school work and Gerry was into other girls. That's when we had to call it off and there were no hard feelings. It was mutual and we're still friends to this day. But it's still hard to attend at my Daddy's practices anymore because I see Gerry. My ex is a constant reminder and I can't see him there when I know he's with someone else. It just hurts to much. Gerry is currently dating Emma Hoyt. And I'm still single. Of course Gerry would be able to find someone new in no time. I mean, look at him. He's handsome, the linebacker, and the captain. Emma is pretty and all, but I don't think she likes me. I'm fine with that cause I don't like her either. As if it's possible for the old girlfriend to get along with the new girlfriend. Daddy, Sheryl, and I had to move elsewhere because of the negro, Herman Boone, would replace his job as being the new Head Coach at T.C. Williams. Sheryl was furious and I wasn't too happy at the news either. I didn't expect us to move and I don't want to. Also, Daddy would lose his coaching job. This was supposed to be his Hall of Fame year. He has definitely earned that title. Now Daddy has been interviewing head coaching jobs lately, and according to Sheryl, he's gotten some offers. The doorbell rang just as I was about to go hangout with my friends. I open the door as I pull my jacket on, and to my surprise, it was a negro man. \"Um...May I help you?\" I asked unsurely. \"Is Coach Yoast here?\" He requested. \"Yeah, um...what is your name?\" \"Herman Boone.\" He answered and seems to be very serious. This must be the same negro man that Sheryl talked about who was going to take my father's Head Coach job. Just seeing him standing at the door makes my blood boil, but I try to be nice and polite. \"Let me go get him.\" I said and went to let my father know that he has company. They go to his office and he let me be on my way out to my friends. I drove to Michelle's house and it wasn't that far, but not a walking distance neither. \"So, Angela, do you know if there are any single guys on the football team?\" Lydia asked grinning and Michelle wants the gossip, too. The three of us were in Michelle's bedroom eating popcorn while her TV was on playing some show. \"I don't know all the guys that much,\" I answered honestly. \"Except for Ray and Alan. They're single.\" \"We all know that.\" Michelle said, tucking a strand of her brown hair behind her ear. Lydia and I are both blondes, but Michelle is the only brunette. \"Alan is pretty cute...\" Lydia said thoughtfully. \"Are you actually considering to date Alan?\" I wondered with an eyebrow raised. \"What? No. I'm just thinking about it,\" She replied in her defense. \"What about you? I would have jumped at the chance to date any of the cute guys on the team.\" \"You know I've dated Gerry and how we fell apart. I don't think I can do that again,\" I shake my head. \"And I don't think my father would let me to anyway because of what happened.\" \"Sure you can,\" Lydia encouraged. \"You don't always have to worry about what your old man thinks.\" \"I would think it'd be worse if you dated a colored man.\" Michelle said. \"I don't know if I would do that...\" I said. I don't think I would be interested in any of those...type of men romantically. That would cause a rift for sure even if my father could be okay with it. I'm a white girl and if I dated a black guy, that means all hell would break loose. That cannot happen. \"Yeah, I don't think I would ever date any of them either.\" Michelle said and acted as if she was disgusted by the thought. The three of us kept talking and gossiping. We weren't doing anything grand tonight, but only going out to the movies and get pizza later. A few weeks later, I got information that my father got a Head Coaching job at Loudon High. Not everyone from the team was happy about him moving. They really love him and some even saw him as a their own father figure. Reminds me of how I am with Sheryl. She's definitely a Daddy's girl. She's with him at every single games and practices. I just get there when I can and feel like it. Sheryl is a lot closer to him than Mama. I can't say I blame her for that. I'm like a mother figure for Sheryl, and yes, we do act like sisters where we fight, teach other, and all that fun stuff. I realize that I'm living with her, she needs me more because of how Mama isn't around mostly. Only on the weekends and when it's her week. The poor child is being tossed back and forth to her one parent and to the other. She needs someone stable and constant in her life. Might as well be me. When it's time for training camp, I'm with Sheryl to see our father off along with the other families seeing their sons and husbands off. Even the families are separated by color. The white families stood on the left and the black on the right. We just keep things to ourselves, but deep down, I know this isn't how it should be. The men are dressed fashionable suits and ties you'd think they're going to church or something. Not to go to football camp. But that is what Herman Boone required of them for their dress code. Sheryl told me good news that Daddy is still on the coaching staff. He's the assistant coach. However, Sheryl doesn't see it as it being good news like I do. She thinks he should still be the Head Coach, and so do I, but it's better than nothing. We hug our father before he went to the staff. \"I want you to look after for your sister while I'm gone, okay?\" He told me. \"The both of you can still come down and drop by.\" \"Okay, Daddy,\" I said. \"I can take care of myself.\" Sheryl replied with confidence. \"Not alone you can't,\" He said sternly. \"I trust the both of you that you won't burn the house down. Call your mother if it's necessary.\" \"She's too busy with Paul to be bothered with us...\" I mumbled, but I really didn't mean to. My stupid mouth just let the words slip out. \"Angela...\" He uses the same stern voice with me. \"Judy is still your mother and you still must respect and honor her. She still loves you and your sister more than anything.\" I clamped my mouth to not speak of any doubts. If she truly did love us, then why did my parents have to divorce and split the family and ruin us? \"I should go,\" He glanced back at the others. \"The boys are getting on their buses.\" While I was talking to Sheryl, I felt someone bump into me. My eyes narrow down to whoever the clumsy person was, but when I saw him, it was one of the black colored boys. I didn't glare at him anymore when I realized who it was, but I still expect an apology. He looked like he made a big mistake as if it was a crime for him to touch a white girl. \"Sorry.\" He quickly apologized. \"You should be.\" I retorted. \"I hear you two girls are Coach Yoast's daughters, ain't you?\" \"You've heard correctly.\" Sheryl answered. \"My name is Angela and this is my little sister, Sheryl.\" \"Nice to meet the both of you. I'm Julius Campbell.\" \"That's a strange name.\" My little sister commented, her nose scrunched up. \"Sheryl!\" I harshly gritted to her with a glare at her. \"It's okay.\" He chuckled. \"It's not every day you can meet a Julius.\" I said to him. Where is that coming from? I'm so not flirting with him. I did worse flirting when I first tried to get with Gerry by acting as if I knew everything about football. It is true that Julius is an uncommon name, but that is what I really meant. No secret undertones of anything else going on. But I have to admit that this Julius does look cute. He looks like has a nice, strong, and muscular body... Wait? What? No. What am I even thinking? \"I guess not,\" He even smiled a little. \"I'll see you ladies around.\" Julius went to go say goodbye to his family. He has both sets of parents and a sister it seems. I need to stop having these sudden thoughts and feelings about Julius. What happened really was nothing.[Chapter 2] While Sheryl and I were talking, I can't help, but to give secret glances toward Julius. \"Hopefully these new guys are good at football like they think they are. We might have a chance at winning the championships which will give Daddy his Hall of Fame trophy.\" Sheryl went on her football rant. \"Don't you have anything else to talk about besides football?\" I was bored with this topic already. \"You're a girl and you can't talk about anything else?\" Sheryl glares at me. \"You know I hate girly stuff like dolls and make up. You want me to be like every other girl?\" I sighed. \"Not like every other girl, but it wouldn't hurt to not always talk about football twenty four seven.\" \"What would you talk about instead? I'm sure Daddy would love to know that you're gawkin' at one of his team players,\" Then she added with an evil smirk of hers. \"Again.\" \"I was not gawking at him!\" I snapped and before we can argue back and forth, we all hear Coach Herman Boone's voice to the crowd. \"Ladies and gentlemen, I got an announcement to make,\" He got all of our attention and I can say I am very confused. Gerry and Ray were with him and I wonder what they have done that we had to listen to Coach Coone. \"We got Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin going to camp with us here this year. Jerry tells the jokes, Dean sings the songs and gets the girl. Let's give them a round of applause.\" He slow clapped for them and was the only one who's clapping. Sheryl and I looked at each other and we didn't know what to think of that. I'm sure it had to do with Gerry and Ray saying something stupid in order to cause a scene like that. The rest of slowly talked back in low voices while Gerry and Ray talks to Coach Coone. Oh, pardon me. Coach Boone. I have to correct myself on that. I still don't like that he replaced my Daddy as the Head Coach, but what can I do about it? I'm starting to act like Gerry now. Great. The boys were getting on the bus and they were dividing themselves. The white boys were sitting on one bus while the black boys sat at the other bus all together. If they plan on working together as a team, then this wasn't going to work out. Even I can see that. I'm surprised Gerry is acting this way. Since he's the captain and supposed to be a good role model for his team members. It's one of the things that was frustrating about him. His pride. It took every ounce in me to not go straight up to Gerry and tell him off to be a better man. However, I'm not his mother. And I'm his ex so it's not like he's going to listen to me anyway. I stood at my place beside Sheryl. Thankfully, Coach Coone - uh, I mean, Coach Boonefinally did something about it. He let everyone to get off their bus and gave them a strict lecture. \"Listen up, I don't care if you're black, green, blue, white, or orange, I want all of my defensive players on this side, all players going out for offense over here. Right now.\" He was telling everyone to keep moving since the guys were going as slow as slugs. \"You and you, offensive bus,\" He paired these two white and black guys together. \"You and you, defensive bus.\" Oh, god. He paired Gerry with Julius. That would definitely not go over well. They look like they already want to murder each other. I just want to go over to Gerry and comfort him about it and tell him that everything would be okay as long as he listens and do what his coach says. But I can't be that person for him right now. \"Sit together. You and you, defensive bus. Sit together. Get comfortable, too, because the person that I have you sitting next to is the same one you'll be rooming with for the duration of this camp.\" Boone said after he paired everyone together and they're going to their own appropriate defensive and offensive buses. I can only imagine what would go on in there. Probably just stony silence. Eventually, all the staff got on the buses and once everybody was on, they all left for the college. Sheryl and I walked to my car and I saw Mrs. Jean Bertier. I haven't seen her since I was with Gerry. We're almost close to each other as we're walking in the parking lot, so I decide to be polite and make small talk with her. \"Hello, Mrs. Bertier,\" I said to her nicely as I come up to her side. \"Oh, hello, Angela, and Sheryl,\" She greeted us. \"I haven't seen your face since you've dated Gerry.\" \"It has been a while since the break up.\" \"It did break my boy's heart when you two stopped seeing each other, but maybe it's for the best. He has a proper and beautiful young lady now.\" \"What does that supposed to mean?\" Sheryl asked rudely, but to be honest, I was going to say the same question. \"You are a lovely girl, Angela, but I don't think you were ever his type. He doesn't need someone who spends all her time being so sweaty and hot outside on the field and getting her hands messy in the dirt. Football is never meant for young girls like you and for your young and impressionable little sister. It always surprises me that your father drags you two around with him for games and practices. I always wondered if your poor mother ever had a say. That's not how a lady should act, mind you. Emma is more of a woman with class.\" \"Gerry and I just drifted apart,\" I said trying not to lose my temper because of how badly she talked about me. I even stopped Sheryl from letting her have something to say. I won't even mention that Gerry was already looking and flirting with other girls while he was with me. \"It was nothing against him. The split was mutual. I am happy that he has Emma now if she really makes him happy.\" \"She does.\" \"Also, football is a part of our lives. Sheryl and I would go everywhere with our father because of that. Just because we happen to like football, doesn't make it a bad thing for a woman to like.\" \"Did you expect to have her stay at home to knit and cook?\" Sheryl asked and I glared at her, but of course, she wasn't intimidated by me. \"You should be careful how to speak to your elders, Sheryl.\" Jean said sternly to my little sister. I don't like anyone else besides me or my family telling her what to do, and especially, how to behave. She is right, but I hate that it's coming from her. \"I call it a woman speaking her mind. Nothing wrong with a lil confidence. \" I smirked and so did Sheryl with her arms as if in triumphant that we won this battle. \"Well, it seems that your father should teach you girls manners.\" Jean went into her car and sat in the driver's seat and turns on the ignition. She was driving out of the parking lot like the other families were getting ready to do. \"I would like to give that lady a piece of my mind,\" Sheryl was angry at how Helen not only treated me, but her as well. \"Why didn't you talk back at her?\" \"I can't do that, Sheryl,\" I answered her as were going to my car. \"That's not right. It'll only make things worse. I don't really care that she likes Emma more than me.\" \"But you do.\" Even Sheryl can see the lie through me. \"Doesn't matter. I don't need her approval. Gerry and I are over. She has to move on.\" \"So do you.\" She smirked. I wonder for a brief moment if I was talking about Mrs. Bertier the entire time or myself. I mean, I only talked to her to be nice, not to see that I'm better. I shook that thought away and told Sheryl to get into the car. Sheryl and I stayed at home for a few days. It's the summer now and I don't understand how those boys can be under all that blazing heat. It was still sizzling, but when the weather was under control, that's when I called my father and let him know we're coming over. I drove Sheryl and myself to the college. When we were there, they were all having lunch. The two of us just eaten. We went to greet Daddy and he hugs us. The staff who knows us well said polite hellos and nods acknowledging us. Sheryl sat next to him and Daddy lets me to sit with the guys. I thought about sitting with Gerry and Ray, but maybe that's not a good idea. I think of the awful conversation I had with his mother. Alan was the next best choice. He's like a brother to me, but really, they're all like my brothers. \"Hey, Alan,\" I said to him and he looks up and grins at me. \"Mind if I join you handsome men? And Gerry?\" I teased to my ex. There were lots of \"Ooohs\" going around like immature middle school children. They know about our history and that we've dated. I saw Gerry giving me a glare, but I wasn't scared. \"Sure, Angie,\" Alan said and he and couple of guys moved to make room for me. I sat in between him and Charlie. \"How are you doing?\" \"I'm doin' fine. It's the same old thing. Really gettin' hot out, isn't it? I'm so sweaty even my clothes are stickin' onto me.\" \"We don't have any problem with you removin' your clothes to cool off.\" Brad said being smug and had the nerve to wink at me. I kicked him hard under the table since he was across from me. \"In your dreams, you perv!\" I smirked, wasn't really angry with him. As if he or anyone else is going to get a show. \"Remember that Ange's feisty, Brad.\" Gerry said to him and was looking at my way with amusement. But something about his arrogant face makes me want to slap it off. \"I think you're confusing spunky with feisty, Bertier,\" I remarked. \"How many brain cells have you lost when you got tackled out on the field?\" Some of the guys chuckled while Gerry just shut up and continues to eat his food. I enjoy talking to Alan about anything like his practices. I notice that a large and heavy set guy didn't know where to eat. It wasn't that he's confused, but conflicted. \"Who's he?\" I asked Alan and he looks up at him. \"Louie Lastik.\" \"Maybe you guys should invite him over here.\" I offered. \"It's not like we're in kindergarten, Angela,\" Ray said to me. \"Lastik can sit wherever he wants to. Even with those animals.\" He was speaking about the black men. Most of the other guys around me had that same belief. I glared at them all. \"You guys are jerks!\" I exclaimed and went to help Louis out. \"Hey...Louie, is it?\" I began being friendly. \"Yeah.\" He made a cute smile. \"I'm Angela Yoast.\" \"Coach Yoast's daughter?\" I nodded. \"Cool.\" \"You can sit where I was if you want.\" I gestured to the table where I recently sat. I notice that some of them were paying attention to our conversation, but quickly looked back down to their plates when I saw them. Even Gerry was one of them. \"I was thinkin' about it, but I don't wanna be like the rest of the guys. I mean, we're all a team, aren't we? We should all learn to know each other and tolerate each other at least.\" \"You might be the only one who has a working brain around here,\" I said, completely agreeing with him. \"Do you wanna sit over there with them?\" I gestured to the colored side. \"I can, but what about you? You were over there.\" \"I can sit wherever I want to. Come on. I'll join you.\" Louis and I sat with the other black men without a care in the world. \"What are you two doing here?\" It was Julius Campbell who asked us. \"Eating lunch.\" Louie answered simply. \"Yeah, I crossed my arms. \"Problem?\" Julius' eyes flickered back to me and him. \"I see you eating lunch. But why you eating over here? Why don't you two go on over there and eat with your people?\" \"Our people?\" I scoff feeling a little insulted. \"Man, I don't have any people. I'm with everybody, Julius.\" I think Louie has just become my favorite person. \"Same here.\" \"Why don't you play with dolls or makeup or somethin'? Why are you here with guys?\" I narrowed my eyes at Julius because of the stereotypes he believes I should do. Also, makes me rethink about how I sometimes treat my little sister. \"I don't play with dolls or makeup cause I ain't three. I rather be here than bein' stuck indoors. I am a girl, but I know a thing or two about football. You don't wanna be messin' with me.\" \"Why should I be afraid of a skinny white girl like you?\" He asked. \"I would be careful around her if I were you, Julius,\" Louie told him. \"She is Coach Yoast's daughter.\" I smirked as the other guy's faces were priceless when they made that connection. They know quickly to back off from me and not make a wrong move. Julius already knew that piece of info about me. \"Angela Yoast,\" He remembered. \"Now I know who you are.\" \"You better. Just don't talk that way to me again, Campbell.\" I said sternly. \"Come on, Julius, they're just another blessed children in God's loving family,\" Rev preached. Blue started humming the tunes of Amazing Grace to annoy Julius. \"Come on, Blue, let me-\" Then the humming got louder. I had to laugh at their antics. \"Lord, we come before you today and ask you to soften big Julius Campbell's heart.\" Rev prayed. \"Amen!\" I agreed and I notice that Julius glared at me, but that only made me laugh harder.[Chapter 3] \"Lastik!\" It was Coach Boone's voice asking for him. Louie got up and stood next to him at the front of the room. \"I want you to tell something about one of your black teammates.\" \"Sir, yes, sir!\" Louie yelled. I tried not to laugh with the others. He acts like he's in the army instead of on a football team. \"I'm rooming with Blue, sir, and I notice he wears those leopard-spotted underwears, bikini style, sir!\" \"Oh, really? Bikini style, huh? When can I see that?\" I smirk at Blue while the other guys chuckled. He looks embarrassed and avoids our gazes at him. \"Okay, maybe somebody who's not your roommate.\" Coach Boone challenged. \"Sir, I eat lunch with Rev. That's Jerry Harris, sir! People call him Rev 'cause he's always praying, and he won't abide a foul tongue, sir!\" \"And what is the Rev gonna do after high school?\" \"I don't know. Go to college and all that, I guess.\" We can't hear what Louie and Coach Boone are saying next because they've been talking to each other in low voices. \"So, what kind of music does the Rev like?\" Coach Boone asked louder so all of us can hear. \"Me and Rev both dig on The Temptations.\" Louie answered. \"Oh, yeah?\" Then Louis and Rev started singing some of the verses from Ain't Too Proud to Beg. I was really getting entertained by his energy and dancing. \"I know you want to leave me, but I refuse to let you go! If I got to pray, plead for your sympathy! I don't mind cause you mean that much to me! Ain't too proud to beg!\" He sang, but Boone stopped him while laughing. \"Okay, alright. Stop begging. Anybody else?\" He asked for volunteers as Louie went to his seat. It was a disappointment (but also no surprise) that nobody else got up. No one even tried to get to know each other. \"No volunteers?\" His eyes look around. \"Campbell?\" Julius shook his head and I frown at his behavior. \"Bertier?\" Even Gerry wasn't that all interested. \"No, huh? Each one of you will spend time every day with a teammate of a different race. You will learn about him and his family, his likes, his dislikes. You will report back to me until you meet every one of your teammates. Until that time, we go to -a-day practices. You continue to ignore each other, we'll go to -a-day practices. Now, is there any part of this you don't understand?\" No one has dared to make any objections to it. In my opinion, it was a great plan to make the boys somewhat get along. Our team will be divided if we can't work together as a team. When lunch was all over, everyone filed out of the cafeteria except Daddy calls me back to him and Sheryl. \"I require the same thing of you, Angela. My boys have been like your brothers for years and now it's time I think for you to get to know your new brothers. They'll be your family, too. Like what Coach Boone told them. Know their likes and dislikes and report back to me until you meet every one of them. Got it?\" \"Yes, sir.\" I nodded feeling like how Louie was. \"Good.\" He smile with approval. I didn't know who to talk to at first. I eventually decide to talk to the ones I sat with at lunch. Rev seems the friendliest out of all of them. Him and Louie already seem like best friends which is great and they're probably the only ones. Some of us was casually hanging outside as they get to know their team members. \"My father likes Coach Boone's idea of everyone learning about each other so he wants me to do the same. His boys have been like brothers to me and I want you and the others to be like brothers to me, too. So...what do you say?\" I said to Rev. \"It would be an honor to know you, Miss. Yoast.\" Rev said acting all fancy and I can't help, but giggle. Louie excused himself to go so we can talk in private. \"Your real name is Jerry, but you like to be Rev. Plan to be a preacher or somethin'?\" I asked curiously. \"No, not really, but I do sing for the choir at my church. What about you, girl? Do you sing?\" I felt my cheeks flush red. \"Yes, but not that good...\" \"Oh, come on, Angie. I'm sure your voice is beautiful like an angel,\" I blush harder at the nice compliment. \"What music do you like to listen to?\" \"I like rock music, mostly. Some of your people's music is good, too. What other artists do you like besides The Temptations?\" Gerry never liked the Motown stuff. \"Gospel music. We black folks know how to worship our Lord.\" I laughed because of the way he said it. Next person I was going to know is Dwayne. He doesn't talk much, but one of his talents is that he plays the piano. He dislikes when he has to run a mile. Curtis was more open to me and friendly, too. Roger was serious like how Julius is, but I manage to get some words out of him. All the other guys were nice and others I didn't particularly care for, but there were some other boys I don't like that Daddy coached. Blue was fun getting to hang out. I was introducing him the music I like. He said he needs to relax from the torture he went through from listening to Alan's music. \"He does like country,\" I said to Blue in his dorm. \"Don't get him started on Tom Jones.\" I joke. \"My ears need to recover from listening to his music. It was a cruel and unusual punishment, I tell you.\" \"I ain't no fan of country, but it's not that bad.\" \"It's not just country. What music do you like? Has to be better than his. I don't think I can handle more of Frankie Valli.\" \"Ever heard of Janis Joplin? She's one of my favorite singers.\" We listen to my music which was mostly rock. He enjoys my taste and I'm glad. Then we talked movies and TV shows we both like and dislike. So far, Blue and Rev are my favorite. Petey was cool and sweet, too. Also funny. He has a girlfriend and she's Claire. The picture of her he shows me was cute. Looks like he got himself a keeper. \"You got yourself a boyfriend?\" Petey asked me when we're sitting outside of the college. \"No, I don't,\" I couldn't mention Gerry to him. Especially, how the boys always want to kill each other at every second. \"I used to, but we broke up.\" \"Tell me that fool's name who broke up with you and I'll give him a talk.\" I giggled that he was protective and caring about me. \"It's fine, Petey. Just...no one important.\" \"Well, I hope whoever that guy is, he won't bother you. Just come to me if he does. I won't care that he's white neither.\" I rolled my eyes. \"Thanks, Petey.\" I got to know more of the other boys and one of them is Julius. Daddy told me where his dorm is and the door was closed. I hope Gerry isn't in the room right now with him. Hesitantly, I knocked twice on the door. Seconds later, Julius opens it. \"Yeah?\" He looks down at me, and suddenly, I feel small. I gave the same explanation as to why I want to talk to him like I did with the other black boys. \"You can be a brother to me, too,\" I glance at the room. \"Unless if you're busy...\" \"Uh, no, no. It's fine. Come in.\" He allows me in and closed the door. Thankfully, there was no sight of Gerry. \"So...what do you want to know about me?\" Julius asked suspiciously as if he never talked to a human being before. \"This ain't no interrogation. I just want to know you more. That's all.\" \"I know your Daddy put you up to this, but you don't have to. I'll cut you some time. There's nothing you need to know about me.\" Rev better keep praying for Julius' heart to soften because I'm getting sick of his attitude. \"I could have simply said no to what my father said, but I didn't. He likes Coach Boone's idea about everyone knowing each other and wanted me to do the same thing. I happen to like his idea, too. You can't just keep shutting everyone out,\" I crossed my arms defiantly as I make my stand. \"I am not going to leave until we talk one on one.\" Julius looks annoyed that I won't leave unless he meets my condition. \"Fine,\" He caved in. \"You can sit over there.\" His eyes moved over to the other bed where I assume it's Gerry's. \"What is it that you want to know?\" \"Is there anything you like to do besides football?\" \"I eat, sleep, and breathe football. Nothin' else is on my mind. What about you? What you like to do?\" \"I support my father. I like to go to his games and practices. I like to read and hope to become a writer someday. What is your dream job?\" \"Become a professional football played.\" \"Not surprised,\" I muttered, but it's loud enough for him to hear and he didn't care. \"Have any siblings?\" \"Only one. Her name is Deanna. She's sixteen.\" \"Me too!\" Something in common. That should be a plus. \"I have two older sisters Rachel and Lucy.\" \"You get along with them?\" I shrugged. \"Kind of. I'm mostly close to Sheryl. What about you and your sister? Close?\" \"Yeah. I'm protective of her.\" I can relate. \"I'm protective of Sheryl. One of these days her big mouth can get herself into trouble.\" To my surprise, he chuckled. He actually smiles. \"Why are you with your old man? Do you have a Mom?\" I looked down, not really wanting to talk about it, but we should open up more. He notices my silence. \"Sorry if that's too-\" \"No. It's fine,\" I assured. \"It's just that he needs me and I need him. I just don't want to live with my mother anymore. I can't take it. They're...they're divorced.\" \"You hate your Mom or somethin'?\" \"It's not that I hate her. They're divorced because she wanted it. My father always been a workaholic when it comes to football. It was a lot for our family. Now, she remarried to Paul who I refuse to allow him be my step father.\" \"Does he treat you bad?\" He asked seriously. \"Not really. He just treats me as if I'm still a little kid. As if he has any rights to be my father when I still have one,\" I try to calm myself down when I realize I'm getting angry just talking about her for betraying the family. \"I'm sorry. I'm getting flustered all over this.\" \"It's okay,\" He understood. \"I shouldn't have asked you somethin' so personal.\" \"No. This is good. We're gettin' to know each other. What about your family? Anything about them that drives you up the wall?\" At first, I thought he wasn't going to open up to me, but he did. Which is a good thing. There's nothing to be afraid of. It's just the two of us. \"My Dad puts too much pressure on me and always brags about how I am the best. I know that I am better than anyone out there on the field, but I always feel like I should raise the bar up higher. When he first showed me to Coach Boone, my Dad acted like he was talking to some celebrity.\" Julius shook his head in shame at his father's behavior. \"Just be the best player you can be, Julius,\" I encouraged him. \"Don't put so much pressure on yourself that it causes you to change who you are.\" He just nods, but I hope he takes it to heart. I sighed and got up to sit next to him. He was shocked that I did that as if I shouldn't be so close to him, but he made no protests so I'm not moving a muscle. \"What about your Mom?\" I changed the subject. \"Anything good about her?\" \"She's the best cook there is in Virginia. Always comes to my games.\" \"Ain't that sweet?\" I teased and I got another rare smile from him. \"Why can't you open up like this to Gerry?\" The smile immediately vanished when I mention his name. Shoot. My fault. He shrugs. \"It's easier to talk to girls about this stuff than guys,\" He confessed sheepishly. \"Especially, a beautiful one like you.\" I raise an eyebrow. \"Now you think I'm beautiful?\" I do appreciate and admirer the compliment. \"I know I'm not supposed to feel this way-\" \"It's okay. It's not the first I've dated a football player on my father's team.\" \"Who was he?\" I really didn't want to say his name because I know they don't get along well, but maybe this time, I have to. \"Gerry,\" I revealed. \"Look, we can talk about anything, but I don't want to talk about him right now, okay?\" \"Okay,\" He respected that and I'm glad. \"What about you? Have a girl?\" I wondered. \"No. I have an ex, too. Don't like to talk about her too much.\" \"I understand,\" I nodded. \"I know that we may be black and white, but color don't matter to me. I meant what I said with Louie that I have no people. I want us to be friends despite that the world may say no. We can have feelings for each other and that's okay because I...I may have some for you, too,\" I confessed a little embarrassed, but it's out there now. \"You're not that scary since I know you a bit more. You do have a heart, Julius.\" I grin at him. \"It's not like I'm a robot or the tin man. Is that how you felt about me? Scared?\" \"Mostly, intimidated. It's a lot different now. I see you,\" I place my hand on his left shoulder. \"You're not that scary, you just have a guard up. It needs to come down sometime.\" \"I'm afraid it already happened with you.\" Julius said and our eyes connects. His head was the first one to lean close to mine and I felt myself gravitate toward him. Then my lips touch his heads and it was unlike anything I've ever felt. The kiss was mind blowing as our mouths were moving along each other's. I feel at ease and I'm comfortable being against his body. What am I doing? I can't be making out in a boy's dorm! I'm definitely not that type of girl who is easy, thank you very much! My father would be livid with me if he finds out about this. We're friends and I can't do this to him right now. I want to stop this even though it feels so good and so right. I hate myself even more when I wrap my arms around his shoulders and his hands were at my waist. \"What the hell is going on in here?!\" We instantly stopped making out at the sound of an all too familiar voice. Gerry.[Chapter 4] \"Gerry-\" I want to explain to him as I jump off of Julius' bed. \"What are you doing with him?\" He angrily demanded. \"We were just talking and-\" \"That don't look like talking to me.\" It frustrates me that he wouldn't let me talk. \"Why should you care anyway? You can't tell me what to do or what not do.\" I crossed my arms, glaring at him. \"It's not like I was holding Angela here against her will.\" Julius said who was off from the bed and stood up. Gerry sends him a dangerous death glare. \"I don't think I really gave you the permission to speak right now, did I?\" \"Ever heard of free speech?\" Julius asked being annoyed. They were getting close to each other now, sizing the other up. \"I don't need to have your permission, man.\" \"Okay, stop! The both of you!\" I put myself in between them which may have been a stupid move on my part, but I'll do anything that won't result into them fighting. I turn to Gerry first. \"Why do you care what I do with Julius? We're not dating anymore, Gerry. You and I are free to be with whoever we like. I don't care that you're with Emma and you shouldn't care that I'm with Julius!\" So that's it. It's finally out in the open. I officially declared it that I have moved on right in front of his face. A big step for me if I must say so. I also mentioned that I'm with Julius. I don't know why said that because I don't know what we are after our little make out session. Hopefully, something more someday. I won't be any man's play thing and he'll toss me aside as if I was nothing. I want Julius and I to have something substantial. \"You're right. I shouldn't care. Sorry that I do,\" He said it with so much venom, but I still stand my ground. \"Why don't you get out of here? Or I'll tell Coach Yoast what you've been up to.\" \"Really, Gerry? That's low for you.\" I tried to act strong when he said that, but deep down, I'm terrified. \"I mean it, Angela. Go.\" He demanded and I was going to leave, but I glare at him. \"You may be the Captain of this team and get to boss everyone around, but don't think you can do the same to me.\" I snapped at him as I stand with my arms crossed being defiant. \"Angela, it's okay,\" Julius assured. \"Just go.\" I had no other choice, but to go. Before I left their room, I said to the both of them. \"Just behave, you two.\" I'm aware that a huge fight had happened because Daddy told me about it. The next day it was practice. I'm just gonna go out and say this that practice isn't going good so far. I can tell they're not playing their best. They still can't get used to working as team and getting their differences over a skin color. They were all together with Gerry who was talking to them angrily. \"What are y'all doing? You're supposed to know your jobs! Campbell, you're playing selfish, show off football. Hold your man down.\" He's going at it with Julius. Again. I don't know what happened after I left their dorm yesterday, but I take it didn't went well. Gerry is still taking it all out on Julius. Now, he has an excuse to because of his poor playing when the others haven't been doing so great themselves. Gerry and Julius hate each other, I know that. But could they hate each other even more...because of me? \"Don't you single me out like that. What, you think I'm stupid or something?\" Julius tested. \"Listen, I'm the team Captain, and I don't need you up in my face-\" Gerry said as he furiously went up to Julius' face and they started to fight each other. It's going to take forever until they can get past this. The other guys intervened in the fight and then Doc was telling all of them off. \"Ugh! They really need to get over themselves.\" Sheryl said. We're standing over at the water stand. She would help serve out water for the boys until they have a break. \"I couldn't agree with you more.\" \"Why do they always need to fight?\" \"Because they're men, Sheryl. That's what some of them do.\" \"They need to knock it off. We're wasting time.\" \"I know.\" I wholeheartedly agree with her. Practice was going on for hours it seems and the sun was blazing hot. I'm wearing denim shorts, a green tank top, and my sneakers. Sheryl and I drank our water because we were dying of thirst. I can only wonder how the boys must feel. Until Blue wanted to have a water break which could've been the worst thing he have said. Coach Boone works them twice as hard now. Later on after their up downs, the boys finally have their break. All of them gathered for water and I help Sheryl to fill and pass the cups around to them. \"I'll take that.\" Rev panted as he got his cup. When he did, Ray shoved him away as if he had skipped in line. \"Hey, wait your turn, boy!\" \"There's no line, Ray!\" I exclaimed to him. \"Just stay out of this!\" He snapped back at me. Then Julius pushes Ray. \"Who you calling a boy, cracker?\" \"Julius!\" I scolded him, but was too late. Another fight had broken out. I'm beginning to think the whole lot of them are getting delirious from being out in the sun too long. Sheryl kept throwing empty cups at them because of their attitude. The boys were all wrestling and fighting each other on the ground knocking down the table and the stuff on it in the process. \"Quit it, jerks! Come on! You're all acting like a bunch of sissies! Quit it!\" I grab Sheryl to pull her out of the way because this was getting ugly. \"Angela, what are you doing?\" She asked me. She sounds annoyed. \"Protecting your little butt cause if any of them makes one accidental wrong move to hurt you then they're gonna deal with me.\" I vowed and she didn't refuse that. The staff managed to end the fight. The table got fixed and everything else was on it. The other guys got their water, but Ray, Julius, and Gerry had to run a mile because they were the ones that started the fight. After everyone was relaxing for the last fifteen minutes they have, the other three was drenched in sweat and was desperate for water. I let myself serve them because I was still on guard for Sheryl's safety. When I gave a cup of water to Ray it was like he snatched it out of my hand. I was taken aback by that. \"What's your problem?\" I narrowed down my eyes at him. \"Gerry told me what you did with Campbell in his dorm and that you have betrayed us at lunch that one day.\" \" Betrayed you?\" I didn't know what he was talking about. \"You sat over there with Lastik and... them ,\" He said that last word as if it was poison. \"What? You'd rather be with them than us? Think they're better than us or something?\" \"What? No, Ray, I-\" \"Save it. Cause you were liplocking with him and now I know who's side you're really on.\" Ray went away to drink his water and to join the others. I couldn't believe Gerry told Ray or someone. I never knew what he had seen in Ray to be a good friend. Even before all of this, he seemed decent, but now, his true colors are coming out. Gerry grabs his cup and I couldn't say anything to him. I was too angry at him and I don't want another fight to happen. Julius got his cup and took a sip of it. Everyone else was minding their own business during the break so I take a chance to talk to Julius. \"You shouldn't have started that fight-\" \"You think I started it? Ray was asking for it. I'm getting sick of them not blocking for Rev and I'm getting called out on not doing my job?\" He shook his head and scoffs. \"Just tell them, Julius-\" \"As if Captain Cracker will listen to anything that I say.\" I hate how he keep using the derogatory term for white people. He doesn't realize that it's insulting me, too. \"Is that what you think of me, too?\" I asked him. Our voices were low that only us can hear. \"Angela...\" He sighed. \"What happened in your room yesterday, was that just...fooling around to you or something?\" \"No, it wasn't like that-\" \"Then treat me and the other white people with respect. You can be better. I...I was starting to think we have something. A connection.\" \"Angela, what we did yesterday did mean something more. Only you were the one who really spoke to me and want to know me. You made me change my mind that there still are good people like you.\" He put his left hand on top of my right at the table. His hand feels large, strong, and warm. I hold his hand back. A surge of electricity went throughout my entire body and I wonder if he feels that spark, too. \"I'm glad that I have that affect on you,\" I smiled. \"I originally wanted you to be like a brother to me, but now I think I know what we are.\" \"We can't be what you want us to be, Angela.\" There was sadness and love in his eyes that tells me he wants it to, but the public's opinion has an impact on us which I don't care about. \"We don't have to listen or care what the world says what we should or shouldn't do, Julius. We can be...together...if that's what you really want. Even in secret.\" I can tell he was thinking it over. \"Maybe in secret is for the best.\" \"For now.\" I added because we have to come out eventually. I know my father and sister wouldn't care about us being in a romantic relationship, but he has more people of his own. His family, the team, and just simply because he's a black man. Their break was up and Coach Boone was yelling at them to get back on the field. \"You should go. I don't want to keep you up.\" I said. His thumb rubs my hand for one last time and drank what's left of his water. He put the cup on the table and ran to meet the others on the field. Coach let Sheryl and I spend the night at the college if we wanted to. Of course, Sheryl did. I went back home to pack some clothing for the night and went to our own dorm room together that her and I can share. Daddy offered me the choice to stay because he knew I like to run. It's one of my exercises I do and early in the morning, and the boys and staff were going to run in the woods. So, I wake up at the same time they do in the early dawn. Sheryl can still sleep in her bed. I'm in my hoodie sweatshirt with shorts and sneakers. My legs would feel burning and be like jelly soon after we're done. Eventually, I have to take a break and lean against a tree. Not so far, I can see and hear Gerry and Julius talking. I hope it would be at least peaceful somewhat and no more fighting. I hid myself behind the tree so they won't notice me. They were both panting trying to get their breaths. \"Alright, man, listen,\" Gerry began impatiently. \"I'm Gerry, you're Julius. Let's get some particulars and just get this over with, alright?\" At least Gerry is putting an effort... \"Particulars?\" Julius asked. \"Yeah.\" \"No matter what I tell you, you ain't never gonna know a thing about me.\" \"Listen, I ain't runnin' any more of these three a day practices.\" \"What I got to say you really don't wanna hear 'cause honesty ain't too high on your people's priority list.\" Well, knowing Gerry personally, I can't say I disagree with Julius on that one. But Julius did confess to me that I changed about how he thinks of us. He believes there can be good people like me. My family and I are one of the few who respects other races. \"Honesty? You want honesty? Alright, honestly , I think you're nothing.\" Gerry's words just hit me straight to the core at my heart. How can he call someone, Julius, nothing? Has he really been that cold hearted and prejudiced before I even knew him intimately? Was I too blinded by love to see it? I try to keep myself undercover. I don't want to defend Julius unless if I really have to. \"Nothing, but a pure waste of God given talent. You don't listen to nobody, man! Not even Doc or Boone! Shiver push on the line every time, man. You blow right past 'em! Push 'em! Pull 'em! Do something! You can't run over everybody in this league, and every time you do, you leave one of your teammates hanging out to dry - me in particular!\" \"Why should I give a hoot about you, huh? Or anybody else out there? You want to talk about being Captain?\" \"Right.\" \"Captain's supposed to be the leader, right?\" \"Right.\" \"You got a job? You been doing your job? \"I've been doing my job.\" \"Then why don't you tell your white buddies to block for Rev better? 'Cause they have not blocked for him worth a plugged nickel, and you know it! Nobody plays! Your self included! I'm supposed to wear myself out for the team? What team?! No. No, what I'm gonna do is, I'm gonna look out for myself, and I'm gonna get mine.\" \"See, man? That's the worst attitude I ever heard.\" \"Attitude reflects leadership, Captain.\" There was a very dangerous glare between them, but I'm glad there was no fight that broke out this time. I was about to leave until Gerry brought me up. \"About you and Angela...I don't know what is going on between you two, but if something is happening what I think is happening, then I hope you don't hurt her like I did cause you're gonna regret it if you do,\" He said seriously. \"We've all known the Yoast girls since we were kids. Angela and Sheryl are like sisters to all of us, to me.\" \"I won't hurt her.\" Julius promised which makes me smile. \"Good,\" He approved then softly adds. \"Neither of us really deserve Angela.\" \"I know.\"[Chapter 5] The sound of the foghorn blew loudly and it made me jump awake. I'm starting to think I'm in a military rather than being at a football camp. It's time for another run that Coach Boone wanted the boys to do. Daddy warned me about it yesterday and I told him I'd join them. It would be a bit chilly, cool, and foggy. I'm getting changed into the same hoodie of mine and sneakers, but with different shorts. \"What's going on?\" Sheryl asked tiredly, being half asleep and half awake. \"We're going out for a run, but you can sleep in.\" I told her at the side of her bed. \"Good. That horn was really annoying.\" She mumbled and her heavy, tired eyes went back to sleep. I chuckled softly at her and went outside to the rest. The other guys were flooding out of their dorms. They were being tired, yawning, and stretching. While I'm rubbing my eyes, I accidentally bump into someone and I see it was Ray. \"Sorry-\" \"Save it, Yoast. Too early for this.\" He interrupted me and all of us went outside where the rest of the staff was. \"Wake up, gentlemen, it's late. It's three AM in the morning. Alright, listen up. You will follow Doc, myself, and the other coaches. We're gonna take a little run through the woods. If you get lost along the way, don't bother coming back to camp. Just hitchhike your hindparts on home. Any questions?\" There was stunned silence at how serious Coach Boone was taking it. It does feel like we're in the military... \"Coach, this is a high school football team. We're not in the marines here.\" Thankfully, Daddy took him down a few notches, but Boone just stared at him then back at us. \"Let's go.\" He said anyway and was the first to run off. The rest of the staff slowly follows after him. \"Let's go.\" Daddy sighed and I should've asked him where we're running to if he knew. Minutes later, I regret joining them on this run because it's raining. I should've stayed inside with Sheryl, but I've committed to this. Also, I don't want the guys to think I'm weak so I shouldn't take any breaks. I have to keep pushing myself. Sometimes the other guys would stop for a second to catch their breath. Eventually, I had to do the same. \"Where are we running to exactly?\" I panted and I don't care about the rain at this moment. \"To the edge of the earth?\" \"It feels like it,\" Alan took a breath as well. \"What is up with you and Ray lately? You two are acting cold to each other.\" \"I don't wanna talk about it...\" I muttered, and thankfully, Alan respected that. I do like Alan. As friends and a brotherly and sisterly way, of course. In fact, he's one of the nicest ones on the team. Ray can be nice when he wants to be; I had a crush on him when I was a freshman, but that went away when he began to date other girls because he's a grade above me like some of the other boys were. Gerry can act like one of the guys, but when you're with him alone, he can be a gentleman and a great boyfriend. Alan is just nice all around without having to fake a personality. That's what I like the most about him. We continued on running and the morning was breaking through in the skies. The rain has finally stopped and I felt like I ran a marathon. We're at a cemetery. \"This is Gettysburg. This is where they fought the Battle of Gettysburg. Men died right here on this field, on this field, fightin' the same fight that we're still fightin' amongst ourselves today. This green field right here was painted red. Bubbling with the blood of young boys. Smoke...and hot lead pouring right through their bodies. Listen to their souls, men. 'I killed my brother with malice in my heart.' 'Hat red destroyed my family.' You listen...and you take a lesson from the dead. If we don't come together...right now, on this hallowed ground...then we, too, will be destroyed. Just like they were. I don't care if you like each other or not, but you will respect each other, and maybe...I don't know, maybe we'll...learn to play this game like men.\" We could only dream something like that would come true. The boys kept practicing hard until night time like always. Sheryl was with us on the field during the day, but when it was getting late in the evening, that's when she headed back for bed. Daddy and I didn't expect her to be out here at this time so she was free to go. I had to lead her back to our dorm so she can rest. Then I went outside back on the field to them. I stand by to the coaching staff and was hearing Gerry yelling and pushing at Ray. I crossed my arms at them, wondering what has gotten into Gerry. \"Good, Lord, what is going on now?\" I groaned. \"I don't know.\" Daddy sighed. I can tell the coaches were ready to intervene if they needed to. \"What was that, Ray? Whatever it is, it ain't blockin'!\" Gerry got all up in Ray's face. \"Give me a break, Gerry.\" Ray said. \"You want a break? I'll give you a break!\" They look like they were about to fight and even Coach Boone was worried that would. I was about to go along with him to end it, but Daddy stopped us. \"Wait a minute, wait, wait,\" He was telling Boone. \"Let them handle this.\" I was put at ease by his words and Boone listened to him and stayed at his place. I really didn't want another fight to erupt. I don't want Ray to hurt Gerry. \"If we get to Rev once, just one time, I swear to God, I'm gonna hit you so hard, by the time you come to, ooh, boy, you're gonna need a new hair cut. You understand me?\" Gerry was jerking Ray around and was laughing at his face. He encouraged the others to keep on playing. Now I really wonder what has gotten into Gerry. Did Julius finally talked to him about how the guys were treating Rev? Looks like he did because of how it seems to have gotten to Gerry's attention. I think I'm proud for the both of them. Coach Boone blew his whistle. \"On the ball. Let's run it again.\" He smiled at Daddy and it's rare to see him smiling. The boys went at it again and Julius tackled Petey. \"You alright, big Petey?\" Julius slapped at Petey jokingly. \"You really stuck him, Campbell!\" Gerry cheered. \"Yeah, I love me a little contact, Petey!\" Julius called at the younger boy. \"Left side!\" Gerry suddenly pushed him. Everyone didn't know what to do next. I'm confused and worried for the both of them. I think Gerry was just joking around with him because he was grinning and nodding his head at Julius as if to do the same. Julius got the message and pushed him back. \"Strong side!\" Daddy and I exchanged a glance at each other and neither of us broke this up. Gerry and Julius looks like they're just having fun and really mean no harm. \"Left side!\" Gerry yelled, pushing Julius. \"Strong side!\" So did he, pushing Gerry. They did that for a few more times. Everyone was confused, but some were smiling at them having fun. That two guys like them got along. Julius and Gerry held each other by their helmets and their foreheads were touching as they screamed obnoxiously loud at each other. \"Is this the guy version of girls squealing at each other when they're excited?\" I smirked at Daddy. \"This is only the beginning.\" He said. Hopefully, Gerry and Julius will become friends now and see beyond color. Sheryl and I went back home and we said goodbye to our father. I told him we would be back tomorrow. I promised our mother we would visit her today as much as I don't want to. Sheryl wasn't too happy either. She wanted to be with her Daddy. I wanted to privately say goodbye to Julius before I do. I went to his dorm and I open it seeing it's Gerry who answered. Julius is in the room with him. \"What's up, Angie?\" Gerry asked. \"Can I talk to Julius alone?\" I requested. \"Is that all you wanted?\" Gerry was giving me and him suspicious looks. Despite that they may have gotten along, I don't think Gerry is completely okay with me and Julius. \"Or are you two going to do something more ?\" \"No, you perv!\" I hit him at his arm, but it really caused no affect. He just moved a little. \"I'm just leaving for now and will come back tomorrow.\" \"You're leaving?\" That caught Julius' attention and he stood up from his bed. \"Yeah.\" I said to him and I really want Gerry to be out of our way. He's the one who's blocking the entry of the room. \"Fine. I'll go.\" He sighed and walks away. Now, it's just Julius and I alone. I closed the door shut. \"I promised my mother that Sheryl and I would be with her. Then I'll come back.\" I said to him. \"You better,\" Julius scolded me teasingly. \"Whenever I get mad, I just see you and I calm down.\" \"Is that what happened last night? When you and Gerry were just screaming at each other's faces?\" I made a half smirk at him. \"Yeah. When he pushed me, I didn't know what to do. I thought he was tryin' to start something. But when I saw him grinning and you looking worried, I didn't cause a fight. I knew he was just messing around with me.\" \"That night might have been the best highlight of the camp.\" I said walking closer to him and we're just holding each other's hands. Our foreheads were touching each other's. He chuckled. \"I'm glad you're learning to tolerate him, Julius,\" I said honestly. \"You can actually work together.\" \"It's not easy with that man,\" He shook his head. \"But I promise to make it work.\" \"Good. You better. Don't just make it better for me, but for the whole team.\" \"You got it.\" Then he kissed me and everything was in perfect bliss. Judith would always look pristine and perfect. She has light curly brown hair and her eyes were a hazel color. Her make up is flawless and she always wears pretty blouses and skirts like she has on now. She'll wear more laid back clothing when she wants to clean. Rachel and Lucy definitely got that girly part of her. Sheryl and I are mostly like Daddy; we belong on the field. We've been updating her on our lives which nothing much was going on. We've been with our father most of the time. Work is what split my parents up. Judith couldn't handle Daddy's coaching and football schedule and how he was always so busy. She grew a disdain for us always being with him more than her so Sheryl and I do make plans to visit her. \"Do you like interracial relationships?\" I asked when I'm done sipping from my lemonade that I made. \"Depends. As friends or romantically?\" Judith replied. The three of us were just almost done eating our sandwiches. I thought about it for a second. \"Both.\" I shrugged. \"It depends how the person is, Angela.\" \"What about on a romantic point of view?\" \"Well...that would be different. Different backgrounds and different families. If you're thinking about marriage then imagine what the poor kids would look like and how they'd get made fun of.\" Judith shook her head negatively. Even Sheryl was giving me a strange look and didn't know where I am going with this. She doesn't know that I'm secretly dating Julius. Maybe I'll tell her later. \"Why are you curious about that?\" She asked me as if our conversation was ridiculous. I shrugged again not knowing what to say because of her attitude. \"Just...wondering. That's all.\" I decide not to tell her about the secret relationship that I have with Julius. It's better not to.[Chapter 6] Author's Note: For anyone who wants a visual of who Angela Yoast looks like, I imagine her to look like the actress, Christina Ricci with blonde hair. Enjoy reading and please review! :) The next day, Sheryl and I showed up at the camp while they're having lunch. We went to Daddy first and greet him. Sheryl sat next to him and he offered me a seat beside him, too, but I said I'm going to sit with the guys like I always do. \"Coach Boone?\" I was about to leave until she got his attention. I stayed here just to know what she's going to say. I'm not so sure that she likes him yet. \"You did a good job up here. You're in a tough camp from what I can see.\" Boone seems to be more amused. \"Well, I'm very happy to have the approval of a five year old.\" Oh, no. He messed up her age. Of course, he wouldn't know, but I can see Sheryl's glare. \"I'm nine and a half thank you very much.\" I flicked at her behind her head as a scolding. \"Sheryl!\" \"Ow!\" She rubbed the spot. \"Why don't you get this little girl some pretty dolls or something, Coach?\" He suggested. \"I tried. She loves football.\" Daddy simply said which surprises him. \"I gave her my old dolls once,\" I said. \"Sometimes I see them with their heads off and I would never see the rest of them again.\" The guys looked at Sheryl with either a great impression or confusion. That's my little sister for ya. I went to the table where Gerry and Julius was sitting. \"Hey, boys,\" I greet them all and they moved over to make room for me. \"What did I miss? No one killed each other today?\" \"Ray looked like he wanted to when Gerry told him off that this was the defensive table.\" Alan said. I furrowed my eyebrows and look at Gerry. \"You guys sit by positions now?\" \"Yeah. It only makes sense.\" He replied as he ate. \"Hey, Gerry, man, you oughtta tell Angela what happened with you and Sunshine in the locker room.\" Julius smirked and the other guys started laughing at him. Gerry gave him a hard glare. \"I rather not, Julius.\" \"Who is Sunshine?\" I wondered. I don't think I ever met him before. \"The newbie,\" Julius answered. He pointed at him with his fork and I turn around and spot him at his table that he's with Petey and Blue. \"Ronnie Bass is from California and Gerry got a taste of what those Californians really do over there.\" \"Shut up, man!\" Gerry kicked Julius hard at his knees under the table, but it only made him and the other guys laugh much more. \"What is it? I've got to know!\" I want more details. Something embarrassing happened to my ex and whatever it is it must be good. Gerry groaned and covers his face while he ate. \"Sunshine might be playing for the other team if you catch my drift.\" \"You mean, he's...\" I couldn't believe that he was. I may be in a relationship with Julius, but Ronnie does look cute. \"Uh, you know.\" \"That's what we're thinkin' now on the count of what he did to Bertier.\" \"What did he do to him?\" I kept asking and looking at him, but he ignores all of us. \"Sunshine made the moves on our boy Gerry,\" Julius answered and was enjoying the humiliation Gerry was suffering. \"He kissed him-\" \"What?!\" I freaked out and look at the Captain in utter shock. \"Okay! That's enough! Drop it!\" Gerry exclaimed during the guys' laughter. \"She doesn't need to know anymore.\" \"Well, I don't really care if he's...uh, you know, or not. I mean...I still find him cute.\" I confessed. \"You do?\" Julius asked me surprised. \"Yeah. Just wait till all the girls at school get a gander at him. They'll be drooling all over. I won't have a chance.\" I added to tell him the truth and to comfort him. Ronnie will sure be the popular eye candy. Julius seems to be fine with my response. The boys were playing football after lunch a couple of hours later. They seem to be better working together and even Sunshine - I mean, Ronnie, was being compatible with them. I was joining Sheryl with yelling at them to do better and encouraging them. They eventually take a break and I help Sheryl passing cups of water around. She passes one to Ronnie and just look at him confusedly. \"Who are you?\" \"I'm Ronnie Bass from California.\" \"He's also known as Sunshine.\" Petey jokes as he passed and some of the guys he was with laughed as well. Ronnie just gave him a look and then stares down at my little sister. \"What is your name, little lady?\" \"Sheryl and I ain't little.\" She said with an attitude. \"I'm Angela. Her older sister.\" I introduced myself being kinder to him unlike Sheryl. \"Ronnie or as you already know, Sunshine.\" He smiled friendly. \"Which do you prefer?\" I asked him. \"Sunshine or Ronnie?\" \"Doesn't matter to me, Angela. I know the guys are just ragging on me.\" \"Hey, ummm...is it true that you, uh, kissed Gerry?\" I talked to him in a low voice that only we can hear. \"You've heard of that, huh?\" He raised an eyebrow in amusement. \"I didn't know if the guys were telling the truth or if it's just one of their lame jokes, but Gerry seemed very disturbed at what happened so...\" I trailed off not knowing what to believe. \"Yeah, I kissed him.\" He answered like it wasn't a big deal. \"Gerry's really pissed at that. Why did you do it?\" \"He's the one who called me a fruitcake.\" He argued and does have a good point. That does sound like something Gerry would say to him. I chuckled. \"The guys are never gonna let you live that down. And you know you're gonna get called Sunshine for the rest of your life, right?\" \"Yeah, but I don't care.\" He said really being carefree about it. \"So...are you really, uh, gay?\" I was finally able to say that word. \"I'm not. Believe me,\" He smirked and that almost made me swoon. \"I would rather kiss a pretty thing like you than him any day.\" He winks at me and I tried not to blush. Snap out of it , Yoast! I mentally yelled at myself. If he has that such an easy affect on me then I'm sure the girls at school would be a lot worse. It was the last day of camp and we all packed our things. I visited Julius and Gerry's dorm while they're packing. \"You boys need any help?\" I offered as I'm cringing on the inside that they're just sloppily throwing their dirty and unwashed clothes in their suitcases. \"No,\" They said simultaneously and I should've expected that. \"So, looks like you've guys finally settled your differences and became friends?\" \"I say more like brothers,\" Julius looks at Gerry. \"What do you think, Superman?\" \"Brothers with some of that soul power.\" Gerry grinned and they laughed. I can't help, but to join in to because of how crazy they've been these past few weeks. They wanted to kill each other before, and now, they're all best buds. \"You know, after we get off that bus we're going to enter into the real world. Not everyone will approve of our new friendships.\" I said to them and I think of my relationships with Julius. He even looked like he didn't know what to say to that and was in slight fear and worry. \"Who cares what other people will think?\" Gerry said bravely. \"I don't give a damn if they do.\" \"What about us?\" Julius wondered. \"Us?\" Gerry didn't get it. \"Yeah, us .\" I held Julius' hand to make his point that Gerry will understand. \"Oh, well, if you two really love each other then you'll still be together no matter what.\" \"You'll be okay with that?\" I asked him carefully. \"I have to be, don't I? I'm with Emma and you're with him. I have to move on.\" I'm glad he said that and starts to accept it. On the bus, we're all singing loudly our favorite song by Steam: Na, Na, Na, Hey, Hey, Hey, Goodbye. I was sitting with Rev and sing along with them. My car was back at home so I can ride back with the rest of the boys. Judith was the one who dropped Sheryl and I off. Sheryl's sitting with Coach on the other bus. It was great to be on this bus and it's actually fun and there's great energy. I don't want anything else to hurt these boys. We finally arrived at the parking lot of the school. All of us got off and I was going to meet up with Sheryl and Coach, but Julius pulls me aside. \"We'll still be together, right?\" He asked. \"Right,\" I confirmed and put on a half smile. \"Our little secret.\" He smiled, too, and we both want to kiss each other, but we can't because we're in public. If it's this hard right now then I don't know how long we can keep this a secret. \"Bye, Julius.\" \"Bye, Angela.\" He said and we both depart to our families. I'm being introduced to Coach Boone's family. He has a beautiful wife and two cute daughters. \"Hello, Mrs. Boone.\" Daddy and I greeted her. \"Hello. You have very beautiful daughters, Bill.\" She complimented. \"Thank you.\" He said back to her kindly. \"This is little Karen and this is Nicky. Nicky, that's Sheryl.\" Coach Boone introduced. \"Why do you dress so weird?\" Then Daddy pinched Sheryl at her arm. \"Ow!\" \"Look who's talking.\" Nicky sassed. \"Well, we're just all getting along, aren't we?\" Coach Boone said sarcastically after the interaction from the two young girls. \"If you guys can manage to get all those boys to not kill each other then so can these two.\" I commented and they all chuckled. Unfortunately, (but it was to be expected) there were protesters out on September 4th which was the first day of school. Even the police was here just in case if things get any more chaotic. It's because of TC Williams integration. The black and white students were separating themselves. This is all just a start of something not so great. At camp we have finally come together, but the world wasn't at camp. They haven't come to that part yet. I'm looking for my friends, but also for Julius just to see if he's okay. But then I spot Sunshine trying to pass his way through these guys. \"We don't need you here either, hippie boy.\" A guy said trying to act all intimidating to him with his other friends. \"You hear what he said?\" Another guy spoke up next to him. \"C'mon, Ronnie,\" I said using his full name so that he won't get teased by getting called Sunshine by everyone. That's only just for the guys on the team. And myself, of course. I grab his hand to pull him away from them. \"Let's leave these jerks.\" They truly are jerks. They're white and so is Sunshine, but they don't like him just cause he looks like hippie ? How low can people get? \"It's okay, Angela.\" He said. \"Oh, so you're little girlfriend is in control now?\" The same guy who first taunted him said and his other stupid friends laughed. We ignore them and continue to walk alway. I let his hand go when we're at a good distance away from them. \"Thanks, Angie, but you really didn't have to.\" \"Just helping you out. You're my brother now. Siblings watch and protect each other.\" I said remembering what Daddy taught me. \"I really appreciate it.\" He smiled gratefully, but there was something about him that looks disappointed, but I don't know why. Maybe because I see him as a brother? Then Julius made his way toward us. Out of relief that he's okay, I hug him and he hugs me back. We let go of each other and he said as he shook Sunshine's hand. \"Looks like a zoo out here, huh, bro?\" \"Worse than a zoo,\" He sighed. \"But who can blame them? They don't understand us like we do.\" \"You got that right.\" Julius agreed and Sunshine walked away to the school. \"This is such a disaster, isn't it?\" I asked to Julius. \"It'll blow off eventually.\" He said. \"I don't know...\" I have my own doubts. \"I just don't want anyone to give you a hard time.\" \"Hey, don't worry. I can take care of myself.\" He assured. I was about to respond until I'm interrupted when I heard my friends calling for me. \"Angela!\" We turned to them, Michelle and Lydia. \"This is so crazy, isn't it?\" Lydia asked, looking around like she never saw anything like this before. Really, we all haven't. Only on the news and stuff. \"Who are you?\" Michelle asked to Julius rudely, looking at him up and down. \"Hi, I'm Julius Campbell.\" He introduced himself. Neither Michelle or Lydia looks at him in disgust, as if he's wasting their time. Julius got the message and lowered his hand to his side getting rejected. \"Why are you talking with him?\" Michelle asked. \"We're friends,\" I answered in an obvious tone. \"He's on the football team.\" \"Well, come on, Ange. The other girls are waiting for us over there,\" Lydia points to the group of girls that we talk to and sometimes hang out with. \"Unless if you actually want to be with him.\" I felt torn whether I want to be with Julius or not. He didn't say anything either as if giving me an option. I can't be with him because we're secretly dating and I don't want to upset and lose my friends. \"I'll catch up,\" I said to them and they respected that and left. I turn to my boyfriend to apologize. \"I'm sorry-\" \"No, it's okay. Just go,\" He said gently and I'm glad that he understands. \"I'll go find Gerry.\" \"Okay.\" I hold his hand and giving him a light squeeze as his thumb gently rubs against the back of my hand. Then we let each other and I went to my friends and he went to Gerry. This isn't going to be an easy school year, is it?[Chapter 7] Author's Note: This is just an original scene I have about the first day of school. I want to have more original scenes like this to have more Angela and Julius moments. All the protestors left when school was in session. There was tension in the building, everyone can sense that. In the gymnasium, all of us gathered to sit on the bleachers and listen to the speech from Principal Henderson about how we shouldn't be defined by separate races, but by human beings and being great examples as students to show that we can work harmoniously. Reminds me of Coach Boone's motivational speeches. Then the school day went on like normal. Blacks and whites still separated themselves from sitting near to each other like in classes and even in the cafeteria was worse. There was a great divide between the blacks and whites. Except for the Titans. They made me proud that they're sitting together despite that people are giving them odd and strange looks. I do notice that Ray wasn't with them and he's sitting with his other friends. I wanted to go there as well and Alan passed by at me. \"I can save you a seat if you want.\" He offered. I smiled at him gratefully. I was about to say something until Lydia and Michelle got to me. \"C'mon, Angela. You can sit with us,\" Michelle tries to lure me over there. \"You really don't want to sit with all of those guys, do you?\" \"Yeah, I mean some of them are good looking and all-\" \"Thanks.\" Alan grinned. \"I said some of them,\" Lydia emphasized giving a playful mean look to him. Then she looks back at me. \"But we haven't seen you in forever.\" \"Okay, okay. I'll sit with you girls. Sorry, Alan. Maybe some other time?\" I said unsure and he understood and walks away to the team's table. We were talking about everything while we ate and I was getting the latest gossip on all of them. It was gym class and us white girls were with the black girls who's in my grade. We were acting pretty tame so far. Even though we avoid each other like a plague. I think I spot the one who might've been Julius' ex. \"I asked Julius if he wanted to hang out with me sometime like how we used to, but he just said no.\" The black girl said, and I think her name is Tara. \"Maybe you're just better off without him, Tara,\" Her friend said being on her side. \"You two were always fightin' and carryin' on anyways.\" I want to listen more to their conversation, but Lydia got my attention. \"Why don't you hang out with us on Saturday? You, me, Michelle, Jessica, and Violet will all get something to eat and go to the movie theater?\" \"It's Dad's first game of the season on Saturday against Hayfield. It's very important since it's the first game and all. Dad said if Coach Boone would lose the game, then his Head Coach job will be handed over to him so it's pretty serious.\" \"That Coach Boone guy will lose his job if he just lost one game? Really?\" Lydia asked in surprised and I nod. \"Hm, well, fine if you don't want to go.\" \"Don't tell me you and Michelle never want to go to a game?\" \"Yeah, we want to, but there are many games for that in the future, Ange.\" She answered. \"Okay.\" I'm happy that they'll go at least to one game with me. After getting a very quick shower from gym, we changed back to our normal clothes and went to our next class which was Literature. Julius has been in some of my classes as well as the other guys on the team. I'm relieved when I see him again and I sit next to him. \"Hey, you,\" I teased. \"Enjoying your first day here?\" \"Yeah. Except some of the white boys look like they want to kill me. I just get out of their way.\" \"You have the team watching out for you guys.\" I encouraged him. \"I don't know how long we're going to go through this.\" \"It won't be forever, Julius. Think of how camp went and how you guys became friends. The same thing can happen here at school.\" \"Really?\" He doubted. \"Looks like a slow process from what I can see.\" I had other classes with Julius and other members of the team. It was nice seeing my other friends again after the summer, but even greater when there's the Titans team that I know very well. Just like I predicted, Sunshine was getting many attention from girls who were swooning at him. He just minded his own business and was ignoring them. I thought a guy from California would take all of the attention he can get. Sunshine just doesn't seem to care. The first day went by quickly and it was very easy. Sure, it's just the beginning, but after the protesting, everything went fine and normal. After school was over, I went to my car at the parking lot. Julius was walking right along my side. \"Maybe if Coach don't mind, I can drive you to school.\" Julius offered which was really sweet. \"I know I'd like that,\" I smiled. \"I'll have to ask him.\" He smiled, too. \"Great.\" Julius looked like he wants to say something, but I know what he really wants. I had to look around just to see if anyone was paying close attention. There wasn't that many people who cared so I gave him a quick kiss. That surprised him. \"You...you kissed me in public...\" \"Do you have a problem with that, Campbell?\" I smirked with my arms crossed. \"No. It just caught me off guard, that's all,\" He stepped closer to me and was holding my hands. \"Do you want to come out now?\" \"I don't know, Julius. That kiss alone was a big step for me...\" I answered nervously. \"I understand.\" I can tell he was disappointed, but still respects my decision. \"Gerry already knows about us,\" I pointed out positively like that should be a good thing. \"He figured that out on his own. He ain't stupid, you know.\" \"I know he's not and neither the rest of the guys on the team either,\" Julius said. \"It scares me too what people will think about us being together, but it's driving me crazy at the same time.\" \"We just can't come out yet, Julius.\" I shook my head. \"Fine,\" He said giving up on it, but doesn't seem to appear being upset with me. He kissed my forehead. \"Drive safe.\" \"You, too.\" I said and we walk go into our own cars and drive home. What will my friends think of me? The whole school? My reputation is pretty much based on that I'm Coach Yoast's daughter. I'm very close with the boys on the team. Some people twist and pervert that into thinking I'm just a skank who sleeps with all of them. That's so not true and I wouldn't even dream of doing something like that. I usually don't care what people think of me, but this...this is a different story. It's not just about myself now. It's about me and Julius.[Chapter 8] It was a Friday, the last day of the first week of school. There was no major fights this week which was good. I've seen too many fights happened already at football camp. Everything was all going smoothly, except there was a brawl between two black guys and four white guys. So, who do you think had the bigger advantage? The white guys were obviously ganging up on them. Unfortunately, I was in the middle of it when the fight happened in the hallway. I was so glad I did not get hurt, and Julius pulled me to the side away from it. Some of the members of the football team tried to break it up, but somehow made it worse. Only a few teachers could stop them and put an end to it. Those guys who got involved had a detention. Julius thought it was unfair. One of them who was caught up in it got called the...N word, if you must know. \"I was just minding my own business then those guys got all up in my face. They were getting in mine and Darryl's way. I tried to control my temper, but they kept pushing me, and I just...snapped.\" Shawn explained his side of the story to Julius and I. \"Are you okay?\" I asked him with worry. \"Just a black eye, I'm sure of it,\" He answered, not seeming to care much. \"I'll go to the nurse later.\" \"Sorry you had to go through that, man.\" Julius sympathized. \"Whatever,\" He mumbled. \"I can't believe my parents let me go to this damn school. Ain't nothing good comes from white people.\" \"Not all of them are so bad.\" Julius said and we glanced at each other briefly for a second. I gave him a small smile for saying that and I see his soft gaze at me. Then we looked back at Shawn and Darryl. \"You seriously believe that?\" Shawn asked him with doubt. \"Yes.\" He nodded. \"You have to play with them on the team, don't you?\" Darryl asked. \"It's no wonder you guys didn't kill each other.\" \"Yeah, it's no wonder.\" I said sarcastically. \"You're the coach's daughter, ain't you?\" Shawn asked me. \"Yeah, I am. I'm Angela Yoast.\" I have my hand out for him to shake, but he just stared at it being conflicted as if he wants to or not. I kind of felt awkward and uncomfortable when he didn't shake my hand and I just lower my arm back to my side. \"Why you hanging out with a white girl, Julius?\" He asked me. \"We became friends over the summer at camp.\" Julius answered. \"I go to camp with my father and my little sister,\" I explained. \"It's a tradition that we do. My little sister loves football.\" Shawn nodded in understanding, but didn't say anything. It got awkward and uncomfortable for me again, and I know I need to go to class soon. \"Well...I, uh, have to go to class. I'll see you gentlemen later.\" I said and gave a last longing look to Julius and he stared back at me, too. On Saturday was our very first game against Hayfield. I was sitting with Sheryl at the bleachers. She was losing her mind over how poor the Titans were playing. I'll just say they're not doing so hot. I don't bother Sheryl when she's in this mood. I've learned my lesson once from trying to snap her out of it, but the girl won't listen to me. \"We're moving like molasses out there!\" She yelled, pacing left and right with frustration. \"I mean, come on! You guys can do better than - uuuggghhh!\" \"Momma, are all white girls that crazy?\" I heard Nicky asked her mother. \"No, just Sheryl. She's a special case.\" I answered sarcastically, but she looks at me as if I'm ridiculous. It was like she took my comment seriously. I don't pay attention to her, and focus on the game. Later, they switched Peter into playing defense, but they had to take Alan out. Mr. Bosley was angry for pulling his son out. \"Don't you take out my son!\" He yelled being on his feet. \"He's gettin' beat like he stole somethin', Mr. Bosley.\" Sheryl tried to explain to him. \"You just stay out of it, girl!\" He snapped at her which got me on defensive mode myself. I stood up to him where they both were. \"Don't talk back to my sister who is just a little girl, Mr. Bosley. It would be best for Alan if he was out because he can't chase the guy. Too fast for him.\" He just glared at the both of us and kept going on with his adult tantrum. I sighed hopelessly. Sheryl approached to me with amusement on her face. \"I thought you don't know football?\" \"I know a thing or two when we suck.\" I said. After the change the Titans made, they played a heck of a lot better than they did before. They even won the game! During the night after the game, I went with the guys to celebrate. I was walking along with Julius, Gerry, and Alan. Julius and I were still secretly dating, so we didn't hold hands, but stood very close to each other. Of course, only Gerry knew the truth about us. He was busy comforting Alan who felt bad about himself at how he played. \"My Dad is...\" Alan started to groan. \"Don't worry about it,\" Gerry said. \"It's not your fault. They-they like to show off, and that's what they do.\" \"Wait, wait, wait. ' They '?\" Julius got offended at how Gerry referred to his people. I sighed frustratedly. Not this again. \"Yeah, they . Them. Them over there.\" Gerry pointed at Petey where he was with the other guys on the team. \"But what you mean by ' they ' - you talkin' about Pete-\" \"You're you , and they are them .\" Gerry repeated himself, and I can sense and argument was going to blow out. \"Gerry didn't mean it like that.\" I told Julius, who now angrily turns me. \"Why you always gotta defend him?\" \" Always ?\" I scoffed. The three of us exploded into a fight, not physical or anything, just verbal. Poor Alan was standing there awkwardly and uncomfortable. I didn't mind him because I was too angry at Julius. Fortunately, a car horn interrupted our stupid fight, but we're all still annoyed at each other. It was Emma, Ray, and their friends in Ray's car. They wanted me and Gerry to go along with them to hang out. Maybe I would've just because of the mood I'm in right now, but with Emma there, too, I can't. Even Gerry rejected them, and so did I. Of course they weren't happy with that, and drove away. Gerry and Alan walked ahead of us, and I stayed along walking next to Julius. \"I don't always defend Gerry.\" I said much calmer than I did before. \"It's like you do. I see the way you still look at him like you still want him.\" I gave him a look like he was crazy. \"I don't want him.\" \"Yeah...right...\" He grumbled, shaking his head. \"You don't want us to become public because of the backlash, but you didn't mind when you dated Gerry for everyone to see.\" He starts to walk ahead of me. I stopped walking for a second because I felt hurt. That he sees me in that way. Then, we see Sunshine walking down the street with an angry and upset Petey. Louie, Blue, and Rev were with them. Curiously, we went to check what was up. \"You pull some crap like that, you better be able to back it up!\" Petey exclaimed to Sunshine. \"Let's go man.\" \"Why don't you just cool out? Cool out!\" Blue was trying to calm Petey down. \"What happened?\" Julius asked them being completely lost and confused just like how Gerry, Alan, and myself was. They're walking away, and Julius was going with them. I don't bother to ask Julius to stay with us. Maybe we all just needed to cool off.[Chapter 9] \"What happened back there, Ronnie?\" Gerry asked him as the five of us were walking down the sidewalk. I knew Gerry was being serious because he wasn't even goofing around by calling him Sunshine. He called him by his actual name. Sunshine sighed, and look disappointed with himself. \"I really didn't know it was going to happen. It's the seventies, and by now we should get over this racism stuff, right? So, I took the guys to this place I know, and I guess the owner of the store don't allow blacks in. I didn't know it until I talked to the owner. Petey was the main one who got hurt and offended and...you guys saw what happened.\" \"It's okay, man,\" Alan said to comfort him. \"You really didn't know.\" \"I didn't know why Petey felt offended. The owner didn't even let me in.\" \"Why not?\" I asked in a ridiculous tone. \"I'm just a hippie boy from California.\" He sighed. \"They'll get over it eventually.\" Gerry said not being bothered by it. \"Why don't we get to eat or something? I am kinda hungry.\" I said. \"Sure,\" Gerry smiled, and we went off to eat somewhere. It was Sunday the next day. I told Daddy I was going to hang out with my friends, but I'm actually going to be with Julius. I gave him my home phone number, and he called to tell me he's ready. He'll be coming over to my house. Daddy didn't mind that I hung out with his team players, but it would bother him if I dated any of them like I had with Gerry. He knew Julius was coming over. They talked for a while when he was there. Not about football, but a normal conversation. We're going to his house down at The Berg. \"Did Gerry show up to play basketball with you and the other guys?\" I wondered. That happened sometime around this morning. \"No,\" He shook his head, and he was pissed off about that. \"I kinda figured he wouldn't.\" \"Maybe something came up...\" I reasoned. \"And he didn't tell me about it?\" He doubted, and shook his head again. \"At least say no if you don't wanna come.\" I could tell this issue was getting him angry, so I rather not talk about it anymore. \"Let's have another topic...\" We talked on the way the way to his house. I was nervous, and actually, excited to meet his family for the first time. That's what this visit was about. Julius parked his car at his house, and we walked outside to the front door. \"If Coach knew I'm at the Berg...\" I groaned as my anxiety grew. I'm thinking about his reaction because he never knew. \"It'll be okay, Angela,\" He comforted. \"I'll deal with your old man.\" That's like how Gerry was. Being confident about how him dating me wouldn't interfere with his relationship with my father. Daddy proved that to be wrong. \"Yeah, right. Then he'll work you three times as hard during practices, and be extra harder on you during the games.\" \"I can take that.\" He didn't seem to be bothered by it, but he wouldn't know until Daddy's true colors would come out against him. We entered his house, and there were his parents and sister in the living room watching television. From what I recall, Julius told me once that his parents' names were Charles and Margaret, and his little sister's name was Deanna. Charles was a big man, and Margaret was a beautiful thick looking woman. Deanna was beautiful, too, and looked a lot like her mother. Margaret and Deanna were sitting on the couch, and Charles was on the reclining chair. \"Hello, Julius,\" Margaret greeted her son as she got up from the couch. Julius hugged his mother and kissed her cheek. She eyed me suspiciously, but I didn't feel scared by her. \"Who is your... friend ?\" She chose her words wisely before making an assumption. \"Angela Yoast. She's one of my coach's daughter.\" Julius answered. \"A coach's daughter?\" Charles said with a chuckle, and gave a look to Julius. \"You're treading on dangerous waters there, son.\" Julius just rolled his eyes and shook his head. \"Hello.\" I took out my hand for her to shake. \"Hello, dear,\" She greeted me warmly as she's shaking my hand politely. \"I made brownies earlier from scratch. The both of you may have some. Your father and sister ate quite a few.\" \"Thanks, Ma.\" Julius said as he led me into the kitchen. \"Is Angela your girlfriend?\" Deanna asked obviously picking on her older brother, but it did scare me a little if she figured it out already. \"Deanna, shut up!\" Julius exclaimed back at her. \"Not now, you two. We have a beautiful guest here.\" I tried not to blush at Margaret's kind words. We ate a couple of brownies, and washed it down with milk. Then we went to Julius' bedroom. He closed the door behind us. \"Sorry about my sister.\" I heard him mumble. I giggled. \"It's okay. You know I have a little sister, too. I know how annoying they can be.\" \"Your sister is feisty for her age. I think she can beat me up one day.\" I laughed. \"That does sound something like Sheryl would do. She wanted to kick Gerry's ass when we broke up. She thought he hurt me.\" \"I would definitely pay to see Gerry get his ass beat by a ten year old.\" He said with amusement. \"She's nine and a half. She'll get mad if you have her age wrong.\" \"Got it.\" He smiled, and put Motown music on his radio. Julius laid on his bed, and wanted me to lay with him, so I did. I was close to his body, and I just look around at the posters in his bedrooms. Posters of his favorite players and musicians. We were talking about anything, and when we stopped, Julius began to kiss me. My arms wrapped around his neck. Eventually, things between us got heated, and we made out on his bed. The both of us stopped when we had to get air. His forehead rested on mine as he was on top of me. \"I...I don't want us to move too fast. We can go slow.\" I told him. I never had sex before, and I'm not sure if I'm ready for that with him. I definitely won't have sex with him right now because his family was still in the house. \"Okay. We'll go slow.\" He was kissing my lips again while going at an extremely slow pace, and his mouth was going down to my neck. It was nice, but it did give me a crave more of him. \"Julius...\" I said his name to stop him. He chuckled. \"Okay, okay. I get it.\" \"Good. But, um, you may continue what you were doing before.\" I said being shy. \"Okay.\" He smiled, and began kissing my neck. We just began fooling around in bed, and our hands were roaming everywhere on each other's bodies... Next Saturday, the Titans had an away game at Herndon. I didn't go. Instead, I was with my best friends, Lydia and Michelle, going to an ice cream parlor. The three of us were walking down the sidewalk. \"Hey, Angela, is Alan single?\" Lydia asked me. \"I think so. Why?\" I wondered. A devilish smirk came onto her face. \"Cause I wanna ask him out.\" \"Really?\" I was really surprised. \"You do?\" \"Lydia always had a crush on Mr. Alan Bosley.\" Michelle teased. \"Huh...you and Alan,\" I contemplated. \"I never saw that coming.\" \"You don't know me that well then.\" Lydia replied flippantly. I rolled my eyes. \"I guess I did know you two always bickered at each other. I never thought anything of it.\" \"Are you really going to ask Alan out?\" Michelle asked. \"When the time is right...yeah.\" Lydia answered. \"How about you, Angela? Why don't you date again?\" Michelle asked. \"Yeah, that way we can go on a double date,\" Lydia was excited. \"That would be fun!\" \"I don't know...\" I said sheepishly. A part of me wanted to tell them the full truth. In a way, it was like I'm living a double life. \"C'mon, Angie. Why not go out with Ronnie Bass?\" Michelle said with delight. \"He's the hottest one on the team! Don't tell me he's gay or something.\" \"Well...\" I chuckled. \"There's a funny story about that, but, ummm...\" I don't think I should exposed what happened in the boys locker room during football camp. Sunshine and Gerry would most likely hate me if I told anyone. \"How about you and Adam? How are you guys doing?\" \"We're doing fine. Don't change the subject,\" Of course she knew what I tried to do. \"You haven't dated anyone since Gerry.\" \"Well...um...that's a lie.\" I said as we approached the ice cream parlor. \" What ?\" Lydia and Michelle said together. We entered the place and got our ice cream. We're all eating it on a cone. There was an empty bench for us that we took. \"Angela Christine Yoast, you are not dating someone behind our backs, are you?\" Michelle demanded. I licked my chocolate ice cream and answered honestly. \"I am.\" \"Well, who is it?\" Lydia asked with interest as if she's getting major gossip. \"Um...it's Julius. Julius Campbell, from the football team.\" I revealed. I tried to mentally prepare myself for their reactions. \"Julius Campbell...you mean that... ugly black guy ,\" Lydia said his race as a whisper. \"On the football team?\" \"That's the one,\" I said with no shame, but deep down inside of me, I'm feeling it. \"And he's not ugly.\" I added to defend my boyfriend and to give her the truth. I saw Julius shirtless once at his house; he's definitely not ugly, and has magnificent abs. \"I can't believe you're dating a black guy, Angela,\" Michelle said in disbelief. \"I think you can do better than him. I mean, they're always the one who's causing the riots and shootings around here. And you're dating one of them?\" \"Julius is not like that. He's just like us with a different skin color. Can't you guys see beyond that?\" I asked the both of them. But all I get was dead silence. \"It's one thing that you're dating a black guy, but you've been keeping it behind our backs?\" Lydia asked and she sounds hurt. Now I felt bad. \"I only kept it as a secret because I was afraid of what other people will think of me.\" I confessed. \"I thought you knew us better than that.\" Lydia said. \"Why would you anyway?\" Michelle asked with frustration. \"You're always out on that football field being with all of those boys. And you don't even like football. Now, you're with a black guy who could do...Lord knows what to you. It's like you're going to date all of them on the team. Who else is next? I noticed that Ronnie was flirting with you in the halls the other day-\" I rolled my eyes. \"Ronnie flirts with everyone-\" \"Are you going to steal Alan away from Lydia, too?\" Michelle got angry with me. \"I'm not stealing anyone,\" I said back to her. \"Are you implying that I'm a slut or something? Cause I'm not.\" \"You're probably not a slut, but you act like you are.\" Michelle snapped. She stood up from her seat, and so did I. I'm about to shove my ice cream to her face. \"Okay, guys, stop!\" Lydia tried to be the peacemaker. We did and was going to leave. Our girls night was ended abruptly. Good thing I had my car to drive else. If Michelle did, I'm sure she would just leave me here. I took them home and hated myself for the rest of the night.[Chapter 10] Outside of the house, Sheryl and I were playing basketball. Herman Boone pulled up in his car with his oldest daughter, Nicky. \"How you doing, girls?\" Coach Boone asked us. \"Good morning.\" Sheryl and I chimed together. \"Where's your Dad?\" \"In his office.\" We said together again and gave each other an annoyed look. \"Nicky, you alright?\" He asked to the black little girl. \"Yes, Daddy.\" She answered. \"Okay.\" He said and went inside the house. \"What are you doing?\" Nicky asked. \"Shooting some hoops,\" Sheryl answered and she had the ball in her hand. \"Want to play?\" Sheryl passed the ball to her, but Nicky moved her body aside. She showed us her hands. \"I just did my nails.\" Nicky's fingernails were drying with her pink nail polish. Sheryl gave me a look as if she wanted to be anywhere, but here with the other girl. \"Oh, um, well do you girls want to do something else together?\" I suggested. \"No.\" They answered simultaneously. I sighed not knowing what else to do. I knew they didn't like each other. They did have the same sassy and stubborn attitudes. \"I'm sure you girls can find something else to do while your Dad is here.\" I told them. \"Why can't we keep playing basketball?\" Sheryl complained to me. \"Because I think you and Nicky should get along and become friends.\" \"Yeah, right...\" She grumbled. \"I'm just here so my Daddy can take me to my friend's house.\" Nicky said in a bored tone. She looked like she wanted to be anywhere, but here, too. \"Okay, well...Sheryl, get the ball and let's keep playing.\" I said, and Sheryl obeyed me. After the Boones left, I made the basketball into the hoop. When Sheryl had it, I tried to get the ball from her, but it slipped through my hands. The ball dribbled across the macadam, and it was Daddy's feet. He picked the ball up. \"Hey, girls.\" He greeted us. \"Hi, Daddy.\" We said together. \"So, Sheryl, Coach Boone said that you are welcomed to be over at their house. Nicky would like that a lot, and I think it'd be great if you do.\" \"Do I have to?\" She groaned. I could tell this won't go over very well. It did make me confused, but of the girls' interaction earlier. They gave me the vibe that they don't like each other at all. \"Yes,\" Daddy said in a no nonsense tone. So, we knew he was very serious. Sheryl knew better than to argue with him. \"Is her skin color what bothers you?' \"No. It's nothing like that. I ain't prejudice. It's just that we don't have anything in common. I asked her if she'd like to play basketball with us, but her stupid nails were wet with that ugly nail polish of hers.\" She grumbled. \"Maybe Nicky can give you a girly make over.\" I teased her which she gave me a glare. \"Why can't I go to Marie's house instead?\" Sheryl begged. Marie was Herb Tyrell's daughter who was my little sister's age. They were close because of how our fathers worked together with football. \"Sheryl, the arrangement has already been settled.\" Daddy said sternly. Sheryl was angry, and stomped her away into the house. He sighed tiredly. That play date didn't go well like I thought it wouldn't. \"She'll get over it.\" I waved it off not concerned by my little sister's tantrums. \"I know. Tensions are rising high with the race mixing.\" \"I see that at school.\" I understood. \"Any fights break out?\" He wondered. \"Not a lot, but sometimes. Mostly the guys on the football team tried to stop it while the other kids encouraged them to beat the snot out of each other.\" I informed him. I was proud at the Titan boys for that. \"At least they're setting a good example.\" He approved. It made me think... What if I told my father about me and Julius dating? \"Um...Daddy?\" \"Yes, sweetheart?\" He passed the basketball to me, and I was nervously playing with that with my hands. \"What do you think of me dating a...dating a black guy?\" I asked being genuinely curious. \"I wouldn't think of anything differently. Depends on who it is.\" He answered coolly. \"It's Julius.\" I revealed nervously. \"Hm...Julius?\" I nodded. \"You want to date Julius?\" \"No. I'm - I'm already dating him. Since football camp.\" \"So, it's true...\" Daddy mumbled to himself, but I heard him. \"What do you mean?\" \"Ray said there was something going on between you, too, that he didn't like, but he wasn't sure about it. He said that I should keep an eye on you two. I did, but didn't think anything of it. Now, everything makes sense.\" He explained. Ray dropped hints about Julius and I. He knew I'm dating Julius, and decided to go about his way to expose my relationship to my father?! I could kill him! \"Ray told you?\" I asked feeling betrayed. \"Yes. I don't mind, Angela, but why didn't you tell me first?\" He asked sounding hurt. \"I was afraid of what you think of me...of us,\" I answered sheepishly. \"I knew that you're going to give Julius a rough time like you had with Gerry.\" \"Of course I would because you're my daughter. It's my duty and job to protect all of my girls. I'll have to give a talk to Mr. Campbell about you.\" \"Let me talk to him first. You know, to warn him.\" I joked with a half smile, but really, I also wanted to tell him what Ray did. \"Okay.\" He smiled in agreement. \"So, you really don't mind?\" I asked just to be sure. \"No, Angela. Not at all. Actually, I was thinking if there was any black man on the team you should date it would be Jerry Harris.\" \"Rev?\" I said his name with amusement. \"Why?\" He shrugged. \"He's a church man. He loves the Lord. You don't see a lot of that with the young boys in these days. At least he would have some boundaries.\" I laughed. \"I have to tell him that he has your blessing to date me if Julius and I don't work out.\" \"I was thinking we could go to his church someday,\" Daddy said thoughtfully. \"It's a church for black folks, but he did offer us to go. That's something we might do.\" At school, the girls were flocking by a window to watch Sunshine doing his Tai Chi. Just like I predicted, he was getting the girls' attention. I passed them by as I rolled my eyes, but I noticed Sarah, and her friends stopped me, and pulled me closer to the window. \"Ronnie Bass is on the football team, right?\" Sarah asked me. \"Yes, Sarah.\" I sighed. \"He's not dating anyone, is he?\" Lucy asked hopefully. \"No, I don't think so.\" All of those girls were relieved. \"What position does he play?\" Jen asked. \"He's the Quarterback.\" All of the girls sighed dreamily. Of course it was every girls' dream to date the Quarterback of the football team. I never cared about dating any one from the guys about their positions. Julius' position was the left outside Linebacker. \"He's perfect, isn't he?\" Sarah asked. \"What ya'll staring at old Sunshine for?\" Petey asked from behind. He was surprised to see me. \"Angie, you're here? Don't tell me you have a thing for Mr. Sunshine here?\" \"I don't, but he already has a fangirl club bigger than you.\" I smirked. The bell rang, and we walked upstairs for our next classes. I was hearing that Petey was trying to put the moves on the other girls. He kept trying to make the point that Sunshine was from California, but those airheads didn't get it. I wanted to warn him not to flirt with Sarah because she has a boyfriend. I tried to weave my way through the people to get him. \"Uh, Petey? You might not want to-\" I got interrupted by Sarah's boyfriend. \"You talking to my girl?\" Richard threatened. \"I don't see any livestock around here, so I don't know what you're talkin' 'bout.\" Petey remarked. Then it exploded into fight by Richard slamming Petey to the lockers. All the guys came either to defend or join in the fight. Me and the girls were yelling at them to stop. \"Petey, get these girls out of here!\" Julius yelled at him once he was freed. \"Get out of here!\" Petey exclaimed at us, and most of them, but I stayed behind just to see if Julius would be okay. The boys kept throwing punches, and slamming them into lockers. \"I'm not leaving!\" I refused. \"Ange, please!\" \"No!\" The fight was still continuing for a while, so Petey used his body to block me for my protection. But I pushed him out of the way with annoyance because I knew better than to get into that mess, and most importantly, I'm able to take care of myself. A part of me wanted to be in the fight, but a punch would knock me out within seconds. When I kept seeing Julius getting punched and shoving around, even by his own people, that was all it took for me to snap. Another black guy punched Julius in the face, and another one was about to hit him, but I ran in between of them. \"Angela!\" I ignored Petey's shouting at me. \"Stop!\" I yelled at the black guy who was about to punch Julius again. My arms were out to protect my boyfriend. All of those black guys did stop as if they didn't see anything like it. It was like they saw an alien or something. I guess it did look weird to them. A white girl coming to a black guy's defense? \"What are you doing here?\" Julius demanded as he forcefully turned me around. He had a tight grip on my shoulders. \"Where's Petey so I can kill him for-\" \"They were beating you up,\" I answered. \"You think I'm just gonna stand by and watch?\" Julius' angry face changed to being somewhat calm, but his eyes showed confliction. I looked at the others, and didn't realize the whole fight had stopped, too. Even Gerry was shocked that I came in the midst of the fight for Julius. I saw he was having a nose bleed, and that made me nervous and worried for him. \"Looks like you went to the zoo and made some new friends, Bertier.\" Richard sneered as he and everyone else dispersed. \"Oh, big smart guy, huh?\" Gerry called back to him. It was just Gerry, Julius, Petey, and I in the middle of the hallway from that crazy scene. \"I thought I told you to get the girls out, Petey.\" Julius snapped to him. \"I did, but I couldn't to Angela. It was like trying to have a lion on a leash. It's impossible.\" Gerry and I chuckled at that analogy. \"That's true.\" Gerry smirked. \"You should go to the nurse,\" I told him. \"Your nose is bleeding.\" \"Yes, Mom.\" He teased me, and I glared at him. \"Are you okay?\" I asked to Julius worriedly. My eyes were checking his face for any injuries. \"I'm fine,\" He assured me. \"Are you?\" \"Yeah.\" We smiled lovingly at each other, and held both of each other's hands. We forgot everything existed for a moment. \"Is there, uh, anything, heh, going on between you two that I should know about?\" Petey asked awkwardly. I forgot he was with us, and so was Gerry still here. \"Um...\" I hummed nervously. Then Julius wrapped an arm around my shoulders, and pulled me closer to him. No words were needed to be said. Petey already got the message. \"Oh... oh ! Seriously? You and her? Okay, that's cool,\" Petey was surprised, and I smiled in amusement at his reaction. He gave me a flirtatious playful look. \"They always did say chocolate is sweeter than vanilla.\" I burst out laughing then. \"Really, man?\" Gerry said with a little irritation. \"Did you know about them?' He asked him. \"Yeah.\" \"Don't tell anyone. Not yet.\" I pleaded to Petey. \"Why don't you want anyone - ah, I guess I do get why. People around here can be too judgmental.\" \"We should get to class.\" I told them, but Gerry went to the nurse first. Julius dropped his arm from my shoulders at his side. I knew why he did it because that I wanted our relationship to be a secret. I wished he would have had his arm stay right there, though. I'm thinking that we should start to date in public now.

Claire is my character however so please don't take her (without my permission) enjoy~ I am born by both heaven and hell, both God and Satan. My true father is God but I was born to a demon, a demon who's husband is Satan. I am raised up believing I am a full-blood demon, a Succubus. Although I am one, I never had the thought of going into a man's dream and violating him, it just isn't my nature, especially at my age, 10. I gaze around my familiar room and climb off my bed. \"Daddie!\" My father walks in, his feathered wings and gentle features masking what he truly is, the lord of demons. \"Yes Claire?\" I run over to him and hug him, wrapping my small arms only half way around him. He laughs and picks me up against him, \"what do you want?\" \"Can we walk around?\" I look up at him and give my best puppy-dog face and he grins. \"Sure Angel.\" I squeal in happiness and wiggle in his arms, my tail wagging quickly. My father sets me down and takes my small hand in his, \"where is Royal?\" \"He's over there.\" I point to the corner by the door and my dog trots out of his bed and over to me, leaving a trail of fire behind him from his feet. Fire coming from his eyes, tail and around his ankles. Black leather wings sprout from his back and fold neatly on his back. He licks my face, wagging his tail as he does it. I giggle and wrap my arms around his neck and rub my head on his. He barks and wags his tail more. \"Come Claire.\" My father moves out of my room and out into the hall. Royal moves under my legs and picks me up onto his back and walks out of he room. I giggle and hold onto his neck. My father, Royal and I walk through the hallway and out of our house. We walk around for a while and come to a house. Royal trots over to it and I can see inside through a window, a boy with leather wings and white fuzzy hair and a younger one with straighter black hair with black feathered wings. The older one is hanging what looks like a necklace above the younger ones head, grinning while the younger tries to jump for it. \"What are those?\" I look at my father. \"Oh, thees are just some Galileuses. They think they are demons.\" he laughs,\"the other demons are planing to exterminate them tonight.\" \"Exterminate?\" \"Yes, kill them off.\" He watches the two children through the window. I whimper, \"why?\" \"They are a weak specie anyway.\" He moves away from the house and walks away. Royal follows him. I frown and watch the house as we walk away and begin thinking about the two boys. Hope you liked the first chapter! If you'd rather read the Creeper's POV this is the link s/9469439/1/Bound-By-Blood-Axel-s-POV[Chapter 2] Royal jumps onto my stomach and prances around on it, barking happily. \"Royal...\" I groan out and pick him up off my stomach and set him down. He watches me with his light blue eyes, wagging his tail and panting with his adorable little tongue hanging out. Smirking, I pick him up and climb off my bed. He cuddles in my arms against my chest and wags his tail as I walk down my stairs and out to my kitchen. Tomorrow is the day Ava and I go to Taggart's farm to see their 'Bat from hell', I smirk to myself, I'll be the judge of that. Royal wiggles out of my arms and lands on his dog bed at the bottom of the stairs. I hear a knock on the door and walk over to the door and look out it to see Ava standing on my door step. I unlock the door and open it and Ava walks in and hugs me. Hugging her back, I laugh \"hi to you too.\" She moves away from me and ruffles my hair, grinning, \"howdy do there.\" \"Howdy?\" I giggle. \"Yes, howdy.\" She smirks at me. \"So, have you found anything else out about at bat guy?\" \"Actually, no, but I did find pictures.\" She takes my hand and pulls me to the living room and sits me down on my couch and sits next to me. She pulls out her smartphone from her pocket and turns it on and pulls up her internet. \"Look.\" I take her phone and look at the picture of this creature. \"Well. That looks very, interesting.\" I admit. \"Ugly thing isn't it?\" Ava cringes in disgust. \"Yeah.\" I lie. I watch the phone more, hes not ugly. I mean, not really since he is super thin I guess it kinda makes him look odd. I pinch the phone's screen and zooms it into his face and my eyes widen. There are things on his face, all bundled together like a beehive on his face. Except, its not a beehive and there are no bees. Royal jumps up onto the couch besides me and looks at the phone and begins growling. I have had Royal since I was a child, my father breeds hellhounds and gave me one to raise myself. Royal is special though, he has a normal dog form and puppy form, a husky and wolf hybrid, which is what he is in right now. \"Royal, its alright.\" I pet his head and he growls at the screen louder. \"Whats wrong with him?\" Ava asks. \"I don't know...\" I look at the screen and back at Royal, he obviously doesn't like the picture. I turn off the phone's screen and hand it back to Ava and she slides it back into her pocket. Royal stops growling and lays across my lap. I sigh and rub his head. For some reason the man in the picture looks oddly familiar. Maybe I have met him before, and that explains why Royal is growling at it, but why? \"Well, I'll catch you later. Then we can go see that thing tomorrow.\" She pets Royal's head and climbs off the couch and leaves. I climb off the couch too and go out of my house. I make my wings appear and spread them, they are blood red with pink on the tip of each feather and also have speckles on them that looks like golden glitter. I fly up into the air and fly around my house and into the bright blue sky. Axel's POV story: s/9469439/1/Bound-By-Blood-Axel-s-POV[Chapter 3] Ava comes back to my house the next morning. We both get ready and head out at sunset to my dark purple convertible challenger that has dark pink stripes across the hood and trunk. We slide into the seats and drive to Taggart's farm. It takes about an hour to get there and I park in front of the barn. We both get out and go into the barn to be stopped by a 30 year old man, Jack Jr. \"This is where the creature is right?\" The man nods, \"yep.\" He jerks his head toward the sign above the barn saying 'Bat out of Hell. Look $5 Photo $10', \"five bucks, each. You take any pictures and that's ten more bucks.\" Ten dollars for a picture? Ha! Yea right. We both take five dollars out of our pockets and hand it to him. We walk in to see the same creature that was in the pictures hanging up on the wall. His skin is shrunken into his body and almost appears as if he has no organs at all. The skin things around his head looked like they were in the picture, bundled up around his face. His wings are leather, spread out against their will and all his body parts are tied to the wall with rope. The arms and legs are tied down against the metals bars behind him, making him look crucified. \"What is that thing?\" I hear Ava ask from beside me, and it makes me notice the old man sitting next to a large harpoon looking thing. The dog gets up from beside the old man and walks over to me and rubs it's head on my hand. I smile and rub it's head. \"Some type of demon.\" The old man says. I look back up at the creature, no... Not a demon, something else. \"How did you kill it?\" \"Home-made harpoon, along with stabbing it through the heart.\" Jack replies while looking at the harpoon next to him. That poor creature... My eyes widen at my own thoughts, why do I feel sympathy for this thing? Well, maybe its because he was just stabbed a lot and shot by harpoons... I take this chance to walk up closer to it and take a picture with my phone, ten dollars my ass... \"It's so weird... and ugly.\" Ava walks over next to me so she is standing under him too. I hear Jack laugh, \"you should have seen it while it was still alive.\" \"Why are you sitting there like that?\" I ask him, \"like you are waiting for something.\" He looks up at the creature, \"just a day, or maybe even a few more hours.\" \"Okay Ava, we should leave now.\" I turn and walk out of the barn, ignoring Ava's grumbling behind me. We get back in my car and i drive back to her house and drop her off. By then it is night time and as I begin driving to my house I past the Taggart farm again. I stop and pull out my phone and look at the picture I took of the creature. Maybe if I sneak in... I drive over to the farm and park a mile away and climb out. I run to the farm and slide inside the barn and see that Jack and Jack Jr. are no where around. A breath of relief flows out of my lungs; I didn't even notice I was holding my breath. Something looks different about him... The skin that was around his face is now pulled back and his wings aren't spread. Then my ears pick up something, something like, breathing. I stare at him in misbelief. No, there is no way he is alive. \"...Hey...\" I say slowly and unsurly. His head flings up and he hisses at me, barring large sharp teeth. I flinch back in response, \"rawr... Fine I won't help you then.\" Blood drips out of his wounds and pools beneath him on the ground, blood that wasn't running before. He seems to ignore me because he moves his arms, trying to get the ties undone. I don't know whats wrong with me, but watching him be in distress like that makes me angry at Jack. I look around the room, maybe there is something I can use to get him down. Hoe? No. Shovel? No. How about a rake? It is crazy enough to work. Grabbing the rake, I walk over to beneath him and stab and pull at the restrains and rip the tie off his wrist. He moves his now freed hand to his his feet and undoes the ties and then his wrist. He digs his claws into the wall behind him and slowly moves down to the ground. I grip the rake tighter, in case he tries to lunge at me or something. He falls down onto his knees and makes a hiss in pain. I set the rake down and slowly go over to him and offer my hand to him. He looks up at me with pale, dead eyes and then at my hand and cautiously takes it. I help him up to his feet and put my hand around his back so he can lean against me and not fall. The sound of footsteps erupts from outside and I hear the creature growl from beside me, he apparently heard it too. I lead him over to a pile of hay and lay him down in the back of it, I sit next to him and watch as Jack and his son run into the barn. They are yelling at each other about how he would come back. I drag the creature out of the barn while the two have their back turns and lay him against the fencing. \"Stay here.\" I tell him and head back into the barn and close the doors behind me. \"What the hell was that?\" I hear Jack say and they both look around frantically. My head sprouts wolf ears on the top of my head and a tail grows out of my butt. My body grows larger and more dog-like as I turn into my werewolf form. I run over to Jack Jr. and tackle him to the ground and begin ripping his body apart, but masking my claw marks with the marks of a rake. Jack's yells in fear fill my ears and I look over at him, covered in blood. I look down at his chest and make his heart stop pumping long enough for him to pass out. After he passes out I let his heart pump again and I turn back to my mortal form. I drag Jack Jr.'s body out of the barn and out to the creature. He looks at the body and begins eating the limbs and organs and rips out his own limbs and organs. He screeches in pain and they grow back in, completely healed. I stare at him wide eyed, \"that is so cool...\" I look at his eyes and notice they are different color, \"wow you don't ever need colored contacts do you?\" He looks up at me and smirks. He stands up and walks away from me. \"Your welcome...\" I say after him and go out to my car and drive back to my house.[Chapter 4] Last night was when I met and freed the creature. I have done more research on him and found out that people call him 'The Creeper'. I shut my laptop and turn from it, sighing. Nothing has told me what he is. Jack said he was a demon, but I could definitely sense that he is not. Something about him though... It just makes me want to go back to him, something familiar about him and kind. However, he obviously didn't feel the same way about me. I run my hand through my bangs of my dark red curly hair and it springs back into place. What is it about him that won't let me get him off my mind? And that grin... I lean back into my chair and bring my leg up to my chest and smirk. Yes, that grin. Probably the most boyish and sexiest grin I have ever seen. I bring out my phone again and look at the picture and compare the picture to my last memory of him. I slide out of my chair and put my phone back in my pocket and go to my bathroom. After turning the shower on and taking my clothes off, I get in and clean off my body and hair. I climb out later and dry off and put on a short white skirt and tight pink shirt. Sliding my phone into my skirt pocket, I go down stairs and to my car. I turn it on and drive around and I stop in front of a factory I haven't seen before. The factory looks old and deserted, I guess it wouldn't be to much trouble to adventure in it. I go into the factory and walk through the water on the ground and at this point, I wish I worn tennis shoes instead of flip flops. The sound of voices makes me stop in my tracks. The voices are coming down from the same hallway I am in, and it sounds like three boys. I walk a little closer and see them, and one sees me and grins. \"Well, what is this? What's a girl like you doing wandering down here?\" The oldest one says, obviously the leader. \"Just. Adventuring, that's all. What are you doing here.\" I back up from them. \"A girl like you shouldn't be down here.\" He replies. His friend moves around behind me and wraps his arms around my waist, \"something could eat you...\" He says in my ear and softly bites my neck flirtingly. I scowl in response and I hear the youngest say, \"guys... We should let her go.. I don't feel good about this.. I want to leave..\" \"Oh shut up you pussy.\" The oldest snarls at him. I watch as the youngest's eyes scan the hallways and then widen in fear and his body stiffen. I put my hands on the boy's hands who is holding me and run my fingers softly against his skin. \"You know...\" I begin, \"you shouldn't touch a lady without permission.\" I grab his wrist and twists it while moving behind him and pins it to his back and he yells in pain, \"its very impolite.\" I whisper into his ear. The leader of the group pulls a pistol out and points it to my head, \"let go of him.\" He threatens. The youngest begins making a stuttering noise and the oldest looks over at him, \"what's your problem?\" His eyes follow the youngest's and his eyes widen as he drops his gun to the ground. I look where they are and see the Creeper's eyes glowing in the darkness. I let go of the boy and hold his shirt and pin him against me so he can't run. The Creeper grins, and I groan slightly at the sight of it. \"Oh fuck!\" The leader shoves the youngest behind him and picks his gun back up and shoots at the Creeper five times. The Creeper growls loudly in pain and drops down and grabs his wrist and yanks his hand off and throws him against a wall. The youngest yells in fear and runs away down the hall. The boy moves down and grabs the gun, he shoots the Creeper three times in the back of the head and four times in the back. He then elbows me hard in the ribs. I scream in pain and kick hard in the crotch, \"so much for being flirty asshole.\" He yells loudly in pain and drops down face first into the concrete and passes out then drowns from the water. I watch the Creeper turn his head and look at me and I stare back at him. He turns away and starts to walk down the hall towards where the youngest ran. \"Wait. Your bleeding pretty badly...\" I say to him and he stops and looks at me. He sits against a wall and puts his hand against the back of his head and closes his eyes, cringing at the pain. I walk over to him and see blood all over his white hair. I kneel by him and try to look at his wound but his hand is over it. He turns his head and looks at me with a look on his face that shows he doesn't want me near him. I ignore the look and lightly move his hand away and look at his wound, \"I'm sure you could just eat some of the guy's head I just killed and you'll be fine.\" I say. He just watches me in return and I let go of him and look at him. He stands up and goes over to the body of the boy and eats part of his head and brain. I look away as he does it, since it is pretty gross. The clinking of bullets hitting the concrete floor makes me turn my attention back to him and I see the bullets laying on the ground. \"Tell me why we keep running into each other.\" The Creeper says. \"Coincidence.\" I watch him, surprised he can talk and is even talking to me. \"Why are you in here.\" \"Because I saw it and wanted to adventure. Why are you in here.\" I ask. \"I live here.\" He says. \"Oh, well.\" I begin, \"that explains it.\" He smirks in response. I watch him, as his gets rid of the bodies and think about how lucky I am that I didn't get raped. \"You should leave now.\" he says to me after he finishes. I look back at him, \"maybe I don't want to.\" \"You should,\" he replies, \"I'm not a good person to be around.\" I walk over to him so I an right in front of him, I reach up and cup his chin and grip it slightly, \"I'm not a good person to be around either.\" He grins in response. \"What.\" I frown. \"You seem very vicious.\" He says sarcastically. \"And you seem very sexy.\" I say slightly sarcastically and smirk at him. \"I hear that I'm ugly way to much to give a shit anymore.\" He grabs me by the neck hard and throws me against a wall and holds me there with his hand on my throat tightly, \"now, are you leaving or not?\" I wince and scowl at him, \"fine.\" He then throws me into the water on the floor and I wince again, \"run out of here human. I'm giving you ten seconds. If you're not out by then. I'll find you in here and kill you.\" I get up, \"your welcome for saving you.\" I then leave the factory, \"asshole.\" Fishing my keys out of my skirt pocket I unlock my car and get in and shut the door. I rest my head against the headrest and close my eyes, then open them when I hear the flapping of wings but I only see nothing.[Chapter 5] I drive away from the old factory and out to a bar in the city. Although I appear to be 18 I have an ID that says I am 21. I walk into the bar and sit at the counter and drink a few drinks. After finishing two, I drive back home and park in my driveway and climb out of my car. Two giant jolts shock through my body and my body begins spazzing and I fall onto the ground, groaning in pain. Everything goes dark as I pass out. My body is lifted and taken away from my house. I hear a growl and flapping of wings before I become conscious. My eyelids slowly rise and I look around to see myself trapped in a large dome inside a building. My body is still weak and asleep, so I rest on the ground for a few minutes until I can feel my body again. I sit up and look around again, there is a wooded area, a lake, a sand pit and a grass field, which I am laying on. The sound of banging erupts around the dome and I turn my head towards the sound. It is coming from the other side of the dome, I get up and go over to it and see the Creeper slamming into the dome's glass. Great... I'm stuck in here with him. But part of me is happy I am stuck with him. Suddenly he roars loudly in pain and falls to the ground and his body begins twitching. I go over to him and drag him over to the wooded area, the dome must have shocked him because he isn't moving at all and all he is doing is staring at the ceiling of the dome. After I pull him under the trees he slowly sits up. I move away from him and climb up a tree to sit on the branch. I hear him growl and roll my eyes in response. I look around the dome once again to see where everything is and how I could possibly escape. Suddenly I hear wings behind me and I turn to see the Creeper flying across the dome. He lands at the sand pit and I hear him growl when I hear something run through the trees beneath me. I look down and see a human running and the Creeper runs after him and tackles him, biting into his neck. I look away and drop out of the tree and move to the grass area of the dome and lay down. Normally I sleep in my underwear, so I sit up and take off my clothes, not caring at all that there are people watching them. I fall asleep with my hand on my stomach. I hear wings flying close to me and the sound of feet landing next to me. The sound of something inhaling like, smelling sounds from my neck. Then I feel a tongue against my neck, a small moan sounds from my neck and I shift in my sleep. The smelling noise moves down my body and stops at the center of my hips. The sound stops and is replaced with the feel of the same tongue, another moan sounds from my throat and it pulls away, leaving me cold and alone.[Chapter 6] I wake up the next night and notice my body is dirty and disgusting. I sit up and stand, taking notice that the Creeper is no where in my sight, but I can perfectly remember someone licking me last night. Shrugging, I walk over to the lake and get completely naked. I test the water with my foot and find out that it is warm so I step in, waist high. The water feels nice. My eyes close and I purr softly and splash water onto my body, rinsing off the dirt and muck off my skin. I also run my hair through my knotted hair and frown, I hate it when my hair is like this. The curls have matted together and formed knots. I continue brushing through my hair with my fingers, trying to separate them and fix my hair. Its not working so well. A few minutes later I give up and rinse off the rest of my body. The water begins to ripple from the side of the lake and I glance over to see the Creeper naked and cleaning the blood off himself. I glance over his nicely sculpted body and bite my lip. I notice what I am doing and force myself to look away from him and growl quietly at my mind. The water ripples more as he moves away from the lake and flies back to the wooded area. I move out of the lake as well and wipe off the water from my body and put my clothes back on. The feeling of eyes watching me makes me look around the dome and search for cameras and find none. I walk over to the grass area and hear the Creeper roar loudly and yell, \"let us out!\" I close my eyes and listen to the surroundings and him slamming against the door. Each slam I can hear the door get weaker and weaker. He slams into it again and roars loudly once again. I sigh quietly and watch him; he slams into the door harder. I walk over to him and put my hand on his shoulder and moves him away from the door. Stepping back from the door, I run full force at it and slam into it hard with my shoulder and leave a large dent without any pain towards me what so ever. I back up again and rotate my shoulder. The Creeper stares at me, wide eyed and I resist smirking. \"You can continue.\" I say and head back to the wooded area. \"What are you...\" I hear him say after me. I turn and look at him, \"none of your concern.\" And look away. The crash of the door slamming to the ground makes me look back at him and the door. The door is now on the ground and the Creeper is breathing hard. \"Let's go.\" I run over to him and grab his wrist and pull him out of the dome and through the building. My senses tell me what hallways leads where and what is a dead end. \"We better hurry. The humans should be coming very soon.\" He says and begins walking quicker. \"I can only navigate so quickly...\" I mumble in response and look around and walk quicker. The sound of people running roars down the hallway, My eyes scan the surrounding hallways and I find a janitor's closet. I yank the door open and pull the Creeper and myself inside and shut the door. The closet is packed with supplies and there is barely enough room for me and Creeper, so my body is pressed against his. I try to ignore the warm feeling spreading through my body from being against him and watch out the crack of the door. Groups of people run through the hall and towards the dome where we just came from. One stops and begins searching around the hallways and inside the rooms. I move away from the door and look around the closet quickly and see one of the large grey trash cans. I yank the bag of trash out and tie it and throw it onto the pile with the others. \"Hurry up and get in.\" I whisper to him and move back. He climbs in and I climb in after him and grab the trash can's lid from next to it and put it on the can. I hush my breathing down so I can listen for the man and lay my head on the Creeper's shoulder so we are more compacted inside the can. Suddenly I hear the flick of the light switch and the rummaging of the man searching through the closet. My heart quickens in fear of being found and I close my eyes tightly as he searches.[Chapter 7] After a few minutes the light switch flicks again and the door shut. I lift my head and breath in deeply, refilling my lungs. My arms move up and hit the lid off the can and climb out of the trash can. The Creeper climbs out after I do and I look through the crack in the door again and see that the halls are empty now. I open the door and venture through the hallways to find the exit. Suddenly I feel arms around me and I am picked up. I flip out at the sudden pick up and look at the Creeper to see him spread his wings and fly away from the building. His wings flap faster as he picks up his pace. I move up slightly and look over his shoulder, down at the building to see the group of people rushing out of the building with guns, shooting at us. One bullet pierces right into my arm and I hiss in pain. The Creeper looks down at me and shifts me in his arms so I am shielded by his body. A bullet hits him in the side and flies out the front of his body and he growls at the pain. Another bullet hits his right wing in the elbow and he howls in agony. We begin spiraling downward and I hold onto him tightly. He holds me against him and moves so his back slams into the ground and I am not hurt. His wounded wing gets torn off his back as we hit the ground. \"Oh man...\" I get out of his arms and pull him over to some trees with a fallen one in the middle of them. A barrow is under the fallen tree. I go over to it and dig at it fast, making a wide tunnel for both of us, I move into it and make a large space for both of us to move in and lay in. After I finish I move out and drag Creeper into the tunnel. He moves over to a wall and sits against it. I go to the entrance and knock it down so the people don't know where we are. Then I pick up some dried roots and wood and rub them together, making a fire. After I make the fire I go over to him and turn him so I can see his back and wound. I rip out some moist roots from the tree above the den and squeeze the water out over the wound, washing most of the dirt out of it. I see his body relax once the water hits his body and I smile. I drop the now dry roots in the fire and get some more. I set them on his shoulder so they don't get dirty from the ground and rip off some of my shirt and drip the water onto the cloth and rub his wound with the cloth. He hisses loudly when the cloth touches his wound. \"Sorry...\" I apologize. I set the cloth down since it is now cleaned out and drip more water from roots onto the wound. A slight purr sounds from his throat and it makes me smile a bit. I lay down close to the fire and watch as he lays on his stomach. The small den is filling with carbon from the fire and our breath rather quickly so I decide to make more smaller tunnels. I sit up and move to the middle of the wall and dig through and make multiple tunnels for the oxygen to come in and the carbon and smoke to go out without making out location obvious. The tunnels are small and spread out and go up to the surface. I clean my hands off on my already dirty skirt and lay back down next to the fire and look at him. \"...Thank you...\" He begins, \"for all of this..\" I smile at him in response, \"..no problem. Thank you for protecting me.\" He smiles a little at my words. I close my eyes and start to fall asleep. I open them again and blink the sleep out of my eyes and begin feeling a sharp pain shoot up my arm. Moving my arm, I look at it and see the bullet wound. Wow, I have completely forgotten about that. The Creeper sits up and moves over to me. Taking my arm lightly, he picks the bullet out with his claws and I wince and groan at the pain. He then puts pressure on the wound. \"I will fix this wound when I can fly.\" He says. \"Okay.\" I reply. He gazes down at my shirt. He reaches down and lightly rips part of my shirt off and wraps it around my wound tightly, making the blood stop coming out. After he finishes, he takes his hands off my arm and I lay it back down. I turn my attention to his eyes and notice they are slightly glowing a beautiful shade blue. He then crosses his arms across his chest and winces then puts them back down, he must have hurt himself by moving his arm while it was healing. We then both lay back down and drift into deep sleep.[Chapter 8] I wake up to the cold darkness engulfing me. A yawn escapes my mouth and I stretch my arms. The fire is out from last night so the only light is from the holes I made to let the carbon dioxide out. My eyes adjust and allows for me to see in the lack of light. I peer over at the creature beside me, who's already awake, and smile. His eyes flick away from mine and onto the remaining grey ashes and blackened wood. I sit up, \"how's your back?\" \"Its fine...\" He replies. I move over to the entrance and dig out a small hole to look out of. \"I don't see anyone. It's probably safe.\" His voice echos out behind me, \"don't be so sure about that...\" \"As much as I love being in such a small space with you,\" I begin, \"I'd like to go outside.\" I hear him chuckle in surprise, \"you like being in small spaces with me?\" A smirk spreads across my face; I'll just let him think about that. I pull the dirt out from the entrance and climb out. \"Be careful of your arm...\" His voice sounds worried. I peer down at my arm where I was shot. I had completely forgotten about it. \"Okay.\" We move deeper into the woods, and out of sight from anyone who could harm us. \"We should find somewhere to stay.\" I suggest, \"hopefully the people won't find us.\" He studies me for a moment and his nose slightly flares, obviously catching a scent. \"Follow.\" He growls out. He begins walking in what I can only figure is the way if the scent. My eyes begin wandering over his back, across his muscles, shoulder blades and rest on the open wound of his lost wing. I stare at it for a little while then glide down his back and finally to his butt. My head tilts a little in interest. I smirk to myself as I watch it sway with his movements. It's not hard to be distracted by his body, since not one inch of his body is covered. I begin to wonder if all his species goes around in the nude. My train of thought gets broken when I look up and see a mansion in front of us. I feel my eyes widen, \"woah...\" \"Something smells good in there...\" He says. I wonder how many servants and maids are in there. The thought makes me grin; I've always wanted a servant. \"Don't kill any maids or servants.\" He studies me, \"if they get in my way I will.\" \"Fair enough.\" I walk to the front door and pull at the knobs to discover the door is locked. \"Wait here.\" The creature says and goes over to a wall if the building. I watch him climb up and slip into a window and out of sight. / After a while I grow tired of waiting and break into the building. The click of the creature's claws echo down the hall and I see him watching me from the stairs. I glance at him and venture around the maison. Sadly, I find no maids or servants. The flapping of his wings found from outside and get more quiet the further he travels away. I travel upstairs and find a room covered in zebra print and pink lace. My eyes widen, \"oh my god it is amazing!\" I run inside and plop down onto the soft bedding. Once again the sound of wings sound and fly to the mansion, then a knock on the my window. I get up and open the window and the creature climbs in. He takes my arm and takes the cloth off the wound and licks it. My body jumps a little at the sudden feeling. \"What was that for?\" I ask him. \"I'm checking for any chemicals they could have coated on the bullet.\" \"Oh.\" \"Stay here.\" He leaves the room and later comes back with a first aid kit. He grasps my arm again and licks the wound and the bleeding stops. I watch as he takes out some cotton and gauze and tends to my wound with them. \"Thanks.\" He nods and glances around my room, \"nice room you found.\" I smirk in response, \"I know.\" His eyes turn back to mine, \"so, I guess you're staying in here then?\" A sense of amusement passes through me, \"yea, why? Do you want me to sleep with you?\" He shrugs in response. I give a little smile, \"alright.\" He lays down as I get up and stifle through my drawers and pull out two bottles, red and pink nail polish. I plop back down next to him and shake up the bottles then open the red and begin painting. The creature cringes and looks at me, \"what is that? It smells horrible…\" \"Nail polish.\" I say as I finish my first finger. \"Why are you putting color on your nails?\" He asks. \"Because they look more pretty.\" I say and finish by putting pink polish over the tip of the nail. \"They don't look any prettier than they did before.\" Amusement washes over me again, \"aw, you think my nails are pretty?\" I smirk at him. He chuckles, \"I guess so.\" I giggle. He attempts to mimic my voice by giving his a slight girlish tone, \"you think my nails are pretty?\" His hand lifts showing long claws. \"Sexy\" I reply and am awarded with a laugh. Suddenly, the best idea in the world crosses my mind. I smirk at the though and pick up a bottle of black nail polish. \"I think they'd look better with black polish.\" Dread passes over his face, \"…but my claws are already black…and no you're not painting them.\" \"Okay. Then pink.\" I pick up the bottle and smile sweetly, \"then we can match.\" \"No. You're crazy...\" He pulls his hands away from me and onto the other side of his body, his left side. I laugh at him, \"nuh uh.\" I lunge for one of his hands and pulls it over to me. \"No!\" He yanks his hand away. \"Yes!\" I try to grab at his hand again but he keeps it away and smirks. I frown, \"give me your hannddddddd.\" \"Nope.\" \"Yes.\" \"No. Give up.\" \"I don't think so.\" I throw myself on top of him and pin him to the bed and grab for his arm. He easily pushes me off and gets off the bed and smirks at me, \"you're so light and weak.\" I frown, \"I'm not weak.\" \"Then why haven't you painted my claws yet?\" He questions. \"Because. Your being difficult.\" I giggle. \"Why don't you use your strength then? If you're so strong.\" He gives another sly smirk. I jump up and pounce on him, knocking him back to the bed and pin his arm against my body. His arm squirming around trying to get free while his laughter fills my ears. I open the pink bottle and paint one of his claws pink. \"Ah! Why would you do that!\" He pulls me off him and gets up. \"Because I'm stronger than you.\" I grin. \"Yeah right.\" He wipes the polish off onto the blanket. \"Hey!\" He laughs in response. I go into the bathroom and retrieve a wet rag and vigorously scrub at the now stained blanket. A frown spreads across my face and I turn around to look at him and throw the rag at him. He catches it before it can hit him and grins. \"Jerk.\" I say and giggle. I've just realized how dirty and disgusting I feel and turn to go into the bathroom. I shut the door behind me and discard my clothes as I turn on the shower to let it warm up. His talons click out of my room and the door shuts; I only figure he has gone up to his room. The water is now warm as I slide into the shower and wash the dirt off my body. I close my eyes and my mind begins to wander and makes me think about the creature. Remembering when I was following him to the mansion; the movement of his muscles and his proud, powerful posture. My mind begins to daydream what it would be like with him in the shower with me, the water flowing over his body, making his fluffy white hair grayish and straight. The warmth of his body as he wraps his arms around me and pulls me-. I open my quickly and shake my head to get rid of the thoughts. My body is now clean as I get out of the shower and dry off. I cover my body with some pajamas I found, light blue short shorts with little pandas on them and a matching blue tank top. I'd prefer the animal to be a wolf though, but this is fine. A screech fills my ears and I notice it's from the creature. My eyes widen and I run out of the room and to the creature's. I shove the door open and run in, \"are you okay?\" I ask, out of breath. The creature looks at me, a new wing sprouted from his back and cloaked in blood, \"yes.\" He replies. \"Good...\" I breath. He smirks, \"my wing is back.\" I turn my attention to his wing and smile. I walk over to his side and look at his wing closer. Finally I leave and come back with a wet rag and begin to clean the blood off his wing. He begins purring at me, so he obviously likes it. I spread the wing's fingers and clean the leather between them. I can feel the pulsing of his blood as his heat rises from the cleaning. He is trying to stifle a moan. The wing becomes clean and I reluctantly pull the rag away. My eyes glide over his chest and on the bumps of his skin. I move my hand up and place it on his chest and begin to rub, felling the tough hide under my soft skin. Why am I so attracted by this? His voice distracts me from the feeling, \"that's not a good idea...\" I gaze up at him, \"what?\" \"To rub my skin with yours...\" \"Oh. I just wanted to feel it.\" I look back down at his chest. \"...My body will react,\" He says slowly and sits back down on the bed, \"go ahead if you want to.\" \"Okay.\" I sit down next to him, \"I'm good, I guess.\" Even though I'm not good. I glance over at his body again. He lays down on the bed and so do I. \"What are you?\" I hear myself say before I really get the chance to think about it. The creature looks over at me, \"tell me what you are first.\" I stare at him, \"human.\" \"No you're not. A human could not dent that door like that without one injury. I was tackling it with all my strength and was barely denting it.\" I sigh quietly and look up at the ceiling, debating on whether I should tell him or not. \"I'm a species called a Galileus…it's a species of gargoyle.\" I hear him say. I finally turn my head and look over at him, \"I'm a Wolcin. Werewolf specie.\" He watches me indefinitely, \"Werewolf? Those things are real?\" \"You're looking at one.\" He sits up, \"show me.\" \"I don't want to.\" \"Alright then.\" With that he lays back down, his back to me. I take this opportunity to cuddle up against his back and plant a kiss on his cheek. He purrs in response, \"what was that for?\" I shrug, \"for saving me from that building.\" \"We saved each other.\" \"Yeah I suppose.\" I fall into a deep sleep a few minutes later, only to be disturbed by a strange wet feeling on my abdomen and heat blowing on it. The sensation goes away a minute later and my sleep continues. ","Summary":" My girlfriend and I don't own the Creeper.

This is my first fanfiction so please be kind and review. Prologue So they all thought I was gay. I guess there are worse things. They thought that long hair and being from California meant I was gay. Some asked, some just hinted but I merely smiled. If I was gay, which by the way I'm not, it wasn't any of their business. The truth is as much as I liked the guys, I missed California. I missed waking up in our little house by the beach. I missed surfing, beach volleyball, and tai chi in the hot beach sun. I missed my friends. Things were so complicated and messy. It has never mattered to me the color of one's skin. That's how I was raised. My parents always taught me that what mattered were ones actions and the content of their hearts. I guess the thing that bugged me the most about being here in Alexandria was the fact that no one truly knew me. They didn't know how I thought or why I acted the way I did. They didn't know that my mom was killed in Africa. They didn't know that because of my dad's job I had traveled all around the world with my dad. He had acted as an ambassador for the military for many years. They didn't know that I had 3 sisters, used to have 4. My eldest sister died the same day as my mom at the hand of natives in Africa. They didn't know that it completely shattered my heart when I found out that they died. I nearly died as well. Now it's just me, my dad, my older sister Susie, and my 2 younger sister's Payson and Vanessa. Susie was 19, Payson 14, and Vanessa 12. I've been screwed up ever since their deaths. I pretend that I'm put together for my sisters and my dad. I know that he needs to have someone to rely on and since Susie started collage I've had to do a lot of stuff for my dad. But what no one knows is that I'm cracking. I don't know how much more I can take. I'm depressed. I use drugs and alcohol to help with the days that it all seems like it's too much. But sooner or later I will crack and I don't think that there will be anyone there to help pick up the pieces.[Chapter 2] I do not own Remember the Titans or its characters/ ideas. This is my first fanfiction so please be kind and review. Chapter 1 Julius Pov It was after the particularly long practice that out of the blue that Petey randomly brought up Sunshine's behavior. To be honest I hadn't really noticed anything until he mentioned it. I don't think any of us did. Sunshine wasn't loud like Petey, or overly helpful like Rev, or cheerful like Blue and Louie. He wasn't goofy like Alan or command attention and respect like Gerry. It got me to thinking. What did we really know about Sunshine? We knew that he was from California and that his dad was in the military. We knew that unlike many of us he never really had a problem with race mixing. He seemed to be very mellow. But we didn't really know him. After Petey's enquiry I started to pay more attention. He had a point. Something did seem off about Sunshine's behavior. What in the world could be going on? I'll tell you one thing I'm gonna find out.[Chapter 3] I do not own Remember the Titans or its characters/ ideas. This is my first fanfiction so please be kind and review. Chapter 2 Rev Pov When had Sunshine become so withdrawn? And how in the world did nobody but Petey notice. I mean, I know Petey and him probably talked more than the rest of us, but how did we not notice? I had always prided myself knowing that I was someone others counted on and would go to for help and yet I failed to see that one of my own teammates was struggling. To be honest I liked Sunshine. He was a good player. He was very accepting of others. Despite the fact that he moved in during one of the most crazy times in Alexandria's history and he takes it all with stride. He was a kind guy. While I personally don't support the idea of homosexuality I didn't want to treat him any different if he was gay. Although that has never been confirmed. As I watched Sunshine act weirder and weirder I couldn't help but become even more worried about my teammate and friend.[Chapter 4] I do not own Remember the Titans or its characters/ ideas. This is my first fanfiction so please be kind and review. I'm sure that you all can tell that I have no idea what I am doing so please, please, please review. If you notice a mistake or have an idea of a way I can make it better than please tell me. Chapter 3 Alan's Pov Wow, could this day get any worse. It was only 10: 30 and already I was wishing it was the end of the day. I slowly slouched further down in my seat and yawned. Yesterday's practice had been brutal. Actually the last couple weeks had become increasingly more brutal. Ever since Petey noticed Sunshine acting funny it had become more and more obvious that something was wrong. Example A: he's been acting out in practice. Getting frustrated and annoyed over the littlest things. Which to some wouldn't be a big deal at all but for Sunshine it was. He was always the calm, mellow, laid back one. But now it was like he was a different person. Example B: he wasn't doing as good at school as he was previously. We were actually in a lot of the same classes. Even now I could see him spacing out. He wasn't paying attention at all. Which was odd because though he wasn't a super amazing student he at least usually paid attention in class. As the bell rang I watched our teacher, Mr. Lionel, stop him and pull him aside. After I exited the classroom, I waited for Sunshine to be done talking to Mr. Lionel. I couldn't hear what they were saying but I could see that he was getting angry. That shocked me. Sunshine never got angry, well if he did he sure didn't show it. What in the world was wrong with my teammate?[Chapter 5] I do not own Remember the Titans or its characters/ ideas. This is my first fanfiction so please be kind and review. I'm sure that you all can tell that I have no idea what I am doing so please, please, please review. If you notice a mistake or have an idea of a way I can make it better than please tell me. Chapter 4 Sunshine's Pov I can't believe Mr. Lionel. What right did he have telling me what to do. \"I'm concerned about you. A lot of your teachers are worried. What's wrong with you lately?\" Why couldn't he just mind his own business? Instead he sticks his overly nose into mine. Which I told him, needless to say he wasn't very pleased with me. He gave me a week's worth of after school detention. Crap. I had practice, which I told him, making it worse. He sent me to the principal where I had to sit there and little to him prattle on about how if I wanted to succeed I needed to change my attitude. Needless to say I was a half hour late to practice where Coach Hard ass Boon chewed me out and then sent me to do laps for the entire practice. Later in the lockeroom the guys kept looking at me funny. I decided to forgo my usual shower and just head home. As I opened the door to my house I could hear Nessa and Payson arguing. I couldn't help but smile. I truly did love my baby sisters. They were 2 of the most spectacular people in the entire world as far as I was concerned. I figured that I better stop them before my dad came home. I hurried over and told them to shut up. I know, I know. I'm a jerk. I just couldn't put up with their arguing today. After my ass move I decided it just might be better if I go to bed. What a day.[Chapter 6] I do not own Remember the Titans or its characters/ ideas.

If you notice a mistake or have an idea of a way I can make it better than please tell me. Chapter 5 Sunshine's pov on his own family My dad, Sergeant William Bass, worked for the army and he was my hero. He always seemed so cool and collected about everything. He and my mom had taught us all from birth that the only thing that really mattered was ones heart and soul. Not their race, religion, color, sexual preference, or how intelligent they were. He was a really easy going guy. And yet he was extremely firm and strong. He instilled in me and my siblings the importance of being respectful. He didn't even complain when Susie decided to instead of heading off to college after she graduated she choose to go on a trip around Europe. Susie was my older sister, she was 19 years old. As a neighbor we used to have said Susie looked like a pretty princess. Golden blonde hair, deep blue eyes; thin but curvy in just the right places. She said she didn't want to start school until she knew what she wanted to do. Meanwhile, while she was traveling it gave her the time and opportunity to work on her writing and cooking skills. She said that she just wasn't sure whether she wanted to go to school to be a writer or if she wanted to go to cooking school. Either way I knew that she would be spectacular at both. Payson was 14 and incredibly sweet and responsible. She had the golden blonde hair like I did and gigantic blue eyes. Her nose small and had a slight upturn. Payson was rather small. She was only 5'3 and couldn't weigh more than 100 pounds. Payson took it upon herself to mother Vanessa which she hates. She loved designing clothes and taking photos. Dad allowed her to try making a lot of our clothes. The key word being tried. Some of her tries turned out rather poorly and others, well let's just say that they were ahead of the times. She tried to copy styles that we had seen around the world but I don't think most places in the states were quite ready for them yet. She used to play piano as well. Used to, but not anymore. As for Vanessa or Nessa as I call her, she's more of a tomboy. She's spunky, feisty, and opinionated. She's a tiny blonde haired, blue eyed 12 year old girl with more personality than a majority of people in this town would call improper for a young lady. My parents used to joke that she was such a tomoy because when I was little I used to pray for God to give me a baby brother. However I never got one so I got the next best thing. Nessa my adorable feminine looking baby sister loved any type of vehicle. She was always trying to convince people to let her tinker with their cars. And when she wasn't trying to take apart our old car she was trying to rescue and adopt every animal she came across. She said that when she grew up she would be a mechanic and a vet which caused many old ladies to frown on. We're not completely sure whether that's just her personality or if it's something else. You see with all of us it tends to be something else. My mom. And my other older sister, Alicia. Why was Susie having such a hard time choosing a career? Because she wanted mom's input. She needed a push from Alicia. Why did Payson no longer play piano? Because Alicia had taught her how to play. How come Nessa refused to listen to anyone and why was she being so wild? Because she wanted mom to be the one to tell her stop being so disobedient. We all needed them. My mom, Grace, was one of the most spectacular people in this world. She had a smile that seemed to light up the entire world. She was strong, smart, compassionate, and kind. She was always trying to help everyone. She had thick, long, golden blonde hair and eyes like an ocean. Dimples, ski slope nose, and long lashes made her look like a model. She was the farthest thing from looking like a typical mom. Me, Susie, Payson, and Vanessa all looked just like her. Alicia would've been 21 years old if she was still alive. She was the only one of us kids who looked like dad. Her long brown hair and chocolate brown eyes always shined with a comforting warmth. Everything about her seemed to draw people in. She always said that she wanted to get married and adopt children from around the world. She had also been trying to become a dancer. And boy was she something. Without Mom and Alicia our whole family dynamic was completely thrown off without them. I missed them everyday and wished that they could still be with us.[Chapter 7] I do not own Remember the Titans or its characters/ ideas. This is my first fanfiction so please be kind and review. I'm sure that you all can tell that I have no idea what I am doing so please, please, please review. If you notice a mistake or have an idea of a way I can make it better than please tell me. I am truly sorry that it has taken me so long to update. I got so caught up in preparing for finals and then taking them and then celebrating that they were done that I either didn't have time or when I did I forgot to work on it. Sorry! Chapter 6 Payson's Pov I can't believe that he told us to shut up. I know that he's not exactly been happy lately but that doesn't give him the right to be a grouch. He's been acting so strange lately. Well, stranger than normal. And frankly I'm quite worried about his change in attitude and what is causing it. I sure hope it's not what I think it is. In the past I could write his attitude off as results of his problems. I don't think he realizes that I know the extent of them. I know Nessa knows nothing about them. But Susie and Dad both know as well. He struggles with drugs and alcohol abuse. He has serious depression problems. For the longest time he was able to keep it secret from all of us though it eventually came out. However he has managed to keep it secret from most of our close friends. How he even managed to keep it secret from us as long as he did is mind boggling. If he's drinking again or doing drugs that means that he is most likely depressed as well. He's been doing good for the last year or so and I hope he's not falling into the cycle again. I needed to know. I need to make sure that he's not getting into trouble. I could deal with Nessa later. This is more important. I'll just wait until he's asleep then take a peek in his room. But for now I should start diner for me and Nessa. Vanessa's Pov UGHHHHH! I don't understand why Payson has to nag me all the time. I'm not a baby. All she ever does is boss me around. Well I'll show her. I don't have to listen to anything she says. So what if Payson says I can't keep the stray dog I found at the park yesterday. I'll just hid him in my room until I can convince dad that I'm responsible enough to have a pet. Ronnie and Susie used to get pets all the time when they were little. And not just normal boring pets but exotic ones. And they were even younger than I am. Maybe I'll sneak out after diner. Payson has her thinking face on. She probably wouldn't even notice if I leave. I watched as Payson went into the kitchen. Quickly and quitly I slipped my converse on and squeezed out the door. Nothing is going to stop me from getting my dog.[Chapter 8] I do not own Remember the Titans or its characters/ ideas. This is my first fanfiction so please be kind and review. I'm sure that you all can tell that I have no idea what I am doing so please, please, please review. If you notice a mistake or have an idea of a way I can make it better than please tell me. I wish I had a good reason for not updating, but the truth is that I don't really have a great excuse. I was pretty busy with school. I did have a lot going on. However that was not the only reason, I also had major writers block. Inside my head I had it all planned out but couldn't for the life of me get it in words. But perhaps one of the biggest problems was that I really don't want to post substandard or poorly written work. I don't want to be one of those stories that you start because the description and concepts seems great but then the lack of writing ability of the author makes it unbearable to read. I want to make sure it's perfect. So sorry about the long wait. Sorry about the long author note. Hopefully you will enjoy the upcoming chapters and I am going to make more of an effort to update. Thanks for reading! Chapter 7 Payson's POV I'm scared. Ronnie isn't himself. Despite the fact that Ronnie is older and tries to hid stuff from me I'm not stupid. I catch a lot more than he thinks. I know about his addiction problems. I also know the signs of when he starts to spiral. I'm scared because I'm seeing the signs of him heading down. Moodiness. His attitude changes minute to minute at times. He's withdrawing from the family. As I walk to his room, my mind races. I have to confront him, I do, even though I'm dreading it. Bracing myself for a fight I slowly open up his bedroom door. My stomach drops. He's not here!? I walk in and notice his window open. Well, crap. Mystery person's POV Gasping for breath. Chest heaving. Sweat glistening. Skin flushed. And yet it wasn't enough. Ignoring the screaming of his muscles he took off again. Legs churning furiously. Got to run it off. Got to make it faster. Focus. FOCUS. Time is lost. Has it been minutes? Hours? Doesn't matter. Losing focus. Lungs burning. Becoming dizzy. Soft grass beneath his knees. Collapsing. Losing consciousness. Sweet Rest.

Thanks for reading! Chapter 8 Petey's POV Joking and laughing, me and some of the other guys approached school, we were stopped short at the sight of an ambulance pulling out of the school parking lot. Later at my locker I heard some girls gossiping. The ambulance was at school because they found a student collapsed on the football field this morning. Football field?! Who would be out there? If they were on the field it was probably a football player. I got a bad feeling in my stomach. I hadn't seen Sunshine this morning. What if he was the one who collapsed?! Oh crap. I got to find the guys. Nobody's POV Unfortunately the guys didn't get to talk till lunch. By then they had all drawn the same conclusion. As they talked at lunch they decided that Coach Boone would probably know what was going on. \"Hey coach. We were wondering something. Do you know who was found on the field?\" Gerry nervously said. The others behind him shifted nervously. Coach Boone looked up from his paperwork. He didn't know what to tell his team. Should he tell them the truth? Should he tell them that it was Sunshine who was found on the field? But if he told them it would open up a huge jar of worms. They would continue to ask questions. In the last month so much had happened. He and Coach Yoast were brought into the situation by the school principle and guidance counselor. Colonel Bass had come to talk about Ronnie and his behavior. Beyond concerned they had tried to talk to him with no success. However it wasn't until this morning, the truth of Ronnie's drug and alcohol abuse issues came to light. Needless to say they were all shocked. Nobody could believe that it had gotten that bad without anyone catching on. This morning when he was found he had large amounts of drugs and alcohol in his body. He was taken to the hospital. \"Coach? Coach!?\" \"What?!\" Boone snapped back to attention to see everyone staring at him. He had spaced out. \"We'll talk about this later guys, ok? I don't want to speak out of turn or give false information so I need to make sure my facts are straight.\" Boone replied. He could see the boys were disappointed. \"You all better get back to class.\" Julius's POV The coaches are hiding something from us. We're not stupid. Something big is going on and whatever it is it has to involve Sunshine. Nobody saw him today. The way coaches acted worried me. They actually canceled practice. They NEVER cancel practice. What in the world is happening? Yoast's POV \"We have to tell them. They know something's wrong and by now have worked out that it involves Sunshine. We should be honest with them. Stop any chance of rumors.\" \"How are we supposed to break news like this? We tell them and we can't take it back. Besides, Sunshine should be the one to tell them.\" Boone argued. I stayed quiet. Boone had a point. Was it fair of us to just tell them without knowing if Ronnie was ok with it? It's not our secret to share.[Chapter 10] I do not own Remember the Titans or its characters/ ideas.

Thanks for reading! Chapter 9 No - One's POV Nobody could think of anything to say. Drugs? Alcohol? How the hell did we miss that? Gerry's POV I'm supposed to be the captain. I should have caught this. And now the entire team is going to have to deal with it. But I have no idea how to. Rev's POV I think we're in over our heads. But Ronnie is our teammate, our friend, and our brother. There must be something we can do to help. But how do we convince him that we care? Alan's POV It's scary. Ronnie's…. problems. You don't hear much about drug abuse in a town like Alexandria. It's hard to imagine Ronnie being a drug addict. But apparently his is. Coach and Boone say that we should do our best to help him. Buy I don't see what we can do for him. I mean, we didn't even notice that he was unwell. Maybe this is just too big of a problem for group of High School footballers. No-one's POV \"Guys, I know this is a lot to take in. I know that you may think that there is nothing that we can do to make this better. And there may not be much we can do but we let him know that we support him, that we are going to be there to help him get better.\" Boone said. \"Now normally I don't ever cancel practice; however, I think that maybe we all need the day off. Be here tomorrow morning ready to practice though.\" The players filed out of the locker room, silent, the jovial atmosphere lost to the day's events.[Chapter 11] I do not own Remember the Titans or its characters/ ideas.

Thanks for reading! Chapter 10 Sunshine's POV I woke to the steady beeping and the smell of cleanliness. I was in a hospital. I glanced over and noticed my dad sleeping on a chair next to me. My stomach turned over. Crap. I've always been so careful to always know and stay within the limit of what I could handle. Careful to never show the cracks. And here I was, stuck in a hospital bed, nowhere to hide, no way to escape. How was I supposed to explain everything to my family, my friends? Tears stung my eyes. So much for being responsible. What am I going to do? The cracks are growing and I don't think I'll be able to patch them up this time I thought as my vision faded, surrendering myself back to the darkness. The next time I woke it was to my father's voice. He told coaches what had happened. And they told he team. Now everyone knows. Well, everyone who matters. How in the hell am I supposed to face them? How am I supposed to explain? I don't want them to hate me. I get to go home today. I'm not looking forward to it. Being at the hospital has actually been a relief. Apparently, my dad feels like it's not appropriate to yell at me in the hospital so I've managed to avoid awkward talks about my issues. Plus, my friends have been told by the nurses that I need my rest so I haven't had to face them either. If I wanted to stop drinking and doing drugs, then I would. But I don't want to. I would just have to be more careful. Slowly I eased off the bed. Wincing, I stretched and slowly grabbed my jeans off the chair next to the wall. Slipping them on after a week in the uncomfortable, breezy hospital gown felt foreign to my skin. Putting my t-shirt on brought to my attention a myriad of muscle aches that were previously silent. I didn't want to even try to put my tennis shoes on so I decided to just barefoot it. Slowly I made my way out the room, down the hall, and out into the parking lot; my dad's car parked at the curb. Time to face the music. The ride home was silent, awkwardly silent. Sergeant being this quite is never a good thing. I almost wished the ride would last forever. Unfortunately, it didn't. walking into house my stomach turned. It was time to talk. ","Summary":" I do not own Remember the Titans or its characters/ ideas.

I've always loved this movie and have watched it WAY too many times to be healthy. Anyways I decided to try to write a fan fiction for it! Hope you enjoy! Disclaimer: I own none of the original character, that all belongs to Disney! A Black and White Film: A Titans Documentary Chapter One: Country Roads, Take Me Home Driving down the winding roads towards Virginia, a shiny black Chevelle could be seen speeding on by. In said car, was a father and his only daughter who was busy holding up one of her babies, a Canon AV-I, shooting photos of the amazing view from her opened window. It was a special gift from her father, especially since it was the only of its kind out at the time. Photography was her passion, and she was pretty dang good at it too. \"Daddy, you still ain't told me how you managed to snag one of these puppies. They ain't even been released yet!\" The young girl asks as she lowers her camera gently down on her lap while glancing over to her father. Said man was quite good looking for his age, he seemed to hold a greaser look from the 50s. His dark hair always slicked up and back into a stylish pompadour, his bright green eyes still held a childish and slightly mischievous glint to them, and his clothing consisted of a simple white t-shirt and dark jeans. \"Now you know I can't go revealing all my secrets, Doll.\" He answers calling his daughter by her beloved nickname with a slight Brooklyn drawl to his voice, much like his daughter's. She smiles at him before shaking her head and laughing lightly at him. \"Did you do a trade for little ol' me? Come on Pops, I ain't clueless!\" She teases while pushing a strand of hair behind her ear. Much like her father, Doll (or Dahlia) was quite the looker. She had a full head of hair the color of rich dark chocolate that once waved beautifully down to her mid-back. However, due to the recent move she decided to cut most of it off so that her hair now stopped just above her shoulders. New place, new look she had told herself. She had kind hazel eyes upon her heart shaped face, and lovely lips that seemed to be in a constant pout. She was dressed nicely in a fitted white top and flowing dark blue high waisted skirt that went down to just below her knees. She had wanted to dress more appropriately so she could perhaps blend in a little more. Something told her shorts and a tank top were more for the beaches of her previous home rather than the conservative environment they were heading to. \"If you already know then why ask? Of course I did a trade! I always get the best for my baby girl.\" He barks out while reaching over to mess her hair up causing her to slap his hands away. \"Pops? Is it nice in Virginia?\" Dahlia asks once things settled down between the two. They had lived in California for most of her life and she had to admit, she really liked it there. She wasn't totally against moving to Virginia, but she had heard that people there weren't exactly the nicest ones you could meet. \"Of course it's nice,\" her father answers hesitantly. Receiving a certain look from his daughter he lets out a resigned sigh and grips the steering wheel a little tighter, \"I'm not going to lie dahlin'… Things are different here. They aren't as open minded as us folks back in California.\" \"What do you mean?\" Dahlia asks glancing up from her previous task of fidgeting with one of the dials on her new baby. \"The black community here in Virginia aren't as accepted as they were back home, hun,\" he warns cautiously. She seems to furrow her darkly colored brows at the thought as she glances down to her own lightly colored skin. She really didn't like where this was going. \"So… They're racist,\" she states bluntly. Her father chuckles lowly, mumbling something along the lines of, \"some of the worst I've ever seen\" under his breath. \"Don't worry honey. They're integrating the school this year, which I thought was the perfect opportunity for you,\" he announces with a smile causing his daughter to look at him questionably. \"I heard they're making a football team.\" He glances quickly down at the camera in her lap. She smiles slowly catching her father's point, \"I think they might need a little help with integratin', don't you?\" He asks causing his daughter to laugh and agree with him 100%. Football just happened to be another of her passions. Her two older brothers, who were now away at college, both played football in high school and she just happened to be their own personal paparazzi. Once the two arrived at their new house, Dahlia took the time to look around at the place she would now call home. All the houses on the block appeared similar to their own, and she slightly wondered how on Earth she would be able to tell which one was her own as she walked home from school everyday. \"Hey!\" Someone shouts, snapping her out of her own thoughts. She squints her large hazel eyes and locates the voice coming from across the street. She catches a young man waving at her kindly, which she's quick to answer with a smile and wave of her own. Seeing her response he stops to glance both ways before jogging across the street over to her. When he grows a bit closer Dahlia can see that the boy was quite tall and attractive in a sort of All-American way. He had blonde hair, a good build, and eyes that seemed to be a mix of blue and/or green. \"Hi! You must be the new neighbor,\" he exclaims once in front of her smiling, \"The name's Gerry Bertier.\" Holding out a hand to her, she glances at it for a moment before grabbing it with her own. \"Nice to meet ya'. I'm Dahlia Black, but most just call me Doll,\" she greets warmly while shaking his hand. Gerry's quick to raise a brow at her as they release the hold on their handshake. \"That's quite an interesting accent you got there. Where'd you come from?\" He asks while staring at her face hard in an attempt to figure it out. \"I'm from California.\" Smiling wider at Gerry's surprised expression, \"I know the accent doesn't match, I picked it up from my father who grew up in New York.\" \"No offense, but you don't quite fit the description of a California girl.\" He chuckles after saying. Dahlia laughs and waves it off as well. \"Don't worry I get that a lot! I ain't exactly the blonde and bronze type am I?\" She states while holding up a strand of nearly black hair. Gerry nods in agreement as the two laugh a little more in a comfortable manner. \"Would you happen to be going to T.C. Williams?\" She asks as she calms down a bit. Gerry seems to grow troubled, before nodding slowly. \"Yeah… It was previously Hammond High... You going there as well I presume?\" He asks while rubbing at the back of his head. Dahlia smiles and nods enthusiastically. \"Great! I'll at least know someone there!\" She seems to cheer happily causing Gerry to smile at the giddy girl, \"You won't leave me out there on my own to die, right?\" She asks with a look that reminds him greatly of a kicked puppy. How could he ever say no to a face like that? \"Now what kind of gentleman would I be if I did that?\" He answers innocently while raising a hands up to his chest at the accusation. A wide smile slowly makes its way back on to Dahlia's face exposing the dimple on her left cheek. \"I think we'll get along quite nicely Mr. Bertier.\" She claims while nodding in approval at his answer causing him to once again chuckle at the strange, yet amusing girl. He had to admit Dahlia was beautiful, but his heart was set on his girlfriend Emma. He agreed with her however, and knew that they would most likely get along well. \"Now, would you be a doll and help me carry some of my things in?\" She asks sweetly snapping Gerry out of his slight reverie. \"Me? Isn't that your thing?\" He jokes before freezing as he catches a glance of the vehicle in front of him. \"Is that your car?\" He asks slowly walking up to the shiny black beauty. Dahlia glanced up from under the hood of the trunk and giggles at Gerry's wide eyes and slacked jaw. \"Yessir, ain't she a beaut'?\" Dahlia's father asks as he exits the house to see the new arrival. Gerry quickly sobers up and straightens himself out to greet the well put together man in front of him. \"Gerry was it? You like cars, son?\" The older man asks causing the teen, who notices the similarity between Dahlia and her father instantly, to nod rather enthusiastically. \"Yessir Mr. Black! We've got a nice new red Camaro sitting in our own garage,\" Gerry brags slightly causing Dahlia to roll her eyes and mumble something about, 'men' under her breath. \"Well then! By all means you're welcome here anytime. And call me Danny,\" her father states as he hauls a box over his shoulder to take in the house. Dahlia turns to Gerry and nudges him lightly. \"Guess you're basically an honorary member of the family,\" she states as they both laugh at her father's antics. \"He's a bit of a grease monkey,\" she explains lifting a box up and out of the car, \"restores, builds, and fixes all sorts of vehicles. However, he does have a bit of a habit of collecting vintage beauties.\" This catches Gerry's attention, \"Who knows, if he likes you well enough he could trade and get you a car of your own,\" she casually tosses in the air catching him by surprise. \"Let me help you with that!\" He's quick to exclaim while grabbing the box from Dahlia earning him another grateful smile. Once they were all done moving in Dahlia and her father thank Gerry for his help, which he waves off saying, \"no problem.\" He offers to have dinner over his house some time and then bids them a farewell and 'see you later' to Dahlia. \"Well he seems nice,\" her father states receiving a laugh in response. \"Yeah… For now.\" She replies before bidding her father a goodnight. Hope you guys liked it! Feel free to favorite and/or review! I have the next chapter waiting to post if you all like it enough.

Disclaimer: I don't own none of Remember The Titans! A Black and White Film: A Titans Documentary Chapter Two: Welcome To The Jungle The next couple of days passed by quickly for Dahlia as she began to sort her many different cameras within her room. She wanted to speak with the football coach of the T.C. William Titans to perhaps get a place amongst the team as photographer or even stat taker. She knew she was well qualified, but she needed to remember that she was a girl, and they weren't exactly given a place amongst the team unless they were cheering for them on the sidelines. Dahlia had also figured out that Gerry was a part of this football team, or that's what she thought at least. It turns out that the integrating of the schools also caused for Gerry's original coach to be replaced by some, \"black animal\" as Gerry so nicely put it. This got him a harsh glare from Dahlia, and a violent end to their conversation as she quickly excused herself and left. Another thing she had learned after a little snooping around is that there was a football meeting at the gym today. This was a perfect chance to speak to the new coach! She just needed to sneak inside and catch him afterwards to persuade him to let her join. Her father had told her that it would all work out because of that \"natural charm\" of hers. Which she really in all honesty did not understand. Dahlia was now in the gym staying hidden behind the bleachers, which made her feel slightly creepy. She can see that there were a few people already here, but they didn't seem to notice her at all. She frowns as she notes that all of them were of one race, and that there was no mixing yet. \"We gonna play some ball y'all! Black inside! Black inside! Black inside!\" She catches one who sports a rather adorable baby face yell merrily as he high fives some of the others around him. Dahlia peers through the steps and chuckles quietly to herself as he continues with a, \"Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh!\" \"Yo, Petey!\" A larger male shouts catching the attention of the excited boy. Dahlia grins as she learns one of their names. She was aware that if she were to get this job, she'd need to know and memorize their names and most likely their positions. She knew Gerry had been a linebacker in his previous year, but she didn't think she'd have to remember that since she didn't see him here at this mandatory meeting. \"How many yards you figure you gon' get this season, bruh?\" The large dark skinned male asks causing Petey to smile. \"You know I ain't one to brag, Big Blue,\" he responds causing Dahlia to once again take note of another name to remember. Big Blue, she had to admit that was a pretty cool name. \"But I figure on at least a thousand,\" Petey finishes causing all the other guys to laugh and joke at his expense, which Petey defends himself with half-hearted statements of, \"but I ain't one to brag.\" \"Didn't I tell you how all them white boys weren't gon' play for no brotha?\" A tall and sharp looking guy states next catching the attention of all the others. \"Well who needs 'em, baby! From now on the Titans is gona be powered by soul power, bro.\" Big Blue booms loudly as he begins to sing. Dahlia smiles and nods her head along to his deep vocals, but jumps when a sudden loud whistle pierces the air. She could have sworn she hadn't heard anyone come in! As she attempts to calm her now erratic heart beat she could see two adult males, who were also of darker color skin walk in. Dahlia rubs her brows a bit frustrated, as she tries to determine which one of them she'd have to talk to to get the position she wanted. She watches as one of them stalks on over to Petey who has his hand raised and a big ol' smile on his face. \"Put your hand down,\" he states sharply after staring at Petey for a second. Petey stops smiling and lowers his hand. Dahlia feels her heart tighten in pity for the boy she thought was probably a tad younger than herself. \"You're smiling.\" The guy once again states causing Petey to answer hesitantly with a, \"yes.\" \"Yessir!\" He's corrected causing him to repeat the statement. \"Why are you smiling!\" He demands. \"'Cause I love football. Football's fun.\" Petey answers slowly, almost unsure if this was a serious question. Dahlia hides her face in her hands as she could practically feel the second hand embarrassment for the poor boy. \"Fun, sir. It's fun? You sure?\" He continued to shout. \"I think —\" Petey answers but is quickly cut off. \"Now you're thinkin'. First you smile then you think? You think football is still fun?\" He snaps. \"Uh, yes!\" Petey answers smiling once again, but you could see by the furrow of his brows that he was incredibly uncomfortable. Dahlia could and would not blame him for feeling that way. \"Sir.\" The man corrects again causing Petey to frown. Dahlia peeks through her fingers still dying for the poor guy being interrogated in front of all his friends. \"Yes — No, s-sir. Uhh —Well, it was fun.\" Petey stumbles over his words under the man's harsh stare. Dahlia couldn't see the man's face, but judging by his voice he was a man of authority. There would be no funny business while he was in charge. \"Not anymore, though, is it? Is it!?\" He shouts causing Petey to stutter out a bunch of nos. \"No, It's not fun anymore. Not even a little bit?\" \"Uh… No.\" \"Make up your mind!\" The man once again shouts, \"go ahead, make up your mind. Think since you're thinking.\" \"No, sir.\" \"No? Absolutely not?\" \"Zero fun, sir.\" Petey finally states with a strained smile on his face. Dahlia couldn't help but chuckle to herself quietly at Petey's expression as the man finally moves his scrutinizing glare away from his figure. \"Alright, listen up. I'm Coach Boone. I'm gonna' to tell you all about how much, fun,\" he announces halting to glance at Petey before continuing, \"you're gonna have this season.\" Dahlia could feel herself visibly deflate at the fact that this man was the coach she'd have to speak with. She would definitely have a bit of a time convincing this 'down to business' man to let her on this team. She however did know that this Coach Boone, was good at showing his point across. \"We leave for camp, Gettysburg College. August 15th. 7:29 am.\" He lists off causing Dahlia to take mental note of everything stated. \"If you report at 7:30, you will not be playing football this season, you will be watching.\" Dahlia was impressed by this man. He began to list off the attire they were to wear and demanded they appear professional and even takes the time to insult the way the future players were dressed now. Dahlia self consciously glances down at herself to check if what she was wearing would be considered appropriate. A dark blue polka dotted sailor inspired dress was what she chose to wear today, and she supposed this would suffice as formal. She begins to fiddle with her camera hanging around her neck as she grew more and more nervous. \"This is no democracy. It is a dictatorship. I am the law. If you survive camp, you will be on the team. If you survive.\" Hearing this Dahlia raises her eyebrows in surprise. This man was so serious. His tone was also one of the most intimidating she's ever heard. She could practically hear the periods in his sentences. \"Check 'em in, Coach.\" He calls out causing the other man to step up. \"Checkin 'em in! I'm Coach Hinds, your offensive line coach. Yell out your name and position starting from the right.\" Petey, who was all the way to the right, grins from ear to ear once while stepping forward. The girl in hiding smiles excitedly knowing she'd have to remember everything being said once more. \"Petey Jones, running back. THE running back, ya'll.\" Once again all the other males in the gym laugh and clown on him. Coach Hinds chuckles good heartedly before jotting down the information. Dahlia even chuckles a bit glad that the jokester's spirit was still intact. \"Yeah, yeah, yeah,\" a new face says pushing guys out of the way lightly, \"Jerry Harris, quarterback.\" The new voice catches Dahlia's attention. This male is well put together. He has a \"good boy\" look about him and seems genuinely kind by the smile on his face. To her surprise everyone around him begins to shout out \"Rev!\" and \"Hallelujah!\" Coach Hines seems to wonder the same thing as he asks about it. \"Rev?\" \"Its just a nickname,\" he waves off causing Dahlia to smile. So it seems he was a good boy after all, she could appreciate that. Suddenly, heavy footsteps could be heard and she sees a large white male make his way in to the crowd. It became dreadfully silent as the newcomer attempts to catch his breath. Dahlia was shocked, but quickly grew excited as things suddenly began to into motion. Things were mixing, it may have only been one, but everything has to start off somewhere. \"And who in the name of heaven might you be?\" Coach Hinds asks pointing his pen in his direction. \"Uhm, Louie Lastik, offensive lineman. Naval family, just moved in from Bayonne. Someone said football, so I come runnin'. What's going on, everybody?\" Dahlia smiles widely at the teddy bear like giant, but is quick to frown at the awkward silence that follows. It seems that the whites weren't the only ones that were slightly racist. It seems the blacks weren't too fond of the opposite color either. She couldn't blame them, she just felt bad for the kind and gentle giant. The gym doors were suddenly shoved open and echoed throughout the gym. Everyone's attention was at the doors in seconds. Dahlia grew slightly angry when she spots a bunch of other guys, who were all notably white, come barging in. It was rude. She was not the type to stand for rude behavior, her scowl only grows deeper as she spots Gerry's face amongst the crowd of intruders. They were lead by two other adult males, and by the look of Coach Boone's face… Things weren't too peachy at the moment. \"You have just disrupted my first team meeting in an unacceptable fashion.\" Coach Boone says a still peeved at what happened only moments ago. Dahlia snuck out after them in attempts to catch him alone afterwards. \"This is my team now. Either you're with that or you're not.\" \"I'm here ain't I?\" The man known as Coach Yoast, as Dahlia found out, answers with just a hint of attitude, \"let's talk football.\" \"Lets talk football.\" Coach Boone agrees instantly. \"I run the defense —\" \"AS a part of my team strategy. Now, I have never seen an assistant coach's name in a newspaper for losing a game,\" Boone warns cutting him off. \"I want a job for Coach Tyrell. He's been with me for ten years. I won't leave him out in the cold. You don't get me without him,\" Yoast explains laying his cards out on the table. Dahlia could respect that, she just hopes that these coaches would play fair with each other much like she prays the actual players will do as well. Coach Boone takes in a calming breath before continuing the conversation. \"You're over cooking my grits, Coach.\" The two stare each other down for a couple of moments, making the silent girl grow antsy. \"All right. I will allow Coach Tyrell to coach the special team, but I will have my eye on him.\" Coach Boone warns him, \"And you.\" They seem to come to an agreement and shake hands briefly. Dahlia takes in a deep breath before stepping out and walking over to the two official coaches of T.C. Williams Titans. \"Excuse me? Coach Boone and Coach Yoast?\" She announces just loud enough to catch the two's attention. \"Excuse me? Were you spying on us!\" Coach Boone questions with a hard look on his face, not appreciating the intrusion. Coach Yoast on the other hand appears surprised to see the girl. \"I apologize for the intrusion of privacy, but I was just trying to find the Coach to talk to and so happened to have found you two,\" she apologizes while giving a soft smile. She needed to be very careful on how she worded things here. She needs to somehow appease to both coaches, without insulting the other. \"Well then, you found him. State your name and business then, young lady.\" Coach Boone states crossing his arms. Coach Yoast continues to simply stare at her curiously. She calms herself and decides to take her daddy's advice and just act natural. \"Great! It's nice to meet you coaches! My name is Dahlia Black.\" She introduces herself holding out her hand to Coach Boone first. His eyes widen just a fraction before reaching out to grip the young ladies hand in return. She makes sure to give his hand a solid and firm shake before doing the same to Coach Yoast. \"Me and my dad just moved here from California. He runs the new mechanic shop down the road from here.\" Dahlia states while shoving a finger over her shoulder as an indication of where, \"When I heard that this school was just recently integrating, I was downright excited.\" Dahlia tests to gauge the reaction from both coaches. She needs to know where Coach Yoast stood, she needs to see if he was racist to know how to handle this conversation. \"Really?\" Coach Boone asls with slight surprise. Yoast seems to hold the same reaction and a ghost of a smile makes its way on his face. Dahlia mentally smirks to herself deciding that this was a good sign. \"Yessir. Where I come from we judge a man by his character, not by the shallow judgement of his skin. I can't wait to see the transition happen here as well,\" She announces causing both coaches to nod her way. \"Well now, this is a nice change of scenery here.\" Coach Boone sates taking the time to smile down at the girl in front of him. He was in fact impressed by the girl who appears to be polite, well dressed, and confident. He had to admit he was interested in what she had to ask of him. \"However, what is it that you wanted to talk about exactly.\" The girl holds up the camera hanging around her neck in response. \"Coach Boone, Coach Yoast, I wish to be on the team,\" she announces boldly causing Boone to chuckle at the thin girl in front of him. Yoast finds himself smiling widely as well. \"You want to play football?\" Yoast asks carefully. Dahlia seems to smile impishly at the question before scrunching her nose up. \"Now don't doubt my ability to play football, Coach. I can play.\" She states causing both men to raise their brows, \"That isn't why I want to be on the team though. I'm a photographer. I wish to be able to photograph and document the Titans way into history.\" This seems to catch the interest of both coaches, much to Dahlia's delight. \"You guys are fighting a war here, and it won't be easy. I'll document your games, victories, practices, anything you need. I'll make sure to make each and every Titan look their best in every photo.\" She lowers her camera once again to lay around her neck, \"I just want a place on the team. What you guys are doing will change these boys and town for life, I want to help you all fight this battle.\" She finishes with and sends a proud smile up at the two men. It was silent for a moment before Boone both nods and shakes his head in disbelief at the little girl. \"Well how can I say no to that?\" He asks causing Dahlia to grin cheekily and shake his hand with much enthusiasm. \"Really! Oh thank you! I'm glad to be doing business with someone such as you, Coach Boone.\" She tells him. She glances over to Yoast to see he has a smile on his face as well. \"Don't worry Coach Yoast. I've spoken to Gerry Bertier a couple of times and know you think of your boys as your own. I'll photograph and document their greatest moments and keep track of all their stats. Colleges will be lining up for miles to get a chance to have a Titan play for their team, I promise you that.\" She explains to the man she had priorly thought of as rude. His response was a proud and impressed grin as she shook his hand as well. Successfully sealing the deal. \"Well now, you really think you're up for all that?\" Coach Yoast asks as they release their grips. She smiles and nods confidently. \"I've been taking pictures and learning football since before I can remember. I've already got some members stats started. I've got Gerry Bertier, defensive linebacker. Petey Jones, running back. Jerry \"Rev\" Harris, quarterback. And last but not least Louie Lastik, offensive lineman,\" she lists once again impressing the coaches. \"Were you spying on us in the gym as well?\" Coach Boone accuses her once again with a hard stare. She gives him an apologetic look before trying to defend herself. \"Like I said, I wanted to speak to you,\" She responds. Coach Boone and Yoast smile at the young girl. \"Well, then you've got initiative. I can appreciate that. I think we can find a place for you on our team. It would benefit us greatly to have someone to document what we do on the team, wouldn't you agree, Coach Yoast?\" Boone asks. \"It would indeed do us some good,\"he agrees thinking of his boys chances at college. \"Great! So when can I start?\" She asks jumping up and down slightly. \"Well, we'll be seeing you bright and early on August 15th,\" Boone informs her. \"I'm going to camp?\" Dahlia asks in shock. \"You didn't think you could get out of that did you? You need to train as well! You need to be able to run along the sidelines and catch the boys in action, don't you?\" He calls her out, catching Dahlia by surprise, \"I hope you're in shape Ms. Black, because I'll be expecting you to be out there shooting the boys while they practice.\" \"Can do!\" She agrees happily. Coach Yoast raises an eyebrow at the demands of Coach Boone. Surely he wasn't serious about making this young lady work out with a bunch of guys. \"I expect you to be there at 7:30 sharp. You will arrive dressed formally to go on the bus. For camp however, please refrain from dressing in things too dainty to run in because I will not let you off lightly. You will show me everything that you catch after every practice, so pack as much as you deem necessary. Can you do that for me?\" Coach states in a business like manner. Dahlia salutes him making him nod in approval. \"I can do that. It was nice discussing business with you Coach Boone and Coach Yoast. I promise you, you won't be disappointed,\" she says before turning around to bid them farewell. Just before she turns the corner however, she turns back and shouts out rather cheekily, \"Oh! And you mean 7:29, right Coach Boone?\" As soon as the words are out of her mouth she disappears around the corner. \"Can you believe the nerve of that girl?\" Coach Boone chuckles to himself. \"You aren't serious about making her practice with the boys are you?\" Coach Yoast asks. He receives a hard look from Boone as he turns around to head back to the gym. Yoast simply shakes his head and wonders back to this Dahlia girl. She knows her football and is willing to get down and dirty. His daughter Sheryl was sure to get along beautifully with her. Hope you all enjoyed it! I've gotten a suggestion for the pairing to be with either Rev or Alan! Who I both love! Any other great suggestions?[Chapter 3] Hey! Sorry for the wait on this chapter! School has been so demanding of me recently! Thanks to the few of you who have added this story to your faves, and following it as well! I'm writing this for you guys now ^_^ Read and Enjoy! Disclaimer: Same as usual all rights to this movie belong to Disney. A Black and White Film: A Titans Documentary Chapter Three: A Change Is Gonna Come \"Thanks for driving me here today, daddy-o!\" Dahlia chirps animatedly, pulling the strap of her bag a little more securely over her shoulder. Danny Black who was just a few steps behind her also held a bag and laughs at his excited little girl. \"Of course! I've gotta' meet the coaches who fell so easily under your natural charm,\" he jokes shooting a smile his daughter's way. He could recall how happy his daughter was as she came bursting through their front door shouting about how she managed to 'tame the bull.' Only after letting the girl calm down did he find out that the new coach of the Titans was a strict man. \"Do I look presentable?\" Dahlia asks gently laying her bag of valuables beside her. Her father stares and smiles at his little mini-me. She truly did look like him and he had to admit he held a bit of pride over that. Today she had styled her hair to appear shoulder length with a delicate white head band going across her forehead. She had a dress that looked like it could be a two part ensemble. Her top was made of lightweight jean fabric, while her bottom half was more fluffy with layered sheer fabric. \"Of course you do, baby doll!\" Pulling his daughter in for a hug she's all too happy to return it, \"You're gonna' have to beat them boys away with a stick looking like you do!\" He winks as he releases his daughter. Her only response being an eyeroll followed by a sarcastic smile at her father's constant teasing. She stops to glance down at her watch and is happy to see she was early, and for a good reason too! She was hoping she could get to meet some of the other players to help memorize some of their names and faces. \"Dahlia?\" She hears someone question causing her to glance up towards the voice to find a surprised Gerry Bertier, and a confused boy to his left. \"Gerry! How many times have I told you to just call me Doll?\" She asks placing her hands on her hips feigning annoyance. He in response shoots her a charming smile and goes in to hug the strange, but lovable girl. \"Gerry, my boy! It's been awhile since I've seen you over.\" Her father greets as he shakes Bertier's hand. \"I'm sorry sir. Things have been pretty hectic recently,\" he apologizes to the stylish man in front of him. Hearing his friend clear his throat awkwardly he's quick to react. \"Right! This is my friend Ray Budds,\" he introduces while motioning towards the shorter male next to him, who smiles politely in response. \"It's nice to meet you! I'm Dahlia Black, and this is my father Danny Black,\" she reciprocates as she and her father shake hands with him as well. \"What are you doing here, Doll ?\" Gerry asks stressing the use of the nickname she seems to insist he call her. \"Same reason you're here!\" She responds casually causing the two boys in front of her to glance at each other in shock. \"You're coming to camp with us?\" Ray speaks up glancing down at her bags. Dahlia stares at him and takes in his appearance before nodding as a response. He was shorter than Gerry, but attractive if you could look past the obvious mean streak he seems to have. For now however, he was playing nice which she could appreciate. \"You're not playing football with us, are you?\" Gerry asks hesitantly causing Dahlia's father to laugh. \"Don't doubt her playing abilities, son.\" He manages to get out between chuckles, causing the two boys to stare at him in curiosity, \"Her brothers both have played football for a majority of their life. She being the youngest and only girl still insisted on playing right along side them.\" Said girl began to blush slightly. \"Hey! Don't judge my skills before you even see them Bertier!\" She scolds once again pointing at Gerry with a half-hearted glare. She receives an equally playful raise of arms from Gerry, which causes her to erupt in laughter, \"but no, I'm not playing football with you two. I'm the team's personal photographer!\" She exclaims quickly snapping a picture of the two boys, successfully catching them off guard at the sound of the shutter going off. \"Good morning. Good morning. Good morning!\" She catches a familiar voice greet as they enter the area. She's quick to locate the owner of the voice and head their way. \"Is she really coming to camp, Danny?\" Gerry asks lowly as he glances over to Dahlia's father in doubt. Ray seems just as doubtful as he remains silent. \"She loves football and really thinks this'll be a good chance at documenting something great,\" he responds soberly. Reaching over to cup Gerry's shoulder he stares at him long and hard, \"You'll watch over my baby girl at camp, won't you? She may be a little ass-kicker, but I still worry for her safety. It's a father's job.\" He asks with a slight smile at the end. \"You've got it Mr. Black.\" He responds dutifully with a determined nod. Danny squeezes the boys shoulder before mumbling, 'Good boy' under his breath. He goes and gives Ray a hard clap on the shoulder before leaving to follow his daughter who is hounding the Coach she spoke so much of. \"Awfully skinny playbook, ain't it?\" Dahlia caught wind of the conversation happening as she makes her way over to the coaches. The man speaking is who she assumes to be Coach Tyrell, and chooses to remain silent until the conversation was over. \"I run six plays, split veer. It's like novocaine. Just give it time, always works.\" Coach Boone responds without missing a beat. Dahlia raises her brows having a bit of a hard time catching that, he spoke like the wind. \"Coach!\" Dahlia announces causing the three men to look her way. \"Ms. Black! Good to see you here early!\" Coach Boone greets shaking the smiling girl's hand. She turns to Coach Yoast and grips his hand in greeting as well. Turning to the stranger, who seems to be giving her a look crossed between curiosity and doubt, she smiles pleasantly. \"Dahlia! This is Coach Tyrell-\" Coach Yoast begins to announce only to be cut off as Dahlia thrusts her hand out to shake the man's own. \"Coach Tyrell! You're in charge of the special team. It's nice to meet you! My name is Dahlia Black.\" The man in front of her shakes her hand with a small smile, but slightly impressed smile. \"She'll be documenting our boys journey and taking their stats to help them out with future college draftings,\" Coach Yoast continues causing the man next to him to nod in appreciation. \"Yessir! Anyways I wanted to introduce my daddy to you all!\" She exclaims motioning to her father who now stood behind her. He reaches out and greets each of them with his signature smile on his face that, like Dahlia, showcased a single dimple on his left cheek. \"It's nice to meet you coaches. Danny Black, this crazy little thing's father.\" He announces placing a hand on his little girl's shoulder. \"I want to thank you for accepting her on the team,\" he says while nodding gratefully to the trio. \"It's no problem Mr. Black. We appreciate the offer she made and look forward to having her,\" Coach Yoast announces. \"Can't wait to see if she's as good as she claims to be,\" Coach Boone jokes as he stares down at the nicely dressed female who smiles impishly in response. \"Oh, don't you worry about that one. She's one of the best,\" Dahlia's father announces causing the coaches to nod in approval. \"Anyways, I have to head to work now. You be good, kid. Don't cause too much trouble alright?\" He warns his daughter before hugging her and kissing the top of her darkened colored head. \"I wish you coaches luck out there! Bring us back a winning team,\" He cheers while shaking their hands once again and turning to leave. Boone was once again pleasantly surprised at the man's kind nature. He seems to understand just where Dahlia had inherited her attitude from. \"Oh! Right! Coach Boone?\" Dahlia asks catching the mens' attention once again, \"I was wondering if I could have a copy of y'all's playbooks as well?\" She asks trying to situate both of her bags on each shoulder. \"Now, why would you need those young lady?\" He asks her crossing his arms. \"Well, I figured if I know the plays I'll know who will be where at what time. It'll allow me to catch the best shots on the field!\" She reasons causing the coaches to nod after a bit of thought. \"That's not a bad idea. I'll work on a copy for you!\" Coach Boone answers with an appreciative smile making its way on his face, \"In the mean time however, at camp I expect you to be paying attention to their drills to catch an understanding of their plays until I can get you those copies.\" He bargains with the girl who nods along cheerfully. \"Thank you Coach Boone! I'll be seeing you all on the bus! I'm going to get more info on the players!\" She informs while waving to the coaches and making her way over to some of the other players. \"Nice girl,\" Coach Tyrell comments causing Yoast to nod in agreement. \"Hey!\" She calls out to a familiar bunch of people. They all glance over to her in surprise at the sight of a girl who, by the look of her bags, were joining them at camp. \"Well, what's a fine little thing like yourself doing over here?\" The one she remembers as Petey asks with a wide smile on his face while throwing an arm around her shoulder in a playful manner. Much to the groups surprise the girl in front of them smiles in return to Petey's antics and laughs. \"I'm Dahlia Black, but you guys can call me Doll or whatever you like.\" She announces, shoving Petey away playfully, \"And you must be Petey Jones. Nice to meet you! I'm the teams' photographer.\" She finishes holding out a hand for him to shake. Petey however, was a bit shocked at the slim white female in front of him. She was quite the beauty and was accepting them of him and his actions. It surprised him, having been accustomed to being treated so harshly from people of her color, however here she was all smiley and playful. \"Well, alright Baby Doll!\" He announces smiling once again grabbing the hand held out to him, \"I see you've heard of Ol' Petey here have you? Well, little Ms. Paparazzi you make sure you get my good side, alright?\" Speaking in third person, \"And by my good side, I mean all sides.\" He jokes while raising her hand to kiss charmingly, this causes all the guys around him to clown on him. She laughs at his actions before patting his head lightly. \"Of course! You were subjected to Coach Boone's interrogating on the first day, right?\" She ponders outlaid playfully causing the boy in front of her to deflate while the others around him begin to laugh at his expense, \"I hope you still think football is fun.\" She spoke softly while shooting him a comforting smile at the glares he shoots her way. She scans the group of people and spots another familiar face who seems to be staring back at her rather curiously. \"You're Jerry Harris, right? Quarterback, if I remember correctly.\" She asks, holding out a hand for him to shake as well. His eyebrows shot up in moderate surprise before gripping her hand and shaking it. \"Yes m'am,\" He responds smiling warmly at the pretty faced girl in front of him, \"but you can call me Rev, everyone else does.\" The other guys around her who all were of one race, besides Louie that is, began to introduce themselves to the girl they all thought were 'mighty fine'. While she was greeting people she cringes hearing Coach Boone mock 'Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin' in front of everyone. However, Coach Boone's wrath didn't stop there he marches on the buses and pulled everyone in there out and rearranged everyone's seat to make sure everyone was sitting next to someone of a different race. She was impressed to say the least at the Coach's persistence. \"Where do I go, Coach?\" She walks up to Boone after all players were in the bus. He glances down at her and any sign of anger is quick to leave his face. \"Well now, I believe there's a spot on the defensive bus waiting for you,\" he responds pointing over to one of the two buses in response. \"Now, you'll be sitting next to someone of the same race, but I trust that you won't let that cloud your mindset,\" he tells her goodheartedly while sending a hard pat on her shoulder. Walking up to the bus she couldn't hear a peep from any of the players. It was awkwardly silent and she cringes as it fills the air. Entering, she receives a kind smile from the driver, which she's quick to return before turning to search for the only free seat left on the bus. She spots Gerry to her staring out the window, and boy did he look unhappy. She also saw that right behind him sat a lone boy. She walks over with a smile and watches the boy glance up at her with wide eyes before quickly scooting over towards the window to allow her to sit with a bright grin. \"Thanks,\" she responds smoothing her dress down as she sits. The boy next to her had blonde hair that was kept short, but longer than Gerry's. He was cute with his colored eyes, and seemed to be a genuinely cheerful guy. \"No problem. Are you going to camp with us?\" He asks staring at her for a moment. \"Mhmm-\" She hummed shooting him a smile that catches him off guard. \"I'm Dahlia Black, the Titans' personal photographer,\" She greets causing him to smile back. \"She prefers to be called Doll though, Bosley.\" Gerry chimes in from his spot in front of them, turning to look at the two. The boy next to him glances over irritably before moving to face away from him. \"You two know each other?\" The boy next to her asks as he glances from her to Gerry in an almost cautious way. \"He's just my irritating neighbor. Nothing special.\" Dahlia responds causing Gerry to reach over and ruffle her hair playfully. She pulls away and sticks her tongue out as he turn his back to her, but is quick pull it back in when he mentions that he can see her. The boy next to her laughs and reaches out a hand for her to shake. \"I'm Alan Bosley. Defensive tackle,\" he says as she shook his hand. \"You like photography then?\" He asks making an obvious assumption, but wanting to continue their conversation. \"Football and photography are my life,\" she responds dreamily causing Alan to chuckle softly at the female, \"you know anything about photography?\" She asks catching him by surprise. \"Well, I know a thing or two, but not much. I have a video camera back at home.\" This earns him an interested glance and smile from the beauty he had at his side. He silently thanked the Lord that his seat mate hadn't made it today, so he could have this opportunity. As the bus began to move silence consumes everyone once again. As time ticks on, Dahlia seems to be nodding off and Alan kept trying to hold in his laughter as he watches her head bob every so often. Catching him chuckling at her she shoots him a playful glare before hitting him on the shoulder. \"It's not funny!\" She whispers, although it seems to echo off the walls of the bus loudly because of the silence. Alan only proceeds to have to hold in another fit of laughter as he rubs his shoulder slightly in mock pain. \"As punishment for your laughter you will now have to serve your duty as my personal pillow,\" she declares gently placing her head on the shoulder she hit. Alan stiffens a bit at the unexpected contact, but is quick to relax. He likes this girl. She was a pretty little thing, and spoke with an interesting, but alluring accent. She was friendly and goofy and he could instantly tell that the boys would warm up to her nicely, considering he already did. He chuckles to himself as he can hear groans and complaints of 'Why'd Bosley get so lucky,' from his fellow teammates. Movement from his right after an hour or so suddenly catches his attention. \"Cause baby there ain't no mountain high enough~\" One of the black boys reach over to cup the one next to Gerry's shoulder. The singing caught Alan's attention, being a fan of music. It seems that it caught a once snoozing Dahlia's attention too. She lifts her head off of Alan's shoulder and smiles at the tune being sung. \"Ain't no valley low enough~\" He continues to sing getting the boy in front of him to join in. A now awake Dahlia smiles widely as she recognizes the one singing to be Big Blue! She turns to see Alan start wiggling his shoulders to the tune and bumps into her in a playful manner. She grins and joins him in a miniature dance party to Blue's singing. \"Ain't no-\" A slap on his shoulder causes the sound to stop abruptly and so did Alan's and Dahlia's dancing. \"Blue, shut up. I don't want to see your smilin' and shuff in', and hear all your minstrel show singing on this bus.\" The grouchy boy in front of Dahlia tells him causing Blue to shoot him a disappointed glare. She faces Alan and frowns causing him to look towards the grouchy guy's direction with a hard stare. Dahlia raises an eyebrow at this, she couldn't tell if this guy was as racist as some of the other white's on the bus. He didn't seem to mind the singing Blue, so she was interested to see if he was glaring at Gerry's seat mate because he was black, or because he was rude. \"You, too.\" The boy continues looking at the boy who was just joining Blue. Things seemed to settle back into awkward silence much to Dahlia's dismay. \"Got that right,\" Gerry pipes in causing their attention to turn to him. His seat mate, who Dahlia didn't know the name to yet, stiffens up slightly. Dahlia feels her heart clench at the sudden tense atmosphere, especially when he turns to stare at Gerry. \"You can shut up, too.\" He says causing Gerry to turn and stare back. Alan and Dahlia watch as they seem to glare at each other before turning away. She lets out a sigh and mumbles something about 'having a long, long way to go' before returning to her position on Alan's shoulder to get some more rest. When they arrive at camp Dahlia was softly snoring on Alan's shoulder. He finds himself staring down at her and smile as he admits her light snoring was cute in a dorky sort of way. \"You enjoying yourself there, Alan?\" Gerry asks from his position as he stands up to exit the bus. He caught the soft look Alan was shooting towards the Titan's Doll just moments ago. He often found himself doing the same thing. He didn't have any siblings, but he considered Dahlia to be a sister he never had, much like the Coach's daughter, Sheryl. \"Hey! Sleeping Beauty! Get up you're drooling all over Bosley,\" Gerry shouts poking a finger into her side causing her to pop up quickly with a squeal. \"I did not!\" She states horrified looking down to see Alan's shoulder was dry. She glares viciously at Gerry who was quickly making his way out of the bus. She jumps up and quickly went after him managing to hop on his back just as he exits the bus causing him to stumble forward slightly. She smacks the back of his head causing him to shout out in protest before letting him go to walk over and grab her bags with a huff. Alan soon exits the bus and laughs loudly at Gerry who was rubbing his head giving Dahlia a disgruntled expression. \"Let me help you with that,\" she hears someone offer from behind her as she once again struggles to even out the weight of both bags on her shoulder. Turning around she spotted a hesitant looking Blue. She smiles at him brightly before handing him the bag filled with her clothes, choosing to hold her cameras on her own. \"Thank you,\" she responds gratefully causing Blue to visually relax once he was sure she wouldn't be down right nasty towards him, \"You're Big Blue, right?\" She asks catching him off guard. She knew his name! \"Yes m'am! Blue Stanton at your service, baby!\" He announces with his joyful voice. She smiles and follows him in the direction of the buildings. \"I'm Dahlia Black, but you can call me what you want.\" She decides to say considering he seems to have a nickname for her already, \"I liked your singing by the way.\" She adds in remembering him singing on the bus, before she had fallen asleep. \"You did!?\" He asks, eyes lighting up, \"you listen to that type of music, baby girl?\" Petey, who was walking next to Alan threw his arm around Dahlia's shoulder catching wind of their conversation. \"Of course! Don't you know that this little Baby Doll right here has some soul power?\" Petey shouts causing Blue to nod and smile in respect towards the girl who grabbed Petey's head in a headlock and started to give him a noogie while laughing at his wild protests. Once they arrive to their meeting place, Coach Boone introduces her to the rest of the boys and informs them of her duties to everyone earning a look of interest from most of the boys in the room. She expected it as much, she was the person that could basically make, or break a player. After that was all said and done they were all sorted into rooms. \"Dahlia?\" Coach Yoast asks causing the girl to look up from her bags to smile at said Coach. \"This is your roommate. Meet my daughter, Sheryl.\" He motions to a little girl who smiles confidently at her. \"Well! It's an honor to meet you, Sheryl!\" She replies shaking the small girl's hand. Sheryl had a nice firm handshake, she seemed rugged and probably loved football just as much as her daddy. \"It's nice to meet someone as interested in football as I am on the team,\" she responds causing Dahlia to smile at the little girl. Once she was sent off to unpack her things Coach Yoast asks Dahlia to stay back for a bit. \"Now, usually I room with Sheryl at camps. However, due to the fact that you both are females I decided to room you with her. I'm trusting that you'll watch over her for me, will ya?\" He asks Dahlia. She smiles at the father's concern, it reminding her greatly of her own father. Coach Yoast had a bunch of sons with his team, but only one daughter and that seemed to mean the world to him. \"Don't worry Coach. I've got her,\" she responds before shouldering her bags and following the young girl calling out for her to follow. The two girls got along perfectly. Sheryl seemed to have taken an easy liking to Dahlia especially after she offered to play football with the small girl some time. Shouting could be heard from the down the hall catching both girls' attention. Sheryl sat up in bed with a look holding a bit of curiosity and concern, while Dahlia opens the door of their room to peak out. \"Fight!\" She hears a familiar voice shout out. Looking back to Sheryl she could see the interest manifest in the little tomboy's eyes. \"Stay here Sheryl,\" she warns the small girl who crosses her arms and pouts, but otherwise stays put. Dahlia sends her a smile before booking down the hall to see who on Earth was fighting. Pushing past a familiar face to bolt into the crowded room she's yanked back before she can even enter. \"Whoa there,\" the person holding her says before letting her go when she stops struggling, \"I wouldn't go in there if I were you.\" Dahlia glances towards the room filled with boys before looking at the concerned face of Rev. \"Whose fighting?\" She asks Rev while flattening her dress down a tad, having been ruffled by her running. \"I'm not quite sure, but I do know that this here room belongs to Julius and Gerry.\" He stands in front of her trying to keep her away from the quickly growing fight. She could feel her anger spike at the thought of Gerry being hateful towards his roommate. However, she didn't want to jump to conclusions when she wasn't sure what exactly happened. She catches a glimpse of Rev trying to keep her from harms way and smiles warmly at him. He was definitely a good guy. \"Do you know what started the fight?\" She asks laying a hand on his shoulder to catch his attention. He turns to look back at her with a apologetic look. \"I'm not too sure, Dahlia.\" She pats his shoulder in understanding before pushing past him. \"Thanks for protecting me Rev, but I think I got this,\" she declares while trying to pass him. He shakes his head at her as if telling her not to get involved, but she's already pushing and pulling boys away from each other as she forces her way towards the main source of all this fighting. Most would go to hit her, but instantly stop in their tracks once they see who is pulling them away from each other. They were not about to hit someone who could make or break their college football career, and this photographer could do just that. \"Alan!\" She calls out grabbing a hold of his arm causing him to snap his head her way with large eyes. He was surprised to see there were only a couple of guys fighting now as the rest were backing away slowly. \"Who started the fight?\" She asks him. He quickly fixes his hair and tries to straighten himself up before answering. \"Gerry-\" Was all he could get out before she tore away from him with a growl and furious look in her eyes. He was quick to follow her incase she got hurt by the few boys still fighting. Dahlia shoved past a few more boys before reaching the source of the fight. She quickly grabd one of the two, but catches an elbow as it flies back creating a nice split on her lip. Alan flinches as he sees her receive the hit and a bunch of the guys hiss as well. Gerry, who sent the elbow out, instantly halts his fighting with the other colored boy. \"Doll! I'm so-\" His apology was quickly cut off as a quick jab is sent to his face, successfully breaking his nose. The sickening crack that sounds causes a few of the guys to flinch. Gerry swears and backs off quickly grabbing at his nose that starts to drip blood. Ray and his buddies quickly push their way to the front and to his aid. The other boy, known as his roommate Julius, quickly stands up. \"Are- Are you alright?\" His voice low and almost unsure as he looks down at Dahlia who is massaging her hand softly. Catching a glimpse of the nasty cut and quickly forming bruise on her face, he glances away guiltily. No girl should be getting hit in the face like that, it just wasn't right. \" What is going on here!\" The voice of Coach Boone could be heard as everyone quieted down to stare at him. \"A bunch of tough guys,\" Coach Boone snaps as he paces the room filled with players and the other coaches. \"You look like a bunch of fifth grade sissies after a catfight,\" he berates the bunch of now sweaty and bruised up boys. Dahlia was sitting next to Sheryl on some steps licking her now split lip. Sheryl cringes every time she looks at it playfully, which Dahlia would smile at if it didn't hurt so much to do so. \"You got anger. That's good. You're gonna need it, son.\" He stops to stare at Julius who stares straight back with a hard look. \"You got aggression. That's even better. You're gonna need that, too.\" He moves on, looking at Gerry whose nose was now put back in place and only bruised slightly, as he glances down guiltily. He had promised Dahlia's father that he'd look out for her, but he had been the one to harm her. He felt horrible for it. \"But any little two year old child can throw a fit.\" Glaring at the rest of the boys that stood before him, \"Football is about controlling that anger. Harnessing that aggression into a team effort to achieve perfection!\" He continues even stopping to glance back to Dahlia on the steps behind him. \"Some coaches, they cut a player if they think he's not up to snuff,\" he lectures calming down some to stay in one spot, placing his hands on his hips. \"When they think he's hurting the team.\" He finishes with a much softer tone. Silence follows the statement. Dahlia stops toying with her cut lip when Sheryl elbows her insisting that she, \"stop messing with it already!\" \"This is a public school program. I will never, ever cut a player who comes out to play for me, but when you put that uniform on, that Titan uniform, you better come to work.\" He announces pointing at his own chest for emphasis. He quickly glances down at Dahlia before warning her, \"That means you too Ms. Black.\" She glances up with a smirk sending at him a mock salute. \"We will be perfect,\" he booms as the statement echoes off the walls of the cathedral like room. \"In every aspect of the game. You drop a pass, you run a mile. You miss a blocking assignment, you run a mile.\" Dahlia cringes at the harsh demands. \"You fumble the football, and I will break my foot off in your John Brown hind parts.\" He shouts causing Dahlia to chuckle a little along with Sheryl. \"And then you will run a mile. Perfection!\" Coach Boone finishes his speech. Dahlia could see that his recent statement bothered Coach Tyrell, but she shrugs it off. She assumes it was because of the statements blunt nature. She honestly thought it was hilarious. \"Let's go to work.\" He excuses everyone. As they begin to leave to head towards their rooms for the night Dahlia stays back until everyone left before getting up, herself. \"Now what happened here?\" Coach Yoast asks walking up to the two girls. Dahlia glances at the older man and smiles softly, mindful of her lip. \"I got hit trying to separate the boys,\" she admits calmly, almost as if it were no big deal. \"Yeah! You should've seen her daddy! When Bertier caught her she broke his nose!\" Sheryl chirps in happily from behind the taller girl. \"Sheryl! I told you to stay in the room!\" She quickly scolds the younger girl while ruffling her hair. Yoast stares at the two interact and smiles, Dahlia would learn that Sheryl doesn't always do what she's told. \"Now, what's this I'm hearing about you gettin' hit?\" Coach Boone asks as he walks over to their new photographer to catch a look at her bruising face. \"It really ain't much Coach! I grew up with older brothers, so this is nothing,\" she once again waves off licking her wounded lip once more, \"it'll heal.\" \"Good. You can take a hit.\" Boone responds with a laugh, clapping the girl on her shoulder. \"I think this belongs to you,\" Dahlia turns to face the person who spoke to see Coach Hinds. She stares at what he's holding out to her; Two shirts that looked to be about her size. \"Well it's a bit small for you, but I'd be glad to take them off your hands,\" She jokes easily, causing Hinds to laugh. \"What is it?\" She asks seriously, taking them and holding them out in front of her to see them better. She grins once she realizes they were red collared T.C. William shirts, much like the ones the coaches were wearing. \"I get my own!?\" She exclaims excitedly clutching the two articles close to her chest. \"Well of course! You a part of the Titans family now aren't you?\" Coach Hinds points out before patting the girls head and leaving the room. \"I hope you did as I told you and packed appropriate clothing, Ms. Black.\" Boone addresses causing Dahlia to give him her complete attention. \"Yes! I packed some pants and shoes Coach,\" she informs him causing both men and Sheryl to nod. \"Well, alright. You'll be adding this to your wardrobe as well.\" Boone announces tossing her something which she catches by instinct before it hit her in the face. Opening the folded material she finds a simple white jersey staring back at her. Confused, she looks to Coach Boone with furrowed brows. Coach Yoast seems to display the same expression as Boone begins to chuckle. \"I'll expect to see you wearing that for warm ups tomorrow. You didn't think I'd let you off lightly after intruding in on someone's private conversation, especially my own, now did you?\" Dahlia sags visibly at the thought of having to work out so intensely and mumbles, 'I said I didn't mean to spy on y'all.' \"You will be joining the boys for half of their workouts every other day we are here at camp. The rest of your days will be spent helping out where it's needed and taking shots of the boys.\" Dahlia only nods dejectedly in response. \"Alright now! You two go get ready for bed. We have a long day ahead of us.\" Coach Yoast says causing the two girls to bid them a goodnight before walking towards their room. \"I can't believe you got a jersey before I've ever had one,\" Sheryl pouts as they walk to their room. Dahlia glances down to the younger girl before laughing at her face. \"If you want the consequence that comes with it, you can have it.\" she responds causing Sheryl to scoff lightly and tell her to, \"Stop being such a baby.\" The older girl glares at her slightly for the jab. \"Uh… Doll?\" A voice calls out causing the two girls to look back to see Bertier standing there awkwardly. Sheryl seems to look back up to Dahlia, concerned for her. Dahlia hesitates, but quickly notices how nervous Gerry. Standing there with lowered shoulders and dejected expression on his bruised face, she could feel her heart go out to him. \"Go on Sheryl. You can bathe first, I'll be there in a few,\" she mutters to the younger girl who nods and continues to their room. When Sheryl was further down the hall Dahlia glances back to stare at Bertier expectantly. \"Look,\" he begins as he walks steps to her. His head was hung in shame and he seemed at lost for words. He was always taught by his mama to never hit a girl, and he had broken that rule today. \"I just wanted to say I'm sorry about hittin' you earlier. I didn't mean-\" He tries to rush out before a finger was gently placed on his lips causing him to halt his rambling. \"It's alright Gerry. I ain't mad at you no more,\" Dahlia insists softly, taking her finger away as Gerry continues to appear troubled, \"I can take a hit, and besides I broke your nose afterwards, I think I should be apologizin' to you.\" This statements causes Gerry to gently touch his bruised nose before letting out a chuckle. \"You've got one hell of a left hook there, bruiser.\" He jokes causing them both to laugh. \"So, you sure you aren't mad at me?\" He asks once again. \"Nah, I can never stay mad for too long after I blow off steam,\" She responds throwing the shirts she was holding over her shoulder, \"just promise me one thing.\" The request causes Gerry to raise an eyebrow in wonder. \"What's that?\" He asks after a bit of silence. \"Don't go fightin' with any more of your teammates over petty things, or so help me I will break more than just your nose,\" She threatens dangerously causing Gerry to flinch at the thought. \"What if they deserve it?\" He asks as she turns to walk away. \"It depends on your definition of \"deserves it,\" cause the color of their skin should not be one of those reasons,\" she hints shooting a quick glance back at Gerry. She found out later from Alan that the fight was over a poster Julius had hung up, which caused Dahlia to take a few moments for herself to calm down. \"Night Bertier! Hope your pretty face heals up nicely! Wouldn't want your girlfriend to dump you,\" she jabs as she takes her leave. Gerry swatches her go, leaving him standing alone in the hallway. He didn't know how to respond to what she said, he didn't understand why she was always sticking up for their kind instead of her own. Julius who had heard their exchange in the hall from his room was surprised by the girl's words, and could feel a small smile appear on his usual hard face. This girl seems different than the rest. What type of girl ran right into the middle of a brawl? She even took a hit without shedding no tears, and went and broke his cracker-headed roommate's nose. Now she was standing up for them? She had more heart than any other white person he's met by far… And he had to admit, he enjoyed the change. Alright! Hope you enjoyed!

Disclaimer: I own none of the original character, they all begin to Disney! A Black and White Film: A Titan's Documentary Chapter Four: Ain't Too Proud To Beg The next morning was literal hell for poor Dahlia. She was never a fan of waking early and having a loud and persistent little roommate to make sure she was up in time for warm-ups, was not pleasant at all. Little Yoast who decided to jump on her until she had woken up this morning, earned herself a semi-gentle tickle tackle. \"So, how do I look Sheryl?\" Dahlia asks lazily while tying her hair up into a messy bun on the top of her head. The smaller girl stares at her older roommate from her bed and smiles in approval. Sheryl silently decides that she likes Dahlia dressed this way much better than the way she was before, with all them dresses and such. She has these long white fitted waist-high pants that ties in the front much like the shoes she herself wore everyday. She also had on these black shoes that seemed to be some type of converse and the white plain jersey she wore was a tad big for her, but she had tied it to the side to help with that. Dahlia looks like she belongs on the field with the guys and Sheryl respects that. Seeing Dahlia like this, makes her feel less different than most girls who wore dresses all the time and fussed about their hair. It strangely gives her a sense of comfort and familiarity knowing she wasn't so different from all the other girls. \"I like you this way better,\" she finally mutters softly causing Dahlia to stare at her with concern. She's never heard the usually rambunctious girl speak so quietly. She smiles at the smaller girl before brushing some of her fringe away from her eyes and to the side. \"Well, thank you kindly,\" she responds graciously as Sheryl happily joins her when she goes to exit the room. Once Dahlia was out on the field she groans at the heat that beams down on her. A long whistle is heard from the group of guys who were huddled together, calling her attention. Dahlia rolls her eyes and turns to glare at Petey, who had been the one to whistle. \"Now would you looky here!\" He announces loudly catching the attention from the other guys who turn to stare as well, \"Why are you dressed like this Baby Doll?\" He asks throwing his arm around her shoulder like he usually does, causing a few of his fellow white teammates to glare harshly. \"Not that I don't appreciate the view or nothin',\" he adds as an after thought causing Dahlia to laugh a little at the way he moves his eyebrows at her suggestively. \"Man, would you get off of her! She don't want no man shorter than her hittin' her up like this!\" Blue steps up pulling Petey away from her and into a headlock. This gets a couple of others to laugh as Petey struggles to get away from Big Ol' Blue half-heartedly. \"Morning Dolly!\" Louie greets with a hug that literally sweeps her off her feet. \"Why are you dressed out like us today?\" He asks while placing her back down onto her feet. Dahlia, in reply sighs and reluctantly begins to stretch for the day to come. \"Coach Boone says I'm suppose to work out with ya'll for a bit,\" she grumbled still tired from her rude awakening. This statement catches the attention of more of the guys. \"What!\" Came Gerry's voice from some bits away. Alan and Ray also heard what she said and were shocked as well. Ray seemed a tad irritated, while Alan couldn't help but smile a bit as he realizes there would be something to stare at while he suffered through all this. Not that he'd ever say that aloud or admit how creepy that sounded even to himself. \"What are you smiling about?\" Ray asks. This catches Alan off guard as he quickly drops the smile he didn't even realize he had. \"Nothing man,\" he denies causing Ray to scoff lightly before smirking at him mischievously. He never did like to mention when he was crushing on a girl to the guys. They always seemed to get the girl he wanted in the end. \"You sure it ain't got nothing to do with little miss doll over there,\" he says sarcastically. Alan grew quiet which gets Ray to laugh before punching him in the shoulder. \"Alright, alright!\" Alan gave in, \"It may have a little something to do with her.\" \"She is pretty fine isn't she? I wouldn't mind taking her out,\" Ray responds casually causing Alan to furrow his brows slightly, \"Its too bad she hangs out with them niggers.\" He adds with a disgusted sneer. \"Yeah…\" Alan answers hesitantly. Gerry, who wasn't too far from them, had growled as he heard what Ray said. He knew just what Ray had meant and would make sure that he would definitely not be \"taking her out\" if he had anything to do with it. He knew how Ray treated girls, and Dahlia would not be one of those poor girls. \"Why?\" Rev asks joining Dahlia in stretching out for the day. \"It's my punishment,\" She answers casually as Rev raises a brow her way. She can feel his questioning stare and bites her lip before continuing, \"let's just leave it at, I was eavesdropping on things I shouldn't have.\" She mumbles causing Rev to shake his head slightly at her before laughing good heartedly. \"Don't laugh! I'm going to die!\" She states before pushing him slightly as her serious demeanor cracks and she begins to laugh as well. The guys around her just stare curiously at the two laughing figures. \"Alright boys!\" Coach Boone calls out catching everyone's attention, \"And Ms. Black.\" He finishes catching sight of her. He takes a moment to stare before nodding in approval at her choice of clothing. \"Let get down to business!\" He calls out before blowing on his whistle sharply. Dahlia had no idea how hard Coach Boone would run her, but this was too much. She had to admit Sheryl was a close second in the scariness factor. That little girl was intimidating and she seemed to be keeping a close eye on her in specific as she shouts out at them and calls out who ever was lagging behind. Coach Boone and Coach Yoast never made her do any of the contact warm ups, but she was there alongside the Titans as they did sit ups, up downs, sprints, and all that fun stuff. Despite suffering through all this she had found the Coaches words from the sidelines to be entertaining. Coach Yoast had once shouted out at one of players to jump on a ball like a starving man on a Christmas ham. She laughed quite loudly at that one in particular despite the pain it caused her already exhausted body. By the time Coach Yoast had pulled her to the side she was tired, sweaty, and could barely feel her legs. \"You doin' alright there?\" He asks resting a comforting hand on her shoulder. Dahlia looks up at him from her hunched over position and smiles, which painfully re-split her bruised lip. She was out of breath and could feel how her body would burn tomorrow, but other than that she felt good. \"I'm alright, Coach.\" She huffs while standing up straight, \"you guys run a hard camp out here.\" She compliments while gesturing down to her now completely dirtied attire. \"Hah, well don't you worry, I'm sure those stains will come out,\" he jokes as he squeezes her shoulder. Dahlia smiles in response before turning to stare at the guys who were now being taught plays. \"I'm guessing I should go and grab my camera?\" She asks causing Yoast to smile slightly, nodding at the dirt covered girl. She smiles and runs off to retrieve said camera from her room. While back in her room she decides that she should just stay in her filthy clothes. It'd be a waste of clean clothes if she changes now. Once on the field she could see that the guys were set up to run a play, and decides it would be best to get down to photographing them. The guys were running hard and Dahlia could tell that they would be exhausted after practice. She was shocked to see how easily Coach Boone would yank someone off to the side when they fell behind and bluntly tell them to go home. She was thankful that she didn't need to run through complete practices with them cause she was sure she wouldn't make it. She was fit, she just wasn't that fit. \"Fumble Fumble Fumble!\" Was heard as Dahlia pulls away from her camera with a frustrated sigh. That was nearly a perfect shot of Petey! \"What is wrong with you? Why are you fumbling my football?!\" Boone shouts at a panicked Petey who glanced around nervously. This caught Dahlia's attention and she glances up at the usually happy boy being once again told off by Big Bad Boone. \"If my blockers were better,\" he mumbled trying to defend himself, before flinching at Boone's loud and harsh reply of \"Your blockers!\" \"Your blockers ain't got nothin' to do with you holding the ball!\" He shouts getting progressively closer to Petey's face. \"Did your blockers fumble the football, or did you fumble the football!\" \"I did, sir.\" Petey answers his voice muffled by his mouthpiece. Everyone remains silent as they watch Boone tear Petey a new one. \"All right. How many feet are in a mile?\" Boone asks catching Dahlia off guard. She could hear Petey struggle to answer the question and didn't blame him. There was no way she'd be able to answer that on the spot either! She could see Boone smack Petey in the head a couple of times while repeating the question. \"5,280 feet! You pick this ball up, and you run every one of them!\" He answers the question himself before throwing the football away. Petey's eyes were glued to the ground as he turns and runs like he was told to. \"You're killing me, Petey! You're killing me!\" He shouts at Petey's retreating figure. Dahlia was stunned and felt horrible for Petey. She felt slight anger towards Coach Boone, but lets it slide and just thanked God Almighty that at least he didn't kick Petey off the team. He did say he wanted perfection after all. She could see that Coach Yoast was bothered by how Petey was being treated as well. \"I suppose I've taken enough pictures for today.\" Dahlia tells herself hesitantly before gently placing her camera down on the bench. Sheryl, who was sitting next to her, glances at her in question. \"Watch this for me, I'm going to run for a bit,\" She informs Sheryl before running to catch up with Petey. Coach Yoast smiles to himself as she ran past him, he hopes she can cheer the guy up a bit. \"Petey!\" She shouts as she catches up to him relatively quickly. She frowns as he refused to smile or even turn to greet her. He must have been really down. \"Petey?\" She tries again. He still refuses to look at her and seems to grip the ball even tighter, if possible. \"What is his problem!\" Petey finally snaps, although a bit out of breath from all the running, \"He's always doing that! He singles me out! I don't do well under all that pressure!\" He finishes shooting a frustrated look her way. \"It's all right, Petey. You're okay.\" She soothes him, but was surprised by the harsh glare she receives in turn. \"It's not okay! It's not enough we get heat from your people on the team, I have to deal with him constantly on my back! The very one I'd think to have it!\" He yells causing Dahlia to flinch at his cruel words, \"I can't deal with this. I've got half a mind to ditch this stupid camp.\" He finishes deflating slightly as he releases to last of his steam pent up anger. She remains silent as she scrambles to think of something to say. \"I'm sorry, Petey. You don't deserve this kind of treatment,\" she replies deciding to forget his offensive comment. He was angry and frustrated, so she'd accept it. This only got Petey to scoff irritably before picking up his pace. Dahlia lets out a heavy sigh before glancing up to the heavens and picking up her own pace to catch up. \"I'm serious. No one does. However, I don't think you should quit, Petey.\" This catches his attention and he glances at her quickly. \"You're a great player! You're quick on your feet and think on the field just as fast as you run. That's a valuable aspect as a player. Boone sees that and that's why he's so hard on you. He wants you to be perfect, which isn't fair to expect of you, but I know that you can do it,\" she encourages causing Petey to smile softly and slowing his pace again. Dahlia was grateful that he let up on his pace, she was losing her breath much too quickly. \"You serious?\" He questions her quietly. Looking at him Dahlia could see he was now staring at her and smiles at him. \"Of course I'm serious, dummy! I'm suppose to keep stats of every player! You're fast! One of the fastest on the team,\" she finishes. Dahlia continues to run with Petey until he ran his entire mile, and he even pulls him into a hug, acceptin' of the sweat and all. Coach Yoast who watched their exchange from afar was glad that she could pick the boy up out of his funk. Lunch quickly came around and Dahlia was excited to finally be able to eat after the exhausting day in the sun. She knew she was nowhere near as tired as the guys and wondered how on Earth they lasted through half the day. While looking for a seat she finds that Gerry was waving her over, but a hard look from Coach Boone tells her that she should help with the integrating a bit more. She smiles at Gerry apologetically before rejecting his offer. This brings a slight frown to his face as he watches her walk over to where Lastik was just sitting down with the rest of the colored guys. \"Look at those traders,\" Ray whispers from his side. Gerry glances back at him and Alan who was eating next to him. \"And would you look at that, she's a no good nigger lover too.\" Ray comments nastily, \"what a shame she'd a been a perfect-\" \"Shut up, Ray!\" \"Enough man!\" Both Gerry and Alan cut in angrily. They both didn't appreciate what he was about to say about the Titan's only female member. \"What you doin', man?\" Julius asks as Louie sits down. Dahlia was about to do the same, but pauses hearing the intimidating male. \"Eating lunch.\" Louie answers naively. \"I see you eatin' lunch.\" Julius responds looking at Louie's plate, \"but, why you eatin' over here? Why don't you go on over there and at with your people?\" He finishes while swallowing what was in his mouth, gesturing over to the side of the cafe which consists of all the white members of the team. \"Man, I don't have any people. I'm with everyone, Julius.\" Louie answers with a shake of his head and smile. Dahlia decides now was the time to sit in the only other available seat, which was right next to Rev. \"I agree,\" she chimes in announcing her presence to the rest of the players, who all but Julius, smile at her. \"Besides they're a bunch of close-minded losers over there,\" she adds jokingly causing the others' smiles to widen. Julius stares at her for a moment and remembers what he heard her say in the hall the previous night. \"Yeah! They're just a light skinned brother and sister!\" Blue who was next to Julius point out shaking Louie's hand and smiling Dahlia's way. \"Yeah, and I'm a dark-skinned cracker,\" Julius mumbles causing everyone to snicker. \"That's the spirit!\" Dahlia chirps in cheerfully causing the others to snicker a little harder. \"Come on, Julius, they're just two other blessed children in God's loving family!\" Rev states with a smile reaching out to hug both Louie and Dahlia closer to him. She laughs and gives Julius an angelic smile, much like Louie was doing. Suddenly Blue began to hum 'Amazing Grace' and throws an arm around Julius who quickly becomes agitated. \"Come on Blue. Let me-\" He begins but stops and sighs as Petey and the rest join in with Blue's humming. Dahlia beams and begins to harmonize with the rest as Rev preaches for the Lord to 'soften big Julius Campbell's heart'. Julius remains silent and rolls his eyes at the rest of the fools he calls his teammates. \"It's nice having a female here to add in the higher vocals,\" one of the other guys announce after they were done with their playful preaching. Dahlia smiles before giving a goofy bow then continuing to eat her food. \"Tell me 'bout it! Petey's voice just ain't cuttin' it no more!\" They all joke teasing the youngest on their team as he shoots glares at the rest of them. Dahlia begins to laugh catching sight of one player whose drink comes up and out of their nose, caught off guard by the joke. Back over to Gerry, Ray could once again be seen glaring at the rest who were now laughing and preaching again. \"Look at them. They're disgusting,\" he announces catching Gerry's attention once again as he glances over in Dahlia's direction. \"And Rev? He better be praying I block for his black behind,\" he sneers letting out a sarcastic laugh. This catches Gerry by surprise. \"Yeah, but, Ray, if you don't block you're not gonna start,\" He warns. \"I'll start.\" Ray states nodding his head, \"I'll just bide my time.\" He says then continues to eat his food. Gerry stares at him long and hard before shaking his head and continuing to eat as well, choosing to remain silent. \"Lastik!\" Boone calls out causing the room to fall silent as Louie stands up and at attention. Dahlia raises an eyebrow and decides to listen to what was going to happen. \"I want you to tell me something about one of your black teammates.\" Boone asks him as they stand with everyone's eyes on them. \"Sir, yes, sir! I'm rooming with Blue, sir, and I notice he wears those leopard-spotted underwears, bikini-style, sir!\" Dahlia, who had been drinking as that had been said, nearly chokes on her beverage before laughing quite loudly at a blushing Blue. \"That's definitely going in your stats!\" She announces causing the rest of the guys to roar with laughter at poor Blue who now has his head ducked down. Boone nods his head at Lastik's statement, it wasn't what he was expecting that was for sure, but it was something. \"Okay, maybe somebody who's not your roommate.\" He decides as the laughter finally begins to come to an end. \"Sir, I eat lunch with Rev.\" Dahlia looks over to see Rev was shocked, but a gentle smile makes its way to his face. She nudges him playfully as his smile grows wider. \"That's Jerry Harris, sir! People call him Rev 'cause he's always praying, and he won't abide a foul tongue, sir!\" Louie shouts causing others to shout out \"Rev!\" in response. Boone manages to keep a straight face, but Dahlia can tell that he was happy with Lastik. \"And what is the Rev gonna do after high school?\" He asks causing Louie to laugh and shake his head. \"I don't know. Go to college and all that, I guess.\" He answers lowering his tone. \"What about you? You gonna go to college?\" Boone asks. \"Oh, not me, Coach. I ain't a brainiac like Rev.\" He answers truthfully. \"Think you got a future in football?\" \"Ah heck, no. I just figure if I gotta be in school, I might as well hit some people while I'm at it.\" His answer causing some of the other players to chuckle. \"Alright, I like that. A self-aware man, I like that.\" Boone announces before leaning in to whisper something to Louie. Dahlia furrows her brows at what Louie said, and decided that she would document as much as she could for Louie and make sure that he'd definitely be going to college. Whether it was on a football scholarship, or not, she would make sure he'd get in. He deserves that. \"So, what kind of music does the Rev like?\" Coach asks once again grabbing everyone's attention with his loud voice. \"Oh, me and Rev both dig on The Temptations,\" he chirps before spinning and beginning to sing, \"I know you wanna leave me! But I refuse to let you go!\" Dahlia smiles and begins to bob her head and tap her feet as Rev begins to sing along with Louie. After a bit of nudging from Rev, she smiles and begins to sing as well, which the others follow soon after. She glances away from Louie's figure to see how Gerry was reacting. Gerry was smiling and chuckling lightly despite himself causing Dahlia to smile gleefully. Gerry was a great guy, but she couldn't be his friend if he continues to act so hateful towards another group of people. It just wasn't right. She knew that if anyone on the 'whites only' side were to begin accepting the black folk on this team, Gerry, who was their captain, needed to do that first. Gerry meets Dahlia's gaze and she sticks her tongue out at him while dancing, causing him to laugh out loud. Alan who was just behind Gerry was dancing as well which makes Dahlia's heart continue to swell with happiness. Maybe Gerry didn't have to be the first accepting one of the group. \"Okay, all right.\" Boone finally chuckles as he begins to grin, his stoic mask finally cracking. \"Stop begging.\" He jokes looking out at the rest of the room as it grows quiet once again. \"Anybody else?\" He challenges pacing the room slightly. He glances at Dahlia for a slight bit before shaking his head, he knew she knew more people than her own race, so he wasn't going to ask her. \"No volunteers?\" He asks while his smile melts off his face. Dahlia looks around the room and frowns as everyone tries to avoid eye contact with their coach. \"Campbell?\" Boone call out, said boy glances up before shaking his head in surprise at the offer. \"Bertier?\" He tried again. Dahlia glances at him in hope, but sighs when he just stares at Coach Boone, before looking at his food. \"No, huh?\" Boone verifies as he stares the room down in disappointment. Dahlia knew this wouldn't end well. \"Each one of you will spend time everyday with a teammate of a different race.\" All eyes were now on Boone as he spoke, \"You will learn about him and his family, his likes, his dislikes. You will report back to me until you meet every one of your teammates. Until that time, we go to three-a-day practices.\" This gets many of them to groan and complain. Dahlia's eyes widen as she realizes that this means she would be warming up with them longer than usual. \"If you continue to ignore each other, we go to four-a-day practices. Now, is there any part of this you don't understand?\" He announces as everyone continues to complain. Dahlia was irritated, she just couldn't understand why everyone was so against liking each other! It wasn't that hard! Hating took so much more effort. While she was walking back to her room, she could see and hear a bunch of the guys 'getting to know each other'. Boone had told her she was excused from this activity, because she knew a bunch about the guys already. She was also thankful to hear that she would no longer be training with the boys because of their punishment and now would be warming up with Sheryl. She didn't know whether she should be relieved or terrified. She walks past Ray and Petey sitting together and couldn't help but roll her eyes as Ray insults Petey with questions like, \"You do have a Dad, right?\" She knew that guy had a mean streak. And boy… was it beginning to show. She'd have to keep an eye on him. She peers over at Petey and could tell he was growing tired of Ray's snide remarks. Rolling her eyes she decides to walk away before she says something out loud. She was tired and could feel her body starting to ache from earlier today. She used to run with her brothers, but in truth that was years ago, and they did tend to carry her on their backs most of the way. She shrugs and decides to shower now that they were excused for the day. Walking past the many rooms leading to her own,she could hear country music playing from somewhere in the hall and laughs as she hears, \"Does cruel and unusual punishment mean anything to you!\" She thought that had sounded a lot like Blue… Which reminds her, she needs to add that little known fact about his infatuation with leopard-spotted, bikini-styled underwear to his bio.

A Black and White Film: A Titans Documentary Chapter Five: He's Watching Her With Those Eyes The next day came all too quickly for Dahlia and she was pleasantly surprised with how workouts went with Sheryl. She works her hard, there was no doubt about that, but it wasn't nearly as bad as she thought it would be. It mostly consists of workouts that would help with building up her speed and stamina. She even had to run with weights tied around her ankles the entire time. She quickly decided she absolutely hated that part. \"You did good today, Black!\" Sheryl exclaims smiling, addressing Dahlia like she did with all the other guys on the team. Dahlia who was too busy catching her breath flashes her a thumbs up in response before collapsing on the ground to take a breather. \"You think so?\" She finally manages from her position on the ground after finally catching her breath. Sheryl laughs and plops down next to her to watch the boys work out across the field. \"Yeah! With me training you every morning here at camp, you'll be faster than those guys by the end of it!\" She assures the dark haired beauty beside her. Dahlia smiles before ruffling Sheryl's hair and standing up to dust off her clothing which was similar to her outfit yesterday. \"Coach Boone sure is working them hard,\" Dahlia whistles as she watches the guys go. Sheryl was silent for a bit before nodding her head in agreement. Taking photos for that day's practice wasn't very eventful and that saddened Dahlia a lot. She was supposed to be showing Coach Boone her progress every night, but recently she's doesn't think she had caught anything worth while. Coach Boone had pat her on the back the other night and simply told her that things would improve as the boys improved. She was thankful for the reassurance, but she'll be a little anxious until that time comes. She was worried she was losing her touch and mentally curses as she realizes the only way she'd find out was after she developed the film later today. \"Hey, Sheryl?\" Dahlia asks her small friend as they walk back to their room from practice. Sheryl glance up to the girl she was warming up to and considers a big sister she never really had with a frown. The look Dahlia was giving her tells her exactly what she needs to know. \"Do you have to do it in our room?\" Sheryl whines as she glares lightly at Dahlia in protest, \"that liquid you use smells funny and it stinks up the entire room!\" She complains while pinching her nose at the mere thought of the smell. This causes Dahlia to smile and laugh at the girls complaints. \"I know it smells funny Sheryl. I'm sorry, I'll lock myself in the bathroom this time,\" she offers causing Sheryl to glance up at her in interest at said bargain, \"you just have to go elsewhere to use the bathroom while I'm in there, deal?\" Dahlia asks while holding her hand out. Sheryl thinks about it for a second and nods while grabbing the out held hand. \"All right, deal!\" She announces cheerfully. Sheryl had to admit she thought it was cool watching Dahlia develop the film despite the funny smelling liquids used. She had asked Dahlia previously why she had to put the film in a covered container while developing, she had wanted to actually see the process of the images appearing, but Dahlia simply stated that the film would literally die in the light and had to be developed in the dark. \"You think maybe one day I could help you?\" Sheryl asks cautiously. Dahlia was quick to answer with a hug, which surprises the younger girl. \"Of course you can help me!\" She states pulling away and messing the girl's already hectic hair, \"I could use the help every once in awhile.\" For the next couple of hours, Dahlia locked herself in the bathroom to begin developing the photos. Sheryl was reading some comics to pass the time, usually she would go out and play catch with Dahlia after the boys practice, but that wouldn't be happening today. Knocking on their room's door brought Sheryl's attention up to see Gerry push the door open slightly. \"Hey, Bertier!\" She calls out, happy to see the familiar and brotherly team captain. Gerry smiles and lifts the small girl up in a warm-hearted greeting. \"Hey Sheryl!\" He greets back while placing the laughing girl down. \"You guys need to shape up out there!\" She quickly begins to scolds causing him to chuckle lowly at her sudden change of attitude, \"Don't laugh! Seriously! You're upsetting Dahlia! Letting her down!\" She yells, frustrated. Gerry quickly stops chuckling, what did she mean by that? \"Dahlia? Why's she upset?\" He asks Sheryl looking around for her missing roommate, now that he thought about it he hadn't seen Dahlia since practice ended. \"She came here to take pictures of you all, but you're all playing like a bunch of sissies out there!\" She scolds causing Gerry to frown at the statement. This girl was cruel, it wasn't his fault the others play like they hadn't played football before. \"Aren't you ashamed of the way you're all playing! You're their leader! And you're going to continue leading this team right into the ground if you don't do something about it!\" She continues to lecture. Gerry sighs and rubs his neck in exasperation. \"Okay, Sheryl, I get it.\" He states trying to bring a halt to the Mini-Coach's rant, \"I'll try harder to whip the boys into shape,\" he tries to appease her. She seems to stare at him for awhile before sighing and accepting the probably empty words. \"You better, or I'll do it!\" She tells him in a huff, causing him to laugh and pat her head. \"Now, speaking of Dahlia, where's she at?\" He asks looking around the room, \"I haven't seen her in awhile.\" Sheryl rolls her eyes and point at their bathroom, Gerry's eyes widen in horror at the thought. \"She's been in there this whole time?!\" He asks, concerned. \"Well yeah, she's developing her photos,\" Sheryl admits causing Gerry to visibly relax, he wasn't exactly thinking that's what she was doing in there. Before Gerry could ask something else a loud elated shout comes from behind the locked door. \"Yes!\" Dahlia cheers to herself as she finally runs across a nice shot. It seems that despite the disappointing day she managed a few good shots, but two of them really stood out to her. Squinting at the small negatives she identifies that they were of Julius and Rev. She quickly cuts the long reel of film into strips and slips them in the safety of a clear plastic pocket. Holding them up to the light once more she smiles at her success. \"Sheryl!\" She shouts excitedly as she opens the bathroom door to reveal a now clean bathroom. To her surprise she comes face to face with an amused Gerry Bertier instead, \"Gerry!\" She gasps out. \"Hey!\" He says catching her before she runs straight into him. \"What have you been up to?\" He asks casually causing a smile to spread wickedly on her face as she holds up a couple of clear pages of negatives. Sheryl had hopped off her bed and up to Dahlia in glee grabbing one of the sleeves to look at what Dahlia had caught. \"I was developing.\" She answers simply. Gerry raises an eyebrow and lets her go as he stares at the black squares she showed him. \"Uhh…\" He says, not really sure what he was looking at. Dahlia rolls her eyes before holding it up to the light revealing the images. Gerry laughs at his own expense and stares at the little things in slight delight. They were pretty cool. \"Look! This one is of you.\" She points at one of the small squares, causing Gerry to squint to try and see it. \"Can I have it?\" He asks her causing her to lower the negatives. \"Well, if you take me to develop these after camp, I'll give it to you,\" she bargains causing Gerry to happily agree. Dahlia thanks him and seems to recall just why she was so excited in the first place. \"Julius!\" She shouts causing Gerry to stare at her in confusion. \"I need to find him!\" She explains while pushing past Gerry to exit the room. Sheryl stares up at Gerry who stood there for a moment with a strange look on his face. He sighs and shrugs deciding he'd talk to her later. \"Campbell!\" Dahlia had called out as she spotted him in the hall. He stops walking and turns around confused. When he sees her running up to him he sighs and shakes his head reassuring himself that she wasn't as bad as the others. He'd be kind to her as long as she was kind in return. \"Hi!\" She greets him quickly once she caught up to him. He can see some of the other white boys stare in their direction which irritates him a bit. Why couldn't they mind their own business? He nods in response and watches as she excitedly looks down at what was held in her hands. \"I wanted to show you this! You did great in practice today,\" she finally says as she continues to look through the negatives in her hand. Julius raises both his brows in surprise at this statement and opens his mouth to thank her until a page of them were shoved towards him. \"Here look!\" She states giddily holding them up to the light. He hesitantly grabs the page and continues to hold it up, squinting to get a closer look at the small image portrayed. \"You- You took this?\" He asks her as he stares at the negative in awe. This girl made him look good, real good, from what he could see at least. He looked dang well near professional! From what he could see of the image it was of him tackling one of them white boys quite violently. It was like she stopped time to capture the single moment. \"Of course I did!\" Dahlia responds happily as she watches him for a clear reaction, \"Do you like it? I'll only use things in your profile if you like them,\" she asks suddenly growing slightly nervous. This catches Julius off guard. He didn't think she'd be fair while making everyone's profile, he thought she'd pay more attention to them white boys like Bertier. This girl really was something. \"You're pretty good at this,\" Julius finally responds while handing the page back to it's owner, who was still staring at him curiously. \"I like it. You should keep it.\" He admits, as Dahlia smiles gratefully at him. \"Thank you! I'm glad you like it! I'll give you a copy when I print them!\" She tells him while taking it back. She seems to look around in search of something before turning back to stare at him. \"Would you happen to know where Rev's room is at?\" \"Why do you need to know that?\" He asks curiously before trying to recall which room was Rev's. \"Well, I caught a nice photo of him as well! I wanted to get his approval on it too,\" she answers sheepishly. Julius seems to be still for a bit before nodding and pointing towards a door a bit down the hall. \"Thanks!\" she tells him once again and begins to walk away. \"Hey!\" She hears Julius call out. Slowing her pace, she turns around to stare at him in question. \"Thanks. I really appreciate what you're doing for us,\" Julius says gratefully with, much to Dahlia's surprise, a gentle smile directed towards her. She nods in response before continuing to Rev's room. Something told her he was thanking her for more than just the photo. \"Nobody in my family ever went to no college!\" Dahlia hears a voice coming from the room. The door was opened so she didn't feel like she was prying too much into their privacy. She stays behind the door frame and listens in a little more. \"I'll tutor you, Louie, I told you.\" Comes the calm reply from Rev. Dahlia furrows her brows and decides to reveal herself by leaning against the door frame, hiding the negatives behind her back as she listens to Louie continue to panic. She catches Rev glancing at her quickly from over his bible before switching back to Louie in concern. \"I'm white trash! I ain't gonna' get no C+ grades!\" He continues to go on ignoring Rev's attempts to calm him down. Dahlia crosses her arms, careful of the negatives, and continues to stare. Rev seems to shoot her a slightly exasperated expression. \"I'm just down-home, no-good, never-going-to-no-college, white trash, man! All right?!\" He finally finishes throwing his hands up in the air. Dahlia frowns and steps forward to say something and help out. \"Louie…\" She calls out softly catching his attention relatively quickly. He seems extremely upset, and if she didn't know any better he seemed to be about to cry as well. Rev looks to her, curious as to what she was going to say. \"You're nothing like white trash, Louie,\" She soothes, placing the negatives she held on a bed before walking over to give him a hug. He remains still for a bit before lowering his head to her shoulder and hugging her back. Rev shuts his bible and places it beside him while sitting up a bit to watch what else would happen. \"You have a soul as good as gold, and ain't no education gonna' teach you that, Louie,\" she tells him gently while rubbing the big teddy bear's back as he begins to calm down. \"You'll be able to get those grades you wanted! With Rev tutoring you,\" she glances over at Rev who smiles in assurance, \"and me helping you out, there ain't going to be a college in sight that won't take you in.\" Louie backs away from her slowly and looks genuinely surprised. \"You really mean that?\" He asks her after a bit of silence. She smiles brightly at him before nodding enthusiastically. There was just something about the way she smiled that made both Rev and Louie believe in what she had said. \"Of course I do! I promise you that! And I never break a promise!\" Louie smiles and glances over at Rev who simply nods as well. \"You're going to help me too?\" Louie asks staring at his little Dolly in front of him. \"I probably ain't as smart as Rev,\" she responds casually while looking over at Rev who begins to rub his neck in slight embarrassment, \"but I'll help you in every other way I know how!\" She reassures him earning herself a hug so tight it squeezed the air right out of her small frame. \"I'm sorry I interrupted your bonding time,\" Dahlia apologizes to the two friendly players when she was finally released from a now cheered up Louie. \"It's fine, Dahlia,\" Rev notes as Louie waves it off as well. \"Did you need something?\" He asks moving so that he was sitting at the edge of his bed. Dahlia seems to suddenly remember what she came in for and grabs the negatives before excitedly going to sit next to Rev, who scoots over to make some room. \"I wanted to show you the picture I caught of you, Mr. Quarterback!\" She answers while plopping down on the bed next to him. He smiles and moves a little closer to peer over her shoulder at the small images. Even Louie stood up and tried to catch a glimpse of the pictures she took as she filtered through the pages of them. \"How's your lip doing?\" Rev asks catching sight of the fading bruise on the side of her jaw. \"I told you, you shouldn't have gone in there.\" He seems to mumble causing her to glance over and smile widely before flinching as her lip split once again. \"Well, it was fine 'til just now.\" She jokes glancing over at Louie and Rev with a smaller smile than before. \"It's getting better though!\" She informs them, before licking her lip in an attempt to stop the bleeding. \"I just showed Julius his, and he liked it,\" she continues happily causing the two boys to glance at each other in moderate surprise. They were impressed by the shots that she captured despite them playing so horribly out there. The negatives looked to be crisp and clear. It was no lie, they weren't playing too well considering no one really like each other out there. Yet, she caught pictures of them that highlighted each player as if they were golden! \"Here you go!\" She says handing one of the pages over to Rev, as Louie moves closer to look as well. Dahlia sits there quietly watching the wide-eyed pair stare at the sheet of negatives while holding it up to catch some light. \"I hope you like yours as well,\" she says beginning to grow a nervous again at their scrutinization. Rev was taken aback. He knew he wasn't the best player, but this picture sure made him feel like it. The guys around him were on the ground caught in the act of tackling each other, only he could be seen standing and aiming to throw. The sunset in back of him made the lighting dramatic enough to appear like he was about to throw a winning pass. It was an amazing picture. and he felt a wide grin begin to grow on his face. \"You sure know how to take photos, Dolly.\" Louie tells her causing her to laugh and thank him graciously. \"Do you like it, Rev?\" She asks after taking notice of his silence. He practically beams at her and gives the page back. \"I love it! I can't wait to see what you catch of us once we're on the field,\" he tells her shaking his head. \"If we ever get on the field,\" Louie adds in sourly. Rev and Dahlia chuckle at his response and pat the big guy's shoulders. \"You guys will get there,\" Dahlia states while standing up, \"and I'll be there to capture all of your winning moments along the way.\" She replies, causing the two to give her doubtful looks. They were horrible right now and weren't sure they'd win at all with where they were at now. \"Just… Give the others some time,\" she says after taking in their doubtful looks, \"they'll come around and see how stupid they're acting.\" Walking towards the door she turns to look back at them and smiles. \"If not, I'm sure Coach Boone will beat some sense into them eventually,\" she offers as she leaves the room. Rev and Louie glance at each other and begin to chuckle. \"I pray we survive till then,\" Rev says while rubbing his sore shoulders from practice. They were being worked to the bone and he wasn't sure if they'd live through much more of this. \"Dahlia sure is nice,\" Louie seems to speak his thoughts with a soft smile on his face. \"Not many people are as nice as her here. Plus she's talented with that little box she's always carrying around,\" he continues on causing Rev to agree with him. \"She sure is, Louie.\" He states a bit wistfully, before suggesting they continue with their so called \"mandatory\" bonding time. After looking around for awhile, Dahlia finally lets out a sigh as she catches sight of Coach Boone talking to Coach Yoast and Hinds. Coach Tyrell was no where in sight, but that didn't bother Dahlia too much considering she was just relieved to have finally found who she had been searching for in this huge college campus. \"Coach!\" She calls out as she happily jogs over to the three men who look over to her in response. \"Well, if it isn't Ms. Black.\" Coach Boone greets before patting the seat next to him for the photographer to take. She quickly obliges and places the sheets of negatives onto the table. \"I've come to show you the shots I've got today. There's a few good ones, but there are two that I'm really proud of!\" She chatters off excitedly causing the coaches to look at each other with slight smirks. This young lady had a way of warming up in other people's hearts. \"Do you mind taking a look at them now? Or should I come back later?\" She asks glancing over at Coach Hinds and Yoast who looked curious. \"No, now come on I'm sure they'll be alright with it, show us what you got,\" he chuckles lightly, while gesturing to her work. She grins before passing them out amongst the coaches who proceed to hold them up and squint to see what she caught. After looking at them Boone pats her on the shoulder and tells her she was doing a great job, the other two remain silent. \"Now, make sure you give me a copy of those photos when you get the chance!\" Coach Boone hollers to Dahlia as she was leaving. She turns to smile and gives him the a-okay sign before leaving the room. Boone had particularly enjoyed a few of those photos and decided to add some keepsakes to his books. He turns to the other coaches who were silent throughout the entire ordeal. \"So?\" He asks them chuckling at their astonished faces. \"Didn't I tell you she was good?\" \"That girl is better than good!\" Coach Hinds announces with a booming voice while laughing in joy. Coach Yoast smiles as well. \"I'd say we're lucky to have her,\" he states causing Boone to glance over at him with a smirk. \"Now don't tell her that. Don't want it to go to her head.\" He jokes causing the others to chuckle as well. \"Well dang! Let it get to her head! She's great! I can't wait to see what she actually catches during games.\" Coach Hinds voices while scratching his chin in wonder. \"I think I just thought of something else for her to do to give us a competitive edge,\" Coach Boone announces causing the two others to glance at him in wonder. \"She did mention she owned a video camera, right?\" He wonders out loud. The coaches stare, but Boone just smiles and waves it off, deciding to keep his plans to himself until the time came. Dahlia makes her way back to her room, a small skip to her step. Perhaps Coach Boone was right about things getting better as the boys got better. He seemed to like more pictures she had taken today than previously. \"Would you hurry up and get off the phone? I gotta' call my girl too, man!\" She can hear shouts and groans coming from around the corner. Curious she speeds up and turns the corner to see a bunch of the guys waiting in a long line. Confused, she glances around them to see Gerry at the front of the line talking on the phone. The only phone on campus too. She laughs to herself at the ridiculous sight before her catching the attention of a few of the guys who turn and greet her. \"Oh, oh, don't do this right now.\" She hears Gerry say to whoever was on the other side of the call. Dahlia guessed it was his girlfriend he told her about once. She walks past the guys to stand by the few in front. She could see Blue, Petey, Ray, and Alan were the first few in line. \"Hey, man, what is this, Wild Kingdom?\" Petey finally asks causing Gerry to turn around and yell \"Shut up, ya'll!\" Dahlia chuckles again at just how flustered he was getting and walks up to the guys. \"What's going on?\" She asks them as groans were continued to be heard from the others. \"Hey! No cutting Black!\" One of the guys from the back shouts at Dahlia jokingly causing said girl to pull at her eye and stick her tongue out at them obnoxiously. This causes the others to chuckle at her behavior. \"Shut it! I ain't got no beau to call like you girls!\" She insults the rest of them receiving glares as she laughs. \"Anyways, before I was rudely interrupted. What's going on?\" She asks the few in the front. \"Gerry's been on that phone for eternity!\" Alan turns to tell her with an exasperated expression on his face. He looks tired and his hair was all out of place up from constantly pulling at it. \"He's talking to his girlfriend, Emma.\" Ray adds in with a huff as well. Dahlia seems to shake her head and listen in to what Gerry was saying. He seemed to be trying to whisper things, but it sounded like he was getting a little anxious. \"Well, what's taking him so long?\" She asks, as Petey shouts at Gerry some more causing him only to become more agitated. \"Emma's probably teasing him.\" Ray answers turning to smirk back at her, \"probably trying to get him to say something embarrassing.\" He laughs slightly, as Alan chuckles as well. It sounds like something Emma would do. \"Really? What could be so darn embarrassing that it makes him get like that?\" She asks while gesturing to Gerry who was hunched over and glancing back at the guys hesitantly. Before anyone could answer her, she hears the answer to her question. \"I love you, sugar.\" She glances at Gerry with wide eyes as all the guys begins to laugh hysterically at him as he quickly hangs up the phone. Petey begins to mock him as he storms away sporting a nice shade of red on his face. The only one who seems to have a bit of composure left was Ray, but even he had a slight smile on his face. \" Guys, \" Dahlia mumbles before chuckling to herself and walking away from the bunch of guys who were still laughing at Gerry's expense. As she walks away, Ray quickly elbows Alan causing him to stop laughing and look at him, holding his side in pain. \"Didn't you hear what she said?\" He asks causing Alan to grow confused. Ray rolls his eyes and crosses his arm with a smirk, \"She doesn't have a beau . She's single.\" He says, his smirk only growing wider. Alan seems to stare at him before growing irritated. \"Man, she wouldn't go out with you!\" Alan snaps causing Ray to stare at him surprised, \"Besides, you've already got a girl you're talking to.\" Alan catches himself and tries to defend his statement. Ray thinks about it for a second before rolling his eyes and chuckling darkly. \"Yeah, you're probably right. She loves their kind anyways,\" Ray retorts while looking over to their darked-skinned teammates. Alan once again furrows his brows at Ray's response growing uncomfortable with the tone used. \"Besides, you probably want her all to yourself, don't you?\" He states looking over at Alan with a knowing glance. \"What are you talking about, man!\" Alan scoffs while fixing his hair nervously. His cheeks were heating up and this caused Ray to laugh at his expense before shoving him jokingly. Alright! Sorry for the long waits before updates!

A Black and White Film: A Titans Documentary Chapter Six: Ooh Child, Things Are Gonna Get Easier \"What was that!\" Sheryl shouts, before groaning and pacing back and forth. Dahlia sighs in frustration too as she lowers her camera away from her face. There were literally no good shots to be caught today. \"I can't get even one decent shot,\" She mutters at Sheryl's side. Since she finished her workouts for the day and picked up her camera, the guys seemed to be unable to run any plays without problems. She could see by the coaches' faces that they were beginning to lose their patience too. \"I'm not surprised you can't catch anything. With them playing like that, even a professional like you wouldn't be able to catch anything!\" Sheryl answers, then continues to rant as she angrily throws her hands up as the guys continue to miss blocks. Dahlia shakes her head as she watches a few of the guys closely. She knew they were doing it on purpose, through her camera she could see them do it. \"They're suppose to be a team. They're only hurting themselves by doing that,\" She spoke softly to herself, as she shut her camera off. It didn't seem like she'd be getting anything today anyways. \"What are y'all doing?!\" The sharp voice causes Dahlia to look up from her spot to see the players huddled up. Gerry, as their captain, seems to be giving them a lecture. She sits back and shakes her head knowing this wouldn't go well. \"Forty-four stack! You're supposed to know your jobs! Campbell, you're playing selfish, show-off football. Hold your man down,\" Gerry snaps pointing directly at Julius. Dahlia raises an eyebrow and leans forward, knowing that this definitely wasn't going to end well now. \"Don't you single me out like that. What, you think I'm stupid or something?\" Was Julius's reply. Dahlia shakes her head at the tell tale signs of another argument between the two roommates. She had to admit, Julius was slacking a bit, but he wasn't the only one. It really wasn't fair of Gerry to point him out like that. \"Listen, I'm the team captain, and I don't need you up on my face all the time!\" Gerry answers back while slamming into Julius' face mask. The boys begin to shout and fight once again causing Dahlia to stand and walk over to the coaches who weren't having it anymore. Boone blew his whistle and lets out an exasperated sigh, Dahlia shakes her head as well. The heat must be getting to them. \"I got it,\" Coach Hinds announces stepping forward to break up the fight. \"Ya'll didn't come out to practice! 'Cause champions pay the price! Lookin' like a bunch of bums out here!\" He shouts while walking forward. Dahlia steps up between Boone and Yoast and sighs rather loudly catching their attention. \"This is ridiculous,\" She mumbles causing the coaches to agree with her. She knew camp wouldn't be easy, but this was just insane. The boys seemed to fight more than they played recently. Practice continued on after that, and only got more intense as the boys' attitudes continued to fire up. Coach Boone was not happy with his team, and it didn't help when Dahlia had explained to him that she wasn't able to catch any good shots at all considering most of the players seemed to be purposely missing their assignments. She was relieved of her photographer duties for the rest of the day, but she remained on the field to watch the guys. \"Coach, we need a water break. We've been out here all day!\" Someone yells from the group as they continue waiting to be told to run forward and block the person across from them. Dahlia who was not even moving and sweating, agreed with Blue. They probably really did need water. \"What did you say?\" He asks after sharply blowing on his whistle. He got into Blue's face and Dahlia could tell that Blue knew he messed up. Coach Boone really was an intimidating man. \"I said we need a water break,\" he repeats himself a bit softer. \"You need a water break.\" Coach Boone states still up in Blue's face. \"Water is for cowards. Water makes you weak. Water is for washing blood off this uniform, and you don't get no blood on my uniform. Boy, you must be outside your mind!\" He shouts causing Dahlia to flinch. Honestly, if she could, she would have given the boys some water a long time ago. Looking at the other coaches, she could tell they probably felt the same way. It was hot out today and the guys were most likely on the verge of heat stroke. \"We are going to do up-downs until Blue is no longer tired and thirsty!\" Coach announces. \"He's kidding!\" Dahlia practically screams. Sheryl who was standing next to her shakes her head already knowing that this Coach Boone was no kidder. Dahlia furrows her brows in concern before shaking her head, \"They're going to die. I ain't going to be writing no stats, I'm going to be writing eulogies.\" She mutters to herself while rubbing her face in discontent. After a while of watching the boys continuously being tortured with up downs, Coach Yoast walks up to Sheryl and Dahlia, who seem to be playing some catch with a rogue football. Sheryl purposely making Dahlia run around for the ball, causing him to chuckle. Catching sight of him, Dahlia holds the ball and jogs over with a slight smile on her face. \"What's up, Coach?\" Sheryl asks her daddy while giving him a slight hug. Dahlia smiles at the two and waits to hear his response. She thought it was cute the way even Sheryl called him Coach. \"Well, I was thinking you two could get some water ready for the guys,\" he announces causing Dahlia to frown as she looks at the guys who seem to be barely able to continue on. She could see how tired and slow some of the guys were getting and she didn't have the heart to watch them suffer much longer. \"I think that's a good idea,\" Dahlia replies looking back to stare at Coach Yoast with a concerned expression, \"He's going to kill them, they need a break.\" She complains hoping that he could perhaps put a rest to Coach Boone's reign of terror. He was a good coach, but this was a little too much for Dahlia. Coach Yoast stares at her for a bit before nodding, he himself was beginning to worry about his boys. \"I know. I'll try to put an end to this,\" he agreed causing Dahlia to smile gratefully his way. \"You just worry about getting that water ready, they'll need it.\" \"Thanks, Coach Yoast.\" She says gratefully before running over to help Sheryl set up the water station. Yoast smiles as she tuns away, he notes that Dahlia was indeed improving with her speed. Sheryl had said that she was and he now believed her. \"How much cups do we need to make?\" Sheryl asks as she continues to fill cups. \"Just keep them coming those boys will need a lot of it,\" Dahlia says while ripping open another pack of them, \"Who knows how much they'll drink.\" Sheryl nods and begins to fill the cups with a bit more vigor. Dahlia stares out to the field as she hears Yoast yell out Boone's name. They seem to be whispering things to each other, but Boone continues to blow that infernal whistle making the boys drop down and up quickly. Finally it appears that Coach Yoast gets through to him, and he blows the final whistle. Collective sighs of relief could be heard from the guys as they all instantly ran over to get some water. One of them however, drops to the floor, pulls off his helmet and proceeds to throw up. This tugs at Dahlia's heart and she quickly grabs a cup and begins to jog over to the fallen figure. \"Where are you going!\" Sheryl calls out amongst the mass of boys who surround her. Dahlia glances back before smiling and waving her off. She was also slightly impressed with how the boys seemed to be waiting patiently for a cup from Sheryl. \"You'll be fine! You got this! I gotta take care of one,\" she shouts while gesturing over to the poor player who was still hunched over and heaving. Sheryl seems to understand and shoots her a thumbs up. Running over to the figure she was surprised to find it was Alan. She felt bad for him and found herself slightly angry that Coach Boone had worked them so hard. She hesitates for a bit, but eventually reaches out and grabs his helmet so he didn't have to hold it up anymore. She kneels down next to him rubs his back as he continues to dry heave. \"It's okay, Alan. You're all right,\" She finds herself saying in an attempt to comfort him. She didn't like seeing him like this, it hurt to see anyone she cared about suffering or in pain. She was weak in that sense. When it seemed like he was finished he finally leans back to sit down completely and turns to look back at Dahlia ashamed and embarrassed. \"You're not suppose to see me like this,\" he groans, quickly wiping his mouth off with the back of his hand. \"You probably think I'm disgusting and weak,\" he complains while covering his face completely mortified. Dahlia sits down next to him in silence before a soft smile forces its way to her face. Why was he so worried about what she thought of him? He was sick and he was worried what she thought? It confused her, but it was cute of him and she couldn't help but laugh lightly. \"What makes you think that?\" She asks while tugging on his arms to reveal his face again. He was red and she wasn't sure if it was because he was blushing or from all the heat. She decided it was because of the heat and exhaustion, as he finally removes his hands. She holds the cup of water out to him and he takes it, refusing to look up at her. \"You just saw me spewing chunks. You don't think that's disgusting?! No one else threw up.\" He grumbles frowning down at the cup of water resting in his lap. He always seemed to be the weakest of all the players and this frustrated him to no end, especially because his father expected him to be just the opposite. Dahlia frowns noticing he was intentionally avoiding eye contact much like Petey had done before. She rolls her eyes at this and bumps into his shoulder gently. \"I don't think you're weak, or disgusting,\" she tells him softly, when he continues to stare at his cup she continues, \"I'm impressed that you held out that long even though you weren't feeling well. Just because you threw up doesn't mean you're weak, you pulled through and that's all that matters.\" This got Alan to glance up at her causing her to shoot him a gentle smile. \"Really?\" He asks not completely convinced. She nods and pushes the cup his way telling him to take a sip. He complies and begins to sip the water slowly so that his stomach wouldn't reject it. \"Wait your turn!\" They both hear from the water table. They glance behind them to find the water table being flipped as another fight broke out. It looked like Ray had been the one to yell at Rev, and Dahlia finds herself shaking her head. She knew that guy was no good. Sheryl was yelling and throwing cups at them, which almost brought a smile to her face. Dahlia lets out another sigh as she begins to stand up to help break up the fight. \"Thanks for caring,\" Alan speaks up causing Dahlia to glance back at him. \"You know, taking care of me… No one else even bat an eyelash my way.\" He gives her a tired and slightly dejected look causing her to smile and mess his hair up a bit to cheer him up. It was sweaty, but she didn't mind since it was to be expected. This guy was growing on her. \"Don't worry about it. Just stay here and drink your water,\" she tells him before walking away. She stops after a couple of steps and decides to tell him one more thing. \"Oh! And Alan?\" She asks causing him to glance at her again while sipping on his water, realizing just how thirsty he actually was. \"You're pretty cute when you're embarrassed,\" she told him, shooting him a sweet smile. This causes him to choke slightly on his water, which makes her laugh before turning and continuing to walk away. After clearing his throat he stares at her as she walks away with a ghost of a smile on his face. Once the boys were excused Dahlia stays back for a bit to help clean up the mess from the fight before making her way back to the dorms. Most of the guys were gone, but there were a few of them left. She turns a corner, but stops when she spots Gerry and Julius bump into each other. Her eyes widen and she quickly goes back to hide around the corner and listen in to their conversation. \"All right, man, listen.\" Gerry says in a low voice after glancing around a bit, \"I'm Gerry, you're Julius. Let's get some particulars and just get this over with, all right?\" Dahlia smiles a bit but remains quiet to listen carefully. She hopes this wouldn't end in another fight, it was beginning to get a bit old. \"Particulars?\" Julius asks getting a nod from Gerry, \"No matter what I tell you, you ain't never gonna know nothing 'bout me.\" This only irritates Gerry as he begins to protest. \"Hey man listen, I ain't runnin' any more of these three-a-days, okay!?\" He flat lines. Dahlia smiles some after that statement. It seems this is what Boone had in mind. The boys would rather get to know each other, despite the race difference, than run anymore of those exhausting and tortuous workouts. \"Seriously, what I got to say, you really don't wanna hear 'cause honesty ain't too high on your people's priority list, right?\" Julius responds. This was an interesting statement. Dahlia didn't quite understand the saying, but frowns when Gerry grows even more frustrated with Julius' calm response. \"Honesty? You want honesty?\" Gerry's voice grows louder making it easier for Dahlia to hear what they were saying, \"All right, honestly, I think you're nothing,\" Dahlia clenches her jaw at the rude statement, but instantly calms when he continues, \"Nothing but a pure waste of God-given talent. You don't listen to nobody, man. Not even Doc or Boone! Shiver push on the line every time and you blow right past 'em! Push him, pull him, do something! You can't run over everybody in this league, and every time you do, you leave one of your teammates hanging out to dry. — me in particular!\" He shouts while smacking his own chest adding emphasis to his statement. Dahlia was pleasantly surprised with what Gerry said, he actually complimented Julius. Gerry was right, Julius was slacking and was one of the many players she caught letting someone through. \"Why should I give a hoot about you, huh?\" Julius challenges still remaining calm. Dahlia sighs and feels herself deflate a little. \"Or anyone else out there? You wanna talk about a waste, you the captain?\" \"Right.\" \"Captain's supposed to be the leader, right?\" \"Right.\" \"You got a job?\" \"I have a job.\" \"You been doing your job!\" Julius asks getting louder. \"I've been doing my job.\" Gerry confirms matching his volume. It was quiet for a bit and Dahlia could feel her nerves begin to get the best of her, as she fights the urge to pop her head out around the corner to see what was going on. \"Then why don't you tell your white buddies to block for Rev better? 'Cause they have not blocked for him worth a blood nickel, and you know it!\" He shouts, shutting Gerry up for a bit. Dahlia was stunned as well. \"Nobody plays! Yourself included. I'm supposed to wear myself out for the team? What team!? No. No, what I'm going to do is, I'm gonna watch out for myself, and I'm gon' get mine.\" Julius' words make Dahlia sad. He had a point. They weren't a team and this made Dahlia frown just a tad. Dahlia decidea that although it was wrong of Julius to play for just himself, he was in the right. \"See, man?\" Gerry speaks with a tone that hints that he's let down, \"That's the worst attitude I ever heard.\" \"Attitude reflects leadership, Captain.\" Julius speaks after a moment of silence. This shuts Gerry up real quick and Julius takes in his silence before walking away. Dahlia remains silent and childishly cheers for Julius' sick burn in her head. She hears a defeated sigh come from around the corner and finally peaks to see Gerry slide down to sit against the wall. Someone sitting beside him catches his attention and he glances over to see Dahlia staring back in at him in concern. They both remain silent thinking over what they both had heard. Gerry couldn't help but ponder back to Julius' last statement. \"He's right you know,\" Dahlia finally says gently. Gerry glares at her harshly, but sighs and nods. It didn't surprise him that she was listening in. \"I know. It's just… I don't know how to fix this,\" He admits in a defeated tone, leaning his head back on the cool wall. Dahlia pulls her knees up to her chest and laughs. \"What do you mean you don't know how to fix this. Of course you do.\" She spits out almost bitterly, surprising Gerry with her tone, \"You just don't want to.\" She finishes. \"And just what do you mean by that!\" He asks just as harshly while glaring at her. Dahlia was always standing up for them! She was supposed to be on his side. They had known each other first! \"Gerry… They're just like us. They aren't any different from you, Ray, or even Alan.\" She explains softly trying not to anger him anymore. The look he shot her told her he didn't buy that. \"They're people Gerry. They play on your team. Your team is your family. As a captain you lead your family to victory, but right now you're only taking half of them there. The other half you're leaving out in the cold.\" She tried. It seemed to catch Gerry's attention though as he lifted his head to stare at her with a confused look. \"You can't hate half of your team because you need them out there on that field. You disliking them for the color of their skin is only encouraging the rest of your boys to dislike them as well. You're crippling your own team, Gerry.\" She continues, causing Bertier to laugh sardonically at the situation he seems to have put himself in. \"It just isn't right, Dahlia. Our kind isn't suppose to like them,\" he sighs while bringing his knee up to lean on. Dahlia peers over to see the troubled look in his eyes and knew he was going through things. His whole life he had been taught to dislike colored people, and now he was being told to go against all of it. \"Look past the color of their skin, I know you're better than this,\" she tries to soothe his inner turmoil. \"How do you expect for me to do that?\" He asks. \"Just see them for what they are , see them as your teammates,\" she states firmly. Gerry thinks about it for a long time and Dahlia continues to sit next to him keeping him company. The sun was setting now and she knew it was beginning to get late. \"I think... I can do that,\" he finally states, scaring Dahlia slightly after such a long period of silence. She stares at him for a little bit, but smiles and tackles him in a hug, causing him to chuckle and hug the giddy girl back. \"Really?!\" She asks pulling away and gripping his shoulders. Gerry nods, but still holds a look of uncertainty. \"What?\" She asks catching his look. \"I don't know where to begin,\" he confesses sheepishly. Dahlia lets his shoulders go and begins to ponder that herself. \"Just… Start off by calling things out fairly tomorrow. Don't be picking on one race,\" she offers as he shakes his head at her suggestion. \"They won't think anything of it,\" he brushes off dejectedly. \"Trust me,\" Dahlia says while standing up, \"They'll notice… Especially Julius.\" She reaches out to help Gerry up. He sat there for a while more before smiling and accepting her help. \"If you say so, Doll.\" He drawls out still not completely convinced. \"I'm glad you're doing this, Gerry. It's the right thing to do,\" she admits to him before walking off to the dorms. Bertier remains standing there alone. He had doubts about this, but knew Julius and Dahlia were right in some way. At 3 am the next morning, a loud and obnoxious horn could be heard throughout the halls of the dorms. Waking not only the boys, but a very unhappy Dahlia who nearly rips her door off its hinges as she tries to locate who is blowing the dang horn. \"Well, good morning, Ms. Black.\" Greets Coach Boone as he sees her open the door. The harsh glare she sends him manages to bring him to chuckle a good amount. \"What are you doing?\" She sneers as she squints against the harsh artificial lighting in the hallway. \"Get ready! We're going running!\" He states before continuing to blow the horn in attempts to wake the rest of the guys up. \"Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!\" Dahlia begins to protest over the horn waving her hands to catch Boone's attention once again. \"I need to come? It ain't even light out yet!\" She points out flabbergasted. \"Well of course you do. You're a part of this team, right?\" He asks, causing her to swear in her head. She admits he was good at getting her to do things she really didn't want to do by using her own words against her. \"I thought you said I didn't need to work out with the boys anymore,\" She tries to argue. Coach Boone crosses his arms and stares down at the sleepy female, humming in thought. \"Let's cut a deal,\" He tells her as boys begin to finally make their way down the stairs quickly as the rest of the coaches urge them down. Dahlia continues to squint at him tiredly. \"If you can keep up with me on this run. You will no longer need to do mandatory workouts at camp,\" Dahlia widens her eyes a bit at the offer, suddenly just a tad more awake, but before she can respond Coach Boone cut her off, \"Only if you keep up with me. You understand?\" He reinforces. She smiles and nods shaking his hand. \"Now you have five minutes to be downstairs and ready to join us,\" He calls back as he turns to leave. Dahlia shouts in protest and quickly makes her way back in her room to at least brush her teeth. No way was she about to go see everyone with morning breath. When she finally makes her way outside she can see a bunch of guys who were shivering and barely awake themselves. She could relate to the feeling. She herself didn't have much time to get ready and because of that she had to run in what she slept in, which really wasn't much. A large white t-shirt, some sleeping shorts, and she just managed to pull on some shoes as she stumbled out of her and Sheryl's room. And Sheryl! That lucky butt, she got to stay and sleep in through all this! \"Nice of you to finally join us, Ms. Black.\" Coach Boone greets. Some of the more awake boys manage to glance back at her, and one even has the nerve to whistle at her as she pushes past them grumpily to stand near the front of the group. \"What is she doing!?\" Gerry questions staring at the attire Dahlia was wearing, \"does she not realize she is here with a bunch of guys?!\" He marvels as he rubs his temple, at the girl he considered his sister and was growing protective of. Ray merely chuckles and elbows Alan as he quickly adverts his eyes and blushes heavily. \"She probably didn't have time to get ready,\" Alan defends. He really did think what she was wearing was revealing, it's not that he minded though, he just didn't like how some of the others were looking at her. Ray in particular. Gerry seems to think about his statement before agreeing with him. They barely had time to get ready themselves. Once Dahlia made it to the front of the group she looks over and greets Rev, Petey, and Blue. Petey stares and lets a low whistle out as they continue to wait for the rest of the guys to arrive. \"Dang girl!\" Petey says, \"you be getting everyone hot and flustered with what you got wearing!\" He tells her laughing a bit when she half-heartedly tries to cover herself up with her hands. \"Man, don't look at her like that!\" Blue scolds Petey as he pushes his head away. Rev stares a bit before taking off the hoodie he had on and offering it to her. Seeing his gesture, Dahlia blushes a tad, she really wasn't used to guys doing things like this for her. \"You don't have to do that for me,\" Dahlia declines politely, \"plus, won't you get cold?\" She asks him gesturing to the thin white shirt he had on under the hoodie. \"I'll be alright. Don't need the guys looking at you like that,\" he gestures to Petey for example. \"Just take it, I insist,\" he urges. Dahlia smiles and takes the article of clothing to put on. It was larger on her, but that only made it better since it covered more of her legs than the shorts she was wearing. \"Thanks ,Rev. You're quite the gentleman,\" She tells him graciously with a smile that warms his heart. \"You don't mind if I keep this for awhile though, right?\" She asks as she tugs it down a bit more. The funny look she gets from him causes her to chuckle. \"I'll need to wash it after this. I'm going to get it all sweaty,\" She explains. Rev stares at her for a bit and realizes that she was naturally quite beautiful. She has on a large hoodie, her hair thrown up, and her eyes still a bit puffy from waking up, yet she can still get the guys to whistle and stare. She was really something. \"Don't worry about it, Dahlia. You can keep it, it looks good on you,\" he tells her smiling softly. Dahlia was silent for a bit before nodding happily, she didn't know how to respond to this type of treatment. He was so polite. \"All right, listen up!\" Coach Boone calls out, catching the attention of everyone around him. \"You will follow Doc, myself, and the other coaches, we're gonna to take a little run through the woods.\" A chorus of upset 'whats!' could be heard, but Boone continues on. \"If you get lost along the way, don't bother coming back to camp. Just hitchhike your hind parts on home. Any questions?\" He asks leaving the boys to accept his statement. \"You sure you up for this, Baby Doll?\" Petey asks Dahlia as she turns to him with a dead stare. \"Ms. Black! Let's go!\" She hears Coach Boone call out to her while gesturing her to move forward, and stand beside him. She smiles back at Petey before joining Coach Boone in jogging, \"Just try to keep up, Petey!\" The run was exhausting and seemed to drag on for an eternity. Dahlia kept up with Coach Boone like she said she would, but would lag a bit every once in awhile when she'd trip over a root or branch. The scenery was the only thing that kept her from collapsing and just all together quittin'… Well, that and the fact that Boone would call out to her tauntingly every once in awhile to ask if she was okay. Other times, Gerry or one of the other guys would catch up to her and pick on her jokingly causing her to push them away. One of those time, Gerry even slipped and fell, which caused her to laugh so hard she almost joined him. When they finally came to a rest, Dahlia could barely remain standing. So, she plopped down on the floor and leaned back to try and catch her breath. She felt gross from all the sweat that had soaked the back of the hoodie, and was thankful that Rev was letting her keep it. She wouldn't want to give it back to him even after she washed it with the amount she had sweat in it. Looking at the others she saw that they were just as sweaty and filthy too. Had some of the others fallen like Gerry had as well? \"Anybody know what this place is?\" Coach asks, breathing heavily. The guys and Dahlia glance up to see that they were in what seemed to be a foggy graveyard. \"This is Gettysburg. This is where they fought the battle of Gettysburg.\" Silence seems to rest on everyone's shoulder as they let where they were sink in. \"Fifty thousand men died right here on this field, fightin' the same fight that we still fightin' amongst ourselves today. This green field right here was painted red. Bubbling with the blood of young boys. Smoke… and hot lead pouring right through their bodies.\" He spels piercing the hearts of anyone who could hear his words. Dahlia glances around at the others as they listen in to Coach's speech. \"Listen to their souls, men. 'I kill my brother with malice in my heart.' 'Hatred destroyed my family.'\" He states while turning to stare at his team. \"You listen. You take a lesson from the dead. If we don't come together, right now, on this hallowed ground, then we, too, will be destroyed. Just like they were.\" Boone claims while looking out to the graveyard lit by the tiniest bit of sunshine as the morning came to. \"I don't care if you like each other or not, but you will respect each other, and maybe… I don't know, learn to play like men.\" He declares. Dahlia was thoroughly impressed by the speech and only hopes that it affects the boys like it did her. Glancing around she spots Gerry and sees that he was thinking, and hard. When he catches her stare, he seems to grow even more troubled before nodding, seemingly answering her unspoken question. This brings enough glee to Dahlia's heart that she could almost run the whole way back… If she could feel her legs that is. Practice ran into the night, and Dahlia was told earlier by Boone that since she kept her part of the bargain while running she no longer needed to workout. She had proven that she was fast enough for Boone's liking and could keep up with the boys as they ran their plays to catch better photos. When it grew dark and the field had to be lit by headlights, Dahlia places her camera away and continues to watch the guys play the same as they were previously were. Gerry hadn't called anyone out yet and Dahlia was beginning to think he had lied to her when he told her he'd do it. A whistle was blown as Coach Boone slams a football down on the ground. \"All right. We'll be out here all night, until we get this thing right. Let's go!\" He barks out before exiting the field and calling out, \"On the ball, Rev.\" Dahlia stands up from her place and crosses her arms in anticipation. \"Ready! Set!\" Rev calls out as all the guys seem to be on edge, \"Hut!\" He shouts causing the guys to go into play. Dahlia mentally went over where she would have been to catch shots of each person, but cringes when Julius passes Ray and tackles Petey, tossing him to the ground. Dahlia huffs and glares at Ray knowing he let Julius pass him without a care. \"Coach!\" She calls out catching his stare, \"You saw that didn't you!\" She asks him incredulously. Why wasn't he doing anything! She knew he could see them. Coach Boone stares at her for a bit, but before he can respond shouting could be heard from the field. \"What was that, Ray?\" This catches Dahlia's attention and she instantly forgets her irritation as she realizes the voice belongs to Gerry. \"Whatever it is, it ain't blockin'!\" This seems to get the other players' attention as well while Dahlia begins to smile, was he really doing it? \"Give me a break, Gerry.\" Ray spits out glaring slightly. \"You want a break? I'll give you a break!\" Gerry shouts as he slams into Ray only to be pushed back. \"Me and Julius -\" He began to say, but Dahlia's attention was caught by Coach Yoast telling Tyrell to \"Wait a minute. Let them handle this.\" \"If we get to Rev once, just one time, I swear to God, I'm going to hit you so hard, by the time you come to, ooh boy, you're gonna need a new haircut.\" He shouts as Ray continues to stare at him in confusion and irritation. Dahlia smiles as she glances over at Julius who was staring as well. \"You understand me!\" He asks as he slams his helmet into Ray's once again. Ray pushes him away, glaring quite harshly. Gerry lets out a strange laugh before walking away and calling out, \"Let's play fellas!\" Dahlia's smile widens as she cheers mentally as to not look insane. Looking to Gerry, she catches him glance over at her and wink before going back into position. Coach Boone blows his whistle and stares back at Dahlia with a smile. She rolls her eyes when she realizes it was an response to her previous outburst. It seems Boone knew that Gerry was going to say something, this guy always seems to know what was going to happen. \"Ready!\" Rev called again, \"Set! Hut!\" He shouts as everyone once again went into action. Dahlia watches Ray closely to see if he does what he was told. She was surprised that he seemed to at least give a half-hearted attempt before Julius got past him and once again tackles Petey. The whistle shrieks and Petey stands up quickly. \"Get off me!\" He shouts shrugging Julius' help away. \"You all right, big Petey! You all right?\" Julius jokes while slapping him on the back good heartedly. \"You really stuck him Campbell!\" Gerry says approvingly as he stands beside Julius. \"Yeah, I love me a little contact, Petey!\" He calls out still happily. Dahlia smiles as things between the two seem to be okay. Suddenly Gerry gave Julius a good shove and shouts, \"Left side!\" Julius stumbles a bit before staring at Gerry quietly. Dahlia feels herself grow nervous, but continues to watch on (as did the Coaches). Gerry stares back while smiling and nodding encouragingly. \"Strong side!\" Julius shouts while shoving him back. They continue to do this and Dahlia smiles as she looks around at the others who stand by and watch with similar reactions. Their shouts got louder as they grab each other by the shoulders and slam their helmets against each other. Dahlia breaths out a sigh of content and nods in satisfaction. It seems Gerry did stick to his word after all. Things would begin to look up from here on out. Alrighty! Hope that was alright! I apologize once again for the long wait, things are getting a bit crazy. Anyways the votes between Rev and Alan are tied at the moment. (without my own vote that is) I'm contemplating if I should hold out on the romance and wait until the end, that way I could give two separate endings. One would be with Rev, and one would be with Alan. What do you guys think? Fav/Follow/Review![Chapter 7] Hey Guys! So I need all of YOUR help! Please!

They'll be at the end of this story! Enjoy! Disclaimer: I don't own any of this! A Black and White Film: A Titan's Documentary Chapter Seven: I've Got Sunshine On A Cloudy Day The following morning came and Dahlia wakes from her slumber, she smiles to herself as she realizes that the previous night had not been a dream. Not only did Gerry actually keep his promise, it seems that Julius and the other team members seemed to finally be getting along just fine. The next best thing was that she no longer needed to run workouts with Sheryl. She swore that girl could have dang well been Coach Boone's protege with the amount of pleasure she had while ordering her around. She clumsily hops out of her room while trying to tug on her left shoe and was surprised to hear someone chuckling when she almost loses her balance. She quickly glances up in slight alarm to find someone leaning out in the hall, they seem to be waiting for her. Julius couldn't help but laugh at the girl who was tripping over herself as she tried to rush and get to the field. She has on her oversized Jersey, as well as a black pair of fitted long pants to go along with it. Her hair is tied on the top of her head in a bun, but strands were falling loose as she hops around to keep her balance. \"Mornin' Julius,\" she greets cheerfully as she stands up and brushes her fringe out of her eyes. She was curious as to why he was waiting for her. \"Hey,\" He greets back, pushing himself off of the wall to come closer to her. \"Were you the one to talk to Bertier?\" He asks casually as he stares at the tiny girl in front of him. He never really noticed how small she was until he stood right next to her. \"What?\" She asks a little surprised and taken back. \"Are you the one who talked some sense into him?\" Julius patiently asks again. If it weren't for the smile on his face she would have thought he was angry with her. That smile though, it was almost as if he already knew the answer. Dahlia instantly knows what he's talking about and can't help the huge grin that grows on her face. \"He would have figured it out eventually,\" she confesses before laughing. Julius chuckles as well before reaching out and pulling the lovable girl in for a hug. This shocks Dahlia for an instant, but she quickly hugs him back as well. She was never one to deny a good hug. \"Well, either way,\" he says as they pull away from each other, \"Thanks for treating us no differently than any other person on the team. I just want you to know that if you ever need anything, I've got your back,\" he says before patting her messy bun and walking out towards the field. \"You're family now!\" He calls back at her. Dahlia stands there stunned and a bit slack-jawed. She never thought Julius would be this friendly, but she has to admit she likes this side of him. Plus, she was now honorary family, she happily thinks as she smiles merrily to herself. \"Wait up!\" She calls out to a laughing figure that she could now consider not only a friend, but a brother as well. The dark haired beauty smiles to herself as she watches, what appears to be a completely new team, practice. Both races were getting along great. She can hear everyone shouting at each other, but unlike before it was to get each other pumped rather than fighting words, and Sheryl seems to be getting more pumped by the minute. \"I'm glad they're getting along. Maybe now they'll play better, right Black?\" Sheryl asks turning to stare at her. Dahlia looks down and smiles before nodding. \"It's about time too! I'm tired of wasting precious film on them!\" She tells Sheryl, as she dramatically places her wrist to her forehead in despair. They were both silent for a bit before they both break out in laughter at Dahlia's display. \"Hey… Who's that?\" Sheryl asks glancing behind Dahlia. Curious, Dahlia turns around and catches sight of a beautiful red car driving their way. She shrugs to herself, as she tries to figure out who on Earth could be in the car. She glances towards the boys and find that even they caught sight of the beauty. Gerry especially. She and Sheryl watch as two men step out of the car, one of them had gorgeous long golden hair. She couldn't see much other than that. Sheryl began to laugh slightly. \"His hair is almost as long as yours!\" Sheryl points out while slapping her knee and laughing. Dahlia glances at her with a slightly offended look. \"His hair is prettier than mines too!\" She mumbles all too seriously, which causes Sheryl to grip her sides as she begins to laugh even harder. Dahlia cracks a smile as well trying to keep her laughing to a minimum, it wasn't polite to laugh at others. She has to admit his hair was nice, and it didn't make him look bad either, it just didn't quite seem to fit him. \"I wonder if he's here for camp?\" She wonders out loud causing Sheryl to try and calm herself down. \"Not with that hair he ain't,\" She states. Dahlia turns to give her a hard stare, but Sheryl is quick to defend herself, \"No! No offense to him! I mean, the coaches will tell him to cut it in order to play. I don't think hair is allowed that long in football,\" Sheryl tries to explain. Dahlia stares for a moment but accepts her explanation. \"Hey Fellas!\" She hears Gerry call out. Turning her attention his way she frowns at the daunting smirk he has on his face. \"Look at that fruitcake!\" He laughs. This got a bunch of the guys to chuckle as one of them even whistles much like they often did towards Dahlia. She finds herself struggling as she too fought back a chuckle and rolls her eyes at the insult. Gerry just had to say something, didn't he. \"Gerry, just keep your mouth shut and get back on that field,\" Coach Yoast yells out as he and Boone move to greet the newcomer. Dahlia finally lets her smile show as she begins to collect the footballs that were spread out amongst the field. Sheryl told her that it'd be a bunch of help if she'd gather them up. As she finally brings the last football to her pile she was surprised to find the new guy standing there. She stares at him and smiles when he looks up to meet her gaze. He seems surprised to see her, which she could understand considering she was the only girl, besides Sheryl, that was at an all boys camp. In reality the new guy was stunned for a much different reason that had to do with the fact that the girl in front of him, was lovely. \"Hi,\" She greets as she nervously grips the football she was holding. He stares at her for a bit before returning a smile of his own. He didn't expect to see a girl here, especially one who looked like this. She was beautiful with her bright smile and single dimple. Usually, girls like this didn't want to be anywhere near a sport that could ruin their face, especially such a rough sport like football. He couldn't help but wonder which of the lucky players had her on their arm. \"Hi,\" He greets, while reaching out a hand for her to shake. She smiles wider and returns the greeting. She can see him glancing over to the group of players with a calculating stare. She turns her head and spots Gerry amongst the group. She smiles impishly as she thinks of something. She just wonders if this new guy would get the hint. \"You any good at throwing?\" She asks catching the new guy's attention once again. He seems to chuckle and shrugs before replying with a simple, \"I'm decent.\" Satisfied with that she hands the ball she held to him and smiles when he just gives her a questioning look. \"The one who called you a fruitcake, that's Gerry. He's the team captain. You mind giving him the ball? They need one to start practicing again,and I'm too tired to run over there,\" she informs him with an implying smile. He seems to get it and grins back before nodding his head. \"No problem,\" He answers giving her a slight smirk. \"Thanks!\" She says gratefully before turning around to head back to Sheryl. \"Oh! And don't let him get away with calling you that,\" she warns him while turning back to see him aiming. \"Don't worry, I won't,\" he says as he finds his target and throws the ball. Dahlia stops for a bit watching as the ball travels an impressive mile's distance to hit the back of Gerry's head. He and the guys turn around and stare at the two figures of a laughing Dahlia, and satisfied fruitcake . Seeing Gerry's angry stare, Dahlia quickly shakes her head and jabs a finger at the new guy before backing away, laughing all the way. \"Yeah, a fruitcake, huh?\" Julius says laughing. Dahlia smiles at this and shakes her head as Sheryl begins to gush over how awesome that pitch was and how they needed him on the team, now! \"Black!\" She hears Coach Boone call. She flinches slightly thinking she was going to get chewed out, but when she glances up she could only see the group of adults smiling at her. As she reaches them she can see the new guy was with them, and he didn't seem too thrilled. \"Hello,\" She greets the stranger politely. He seems to be a man of authority, much like Coach Boone was. She could also tell that he and the new guy were not from around here. \"This is the team's personal photographer, Dahlia Black.\" Coach Boone introduces, causing Dahlia to wave slightly. \"Dahlia, this is Colonel Bass and his son, Ronnie.\" Coach Yoast adds in causing the two to nod in response. Colonel Bass seems to stare at Dahlia for a bit. \"Black?\" He spoke up causing Dahlia to nod in response. \"Well, now would your father happen to be Daniel Black?\" Dahlia seems to tilt her head in wonder. Not many people call her daddy by his real name, especially since he insisted people call him Danny. Much like she preferred Doll, rather than Dahlia. \"Yessir. How'd you know that?\" She asks mildly concerned. \"You look just like him. I was one of your Daddy's customers back in California,\" he explains causing Dahlia to smile widely, \"See you've even inherited his signature dimple.\" Colonel Bass points out while chuckling. Ronnie smiles as well. \"Well, I'm sure Pops will be happy to know that one of his customers are returning! I should have been able to tell that was my Dad's work,\" Dahlia exclaims while motioning to their beautiful red vehicle. Colonel Bass nods before going back to a business-like state. \"So, do we have a deal?\" He asks the coaches catching Ronnie's and Dahlia's attention. The coaches glance at each other as they replay the impressive throw made by the blonde Californian. \"I think we can find a place for your boy,\" Coach Yoast ponders while Coach Boone agrees, \"with one or two conditions,\" Ronnie and Colonel Bass nod in agreement as Dahlia stands there completely lost. She was beginning to wonder why she was here. \"What would that be?\" Colonel Bass asks as Dahlia notices Ronnie becoming visually nervous. She couldn't understand why they'd even think of turning this boy away. He had a hell of an arm on him! \"Ms. Black? How good are you with a pair of scissors?\" Coach Boone asks as all eyes move to her frozen figure. She stands there confused for awhile until she remembers what Sheryl told her when Ronnie had first arrived. She chuckles nervously as she scratches her neck lightly, she understood now why Ronnie was so nervous. He must have known this would happen. \"I'm good enough, I suppose,\" she replies, receiving three bright smiles and one not so happy sigh. \"So, are you trying out for Quarterback?\" She asks awkwardly as she tries to cut Ronnie's hair. The task proving itself to be more difficult than she originally thought it'd be. The poor guy is so tense that his shoulders were locked, which proved to be challenging with cutting away the length of his golden locks. He simply nods, which causes Dahlia to huff at the lack of a response. \"Would you calm down? I ain't going to cut you if that's what you're stressing about,\" she huffs, giving up and instead trying to soothe Ronnie so he'd relax his shoulders. He takes a deep breath and relaxes before meeting Dahlia's eyes in the mirror. They were sitting in the locker room as the boys were still out practicing. This was the first time Dahlia got to see inside of this particular building, and she wasn't impressed to be completely honest. \"It's not that I'm scared you're going to cut me, it's just…\" He lets his sentence fall as he sighs. Dahlia gives him an understanding smile before patting him on the shoulder. \"Don't worry. It'll grow back if your hair means that much to you,\" she tries to cheer him up as she begins to cut off his locks a little at a time, so as to not freak him out. \"Plus I think you'll look nice with the new hairdo,\" she compliments causing Ronnie to smile. \"You think so?\" He asks not so convinced. She smiles brightly and nods while still cutting. \"Yeah! You've got a nice face and build. The girls at school will be all over you,\" she responds casually. Ronnie smiles a little more genuinely. He was beginning to like this Dahlia girl. She spoke so casually, almost as if she knew him her entire life and this comforted him greatly. Having moved from California all these new faces and attitudes were making him feel uneasy. \"Even you?\" He asks causing Dahlia to shoot a warning look his way before smiling slightly. She could tell it was a joke, and laughs as she ponders whether he would be just as flirty as Petey was. Heck, he and Petey would probably get along. \"Don't flatter yourself. Dating isn't a concern of mines,\" She replies truthfully as she finally cuts most of the length away. \"Oh, so who's the lucky guy?\" He asks trying to get to know the only female on the team a little more. She seems like the type he'd like to have as a friend. She stops snipping away at his hair to give him a funny look in the mirror. \"Why does everyone assume that I belong to someone? I'm single. Dating just isn't my main priority, you know?\" She replies indifferently. Ronnie smiles at the girl and shakes his head at her response, which gets him a slight glare from the girl trying to cut his hair nicely. \"You're beautiful. That's why people assume you're taken. How do you not know this?\" He says bluntly causing Dahlia to flush. You would think with her slightly blunt nature she'd be used to other people's blunt responses. How wrong that thought was. \"You're good looking as well, but you're single!\" She accuses, but this merely causes Ronnie to chuckle. \"True, but I know I'm good looking,\" He tells her boastfully only to receive a slap to the back of his head as the two of them laugh. \"So, you came from California?\" She asks changing the subject as she recalls his father saying something about knowing her own. \"Yeah, we just moved here from Huntington Beach.\" He responds watching as Dahlia continues to concentrate with styling his hair. At the mention of his hometown her eyes brighten. \"Oh! I'm from Los Angeles! We were practically neighbors,\" She responds cheerfully. Ronnie smiles as well as he realizes that was why she seems so familiar. She was from the same area, which is also why her attitude was so much more familiar as well. He noticed that people here weren't quite as friendly. She was like a bright ray of sunshine in this drab, black and white town. \"So, I think I have a plan to get... Gerry?\" He seems hesitant at the name, but Dahlia nods in confirmation and he continues, \"To get Gerry back.\" This catches Dahlia's attention as she halts her styling to stare at him in interest. He motions for her to come closer to him so he could whisper it to her, and when she bends down closer, he quickly pulls her in to kiss her on the cheek. She gasps softly, pulling away, but Ronnie only continues to grin at her. \"What?\" She asks in shock. It's not that it bothered her, the peck had just caught her by surprise. She didn't understand what that had to do with Gerry. \"YOU'RE GOING TO KISS HIM!?\" She suddenly shouts while laughing as Ronnie lifts his brows up and down. \"So, you think that'll get to him?\" He asks her as she finally calms down enough to continue on his hair, which as of now looks pretty nice. \"He'll be pissed,\" she responds, a smile still haunting her face. \"Don't worry, I'll be able to handle what he throws at me,\" He responds calmly. \"I hope that includes fists as well,\" she warns causing Ronnie to chuckle and nod in confirmation. It only took a few more moments until she finally places the scissors down and smiles proudly at Ronnie through the mirror. \"Do you like it?\" She asks excitedly as she bounces slightly in anticipation. Ronnie seems to stare at his reflection and reaches up to touch his now short hair. \"It's going to take me awhile to get used to it being like this, but yes, I like it.\" He answers causing Dahlia to brighten even more, \"Thanks!\" He responds gratefully turning around to stare at her actual figure rather than her reflection. \"Doll! Get out! No girls allowed!\" She hears the loud voice of Petey shout while banging on some lockers. This was a sign that the guys were done practicing and if Dahlia wanted to keep her eyes from falling out, she needed to get out now. She quickly hugs Ronnie before wishing him good luck with his little mission and quickly booking it out of there. Ronnie smiles and turns to continue touching his hair. He really didn't mind the new style, he just missed his old hair. It took him forever to grow that out! \"Hey, Sunshine.\" He hears someone call out from behind him. \"Sunshiiinnnee...\" They call out again causing him to glance up to see a colored boy in the mirror. Sunshine. Seems like he got himself a nickname already. He shrugs inwardly and decides that it was a heck of a lot better than, Fruitcake . Heck, he liked it better than, Ronnie. I hope you liked the chapter! Sorry it may seem a bit short, but I can start updating faster when I have a plan for the pairing in this story. Here are the choices: (1) Pick one love interest and write the story out as it would be. The winner is Alan when it comes down to votes that I've received. (2) Hold off on any major romance until the end, and have two different endings. One where Dahlia ends up with Rev, and the other with Alan. (3) Split the story in two. One version is with Alan, and the other with Rev. Choose! If not, I'm afraid I'll have to choose and let people down! Fav/Follow/Review![Chapter 8] Hello Readers!

A Black and White Film: A Titan's Documentary Chapter Eight: California Dreamin' Spirits were high in the locker room as the guys joke around, change, and shower. The day's practice was hard as usual, but it went by much smoother without all the fighting and segregation within the team. Laughing and prolonged 'oohs' could be heard as a bunch of jokes were being tossed between players. After a certain joke about Julius' mom's nasty back hair a lighthearted fight broke out between him and Blue who had made the joke. \"You mad cause she lookin' like a wolfman, bruh.\" Blue jokes as Julius is pulled away by a laughing Bertier. The playful banter catches the attention of the others as they look up from their business to watch. Alan who's sitting next to Ray, untying his shoes begins to laugh, but notices Ray just scoffs at the display. \"What?\" He voices catching Ray's attention. He didn't really understand why Ray was so nasty towards some of the other players on the team. Yeah, they were black, but that didn't mean they weren't good players or people. Heck! He had to admit that most of the new guys, like Petey and Blue, were hilarious! \"What do you mean, what? Look at them!\" Ray says spitefully as he turns to stare at Alan as if he were blind. Alan turns to look back at the group who were all laughing and playing around. He didn't see anything wrong with the scene, in fact he kind of wanted to join them. \"I don't see it,\" he responds unenthusiastically, not able to see Ray's point. \"It just isn't right. They're disgusting,\" Ray continues going back to untying his shoes. Alan stares at him expressionless, shaking his head at Ray's cruel nature. They were long time friends, but he was beginning to grow tired of Ray's attitude. He couldn't even begin to understand why his father would ever want him to be like Ray, Gerry he could understand, but not Ray. Brushing it off he glances back towards the joking group of guys to see Louie was getting in on the fun as he gets Petey with a \"yo' mama\" joke. It remains quiet between Ray and Alan until music could be heard playing throughout the locker room. Blue begins to sing along, and Louie joins to form a pitchy, but joyful duet. Alan feels a smile fighting it's way on his face as he watches the two sing together. The song was familiar to him and it takes him only seconds to recognize the song as the one Blue had been singing on the bus. The same song that he and Dahlia were able to dance too until Julius had rudely interrupted. At the memory he begins to jokingly dance around in hopes of getting Ray to lighten up even if it was just a bit. A sharp elbow to the side gets Alan to freeze before he begins to dance closer to Ray, which earns himself a hard shove, but a sliver of a grin from Ray. This causes him to stop his dancing and laugh good-naturedly at his small accomplishment. It seems it took a lot to make Ray smile nowadays. \"How can you even dance to this?\" Ray asks with an genuinely curious look on his face. \"Well, it's easy,\" Alan answers with a soft grin, \"I just wiggle a little and let the music do the rest.\" He responds wiggling comically. This doesn't seem to sit well with Ray, as he shakes his head. \"It's like you're one of them,\" Ray practically spits out while turning away to continue changing. \"What would your father say about that?\" He snips which instantly brings Alan down a notch or two. What would his father think of all this? Commotion suddenly catches their attention and they both stand to see the new guy kissing an enraged Gerry. Alan couldn't decide if he wanted to laugh, cringe, or perhaps a combination of the two at the situation. Once he catches a glimpse of Ray's face however, he lets out a long string of laughter. \" Ohs \" were chorused throughout the locker rooms once again as the two begin to fight. Gerry was the throwing punches left and right, but the new guy just kept dodging the hits. Alan had to admit, as well as most of the guys there, that Sunshine was pretty quick on his feet. Gerry only seemed to get angrier as Sunshine maintains a condescending grin on his face, never throwing a hit back. \"Whoa! Bertier!\" Julius calls out as he exited from the shower room to quickly pull Gerry away from their new teammate. It takes about five guys to finally hold him back. \"Bertier! Calm down!\" Julius shouts trying to keep Gerry in place. \"Doll would flip if she saw you doing this!\" Julius speaks again recalling the fight between himself and Gerry beforehand. Thinking back on it now, he was impressed on how quickly Dahlia could put a halt to Gerry's rampage. At the mention of Dahlia, Gerry drifts off for a bit before calming completely down and staring at the new guy. \"You have no idea who you messed with, man!\" Bertier shouts still constrained by a couple of guys. Alan who now recovered from his laughing attack grew bored of the fight and was thinking back to what Ray previously said to him. It bothered him for the most part… Maybe he did belong with them though. Glancing back at Ray who still wore a scowl, he comes to the conclusion that being with Blue, Rev, and Petey would probably be a lot more fun. Even if his dad didn't approve of it. He shrugs it off concluding that it wouldn't be the first time he let his dad down. \"There's too much male bonding going on in here for me. I'm out,\" One of the colored teammates announce as he begins to walk out of the locker room. Alan was caught off guard as the guy quickly punches his chest while passing, \"Ya dig?\" He asks shooting a wink his way before exiting. Alan quickly catches his footing and grabs at his chest a bit, slightly put off. After a bit more thought on his situation, a smile grows on his face as he came to a decision. \"What is going on here?\" Julius asks once more as Gerry calms down enough to be released. They look at each other in silence, as Gerry tries to figure out how to word what exactly did just happen. He seems to be growing a tad bit red as well, but finally swallows some pride and gestures towards Sunshine. \"He- He kissed me, man!\" He answers still slightly flustered by the whole event. It was silent and Julius simply stands there and blinks trying to comprehend what he just heard. Laughing then begins to take over the rest of the room as Julius just shakes his head and stares at Sunshine at a complete loss for words. Sunshine smiles and walks off as some of the guys quickly got out of his way. \"I change my mind. Maybe Dahlia should have been here to sort this out,\" Julius finally speaks not knowing how to respond to this. Once that was over and done with Alan smiles and decides it was time to get everyone back into the mood. So, he mentally cheers himself on and steps up to Louie and Blue and begins to sing along with the song that was still playing. It took a bit of his dancing before the other guys smile and join him, silently accepting his offered hand in friendship. Had Dahlia seen this happen, she would have been euphoric. Ray however, who did see the whole thing go down, only shook his head feeling slightly betrayed. The next day came and Dahlia was once again out on the field with her camera around her neck. This time however, she was dressed identical to the rest of the coaches with her red Titan's polo-styled shirt and black fitted pants that went to just below her knees. \"You look good in red,\" Sheryl points out as they wait for the guys to pick practice back up. Dahlia smiles at the small girl and thanks her graciously. \"Sheryl's right. I do believe you seem fit in Titan colors,\" Coach Yoast compliments as well causing Dahlia to smile his way too. She likes how kind Coach Yoast always was. She has yet to see the soft hearted man angry just yet and was impressed to say the least. The two coaches made a nice duo for the team, having the ability to even each other out. One was hard and ruled with an iron fist, while the other was soft and ruled with a nurturing nature. \"Well, I sure hope so, because I'm going to be wearing a lot more of it.\" She proudly states looking back out at the boys on the field. \"Ronnie Bass!\" She hears Coach Boone shout out. She watches as said boy comes running his way. She never got to speak to him yesterday about how things went down in the locker room, but judging by how Gerry didn't seem to be picking on him anymore, she decides it was safe to say that things must have went well. \"I like that hair cut,\" he compliments, but not without shooting a smile Dahlia's way. She smiles back and gave Coach Boone a thumbs up before he went back to business. \"Get in there and show me what you got. Option left,\" he calls out causing Ronnie to nod and get into place. Dahlia picks up her camera in anticipation and could feel herself getting excited at how this was going to go. \"This outta' be good,\" Sheryl says to her as she brings up her camera and nods. Dahlia can't help but agree, with the potential he displayed yesterday there was no doubt he'd play terrifically. \"Set! Hut!\" Ronnie commands as everyone shot off into their plays. Everything seemed to be going well until Ronnie went to pass the ball, and missed his target by a mile. Dahlia quickly drops her camera and laughs at Ronnie's expense. \"What on Earth was that!\" Sheryl calls out making a scene like she usually did when something upset her. Her reaction only causes Dahlia to laugh even more. She could see that even Coach Boone was a little thrown off by this play as well. \"Decent thrower, huh? Guess Wonder Boy wasn't as good as he said,\" Dahlia ponders to herself as she chuckles recalling just how confident he made himself out to be yesterday. Coach Yoast glances from his fuming daughter to Dahlia and simply shakes his head at the two. \"Hard step,\" Coach Boone starts off, but seems to pause while doing some hand gestures to try and further explain the play to Ronnie. \"Read the tackle. Got to see the pitch, all right?\" \"Yessir,\" Ronnie responds softly. \"Now, you can throw it a mile, but you can't pitch it three yards,\" Boone states as Dahlia begins to make her way over to the two. She could see Ronnie growing more tense and nervous as Boone continues to drill him. Once Dahlia stood beside Coach Boone, she decides to put in her two-cents. \"May I make a suggestion?\" She asks politely catching the attention of the two of them. Ronnie seems to relax slightly just at the sight of her and smiles while Coach Boone stares at her in thought. He decides that Dahlia seemed like the type to trust and she has never given him a reason not to. \"Well go on, let's hear it.\" He decides motioning for Dahlia who smiles at the privilege to continue voicing her thoughts. \"Well, why don't you ask Rev to help him?\" She offers glancing back to Rev who was standing at the sides. \"I'm sure he wouldn't mind helping Ronnie out.\" She concludes attempting to comfort the nervous new player. Coach thinks about this for a split second before smiling and clapping a hand over her shoulder with a grin. \"Rev!\" He calls out receiving a \"yes, sir?\" from said person who runs up to stand next to Dahlia. He smiles at her and bumps her slightly receiving a friendly hip bump from her in return. \"Show him how,\" Coach states before walking away as Rev gave an affirmative, \"Yessir!\" once again. Ronnie and Rev stare at each other for a bit in silence before Dahlia breaks the awkward tension. \"Ronnie, this is Rev. He's one of the kindest guys I know on the team. He'll take good care of you,\" She tells Ronnie as she throws her arm around Rev good-naturedly. Rev chuckles at the little introduction and smiles as Dahlia goes to do the same to Ronnie. \"Rev, this is Ronnie. He's a little full of himself, but don't let that fool you.\" She jokes as Ronnie shoots her a slight glare. \"He's new here and nervous, so I trust you can make him feel warm and welcomed. He's friendly and will get along with you all better than Gerry them did at first.\" She hints to Rev before walking away to follow Coach Boone. \"Is she always like that?\" Ronnie asks as he smiles lightly at Rev, who returns it and simply nods. \"That's the Titan's Doll right there.\" He confirms before motioning for Ronnie to follow him. \"Let's get that play down.\" Ronnie nods and follows. Rev decides that despite what happened in the locker room between the new guy and Bertier, if what Dahlia said was true, he'd be happy to help him out. Meanwhile, Dahlia caught up with Coach Boone who side eyed her before patting her on the head. He had seen what she'd done to help the two get along and appreciated it greatly. He could tell that this little photographer was helping the team in a lot more ways than he anticipated and was glad that she was along for the ride. Dinner made its way around the corner quickly and Dahlia was excited once she grabbed her plate spotting the small bowl of pudding on it. She looked up to decide where to sit, but was pulled along by no one other than Ronnie Bass. She had a strange feeling that they'd only become closer as time went by, and it probably had something to do with the fact that he hung with her whenever he had the chance. \"I suppose this means I'm joining you for dinner?\" Dahlia asks with a sarcastic smile which was answered by a sweet smile in return. \"Who wouldn't want such beautiful company?\" He asks causing Dahlia to feel slightly flattered, \"I meant me.\" Ronnie finishes causing Dahlia to laugh and push him away as he broke out laughing himself. He'd never admit it to her, but he really did think anyone who would have her on their arm would be incredibly lucky. \"You know you'd have sat next to me anyways,\" Ronnie gloats as they sit down across from Rev. Dahlia was pleasantly surprised with this and smiles at Rev cheerfully. She was glad that Rev and Ronnie seemed to be getting along. \"Of course, because you just know me so well.\" Dahlia drawls out while pointing a spoon Ronnie's way. Rev glances between the two as Ronnie swats the spoon out of his face. Dahlia and Bass may have only met, but Rev knew they often joked and argued like siblings. \"Well, we're both from California, we're practically related,\" Ronnie jokes. Dahlia tries to keep a straight face at that statement, but Ronnie's constant elbowing got her to give in and smile at the lovable creature. \"Wait,\" Rev butts in a bit confused, \"You're from California too?\" He asks Dahlia in surprise. Dahlia turns to stare at Rev, but remembers that not many of the other players knew that she was from another state. \"Oh yeah! I nearly forgot no one else knew that but Gerry.\" She states softly before turning towards Rev again, \"I'm originally from Los Angeles, California and only just recently moved here before intruding into your football tryouts,\" she explains to Rev as he listens intently. He was silent for awhile and Ronnie and Dahlia began to grow concerned. \"Rev?\" Ronnie asks snapping Rev out of his thoughts. \"Oh! I'm sorry you two,\" He apologizes before trying to explain himself, \"I just realized that's why you two are so different from the other… er… white folk here?\" He tries saying without coming off as rude. Dahlia seemeds to catch his drift and simply nods in understanding, Ronnie on the other hand shrugs and begins to eat his food in a manner that told Dahlia just how much of a boy he was on the inside. \"Could you try getting some of that there food into your actual mouth?\" She asks with a daunting smile on her face as she wipes some imaginary food off of her cheek, \"You're raining on me and Rev here.\" This causes Rev to cough in attempts to hide his laughter and Ronnie to stop eating and flick some of his green beans at Dahlia who squeals in protest. As the three continue to joke and talk amongst each other Dahlia suddenly feels a hand cover her eyes and someone taking something from her plate. She tries to pry the hand off, but all she could hear was Ronnie, Rev, and someone else laughing. At first she assumed it was Gerry, but she remembered seeing him sat down next to Julius prior to this. \"Wait! What are you taking!\" She shouts fearing slightly for her food's sake as she pries the hand off. Once she could focus her vision she sees Alan quickly retreating away with her food. She glances at her plate and gasps when she saw just what was missing from it. \"No! Not my pudding! Alan!\" She pouts, shouting at Alan who simply turns around to reveal he had, not just her own, but a couple of other bowls of pudding. She tries to give her puppy-dog eyes, but he quickly blocks his vision of her while backing away. \"Not going to work, Doll.\" He states teasingly while turning around to refrain from looking at the face that he knew he'd fall victim too if he stared too long, \"I know how that game goes!\" \"You suck Alan!\" She huffs out as she realizes it really wouldn't work if he couldn't see her. She wasn't mad at him, in fact she would have laughed at all the pudding he had if she didn't want her own so dang much. \"Love you too.\" He jokes, shooting a wink her way before quickly turning around to hide his blush at his own statement. He sits at his table only to receive a couple of suggestive nudges from his new found buddies. Dahlia sits there slightly stunned by his statement as well. She knew she shouldn't think too much about it, but couldn't help herself. He was attractive and she was a teenage girl, what was she to do. \"Seems like someones got a crush,\" Ronnie sings teasingly before Dahlia flicks his forehead. Rev simply laughs at the display before continuing to eat his own food. \"You know having a crush isn't anything to be ashamed of,\" Rev chimes in causing Dahlia to turn her stare towards him. \"Don't start with me Rev, I'll flick your forehead too. Despite you being the kindest guy I know.\" She threatens light heartedly causing Rev to raise his hands in innocence. \"I'm just saying. Alan doesn't seem so bad\" He spoke causing Dahlia to flush a tad darker. \"I'm not interested in romance right now,\" She whines quietly as she covers her face in slight embarrassment as the two guys continue to poke fun at her. \"Why? I'm sure you'd make a great wife,\" Rev compliments as Ronnie agrees, digging into his food again. Dahlia brushes off the compliment and uncovers her face to poke at the food on her plate. \"Don't look so down, Doll.\" Ronnie tries to cheer her up, but laughs when Dahlia juts her lip out further, intensify her sadness in protest. He rolls his eyes before placing his bowl of pudding on Dahlia's tray. \"You can have mines,\" Ronnie gives in causing Dahlia to gasp and quickly begin eating his pudding. \"Yeah, you're welcome.\" He states sarcastically as Rev shakes his head and watches as Dahlia happily ate the pudding. \"You must really like pudding,\" Rev comments causing Dahlia to slow her pace. \"Yeah, it reminds me a lot of my mom,\" She responds a little lower than usual and the two guys take notice of that. It almost seemed weird to see Dahlia look even the smallest amount distressed. They had seen her happy, and even angry, but never upset. \"Well, then you can have mines as well,\" Rev offers pushing his pudding towards her. She smiles gratefully and accepts his offer. \"Thanks, Rev!\" Her prior depression gone. \"You thank him, but not me?!\" Ronnie guffaws causing Dahlia to wave him off. \"Hi Petey,\" Rev greets as said jokester plants himself next to him, Dahlia quickly notices that Petey seems anxious. Petey greets Rev before turning to look at Ronnie with a bright smile on his face, Dahlia who was eating her second bowl of pudding eyes them curiously. \"Hey, Sunshine.\" He seems to glance around nervously before continuing, \"It's not like I care or nothin', but bein' your roommate and all, uh… you was just messin' with Bertier right? You— you was just messin with his mind, right? You're not really, uh…\" He stutters out causing Dahlia to grow confused as he kept gesturing towards Ronnie. Who was Sunshine? And were Petey and Ronnie roommates? She chose to remain quiet and listen. \"What are you talking about, Petey?\" Ronnie asks shrugging. This causes Petey to grow more fidgety. \"Look, man, it don't matter to me, you know. I— If, you know…\" Petey goes on shrugging and doing hand gestures. Dahlia wants to chuckle, but refrains from doing so seeing as Petey was distressed enough without her making fun of him. She was still quite confused however the others seemed to know what was going on. She shoots a look towards Rev who still remains calm and silently asks him what was going on. He smiles and gestures towards Ronnie once again which only confuses her even more. \"I just gotta know.\" Petey finally gets out crossing his arms slightly. Dahlia concludes that this must have something to do with what happened in the locker room. She just didn't understand what Petey needed to know? It was just a peck on the cheek for goodness sake. \"If it don't matter. What's the big deal?\" Ronnie asks as he tilts his head in slight confusion. Petey seems to freak a bit on the inside and looks at Dahlia for help. \"I gotta know.\" He spoke once again this time staring at Dahlia, \"You know more about Mr. Sunny here than I do. Tell me! Is he… You know?\" Dahlia only opens her mouth not entirely sure what Petey was getting at. She could conclude however that Sunshine was Ronnie, and something that Sunshine did, did not sit well with Petey. She looks to her side for help, but Ronnie only sits next to her with a smile. \"Know what, Petey?\" She asks trying to clear things up. \"Yeah, know what?\" Ronnie echoes causing Petey to flip out. \"You know what I gotta know!\" Petey tries to say softly while standing up. His voice only got louder though as he points at Ronnie, \"Don't mess with my mind!\" The guy sitting on the other side of Ronnie leans over at this point. \"White coach been keeping Petey out in the sun too long.\" He warns him and Dahlia trying to explain Petey's outburst as he storms away. Rev only laughs at what had happened as Dahlia just turns to stare at the now dubbed, Sunshine. \"So, I'm guessing you're Sunshine?\" She asks Ronnie receiving a cheeky smile her way. \"I guess it matches. You have the golden locks, you're from California—\" \"I've got a sunny personality, and a hundred watt smile.\" Sunshine continues her list causing her to sigh at his ego. \"What did you do to Gerry?\" She asks bluntly. Sunshine gives her an innocent look, but she doesn't budge. \"I showed you what I was going to do,\" he stated as if it was nothing, but this causes Rev and a couple others around them to nearly spit their food out. \"You kissed her!\" Rev asks almost as if he were reprimanding him. Some of the other guys were making remarks under their breaths like \" lucky .\" \"Well, yeah. What's the big deal?\" She asks nonchalantly. She didn't see why everyone was reacting so wildly about this. \"I don't know what you guys did back at California, but you don't just kiss each other casually on the lips here.\" Rev explains once he calms himself down some to address the situation with a level-head. \"What!\" Dahlia exclaims in shock. That's why everyone was responding so dramatically about this?! \"Ronnie!\" She scolds him, slapping him as he just laughs at the situation. \"No! He just kissed me on the cheek!\" She defends causing the rest of the guys around her to visually relax some. Things seem to calm down for a bit before Dahlia thought about something else. \"If you thought he kissed me on the lips. Then that means…\" Dahlia freezes for a second before she breaks down laughing finally understanding why Petey reacted the way he did. \"I see you understand what happened in the locker room now,\" Rev concludes as he continues to eat now at peace knowing that Sunshine didn't just kiss the only girl Titan here. \"You kissed Gerry on the lips!\" Dahlia concludes as Ronnie nods casually, \"Well… How was it?\" She asks with just the smallest amount of interest, causing the guys around her to laugh a bit. \"Well… You were right, he didn't seem to enjoy it as much as I thought he would,\" He answers truthfully retelling Dahlia of how he did indeed throw fists at him in response. \"Are you ever going to tell Petey the truth?\" She inquires scooping more pudding into her mouth. Sunshine thinks about it for a bit before shaking his head. \"Nah, he'll figure it out eventually.\" He remarks causing Dahlia to shake her head at him. Poor Petey never seemed to catch a break. Anyways! Sorry it was a short chapter! I'm trying to get them out for you guys I swear! Here are the results from last chapter's question! Choice One - 12 | Choice Two - 6 | Choice Three - 2 It looks like Choice One is winning by a lot, so this story just may end up a Alan x OC story! I hope I don't lose followers because of this because who knows? Maybe, I'll feel generous at the end and give the Rev supporters a treat anyways. Also, I know some of you have been suggesting that Sunshine and Dahlia should be a pairing, but I have an idea for them. They will not end up together though! I'm so sorry.[Chapter 9] Hey everyone! Long time no see! Don't worry I haven't given up on this story or anything I've just been having a hard time finding the time to update. Rest assured though, I don't intend on abandoning this story. Thank you all who are still following the story and I hope you all continue to do so and enjoy this long awaited update! Disclaimer: I don't own any of this. Only Dahlia and Danny. A Black and White Film: A Titan's Documentary Chapter Nine: Hey, Hey, Hey, GoodBye \"Now, you're sure you can do this?\" Coach Boone asks Dahlia as she stands up from her previous spot across from him and the other coaches. She was asked to meet with them after practice that day and gladly agreed to sit and speak with them, but she didn't expect it to be about something so important. She scratches at her arm a bit in unease, but nods regardless. \"You can trust that I'll try my best, Coach Boone.\" She responds with a wary, but sweet smile as she begins to make her way towards the door. \"All right then,\" Coach Boone nods, \"Nice doing business with you, Ms. Black.\" He calls after her as the young woman reaches the door. Dahlia seems to hesitate before turning around to look back at the coaches. \"You know I'd do anything for the team, Coach.\" She speaks softly while gripping the door in determination before finally taking her leave. The coaches each smile at her words before turning to look towards each other. \"You sure about this?\" Coach Yoast speaks up looking at Boone in question. It's not that he didn't believe in the female Titan, but it was an awful lot to ask of her. \"I agree, she ain't nothin' but a child!\" Coach Hinds adds in. Coach Boone simply smirks as he brings his fists to his chin in thought. \"Ms. Black can do it. She has a natural charm about her that is sure to work in her favor,\" He explains bluntly to the coaches. \"Even if that's true, she's only a girl. This ' charm ' can only take her so far.\" Coach Tyrell spoke up causing the other three to glance at him sharply. This statement may have been true for this day and age that they lived in, but it was insulting nonetheless. \"She can do it. She's a Titan,\" Coach Boone states with a tone that ends the conversation. Dahlia was honored that the coaches trusted her with this new task, but she was nervous for it at the same time. She shrugs it off to the back of her mind and determinedly tells herself that she can do it, if not at least she'd try. \"I know! I know!\" She hears suddenly from around the hall. In her fright she jumps slightly and stumbles against someone's door. She mentally curses herself for being so clumsy and moves so that she was leaning on the wall instead of a door. It was pretty late and everyone was supposed to be in bed by now. \"Who could be on the phone at this time?\" She quietly ponders to herself as she continues to listen to the unpleasant sounding conversation taking place over the phone. \"What!?\" She hears the player shriek into the phone slightly. Dahlia frowns to herself and cringes as she hears the angry bark from the other side of the line. It was then, that the door closest to her cracks open causing her to jump once again. She abruptly turns to see a sleepy Gerry squinting at her in confusion. \"Doll?\" He asks in a groggy voice, causing Dahlia to quickly hold a finger to her mouth before pointing at her ear, telling him to keep quiet and listen. He furrows his brows slightly before he catches an earful of the argument going down just around the hall. \"Do you know who's talking on the phone?\" She whispers to him as he quietly comes out of his room and closes the door. \"I think it's Alan.\" He spoke back quietly as he leans against the wall next to her. Dahlia brows shoot up and glances at him again before realizing he was in his boxers. She seems to stare at him for a bit before shooting him a disapproving look and mumbling \" gross \" under her breath. This causes Gerry to chuckle at her response. Not many girls would have that exact reaction to him being in his boxers. \"Who's he fightin' with?\" She asks again while tilting her head slightly ignoring Gerry's lack of pants. She was just thankful he was wearing a shirt otherwise this would've been a heck of a lot more awkward. \"Is it his girlfriend?\" She asks causing Gerry to shake his head at her suggestion. \"No. No girlfriend.\" He responds with a slight laugh before growing slightly somber, \"It's his dad.\" At this Dahlia's brows shot skywards. \"His dad!?\" She shrieks quietly in disbelief. Gerry rubs the back of his head before deciding he could tell Dahlia a bit about Alan's troubles. Knowing Alan, he'd probably tell her eventually. \"Listen Doll… Alan's dad isn't anything like your own,\" He states causing Dahlia to turn and give him her complete attention. \"His dad is always expecting a hundred and ten percent from Alan, but nothing Alan does is ever enough. In fact, most of the time Mr. Bosley puts Alan down.\" This causes Dahlia to look down slightly as she recalls how he reacted when he fell sick at practice. That's why he was so ashamed. \"Still, Alan tries to push himself even harder to make his father happy. It doesn't help that he's constantly compared to Ray, and I. His father just never accepts Alan.\" Gerry finishes rubbing the back of his neck in guilt. Dahlia smiles softly as she realizes Gerry genuinely felt responsible for Alan's dilemma. \"Now, that's not fair. You're Mr. Perfect.\" She teases gently before taking on a more serious tone, \"It isn't your fault, you know.\" She comforts softly as Gerry shakes his head at her with a ghost of a smile. \"I've known Alan since we were kids. It's always been that way.\" He tells her quietly as they remain silent for a bit. Suddenly, Gerry perks up a bit before looking at Dahlia as if he thought of an idea. \"What?\" She asks hesitantly at the look he was giving her. \"You should help him,\" he suggest causing her to give him a questioning look. \"And just how would I do that?\" She asks him crossing her arms while doing so, \"I would love to tell his father off for treating his son so poorly, but I don't think that's what you're referring to,\" She concludes. This causes Gerry to widen his eyes before shaking his head at the headstrong female and chuckles at the image of the small female yelling at the large frame of Mr. Bosley. That would be quite a sight to see. \"Just— I don't know… Work your magic on him.\" He suggests causing her to smile and cover her mouth to smother the laughter that was trying to fight its way out. \"My magic, huh?\" She jokes, causing Gerry to elbow her lightly. \"You make it sound like I'm some conjurer of black magic.\" She teases as she looks to Gerry with a wide smile. \"You know what I mean, Doll. You can make him feel better. I know you can.\" Gerry insists in an almost exasperated tone. Dahlia was quiet for a couple of seconds before she begins to lightly guide Gerry back towards his room. \"I'll do my best, Bertier. Now get back to your beauty sleep. Heaven knows you need it.\" She jests dodging his hand that was thrown half-heartedly in her direction. Gerry shoots her a tired smile before he bids her a goodnight and heads back to his room, past an already sleeping Julius. As he lays down in his own bed he begins to think about his childhood friend. He couldn't help but feel guilty for Alan's problems with his father. He expected Alan to be perfect. To do good at football, and get good grades. Heck, he recently found out from Alan himself that his father was pushing him to get a girlfriend who was marriage material. The worst part was that if he didn't present one to his father before graduation he would chose one for him. Cringing lightly at the thought of a forced marriage, Gerry shakes his head. He concludes that it didn't help any that almost all of the girls Alan has ever been interested in before were more interested in himself, or Ray. Gerry flips over in his bed and tries to get some sleep to push back the guilt that was beginning to build up. Dahlia would make him feel better, he just knew it. Outside in the hall, Dahlia had creeped so that she was now peaking around the corner at Alan who was indeed arguing with his father over the phone. \"I understand, Dad. Goodnight.\" He ends the call with a mechanical tone to his voice, hanging the phone back in its place and slowly sinking down the wall holding his face in his hands. Dahlia froze for a few moments in thought, before quietly making her way over to the exhausted figure. \"Hey,\" She greets softly causing Alan to lift his head quickly as he recognizes the voice of the only female Titan. \"Shouldn't you be in bed?\" She asks gently as she lowers herself into a sitting position next to him. \"Did you hear all of that?\" He sighs after a few moments of silence as he leans his head back against the wall. Dahlia sends him an apologetic smile to answer his question. \"Well, I guess it's better that you caught me out after hours rather than Coach Boone.\" He surmises before shifting slightly, \"I would have been sent home in a heartbeat. I'll head to bed now.\" He promises before shooting her a convincing smile and moving to get up. \"Wait,\" Alan stops as he feels Dahlia's soft grip on his wrist, holding him in place. He glances back at her with a curious stare, \"I wasn't sending you off to bed. I wanted to check up on you.\" She murmurs. Alan stares at her for awhile, a strange pang of hope running through his chest. \"Huh?\" Was the clever and somewhat surprised response he came up with. Dahlia simply smiles at him before tugging on his wrist, inviting him to sit back down next to her. \"I overheard your phone call while heading back to my room, and I just wanted to make sure you were okay. It didn't sound too pleasant.\" She explains carefully, not wanting to upset him anymore. \"I just want you to know that I'm here for you if you ever need to talk. I'm more than willing to help you with anything. You're important to the team... and me. We can suffer through things together if you want.\" Alan stars at the beautiful girl in front of him and almost chokes up then and there as she speaks the words he seemed to need to hear at the moment. The two sat in comfortable silence before Alan finally seems to confide in the kind girl. \"My dad,\" He grunts causing Dahlia to peer at him. He stares at her warm hazel eyes, looking for some type of confirmation., \"He just expects too much of me.\" The look Dahlia sends him tells him to go on. \"He wants me to be more like Ray and Gerry.\" Dahlia simply nods as she realizes what Gerry had told her was in fact true. \"Why?\" She protests innocently, although she already knew the answer. She wanted Alan to tell her himself so he could get it off his chest. Venting and letting off steam was good for the soul, that's what her daddy always told her. \"He wants me to be this great football player,\" Alan begins with a bitter chuckle as he leans his head back against the wall and begins to count off the things his father wanted him to be on his fingers. \"He wants me to be the perfect student,\" he ticks off another finger before dropping his hand and staring at the wall across from them. \"He wants me to have an Emma of my own… Just like Gerry.\" He breathes out. He then glances to stare at Dahlia, \"Or you know, at least be successful with the ladies like, Ray.\" He finishes while chuckling a bit more, yet it held a tint of sadness to it. Dahlia frowns at this, but remains silent. She wasn't sure she wanted Alan to be anything like Ray, that just didn't rub her the right way. \"I'm no Gerry, and I'm no Ray.\" He seems to finish unenthusiastically. Dahlia lets that sink in for a bit before bringing her knees up to her chest and resting her chin on them. \"I know you're not Gerry or Ray. You're Alan.\" She urges causing Alan to glance her way. \"Yeah, well Alan doesn't get football, good grades, or the ladies.\" He grumbles with a tired smile trying to make light of the situation. She didn't understand how he could just kick himself while he's already so down. \"Alan, you're great at football, and I bet you're good at school too.\" She stresses while nudging him slightly. \"And with the ladies?\" He asks her which makes her smile wider. \"I'm sure you're great with them too.\" Dahlia notes with a roll of her eyes as Alan simply shakes his head. \"Not a chance,\" He says causing Dahlia to tilt her head. \"I used to only have to compete with Ray and Gerry for a girl's attention. Now, I have guys like Petey and Sunshine who are complete heart throbs to compete with!\" He moans causing Dahlia to laugh at his comical expression. \"Admit it, I bet even you're all out for that blonde dreamboat!\" Alan teases elbowing the laughing girl next to him. He secretly hopes he was wrong about this and could feel his heart clenching tightly at the thought of her agreeing. \"Who? Ronnie?! Ew! No way!\" Dahlia blanches slightly as a joke. Ronnie, or better yet Sunshine, was attractive, but he was more like family to her. This makes Alan feel a lot better unbeknownst to her. \"Why are you so set with getting a lady so soon?\" She asks curiously once they calm down a bit. Alan scoffs before bringing a knee up to rest his arm on. \"If I don't find myself someone I can marry by the time I graduate… Let's just say my father will find one for me.\" He finishes, which slightly horrifies Dahlia. \"Your Dad would actually do that?!\" She shrieks. How happy would anyone be if they were forced to love someone they barely even knew! \"Yeah, my Dad is really something isn't he?\" He asks after a chuckle. \"Yeah, he's something, all right.\" She growls, which seems to catch Alan by surprise. \"You know what, Alan?\" She finally asks him, \"Don't worry about any of that stuff. Just be you.\" She gushes while flashing him a soft smile. Alan simply stares at her with a look of disbelief. \"But-\" Before he could go on however, Dahlia interrupts him again. \"But nothing. I'll help you get through this and keep your Dad off of your back. I told you, we go through things as a team.\" She answers softly causing Alan to shake his head at the crazy girl. He wants to believe her, he did, but he just wasn't sure. \"Thanks for listening. It felt nice to get things off my chest.\" Alan admits a bit embarrassed at the mini breakdown he had. The girl next to him always seems to catch him at his weakest, yet she never looked down on him for them. \"Don't worry about it, Alan.\" She brushes off as she stands up deciding that it was beginning to get pretty late. She looks back down at Alan who seems to be in thought once again. \"You know, if you ever need a break from your Dad. You could always hang with me at my house.\" She offers causing Alan to look at her in surprise. \"My Dad loves taking in strays\" She jokes with a wink causing Alan to crack a smile. She reaches a hand out to help him up and he gladly takes it. \"I'll keep that in mind… Thanks,\" He tells her as he lets go of her hand, after noting how soft and tiny they were in his own. She shakes her head before walking down the hall towards her room. \"Night, Doll.\" He calls out after the charming girl who stops after hearing his voice. \"Hey Alan, you know… Thinking back to what you told me earlier. Don't compare yourself to Gerry or Ray anymore, alright?\" She asks while turning around to face him again. Alan stands there and raises an eyebrow. \"I like you as Alan much more than I would another Ray… And we definitely don't need more than one big-headed, Gerry.\" She spoke softly causing Alan to flush slightly. \"Just don't tell Gerry I told you that, he'll get salty.\" She warns with a wink before turning to continue her way down the hall. \"Sweet dreams, Alan.\" She calls out to him just before turning the corner. This time as she spoke however, her accent slips out and Alan can't help but smile at the sound of it. Her accent and voice was something unique to him and he smiled stupidly to himself as he recalled what she said. She liked him, as just him. He stood in the hallway for a bit more before heading to his room in silent bliss. He pondered on whether… just maybe… Dahlia could be the Emma he was looking for. He laughs at the corny thought before shaking his head and continuing to his room. No, she wouldn't be his Emma… She would just be his, Dahlia. He chuckles at his own thoughts before smiling to himself. Now, that would be one sweet dream. The final day at camp was finally amongst the team and their spirits couldn't be any higher. Dahlia stood next to a smiley Sheryl as they watch the boys finish up their last warm up before school began, and with it began football season as well. Thinking of school made her happy, but a little anxious at the same time. She knew she'd have a lot to get used to in this new school and state, but knowing that she'd have the boys on the team to watch her back gave her comfort. \"What are you!?\" She hears Coach Boone's sharp voice pierce the air causing her to once again pay attention to the boys jogging in place. \"Mobile! Agile! Hostile!\" The guys shout back in unison. Dahlia could feel herself growing giddy as she listened to their pep talk. Her camera wasn't around her neck, which left her feelings a little naked of sorts, but she had to pack those up already. \"What is pain?\" Coach called out. \"French bread!\" Came the response. \"What is fatigue?\" \"Army clothes!\" \"Will you ever quit?\" Coach yells holding a hand to his ear. \"No! We want some more! We want some more! We want some more!\" They respond vigorously. \"Turn in!\" Boone calls causing all of the guys to turn in and gather together as they jump and chant. Dahlia and Sheryl move closer to the group as Coach Yoast waves them over. The guys seem to make a circle as their captain begins a speech. Dahlia smiles as she recalled just how much they've changed in camp. \"Let me ask you something, Mr. Campbell.\" Gerry asks as he takes his helmet off. When Julius gives him a sound of acknowledgment he went on to ask, \"What kind of power you got?\" \"Oh, man, you know I've got some soul power.\" Julius responds putting emphasis on soul. \"What kind of power you got?!\" Gerry repeats causing Julius to respond with an even more powerful response of soul power. \"Let me ask you something now, Mr. Bertier.\" Julius asks as he circles Gerry. \"How strong are you?\" He shouts. \"I'm too strong!\" He responds seriously. \"How strong?\" Julius taunts. \"Too strong!\" Gerry shouts right back. The guys who were chanting around them only continue on beat and begin to grow louder. \"I want a victory!\" They all begin to shout. Dahlia grins radiantly as she watches them all cheer together, but that quickly dims as she saw that amongst the jumping figures there was one who wasn't too thrilled or jumping at all. She didn't need to see his face or number to know that it was Ray Budds. However, before she could grow any more angry at his attitude she was pulled into the group of sweaty (and smelly) boys as they continued to celebrate enthusiastically with her now in-toll. She looks around and sees that it was Alan and Blue who had pulled her in and squeaked as someone hauled her over their shoulder as they began to all make their way back to the locker room. \"Let me help you with those,\" Dahlia glances up to see who belongs to the voice and smiles as she sees Big ol' Blue smiling down at her kneeled figure. She grins back and nods before zipping up her duffel bag and standing to hand him the bag that now contained her precious cameras. She took the time to flatten the dress she now sported since she needs to be dressed appropriately for their return to the \"real world.\" \"Well don't this seem familiar,\" She ponders jokingly before grinning back at him. \"Thanks Big Blue.\" \"Ain't no problem, Baby.\" He tells her as they begin to walk side by side to the bus. It was finally the day that camp had come to an end and although Dahlia was sad to leave, she had to admit that she was happy as well. She glances around at both black and white helping, talking, laughing, and joking with each other and couldn't help but appreciate what Coach Boone had done to these boys. \"You know Blue,\" Dahlia begins with a chuckle, which caught Blue's attention, \"When you first offered to help me with my bags… I had to admit I gave you my bag full of clothes because I was afraid you'd drop and ruin my cameras.\" She admits a bit sheepishly. Blue seems to raise an eyebrow at this, but remains silent and let her continue. \"I want you to know that I'd trust you with my life now, and I'm really glad that I got to know not only you, but everyone else here. You've all grown so much, and I've come to see and love you all as my own brothers.\" Dahlia finishes as Blue tears up slightly as her words hit his heart. Something about this girl was so pure, and hearing these words come from her mouth in such a warm accented voice was enough to make anyone melt. He shifted the noticeably heavier bag she had handed him and quickly realizes that he was now indeed holding the bag that holds her cameras, and that touches him. \"You know… I have to admit something too.\" He spoke up after composing himself slightly. Dahlia looks up at him and gives a look that tells him to continue. \"When I first spoke to you. I was scared out of my mind.\" He breathes out. \"You were scared of little ol' me?\" She asks doubtfully as she takes in his large physique. \"You could literally squish me if you wanted too,\" She states causing him and herself to laugh. \"I know, it seems a little farfetched, but I truly was afraid. I expected you to turn around and spit those acid words that every other white person has said to my kind.\" Blue seems ashamed to admit this as he speaks, but Dahlia only listens. \"But, you turned around and smiled at me. Even spoke my name with nothing but gratefulness and respect in your voice.\" He now smiled at the kind hearted girl next to him, \"You have one of the most beautiful souls I have ever seen, and I thank you for that. I think we all thank you for that.\" Dahlia froze for a bit before smiling a bit tearfully before throwing herself at the big guy to hug him. \"Blue, you're too good to me.\" She announces as he hugs his new found little sister back. When Dahlia walks boards the bus, a small war breaks out amongst the guys as they fight over who would have the newly dubbed \"Titan's Doll\" sit next to them. It didn't take long for the decision to be made when the captain of the team quickly wraps her up in a brotherly hug and claims her as his seat-mate by pulling her down into the seat next to him. Mindful of the fact that she had a dress on. This causes a lot of the guys to \"boo\" at their captain who simply ignores them. \"Good Mornin' to you too, Gerry.\" Dahlia drawls as she continues to make herself comfortable in the seat she was pulled into. Gerry grins next to her and messes up her hair despite her protests. \"Mornin' Doll.\" He greets before leaning back in his seat comfortably. Dahlia simply smiles before peering around her to greet Rev, Lastik, Petey, Alan, Blue, and Jules who was laid in the back with some of the bags. \"So, did you help Alan?\" Gerry whispers to her as everyone begins to talk amongst each other. Dahlia seems to glance at him in surprise before glancing back to make sure Alan wasn't paying attention to them. \"I spoke to him if that's what you mean.\" She responds to him in slight confusion. What else did he expect her to do? Gerry smiles and nods. \"What'd you say to him?\" He asks. Dahlia thinks for a bit before responding. \"I basically told him I'd help him with anything he needed. I also told him to not try to be Ray, or you cause I'd hate to have more of you around.\" She finishes with a mischievous smile. Gerry gives a mock gasp of hurt while grabbing at his chest. \"You injure me, Doll\" He says pathetically before joining Dahlia in laughter. \"You know, I'm glad everyone is getting along now.\" Dahlia spoke after her laughter faded as she glances around at everyone laughing and talking. Gerry seems to join her in observing everyone else and smiles as well. \"Yeah, me too.\" He spoke softly causing Dahlia to grin. \"How's it feel to be back in a dress?\" He asks finally taking notice of the dress she now wore. Dahlia glances down at her attire with a slight frown before shrugging. \"It's a bit inconvenient, but I can get use to it. I like the pants better though.\" She replies as she pats the ends of it down more securely. There was no need for the wind coming from the windows to blow that up. \"Me too.\" Gerry replies offhandedly causing Dahlia to elbow him a bit harshly. \"What?!\" He asks caught off guard before meeting the slight glare Dahlia was sending him. He then realizes what he said and how it could have been taken. \"No!\" He quickly corrects himself, \"I didn't mean that, I meant I like you more covered so none of these guys get any ideas.\" He said in a hurry, trying to explain himself. \"I don't want to have to beat up half of my team for looking at you like that.\" He murmurs softly. This causes Dahlia to chuckle and give him a side hug. \"You don't have to worry about them.\" She replies trying to calm the over protective Bertier down. \"I can take care of myself.\" It wasn't long after that, that Petey had gotten them all to sing along with him as they grew closer to home. \"Na na na na~ Na na na na~ Hey, Hey, Hey, Goodbye~\" They all sang and clap as they drove into the parking lot holding all of their families. \"Let me hear you!\" Petey shouts out causing them to repeat the chorus once more before the bus came to a complete halt in order to let them all out. Once Dahlia steps off of the bus, with the help of Gerry she hears a familiar voice shout out. She glances around and quickly bolts off from Gerry's side to hug her father who was shouting for her. Gerry chuckles at the father and daughter duo as he watches Danny pick Dahlia up and swing her in a circle. \"Hiya Pops!\" Dahlia chirps happily as she's let loose from his hold. \"How's my lil' girl doin'?\" He asks as he smoothes her hair. Dahlia goes into a ramble telling him of all the things that happened at camp as Gerry makes his way over with his and Dahlia's bags. Placing them down he smiles and greets his own mother who was next to the Black family. \"Hey mom,\" Gerry greets with a wide smile before going in to hug his mother. \"Welcome home,\" She gushes happily as she pats him on the back. It was then that Dahlia greets Mrs. Bertier as well and hugs her lightly. Gerry glances at Danny as he brings the boy in for a short hug as well. \"Thanks for taking care of my girl.\" He states as the two separate. Gerry smiles and rubs the back of his neck slightly remembering how he had gave her quite the split on the lip earlier. \"Yeah, well… She's more than capable of protecting herself.\" He tells the older man who simply laughs. \"She told me you gave her a bit of a scrape. She also told me she dang well near broke your nose afterwards.\" Danny sympathized while patting the slightly flushed football star in front of him. \"Hey,\" Sunshine calls out causing both Dahlia and Gerry to give him their attention. \"Look man, are we cool?\" He asks holding out a hand towards Gerry. Dahlia glances up at him while he stares at Sunshine for a while. \"Yeah, we're cool.\" He answers shaking Sunshine's hand. Dahlia smiles and hugs Ronnie after their exchange. \"Well, come on you two. We need to get on home.\" Danny calls out to the both of them while picking up not only Dahlia's bags, but Gerry's as well. This causes the two to raise their eyebrows. \"We car pooled down,\" Mrs. Bertier explains to the two as they smile and nod in understanding. Dahlia turns to tell Gerry something, but was elbowed by him first. She quickly glares at him in question to see him looking at something off in the distance. \"What you looking at?\" She asks before following his line of sight to see Alan with his father. It didn't look to cheery. In fact it looked like he was being interrogated. \"Is that Alan's dad?\" She asks Gerry as he simply nods in response. \"It doesn't look like it's going too good.\" She observes with a frown. \"He's probably drilling Alan for details about camp.\" He tells her. Dahlia frowns before walking towards the two figures. Gerry looks back to his mother and Danny's figure before sighing and following after Dahlia to see what she was going to do. \"I told you, Dad, I made it through and everything's fine.\" Alan points out as he slouches under his father's stare. \"And you're sure you're starting, you didn't get replace by any of their kind did you?!\" Mr. Bosley asks, his tone dipped in disgust while looking at the other colored families around them. Before Alan could answer, a hand was placed on his shoulder causing him to turn around to meet hazel colored eyes. \"Hey, Alan,\" She greeta softly glancing over to Mr. Bosley for a second before smiling widely at the two of them. \"Doll?!\" He gasps, surprised and confused. He did not want her to meet his father, especially at times like this. \"I just wanted to remind you of what I told you earlier,\" She spoke a bit cryptically, but the look she gave Alan told him exactly what she meant. \"Also I wanted to give you a hug before I left. I won't see you until we start school anyways.\" She spoke while bringing him in tightly to whisper in his ear. \"I told you I'd help,\" she whispered as she pulls away from their embrace. It was then that she turns slightly to address his father. \"Hello! You must be Mr. Bosley.\" She inquires towards the large and somewhat intimidating man, who stares at her in slight confusion. Alan stands on the side with a look of anxiety as Gerry comes up to his side and places a comforting hand on his shoulder. \"My name is Dahlia Black. I'm the Titan's personal photographer and stat taker,\" she introduces herself before holding out a hand to the man in a professional manner. He stares at it causing Dahlia to smile wider as he proved to be a bit of a challenge. \"I must say, your son is a phenomenal player, and I had quite the time photographing him play. I can't wait to see him on the field. It's a pleasure to meet the father of such a player.\" She sweet talks successfully as Mr. Bosley lips curve into a small smile before shaking the tiny female's hand in return. This stumps Alan and Gerry who stood to the side in awe. \"Well, I'm glad my son has finally seemed to prove himself on the field.\" Mr. Bosley implores proudly as he releases Dahlia's hand. Her smile seems to falter slightly in annoyance with his tone before nodding at the older man. \"He's definitely a valuable player.\" She chirps while glancing over to Alan and Gerry. \"Well, that's all I wanted to say. It's been nice to meet you, Mr. Bosley.\" She nods politely before turning towards Alan, \"I'll see you at school Alan, and don't forget my offer.\" She instucts causing Alan to simply nod in silence as she turns away with a wave. \"Bye Alan. Bye Mr. Bosley.\" Gerry bids a farewell too as he follows Dahlia towards their awaiting parents. Alan smiles slowly as he realizes that Dahlia did intend to keep her promise of helping him. \" Well, who's that?\" Alan turns to look at his father as he asks the question. \"That's, Doll.\" He answers simply. Mr. Bosley stares at his son before staring after the young woman who proved to be quite well mannered. \"Doll, huh? How does she know Gerry?\" He asks once again. Alan notes that his father's tone changed and wasn't as harsh as it was before. It was still demanding, but not so harsh. \"She's his neighbor. Practically his sister.\" Alan answers turning towards his father once again who nods and turns towards their car. \"She's a nice girl.\" He states, ending their conversation. Alan glances back once more before smiling and following his father. Alright! So, if you haven't notice it yet. The story pairing is going to be AlanxOC. However, I may or may not consider giving a small treat to the runner-up pairing in the end. We'll just have to see, right? Please Fav/Review/Follow![Chapter 10] What's up, everyone! Did y'all miss me? I know it's been awhile since I've posted (like a few years) but you guys have all been so incredibly supportive. This story surprisingly still receives a lot of attention, so I'm going to try and finish it for you all. Couple of changes to mention: I've added an actual cover to the story! Dahlia's face claim is Emily Rudd. Dahlia's hair is up to her shoulders, rather than down to her mid-back. I'll be going back to update the previous chapter… Just in case anyone needs to go back and reread them :D Warning! there will be racial slurs used in this story. It, in no way, reflects my personal views on society. A Black and White Film: A Titan's Documentary Chapter Ten: All I'm Askin' Is For A Little Respect The first day of school at T.C. Williams came around quickly and Dahlia can practically feel herself bouncing in her seat, she could barely contain her excitement. Her father decided to open up his shop a little later in order to drive his baby girl off to school on her first day. Unlike his daughter however, he wasn't shaking in a good way. In fact, as he glances over to his daughter and grips the steering wheel tightly, you could say he was downright terrified. \"Oh, I can't wait to get to school, daddy-o!\" Doll began her excited chatter in a wispy voice, her eyes aglow with glee. She didn't seem to notice her father's discomfort as he sat stiffly next to her in the driver's seat. \"I'll finally be able to see the guys again!\" She continues as Danny simply takes a deep and much needed breath in order to calm himself down, before nodding solemnly at Dahlia's words. He really didn't have the heart to tell Doll that things weren't going to be how she pictured at school. He knew she had a somewhat naive idea that just because the boys at camp got along, the rest of the community would do the same. \"Darlin'...\" He begins in a low, but shaky voice. This caught Dahlia's attention instantly. She rarely ever heard her father speak like this, especially with that tone. The last time he used that tone of voice, was the last time she saw her momma. \"I know you think this'll be easy, but I want you to remember that things don't change overnight, all right?\" He warns cryptically. Dahlia was silent for a bit as she tried to understand what exactly he was getting at. They remain silent in the car until the view of the school could finally be seen in the distance. \"What's going on?\" Dahlia asks leaning forward in her seat as she catches a glimpse of what seemed to be a mob of people surrounding the school. Danny grips the steering wheel a bit harder as he gazes at the sight in front of him. \"Seems like they're protestin',\" He answers causing the glow in Dahlia's eyes to fade ever so slightly. She could feel herself grow angry, but quickly shoves it away. She understood now… So, this is what her father meant. \"Wow,\" she breathes as the car slows to a creep, coming up behind traffic. Danny glances at his daughter and places a hand on her head in an attempt to cheer her up some. \"Just remember to take things one step at a time, got that, Doll?\" Dahlia only nods, distracted with the amount of angry adults who were being forced and held back by police. She could barely read some of their signs that read \" ALEXANDRIA MOTHERS AGAINST BUSING \" and \" WHEN WE'RE RIGHT WE RIGHT .\" She just couldn't understand what they were so upset about. She let out a heavy sigh and turns to kiss her daddy on the cheek. \"I'll see you at home daddy. Wish me luck!\" She smiles before opening her car door. \"Hold on, baby!\" Danny calls out just before she could step out. Surprised, Dahlia turns back to her father with knitted brows. \"You make sure you're careful out there, you hear?\" He warns softly, but as Dahlia's expression shifts he quickly continues, \"I know you can take care of yourself, honey, but a father still worries.\" This causes a warm smile to spread on his daughter's lips. \"You fret too much, old man!\" She jokes causing her father to sputter indignantly, for he was definitely not old, \"I'll be careful you can trust me. I'll look for one of the guys to stick with if it'll make you feel any better.\" She hums before turning to scan through the crowd. Danny simply shakes his head as he drops his hold on Dahlia's arm. \"There!\" She states, pointing out towards the crowd, \"It's Ronnie! I'll go hang with him, cool?\" She soothes as she begins to once again leave the car. Danny scans the crowd to see the familiar face and appears to accept the idea. \"Just be safe,\" he warns her. \"Love you, pops!\" She calls out before closing the door and waving as he drove away. She turns to gaze at the crowd and fails to see her father's worried glances through his rearview mirror. \"WE DON'T WANT THEM HERE!\" Yells a blonde woman who continued to push against the many policemen on duty. Dahlia scowls before shaking her head and heading towards Ronnie's direction. \"Ronnie!\" She chirps out as soon as she gets close enough for him to hear her over all the other unnecessary shouting. Hearing this, Ronnie quickly spins with a bright smile and open arms as he spots his favorite female in Virginia. \"Well, if it isn't a sight for sore eyes,\" he mumbles into her hair as soon as Dahlia's hugging him tightly. She pulls away with a smile and he smiles back, glad to finally see a friendly face. As they pull away from each other they both glance around at all the chaos with troubled expressions. \"Nothing like home, is it?\" Dahlia asks sarcastically as she elbows him. This emits a scoff from the blonde next to her as he responds with, \" Yeah , no kidding.\" They turn and begin to walk towards the school entrance when they were stopped. \"We don't need you here either, hippie boy,\" a boy with a buzzcut sneers as he shoves Ronnie backwards. This causes Dahlia to stop as well seeing as a couple of other guys begin to crowd around them as well. \"You hear what he said?\" One of the other kids ask as they proceed to shove Ronnie in another direction. Dahlia could feel herself grow agitated as Ronnie lets out a heavy sigh and pushes his way through the boys. Dahlia was quick to follow, but was halted by one of them grabbing her wrist. \"Hey, honey, you don't want him.\" The one holding her says causing the others to chuckle. \"Yeah, you belong with a real man, like me.\" Another taunts before glancing at Ronnie, \"Not a sissy like this.\" Hearing this Dahlia rips her arm out of the guys wrist and glares at him furiously. Ronnie opens his mouth about to say something, but Dahlia cuts him off. \" Oh? \" She scoffs as she shoves past the other few guys surrounding her in order to reach Ronnie's side. \"I am with a real man,\" she growls as she makes it to Ronnie's side, before turning to look back at the troublemakers. Ronnie raises an eyebrow at the girl next to him, and lets a small smirk make its way to his face. \"And I'll have to recline your offer. I don't associate myself with livestock,\" Dahlia snarls as she quickly grabs Ronnie's wrist and begins walking away from the boys. Ronnie easily takes wider strides to keep up with her pace. \"Learn some manners, you pigs!\" She barks out over her shoulder as they leave, causing the boys to shout in protest. \"So, I'm a real man, huh?\" Ronnie asks puffing out his chest lightly. Dahlia glances his way and rolls her eyes letting his wrist fall out of her grasp. \"Shut up,\" she splutters trying to hold back laughter. Ronnie takes the time to admire said girl. He had no idea know she could be a spitfire when needed. \"You're good though, right?\" The question causes Dahlia's steps to falter. Glancing over to Ronnie, she's alarmed to find such a serious expression on his face. She takes a moment to think back on what just happened, sure it was a bit intimidating, but nothing she couldn't handle, at least not just yet. \"I'm all right, Ronnie,\" she confirms with a soft smile. Touched that he even thought to ask. \"Let's just find some of the other guys, yeah?\" Ronnie responds while placing his arm around her shoulders to shield her away from the hectic crowd. \"What you doin' in my school, boy?\" Lastik jests as soon as he spots a familiar face in the crazy crowd of students. Petey gives the lovable giant a half smile before clapping their hands together in a warm greeting. They both take a moment to look around them. \"Man, this stuff is messed up,\" Lastik murmurs, as Petey stares out amongst the crowd watching as two dudes of the opposite race begin to fight causing the police surrounding them to rush in. \"Yeah,\" Petey agrees finally glancing at Lastik, \"anything serious happen, they shut the school down, and our season goes down the drain.\" They both had a hard time believing that not too long ago, their team was the same way. \"This here's real messed up,\" Petey repeats before nudging Louie, \"but there sure are a lot of pretty women here.\" He observes eyeing some of the females who were making their way to class, causing Louie to agree. \"Speaking of pretty women,\" Petey mumbles before motioning to a familiar face in the crowd. \"Dolly!\" Louie shouts happily, hoping to grab the girl's attention. It seems to work as Dahlia's head snaps to look in their direction, an elated smile growing on her face. Tugging on Ronnie's arm they both begin to jog over. \"Hey guys!\" She greets glad to see others on the team sticking together. The two hug her tightly before exchanging bro-hugs with Sunshine. \"This seems pretty bad,\" Ronnie voices, \"has it always been this bad here?\" He asks glancing over to look at Lastik and Petey. \"Yes,\" Petey answers without hesitation. The bluntness of his response causes Ronnie and Lastik to fidget slightly. \"Well, screw them. Let them throw their tantrums,\" Dahlia snorts while rolling her hazel eyes. The acid held within her tone catches the three boys' attention. Louie seems surprised by her outburst, but Ronnie and Petey smirk. \"What?\" She stammers a bit, catching the three staring at her after a bit of silence, \"They're acting like rotten children who ain't get their way.\" Crossing her arms, Ronnie snickers noticing her accent became increasingly more obvious the more wound up she got. \"Where did this fiery side come from, Doll?\" Petey praises as he loops an arm around her shoulder flirtatiously, \"just when I thought you couldn't get anymore attractive.\" Dahlia laughs as Petey gives her an enamored look. \"If you think this is attractive, you should have seen her earlier,\" Ronnie muses catching the attention of the other two, \"she was about ready to take on four dudes, twice her size.\" Petey gives her an impressed look, while Louie cracks up laughing. \"Ronnie! They were insulting you!\" She protests turning back to look over her and Petey's shoulder, \"Ain't lettin' no one bully my boys.\" The comment manages to warm the three males' hearts as they all gaze after the dark haired beauty. \"We won't let anything happen to our Tiny Titan either,\" Louie pipes up sweetly. \"You know we've got your back,\" Petey's quick to agree. Dahlia glances back at Ronnie to see him give her a nod as well. \"Family sticks together, right?\" She asks with a dimpled smile. The group happily makes their way towards the entrance of the building, doing their best to ignore the sneers and shouts from the outside world. Dahlia didn't want to admit it, but this broke her heart to witness. The amount of hate people could have for their fellow man, just because the pigmentation of their skin, baffled her to no end. She found herself sneering at anyone who even glanced at Petey wrong. She even found herself glaring at some of the colored people who shoved at Ronnie, Louie, or herself as well. What was wrong with everyone? Did they have no respect at all?! Just as they were about to enter the building, Dahlia stops causing the three boys to look back at her. She squints trying to identify some familiar looking figures in the distance. \"Is that Gerry and Julius?\" She asks causing the others to squint as well. \"It is!\" She cheers glancing back at the others, \"I'll catch up with you guys in a few.\" Before she can take off down the few steps in front of the entrance, Petey grips her forearm. \"You sure that's a good idea?\" He asks her nervously. \"I'll be fine, Petey,\" she comforts, \"I'm going directly to them and I'll walk back with them.\" This seems to reassure Petey as he loosens his grip. She smiles softly y being reminded of her brother's who were away. In all honesty, she may have been missing her two brothers, but she gained so many others. Waving to the group she runs over to greet her \"self-proclaimed\" favorites who appear to be locked into a conversation. Once she gets a little closer to Gerry and Julius she slows her pace noting another person with them. The female was slightly taller than her by about an inch, and was gorgeous! Blonde hair, green eyes, and a beauty mark just above her upper lip. \"Ah, sorry. Julius, this is Emma,\" Gerry introduces bringing Emma to his front. Dahlia smiles recognizing Emma to be the name of Gerry's girlfriend. Her smile slowly drops as she watches Emma's wide beautiful eyes slant into a sharp glare, and her lips form a disgusted scowl. Standing shocked amongst a crowd of people, Dahlia feels her heart clench as Emma walks away from Julius' outstretched hand with only a scoff and shake of the head. \"Camp over now, huh?\" Julius replies, dropping his hand dejectedly. \"Back to the real world, Bertier.\" \"This is what they're integrating us for?\" Julius asks glancing at all the protestin' and shoutin' surrounding them. \"We'd have been better off staying where we were,\" he concludes before walking away from Gerry. Dahlia remains rooted to her spot. She could literally see Julius rebuild the walls he only just managed to tear down. With just one little action, all the work they'd accomplished at camp… was gone. As Dahlia stood there, she failed to notice that Gerry had run to catch up with Emma, who just so happened to be heading in her direction. \"Doll?\" Hearing her name she snaps out of her thoughts to see Gerry in front of her. She smiles happy to see him, but it fades seeing the female next to him. Gerry notices this and feels his shoulder tense up slightly. \"Hey, Bertier,\" Dahlia greets softly with an almost sad smile. Gerry frowns noting the sad tone. \"Is this the Dahlia you speak so much of?\" Emma asks kindly. Dahlia's caught off guard at the softness that is now present in her face. This was a completely different person than who she just saw interacting with Julius, if you could even call that interacting. \"Yeah, this is her!\" Gerry laughs nervously, he silently prays that Dahlia would get along with his girlfriend. It was important to him for some reason to have his sister-figure approve of his girlfriend, and vice-versa. \"I'm Emma Hoyt, it's a pleasure to finally meet you!\" She greets pleasantly, holding out a hand towards her. Dahlia finds herself internally arguing over how to approach this situation. She had half a mind to just leave her hanging like she did to, Julius, but knew that wouldn't go well with Gerry. Gerry grits his teeth watching Dahlia remain still with little to no expression on her face. He could see Emma deflate a bit as her smile begins to drop. Then, as if she just realized someone was in front of her, a smile begins to slowly appear on Dahlia's face. If Gerry were to be completely honest though, it appeared a little bit strained. \"Oh,\" Dahlia marvels softly, \"so, you do know how to greet a person. I'm glad!\" She replies with a cheerful voice. Her response catches both Gerry and Emma off guard, but Dahlia is quick to grab the outstretched hand in greeting. \"Yeah, I'm Dahlia. Nice to see you were taught some manners,\" she happily chirps releasing Emma's hand after a tight squeeze, \"saw what you did to Julius, and worried you were raised with no respect.\" Emma blushes at the accusation and drops her gaze to the ground, embarrassed. She can see Gerry's face grow a bit red as well and knew he would definitely be upset with her later. \"Turns out you just don't know when to use it,\" Dahlia snickers as if the exchange were a secret amongst close friends. Emma opens her mouth to retort, but nothing comes out. \"Doll,\" Gerry warns not liking the way she was treating his girl, \"You're being rude.\" \"Don't worry, Gerry!\" Dahlia reassures him with a laugh, shifting the books in her arms around slightly. \"Emma and I'll get along just fine. We can learn all about manners and respect together,\" she quips, shooting Emma a friendly smile and wink, \"Right, Emma?\" The two are left speechless as the dark-haired female turns to leave with a light wave of her hand. \"You all right, sugar?\" Gerry asks glancing over at his girlfriend who was still in shock. Emma had never met a girl quite like Dahlia before, and she couldn't quite decide what to think of her yet. She was downright rude to her, but she had spunk. Gerry on the other hand couldn't decide whether he was angry with Dahlia, or just thankful she didn't dismiss Emma completely. \"So, did she not like me, or…\" She trails off unsure of the impression she left with the girl who spoke harsh words with a honey coated tongue. Gerry scratches his head trying to decide the same thing. Dahlia only smiled as she walked away from the pair deciding that she would definitely be getting along with, Emma. After all, her daddy always said, \"kill 'emwith kindness.\" So, that's just what she'd do. Please Fav/Review/Follow![Chapter 11] Hey everyone! This is a bit of a short update, and I'm sorry about that. Thank you for continuing to support my story. I'm slow to update, but as long as you don't give up on me, I'll return the favor. A Black and White Film: A Titans Documentary Chapter Eleven: I Want To Hold Your Hand \"This is it,\" Dahlia mumbles softly to herself. She grips her camera nervously, squinting against the bright lights that lit the field they'd be playing on tonight. The amount of energy in the air was practically electric. All the excitement, the competitiveness, the nerves. It all seemed so surreal. The high pitched calls coming from the cheerleaders and hearty shouts from the crowd, were merely muffled background noise to Dahlia as she continued to gaze out at the open field. She jumps when a heavy hand suddenly lands on her shoulder. \"You ready?\" Glancing back she's happy to see Coach Boone staring back at her. She quickly pulls a small notebook out of her pocket and writes— Game #1 T.C. Williams vs. Hayfield Flipping it closed and shoving it back in to her pocket, she nods and turns to follow Boone to the locker room. The silence that falls over the two catches Dahlia's attention. Boone was never this quiet. He always has something to say, always has a point to make. \"Everything peachy, Coach?\" She asks just loud enough to catch his attention over the crowd. Now that she got a good look at him she notes just how tense and pale he appears to be. In all honesty, he looked a little ill. Dahlia slowly comes to the realization that Coach Boone was nervous . \"You don't look too well,\" she observes placing a gentle hand on his arm, halting his steps. Boone glances back at her and sends a confident grin her way, which makes him look a little more like himself. \"Just a bit too much adrenaline running through me, that's it. Nothing a little football won't fix,\" he assures while placing his hand over hers. Dahlia smiles at this and takes one more longing look out at the field. \"Don't blame you, Coach. The pressure's on today,\" she admits, taking in the now overwhelming shouts from the crowd. \"I can only imagine what you're going through right now.\" This catches Boone's attention and he turns to stare at her questionably. Sensing this, Doll's quick to explain. \"The Titans are making their big debut today. The world is being introduced to not just them, but the idea of integration, of unity, of equality .\" Boone's stare slowly morphs into one of surprise at the young lady's mature words. Dahlia shakes her head causing her short ponytail to whip her cheeks, before turning back to face Boone, \"If I have learned anything from this past week of school, it's that we'll be facin' a lot of scrutiny out here today.\" The two stand there in silence for a few seconds, before Coach clears his throat and motions over his shoulder. \"Why don't you head on in and see the boys first,\" he suggests. Dahlia raises an eyebrow, but spares him her questions after realizing he already began to leave. She stares after his figure, a troubled expression on her face as she debated going after him or not. Ultimately she decides against it and turns to head into the locker rooms. \"Hope you're all decent!\" She calls out while bursting into the room happily. A few high pitched yelps came from some of the guys at her sudden appearance, which sends her into a fit of laughter. \"There you are, Doll!\" Gerry comments while stepping forward to hug the cheerful girl. A few of the guys are quick to follow his lead, and she's all too happy to hug them in return before glancing around to see if everyone was ready. \"Hey, anyone see Bosley?\" One of the guys call out catching the attention of all the players. Dahlia's eye widen as she quickly scans the room to look for the teams' blonde sweetheart (not to be confused with Ronnie, who was the teams' blonde \"dreamboat\"), but only grows concerned when she can't spot him. \"He isn't here yet?!\" Gerry's voice raises towards the end of his statement, hinting at the stress already beginning to fall on him. \"Did you happen to see him while you were coming in?\" Dahlia is quick to ease her expression into one of false peace in hopes of keeping their team's leader calm. It seems to work, but when she answers his question with a shake of her head, Gerry sighs and rubs the back of his neck. \"Maybe he's just running late?\" She suggests rubbing his arm in an attempt to soothe his nerves. The boys all seem a bit on edge, which made absolute sense to Dahlia. It had to be the pre-game jitters, her brothers would get them all the time back when they were in high school. \"Yeah, and I'm almost certain I know why he's late,\" Gerry nearly growls out catching Dahlia off guard. Commotion from the locker room entrance catch their interest and Dahlia sighs in relief as she sees a frantic Alan make his way in, vehemently yelling out apologies as he goes. \"Mind helping him get ready, Doll? Game's about to start soon and I need to gather the other guys up,\" Gerry asks causing the petite girl to nod and begin to walk in the direction Alan headed to. \"Wait—\" a hand grips her wrist causing her to stop and look back at Gerry, \"his father... He was late because of his father. I'm almost certain of it.\" Dahlia furrows her brows and clenches her jaw trying to reign back the sudden anger that consumes her. She didn't know exactly what Mr. Bosley could have been doing to make Alan so late, but she had a pretty good idea. \"That ain't no father,\" Dahlia denies causing Gerry's jaw to drop slightly before a surprised laugh escapes his mouth. Despite the fact that Gerry was often on the receiving end of Dahlia's spite (for valid reasons, of course), he still found it amusing whenever he witnessed it. \"Yeah, no kidding,\" he agrees before letting his grip on her go. The two exchange an understanding look, which causes Dahlia to smile at Gerry in response. \"No worries, I'll get him ready in time. Go round up your boys,\" she assures sending him a wink before walking away from him. Gerry shakes his head at her antics. When she reaches Alan, he doesn't seem notice her standing there and continues to throw things into his locker. She can see that his cheeks were splotchy, and wondered sadly if he had been crying. Whether he had been crying because he was hurt, or because he was angry, she couldn't tell. He was mumbling to himself quietly, but she couldn't catch exactly what he was saying no matter how much she strained to hear. Without warning, he suddenly rips off his shirt causing her to blush and glance away as he changes into his white under-armor. Alan was petite, thinner and shorter than most on his team, but that didn't mean he wasn't fit or attractive. Trying to compose herself, she catches sight of the bottom half of his Titan uniform laying on the bench and quickly begins to place his knee and thighs pads in place. She decided that if she could keep herself busy, she could distract herself from blushing so heavily. After a few seconds Alan turns to grab his pants only to jump when he finds Dahlia there holding it out for him. \"Doll!\" He shrieks in surprise causing the slightly shorter girl to smile cheekily back at him. \"Hi,\" she greets casually tossing the pants his way. He's quick to catch it and notices his pads are already in place. Glancing back to her he blushes heavily as she continues to eye him curiously. \"Uh—Hi— Can you, uhh —\" he struggles to finish his sentence, but the heavy blush and stutter is enough for Dahlia to catch a hint. His blush only tints darker as she sends him a teasing roll of the eyes before turning around to give him some privacy. Quickly changing out of his pants, he puts on his girdle and slips into his pants that Dahlia had prepped. Alan could barely believe the day he had. His father had cussed him out nearly all day. Lecturing him on and on about how much this game meant to him. Talking of how he needed to prove himself and not be shown up by the new members on the team. The crude comments he had made about some of his teammates caused Alan to lose his cool, and that only started a shouting match between the two. \"You done yet?\" Dahlia's soft voice snaps his attention away from tying his pants. He had nearly forgotten she was there. \"Uh yeah, sorry about that,\" he replies a bit sheepishly. Dahlia turns around and gives him a gentle smile, which calms him significantly. He didn't quite understand what it was about her, but he always felt better whenever she was around. \"You don't have to help me,\" Alan insists as Dahlia walks over with his shoulder pads in tow. \"I know… but I want to,\" Dahlia admits lifting the slightly heavy pads up and over his head. Alan stares at her while she buckles him in, his blush still in place. There's just something about having a pretty girl, especially one like Dahlia, helping him get dressed. It made his chest ache, but man, was it a good ache. With Dahlia's help, Alan manages to get dressed in under five minutes. The only thing left was to tie his shoes, which Dahlia is quick to help with once again. \"I was worried you weren't going to make it,\" Dahlia finally admits while she ties his right shoe tightly. Alan finds himself smiling at her finally catching sight of the fading blush on her own face. \"I almost didn't. My dad had a few words of encouragement for me before our first game,\" he admits, recalling the talk he had with her at camp. He felt a lot more comfortable with Dahlia now, almost as if that night back at camp was a turning point in their relationship. A small turn, but an important one none the less. He knew he was probably fooling himself, because why would a girl like Dahlia want someone like him? \"Encouragement, huh?\" She mocks before standing up and staring down at him. Alan simply gives her a shrug and a sort of forlorn smile that causes Dahlia's heart to clench. She gently places both hands on the sides of his face and runs her thumbs softly over his still splotchy cheeks. \"No offense, but I think your father and I have very different ideas of what encouragement is,\" she informs him with furrowed brows. Alan closes his eyes and hums in agreement, involuntarily leaning into her touch. This causes the corners of Dahlia's mouth to raise. \"I don't know what your father might have told you,\" Dahlia tells him with a stern face, \"but know that as long as you try your best out there tonight, me and the rest of the team will be proud of you, hun.\" Alan finds himself smiling giddily as he hears the endearing nickname slip out of her mouth. He and the other guys noticed that Dahlia had a habit of slipping out small pet names whenever she was talking about something she was passionate about. \"Thanks, Dahlia.\" Alan breathes out as she removes her hands from his face. The sound of her actual name slipping out of his mouth shocks her slightly, but she smiles widely, displaying the dimple that Alan found himself adoring more every time he saw it. She reaches out to grab his helmet and hands it to him. \"All right, everybody on your feet.\" Coach Boone's voice is heard from the other room causing both teens' eyes to widen. Pulling Alan up, Dahlia's quick to tug him into the next room to listen to Coach's pep-talk. Once they enter the main room, Dahlia finds herself standing between Alan, Lastik, and Blue. \"Listen up,\" Coach Boone announces as a hush falls over the anxious team. \"I'm not gonna talk to you tonight about… winnin' and losin'.\" Dahlia finds herself focusing on Boone a little too intensely. She couldn't figure out what it was about him, but he seemed a bit off. She didn't expect such a calm pep-talk to startup this game. \"You're already winners, 'cause you didn't kill each other up at camp.\" A few chuckles escape the boys, which causes Dahlia to smile and dismiss her suspicions. \"Tonight, we got Hayfield. Like all the other schools in this conference, they're all white. They don't have to worry about race. We do.\" He pauses and takes the time to glance at everyone around him, an appreciative expression on his face. \"But we're better for it, men.\" \"Nothin' tears us apart.\" Dahlia finds herself frowning at this statement. Deep down she knew that the team was still tight, but there has been conflict a brewing. She still remembers what happened between Gerry and Julius on the first day of school. Alan who had been listening intently to Coach Boone's speech, glances over to see Dahlia's troubled expression. Her brows were furrowed and she had a small pout that he found himself staring at a little too long. He hesitated slightly before reaching down to grab her hand gently. She seems to blink before looking up at him a bit surprised. Alan feels himself tense up and wonders if he had pushed things too far, but his mental-berating is put on hold as Dahlia squeezes his hand back with one of the gentlest smiles he has ever received. \"Greek mythology, the titans were greater, even than the gods. They ruled their universe with absolute power.\" Dahlia looks away from Alan and back towards Coach. She found herself impressed at the reasoning behind the team's name. \"Well, that football field out there tonight, that's our universe.\" Boone glances at everyone once more, \"Let's rule it like Titans.\" The room erupts in smiles and cheers as everyone begins to put on their helmets and run out. Dahlia releases her grip on Alan before gripping his shoulders. \"Remember, just do your best. That's all we expect.\" She offers his nervous figure before looking to the other boys and shouting a last, \"Good luck!\" Hope you all enjoyed it! ","Summary":" Hello! I've always loved this movie and have watched it WAY too many times to be healthy. Anyways I"},{"Movie":"Remember the Titans","Title":"Blurring Lines","Author":"mocasoul","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5641925","Passage":"[Chapter 1] It was the worst summer Reggie Morris picked to move his family from Manhattan, New York to Alexandria, Virginia his daughter, Regina, thought. It was 1971, the year of the really bad race wars because some white store owner shot a black teenager. If that wasn't bad enough, they decided to integrate the schools which was horrible for Regina, a black girl from the North not being able to understand why it took them so long. The first day of school was hell as her father pulled up a block away from the chaos going on from both blacks and whites. Yelling and screaming and picketing was the thing that welcomed her to her first day of school. \"Great…Not only did you pull me out of my school my senior year for a move I didn't even want, you move to a place that's currently having a race riot. Lovely.\" \"Don't give me that attitude, Regina. You know I had to take this job, and it forced me to move here. I'm sorry you have to leave your friends and everything you love in New York, but you know I had to take this job. I'm sorry, sweet pea.\" he said with an apologetic face as she rolled her eyes. \"Now go ahead and make the best of your first day.\" \"Okay, daddy. I'll try not to die today when these crazy crackers try to kill me.\" she said with an overly cheerful and sarcastic smile as she got out of car and closed the door. \"Watch it, Regina. I'm serious. Watch the attitude. Now, try to have a decent day today at school. And don't flip out on anyone. Bye, sweet pea.\" he said before he drove off. She walked towards the front of the building following the other black students in. She tried to obey her father and control her attitude, which meant her temper, and ignore the many white hands pulling at her and the voices shouting that she shouldn't be here. Everything was mixed up that day because of the craziness and the new additions to the school, and it took her a while to find her classes on her own because there was no way she was asking a white secretary to help because she knew she would lose it, then. She settled into a seat near the window in her English class watching the chaos continue. She was amazed it was still going on and it was the third period. In her class there was a clear line of separation of races. The whites occupied the seats in the front and the only choices for the blacks was the back seats. She knew they had done that on purpose, but she wasn't the type to sit in the front of the class anyway. The only white person sitting in the back was a blonde haired boy sitting beside her. \"Alright class,\" said a young woman with red hair standing at the front of the class. \"I am your English Literature teacher, Ms. Sterling, and I would like to welcome you to the wonderful world of English Literature.\" she said trying to ignore the noise outside. \"Let's start by turning in your book to an incredible piece, Hamlet .\" she said in a cheery voice and Regina felt like she would vomit. She was clearly from the north like her, but she seemed like she had been there a while and had grown accustomed to life in the South. \"Excuse me…\" said a clean cut boy sitting next to her in a quiet voice as the teacher began reading. \"My pencil fell and rolled under your desk. It's right by your foot.\" he said as she looked down and saw his pencil. She picked it up and handed it to him. \"Thanks.\" he said with a smile as he stared at her. She was about to give him one of her 'what the hell are you looking at?' looks when she noticed his blue eyes. They were an almost jewel tone blue…not as deep as a sapphire, but not as light as blue topaz either. But that wasn't the part that was bothering her. She was thrown off by the way he was staring at her. It was almost as if he was attracted to her, but that couldn't have been the case because she was black and he was white and all that yelling and screaming going on outside wasn't for nothing. \"Now,\" Ms. Sterling began. \"Who can tell me what 'To be or not to be' means?\" she said as Regina raised her hand to answer. \"It was a line meant to question whether to live or die. It also speaks of the fleeting nature of time.\" she said as everyone looked at her. Even the pair of jewel tone blue eyes. \"That is correct.\" Ms. Sterling said with a smile. \"That's very good…\" Ms. Sterling said as she paused to learn her name. \"Regina Morris.\" she said trying to avoid the many pairs of eyes on her. \"Is that a Northern accent I hear?\" Ms. Sterling asked with a smile and bright eyes. \"Yes, I'm from New York.\" she said wondering why Ms. Sterling kept talking to her. \"That's lovely. Okay, now, we'll discuss the fight scene…\" she trailed off as she continued the lecture. The riot outside the school still haven't stopped and she was starting to miss her old school more and more with her friends. Suddenly the bell rang for lunch as people left the classroom. \"Regina?\" Ms. Sterling began. \"I can tell you're going to be a joy to have in this class, and it's nice to know that I'm not the only Yankee here.\" \"It is. Okay, bye.\" she said as she left the classroom and walked down the hall. She still heard the noise outside wondering how long it was going to last. \"Excuse me…\"someone said coming up to her as she stood at her locker. She turned around to see the cute clean cut boy with jewel tone blue eyes staring at her. \"Regina, right?\" \"Yeah…\" she said knowing she sounded guarded, but she didn't know what to expect. \"I'm Alan. Alan Bosley. I sat next to you in English. Well, I…\" he was saying until a goofy looking black guy came up behind him and slapped him on the back. She thought for sure that there was going to be a fight until the two boys started laughing. \"Hey, Petey.\" \"Hey, Alan. Now, who is this pretty thing here?\" he said as he stared at her as Alan elbowed him with an embarrassed look on his face. \"I'm Regina Morris and I'm out of your league…\" she said as she walked away. She heard a group of white and black guys laughing at the, now shamed, goofy looking boy. She went into the lunch room and saw people still being separated and she didn't know where she would fit in because she was new and didn't know anyone whether they were black or white. She figured she would join the crowd and sit at a table full of blacks. She was walking over to the table when she noticed a table full of white and black guys. She saw Alan sitting at the table laughing and joking with the goofy looking guy and a big white guy. She thought she was seeing things, but she could've sworn she saw him wave her over to them. She walked over and stood with her tray wondering what was going on. \"Guys, this is Regina. She moved here from New York. Make her feel welcome.\" he said as a long haired guy stood up and offered her his seat at the table. \"Regina, this is Lewis, Petey, Sunshine, Rev…\" he said but was stopped by her speaking. \"Hi…\" she said awkwardly. \"Nice to meet you guys…\" \"We're the Titans.\" he said and she finally realized that they were football players. She had forgotten that along with the school, the sports teams and any other clubs were also. \"I figured you would want someone to sit with since you're new.\" \"Thanks.\" she said as she ate her lunch. She was mostly quiet and was surprised by the warm welcome, but she still felt awkward. She was the only girl at the table so she let the guys talk and joke with each other while she, secretly, stared at Alan. She had to admit he was cute for a white boy. Maybe the school year wasn't going to be that bad. Yeah right, she thought.[Chapter 2] By the end second week, the chaos had died down a bit and Regina was settling in to her new life. She had never returned to the Titan table, but she did sit near it. She had made friends with a girl she took home economics with, so she was sitting with her at lunch. She was glad that the table was near the Titans so she could stare at Alan often. She wasn't normally shy, but the thought of talking to a white guy in a racially split town wasn't a good idea. \"Hey, Regina.\" said Bernice, the girl she befriended as she sat down at the table with her. \"What cake were you gonna make for home ec?\" \"I don't know…I really don't bake. Hell, no one in my family bakes. Not even my mom. That was the great thing about having bakeries down the street from where I lived.\" she said with a laugh. \"I guess I'll just find something easy.\" \"Well, I know I'm making my grandma's coconut cake. I'll lend you some recipes if you can't find anything. I know my family got a bunch of 'em.\" \"Thanks.\" Regina said as she began to eat her lunch. She looked around the room and saw the school was still as divided as the first day. \"Do you think this school will ever come together. I mean, look around this room.\" \"I know you from the North and all, but you know that ain't never happening. It's the way it's been and it's going to stay that way.\" \"I know…can't blame me for trying.\" she said with a shrug. \"And it was separated and stuff in New York, but things weren't this bad. I mean there's some hope, right?\" she said as she stared at Alan. He saw her and waved with a big smile on his face. Bernice turned around to see why her new friend was suddenly smiling and saw a guy with an equally big smile. \"Is this about this school integrating or are you trying to get closer to a certain white Titan who goes by the name of Alan Bosley?\" \"Why would you say that? And stop talking so loud…he could hear you.\" \"Uh huh…you got a thing for him alright. You know that's never going to happen, right? I'm not trying to put you down, but you got to be a little realistic about this. I mean, his dad is known for not liking our kind too much.\" \"What?!\" Regina said in genuine shock. \"But, Alan is so…friendly with blacks. That can't be right.\" she said as she stared at him joking with his teammates. \"I don't know…maybe over the summer the guys bonded and they're thinking a little ahead than the rest of us. I mean, they did have to go up there together and I heard that Coach Boone made blacks and whites stay in the same rooms. Maybe he is different…\" she said as the bell rang and people were leaving the cafeteria. \"Hey, Regina?\" Alan said as he tapped her shoulder as they walked out together. \"How do you think you did on the first quiz?\" \"I don't know…good I guess. How about you?\" \"Oh, I know I failed it. English just isn't my thing. It never has been.\" \"Well, English is surprisingly easy for me. I don't know why.\" \"Well, maybe you can tutor me.\" he blurted out and she looked at him strange. \"See, I kind of need to keep my grades up to stay on the team and…\" \"Right…\" she said knowing that it was something behind his cordial conversation after about two weeks of not talking to her besides saying hello. \"I'm not doing your homework for you, Alan.\" she said before turning to walk away, but he stopped her. \"I didn't say you were doing my homework, I just wanted some help. Please.\" he begged with a puppy dog look on his face. The expression on his face was so cute, she swore she would kiss him, but she stopped her urge by thinking about what Bernice said about his dad. \"Okay, fine…I'll help you.\" she said, reluctantly, agreeing to help him. \"I guess I could use my expertise in English to help those who aren't as lucky.\" \"That being me.\" Alan said with a sheepish grin. \"Yes. So, I'll torture you, Alan.\" she said with a smile. \"Thanks.\" he said with a smile before walking into his next class. She rushed to her class at the end of the hall before the tardy bell rang. She sat in class thinking about Alan's smile. Maybe it was just a one-sided crush, she thought. Even if it was, she would try to be his friend because she was now, curious as to why a boy with a father that is known to hate blacks can get along with them so well. \"Okay everyone, you will be partnering up today with the person sitting next to you. So, everyone partner up.\" said her biology teacher. She was sitting next to a blonde haired girl who was less than enthusiastic about partnering up with a black girl. \"Mr. Bearer., I would like another partner.\" the girl said as she sneered at Regina. \"Brittany, there's an even number in the class and everyone has a partner already.\" the teacher said with a sympathetic look towards the blonde haired girl as if he was sorry she had to be partnered up with a black girl. Regina almost lost her temper, but she remember what her dad said and swallowed her anger. \"Okay, class, you will be looking at the cell of a potato root at different stages. Tell which stage your slide is and why. Take turns looking at the slide. You may begin.\" \"I'll go first.\" the blonde girl said and Regina, begrudgingly, let her. She figured it was a small fight that she didn't need to get in that day. They got through the assignment by not really talking to each other. She still couldn't believe that after almost two weeks, people were still trying to fight the integration. She wasn't expecting for blacks and whites to hug each other and be friendly. She wasn't that stupid. She was just hoping they would at least settle to civil terms. The bell for class to end rang, and Regina walked down the hall to her locker. She was happy that it was the last class of the day, because she knew she couldn't stay calm after her biology class. That girl had tested her limit for the day, and she knew she would snap. She felt someone tap her on the shoulder and she turned around to see Alan standing behind her. \"Hey, Regina. I was wonder if…Well, I…\" he said struggling to get out the words. \"Yes, Alan?\" she said as she stared at him. She couldn't stop staring at his dreamy blue eyes as they seemed to be fixated on her full lips. But, that could just be her own eyes playing tricks with her mind. She had pushed all thought of him actually being attracted to her out of her mind the moment she learned about his dad. \"I was just going to ask you to meet me at the library tomorrow at two. That's if you're not busy on Saturdays. If so, we can meet some other time.\" \"I'm not busy on Saturdays. I really haven't found anything to do here that would catch my attention…\" she said with the same sheepish grin he wore, earlier. \"So, see you tomorrow?\" \"Absolutely. Although, you know some Saturdays I can't make it because of the away games. Sorry about that.\" he said with an apologetic face. \"It's okay. So, I'll see you tomorrow, then. Goodbye.\" she said with a smile before walking off wondering if he, indeed, did like her.[Chapter 3] Regina sat in the library waiting for Alan to show up. She figured she would go there early to see the books they had there. She saw a lot of Jane Austen books she had read a dozen times, but wanted to read again. Of course the librarian looked at Regina strangely as she walked down the aisles. Regina rolled her eyes as when she caught the gray-haired woman staring at her with a suspicious look while she pretended to straighten up books on the shelf. \"Hey Regina.\" Alan whispered as he walked up to her and the librarian almost dropped the book she was holding as she saw him talking to Regina. \"Hi. Alan, I know you wanted to study here, but can we go somewhere else?\" she said nodding towards the nosy librarian, but he wasn't getting the hint. \"Um…sure. Where do you want to go?\" he said as they started walking to the doors. \"I don't know. Do you know a place that's quiet, yet comfortable? I still don't know this place all that well, and I don't want to get lost.\" \"How comfortable are you with studying outdoors?\" he asked with a smile. \"Outdoors? Like woods and forest and stuff? Uh…I guess. Yeah, okay.\" she said wondering if she should go with him to secluded forest with no one around. She was starting to wonder if his nice guy to blacks thing was an act. \"Great. I'll drive you.\" he said as they walked to his car. He opened the passenger side for her as she climbed in placing her books on the floor. He got in and started the car. She almost cringed hearing a country music station on the radio. She felt like she was in hell, listening to what she considered torture. \"You don't like country, do you?\" he asked after about ten minutes of no talking between them. \"No…I'm sorry if I'm not sparing your feelings, but I can't stand it. I'd rather walk on glass.\" she said and he let out a boisterous laugh. \"Okay, I'll change it.\" he said as he changed it to a soul station and left it there. She thought he was just keeping it there to please her and she would have to sit there in guilt for making him change his music to suit her needs. But, that changed when she saw him nodding his head a little. She stared at him in shock. \"What?\" he said as he noticed her stare. \"You like soul music?\" she asked in disbelief as he nodded. \"Okay, how did you get into soul music. I have to know, because you don't look like the type to dig it.\" \"Well, the guys at camp got me into it. I still listen to country, but I listen to soul every now and then.\" he said as he stopped the car and she saw that they had stopped near a small pond. \"We're studying here?\" she asked with caution in her tone. \"Yeah. It's quiet and comfortable. I come here all the time to think, so I figured we could come here to study since we have to think. We can stay in the car, we don't have to get out unless you wanted to get to know nature.\" he joked. \"We could stay in the car…today.\" she said as she bent down and picked up her copy of The Raven . \"Okay, this is one of my favorites by Poe.\" \"I started reading it, and I have to be honest…I hated it.\" \"Well, Poe isn't for everyone. Why do you hate it?\" she asked feeling genuinely curious. \"I don't know…I don't get why he's talking to a bird.\" \"The bird isn't a literal bird. Ravens are symbolic for death and sadness. The guy is asking the bird, and that could also be his conscious, about his future with his lost loved one and the response nevermore, could be the realization that his lover is dead. Do you understand?\" \"Yeah…I'm starting to.\" he said as he stared at her. \"Good. Now, personally, I think this is Poe's way of getting us to fully realize the presence of death. No matter how invincible we think we are…death awaits us all. What do you think?\" she asked not realizing that she was going over his head. He gave a look and she let out an embarrassed chuckle. \"Sorry. I sort of get caught up sometimes. We'll take it slow.\" \"You really love English, don't you?\" he asked in amazement that she would love it so much. She nodded and let out a chuckle. \"What?\" \"I found out why I love it so much. I used to read all the time when I was younger. I was my comfort, I guess. My dad told me that my first word was book, but I think he's lying about that. How about you? Why do you play football? What's the attraction to it?\" \"Well, my dad got me to play football. He said that I loved it since the day I saw one of my cousins playing it. I think he was lying about that, too.\" he said with a chuckle. \"I love the feeling of winning and the rush I feel when ever I play.\" \"It sounds a lot more fun and losing yourself in a book like I do.\" she joked and they both laughed. As the laughter died down, she couldn't stop staring at his blue eyes. Moving her gaze lower to his lips. His bottom lip looked delicious enough to suckle. \"Is everything alright?\" Alan asked after a few moments of silence. She didn't know how long the moments were, but they were long enough for him to notice. \"Yeah…so, lets move on to another work from Poe.\" she said as she stared down at the book with a collection of his works. Hours later they were ready to leave. They had covered the three works they were required to read for class Monday, so they decided to leave. They made small talk about how much she was adjusting to the South. She even made a joke that spending the day in nature wasn't as bad as she thought it was…even if her day was spent from the inside of a car. They listened to soul music as he drove back to the library. \"You can just drop me off here. I'll just walk home. It's not far.\" she said as he drove stopped in the parking lot of the library. \"I'll take you home, if you want. It's pretty dark out.\" \"Alan, I know you're trying to be nice and all, but I walked all the time in New York. This is nothing compared to the distance I used to walk…in much more dangerous looking neighborhoods than this. I'll be fine.\" \"Are you sure you're okay to walk by yourself. Maybe I could go with you.\" \"I don't think that's a good idea, but thanks anyway. Well, I'll see you in class Monday. Goodbye.\" she said as she got out of his car and started walking towards her house. She knew her dad didn't care that he was white, but she knew Alan's dad would care that she was black. Hell, she figured them talking in the library probably got back to him. She reached her house and went inside finding her dad on the couch watching TV. \"How did the study session go, sweet pea?\" Reggie asked as she sat down next to him. She had been spending a lot of time with him lately since she barely saw her mom because of her late nights working at the hospital as a nurse. \"It was okay. We went through a few of Poe's pieces for the discussion we're having Monday. Nothing much beyond that. He didn't like The Raven much.\" \"And I know you lectured him on why he should like it, didn't you?\" \"You know me so well, dad…\" she said as she leaned against him. \"I'm going to bed. Goodnight.\" she said as she went to her room.[Chapter 4] The following week, Regina was starting to notice that Alan was talking to her more. He would hold little conversations with her in the hallway in between classes, during lunch, and at the end of the school day. It was getting so obvious that they just wanted to be around only each other, she and Bernice moved to the Titan table to mask it. The thing she wasn't expecting was for him to ask her to come with him to a party Blue was having after the game. They dedicated it to Rev who had been injured in the game. The party was a mixture of people. Blacks and whites dancing and having a good time. Regina was happy that the first party she went to in her new town was a good one. She had to stop herself from laughing whenever she saw Alan dance. She would never tell him, but she was cringing at how bad he was off rhythm when the Titans warmed up with soul. She swore to herself that she would fix that. \"Are you having fun, Regina?\" Alan asked her as they danced. \"Hell yeah, I'm having fun. I haven't been to a party like this in a long time. Thank you.\" \"No problem.\" he said a he continued dancing and Regina couldn't hold in her laughter any longer. She didn't know what he did to make her laugh, but she did. \"What?\" \"Nothing…\" she said as she tried to stifle her laugh and continue dancing. \"It's my dancing, isn't it.\" he said with a laugh as he danced more and she simply nodded. \"I'm sorry…I'm not laughing at you. I'm laughing with you.\" \"Yeah…sure…\" he said as he laughed. \"That statement would be a lot more convincing if I was actually laughing.\" he said as he stared at her. \"You're not that bad, actually. At least you're not as bad a Gerry.\" she said looking over at Julius trying to teach Gerry to dance. He was horribly off rhythm. \"You have a little rhythm. It's white boy rhythm, but you have rhythm.\" \"Thanks, I feel a lot better after that.\" he said sarcastically as he danced and she just laughed. He was cute in his half-way rhythm less way. The song changed to a slow song and Alan and Regina stood there awkwardly not sure of what to do. They were seeing people pair up, and neither of them were interracial. Just then, they saw Sunshine dance with a black girl and she took that as a sign. There was no way he could get out of dancing with her to that song, now. \"We could still dance if you want…\" she said as she stared at him. \"Okay…\" he said as he wrapped his arms around her waist and she wrapped her hands around the back of his neck. They sway to the music feeling eyes on them, and she knew people were staring at Ronnie and the girl he was dancing with also. \"So, how am I, now?\" \"You're actually a better slow dancer.\" she said loving the way he was holding her. He knew how to hold a girl tight without squeezing the air out of her. She saw the size of his arms and saw the average size biceps. He wasn't as big as Julius or Gerry or any of the other guys on the team. In fact, she was wondering how a skinny guy like him made the team in the first place. He seemed to be interest in football, true, but he didn't quite fit right in the sport. \"Thanks\" he said with a smile. Her eyes traveled over his face stopping at his wonderful blue eyes, then to his lips. She wondered if he felt the same way about her features. She started to wonder if he admired her big lips, her brown eyes…her brown skin. \"You know I don't have to tell you want a great dancer you are.\" \"I know…\" she said in smug tone knowing that she was a lot better than him. Her gaze moved to his neck and her arm, and she noticed the difference in their skin complexions. The paleness of his skin was intensified in contrast with her brown skin and she began to wonder if she was making a mistake in pursuing a relationship with him. His father hated blacks and she knew he would kill him if he found out his son was friendly towards blacks and, more importantly, a black girl. \"Regina, are you okay? You stopped dancing. Are you sure I'm not that bad?\" \"Yeah…I'm sure. Sorry, I kind of blanked out for a minute.\" \"What's wrong?\" he said with a concerned look on his face. She looked down to the floor as she pulled away from him. \"Regina?\" he said in confusion. \"I can't do this, Alan…\" she said as she went through the crowd of people as the music changed and he went after her. She stopped on the front porch and sat down on the steps. She tried to stop herself from crying. She swore to herself that she would never cry over him. \"Regina, what's wrong? Talk to me…\" he said as he stood behind her, but she wouldn't look at him. She couldn't turn around and see the white face she was falling for not knowing if he felt the same way because she wasn't as white as he was. \"Regina…\" he said as he sat down next to her. She turned her head away from him. \"I like you, Alan…a lot. I know being your girlfriend wouldn't please your dad too much, and I wouldn't mind being your secret girlfriend…that is…if you felt the same way.\" \"I do. I've been thinking the exact same thing. I know my dad would kill me if he found out about you, but that's his problem. I know we're different, but we can make this work.\" \"Alan…there's no easy way to say this, and I still have that Yankee bluntness in me, so here goes. You're white, and I'm black. The only thing that's starting to bring people together is football, but they still wouldn't like the idea of you and me dating. Their stomachs would turn at the thought of you and I kissing.\" \"You want to kiss me?\" he said, jokingly, and she knew he was trying to lighten the mood. \"I'm serious, Alan. And, yes, I do want to kiss you, but that's not the point.\" she said staring at his lips as the twisted into a grin. \"Can you honestly tell me you're ready for that?\" \"Regina, I don't care if my dad murders me for talking to you. I still want to date you. You're smart and pretty and interesting and funny…\" \"Okay, I get it. Listen, I'm not going to pretend to not be offended if you want to hide me from your dad, but I understand. I know you're not ashamed of liking me…are you?\" \"No. Are you ashamed of liking me?\" he said as he looked at her. \"Nope. I like who I like and I don't apologize for it.\" \"So, your dad won't have a problem with us dating?\" \"I would be lying if I said he was going to be completely okay with this, but it wouldn't bother him that much…at least, I hope not. I've never tested that limit.\" she said with a chuckle. \"Well, we'll just have to find out, won't we?\" he said as he wrapped an arm around her. She leaned in and planted and soft kiss on his lips. She was so unsure in her kiss, but she had to test the water. She had to see what would happen if she kissed him. Pulling back, she waited for a response. \"Wow…\" he said with a strange look on his face. \"What that a good wow or a bad wow?\" she asked not wanting to know the answer. \"What do you think?\" he said as he leaned in a kissed her back. The force behind his kiss was enough to make her weak in the knees. She was glad she was already sitting down. \"I think you're a better kisser than you are a dancer.\" she said with a playful smirk as they laughed. \"Let's get back inside.\" she said and they went inside and enjoyed the rest of the party.[Chapter 5] A week later, Regina and Alan was sitting in his car studying by the pond. It felt a little different, but it was in a good way. Alan was her boyfriend and she was his girlfriend. She had refused to let the fact that they had to hide it to protect themselves ruin her moment. \"Regina…\" Alan said as he place the book face down on his lap. \"Let's take a break. I feel like my head is going to explode.\" \"Okay…we'll take a break.\" she said playfully rolling her eyes as she placed her book down also. \"You're getting better at this. Pretty soon, I won't even have to tutor you.\" \"But, that wouldn't give me an excuse to see you and do this.\" he said as he kissed her. Regina felt herself melt when his lips came in contact with hers. \"Alan…\" she said as she pulled away from him. He looked confused, but she just simply smiled. \"As much as I want to spend all my time kissing you right now, we have a big paper coming up and…\" she said but paused when she saw a pink tongue dart out of his mouth and, quickly, licked his bottom lip. She knew the action wasn't done on purpose, but as she saw that, she knew she had to kiss him. \"Forget it…\" she said as she leaned over and kissed him. \"Whoa…\" Alan said as he pulled back from the kiss after what seemed like minutes. \"What about the paper?\" he said as he laughed. \"Oh no…don't turn this on me. You're the one that wanted to take a break…\" she teased. \"Ooh, I love this song!\" she said as she turned up the radio to hear Stevie Wonder's \"If You Really Love Me\". She turns towards the door and grabbed the door handle. \"Wait, where are you going?\" he asked as he watched her get out. \"Dancing.\" she simply said as he went to the front of the car and started dancing. She watched him follow her after he turned the volume up. He was getting better at dancing, and she thought he was very cute. However, something was bothering her. The weather was still very much summer and very hot and Alan was wearing a jacket. She knew he must have been sweating bullets in that jacket if she had to wear a halter top and hot pants. \"Why are you staring at me like that?\" Alan asked with an uncertain look on his face as the song changed. \"You're staring at me like you want to ask me something.\" \"I'm trying to figure out why you're wearing that jacket. It's like an oven out here.\" \"Ah…It's not that bad.\" he said and she gave him a skeptical look. \"What?\" \"Not that bad?!\" she said with a laugh. \"Look at what I'm wearing.\" she said as she gestured to herself. \"I'm sweating…even in this.\" \"Really? I couldn't tell because I can't stop staring at those beautiful legs of yours in those shorts. Excuse me…hot pants.\" \"Ha, ha…\" she said as she stared at him with her hands on her hips. \"There is nothing wrong with hot pants\" she said as she walked up closer to him. \"But, seriously, aren't you hot in this?\" she said as she grabbed his jacket by the collar and pulled down and she almost gasped when she saw bruises on his shoulder. \"Oh my god, what happened, Alan?\" \"Nothing. I got in a fight with a couple of guys…it's nothing.\" \"A fight? When? With who?\" she said as she tugged at his jacket, but he pushed her hand away. \"Alan, talk to me. If your getting hurt because of me…\" she trailed off. \"It's not about you. Look, I told you it was nothing.\" \"This isn't nothing. You have bruises on you. That isn't nothing, Alan.\" she said as she yanked his jacket off and pointed to his bruises. \"What's going on?\" \"Look…I got in a fight with my old man. Ever since coach Yoast pulled me off and put Petey in…he's been angry with me.\" \"So, this fight got…physical?\" she said as she saw him nod his head. \"He said I was stupid for allowing someone like Petey…someone black to take my spot. He was talking about moving me to a different school, and I don't want to move to a different school. I don't want to leave you, my friends, or T.C. Williams.\" \"Alan, maybe we should rethink us dating. Your dad would kill you if he found out about us. I like you and all, but I don't want you to die if…\" \"Regina, my dad doesn't run my life. I like you and if I want to date you…\" \"Don't be ridiculous, Alan. I'm not worth this trouble. Look at what happened to you when he's mad about the whole football thing. Imagine what he'll do when he finds out about you being friends with your black teammates and even worse…dating me.\" \"I told you I didn't care. I know we have to hide this, but I'm not going to let it completely stop me from seeing you.\" \"That's all nice and all, but you're not listening to me. Your fascination with me is not worth ending your relationship with your father.\" \"What do you mean by fascination, Regina? I really like you. Where is this coming from? I thought you knew that I liked you.\" \"I know, I know…I'm just making sure. I'm just making sure you're not risking a very important relationship for one you're not completely sure about. I mean, are you, really? I'm not going to lie, I'm not really sure if this is worth it. I hate hiding that I like you and that you're my friend and that you're funny and silly and…someone I care about.\" \"Okay…I'm having doubts, too. But, maybe one day, you and I could date and hang out and dance without anymore giving us a second look.\" \"Yes, one day, but it's not that day. We should break up…\" \"I don't want to break up with you. Hell, we've only been a couple for a week, Regina. Let's just at least give this some time. I know you see people starting to come together. Look at how much people have changed already. Just think of how good it would be in a month.\" he said as Regina rolled her eyes. She wanted to believe him that everything would okay, but she knew it wouldn't. She knew that no matter how long it took, people were never going to see them for them. They would see the color of their skin first. \"People came together over football. Not a relationship, Alan. Look, we should probably get back to studying.\" Regina said started walking back towards the car, but Alan stopped her. \"I don't care what other people think. I believe everyone will come together one day.\" \"The only reason you guys came together was because of football, Alan. \"True, but…that's just a sports thing. Like you and Emma, Gerry's girlfriend, could talk tonight …\" he trailed off with a look that made Regina suspicious. \"What do you mean we could talk? Did you set me up to hang out with her?!\" \"Sort of. Couch Yoast was having a birthday party for Sheryl and some of them wanted to bring their girlfriends. I want you to come. \"Alan…\" she said wanting to protest and tell him no. But, she took one look into those jewel toned blue eyes and her wall broke down. \"Fine, I'll go. Now, let's get back to studying.\" \"What if I'm not finished with the break.\" he said as he kissed her. \"Alan. Study. Now.\" she said as she laughed at Alan's feigned pout as they walked back to the car. Though Regina was smiling, she wasn't looking forward to the birthday party.[Chapter 6] \"Happy Birthday, Sheryl.\" Regina said to the little blonde girl who had turned 10 that day. She was trying hard not to feel uncomfortable as she sat there being the only black girl there. She knew, by now, most of the white Titans knew she and Alan were an item, but there were still stares in her direction and she could hear the whispers from the other party goers. She swore she was going to kill Alan for this humiliation. Maybe, she thought, that's what he wanted to do. Humiliate her. She didn't want to admit this to him, but a part of her still believed there was malicious intent behind his actions. \"Thank you.\" the girl said as she stared at Alan's hand holding hers. Thankfully, the girl was called over by her mother as Regina later learned. \"Alan, what is this? I'm the only black girl here and I don't see any of your black teammates here. I want to leave…now.\" \"Regina, I didn't know you were going to be the only…I thought the other guys were coming, too.\" Alan said with an apologetic face. \"Let's just go, okay? I can't stand being stared at like an animal in the zoo.\" \"That's what you are…\" she heard a boy say to her and she just closed her eyes and breathed. She had to stop the urge to hit him. She knew it was going to be difficult because she could already feel her hands balling up into fists. \"You got a problem with my girlfriend, Jacob?\" Alan said to the boy as he got in his face. \"Yeah, I do…\" Jacob said as he stood toe to toe with Alan. \"Alan, let's just go…\" Regina said as she tugged on his arm. \"Hey!\" Coach Yoast said breaking the two boys apart. \"Jacob, I think you head home.\" \"Fine…\" Jacob said before he stormed off making sure he bumped Alan's shoulder on the way out. Alan was about to chase after him, but Regina stopped him. Suddenly, the music was changed by Coach Yoast's ex-wife. It was \"Black Magic Woman\" by Santana and everyone started dancing and forgot about the fight that was about to happen between Alan and Jacob. \"Are you two okay?\" Coast Yoast asked and they nodded. \"Try to enjoy the party.\" he said as he gave a pat on Alan's back before he left. \"You didn't have to get into a fight over me…\" Regina said as she rolled her eyes. She felt guilty about accusing him of wanting to humiliate her. \"Yes, I do. I feel bad for bringing you here. If I had known…\" \"It's okay. Let's try to enjoy the party as much as we can.\" she said as she rubbed his shoulder and he winced. \"Sorry…I forgot.\" she said referring to the bruises his father put there. \"Who is this? It's sounds kinda weird, but I think I can dig it.\" \"I've already dug it.\" Regina said as she started dancing. \"You like rock?\" Alan said in a shocked tone. \"You like soul?\" Regina said as she mocked his shocked tone. \"Okay…you got me. Hey, look, Petey and Blue are here.\" he said as he pointed to them walking through the door and Regina felt some relief, but it annoyed her that he had to point out that there were other black people at the party to make her feel comfortable. \"You didn't have to point that out to me, Alan.\" \"Don't get upset with me. I was just showing that there were more…you know. I'm sorry if I upset you…\" he trailed off and she felt bad for getting angry. \"It's okay…Oh, there's Emma and Gerry…Should we go over there?\" Regina asked Alan as she stared at them. Emma wasn't on the same page as Gerry when it came to accepting the change and, to make things worse, Ray Budds wasn't Regina's biggest fan and he was with them. \"Yeah…\" Alan said as they walked over to Gerry, Emma, and Ray. As soon as Emma saw Regina walking towards them with Alan holding onto her hand, she regarded them with caution and slight disgust. Ray didn't even hide his hatred for Regina in his expression. \"Hey, Alan. Regina.\" Gerry said with that welcoming smile as addressed them. Something in his eyes told Regina that he would have to apologize for Emma and Ray. \"Hey. Looks like Sheryl's getting bigger everyday. Where's Julius?\" Alan asked before he could think. Mentioning Julius around Ray and Emma was such a touchy thing since Gerry, himself, chose the team over his friendship with Ray. Even now, you can tell the tension between the two boys was thick, but for the sake of the party they were civil. \"I don't know…\" Gerry said as he looked around the room. \"He said he was coming. He probably haven't made it yet. Rev is somewhere around here. Oh, Regina, this is Emma, my girlfriend. Emma, this is Regina. She's from New York.\" \"Nice to meet you, Emma.\" Regina said as she extended her hand and, reluctantly, Emma accepted it. After pulling her hand out of Regina's grasp, she wiped it on the skirt of her dress and that angered Regina to no end, but she let it go and decided to kill the girl with kindness. \"I like your dress. It's very pretty.\" Regina said feeling as if she was forcing herself to be nice to this racist girl. She knew Alan was trying to do a good thing, but it wasn't going to work. Emma and Regina were never going to be friends. \"Thank you…\" Emma said bitterly before Gerry nudged her and she plastered on a fake smile with a hint of a devious look in her eyes. \"So, you and Alan are…together?\" \"Yes, we are.\" Regina said boldly as she squeezed his hand tighter. She was feeling herself lose her patience as Emma stared at them with disgust. \"Oh…\" she trailed off before turning to Alan. \"What does your dad think, Alan?\" \"Emma…\" Gerry said in a warning tone. He was visibly embarrassed. \"You have a problem with my girlfriend, Emma?\" \"Yes, I do. And so does everyone else at this party, in fact, this town. You think you can just up and date someone like her because the schools are combined and…\" \"Emma!\" Gerry shouted and a few people looked their way. \"Enough.\" \"No, Gerry. I told you that night that you had your priorities mixed up. Just seeing you with Julius is, is…I just don't like it.\" \"Emma…that's my friend…\" Gerry said with a hint of hurt in his tone. \"I'm your friend, Gerry!\" Ray snapped. \"Ever since that black son of a bitch…\" \"Excuse you?!\" Regina said as she got into Ray's face and Alan tried to pull her away. \"Oh look, Alan's little chocolate drop. You fighting your boyfriend's battles now. Why don't you just run along and go back to your cage…monkey.\" \"You think the pitiful attempt to insult me will make me back down? You have another thing coming, Ray. I'm not afraid of you or anyone else like you…\" \"Come on, Regina…\" Alan said as they walked away. Gerry looked at them with an apologetic face as they went up to Coach Yoast and Sheryl. \"We're going to head out. Just wanted to give Sheryl a last happy birthday before we left.\" he said and saw the look on Coach Yoast's face. Alan turned his head around and Regina noticed Alan's face turned pale. She turned her head to see an angry man storming towards them…It was Alan's dad.[Chapter 7] There Regina stood face to face with the infamous Fred Bosley. He looked in disgust as he stared down at them holding hands, something Regina didn't even realize they were doing. \"Alan…\" Fred said in a cold tone that chilled Regina down to her bones. \"Dad, I…\" Alan said as he held her hand tighter. She was happy that he wasn't backing down. \"This is my girlfriend, Regina.\" \"Alan…if you do not let of her that girl's hand and come with me…\" Fred warned and Regina could feel him flinch. \"I'm staying at the party, dad.\" Alan said in a soft voice. Just then, Coach Yoast stepped in. \"Fred, come on now, this is my little Sheryl's birthday party. Now, don't cause a scene that you're gonna regret causing later.\" \"Bill…look at what he's doing! You and the others around here try to act like things are normal as if you forgot about what these people did…all because some nigger kid got shot.\" \"Excuse you?\" Regina said as she stepped forward and was in Fred's face. She could see him sneer down at her, but she didn't flinch. \"Get out of my face, girl. I don't even know what my son sees in you…\" \"I see everything you don't see, dad.\" Alan said as he pushed her behind him. \"I see an amazing person interested in literature and music and me. I don't care what you say…I'm dating her.\" Alan said in a tone that angered Fred and if there weren't too many people at the party he probably would have hit him. \"Alan…I'll see you when you get home…\" Fred said in a dismissive tone as he left and there was a queasy feeling in the pit of Regina's stomach. \"Don't go home tonight, Alan.\" she begged, suddenly. \"Why? I'm not afraid of him. Not anymore.\" \"But, I'm afraid for you. He's gonna kill you now that he knows you and I are dating. I mean…look what he did to your shoulder for the whole Petey thing.\" \"I know, but I can't avoid him. He's my dad, but I'm not going to let him run my life.\" he said before Coach Yoast walked up to them. \"Alan…am I hearing this right? Is your dad hitting you?\" \"No…\" Alan said as he stared down at the floor and Regina couldn't let him do that. \"Yes, he is!\" Regina said and Alan look at her as if she had betrayed him. \"Alan, forget your pride and save your life. If you go home, tonight, he's going to kill you.\" \"He won't do that. Yeah, he's mad, but he won't…\" \"Sometimes…family can do more harm than your worst enemies, Alan. I've seen it happen. Don't go home tonight, please.\" \"I know my dad, Regina…he won't do that. And for the record, he doesn't hit me. We just get into fights a lot.\" Alan said and Regina rolled her eyes. Damn male pride. \"Are you sure, Alan?\" Coach Yoast asked as he stared at him. \"Yes, I'm sure. Oh heck, you shouldn't eve being worrying about me. This is your daughter's birthday party, after all.\" \"You're like a son to me, Alan. I can't go on with one child knowing that the other is hurting.\" he said and that made Alan smile. \"I'll be fine, coach. Trust me…I know how to handle him. He just needs to cool off.\" \"Okay…but if you need anything, I'll be here for you.\" Coach Yoast said as he walked away. \"Regina…\" Alan said in a slightly angry tone. \"Why'd you say that?\" \"You should be thanking me. I'm trying to save your life. You dad beat the crap out of you for allowing Petey to take your spot…I don't even want to know what he's going to do now. Alan, I really care about you and I don't want you to get hurt or…\" \"I will be fine, Regina. Don't worry about me. Come on…let's just enjoy the party.\" \"I can't do that knowing that if you go home your dad will try to kill you…it's all my fault.\" \"How could you say that? You're the one that wanted to break up with me when you found out about the bruises on my shoulder. I'm the one that wanted to date you, still. I care about you too much to let my dad's feelings get in the way.\" he said as he grabbed her hand. \"Alan…\" Regina said in a soft voice. \"Don't have so much pride. That's gonna get you killed if you're not careful.\" she said as she kissed him on the cheek. \"Now, let's have fun.\" she said with a big smile as they made their way to Petey and Blue. \"Hey, Petey, Blue.\" Alan said as they walked up to them. Petey had gotten over Regina's rejection and saw her as more like a sister. He wasn't quite sold on them dating, but it wasn't as big of a deal to him as it was with other people. \"You okay, man?\" Blue asked as he looked at Alan. \"We saw what was going on there.\" \"Yeah, I'm fine. Just had my relationship out in the open to my dad before I wanted to, but who cares what he thinks? Who wouldn't like this girl here?\" Alan said and she blushed. \"Your dad doesn't like me…\" Regina mumbled and Alan looked at her with a sad look. She knew he wanted his dad to like her, but he also knew that he wouldn't. \"I know…but he doesn't matter, remember?\" he said with a smile. \"I guess…\" she trailed off as she watched everybody at the party. It seemed as if she and the Titans were in another world in which black and white got along. She knew Alan was the only one at the party talking to her, Petey, Blue and Rev. Gerry tried, but Emma and Ray were there to ruin the moment. \"I'll be right back.\" she said to them as she went to look for the bathroom. She was almost there when Gerry stopped her. \"I'm really sorry about Emma and Ray…\" he simply said as he stared down at the ground out of embarrassment. \"I just…I'm sorry.\" \"Thanks…\" she mumbled as she stared at him. \"Gerry? If you're such great friends with Julius…why are you still friends with Ray and dating Emma?\" \"I don't know…Ray's been my best friend since we were kids and Emma…well, that's kind of difficult to explain. Why are you with Alan? You know…knowing how things are here and especially his dad.\" he said as he stared down at the ground again. \"That's a good question…\" she said with a chuckle, then stopped and smiled when she saw Alan laughing with Petey. \"I don't know…there's just something about him that makes it worth it. The stares we get, the looks of disgust and shock and disapproval. It comes from everybody. Black and white people don't like seeing Ray and me together. I know you probably wouldn't admit this, and I'm not trying to jump to conclusions, but I can tell you don't really like that we are dating. I know you don't hate me…but you wouldn't like seeing us together. Am I right?\" \"I hate to say it, but…yes. I really don't hate you, but something in me keeps saying that this ain't right. I just don't see how you could date knowing how people would feel…\" \"Well, at least you're honest. I respect you for that. Well, I have to go, but thanks for the apology.\" she said as she went to the bathroom and returned to Alan, Blue, Petey, and Rev. They enjoyed the rest of the party and left. Alan dropped her off at her house and she made him promise that he would come directly to her house if things went bad with his dad. She knew it was…[Chapter 8] There was a sick feeling in the pit of her stomach as she awakened by a loud pounding at the front door. She slept on the couch to be the first one there if the was smart and went to her house instead of going to his. When she opened the door, she almost cried. Alan had been beaten up, bad. His nose looked like it was broken and streaming blood, he was holding his mid-section, and he had cuts and bruises all over his face and he had a black eye. \"Hey…\" Alan said as he leaned against he doorframe, and Regina touched his face and he let out a hiss of pain. Through a tired gaze, he stared at her. \"Dad!\" Regina shouted over her shoulder as she helped Alan to the kitchen table. \"Could you get mom's emergency first aid kit?\" \"Y-yeah…sweet pea.\" he said as he went into their bedroom. \"I told you not to go home!\" Regina yelled at him. \"If you weren't injured already, I would smack you right now.\" she said, angrily. \"I didn't think my dad would try to kill me. I, honestly, thought he would do this.\" \"Here you go, sweet pea.\" Reggie said as he returned with the first aid kit and turned the kitchen light on before sitting on the couch. \"What happened?\" Regina said as she was examining his face. She knew he would have to go to the hospital because his nose was definitely broken. \"I came home, and my dad was sitting in his chair…waiting. I don't even know how it started, but we got in an argument. He pushed me, I pushed him back. I knew there was no going back after that and he swung at me. Kept hitting me and cursing and calling you names. Ow.\" he said when she applied pressure to his nose. \"Hey, dad. Is mom still working?\" she called over her shoulder. \"No. She said she was getting off a little early. You think he needs to go to the hospital?\" \"Yeah…I think his nose is broken. Maybe she could fix it when she gets here.\" she said before turning back to Alan. \"Go on.\" \"Anyway, we started brawling. I got in a few good hits, though. Damn near broke every piece of furniture in there, though.\" \"You could've died. He could've been so angry that he might have…even if he wasn't trying to kill you on purpose. You should've stayed with Coach Yoast. Oh, my mom's here. She'll help you. But…you might have to be taken to the hospital.\" \"Fine…I'll go.\" he said as he saw the door open and a chunky woman in a nurses uniform came in. She almost dropped her keys as she saw Alan's condition. \"Okay, who the hell is he and what the hell happened to him?\" she said a she rushed over to him. She was inspecting his face with an intensity that nurses had. \"Mom…this is Alan.\" Regina said and her mother just lifted her eyebrows. \"So, you're Alan, huh? Well, judging by your face…even in this state…I'd say you're quite the handsome young man. Nice to meet you.\" \"Thanks…\" he mumbled feeling a bit uncomfortable and embarrassed. \"Well, the nose is severely fractured, but it ain't broken. Now, as for your mid-section…I think you might have a bruised ribs. You need to go to the hospital, son.\" \"I'll take him.\" Regina said as she stood up. \"I mean, I don't mind.\" \"I'll go with you. They would respond faster if I'm with you.\" \"Okay. Alan, can you stand up?\" Regina said as she prepared to help him up. \"Yeah, I can get up.\" he said with a hiss as he stood up. It was a wonder to her how he managed to walk this far to her house alone in the state he was in. They were in her mother's car and were driving to the hospital. Regina was in the back seat with Alan and she was holding his hand. She tried to forget what his father had said to her. She tried to forget that cold, disgusted look he gave her when he saw that she was with Alan. It chilled her to think about it and she knew his face must have been worse when he was fighting with his son. \"We're here, honey.\" Shirley said as she parked the car. They helped Alan into the emergency room. \"They'll see him in a few minutes. I'll be talking to Roberta if you need me.\" \"Regina…I want to say I'm sorry. I should've listened to you. I shouldn't have gone home.\" \"I know…but, you're alright and that's what matters now.\" Regina said with a smile as she stared at him. He was smiling also as he stared at her. \"Do you think you need to stay somewhere tonight?\" Regina asked as she held his bruised hand. \"I'll be fine. I think I'm just going to stay with coach. I'm sure his offer still stands.\" \"Okay. Hey, Alan…Now, that your dad knows about us…what do you want to do?\" \"I'm not breaking up with you, Regina. So, he kicked the crap out of me. Big deal. If he can't deal with his son being in love with someone different, then…to hell with him.\" \"You say that now, but he's your dad. Are you sure you're ready to cut him out of your life for me? What if you and I go to different colleges and we meet people? It wouldn't be worth it to have your dad out of your life, then.\" \"I'm still not breaking up with you.\" he said with a smirk on his face. \"Okay…what if it would be better if you and I didn't date. I mean, come on. We're getting stared at just sitting together here.\" \"Then, they'll really stare if I do this…\" he said as he kissed her. When she pulled away, she stared at his busted lip before looking into his eyes. Those wonderful blue eyes, one surrounded by purple and yellow bruise, were staring at her with so much caring and love. Yet…they seemed full of hate and rage because of his father. \"In my defense you kissed me in case someone wants to point the blame.\" Regina said with a chuckled. \"Your dad really did a number on you…\" \"Yeah, well…that's what I get for being so damn weak. According to him, little Sheryl Yoast could take a tackle better than me.\" \"That's not true…I've tried to tackle you hundreds of times and you wouldn't go down.\" \"Yeah? When did you even try?\" he said with a laugh. \"Don't worry about it.\" Regina teased as she saw a nurse coming from the back. She was white and looked at Regina and Alan with caution as she saw their hands in each other's. \"Well, it looks like I'm going to get fixed up. Wish me luck.\" \"Luck. I'll be out here waiting on you.\" Regina said as she sat there and reached for a magazine. Her mother came back and sat next to her. \"So, I take it Alan's father isn't to happy about your relationship with him. And I, also, take it that he isn't happy because you're black.\" \"Yeah…he hates me. Hates me even more since I stood up to him and embarrassed him in front of a bunch of other white people. It's so stupid mom. Just because Alan and I are dating…\" \"Regina…you know the exact same thing would happen in New York.\" \"Yeah, but it wouldn't be so bad…it's like the entire town is stuck behind and…well, I hate it. I want to be able to date Alan without worrying about what people will think.\" \"One day, you will, baby…one day, you will.\" her mom said in a comforting tone.[Chapter 9] After hearing of his fight with his dad, Coach Yoast opened up his home to Alan, and Regina was relieved. He told him that he would talk to Fred, but she didn't know if that was going to do any good. Fred was a well-liked man. \"Hi, Sheryl.\" Regina said to the little blonde girl as she stood outside waiting on Alan to come to the door. \"Did you like the presents you got for your birthday?\" she said making small talk. \"Everything but one. My step-dad got me a doll.\" she said with a grimace and Regina wanted to laugh at the tomboy. \"Hey, Regina.\" Alan said as he stood behind Sheryl and the little girl went outside as Regina went it holding a basketball \"You should see how she destroyed that doll.\" \"I would imagine.\" Regina said as she sat down at the kitchen table with Alan. \"Your bruises make you look like crap.\" \"Ha, ha. You'd look like this too if your dad kicked the crap out of you.\" \"My dad wouldn't do it because he doesn't care about the color of your skin or our relationship.\" she said, seriously, as she stared at him. \"Well, your dad is a good man. I used to think my dad was a good man, but…anyway, are we still on for studying together or…?\" \"Just like you to want to study together after getting your ass kicked for dating me. Alan…\" \"Let me guess…you want to break up.\" he said as he stared at the floor and, for the first time, Regina could see that he might consider it. That bothered her a little. \"Do you want to break up?\" she asked as she stared at him and he let out a long sigh. \"Regina…no matter how much better it would be for the both of us, I don't want to break up. I like you a lot and you like just as much.\" \"Your dad is going to disown you if we don't stop, but…I really, really don't want to. We're insane…\" Regina said with a laugh. \"Then, we'll just be insane. What my dad did to me won't change how I feel about you. And it sure as hell not gonna stop us.\" \"But, do you think his rage will stop? It won't. He'll be just a pissed as he was at the party and when you two were fighting years from now.\" \"Well, that'll be his problem. So, do you want to study? I really need help on the paper coming up. Shakespeare is so hard to understand.\" \"Me doth thinks you make it more complicated than it should be…\" she teased and Alan rolled his eyes and laughed. \"Yeah…I didn't understand a word you just said. See? I need help.\" \"Alright, get the book.\" she said as Alan went into the back room and returned with the play they were reading in class, Henry VIII \"Henry VIII is one of Shakespeare's most difficult plays. A lot of people find it hard to understand. Even thought it's based on actual history.\" \"You should be a teacher.\" he said and Regina laughed. \"I'm serious. You would make a great English teacher. You already know so much.\" \"True…\" she said feeling a little arrogant that she did know so much. \"Alan? Could I ask you a question?\" she said in a cautious voice. \"Sure…What is it?\" he said as he stared at the play. \"How long has your dad been hitting you?\" she said and he looked up an met her eyes. \"Ever since my mom died…\" he said in a soft, serious voice and she wanted to hug him. \"I'm sorry, Alan.\" she said with her head hung low. \"Do you mind if I ask how long ago that was?\" she said knowing she had to know how long his dad had been hitting him. \"About five years ago…\" Alan said as he tried to fight tears Regina knew were coming and she regretted asking her first question to start all of that. \"You know what…this was a bad idea. Let's just forget talking about this and go back to studying, okay?\" Regina said trying to move on. She didn't want to upset Alan. \"It's okay, Regina. I like talking about my mom. She…kinda balanced everything out, you know. My dad was always hard on me and she was there to comfort me. He didn't start hitting me until she died. You know…I've never told anyone that before.\" \"I'm glad I'm the first. Alan…I'm going to regret saying this, but…maybe you should talk to your dad. I know he won't change his mind about us, and I know he hate that we are dating…but, he's your dad and you're all he has.\" \"He hates me, Regina. I don't know…maybe I remind him too much of mom. People always said I looked more like her than him. I don't know if she was as accepting of, you know, blacks as I am, but…she was a good person.\" \"I believe that. I mean, look at you. You're on a football team with blacks and whites playing together…on the same team. You're dating me. You have your mother's heart and more. If your dad could see that, he'll love you again. He'll just hate you as well, for being with me. I okay with that, actually. I know some people won't change no matter how much everyone around them are. You'll just have to see if your dad had loved you, then…after your mom died and before you started dating me.\" Regina said as she stared in his blue eyes. Suddenly, there was a knock at the door and they panicked. Surely, Fred wouldn't try to finish the job or try to take him back with him so soon after their fight. They were relieved to see Coach Herman Boone standing there with his daughter and Sheryl behind him. Alan stood up and let him inside. He make a courteous nod toward Regina and she returned with a slight wave. \"How are you holding up, Alan?\" Coach Boone asked as Coach Yoast walked into the kitchen. Regina stared at the men that were almost like father figures for him. \"I'm doing fine, coach. The doctors said I shouldn't play for at least a week or two, but I think I'll be fine for next week.\" \"No, you're not, Alan.\" Regina said in a voice that was similar to the tone her mother used when arguing with her dad. \"Remember what my mom said…you need time to heal.\" \"Yeah, yeah…\" he said and as the two coaches stared at her with a smirk. She knew she had reminded them of their wives. \"Her mother's a nurse.\" \"Yeah, I think I met her.\" Coach Boone said as he turned to her. \"Your name is Regina, right?\" he said as he held out his hand to her and she accepted it. This was a formal introduction to the infamous Coach Boone. The tougher of the two coaches. \"Yes, it is. Nice to meet you.\" she said before turning to Alan. \"Hey, how about we meet up tomorrow to discuss the Henry VIII paper?\" \"Sure…\" he said as she gave a smile to the two coaches before leaving. Just as she was going back to her father's car, Alan ran out and stopped her. \"Regina, do you mind if we go to the lake to study? I like Coach Yoast and all, but I kind of feel uncomfortable at his house.\" \"Of course, we can study there. I was actually starting to miss the lake. Looks like you got me to accept nature. Not fully, but…anyway, I have to. I'll see you tomorrow.\" she said as she kissed him before getting into the car and driving off.[Chapter 10] Sitting in her father's car with Alan, Regina was trying to explain the play to him as best as she could without him getting too confused. \"What?\" she said as he just stared, blankly, at her. \"Your eyes become the brightest brown when the sunlight hits them.\" \"Alan…this is serious. The paper is due in a week. And thanks for the compliment.\" \"You're welcome. You know my bruises are healing up good. Pretty soon, I'll look as good as you do.\" he said with a crooked grin. \"You're the only guy I know that would joke about this bruises like that.\" \"I know, but that's why you like me, right?\" \"Right.\" Regina said as she kissed his cheek. \"So, have you talked to your dad, yet?\" \"Why did you have to bring him up? I don't care if I never talk to him for as long as he lives. He kicked the crap out of me for dating you because you're black. It's such a stupid reason to hate me. His own son.\" Alan said in an angry tone. \"I know that, but don't you think cutting him out of your life is extreme? Look, as I said before, he's not going to change his mind about us. I know this, and you know this…\" \"Why should I be the one to extend the olive branch? He should be the one apologizing. Regina, you don't understand. This has been going on way before the schools integrated. He's always hated me. Ever since mama died…\" \"Well, do you think he's hurt?\" she asked and Alan looked at her in shock. \"Are you taking his side?\" he asked and Regina let out a sigh. \"Regina…he…\" \"I know what he did, Alan!\" she snapped. \"Look, I'm sorry. I don't like feeling a little sorry for him…especially knowing how he feels about me and you and all blacks for that matter. But, part of me feels like he's using that pain he feels and taking it out on you. You need to talk to him. If not to convince him that blacks are not evil, you need to talk to him about your mother.\" \"What if he won't listen?\" Alan asked as he looked into her eyes. Regina could see the deep sadness that was held in his eyes. She knew, deep down, Alan wanted to talk to his father about his mother the way she said he should. \"Make him listen. Just don't start another violent fight with him. I would like to kiss my boyfriend without having bruises on his face.\" \"But, the bruises make me look so manly.\" he said with that cute crooked grin before he let out a laugh causing Regina to roll her eyes and shake her head. \"Are you done? Can we get back to studying?\" \"Yeah…I just have one question. What do you miss about New York?\" Alan asked as Regina scoffed because it had taken her by surprise. \"Wow…that's a…um…question. Well, I miss my neighborhood, my friends…not that I don't like my new friends here. I just miss them, you know. And…I'm not saying everything there was perfect, because it wasn't. I just miss it, you know…\" \"Yeah. I think so. So…\" he said as developed a serious look on his face. \"Where are you thinking of going to college?\" \"Um…Let's not talk about that right now. Let's get back to studying…\" \"You're going to college in New York, are you?\" he asked and she let out a sigh. \"Don't do this now, Alan…\" Regina said wishing he had never said that. Of course, she was going to college in New York. She had planned on doing that ever since she was a little girl. \"Forget about the paper right now. Regina…I may not get this English Literature stuff, but I ain't stupid. I know you're going to college in New York. I'm not mad. I just don't want to lose you. Hell, we only started dating weeks ago. \"I know, but going to Sarah Lawrence was a dream of mine ever since I can remember. I don't want to talk about his, right now. It's not even January, yet…\" she said feeling shocked that time had gone by so slow, yet she felt as if it was flying by. In a few months, they would be graduating and, most likely, going to different colleges. \"Okay…I'll let it go, for now. One thing at a time, right?\" he said with a chuckle. \"Now, about this paper…\" he began, but Regina leaned over and kissed him. \"What was that for?\" \"Making our time together count for as long as I can.\" she said with a smile. \"Oh, Carole King!\" she said as she tuned the radio up and started singing along to, \"It's Too Late\". \"Ah…girl music.\" he said and she, playfully, hit him on the shoulder. \"Ow…\" \"Carol King is not girl music. You're just jealous of my great taste in music.\" she said as she stuck out her tongue and continued to sing along. \"I'll get you to like country one of these days.\" \"I doubt it, but you could keep trying. I like you, but I just can't do it…\" \"You will…\" he said as the song changed and Regina turned the music down. They continued studying and going over the play until Regina dropped him off at Coach Yoast's house. She was happy that his coach had taken him in and kept him away from his dad, but she knew he need to talk to his dad. \"Regina…I'm sorry for bringing up the college thing…\" he said in a sad tone as he held his head low. She didn't want him to feel bad about talking about it. \"It's okay. We're going to have to face it sooner or later. I don't know…just because we might be going to different colleges doesn't mean we have to stop talking to each other. We could write each other and stuff like that. Maybe a call on our birthdays. I don't want to stop being your friend. I just know…the college I want to go to is in New York.\" \"I understand. I don't know where I want to go, yet, so I might be going to college in New York. You never know. I doubt I would fit in, though.\" \"You would fit in…I think people would make fun of your accent the way people have been making fun of mine.\" she said jokingly. \"People made fun of your accent?\" Alan asked in surprised. \"Yeah…mostly Petey…\" she said as she rolled her eyes and shook her head. \"But, seriously, Alan. Don't base your college choice on where I'm going to be.\" \"I know…I just don't know where to go. I never have. Honestly, I didn't think I would even go to college. I never thought I was smart enough. That was until you…\" \"Aww…\" she said as she kissed him. When she pulled back, she saw Coach Yoast standing at the window peaking through the blinds. \"I think you should go in. I see your coach peaking out the window…\" she said with a light laugh. \"Yeah…I'll see you at school tomorrow.\" Alan said as he got out of the car. \"Regina?\" \"Yeah?\" she said as he stood beside her car with the door open. \"I want you to meet me in the library after school.\" \"Why?\" she asked feeling curious as to what he was up to. \"Just meet me. I promise you won't regret it. I have to go. See you tomorrow.\" he said as he shut her car door and went inside. She was pulling out when she saw Alan standing in the doorway waving at her. She just shook her head and laughed at her crazy boyfriend.[Chapter 11] Regina stood in the library waiting for Alan to show up. She had bugged him with questions the entire day trying to find out what he was planning, but she wouldn't tell her. Why the library? It just seemed like a strange place to meet him, but she just went with it. A lot of things with Alan, she had to just go with the flow and it was okay with her. She turned around and saw Alan was walking towards her with a rose in his hand and he wore a ruffle shirt and she wondered where he got that. Oh, how much is fellow Titans would tease him constantly. And she, herself, thought it was rather silly…yet it was also sweet. \"Alan?\" she asked as he got down on his knees in front of her and that caused everyone to stare in their direction. If Regina was white her face would be beet red from all the blushing she was doing. \"What are you…?\" \"She speaks. O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art…\" Alan said as he lifted the rose to her and she took it. She knew he was quoting from Shakespeare's, Romeo and Juliet. \"Alan…people are staring. As if they didn't do that enough when we're together.\" Regina said as she leaned down. \"Where did you get the shirt?\" \"Theater. I'm kinda borrowing it. I know I look silly, but I was hoping you'd like it. Do you like it?\" Alan asked as he stared up at her with a hopeful look. \"Not really…but it looks good on you, though. Want to get up?\" Regina said knowing Alan might have wanted to be rescued from his embarrassment. \"Yeah.\" he said as he got off the ground and Regina could hear the hushed giggles and laughter from many people in the library. Just then, Regina kissed him and those laugher and giggles turned into gasps and sharp breath intakes. \"If they weren't staring before, they're staring now.\" Alan said with a chuckle as they sat down. \"Obviously. So, what's this all about? Not that I don't like it, I'm flattered and speechless, in a good way. But…I'm confused.\" \"Well, I wanted to show you that I'm understanding Shakespeare a little more and I wanted to impress you. Don't you think you can relate to them…a lot of people hate our relationship.\" \"Yeah, but Romeo and Juliet is such a tragic story. We don't have to be so tragic. Yes, there are people that aren't happy about us, but it's not that bad. Speaking of people not liking our relationship, did you ever talk to your dad?\" Regina asked and Alan scoffed. \"No. Regina, I still don't see the point in talking to him. Even with time, he'll still feel the same way. So, I'm not going to bother with it.\" \"Okay…I won't force the issue. I don't know…I guess I didn't want you to feel like you have to shut him out for my sake.\" \"I'm pretty sure I'd be shutting him out even if I wasn't dating you. Regina, this has been going on long before you showed up. I just took it because I was all he had. I don't know…I think you showing up made me see that I didn't have to put up with it.\" \"You didn't have to put up with it. Shame on your dad for making you feel bad about everything. Alan?\" Regina asked in a hesitant tone. She didn't want to ask this, but she knew she had to. \"Did he ever blame you for your mother's death?\" \"Yeah…and said I was a disappointment. That's what he would say to me. Before he found out about you, he actually said that he was shocked my grades in English were getting better. Said I was too dumb to actually read.\" he said and Regina felt her heart break for her boyfriend as she stared into his gemstone blue eyes and saw the sadness within them. \"You're not dumb, Alan. Your dad is, but you're not. In fact, if he was right here right now, he wouldn't even be able to understand the line your recited.\" \"Hell, I barely understood it.\" he said with a sheepish grin and Regina laughed. \"I hope you like the rose.\" he said and Regina brought the rose to her nose and inhaled it's scent. Looking around the library, she was aware that everyone's stares were trained on them. \"Sometimes, I wonder if things will always be like this in the future. You know, when we're old, do you think we'll be stared at like this in the future.\" \"I don't know. I don't see anyone else when I stare at you. How am I going to get through college without you, Regina?\" \"Let's not talk about that, right now. And you'll do fine. We'll be fine, and I promise you we'll keep in contact with each other. I don't want to stop talking to you even if we're apart.\" \"Okay. So, what do you want to do? Since I'm out of the game for a few days…\" \"Uh, two weeks. I'm not kidding, my mother said you shouldn't play or practice for at least two weeks and you shouldn't.\" \"What are you going to do about it if I do go?\" \"Are you willing to test me, Alan?\" Regina asked and he let out a laugh. Just then, they were shushed my the librarian who had been watching them ever since Alan walked in and gave her the rose. \"You're favorite librarian is watching us.\" \"Ignore her…\" he said as he rolled his eyes and a small smirk tugged at his lips and she could tell he was thinking of something sneaky. \"Or we could…\" \"Whatever you're thinking, stop. I already have enough people staring at me. Not that I care, but it's still very uncomfortable.\" \"I was thinking about having just one great kiss as you're checking out a book.\" he said with a boyish grin and a mischievous twinkle in his jewel blue eyes. \"Okay…\" Regina said wanting to kick herself for not being able to turn him down. There was actually a book I wanted to read, so I guess I'll be checking it out.\" Regina said as she got up from the table. She couldn't stop herself from smiling at the sweet gesture he did for her. However, she couldn't help feeling that misery in him when it came to his father. She knew bringing it up was a bad idea, but she was always the type to be direct and never let the slightest thing slide. Walking to the Jane Austen collection, she picked up a rather old copy of Northanger Abbey . She walked up to the front desk and saw that librarian glare at her. She reluctantly checked out the book, but paused when she saw Alan coming behind Regina. \"Regina…\" he said and she turned around. Grabbing her face, she felt her heart race and almost forgot about the mean librarian standing behind her. This was truly a romantic moment, or it would've been if a million pair of eyes weren't on them. Okay, so it wasn't that many pair of eyes, but it felt like it to Regina. But, staring into Alan's blue eyes make her weak. And staring at his pinks lips made her mouth water. Just then, Alan press his lips against her in a sweet kiss and she could hear the librarian, loudly, clear her throat trying to break them apart. Regina knew they was so close to being banned, but she didn't care. Alan was just as pissed with this ignorant woman as she was. \"Young man,\" the librarian said as he broke the kiss and all Regina could see was Alan. \"I don't know what you're trying to pull, but I am not amused.\" she said and Alan just simply smiled as he gathered Regina's book and they left, hand in hand. They stopped outside the door and began laughing, hysterically, until they were in tears. \"You're going to get us banned.\" Regina said as she tried to stifle her laugh. ","Summary":" It was the worst summer Reggie Morris picked to move his family from Manhattan, New York to Alexand"},{"Movie":"Jeepers Creepers","Title":"Unfortunate","Author":"Quistis Trepe1","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2666976","Passage":"[Chapter 1] A school camping trip goes horribly wrong when the Creeper makes an appearance. It was a warm, still day. The forest stood dark and quiet, resting on top of the steep hills of Mayflower Way, looking down on the surrounding countryside like a silent watchtower. No breeze soughed through the trees or cooled the earth, and the air was hot and dry. Inside the forest the atmosphere was much cooler and darker; an eerie silence persisted broken only by the occasional squawk of a bird, or of a forest animal rustling as it scampered across the leaf litter. It was a foreboding atmosphere suited well to the foreboding forest, but believe it or not, this Forest, Mayflower Forest, was the destination of the small group of campers who were slowly but surely scaling Mayflower Hills. The silence and serenity of the countryside was shattered by this travelling group; occasional bouts of singing, raucous laughter, bellows and shouts, although there weren't many inhabitants of Mayflower Way that the group could really disturb. Or that's what they thought... \"Eww! I'm so sweaty, I hate sweating, I never usually sweat,\" Madison cried as another droplet of sweat rolled freely down her forehead into her eyes. She wiped her eye with a sweaty hand and then flicked the sweat off her hand in disgust. \"You do when I'm with you babe,\" Cole added in, and as usual, his comment was followed by a burst of boisterous laughter from the few other boys walking along beside him. \"Shut up Cole,\" Madison sighed wearily as if she was a mother who'd grown sick of her child misbehaviour, but as she sighed she had a mischievous grin on her face. Really she loved the attention she got off Cole. Madison and Cole were members of the alpha group, the alpha males and alpha females; the popular kids; the 'bimbos and the jocks'. They were beautiful and athletic and oozed with charisma; some of them were clever but hid it well because it wasn't cool to be smart in their group. This group obviously took the lead on the trek, and currently were a few hundred yards ahead of the rest of the class. They scaled the lower parts of Mayflower Hills quite easily, but were starting to slow down as the hill got steeper. The day was scorching and no clouds blanketed the cerulean blue sky above. \"Can we stop for some water?\" Keeley asked in her soft, creamy voice. Everyone else was desperate for a rest too, but they were all too proud to ask for a break, and were all so relieved when Keeley asked to stop. The alphas walked on a few more steps and then settled on a neat arrangement of rocks on a grassy plateau. There was the noise of flasks and bottles popping open as thirsty hikers guzzled down icy water, and then there was a relaxing silence. The view from this picturesque plateau was beautiful; below the alpha group lay a rugged stretch of land, like a blanket of verdant grass stretched across a layer of rocky loam. The hill below them was gentler than the hill above them which seemed to almost tower over them. The group looked down at the rest of their class marching on slow, a good bit away from them. \"We'll still make it to the top first,\" Keeley said matter-of-factly, breaking the silence. \"Well duh,\" Cole snorted. \"We're nearly there anyway already,\" Brooke added in. There were nine members of the alpha group; Madison, Keeley, Cole, Brooke, Blake, Xavier, Spencer, Taylor and Tristan. It could be said that Tristan was the alpha male, he was the leader of the group and everyone looked to him. He was an intelligent boy with swarthy good looks. Everyone always noticed his eyes; they were very light brown, like milky milky chocolate. But besides their brightness, they seemed so deep. It was difficult to have a conversation with him and not be completely hypnotised by his eyes. His girlfriend was Taylor. \"Aw honey, I'm so tired,\" Taylor purred as she stretched her neck and laid back across Tristan's lap, who was sitting on a flat rock. He diligently stroked her chestnut hair around her face. Taylor wasn't a very bright girl, but was madly in love with Tristan. She wasn't really popular but had a really big reputation because she was Tristan's girlfriend. Her haughty demeanour mixed with her complete disregard of anyone else who existed other than herself didn't really bode well for her when she was making friends, but she did look really hot. She had long chestnut hair, a tanned, athletic body with sumptuous, plump breasts and an ass as tight as a tambourine. She also had beautiful, pale, cherry lips that just begged to be kissed. They didn't need to do much begging, as a few seconds after Taylor threw herself into her lover's lap, she and Tristan were in a deep embrace. \"Come on! The others are starting to catch up,\" Blake exclaimed, shaking Tristan so that he was forced to end his tender kiss with Taylor. Blake was a very jittery person, and played for at least three sports teams. He was an outstanding sportsman, and excelled at basketball (probably due to his towering frame) but had little going for him academically; whether this was due to a lack of trying or plain stupidity was yet to be determined. \"Yeah, I'm starting to get bored,\" Brooke droned in her glacially-slow husky voice. \"Then let's go!\" Yelled the ever-animated Cole, and the Alpha group quickly packed up their things and recommenced their trek. \"If the tent's a-rockin, don't come a-knockin,\" Blake whispered to Cole, nodding at Tristan and Taylor as they went. His comment was met with the usual snigger. Chapter 1 Fin[Chapter 2] CHAPTER2 Thencentral camp fire was blazing. Its long fiery tendrils licked thencold night air and it crackled and spat angrily, providing ample heatnand light for the merry, although quite exhausted, bunch of schoolnkids who encircled it. Usually the group would have broken up intonits respective cliques by now; the alphas, the smart kids, the geeks,nthe people in the middle, the Chinese students and the Spanish group,nbut today everyone was too tired, and they all huddled near the fire,nand chatted aimlessly. The trek up the hillside was very taxing, andnthen they had to hike through the untamed forest to find the campingnspot. But people were too tired even to complain. All the tents hadnbeen assembled, and some people were retiring to bed. Therenwas a shriek of laughter near the fire as one of the Alphas told anjoke, and on the other side of the wall of flame, some other kidsn(Jocelyn, Riley and Juan) were deep in the midst of a ghost storynabout the very woods they were in, and how they were haunted by anwitch who murdered three student filmmakers who'd tried to film herna few years ago – it wasn't a very original story, but it keptnthem entertained none the less. Their teacher, Ms. Mentira, had gonento her luxury tent a while ago, so most of the kids who were still upnwere taking the opportunity to mess about away from Ms. Mentira'snwatchful glare. Thentent furthest from the fire, nestled between two really leafy Ashntrees, was pretty quiet, except for the slight heavy breathing comingnfrom within of someone who was obviously asleep. That heavy breathingnbelonged to Spencer, who was sharing a tent with Xavier who was stillnsitting up beside the fire, flirting with Keeley. He had not beennasleep for five minutes, when the front flap of his tent slowlynstarted to unzip. The zipper moved so slowly that it never made ansingle sound. It took awhile for the front flap to be completelynzipped open, but once it did the cold night air seemed to flood intonthe tent. The laughter from outside the tent was louder now, and sonwas the crackling of the fire, and Spencer felt himself awakening,nand he opened one drowsy eye. He peered down at the flap of the tent,nand saw a hunched black figure staring silently at him. Thentent was dark, as was the outside, and Spencer could only tell thatnsomeone was actually there because that someone was framed by thendancing flames of the fire behind him/her. Spencer quickly jerked outnof his sleep and grabbed his flashlight that was sitting right besidenhim, flicked the switch and shone the beam at the dark intruder. \"Sorry,nI didn't mean to scare you,\" laughed Darius, as Spencer's lightnblinded him a little. He was so used to the dark that the suddennshaft of light hurt his eyes. \"Inwasn't afraid,\" Spencer snorted, \"but I was asleep, and younwoke me up.\" \"Sorryndude,\" Darius replied superficially and crawled into the tent,nzipping the flap up behind him. \"Whatndo you think you're doing?\" Spencer snapped suddenly, a sense ofnurgency in his voice and sharply sat upright, his lime sleeping bagnfalling to his waist, revealing his tanned, muscular chest. \"Whatndo you think?\" Darius asked salaciously, as a wide grin spreadnacross his smooth features. He leaned over and his lips metnSpencer's. Theirnkiss was hard and passionate, the kiss of lovers who have beennwanting that kiss all day, who have been watching each other andnwaiting for each other but who haven't been able to, and finally,nin the privacy of the tent their two mouths met and their kiss feltnso good. Unfortunately for both of them, it was broken off abruptlynby Spencer. \"Wencan't, not here!\" he exclaimed and gently, albeit reluctantly,npushed Darius back a little. \"Whynnot?\" Darius protested, \"no one's coming, X is too busynflirting with that idiot Keeley.\" Darius lurched forward again,nthis time placing his hands on Spencer's shoulders, pulling himncloser to his lover. Spencer, gave a more forceful push this time,nsending Darius nearly across the tent. \"No, it's too risky!\"nSpencer whispered angrily. Dariusngave a hurt look, and went to unzip the tent and take his leave; \"Wait!\"nSpencer called before Darius could go, and a small furtive smilenfound its way onto Darius' face. \"Meetnme behind this tent in 5 minutes, don't let anyway see you!\"nSpencer called, and Darius winked and slipped out of the tent asnquietly as he had entered. Hownexciting! Sex in the woods so close to the other classmates andnnobody's allowed to know! Darius was thrilled as he crept back tonhis tent to grab his coat (although there was not much point, as in 5nminutes time, with any luck, he wouldn't be wearing any clothes).nSpencer had a really sexy body, he was on the football team and wasnone of the vital players on the team, and he worked out a lot! Dariusnfelt sort of ashamed sometimes when he saw Spencer naked, becausenSpencer looked so good, he was so muscled and slim, and althoughnDarius wasn't obese or anything, he still wasn't in as good shapenas Spencer was. Henbegan unzipping the flap to his own tent, and his mind was racingnwith thoughts of Spencer, with what they were going to do to eachnother in a matter of moments, with how much he loved him and with hownmuch he wished they could be an official couple, out in the open. Atnschool, Spencer and Darius never even spoke; they never even chattednto each other or even said hey as they passed each other in thencorridor. Nobody suspected a thing, except for Riley, Darius'nex-girlfriend/friend who he told everything to. Spencer insisted thatntheir relationship be kept secret, because if his sexuality wasndisclosed, he said it would ruin his life. It was probably easier fornDarius that it be kept quiet as well, but he still wished thatnsomeday they could walk down the street together holding hands.nDarius always got jealous when he saw straight couples kissing in anshop or in a café; 'they don't know how lucky they are'nhe would think. It annoyed him that he couldn't be open like thatnwith Spencer, but for the time being he was just happy enough meetingnSpencer surreptitiously. Dariusnpicked his coat up, zipped up the tent again without waking Brodyn(who he was sharing the tent with) and began to creep back tonSpencer's tent. He began to think of the first time he metnSpencer... Itnwas a few months ago back at school, he'd been in Spencer'snchemistry class, but he'd never spoken to him, but he'd alwaysnthought Spencer was cute. But not cute in an obsessed way, he wasnjust nice to look at. Darius didn't have a crush on him ornanything. He'd often catch Spencer staring at him, much tonSpencer's chagrin, but he never thought anything of it. He justnthought Spencer was one of those guys who got bored easily innChemistry class (like most people) and spent the lesson lookingnwildly about the place like a child looking for ways to entertainnhimself. Itnwas one of those crisp autumnal days where the wind whipped thenleaves violently around in the air, and the air was so cold that itnstung your ears and your eyes. Darius was sitting in the locker roomsnafter one of the most miserable gym lessons he'd ever had. He wasngetting changed, and hadn't noticed that Blake and Cole were stillnin the locker room. On their way out they went strangely quiet andnpurposefully knocked into Darius as they went. \"Heynwatch it!\" Darius called out angrily, before he realised who itnwas; Blake and Cole, the two alpha male jocks! Two of the mostnpopular kids in school! Darius suddenly felt panicky and looked away,nhoping that Blake and Cole would just walk out. They didn't. \"Whatndid you say dickhead?\" Cole barked angrily and stomped towardsnDarius, his teeth were clenched, and his face was twisted with coldnire, the muscles on his arms bulged and glistened in the pale lightnof the locker room. Darius couldn't help himself from thinkingnabout how cute Cole was, even through all his panic. \"Nothing,\"nDarius murmured, he swallowed hard and looked away and Cole knew henwas afraid. Blake sniggered in the background somewhere. Dariusnswallowed his humiliation, \"sorry,\" he croaked. Ansatisfied sneer unfolded across Cole's handsome face, \"that'snbetter.\" Hengave Darius one more disdainful look and then left with Blake,nshouting \"faggot,\" as he went. Darius stood, humiliated,nhe swallowed hard. He felt like crap. He was so angry; he was fillednwith rage, but not at Cole and/or Blake. He was angry at himself. Whyndid he let himself be treated like that? Why did he say sorry? Whyndidn't he say something else, why didn't he call them dickheads?nWhy was he so weak? He sat down on the stilted seat that was wet andnslippery, from someone's towel that had been lying there earlier.nHis shamed head fell into his hands as he began the all too familiarnroutine of self-deprecation and wallowing in his own misery. But his approachingnself-hate was halted by something that Darius did not expect. \"Don'tnworry about them, they're idiots,\" came a deep, although gentlenvoice. Dariusnlooked up, Spencer stood in front of him, looking down at himnsympathetically. Hisnblack hair was still wet from the showers, and his face hadn't beennshaven in awhile. He towered over Darius, making Darius feel evennsmaller. Dariusndidn't know what to think, was this guy for real? Spencer wasnfriends with Cole and Blake. Was he trying to be funny, was he takingnthe piss? \"What's it to you,\" Darius snapped. He grabbed hisnschool bag and stomped out of the locker room, leaving the kindlynSpencer standing alone. Thatnwas the first time that he met Spencer, and it probably wasn't thenbest first impression. He was embarrassed when he saw Spencer afternthat because he felt pathetic and he knew Spencer had seem him whennhe was mortified and vulnerable. It wasn't long after that untilnhe'd met Spencer again one night at a bar, Spencer was playing poolnand he hadn't seen Darius come in...Darius' musings were cutnshort when he saw a familiar, lofty figure in the shadows behindnSpencer's tent. He crept over and although you couldn't tell innthe pitch black, there was a wide grin on his face. He felt thendarkness with his hand until it was clasped by another hand; largenand warm. Spencer pulled Darius into him and kissed him tenderly,ntogether they crept off into the dark. Elsewherenin the dark, another couple had met up to perform other dark deeds.nGarrett and Bailey had found a nice leafy mound; the perfectnmake-shift bed, and within a couple of minutes of their meeting,nBailey had her top off (although her top hadn't left much to thenimagination anyway) and Garrett was enthusiastically fondling her.nNot a pretty girl, Bailey knew that Garrett liked her a lot, butnBailey had just showed up for sex. The hike to the camping spot hadncompletely wrecked her (she was unfit; it must've been all thensmoking) and to make matters worse she had lost her dope in the woodsnsomewhere. Sex with this guy was the next best thing to smoking dope,nshe just wished he'd hurry up and get on with it. Shenfell back on the leafy mound and felt the sweet smell of the earth,nshe pulled Garrett close and felt him pressed up against her. Shendecided she'd need to quit the foreplay before he gets too hornynand blows his load too early. Bailey quickly whipped her mini-skirtnoff (a move which she had perfected over years of practice) andnGarrett got down to business. He was sweating and breathing heavilynand suddenly he was inside her. Bailey groaned and squeezed her legsnaround him tighter. But something happened which made her forgetncompletely about Garrett flopping about on top of her, a dark shadowynfigure had just swooped past his head. Maybe she was seeing things innthe pale moonlight, but once again she saw the figure swoop by,nfollowed by the sound of sliced air. \"What'snthat?\" Bailey whispered, alarmed. \"Huh?\"nGarrett mumbled and continued thrusting. Baileynsat still for a moment and listened for any noises around her, shenmoved her head from side to side to see if anything was moving. Shencouldn't see very far because the moonlight was weak enough as itnwas, but any other beams of moonlight were blocked out by the craggyntree boughs reaching out into the night sky. She listened and couldnhear faint laughter from the camp which was a quite a walk away.nGarrett had insisted on them finding this remote spot to fuck, Baileyndidn't mind much but Garrett seemed to want privacy. Why did hencare about what the others thought? Anyway, this was no time to bengetting into this, her instincts were telling her she was in troublenand she wanted to go. Bailey was a tough gang-girl and never gotnafraid easily but something was happening around her that felt sonunnatural. That thing that swooped by wasn't a bat or any othernanimal like that, it was much too big. Garrettnwas thrusting harder now and his breathing had quickened, the noisenof his pounding breath, his heavy breath and the buzzing bloodnflowing around her ears, the smell of his sweat and the taste of hisnskin had blocked out her senses. She started to suffocate; she had tonget him off! But before she began to protest, Garrett let out a loud,nguttural moan and then fell, panting, on Bailey. He'd finished.n\"Ok, thanks, let's go!\" Bailey said quickly and pushednGarrett's sweaty body off her. \"What'snthe rush?\" he laughed, \"give me a few minutes and we can gonagain.\" \"Savenit for later,\" Bailey simpered; she was almost crying now, \"Let'sngo!\" \"What'snyour problem? You wanted it earlier. Fuck its true what people saynabout you –\" Garrett began but his tirade was cut short bynBailey's shriek. \"Whatnthe fuck is that?\" she squawked. Anmonstrous black figure was behind Garrett, standing silently. Beforenthere was a second to think, or to do anything, it darted forwardsnand as it came there was a wet, bone-crunching sound followed by anniron smell. The figure came face to face with Bailey and a hotnmalodorous wave swept over her, it was too dark to make out any ofnits features but everything about it was baleful. It stood andnbreathed its dead breath on her and then shot upwards into the skynand was swallowed by the darkness. Nearly paralysed with fear, Baileyncould not hold back her tears and they rolled freely down her cheeks.nShe suddenly became aware of something warm and wet covering hernchest and legs, was it Garrett's semen? No wait...why was Garrettnlying down? Bailey became sickeningly aware of the substance that shenwas splattered in; it was Garrett's blood. That thing hadncompletely eviscerated him. Overcomenwith primal fear Bailey turned and dashed off into the woods, but shenwas so confused and frightened, she didn't even know in whichndirection she was running. Her heart beat harder than it ever hadnbefore, and an electric terror snaked up her spine. She pumped hernskinny legs and ran as fast as she could, but she didn't get far.nShe heard the wind whistle behind her and she smelt that deathlynstench again. Suddenly, she felt a sharp sting in her chest andneverything fell calm and still around her. She felt herself beingnyanked up into the air and then she too was swallowed up by thendarkness, not the darkness of night however, the eternal darkness ofnthe dead...[Chapter 3] Being a very private and very dignified young woman, even the thought of urinating behind a bush right beside a group of her peers made her embarrassed, let alone actually doing it – even though it was six o'clock in the morning and that group of peers were all in a deep slumber. Jocelyn was so tempted just to run behind that oak tree and relieve herself but if anyone caught her she'd be mortified! No one was up, but she couldn't take the risk, therefore she groggily twisted out of her sleeping bag, pulled on her soggy hiking boots (they were wet with the morning dew) and crept off into the thicket to find a nice, clandestine, little spot where she could do her business. A shrill screech pierced the wet morning air, sending a flock of birds out of their sylvan nests, soaring high into the sky, their wings beating as they flew. At the campsite, tired campers were jolted out of their sleep (most of them anyway, Brody, a well known dope-head, could sleep through a nuclear holocaust). The brown, leathery tent at the head of the camp was the first to open, from its narrow entrance popped a small, pale face. The woman to whom this face belonged had prickly features; a short, spiked nose and tight, pursed lips, slanted, narrowed eyes and a tapering, pointed chin. She had shiny black hair which was perpetually pulled back in a painfully tight bun, which crowned her sharp little face. Her sour countenance gave the bitter impression that this woman had been forever sucking lemons. This woman was the class leader; Ms. Mentira.[Chapter 4] Rain Veladore sat on a gnarly log, it made her ass feel sore and itchy, but she was too tired to do anything about it. Yesterday, Rain had unwittingly pitched her tent upon a massive branch and when she went to bed it poked her painfully in the back, stopping her from sleeping for hours and when she had finally drifted off she was jolted out of her sleep by that horrible scream in the early hours. Her eyes were half-glued together by sticky sleep, her face was smudged with dirt (she had slipped and fallen when preparing the camp fire this morning – much to the amusement of the rest of her classmates) and her hands were smeared with bean sauce (after falling over, she had proceeded to spill a can of beans all over herself when preparing breakfast). She was a mess, but she usually always was anyway, so she didn't mind. It's not like anyone cared. Taylor marched past Rain and accidentally tripped on Rain's outstretched foot, \"Uh! Excuse me!\" Taylor exclaimed haughtily, with a disgusted scowl on her face when she realised who it was who had tripped her. Rain just looked away. Taylor stormed off. Everyone was rushing about around her, putting out the fire, getting dressed, taking down tents and preparing hiking equipment but Rain sat quiet and alone in all the bustle. She had always been one of the class outcasts, so much so that she no longer cared for their company; in fact she no longer wanted their company. She was fine just by herself; she had survived for so long this way. Rain's hair was lank and greasy; a messy explosion of jet blacks and depressing purples. Her eyes were always shadowed with purple make-up, and her lips were always delicately painted in deep purple also. Her skin was pale and marked with tiny pimple scars and her mouth always hung in a sulky glower. Despite her overtly cheerless appearance, Rain's dreary eyes marked a much more subtle sadness; a deep, hidden despair that clung to the depths of her bloody heart and sucked the life from her watery grey eyes. Her dark personality, mordant and morose, complemented her appearance well. Was it any wonder people kept their distance from Rain? Rain looked around the camp, at the boys and the girls, as they laughed and joked with one another. She caught the fleeting fires of lust in that boy's eyes as he stared at the girl who bent over to pick up an empty tin, or she caught the poisonous envy in that girl's eyes, as she watched the boy to whom her heart solely belonged, kiss and cuddle another girl. She saw those boys who helped each other take down their tent, their eyes focused and concentrated, their movements flowing together like a single unit, she saw those girls fixing their appearances in small, oval hand-held mirrors, as they preened and reassured each other. She heard all their voices, all their jokes and ideas and dreams and opinions and at the same time she heard nothing at all. For these people weren't like her, Rain was different. Then something else caught her sight; emerging from the shadowy thicket were two of her classmates, two of the missing classmates; Spencer and Darius. Both of them, looking a tad unkempt, stood around camp first, surveying the scene, then they quickly moved back into camp. They both looked suspiciously anxious. Rain, however, couldn't keep her eyes off Spencer. She was in love with him; a deep, pure and holy love. It was much more than an infatuation. Rain had studied this boy, she knew everything about him (or, rather, she thought she did), she knew how he spoke, how he walked, what his handwriting was like, who his favourite singer was, what his deep laugh sounded like, what irked him and what he wanted to be. She knew him so well, but she didn't know him at all. Spencer and Rain had barely ever spoken a few words to each other. Rain resumed her endless study of Spencer, and she was so consumed by her passion for him, that she didn't even notice the expectant hush that fell on the camp. All her classmates stopped what they were doing; they put down pieces of tent, or ceased munching beans. Ms. Mentira, looking calm and collected, had re-entered the camp, and there was no sign of the other classmates with her. \"Kids, I cannot find your other – oh, Darius, Spencer, you've returned,\" Ms. Mentira said, interrupting herself when she caught sight of the two prodigal classmates who were standing near the back of the camp. Instantly, all their classmates turned to look at them and instantly Darius and Spencer looked awkward. She stared at them, steely, waiting for an excuse, but none came. \"I have been terribly worried,\" Ms. Mentira started, but by her cool exterior, you may've thought otherwise, \"how incredibly irresponsible to sneak off into the woods!\" Ms. Mentira still looked calm, but her eyes now gleamed with a cold ire. She took a breath. \"Where have you been, and where are the others?\" Ms. Mentira demanded. Spencer and Darius both stood uneasily; Spencer shuffled his feet, Darius went red. Rain, however could see something much more urgent in Spencer's eyes, a hideous fear – he was hiding something. What had he and Darius been doing? \"The others?\" Darius eventually said, breaking the short silence. \"Yes – Bailey, Garrett and Jocelyn,\" Ms. Mentira answered. \"Oh, um, well, Spencer and I had seen them go off in the woods earlier and we followed them to scare them, but we lost track of them and turned back. Um, we didn't mean to make anyone worry,\" Darius quickly explained/lied. A few people glanced oddly at Spencer and Darius; they weren't even friends, why would they be going off into the woods together? Ms. Mentira glared at them, though her eyes softened. A scary computer in her head was examining the veracity of Darius' story. After a few tense seconds, Ms. Mentira nodded. \"Very well then,\" she said and then looked around; \"everyone, get ready, we are leaving within the next five minutes.\" \"But Miss!\" Cadence exclaimed, \"what about the others? We can't just leave them!\" \"They have left us!\" Ms. Mentira shouted back, \"there must be consequences for their complete irresponsibility and disregard. Do you think it's fair to keep everyone waiting here just for them, as they sit somewhere in the woods, probably getting high?\" \"But Miss!\" Cadence protested. \"Quiet, Cadence,\" Ms. Mentira cut her off sharply, \"I will wait here by myself for their return. Then I will hike with them to the next campsite where we will meet with the rest of you.\" \"You want us to hike by ourselves?\" Regan stuttered incredulously. \"You are all experienced enough,\" Ms. Mentira started, \"You all know how to follow trails, you all know how to manage time, you know what flora and fauna to avoid and you all know what to do in emergency situations. And you can all read maps; the second campsite is marked on your maps,\" she took a short break as everyone fumbled with their maps, \"a few miles from here atop a waterfall.\" Everyone nodded; some looked around anxiously whilst others looked around excitedly. \"I want you all to split up into groups of five. There are five trails to follow that all lead to the second campsite. Each group will follow a different trail. Each trail has a different obstacle; one has some rock climbing, one has some river-walking, one crosses a swamp, one crosses a ravine and one cuts right through the wild thicket. Each trail is arduous, but I want each of you to do your best,\" Ms. Mentira commanded, \"good luck,\" she added quietly. The camp was once again buzzing with excitement, people hurriedly formed groups, hoping to be in a group with their friends and not to be left out. Rain still sat on the gnarly log, barely noticing all the commotion. She still watched Spencer. The fear in his eyes had now subsided; they were soon replaced with that sad benevolence with which she had fallen in love with in the first place. She could tell he wanted to look at Darius, but he dared not to. What was he hiding? Darius looked guilty, as if he had let someone down although he also looked relieved. \"Hey Rain,\" came a chirpy voice, \"you want to be in our group?\" The chirpy voice belonged to Caridad, who was as charitable as her name suggested. She had a thick Mexican accent and loved to take sympathy on the lesser. She was in a group with the other Hispanic kids; Juan, Leonardo and Catalina. \"Uh, sure,\" Rain mumbled, her voice hoarse from disuse. Caridad smiled a sweet smile that bordered between being patronising and being genuinely kind. \"Well then get a move on! Your tent is still up!\" Catalina barked looking at Rain with disdain, a look Rain had seen often. Rain was like the omega wolf in a pack. Anyone, even people who didn't even know her, could boss her around or talk shit to her and she just took it. Rain looked around and realised that hers was the only tent still standing (besides Ms. Mentira's). She quickly stood up (her bum really ached when she did) and began to dissect her tent. Caridad had only asked Rain to be in their group because all the other groups had been formed, and it was an eventuality that Rain would join their group anyway. Caridad liked to do seemingly good deeds, it made her feel like a nice person, but secretly she wished Rain was in another group. She disliked her as much as the next kid. After a couple of minutes of rabid disassembly, Rain was ready. Ms. Mentira took a note of all the groups, and who was in them, and then wished them good luck and bade them farewell. They all travelled together out of the campsite, chatting excitedly as they went, until their paths split into the five aforementioned trails. The classmates all waved their goodbyes, some proposed a race to see which group could make it to the next campsite first, and then they all splintered into their groups and disappeared down their respective trails. Ms. Mentira sat alone in the camp, hers was the only tent still erected, the grass around her was flattened and there were some sweet wrappers littering the place. She decided that she may as well go back to sleep for awhile; she supposed she would need all the rest she could get, it looked like it would be a stressful day ahead. The sweet smell of the dead lingered on the air, and it had attracted more than a few creatures to the glade from which it emanated. A hungry raven perched on a branch overlooking the gruesome scene below it, a small forest wild cat was hiding in the undergrowth, watching and waiting to see if it was safe for him to enter the glade and a pulsating pile of maggots feasted on the cold flesh of the dead bodies strewn around the glade. Garrett's body, slashed in two, lay spread out. Death had frozen the twisted expression of terror on his face. Near him, lay the nearly unrecognizable body of Bailey.[Chapter 5] \"What a crock of shit!\" The wheels of her little blue clio spun viciously along the road and from beneath them came a sheet of dust, standing opaque and defiant in the air for a few seconds, before crumbling and crashing to the roadside like the foam from a wave. \"Really, is this what it had come to?\" Cursing under her breath, Verity Wells fumbled with opening a pair of sunglasses whilst still speeding down the road. Her speed and inattention mattered little anyway as the road was completely clear. She had been driving on it now for twenty minutes and had seen not a soul. She sped past a lonely little sign perched by the roadside; she wasn't sure what colour the sign was originally, but years of sitting in the sun had bleached it into a faint yellow. With a small white arrow it pointed towards 'Inhambane,' which was 50km away and also, her target destination. Though she had been on the road for a long time and she was hungry, tired and her legs ached, the sign did nothing but deepen her dejection. Silly Verity Wells, in her little blue clio in a cloud of dust, speeding desperately in this lonely and forgotten road, humiliated and skimming through the dirt like someone on the run, her face pale with the forced resolve of someone in forced exile, unreachable by usually omnipresent mobile phone signals, just about able to reach any sense of purpose in what she was doing. It was a month ago that Verity had written the article that had ended her career; the article that had caused this banishment. She wasn't aware that when she was typing the article on her laptop, she was actually masterfully assembling the circuit of a bomb and she wasn't aware that when she sent the article to her editor's office, she had pressed the detonator and she wasn't aware of that bomb relentlessly tick-tick-ticking until the day it was published. On that day a great and terrible explosion of public uproar, scathing criticism and threats of legal action had brought her whole world down around her; her boyfriend, friends, job, sense of professionalism, all raining down violently around her like shrapnel. The blast sent her sliding and scurrying into the shelter of her apartment where she holed up for days, alone with her liquor cabinet, phone unplugged, mobile phone switched off, internet disconnected. She was rescued by her brother, who waded through the rubble of hate-mail and clinking empty bottles, picked her up, flung her in his van and departed the city and all the devastation she had left behind. She spent some time recuperating at his home in a small seaside town far far away. Once everything had calmed down, she realised that she couldn't let this finish her, that her passion to write was too great, that her career was not a job but an extension of her, which she could pour into newspapers and magazines, forming little black words which in turn would form the ideas in the minds of her readers, the words on their lips. This was important to her. She couldn't give that up. That article had destroyed her career, but once the fire had burned out and the smoke had cleared, the foundations stood still, damaged and crumbling, but still standing. And like the city rebuilding itself after an air raid, she would rebuild herself, she would come back. But she had to start somewhere, and that somewhere was Inhambane. \"For fuck's sake…\" She groaned, as the underbody of her car screeched in pain whilst bashing off a sharp piece of rock jutting up from the road. \"This fucking road….where even is this place.\" No one had wanted to employ Verity after the scandal her article caused. She did not take each job rejection well, shame and frustration chipped away at her already fragile foundations. She was good, she was a good journalist, a good writer, but it didn't matter if her reputation was destroyed. After a few weeks she got a break, or as close to a break as she was going to get, and landed a job as a columnist for FREAK magazine, a once-monthly glossy that explored the weird wonders of the world. As well as reporting on strange events around the world, pushing the borders of pseudoscience into the realm of pseduotruth and updating old ghost stories (i.e. retelling sexier and more violent versions), it also contained biographies of serial killers, reviewed horror films and video games, printed photos of naked anime girls and had a submit your own story section. It was the monthly wet dream of fourteen year old geeks, would be witches and paranormal fans all over the nation, and to be fair, it did have a pretty good circulation considering the content. FREAK applauded the hiring of Verity Wells as their new \"field journalist;\" her eviscerated reputation brought a new level of intrigue and suspicion to the magazine. She had been with FREAK, for three months now, and her job as field journalist was a poorly paid exploration into the world of weird, which for her was a world of the inane and pointless. So far she had gone to a city two states over to interview a sixty year old woman (who she was sure was at least half demented) who had 'lost time' and would suddenly end up in random places (yes, dementia) and a man who's dog was apparently psychic. She wrote the columns to the best of her ability, trying to write them eerie and tantalising but found the subject matter such bullshit that she felt she was undermining everything she ever was. Her next assignment was; \"The Missing Tourists of Inhambane.\" Apparently, twenty three years ago a group of tourists were in a bus exploring Inhambane and the areas around it, such as Mayflower Way and the Europium Plains when they all went missing. The area is huge and sparsely populated. Apart from a few random farmsteads, the only real settlement in the region is Inhambane, which you could barely call a town. There was some intense media coverage and a thorough police investigation. The bus was eventually found in a gorge, half-submerged in a fast flowing river in the heart of Mayflower Way. Some of the bodies were recovered and were horribly disfigured, and it was difficult to identify them all. The police report concluded that the bus was caught up in a freak hurricane which had then recently passed through Mayflower and close to Inhambane, exactly around the time the tourists would have been in the area. They decided that none of the tourists would have known the weather forecast because there was no phone signal or radio reception that far out there. Officially the storm forced the bus off the narrow road, down a steep drop along a cliff side and into the gorge, irreparably destroying the vehicle, crushing most of the tourists – which would explain the disfigurement of the bodies. Only a few bodies were recovered, the rest, the police had decided, must have been washed away in the river in which the bus had landed. Although a second police search lasted for a few months, no other bodies were ever retrieved. Media coverage pretty much stopped and as the years wore on, the event faded from recent memory. Apart from a few references made to the event in documentaries on natural disasters, the only other times it was mentioned was by conspiracy theorists who had commented that the bodies in the photos looked too disfigured to be crush injuries, and one of the tourist's sisters who had a copy of the travel itinerary stating that they weren't supposed to be near that specific area at the time the hurricane was said to have passed through. FREAK now decided that it was time they sent their own personal investigator into the scene to print a little column on the event. Verity guessed that she'd have to show up in Inhambane, talk to the backward locals about what happened, listen to their crackpot theories and a few local ghost stories, write the story in such a way that it seems vague and dubious and get a few snapshots to tie it all up. She hated doing this, writing a story like this was like going against her ethical journalism code. All those tourists had died in a freak accident, it wasn't fair to them or their relatives to use their misfortune as a story about how they'd been massacred by a roaming band of cannibals or murdered by a witch. But she had to begin somewhere. She was professionally at the lowest point in her career, but she was continually rebuilding herself. FREAK may not have been the pinnacle of media excellence, but it was a decent start. Her plan was to write for the magazine for a few months, maybe a year, then to start freelancing as a political journalist (her previous job). She knew no respectable papers would want to print any of her work, but she still had some friends in the business that refused to abandon her, even when everyone else had turned on her. The world of journalism was as capricious as the tides of the sea, always changing, always pushing and pulling. She knew that if she could convince her friends to give her one shot, she'd find the best story she could and publish another bomb. This time however it would blow everyone else out of the water, leaving her the only ship sailing on an unsteady sea whose currents had finally started to bring her back to the shore.[Chapter 6] TRAIL 1: THE THICKET Dazzling rays of the sun's light blasted through the arid air, scorching the thicket. The lazy buzzing of hovering insects and the crunching steps of feet on dry, harsh grass made up the background noise to the otherwise silent travelling group. The air was thick with pine and sweat. Blake stopped and glugged down some water kept ice cold in his flask, it tasted like heaven. He moved on quickly, before the other \"alphas\" in his group had a chance to catch up with him. He used his walking stick like a machete, his sinew shining as he sliced a pathway through the thicket. He was leading the group towards the second camping spot marked on his map. His group had chosen this trail as it appeared to be the quickest way to get to the spot (located above a waterfall), pretty much just keep heading straight. Other groups had tried to claim the trail and protested but were easily shouted down. However Blake had not considered how exhausting it was to literally mow his way through the undergrowth. They were, in any case, making good progress, and would likely be the first group to reach the camping spot, just in time to jump into the cool plunge pool of the waterfall under the midday sun. With this driving thought in mind, Blake swiped again and again, taking down more vegetation. Blake was easily the most athletic out of all the alphas. He was known to the others as being 'hyper-active' or jittery. Always moving and always planning something, he was never very good at just chilling out. He masked it as well as he could, but Blake was quite an anxious individual. Although he was happy with his standing amongst his friends and school, he was unnerved by the littlest of things and was always edgy. Ever since he was around fourteen, he began to become hypochondriacal. If he couldn't concentrate properly on his homework he might have a brain tumour, a typical teenage spot he had could be a malignant skin cancer, a cold was pneumonia. He became wary of germs and washed his hands until they cracked and bled. He exercised for hour's everyday, strengthening his body to fend off invisible infections. He was afraid of sickness and disease; he never wanted to end up like his mother, stroked out, lying diagonal on a chair with half her face zombied, dribbling, and unable to chew. He NEVER wanted someone else to have to pull down his pants and change him because he'd wet himself like a baby, the way he had to change his mother at least a few times a day. His heart was racing; he felt that familiar, hot, panic thinking about his mother at home, in the gloom of her dark bedroom. He thrashed his stick around him harder, tearing a pathway through the thicket. And then he stopped. He was shocked. Curled up on the floor, half dust, bleached yellow by the unforgiving sun with two terrible dark holes for eyes, a little skeleton sat and looked at him. It lay between the buttress roots of an ancient tree in a small copse clearing Blake had cut his way into. The skull was cracked as were some ribs, eerie reminders of a forgotten trauma. Its legs had disintegrated and were gone, but its torso and upper limbs were in tact, adorned with a twisting vine which had sprouted small pink flowers, sickeningly pretty. The whole scene was silently terrifying. \"Shit!\" The others had caught up with him, and their faces were equally as shocked to find this skeleton of a secret death. TRAIL 2: THE SWAMP Leonardo Benigno Valladares' eyes were ovoid and coloured like little chocolate drops. This, coupled with their slightly slanted appearance, always gave the impression he was sleepy. His hair was messy, but the kind of messy that looked cool, and always crumbled down slightly over his sleepy eyes. His jaw was well-defined, almost equine. He was tallish for his age. He was playful yet relaxed and the way he didn't seem to care or delve into class politics, provided him with an air of maturity some of the other kids didn't have. Some of the girls (especially Catalina) felt a strong sense of security in him which obviously drew them towards him. He may have been perceived to possess all these qualities, but at the end of the day he was a kid and had his own silly ideas and insecurities like everyone else. But his quiet confidence had landed him the role of default leader of his little travelling group, and with his compass and map in hand, he did his best to try and lead. He came atop a small grassy hummock, unscrunched his scrunched up map and tried to make sense of the confusing landscape in front of him. His group had been landed with the swamp trail, the trail that no other group wanted to take. \"Ah fuck man,\" Juan raged. He had tried to argue with some of the others about fair distribution of the trails, but to no avail. Leonardo, however, swallowed his initial disappointment and salvaged what positivity he could from their imposition. Ok…it will be challenging, and harder to find practical trails through the swamp without having to wade waist deep in shitty bog water, but that means that we'll get a better experience, and maybe actually learn more. That will count for something in the long run, right? In front of him was a mass of tangled wood and vine; strange trees with grey, gnarled skin whose trunks twisted and turned as they grew into the air. These trees grew so close together, curling around each other in an aggressive, florid tapestry, almost blocking out all light. They were decorated with all kinds of creeping vegetation; patches of a sickly yellow fungus clinging to bark, large white flowers blushing a slight pink as they opened to the morning sun and thick, wet vines suspended from branches. They grew from an expansive mass of swamp; stagnant tea coloured water ever flooding the forest floor, a viscous scum emanating a malodorous air so powerful it almost stung the eyes and throat. It was covered by a layer of thick brownish algae. It occasionally bubbled methane gas. Leonardo's diligent little troupe formed a semicircle around him. \"Shit, this place stinks…why the fuck did we take this trail,\" Juan continued to grumble. \"Doesn't smell too pretty…\" Catalina remarked flatly, in a dour tone, lifting one hand to shield the nose of her otherwise expressionless face. Taciturn and aloof, she didn't speak much, and when she did it was usually to express dissatisfaction. Caridad scrunched up her nose, and class loser Rain who had tagged along with their group surveyed the area through bleak eyes, and said nothing at all. \"Guys its okay, I think if we aim left a bit, there's a solid path we can take through this swamp, that cuts right through to the other side. It might be a bit tricky to find, but if there are five of us looking it shouldn't be too difficult,\" Leonardo turned and said to the four pissed off faces looking at him. \"Aint no way I'm wading through that piss water,\" Juan shot while shaking his head; he was still annoyed that the alpha group took the easiest trail. \"We won't have too! Leo says we can find a trail!\" Caridad chirped. \"I don't see no trail!\" \"We'll find it,\" Leonardo reasoned, his voice calm. \"I believe Leo, let's move,\" Catalina stated bluntly. Her face was beautiful but still, her dark eyes were beautiful but hard. She moved off in front of the group, taking the lead and aiming to the left of the wood in front of her, like Leonardo had suggested. When with Catalina, there was always a feeling that she was detached. She was perpetually distant from those around her, and the gap she left in between was frozen and unsettling. The disquiet she expelled however brought her respect; when she spoke people listened and when she moved, they followed. And so the group set out again, down the slight slope towards the swamp forest. Caridad caught up alongside Juan and leaned her little head against his naked shoulder, playfully comforting him as he continued to complain. He lightened up a little with her touch. Rain lagged behind, mute and seemingly absent, her mind elsewhere. Leonardo caught up with Catalina. \"Thanks for helping me out;\" Leonardo said to Catalina, \"it can be hard leading a group of people sometimes, especially when Juan starts kicking off.\" Leonardo turned and mischievously threw a small clod of wet dirt at Juan who now had one arm draped over Caridad's shoulder. \"What the fuck man!\" Juan shouted while ducking. Caridad sniggered. \"It's okay,\" Catalina paused, \"you're good at it.\" Leonardo took Catalina's compliment silently and shot her an askance glance. He knew not to poke and prod her too much with words. He knew she was a tough girl, he knew her family. He knew most of the Hispanic families in the area they lived. \"Being a leader isn't easy…\" he remembered his Dad sigh once as he sat down, bleary eyed and looking old after a day of work. He remembered watching his Dad idly twirl his fork in his hand, too distracted by undisclosed thoughts even to eat. He knew his Dad took his job very seriously and happenings throughout the day always seemed to leave him in a state of obsessional preoccupation. His Dad was a local politician and as such fought hard for the rights of the Hispanic community. He was always organising something in which to get the community involved; fund raisers, fairs, cultural days. He praised students from the community who did well at school and got into college. He rejoiced in families whose children had respectable public sector jobs. He loved his community like how he did his own family, and his community respected him greatly in return. But while all their successes buoyed his fat and hopeful heart, their mistakes hurt him deeply. His particular community had a lot of problems; unemployment, gang issues, drug dealing, domestic abuse. All these incidents would hurt his Dad like it was his very own children who were betraying him. Like a naïve child who keeps returning to an abusive parent, he would cling on, taking each blow and kick, hoping that when the sun rises the next day, everything could change. And Leonardo loved his Dad's drive, his trust. When he was old enough to have some insight, he recognised some of his Dad's traits in himself. For example, he loved Juan; he was his best friend, ever since they had been pretending to be power rangers together as kids. They had grown up together, almost living in each other's shoes, running with the same group of friends, playing on the same soccer team. They had shared secrets with each other, whispered only in shadows, their faces concealed by the dark. Leonardo knew how Juan had hated that he was small for his age, and that he had a younger brother he'd never met, that was living with his aunt in Oaxaca. Leonardo had always been enthralled with Juan's imagination. Juan could sit for hours, his feet dangling from his top bunk (when Leonardo stayed over, Juan always got the top bunk) telling stories of an intricate and immense quality, and Leonardo clung, half-hypnotised, to his every word. When they started school, Juan was top of his class at language, and in middle school excelled at English literature. And then he just…stopped. Stopped working, stopped playing sports, and stopped doing nearly anything. He had started hanging with some of the gangbangers on their estate and selling weed. He quickly got a reputation as one of the other druggie kids at school. It broke Leonardo's heart to see Juan fade into a weary eyed, clueless mess, always tired and paranoid. Why Juan, why did you have to do that? \"Because what else am I gonna do? This is what you're supposed to do…\" Juan mumbled once, stoned. Leonardo hated how he noticed some of the other kids beginning to avoid Juan. He hated how Juan accepted carelessly that he was being pushed to the fringes of his year group. He hated how Juan used to be on the school soccer team, used to be winning prizes for essay writing, and used to have aspirations. He knew Juan was so much more than just another druggie loser kid, than just another waster, than just another…spic . TRAIL 1: THE THICKET Blake had for the moment forgotten his mother and his anxiety. All he could focus on was those dark, skeletal portals staring dead at him. His group had gathered around him. Everyone was silent. A weighted silence hung in the air, an apprehensive tension almost tangible. The group stood like statues, transfixed by the dead statue that returned their stare. Then a rustling and the snap of a lighter. Brooke lit a menthol cigarette and turned away. She looked left, and right, and then up into the sun, a glowing fireball stuck in the deep blue sky. She tried to soak up its heat, its warmth, but couldn't help shake the unearthly chill that engulfed her body. \"I wonder,\" she murmured weakly, \"how he died.\" The effect of Brooke's crackly voice was like that of a witch recanting a spell; the tension dispersed at once. Normality dripped into the surreal and the shock dissipated. Tristan shook his head and sniggered. The leader of the alphas, he worked excessively on keeping his cool and was relieved in the knowledge that no one would've paid attention to his few minutes of quiet vexation. \"A fucking skeleton,\" he almost shouted, \"what the fuck!\" He looked around at Blake to laugh at the absurdity of their situation, but Blake was obviously still shaken by their find. Instead Tristan found Xavier's eyes, who took after his leader and spat a raucous laugh. \"This is creepy…\" Taylor, Alpha Queen, whispered to herself, and moved to stand by and pet Brooke who still faced away from the skeleton. \"It's okay,\" Brooke murmured and gently brushed Taylor off. \"However he died,\" Tristan stated, \"it was a long time ago. This thing is almost rotted away.\" \"Man we should get out of here,\" Blake suddenly started, \"this thing is stressin' me out!\" Blake looked afraid, his eyes bulging, their whites contrasting against his black skin. \"Chill out man, its dead!\" Tristan was exasperated by Blake's uneasiness. \"It's dead!\" To prove his point, Tristan thought it wise to heave a nearby rock in the air, smashing it right into the skeleton. With a loud crack, the little skeleton's skull was destroyed in a dusty, white explosion; fragments of bone and rotten teeth flew into the air, littering the forest floor as they fell. The group once again fell silent. As the dust slowly settled, they observed the clumps of bone and white-yellowish powder. Again they became uneasy, not because they were afraid, but because they felt the sense of a wrong having been committed. They felt like Tristan's rock was the final desecration to the memory of someone who died a painful death long before. \"Sometimes, you are actually a complete dick.\" Taylor's words were spoken not with venom or reaction, but flat and categorically. It was amazing how her face, so sweet and pretty could darken so violently when annoyed. It was the look on her face rather than her comment that riled Tristan. \"What? I was just fucking playing around. I'm pretty sure it didn't hurt him!\" Tristan called out, but Taylor had picked up her backpack and began marching off into the thicket. Blake cast him a steely look and followed after Taylor. \"Ah man,\" Tristan sighed and flung his backpack around his shoulder. He walked off with Xavier, his right hand man, who stayed with him. Tristan tried to shrug off destroying the skeleton, explaining how inconsequential it was. In reality he too was a bit ashamed of what he'd done, which usually meant he'd become angry with himself, which meant he'd take his anger out on someone else (probably Xavier). He didn't know why he'd done it; he often acted on impulse – for a reaction? was it because he feared that ugly thing? was it just so he could crush something? …He wasn't sure. Brooke lingered behind in the copse, still staring at the pathetic little skeleton on the forest floor. The temporal part of its skull was still partly in tact. Its cracked eye was still staring, this time a sorrowful gaze. Brooke murmured something to the skeleton, half an apology, half a prayer. She grabbed her pack and readied to follow the others when she noticed a little glint from the chalky, osseous ruin before her. It came from a small item, gingerly clasped in the skeleton's crumbling fingers. What is that? She stepped closer to have a look.[Chapter 7] A ghost story may not be memorable for its narrative, or its twist, but its emotion can linger for a long time. A ghost story strips away the comforts of the listener, mutating their usual security into something unrecognisable and temporarily replacing their warm reality with eerie cold. It was that same ghost story consciousness that Verity was experiencing when she finally rolled into Inhambane. A strange little town, not very big, with dusty half-paved lanes snaking through run-down sandblasted estates. The town was built upon the sides of a valley, and its' roads ran down into the valley plain like rivers, all converging in the town centre, marked by a whitewashed, crooked church. Pulling up into this lonesome town was like entering a time slip and falling into the past. It was late when Verity reached the town (which was extremely difficult to find). She saw only a few swarthy, perplexed faces as her car scratched its way towards the only B&B; there was. She pulled to a stop and got out of her car, letting the warm night air kiss her softly; a little reward at the end of her journey. She made her way to the B&B.; Trail 3 The third trail ran across a ridge, and was interrupted in the middle by a steep ravine. The trek was mostly uphill and the little travelling crew complained abundantly about all their aching calves. Wesley and Nizhoni were advancing in front of the others, and there was an unspoken competition between them as to who could clear the ravine and reach the next camp spot first. Wesley would occasionally lag behind a bit so that Nizhoni would feel he was backing off, only to spring up beside her again (he was only falling behind so he could sneak a peek at Nizhoni's insouciant ass-swing). Behind them was Cadence who hadn't spoken much since they had set off. She looked troubled, and was obviously still concerned about the disappearance of her best friend Jocelyn from camp that morning. Behind her was Amit, whose glasses caught and reflected the harsh sun giving him little flaming eyeballs. Trailing behind him was Brody, who looked anything but amused. He was thin, messy-haired and probably coming down (this was the first time in awhile that he hadn't been perpetually stoned). Nizhoni had mostly shrugged off Wesley's flirty chat during the journey. She was entranced by the surrounding scenery. Though their trail was arguably the most difficult, when they ascended the ridge and rose out of the forest, the view was amazing. A sea of green, undulating slightly in the sporadic breeze, cut through by pewter towers of rock. It was a beautiful scene gilded by the sun and blurred by its heat, reminiscent of a water colour painting. The view may have meant more to Nizhoni, because it was a part of her heritage. Walking around Mayflower Way was like a little tour through her ancestry, through the half-told shadowy memories of her own past. Her grandmothers voice came back to her, it sounded like pebbles crushed under shoes. She remembered vividly her grandmother's face half-lit by the flames of the cooking pit in their front garden. Her papery lips were small, and always had billows of smoke coming from them. Nizhoni experienced overwhelming nostalgia when thinking about those nights. After her family had finished cooking and eating their succotash and cornbread, her grandmother would straighten her back, tap on her wooden pipe and ceremoniously load it with tobacco and some mint leaves. Everyone in her family knew then that she was readying to tell a tale, and they'd all make themselves comfortable as her rasping voice sounded out over the quiet crackling of the fire, inviting them into a heady reverie…. Trail 4 Being a closet gay, Spencer had developed countless tricks and techniques to hide his own nature. He made sure to walk in the right way, to use words he otherwise probably wouldn't, to back-slap, occasionally wrestle, endlessly talk about pussy and appreciate jokes about shit. He made sure to stifle the desires that threatened to burn away every thread of the cloak he'd pull tight around himself, or at least he had done until Darius. This was his deep secret. If he could lie so expertly about his own being and deny his very own soul, then what did it matter to lie about more inconsequential things? And so Spencer often wondered what everyone else's secrets were, and he more than anyone believed that in this teenage life, no one was really who they said they were or what they wanted to be. And he wondered if they too struggled. He wondered these things as he stared around at his adventuring group. They had chosen the trail that initially cut through the forest but eventually landed them out on a rocky prominence that continued to rise until it joined to the eastern side of Moon Hill, where the campsite they were all aiming for was. Ms Mentira had stated that this trail was the one that would involve rock-climbing, and although the steadily rising path was quite steep, there was no need to climb, yet. Everyone was puffing and panting and so conversation was minimal. Spencer wiped some sweat from his brow and glanced around at everyone, wondering if they were thinking of their secrets. He surveyed Sunkanmi (everyone called him Sunks) for a few seconds. Sunkanmi was tall and had a leonine, proud face. In a group he was usually taciturn and aloof, but actually quite warm once engaged individually. He kept himself to himself in class as he had other friends in the year above and didn't seem bothered whether he fitted in with this class or not. Spencer envied his maturity at this age where everyone else's plastic personalities were melting and reforming all the time. Sunks understood that knowing where you fit in, can also mean knowing where you don't. Spencer couldn't puzzle out what the composed Sunks' secret could be, and so he switched his gaze to Keeley. She had her chestnut brown eyes fixed to the rocky ground ahead, probably praying that every step would be the last of the trek. She hated sports and physical work but loved fashion, which was reflected in her highly stylised appearance. Spencer found her to be sweet, indolent and hedonistic. Hers was the tinkling laughter heard in the background of all the parties, the first pair of gyrating hips on the dance-floor and she was always the last one standing after one of their frantic bacchanals. He wondered what secrets this joyful nymph hid behind her salacious smile. \"Shit!\" Madison's scream stopped everyone in their steps, and shattered Spencer's ruminations, snapping him back to reality. He looked to where her trembling finger was pointing. There, just above their trail was a small fissure in the rock-wall, whose opening was half covered with vines. And peering from within it; was a face. A pale face, crowned with mottled dirty hair. On a small, squashed nose perched a pair of jam-jar glasses that made its owner's eyes difficult to see. This strange little face watched them eerily for a few moments, and then came forward out of the rock. Trail 3 Wesley looked askance at Nizhoni. He was frustrated; he so wanted her to want him. Or just talk to him, reciprocate a bit, but she was off in her own world. Her pointed, coppery face scanned the scenery around him and she barely noticed Wesley's existence. He didn't take well to being ignored. He had always admired Nizhoni from afar but knew little about her. She had few friends but this didn't seem to bother her. He knew she was sporty and excelled in the athletics team, and she was fiercely proud of her Nakota heritage. She attracted some jealousy from a few girls in the class, probably because for a teenage girl she seemed so collected and unbothered, and for these reasons their jealousy never really amounted to anything. Then suddenly Nizhoni turned to Wesley and her wide eyes stared straight into his own. \"You know,\" she said, \"my grandmother used to tell me stories about this place.\" \"This place?\" \"Yeah, this area…Mayflower, it's where my…tribe originated from.\" \"Really?\" Wesley was curious now, \"what kind of stories?\" \"Well..\" Nizhoni began, straightened her back and began retelling one of her Grandmother's tales… A Long Time Ago The Minisatonwanbi people were known to their neighbouring tribes as a powerful community. Their semi-nomadic clan was one of the largest and most sprawling, and occupied most of the vales and dells of Mayflower Way. Their name, 'Water People' was a reference to their symbiotic relationship with the white torrents that gushed through their homeland and their main camp - situated on the silt plains of the mighty Makawee river. There they grew their crops on her fertile soil, played and bathed in her swirling currents, ate the fish that swam her streams and rode her temperamental watercourse on their expertly crafted canoes. Indeed the River was the life vein that ran straight through the heart of the Water People's community. One night of each week they offered up prayers to the river, chanting her name in their circle dance and carefully placing gifts into her flow. In charge of these rituals was Mapiya, the Chieftian's daughter. She was fifteen years old and was being groomed as the new Spiritual Leader of the tribe. Koko, the old shaman who currently held the job had been ailing for awhile. Her weather-beaten face framed by her stringy grey hair, once plump and serene, was now thin and pained. She was dying of a nameless disease, and she knew it – but she was desperate to pass on her mystical teachings to Mapiya, who would succeed her. She was adamant that the traditions and culture of her people be protected, and passed on to the next generation before she died. What would her community be without its spirituality? Mapiya was a delicate girl, but a sharp and eager learner. She quickly mastered the arts of prayer and dance, herbal alchemy, extispicy and storytelling. Through the purple smoke of the camp fire, her sleek body would twist and turn in the ritualistic water dance Koko had drilled into her. Her fingers would work quickly, tearing at leaves and preparing roots for the elephant sap salves used to treat the wounds of the tribes' hunters. Her words would echo out over the camp at night, lulling her people into a trance as she retold stories of a forgotten age. Koko was confident that she had found an appropriate replacement in Mapiya. Mapiya was adored and celebrated by everyone in the tribe; she was their shining example of everything a woman should be. Her marriage to a respected young hunter, Powwaw, was quickly arranged on her fifteen birthday, and their engagement was a night of excited revelry. Mapiya danced with as much intensity as anyone at the party, her beautiful robes spinning, her bejewelled headdress glinting in the firelight. No one suspected that underneath her modest smile and humble elegance, lived a frightening desire to flee. Mapiya had not chosen to be a shaman and she had not chosen to be Powwaw's wife. But she had chosen Arrow. Arrow was a sturdy warrior from the neighbouring Tokanbi tribe, previous enemies of the Water People. Recently the two tribes had negotiated an uneasy truce and occasionally would meet to trade furs or canoes, but mostly avoided each other and crossed not into the others' territory. Almost a year ago, Arrow had been out hunting deer. The chase had been long and tortuous, lasting for hours. Eventually the deer tired and Arrow was able to land a final killing shot from his bow. The deer staggered momentarily and then collapsed. With its death, a weary Arrow immediately took light of his surroundings and realised that he had unknowingly crossed the border into Water People territory. The truce had recently been established but if a Tokanbi warrior was spotted wandering these woods, he would surely be attacked and the truce would come undone. He made quick to collect his dead prey and head back to his homeland, when he was chanced upon by a young girl - Mapiya. Arrow and Mapiya stood at a fair distance for awhile, both surveying each other, both wary but curious. Mapiya's pretty face was somewhat blotchy, like she had been crying. They watched each other for a long time, and then Mapiya stepped forward, brazenly and unafraid. \"You look like you have been running for a long time,\" she said and took a buckskin flask from inside her tunic. Arrow carefully took the flask, uncorked it, tested the water and then greedily drank the whole thing dry. \"Thank-you.\" After their initial meeting, the two started a romance acted out only in the secret glades and obscure valleys on the border of the Tokanbi land. They knew their relationship would disgrace their respective tribes, but they were bound together by something neither could resist, and so their love flourished quietly in the still forest. And on the night of Mapiya's engagement, Arrow was waiting patiently in their usual spot. They had long been planning running away together, taking to the wild and escaping the prejudices of their tribes. However Mapiya's looming marriage had forced them to put into action their plans, and for weeks they had been hoarding supplies, as well as a canoe, ready for their flight. As the engagement party waned, and the tired revellers all flopped to the floor around the campfire, Koko took to her seat as the tribes-people all called for her to tell a tale. As she began her story, Mapiya saw this as her only chance to flee. She feigned thirst and slipped back to her tent for a flagon of water. Then she easily slipped out of sight and made for the forest. She ran as fast as she could but she hadn't planned this part, and her ceremonial garb made running difficult. Once she was under the cover of tree and bough she calmed down a bit, caught her breath and continued to follow the well trodden path she knew would take her to Arrow. When she came upon him, his handsome face highlighted by the white of the moon, she knew she had made the right choice. They came to each other and embraced. They were both somewhat nervous and began readying their supplies. Powwaw had, however, not been so entranced by Koko's story. His mind was wandering and racing with thoughts of Mapiya. He had previously been out hunting with Puma, one of the other warriors. Puma had told him stories about a woman's body, of a girl he had taken in the woods once. He told of how good a feeling it was to be in a girl. Ever since, Powwaw was unable to concentrate, even his hunting had suffered. He would find himself staring at women and girls all over camp, imagining tearing off their shawls and feeling their warm flesh. He would find himself hardening and would have to go off into the forest a few times a day to relieve himself, spilling his seed on the leafy floor. And so when he saw Mapiya creep from the back of her tent into the darkness of the forest, he followed her almost automatically. He wasn't quite sure what he expected would happen or what he would do when he caught up with her, but he knew what he wanted to happen. His mind wandered back to Mapiya dancing, how she thrust her body forwards, her back arching, her hips spinning as her smooth, buttery skin glowed in the firelight. He felt his cock growing again under his breechcloth, pulsating and begging for some kind of satiety. The night sky was overcast, but even without the moon's light, Mapiya left an obvious trail. Yet, on a few occasions Powwaw almost lost where he was going as he was so distracted. He never even wondered why Mapiya had taken off into the woods in the first place. Until he found her. Mapiya was bent over, wrapping some salted meat in deer skin and handing it to a tall, well-muscled man who was loading it carefully into a canoe. The light was poor but he could tell by the man's height and wide nose, that he was of Tonkanbi origin. She was planning to run away! With a man from a different tribe no less! The whore! The heat in his loins now rose like lava into his chest, his jaws clenched so hard it sounded like stone grinding off stone, he was sure they would hear it. But Mapiya and her man paid no heed to Powwaw, hiding amongst the trees. He watched cautiously, to be certain of what was happening. When hunting you had to make sure you knew all about your quarry; where were they likely to run when startled, how could they defend themselves, were they alone? These things you needed to consider before you made your strike. Mapiya leaned over and placed a tender, reassuring hand on the Tonkanbi man's tense, sinewy shoulder and the muscles around his back immediately relaxed. And that moment was too much for Powwaw. How could she touch another man with such tenderness on their engagement night? He suddenly leapt forward from his hiding spot, howling a water cry as he went. But at that moment he was not water, he was fire. His blood was bubbling oil, his eyes red, his skin flaming. He had not brought his infamous white-wood bow with him but he did have a small curved throwing dagger he always kept sheathed to his leg. With one fluid movement and a hunter's precision, the dagger skimmed through the air and found a soft little spot under the Tonkanbi man's chin. In one breath, the great and beautiful man Arrow flopped to the floor like he was no more than a tree that had been felled. Rigid and motionless he lay there, like he had never known life at all, redness leaking from the hole in his neck. His eyes bulged, his face shocked. And above him Powwaw seemed to tower, his hands trembling, his chest pumping in and out. Mapiya was screeching like a girl-child, crying for help. And then her cries softened to a sob and then to a gasp when she saw the look in Powwaw's eyes. His face was terrible, steam was rising off him in the cold night air and his eyes were dark but blazing, like burning coals. And Mapiya was afraid. She spilled to the forest floor and spread out like water, trying to drain away… Trail 4 The woman had slid down the steep slant of the rock-wall with an ease that suggested she'd been skipping around the rocks and woods of Mayflower Way ever since she was a baby. She was a strange creature, short and with a slightly hunched back, swathed and hooded in a tattered cloak. Her face was grimy, her hair was black with dirt, but may have been blonde. Her lips were small and pink with a thick, sticky line of saliva between them. Her legs were held apart, her stance readied and her body constantly rocking back and forth; like some kind of strange tick. She stood before them, surveying them, her head tilted slightly. Spencer was immediately alarmed. The others in his group were silent, watching the weird woman carefully. It felt like they had accidentally come upon a feral animal, and they wanted to back away slowly and quietly. This woman smelled musty and her eyes were magnified by the huge lenses in her greasy glasses. She gave the impression she came from a backward and forgotten world which filled everyone with a disturbing terror. Her breathing was audible; deep panting and wheeze coming from her open, slimy mouth. With one tiny booted foot, she took a step forward. Immediately the group jumped two steps back. \"Miss….are you...what do you want?\" Spencer stuttered. And suddenly the woman's head span round, and she fixed her distorted eyes on him. Then her head started bobbing up and down violently, her breathing quickened and started to sound choked. Was that laughter? Was she laughing? And as suddenly as she had landed amongst them, she took off again, tearing through them like a bullet. Sunks side-stepped quickly and Madison almost dived out of the way. Spencer turned and watched the weird woman speed down the rocky slope and disappear, her cloak billowing after her as she went. The group sat stunned for a minute, then stared at each other wide eyed. Madison leaned in to her boyfriend Cole and gave him a hug, comforting herself as much as him. Keeley giggled hysterically, breaking the silence. \"Redneck freak!\" Cole shouted after the woman, though he knew she couldn't hear him. Spencer stared, shaken and perturbed by this strange encounter. Who the hell was she ? He stared down the trail to where he had last seen her and wondered what other secrets Mayflower Way was hiding.[Chapter 8] Trail 5: The River Natsuki Sano's skin was burned raw where she held tightly onto the rough, hempen cord. Though the sun shone brightly overhead, the cold currents of Racoon River washed around her, numbing her legs. She was waist deep and taking her time crossing to the other bank. The water was rushing so fast she couldn't make out the river bed beneath, and so she kept stumbling and occasionally stubbing her toe on a pointed rock. She held tight to the guide-rope; the flow was very strong, unlike her. Her arms were thin and bony and stuck out like pins from her slight wisp of a body. Eventually she neared the bank and Darius was there to pull her ashore. \"Its freezing!\" he exclaimed, but you could tell from his delighted grin that he was loving it. Natsuki smiled her thank-you and immediately began to shake herself dry like a dog. Ideally she'd whip her towel out and give her icicle legs a good dry, but there was no time. They were the last group to set out and so had to hurry along their trail to reach the campsite. Their trail ran alongside Raccoon River, a lesser river divergent from the great Makawee River whose roar could be heard for miles around Mayflower Way. It ran directly to Moon Hill where they would camp that night. However the trail on either bank was invariably interrupted by a steep cliff-face or impassable undergrowth so they always had to cross to the opposite bank, using guide ropes that had already been put in place by previous hikers. And so they continued zigzagging up Raccoon River for hours, freezing, drying and then freezing again. Natsuki hated it. At least her best friend Hitsumi was here with her, shouting in their native Japanese to keep their spirits up. Both were exchange students from Ueno High School in Tokyo, and were spending six months in the USA to practice their English and gain a better understanding of American culture. What they had discovered so far was both exciting and disheartening. They could talk for hours about the differences between Japanese and American society, and laugh at how alien some things were to them. However to Natsuki, this was also the problem. She had always been alien, even back home in Tokyo. She was actually born in California, when her father used to have a business position there. They had lived there for a few years and some of Natsuki's earliest memories were of a glowing sun, and sand and the smell of sea salt. When her family were to move back to Japan, Natsuki remembered screaming and refusing to go, and in protest tying herself to her bed post, with a little childish knot that easily came undone. However it didn't take long for her to settle into her quiet, subdued life in Misato, one of the faceless satellite towns of Tokyo. She never really came to completely understand, or become one with Japanese culture and so always felt a little on the edges. Her father and mother worked so hard and relentlessly, and Natsuki tried to emulate their stringent example at school but even through all her cramming and studying, she sometimes stopped and glimpsed through all her work to see nothing on the other side. She felt claustrophobic in the silent, tense subway journeys around Tokyo, surrounded by many sleepy-eyed businessmen. Once on the train she had to use her phone to make an urgent call to her mother about some school matter, and an older man shouted at her for being disrespectful. She was so ashamed and apologised profusely, inwardly resenting all her fake assuagement and forced pleasantry. At night she and faithful Hitsumi would wander the hushed, lonesome streets of Misato, or occasionally she would go alone. They would maybe discuss some gossip from school but mostly they'd talk about the future, about how they would flee Misato. Hitsumi wanted to move to Shinjuku or Roppongi district of Tokyo and become a party girl, eventually maybe own her own club. That could be a lucrative business in those areas. Natsuki wanted to get out of Tokyo altogether and go travelling. She was stubbornly occidental and dreamed of Europe or America. She realised that she spent half of her time wishing she was somewhere else, searching for a sense of belonging she lost long ago or never truly had. One time a girl from her Ueno class, Megumi, brought photos of her family trip to Uruguay into school and Natsuki pored over them for hours, looking at the wonders of that strange country far away. She looked at the faces of all the people and wondered what they were like, and how they would never know she existed or know that she had looked at their faces and wondered about them. When the exchange programme opportunity came along, Natsuki leapt at the chance dragging Hitsumi along with her. She was so excited about returning to USA and joining an American high school. However only a few days into the exchange her intimate fears were realised; she didn't really fit in here either…The kids were boisterous and although friendly (especially some of the girls complemented her on her fashion style), never really completely connected with her. Was that her, a dullard from a different country? Or were these kids actually somewhat uninteresting? She wasn't sure, but she knew her loneliness intensified in America. She wasn't with her family and it was worsened by the fact that the more extroverted Hitsumi was fitting in better than she was. One day she saw Wesley checking her out in class. Wesley had a bit of a reputation and she knew he had done stuff with at least a few of the other girls in class. He was quite handsome in a boyish way. When she saw Wesley look at her like that, it filled her with a kind of relief. The fact that this American boy could want her in that way, made her feel like a person, like she could fit in. Maybe if he fucked her, she would become real and her grey alien skin would peel away. She had lamely tried to seduce him, once by wearing tight hot pants in school (for which she was scolded by Ms. Mentira) and once at a party, she mumbled a few words to him; he was nice and spoke with her but she later saw him stumbling away with Keeley. This must have been their seventh or eighth river crossing and Natsuki was shivering with the cold. Darius splashed the water around him at a screaming Riley, as Hitsumi (whose English had improved greatly) gossiped with Regan behind her. They made it to the river bank and after resuming hiking for a few minutes they turned a bend to come to the foot of a beautiful water fall. Water like liquid crystal spilled down the grey cliff face, singing as it went and scintillating in the late afternoon sun. Above the waterfall were a hill and a plateau – Moon Hill! They'd reached the campsite, and from the looks of it, were the first ones there! Whooping they raced to ascend the steep hill beside the water fall. Although it looked like they would be the first team to arrive, there was always still a chance that another group coming from a different direction could swoop in and steal the victory. Morale was high and Hitsumi's laughter pealed like a bell over the valley, as Darius and Riley dashed ahead. Natsuki smiled and tried so hard to be as excited as everyone else, but instead of laughing and cheering, that little voice inside her heart was dreary and exhausted. Moon Hill A fire raged in the centre of Moon Hill, its flaming tendrils dancing in the night air and reaching to the stars above. Surrounding it sat the entire class of weary hikers, feasting themselves on roasted sausage and burgers, and glugging bottles of coke. Spirits were high and laughter echoed out over Moon Hill, spilling into the forest below. \"Watch it!\" Brooke growled as Tristan and Cole wrestled nearby, rolling in the grass, encouraged by the cheers and jeers of the other students. Most had gathered around to watch the spectacle, much to the dismay of Ms. Mentira, who was trying to calm the rowdy group. Through the billowing smoke of the fire, Spencer gave Darius a furtive wink, which failed to go unnoticed by a curious Rain, lurking in the background. Further from the spectacle of the wrestling match some of the students huddled around Madison and Taylor as they both retold stories of their odd experiences on their trek. \"A horrible skeleton, with hideous black holes for eyes,\" told Taylor for the seventh time. With rheumy eyes she looked wistfully into the distance as if she were retelling an old war tale. \"You should have seen this woman,\" Madison gushed, her eyes huge and her hands and face animated as she retold her story; \"some weird forest woman. I bet she is like one of those feral kids and she's been living out in the wilderness for years. She couldn't really speak, only groan.\" After many retellings, the description of the unkempt woman who had waylaid Madison's group on their trek had now morphed into some snarling, rabid Bigfoot. \"And now she has our scent!\" Keeley squealed incredulously, looking around as her hysteria rippled into the audience. The kids had told Ms. Mentira of the skeleton they'd come across, and the weird woman in the rock trail, but Mentira had waved both stories away as things insignificant, saying that were behind them now and would not trouble them again, however a few creases on her forehead betrayed her otherwise serene appearance. Pretty porcelain Cadence approached Ms. Mentira as well, and tugged on her sleeve like how a child would. \"Ms. Mentira, I thought you would return with Jocelyn. Where has she gone? What about Bailey, and Garrett?\" Some of the other kids were listening in too, some realising for the first time that the other kids were still missing. Ms. Mentira sighed and her harsh features softened a little. \"I am sorry Cadence, I couldn't find them. I am not sure where they have gone, I left a message for them at the last campsite to tell them where we are. Otherwise I have called the local police station and the school. I fear we may have to abandon our hiking trip if they do not turn up tomorrow, and send a search party for them.\" The whole class had gone quiet. Some of the classmates were shocked, they suspected Bailey and Garrett were stoned in the woods somewhere and would eventually turn up when they were hungry. Now they were officially missing, with Jocelyn as well. A swelling murmur spread throughout the camp like an incoming wave and soon excited, crazy rumours were forming like sea-foam, some linking the appearance of the strange woman on the rock trail to the missing kids. Ms. Mentira tried best to comfort the class and assure them that all would be well, but the way her voice was trembling did not fill them with confidence. Brody sat on the rough edge of a fallen tree trunk that lined the outside of the camp. He stubbed out a cigarette and took a swig of cheap bottled beer that Wesley had snuck with him on the hike. He listened to the gossip around the missing students and was intrigued for awhile, but like most things with Brody, the excitement was transient and disappeared into the night air just like dissipating smoke from the fire. He soon fell back into his usual state of boredom. He was afflicted by a particularly severe case of that stultifying ennui that most teenagers experience every so often, though for Brody it was a chronic case. He hadn't quite figured out exactly how to cork that little hole in his chest that kept leaking all his motivation and vigour, leaving behind an apathetic hollow. He was sure he would figure it out soon, but in the meantime was happy enough to continue distracting himself with booze, cigarettes and weed. \"If you want anymore man, just shout me!\" Wesley clamped a hand on his shoulder as he sauntered past. Wesley was everyone's friend, and was liked by all, but no one could really say exactly who his best friend was. He had a very cute, boyish face and a sleazy little grin-and-wink combination that was endearing yet incredible. He moseyed through camp, slapping backs, nudging shoulders and throwing his head back in laughter. He was in the midst of a very animated story when he accidentally elbowed a passing Nizhoni Fleetfloot, to the guffaws of some classmates. \"Nizhoni, sorry, I…I didn't see you,\" he stammered, for once caught off-guard and uncool. \"Ha, it's fine, it doesn't hurt,\" she smiled, rubbing her left breast where he'd struck her. \"Nizhoni, I never got to hear the end of that story about your tribe and Mayflower way,\" Wesley paused, \"maybe I can catch up with you later, and you can finish it?\" and then came his oily little grin. They had both arrived at Moon Hill when Nizhoni was only half way through the story of Mapiya and Powwaw, and so she never had a chance to finish it, in all the excitement of reaching camp. \"That…is not a story to be told just before you go to sleep,\" Nizhoni gave another cheery smile and made to move away, \"I'll tell you another time.\" And then she was gone back to her tent. Wesley watched her go, and checked her sexy ass-swing as she went. Blake went storming by, shoving past Wesley and shattering his trance. \"He was so fucking scared, he almost went white!\" came Tristan's mocking voice, followed by the braying of Cole and Xavier. Tristan was retelling the story about how scared Blake had seemed when they found the skeleton during their hike, much to the amusement of the other alpha boys. Blake's nostrils were flaring and his strode to the end of camp (but never out of the reach of firelight), silently raging. \"Cut it out Tristan,\" Brooke sighed as she watched through grim, bored eyes. If he heard her, Tristan showed no acknowledgement as he continued sniggering. Natsuki and Hitsumi sat nearby on the grass, enjoying their dryness and the warmth of the fire as they greedily ate some burgers. Natsuki would occasionally snatch little glances at Wesley, who seemed to be visiting everyone in camp apart from her. \"Congratulations!\" came Caridad's squeaky voice as she plopped herself down beside Natsuki. \"You made it here first, that must've been some good hiking!\" Caridad had doused herself in sweet, fruity perfume. Apparently during her hike along the swamp trail, Juan had stood on a rotten log, went through it and plunged into the stinking mire but not before grabbing Caridad and toppling her over too. Juan had bathed in the clean waters of Racoon River for an hour but couldn't get the swamp stench out of his nostrils. Natsuki peeped over at him; he was drinking some beer and smoking with Brody behind a log at the back of camp, trying to hide their sinning from Ms Mentira. Behind them Natsuki saw someone moving through the trees, shaded grey by the pale moon light. It appeared to be Catalina, and then a while later, Leonardo followed her. A short walk into the forest and the darkness was black as pitch, the laughter and shouting from the camp faded into a background hum, and the air was thick with the scent of pine. Leonardo followed Catalina carefully, though he crunched grass and snapped twigs underfoot so he was sure she heard him coming. In camp she had given Leonardo a fixed stare that definitely meant something but he wasn't sure exactly what. Then she marched into the forest and like an automaton he rose and followed her. It was difficult to navigate his way through the dark forest where the trees were narrow and black and there was no obvious trail, but a few steps further he heard a muffled sobbing. He came across Catalina by a mean, skinny tree which stuck up from the ground like a black needle. She had her face pressed against it, glassy tears rolling down her beautiful, harsh face. She looked at Leonardo but said nothing, and began to dry her eyes. Leonardo didn't know what to say, he had never seen the usually hard Catalina like this before. He wanted to run over and squeeze Catalina tight, and hold her close to him. He knew from his father's stories that Catalina had some domestic problems with her inebriate father. He realised that this was probably the first time in awhile that she had felt safe, relaxed, out here in the wilderness away from her home. Leonardo took small steps closer, careful as if trying not to frighten her off with any sudden movements. He came body to body with Catalina, who was breathing hard. His mouth was dry and he kept thinking of all the things he should say. He wanted to tell her he would keep her safe and that all her problems were over now. But how could he tell a lie like that? He knew his words were worthless right now. They stayed like that, for awhile, eyes locked, neither one ready to leave. Catalina moved first, and tilted her face slowly upwards until her lips, wet with tears, met his. Leonardo kissed her gently at first, and then with a deep breath pulled her in tight to his body, crushing their faces together, embracing hungrily. As suddenly as their kiss began, it came to an end. Catalina stepped back, cradling Leonardo's face in her hands like a prize. The moonlight caught in her eyes; gleaming like hidden treasures, newly discovered at the bottom of the world. Inhambane The motel room was plain; a bed, a toilet, an old TV. The peeling wall paper was bleached by years of sunlight. The toilet was cracked and dirty, and didn't function the best; it had finally rebelled after years of swallowing everyone's waste and would occasionally regurgitate its contents onto the tiled floor when flushed too forcefully. Verity leaned out the first story window, staring at the big fat moon. The air had cooled now, and was still, her puffs of smoke drifted lazily into the night. She wondered what it was about this place that made her feel so unsettled. Was it the look of the town? A backwater redneck enclave miles from anywhere else. There were shops with faded signposts and letters above them, half rotted away. The place felt outdated, like it was built up in the fifties and then just forgotten about. Except a few people were left behind…The local people looked strange, their clothes were old and faded and far from fashionable. They cast her strange, wary glances. Unsmiling, lined old faces with flat eyes. The fact that there was no mobile phone signal was like a validation of her isolation. She realised why she felt so unsettled…it was because she felt like she was unwanted, a trespasser in a strange land. These insular people had a little community here and she had landed in the middle of it. She would be glad to get this assignment over and done with…Talk with the locals, research some old newspapers (she had noticed a somewhat neglected library on the outskirts of town when she had come through) and maybe get some quotes off the local police or firemen… Verity was tired. She stubbed her cigarette into the near-empty can of coke on the window sill, and heard a satisfying little fizzle as it went out. She shut the window, undressed and collapsed into bed. Why was driving so exhausting when all you do is sit? She ruminated again about how shit this job was, how lonely she felt in this weird town and how she wanted to be back in the city. If she hadn't have been fired, maybe right now she'd be networking at one of those cheesy cocktail parties she so often used to frequent. As she fell asleep, the clinking of glasses against the backdrop of pointless chatter echoed in her ears and on into her restless dreams. Moon Hill Riley Swann put a finger to her tongue and scraped along it. It was rough like sandpaper. She groaned and slowly opened one sticky eye. She was so dry. She transitioned slowly from sleep back into the real world, gradually becoming aware of all the sounds around her; soft snoring from Regan in the sleeping bag next to her, the crackling of a dying fire outside her tent and the creaking of boughs tossed by the gentle morning wind. And she became more aware of the hot sting in her throat, and her mouth dry like bones and tasting just as unpleasant. Water! She felt around hectically in the dark, searching for a bottle, a flask, a can, anything with fluid, but all in vain. She gave Regan a little shake; \"Regan,\" she whispered, \"Regan, do you have any water.\" Regan groaned inaudibly then with one somnolent arm, flung a bottle at Riley, smacking her in the face. But Riley didn't mind! Water, yes! She unscrewed it frantically and put her thirsty, cracked lips to the bottle, however only a drop or two flowed forth. Riley was so disappointed she felt so could cry, but she thought it wiser to conserve her tears. She was so comfortable in her little sleeping bag cocoon, and spent a long time deliberating whether she would be better comfortable and dry, or thirst-quenched and cold. In the end, her thirst won out and so with great determination she wriggled free of her bedding, unzipped the tent and stepped outside. She had left a bottle of water near her walking boots beside the tent; she snatched it up and immediately began taking long, hard draughts. It was the sweetest thing she had ever tasted. Water… Then something on the other side of camp caught her eye; a tall, sinewy figure, hulking and silhouetted against the white of the moon, with thin wiry wisps of hair coming from an otherwise bald head. She tried to see his face but it was so dark, dark, drinking in the black around it and she couldn't make out any detail. \"Hello…? Who's that?\" And as soon as she heard her own tremulous voice, she was hit by a pang of terror that almost brought her to her knees, her throat was suddenly dry again, and she felt all the water she drank was going to come out into her pants. That isn't a person An instinct told her it wasn't a person; it was a creature, a monster , skulking through the camp at night. Is this the thing that happened to Jocelyn, Bailey and Garrett? The figure was still and unmoving, almost like an otherworldly statue. And for a second Riley felt like her tired eyes may have been playing tricks on her. And then its head snapped around, and Riley saw beady, watery-grey dots in an otherwise black face. Those are his eyes... And he sees me. A guttural shriek came tearing up from her belly like vomit, foul and burning as it came. All reasonable functioning shut down, electricity ceased to flow through her higher circuits, logic and rationale collapsed as Riley was taken over by a primitive and autonomic control remembered only by blood and bone. She shrieked and shook, her heart boomed and blood frothed and surged in her ears so all she could hear was buzzing. She couldn't move or think and felt only an animal, wild fear. And the creature shot across camp, a black bullet, with a speed it should not know. A long, slender outstretched limb came slashing down like a sword and Riley's head exploded like a peach hit by a hammer, spraying brain, gore and eyes all over her tent wall with a wet slap. Her dying shriek had been like an alert siren over Moon Hill and within seconds the whole camp descended into rampant chaos...[Chapter 9] Chapter Nine: Massacre on Moon Hill II Her heart was deceitful. She took all of Leonardo's complements with quiet sighs and soft, effacing smiles. Her face now was stony and from it he could elicit little of what she was thinking, the dim light in the tent did not help either. But her heart was different, it was the secret to another language, simple and primitive and semi-concealed in the vagueness of her words and trickster smiles. With one hand gently holding her breast, a finger grazed the wall of her chest where he could feel her heartbeat tapping out a secret code. When complemented her smile was shallow and shifting, but her heart would beat faster and with more force. When he held her tight she barely reciprocated and lay limp like a doll, but the slow steady rhythm in her chest revealed her security. Betrayed by her heart beat, Leonardo had found a way to interpret the language Catalina had tried to forget and destroy; the language of her blood and body. After their kiss in the forest and Catalina's emotional outburst, she had quickly returned to her usual stoic self, however she did agree when Leonardo suggested they sleep next to each other in his tent (he had to ask Juan to share with Caridad, Juan eagerly agreed – much to Caridad's chagrin). They had spoken quietly for awhile (or rather, Leo had done a lot of questioning with minimal response) but eventually, wrapped together, they fell into a deep sleep – one brought on by a day of hiking and a few beers. Leo strayed into sleep and slowly lost awareness of all the surrounding camp noises (fire crackling, sniggering from some of the campers still awake). He wasn't sure how long he had been out for when a high pitched scream jolted him into an upright position, for a second he felt Catalina's heart rate quicken as he pulled his hand away. There was silence for a few seconds as Leonardo made to unzip the tent and as he did so he heard a violent splash-like noise from across camp. Suddenly the camp came to life, tents starting shuddering, shaking off early morning dew with mouths zipping open and confused and frightening campers scrabbling around to find out what was happening. It was difficult to see; the moon's light was shrouded by a cloudy sky and the central fire was burning low. However Leo realised something was horribly amiss when more screaming came from across camp and people started to race by him, wide eyed and yelling incomprehensibly, some looked at him but in their agitation it was like they didn't even recognise him. Leo took a few tremulous steps towards the fire. He couldn't quite see what was happening but there was a strange shape framed by the dying licks of flame, black and humanoid, casting a hideous shadow over the camp. Wide eyed and shaking Leo came close to the fire, he could feel its warmth but it brought no comfort, it could not dry the oily sweat from his face or calm the tremor in his limbs. He took another step and felt a soft, squishing sensation. He looked down at the gloopy puddle he had just stood in and with horror, recognised it as belonging to Cadence. She lay on her back a good few feet away, shuddering a little. Her face was terrifying and filled Leo with dread. She seemed zombied, undead. Even in the weak moonlight she had managed to take on a colour beyond white. Her cheeks and lips and the contours of her face had all been sapped of any hue or tint, and what remained was only that of snow and ash. She was wearing only a bra and pyjama bottoms and the rest of her skin was also as white as bone. Her chest shook violently, moving out and in and up and down so unnaturally, like she had forgotten how to breathe. From her waxen lips came the most agonising and pitiful cries, but no sense could be made of them. He looked down from her twisted ghost face, past her white chest to a gaping hole in her abdomen. Her innards were not inside her. They were strewn across the grass of the camp, glistening wet in the firelight and leaking dark blood in voracious gushes. Her intestines were twisted and entangled in an elaborate and macabre tapestry all around her, punctured and leaking shitty fluid and bleeding freely. The air around her stank. She let out one last shriek, an awful ululation that perforated through the chaos of the camp; the music of terror. Then the spasms of her chest came to a sudden stop and she was still. Leo removed his foot from whatever viscera he had been standing in, leaned forward and projected a hot stream of vomit onto the floor. His hearing and vision began to blur, his bare feet numbed to the scratch of grass beneath them, and he no longer felt the sweat run down his arms. His fellow students shouldered past him, fleeing the camp in one massive hysterical clamour. Like a fire alarm had just gone off in a high security mental hospital, they all raced by, hollering and screeching, some tripping over others and some outright pushing others over. Some were half dressed and unkempt, others had managed to grab their bags or water bottles or shoes or whatever they could before they ran. Some were weeping manically, some yelled about a monster, others had eyes like they had just lined MDMA (and running like they had) and a few called out frenzied, half understandable directions or commands. \"Leo, move!\" Ms. Mentira grabbed him by the arm and spun him around. \"We have to move.\" She was dressed in pyjamas and her hair was wild. She screamed at him to move but there was still a level of control in her voice, some strength; she had not completely given in to fear. She held him firmly and gave him a steady look. His hearing and vision began to clear, his feeling returned. He nodded his head and the fear he had taken from the sight of Cadence's vicious end was replaced momentarily by the strength he could see and hear in Mentira's eyes and voice. Catalina! He left Ms. Mentira behind and raced back to the tent where Catalina stood shoving her feet into soggy hiking boots and simultaneously pulling a coat on. \"It's cold in the forest,\" she said emphatically. She's right Half the kids were running semi naked into the forest but it was the middle of the night and though he could far from feel it right then, he knew the sylvan air would be bitter. He grabbed his coat and boots and flung his bag around his naked shoulder and then took Catalina by the elbow. \"We have to move,\" he yelled, echoing Mentira, hoping to emulate her strength. They ran in the opposite direction from which the majority of other students had dashed. As they did so Leo cast a quick askance glance at Juan's tent. He was relieved to see the tent opened and empty. Hopefully Juan and Caridad made a good run for it. They charged on ahead though the trail was not clear and overlain by thick, drooping boughs. Catalina stumbled a little on a long, black branch lying on the path. Leo kicked it out of the way and immediately realised it was not a branch. It was soft and meaty, and heavier than he expected. That was someone's arm... \"We have to move.\" They kept running, occasionally tripping up, occasionally falling over but always back on their feet and running. All around them was darkness and occasional slivers of silver light. Their exaggerated breathing came fast and noisy and sounded like thunder. Leo had never felt his heart beating like this before, so forceful and violent like it could tear clear from his chest. They slowed when they ran into a copse so dense that it was too difficult to go faster than a brisk walk. Eventually they stopped and crouched down. Leo took a bottle of water from his bag and handed it to Catalina. They both shared the drink. \"What do you think is happening?\" Catalina asked. Her voice was steady and did not tremble, but her heart beat so fiercely that Leo could feel her pulse in her fingertips, betraying her panic. \"I don't know,\" he admitted honestly, \"but Cadence was dead. Killed. Killed by someone, and I think others may be dead as well.\" \"A person? An animal?\" \"I heard someone shouting about...a monster.\" Leo breathed deeply. He knew he sounded ridiculous but he now fully believed in monsters. Only a monster could tear Cadence open and allow her to leave the world in pain and terror the way she did. Catalina stared at Leo, her eyes initially incredulous and then slowly returning to their usual impenetrability. \"So what do we do?\" Leo took another quick swig of his bottle and stood, pulling Catalina up with him. He had had a beer with Juan earlier, he had joked with Caridad, he had kissed Catalina lips, and he had held her tight and felt her heart beating into his hand. He had known terror. He had seen a death. He had to go; they had to get out of there. \"We have to move.\"[Chapter 10] Inhambane The streets were so quiet, empty; soulless. Verity wandered aimlessly, taking ginger steps so her boots did not click loudly on the cobbled road. There was something in the silent air that made her want to be silent as well, so she moved like a cat in the strange town that was even more whimsical and unfamiliar under the white-blue of the night sky. She could not describe the feeling she had in Inhambane, was it just over exaggeration of the usual vulnerability people feel in new places? Or was she feeling the first trickles of an insidious dread that had been welling up inside her ever since she landed in this otherworldly place. She continued her aimless promenade to the other side of the town, under the cover of moon and stars with no other light than the little orange glow from her cigarette she puffed on occasionally. She had suddenly awoken at around two that morning; shaking and shedding cold tears from a sorrowful dream she could no longer recall. Her sleeping pattern had been completely fucked up since she had left the city and lost her job, friends and life. Now she would often find herself lying awake at night, coiling her bed sheets around her in frustration, waiting for a sleep which played at evading her. Eventually she'd pass out but would subsequently doze off at inappropriate times during the day. In other instances (like that night) she would manage to sleep early enough, but then awake in the small hours, sweating and trembling from the hurt of a merciless nightmare. And that was how she developed her habit of night walking (and worsened her habit of stress smoking). She strode on wearily, the light of the moon at her back and giving her a good view of the road ahead. However as she turned a corner, she heard something in the distance... laughter? That was something she did not expect. Cautious but deliciously intrigued, Verity followed the sound to another street on her right and turning onto it she could see thin strands of light on the floor, emanating from a fat, crooked building in the centre of the street. This is the first house that has shown any signs of life in this whole town! She entertained the idea of turning around and resuming her walk to the edge of town, but she knew that her journalist's curiosity, which always trounced her other instincts, would bring her to the laughter and noise eventually anyway, and so she stubbed her cigarette out and walked to the fat, crooked building that shone with light and merriment. As she neared the building she slowed down and approached warily. She smelt strong alcohol and smoke, and heard muffled chit-chat and occasional guffawing. She looked at the sign over the entrance; 'Billy's Tavern ' . A bar? She did not expect to find a bar open this late in such a little town. Interested she tried to peep through the window as she slowly wandered by but the glass was frosted and all she could make out were a few blurred figures; black against an orange glow. She walked by and then stopped in an alleyway beside Billy's. Should I go for a drink..? A nice spirit would go down well right now; on the other hand I could be walking into some backwater hills-have-eyes fest which probably wouldn't go down so well. Verity toyed with the idea of drinking for a few minutes, and then decided she would go for a drink! She had only seen around three or four figures in the bar, and they were chatting and laughing cheerily enough. Also, drunken locals would probably give good information about what happened in Mayflower Way in the late eighties, and the sooner she could write the story, the sooner she could get out of Inhambane and leave all the eerie, lonesome streets behind. Her decision was strengthened by the plump canister of double action pepper spray in her coat pocket (after she published the article that saw her ran out of the city, she had become accustomed to taking it with her). She stood in front of Billy's entrance, took a deep breath (it was always scary walking into local bars, let alone a local bar at half two in the morning in a dustbowl town that America had forgotten) and pushed open the wooden door. Rusty hinges cried as she entered and that was the only sound she heard as all conversation ceased, all drinking stopped and all eyes were on her. Verity swallowed. There were four men, including the bartender. Three sat at the bar, two close together and the third a few stools apart, however all four of them seemed to have been involved in conversation. A portly, ruddy faced man with gold bands on his fingers nodded at Verity, he had a bemused expression. Verity nodded back and made her way to the bar, and sat on a stool at the far left of the bar – as far as she could from the locals. The barman looked at the fat man before approaching Verity. \"What can I get you Miss?\" Amaretto and ice. \"You have whiskey?\" \"Sure thing, Tennessee whiskey?\" \"Sure, with ice please.\" The three men on her right resumed conversation though were now speaking a lot more hushed. After a few murmurings, the fat man let out a laugh that sounded like a clap followed by a wheeze. His face turned even redder; a rich tomato colour. The moustachioed barman set a tumbler in front of Verity, poured her a generous glug of whiskey and shovelled in a small glacier of ice, which began to steam gently. Hmm, at least they know how to drink here. She took a sip and delighted in the earthy whiskey burn. It was strange how one sip of alcohol immediately made her feel a lot more relaxed, but even so she kept her eyes on the melting ice in front of her, she wanted to listen and get better judgement of the bar and its patrons first before she spoke with them. She allowed herself a little glance around; this bar was ridiculous, like some kind of funhouse parody of a cowboy bar complete with stools dressed in hide, bison skulls and treble X liquor jugs. However she was struck by an oil painting on the wall by the door, of a young Native American woman tied to a post, naked from the waist up and losing blood from a manifold of vicious wounds, her face a mixture of pain and hatred. It was a disturbing painting and seemed out of place compared with the other garish adornments. A painting on the opposite side of the room was of the Minotaur from Greek mythology, stalking the halls of his labyrinth. What odd paintings... \"Hey there Miss,\" came a deep voice. Verity looked over to the fat man who was smiling at her. The other men were looking at her inquisitively. \"Hey there Mister\" \"Sorry to pry, but it's not often we get visitors to our little town, especially ones that can knock whiskey back the way you can.\" Verity looked down at her glass; she had unconsciously sunk nearly the whole drink during her musings. She smiled; \"it's a good drink,\" and nodded at the barman. The fat man let out another sonorous, wheezy laugh. \"Yes, yeah it is...So what brings you to these lonely old parts?\" \"My job. I'm...\" Verity fumbled a little, she was still embarrassed to admit her FREAK job, even to these bumpkins, \"...a writer. And I am especially interested in these lonely old parts.\" \"A writer eh?\" the fat man cooed with eyes wide; apparently interested or feigning interest well. \"Of sorts.\" Verity smiled, then saw a little opportunity to get some work done, \"actually, maybe if you guys aren't too busy you could help me out, I could ask you a few questions?\" \"Well, Miss, you are talking to the sheriff of this little town and these here are my colleagues, and we'd be much obliged to help you out in any way we can.\" \"I am owed no obligation, but thanks all the same!\" Verity spun her legs off the stool and strutted over to the sheriff and his crew, and took the vacant stool in the middle of them. As a former political journalist Verity knew how to fuck with the big boys, and these guys were no more than babes. Feeling a little more confident (though she was unsure whether this was due to the tumbler of whiskey she'd practically snorted, or because she had a better grasp of these guys), she pulled a small moleskin pad from her bag and a felt-tip pen. She licked her wet lips and glanced at the barman; \"another please.\" \"So what is it you're writing miss?\" asked one of the sheriff's men, the one with orange hair and a narrow face. \"I am writing about this town. About something that happened here, twenty-three years ago...\" she let her voice trail away, and looked for recognition in the eight eyes around her; they all glinted. The orange man looked at the sheriff and raised an eyebrow. They know something. \"..And what exactly would that be?\" the sheriff said spider-soft, leaning in close, close enough for Verity to smell his cigar stink half-concealed by a cheap musky cologne, close enough for Verity to smell his meat breath and the small pointed yellow teeth behind the unctuous smile spreading across his tomato face. \"An accident. An incident. If you were here then, you must remember, a bus load of tourists caught up in a storm, their bus blown over a cliff?\" Verity said, almost challengingly. She spoke with strength but the nervous feeling she had when she had entered the bar was coming back, and the mood was changing. Her question was like a strainer, leaking away all the laughter and high spirits and leaving behind a shifty and sour alcoholic air. The sheriff's mouth kept smiling, but his eyes stopped smiling. \"Well it sounds like you know the full story; there ain't nothing else to tell.\" \"If there ain't nothing, that means there is something.\" Now the sheriff stopped smiling altogether, his yellow teeth disappeared behind his fleshy lips; \"you think you're the first clever little city slicker to come in here and start asking us simple country folk about what happened around our town?\" He paused... \"Those people died near the town. I was here, I helped pull their broken, bloated bodies from the water, I saw their twisted faces and scattered limbs. I gave my story to the reporters then and all the ones that came after. But every so often another writer comes around, and kicks up a dust that's long since settled...\" He voiced his words with increasing harshness; a thin film of spittle was forming on his lips. \"...painful memories are like poison, venom that runs deep into the mind. The only antidote is time, time that allows you to live with your poison. Just when you feel you're able to live with it, another fucking snake comes along and bites you again.\" He spat the last words and his face, at first plump and friendly was now a terrible portrait of unhidden rancour, painted in scarlets and crimsons. He kept his face close to Verity's, and she could feel all the eyes of the men, all eight eyes, glinting around her like she was in a spider's web. A snake in a spider's web... She felt her hand unconsciously grasp the pepper spray in her coat pocket, her knuckles white. The sheriff kept a steely gaze on Verity; she returned it with as much vehemence as she could muster but inside she was feeling panicky. The room was so quiet, though she thought she could almost hear the wet, sinewy sounds of a smirk forming on the orange-haired man's face who sat next to her. She wasn't sure what to say, but she definitely couldn't press on with these questions, it was too dangerous. She had seemingly brought up a deeply painful topic...or these guys were drunker than she had thought and were looking to pick on someone. Don't let them know you are afraid... She opened her mouth to reply and then came the sounds of radio interference, whiney static and a ghostly cry. She closed her mouth and her eyes flicked to the transceiver neatly strapped to the sheriff's gold-buckled leather belt. His eyes, too, lost their ire and flicked to the transceiver. There was so much static that came through it was difficult to work out what was being said, but a man's voice (it sounded like a young man) was heard shouting. \"HELP!...Ple...a monst...Help!...Mayflower Way...Smentira's group of...\" And so much static that the rest of the words were muffled. The sheriff clicked a switch on the transceiver and cut the transmission but before he did so, Verity was sure she heard some screaming in the background. She suddenly felt as cold as the frozen ice in her whiskey. What the fuck? \"We have work to do, you'd best get on home now Miss,\" the sheriff said after a pause. His voice was gruff but had lost all of its menace; it was almost friendly, \"Now there may some mishappenings out there tonight. Where you staying? At the motel? I suggest you go back there.\" Verity sat up and threw a couple of dollars onto the bar. \"I'm sorry if I upset you gentlemen, I hope your work isn't too strenuous.\" And with that she turned and strode out of Billy's, closing the door tight behind her and sucking in the cool night air. She was sweating, and she hadn't realised until then but one of her hands was trembling and the other was still holding the pepper spray tightly. She released her grasp and took another few deep breaths. That was intense. She lit a cigarette. She started walking down the street, and welcomed its empty silence. She had underestimated those rednecks; they were a lot sharper than she'd thought they'd be. The sheriff had been deeply defensive when she had questioned him; he had reacted so strongly when she had asked them what had happened in Inhambane twenty-three years ago. That transmission... and now there was something strange happening in the surrounding forestland... And then she felt it again, that insurmountable urge, that unreachable itch, that journalists curiosity bubbling through her veins like magma threatening to erupt – and she knew what she was going to do. He had asked me where I was staying, \"the motel?\" That's where I'm staying but that is not where I'm going, no...I'm going to Mayflower Way, to find out exactly what these \"mishappenings\" are.

She wasn't your typical seventeen –year-old. While many of her classmates were out running the around town, she was either in her room writing with music blaring in the background, her nose stuck in a book or at the Archives in Alexandria, Virginia. She had friends but just a select few. One, Misty Ann, really wasn't just her best friend; she was more like her sister. It was two days before school was starting at T.C.Williams. Jade was where she normally was...at the Archives with Misty Ann. \"Why do you like it here so much?\" All the dust and the smell. Why?\" Misty asked, looking up at Athena from her stool. Who could explain Athena's love for old things, she couldn't quite understand it herself. \"I don't know, there's just something about the past that intrigues me and the smell, well, with you it's apple pie right? Well, that what it is like for me. Why do you like guys so much?\" she said making her way down the ladder with a file, but her foot missed a rung. The last thing she heard was Misty yelling her name.[Chapter 2] Disclaimer: I do not own the Titans fictional or otherwise. Nor do I own Alexandria. I do own the characters Athena and Misty, and whoever else you don't recognize, the teachers are based on my professors and some high school teachers.

My Note: Sorry the Prologue was short I'm working on getting chapter two done; I would gladly appreciate any comments especially on how to use html codes. Thank you, Angry Princess for your review, I'll try to keep this updated. Now On with the story. What Happened to Me? When Athena awoke noticed that she wasn't in the archives anymore but in the middle of a big field. Wiping her eyes, she called for Misty but there was no reply. Her first thought was that she had died. So to make sure, she pinched herself, \"Well, at least I'm not dead. So now where am I and how in the world did I get here.\" She said standing up, Looking around she noticed a house off in the distance with three people standing there. Looking around at her surroundings she noticed that this was not the Alexandria that she had come from. That's when she noticed a young girl walk off then turn and kick one of the older men in the back of the leg before running off toward her. Sheryl stopped short once she reached her tree, the one place where she could go to get away and think. Especially now that the board had taken away her daddy's job and gave it to some black man. But there underneath her tree stood a girl that she had never seen before, for what seemed like an eternity Athena and Sheryl stared at each other. Each wondering what to think of the other. Sheryl wondering why in the world this girl would have her hair cut short in the back but the front was almost to her chin and with tip of blue \"Who dyes their hair blue?\" She thought to herself. Not only that but this girl was wearing a white peasant blouse with a black belt and flared jeans. Athena on the other hand was wondering, well she knew that this kid was a girl because of the pig tails but she didn't seem to girlie to her. Sheryl in a way reminded Athena of her younger cousin, Camara. To break the silence Athena asked, \"So what is your name? I'm new around here and really have no clue where I am.\" Sheryl just looked at her like she was crazy then said, \"I'm Sheryl and you are in Alexandria, Virginia. Who are you and how do you not know where you are?\" \"I'm Athena Taylor. Well you see I was in the archives with my, Misty Ann, when I fell. When I woke up I was here. So this is Alexandria, what year is it?\" Athena asked rubbing her head. \"It's 1971 why don't you know what year it is?\" Sheryl asked looking at her all funny. \"1971, no it can't be, but if it is then that means, WOW when I left it was 2004. Well looks like I'm Dorothy.\" Athena said with a smile. After a few minutes the Coach joined them. Once again Athena retold her story to the Coach, and it was decided that she would stay as his \"niece\". \"Well, come on and let's get you some proper clothes and set you up a room.\" Coach Yoast said as they started to walk back up to the house. After they cleaned out the attic, because it wouldn't seem right if Sheryl and Athena shared a room, it was time to go into town and buy Athena some proper clothes. While they were buying some dresses Athena asked Coach, \"Coach why don't you stay and help out the team, if they are so important to you; you could help them with the change.\" She said going back to the dress rack. \"Well, I thank you for your input, Athena but I think it is time for me to go.\" Coach said letting her know that the subject was closed. After they bought several dresses and skirts for Athena to wear to school they went to Hal's where Coach would be giving his good bye speech. Which didn't go over to well, many of the boys threatened to sit the season out and the parents wanted to boycott the school. Off in the corner Athena sat with Sheryl thinking to herself, \"They never told us in school, that intergrading caused this much trouble.\" She couldn't help but notice that some of the guys where staring at her, nudging Sheryl on the arm she asked who the guy was with the brownish blonde hair was, turned out that he was Garry Brettier, the all American football player. She had heard about him and Julius Campbell, plus she had seen their pictures with the rest of the Titans pictures hanging up in the hallways. Sheryl was also naming off the rest of the guys on the team but Athena wasn't paying attention to those names, she was to busy staring back at Garry. Across the room after he had made his statement Garry whispered over to Alan, \"Who is that sitting with Sheryl, I've never seen her before.\" \"Think that is his niece or something like that.\" Alan said but couldn't say anymore because his father gave him one of those looks. As Athena was walking out the door behind Coach Yoast, she was stopped by Garry, holding out his hand she said,\" I'm Garry Brettier, you are Coach Yoast's niece right?\" Taking his hand Athena responded, \"Nice to meet you Garry, yes I'm his niece, and my name is Athena by the way.\" But before he had a chance to say anything to she walked off to catch up with Sheryl and Coach. Garry just stood there watching as she walked off, he was taken out of trance when an arm a came around his shoulder, \"Well, man it looks like that hippie belew you off, rude if you ask me.\"Ray said with hatred in his voice. \"She probably just had to hurry and get home. I'll you tomorrow Ray.\" Garry said as he walked off. Later that night while Athena was up in her room looking out the window she noticed a car drive up and a black man get out, right away she knew it was Coach Boone. She had heard Sheryl try to close the door in his face but the Coach stopped her. After a few minutes she saw them walk out to his office, so she went downstairs and told Sheryl that is she wanted to know what was going on to follow her. They both reached the door in time to heard Coach decline Coach Boone's offer to stay and work under him[Chapter 3] Disclaimer: I don't own anything to do with the Titains or the town of Alexandria, if anything looks new that you don't recongize from the movie then that means I made it up. New Friends and Faces It was Athena's second day in 1971, she wasn't really homesick because she was hardly at home anyways back in her time, but she did miss Misty. She and Sheryl had become quite close, almost like sisters. \"You know something; I wish I could meet Camara.\" Sheryl said through a mouth full of chocolate ice cream. \"Don't talk with your mouth full; I think you two would really get along.\" Athena said before taking another bite of her banana split. \"So tell me about the time she broke her foot.\" Sheryl asked again this time swallowing what she had in her mouth first. \"You already heard that one, but ok I'll tell you again.\" Athena said smiling before she re-told her story to Sheryl. After a few minutes Athena suggested that they leave, since she was feeling too comfortable with everyone staring at her. \"You'd think I would be used to it by now.\" She said out loud. \"Well, this is a different time, you know. I mean like people aren't used to short hair that's got blue in it. They are a bunch of rednecks anyways.\" Sheryl said as they walked down Main Street. Once they reached the corner where the school was they both noticed that the Coach and some of the guys were marching into the building. \"Come on let's go see what that is all about.\" Sheryl said as she started to run across the street. \"Let's not and say we did, we'll find out soon enough about what happened. Come on let's go to the park, so you can try to teach me how to throw a football the proper way.\" Athena said coming up behind her. \"Last one there is a rotten egg!\" Athena yelled over her shoulder as she started running towards the park. Gerry, Ray and Alan found them an hour later still at the park, with Sheryl still trying to teach Athena how to throw the right way. \"Hey Coach, what are doing?\" Gerry called over to Sheryl. \"Well, I'm trying to teach Athena how to throw a football but it ain't working to good.\" She called back. \"I tried telling her that about 30 minutes ago but it didn't work.\" Athena said as she jogged over to the guys. Ray looked her up and down with a sneer on his face, \"What kind of name is Athena anyway.\" He asked. Athena looked over at him with a glare on her face, \"I don't know what kind of name is Ray. But see unlike you, I don't ask questions like that because I have the common decentsy to keep my opinions to myself if they would probably end up hurting people's feelings.\" She told him a little loudly before taking the football and throwing it towards a tree. She did that to get rid of her frustration instead of hitting him in the face like she wanted to. But what surprised her was the fact that it was heading towards a guy but it was to late because it had hit him in the head. Leaving the others and an especially angry Ray she went over to the guy not noticing that he was black. \"I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to throw it that hard let alone hit you in the head.\" She said as she held out her hand in a greeting. \"The names, Athena.\" The guy was cut off guard, because there was white girl standing in front of him wanting to shake his hand. \"Well, at least you came over here to apologize which more than what others would do. The name is Rev.,\" He said as he took her hand. \"Well, it's nice to meet you Rev, so are you a football player, if you don't mind me asking.\" \"Yes, I'm going to play for T.C. Williams hopefully, if I can make it thru camp first.\" He said grinning. Across the way the others were looking on with mixed emotions, \"How can she stand there and talk to a 'coon?\" Ray said before turning around and walking off. Not once had any of the girls around here talked to him the way that she did and he wasn't about to let her get away with it. The other three on the other hand weren't sure what to think. Rev and Athena talked for a couple of more minutes before they were joined by two others, who names where Petey and Blue. \"Well, what have we here?\" Petey asked as he put his arm her shoulder. \"Well if I'm guessing right, I would say that I'm a girl and I'm standing here talking to Rev.\" Athena said with a smile. \"I'd say we have ourselves a soul sister.\" Blue said finally. After a few minutes the three invited her to come to Charles that night to meet some of the other guys. \"Alright I'll see what I can do.\" She told them before running back other to the others. That night she and Sheryl found out that they would be accompanying Coach to the football camp in Gettysburg. \"I know you really don't like football but maybe you could help out also like with the water and everything.\" Coach said looking across the table to Athena. \"Alright, I don't mind doing that.\" She said going back to her mashed potatoes. \"Umm, do you think I could go to over to Charles, I meet some of the football player today at he park and they asked to me to come.\" She asked hoping silently that she could. \"Do you know where Charles is?\" Coach asked. She knew all right because she would go there every Thursday night to watch her dad play pool, but this was 1971 so what could be so different about it now. \"Umm, not really.\" Athena said looking up from her potatoes. \"It's in the 'Burg, the black part of town.\" He said simply. \"Oh, so does that mean I can't go.\" Athena replied. \"I don't feel comfortable with you going there by yourself, but I'm not your dad so I really can't tell you what to do.\" He said. \"Well, as long as I'm under your roof I'll do what you say, but if you feel uncomfortable with me going by myself why not drive me there and pick me up.\" Athena said simply. After a few minutes Athena was walking into Charles but not without getting weird looks and some rude comments from the patrons. \"Hey, 'Thena girl what took you so long.\" Petey said coming up behind her not giving her time to answer since he dragged her over to meet some of the other guys on the team. Athena had never felt so in place anywhere in her whole life. All of the guys she had met at Charles made her feel welcome, it wasn't that Coach didn't but there was just something about Rev and the others that just clicked. \"Hey, 'Thena I challenge you to a game of pool.\" Blue said holding out a pool stick to her. \"Now Blue what makes you think that she knows how to play?\" Petey said with his arm around her shoulder. \"Well, Petey I guess there is only one way to find out now isn't there.\" Athena said taking that stick from blue and breaking the balls making three solids. \"Well it looks like I do know how to play.\" She said looking over at Petey with a grin. A few minutes later Athena had beat all the guys at least twice. \"Man girl where did you learn how to shoot?\" Blue asked sitting down across form Athena. \"Well, my dad taught me up until left.\" Athena said inwardly hoping that they would drop the subject, she hated talking about her parents to anyone; Misty didn't even know the whole story. \"What 'da mean left, where did he go?\" Petey said. \"Look, I don't want to talk about it alright so just drop it, ok.\" She said in a harsh voice. \"Ok, you didn't have to get all mean about it.\" Petey said with a hurt look on his face. Out of nowhere there came a voice behind her. \"What's a cracker doing here?\" Athena was in no mood to get in an argument so getting up she turned around to face the person that had said such a derogatory thing to a fellow human being. She didn't think that he would be so tall, not letting that stop her. She squared her shoulders and said, \"Well, we are fresh out of crackers but I really don't think you where talking about that kind now were you? I really don't see any crackers here anyways nor do I see coloreds, what I see is a group of teenagers sitting around a table talking; so would you like to join us? If not then you need to keep your closed minded opinions to yourself.\" She stated overly sweetly. \"I'm not talking about the kind of crackers you eat dumbo, I'm talking about you.\" He said pointing a finger in her chest. \"You know you are really showing how smart you are by saying something like that. You don't hear me calling you names now do you, why because I respect for my fellow man unlike you. Petey, Rev and Blue I'll see you guys around, it's suddenly it gottten a little too crowded in here for me to stay.\" She said with her face red from anger. As she walked she noticed that the other patrons where staring at her as she walked out stopping at the door she turned and said, \" The food was great and so was the service thank you for making feel welcome.\" And with that she walked out the door. She didn't see any of the guys for three days, it wasn't until the day of camp that she saw them, but she couldn't go over to say anything to them since there was already a big fuss about blacks and whites getting ready to go to camp together. Plus, some people on the school board still wanted Coach to be head Coach at T.C. Williams. She instead she kept Sheryl company until it was time to leave, but she noticed that Garry and Ray walked over to talk to Coach Boone, which in Athena's opinion wasn't a good idea and it turned out that she was right because Boone ended embarrassing both Garry and Ray. \"Well that is what they get if you ask me.\" She said aloud. \"They didn't deserve to be humiliated like that, stupid man.\" Sheryl said looking up at Athena. \"Looks like I need to stop thinking out loud.\" She added with a grin. It wasn't long before Coach Boone had every one off the bus and was pairing them off with another team member of a different race that would also be their roommate. \" This was a good idea. \"Athena thought to herself this time and not out loud. Pretty soon they were on their way to Gettysburg, Athena on the bus with Garry, Alan, Rev, Blue and the guy that had ticked her off at Charles three nights ago. She just stared out her window watching the scenery go by until she heard Blue start to sign. \"Baby there ain't no mountain high enough, ain't no valley low enough.\" But he couldn't continue because that guy had told him he didn't want to hear his voice again and the same went for Garry. \"He definitely needs an attitude adjustment.\" Athena thought to herself. The rest of the drive was boring; nobody talked or did anything except either look straight ahead or out their window. Pretty soon she was dosing off, twice she hit her head on the window, which caused Blue to laugh. Turning around Athena mimicked Julius's voice, \"Blue, I thought I told you I didn't want to hear your voice again.\" She said letting out a laugh. Julius wasn't too happy about her performance but just looked straight ahead acting as if it didn't bother him. She wasn't sure when she fell asleep but she woke up because Blue kept pestering her until she noticed that they had arrived. The first day had gone pretty well, except for the fight that broke out on the guys' floor. She and Sheryl both had heard the lecture from Coach Boone, she couldn't help but feel sorry for the guys cause that was how they grew up but still that wasn't cause for fighting especially over a picture. Practice was hell at least in Athena's opinion, it was hot and what Boone was doing she considered crazy, not letting the guys get water, come on. Her and Sheryl had spent a lot of time filling up the cups to have it all go to waste when Ray shoved Rev out of the way when it was clear that Rev was first. Sheryl was shouting them,\" Come on you guys, your acting like a bunch of jerks.\" \"More like retards who are babies if you ask me, no offense Rev.\" Athena added looking over at Rev. That day at lunch Louie ended up getting grief from Julius, \"Jezz, what is wrong with him all Louie wants to do is sit and eat. But I guess to Julius it doesn't matter.\" \"Well, maybe he hates change.\" Sheryl said popping another grape into her mouth. \"Well the times are a changing so he might as well get used to it.\" Athena said lookin back at Louie. About that time Coach Boone called Louie to the middle of the room and asked him a question about who he was rooming with, which didn't make Blue to happy. \"Remind to ask Blue about that later.\" Athena stated looking over at Sheryl. So it was decided after nobody else would go after Louie and that every guy would spend time with the others on the team and they would do three a days until every one had met each other. If not then it would go to four a day, silently Athena wanted to scream with joy, this was the exact type of thing she was hoping for maybe after this the guys would be closer to acting like a team.[Chapter 4] Author'snNote: I don't own the Titans are anything else in this storynexcept Athena and some other people you may not recognize. Have funnreading this. My Note: Sorry it tooknso long guys, I lost my notebook so I had to find and everything butnI finished all this today. ENJOY! Sarah Sunshine, Sunshine It didn't take long fornGerry to get his John Brown hind parts in gear and talk to Julius.nThere weren't any more three a days but there was a lot of tension.nFrom the sidelines Athena saw this along with Sheryl. \"You know, I reallyndon't think Ray likes the idea of playing ball with Boone, or anynof the other guys.\" Athena said under her breath as she watchednhim fail to block for Rev again. \"Nonreally were did you get that bright idea.\" Sheryl said lookingnup at Athena. Athena just grinned andnpatted Sheryl on the shoulder saying, \"Why I do declare that Ms.nSheryl is getting testy, what ever shall I do.\" With a southernnaccent and fanning herself in the face. Off in the distance Gerrynand the rest if the guys just grinned, it had taken them awhile tonget used to Athena's antintics but now they found them verynentertaining except for Ray, who said, \"Normal girls shouldn'tnact like that in public.\" Sheryl trying to hide angrin said,\" You are weird anyone ever tell you that.\" \"All the time love,nall the time.\" Athena just said with a chuckle. Aboutnthat time Athena turned around to see Gerry get in Ray's face andntell him to start blocking for Rev or else he'd give him anewnhaircut. For some reason Athena thought this funny was because shenknew Gerry was trying to think of something macho to say but itndidn't quite come out that way. After Ju knocked Pete away Gerrynwent over towards Julius and did something no one expected him to do.nAnd that was hit Julius saying left side, so Julius picking up thentheme said strong side. They did for a couple of more timesnsurprising everyone on the team, especially Athena and Sheryl. Athena just looked at thenguys saying, \"Well now I guess they are finally a team.\" \"Why I do believenyou are right, Athena dear.\" Sheryl said mimicking what Athenanhad done a few minutes ago. That next day at practicenwhile filling up cups of water with Sheryl, Athena noticed a red carnpull up with an army guy and some boy with long blonde hair get out. While the guys were onntheir way to get the cups she heard Gerry say, \"Hey, y'allnlook at that fruitcake.\" Athenancouldn't stand anyone calling someone a derogatory name no matternwhat it was so she looked at Gerry and said, \"Jeez, maybe he justnlike his hair long, and besides I think he looks kind of cute likenthat.\" \"Figures Hippie girlnwould go for some guy like that.\" Ray said walking by. \"Well in mynexperience with those of a male gender and I have found that hippiesntreat girls better than some redneck jocks, who think they own thenearth but are really just a waste of oxygen.\" Athena saidnlooking at Ray very sweet like. Thisncaused the guys around them to start laughing, Alan with tears inneyes looked at Ray and said, \"Buds, why do you even try to getn'Athena mad you know it's just not going to work cause she'llnbeat every time.\" Andnwith a huff Ray stomped off towards the locker room. \"Oh, justngo throw a temper tantrum like a three year old.\" Athena yellednafter him. \"'Athenanyou really should lay off Ray, he can't help it if he acts the waynthe way he does, and children are the reflection of their parents.\"nRev said looking at her. \"Yeah, I guess younare right but he just makes so easy sometimes, plus I can't staynhim.\" About that time Athena saw a football fly through the airnand hit Gerry in the back of the neck. Causing everyone around him toneither laugh or smile. Athena walked over andnplaced her arm around his shoulder, \"Well, Superman, I reallyndon't think that he is a fruitcake now is he? So maybe you need tonstop and think before you speak sometimes.\" That next day it turnednout that the new guy's name was Ronnie Bass and Pete had taken toncalling him, Sunshine. So being the curious person Athena was she wasndetermined to find out why and what exactly went on between Gerry andnSunshine in the locker room. \"Come on Rev tellnme, I want to know. Please.\" Athena asked with a pout while shenwas walking beside him towards the locker room. \"Sorryn'Athena, but what stays in the locker room stays there.\" Hensaid with a grin. \"Fine, keep yournsecrets, but I will find out one day, I will.\" She said in anwhisper. Before heading offntowards the dinning hall. So at lunch Athena sat with Alan and somenof the other guys on defense. \"You know, I really would like tonknow what went on between the two of you, since I am the manger andnall I have right.\" Athena said to no one in particular. \"LooknAthena, I heard that you wanted to know, but if you want to knownyou'll have to ask Sunshine.\" Gerry said taking another bitenof fruit. About that time Ray camenover and wanted to sit down but Gerry had told him that it was thendefensive table. When Ray had something about Athena sitting there. Athena looked up at himnfrom her plate and said, \"Well, since I'm not on the team justna manger then I can sit where ever I want to unlike some people.\"nWhen Ray just glared at her she just smiled and said, \"See younlater Dean.\" Causing Julius to chuckle. Tonadd to the humor she added, \"Jerry, how do you feel about losingnyour partner or have you gained another, because our viewers and yournfans would love to know.\" She said holding her spoon like anmicrophone over to Gerry. Gerrynjust gave her a funny look before saying, \"I gained a brother, BignJu Campbell.\" \"And how do you feelnabout this Big Ju?\" she added holding her spoon over towardsnJulius. \"I say, let's trynand see anyone try to break up Big Ju and Superman.\" Julius saidnwith a grin. \"Thanknyou gentle man and now back to you, Bob.\" Athena said to annimaginary camera. \"Ok,n'Athena, what is wrong with your head.\" Julius said whilenknocking on her hers. \"Well,nyou see it's like this Ju, I figure that it's probably becausenI'm an only child and I pretty much had to keep myself entertainednor I'm just plain crazy.\" She said with a smile, and thennadded, \"What's wrong with your head Big Ju? Cause you seem tonhave gotten a little but of an ego.\" She said with a grin. From across the room shenheard Pete yell, \"Don't mess, with my mind.\" Athena smiled and lookednat the Gerry and the others, \"Looks like I'm going to find outnafter all, excuse me guys. I shall be back so don't miss me tonmuch.\" She said adding a wink at the end. Gerry watched her walknoff towards Pete but first she stopped by Blue, Rev, and Louie givingnthem each a hug and one of her smiles. His thoughts went out of hisnhead when he felt a hand hit him on his back. \"Hey, Supermannremember Emma.\" Julius told him. \"What I can look butnI just can't touch.\" Gerry said giving the guys a smile. \"And not touchingnwill be the hard the part.\" Alan said with a little laugh. Butnit wasn't too hard to see why most of the guys liked Athena,nbrotherly or in any other way. She was like a breath of fresh airncompared to the girls around Alexandria. Many were to afraid to saynwhat they were feeling or anything at all of what was on their mind,nbut Athena wasn't like that she'd tell you in a heart beat hownshe felt about you or something else and in the process make you feelnvery ignorant. It was hard to explain but there was just somethingnabout how she acted that made you think of an innocent angel but thennyou could see every so often her horns. Whennshe got over to Sunshine and Pete, Athena with a little smile on hernface barked, \"Jones, how many feet in mile. How many feet in milenson?\" She said smacking him on the head. Petenjumped up and said, \"5,280 feet Coach.\" Whennhe turned around he looked like that he was either pissed or amused.n\"Why do you get pleasure out of scaring me, 'Athena?\" \"Well,nbecause Pete dear you make it so easy for me.\" Athena saidngiving him a hug and taking a set next to Pete. \"Aww, Pete I'mnsorry, I promise I won't do it, you have my word.\" She saidnlooking over at Pete. \"You said that thenlast time, so don't think I'm going to fall for it again.\"nPete said giving her a smile. \"So,nI'm Athena Taylor, 'Athena to some, or loud mouth to others. Andnyou are Ronnie Bass or Sunshine though I haven't figured out thatnnickname yet.\" She said giving Ronnie a smile. \"Sunshine is fine.nYeah, Pete filled me in on you.\" He said smiling back at her. \"Well, it's allntrue depending on what he told you, but I'm from California asnwell, but we moved around a lot so you could say I'm from everynwhere.\" Athena just kept on talking but Sunshine was to busyndaydreaming that he didn't even hear a word. From what Pete and somenof the other guys said he instantly liked her. They liked the samenmusic, books and food. She wasn't like some of the girls he hadnknown in California but there was something about her that seemedndifferent. It was probably the way her smile lit up a room when shenwalked into a room, or maybe it was how at any moment she could justnbash you with words and from what he had seen she did it a lot tonRay. From just begin at campnone day Sunshine could see that he wasn't the only one who possiblynhad a crush on Athena, from the looks of things he could tell thatnPete, Gerry and some of the others all liked her. So he was going tonhave some tough competition. \"Hey,nboyo are you still here because I've been talking for five minutesnand you are like in another world. So where are you from innCalifornia?\" Athena said sending a grape towards Sunshine'snhead. Sunshine gave a littlensmile before saying, \"Oh, right well my family just here fromnHuntington Beach, how about you?\" Athena started to saynSilicon Valley but she was sure that the guys would have no clue whatnthat was, so she thought of some other city and she lived in,n\"Fresno.\" \"That's cool, sondid you do much surfing?\" Sunshine asked. \"Nope not really,nI'm more of your bookworm type person, the nerd that's on hernbeach towel writing or reading. I used to play soccer and volleyballnbut not any more.\" She said with a smile. \"Yeah,n\"Athena girl here is our house nerd, so if you have a questionnabout anything just ask her and she'll deliver.\" Pete saidnplacing an arm around her shoulder. In which Athena removed quickly. \"I'd rather be annerd than an ignorant male who is interested in girls when he has angirlfriend, like some people at this table.\" Athena said to nonone in particular. \"Whatndo you mean by that \"Athena?\" Pete asked looking over atnher. \"Oh, you know what Inmean.\" She said with a grin. \"So, Sunshine. Tell me how didnyou get that name from Pete?\" She said changing the subject \"Well, you see.nAfter I got my haircut, I kept looking in the mirror and that'snwhen Pete started calling, \"Sunshine.\" Ronnie said with ansmile. \"Well, I see thatnsince you have blonde hair and from California, but why wont Gerryncame near you?\" Athena asked. Pete choked on his fruit at thatnstatement. \"Why do you want tonknow?\" Sunshine asked. \"Well, because youndid something to one of my friends and I want to know.\" Athenansaid staring back at him. \"If you really wantnto know, then you will meet me after practice tomorrow.\"nSunshine getting up for some more food. \"As God as mynwitness, I will find out why.\" Athena said holding her spoon outnin her fist. \"'Athenangirl, you are just weird.\" Pete said laughing. \"This I do knownPete.\" Athena said with a chuckle. At the Coaches table,nSheryl had just come back from spending a week with her mother, whonwould soon be moving up North with her new husband. \"Hey Coach.\"nSheryl said walking up to them. \"Hey, how was yournweek with your mother.\" Yoast asked. After that was out of thenway Sheryl turned to Coach Boone and said, \"Coach Boone, you didna good job up here and ran a tough camp from what I can see.\" \"Well, I'm glad Inhave the approval of a five year old.\" Boone said. \"I'm eight and anhalf thank you very much.\" Sheryl said. After a few minutesnAthena walked up and said, \" Hey, welcome back small fry. UnclenYoast, would you mind if I borrowed Sheryl for a minute?\" Shensaid very sweetly with mischief in her eyes. \"Sure, just don'tncause any trouble, you hear.\" Yoast said. \"Ohnwe won't Coach, yeah Dad we won't.\" Sheryl said, with ansmile. After they walked awaynSheryl asked, \"So what are we going to do?\" \"Well, you know hownRay rooms with Rev right?\" Athena said. \"Yeah, but we aren'tnsupposed to go in the guys rooms.\" Sheryl pointed out. \"I know that, whichnis why Blue and Pete are helping us.\" Athena said walking up thenstairs. Once they reached Rev'snroom. They saw Blue and Pete in the doorway with a bucket. \"Are we going to?\"nSheryl said. \"Yes.\" \"But won't he be.\" \"nYes, very.\" Athena said finishing Sheryl's sentences for hernwith a grin. After a few near missesnthe four of them finally got everything settled. \"Ok, now Sherylnremember act like there is something going on in his room, lay it onnthick, you know.\" Athena said getting excited. \"Yeah, I now what tondo, you told me like fifteen times already.\" Sheryl said walkingndown the hall. \" Now boys we wait.\"nAthena said gleefully rubbing her hands together, waiting in Pete'snroom that was across the hall. A few minutes later Raynand Sheryl rushed down the hall. \"Are you sure, younheard something?\" Ray looking down at Sheryl. \"Yes, I'm sure nowngo and get it.\" Sheryl said running down the hall. \"What the HELL!\"nRay said as the ice cold water hit him. Athena and the boys camenout laughing. \"There now maybe you will cool off.\" Athenansaid grinning. But all grins were wipednoff when they noticed that Ray was actually ticked off. \"Why you little.\"nRay said advancing on her. Athena's eyes got widenas she watched him get closer and closer to her. \"RAY! You lay a handnon her, and we will tear you limb from limb.\" Gerry said walkingnin front of him with Alan, Rev, Louie, Sunshine and Julius. \"Guess, you'llnhave to be faster, Ray.\" Athena said sweetly. Causing Ray to walk in anhuff that soaking wet. But her triumph was tornnin two when she heard another voice say, \" Athena Jade Taylor innyour room NOW.\" She turned to see Coach with Sheryl she said anquite good bye and thank you to her friends and followed Coach downnthe hall to another wing. That night Athena wasngetting a lecture from Coach; Sheryl had already received hers. \"Younrealize that the stunt you pulled could have started a fight.\"nHe said pacing the room. \"Yes sir, but it wasnin fun.\" Athena said looking up at him. \"Well, next timenthink before you act.\" Coach said stopping. \"Yes, sir I'll trynto remember that next time.\" Athena said looking down, feelingnlike she was three. \"Now, for yournpunishment. You will not sit with any of the boys at lunch tomorrow;nyou will sit by yourself and not talk or look at any of the others.nAnd if one of them speaks you will remain silent. Maybe this willnhelp to think before you open your mouth.\" Coach said beforenexiting her room. So that next day atnlunch, when Athena walked into the dinning room. She walked past thenguys, who kept asking her what was wrong and if she was feeling ok.nWhat hurt her was the fact that she had to ignore Sunshine, who hadnasked, \"So are we still going to meet after practice today?\"nAll she could do was stop and turn around then walked away. \"WellnI wonder what is the matter with her.\" Pete said looking afternAthena. \"Didn't you hear,noh wait you are probably deaf.\" Ray said coming up behind them. \"What is the matternwith Athena then, Mr. Know-it-all.\" Sunshine said with a glare. \"Your little hippiengirl got in trouble last night for that little stunt she pulled onnme. So fruitcake she has to sit by herself and not talk o anyone.\"nRay said with a cocky grin. Athenanwas having herself a very nice lunch, just looking out the windows.nUntil that to went out the window when she heard a voice say, \"nNot so tough are you now hippie girl. Can't talk now or anything.\"nRay said and just kept on going. But she just sat eatingnher food trying to show that it didn't bother her, even though itntook every ounce of her being to keep from turning around andnelbowing him in the crouch. She tried looking for Coach to see whatnshe should do but all she got was he's back and a sympathetic looknfrom Sheryl. So since she couldn't talk now, she got up form herntable and started to take her try to the wash line. But Ray being the jerk henwas stuck his foot out in front of her, making her trip and fall withnher face in her food. He leaned down and whispered in her ear, \"Now,nmaybe you will think twice before messing with me.\" This causednevery one of the guys to stop and look to see what would happen next. Athena just laid therenuntil she was helped up by Sunshine who got a quite, \"Thanknyou,\" from her. And that was enough tonmake her snap. Standing up she wiped the food off her, and clenchingnher fists she marched right to Rays face and said, \"What have Indone to you besides dump water on you.\" Athena said poking anfinger in his chest. \"Athena Jade, whatndid I tell you last night.\" Coach called out to her. She started to saynsomething but was stopped when Coach Boone said, \" It's notnher fault Coach, she has taking a lot from Ray and I'm actuallynsurprised she lasted this long, just because it's her. So Budds younwill be running extra laps after practice today to help keep yournmouth under control.\" Boone said in a stern voice. Afternpractice it was the same routine, the guys would turn in beforengetting their cups of water. Athena just smiled and waved as shenwatched Ray run by them. \"Hey, 'Athena, I think that Sunshinenlikes you.\" Sheryl said looking over at her. \"Naw, I think henjust wants to be friends, and what would you know, you are onlynnine.\" Athena said over to Sheryl. \"I notice a lot ofnthings, like the way Gerry, Pete, and Sunshine along with some othernguys on the team look at you.\" Sheryl said filling up more waterncups. Butnbefore Athena say anything she let out a little scream as Gerry andnJulius picked her up and started to run around with her like thenusually do. \"You guys out me down, you're sweaty and stinky,nso go take showers.\" She said laughing. After the guys got theirnshowers, Sunshine meet her at the steps of the library. \"So what did you donto Superman?\" Athena asked. \"Well, I kissednhim.\" He said simply. \"You kissed him.\"nShe said stopping. \"Why?\" She asked. \"Cause he called mena fruitcake.\" He said sitting down. \"So you thought thatnyou would play with his mind.\" Athena said with a smile. \"Yep, I did.\"nSunshine said with a grin. \"But don't tell Pete.\" He saidnwith a wink. \"Your secret is safenwith me.\" Athena said with a grin. Last few days of campnpassed by in the hurry. Pretty soon everyone was on the buses singingnor talking nothing like it was the first day camp. Once they arrivednback in Alexandria all the parents were looking at them like theynwere aliens. Once Athena got off the bus, she decided to make hernrounds and say good bye to the guys. So first she ran over tonLouie and jumped on his back, \"Hi ho Sliver and away! So, younare coming to Charlie's Thursday?\" She asked getting off hisnback. \"Oh,nopps sorry I'm Athena Taylor manger and niece of Coach Yoast.\"nShe said when she finally that his parents were standing there givingnher weird looks. \"Yeah,n'Athena I'll be there.\" Louie said giving her a smile. \"Well, it was nicento meet you Mr. and Mrs. Lastik. You better be there Louie.\"nAthena said making her way over the Rev and his family. \"Well, what ancolorful young lady.\" Mrs. Lastik said to her son. \"Yeah,n'Athena is colorful but she is cool.\" \"Hey Jerry, is itnstill alright if I come to services at your Church on Sunday?\"nShe asked walking up to him. \"Yes, it sure is andnthis is my family.\" Rev said pointing at his family. \"Nice to meet you,nsir and mamma.\" Athena said shaking their hands. \"Well, it was nicento meet you all and I shall see Rev on Sunday if not before.\"nAthena said with a smile after giving Rev a hug. \"Well, she wasnpolite.' His parents said. \"Yeah, Athena isndifferent but she is definitely I good person.\" Rev said as henwatched as Athena gave Julius a hug and Pete. She walked over to Bluenand his dad, \"Hey, Blue see you Thursday right?\" \"Younknow I wouldn't miss it 'Athena gal.\" Blue said giving her anhug before getting the car and leaving. \"HEY, Alan we stillnon for Mighty Mouse Saturday morning!\" She yelled after him asnhe was getting in his dad car. \"You bet, see younSaturday!\" Alan called back. \"Hey, Superman.\"nAthena said running and tackling Gerry from behind. \"Hey,n'Athena gal, we still on for Wednesday?\" Gerry asked givingnher a hug back. \"You bet, wouldn'tnmiss it for the world. Oh, is this your mom, it's nice to meet you,nGerry was talking about you all the time up at Camp, I'm AthenanTaylor Coach Yoast's niece from California.\" Athena saidnholding out her hand. \"Well, it's nicento meet you, Athena.\" Gerry's mom said taking her hand. Once Athena said good byento them Gerry's mom looked at him and said, \"I don't wantnyou seeing her anymore.\" \"Well, that leavesnone more person. \"Hey, Sunshine. We still on for Friday?\"nShe asked walking to where he was standing with his mom and dad. \"Yeah we still arenthat's if you think you can beat me.\" Sunshine said with angrin. \"Oh, I'll beat then I'll do it again for goodnmeasure.\" Athena answered with a smile. \"Umm, so Ronnie whonis your friend?\" He's mother asked. \"Oh, this is AthenanTaylor, Coach Yoast's niece. She is from California also. Athena,nthis is my Dad, Col. Bass and my mom.\" Ronnie said. \"Well, it's nicento meet you both.\" Athena said with a smile. \"It's nice to meetnyou also, but we better be heading home, I have a roast in the oven.nFeel free to stop by anytime, I'd love to talk about California.\"nRonnie's mom said. \"Thank you. I willndo that.\" Athena said before walking off to join Coach andnSheryl. Off in the distance Raynstood with his parents, \"So that's her the one that is givingnmy baby all the trouble.\" Mrs., Budds said babying her son. \"Figuresna coon lover like her would, like that hippie boy, looks like we arenjust going to have to show her that she isn't welcome here innAlexandria.\" His father said glaring at Athena as she said hi tonCoach Boone's family. \"Don't worry, DadnI'll take care of it.\" Ray said as they walked towards thencar.[Chapter 5] Disclaimer: I do not own the Titans or the characters, I do own Athena andnanother characters you may not recgonize.

It didn't take longnbefore the guys had met everyone on the team. The only problem wasnthat Julius and Gerry had some problems talking to each other. SincenAthena wasn't one for arguing she walked up to Gerry after practice,n\"Hey, Gerry why not just talk to him it can't be all that bad.\" \"Look, MissnKnow-it-all if it's so easy then why don't you talk to him.\"nGerry said a little agitated. \"Fine, I will.\"nAnd with that she turned on her heel and walked to were Rev and thenothers were. \"Man, Gerry I don'tnthink that girl is afraid of anything.\" Alan said waking upnbehind him. \"No I don't thinknshe is; she is definitely not like others girls that we know.\"nGerry said walking towards the locker room. Ray stood off in thendistance glaring after Athena, \"Yeah, well we will just seenabout that.\" He said before walking after Gerry and Alan. Alan turned around, \"Budsnwhy don't you just drop it, you are just mad because Athena didn'tnfall for your tough guy routine. Now why don't you just drop it andntry to get to know her again.\" Alan finished with a laugh whilengoing into the locker room. \"Yeah, well Alan Indon't think so,so just keep your nose out of my business.\" Raynsaid sending him a glare. As Athena walked over tonthe guys, she noticed Louie over there also. They hadn't noticed hernso to make her presence known she took off at a dead run and jumpednon Louie's back, \"Hi, Ho Sliver and away!\" She shoutednraising her arm up in the air. \"Jeez, 'Thena girl,ntalk about giving a brother a heart attack.\" Blue said afternjumping in the air making the other guys laugh. \"That's easy for younguys to say, 'Thena weighs a ton.\" Louie said letting out angroan. \"Yeah, well at leastnmy momma didn't make the Grand Canyon.\" Athena said getting offnhis back with a grin. \"So, how do you guysnlike practice so far?\" She asked with a chuckle. \"Now that's a stupidnquestion to ask 'Thena.\" Petey said dropping an arm over hernshoulders. \"Well, then I guessnI need a stupid person then don't I, Petey.\" She said grinningnup at him causing the guys to laugh but making Petey just a littlenupset. \"Aw, now Petey don't be angry I was just joking.\"nShe said adding a little pout at the end making him smile. \"Well, it's just anlittle crazy cause you know Julius and Gerry wont talk to eachnother.\" Rev stated a little softly but not to were Juliusncouldn't hear him. \"What's this aboutnme?\" Julius asked walking to the group with his little tough guynwalk. \"Well, we were justnsaying before we got interrupted that you and Gerry need to get yournJohn Brown hind parts in gear and talk so you guys will quit runningnthree a days.\" Athena said looking him right in the eyes. \"And you need to getnup out of my business.\" Julius said looking right back at her. Off in the distancenBoone, Doc, and Coach were watching scene going on between Athena andnthe boys. \"Your niece is a little spit fire isn't she?\" Docnasked as they watched as Athena poked Julius in the chest. \"Yes, she isndefinitely different than most girls.\" Coach replied as Juliusnpoked Athena right back but that didn't make her back down. \"She can't gonanywhere without stating what's on her mind or without trying to helpnpeople can she?\" Boone asked. \"I really don't knownthe last time I saw her she was a baby. Considering my sister moved anlot.\" Coach replied while watching Athena poking Julius in thenchest one last time and running off to tackle Sheryl to the groundnstarting a tickle war.[Chapter 6] FirstnDay of School Athenanhad a week before school started, which was fine with her since shenloved school. Not that she didn't have enough to do already, almostneveryday she was with the guys, either going to the movies, Charles,nBowling or hanging out at each others houses. Well,nGerry hardly ever came, which had Athena worried since that was onenher friends, \"Hopefully, I didn't do anything that would make himnangry with me. Or maybe it's mom.\" Athena said thinking out loudnas she walked down the hall towards the kitchen. \" Inwouldn't worry about Gerry's mom, she is just weird anyway, and Innever really understood her.' Sheryl said coming up behind her. \"Whatnare you doing up so early, on a Sunday, you usually don't get upntill around eleven.\" Athena said taking a bowl out of the cupboard. \"Well,nI see it like this you've gone to Rev's church once already, so Inasked Daddy if I could go with you this morning and he said it wasnalright with him, if it was alright with you; so is it?\" Sherylnsaid looking over at Athena. Flashback \"I'll be back around two.\" Athena said as she came downstairsnand into the kitchen. \"Holdnit were are you going?\" Coach asked before she could reach thendoor. Turningnaround Athena put on her smile and said, \" To church.\" \"Incan see this but where at and who with?\" Coach asked walking intonthe hallway. \"Well,nit's a church, and it's in town and I'm meeting some of thenguys.\" She said very softly. \"Ok,nthen let me rephrase that, what part of town, and which guys.\"nCoach asked crossing his arms around his chest. \"Well,\"nshe said shuffling her feet from side to side. \"It's outside thenburg, and Sunshine, Louie, Alan, Ju, Blue, Pete and Rev will benthere. So can I go now?\" She asked very fast. \" Thisnwouldn't happen to be Rev's church would it now?\" He asked. \"Yes,nit would but I don't see what the big deal is, I asked his parentsnand they said it was ok. They even offered me and the guys lunch atntheir house after church. Plus, I won't be by myself, I'll haventhe guys they will look out for me, so Please can I go, I'm alreadynrunning late.\" Athena asked in a pleading tone. \"Alright,nbut you call me when you get there and when you are heading home.\"nCoach said waving her out of the house. \"ThanksnCoach.\" Athena said running out of the house and making her way tonthe church. Shenhad the best day her life that Sunday; she had sat with the guys.nClapped sang and danced around with everyone else in the church. Itnwas so different from the Masses she had attended when she wasnyounger. Afterwards Mrs. Harris had made them all fried chicken,nmashed potatoes, corn, and collar greens. Athena had to say that Mrs.nHarris was the best cook in world, even better than her mother whonused to be a chief. Then she had the guys sat in the living roomnlistening to the Temptations, and some others that Athena's parentsnhad listened to . End Flashback \"Yeah,nI guess you can come along if you want, I know the guys would lovenit.\" Athena said as she sat down to eat her cereal. Innthirty minutes they were out the door and walking to the church wherenthey meet up with Alan and Sunshine halfway. \"Hey,nguys. I've brought a visitor with me today.\" Athena said walkingnup to them. That's when they stopped and saw Sheryl. \"Wellnhey shortie, how's the weather down there.\" Alan said smilingndown at Sheryl. \"Indon't know you tell me how is the weather up there, it looks likenit is to thin since you have no brain cells left.\" Sheryl said withna grin. \"Yep,nshe is definitely your cousin.\" Sunshine said with a grin. \"Heynshe learns from the best and you can't get any better than me,nunless you want me to turn into Coach Boone.\" Athena said with angrin. \"Oh,nplease no one Boone is enough, we can't have two.\" Alan said withnpanic in his voice. Theynwalked in silence together for a few minutes before they saw anfamiliar guy coming towards them with a group of people. It wasn'tnPete or any of the other guys because they weren't close enough tonbe near the church yet. Some thing inside Athena told her that shenneeded to get Sheryl out of here. Stoppingnshe looked down at Sheryl she said, \" Sheryl, do you know how tonget to the church from here?\" \"Yeah,nbut why?\" Sheryl asked looking at Athena. \"Justndon't ask questions, get there as fast as you can, and tell thenothers that we have ran into some trouble and need help, now go.\"nAthena said pushing Sheryl towards an alley. Shenwatched as Sheryl ran towards the end before looking at the guysnsaying, \" Do you guys know how to protect yourselves?\" \"Yeah,nbut what has that go to do with anything?\" Sunshine asked. \"Yeah,nwhy did you send Sheryl away?\" Alan asked. \"Don'tnyou two recognize who is coming down the road.\" Athena said movingnher head down the road. \"Itncan't be, he wouldn't come to this part of town, and there arentoo many blacks.\" Alan said. \"Butnhe would if he had his buddies with him.\" Athena pointed out. \"Well,nit looks like we are going to have some company then.\" Sunshinensaid taking his hands out of his pockets. \"No,nwhat we are going to do is keep walking like we didn't see them tonbegin with.\" Athena said as she started to walk again. AsnRay and his buddies were walking down the sidewalk, he turned to onenguy and said, \"You leave the girl to me. I don't care about thenothers.\" Asnthe two groups meet, Athena started to get her blood pumping, justnlike she would do before a match, since she used to take boxingnlessons everyday after school. \" Angirl can never know too many kinds of self defense.\" Was hernmother's reasoning behind it all. \"Sonwhat are the two Hippies and dumbo here doing in this part of town?\"nOne of Ray's friends asked. \"Indon't know, why don't you tell us why a group that hates AfricannAmerican people, are doing in this part of town, then we might tellnyou why we are here.\" Athena said crossing her arms over her chest. \"Wendon't have to justify what we do to the likes of you.\" Ray saidngetting in front of her face. \"ThennI guess we don't have to tell you, what we are doing here either,ncause you sure don't look like our Daddy or anyone else we have tonanswer to.\" Athena said glaring at him. Shenwould have said something else if Sunshine hadn't gotten in frontnof her, \"Look, we are just going to meet up with some friends sonway move out of our way cause we aren't here to pick a fight.\" \"Nonbut it looks like Bongo brain here and his goonies are.\" Athenansaid getting out from behind Sunshine. \"Wellnthen let's just see what Mrs. Thing has up her sleeves.\" Ray saidnpushing past Sunshine. \"Comenon then and try, I'll give you three tries after that, we will seenwho needs help.\" Athena said getting in Ray's face, \"That isnunless you are afraid to hit a girl, but then I don't think you arensince you want to prove to everyone how macho you are.\" Athenansaid glaring at Ray. \"Ok,nthen let's see then.\" Ray said trying to backhand her but he madenno contact since Athena moved out of the way with a duck. \"Looks,nlike Buds here has to lay off the crabs, cause it's slowing himndown, you have two more tries big boy.\" Athena said bring her headnback up only to move again when a fist tried to hit her. \"Ohndear me, he has one try left whatever will he do it, no one knows.\"nAthena said moving back in front of Ray. But she didn't see hisnfist coming toward her; nor did she hear Sunshine's or Alan'snwarning because they were to busy fighting his friends. When his fistnmade contact her head snapped backwards, bring her head back up shenrubbed her hand over her lip, to find blood on there. \"Well,nit looks like he could do it, but I have news for you now, you drewnblood, be prepared to get very injured.\" Athena said brining hernknee up to get Ray in his crouch, he started to crumple up shenbrought her knee back up to make contact with his face. \"Oh dear,ndid I do that, opps I'm sorry.\" Athena said with a smile. Itnwasn't until she felt a hand around her ankle did she feel herselfnfall. Pretty soon she was looking up at Ray, \"So what are you goingnto do now?\" He asked as he punched her in the face and chest. Athenanbrought all her weight up to get him off of her, when he feelnbackwards she kicked him in his side, \"I was wondering why I playednthree years of soccer, and now I know why.\" She said with a grinnstill kicking him in his side. Somethingnsnapped in her mind, maybe it was the fact that she liked to fight ornprotect herself, but she just kept on and on until all she could seenwas red. She didn't even feel herself take the sides of Ray'snshirt between her fists and press into his throat telling him throughnclinched teeth. \"This my friend is the Blood choke hold, my dadntaught it to me, see with in five seconds you will feel blood enternyour throat and then you will being to choke.\" Itnwasn't until she felt multiple hands on her that she finallynsnapped out of it, when she looked around she could see, Ju, Blue,nPete and the others around her. When she saw Ray crawl away from herntrying to breathe did it all finally kick in. \"Ohnmy god, what did I do?\" She asked softly. \"Wellnyou tried to kill him, Athena.\" Sunshine said. \"Yeahnwe tried to get you off of him but your grip was so strong that wencouldn't until the other guys came.\" Alan said. \"Indidn't mean to, I didn't know what I did, God, I didn't.\"nAthena said getting nervous, because now Ray could go to the policenand say that she tried to kill him. \"Wenknow that 'Athena we say what happened so it's ok.\" Sunshinensaid sitting down next to her. (Ok enough with the drama) Hernday finished out quite well considering what had happened early thatnmorning, but needless to say the whole town knew, and took Ray'snside. Who wouldn't he had been in the town longer and was one ofnthe All American football players. But unfortunately the Copsnbelieved Athena since Sunshine and Alan were there to tell them theirnside of the story and since Athena wasn't the one to hit first shenwas actually protecting herself. But to the community that didn'tnmatter one bit. So Athena spent the rest of her day in her room awaynfrom Sheryl, who now looked at her like she was some crazy person.nCoach had tried to talk to her but left after she gave him fivenminutes of silence. The rest of her week flew by with Alan, Gerry andnSunshine coming over to watch Mighty Mouse. \"SonI hear you gave Ray an ass whopping.\" Gerry said during ancommercial. \"Indon't' want to talk about it right now, Gerry so can we justnwatch the cartoon in peace.\" Athena said not looking at anyone butnthe screen. Thenthree of them just shrugged it off and went back to watching theirncartoon. Pretty soon, Athena was heading to her first day of school,nwhich wasn't so good since the bus was meeting with protestors andneverything. Andnpeople telling her that she didn't belong and that she needed to gonback where she came from, \"If only that were possible.\" Shenthought to herself. She saw Gerry with his girlfriend, \"HeynSuperman, how's life treating you?\" she asked walking up. Emmanjust gave her the once over while Gerry answered her, \"Oh, 'Athenangal this is Emma, Emma this is Athena.\" Gerry said introducing themnboth to each other. \"Inknow who she is, she is the girl that tried to kill Ray.\" Emma saidnwith disgust. \"Well,nPrincess you can believe what you will, but that's not whatnhappened I should know I was there, and let's see you weren't sonyou might to keep your opinion to yourself, or at least get yournfacts straight before you open your mouth.\" Athena said gettingndefensive. Justnto make matters more interesting, Julius decided to walk at thatntime, \"Hey Superman.\" He said walking up giving Gerry a hug. \"Heynthere Ms. Killer.\" Ju added with a grin. \"Heynyourself, hey have you meet Emma? No I guess you haven't. Big Ju,nthis is Emma, Gerry's girlfriend, Emma this is Julius, Gerry'snbrother and one of his friends. Why don't you say hello.\" Athenansaid with a grin as she watched Ju hold out his hand. ButnEmma just rolled her eyes at them and walked off, \"Oh just throw antantrum like two year old.\" Athena yelled after her. \"Athenanwasn't very nice.\" Gerry said looking down at her. \"Well,nshe deserved it, Julius was just trying to be nice and she blew himnoff like he was nothing. Plus, I think you could do better than somenpampered, stuck up ice princess that's afraid to look in front ofnher nose.\" Athena said to him. \" Well,nyou could have been nicer, yourself.\" Gerry said getting annoyednnow. \"Well,nI don't like her so what do you think of that Superman.\" Athenansaid walking off towards Louie and Blue. Afternshe found her locker, she meet with Pete, Sunshine, and Louie downnthe hall, since they all had Government together with Mr. Cate. \"Well,nwhere do we sit?\" Sunshine asked when the entered the class room. \"Louientake that sit right there, Sunshine that one and Pete that one.\"nAthena said pointing out the different seats to where she hadnSunshine in front of her, Louie beside her and Pete behind her. Whilenthe class was filling Athena could feel the stares of her classmates,nshe knew what they all thought about her, and they all believed whatnRay was telling everyone. Mr.nCate turned out to be a crusty old man, who instead of looking at angirl's face he would instead talk to your chest. \"Hey,n'Then gal what do you have next?\" Pete asked from behind her. \"Chemistrynwith Gabor.\" She whispered back. \"Well,nthen you'll be with Sunshine, Gerry, Me and Alan.\" Pete said. \"Oh,njoy the fun continues.\" She whispered back to him as she was copiednthe notes for the board. Shenthen had lunch with all the guys, fifth period was her Algebra IInclass, with Coach Parker, Ju, Blue, Pete, Alan and Gerry would be innthere to keep her company, she would definitely need it cause shenhated math. She then had her British Lit class, with Sunshine, Rev,nand Julius. The one class she knew she would love would be hernAdvanced Placement European History, with Coach Garland, Alan, Rev,nLouie, Sunshine would all be in there also she wouldn't be alonenwith the students who actually thought she tried to kill Ray. So hernfirst day was full of trips, pushes, stares and comments made to her.nBut like her Dad taught her, \"keep your head held high and yournshoulders square, and don't lose your temper.\"[Chapter 7] Disclaimer: I don't own any of the Remember Titans people or places, but I do characters that you haven't heard of. I don't any of the music that you might and etc. The names of place have come from places where I live. My note: This isn't all of it, but I figure I needed to something up so you guys wouldn't mutiny against me, lol. Sorry it took so long guys, I didn't mean for it to. I hope you enjoy this chapter, I'm trying something new with Athena for a little bit, but I probably wont keep her that way, with the help of a certain character, so far no one has guessed it. So keep thinking, and here's a hint think outside the box. I haven't started on the Chapter that is going to be put up on the other site yet, because I haven't to that part in the story yet. The Chapter with No Name After her last class, Athena meet the guys under the school's big oak tree before practice. \"Well, 'Athena, how do you like Alexandria so far?\" Alan asked walking up to them. \"Well, let's think shall we? I hate it here, and I wish I could go home. That way I'll never have to see these uneducated redneck hicks ever again.\" Athena said looking up at him from her spot on the ground. \"I was just joking, you didn't have to tell us everything.\" Alan said sitting down next to her giving her a hug. \"As long as you don't hate us, then everything is cool.\" Sunshine said with a smile. \"I couldn't hate you guys besides you guys are my family.\" Athena with a grin. \"My only family.\" She silently thought to herself. \"Well, maybe if she didn't try to kill people and act so different, she'd have more friends.\" Ray said walking up to them with his little walk he had. Athena thought it made look like he had a corncob stuck up his butt. \"Oh, my mother fricking lord, you know the truth. You are just pissed because a girl kicked your ass.\" Athena said getting up and in his face. \"Well, we will just see who beat who, soon enough.\" Ray said as he turned to walk towards the practice field. \"You know, you are nothing but a racist, egotistical hick! Who is a waste of God's green earth.\" Athena shouted after him. While Alan and Sunshine restrained her so she couldn't go after Ray a second time. About that time they were joined by Pete who had no clue what had just happened. So he ran up behind Athena to grab her, \"Hey girly. How are you?\" He asked as he put her down from spinning her around. \"Oh my God! Would you stop. Just leave me the hell alone.\" Athena said smacking him on the arm before storming off towards the bleachers. \"What is the matter with her?\" Pete asked looking around at everyone. \"Can tell you in one word buddy, Ray.\" Sunshine said picking up his stuff from ground. \"Well, still I don't think that I needed to be slapped.\" Pete said rubbing his arm. \"Well, think about it Pete the whole town thinks she tried to kill him, she has been stared at all day, pushed and tripped, the there is the fact Ray wont leave her alone and plus, she is totally new here.\" Alan said getting both his and Athena's things. \"I know but you'd think that she would take it out on someone else.\" Pete said looking at him. \"You would think, but that did not happen.\" Rev said after he had remained silent through the whole thing. \"Well, what's done is done, let's go to practice now.\" Sunshine said taking off towards the field with Alan. Just when she thought that the day couldn't get any worse, Athena soon found out that it could. When she went on the field, Sheryl moved away from her and every time she would give the guys water, Boone would glance her way. \" Well, it looks like everyone believed Ray.\" Athena thought herself. After a few minutes the principal accompanied by a policeman came out to talk to the coaches, which made Athena very uneasy since they would glance her way. After what seemed like an eternity, Athena got the worst news she ever got. It turned out that Ray's parents had taken out a restraining order against her, which meant that she had to stay a hundred yards away from Ray. So the principal had taken the liberty of changing her schedule and she was no longer aloud to attend after school practice. Coach Yoast had been the one to tell her the news, \"I'm sorry, 'Athena, but you can't be on the field anymore nor can you be the manger.\" He had told her placing an arm on her shoulder. Athena just stared at him, inside she wanted to scream and yell. Instead she just shoved his arm away before turning and walking off towards the school. Gerry and Sunshine just watched as Athena walked off the field. \"I wonder where she is going.\" Gerry asked, he had no idea what had taken place a few minutes earlier but knew what had happened between her and Ray. \"Not sure, but I hope no one ticks her off.\" Sunshine said as he watched Athena shove through a group of girls. \"You guys didn't hear did you, she's not allowed with in a hundred yards of me. \"Ray said coming up behind them with a grin on his face. While the three guys were arguing Coach Boone and Yoast were having their own discussion. \"You know she isn't going to take this very well, may take her awhile to get over it.\" Boone said watching her walk well storm away. \"I know, but what else should she expect, by the way she acted last Sunday. She could have gotten really hurt or worse Sheryl could have been hurt.\" Yoast said looking at him. \"At least she sent her away before she have gotten hurt. Imagine if Sheryl had stayed, what would she of seen.\" Boone told him. \"I know I just wish that Athena would at least talk about it, just so she can get it off her chest.\" Yoast said until he noticed the three guys. \"Well, come on Coach let's go break that up before we have full blown fight.\" He said walking off towards the fellas. Athena was walking back out of the school form picking up her new schedule, when she bumped into someone. \"Watch were you are going there, doll, you don't want to get hurt now do you?\" the guy's voice asked. Athena backed up ready to apologize until she had heard the word doll. So instead she took in the guy; he wore blue jeans, a white T-shirt with a black leather jacket with what looked like some black boots. \"Excuse me, bud, but do I look like I'm made out of plastic, I think not. So don't and I repeat don't ever call me doll again. Are we clear?\" Athena said crossing her arms across her chest. \"Whatever, doll.\" He said before he walked around her and out the door. \"Well, that bastard.\" Athena said to herself as she walked out of the school. She had missed the bus because she was going to stay at the school for the practice but that wasn't going to happen now, and she wasn't going to sit around for the Coach to get done. So she decided to walk instead but then she remembered she really had no clue where Yoast lived and Alexandria was really different now. She had walked about half a block when she heard a motorcycle come up behind her and stop. \"Hey doll, do you have any idea where you are going because you sure don't act like you do.\" The guy said as he got off. \"Maybe I just want to walk, is that a crime or do I need a permit to walk now also.\" Athena said turning around. \"No, but do you have a permit for that smart mouth of yours, cause it's getting really annoying, but if you want to walk around like a stranger be my guest nobody is stopping you.\" He said as he started to get back on the bike. \"Wait, ok I have no clue where I'm going. I just moved here, and I really have no fricking idea. And I really had a bad day, so I'm sorry for taking it out on you. I'm Athena by the way.\" She said holding out her hand. \"I know who you are, you are that girl that everyone is talking about, and how you almost killed Ray or something like that.\" He said leaning back without taking her hand. \"I did not try to kill him, but you can believe what you want, I don't' have to stand here and take it.\" Athena said as she started to turn to walk away. \"I didn't say I believed him, so you might want to wait before you turn your back on someone, Ray could never tell the truth to anyone even if it looked him in the face. I'm Duke.\" The guy said as he got up from his bike to take her hand. \"Well, looks like you finally have gotten some manners.\" She said looking at him. Well, at least his eyes are nice. She thought to herself, when she noticed that his were an icy blue. \"It looks like you could use some.\" Duke said with a smile. \"So do you want me to show you around Alexandria or what?\" he asked with a smile. \"Well, I guess you could its better than me wondering around right?\" She said with a smile. \"Right, so jump on the back and I'll take you on the grand tour of Alexandria.\" Duke said as he got on the bike. As she was walking up she caught the name plate and stopped dead in her tracks, \"Oh my god, you drive a Triumph TR6R Tiger 650, twin engine, four stroke chain trany. I bet she rides smooth, as butter doesn't she? Have you topped her out at 103 yet?\" Athena said with excitement in her voice. \" Man Eric would so kill to ride a classic bike like this.\" Athena thought to herself. \"So you know bikes do you? A Triumph fanatic I take it?\" Duke asked as he crossed his arms again. \"No, I'm a Harley fan but one of my friends back home loves Triumphs.\" Athena said as she got on the back of the bike. Athena had always loved to ride on motorcycles, but her grandmother had never allowed it. Athena could still remember that one-day when she come home on the back of Eric's Triumph. You would have that she had committed a murder by the way her grandmother went on and on. -Flashback- \"But Grandmother they are perfectly safe, honest. And Eric is a safe driver, so nothing will happen to me.\" Athena said as she followed her grandmother through the house pleading her case. \"No respectable young girl should be seen on one of those death traps. What would your mother say about that.\" Her grandmother said as she turned out. Athena thought for a moment before speaking, \"Well, I think she would say, 'How was the ride and ask if I had fun.\" She said squaring her shoulders ready to take whatever punishment her grandmother was ready to give. \"That may be but look where that has gotten you. No parents cause your Father, the dead beat, didn't want you so as soon as you got old enough he left. And your mother couldn't deal the pressures of taking care of you and paying bills so who knows where she is. And they pass you off to me, I can't even stand to look at you.\" She had said with venom in her voice. That night Athena had been locked in her room, with no food and for punishment she had to copy the whole book of Genesis, while she cried silent tears cause if her grandmother heard her in the punishment would be doubled. -End Flashback- Athena shivered as she pushed that memory out of her mind. \"You ok back there, not cold are you?\" Duke asked when he felt her shake. \"Nope, all is well back here.\" Athena replied as she tightened her hold on him as they entered a curve. Athena then noticed that they were coming up on the backside of the practice field. \"Umm, I need to stay a hundred feet away from Ray, cause of that restraining order and all.\" Athena yelled against the wind. \"That's cool, you'll be fine trust me, it's at least another hundred yards from the sidelines to the road, so you all good.\" Duke said turning his head slightly. Athena gave him a smile and let a laugh as she held her arms out like she was flying.[Chapter 8] Disclaimer : I do not own any of the Titans or anything else that is associated with the movie. I do own characters that I have made up, Athena, Duke, and the teachers. If you do not recognize it from the movies then more than likely I have made it up. My Note : Sorry it has taken me so long to update this thing a lot has happened with school and everything so I am playing catch up. Here is the second part of No Name, it's a different name but oh well, it's something. Hope you guys like it. When Doves Cry The guys were in a huddle when they heard the sound of a motorcycle. Gerry looked up in time to see Athena on the back of Duke's bike. \" Why would she be on that death trap let alone with him?\" Gerry thought to himself. \"Well, guys looks like we are going to be replaced in the friend department pretty soon.\" He said giving his attention back to the huddle. \"Wait, what do you mean by that Gerry?\" Sunshine asked cutting Gerry off before he could call out the play. \"I mean that Athena will be with Duke Bennett before the weeks out, I'll wager. Now let's get back to practice.\" Gerry said hearing Coach Boone's whistle for the third time. \"Wait, what is so wrong with this Duke character?\" Sunshine asked very confused. \"I'll explain it to you later Sunshine, ok?\" Alan said looking over at him. \"I hope you know what you are doing, Athena. Duke is nothing but trouble and you have gotten right in to the fire.\" He thought to himself. From the looks of some of the guys, you could tell that they had taken that news pretty hard. And they weren't the only ones to see a change; the Coaches also saw it. \"You think we made the right choice, I mean she doesn't know anyone here and they just took away the only friends that she really knows.\" Coach Boone said looking over at Yoast. \"Well, form the looks of it there really isn't anything we can do. Even though Budds was the one that attacked her first and everything, he still has the right to keep her away from him.\" Yoast said watching the road where he had seen Athena go by. Forty-five minutes later the guys were coming out of the locker room when stopped and said,\" Hey, guys I'm going over to Yoast's house for some help with Chemistry. Anyone want to come?\" \"Boy, we just started school how can you need help?\" Pete said looking at Alan like he was crazy. \"Oh wait, I get it now.\" Pete said smacking himself on the head. \"I think I need some help with government.\" He said giving Gerry a nudge. Soon Gerry, Alan, Sunshine, and Pete piled in to Gerry's car and were on their way to Coach Yoast's house. After making sure that Athena was probably there, they all knocked at once. But the person they thought that was going to answer it turned out to be Sheryl, \"You guys here to see Dad?\" She asked giving them a strange look. \"Nope, little coach we are to see 'Thena.\" Alan said looking down at the mini coach. \"Crazy, ain't here yet, and hopefully she wont come back at all.\" Sheryl said giving them a glare. \"Now, Sheryl don't be hard on 'Thena, she couldn't help what she did. And besides you weren't there so why should you pass judgement on her when if I recall correctly she sent you away, to keep you safe.\" Sunshine said stepping into the hallway. \"Yeah, well who made you my Daddy, so you can take your opinion and keep it to yourself.\" Sheryl said heading up stairs. \"You know Sunshine she does have a point but you had one to, and now I'm confused.\" Pete said with a grin. \"Pete you are always confused.\" The guys said with a laugh. From the kitchen Coach could hear everything from what Sunshine to why they were there. He was glad that the guys were trying to see if Athena was alright and to help Sheryl see that what Athena had done was for her safety. \"Well, since you guys are here already, why not stay for supper, and hopefully Athena will be back soon.\" Coach said, as he walked into the living room, not wanting to turn down free food the guys decided to stay. While the guys where helping Coach set the table since Sheryl hadn't come down since they got there. As if knowing that they were thinking about her, Sheryl came down the sitars yelling, \" Dad she is home!\" As they came up the driveway Athena noticed Gerry's gold camaro. \"Thank you for showing me around that was so much better than me going to the library or something.\" Athena said as she got off the bike. \"No problem, doll face.\" Duke said as he held out his hand to help you. Before anything else could happen Coach walked out on to the porch. \"Athena it's time for dinner, so get inside.\" Coach said as he got on the steps. Athena jumped when she heard the voice behind her. Turning around she said a quite, \"Yes, sir.\" Then mumbled a good night to Duke before walking past Coach and inside the house. Once Athena was inside, Coach looked at Duke with steel eyes and said, \"Thank you for bringing her home, but it's best if you not see her again, Son. Understood.\" \"Yes sir, I understand completely.\" Duke said but before he put his helmet on he turned back to Coach and said, \"You can stop me but what Athena wants, she gets.\" And with that he shoved his helmet on and sped away sending dirt and rocks up on the porch. Inside Athena was being cornered by the guys, \"Thena gal, you don't need to be hanging with that Duke kid.\" Pete said placing an arm around her shoulders. \"Pete's right, Duke is bad news so you steer clear, you hear.\" Gerry coming in from the dining room. If there was one thing Athena hated more in the world besides noisy people, she hated to feel like she was in a corner, even of she knew that it was for the right purpose. Here she was having the worst day of her life and the one person that had actually showed her a good time was gone, and now she had no escape. Gerry was blocking way to the dining room, Sunshine was in front of the stairs, and Pete and Alan had the living room. Taking a deep breath she said, \"What are you guys my Dad now? No you aren't so you know what I think, I think you need to keep your noses out of my life, and just be happy that I made other friends besides a bunch of football players. Who are can't see past the end of their nose.\" She said glaring at the guys. \"Look, 'Thena you are new in town, and we known the kind of person Duke is, we just don't want you to get hurt.\" Alan said walking towards her. She just grinned and said, \"Well, I thank you guys for your concern, but I can take care of myself. And since I have nothing to do after school anymore I need other friends, so if you'll excuse me, I'm hungry.\" Athena said pushing past Gerry. The guys just glanced at each other before following her into the dining room. They all seemed to forget that Yoast had come in and heard the whole conversation. Which had given him an idea that he knew Athena wouldn't like but she would just have to get over it. After dinner the group of teenagers retreated to the living room so Athena could 'help' them. Coach gave them an hour before joining them to break the news to Athena. \"Athena, you are not to have anything to do with Duke are we understood.\" He said crossing his arms over his chest. \"No sir, I don't understand. Simply because you and everyone else have not given me a valid reason not to see him.\" Athena said softly trying to keep her temper in check. The guys just started to get their things so they could make a clean get away, while Sheryl had taken to watch everything from the stairs. \"My reasons young lady are the fact that he is a no good biker, who comes from the wrong side and who likes to trap girls by giving them false words. And those should be simple enough.\" Yoast said. \"Well, if you excused me for saying this, but those are not valid, simply because you are making judgements on his appearance and not by his personality.\" Athena said from the floor. \"I don't make from his appearance. I make them from my experience with him.\" Yoast said sounding a little more aggravated. Meanwhile the guys stopped what they were doing. To see what was going to happen next. \"Well, instead of beating around the bush, why not just tell me straight out.\" Athena said trying to keep her temper in check. \"That fact is that as long as you are here, you will and I repeat you will do as I say. No ifs and or but's.\" Yoast said and without saying another word he walked out of the room. \"What would like me to do then, I can't be with my friends, I have no family. And everyone believes including you and Sheryl, that I tried to kill Ray. The only ones that are on my side are the ones that where there. You except to do as you say and be fine, well here is a news flash. I'm not fine, no body knows what it like for me to walk around every day having people stare at you, trip you and call you a freak. Oh and then there is the big one I ACTUALLY DID TRY TO KILL HIM! But only and only because he attacked me first. So I don't care what you say cause you aren't my Dad, you are not even related to me, because let's not forget I'm from 2004. So I will do as I please and what makes me happy.\" Athena shouted at them before running out of the house. \"Well, that went well dad.\" Sheryl said from the stairs. Coach just glared at her from the living room, which was enough to make her shut up. \"Umm, Coach what was this about her being from 2004?\" Pete said from where he was on the floor. \"Ok, would someone please tell me, why this Duke person is so bad.\" Sunshine said walking in from the kitchen. \"Alright, look Athena is from 2004, she has no clue how she got here or if she can even go back. And now that she is gone who knows what could happen to her.\" Coach Yoast said looking at all the guys. \"Now as for Duke, Sunshine. He has a habit for getting girls pregnant then just leaving them, so I don't know about you guys, but I don't think whatever family Athena has will like the fact that whenever or if she gets back, that she will have a baby. And we all know what happens to a girl here who is pregnant.\" Nobody seemed to notice that Alan was no longer in the house.[Chapter 9] Disclaimer: I do not own any of these characters or Alexandria. Disney and the real people own them. I also do not own any of the songs mentioned or quoted in this story. I do however own my own original characters Athena, the Teachers and any other names, places you may not recognize from the movie. My Notes: Sorry it has taken so long for me to update this story, hopefully you guys haven't abandoned me and if you have, please come back. I have experienced a major case of writer's block, but school is over so I have more time on my hands to get this story back on track. Two Faces Have I Athena wasn't sure how long she had been running or where she was even going, but when she finally stopped she noticed that she was in front of what would be Eric's house. It wasn't like his house that she had left behind, the white paint was gray and the fence was missing pickets here and there, the shutters were hanging on by there hinges in some places if there even was a shutter and the screen door was fallen over. Just like she had done in her own time when she was angry or depressed she would run to her friend's houses for comfort. Not that it would do her any good now, since she was in the past. Where she was alone and things just weren't going the way she thought they would when she would dream about leaving her grandmother's house or if she ever got the chance to go back in time. So she pulled her knees up to her face and started to cry. That was how Alan found her, when he had left the house to follow Athena to make sure that nothing would happen to her. Even though he wouldn't consider himself one of her friends that she could confide in, not like she did with Rev. But like all the other guys on the team he wanted to watch out for her because she was different and in a town like Alexandria where there was already enough problems with the school system and everything, Athena needed people to look out for her. So he tried to approach her very quietly since he wasn't sure how she would take to being followed but that didn't work out that way because once his hand touched the gate it fell to the ground with a loud bang. Athena jumped when she heard the crash; she quickly stood up and wiped the tears from her face so there would be no questions asked. She looked over at Alan and said, \"What are you here to hound about Duke or are just here to take me back. Because I have news for you I'm not going back.\" \"I'm not going to hound you about Duke, it's your life and if you want to mess it up that's fine with me, I wont stop you. I'm not even going to make you go back if you don't want to but I will say this, are you going to do sleep here because if you are then let's hope it doesn't rain and what about food and clothes you haven't thought of that have you. But I just came to see if you were ok and if you needed a friend.\" Alan said has he slowly walked up to the porch. \"Well, I'm glad that you see that it is my life and I need to make my own mistakes. And you are right I could use a friend right now and not some person that is looking to run my life.\" Athena said with a smile. \"Well, I'm glad you think but I do have to say that the Coach was right in saying that as long as you lived with him you need to listen to him. Since you are out of your environment, and I'm not to sure what it's like in your time but things are run differently and if you get into some type of trouble then no one will be able to help you, if you get my meaning.\" Alan said taking a set beside her on the porch. \"Yeah, I get your meaning but what am I supposed to do, the girls hate me and most of the guys at school side with Ray except for you guys. But with the order I can break that, even if there are weekends and you guys could come over after school. What about during school nobody seems to think about that do they?\" Athena said looking over at him. \"Well don't you worry about that we will think of something. So what is it like where you are from. Any friends, that sort of thing?\" Alan said looking up at the sky. Athena knew exactly what he was getting at but the little devil decided to play games with him just a little longer. \"Well, I can say the people there are different back home, well maybe not the guys but most people are ok with the blacks and whites socializing. I even have a friend of mine, Eric, his bi-racial. His dad's black and his mom's white. I don't think you would get that here though. Back home I'm considered strange because I like books, history, and that sort of thing. So to be considered strange here isn't a surprise to me. Even though I miss my friends and the familiar things, I don't want to go back. And since things here have gotten worse for me it only makes me want to go back to them even more.\" She said with a sniffle. \"Well, I don't think you are strange. Everyone is different and I like that if we were all the same that would get boring after awhile. I'm glad things change in the future we need change. But why don't you want to go back?\" He asked placing a hand softly on her shoulder. \"Well, thanks. Not to many guys would agree with you though back home, but since I'm not back home then I guess that doesn't count does it?\" Athena asked with a grin. \"No, I wouldn't say that it does but I can see why you are reserved when it comes to some things. I wouldn't think that you are shy or anything especially after the way you were with the guys. Even though you are stubborn and just a little out spoken.\" Alan said giving her nudge. \"Trust me, I am shy. You just haven't seen that part of me yet. You have just seen the activist part of me and not the pacifist. And besides I'm strong willed not stubborn. You know back home the only guy that I really felt comfortable around was Eric and now you.\" She said giving him a nudge back. \"Strong willed is that what you call it, now. Well all right then, I take that being comfortable around me is a good thing then.\" He asked with a chuckle. \"Not sure yet, but I'll let you know. You might not want to have anything to do with me after you get to know, so don't say I didn't warn you.\" Athena answered with a laugh. \"So what do you say we head back to Coach's house to get things squared away and finally tell Sheryl the truth.\" Alan asked her hoping that she would say yes. Athena sat there for a moment thinking about what to do, she understood what Alan was trying to do and she really appreciated it. She very well couldn't stay out here all night; it was already cold enough since it was the beginning of September. She let out a sigh before saying, \"Yeah, I guess I need to go back can't have the Coach worrying about me, right.\" She said as she stood up. Once they got back to Yoast's house, Athena was confronted by questions about the future. To which is she just that they would have to be patience because they would live to see it. After the guys tried to get more information out of her by trying to seem uninterested by the topic until Pete said, \"I think they will have flying cars and things like that. What do you think 'Thena?\" She finally told them that they needed to change the subject because she wasn't going to tell them no matter how hard they tried. While they were in the living room the grand father clock in the hallway struck nine telling the guys that they had stayed long enough since they all school in the morning and they couldn't afford to be sleepy for practice even if they were over at the Coach's house. As the guys were leaving Athena made sure to tell each one goodnight, but as Alan was walking out the she stopped him with her arm and gave him a hug. \"Thanks, for coming to talk to me, not sure what I would have done.\" But before he could say anything she went back into the house and shut the door in his face. \"Well, your welcome.\" He said to the door before joining the guys who had taken to laughing at him. On the other side of the door Athena let out a sigh , \"Well, now I just have to talk to two people and maybe a third.\" She thought to herself. She pushed herself off of the door and made her way into the kitchen to help Coach and Sheryl clean up. When she got there Sheryl just sent her look that in Athena's mind would have killed her if, Sheryl had acted upon it. She looked over at Coach, who didn't seem too happy with right now, either. So she just figured to leave at that and help Sheryl dry the dishes. After a few minutes she cleared her throat and said, \"I'm sorry for the way I acted earlier when you told me that I wasn't allowed to see Duke anymore, but you have understand how it feels for me. Being in a new place, not knowing anyone and then having a whole town thinking that I killed someone.\" To which Sheryl just let out a laugh. Athena just looked over at Sheryl and said, \"And that is what I am talking, people judging me when they weren't even there to know the whole story and wont even ask me what is true or not because they can't see past the end of nose.\" Before his daughter could say anything, Coach placed a hand on Sheryl's shoulder to keep from losing her temper. Sitting down at the table he looked at Athena and said, \"Well, I appreciate your apology. I can say that I wouldn't know what it would be like for me if I were in your shoes. But you have understand that I know what these people are like, so I am only trying to look out for you like your father would do if you were home.\" At the mention of her father Athena stiffened, how could she tell him that she didn't have either of her parents but only a grandmother that really didn't want her around, nor did she love her. Now was probably a good time to come clean with him since was going to be living with him for awhile. Sitting down she squared her shoulders and plainly said, \"I have no parents.\" After a few minutes of silence Coach finally said, \"Well, if you don't mind me asking what happened to them?\" It took awhile for Athena to answer since no one except her grandmother knew the full story of her parents. \"Well, I guess you could say it goes back to before I was born. Mother was raised in a very strict religious household. She wasn't allowed to do anything with boys, go to dances or anything like that before she turned eighteen. Needless to say she didn't follow Grandmother's wishes and rebelled against her. When she was 17 she meet my father, eloped and a few years later had me. All to the disappointment of Grandmother, so she disowned her. When I was twelve Daddy left to find a better job, which he did find in California as a Forest Fire Ranger. Needless to say he died, Mother went crazy and just packed up and left me by myself. Children's Services came and took me to my Grandmother's in Alexandria, which was when I was fifteen. Now two years later after facing mental from Grandmother who thinks that I will turn out like the whore that is my mother and the low life that was my father. I am here in 1971 my parents hometown where now I am hated because while defending myself I almost killed someone.\" \"I don't believe you, you weren't defending yourself. You tried to kill ray because you couldn't stand him ragging on you all the time. So you decided to end all.\" Sheryl said. \"If I recall Sheryl, I sent you away so you wouldn't get hurt. Because whether you like it or not Ray would have hit you also because he stand to see any of us going to Church with Rev. So he and his buddies jumped us. And if it weren't for me then something bad probably would have happened to you so before passing judgement on me why not look at the whole picture before you speak. Don't you think that I regret what I did, or don't you remember the three days I spent in my room not talking anyone because of the guilt I felt and then to have one of the first people I befriended turn their back on me when I needed them. But you wouldn't know how that feels would you. I could have stayed where I was when Alan found me, but instead with his help I decided to come back to tell my story and to apologize. So you wouldn't judge me anymore, but I see now that I was wrong to think that you were the type a girl that would judge people before getting to know them or before knowing the whole story.\" Athena said finally before standing up a walking out of the room. Coach just sighed and looked at his daughter who looked back and said, \"What I didn't do anything, she is the one that did it.\" Coach just shook his head and said, \"Don't you remember what it was like after your mother left, how everyone was talking and giving us strange looks like we did something when we really didn't. And how angry you felt because they didn't understand what had happened between me and your mother. Wouldn't you say that you are doing the same thing to Athena that the town did to us years ago? And if you do understand that, then can you understand why Athena feels so angry and sad that her friends have turned their back on her when she needs the most. Since from the sounds of it she has no family here and from the looks of it hardly any friends and no family back where she is from.\" Sheryl just sighed and looked at her father before saying, \"Yeah, I guess I was wrong wasn't I?\" \"So what do you think you need to do, now?\" Coach asked with a smile. \"I need to go and talk to Athena, and tell her that I'm sorry for the things I said and to let you know that I'm still her friend, right?\" She asked with a small smile. \"There you go. So why don't you go and do your thing and I'll finish the dishes.\" Coach said giving her a pat on the back. \" She couldn't be but what if she is then what do I do, then?\" Coach said to himself as he finished the dishes.[Chapter 10] Disclaimer : I don't own the Titans nor Alexandria, I do own the things younhaven't heard of. The song titles I don't own. My Note: I'mnsorry it's taken awhile to get this chapter up. I was in thenhospital for a virus but I'm ok now as you can tell. Then we hadnsome computer problems, mainly from lighting, just gotta love MothernNature, let me tell you. Now hopefully I can keep this updated fornyou guys. Now on with the story, I hope you like this chapter. Cause You MovenMe Sherylnwalked up to Athena's door, and lightly knocked. She waited for anfew minutes and when her answer came she just walked right on in. Shenlooked around the room until her eyes rested on the open window, sonshe climbed out the window on to the roof where she spotted Athenanlaying down looking up at the sky. \"Hey,nlook I'm sorry about what I said earlier, I didn't meant to. Inknow what it's like not to have anyone on your side.\" Sheryl saidntaking a spot next to Athena. \"Well,napology accepted. I hope you can understand why I did what I did.\"nAthena said looking over at her. \"Indo now, I just didn't at the time. Guess I'm closed minded likenthe rest of them.\" Sheryl said with a sigh. \"Naw,nyou were just being you. And I can understand that.\" Athena saidnwith a chuckle. \"Now what you do say we head back in and go helpnCoach.\" Athena said as she got up to back inside. Thennext day at school it was a whole other world than the one she was innyesterday, she was given her new schedule which only had her with anfew of her friends. She saw the guys standing by some lockers, but asnshe started to walk over towards them, Ray walked over sending her anglare. So she just waved to them and walked right on by. \"Nonsense in causing in trouble.\" And that was something shenpromised Coach last night was not to get into trouble. \"Servesnher right for what she tried to do to me.\" Ray said as he watchednher walk down the hall. \"WhatevernRay. I'm tried of hearing how you about how 'Thena almost killednyou, when you know she was defending herself. I'll see you guysnlater it's suddenly gotten a little to crowded for me. Hey 'Thenangal wait up.\" Alan said as he took off down the hall. \"Hey,nAlan wait up man. I'll go with you.\" Sunshine said trotting offndown he hall with Alan. \"What'snstuck up their butt's?\" Ray asked looking over at Garry. \"Indon't know maybe you can tell. I've got to get to class.\" Garrynsaid without another word. Raynjust stood watching Garry as he walked down the hall. \"She'sngotten into everyone heads. Looks like I need to get my plan intonaction.\" Ray told himself as he walked out of the school to meetnhis business associate. Athenanwalked into her first class very slowly. She was surprised to see twonpeople she knew. At least one anyway. She smiled at Duke who wasnsitting in the back of the class. But with Math being her worstnsubject, Athena opted for middle, in a desk behind Emma. Emma gavenher a cold glare as she sat down. \"Isnthere anything I can help you with, Princess?\" Athena said lookingnEmma in the face. \"Youncan help me by staying away from Garry. Because I have news for you,nhis mine.\" Emma said putting an ephapis on the word mine. \"Oh,nreally now. I didn't know that he was live stock, someone betterninform animal control, since there is a bull running aroundnAlexandria. But really Princess, you didn't seem to keen on himnhaving Big Ju as a friend, so what do you think of that?\" Athenanasked getting closer to Emma's face. \"Insay it isn't any of your business what I think and it's all justnphase anyway.\" Emma said in a huff. \"Ifnwhat Garry is doing is just a phase then I must be the President ofnthe I'm stupid for life club. Princess sweetie, I have news for younthis isn't a phase he is going through, so you might want to get onnboard or just stand on the sidewalk and wave good bye.\" Athena saidnbut before she could say more she was cut off when the teacher walkednin. Emmannot noticing that their teacher had just arrived started to saynsomething but she was interrupted by Coach Parker asking if there wasnsomething that the whole class should know. Before she could saynanything a voice come from the back. \"Sir,nI think she wants to know who has more hairspray because she is allnout and if she doesn't get more then her head will fall off becausenit's made of air, and we wouldn't Princess to float to away.\"nDuke said in a serious voice. Whichncaused some of the other students to chuckle. Even Athena, whonwhispered to Emma, \"I think I know a girl who has some you mightnwant to ask her.\" Emmanjust turned around glared at the both of them. AfternCoach Parker got everyone settled down. He branched off into thenwonderful world of cosigns and all that jazz. Athenanlet out a yawn and glanced back at Duke who seemed to be interestednin craving something on his desk, as if right on cue he looked up andnsent her smile. Athena gave him smile before turning to look at thenboard again. She didn't notice that he looked out the window andnnodded his head to someone outside. Forty-fivenminutes later, Athena was walking down the hall when an arm camenaround her shoulder. \"I liked your little spat with Princess backnthere doll face.\" Duke said falling into step beside her. \"Ingathered as much.\" Athena said with a small laugh. Asnthey were walking down the hall. Alan, Sunshine and Garry came fromnone of the other hallways. Athena knew this probably wasn't a veryngood idea and judging by the way they were staring at her. It lookednthey didn't like the fact that Duke's arm was around hernshoulder. So she wiggled out form his arm and put a little more spacenbetween them. Asnthe guys turned the corner, they all couldn't believe what theynwere seeing. Athena, the girl who told them last night to think aboutnwhat they said; was now walking down the hall with Duke's armnaround her shoulders. All three felt a pull in their guts at thisnsight, even though they all acted like she was their sister, it'snsafe to say that all three felt something for her. (Uh Oh, loventriangle or is it?) \"Hey,n'Thena gal!\" Sunshine said coming up to them. \"I miss you innCates class, just not the same without you.\" \"Yeah,nI know but I don't have him until 6th period now. Younguys going off to Chemistry?\" She asked looking at them wishingnthat this meeting didn't feel ackward. \"Yeahnwhere else would be going?\" Garry asked with a smile. \"Inknow a place you could go Wonder Boy.\" Duke said giving Garry ancold stare. Garrynwas about to say something to him, but Athena jumped right in beforenhe could asking, \"Hey, Superman. Do you think you and guys couldncome over tonight that way I get to see how well you guys are doingnwithout me as manger.\" \"Yeah,nI guess we can. I don't see why not.\" Garry said looking over atnher but not before he returned his stare right back at Duke. \"Umm,nAlan who do you have 6th Cates, right?\" Athena askedngiving a nervous glance between Garry and Duke. \"Yeah,nI do with Blue why?\" Alan asked looking over at her since hisnattention was drawn away from Garry and Duke. \"Well,ndo you think I could sit with you guys?\" Athena asked. \"Girl,nyou don't even have to ask something like that.\" Sunshine jumpingnin to keep Garry and Duke quite. \"Inknow, but I wasn't sure you know.\" Athena said with a smile. \"Ofncourse you can sit with us, you might even keep us from fallingnasleep.\" Alan said with a laugh. \"Well,ndoll face I'm heading off to the pit if you wanna find me thatnwhere I'll be.\" Duke said before he gave her a hug. Whennhe was gone Garry turned toward her and said, \" I thought wenalready went through this.\" \"Inknow, I know. Just give me some time all right. Now I have to bengoing or I'm going to be late for English.\" Athena said as shengave each of them a hug before taking off down the hall. \"Indon't think she'll ever get rid of him.\" Garry said watchingnher walk away. \"Givenher some credit it's not like she can hang out with us all time,nnow.\" Alan said from behind Garry. \"Oh,ncome you to before we are late ourselves.\" Sunshine said as he tooknoff towards their classroom.[Chapter 11] Don't Get Hooked On Me My Note : Sorry it's taken me so long to update this, but i have been busy with school, work and everything else that has happened. This isn't all of it so I will edit it here in the next few days. I just wanted you guys to have something to read. And once I again I only own the things you don't recongize from the Movie so please don't take them. \"Well, that didn't go so bad after all.\" Athena thought herself as she walked down the front steps of the school. She had some of her classes with the guys, which wasn't so bad. Some of them even skipped their advising period to eat with her at lunch, which was mainly Blue, and Louie. The others would just happen to walk by the cafeteria. She finally had to explain to Duke that they were just going to be friends he acted like he understood, but there was something in the way he acted that told her, she needed to keep her guard up just in case. Why is it that even with everyone around me, I still feel alone? She kept asking herself that over and over. Once the final bell rang she started to walk down to the field but she remembered that with her run in with Ray that wasn't going to happen. \" So much for being with the guys.\" She thought to herself. She wanted so bad to be out there with Sheryl cheering them on but she was forced to sit under a tree with her books and just watch them. Every so often she would send one of them a wave when they would look up at her. From her viewpoint she could tell that there was something a miss with them because they were acting too much like a team. And any smart person would know that it was because of what happened with her and Ray. Which was understandable because it did tear the guys apart, especially Gerry and Ray. Hell they were friends since they were in diapers from she had heard. She couldn't help but watch the guys, watching them was almost like watching a ballet. She finally realized that she had avoided her algebra work long enough. Sighing she pulled out her book and paper a tried to get started but since math was not her strong subject she was having major problems with it. And her actions did not go unnoticed. Gerry watched as Athena brushed a strand of hair out of her face again and again before finally putting her hair up in a bun with an extra pencil. In the few weeks she had been there Athena had caused some upsets. Not only in the way she acted which was totally something that the town had never seen but even with the team. Since she was so different that had caused some of the other members to have their secret crushes. Gerry even had to admit that he felt something for her as well. Even though Julius was right he did have Emma but she wasn't speaking to him right now so technically they weren't together. He finally realized that he needed to get back to work when a football hit him the back of the head curtsey of Sunshine. When he looked back over at Athena, she was looking at him with a smile on her face. Gerry was not the only one who had felt something for Athena that was a more the friends kind of feel. Both Alan and Sunshine felt something for her as well, though they would never say anything since it was obvious that their captain liked her. Though neither was exactly willing to let it go. But that was understandable since Athena had thrown everyone off balance the day she had walked well fell into their lives. Not only was she quick witted but she was also very caring which was something most of the girls in the town did not have. For Sunshine it was the fact that she reminded him so much of California, in the way she dressed and acted that it was like being at home with her where ever they were. For Alan it was the fact that she had that natural beauty going for her, she never had to cake on the make up, not that she wear any. And no matter what the problem was she would always try to help you fix it. But once again Gerry had beaten him into trying to get the girl. Something Gerry was good at and would always be good at. All three were brought out of their daydreams when Boone blew his whistle at them and finally made them run laps. While the other guys did their drills he couldn't but smile knowing the reason behind why the three were day dreaming. Athena had finally had enough of everyone staring at her like she was some alien on display. She threw her books in her backpack and went to walk around town while she waited on Coach to finish with practice. She stopped at the dinner when she saw a sign saying that they needed part time help, and since she couldn't help Coach any more she had to occupy her time somehow. Taking a deep breath she walked in the door to see what she could get. Ten minutes later Athena had herself a part time job on Tuesdays and Thursdays. As she walked back to the field. She smiled to herself as she remembered Alan, Gerry, Sunshine and Big Ju coming up behind her while she was in the library. Apparently she had dozed off. She let out a loud yelp when they tipped her chair back from the table. Causing her to get a disappointing look from the librarian. Settling back down underneath tree she felt amazed at how relaxed she felt. It was like a weight had been lifted off her shoulders. Everything seemed to be slower here; she didn't feel rushed at all. Unlike at home were everything seemed to move faster. And the guys made her feel safe and wanted. A fact that she now knew that she had people that really cared for her; made her life. She smiled as she thought of this but at the same time she felt homesick for her friends. She wondered what they were doing. Misty was probably worried she hadn't come back at least to give her advice about her guy troubles. Eric was probably to busy with his girlfriend to even care. She let out a sigh as she looked up at the sky. After a few minutes she dozed off. The guys walked up the hill to find Athena asleep on her algebra book. \"Well, do you think we should wake her up?\" Petey asked as he sat down beside her backpack. \"No, Petey we are just going to let her sleep the rest of the day away. Of course we are going to wake her man what is wrong with your head.\" Blue said as he came up the hill. \"Well, now that we know all that, how are we going to wake her up?\" Petey asked before blowing into two blades of grass. \"Cause for all we know she could just get all pissed off and hit us all over the head.\" Louie said coming up behind Blue. \"Well, since you guys are to scared to do it, I'll do it myself then. It's not like I haven't been almost hit by her before.\" Sunshine said as he went over to wake her up. He couldn't help but feel guilty for wanting to let her sleep just so he and the other guys could watch her sleep some more but that suddenly made him to much like a stalker. So he took a deep breath and gently shook Athena's shoulder. \"Hey, 'Thena gal your nap time is over time to wake up.\" He told her as he moved her shoulder. Athena jumped with a start and not remembering that she had feel asleep outside sat up and said, \" Yes, Coach Parker in the equation 4x+68, x2.\" Her mind slowly cleared and she could hear the laughter of the guys. She looked around and let out a groan. \"Oh, piss off you guys.\" She told them in a mumbled tone. \"Well, 'Thena gal. You have to realize that you aren't in your algebra class anymore. Though that was the correct answer.\" Rev told her with a smile. She couldn't stay mad with Rev even if she tried. He was just too nice to even be mean to. \"Well, you know I had a good tutor. And you would know wouldn't you?\" She asked him with a smile. \"Yes, I suppose I would.\" He replied with a smile and a wink. Three of the guys standing there had to tried so hard not run over and tackle Rev for winking at her. Though they knew that she had no idea that they liked her as more than a friend. Athena sent them all a smile before getting up and brushing herself off and saying, \"Well, guys I have some good news, as of today I have a part time job working at Murphy's on Tuesday and Thursday nights. So let's go celebrate at Kay's Castle with some ice cream.\"[Chapter 12] Authors note Thanks for the reviewsnguys, I know it's been awhile but things in my life haven't beennso great.

Seeing asnRemember the Titans is my newest obsession, I felt the desire tonstart a new story, who knows it might even motivate me to work on mynothers. This piece will mainly revolve around the personal memoir ofnan oc character and what her life was like with the boys, and whonknows I might even throw in some love. Well enjoy and review if you'dnlike, thanks for reading! Disclaimer:nThis will be the big disclaimer for my entire story because I'llnprobably forget further in to do it again. I own absolutely nothing,nas sad and depressing as that may be. Everyone involved in thisnwonderful story belongs to themselves or Disney, not me (again, anvery depressing sentiment). SidenNote: The italics representnour charcter in modern day looking back at the year 1971. Regularntyping is her first person narration of what happened that day ornevent, like she's reliving it. NewnYork, New York 1989 1971,nthat was the year that everything change for us in the small town ofnAlexandria. Many people there will try and tell you that it wasn\"tough, but we made it through\", well . . . they would be sugarncoating what it really was. I was once asked to describe thatnhistoric year in three words. That was easy. It. Was. Hell. You couldnbarely walk down the streets without hearing snide comments or seeingnangry protesters screaming how they didn't want their preciousnbabies to be forced to mingle with those they opposed. It was a crazyntime, but even though I absolutely despised most of that year; it wasnthe one I look back on the most. It wasn't until that year that Inmet the people who would end up meaning the most to me; my truenfriends, my real family, my true love. 1971 . . . that was the yearnwhen I truly began to live. Itnall started that summer the colored boy was shot; Daddy was always onnthe military base, just incase something got out of hand and they hadnto call in the troops. He was always hesitant to let me out of thenhouse in fear I would get caught up in something (the streets werenturning out to be more dangerous than any of us could have imagined),nbut he kept promising it would get better after a while. We had justnmoved back to Alexandria, we had lived there for quite a while when Inwas younger but moved once my father had gotten his promotion. AfternDaddy heard that Alexandria had finally started to integrate henturned in his transfer request forms within the same day. Althoughnonly Mom was from Virginia, he always thought of Alexandria as home.nAdd that to the fact that he had always been for civil rights andnour move was no surprise. We had only been back for about a month,nright at the start of summer and so far the only people I knew wherenDaddy's marine friends and our neighbors the Lastiks. It wasnbecause of my friendship with Louie that I had the chance to meet thenfootball team. I still remember the day I first met the Lastiks . . . Alexandria,nVirginia 1971 \"Leannansweetheart, hurry up and get down here, we have guests!\" Inwas currently enjoying the silence of my room after a quick trip innto town, and let me tell you, even though school is still a fewnmonths away the protesters obviously wanted an early start. Thentownspeople had definitely NOT been happy about the whole integrationnissue and they had made their point clear quite frequently andnloudly; Hell, they even started a riot in the streets. Lt. Carter,nwho offered to be my warden whenever I wanted to go into town atnDaddy's request, had dragged me back to the truck and locked me innwhile he and some other marines tried to break it up. Not that Inblamed him, Daddy would have been pissed if I had gotten hurt.nLooking back, I really should have just stayed home and saved myselfnthe headache; but I was under the impression that I might meet somenpeople my own age. Afterna quick look in the mirror to make sure I was presentable, I forcednmyself from the comfort and solitude of my room to go meet the guestsnDaddy mentioned; wondering if they were more of his Navy friends. Ingot to the landing and paused a minute behind the wall that kept menout of sight so I could have the chance to see what I was about tonendure. Granted, that seemed mean, but at this point I didn't thinknI could handle another story from some guy I never met about how henand my Dad had fought some war in some place during some year fornsome cause. I'm proud of my Dad, really I am, but it scared me tonthink of what he had gone through. Intook a quick peek around the wall and for the first time in thatnmonth we moved there I was genuinely excited at who I was about tonmeet. A nice looking couple stood besides my father talking aboutnsomething or other, but I was more interested in the boy. He lookednabout my age and in this neighborhood that was a rarity. Most of thenpeople here were either Daddy's age or younger couples, so the onlynkids I ever saw were between the ages of newborn and nine or goingnoff to collage in the fall, so the opportunity to meet someone whonmight go to my high school was a thrilling concept to me. I continuedndown the stairs and waited at the bottom until Daddy noticed me, henis usually the one who will do the introductions for me; gives me anchance to examine the people I'm meeting. \"nOh Leanna, there you are.nHoney I want you to meet the Lastiks; they just moved in next door.\"nHe introduced as I moved over to his side to meet our new neighbors. \"Nicento meet you. I've know your father for a while now and he alwaysnspeaks of you with such pride.\" Mr. Lastik smiled and offered menhis hand. I smiled back politely and accepted the handshake as hencontinued to introduce me to the rest of his family. \"nThis is my wife Natalie andnour son Louis. He's going in to his senior year this year\" He andnhis wife continued to chat with my father, giving me a chance tonasses our new neighbors. Mr. Lastik was a big guy with a genuinensmile, the kind that made the word \"jolly\" pop to mind. His wifenNatalie seemed to be a very sweet lady with blonde hair and some ofnthe brightest green eyes I have ever seen. Then I turned my attentionnto their son, Louis. He was a big guy with the same blond hair as hisnmother, cut short so it barely hung around his ears. He had anfriendly face and a firm handshake with very expressive eyes. Daddynalways says you can tell a lot about a person from the look in theirneyes and the handshake they give. He told me when I was younger thatnthe eyes are the window to the soul, and a persons true feelings cannalways be seen in them; add to that a firm handshake and it shows thenpersons has responsibility, strength, and respect. Louisnseemed like the kind of guy I could be friends with, and as any navynbrat will tell you, if you can make one friend before going into thenactual school, then it's a blessing. Daddy invited them into thenliving room so they could continue their conversation, probablyntalking about the good old days in service, leaving Louis and I innthe hall. \"nHi, your name's Leannanright?\" He asked with a curious expression, \"I'm Louis, but youncan just call me Louie\". \"Yeah,nyou can call me Annie. I don't know what they were thinking whennthey named me Leanna\", I responded with a laugh. He seemed nice,nand even if he's a year older than me, I'm not in a position tonreject friends. Turns out he had been thinking along the same lines. \"nSo it looks like were bothnin the same boat being new in all, how long has your father been innthe service?\" He seemed to be genuinely interested. \"nPretty much all my life; wenactually started out in Alexandria and started moving around a lotnwhen I was eight. Dad says its time to start slowing down, so henthought it would be nice to come back home\" \"nYeah I know the feeling,nwe've moved around a lot to, I think I've been to like 6 highnschools in the past three years, but Dad promised we wouldn't movenagain\" Wencontinued like that for about an hour, just sitting and talking andngetting to know each other. We seemed to have a lot in common fromnour taste in music to how we viewed the issues going on. When thentime came for the Lastiks to go home I had a good feeling that he andnI would be friends for a while. Goodbyes were said with promises ofnfuture gatherings and then it was just my Dad and I. \"nSo honey, how do you likenthem, you and Louis seemed to hit it off\" Dad asked with wink.nHonestly, as much as my dad jokes around with me about boys, if Inever brought one home I think he would start to cry; after all it hadnbeen just me and him for years. Ever since Momma died, Daddy and Informed a bond that not many fathers and daughters had. Although wengot along fabulously by ourselves, I could always tell that he wasnafraid he wasn't raising me as well as two parents would. Being ansingle parent was hard enough without having to worry about yournchild while you worked countless hours. Add that to the fears ofnattempting to raise a young girl into a respectable women without thenaid of a mother, and it was enough pressure to make any grown manncringe. \"nNo worries Daddy, no boy isngonna steal me away yet, but I do think I just found a friend to helpnme fight through the school year\", I replied with a laugh. I meannLouie is real nice and all, but I didn't think I could see myselfndating him. He kind of reminded me of the big brother I alwaysnwanted. Littlendid I know that the year would hold changes for me that I nevernthought possible, bringing me friends, and extension of my family,nand surprisingly enough a love with an entirely different boy. Yes,nI remember 1971 quite well; that was the year that I began to live .n. . ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- AN:nalright everyone, thanks for reading the first installment of mynremember the titans fic, it's a bit dry and long but I needed tonget the basis down. Stayed tuned for the next chapter when we finallynmeet our favorite football team and learn a little more aboutnLeanna……Drop a review to tell me what you think Peacenout![Chapter 2] AN:nHello fellow RTT lovers! Welcome to the second installment of Throughnthe eyes of a navy brat! (I cant believe I'm actually updating thisnsoon, but after seeing a lovely review, I was motivated to keepnworking) What exciting new people will Leanna meet today? Thanks fornreading and drop a review if you feel like it! Disclaimer:nAs previously stated, I very sadly own nothing or no one. Quitendepressing, but I get total control over Leanna and her family…….readnon! NewnYork, New York 1989 Itnhad been a week since I was first introduced to the Lastiks, and likenDaddy said Louie and I hit it off right away. It was funny, we hadnonly know each other for 7 days, yet in that time we managed to formna bond that not even a lifetime of memories could compete with. I hadngained the brother I always wanted, and after a while when we wouldnmeet new people, Louie would go right ahead and introduce me as hisnsister. Daddy had been happy that I had made a friend so fast. Henalways was worried about me when it came to meeting new people. Backnthen I never really had a lot of friends; granted, it was hard tonkeep them considering we moved all the time. That first week had beennone of the best times I have ever had after a move to a new town. Itnwas that week when I learned about football. Louie had been tryingnand failing miserably to explain \"the finer points of football\"nto me; he told me there was no way that I was going to live innAlexandria and next to him and not understand the game. After a fewnfailed sessions of 'teach Annie football', I remembered that Insaw a poster for football signup when me and Daddy went to get menregistered for school. Louie was so excited when I had told him, thatnhe barely had time to tell his parents where he was going before he dragged me to my house to ask myndad if I could come with him. Daddy had been letting me go outnwithout him or his marine buddies for those last few days as long asnLouie was with me, so it wasn't a real surprise when he agreed andnsent us off. That was the day when I first met the titans…… \"Comenon Annie, hurry up we don't wanna be late for the fist meeting!\"nLouie huffed out as he grabbed my arm to hurry me along to the gym. Indon't think I have seen Louie move that fast. I had to run to keepnup with him as he rushed across the parking lot. \"nI still don't see why Inhad to come, I know that footballs important to you, but it's notnlike I'm going out for the team\", Like I would make it even IFnthey let girls play. \"nConsidering that I havenfailed miserably to teach you how to play, maybe a whole footballnteam can explain it to you\", he teased with a grin, looking backnfor a moment to shoot me a 'your not getting out of this' look.n\" besides this will give us a chance to meet some new people, yourngonna need a safety net for when school starts.\" Although at thisnpoint I was seriously dreading the fact that for the next hour or sonI was gonna be stuck in the bleachers while a bunch of random guysnstared at the weird onlooker; I couldn't argue with the fact that Inwas in need of friends. Plus, it couldn't be that bad…I was verynwrong. Louienran into the gym while I walked in quietly, trying not to gain anynattention while I escaped to the bleachers. Let me tell you; firstnimpressions are important, but nothing on earth or heaven could havenprepared me for what I was going into. The second we entered the gymnabout twenty black guys and two older men all stopped and stared.nLouie ran right ahead and got in line but I held back, trying not tonact too shocked or uncomfortable. I grew up in a house where everyonenshould be thought of as equal, so their color didn't bother me.nWhat did was the fact that the minute we stepped in that gym, allneyes were on us. Talk about awkward. The tension and silence in thatnroom was just enough to make me want to bolt, but that would justnturn an uncomfortable situation worse; so I did all I could to makenit to the bleachers without tripping or falling or doing anythingnthat would make me look like a bigger loser than I did right then.nThank god that the man who I guessed was coach turned his attentionnto Louie, effectively catching all other eyes. \"Andnwho in the name of heaven might you be?\" The man who seemed to be ancoach asked Louie. \"LouienLastik, offensive lineman. Naval family, just moved here fromnBayonne. My neighbor told me about the signup so I come runnin'.\"nAt this point he felt it was necessary to put the attention back onnme, effectively naming me as the neighbor. \"What'sngoin' on, everybody?\" Louie said trying to act friendly, but innthis crowd you could quite literally cut the tension with a knife andnthe looks that were sent our way would have been enough to scare anturtle back in its shell. The two coaches just stood there lookingnover Louie when the lead coach decided to bring me into the equation. \"Whatnabout you, what's your reason for being here?\" He asked, snappingnme out of my thoughts once I realized I was the one he was talkingnto. \"Oh,nI'm Leanna O'Connell….Louie's my ride home, but if this is anprivate meeting I can wait outside\" I replied softly as I startednto stand in case he wanted me to leave. To be honest, at that point Inwas hoping that he would want me to. I didn't think my face couldnget any hotter before I burst into flames. \"No,nthat's alright you can stay\", he replied, although a part of menfelt like it forced, but not wanting to drawn more attention tonmyself I sat back down. At this point I was silently praying fornsomeone, anyone to break the silence…amazing how if you pray hardnenough your always answered; though not always in the way you hope. Rightnas the Coaches went back to scrutinizing Louie, the gym doors quitenliterally burst open to revel about 20 or so white boys led into thengym by two older guys. The two groups lined up across from each othernas all four of the older gentleman faced off, and let me tell you . .n. they were all pissed. Thenfour coaches left the gym, and we could here them yelling in thenhallways as they made their way to their office leaving the twongroups lined up across from each other with about a ten foot spacenbetween them. Whites on one side and blacks on the other, anynbystander could feel the negativity and animosity seep into the gym.nCompared to when we first got here, the tension now…it was bad,nalmost scary. No one dared to speak a word; I secretly thought thatnif someone did say something, an all out race war would start. Wenstayed in that silence for a good fifteen minutes or so until allnfour coaches came back. The lead black coach; named Herman Boone as Insoon found out, went through all the rules about playing on his team.nThen the two white coaches who would be coaching defense werenintroduced. Yoast had an eery calm to him but his assistant Tyrell,nhe annoyed me. I don't know what it was but he just rubbed me thenwrong way. Afternthe awkward formalities were done, coach Boone's assistant, wentnback through all the boys collecting names and positions. As he madenhis way through the black side, I managed to catch scraps ofninformation on some of the players; most talking to softly to insurensecrecy between the two sides. Three of the players who gave offntheir names in the beginning sounded really familiar to me, thoughnwhen trying to find them in the crowd I couldn't place a familiarnface. It continued like this with relative silence except for thenmumbling of introductions as I waited for them to get back to Louie.nOnce they did, the white players glared at him like he just shotntheir mothers…what, did they want him to jump sides because ofntheir stupidity? Coach Hines made his way around the gym, gettingnmore resistance and glares from the white boys until everyone wasnregistered. After a few more minutes of instructions from both Boonenand Yoast, the boys were finally sent home with reminders of when tonmeet the bus for camp…I was NOT happy. \"nI cant believe your gonnanditch me for two weeks to go hang out with a bunch of guys whonobviously hate each other!\" I complained as Louie and I went out tonthe parking lot. \"nI'm sorry Annie, but younheard coach, if I don't go I don't play\" \"Yeah,nI heard coach sunshine. He seems like a real ball of fun\", yes Inwas being petty; but Louie is quite literally the only guy I know sonwhen he leaves then I'm back to being alone and stuck on housenarrest. \"Annienit wont be that bad, besides maybe you'll meet some new peoplenwhile I'm gone\", he replied, receiving a look of total disbeliefnfrom me. \"Ok,nso maybe you wont, but this way I can get to know the guys and if Inmake friends with them, then you will have a connection to get you innwith the whole football team\", he smiled, obviously attempting tonmake me feel better about my upcoming two weeks of solitude. I reallynshouldn't be that upset, it's not like he's leaving tomorrow;ncamp doesn't start for another couple of weeks. I guess me acting anbit bitchy was just a side effect of spending the last hour in a roomnseeping with hate. \"Callnme crazy Louie, but if what I just saw is any measure of what thesenguys are really like, I'm not sure I want to be 'in' with thenfootball team.\" \"Don'tnworry, everything is just a little shaky right now. Things will getnbetter.\" \"That'snwhat my Dad says, but these people have been hating each other fornyears. I'm not so sure it will get better.\" Sure, I'm a littlenpessimistic right now, but the human race was really getting on mynnerves. People are so blinded by hate that after a while it justnbecomes a way of life. \"nJust give it time, it willnget better\", Louie responded. At times like these I really don'tnsee how he could be such an optimist. \"Howndo you know\" \"BecausenI have faith\", so with a smile he drove us back to the naval base;nhim with his hope and me with doubts that things could ever getnbetter, especially with the people we just saw. Talk about firstnimpressions…….. Hardnto believe how far we have all come. Believe it or not, I oncencouldn't stand the titans but now we're inseparable. In that onenyear I went from disliking the whole team to have them becoming mynfamily . . . and falling in love with one amazing Titan.

Disclaimer:nAgain, I own absolutely nothing that seems even remotelynfamiliar….sigh ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- NewnYork, New York 1989 Thosenlast few weeks before Louie went off to camp flew by, and he hadnbecome more determined than ever to teach me football; always said itnwas his personal goal before camp. At that point I had finallynmanaged to understand what his job was on the field, though I didn'tnreally see why any of that was helping. I still think he was justntrying to make me understand so if his 'make friends' techniquendidn't end up working, I would have been able to tolerate football;nalthough I didn't see why, but it had been a big deal to Lou. Henhad been so excited about camp, before he left he always said he hadna good feeling that what would happen there would change the wholenteam to make them . . . well, into a team; after a while, even I gotnhopeful that camp would work. Itnhad been the night before camp started and our families were havingnone last fling to send him off to what he now calls the hardest twonweeks of his life. Louie and I were sitting on the back porch talkingnthat night. I don't know why but we had been in the sharing moodnthat night. I don't think I ever told someone that much about mynpersonal life in one sitting, but I guess in view of the events wenneeded someone we could trust . . . especially with that particularnschool year . . . \"nSo, you've really been tonsix high schools?\" I asked. Six high schools sounded like hell tonme, I couldn't stand being the new kid twice a year. \"Yea,nit really isn't as bad as it sounds…..\" he laughed. We had beenntalking about our lives all night. I don't know what got into us,nbut sharing all of this stuff with someone…it was nice. Afternmoving to a new place it's always hard to find someone to trustnwith your life story, but I guess that in a town were nobody trustednanybody we wanted someone to help bare the burdens. Wenlapsed into silence for a while, just thinking about everything thatnwas going on. In these last few hours I had learned more about himnthan in the past month we had been friends. It was nice to know sonmuch about someone; it showed that they trusted you and in return youncould depend on them. Wenlaid our lives out that night, he told me about his dad's work withnthe civil rights movements and how he had been moving from state tonstate since he was ten. In return I told him about my Dad's toursnof duty and about what Alexandria was like when we first lived here;nhonestly, not that different. \"HeynAnnie….can I ask you a question?\" \"Isn'tnthat what we've been doing all night?\" I laughed. It was weird,nwhat had been comfortable suddenly turned to awkward. He seemed to benstruggling to find the words, hesitant like he didn't want to ask. \"Lou,njust go ahead and ask, you wont hurt my feelings\", I said trying tonget him to talk. \"WellnI was just wondering, and don't feel like you have to answernbut…what happened to your mom?\" His eyes were searching my facentrying to see any signs of anger or warning for a mental breakdown.nHonestly, I wasn't expecting that question. I wasn't sure I knewnwhat to say. I trusted Louie and its not that I didn't want him tonknow, but I had just never really talked about it with anyone butndaddy before… \"Ohnwell, umm . . . \", I said trying to control my voice and find thenwords. \"Youndon't have to tell me if you don't want to, I was just curious\",nhe rushed. \"Ohnno its ok, I just never really talked about it with anyone before\",nhe seemed to relax, but I still needed to find the right wordsnwithout sounding too blunt. \"Well, she died, quite a while backnactually. When I was eleven…..she was shot.\" I told him searchingnhis face for any emotion. It was strange to actually vocalize thatnsentence. \"I'mnso sorry Annie, I shouldn't have asked\", Louie said. The comfortnI once felt vanished, leaving me struggling to try and find annexplanation. 'It wasn't his fault' or 'you didn't know'ndidn't really seem to fit here, those were things you say whenntrying to comfort someone who upset you but, I wasn't upset. Ifnanything, talking about my mom was always sort of . . . calming ornpeaceful. He told me when she first died that the pain would nevernfully go away, but over time it would dull and I would be able tonfind peace again. \"Nonits ok, I don't mind talking about her…it actually helps\" Inreplied with a smile after seeing him relax. \" We had just moved tonArizona and she was coming to pick me up from school. She was over annhour late when I finally decided to call Daddy to come get me.\" Inpaused and shot a quick glance over at Louie before continuing. n\"When we got home there were police waiting at our front door,ntelling us that there had been a shooting and we had to get to thenhospital right away. By the time we got there, it was too late. Thenpolice couldn't tell us if she had been hit by a stray bullet or ifnthey were aiming for her, but when we saw the men they arrested wenknew she had been the target. That was the first time I evernexperienced a hate crime.\" I finished looking over at Louie. \"I'mnso sorry, I can't imagine having to go through that.\" \"It'snok. At first I didn't really understand what had happened, and whennI finally did I was really angry. After a while though it all numbednand I was able to think about her again without any of thosenfeelings.\" \"nWhat was she like?\" Henasked with a returning curiosity. \"Shenwas absolutely amazing. Mom was the one who encouraged dad to takenthe promotion the Navy had offered him\", I said with a smile. \"Shenwas one of the most open minded people I knew… she always told menthat if I didn't like the way society was acting then I should joinnthe Navy because they have their own society with their own rules\"nI laughed. It was memories like those that kept it from hurtingnwhenever I thought of her. \"Shensure sounds like a smart lady\", Louie said as he laughed along withnme. \"Ohnshe was, she was beautiful too…..you wanna see a picture?\" Hennodded so I went back inside to find my favorite picture of the threenof us. I found it on daddy's desk and went back outside and handednit to Louie. \"Wow,nyou three look really happy . . . I never knew that she was, well . .n.\" He was trying to find words that wouldn't upset me. It wasnactually kind of amusing, but I figured it was time to throw the boyna life jacket. \"Thatnshe was black?\" He looked up trying to see if I was angry. \" It'snok, not many people know . . . most just think that I have a reallyngood tan\" I laughed. The race card was one that made a lot ofnpeople jumpy around here. I remembered something that Momma used tonsay about race 'It brings out the ugly in some people and thenstupid in others'. After our little heart to heart session, thencomfort level drastically improved and we were back to talking aboutneverything and anything. Wensat there for another hour talking about everything to the newntemptation song he heard on the radio to the reaction of the boys onnthe football team. While that wasn't my favorite topic, it didnbring up some questions; like why did those names sound so familiar?nThat question had crossed my mind a lot for about a week now, I don'tnknow why it kept popping up; mostly because I don't even remembernthe names. Maybe they lived around the naval base? Maybe Louie wouldnknow . . . \"HeynLouie, at the football signup, did any of the guys seem familiar tonyou?\" I asked. \"nWell now that I think aboutnit, that one guy . . . uh GERRY! Yeah Gerry Bertier sounded familiar.nI think him and his buddies were at the school when I went to getnregistered. I believe he used to be the captain at T.C …why,nfootball captain catch your eye already?\" he teased. Even if I wasninterested in one of the football players, it would NOT be GerrynBertier. At the signups he was the leader of the idiots; granted it'snnot totally his fault because he was raised that way, but I couldn'tnfall for someone that set against integration. \"HahanNo. Besides, even if he wasn't an arrogant jerk; I don't reallynthink I'm his type\" I laughed, besides I saw him too; quite closento a girl who I safely assumed was his girlfriend. Let me tell you,nif that's any clue to what footballers girlfriends are like then Indefinitely don't fit the profile. I'm not a cheerleader; I in nonway have the coordination or balance to do so. \"Whatnare you talking about? Once the guys stop being arrogant jerks, I'mngonna have to work double time to make sure none of them get toonfriendly\" he said with a wink. That's why I love Louie, he'snwilling to play big brother for me. Although he didn't really havena choice with me continuosly pestering him. \"Yeahnwell never fear, I don't think I'll be falling that easily. Thenwhole 'new girl in town falling for the football star' scenarionis a tad bit too cliché for me . . . besides, I wasn't talkingnabout Bertier. No one else seemed familiar?\" I asked, attempting tonget back on track. Whoever these people were, they had alreadynstarted to bug me and I don't even know if I met them yet! \"No…nonone's coming to memory, sorry…why?\" \"nA couple of the guys namesnsounded familiar is all, but I cant place a face or remember thennames…just the feeling\", I replied. Oh well, it'll come to meneventually…maybe after Louie makes 'friends' with these people. Asnthe night dwindled down, the Lastiks went home so they could get upnearly enough to see Louie off. Louie had asked if I was gonna comenwith them in the morning to see him off. I wasn't so sure I wantednto, but after the last encounter with the so called team who couldnblame me . . . plus 7 was really early and I like to sleep. \"nWhy don't you come withnus Annie? We would love for you to be there and we can take you ifnyour father has to be at the base in the morning\", Mrs. Lastik toldnme. I was right on my first judgment, she was one of the sweetestnladies I have ever met; and she made really good cookies. \"Ifnyou want to go it's fine with me. Just make sure that you come homenafterwards and don't forget your key.\" Daddy told me with ansmile. I was wondering how long it would take for him to startninsisting I stay home after Louie left, leaving me with no one tonchaperone on my visits to town. With our final goodbyes andnarrangements for when to be ready in the morning, the Lastiks leftnleaving just me and Daddy. \"nLouis seems real excitednabout camp doesn't he?\" Daddy said turning his attention back tonme. Ever since Daddy found out that Louie was into football andntrying to teach me the spark in his eye got brighter; he had beenntrying to teach me for years with no avail. \"Yeah,nhe said that as long as he has to be in school he might as well hitnsome people\", I laughed. Louie could always make me laugh, althoughnhe doubted himself way to much. \"Inthink more than anything he's excited about what's gonna happennwith the team…he thinksnthe new coach is what this town needs to bring the boys together\",nI had to admire his optimism. Coach Boone did seem like a guy whonwould run a tough camp so maybe he did have what it takes. \"Well,ngod knows it wont be an easy task…he's gonna meet a lot ofnresistance from a lot of arrogant people.\" Daddy replied with a sadnsmile. It really was depressing. Sure he didn't seem like the mostnhappy-go-lucky guy around, but I don't think anybody would want hisnjob at this point. He has to turn a group of hot headed teenagersninto a team in just two weeks with the entire town and school boardnbreathing down his neck. Let's just hope he has as much faith innhimself as Louie does . . . Inremember staying up that entire night thinking about coach Boone andnthe team as well as trying to figure out why those boys seemednfamiliar . . . was I ever shocked when I finally figured it out. Atnthat point I still had my doubts about the town, but the boys on thenfootball team were thought of as gods around there, and if theynmanaged to get together then the town would surly follow. Who knewnthat after two weeks the boys would end up forming friendships thatnhave lasted almost twenty years. . . ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- AN:nStay tuned for our next chapter when we send our favorite boys off toncamp, as well as getting more clues about our mystery familiarities.nDrop a review and tell me what you think!

Disclaimer:nThe saddest part of the story….I own nothing…..sigh ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- NewnYork, New York 1989 Thenday we sent Louis off to camp was the one day I will truly nevernforget. It started out early with me really tired, and ended with menin tears as people who I thought I would never see again reentered mynlife . . . talk about a busy day. I remember waking up that morningnwith a strong feeling that something important would happen, not justnto the boys but to me as well; boy was I right. The Lastiks picked menup that morning since daddy had to be on base; of all the days fornhim to work, today was probably the worst. We had arrived at thenschool bright and early to see our newest titan off. It was a normalnenough day, as a matter of fact nothing really happened until all thenboys were loading the bus only after Boone made all of them get off; nI still find that funny. It was when the parents were starting tonleave and the last of the boys were getting on when I received thenbiggest shock since we had moved back to Alexandria . . . \"Alrightnguys, I gotta go but I promise to call.\" Louie said as he grabbednhis bag to leave, giving one last hug to his mother and a handshakento his dad. \"Thatnbetter include me too! I need you to be my informant incase anythingninteresting happens; god knows nothing good goes on here.\" Ininformed him as he rounded to give me another quick hug. \"Don'tnworry I'll make sure to keep you up to date\", he said with anlaugh. So with one more goodbye we sent Louie off to where the coachnwas having the players load the bus. ThenLastiks and I stood there; seeing as how no one else was leaving, tonwait until the buses left. It was pretty crazy here, and I thoughtnprotesters were bad but this turned out to be much worse. You couldnclearly see that although the state began to integrate the peoplenstill chose to segregate themselves. The tension felt was enough tonmake a grown man cringe, two sides completely separate. All of thenblack families stood on one side and all the white families on thenother, most of them just staring each other down…just like in thengym at football signups; apparently this is where they learned it. Inlooked around trying to find the players in the crowd. They were allnscattered, saying goodbye to families and even some of them had theirngirlfriends there; which I thought was completely stupid. It's onlyntwo weeks…I'm sure you can cool your hormones enough and managento survive without them for fourteen days. The players were allnboarding the buses, whites on one and blacks on the other . . .nstupid people. I wondered if they really thought they were going tonstay that way. Mynattention was drawn back to the two black coaches and it looked likenBoone was gonna have some company when I saw Bertier and one of hisnbuddies going up to him…this had disaster written all over it. Instood there watching as Bertier and his friend walked up to coach andnstarted having what looked like a pretty intense conversation. I wasntoo far away to hear the whole thing, but god I would have loved tonbecause the next thing Boone did was funny as hell. \"Ladiesnand gentlemen, I got an announcement to make. We got Jerry Lewis andnDean Martin going to camp with us here this year. Jerry tells thenjokes, Dean sings the songs and gets the girl. Let's give them anround of applause.\" Boone said clapping as he wiped that smug looknright off of Gerry's face. The crowds reaction, complete silence.nMy reaction however was a tad bit different. It literally took everynfiber of my being to not bust out laughing and I had to bit my lip innorder to hid the grin that was trying to work its way to the surface.nNow, did I think that public humiliation should be that bad; no…butnthey without a doubt had it coming to them. They went back into theirnprivate conversation mode before the two boys huffed off to jump onnthe bus, although they didn't stay there too long. and that'snwhere everything started to get real interesting. Anyndoubt I had about the ability of Coach Boone to control these boysnvanished after I heard his plan for camp. He teamed up each playernwith one of a different race and sent them to a bus depending onnwhether they played for offense or defense; apparently the people whonhe paired you up with would end up being your roommate too. A lot ofnthe parents did not look happy about this, but the players lookednabsolutely furious. I on the other hand thought that this was anbrilliant plan; force them together whether they like it or not…itnjust might work. Everyonenwas loading up the buses and a lot of the parents had begun to leavenwhen one of the players in particular caught my eye. He was gettingnon the bus after Bertier; not looking very happy about being pairednwith him, and for some reason he looked really familiar and not justnfrom football signup. He turned around to give a quick wave tonsomeone in the crowd but when he was moving to get back on the bus henseemed to falter when he caught my eye. I tried to remember where Inhad seen him before…the face looked so familiar. I had heard himntalking to some of his friends before everyone got here and at thatnpoint I was pretty sure he was one of the mystery voices I heard innthe gym; I wish I could remember his name. He turned to get on thenbus only after shooting another questioning look towards myndirection. Not that I blame him, after all I was staring. I made anmental note to ask Louie what his name was when he called me andnturned around to catch up to the Lastiks, but what I saw almost madenmy heart stop. Innthe midst of parents trying to get to the parking lot I caught anglimpse of a women who could have only be one person. My breathncaught in my throat as I searched the crowd trying to find where thenwoman had gone to. She had flawless mocha skin, long dark hair pullednup in a bun, and the piercing green eyes…the same as my mother. Thenonly other person I had seen with those same attributes was hernsister, my Aunt Hazel. My aunt, uncle, and cousin all lived innAlexandria at the same time we did and once we started moving wentried to keep in contact the best we could. My mom and her sister hadnalways been close, and Daddy and Uncle Charles got along really wellnso it wasn't a big surprise that me and my cousin were practicallynraised together. He was six months older than I was so he alwaysntreated me more like a baby sister than the annoying cousin that Inwas. I would always follow him around and wanted to play with him andnhis friends; but he would always let me and stood up for me. I wasndevastated when we moved. I had lost the big brother I always wanted;nthat's why I got so attached to Louie, I missed that connectionnthat I used to have. The last time I ever saw them was at Mommas'nfuneral and that was nearly six years ago. After that we began tonmove more often so other than the traditional Christmas card ornoccasional letter we never heard from them. The last letter we gotnwas from four months ago and they said they were moving and wenhaven't heard from them since. Daddy was hoping that they wouldnsend another letter to let us know where they were but we left thennaval base in New York before it came. I thought that was the lastntime I would ever hear from them again. Nownstanding in that parking lot, I swear I saw the woman who was so muchnlike a second mother to me. It was only a quick glimpse but that wasnenough, I was sure she was here. \"Annienhoney are you alright?\" Mrs. Lastik was looking at me with concernnwritten all over her face (of course I had just been staring at annempty space for three minutes). \"Y-Yeah,nI'm ok…I'm just not feeling to well all of a sudden.\" Inreplied. Mrs. Lastik sent a sympathetic smile towards me and usherednme to the car. When we got back to the naval base the first thing Inwanted to do was talk to daddy, but when I called Lt. Carter told menhe was in a meeting that would probably last a few hours. I reallynneeded someone to talk to, so I went to the next best person. Ingrabbed my key and made my way across the lawn, trying to figure outnhow to start or explain what I was doing over there. As luck wouldnhave it, the gods decided to throw me a bone that day and Mrs. Lastiknwas already on the porch and invited me to sit with her so I wouldn'tnhave to go through my awkward explanation of why I was alreadyninvading their house even when Louie wasn't there. \"Sondear what's on your mind, back at the school you looked as thoughnyou had seen a ghost\" Mrs. Lastik asked with a knowing smile, it'snone of the things I miss about having a mother, how they always knownsomething's wrong with you. So I sat there and bared my soul tonher, telling everything from what my family was like when I wasnlittle, to moving around the country, to seeing momma's family atnher funeral, the letters, and then seeing the woman who I swear wasnAuntie Hazel at the school. We sat there in silence for a minutenafter I had finished my story, trying to figure out what the nextnstep was. \"Wellndear, if you want my opinion I think it would do you and your daddy anlot of good to try and find them, after all you're a family and I'mnsure they would like a chance to see their niece.\" I sat therencontemplating what she said. I really did miss them all like crazy,nbut after momma died it seemed as though we lost the connection wenonce had. \"Wellnwhat if they don't wanna see me, I can't just randomly show up onntheir doorstep\" I said looking over at her. \"If you think about,nmy mom was the connection between our two families, what if now thatnshe's gone they don't want anything to do with us anymore?\" Itnwas times like this that I really missed my mom, she always knew whatnto do. \"Annie,nsweetheart think about it. They lost your mother too, but you are onenlast piece of her that they can hold on to, plus I can't think of ansingle reason why they wouldn't want to see you\". Sittingnthere on that porch with Mrs. Lastik all of these old feelings that Inthought I had buried long ago began coming up again and it took all Inhad to fight back the tears threatening to spill. I honestly can'tnremember the last time I had cried over my mother. When I was littlenI would always cry, especially on the anniversary of her death but asnthe years passed it all numbed and I couldn't really cry anymore.nNow sitting here on that porch, me an almost 17 year old girl wasnturned back into the little eleven year old I was when I first heardnthat mom wasn't coming home. I felt the first tears start to spillnand I tried to wipe them away before anyone could see but it was toonlate and before I knew it Mrs. Lastik had me wrapped in anhug…….mothers intuition I guess. That was another thing I missednabout my mom; no matter what, if I came home with tears she wouldndrop everything and just sit there with me and let me cry until I wasndone then me and her would rant about how boys suck or how teenagengirls can be so bitchy with bowls of strawberry ice cream. It wasntimes like this when the pain would be worse, when I knew that shenwouldn't be there to make my bad days better. Daddy had always beennthere and had done the best that he could, but nothing could take anmothers place. Inleft the Lastiks about an hour later to go on home and wait fornDaddy. At this point I figured that I would never really know whatnthe right thing to do would be, so I might as well do what I felt Inneeded to do. The first thing I did when I got home was look throughnthat old shoebox in Daddy's office where he kept everything thatnwas important to him. I sat there for a good three or so hoursnlooking over everything; notes from Mom to Dad back when they werendating, letters sent home when Dad was away on a tour of duty, asnwell as the old Christmas cards and mail we had gotten from AuntienHazel. Daddy finally got home that night around five so me and himnsat and talked about everything that had gone on that day; just thenexplanation took at least an hour. \"Inreally do want to see them daddy, I really miss them\" \"nI know you do, to be honestnI miss them too….your mother would have beaten me with a treenbranch by now if she knew how distant we have all become\", henlaughed. It was true too, momma was always family oriented; shendefiantly would not have stood for us not talking for months, letnalone not seeing each other in six years. \"nIt never occurred to menthat when they said they were moving they meant closer to the newnschool, not out of state…tomorrow I'll look up the their oldnaddress and see if I can find where they are now\", he replied. Inreally don't think I have ever felt that excited in years, I wasnfinally gonna see my cousin again! We stayed there talking for a fewnmore minutes before the phone rang so I jumped up to get it hoping itnwas Louie. \"Louienthat had better be you, because I have had the weirdest day and haventhe biggest story to tell you\" I rushed out. I seriously hoped itnwas him because otherwise I probably just scared the hell out of onenof daddy's marine buddies. When I recognized the laugh on the othernend I was pretty sure it was him. \" wellnhello to you to, but if you think you could do a recap there'snstill a couple guys who have to use the phone\" Indived right into the story trying to talk as fast as I could butnstill managing to get out all the important details ending with how Incompletely broke down in front of his mother. I also remembered thatnI still had to ask him about the mystery guy and that would probablyntake a minute. I finished my entire story in record time and waitednto hear his response. \" It'snstarting to scare me that I can actually understand you when you talknthat fast\" Notnthe response I was expected. \"Louiencome on this is serious\" I whined. I have been doing that a lotnlately, I don't see how he deals with it, even I'm gettingnannoyed. \" alright,nalright I'm sorry…to be honest I'm not too sure what to say…Inleave you there for less than ten hours and you already have gottennyourself into a soap opera\" \"Haha,nvery funny…before you go I have a quick question. Do you know thenguy who was getting on the bus after Bertier; I think there roomingntogether…what's his name?\" \" Julius….yeahnhim and Bertier have not been getting along very well, they alreadynhad a fight…why?\" If my hand didn't have a death grip on the counter, I swear Inwould have fallen over. The fight didn't really surprise me, Infigured that would happen…the name however. I had only known onenboy in Alexandria with the name Julius; granted it could be ancoincidence I had to be sure. \"UhhhhnLouie..w-whats his last name?\" \" Campbell,nJulius Campbell…….why do you know him?\" I swear I almost dropped the phone. Thinking back it all fit, why henhad seemed familiar, why I saw Aunt Hazel at the school, I just can'tnbelieve after all this time he was there the whole time. \"uhhhnyou could defiantly say that…He's my cousin…\" Whonknew that after six years of not seeing my family we would all end upnin the same place and not know it. Turns out football did a lot morenfor me than I gave it credit for… --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- AN:nBetcha ya'll weren't expecting that twist!

We had hung up only after I made him swear not to tell anything to Julius. I remember thinking two things going to bed that night. One, that after six years I was going to see my family again; Two, that it would end up making a very interesting year. Over the following days, Daddy had been trying to find the Campbell's new phone number while I had been trying to get more information out of Louie. He told me all about camp and how the boys were reacting, turns out he ate lunch with Julius and a few other boys. He always told me he felt like he was lying to Julius by not telling him about me, but agreed on the fact that until everything cooled down it was for the best. I kinda felt bad at first that I had a secret informant to tell me everything about the boys when my own cousin didn't even know I was back, but until I talked to Auntie Hazel I didn't want to jump the gun. It was only a few days later when I got my wish…… I was up in my room reading when I heard daddy come in the door yelling for me, \"Hey Annie? Honey your gonna want to here this!\" I went downstairs to see daddy in the kitchen with a big smile on his face holding a piece of paper. \"Hey daddy what's up\" \" I think I finally found the number to the Campbell's and seeing how it's still not too late I was going to give them a call…..do you want to talk to them?\" I don't think the smile on my face could have gotten any bigger. I nodded a quick yes, considering he had already dialed and was waiting for someone to pick up. I figured that if we set a plan to meet tonight with them then I could give the go ahead to Louie to talk to Julius for me. Someone had finally picked up and once they heard that it was daddy the screech on the other end of the phone was so loud it could only be Auntie Hazel. The whole situation would have been a lot more rewarding if I could have heard both sides of the conversation, but from what I heard from daddy's end they were excited to hear from us at least. Dad talked to Auntie Hazel for a while explaining that we were back in Alexandria and how after I saw her at the school we thought we would track them down. They talked for a few more minutes until I finally got a chance to talk with her. \"Yes Hazel, Leanna's doing real good; she's sitting right here if you want to talk to her\", daddy laughed as he handed the phone to me muttering something about 'same old Hazel'. \"Hey Auntie Hazel how have you been?\" I asked once I had gotten the phone. \" Leanna honey it has been too long since we last talked, Julius and your Uncle will be kicking themselves after I tell them they missed your call\" I couldn't keep the smile off of my face, any awkwardness there might have been disappeared. \"It's good to hear from you Auntie Hazel, I heard that Julius was in football camp\" \" that boy loves football as much as his daddy, Charles was so excited when the new coach moved here that he took Julius down with a couple other people to introduce him……but how did you know about football camp?\" I told her how I went down to the school with the Lastiks and seeing the boy who looked familiar, only to find out it was Julius when Louie called me. It was amazing how easy talking to her was after all these years….it was kinda like talking to my mom. We sat there for a few more minutes until dad started bugging me about giving back the phone. \"Hey Auntie Hazel, daddy wants to talk to you again\" \" Alright Honey, you make sure to come and see us some time this week. I can't wait to tell Julius that your back in town, he's gonna be so excited.\" \" I can't wait till he gets back from camp, I've missed you all a lot.\" \" We've been missing you too honey, me and your daddy will plan out something so we can get together soon.\" With another goodbye I handed the phone back to daddy. I sat and listened for a few more minutes to them chat before daddy made plans for us to go see them the following night. I was so excited about seeing them again, though it wouldn't be the same without Julius. I sat downstairs a while with daddy until the phone rang, signaling that Louie had more news for me from camp. Louie told me all about the three-a-day schedule that the new coach had them on, apparently a form of motivation for them to get to know each other. He explained how the three daily practices wouldn't stop until everyone at camp talked to all the members of the opposite race to get to know one another better. He thought it was a great idea, but a majority of the other players put it off as long as possible; mainly Bertier and Julius. Even though all of the drama at camp kept most of the players separate, Louie had managed to make a few friends. It didn't really surprise me too much, Louie was a guy that you just had to like. I had told him how I had talked to Auntie Hazel, giving him the go ahead to tell Julius. With a promise to call me tomorrow night to tell me how it went and a quick goodbye we hung up after hearing a bunch of yelling in the background to get off the phone. I went up to bed shortly after, thinking about what Julius was doing and hoping that he would eventually get along with the guys……. (Meanwhile at camp, Julius pov.) I just gotten in bed but was too wound up to sleep, so I just laid there thinking of these last couple of days. This wasn't anything like I was expecting, it wasn't what anyone was expecting. I had gotten stuck rooming with the almighty captain and ever since Boone assigned us the job of meeting all the teammates we had been avoiding one another like the plague. Of all the guys to be stuck with I had to get Bertier. To make matters worse, these damned three-a-days Boone had us on was killing us. This camp was supposed to help us with football but all we had been doing was fighting each other. No matter how much the coach made us practice we still sucked. The only good thing to come out of this was the call I had just gotten from Ma, which had managed to piss me off all the same. My baby cousin had finally come home and when I should be there with her I was stuck here. I hadn't seen Annie since Aunt Grace's funeral six years ago, and while we tried to keep in touch it hadn't worked as well as we hoped. The girl was more like a sister to me than anything, hell I taught her how to swim and fight. I was missing her like crazy and being here defiantly wasn't helping. By the time the \"captain\" got to the room I had managed to relax enough to pretend I was asleep, I was not in the mood to do any stupid interview tonight. Besides, it'll be a cold day in hell when he'll actually know me, I don't know what Boone thinks is gonna happen from this….. The next day's practice was the worst we have since we got there. We ran the exact same play and still ain't got it right. No one played worth a damn, especially Bertier's white buddies. They hadn't blocked for Rev or anyone all week, everyone looked out for themselves; so why shouldn't I. Bertier had cornered me before I had got to the locker rooms, apparently we were the last ones that had to talk. \" All right, man, listen. I'm Gerry, you're Julius. Let's get some particulars and just get this over with, all right?\" The boy was seriously getting on my last nerve. \"No matter what I tell you, you ain't never gonna know nothing about me and what I got to say, you really don't want to hear 'cause honesty ain't too high on your people's priority list.\" and from there it just got worse. He was standing there tryin' to pin it on me, that I should bust my back for his ass when nobody plays. He's the damned captain and when I see him doing his job, then I'll do mine. By the time dinner had come around I calmed myself down and went to go sit at my usual table. It wasn't too long before Petey, Blue, Rev, and Louie made there way over. Petey and Blue started talking about something or other with Rev while Lou looked a little anxious. Lastik was a confusing guy, I really didn't see why he wanted to eat with us and have most of the white boys hate him; he wasn't that bad but I just didn't get him. \"Hey Julius, you know that one girl I was telling you about?\" he asked. I knew the girl, he talked about her a lot the first couple of days…his neighbor or something. Petey kept on messin' with him, asking if it was his girl but the boy kept on denying it. \"Yeah, what about her?\" I swear if the boy asks me about dating advice I might loose it. Lastik was a decent guy and all but after the day I had I really didn't give a hoot about his girl problems. \"Well I was talking to her last night and I think you might know her, she mentioned you anyway\" \"Uh-hu ok, what was her name then?\" I seriously doubted I knew her. In this town, white and black have never mixed so I doubt there's a significant white girl to drag up from my past. \"Leanna O'Connell\" My head shot up as I dropped my fork, I was not expecting that. I shot a quick look to Petey and Rev to see if they had caught it and they looked as shocked as I was, after all the four of us grew up together. For the first time since we got here I was truly speechless. Hard to believe that this white boy was the key to finding my cousin again. Petey was the first one to break the silence, \"Leanna's your neighbor? As in Julius's cousin with the scary marine dad Leanna?\". I didn't know if Lastik new that we were family but from the look on his face I would say he did. \"Yeah, apparently she saw your mom at the school when we left and put the pieces together. She said she thought you looked familiar from the signup but it wasn't until we got to camp when she realized it was you\" he replied turning his attention back to me. This time it was Rev who broke the silence, \"Wait, that girl who was with you at the signup and when we left…..that was Leanna?!\" I remembered the quite girl in the bleachers at football signup when Lastik came busting in being the same girl who I recognized when I was getting on the bus. All this time she had been so close, no wonder she looked a lot like Aunt Grace. Blue had started to ask about her at this point and Petey and Rev were filling him in while I just stared at Louie; it was all I could do at this point. It was one thing to hear from my mom that she was back but then to find out that she was the same girl Lastik had been going on about all week was beyond strange. The whole situation was a little too much like a soap opera for my tastes. \"Ever since she talked to your mom she's been really excited to see you….if you want to talk to her I can give you her number\" Louie said snapping me out of my thoughts. Even with all of this craziness going on in here it amazed me how much Louie was willing to help. Maybe the boy wasn't so bad after all. Back in Alexandria, Annie's pov. It wasn't until eleven that night that I finally got in bed, I don't think I have had that much fun in one night since Louie left. Me and Daddy had gotten back from the Campbell's about an hour ago, we had been there since about four that afternoon, after all we had six years to make up for. As soon as we got there I was bombarded by Auntie Hazel and Uncle Charles. After giving me a once over Aunt Hazel deemed that I was a spitting image of my mother, leading me in the house with Uncle Charles and daddy following close behind, talking about something or other. We sat around for hours talking about what we had been up to for the past years, but mostly about our time together in Alexandria. We talked about everything, even momma; and how all of us kids grew up together. We were going through some old pictures and Auntie Hazel kept going on about how much I looked like mom. A lot of people told me I looked just like her. I had the same wavy brown hair, bright hazel eyes, and little nose that momma had, along with her curse of being horribly short. I was barely 5'3 and daddy had always teased me about being such a little thing, not weighing nothing, just like momma. Me and Aunt Hazel looked through some more photos, laughing at some and smiling at the memories they brought us. We came to one picture that was taken when I was about seven, at this point daddy and Uncle Charles turned their conversation from football to see what we were doing. \"I remember that picture. You kids were so happy and nearly inseparable\" said uncle Charles said looking at the picture I had. It was a picture of me and Julius with two neighborhood boys sitting against the tree in the backyard. \" Remember those two boys Annie? At first we thought they hung around here so much cause Julius always had a pretty girl with him but after all these years we still cant get rid of them!\" he and daddy laughed. I smiled at the picture in my hand, yes I remembered the boys. I don't think I could have forgotten Petey and Jerry even if I had tried. Petey was always following me around and we would pretend to get married with Jerry being the preacher when we were five. I missed them a lot when we first moved, after all I grew up around them as much as I had Julius. All of our mother's were friends so we were kinda forced to get along. I was looking at those pictures when I remembered the two boys from the signup that I thought seemed familiar. \"OH MY GOSH, JERRY HARRIS AND PETEY JONES!\" I yelled out. Everyone turned to look at me laughing at my outburst. I felt my face flush as I rushed to explain that I thought two boys from the football signups sounded familiar but I couldn't remember till now what they're names were. How ironic was it that just by going to the signup that I hadn't wanted to go to, I ended up finding my cousin along with two of my best friends from when I was a kid? We sat there for a few more hours sharing some stories from back when lived there. I was nearly on the floor with tears streaming down my face due to me laughing so hard. It seemed that the more stories we told, more of them were dragged up from deeper in our past; many that would make Julius kill me if I were ever to repeat them. Auntie Hazel was telling us about the time that she walked in on Julius and Petey playing dress up with me, and I could barley breathe by the end of it. I really needed to remember that one incase I needed blackmail. \" I cant remember why they were doing it in the first place\" Auntie Hazel gasped out between laughing fits. \"Wasn't it because they upset you or something?\" she asked turning to me. I had to take a few deep breathes before I could explain. \"Yea, Julius pushed me down and then Petey called me an annoying pest so I ran home crying and they ended up feeling bad about it. They tried to apologize but I just ignored them, so they said they would do whatever I wanted to make it up to me. I decided that in order for me to forgive them they would have to play dress up with me.\" I giggled at the memory of Petey trying to walk in my moms heels. Julius and Petey were five and I was four, so when mom and Aunt Hazel found us it wasn't such a big deal, but it was still good to get a laugh out of. The night wore on and before any of us knew it, it was already ten and time for us to go home. We left the Campbell's with a lot of hugs and promises to get back together once Julius got home next week. When I got to bed I crashed with memories of our childhood and curiosity of what Julius was doing. Over the next few days I was more excited than ever to have Louie back home, now that I would have him, Julius, Petey, and Jerry all to look forward to. Louie kept joking with me whenever he called, saying that I had drug him into one of those really bad drama novels I was so fond of. He told me how much things had changed at camp and that I would be proud of how the boys were acting toward one another. The boys had really changed from the ones I saw at signup. After they all took a run to where they fought at Gettysburg something in them changed. Apparently during the following practice, Bertier called out one of his buddies for not blocking for Jerry, or Rev as everyone calls him now. After he chewed the guy out some he actually blocked and they finally got the play right. What really surprised me was that apparently Julius and Bertier were now friends. Not even a week ago he was telling me how they hated each other, but after they got the play right they did some weird call and response hitting each other thing and got over themselves. I will truly never understand men, they are the only creatures on earth who hit each other in order to make friends; but at least they're all getting along. They even had a new guy who signed up with them who they called sunshine. Louie told me that he had some stories to tell me about him once he finally got home and was sure that Bertier wouldn't kill him for telling. The boys were getting along better than expected ever since Julius and Bertier had become friends. I guess that after the two leaders broke down, it would only be a matter of time before everyone else followed. He told me all about Petey and Rev too. He really seemed to get along with Rev in particular which again, didn't surprise me at all. Rev always was a great guy to talk to. On more than one occasion if Petey saw Louie was on the phone with me he would start yelling random things to me in the background; he was always such a dork. The rest of the week past by in a blur and before I knew it, the night before the boys were coming home was here. I made plans to go down to the school with the Lastik's again and then meet up with my Aunt and Uncle down there. Granted, a school full of potentially racist parents probably wasn't the choice location for my happy reunion, but I really didn't care at that point. I fell asleep that night more content than I had been in quite a while. Back at Camp, Julius's pov. These last two weeks were absolutely crazy and I was more than ready to go home. I definitely did not think that this camp would end up pulling this team together, but more than that I never thought I would make friends with these people, especially Gerry. Ever since Gettysburg this camp has changed, I've changed. Bertier and I talked a lot this last week and surprisingly enough we got close, Annie would be real proud. I had told Bertier about Annie a few days ago, I really wanted her to meet him and the team; she would get along great with a lot of the guys. \"Hey Julius…man are you with me?\" I looked up to see Gerry standing in front of me. I guess he had been trying to get my attention for a few minutes. \"sorry man, what did you say?\" \"I was just asking where your head was, you've been out of it all day. Guess your real excited to see Annie again huh?\" I laughed as I took down my poster to get it packed away. Amazing that two weeks ago we were fighting over this but now we had him listening to the music. \"Yeah, hard to believe that its been six years since the last time I saw her. It seems kinda weird to be obsessing over it, but you'll get it when you meet her. The girl can steal your heart with just a look.\" I laughed to think of how many times Petey had followed her around when we were kids trying to get her to kiss him. Even during the summers, little boys would always try to get her to notice them and I would have to step up to play the big brother role. I'm sure I'm gonna have my hands full trying to keep her out of trouble once school starts. Annie was beautiful but she had a sharp tongue to match and it got her in trouble quite often. It was going to be an interesting year. Back in Alexandria, Annie's pov. I woke up this morning and was ready to go before seven this morning, truly a feat in itself for me. Daddy was laughing as I rushed around trying to find my shoes before the Lastik's got here. Over these last few weeks I had been around there a lot talking to Mrs. Natalie, so they offered to take me to the school with them. \"Honey relax, your starting to make me nervous\" he said, taking the coffee pot away from me. \"do you really think you need caffeine this morning?\" \" What are you talking about, I'm perfectly fine…\" I said trying to get back my cup that he stole. Anyway, any morning that starts without coffee will turn into a very bad day and a very unhappy Leanna. Before long the Lastik's where leaving, so with a quick goodbye to daddy I bolted out the door and to their car. By the time we got to the school my Aunt and Uncle were there waiting for me. I said goodbye to the Lastiks promising to come see them before they left and ran over to were Auntie Hazel was standing, ignoring the whispers and stares I was receiving as I hugged my aunt and uncle. \"How have you been Honey? Excited about the boys coming home?\" Auntie Hazel asked. I nodded yes as she started ushering me over to the women she was talking with before. \"Annie dear I want you to say hi to some people, they were your mommas friends\" she told me as I was brought over to two women with smiles on there face. \" Why Hazel you were right, she looks just like her momma. It's been so long since I last saw you, you probably don't remember me.\" The first woman said giving me a once over with a smile. \" It's me, Jerry's momma.\". She looked the same as she did ten years ago, beautiful as ever. \" Of course I remember you Mrs. Harris, its wonderful to see you again; you too Mrs. Jones.\" I smiled as I hugged both women who I had known so well such a long time ago. Mrs. Jones was the next to speak \" Hard to imagine that the beautiful woman standing here used to be the little girl following our boys around, isn't it Hazel?\" shooting a motherly smile towards me. I could barely keep the blush off of my face, all this attention was weird for me. We stood there for a few more minutes before I was saved by the buses with singing pouring through the windows. A few of the parents were acting as vile as ever, but at that point it didn't matter to me anymore. The buses parked and the first couple of boys headed off the bus. Not really recognizing any of them I stood to the side until I saw Louie get off the bus. I ran over to give him a hug once he was clear of the crowd. \" Hey Annie, I was wondering if you were gonna come\" he laughed as he caught me in a hug. \"Well of course, after all one of my favorite titans is coming home; I had to be here.\" \"Hey I thought I was your only favorite titan\" he teased with a nudge. \"I've got a few more people on this team that I have to support, so your gonna have to share me now, it'll be difficult I know.\" I said with a smirk. In reality I'll probably follow him around still, but now he can pawn me off to someone else when he gets sick of me. \"Oh yeah, as you can tell I'm completely devastated.\" He said with a playful shove. I missed Louie a lot these past two weeks, I had absolutely no one to mess around with. \" Now if I'm not mistaken, there's a certain guy who has been waiting all week to see you. As a matter of fact he just got off the bus and is already looking for you.\" I turned around to see Julius climb off the bus and start to look around after he grabbed his bag. After giving one last hug to Louie I fought my way back through the crowd to my family where Julius was hugging his mom with his back turned to me. I stood a few feet away, Uncle Charles was the first to notice and motioned for Julius to turn around. We stood there for a few seconds just staring at each other before one of us gathered up the courage to do something, turns out I was first. \"Hey Julius……\" ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- AN: My first somewhat cliffhanger, this is so exciting!

As annadded bonus, we are introduce to another oc character! Disclaimer:nAgain, I own absolutely nothing and probably never will ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- NewnYork, New York 1989 Inthink the whole town was shocked the day the boys came home. The mainnhope among the parents had been for the boys not to kill each other,nbut no one had expected them to actually become friends. When thosenbuses pulled into the parking lot, it was like a switch on the boysnhad flipped. They left in silence and literally came home singing.nLouie and daddy had been right, camp was just what they needed tonpull together and I was ecstatic that they were home. I had managednto catch Louie before the crowds got to thick and after a quickn'welcome home', he had pushed me back towards the buses. I wasnfinally going to see Julius, and while the initial hello wasn't thenbest, it picked up pretty quick after that . . . (Alexandria,n1971) \"HeynJulius…\" I definitely wouldn't be winning any academy awardsnwith that introduction, but it was the best I could do. We stoodnthere for a few more seconds until Julius broke out in a smile thatnconsumed his whole face and started to laugh. \"nAfter six years all I getnis a 'hey Julius'? Get over here\" he laughed and opened hisnarms for a hug. I ran the last few feet and threw my arms around himnas he spun me around. A lot of people were shooting us some prettynnasty looks while others started to whisper, they probably weren'tnhappy that Julius was touching me because I technically looked whitenbut I didn't care; that's a battle for another day. \"nGirl your still as small asnever\", he laughed as he put me back down. It wasn't until nownthat I realized just how much Julius had grown. He stood quite a bitntaller than me with my head barely coming to his chin. \"It'snnot my fault, it's genetic! Besides you're a football player,nyou're supposed to be big\", not the best argument in the worldnbut it was all I had. He laughed as he threw an arm around mynshoulders, turning back to Auntie Hazel and Uncle Charles. \"nHard to believe it's beennso long Huh?\" I asked looking up at him. \"It'snbeen too long. We've missed you guys; I've missed you\" henreplied. It doesn't seem like a lot, but it was all I was going tonget; Julius was never one for mushy reunions. Wenstood there for a few minutes waiting for Auntie Hazel to finish hernconversation with a lady she knew and Julius went off to say goodbyento a few guys before they headed home. I wanted to make sure I saidngoodbye to Louie and his family before they left and I had managed tonspot them near the edge of the crowd talking to another family. \"HeynUncle Charles I'll be right back, I'm gonna say goodbye to thenLastiks real quick\" \"AlrightnHoney, we'll meet up with you in a few minutes\" he replied,nturning back to his conversation with one of the dads. Once I caughtnup to the Lastiks, Louie dragged me over to a guy he was talking tonfor a quick introduction. \"Annienthis is Sunshine, he's one of our quarterbacks\", Louie saidnbringing me over to a skinny boy with blond hair almost to hisnshoulders. \"nSunshine huh? Nice to meetnyou\" I replied accepting the outstretch hand he offered. He had annice face with soft eyes but a bit too much of a baby face for mynpersonal taste. \"Mynreal name's Ronnie, I just moved here from California; hence thensunshine.\" He laughed. \" So you're the famous Annie. Julius andnLouie have been going on about you for a few days now, glad tonfinally be able to put a face to the name. Well, it looks like myndad's ready to go but it was nice meeting you, see you at schoolnLou\" he said clapping Louie on the shoulder and heading over to anman in the parking lot. \"Sonyou've been talking me up huh?\" I asking, nudging Lou as we madenour way over to his parents. \"Morenlike warning everyone\" he laughed giving his own nudge back. \" Sonwhat do you think of sunshine?\" I looked over at him and he wasntrying very hard to either not laugh or look at me. \"nWhat? Trying to set me up?\"nI asked once we got back to his parents. \"I'll have you know I amnperfectly capable of finding someone for myself, and I told you Indon't want a football player.\" \"nI didn't mean in that way! Just your general opinion.\" He asked with an innocent look. Itnwas then that I remembered the story that he had to tell me aboutnhim. \"Why?nDoes that have anything to do with a certain incident you promised tontell me about\" I asked shooting him a sly smile. He smiled andntried to find the right words, fumbling slightly. \"Yeahnwell he, uh. . . kind of . . . kissed Bertier\". I stood there andnjust stared at him for a minute before I burst out laughing. \"REALLY!?nOh my that is absolutely hilarious\" I managed to gasp out. God Inwish I could've been there to see what happened; that was by farnthe best thing I've heard all week. I can just imagine big badnBertiers face when pretty boy laid one on him. I would have paid tonsee that. \"Gladnto know your enjoying it, Bertier on the other hand; it took a fewnguys to keep him from beating Sunshine into the ground.\" He repliednas I finally managed to reign it in long enough for the people tonstop staring at me. Not that I could blame them, I had been laughingnso hard I had to hold on to Louie to keep myself standing. \"Wait,nwas he joking or being serious?\" I asked Louie. Not that it reallynmattered, but either way it was funny as hell. \"Wendon't know; a couple of the guys thinks he was kidding becausenGerry called him a fruitcake, but a few others have there doubts.nWhat do you think?\" Amazing how just because I'm a girl peoplenautomatically think I know these things, Hell I only met the guy fornlike two minutes. \"WellnLou I really don't know the guy, but I don't think so. He wasnprobably just trying to embarrass Bertier; he had it coming to himnanyway.\" I replied with a quick laugh. ThenLastiks had to leave shortly after, so I made my way over to where mynfamily was still standing. After Auntie Hazel had finally finishednher conversation, Julius and I were ushered out to the car while Inhad been attempting to look around, trying to see anyone else I mightnknow. I spotted Mrs. Jones across the parking lot, giving a wave oncenshe caught my eye only to stop once I saw who was with her. The boynhad grown up a lot in the past few years; a miracle in itself, butnthere was no doubt as to who it was . . . Petey Jones. Julius lookednover to where I was staring and merely smiled as he grabbed my handnto drag me the rest of the way to the car. \"nI take it you know who thatnis\" He laughed as we got in the backseat. \" don't worry, you'llnsee them soon enough\". Onnthe ride home, the conversation mainly revolved around the footballnstrategy that the coach was planning on using…needless to say Indidn't understand any of it. Football seemed cool and all, but itsnone of those sports that looses some of its charm if you don't getnit. By the time we pulled up to the house I had effectively managednto tune out their discussion over veers and runs, only to be pullednback to reality by Julius's voice. \"Hey,nyou gonna stay for a while right Annie?\" he asked while grabbingnhis bag out of the back. \"nWell of course, you justngot home. What you think I'm gonna ditch?\" I laughed as he rollednhis eyes and threw an arm over my shoulders, leading me to the house. Aboutnan hour later me, Julius, and Uncle Charles were in the backyardnmessing around with the football; or in other words playing keep awaynfrom Julius. I had just managed to actually catch the ball and getnpast Uncle Charles when Ju caught me and threw me over his shoulder. \"JULIUS!nYou put her down before you drop her!\" Auntie Hazel hollered comingnout the back door. \"Inwont drop her ma, she don't weigh nothing anyway!\" He yelledntotally ignoring me screaming for him to put me down. I really shouldnbe used to it by now, after all I practically grew up with nothingnbut boys. Getting thrown around like a rag doll usually comes withnthe territory. \"nIt don't matter! Nownya'll have some guests so put her down and come on in\" She wasnwalking back in the house when I noticed the woman with her out onnthe back porch. After he finally put me down we headed into the housento find out who was here. \"nWow Mr. Popularity, notneven an hour home and you already have people waiting to see you\" \"Inhave a pretty good feeling that they ain't here to see me\" hensaid throwing a smile my way. We made our way into the house, racingneach other to the living room and skidding to a halt once I finallynsaw the people who had been waiting. I stood there, rooted to thenspot as memories of when we were kids came back to me. It had been anlong time but they haven't changed at all. Standing in the livingnroom with mirrored faces of shock were two of my best friends, Peteynand Brenda Jones. Brenda was Peteys twin sister and the complete andnpolar opposite from him. Where Petey had always been loud, exuberant,nslightly obnoxious and annoying; Brenda was the shy, quiet,nsweetheart who had been the only other girl on the block. We alwaysnstuck together, defending each other from the wrath of the boys; wenwere best friends. . . We were sisters. Afternanother moment of silence me and Brenda both broke out into smiles;nscreaming and jumping around as we hugged each other. Auntie Hazelnand Mrs. Jones just laughed as we continued to jump around withnexcited yells, stopping every few seconds to look at each other onlynto start back up again a second later. Even after all these years,nshe still looked the same as ever; Skinny as can be with straightnbrown hair and the pretty oval face with brown almond eyes lookingnout from black framed glasses. \"nI can't believe yournback! I missed you so much; at first I didn't believe Petey when henfirst said you were here, it's been so long!\" Brenda rushed outnafter we had stopped jumping. \"nI know, it's been way toonlong. Oh my god I can't believe it's you! I've missed yountoo!\" I replied giving her another hug. I can't believe that it'snbeen nine years since we moved away from Alexandria, but in the twonmonths I've been back I got my best friends and my family again.nAfter letting go of Brenda, I turned my attention over to Petey. \"PeteynJones, it has been a while\" I told him with a smile and hands on mynhips. \" What, big bad football player isn't allowed to hug mennow?\" \"nGirl, you know I'm justnwaiting for my into. Get over here.\" He laughed as he caught me inna hug, lifting me off my feet. \" I was wondering how long it wouldntake for you to notice I was here, I almost thought you forgot me forna second there\" He joked as he put me back on the ground. \"OhnPetey, I don't think anyone could forget that you're in a room,\"nI joked back looking up at him. \" when did you all get so big; Infeel so short now\". It was true, Petey and Julius used to be pluckynlittle boys with no muscles; now the tower over me and actually looknlike football players. \"nNo offence Annie, but younare short\" Julius teased, moving from his spot against the wall tonthe now vacant couch. Normally I would have had a decent comeback,nbut I was unusually off my game today; so I settled for pushing himnoff the couch and stealing his spot. \"nAmazing it's been sixnyears since we've all been together huh?\" Asked Brenda, grabbing nthe spot next to me leaving the boys the floor. \" Remember when wenused to set up forts in the backyard when we were kids?\" \"Ohnmy god yes! Or the two tree houses that Uncle Charles and your dadnbuilt for us?\" I replied with a laugh. We had crazy summers when wenwere younger. We used to build forts in the bushes for our secretnhideouts, but when the boys told us that the men where building themna tree house we had wanted one of our own too. \"nI can't believe theynactually agreed to build both of them for us, but we did have fun\",nPetey added, sitting against the coffee table across from us. \"nYeah, well they wouldn'tnof had to if you guys would have agreed to let us use yours, but itnwas for boys only. Ya'll were mean to us as kids\" I replied,nlightly smacking Julius on the back of the head from his seat innfront of me. \"nWhat you hitting me for?nPetey was the mean one, I stood up for you two\" \"nNo, Jerry stood up for us,nyou on the other hand encouraged Petey. . . Plus your closer\" Inreplied, blocking the pillow that he was trying to hit me with. Itnwasn't too much longer until Auntie Hazel came back in to vacate usnfrom the living room, sending us out to the back. The boys hadnstarted a game of catch with the football, so Brenda and I went tonsit by the old oak tree not far from their spot. Amazing how theynjust got back from an extensive football camp, and they still weren'tntired of it. \"nI can't believe that yournactually back! It was torture the first few months without you.nEveryone really missed you.\" She said as we watched the boys fromnour spot against the tree. \"nI missed you guys too. Itnwas absolute hell without you all! The first place we moved wasnhorrible; thank God we were only there for a year.\" \"Didn'tnyou move by your dads family first?\" \"nYeah, you can imagine hownwell that went. The second they heard we were coming, they decidednthat my welcome gift would be to enroll me in this prestigiousnprivate school that a bunch of their friends grandchildren went to; Inhated it.\" I told Brenda as she hugged me with a sympathetic smile,nshe knew all about my family from when we were kids. Daddy hadnmarried Momma against their will when he was nineteen, and althoughnDaddy always had been pro-civil rights; his family disagreed. Theynhad always hated the fact that their son married a black women.nAlthough in their society I was viewed as a half-breed, it seemed tonbe their goal in life to turn me into what they had always wantednDaddy to be. Every time we would visit them, I was swept into a worldnof money and ball gowns. The fact that my mother wanted nothing to donwith their world and hated that they forced me into it only fannednthe flame; it was all a game of spite to my grandparents. I hatednevery minute of it. \"Atnleast your home now. As an added bonus, at this school you don'tnhave to go through the awkward new girl stage considering everyone'snmore concerned about the integration.\" Brenda always could make menfeel better. She was right though; I highly doubt anyone is going tonnotice me with everything else to worry about. Talk about your smallnblessings; if there's anything I hate more than moving, it'snbeing the new girl. I looked up to notice that Julius and Petey hadnabandoned their game, going over to greet some other guy who showednup. Once Brenda saw what I was looking at she pulled me to my feetnand started to lead me over to where the guys were standing. \"nCome on, you have to seenone more person\", she said pulling me along to where the boys werenstanding. Julius was the first to spot us; grabbing me from Brendanand pushing me in front of him to greet the newest arrival. It onlyntook a few seconds to figure out who he was. \"nJerry Harris, long time nonsee!\" I smiled as I stepped up to give him a hug. Amazing how manynhugs I willingly gave out that day; I guess reunions bring out thenbest in me. \"nIt's so good to see younAnnie . . .or do you go by Leanna now?\" he teased giving me anplayful nudge once I let go. \"nHa No! It has and alwaysnwill be Annie. I've heard that you on the other hand apparently gonby rev now. Not sure that I completely understand but ok.\" Inreplied, stepping over to Julius's side. \"nYeah, it's a long story,nbut Petey first started it and it just kinda stuck\", he laughed. \"nWell it fits, boy spendsnmore time in church than he does his own home\", Petey repliednstepping over to throw an arm behind my back. \" So we just gonnanstand here or we gonna start up a game again? With the girls here wencould hash out something of resemblance.\" \"nHa! That's funny! Havenfun with your game, if you need me I'll be over there.\" I laughednand started to walk away with Brenda running up to my side,napparently she shared my sentiments. I can barely catch the stupidnball and they really expected me to willingly play? We hadn't evenngot off the porch when Julius and Petey ran up behind us and threw usnover their shoulders with Jerry following behind. I heard Brendanscream when Julius pretended to drop her, leaving me to handle Petey. \"nJONES! You put me down! Ifnyou drop me, I'm gonna kill you!\" I yelled out, gasping when hendropped me into Julius's waiting arms. You would think that teenagenboys would find different ways to entertain themselves than watch usnsquirm. \" You know, one of these days you actually going to dropnone of us, then your gonna feel bad; and we'll laugh.\" I repliednas I was finally put down. \"nSo, let me get thisnstraight. Your gonna laugh, even though you're the one on thenground in pain?\" Petey laughed, holding the football that Brendanwas trying to get out of her reach. \"nUm. . . Yes?\" It soundedna lot better in my head but like I said, I was off my game today; soninstead I pushed him and stole their football. The rest of thenafternoon was spent in a similar fashion. We told stories from whennwe were kids and would end up teasing each other. Then if we didn'tnhave a decent comeback, we would steal something from them and runnaway. I swear, half the time we acted more like we were seven rathernthan seventeen. The afternoon wore on, and before long I had to benheading home. So with many goodbyes and promises to call along with anfew more hugs from Brenda, Uncle Charles drove me home. I couldn'tnhave been back longer than ten minutes when I heard the phone ringnand Daddy yelling upstairs, saying it was Louie. I ran to the kitchennand sat at the counter talking to Louie, telling him everything fromnmy day. \"nSo that was my big excitingnadventure, but enough about me. . .the real and honest answer now,nhow was camp?\" I asked \" Well, the camp part wasnreally hard but I think we have a good team. Plus I met a lot ofnpeople that I have a feeling you would really like. The coaches werenpretty cool, and despite your earlier belief I think you'd getnalong with Boone and Yoast.\" \"nOh come on Louie! I'venbeen waiting two weeks for this, you gotta give me something here!\"nI whined into the phone. The fact that he made friends and all wasngreat, but there had to be something other than Bertiers kiss thatnraised some excitement. \" Anything else happen? More fights? nPeople you don't like? I've been in relative solitude for whatnfeels like forever, I need some excitement.\" \" Alright, Jeez you thinknyou would've had more than enough drama after the week you'venjust had!\" Henlaughed, I could almost see him shaking his head at the phone. \"nYes well, I'm a girlnwhich entitles me to as much drama as I'd like. Plus once schoolnstarts I'm pretty much not going to be able to avoid it, so I mightnas well here some interesting stuff while I can.\" \" Well your definitelynright there, but I really don't know what else to tell you. Thatnone coach Tyrell, he seems like a jerk; but other than that the restnof the players seem cool. The ones who don't can at least tolerateneach other from what I can see, they just need more time and I'mnsure they'll get along.\" Louienalways had so much optimism, I really don't see how he did it. Wenhung up a while later, and seeing how Daddy was in his study I wentnback up to my room. Insat in the window in my room that night before bed, thinking andnlooking at the stars. I had been doing that a lot more recently sincenwe moved back here; I guess because I could always see them sonclearly. That's one thing that this town has going for it, anbeautiful night sky. The stars had a calming presence to them here,nalmost a sense of serenity. I found it hard to believe that in thisntown that latched on to all it's anger and hatred of other peoplenthat anything could ever feel serene, but every night for the pastnweek those stars gave me a sense of clarity and calming that Inhaven't felt in a while. Maybe it was because I finally came home,nhad friends, and found my family; but whatever it was, it felt nice.nI went to bed that night, hoping against all odds that even thoughnthis town was so wrapped up in its ways, maybe it could get better. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- AN:nalright people! Thank you for reading my latest chapter! Sorry itntook so long for it to come out, but this last chapter seriously gavenme hell. It will not take this long for my next chapter and should benout by the end of the weekend. REVIEWS ARE WONDERFUL! Peacenout Ya'll![Chapter 7] AN:nHello all you beautiful people in the world! I am completely sorrynfor the unannounced and unintentional hiatus but thanks to all of thensuper wonderful reviews I got on the last chapter, I have startednwriting again. I even went back and re-edited all of my othernchapters so now it makes a lot more sense and you get a lot more ofnher life story, so GO READ THEM! Now we get to the interesting stuff,nFIRST DAY OF SCHOOL!! Disclaimer:nI own nothing, how depressing…(including any book titles that maynseem familiar) NewnYork, New York 1989 Thensummer of 71 was the most complicated summer I have ever had tonendure, but I got more out of it than I ever imagined I could've.nThe last week before school started, I spent all my time splitnbetween getting school supplies with Brenda, catching up with mynboys, and having my nightly chats with Louie. As the last remainingndays of summer dwindled down, the tension in the town grew. Peoplenwere protesting everywhere, at times it got so bad we thought theynwould cancel the first couple days of school. It was a crazy time,nand the adults weren't the only ones who felt the tension . . . Alexandria,nVirginia 1971 Ournlast day of freedom had arrived and I was currently over at Julius's,nattempting to enjoy our last night before all hell broke loose. Whatnhad originally started as just me and him soon included Petey,nBrenda, and Jerry as the night wore on. The news was on in the nextnroom and we had been trying to ignore the broadcasts talking aboutnthe chaos going on in the streets all afternoon. Apparently somenhigher power decided we weren't going to get out of it that easily,nevery station on the radio and the television had some report aboutnprotesters and rallies; add to that phone calls from Lou telling usnabout the happenings at base where he was helping his dad and you gotna twenty four seven information hotline in Ju's living room. We hadnlapsed into silence for the fifth time that hour and heard thenscreaming and yelling from the radio in Uncle Charles's study whennwe decided to move outside to attempt to block out what we wouldneventually be apart of. Oncenwe were in the relative quite of the backyard we went to our spotnunder the tree but couldn't keep the subject out of thought as wenall lapsed into silence once again. As much as we had tried tonunderstand the situation, we really had no idea what was going on. Wendidn't know how bad it was going to be, what was going to happen,nor how bad it would have to get. \"nSo how bad do ya'llnthinks its gonna be tomorrow?\" Petey asked. I was wondering whonwould finally break the silence and ask the question. I looked aroundnto everyone, all snapped out of the thoughts and trying to find annanswer that would fit. \"nFrom what we've heardntoday, a lot of people aren't happy. . . I don't think it'll gonaway overnight\" I replied. \"nI just hope that it doesn'tnget too out of hand. With that many angry people it can get badnquick, I heard that they were even thinking of canceling the firstncouple days of school.\" Brenda said from her spot against the tree.nI had heard the rumors too and I know a lot of parents were pushingnfor it, they all thought it would be safer that way. \"Theynwon't cancel, this is a chance to make a statement about how itsngonna be.\" Julius replied sitting up from his current spot where henwas laying on the ground. \"The only way they would cancel is ifnpeople end up getting hurt tomorrow, although that doesn't sound tonunrealistic right now\" I wish that I didn't have to agree withnhim but what he said was the truth. People had been getting realntense and more aggressive lately, I wouldn't be surprised if a fewnpeople got hurt and by then it would be to late to do anything. Itnwas a sad truth, but one we needed to come to grips with soonernrather than later. \"nEveryone is still new tonthe idea of integration, we just have to give it time and it willnstart to lessen up\" Rev said. He had been quiet for most of thenafternoon, I wanted to believe what he said, but even he didn'tnseem to have much faith in his words. Reality was that there wasn'tnenough time to give before something might happen. \"nWell whatever happens,nbetween the school and the bussing its gonna be a hard day for us.\"nIt might have seemed silly to worry about bus situations withneverything else going on, but how are we going to survive school ifnwe cant even survive the ride there? People had been beaten in othernstates for attempting what we were starting, I can't imagine thatnit will be any different. \"Wenjust have to take it one day at a time, eventually it will getnbetter. They'll run out of steam as long as they see that nothingnthey do can change what's gonna happen. We just have to have faith\"nreplied Rev for the second time. One thing I'll say for his logic,nhe will always win the argument. Once Rev starts giving his view andnbrings faith into the equation, any debate will be over and you willnhave lost. Badly. Wenhung out back for a while more until Brenda, Petey, and Rev all hadnto go home. We made plans to meet out in front of the school once wengot there so they could meet up with their friends and Brenda and Incould compare schedules. Honestly I think it was just because Juliusncould keep an eye on me that way, I could've met up with Brendananywhere and I have no need to meet their friends, but whatever. Inhad a feeling I would want to be around someone familiar tomorrow,nand if that person just happened to be a couple muscled footballnplayers then so be it. Instayed for a while longer and had dinner with Aunty Hazel, UnclenCharles, and Julius considering Daddy was working late. It seemednthat the tension of the town was starting to seep in everywhere.nUncle Charles who is usually loud and always telling stories wasnunusually solemn and quiet tonight where Aunty Hazel couldn't stopntalking in order to fill the silence. Every few minutes she wouldngive us some sort of advice or worry that we didn't have all ournsupplies we needed. By the time Julius drove me home she had checked,ndouble checked, and triple checked that I had everything and wasncompletely ready for school. \"Alright,nnow don't forget your books and make sure that you have a ride tonget home tomorrow, we don't want you takin' the bus tillneverything cools down. As soon as you get to the school go findnJulius so he knows your alright. By the way how are you gettin'nhome tomorrow?\" Aunty Hazel rushed out as she gave me one last hug. \"nDon't worry everythingnwill be fine, I have everything I need. Louie was gonna drive mentomorrow morning since Daddy has to work and I was gonna walk homenafter school, its not that far and to be honest I could walk tonschool if Daddy hadn't freaked out.\" I laughed as I started tonhead towards to door before she stopped me again. \"OhnI don't think so! You ain't gonna walk anywhere especially withnall these people getting hot under the collar, Julius why don't youndrive her home tomorrow after practice? Besides I'm sure Brenda'sngonna stay too, ya'll can do homework together.\" \"Yeah,nit won't be that bad and practice is only for like two hours, I'llnjust drive you home after\". After I agreed we finally got out ofnthe door and into the car so I could go home. I really didn't neednto be looked after this much, its only a twenty minute walk fromnschool to home, fifteen if I take the shortcut by the running trailnbut I have to admit it was sort of nice. Having people look out fornyou showed that you have someone who cares and its always nice to bencared about and looked after for a change. I mean, I'll always havendaddy, but it's been just me and him for so long, its kind of nicento have other people too. Julius dropped me off and made me promisento come find him in the morning, so with a quick goodbye and kiss onnthe cheek I left to go salvage what little was left of my night.nAlmost as soon as I walked in the door the phone started ringing,nsoon to find out it was Louie, that boy had the most amazing timing.nAfter agreeing to be ready by 7 we hung up. Let me tell you, schoolnstarts way to early for my tastes. Inheaded upstairs to read for a bit, I was already half way through ThenExorcist andnwas absolutely loving it when I wasn't terrified. Daddy picked itnup at the store for me and thought I would be interested in it, angreat book although not a great choice when alone. Needless to say Inwas left awake for quite a while, but that just gave me time tonthink. This town was nothing like I remembered it. I rememberednbackyard swings and trips to the park. Mom's apple pie and AuntynHazels cherry cobbler. Julius teaching me how to swim in the lake,nsleepovers with Brenda, Petey chasing us around, Rev trying to teachnme how to climb a tree. All of these memories were what I rememberednabout Alexandria. I felt at home in those memories, but now lookingnat what this town has become its foreign to me. It has turned darkernand colder, making me feel more out of my element than I ever havenbefore. I fell asleep that night watching the stars like I had everynnight for the past week, thinking about how much was different.nAlexandria has changed, I just hoped it could eventually change back… 6:00nA.M, First day of School Anloud ringing in my ear signaled that the deadly hour had finallynarrived and the headache inducing alarm clock that so cheerily wokenme up was unceremoniously smashed to the floor as I shot an arm outnfrom under my blanket to try and make it stop. I laid in bed for anfew more minutes hoping that I was in a bad dream and I didn't havento go to school today, but once I peeked out and saw on my clock onnthe floor that it was indeed six a.m paired with the red circlenaround today's date; I knew I couldn't win the argument againstnmyself. It was the first day of school, and the first official day ofnintegration; oh joy, the fun we'll have today. I hauled myself outnof bed and after picking up my alarm clock and sending a glare itsnway, I dragged myself to my closet to pick out something suitable tonwear. All of my summer clothes consisting of jeans, tee-shirts, andnsweatshirts had been put in boxes and replaced by school approvednskirts and blouses, even a few pairs of nice khaki pants that Inmanaged to pull off. I hate skirts. The only reason I'm evennagreeing to wear them is so I will manage to stick out less, the lastnthing I need is to be labeled the 'freaky new girl' who can onlynmanage to make friends with guys on the football team. No doubt mynlabel would then be changed to something along the 'whore'nvariety. I say again, oh the fun I'll have today. Afternchoosing a knee length navy blue skirt with a white blouse, I ran tonthe shower in an effort to actually be ready on time. After Inshowered, changed, and brushed out my hair, applying a little make upnalong the way, I shot a quick look in the mirror. My long brown hairnhung in waves around my shoulders and my green eyes were outlinednwith the most natural looking makeup I could find, blending in nicelynwith my naturally tanned skin color. It wasn't a horrible look, innfact it actually looked kind of nice; it just wasn't what im usednto, it wasn't me. I was able to wear jeans and pants in my othernschools without being weird. Even by my grandparents where they hadnuniforms, I could still have an option between a skirt or pants. ohnwell Inthought as I grabbed all my books and my bag, atnleast I can still wear my normal clothes on weekends and holidays. Withnthat I rushed down the stairs, shocked that I still had a wholenfifteen minutes before I had to leave, I totally could have slept annextra ten. I made my way over to the coffee pot, thrilled that it wasnalready made and still warm when I saw a note and an envelope undernmy designated coffee cup (it was the biggest one we had). After Inpoured myself some and added generous amounts of cream and sugar Insat on the counter to read what the note had to say, probably fromndad considering he was leaving when I was getting up. Annie, SorrynI cant be there this morning, I know how hard the first day of newnschools can be for you, especially this year. I know that Julius,nLouie, and the boys will take good care of you. Make sure that younget a ride home, I don't want you walking anywhere for the next fewndays, the town has been pretty fired up. I'll be home around 5ntonight, see you then. Good luck on your first day, and don'tnworry; everything will be fine. Love, Dad (P.S.nI left you a present in the envelope for strength) Inopened the envelope while smiling into my cup, daddy always left mensomething sweet on the first day of school, especially if he wasn'tngoing to be there and this years gift was no exception. I put down myncup and dumped out the context of the envelope, picking up thenpicture of me and my mom that fell out. I smiled down at it for anwhile, remembering when it was taken. It was the first day of 6thngrade and we had just moved to a new area. Mom grabbed the cameranlike she did every year to take my picture, but this time dad gotnthere first telling mom to get in the picture with me. She came overnand hugged me from behind and right before the flash went off, toldnme that everything would be fine, that they'd be crazy not to likenme at this new school. Paired with daddy's special pancakes, thatnwas the best first day I've ever had. I stuck the picture into thenside pocket of my bag and moved on to the other thing that daddy leftnme, his dog tags. I took a minute to look at the tags at the end ofnthe chain, remembering when I would used to sit on his lap when I wasnlittle and be so infatuated with them, memorizing everything that wasnetched on the thin metal plates. Noticing the clock on the wall, Input my empty cup in the sink and lifted the chain around my neck,nhiding the tags in my shirt before grabbing my bag and running outnthe door just as Louie was walking over. \"HeynAnn, ya ready for our first day of school?\" he asked as he gave mena quick hug before unlocking the car and climbing in. \"Ohnyeah, I'm thrilled. I don't know what I would do if I couldn'tntake math.\" I replied while buckling myself in, receiving a laughnfrom Louie. \"nCome on, it can't be thatnbad, and I know you absolutely hate skirts and stuff but if its anynconciliation you look very nice today.\" He smiled at me whilenbacking out of the drive. Louie was so sweet, even when having a badnday just a few words can cheer me up. \"It'snnot, but thank you none the less.\" I laughed. We kept driving andnthe closer we got to school the closer we got to the protesters, theynwere a big crowd. We started to slow down as the streets got thickernwith people and as we neared the entrance to the school, traffic wasnalmost a dead stop. People with signs were screaming and yelling,nbeating on cars and throwing stuff at buses and passing students. Thenpolice had formed sort of a blockade between the school and thenstreet, moving aside for cars then rushing back in place to stop thenflow of people. We had managed to make it to the parking lotnunscathed, trying to fight our way to the front of the school withoutngetting caught up in either side. Once we found a familiar face innthe crowd, we made our way over to Petey and Brenda. \"Whatnyou doing in my school boy?\" teased Louie, doing that one armed hugnthing that men are so found of. \"Heynman, pretty crazy huh? Oh by the way, this is my sis Brenda\" henreplied with a smile, pushing Brenda forward. While they shook handsnand started talking, Petey turned to me. \"Heynyou found your cousin yet? Julius was looking for you earlier, Inthink he was gettin a little worried.\" He said giving me a quicknhug. I scanned the crowd, trying to find him in the sea of people, Inthought it wouldn't be that hard considering how freaking tall thenguy got. \"NonI haven't seen him yet, we just got here\" I replied beforenspotting him in the crowd talking to another white boy. \"Oh nevernmind, I found him\". I started over towards where he was beforenLouie grabbed my arm. \"Heynhold on, I'll walk you over.\" he told me, looking around withndark eyes at all the people staring at us, a lot of them giving usnstrange or dirty looks. \"We'll see you guys later, Brenda it wasnnice meeting you.\" He said while I gave a little wave and a quickn'goodbye' to Brenda, starting into the crowd. They gave a wavenand a nod of the head, and headed off towards the front of the schoolnto talk to a few other people who looked familiar to the boys at thenfootball meeting. Louie and I walked past all the groups mingling onnthe front lawn, ignoring the protesters until we got into eyesight ofnJulius. He was talking to the white boy and another girl who hadnjoined them, until she stormed off right past us leaving him lookingnconfused and Julius looking down with a sad smirk on his face.nWalking up I heard the last part of their conversation. \"Looksnlike we ain't in camp anymore huh superman?\" The boy smiled atnJulius, then nodded his head, signaling Ju to turn around; not reallynsure if he was pointing me or Louie out. \"Annie,nthere you are. I've been lookin all over for you. Hey Lou how'snit going?\" He asked giving Louie a handshake, the other boy doingnthe same. \"nWell superman, this is myngirl I've been telling you about. Ann this is Gerry Bertier\" Henintroduced, grabbing my shoulders and pushing me forward. So this wasnthe infamous Gerry, looks like he changed quite a bit at camp. Hendidn't give off that 'I hate you' vibe anymore that made menwant to hit him. He gave a confused look towards me and Julius butnoffered his hand. After our handshake he still looked confused, notnquite sure why. \"nWow, I would have nevernguessed you two to be cousins.\" he finally said, all of the piecesnpopping into place in my mind. \"Why?nCan't you see the family resemblance?\" I teased leaning back intonJulius, giving my best innocent face watching his eyes widen and himnstart stuttering. \"Ohnno. . . I mean yes. . . I mean. . .\" He stuttered as Julius startednsnickering behind me and I broke down and smiled at him. \"Relax,nI'm just kidding. Surprisingly enough we do get that quite a lot.\"nI reassured watching his face go back to normal and Julius lightlynshoving me from behind whispering 'be nice' to me. So it might'venbeen a little mean, particularly today but I couldn't resist. Thenboys continued their conversation for a few more minutes, a few boysnwaving and shouting out greetings, sending a few awkward glances mynway. Not even fifteen minutes into school and I was already sick ofnit. I spotted Brenda standing near Petey over by the stair steps,nlooking just as bored as I was. \"Wellnit was nice meeting you Gerry, but I see someone I know. See you guysnlater\" I said as I tried to get away from the crowd the second timenthat morning, only to be stopped a second time by Julius's hand onnmy arm. \"Whoanhold up. Who do you know anyway?\" He asked, turning his head when Inpointed to the school steps and over towards Brenda and Petey who wasnnow joined by Rev. \" Got it, hold on a second and we'll go withnyou.\" he replied, receiving nods from both Gerry and Louie.nRemember what I said earlier about having people care about you? Wellnscratch that, it's actually quite annoying. I rolled my eyes andnsighed before replying. \"I'mna big girl Julius, I can make it to the school steps all by myself\"nI said as his eyes scanned the crowd. \" Don't worry, I can takencare of myself\" I finished, trying to drive my point home whilencatching his eye. When he finally did look at me, he moved his eyes nover my shoulder before giving his answer. \"I'dnfeel better if you just stayed by us for a while\" he replied, hisnvoice colder as I turned my head to see what he was looking at. Aboutnseven or so white boys was giving us the most hatred filled looknimaginable, one of them was even wringing his hands around a baseballnbat. I turned my head back towards the group and noticed that Louienand Gerry were both glaring back, so I relented and waited for Juliusnand the others. After another few minutes of conversation with randomnpeople I wasn't interested in, the first bell sounded and everyonenwas being herded to the doors. Once we made it to the doors I managednto catch Brenda before she got in the school to see what homeroom wenwere in. I thought it stupid that they sent out homeroom numbers innthe mail during the summer but not schedules, it would save a lot ofntime. As stupid of a system as it might have seemed at least I got anbreak in the fact that the rooms were randomly selected and notnalphabetized, turns out Brenda and I were in the same room at least.nSo we headed in the doors, my watchful cousin always a step behind usnalong with the few people he managed to meet up with along the way. \"OkaynI gotta get to homeroom; if you guys just take this hallway and thennthe first left the first class will be where you need to be, I'llnmeet you outside of you class before lunch.\" Julius said afternhanding me back my schedule. It was kind of cute that he was makingnsure that I knew where all my classes were, but I had been walkingnaround the school a week prior so I really didn't need the help. Indidn't need a bodyguard either, but he kept insisting and there wasnno argument with Julius once he made up his mind. With a quickngoodbye and promise to wait by my class I grabbed Brenda andnpractically dragged her down the hallway to get away from my cousinsnever watchful eyes. \"SonJulius has been pretty bad about this whole situation too huh?\"nlaughed Brenda after I released her arm once we rounded the corner.n\"I know the feeling, Petey has barely let me out of his sight sincenwe got here, to be honest I'm surprised he's not following me tonclass\" we both laughed and entered the classroom heading towardsnthe back. We were the only two in the class so far, even the teachernwasn't there. We sat in the two desks in the back row, talkingnabout how their mother had been so worried she almost kept them fromncoming to school. People started trickling in slowly, each personnshooting dirty looks or eye rolls to our corner when they saw usntalking together. People are so stupid sometimes. What really buggednme was when the teacher walked in. Most of the class was segregated,none color per side and those in the middle rows sat as far away fromneach other as they could, the teacher did nothing. If anything shentook one look at me and Brenda talking and shot me a glare thatncould've killed; I cant believe they let people like that teach.nThe final bell rang and the class got quite as the teacher stood upnfront and introduced herself, smiling at the whites and glaring atnthe blacks, and me in association. It was going to be a long day. . .n. AN:nYea! Extra long chapter for you lovelies. I hope you enjoyed it. Alsonbecause I have another three days of no school, you all will getnanother chapter within the next two days. Fun! Thank you for readingnand remember REVIEWS MAKE HAPPY PEOPLE!!! Peace,nLove, Rock out![Chapter 8] AN: Hello my lovelies! I was thrilled at how many people viewed my newest chapter even after I didn't update for like two months, you people rock my world. Because of the wonderful reviews I got I was inspired to finally finish this chapter. Anyway now on to what your all interested in, the story where we get to read about the first day of school, fun! Disclaimer: Again, I own absolutely nothing that seems remotely familiar. . . I just borrow and put my artistic license to use. Hooray for artistic licenses and borrowing! New York, New York 1989 That first day of school. God that was a miserable day for all of us. Between parents fighting outside and students fighting inside you couldn't escape anywhere. The worst part was no one would give anyone a chance. If you even smiled at someone of a different race there was always that one person present who would make it known, turning you into the most hated person in the room. God forbid if you were actually friends with someone or talked to them. I could tell it was going to be a long year . . . Alexandria, Virginia 1971 Brenda and I were sitting in the back of class, attempting and failing to ignore all of the stares and whispers we were receiving. I could tell she was uncomfortable with all the attention, she was getting really quite and kept her eyes down as more people came in. I kept my eye on the door, watching to see if anyone seemed familiar; to give me something to do more than anything. The silence was killing me. I kept my eyes on the door, sighing in relief and nudging Brenda once I finally noticed a few friendly faces. About a minute before the bell rang Rev and the guy Louie introduced as Sunshine walked in the door, noticing us in the back and grabbing the last two seats beside us. We only had time for a quick 'hey' before the teacher decided to make her presents known. \" Alright, settle down please. I'd like to get this all over as quickly and painlessly as possible.\" she barked as her eyes moved around the class, glaring at a majority of us. She didn't seem to want to be here as much as we did. \" I'm Mrs. Thorne and you all get the privilege of seeing my joyful self every morning\" she finished moving back to her desk to pick up an armful of papers. I take back what I said earlier, she didn't seem to just hate blacks, but everyone . Her name definitely fit her. She was a middle aged woman with her blonde hair in a tight bun and a tight lipped expression making her seem to not have a bottom lip at all; overall a very scary woman with a very harsh attitude. \" Here are all of your schedules and any information you may need about classes. Come on up when I call you and look over your schedules quietly. We only need to survive about ten more minutes so lets see if we can do it without getting on each others nerves.\" Once all the names were called out and everyone got their schedules and were back in their seats, an awkward silence fell over the class as the teacher sat behind her desk. Everyone was tense, and not because of the icy glare our teacher gave as she scanned the crowd. Nothing but heated looks were sent between the two sides of the class, no words spoken at all. Now normally I would have attacked Brenda and Rev, stealing their schedules to see what classes we had together; possibly even Ronnie's had I not seen any common classes, but because of the intensity of the room I thought it best to keep to myself. I sat staring down at my schedule, attempting to memorize the room numbers and trying to remember the quickest way to get there when an intricately folded piece of paper and a note showed up on my desk. I spent three minutes trying to get the first one open before looking up to see Brenda smiling and staring out of the corner of her eye. Of course it was hers, she is the only one who folds like that. I think she does it on purpose, she knows I cant get them undone and probably thinks its funny to watch me try. I finally managed to get it straightened out, the once crisp piece of paper now crinkled and torn in my pathetic attempts to open it, smiling to myself as I saw what was written on it. All of her room numbers and teachers were written down. . . she knows me all to well. After a quick comparison I noticed we had four classes together, including lunch and homeroom. I was really disappointed that we didn't have math together, I was definitely going to fail now. I moved on to the second note, realizing it must be Rev's because I didn't know anyone else in the class, and highly doubting Sunshine would willingly relinquish his stuff to a stranger. Opening the second, much less complicated note, Rev's schedule was written out in his elegant scripture type handwriting. Compared to my chicken scratch, it was perfect. Reading through his schedule I noticed that most of his classes were advanced, no surprise there, but at least we had Psychology class together with Brenda. Taking a closer look I noticed we had Math together too. Thank God! Maybe I won't fail after all. Overall pleased with the fact that I had at least one person in a few classes I started to relax a bit, packing away the notes and taking a quick glance up to the clock. Only two more minutes before homeroom ended and so far no one was in the nurses office or dead, overall an acceptable start considering how this morning was, although I doubted it would stay that way long. The bell rang and the class emptied before I even had my bag on my shoulder. Amazing, only ten minutes and my faith in the human race has plummeted to non-existence; today was definitely going to be an 'I hate people day'. Brenda, Rev, Sunshine and I all were the last to leave, and seeing no immediate hurry decided to figure out where to meet up later. \"Alright, well do you guys want to meet in front of the lunch room; we all have fifth right?\" Asked Brenda after taking a quick look at her schedule. \"Yeah what class do you two have before? we could meet you.\" Sunshine suggested, joining the conversation for the first time all morning. \" Thanks but our keepers already have that under control. I honestly surprised they're letting us walk to class by ourselves.\" I added with a smirk while Brenda laughed. \" You know that Julius and Petey are just looking out for you two, it's a rough first day and no one wants to see you get hurt.\" Rev replied with a smile before Sunshine spoke up again. \"Well I know you girls were looking forward to your walk to class in peace but if I'm not mistaken I think a few people are looking for you\" I looked over to where he was pointing and let out a groan. Julius, Petey, and Gerry all rounded the corner and headed over to where we were standing. I noticed Rev shooting me a look that screamed 'behave' before they all joined our mingled group in the hall. \" Hey guys how was homeroom?\" Petey asked throwing a hand around Brenda's shoulder before grabbing her class list. \"Well no one died, so I'd say that's a good sign\" I replied leaning against a locker and handing over my schedule to Julius's waiting hand with a sigh. It was going to be a long day, and to make matters worse now I had to go suffer through a Spanish class. I don't see why the school systems started that new graduation requirement where you need two years of a foreign language. We had the choice between French or Spanish and to be honest I would probably suck at both of them, but people have been telling me Spanish was easier to learn. \" I'd love to stay and chat but we have three minutes to get to class\" I said while struggling to reach my schedule Julius was holding above his head. \" Don't wanna give the Spanish teacher more of a reason to hate me\" I mumbled under my breathe after snatching back my class list and giving a quick wave to the group. I got to the right room number after taking two wrong hallways, running in the class a minute before the bell rang. I didn't have time to do an intricate observation like in my last class, but from what I saw while looking for a seat it was a common set up. Whites on one side and blacks on another, I always wondered where to sit in situations like this; but that problem had been taken care of for me as I headed to the only desk left in the front of the room. I sat down as the bell rang and the teacher began his introduction. \" Hello class, I'm Mr. Smith and welcome to Spanish\" He began while smiling at us and handing out thick packets of papers to all the rows. This class was drastically different from the last. Mr. Smith was a tall black man with a bright smile and an overall pleasant feel to him with a kind voice. Even if I would probably end up failing the class; I might actually enjoy the teacher. \" Now I'm not a big fan of 'icebreakers', I don't really think they do anything but make people feel uncomfortable, so I figured we'd jump right in. What I'm handing out is the vocabulary list for this semester\" Oh joy, vocabulary. I couldn't stand vocabulary in a regular English class, let alone a class where I don't understand what the teachers saying. \" Now I know it may seem a little daunting, but I just want you all to learn a column at a time. Next Friday we will have a quiz on the first column, that way you all have the weekend to start studying considering this year we started on a Thursday.\" After we got our Spanish books to help us with the vocab, we started to go over the packet, Mr. Smith explained the correct pronunciation for certain words. Before long the class was over and I had effectively zoned out for the last thirty minutes, at least I managed to catch the explanation for the homework which was just a one page worksheet; not too bad. I packed up my notebooks and papers and headed for the door, trying to look at my schedule while juggling my bag and books. Not the greatest idea I've ever had. Needless to say it wasn't long before I was on the ground with a bruise forming on my arm and another girl in front of me trying to pick up all of her books along with mine. \"Oh My Gosh! I am so sorry, I didn't see you\" she sped out, profusely apologizing while trying to gather scattered papers. \"it's fine. Don't worry about it. Actually I think it was my fault, after all I wasn't looking.\" I replied while trying to find my Spanish book. It appeared in front of me, and I saw the girl holding it out to me with a smile. I thanked her and picked up the rest of my stuff while standing and helping her up. \" Thank you, I'm Susan by the way\" She said while straightening out her dress. She was a pretty girl, looked to be about my age with pale skin and wavy black hair matching her dark eyes. She sounded like she had an accent as well, I think British. \" No Problem, I'm Leanna; but you can call me Annie\" I replied while shaking her hand. \"Hey wasn't I just in Spanish with you?\" I think she was the girl that sat a few seats behind me, but I wasn't really paying attention too well during that class. \"Umm, yeah I think you sat a few seats in front of me, so where are you heading next?\" She asked while I looked at my schedule to try and figure out where to go. \"Uhh History. . . Who plans these things? I'm fine with history class and all, but why does it have to be at nine in the morning?\" I asked while she laughed and shouldered her purse. \" Well I guess I gotta go find a random class; I don't even know where this area of the school is. I'll see you around\" I replied with while starting down the hallway and waving. I ran down the last two hallways nearly late again for my next class, skidding to a halt outside to double check I had the right room. I entered the class and froze once I saw our teacher leaning against his desk and observing the room; of all the history teachers in this school I had to get Coach Boone. I made my way to the back of the room, surprised to see Julius, Gerry, and Louie all there as well. Julius looked up and I gave a quick wave before settling into the seat in the front of the room I was closest to before the bell rang. As soon as it did, the fun began. \"Alright, I'm Coach Boone and I will be your history teacher for this hour. Don't bother getting too comfortable because your just going to have to move again.\" He said as he stood up from his desk with a sheet of paper in hand. \"I have already made a seating chart, it is random but there will be no switching or substitutions; go ahead and move once I call your name.\" He started calling off names and people hurried to their seats, some none to pleased about who they were sitting with. He got through the first rows and I started to pay attention so I wouldn't miss my name, at least maybe I can sit by Julius. \" Julius Campbell. . . Leanna O'Connell. . .\" Boone faltered somewhat, looking up from his list to shoot me and Julius a quick glance before going on to name more people from the list; not quite sure what his deal is. I made my way to the seat next to Julius, dropping by bag down while grabbing out a notebook and seeing Ju role his eyes. He always made fun of me for being a slight nerd, always told me I was the only one he knew who would actually take notes on the first day. Once we had all managed to get our seats I looked around the class while Boone made his way around handing out packets. Julius and I were in the second row along with another boy he was talking to this morning, I think they called him Blue. Gerry sat in front of me, turned around to join in the conversation along with Louie who sat directly behind Julius. Boone handed us all packets with a lot of questions along with assigning us the largest history book I have ever seen. The rest of the class was a basic first day fun down of class policies, homework standards, the first unit we will be studying, blah blah blah. I actually really do enjoy history, I find it completely fascinating; just not the first day. Boone continued on his lecture about supplies needed and a brief introduction of the class and some basic information on each section we will study and as hard as I tried to pay attention I still tuned out barely catching the last minute. \"Alright guys, the bells about to ring so for homework tonight I would like you all to read through the first section of chapter 3 and fill out the corresponding pages on the packet. We will start our notes on the colonial age tomorrow, have a nice night.\" he finished just as the bell rang. Everyone rushed out of the class, leaving the few stragglers behind include Julius and me. \"So Mr. Campbell, is this the infamous Annie you were going on about during camp?\" Coach Boone asked as Julius and I walked up to his desk. \" Yes sir, this is my cousin Annie. . . Ann you know our football coach\" Julius replied while I shouldered my bag and switched books around to accept the handshake our teacher offered. \"Pleasure to meet you Ms. O'Connell, Julius here was going on about you all week during football camp along with Jerry and Petey\" he said with a genuine smile. I have to admit I was a little taken aback. Scary, strict football coach was actually quite. . .nice; hmmm weird. \"Its nice to meet you too sir, I hate to rush off but I have to find my physics class and I have no idea where to go.\" After a quick explanation from Boone about where the general location of my class was, I left with three minutes before class to spare. Walking into the classroom I was surprised at the number of people in the class. There was maybe ten kids top and the bell was about to ring so I expected not many more would come in. Rev had told me to expect this when I told him of my plans to take advanced physics this year, he had been in the advanced placement track for years and had told me not many people continued to take the more tricky classes liked physics. I was a little worried at first, but at least he could help me if I fell too far behind. I noticed the girl that I had ran into, Susan I think her name was, in the front of the class so I took the seat available next to her, not noticing anyone else familiar in the class. \" Hey, looks like we have another class together\" she replied with a smile after noticing me sit next to her. Yep, definitely a British accent. \" So how have your classes been so far\" I asked. \" Not too bad, it's a little strange here though. . . I guess I'm not used to American schools yet\" \" I know what you mean, I'm new to this school too. Where are you from if you don't mind me asking\" \"My family just moved here from the UK, my father got a job promotion which ended up taking him over seas\" she explained. The teacher walked in and as soon as the bell rang we started class with the eleven kids who had decided to risk taking this class, not a comforting fact for the beginning of the year. We started off right away with notes, this class apparently didn't believe in the 'do nothing on the first day' rule that other teachers were fascinated with. It wasn't really anything too complicated so that wasn't a bad start, at least I wouldn't start the semester not understanding what we were talking about on the first day. Really it was kind of interesting, the teacher listened to our ideas and thoughts on theories instead of just running a lecture hall; I could end up liking this class if I figured out what everyone was talking about. The bell rang forty minutes later and for the first time today I didn't completely zone out or tune out anything. The fact that I didn't have any homework in that class tonight was an added little bonus. I left Susan after agreeing to meet up with her before Spanish class the next morning and started down the hall towards where I assumed the lunch room was when I saw Julius walking towards me. \" Hey Ann, how's your day going so far\" he asked while giving me a quick hug seeing as no one was around. Typical Julius, no signs of emotion unless no one is there to see them; I cant blame him though. You don't want to stir up the water anymore than necessary on a day like today and people obviously didn't understand or like our situation. \" Well, I cant complain too much I guess. . . I haven't had math yet, knocked down a girl in the hallway, somewhat understand the general concept in physics, and I've come to accept the fact that I'm probably going to fail Spanish so I'd say it was a fairly productive day\" I said while handing over the overtly large history book that Julius was offering to take. \" I don't know what your so worried about, they wouldn't have recommended you for the advanced math and physics classes unless you could handle them. I can't say much about Spanish though, I'll probably end up failing that too\" he replied giving me a smile. \" Well at least if we fail, we can fail together\" not the most comforting thought, but it worked for the moment. We entered the cafeteria and I wanted to walk back out. It was horrible in there. It was absolute silence and every table stared at another. Gerry beckoned Julius over to where he was waiting in the back of the room and I noticed some tables outside and out of view from the street. Maybe I could go out there and get some homework done, at least the protesters weren't around this area to bother us. Apparently the others had the same idea and already had two tables pushed together by the time we got out there. Julius led me over to the farthest table where Petey and Brenda where sitting and already arguing about something while Gerry sat down on his other side. Louie filled in the empty gap beside me followed by Rev who took the seat across. By the time the final bell rang, our two tables had been completely filled with what I assumed to be football players. Julius sat talking to a couple guys about one of the teachers they had until one of them I noticed me. \" Well considering that no one is going to introduce me to the pretty lady sitting beside you I guess I'll have to do it myself\" said a large black boy, the same one in our history class. \" You can call me Blue sweetheart\" he replied taking my hand while placing a kiss on my knuckle from across the table. I stifled the laugh that was trying to break out while Brenda hid behind her hand seeing the look Julius was giving him. \" Alright, I get it. Everyone this is my cousin Annie; Annie this is the football team\" he replied shooting Blue a warning look, forcing him to let go of my hand. \"Wow Julius, that was a fabulous introduction. You have such a way with words\" I said, sarcasm dripping from every word. He apparently didn't think it was as funny as Petey did, instead he stole my water bottle. \" well seeing as my adoring cousin is too busy stealing my stuff\" I replied while attempting to reach my water bottle he was holding out of my reach \" I guess I'll do it myself, Blue was it?\" I said sitting back down, failing miserably at trying to get my water back. We went through the table, Blue introducing me to a white skinny kid named Alan who sat across from sunshine who also joined our table, and Jerry Buck; a lean black guy with a buzz cut who I decided to call Buck since two Jerry's would be confusing. \" So Annie, how did you like your physics class?\" Rev asked me from across the table. \" Well, I kind of understand what's going on and I understand the concept of the notes so I'm guessing not that bad\" I replied with a smirk. \" Well that's a good start, don't worry you'll do fine. Once we get into the school year a bit more you get the hang of it in no time\", how he manages to be so freaking optimistic all the time was really starting to bother me. He was the only one I know who could keep their cool in a time like this when I'm getting pissed off just because I have to wake up at six in the morning for the next nine months. I turned my attention to Brenda who had given up trying to reason with Petey, and was throwing out her lunch. For twins they really argued a lot. She sat back down and handed me her granola bar she saved, I could never figure out why she hated granola bars so much. I looked around and noticed a person sitting against a tree a little ways off and after noticing it was Susan I thought I would bring Brenda over to say hi. \" Hey Bren, you wanna go meet someone\" I asked rolling my eyes at her astonished look she sent me. \" You actually met someone you don't hate today? Wow what an accomplishment\" she teased while I narrowed my eyes. Not wanting to sit by the guys anymore I stood up to go see Susan, grabbing Brenda's arm to make her come with me on my way past. \" Alright so who exactly am I meeting?\" she asked, looking at the girl against the tree we were heading towards. \"Her names Susan and she just moved here, she's in a few of my class and I thought it would be nice if we said hello so she wouldn't be alone on her first day\" I explained in a rush while we walked up to her. \"Hey Susan, this is my friend Brenda. Brenda this is Susan\" I greeted, as she looked up in surprise. \" Oh hey, I didn't know you had lunch now\" she said as she put her book down and stood up while straightening out her skirt and extending a hand \" Hi, its nice to meet you Brenda\". \" It's nice to meet you too. Annie said that you just moved here, I hope you like it in Virginia.\" she replied with a smile, taking the outstretched hand while sending a quick glance my way. At least we knew the new girl wasn't racist, a small blessing in a world of chaos. \" Well, it's a bit different than the UK. To be honest I wasn't sure what all the commotion was about until my dad explained about the integration\" she smiled as we all took a seat under the shade. \" I think its fantastic what's happening here, the UK had been integrated for a while when we moved there, so its pretty great to get a first hand experience at helping the movement along\" she finished with a smile. I think Petey would like her a lot, they both seem to be quite outspoken. \" Well I'm glad your into this stuff, but I've gotta warn you; not many other people see it that way\" replied Brenda with a small smile. It was depressing really, Brenda was always one of those optimistic people and seeing her all downtrodden like this just showed how bad of a situation we were in right now. \" It will get better with time, everything just needs to cool down a bit\" said Susan, returning the smile. At least in a day of chaos, I managed to make a new friend who got along with my best friend. We sat and talked about our classes for a few more moments, ranting about the fact that we were forced to take Spanish. Ha! At least I'm not the only one who hates it! I heard some yelling coming from behind us and looked up to see Petey about to face off with a white boy who looked like he was willing and capable of beating him into the ground. \"Oh no. . . Brenda go get your brother before he gets his ass kicked!\" I said standing up while pulling her with me, giving a quick wave back to Susan before running off. Brenda got there first and started to pull on Peteys arm, attempting to drag him back to the table while the white boys girlfriend did the same. Noticing Julius stand up and start to head over I ran past, stopping just short of my cousin. \" Julius, no. . . Stop!\" I said, standing in front of him and trying to block him from going over to Petey. \" If you start up anything, they will throw you out faster than you can blink\" I replied, putting my hands on his arms to try and push him back. Not that I didn't want to help him, but Brenda had already managed to pull him back and the white boy started to walk away, if Julius went over there it would just start things up again and I had no doubt that Julius would hurt the boy if need be. \" Julius she's right, sit down man. If we start something it can get out of hand really quick\" Rev said while grabbing his arm and pulled him back with the help of Gerry. By that time Petey and Brenda had made it back we had managed to get Julius calmed down enough to sit. The rest of our lunch break was spent in awkward silence until the bell rang, and I've never been happier to have to go to class. We cleared off of the little patio, sending half-hearted farewells to each other while making our way back into the school. After a quick talk with Julius about where to meet up with each other after the final bell, I ran ahead to catch up with Brenda and Rev while making our way to Psychology. If the second half of the day was going to proceed like the first, then I was either in store for a decent first day, or a date with an Advil bottle. . . AN: Alright so it's finally done! My next chapter will cover her second half of the day as well as football practice, Yay! I'm hoping to have it done by the time I go back to school, but who knows. I will try my best and thank you to all of you who have kept up with my story and remember, Reviews make very happy authors who then write faster! Peace out[Chapter 9] Hello everyone! It has been a long six months since I last updated and I would like to thank all of you who stuck with me. So without further ado, here is the new chapter and I promise I will start updating faster now that summer is finally here. Warning: The paragraphs in this one are a little long and the chapters a little short but I promise the next one is longer, it'll be up this weekend, I promise ; ) Disclaimer: I own nothing so don't sue…..all my money went to college anyway New York, New York 1989 If anything, that first day grew progressively worse as the hours past. The tension from that morning exploded the last few hours. Every period till the end of the day had a fight in one of the classes, and I could not wait for that day to end. Alexandria, Virginia 1971 I slumped against the locker next to Brenda outside our seventh period English class where we were told to wait. We had just left a surprisingly uneventful and empty psychology class. According to the teacher, Ms. Simmons, with all the new elective classes that the school opened the classics like psychology were forgotten, leaving anywhere between ten and fifteen people in a class. We had just left Rev and when we got to our English class; our teacher was standing outside telling us to line up so each student could get assigned a book before finding our seats. For an advanced class, the student turnout was surprisingly large for this subject. There were about twenty or so people lined up so far with another few minutes to go until the bell rang. We finally got to the front of the line and received a book before I examined the seating chart and realized that Brenda and I were not going to be able to sit together. With a look of despair, I left her in the front of the room to go to my seat in the back. Looking around, I noticed that I was directly in between a very muscular and very tall black boy and a very angry white boy who looked like he played football; both of whom looked very upset. Class finally started and our teacher, Mrs. Price; a meek woman who looked very skittish, began class by assigning us a partner to work on prompts with. After everyone moved to sit next to or somewhat near their partner the entire class got an eerie feel to it, like the calm before the storm. I was working with a very shy white girl named Sarah. We had just finished reading over the essay and began working on the multiple choice questions attached when a fight broke out directly behind us. The two boys I sat next to apparently were assigned together and not very happy about it. The desks around them were moved and the people who occupied them did too. Mrs. Price ran to the hall to get someone to help break it up, it was getting violent real quick. I was up and out of my seat just before the large black boy was thrown into it, but I wasn't quick enough to escape it completely. The white boy was making another go for him and unfortunately I got in the way, which resulted in him shoving me to the floor with a sneer; stupid bastard. When he hit me, I was sent flying towards the floor, but not before the side of my face collided against the desk. I laid there for a minute trying to get rid of the stars I was seeing before being pulled up by Brenda and ushered towards the hall. A few teachers from next door managed to get through and break up the fight, half dragging the two who started it to the dean's office. I caught the eye of the white boy who shoved me and sent him a glare that could kill. Our class was lingering in the hall and slowly started to make their way back in while I was leaning against the lockers trying to regain my focus get rid of the stinging. \" Annie, are you ok?\" asked a concerned Brenda. \" Oh my gosh, the side of your face is starting to bruise!\" she said while pushing back my hair to get a better look. I winced when she accidentally hit a tender spot on my cheek, pushing myself away from the locker as Mrs. Price came over to see what happened. \" Oh my, did that just happen dear?\" she frantically asked trying to inspect my head. \" Why don't you go to the nurse's office, maybe some ice will stop the bruising\" she said ushering me down the hall. I walked in to the office and with one look to the nurse she got me an ice pack and insisted that I lay down on one of the cots. \" What happened?\" she asked while wrapping up an ice pack in a paper towel and placing it on the side of my head. \"There was a fight in class, and I got in the crossfire\" I said while readjusting the ice to the spots that hurt. \" Is it really that bad?\" I asked looking at her hoping it wasn't. \"Well….Umm…Why don't you see for yourself\" she replied while handing me a small mirror. I sat up to examine my face, gasping at what it already looked like. My left temple was completely bruised and was sporting a nasty purple and blue color. It extended down and ended right under my left eye, I guess I hit the desk a lot harder than I thought I did. Brenda came in about five minutes later to bring me my bag while I was silently freaking out. \"Oh wow, that's a lot worse than before!\" she said while handing over my bag; great response huh? \" Oh my god, my father is going to freak when he sees this!\" I moaned, trying to think of ways that I could attempt to hide it. \"I would be more worried about what Julius is going to do if I were you\" she replied taking the mirror away from me. I hadn't thought about that, but she was right; he was going to explode! \"Oh no, what am I going to do! I can't let him see this or he'll blow up\" I said beginning to panic. \"Well, you still have a full period to figure out a way to make it less noticeable\" she replied with a small smile, hoping to get me to feel better. \" More like ten minutes class will be over soon and I have math with Rev and Louie next!\" I said after glancing at the clock. \" Maybe they won't notice?\" she said, receiving a look of total disbelief from me. \"Alright so maybe they will, but maybe they won't tell Julius and then you can have more time\" she offered. I attempted to roll my eyes, but the pain in my head stopped me from that, guess that's my punishment for being petulant. \"Yeah ok, like that'll really happen.\" I replied after standing up and heading over to the mirror. Don't get me wrong, I love my boys and all but I doubt I could keep them from not telling Julius, especially Rev. Louie would flip out on his own but Rev would get concerned and make me feel bad for trying to keep it from them. I stood playing with my hair for a few minutes until I finally managed to get it to fall to where it was hiding a majority of the bruise, all that was left was the markings around my eye. \"Hey Brenda, do you carry any cover up on you?\" I asked, her shade darker than mine, but if I used just a little it should cover it up enough so that no one would really notice. After applying a small amount of what she grabbed from her bag and readjusting headband she loaned me to keep my hair covering my left temple, the majority of the bruise virtually disappeared. \"Nice work, you can barely see it now\" Replied Brenda after coming over to see my progress. \" That should defiantly last until you get home, just try to keep your head down as much as you can and you may be able to pull this off.\" Glad with my results, I grabbed my bag and returned the ice to the nurse just before the bell rang and began heading down the hall towards my last and final class. Brenda and I split up just before her classroom, planning on meeting in the library while the boys were in practice. I got to my last class and wandered over to where Louie had a seat waiting for me next to him and behind Rev just before the bell rang. After saying a quick hello I kept my head down, pretending I was doing something in my notebook, but not before I noticed that the boy Alan from lunch was also in this class. Our teacher, Mr. Shay who looked every bit of what a geeky math teacher should look like, began class shortly after, handing out packets containing all our daily work. I looked up quick to grab a packet from Rev and nearly dropped them all when I saw him staring at my eye. Shooting him a questioning look I went back to my packet, inwardly groaning when I saw the extensive algebraic equation I was supposed to solve, and hoping that he hadn't seen anything. After struggling through ten minutes of hell trying to solve the stupid problem, I finally got it feeling quite pleased with myself. After everyone had finished the problem, Mr. Shay showed us a shortcut to solve the problem that would have been nice to know BEFORE we worked on it. I heard Louie softly chuckle at my string of quiet insults I was throwing about the stupid class and its stupid shortcuts that would have been nice to know before the stupid problem. The next thirty minutes dragged on FOREVER ! I tuned out so much that I was positive that I was going to need an extensive date with my text book to even begin to understand our homework. Once the bell finally rang, I slowly packed up my stuff telling Louie and Rev to go ahead so I could try to avoid Julius for as long as possible. I left the room, going over all the homework that I had for the night walking past Alan, who was apparently waiting for me. \"Hey your, Annie, Julius's cousin right? I thought I should properly introduce myself\" He said after grabbing my attention. \"Yeah I am, and you're…Alan, right?\" I replied hoping that his name was actually Alan, I was never good with names after all. After gaining a nod of confirmation, we walked down the hallway in an awkward silence until he spoke up again. \"This probably isn't any of my business, but how did you get that bruise on your face?\" I swear I froze in my steps, if he had seen it who else had? \"Oh it's no big deal, I fell in one of my classes\" I replied settling for a mostly true statement. \" I'm kind of I big klutz\" I said attempting to laugh it off. \"Got it, to be honest so am I\" he replied laughing in return. He seemed like a very sweet guy, a little too scrawny to be playing football though. Figuring Julius would probably be waiting for me by my locker, I managed to catch Alan again right before he was about to disappear into the locker room. \" Hey Alan, not that it's a big deal, but can you keep this between us?\" I ask motioning to my face. \"it's really not that bad but my cousin can get kind of protective, which is something I like to try and avoid\" I finished, hoping that he would understand. \" I got it, no worries\" he replied. \" To be honest it's not that noticeably with your hair like that, I only noticed cause you were pulling at it\" he said with a quick smile before disappearing into the locker room. I wandered back down the hallway and turned to find Julius standing against my locker just as suspected. \" Hey how was your day?\" He asked while moving off to the side so I could get into my locker. \"Not that bad I suppose, I was right in my assumption that math would completely and utterly suck though\" I replied shooting him a quick smile in response to his laugh. \" But I have found a solution that will keep me alive\" \"Oh really? And what would this solution be?\" he questioned while taking my overtly large history and math book for me. \" I am simply not going to do the homework, and when a test rolls around I will beg and whine until someone takes mercy on me and helps me study\" I replied with a grin, stuffing the last of my books in my bag. \"Let me know how that works out\" he laughed as we made our way down the empty halls as I made sure that my hair still hid my left side. \"I'm going to meet Brenda in the library\" I said after we got to the locker rooms. \" Do you want to meet me in the parking lot?\" I asked already making my way down the halls. \"No that's fine, I'll come get you when practice is over, come on by if ya'll get bored\" he replied, disappearing into the locker room. I met Brenda at a table in the back of the library and began working on homework. Skip to an hour and a half later and we had effectively struggled through our Spanish and I had managed to finish the history reading and packet. Switching out my history book for my math book I began to attempt some of the problems assigned. After reading and re-reading the examples on how to solve them I managed to finish two before slamming my book shut. \"I seriously don't get this stupid problem!\" I said, startling Brenda out of her reverie. \"What's the matter?\" she asked, grabbing for my notebook and looking over my work. \" How did even get this answer?\" she questioning trying to figure out where I started to go wrong. I was saved from trying to explain my process when Julius and Petey walked into the library to collect us for the night. \"Hey girls, you missed out on an exciting practice\" said Petey while spinning a football around in his hands. \"Why's that Petey, did you actually do something today?\" asked his twin with a quick laugh at his expense. \"Hahaha, oh my you are soooo funny\" he replied shoving her lightly. \"To be honest all you missed was this fools poor attempt to do math\" jeered Julius, explaining the 'how many feet in a mile' story, \"Petey here ain't that great at keeping hold of the ball\" He laughed, slapping him on the shoulder while Petey just rolled his eyes. After grabbing our stuff and making our way out to the hall, fate threw me another blow and I found myself colliding with the floor for the third time that day; apparently me and the tiles have not had enough of each other. \"Oh god, Annie I'm sorry\" he replied, grabbing all of my stuff off the floor while Julius helped me up. \"I wasn't looking where I was going, I'm really…\" he said before faltering, his eyes wide. I didn't realize what he was looking at until I realized my hair band had slipped leaving my left side completely exposed. I shot him a quick panicked look, trying to stop the words from coming out. \"Oh no! Did I do that?\" he asked while I tried to wave him off. \" What are you talking about? There is nothing wrong\" I ground out staring at him hoping he would get the point to shut up. My efforts were pointless though, the next thing I knew Julius had snapped to attention and rounded on us to see what was going on. \"What the hell happened to you?\" He yelled while moving my hair away and turning on sunshine. \"What did you do?\" \"It's fine! I'm fine, it was just an accident\" I said in as soothing of a voice as possible, I knew he would freak. I felt really bad for Sunshine though, he was still sputtering out apologies and thought it was his fault. \"Accident my ass! What type of accident leaves your entire face bruised?\" He raged, effectively getting the attention of everyone in the halls. I looked back to Brenda in an attempt to get some help but she made sure to look everywhere but at me; my stupid cousin intimidates everyone. I attempted to explain while trying to calm down Julius but every time I did either he would go off on another tangent, Sunshine would begin profusely apologizing again, or Petey would make some comment about how bad it looked which only cause Julius to get more upset. \" Alright everyone SHUT IT!\" I yelled into the commotion, managing to shut everyone up. \"Ok, first of all Sunshine no you didn't have anything to do with this so please stop apologizing,\" I begged, feeling slightly relieved when he began to visibly relax. \" And second, Julius chill out. I promise it's not that bad, I just fell is all. You know how klutzy I can be\" I said, settling for a half truth. I did fall after all, I just don't see the need to mention that I was pushed; the less Julius knows the better. After he managed to cool down and Sunshine stopped feeling guilty we left the school, splitting up after we got to the parking lot. With a quick goodbye to Brenda I followed Julius to his car, silently laughing while I watched her scold Petey for not being able to keep his mouth shut and being insensitive. After ten minutes of an awkward silence we finally pulled up to my house and I jumped out of the car only to be stopped by Julius. \" Annie, meet me in front tomorrow again ok\" He told me while leaning over the passenger seat. \"All after all we don't want you to have any more accidents\" he muttered as he drove away, not really sure whether I was supposed to hear it or not. I could tell he didn't believe me, I always sucked at lying to him after all, but that's a battle for another day. I wandered into the house and made a bee-line for my room where I collapsed on my bed before discarding my bag on the floor. I decided a nap was in order and told myself that I would finish my math homework later. Today was the absolute definition of hell and until these stupid race wars ended it wouldn't get any better, and with that final thought I drifted off to sleep. Hurray, I have officially updated! Remember to tell me what you think and review and a big shout out to all of you who haven't given up on me or this story, I thank you! Peace out ya'll![Chapter 10] Hey everyone, thank you to all of you who have been reading this story and a big shout out to the people who reviewed my last chapter; you guys keep me going ! So without further ado, here is the next chapter; let's see what kind of trouble we can get them in today. AN: I've got a lot of reviews about people not knowing who the love interest is, just to let you know I'm doing that on purpose, I don't want to give it away yet but never fear it will be revealed to you soon. Disclaimer: I own nothing….still New York, New York 1989 Needless to say, Daddy had been a little more than upset once he got home that night. He was amazed that I had already gotten myself hurt within the first twenty-four hours of returning to school; I must say it was a new record even for me. To top it all off, my 'hide it and no one will know' theory went down the drain because not even twenty minutes after I had gotten home Louis was at my door wanting to know if I was ok, turns out a lot more people that I had hoped caught Julius's rant in the hall that afternoon. I ended up giving both him and Daddy the same story as I had Julius, although only Daddy believed me; Julius and Louie were another matter completely. I knew they didn't buy my story and that school the following day was going to be a new level of hell… Alexandria, Virginia 1971 \"Seriously Julius? There is absolutely no need to be following me like this!\" I had just come out of Spanish to find my adoring and exceedingly annoying cousin waiting for me as he had been doing all morning. Julius was being exceptionally obnoxious today and had turned into my second shadow from the moment I walked onto campus. The morning was shaping up to be bad enough without him bothering me. I had managed to cover most of my bruise effectively with my own makeup that morning but it didn't really matter, between the episode in the halls yesterday and him following me around today it wasn't hard to figure out what was going on and pretty soon our entire little group knew. It was safe to say that I was not very happy with my cousin at the moment… After waving farewell to Susan, I gave up and followed Julius to history class sending glares at the back of his head the entire way. I realized that I was acting immature but I found I really didn't care, after all I'm not a child and I don't need this much protecting. Walking into class and sending a quick hello to Coach Boone and a smile towards Louie I settled in my seat, and attempted to ignore the looks Julius was sending me. \"Alright what's the deal? Your cousin looks about ready to slap someone\" Blue asked gaining Julius's attention. \"Annie's just a little upset with me right now\" he replied while shooting me a look. \"Only because you're being extremely obnoxious!\" I shot out sending him a glare before turning around in my desk and continuing to ignore him. \"Cut him a little slack, he's just trying to look after you\" Lou replied gently from my side, soft enough so only I could hear. \"Well that's fine and all, but his attempt to look after me is getting on my nerves\" I replied, saying the last part loud enough for Julius to hear. I heard Gerry snicker before Coach Boone called the class to attention. Making sure to keep my eyes on the board, I managed to get through the entire class without so much as a word from Julius, a small blessing since I honestly would have hit him and that would have been difficult to explain to the Coach. I was up and out of my seat the second the bell rang, racing out towards the hall in an attempt to avoid my cousin. I heard Boone call the boys on the team over, something about the game that Saturday night, and I gave a silent sigh of relief. About damned time I got a moment to myself. I met up with Susan and Brenda at my locker before physics, giving me an opportunity to talk to them for the first time that morning. \"Alright so tell me, what's going on with you and your cousin?\" Susan asked coming up to one side of me with Brenda on the other. I really am lucky that I managed to find someone in this school that not only I could be friends with, but someone who could be friends with my best friend too. \" I don't know, ever since yesterday he's barely let me out of his sight, to be honest it's actually quite annoying\" I replied while hooking my arms with her and Brenda. \"You know why he's doing it don't you?\" questioned Brenda shooting me a quick smirk. \"Oh I don't know…maybe because he's simply infuriating?\" I replied while she and Susan giggled. \"No, he's doing it because he knows your lying to him\" she said laughing at my grimace. \"I heard him talking to Petey this mornin' before you got here, he was sayin' how he didn't believe that you just fell\". \"Yeah well I'm not that surprised; I always sucked at lying to him. It's not like I had much choice though, what was I supposed to say 'oh yeah I got in the middle of a fight'? God he'd never let me out of his sight if I told him that\" \"Well not to be the bearer of bad news, but he barely lets you out of your sight now\" said Susan. Not even a minute after the words came out of her mouth, I caught sight of my darling cousin rounding the corner with his football buddies at the far end of the hall, and I was sent sprawling to the floor again . I could feel my temper flare, and right when I looked up to give whoever I collided into a piece of my mind, I fell silent realizing it was the same guy who pushed me yesterday. \"Try watching where you're going next time!\" said Susan while Brenda stooped to help me off the floor. \"Its fine, not a big deal\" I replied, I really didn't want to get into it with this guy. I don't know what it was, but something about him rubbed me the wrong way; besides the fact that he obtained a fascination with knocking me to the floor. \"Hey Annie you alright?\" questioned Julius grabbing my arm and moving me slightly behind him, maybe I wasn't the only one who felt a weird vibe coming off the guy. I nodded yes, clutching my books a little tighter to my chest; this guy seriously hadn't taken his eyes off me since I got up. \"Hey Ray\" said Gerry, slapping him on the shoulder effectively getting his attention off me. \"Hey man, let's get to class; we're gonna be late\" he replied shooting Julius and Petey a look that had me hiding behind Julius a bit more, this guy was creeping me out. \"So who was that?\" Brenda asked after they left, attempting to break the silence that fell over us. \"Ray…he plays on the football team\" Petey replied after no indication that Julius would say anything. Ha! I was right when I thought he looked like a football player, although he seems a lot different from the boys I've already met and not in a good way either… Lunch finally rolled around and my anger at Julius drastically defused. After that little run in with Ray I didn't object as much to having him around, the way he was looking at me really creeped me out. Retreating to our table outside I made my way over to my spot by Louie. \"So I heard you had a little run in with Ray today\" I looked up at Louie and was slightly shocked at his dark expression. I felt Julius tense up beside me and caught Rev and Petey's quick look towards them both, maybe something had happened at camp; why else would they all be acting like this? \"So what's the deal with him?\" I asked gaining the attention of the four. \"With Ray I mean…is there something about him you don't like?\" I laughed attempting to break up the silence. \"Ray's just a little difficult to get along with\" said Rev gently with what seemed like a sad smile towards me before turning back to his lunch. \"Hard to get along with in what way?\" \"Like in the way that he's not particularly fond of people like…well us…\" replied Petey jumping into the conversation. \"Oh…got it…\" I wasn't really sure what more I could say. Well, that will certainly make English class more interesting; sitting next to a racist…fun. About ten minutes through lunch and I couldn't stand the silence anymore. No one was talking and everyone just seemed beat down. Attempting to escape, I decided to go attempt to study some in the library with Brenda and Susan, both of whom had decided to skip out on lunch and go straight there. They had decided to go to the game Saturday night and wanted to get their homework out of the way earlier. \"I'll see you guys later, I'm going to the library\" \"Wait up, I'll go with you\" said Rev grabbing his bag and standing up from the table. After saying a quick goodbye to everyone we made our way down the halls. \"So you're coming to the game tomorrow night right?\" he asked once we were far enough from the crowds. People were absolutely horrible when it came to the races mixing. I had already gotten more than enough comments from girls about me talking to Brenda; I was kind of afraid what would happen if they saw me alone with one of the boys…I hated the way I looked at times like this. After all, I may have the features of my mother but I had inherited the complexion of my father, if anything I had more of an olive toned look than a mixed one. It sucked that I could barely be around my friends and family without having someone question my 'motives'. \"I don't know, I'm still thinking about it\" I replied quietly. I barely understood the game, and it's not like I'd be hanging out with them anyway. \"Come on Annie, it'll be fun! Plus after the game we all were planning on going out.\" \"…I'll consider it….\" **Game day #1** It was about an hour before the big game and I had been lounging around the house waiting for Louie. My plans were originally to sit around at home and listen to the game on the radio with the girls, but Julius and the boys had cornered me at the end of the day telling me I was going whether I liked it or not. I finally consented after ten minutes of arguing between me and Julius, not that I had much of a choice. With that settle we decided I would ride with Louie to the game, then after I would hang around the town with the girls and Julius would drive me home. About ten minutes later I heard the door bell and grabbed my coat before running out to meet my ride. \"So you ready for the first game?\" I asked getting into his car. \"Ready as I'll ever be\" he said tossing his gear in the back. \"So do you remember anything I taught you about the game?\" \"Nope, not a thing\" We got to the school in a record time and Louie ran ahead to the locker room. I think he was getting nervous about the game because no matter how hard I tried I couldn't get him to talk and he kept tapping the steering wheel anxiously. I went up to the stands after giving him a big hug and a quick kiss on the cheek for luck, looking around to try and see if I could find anyone. I was surprised at how many people were already here, I could see the Harris's in the back and walking a little further in I saw my aunt and uncle sitting by the Jones's. \"Hey Uncle Charles\" He looked up from his conversation with Mr. Jones and gave me a warm smile before scooting over and offering me the aisle seat. \"Hello Annie\" greeted Mrs. Jones, returning my small smile. \"Brenda should be up in a minute Honey, she was helping Petey with something before the game.\" Noticing her walk in the entrance I said a quick goodbye to our families before running off to the middle section of the stands, heading for the seat she saved in the front row. Once I got there I realized that Susan was already there too. \"Hey girls, ready for the game?\" I asked filing into our aisle and dropping my bag by my feet. \"This is so exciting, I love football!\" gushed Susan before plopping down beside me and turning her gaze to the now filling stands. \"The first game is always fun\" added Brenda from the other side of me, \"and don't worry, we'll be sure to explain whites going on for you\" she giggled with Susan at my expense, I have great friends huh? \"Well that's good because I will definitely need it…which side are we supposed to be scoring at again?\" They both laughed and pointed out which side I should keep my eyes on. I figured I may not understand the game or what they're doing, but if I follow the crowds' example and cheer when the ball gets to that side then I won't look too out of place. Looking out on the field I figured that we were probably in a really good place to view the game. We were the first row of bleachers in the stands and had the perfect view of the 50 yard line, with the player's bench directly in front of us. Maybe I'll be able to pick out Louie and Julius… With five minutes to go before kick-off, the marching band was putting on a performance and the stands were stuffed to the brim with the exception of the aisle directly behind us. The three of us were getting some pretty dirty looks and I had caught my Uncle's worried gaze more than once, it probably would have been better to sit with them then by ourselves, but I doubt anything would help the situation at this point. Amazing that we all came here to support the same team, but can't bring ourselves to support each other. Once the cheerleaders filed out on to the track and our opponent team the hawks were introduced, the Titans came running out on the field. Standing up with the crowds to cheer I searched the sea of players trying to remember what number Julius was… The first half of the game flew by and we were only down by a few points, but the hawks' running back was killing us, or so Susan told me. Apparently Alan wasn't fast enough to stick with him and before we realized what happened Petey, who had already been taken out of the game by Boone, was put back in as a replacement for him. I heard a man start yelling at the coach to not take his boy out, which must have been Alan's dad; he was one intimidating looking dude. I also noticed a cute little blonde girl who had been pacing the stands for the past hour next to him, which must be Coach Yoast's daughter; she sure was a spitfire. Turning back to the game, Petey had proven to be a much better defensive player than offensive. The other team didn't know what hit them, because next thing anyone knew we had scored the last touchdown and won the game. The cheering from team barely matched the three of us jumping around and screaming. I noticed a few of the boys looking up at us and laughing at our antics but I didn't care, we had won and I inherently decided that football was more interesting than I first imagined. Following the crowds out Brenda went to go say goodbye to her family while Susan and I went to go find mine, deciding to meet back up by the school. I noticed my family heading to their car and ran up to say goodbye while dragging Susan behind me. \"Hey Auntie Hazel, Uncle Charles…this is my friend Susan I was telling you about\" I said while introducing her to them. \"Well it's nice to meet you dear\" smiled my Aunt while my Uncle nodded politely besides the car. \"Now ya'll have fun tonight and enjoy yourselves, make sure you stay close by the boys and don't stay out too late\" she fussed before Uncle Charles ushered her to the car, throwing a 'have fun' over his shoulder. Meeting back up at the school with Brenda I decided that the boys take way too long, plus I was getting really bored. A few boys started trickling out, while I tried to remember if I had met any of them. I recognized Jerry Buck from lunch and threw a quick wave to him and Tyrece, whom I had been introduced to by Julius the last time he went to play ball in the burg. Waiting a few more minutes I saw Louie followed by Rev and ran over to give them my congratulations; which was basically me throwing myself at Lou and hoping he would catch me. Laughing at Lou's surprised grunt when he caught me, I put my feet back on the floor and turned to give Rev a slightly gentler yet just as enthusiastic one. \"You boys pulled it off, great game\" they both looked away slightly embarrassed, a little pink rising to their cheeks. I wasn't sure if it was because they were being humble, or because of the pretty pink lipstick mark that now stained both of their cheeks. Giggling slightly I tried to wipe it off before any of the other boys came out. Julius, Rev, and Petey are all used to it by now, they know I'm a naturally affectionate person; still though, don't want the rest of the team thinking I'm a tramp. \"Annie, stop traumatizing the poor boys\" laughed Brenda coming over with Susan in tow. \"Now if you're done embarrassing these guys, maybe they can go hurry along our rides\" she teased while wiping the last bit of lipstick that I missed off Rev's face while Brenda produced a tissue to help Lou. After sending the two back into the fray the three of us stood around outside for a few more minutes until a lot of yelling and cheering could be heard coming down the halls. \"Well, here comes Petey\" \"Oh joy, now we get to spend the entire evening attempting to deflate his ego\" Brenda sighed while rolling her eyes at his antics. The doors to the school busted open with the sound of singing and out comes Rev and Lou followed by Petey, Sunshine, Blue, Alan, Gerry, and Julius. Petey came over followed by Sunshine and Blue, twirling a football in his hands, \"so I hear a couple of pretty ladies are looking for us\" He said smiling in Susan and my direction. \"Ya'll know its custom to congratulate the winner with a kiss right?\" \"Oh well then in that case how could I say no?\" I replied keeping my face in a mask of seriousness. \"Wait, really?\" \"No.\" And with that I walked away, leaving him to the laughter of Sunshine and Blue. I felt kind of bad though, he seemed so excited for a minute. \"Congratulations on your big win Ju\" I said giving him a hug and administering another kiss on his cheek. \"Thanks, well we gonna head on out if ya'll are ready. Do you want to hang out with us or do you want us to drop you three off somewhere\" he said while wiping off my lipstick; I really should avoid putting it on for game days. Before we could answer Gerry piped up behind Julius \"why don't ya'll hang out downtown with us?\" a chorus of agreement met us and again, we found ourselves without much of a choice. So we all set off for downtown, splitting up into three little groups amongst ourselves. In the lead were Louie and Rev who had began discussing something about school with Susan, followed by Petey and Brenda accompanied by Blue and Sunshine, leaving Julius, Alan, Gerry and I to bring up the rear and Alan's spirits. The poor guy was pretty upset about getting pulled out of the game. I guess he was real worried about what his dad was going to say once he got home. Petey carrying on about winning the game wasn't helping much either. \"Hey man, don't worry about them…they like to show off is all\" responded Gerry to Alan's complaints while throwing an arm over his shoulder before Julius stopped in his tracks. \"Wait they…what do you mean they\" He said getting real defensive really fast. \"Yes they, them up there\" Gerry said pointing to the direction where the others were. Julius managed to start up again before Gerry cut him off, both of them silencing when a car pulled up to the curb, the people inside calling to Gerry. While he was talking with whoever was in the car I went to talk to Julius. \"Ok what's your problem\" I asked catching his eye and keeping my gaze locked on his \"There is no reason to be getting all defensive, he didn't say anything to get you all riled up\" He just looked past me to where Gerry was returning to Alan's side looking every bit like a kicked puppy. \"I don't know Ann; it's just harder to get along in a place where no one wants you together\" We made our way back over to Gerry, pulling Alan back from following a group of girls down the street when we heard Petey start yelling up ahead of us then storm past us. \"Let's go Julius\" he said while storming past, Brenda pulling at his arm trying to get him to slow down and relax. \"What happened\" I heard Julius ask while walking after him and Blue following yelling for Petey to cool down. Our little group began splitting itself up, and once again, race created the boundary lines. Susan joined me by my side and explained what had happened at the restaurant. I felt so bad for sunshine, he looked absolutely miserable. \"Come on Annie\" Julius yelled from up ahead where he managed to catch up to Blue. I looked back at the second half of our group. Lou and Sunshine stood rooted to the ground while Alan was kicking at the ground and Gerry just gave me a sad smile before shoving his hands in his pockets. \"Come on Annie, we should go\" sighed Rev. I couldn't just leave though, nor did I want to. I stood there torn between two sides; on one hand was Lou and Susan as well Gerry and Alan and Sunshine, but the other hand was my family…what choice did I have. \"It's alright Annie, you go ahead; I'll see you at school on Monday\" she said giving me a sympathetic look. \"You sure? I'm real sorry about all this\" I said trying to explain something even I didn't understand. \"Annie come on!\" Julius yelled from somewhere up ahead. \"Just go Annie, its fine\" Gerry added jumping in. With that I turned and walked away, turning back once to send them all an apologetic look before catching up to where Rev was waiting a few feet away. We caught up to the rest of the group and walked in silence, listening to Petey fume and Blue telling him to cool out. \"I know it's hard right now, especially for you. But it has to get better eventually\" whispered Rev, low enough so no one else could hear. \"Eventually we won't have these black/white conflicts, and neither will you.\" I kept my eyes on the ground, all the while questioning if he knew just how hard this really was…. AN: Ok people, so here is the next chapter, Hooray! Remember to read and review, let me know what you're thinking[Chapter 11] Hey Everyone! I'd like to give a big thank you to all the people who have been consistently reviewing my story, it really means a lot. I can't believe that it's been a full year since I started this story and that I've made it this far, I have all of you to thank! Anyway, on to our story! Disclaimer: I own nothing….seriously, nothing… New York, New York 1989 Race had been keeping the people of Alexandria apart for years and no matter how hard we tried it seemed like it always had the upper hand. That first night was when I saw what power it still had over people. The friendships the boys had formed at camp and the relationships we formed on our own were tested, and that incident at the restaurant wasn't the only task to overcome that night….. Alexandria, Virginia 1971 We walked back home in silence, all of us feeling the awkward tension that filled the air. Petey was still fuming and no matter what anyone said we couldn't calm him down. I had no idea how strong of a bond this town still had on its people. The silence that surrounded us was so intense and held so many unasked questions, many of my own included. \"We should have known that nothing could change… \"Petey said bitterly from up ahead grabbing all our attention again. \"No matter what happens they are always gonna hate us here\". Nothing but silence greeted him. I looked from Blue who shook his head to Brenda who kept her eyes on the ground. \"It will get better\" replied Rev simply. \"I hope so...\" I finished quietly. That obviously wasn't what he wanted to hear. \"Oh really? So what we just saw was this town getting better?\" he asked incredulously before turning to me. \" This town isn't going to change just because we want it to, and what are you worried about; looks like you fit in just fine without our help\" My eyes widened with shock and shot up to search his face. \"What are you talking about?\" He had never sounded so angry with me before, even the others were shocked. \"Seems like you're pretty comfortable with your new white buddies, what's wrong Leanna, afraid people may find out your like us?\" His eyes darkened and he spoke with such ferocity, he's never been like this before. I felt the beginnings of tears start to prick the back of my eyes, how could he think that? \"Petey that's enough!\" Brenda and Blue both jumped to my aid, Rev had an incredulous look on his face looking between me and Petey. Julius was furious and was about to jump in before I cut him off. \"How could you even think that? I'm here with you aren't I?\" It hurt that he would accuse me of that. I had known them longer than I had anyone else; he was supposed to be my friend. \"Only because Julius and Rev made you! If you had a choice would you still be with us?\" Whatever sadness I once felt was turned to fury. \"You are my friends, just like they are; and newsflash they're your friends too!\" \"Yeah well, friends or not the town thinks it's time for us to start picking sides, including you\" \"Petey enough man, you're upset and don't realize what you're saying\" Rev jumped in attempting to be the voice of reason. \"I'm saying what she needs to hear!\" He turned from Rev and pulled out of Blue's grasp to turn back to me, where Julius was staring him down from a spot at my side. \"This town don't like us mixing and you're in a position that's gonna piss off a lot of people, so I suggest you pick a side and do it soon!\" With that he stormed off in the direction of his house with Brenda and Blue yelling after him, Rev shooting me the same look I gave Susan and the others before running off after Petey; so that's what it feels like…definitely not my favorite feeling. I stormed off in the opposite direction back towards my neighborhood and made it about a block before the tears I had been holding back began to fall. I heard Julius running to catch up behind me before he grabbed my arm and made me face him. \"Annie come on, look at me\" he said keeping his hands on both my arms to keep me from running off. I had been keeping my head down and outright refused to look at him. I hated crying in front of people, even if that person was my cousin. \"I'm fine Julius…just let me go.\" I whispered trying to writhe my way out of his grip that seemed to just get tighter. \"I've heard that before\" he replied trying to get a smile out of me. \"Annie please look at me.\" I resented and finally looked up revealing my tearstained face. He engulfed me in a hug and let me cry quietly for a few minutes, he always had hated it when I cried. \"Listen…Petey's just upset right now, he didn't mean any of it\" he said wiping off the few stray tears. \"That being said, you still didn't deserve any of that, don't let it upset you.\" I nodded and sniffled slightly before asking the question that's been bugging me since he ran after me. \"Why didn't you go with them?\" I asked looking up to see his response. He merely turned and threw an arm over my shoulders before giving a simple reply. \"Because you're my cousin, and no matter what happens I will always be on your side.\" Daddy was already home by the time we made it to my house, and after a quick goodbye and a thank you, Daddy left to drive Julius home and I was left with my thoughts. I found myself on our back porch swing, looking up at the stars like I had been doing so often. Petey's words still rang in my head, and I quietly pondered if he might have been right. Just because the boys changed didn't mean the town would, how do we know that it would get any better? I lost myself in my thoughts and found myself being pulled back to reality by Louie. \"Hey, nice night huh?\" he laughed looking up at the sky. I scoffed slightly and scooted over to make room for him on our swing. \"Everyone got home ok I hope?\" I questioned attempting some sort of small talk. \"Yeah, we all went home pretty soon after you guys left and made sure Susan had a ride\" he replied with a smile and not the slightest bit of animosity. \"That's good, so…are you mad at me for leaving?\" I couldn't help but to ask. I never wanted to leave and I didn't want them to think that I liked the others over them, but I was just so torn I didn't know what to do. \"Of course I'm not mad at you\" he said while giving me a one armed hug, \"and neither is anyone else, they all understand so don't be worrying over it anymore\" I smiled up at him for what felt like the first time that evening, he knew me too well. \"Well you guys might not be mad at me but Petey is\" he looked down at me with a scrutinizing gaze and instinctively I turned my head away, wondering if he could tell that I had been crying. \"So, what happened after you guys left?\" I told him of all the events of the night from us leaving them, to me and Petey's fight and his declaration that it was time for me to pick a side. \"He's just upset right now, you know he's never like that and I doubt he really expects you to pick a side\" he replied trying to comfort me. \"I couldn't even if I wanted to\" I said standing up and beginning to pace the porch. \"I can't choose to be just black or just white; whether anyone likes it or not I'm apart of both worlds and unfortunately I don't fit very well into either of them.\" I finished sadly while plopping down on the stair and leaning against the railing. \"Annie there's nothing wrong with what or who you are\" he said getting up and joining me on the stair. \"You alone are proof the black and white can coexist and get along, that's why you're so special, you give us all hope.\" \"Thanks Lou.\" I reached over and gave him a hug and kiss on the cheek, he seriously was one of the best friends I could ever hope for; Petey used to be in that category too. \"Yeah well I aim to please, now what is this nonsense about not fitting in\" so he did catch that. I took a few minutes before answering; to be honest even I didn't know what I was really talking about. Most of the time, especially when the race card is pulled and people have to join sides, it just feels like I'm falling, and no matter how hard I try to find some understanding about where my place is, something always overcomes me leaving me drowning within myself with nowhere to go. \"Well think about it Lou. I look more white than I do black so I can't be around my family or half my friends without causing some kind of commotion, but in doing that I'm repressing a whole side of myself.\" I looked up to make sure he was still following along and continued after receiving a nod to go on. \"I don't fit into Julius's world because no one would accept me because I'm half white, and I don't fit into your world because no one likes that I'm half black, I don't fit in anywhere here.\" \"If you want my opinion, then I say that's completely stupid\" I shot a look at him and smiled lightly once I saw the grin on his face. \"You don't need to be anything but yourself to fit in, especially with us\" \"That's easier said than done, I don't even know who I am anymore\" I glanced back up at the sky and wondered when things had gotten so hard. Never before had I worried about who I was. \"Well that's easy, you're Leanna O'Connell\" \"Thank you Captain Obvious\" \"You didn't let me finish\" I looked up and motioned for him to continue. \"you are one of the smartest and strongest people I have ever had the honor of being friends with, you stand up for what you believe in and never back down until you get it, you are fiercely loyal to your friends and family and will do anything to keep them happy, you always say what's on your mind and protect those who need it. Your funny, passionate, witty, albeit slightly sarcastic and overall a truly amazing person.\" \"Louie….that's probably the sweetest thing anyone has ever said about me.\" \"I mean it Annie, you're a great person and Petey realizes this\" \"Thanks, and to be honest I get why he said it; he was upset and embarrassed about what happened\" I looked out into the night and sighed. I may understand where the boy was coming from but I was still pissed at him; and that what he said might have been true. \"Want to know the sad thing about this whole situation?\" I asked and looked back to him, \"I think he may have been right about some of the things.\" He started shaking his head and was about to object before I cut him off and continued my explanation. \"Even if he was wrong in the way he said it he was still right\" I took a shaky breathe and continued, laying out my thoughts. \"I am in a position that's going to upset a lot of people, and that's why I've avoided telling anyone that me and Julius are related, if you think about it I have been afraid that people would find what I really am; that's not right no matter what way you spin it.\" Granted we had only been in school for two days, but in those two days I had avoid mentioning to anyone that Julius was my cousin. Susan found out on her own when I stopped Ju from getting in that fight and Julius had been the one to tell the boys. I was terrified that something would get out of hand and end up hurting someone, mainly Julius, just because of me. I wouldn't be able to live with myself had I been the cause of someone getting hurt. \"Annie what you are doing is completely different from being embarrassed of your family\" he stated. \"Like you said, you're in a position that not many people understand; what your doing is protecting yourself from ignorant people\" I looked up at him with a sad smile. \"Yeah well, I wish I didn't have to…I'm sick of hiding just to please others\" \"It will get better, you just gotta have faith and help us set the example\" he said giving my hand a squeeze before getting up to go back to his house. I sat outside a few more minutes until I heard the phone inside. Getting up I wondered who would be calling this late before grabbing the phone and hauling myself up on the counter. \"Hello?\" \" Hey Annie…\" greeted Brenda's familiar voice from the other end of the phone. \" Listen, about tonight…I don't even know how to begin apologizing for my idiot brother's stupid behavior\" she rushed out. \"Don't worry about it… I get why he said what he did-\" \" It doesn't matter! What he said was uncalled for and completely disrespectful, especially towards you\" you're telling me… \"I know you're probably really upset with us right now, but I really wanted to apologize. I feel awful for leaving you; I should've stayed instead of running off after my stupid brother…\" \"I'm not mad at you, not at all…can't say I'm too thrilled with your brother right now, but I'm definitely not mad at you or Blue or Rev.\" I replied honestly. \" Really? Cause we would understand if you were…\" \"I'm not, you guys left for the same reason I left Susan and the others; and you followed Petey for the same reason Julius followed me… I'm not mad\" \" Well you're a better person than I am, and if it makes you feel any better Petey got whooped up on by Blue and me the entire way home all while listening to a sermon by Rev\" I smiled lightly at Brenda's giggle. \"I probably sound like a horrible person, but it kinda does\" I giggled slightly at Brenda's laugh. We talked for a few more minutes and hung up after I heard Daddy come through the front door. \"Hey honey, Julius wanted to know if you wanted to go with him down to the burg tomorrow\" he said as I ventured to the living room and plopped down on the couch besides him. \"I don't think I'll go, I kinda want to just hang around the house tomorrow\" \"Does this have anything to do about the interesting night he told me about?\" He said while smiling down at me and wrapping an arm around my shoulders; I should have known he wouldn't have kept his mouth shut. \"I just don't get this town Daddy; it was never this bad before was it?\" \"Unfortunately princess it was; you and the kids were just too young to remember it\" He said with a sad smile. \"What do you mean? I hung out with the boys all the time and no one said anything to me…\" \"That's because we were more accepted in that side of town, we moved to your mother's area after you were born….we tried to find houses in other neighborhoods, but no one would sell to us.\" I looked up and scanned his face, slightly taken aback. \"Your grandparents were the ones who found us our house in their neighborhood…it's the only place that would accept us, and that was only out of respect for them\" A part of me was shocked at this development, but thinking back it all made sense. When I was little, the schools were still segregated and for some reason the district decided that I should attend the white school because of Daddy. I hated that I had to go to a separate school away from Julius and my friends, and I always wondered why none of my friends from school lived anywhere near my part of town. Granted, once people figured out why I lived in that part of town I was treated like a pariah. No one at the white school except for a few individuals would talk to me, and looking back a lot of the black kids in our neighborhood only played with me when Julius, Petey, Jerry or Brenda were there. I couldn't believe that I had missed all that; I guess I never cared to notice. I was always happy enough with my cousin and the select few who would play with me, plus my parents gave me a very sheltered life. I guess that I was never concerned with why I couldn't make many friends at my white school because I always knew that I could go home and be accepted by our little group, that they would always be there for me. Now though, now I'm not so sure I can count on that guarantee. I thought the integration would work itself out, and that people would be able to get over themselves enough to let it progress, but all it's managed to do was tear us further apart. \"…I'm worried Daddy…\" I replied looking up at him. \"I don't know how much longer I can go on doing all this, no matter what I do I feel like I'm betraying someone\" \"I know its hard baby, and I am so proud of you for staying strong through all this, but there is no reason for you to do this alone\" he said hugging me to him. \"You have your friends and family with you and no matter what you will always have me\" I sat up for another hour or so after Dad had gone to bed. This was all turning into a bigger mess than I had ever wanted, but who's to say that it had to be? Maybe some people that I don't particularly care for would be unhappy, but so what? Just because they're ignorant and miserable doesn't mean that I have to be, and like Louie said 'we have to set the example'. Maybe I could help do that without having to pick a side…who knows…. Monday Morning, 6:00 a.m. I had managed to elude both Julius and Rev for the remainder of the weekend, both of which had been calling to make sure I was ok after the incident Saturday night. I know they were just trying to check on me, but I didn't want to talk about it. I had finally gotten to a place I was ok with and even managed to talk myself down from planning on killing Petey when I got to school. I dragged myself out of the shower and begrudgingly began getting ready for school. I really didn't want to go today. I changed into a simple light blue sundress and just finished throwing my hair up when the doorbell rang. Grabbing my bag and running down the stairs I got to the door to see Louie looking just as tired as I was. \"So you ready for another fun day of school?\" He asked while grabbing my backpack from me and throwing it in the back of his car with his. \"Oh yeah, it's gonna be a blast\" I replied with an equal amount of sarcasm while sliding into the passengers seat. I was on high alert when we got to the school, I was sure Julius and Jerry weren't too pleased with me brushing them off yesterday and I didn't want to get into it this early. Too bad I had first period with Rev; I hope that he wasn't too upset. \"Hey I'm going to go to class a little early today ok?\" I gave him a quick hug before running off to my locker before home room. I still had a few problems left of my math homework, so maybe if I looked busy in class then no one would bother me, I don't mind talking to them but I know that they'll pressure me to talk to Petey like Lou had been doing. I got to class and finding the door still locked I took a seat on the floor against the wall. Pulling out my math book I began working on my remaining problems, finishing two before noticing someone sitting down at my side. \"So I heard you and Petey had a little fight\" said Sunshine, pulling out his own math book and problems. Seriously, how do people find these things out? \"It was more him yelling than us fighting\" I ground out, my temper flaring at the mention of him. \"You know he's really sorry right?\" I looked over and he continued at my confused gaze. \"He apologized this morning and explained what happened; he's been looking all over campus for you\" \"Well I'm sure a few more hours won't kill him\" I realized that I was probably coming off as a bitch, but I had yet to completely forgive him yet and wasn't sure if I wanted to make it easy on him. \"Annie you can't avoid him forever, and just for the record you can't avoid Julius and Rev either, they were looking for you too.\" He laughed as I shot him a look, it was seriously starting to bother me that everyone else seemed to have a grasp on my problems, yet I didn't. \"I don't plan on avoiding him; I just don't want to talk to him. Besides Julius knows where my classes are and we have class with Rev in ten minutes, I doubt I can avoid those two\" I replied going back to my math homework. Brenda found us and had joined our little duo in the halls. \"There you are, you know everyone's looking for you right?\" she asked laughing at my frustrated groan. Yes I know everyone is looking for me, why else would I be hiding? I'm kind of surprised they haven't found me yet; after all I told Lou where I was going. \"Just so you know, Petey spent all of yesterday holed up in his room, he felt absolutely terrible and is really sorry. I think he really wants to talk to you, that being said I still think he's a jerk and should you decide not to I would totally understand.\" \"Aren't you supposed to be on his side?\" Sunshine asked from my other side. \"Not when he's wrong…or when I'm mad at him, and currently the situation calls for both.\" Our homeroom teacher finally opened the doors a few minutes later and we made our way to the seats in the back of the room. People began filing in and it wasn't long until Rev came through the door, looking slightly relieved while taking his seat. Class started before he had a chance to say anything and before long a note ended up on my desk. Hey, We've been looking for you everywhere, Where've you been hiding? I paused before writing down my answer, wondering if I should go with the truth or something that would get everyone off my back, deciding on the latter I gave a quick response before throwing the paper back on his desk. Oh, you were looking for me? I didn't know, I haven't been anywhere in particular… I looked over and tried and failed to hide my smirk at his disbelieving look he shot me, at least he didn't seem mad. Mrs. Thorne was sending a glare around the room, commanding silence for the fifteen minutes we were stuck here giving me an excuse to not converse; that lady was seriously scary. I had successfully managed to completely my remaining math problems and packed my books away just as the bell rang. The class emptied into the halls, Sunshine running ahead to make it to his class on time while Brenda and I were the last to leave. After splitting up I was headed to my next class only to be stopped by Rev's hand on my arm. \"Your not trying to avoid me are you Ms. O'Connell?\" He asked giving my arm a playful nudge. \"Why Mr. Harris, would I ever do that…\" too bad that's exactly what I had been doing. It's not anyone's fault in particular though, it's just what I do. When I'm confused or upset about something I like to be by myself, Daddy doesn't like when I do it though; he says it's like I'm shutting down to block off the world and that makes it hard for people to get through to me. \"I know you don't want to talk about Saturday, but Julius is really worried about you, and so is Petey\" I scoffed and turned my head. Was it really so hard for people to drop it? \"Alright, alright… I get it; just promise me you'll try to talk to them?\" \"I'll see Julius third, but why do I have to be the one to talk to Petey? If he's so concerned he can come find me\" Again, I know I'm coming across as bitchy but I really didn't care. I had way too much on my mind for a Monday morning. I made it to Spanish only after I had promised Rev that I would consider talking to Petey…. I was in for a long day, and had a feeling it would get considerably worse…. AN: ok so a nice long chapter for you all! Let me know what you all think, it really does help! The next chapter is already started and hopefully will be up soon. Coming up next we have school drama, friend drama, and a conflict Annie may need some help getting out of…. Fun times in the world of high school and football.[Chapter 12] Hello Lovelies! Thanks to all my viewers and reviewers! Trust me; your reviews do a lot to keep me motivated, I'm glad to know that people are enjoying this story. So here is the next chapter, let's see what chaos will ensue today! Disclaimer: I still own nothing but a lot of student loan debts New York, New York 1989 I normally wasn't too fond of Mondays to begin with, but that particular Monday was the worst I've had in a while. I wanted nothing more than for it to end so I could go home to the peace and solitude of my house. The protesters were nearly gone due to the spectacular victory of the titans, but the animosity in the school remained. By the end of that day, my anger at Petey was gone; I had more pressing matters that need dealing with… Alexandria, Virginia 1971 I got to Spanish just as the bell rang smiling at Susan as I made my way to my seat. Our teacher wasn't there that day so after a quick reminder about our vocabulary test on Friday she gave us the period to use as a study hall. People got up and moved around the class to sit by their friends; Susan got up and filled in the seat next to me. \"Hey Susan, listen I'm so sorry about-\" \"Annie we told you its fine. Really I understand completely\" she said with a smile. \"Next time it'll be better, we'll go somewhere else\" she laughed as she got back to work on her vocabulary. She must have enjoyed herself at least a little before the night turned sour, which brought up an interesting question. \"Hey that reminds me, you seemed pretty comfortable with Louie and Rev, that wasn't your first time meeting them was it?\" I had totally blanked and forgot to introduce her to everyone but Julius, yet she had seemed so easy around the two I guess I assumed she already knew them. \"Oh yeah, I have English with Rev and Gerry, they introduced themselves when they figured out I knew you. I have French with Louis and a few of the other boys too\" that at least made me feel a little better; at least I didn't leave her completely high and dry. \"Yeah I'm sorry I forgot to introduce you to them on Saturday but a lot was going on\" \"Tell me about it, and besides I know most of them already anyway…I think Petey is the only one I haven't been introduced to yet\" \"Well consider yourself lucky\" \"Are you two still in that fight?\" I groaned and threw myself back into the chair. Seriously how did everyone know about it? Amazing how my business now involves half the people I know! Deciding to suck it up and act like the big girl I am, I answered in hopes to get at least one person to drop it. \"Whenever he decides to apologize for being a jerk then I will consider listening\" I sighed before going back to my words, choosing to ignore the eye roll sent in my direction. Forty minutes later and the bell finally rang, while I felt a little more confident that I wouldn't fail the first test of the class. Feeling pretty good I walked out and said goodbye to Susan before starting towards history class, meeting up with Julius who had been waiting down the hall. \"Where have you been?\" he asked. One thing about Julius is that he never wastes time beating around the bush; he's always straight to the point. \"Ok I get that you guys are worried, and on one hand that's really sweet of you to be; but I'm a big girl now Julius\" I said looking up at him. \"We're not kids anymore; you don't have to look out for me\" \"I know, I guess it's just hard to see you as anything but my baby cuz who I would have to defend from the bullies on the playground\" he smirk while throwing an arm around my shoulders. I looked up at Julius who was smiling down at me. It was endearing to see him being sentimental. \"It's ok Ju, I don't mind too often.\" History and physics had flown by and I was in a much more amiable mood. I even figured out that besides Susan I also had Leroy, another boy from the football team who would often play ball at the burg, in my physics class. The three of us were walking to lunch together, Susan and Leroy discussing one of the laws of motion we had just gone over in class when I realized I forgot my psychology book in my locker. Telling them both to go ahead and that I'd meet them in the lunch room I ran back to retrieve my forgotten book. After swapping materials and closing my locker door I jumped back in surprise to see Ray leaning against the wall next to me. \"Oh sorry, you s-startled me\" I stuttered taking what I hope was an unnoticeable step back. Now it takes a lot to scare or unnerve me, but something about this guy just wasn't right. He took a second to look me over before responding; I didn't like the look in his eyes. They looked dark and seemed to be hiding a hidden purpose that contradicted the suave grin he had plastered on his face. \"Well then it's entirely my fault for startlin' you\" he retorted, looking me over one last time before advancing a step that had me backing up into the lockers. \"I've seen you hanging around the football team a lot, especially that Julius character\" a fleeting sneer grazed his face at the mention of my cousin. \"Don't tell me a pretty thing like you is with him?\" His intentions were crystal clear at that point; I would have been offend had I not realized I just backed myself into a corner and silently began to panic. \"Julius? Oh no we're not dating. I'm his-\" \"Well that's good news, maybe now you can do me the honor of a date this Friday after the football game\" he took another step closer and his eyes made him look more like a predator than a teenager. \"I'm sorry but I don't think so\" He took another step closer as his dark eyes got darker and I pressed myself farther against the lockers, I had been creeped out before but this was getting my nerves on edge. I was silently hoping for a little assistance from anyone at that point when I heard a familiar voice ring through the now empty hall. \"What's going on here?\" Looking to the right I saw Petey in the halls staring Ray down with a look that could freeze hell. I have never been happier to see him in all my life. I could feel any and all anger that I once had at him melting away. \"Petey hi!\" I said, scrambling to his side after Ray took a step back. \"We were just talkin\" He looked me over once more and Petey stepped slightly in front of me so I was now at a place behind his shoulder. \"Well if you'll excuse us we have to be somewhere\" he replied glaring back at Ray before putting his arm around me and leading me away. We made it half way down the hall before I had the sensation that someone was watching us, turning my head slightly I saw that Ray was still standing there staring at us before he turned and walked away. I waited until we were out of eyesight before I threw my arms around him in a hug. \"Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you!\" I rushed out. Ray was freaking me out and I'm not sure what I would have done had Petey not came along. \"By the way we are totally and completely even now\" He laughed slightly before his face turned suddenly serious. \"Listen Annie, I don't know what you got yourself into with Ray; but stay away from him, that boy is bad news\" yeah 'cause I didn't know that already. \"And for the record I really am sorry about everything, I had no right to fly off the handle at you…I was actually looking for you to tell you that\" \"And I can't tell you how happy I am that you were\" I replied giving him another hug. \"And for the record, you're forgiven\" He smiled happily down at me and gave me another brief hug before we broke apart to enter the cafeteria. We went straight to our table outside and I took my spot between Julius and Louie, waiting for the rest of the guys to fill in our table. \"So you guys finally made up I see\" Alan mentioned from his place by Petey's side. \"Ok seriously, how does everyone know about that?\" I asked looking from face to face. \"You can't hide much from us\" he smirked from Peteys side. \"Plus this poor fools been running around campus all day looking for you\" Blue piped in from beside Alan. I guess that's one of the hazards of knowing the football team, everyone knows your ordeals; oh well…better having them than nothing I guess. An amiable peace fell over the team once again, except in the world of Julius and Gerry. I had noticed how they barely spoke to each other in history and now Gerry was sitting and the end of the second table instead of his normal place at Julius's side. \"So what's going on with you and Gerry?\" I asked him quietly, noticing how he tensed up at the mention of his name. A minute passed and I assumed that he wasn't going to answer. \"I'll tell you later\" now normally I would have pushed the subject, seeing as how I would have never gotten away with that lame excuse, but let it drop hearing the 'no argument' tone in his voice. It was getting towards the end of the period and I began looking around for Susan and couldn't find her anywhere. I was about to ask Brenda if she knew where she was until I caught sight of a certain figure by Gerry, none other than Ray of course. I immediately looked down, pretending to be interested in the cover of my notebook and when I snuck a peek towards him and saw his eyes locked on me. \"You ok Annie?\" Rev asked from the other side of the table. I nodded yes before catching Petey's eye and shooting mine to where Ray was standing by Gerry. He looked back at me before Alan drew the attention of the table to him. \"Looks like Ray can't keep his eyes off you\" He mentioned lightly with a look that reminded me a lot of a grimace; hmmm funny, I thought they were friends. As soon as his observation flew from him mouth Rev, Brenda, Louie, and Julius all snapped their heads up while I kept mine down. \"Yeah well, he needs to keep to himself\" I mumbled lightly before risking a glance up. \"Did something happen?\" asked Rev, a look of concern cross his face. \"Did he do anything?\" \"No he didn't, just asked if I wanted to go out after the game Friday\" I assured them, shooting Petey a warning look when he opened his mouth. \"Wait he asked you out?\" Brenda whispered quite loudly, not attempting to hide her look of disgust. \"I thought you said he wasn't a fan of our kind\" she said turning to her brother. \"I don't think he knows, he didn't know me and Julius were related anyway\" I replied, keeping the other details to myself like the fact he thought I was dating Ju; yuck! \"Your not going out with him are you?\" asked Julius who had been surprisingly quite so far. \"I wasn't planning on it\" I replied. I thought we had just gone over the overprotective thing? \"Annie this isn't something for you to mess-\" \"I just said I wasn't going out with him!\" I nearly yelled. Why was I getting a sermon when I had already turned the guy down? \"I imagine this will make English more interesting though…\" I finished gently. \"Just let us know if he bothers you, we'll take care of it\" Louie finished from my side, getting up at the bell. I wondered quietly what taking care of it would ensue. Julius had insisted that I meet him at my locker again at the end of the day and with that Rev, Brenda, and I all left to psychology. After an hours' worth of Brenda kicking the back of my chair to get me to concentrate whenever the teacher looked towards where we were sitting, we packed up and headed towards English; Rev insisted on walking us to class. Taking a breath I headed towards my seat in the back beside Ray, who pounced on the subject of a date as soon as I sat down. \"So why won't you date me?\" he asked, the alarming darkness returning to his eyes. I tried to think of an excuse, but all that was coming to mind was 'I don't date creeps' and I was sure that wouldn't go over well. I caught Brenda's gaze who was watching our entire encounter. I jumped slightly when I felt a hand brush against my knee and jerked it out of the way before rushing out a response that I prayed would work. \"I don't date\"…. not the best reason …. \"What do you mean you don't date?\" he asked incredulously. \"My daddy won't let me, not till I'm seventeen…\" I lied easily, actually the rule was that I couldn't date till I was 16, and my sixteenth birthday was nine months ago; but what's the harm in adding another fake year if it gets a guy off your back? He withdrew his hand and shrunk back into his desk, but not before sending a glare towards Brenda. The rest of the class was spent going over sonnets to get us into our Shakespeare unit, and thankfully not another word was from Ray. The bell rang and I gathered my belongings, Ray 'accidently' brushing against me on his way out. \"So what did you tell him?\" Brenda asked coming back to my seat. \"I told him my daddy didn't let me date\" I giggled; I can't believe he bought it. We were met out in the halls by Louie who was currently staring down Ray, who walked away when I went to Lou's side. \"So I'm guessing you're here to walk us to class\" I asked, giggling slightly when he insisted on taking both our books for us, he sure had the chivalry thing down. We dropped Brenda off in her science class and made it to math just in time. Settling in my seat behind Rev I began to search for my homework, pulling out the crumpled and folded piece of paper from the bottom of my bag. Jerry turned around looking over the mess that was my homework and gave me a look that clearly stated 'what happened to it' when we were asked to hand up our answers. \"Hey at least I did it!' I whispered indignantly, narrowing my eyes at the snicker coming from Alan. We finished taking notes early and were told to start our homework for the night, either Rev or Alan turning around every once in a while to aid me when I started to growl in frustration; I swear math is a torture tactic not a subject! Once class finally finished I walked with the boys to the locker room before going to get my stuff from my locker. I met Julius there as promised and made my way to the library where I had assumed I was meeting the girls; Susan had agreed to stay with us after practice to keep us company. Petey stopped me in the hall and mentioned that they were going to go watch practice today and told me to meet them in the stands. I made my way out across the parking lot and to the field where the coaches were already setting up and noticed Brenda and Susan speaking with Boone, walking up to hear the last bit of the conversation. \"I don't see why you girls can't watch; just make sure you stay in the stands\" Replied Coach Boone, sending a rare smile towards our little trio. That man was easily turning into one of my favorite teachers. After thanking him we made our way up to the top of the stands. \"So why are we watching their practice?\" I asked while taking a seat on the bleachers and pulling out my history homework. \"It's nice out today, and plus I've been wanting to check out what their practices are like\" Susan told me and Brenda. We sat there watching the football practice and turned our attention briefly to the cheerleaders who were practicing on the farther end of the field. \"You know, I've always wanted to be a cheerleader\" Brenda said, turning her attention back to the boys. \"Really? Well, why didn't you try out?\" I asked, taking my eyes off the field and turning back to where the cheerleaders were warming up. \"I don't know, I went to the try outs a couple of times but always ended up backing out\" \"That's too bad, I think you'd be good at it\" I told her, turning my attention back to my history book in an attempt to get something done; I really should've just given up. Every time I tried to go back to my work something would grab my attention or I would get the weird feeling that I was being watched again. After practice finally ended we packed up our things and went down to the locker rooms to wait for the boys. Susan had left already and Brenda ran back into the school to grab a jacket that she forgot, leaving just me waiting outside the gym. I got the weird feeling of being watched again and turned around to find Ray standing a few feet away. He grabbed my arm and pulled me behind the bleachers officially moving me from freaked out to scared as hell. \"I don't get you, you say you can't date but then go off with the rest of the football team\" he smirked; tightening the grip he had on my upper arm and making me wince. \"What do those colored boys got that I don't?\" I felt my anger start bubbling to the surface behind my fear. Now, when it comes to fights, I usually know my limits of what I could handle and Ray was way beyond those limits. He was easily twice my size in both height and weight if not more so, and I knew they was no way in hell I could take him. That being said, I may know my limits but there are times I don't always follow them, and now was one of those times. I don't care who you are, you don't have the right to lay a hand on me. \"What the hell are you talking about?\" I shot out attempting to pull my arm from his grasp only to have him tighten his grip more. \"I saw you caring on with them, god knows it's not giving you a good reputation\" he shot out. \"My reputation is none of your concern!\" His grip on me tightened more, making me gasp at the pain shooting threw my arm. \"Maybe I want it to be…\" he replied leaning closer. I step back as far as his reach would let me before slapping him hard enough to leave my hand burning and stinging. I reared back and was about to hit him again but he caught my wrist in his grasp, closing his hand around it tight enough to make me yelp. Now with both my arms caught, my fury quickly reverted back to fear. He opened his mouth to say something when the doors to the gym burst open. Startled by the interruption he released me roughly and disappeared out the side exit leaving me shaking. Taking a deep breath I ran out the front exit before whoever had come out of the gym had time to see me, running until I reached Julius's car. Leaning against the hood I tried to steady my nerves before my cousin came. The smart thing to do would be to tell him what just happened and what happened earlier today, but I couldn't bring myself to do so. I'm not sure if it was my pride refusing to let me ask for help or embarrassment because I didn't know how to handle the situation but one thing was for sure, no one was going to find out about this. Besides, Julius would've killed him had I said anything anyway. I began to relax, telling myself that it would be ok and that I could handle it. I saw my cousin and a few others head my way and taking one more deep breathe I hoped that Ray would find a new plaything to capture his interest soon… AN: Ok everyone, so we have a little drama in this chapter! Tune in next time for our next football game and the revelation of a few secrets! (P.S. I'm really sorry if any of you out there really like Ray, but I couldn't bring myself to write him any other way. He always provided the perfect tough guy jerk persona and I couldn't pass that up. I hope this doesn't stop any of you from reading it.) Please Review and tell me what you think, they motivate me more than you could ever know. Peace out everyone![Chapter 13] Hello! OK so this chapter was supposed to be out a week ago, but I hit some dead ends that had to be roughed out. Another huge shout out to my readers and reviewers, you guys keep me going more than you realize. On to the story! Disclaimer: I still own nothing….sigh…. New York, New York 1989 After that encounter I realized how afraid of Ray I really was, which scared me more. I couldn't remember the last time I had been afraid of someone, and to know that he could physically overpower me and had every intention of doing so terrified me. But for some reason, I couldn't bring myself to tell anyone, I had been adamant that I could handle the situation on my own, turns out I was wrong… Alexandria, Virginia 1971 I slid into the passengers' seat of Julius's car after he said his goodbyes. My wrist was sore and my arm was hurting, all I wanted to do was go home. We sat in silence for a few minutes until I braved breaking the silence with my previous question from lunch. \"So what's going on between you and Gerry?\" I asked again, watching his grip tighten on the steering wheel before giving out a clipped answer. \"Guess he's not who I thought he was\" His hard expression was focused on the road and I was totally confused, Gerry seemed civil enough in school. \"What does that mean?\" He looked over to me before explaining how Gerry had apparently stood him up at the burg on Sunday. \"Guess Bertier's just a lot of talk\" He sighed turning his eyes back on the road. To anyone who didn't know Julius better, you would just assume he was pissed at the guy; I on the other hand knew better. Little known fact about my cousin; he doesn't make friends easily. I think that's why he was upset, he took a chance when making friends with Gerry and so far it's done nothing but cause trouble. \"Ju I'm sure there's a good explanation. Did you talk to him about it?\" I asked him gently. I may have had my doubts before, but I think Gerry really is a good guy. I think it would do Julius a lot of good to hang around with him too. Ever since I got back I realized that Julius has a lot of anger in him, he needs someone that will keep him in check and can balance him out and I felt Gerry could do this. Don't get me wrong, his friends now are great, but I don't think they have the ability to do what Gerry could. Jerry and Petey understand him and have been best friends for as long as I can remember and know how to calm him and all, but Petey tends to run from conflict and Jerry won't push back. Julius needs someone who has just as much aggression as he does, but won't be intimidated by him and isn't afraid to get in his face and fight back if need be. \"There's nothing to talk about\" His features in his face hardened as he once again turned back to the road. \"This is the way it has to be\" \"…Julius…\" I stopped myself and just turned to look out the window. If he wasn't willing to try to make it work, then nothing I would say could change his mind. I slumped back in my seat and starred out at the town flying by, I found myself wondering what the point was of forcing these people together when it seemed neither side was willing to give. We pulled up to the front of my house and left after asking Julius to talk to Gerry one last time, all that met me was silence. Walking up the drive I noticed Dad was actually home and wasn't sure if I was thrilled or concerned about this. I had so much on my mind and Daddy was always a great listener, but I knew I couldn't tell him most of what was going on. Sure I could tell him about Julius and how much I was slowly starting to hate school, but anything dealing with how to handle my problem with Ray would have to be kept to myself. After dropping my bag in my room, I went down to his office and plopped myself into the chair across from his desk placing my head on my arms. I figured that I may not be able to tell him everything, but he could help me figure out some of my problems leaving me with more time to deal with my Ray situation. \"So I take it you had a bad day?\" he asked looking up from his notebook covered with illegible scribbling. \"I don't think bad could cover what today was\" I told him, my voice slightly muffled from where my head was buried in my arms. \"Alright, what happened? Are you and Petey still fighting?\" He asked closing the files scattered around his desk before giving me his full attention. \"No actually, we made up. I guess I'm just mad at how stupid people seem to be\" I sighed and slouched against the back of the chair. \"Sure the protesters are nearly gone, but the inside is as bad as ever.\" I had thought that after the amazing win on Saturday, the Titans would be able to show the school that it is possible to pull together. If anything the students tried to pull apart more. They segregated themselves in the classrooms and hallways, and made sure that anyone who crossed the boundaries knew it was unacceptable. People were shameless, turning against one another because of something as trivial as race, saying things that were completely uncalled for in a polite society. Earlier today one particularly nasty girl had called me an array of colorful terms, mostly some deviation of 'whore', just because Blue and Leroy had walked me to physics. \"Well honey you knew it wasn't going to be easy\" he sighed and gave me a sad smile. \" It's not fair to ask you kids to deal with a situation that's going to take years to fix, but you guys can't give up. There are a lot of people that have been stuck in their ways for so long they just don't know how to change, that's why you kids need to set the example for what the future will be like\" he finished, giving my hand a squeeze. \"Well that's good and all, but it's impossible to do so if no one wants to set the example\" \"They just don't know what to do, that's why the people who are willing to accept the change need to show them how\" he said sending a knowing smile my way. I knew he was right, but I hated that he had to be; this all seemed way too complicated even for high school. I spent the rest of the night doing my homework and trying to figure out what to do. The people at school are still too new to the idea of integration to try something drastic or dramatic and without the football team I doubt anything would get done. They are the ones in this town who have managed to bypass the racial boundaries and come together, but even they are starting to pull apart…. I woke up early the next morning and stood at my closet for close to fifteen minutes trying to decide what to wear. Ray had been rougher than I thought yesterday and ended up leaving a bruise, so something with sleeves was in order. I was pissed when I woke up to find a hand shaped mark adorning my upper arm as well as one on my wrist, the one he gave me the first day of school had just faded enough for no one to notice. Picking out a black top with sleeves coming down to my elbows and a black and white plaid skirt, I quickly showered and changed applying a little makeup along the way to hide what remained on my face. Looking down at my wrist and examining the black and blue coloration along the side I quickly threw on a few bracelets, effectively hiding what was there. School passed in a similar fashion to the day before. The team was beginning to break apart and no one could pull it back together. During class the boys stayed to themselves and no one spoke to each other, racial tensions splitting the team in half. By the time lunch rolled around the boys still sat by one another, but now one of the two tables held the white players and the other table held the black players. I was tempted to skip out on lunch and avoid it all together but I had been successfully dodging Ray all day and didn't want to risk it. Walking to the back patio and looking between the two tables I could feel my heart breaking. My cousin was at one end and Gerry was at the complete opposite. All of the players had filled in next to them, and even Alan had abandoned his spot by Blue for one by Gerry, looking as miserable as the rest of them did. Sunshine and Louie were seated at the conjunction of the two tables, Rev and Blue sitting next to them. Those guys were trying so hard to make something come of all of this but nothing they did was helping. Noticing Susan at her spot under the tree I walked past the table, Brenda getting up to follow me, opting to sit away from the boys today. I was still a little miffed at my cousin about how flippant he was being about all this. Smiling at Susan, we sat down in the grass under the shade of the tree, enjoying the comfortable silence compared to the uncomfortable tension surrounding the rest of the school. \"Is it just me or does everything seem to be getting worse?\" Brenda asked, switching so she was lying on her stomach. \"No, it really is getting worse\" I replied from my spot against the tree trunk. \"I guess we just have to find a way to deal with it, not much else we can do…\" \"I knew this was going to be hard, but I wasn't expecting all of this\" Susan sighed, lying back on the grass. \"This is our welcome to the real world I guess\" I finished, looking sadly over at the boys before turning to the math book that I had pulled out of my bag. By the time English had rolled around I had managed to come up with a decent plan about how to avoid Ray. Faking sick during the end of Psychology I managed to put on a decent performance that left both Brenda and Rev insisting that I go to the nurse during English. After a quick stop by class I grabbed a pass from my still skittish teacher and was escorted by Rev to the nurse despite my insistence that it was unnecessary. Walking into the office I was ushered to a cot before Jerry ran off to his class. I told the nurse that I was feeling faint and she insisted that I lay down for the period, easily getting me out of the remainder of class. That was one trick I learned a while ago, if you tell a nurse you're faint or dizzy then they'll leave you alone. I left the nurse after English was over and begrudgingly made my way to Math. I was relatively pleased at how I had handled my Ray problem today, but I knew I would have to come up another plan soon. I couldn't keep ditching out on English or someone would eventually figure out what was going on. I walked into class just as the bell rang and settled into my desk, barely listening to the lecture given. My notes turned more into scribbles and doodles and I was pretty sure I was screwed when it came to the homework for the night, but I really didn't care. I was so tired all of a sudden and really just wanted to go home. The boys usually had a half hour break before football practice started so I could probably get Julius or Louie or someone to take me home, especially after my decently convincing performance this afternoon. Just as I had hoped, Louie offered to drive me home before his practice. I guess Brenda told him I was sick when he came to collect us from class. Packing up my stuff and waving a farewell to the boys we made a quick stop at his locker before going to mine. We were making our way to the parking lot when we noticed Julius and Blue waving us over from Leroy's car. \"Hey where ya'll going?\" asked Julius from his spot on the hood of the car. \"I'm not feeling too well so I was gonna go home\" I told him quietly, hoping he wouldn't call me out. \"Louie said he could drive me\" \"Thanks man\" he said looking away from me and nodding in his direction. I noticed a few other boys making their way to the field, including Gerry and Sunshine, and was about to ask Julius if he had talked to Bertier yet until I noticed Ray was with them. \"We should probably go, can't have you being late\" I said, quickly looking away and starting towards his car. We made it back to my house leaving Lou plenty of time to get back to the school, leaving me to the silence of my house. It wasn't long until I had passed out on my bed, waking later that night to eat and finish what little homework I had before returning to bed. I think Daddy suspected that something was wrong, because every so often I could hear him pause outside my door before continuing down the hall. He hates it when I won't tell him what's going on, but he always gives me my space when he knows I need it. The rest of the week progressed at the same rate, and the boys were drawing more apart and even I found myself avoiding people more and more. I stayed away from Julius and most of the football team, opting to spend more time by myself or with the girls. I noticed the worried looks but couldn't help but to draw into myself more. Ray had been getting bolder and I was running out of options. I had already skipped two and a half English classes, and the other two were spent trying to ignore his advances and 'accidental' touches. I did all I could to make sure I didn't run into him while I was alone in the halls and refused to acknowledge him in class in an attempt to wait out this fascination he had for me. I was starting to get really worried. Between his leering at practice, touches in class, and cornering me in the hallway, my anxiety was skyrocketing. I was terrified that the next time I ran into him, there wouldn't be another interruption to get him to stop. Even with all the precautions I was taking I still had a few close calls, one particularly close one on Thursday afternoon. I had forgotten a book in my locker again, and when I doubled back to get it Ray had met me there, grabbing my arm and tossing my back against the wall when I tried to walk away. He asked again about Friday, his eye's darkened and grip tightened when I said no again. He finally left me alone and let me go when talking was heard coming down the halls. He disappeared around the corner just as Louie and Blue appeared at the opposite end, leaving me close to tears and pressed against my locker. Lou had been close to panic at seeing me like that and immediately took me to the nurse after I told him I was just dizzy. Blue had run back to the lunch room and less than ten minutes later Julius was storming into the office demanding to see if I was fine. I couldn't bring myself to look at him when I gave him my excuses, but it didn't matter; based on the look he was giving me I knew he didn't believe me, but he sat with me anyway and stayed for the remainder of lunch. After what seemed like an eternity, Friday afternoon finally arrived and the normal game day mentality was replaced with an uncomfortable solemnity. The team looked beaten down and I was seriously concerned about what kind of performance they were going to be able to deliver. It had been a bad week and the boys were receiving the brunt of it, and as much as I wanted to go to support them I had concerns of my own to handle, all of them going by the name Ray. By the end of the day Brenda and Susan had begged, bartered, and commanded that I go with them until it all ended in a group free for all before we had left the parking lot. \"Annie you have to go and that's that!\" Petey told me, shrinking back slightly at the withering glare I was sending him. \"Guys come on, I haven't felt well all week, I really want to relax tonight\" I whined, ignoring the stare Julius was currently sending me, he knew something was wrong with me, but he also knew sickness wasn't it. \"Come on Annie, you've barely hung out with us this week\" begged Brenda, getting a nod of confirmation from Susan. \"Just one night, we can leave early if you start not feeling well\" \"We really could use the support tonight\" Rev said from where he was leaning against the door of his car. I didn't think that it was fair that they all decided to team up against me; that has to be constituted as cheating. \"Alright, alright. You win, I'll go\" I relented; climbing into Julius' car after agreeing on a time we would meet. The ride home was silent, the same as it had been for the past week. I was about to get out when Julius shot an arm out to stop me, I had to repress the wince when he grabbed a particularly sensitive part of the bruise Ray gave me. I was honestly surprised at how well I had been able to hide them and didn't want to give myself away now. \"Ann I don't know what the hell has been going on with you lately, but something's up and I'm not the only one who realizes it\" He started, gently pulling me back into the car. \"Come on Annie, you know you can always talk to me…what's going on with you?\" \"Julius nothing is going on, I'm fine\" I replied, keeping my eyes trained on a spot behind his head. \"Don't give me that, I know better! You've been avoiding all of us, Brenda and Susan included\" he tried to get me to look at him, but I couldn't. I knew if I tried I would end up blurting out everything. \"I haven't been avoiding you… I've just been busy…\" I replied, lowering my eyes to where my hands were folded in my lap. \"Come on Annie, I'm just trying to help you. Don't shut us out, you worry us when you do that\" he sighed, releasing my arm and allowing me to finally get out. I hated when he did that! He had no problem making me feel guilty that I don't talk about my problems, but the second he has one the situation turns too complicated to talk about. Dropping my bag at the door, I sighed at how this week had turned out and made my way over to the phone to call my dad. Brenda and Susan had suggested that we do a girls night complete with a sleepover, and my father was super anal when it came to me to staying anywhere he was unfamiliar with. After giving him the basics and leaving a list of phone numbers on the counter I trudged upstairs to pack an overnight bag when an idea struck me. When the boys were at camp, they were avoiding each other and having trouble coming together at first too. It was only when the two leaders broke down did the others following. Now that they're having trouble coming together again, maybe it can be fixed the same way. Maybe if Julius and Gerry can find a way to get over themselves again, then the rest of the team will follow suit. I've already tried talking to Julius with no avail, but Gerry, maybe all he needs is a little push in the right direction… Louie came to get me that night at six, causing us to rush so he could gear up in time for Boone's pep talk and warm up. I however had followed him from the parking lot; after all I had a little pep talk I had to give too. \"OK so don't let the other team get in your head; you guys have had a rough enough week without all of them\" I rushed out giving him one last hug. \"Alright, well have fun and enjoy yourself and… I don't know, hit a lot of people… or do something of that nature\" I finished lamely, smiling his laugh; I knew I could get him to smile at least once. I waited outside the locker room for a few more minutes, ignoring the strange looks I was getting from a lot of the guys and hoping they wouldn't tell Julius I was out here. He would be pissed if he figured out what I was up too. I saw Gerry round the corner and quickly pulled him aside and down the opposite hall. \"Alright listen Bertier, something has to give here. The team is falling apart at the seams, and it won't be too long until it's proven by the scoreboard\" I rushed out, glancing around the halls. \"What do you expect me to do about it?\" he questioned, looking slightly taken aback by my forward approach. \"Well you're the captain right?\" I asked receiving a slow nod in confirmation. \"As captain it's your job to find a way to pull them together. This is your team Gerry, are you honestly happy just sitting back and watching it fall apart?\" \"Of course I'm not! But what do you expect me to do when no one else is willing to compromise?\" I was ninety-nine percent sure that was a direct shot against my cousin, but I had to pick my battles at this point. \"Then make them compromise, but you gotten show them how\" I told him searching his eye's for some sign that he was getting what I was saying. \" You have to prove to them that it's possible, you have to set the example\" \"How am I supposed to do that?\" \"Talk to Julius-\"He cut me off with a scoff and I could tell he was getting upset. \"Why should I talk to him? I'm not the one with the problem, he is!\" He yelled back, but I couldn't back down, not yet anyway. \"Listen, I get that he's your cousin and your trying to help him but-\" \"That's not why I'm doing this Gerry! Yes he's my cousin, and it sucks to see him upset, but it's worse when it's between him and someone I consider a friend, plus it's pulling a lot of people down with you\" He took a step back and I could see his face soften drastically. \"I consider you a friend Gerry, you and most of the other players on the team, but everyone who says they don't want us to be together is going to win unless we show them that nothing they can do will change us\" I told him gently. \"Alright alright, but how are we supposed to prove anything?\" \"Just talk to Julius, just try to at least\" I said with a small smile. \"You gotta take the first step captain, my cousin can be a stubborn jackass most of the time, but he does listen to reason\" With that I left, hoping that he would take our little chat to heart. We were half way through the game and the guys, well to be honest they sucked. They were fumbling and were getting tackled left and right. As much as I had hoped something would come of my little talk with Gerry he seemed just as distant as before, but at least I can say I tried. I caught the eye of Rev every once in a while and shot a hopefully encouraging smile toward him. The guys were playing with no heart and he knew it, I hope this was just a one game occurrence. The final play was made and the titans had barely managed to pull off another win, but I had no idea how. Most of the guys retreated back to their respective houses to nurse their wounds, but for Susan, Brenda and I the night had just began. I was surprisingly feeling a little better. I had tried to help Julius even though he wouldn't help himself, and hopefully Gerry hadn't completely disregarded my little pep talk; and yes I knew I was being hypocritically, but my situation was a little more complex than I cared to admit at the point. We were currently lounging in Susan's room playing a rousing game of truth or dare, which quickly turned into truth or truth. It was amazing what you're willing to share with others when they are willing to share with you. Thank god we didn't do this at Brenda's house; otherwise Petey would be in here every few seconds. \"So, have you guys gotten homecoming dates yet?\" Asked Susan who was flipping through her record collection. I had totally forgotten about homecoming to be honest, but most people don't start asking until the week before. \"Ha! Yeah cause Petey would let a guy within ten feet from me\" Brenda mumbled from her spot across the foot of the bed. \"I had forgotten about homecoming with everything going on\" I replied. \"To be honest I'm kind of surprised they're still having one\" \"Well what about you Susan has anyone asked you yet?\" Her face turned red as she mumbled out a quick no and turned back to her records, I definitely know that look. \"Well do you have anyone you would like to ask you?\" I giggled sitting up. \"The dance is next Saturday after all.\" Her red face turned brighter as she mumbled something and gave a shrug. We immediately jumped on the chance, badgering her until she finally broke. \"I don't even know if he'd like me! He's more out there, and kind of popular, and athletic, and he probably thinks we're just friends and it be weird if it did work out, plus I'm not even sure it's allowed here…\" she finished before Brenda shot me a confused look and a few pieces popped in place. I don't know how I didn't see it before. I've noticed her glancing at him quite a bit during lunch when she doesn't think anyone is watching and during practice her eyes barely leave him. Loud, exuberant, athletic, popular…she likes Petey. I kept my mouth shut for the time being, I'm not sure if this is the right time to share this piece of news, and I'm sure Susan doesn't want too many people to know either, especially his twin. \"OK, well what about you Brenda\" I said trying to get the attention off Susan for a minute. \"Why do I have to go next, what about you?\" she narrowed her eyes trying to catch me lying. \"Because I don't even plan on attending\" I told her with a grimace before her and Susan flipped like I suspected. \"I'm not even sure if I could, my grandparents were talking about planning on coming for a visit next weekend\" They both stopped and shot me a sympathetic glance. My grandparents had called Daddy earlier and told him they were planning coming up, and should they choose to, me going to a dance would not be in the cards. Daddy would let me go if I told him I wanted to and deal with them on his own, but I wouldn't do that to him. If they found out I was at an integrated dance they would freak and give my father absolute hell. \"Do you mind me asking you something personal?\" Susan piped up when we had fallen into a silence. I nodded and she took a second to look me over trying to word her question \"What's up with you and Ray?\" I sighed and unconsciously began rubbing my wrist. \"Nothing's going on, he's just not too pleased that I turned him down\" I said, flipping so I was lying on my back. I heard a gasp and looked over to where Brenda was looking at where my shirt sleeve had shifted up, revealing the now healing bruise. They coloration had turned into a yellowish brown, but it still showed a clear impression of a hand. She looked from me to my arm as I scrambled up and jerked my sleeve back down, rubbing more at my wrist while silently chastising myself for getting caught. \"What the hell happened?\" she whispered grabbing at my sleeve and pulling it up before I could move out of her way to show Susan. \"Annie it looks like a handprint!\" Damn! I was hoping she didn't see what it looked like, maybe then I could've passed it off as nothing. \"It's nothing, don't worry about it\" I said moving off to the side of the bed and away from their eyes. \"Annie that ain't nothing!\" She cried getting up to follow me \"Wait a second…did Ray do that to you?\" I whipped my head up, my eyes wide. \"I knew it; I knew something was up with him! That's why you've been skipping English!\" \"Annie have you told Julius?\" Susan asked from my side. \"NO! No, and he's not going to find out either!\" I said glaring from both Susan and Brenda, cutting Brenda off when she was about to protest \"You know what Julius would do if he found out! Just trust me, he'll get tired of me and go bother someone else, but until then no one can know, I can handle it\" \"And what happens when he doesn't get bored?\" Susan asked, worry etched across her face. \"Annie what happens if next time he doesn't stop at just giving you a bruise?\" \"Don't worry; I'll let someone know before it gets that bad\" \"It's already that bad Annie! If you won't tell Julius, then maybe you can talk to Boone or Yoast, they'll know what to do\" Brenda begged, this is exactly why I didn't want anyone to find out, now I have everyone all worried. \"Don't worry, I promise I'll take care of it ok?\" I replied trying to get them to calm down. \"You better, because if you don't then we will\" Susan said. I seriously hoped it wouldn't get that bad though, otherwise it might be too late… AN: Alright everyone, a nice long chapter for you all! Sorry it took long to get out, but I had to fix some things. Tune in next time for the titans homecoming week, the game against Groveton and a few more secrets are revealed with a climatic ending! Thanks for reading! Peace out![Chapter 14] Hello people of the world! A big thank you to my wonderfully magnificent reviewers, I love you all to pieces! On to our next chapter, let's see what kind of action we can drag up in the world of high school football! Disclaimer: I still own nothing…le sigh… New York, New York 1989 After the girls found out about Ray, they had been on me day and night. Every time he even looked at me, one of them would beg me to tell someone, but I always refused to. Besides, since it was homecoming week the football team had to make some appearances to boost school spirit, meaning Ray was preoccupied. We were all hoping that by the end of the week, he would find a new play mate. As for the football team, nothing seemed to have changed. I was wondering if my little chat with Gerry did anything at all, and I found myself getting extremely frustrated. Monday had passed with no difference in their attitudes, but surprisingly enough the dynamic had changed come Tuesday… Alexandria, Virginia 1971 I was currently coming out of a particularly horrid Spanish class, silently fuming at the grade I had received on my first vocabulary test. Looking down at the sheet with a big C+ on it, I sighed and angrily stuffed the offending paper in my bag before turning back to the conversation Susan and I were having. \"I don't see what you're so upset about; a C+ isn't that bad.\" Of course she wouldn't think so, she got an A-. \"I never get C's! Even in math I manage to pull off a B\" I grumbled as we headed towards the stairwell. \"Besides, I studied really hard for this...\" We started up the stairs only to be stopped half way to the top by a group of girls crowded around the window. Looking out to see what they were all staring at, I rolled my eyes seeing Sunshine doing his Tai-Chi in the quad. All of the girls in this school have been going crazy over the boy since he moved here, calling him a 'Californian dreamboat'. Sure the guy was cute I suppose, and as sweet as can be; but he's not exactly my type. \"Watcha all looking at ole Sunshine for?\" A voice I immediately characterized as Petey's asked from behind us. I scoffed at the boys poor attempt to flirt with the girls, and smiled to myself after noticing the slight blush that now adorned Susan's cheeks. It was so cute how she was crushing over him when he was so oblivious, yet really depressing. I knew it would be a long time yet till something like that would be completely accepted here, look at my parents for example. Daddy had told me how hard it was for people to accept their relationship. I had tuned out most of Petey's attempted pick up lines and continued up the stairs, noticing how Susan's blush heightened when he gave her a nod in recognition. Petey had fallen a few paces behind us, still going on about being the star of the field when the hall got deathly quiet before a bang reverberated down the hall followed by a hiss of pain. We whipped around to see Petey pinned to a row of lockers by a few white boys, and then all hell broke loose. A few black kids pushed past us and joined in the fray to pull them off, causing a few more white boys to jump in. I notice that Gerry was on the other side and managed to pull the guys off Petey while trying to break it up before he was slammed against some lockers and hit hard enough to split his lip. I started to panic until Julius ran up behind us, pushing me back before going in and grabbing the guy who had Gerry pinned. I faintly heard Gerry yell out for Petey to get the girls out of the hall when he broke out of the mess, vaguely recalling him pulling at my arm before jerking it out of his grasp. I couldn't leave when my cousin was in the middle of a race riot; I needed to make sure he was going to be ok. He managed to usher most of the kids down the hall and returned to try and pull me back to where Susan was waiting down the hall, but by that time Julius had managed to get the black guys backed against a locker, keeping them at bay while Gerry did the same to the white boys. He stood by my side, hands on my arms to pull me back should it get out of hand again, releasing me only after both groups stalked off in opposite directions. Gerry and Julius both stood in the middle of the hall just staring each other down before giving a slight nod towards the other. Petey made his way over, thanking them for the help while Susan came and lightly grabbed at my elbow; the worry just starting to fade from her face. Petey left for class after throwing a wave back towards us, the two boys turning to face each other once again. \"I should get to class…\" Susan mentioned from her spot by my side. \"Me too\" I said, attempting to give the boys a few moments before class. I split up with Susan in the next hallway, smiling slightly to myself as I entered History, maybe there was hope for those two yet and if they could get over themselves then maybe the rest of the team could too. After a quick hello to coach I made my way back to my seat to a surprised Louie. \"Well you seem in a better mood today\" he laughed as I plopped down in my seat. \"What do you mean?\" \"Annie I've practically had to drag you out of the house for the past week\" he smirked. I narrowed my eyes and stuck out my tongue at him, I didn't think I had been that bad after all. A few minutes after I arrived, Julius and Gerry both came walking into class. I'm not sure what was said between the two in the halls, nor did I ever bother to ask, but the two seemed much more amiable then they had in the past two weeks. Julius was actually smiling for starters. Forty minutes and a lecture later, I found myself standing with the boys before my next class, fussing over the cut in Gerry's lip and the bruise that had begun to darken over Julius's jaw. Blue was snickering with Louie at how I was babying the two of them, and both Gerry and Julius were slightly embarrassed at my antics. \"For Christ's sake Annie, it's fine just leave it!\" Julius complained, slapping away my hand once again as I tried to see how bad it was. \"Fine my ass, if it was fine you wouldn't wince every time I touched it\" I replied, trying to move his face once again so I could see it properly before he shoved my arm away. \"Then maybe you shouldn't touch it.\" I narrowed my eyes and turned towards Gerry who insisted he was alright. \"You both are morons, you could've gotten really hurt\" I muttered, ignoring the 'yes mother' comment from my adoring cousin. I finally left them be, retreating to physics class while waving to acknowledge that I heard their request for me to meet them by the gym at the end of the day. Lunch finally rolled around and the girls and I bypassed the boys table that grew emptier each day, going straight to our spot under the tree. Susan began digging through her bag as soon as we sat down, looking for something that had her jumping off the walls since Physics. Pulling out a folded and slightly crumpled piece of paper, she smoothed it out before handing it over to us. I recognized it as one of the fliers the cheerleading squad had posted for new recruits. Apparently a few of the girls had dropped out due to the integration and now they had a few spots opened that needed to be filled. \"This is your chance Brenda! The try outs are this afternoon, and you know a lot of the cheers and routines already.\" She rushed out, her eyes glazed over with a determined sheen. She was right; Brenda did know most of the cheers and would often do them in the stands those first two games. As for the routine, she had mentioned how she had to memorize it for the previous auditions that she always backed out on. \"This might work to our advantage\" I agreed, looking at the sheet from over her shoulders. \"If people are dropping off the team because of this then I can imagine that not too many people will try out.\" I looked from Susan to Brenda, trying to boost up her confidence enough to agree to try out. \"Yeah and since you know the cheers and routine already I'm sure you could get a spot no problem!\" \"I don't know… I've never really done a sports thing before\" she sighed and started to pull at the ends of her hair. \"Oh come on, it's not like you have anything else going on\" I countered, supported by Susan's nod of agreement. \"After all, the football team and cheerleaders practice at the same time, and you have to wait for Petey anyway\" \"Plus you already go to all the games…you should at least try out\" Susan finished. \"Alright….I guess, I mean what's the worst that can happen right?\" she asked receiving encouraging nods from us both. \"Will you guys come with me?\" \"I have to meet Ju at the gym after school first, but as soon as that's over I'll come meet you guys\" I replied, pulling both them up as the bell rang. Brenda and I ran up to where Rev was waiting for us before rushing off to our psychology class. I was having quite a bit of trouble concentrating in our next class, even with Brenda kicking the back of my chair whenever I began to drift. My mind was preoccupied with the events of the upcoming week. Homecoming was apparently a really big deal to this school. Everywhere you looked you could see Titan colors and signs hanging in the halls and classrooms. There were pep rallies, spirit days, and even a car bashing scheduled; all leading up to the big game against Groveton and the homecoming dance the following night. It was odd because most schools will choose to go up against a school they know they can beat for their homecoming game, but Groveton was notorious in these parts for playing a mean game with equally mean players. Although I didn't exactly see what the hype of homecoming was about, it was still an interesting week. People got so caught up in the excitement, and the ending dance was a perfect way to wrap it up. I noticed that many people started to pair off already, a lot of the boys rushing to make sure they found a respectable date to escort. I normally wasn't fond of dances and avoided them in my old schools, but now that I had a group to go with I was slightly disappointed that I couldn't attend. My grandparents had called again last night, confirming that they were in fact coming up this weekend, effectively cutting out any chance of me attending. Oh well, not like I had a date to go with anyway… Class came to an end, and surprisingly enough I wasn't really that nervous about English. Ray had completely ignored me yesterday and hadn't at all attempted to talk or confront me today. I was feeling pretty confident that he wouldn't bother me, even though Brenda was still wary of the situation. She told me that I should still tell someone, even if he wasn't bothering me right now; in fact I think either her or Susan mentioned something to Rev and Louie. They kept shooting me concerned looks during class and insisted on walking me to class. That day was no different, and I found my suspicions were correct when Rev pulled me aside before I walked into English. \"Annie are you sure you're ok?\" He asked me, searching my face for any clue that I may be lying. \"I told you I'm fine\" I sighed, leaning back against the locker and rolling my eyes. \"What makes you think I'm not?\" I asked getting slightly upset that no one would trust me. \"Nothing in particular…just something someone said about you acting a bit strange lately\" he replied, rubbing the back of his neck before continuing. \"Louie notices it too, actually a lot of people have noticed it, quite a few of boys were getting worried about you.\" I kept my eyes focused on my shoes, not trusting myself to look up. I never meant for anyone to worry, but I knew that whatever they were feeling now would increase tenfold had they known what my actual problem was. \"I'm sorry, I never meant to worry anyone\" I replied lamely, not really sure what to say at that point. \"But I promise, I really am fine\" and to be honest I assumed I was. I really didn't think that my problems would be problems anymore, Ray wasn't bothering me and Julius and Gerry finally got over themselves. \"Alright Ann\" He said with a slight smile before turning to walk away, stopping and facing me once more before he disappeared down the hall. \"You know you can still talk to me right? You were always able to tell me anything when we little, and I just want to make sure you know you can still do that.\" He smiled once more, slightly sadder this time, before rushing off to make it to class. I sighed and pushed myself off the locker before retreating to my seat in the back of class, slightly relieved to find Ray had yet to arrive. I figured that some people who knew me well enough would realize something was a little off with me, but I guess my acting skills weren't as up to par as I presumed. Looking up to the front of the room, I noticed that Ray had arrived and I did all I could to avoid both him and Brenda. She kept telling me that even though he wasn't bothering me that I should still tell someone, just in case something happens, but I kept insisting that it would be fine. I kept my eyes on the board until a note on the corner of my desk managed to capture my attention. The smart thing to do would have been to ignore it all together, but unfortunately I don't always do the smart thing. Reaching forward I slowly opened the note, curiosity finally getting the best of me even though I had an inclining of who it was from. I glanced at the short note and noticed Ray's withering gaze had fixed on me, confirming my suspicion that it was indeed from him. Go to homecoming with me I wasn't sure if it was meant to be a request or a command, but either way I had no intention of accompanying him to anything. I rolled my eyes and crumpled the note in my fist, tossing it to the floor in an attempt to prove that I wasn't as afraid of him as I was. I kept my eyes locked on the blackboard for the rest of the period, afraid that if I looked anywhere but forward he would catch my gaze again and I was afraid of what I'd see. I was up and out of my seat, bolting out the door and down the hall as soon as the bell rang; ignoring Brenda's pleas for me to slow down. I skidded around a corner and tried to stop before I collided into Alan who was retrieving a book from his locker before class. \"Whoa, you ok there Annie?\" he asked, grabbing my shoulders to steady me before I fell to the floor. I notice Brenda had rounded the corner and was headed towards us and I had to act quickly to try to get to her before she got to us. I had no doubt that if she starting questioning me about my behavior in class then it wouldn't be long till Alan caught wind of the problem, and once he figured it out the entire football team would surly know. \"Yeah I'm fine, just hit a slick spot\" I assured him, accompanied with what I hoped to be a confidant smile in attempts to get rid of him. \"I'll see you in class, yeah?\" With that I removed myself from his grip and moved over to where Brenda was, pulling her down an adjacent hall and away from the prying eyes of the boys in my math class. \"Alright what happened?\" she demanded fixing me with a hard glare. I didn't want to admit that Ray had been bothering me, but I couldn't lie to her, she would realize it. \"It's really not that big of a deal, I just really had to get out of there\" \"Not a big deal huh? So what then was the cause of you bolting out of the classroom like a bat outta hell?\" \"It's really not as bad as it seems, he just kinda…asked me to homecoming\" I sighed, slumping against the locker. She looked at me with wide eyes before grabbing my arm and leading back down the hallways we came. \"Alright, enough of this. You're going to tell Julius right now\" \"NO! No, no, no, it's not a big deal. Besides it was just a question\" I explained, pulling my arm from her grip. \"I promise that if he tries something again I'll tell someone before the dance, but please just let me handle it.\" She stopped for a moment before sighing heavily and fixing me with another hard set glare. \"You'll tell someone before that, if he tries anything else tell one of the boys before the game on Friday, deal?' she compromised. It didn't seem fair to me to end up unloading all my problems on one of the boys about their own teammate and right before one of the hardest games in the season, but I either agree with her deal or she would end up saying something herself. I finally agreed, making her swear she wouldn't tell anyone; even though I had my suspicions she already had. I ran to math and slid through the door just as the bell rang, keeping my eyes low and trained on either my notebook or the board throughout the entire class. The torturous forty minutes of class ticked by and finally we began packing up. I was slowly gathering my bag, looking up only when Louie's shadow fell across my desk. He took my books for me and we both made our way to the gym, most of the other guys running ahead, including Alan and Rev, only after Louie said he needed to speak with me. I was getting slightly concerned at the dark and concerned look that now clouded his face. \"Louie are you alright?\" I asked, gently touching his arm to try to get his attention. \"Yeah I'm fine\" he mumbled before turning to look at me. \"But you're not\" I kept my eyes on my shoes; sure he would continue without any prompting from me. \"Annie, you're one of the best friends I have, and with that comes the ability to know when something's wrong with you; just like I know that whatever you're hiding must be serious if you think you can't talk to anyone about it\" He finished looking down to gage my reaction. I began hating myself more and more for lying to everyone and hating Ray for making me; but there wasn't much I could do about it. It wasn't anything they could resolve, and to be honest I was slightly afraid to do so. If I told someone and they confronted Ray, his already aggressive personality could grow worse and I didn't want to see what he was capable of. \"I know you guys have been worried, and I'm so sorry if it seems like I've been keeping secrets from you guys but I promise everything is alright\" I did my best to sound as convincing and confident as I could, quickly switching my answer after the sigh of disbelief I received. \"I promise Lou, I can handle it, this isn't something that anyone else can take care of anyway.\" He stopped just short of the door to the gym, giving me one last look before pulling me into a hug. \"Alright, just remember you can come to us when you need help.\" He followed me into the gym and handed me back my books before heading over to Jerry while I made my way over to Julius. It seemed as though the entire team was here, although the coaches where nowhere in sight. \"Hey Ju, what's going on?\" I asked, reaching his side while looking around the gym. \"It's sort of an unofficial-official team meeting. We have a few things to deal with\" \"Oh, hey if this is a team thing I should probably go.\" Besides I had to make sure I made it to Brenda's audition in time. \"Don't be ridiculous, you're the main reason we're having this meeting in the first place\" I looked up at him and he threw his arm around my shoulders, turning me around so that we were heading towards where Gerry was standing with a few guys. \"After all, you were the one to corner big bad Bertier to make him see the light of day.\" I guess he found out about our little chat after all, at least it actually did some good. He pulled me into a quick hug and smiled down at me, the unspoken gratitude clear in his face. \"I can't tell you how glad I am ya'll are going to work this out, but I really do have somewhere to be\" I told him, ducking out from under his arm and placing a quick kiss to his cheek before heading towards the doors, mouthing a quick 'thank you' to Gerry while lightly squeezing his forearm in passing. Looking back over my shoulder to wave a goodbye, I noticed Ray sitting in the bleachers and sending my cousin a glare that could kill, moving his cold eyes to me only once before returning to his target. I kept my head down after that and had to force myself to walk and not run to the nearest exit, unless I wanted to explain why I was suddenly so panicked. Picking up my pace to an easy jog, I made my way out to the field and into the bleachers where Susan sat; pausing only to shoot our friend a quick thumbs up. Waiting for Brenda to begin her performance I sat in silence, only half listening to Susan prattle on about some equation in math class that had her stumped. I was worried at what Ray would do, he looked pretty upset at Julius which brought me to my next point; why? All at once the pieces of my muddled brain fell into place providing an answer to my problem. Ray didn't like his colored teammates, and since he didn't know Julius and I were related, I had a pretty good guess that he didn't know I was half black. If he found out somehow, then this little infatuation he has with me would die out fast. I couldn't believe it took me that long to figure it out, but at least I had a plan now of what I could do. I was reasonably sociable for the next hour or so, or more than I had been anyways. I was feeling a lot better, if not nervous about my decision but I pushed it back and focused on Brenda's performance. It was as close to perfect as it got and I was honestly surprised at how well she managed to perform the flips and twists without so much as wobbling. We assured her that she had been flawless and that the spot was as good as hers, but never the less I had no doubt that we would all be crowding the announcement board the next morning, just to double check… The rest of the week had flown by, leaving us trying to catch our breath that Friday afternoon. It was currently lunch time and the lunch room was buzzing with excitement for the big game and dance this weekend. Things had drastically improved after the team meeting and now our lunch tables had filled to the brim, Brenda and I even managed to convince Susan to come and join us. It was amazing how quickly she took to the boys and it wasn't long till she was going at it with Petey and Blue, all in fun of course, but I knew she was enjoying all the attention she was getting from Petey. Brenda had made the cheerleading squad just as suspected and now spent the time during the boys' football practice out on the field rehearsing with the squad. She seemed to be happy with it and she's good enough to perform for the game on Friday, although she hasn't rehearsed enough to join in during the halftime. Meanwhile, the boys bond was as strong as ever after that meeting. I guess all they needed was that kick to get them back to where they were at camp. I'm not sure if they realized it or not, but slowly the entire school was starting to change thanks to them. Small things have begun to change, less ignorant comments, fewer fights, and the borders in the classes have slowly started to dissipate. Sure, there still are those here who refuse to get along, but if anything it's a start in the right direction. The cheer of this week has even managed to lift my spirits. With everyone preoccupied with other things leading up to the game, I was bothered less and less and had a chance to iron out the details of my plan to handle Ray. We had a shortened day today because of the pep assembly and the car bashing, so I decided to set my plan in motion on Monday to avoid any possible problems. Unfortunately for me, the fates decided I wasn't going to get the luxury of waiting till then. I had left a few minutes early to get a homework assignment out of my locker, only to have the door slammed shut. I jumped back slightly and glared up at Ray who took a quick step forward to block my locker. \"So you never answered my note\" he drawled out, leaning defiantly against the door, totally blocking me from the homework that still needed to be retrieved. \"You gonna go to homecoming with me or not?\" By now the bell had rung, and the few people around us had stopped their conversation and taken up watching us instead. I hated that stupid look he had on, so cocky and arrogant. \"Just move\" I gritted out, trying desperately to control my temper. My eyes took on a look of hard steel as I stared him down, not daring to be the first one to blink. A look of annoyance flashed over his face just before he replaced it with one befitting a choir boy, a look that probably helped win his case in the past. \"Aw, come on now. That's no way of treating a guy just asking for a date\" he whispered, running his fingers up my arm before I jerk it out of his touch. I glance behind his shoulder and noticed Alan and Rev where heading down the halls, though neither had caught sight of me yet. \"Yeah well, I believe I already answered your questions several times, NO.\" I replied, turning my eyes back to his. \"Now Move.\" I make to push past him but he grabbed my arm and pushed me back against the locker, his eyes have a dangerous glint to them that match his tightening grip but his voice is all honey, trying to seem like the good guy for all the onlookers. I have to stop myself from gasping when he squeezes a bit too tight on the currently healing bruise he left me before. I try to find the right words to make him let me go but panic has overtaken my brain. I flick my eyes back over his shoulder, desperate for Alan or Rev to see me but they had been stopped by Julius and Gerry in the halls and were still a good distance from us. \"Seriously I don't get you\" he started, forcing me to put my eyes back on him. \"Do you know what the people here think of you? Hanging around with the likes of them is giving you a bad reputation, I'm trying to help.\" I looked up one more time and finally met Alan's eyes, hoping that the panic was apparent in mine. He grabbed Gerry and started over, Julius speeding ahead towards us. Ray's grip on me was tightening and I hissed in pain, blurting out the first thing that came to mind to get him to let go. \"I just don't think my cousin would like me dating his teammates, Julius is kind of weird about that\" I rush out; silently pleding that he would let go. His grip was becoming increasingly more painful and fear had a tight hold around my heart. The area around us got deadly quite, I probably shouldn't have said that so loud. A quite buzz started up almost immediately and flowed through the halls, no doubt in my mind about what the conversation topic was. I turned my attention back to Ray, watching the emotions play out across his features. \"Wait, Julius is your….cousin?\" His grip was slowly starting to loosen and Gerry had managed to slow Julius down a bit, trying to cool him out before he killed the boy. \"Yeah my mom was his mom's sister\" I rush out, trying to put on as innocent of a face as I could muster. \"So you're…\" he died out before he could finish his thought but when the look of disgust and realization passed over his face I knew he understood. He released me roughly, shoving me back against the locker once more and was about to say something when Julius cut in. \"What the hell is going on here?\" If looks could kill than ray would be six feet under after enduring the withering glare my cousin was sending him. Gerry was standing between Julius and Ray, a warning hand on his arm should his temper flair. I slipped past ray and compling with Julius's request to go wait by Rev, his fierce gaze still locked on Ray. I made my way down the hall, past the looks and whispers of those who now knew my secret, and threw myself into his arms for a welcome hug. I looked up, trying to control the tears that were threatening to fall only to be wrapped up in Revs arms once again before he lead me down the hall. I don't know why he scared me so much this time, but I had a feeling that if Julius hadn't stepped in he would've taken it further. Rev began leading me down the hall to psychology, keeping himself between me and the boys when we passed them in the halls. I looked over to see Ray giving a two of us a look that had me shriking behind Jerry when we passed them, causing him to slip an arm around my shoulders to usher me along. I managed to catch pieces of their conversation in passing, and distinctly heard the phrase 'stay away from her' muttered in heated tones between the two. \"Annie you should've told us\" Rev muttered once we had managed to get away from the prying eyes, standing in front of where I was leaning against a locker to calm my nerves. \"It wasn't really a big deal, nothing serious\" I tried to explain quietly. I tensed up hearing footsteps coming up to us, sighing in relief when Julius, Gerry, and Alan appeared around the corner. My cousin pulled me into a hug as soon as he got to us, shaking his head and starting to say something before letting it go and taking another route. \"You ok?\" he asked quietly, nudging me slightly. The 'yeah I'm fine' died on my lips instantly. I kept going back to the look of absolute disgust on Ray's face mixed with an amount of anger I didn't know was possible when he found out I was half black. Plus a lot of people just heard my new revelation and a few of them seemed just as shocked as Ray. Even with the school becoming more accepting, it was still only the beginning. There was still more racism roaming through these halls then there should ever be. Maybe it wasn't such a good idea to inform people that I was bi-racial just yet. \"No…I think I just did something really stupid…\"I muttered, fresh tears springing to my eyes before I sniffled and threw myself back into his arms. AN: Hurray it's finally here! Let me tell you guys, I had the worst case of writers block when trying to finish it, but I got it done. So Annie secret is officially out to the school and now the boys know what's been going on. This can only mean one thing, even more drama to come with the next chapter! Next time we get to see the game against Groveton, the homecoming weekend, vandalism and all sorts of excitement! Love ya'll![Chapter 15] Hello everyone! Can I just say how much I completely love the tidal wave of new Remember the Titans stories that are on here now? If you haven't read them, go do so! I've been reading them all and so far they all are extremely promising. Anyway, thank you to those who reviewed, I hope to see a lot more now that we are getting to the really good part of the story. Let's see what kind of drama we can drag up this week! Disclaimer: I still own nothing… le sigh… New York, New York 1989 After my mini break down in the hallway Julius had suggested that I call my dad to see if he would come get me, he didn't think it was a good idea for me to stay since my secret had spilled out. I didn't really want to run from it, but at the same time I was more willing to go home and freak out rather than stay there. Alexandria, Virginia 1971 Julius decided to skip his sixth period class and sat in the office with me until my dad came, even when I told him I'd be fine if he went to class. He even offered to skip the pep rally at the end of the day to come hang out with me but I wouldn't let him. It was my problem and I refused to keep dragging him into my issues. Besides, the pep assembly and car bashing were big team things and I wasn't about to let him miss all that just because of me. I knew why he was offering though; he was trying to protect me. After the incident in the hallway, the news of my ethnicity spread and before long it seemed like everyone knew. The looks and racial slurs that I was now entitled to stung worse than the bruises I had been trying to hide, and Julius was attempting to keep as much of it away from me as possible. A part of my mind realized that come Monday, Julius wouldn't be able to follow me around to keep the nasties away; but right then and there, I was more than content to ignore the outside world for the safety net my cousin provided. My dad was there within ten minutes to take me home where I promptly barricaded myself in room and sat curled up against my headboard. My dad was outside my room, almost begging for me to open the door and talk to him but I couldn't bring myself to do so. I didn't know what I could say to anyone at that point. This whole idea was stupid and if I would've just sucked up my pride and asked for help it might've gone so much better. I was mad at Ray for forcing me into this situation and furious that he had been able to scare me. I was guilty that I had pulled Julius into this whole mess. I was ashamed and embarrassed that I had broken down like I had, but most of all I was angry at myself for allowing this situation to go this far. I had finally let my dad in after I calmed down, and sat with my head in his lap after I retold the events of my day; hesitating only once while choosing whether or not to explain what was going on with Ray. I decided to tell him an edited version of the story, explaining that a boy in school wouldn't stop bothering me and was starting to scare me, which led to my plan of letting slip my ethnicity that happened to backfire. I could tell he was upset that I hadn't told anyone about my problem, but it was better than if he knew everything that had actually occurred between Ray and I. \"I'm so sorry this happened honey\" he sighed while patting my shoulder. \"I had hoped that you wouldn't have to go through all of this so soon.\" \"It was bound to happen eventually, that kind of secret isn't the easiest to keep after all\" I replied, sitting up and leaning against the wall. \"Your right, it was going to have to happen sooner or later.\" He started while standing up and smiling at the picture that was framed on my dresser of me and my mother. \"Well, now that it has I guess we're going to have to find a way to deal with it.\" \"I don't want to deal with it. It's not me that has the problem; it's everyone else in this god forsaken town!\" I exclaimed, lying back on my bed before running a hand over my face. \"As much as I agree with you, we still have to figure out what to do about this, after all this isn't something you can run from.\" \"I don't want to run; I'm tired of trying to be who I'm not. I just want to be me for once.\" I explained. \"I can't win if everyone is against me though\" \"Everyone is not against you; you have me, Louis, your cousin and the boys, plus Susan and Brenda. The only way you can lose is if you don't try to make a difference.\" \"What exactly am I supposed to do might I ask?\" I replied from where I was currently hiding under my pillow. \"Show them that they can't stop you. Go to the game tonight-\" \"Ha! Yeah cause I'm going to go to that after what happened.\" I replied cutting him of sharply. There was no way in hell I was going within ten feet of that school for the next two days. \"Annie you said it yourself, you're tired of running. Don't let them keep you from where you're supposed to be.\" I really hated it when he took what I said and twisted it to make me do what I didn't want to. \"But what about Grandma and Grandpa, aren't they coming out this weekend?\" I was grasping at this point, and to be honest I would probably be looking forward to Monday after a weekend with them but anything to get me out of tonight would work. \"I already called them and explained we had some issues to deal with, they weren't happy but they agreed to come some other time.\" Damn! The one time I actually need them to be here they decide to not come… figures. \"Alright fine! I'll go, but I'm not gonna be happy about it!\" I grumbled, trying to hide the sheer panic I actually felt at the prospect of being anywhere near Ray. I looked up to see my dad smiling softly. \"I wouldn't expect anything less.\" He handed me the picture he was holding of me and mom before he started for the door, stopping and turning once he reached the door. \"You remind me so much of her you know, you have the same strength she always had.\" I looked up as he left the room, examining the picture I now held in my hands. I never imagined myself much like my mother, sure I supposed I looked like her but I never thought I had any of her traits, much less her strength… I was still in my room when Julius came over to check up on me after school. I was currently battling with myself on if I really wanted to go to the game tonight or not. I had already talked myself into and back out of going at least a dozen times and I still wasn't sure of my decision. \"Hey Annie, how you feeling?\" Julius asked, knocking slightly on my opened door. I looked over at him and offered him a spot on my bed that wasn't occupied by random books, clothes, or me. \"I'm alright, how was the pep assembly?\" I asked, sitting up to give him more space. \"It was alright, not that impressive…except for when Lou took the door off the car\" I snickered at the mental image of Louie ripping a door off its hinges, fully believing he had the strength to do so. \"Not nearly as exciting as the game tonight's gonna be\" he finished, looking over at me with his patented gaze; the one that screamed 'just try to get out of it'. \"I don't know Ju, I'm not really in the mood to go anywhere tonight.\" It was a lame excuse at best and I knew there was no way in hell Julius would except that answer, but my pride was still keeping me from saying why I really didn't want to go. The truth was I was embarrassed to be around the guys now that they knew my little problem, that and I was still a little scared of Ray. Not for myself at this point; I knew nothing would happen to me with Julius and the guys watching. What I was afraid of was Ray's temper; afraid it would increase now that he had been confronted and someone else would get hurt because of it. \"Maybe…I don't know…\" I stared, folding my legs to my chest in an effort to fold in on myself. \"Maybe I just shouldn't go.\" \"Oh no you don't, there's gonna be none of that tonight. You deserve to be there and we want you there.\" He started, grabbing my bag from the bed before pulling me up and lightly shoving me towards the door. \"I'm not going to let you just sit here because some idiots bothering you. Besides, you really think I'm going to let anything happen you?\" If there is one thing about Julius that I could count on, it would be his ability to tell it how it is. He was never afraid to be blunt with me, even whilst attempting to be my protector. \"It's not me I'm worried about\" I mumbled slightly. \"Plus you're going to be on the field the whole time, there's not really anything you can do about me.\" \"Will you relax, nothing is going to happen, I promise.\" I wanted to believe him so badly, but the knot in my gut was insisting otherwise. \"Plus, Brenda's first game as a cheerleader is tonight and I'm sure she's gonna want her best friend there.\" I hated how it seemed like everyone knew exactly what to say to make my defenses crumble at my feet. I have no idea why I agreed, but nevertheless I found myself arriving at the school nearly fifteen minutes later and herded towards the crowd of footballers near the entrance of the locker room. I slowed considerably, scanning the growing crowd before Julius realized I was no longer beside him, doubling back before grabbing my hand and leading me towards the group waiting for us. I noticed a slight figure I assumed to be Brenda running towards us, having my suspicions proved when she crashed into us and threw her arms around me in a crushing hug. \"Oh my gosh I can't believe you came! I'm so happy you're here!\" she rushed out, refusing to let me go. \"What are you doing here though? I thought with your grandparents and what happened at school-\"she stopped suddenly, looking up with wide eyes afraid she had upset me. \"It's fine… my grandparents decided to not come, and as for the game…well I didn't really have a choice in that matter\" I mumbled, throwing a sharp gaze to Julius who was ushering us towards the locker room. \"Well I'm glad you're here, and I know everyone else will be too. We were all worried about you\" she whispered to me, slipping her arm through mine. I smiled in her direction, though I was still tense as ever at the prospect of being here. I scanned the football players going into the locker room, praying that I wouldn't have to run into Ray. Sunshine spotted us first, shooting me a big smile when we got to our little group. Louie had given me a hug when I got there, whispering that he was glad I decided to come before Petey pushed Brenda out of the way and took her spot by my side and wrapped his arm around my shoulders, receiving a withering glare in return. Coach Boone seemed to appear out of nowhere a few minutes later, informing them it was time to suit up before disappearing into the locker room to prep himself. Since Brenda was already dressed for the game she waited to walk with me to the stands while I sent the boys off, kissing all of them on the cheek for luck; my version of a 'screw you' to all of those who told me I shouldn't be around them. Seeing Alan blush and fumble profusely before being dragged off by Gerry and Sunshine was funny enough to be its own reward though, you would think he would be used to it now that he has a new girlfriend. The others weren't nearly as fun and merely blushed, although Rev did turn quite red and Petey adopted an almost intolerably smug grin. Brenda left me at the gate and ran off to the track to warm up with her squad, providing me with a few glorious minutes to myself. I stopped just inside the entrance, trying to calm my nerves that made a reappearance before going into the bleachers. As much as I would have loved to stay where I was, I still found myself climbing the steps up to the stands; praying that Susan would be there waiting. She had initially been surprised when I called her earlier to let her know my plans to come, but just as promised she was there to meet me at the top, wrapping her arm through mine and leading me to a spot a few steps down from my family. I muscled up as much strength as I could to provide my Aunt and Uncle with a dazzlingly confidant smile, waving off their concerns and insisting I was fine before joining Susan in our row. Looking out to the field and pointing out where Brenda was trying to pump up the fans, shooting her a quick thumbs up and then the game began. Groveton ran out on the field first and I knew automatically I didn't like them. My burst of strong annoyance was short lived however when our boys made their debut. Our mighty Titans quite literally came dancing out onto that field, but were they just dancing? Of course not, they decided it was necessary to sing too. They were surprisingly good and even managed to do a better job of hyping up the crowd then the cheerleaders, but that still didn't stop me from laughing my ass off with Susan. The rest of the crowd was at least trying to be a bit more refined and hid their snickers behind hands with the exception of one particular little girl in the front row who was complaining about them making fools of themselves. I recognized that little mop of unruly blonde hair as the coaches' daughter, finding that she lived up to the description I had been provided with. After the teams little 'performance' the game officially started, and what a battle it was. Groveton was everything I had heard it was and more; including harsh, unforgiving, mean, and a generally tough team to go up against. I wasn't so sure our boys could pull it off after last week's dismal display, but they seemed to have pulled it together. Groveton's offence had been matched with a newfound ferocity by our defense and before long our own offence was taking the field. That was when things went bad… The gnawing feeling in my gut had returned full force, only to be quickly pushed aside by the explanation of nerves as I scanned the field for familiar numbers. I caught Louie's eye before he ran out to the field and waved a quick hello, trying to ignore the uneasiness. The next minute seemed to have taken forever, even though the clock insisted that it all happened in less than sixty seconds. Once the ball was snapped, Groveton's defensive player Kip Tyler had rushed through our lineman and took Rev down…hard. I counted the seconds that went by, gripping Susan's hand while silently praying for him to get up and shake it off. Fifteen seconds had gone by when people began to notice that he had still yet to move. A hushed murmur fell over the stands when Boone and Yoast ran out on the field, a few gasps here and there. I shot out of my seat, tugging Susan after me and ran down to the bottom of the bleachers, pressing myself against the barrier to figure what happened. I saw Rev being led over to the bench where Doc started looking him over before Brenda pushed through the crowd and appeared in front of us. \"What's going on?\" I asked, cranning my neck to try and see over the football players and cursing my shortness. \"Is Jerry alright?\" \"I don't think so…I heard Doc say something about a bone being broke in his wrist.\" She replied, looking past us and up into the stands where Mrs. Harris was gripping Mr. Harris' arm, concern written across their faces. \"Oh no, that'll put him out for the season! Poor Rev….\" Susan stated, standing on her tiptoes to try and see past the protective circle the team had formed around him. He was going to be miserable if he was going to have to sit out so early in the season. I looked up briefly and saw Sunshine run out on the field in Rev's place, confirming that he would in fact not be going back in. After the huddle, our team set up the next play and like before, Groveton's defense had broken through our lineman; but this time they were ready. Sunshine had proved to be quite effective as quarterback and flipped that Kip Tyler bastard on impact, giving him a taste of his own medicine. I couldn't help but to laugh a bit as the smug jerk was taken off the field, silently cheering on Sunshine. Once the teams' laughter simmered down, Julius made his way over, explaining that Rev had indeed broken his wrist but was insisting on staying for the rest of the game before going to the hospital. I guess there had been some debate amongst the team about what happened, some thinking that it wasn't an accident. Apparently Louie had sworn that he audibled the play, yet Ray denied hearing it to explain away his bullshit excuse for a block. Call me crazy, but I was more inclined to believe Louie; that and the fact Ray looked a bit self-satisfied when Rev had actually gotten hurt. We retreated back into the stands once Brenda and Julius had both been called away, frustration and angry rolling off of me in waves. There was no way that what happened was an accident, Ray missed that block on purpose. Someone had gotten hurt because of Ray. My anger had nearly increased tenfold by the time the game ended, but nevertheless the Titans had still claimed another victory. We filled out of the stands, splitting up with my Aunt and Uncle only after I promised repeatedly that I would stay with Julius for the night; that alone took at least fifteen minutes of convincing before they were willing to let me go. I ran to the locker room with Susan right on my heels, insistent upon seeing Jerry before he left for the hospital. A lot of cheering was heard inside and had I been bolder would've gone in if not for the fact Ray was probably still there, but this time it wasn't fear holding me back, instead it was anger. I knew that if I went in now there would be no guarantee that I would leave until Ray had a broken bone of his own. Instead we sank to the floor with our backs against the wall to wait for someone to emerge. Gerry was the first one out of the locker room, walking past us with his hands shoved in his pocket and head down. I looked over to Susan who had a mirrored expression of confusion before I got up and chased after him. I saw him leaning against the wall of the school outside the gym doors and made my way over, stopping a few feet away. \"Gerry?\" I reached out to grab his arm, jumping back when he whipped around in surprise. \"Oh, hey Annie\" He sighed, running a hand through his hair. \"Sorry, I didn't know you were there\" \"You ok Gerry?\" I asked, taking a step closer to see him more clearly. His brow was furrowed and the frown he wore made his face look years older, he looked like he carried the weight of the world right now. \"Yeah I guess I'm alright\" He said, smiling at me before leaning against the wall. \"Just a lot to think about…\" I assumed that he was talking about the Ray situation and immediately felt sorry for the guy, after all Ray had been one of his good friends for years even if he was a loathsome cockroach. \"Well don't hurt yourself; thinking can be dangerous for a footballer.\" I laughed, feeling a bit triumphant at the smile I managed to get out of him. I turned to go before stopping and throwing my arms around his neck in a quick hug before smiling up at him and leaving to go find Rev. Gerry might've been a confusing guy and a bit arrogant, but overall he was a sweet guy with his heart in the right place; someone I was glad to call a friend. Susan had already cornered Rev by the time I got back, a small circle forming around them. I immediately bombarded him, close to tears once I saw the state his wrist was in. I wasn't the only one this time though, Lou looked as though he had been beating himself up over it and I could see Brenda's eyes glistening. \"Rev…\" I started, fading off slightly while gently examining his bandaged wrist. The tears had begin to prick the corners of my eyes, forcing me to attempt to blink them back before the waterworks started again. I felt so bad about what happened; if I wasn't so afraid of Ray then we might've been able to avoid all this. \"Don't you worry about me, I'll be just fine in a week or so\" he promised, turning to give Brenda and Susan a quick hug, both of whom had lost the battle of keeping their tears back. He turned to give me a quick hug, squeezing my hand gently to prove he was ok; it was a trick we did when we were little and we got hurt to show we were going to be ok and not completely break. \"You just get yourself to the doctor man; get that wrist taken care of.\" Sunshine added, slapping a hand on his shoulder. He and Louie left a few minutes later, asking me to walk with them out to the parking lot before going off with Julius and the others. I took his bag from him despite his objections as we made our way to the car, Louie running ahead to pull it around. I guess they drove to the game together so Louie was going to drive him to the hospital and the Harris' were going to meet him there; I also think that Lou was feeling a bit guilty about what happened. \"I know what you're thinking Annie, this isn't your fault though\" Rev started, pulling my arm slightly to make me face him. \"This isn't anyone's fault.\" \"Maybe not directly...\" I muttered, my eyes locked on his bandaged wrist. \"No, not at all\" he insisted, taking the bag from me. \"Don't get too wrapped up into this…what's done is done\" \"How can you be so willing to forgive and forget?\" I asked. I knew I hated Ray right now but Rev, he didn't seem the slightest bit upset or anything at him. \"Because I believe things will get better if people are willing to work past their problems\" he finished, looking up towards the sky and fingering the cross that still and always has hung around his neck. \"What about Ray, you think he's willing to work past his problems?\" I asked, amazed at his undying faith even in the face of so much adversity. \"Ray's another child of God Annie, he's just a bit lost right now\" He looked up once more before smiling and leaving towards his car. I waved as they drove off, slowing making my way back towards my cousin. Maybe Rev was right, but I knew I couldn't forgive as easily as he could. Julius had driven me home early that night; I wasn't in a very celebratory mood after that nights events. I sat up for a while reading with Daddy in his office and was about to go to bed when Louie came knocking on the back door. I slipped out the back, and made my way over to the swing where Louie was waiting. \"So, what's the final verdict?\" I asked, sitting beside him and pushing off to set us swinging gently. \"Well, one bone in the wrist was definitely broken and he won't be throwing anymore for quite a while, but the doctors believed he should only have to be in a cast for a few weeks.\" He answered with a sigh. \"You know it's not your fault right?\" I asked nudging his shoulder, realizing how much of a hypocrite I really was. \"Let me get this straight, it's not any of our faults but it is your fault?\" he countered, deepening my realization that I really should probably avoid giving advice to make people feel better. \"I know, but I can't help it. I would really rather blame Ray but I highly doubt it would make a difference.\" I said while leaning against him. \"To be honest, I'm not too sure there's a whole lot of hope for him either.\" He looked down and gave me a small smile before continuing. \"But that is no reason for us to not try to make the best out of this weekend, your coming to the dance now right?\" \"No, Susan and Brenda have been trying to convince me to go, but I don't think I will.\" They had both called me a while ago and I had been trying to explain to them how it would be impossible for me to just decide to go now. After all I had no dress and no date, two things that were kind of important to have at a high school dance. \"You've got to be kidding me, you have to go\" he said. \"It isn't even an option not to go, it's homecoming after all\" \"Well it's not like I have a dress or a date to go with anyway!\" I exclaimed, trying to prove my point. \"You seriously don't have a date?\" He asked, looking truly surprised \"How is that even possible?\" I shrugged my shoulders and walked over to the edge of the porch to look up at the sky. \"Just go see if someone who you turned down is still free\" he finished, not understand my situation at all. \"Well that's a great idea! Oh wait that's right, no one asked me\" I told him, sarcasm dripping from every word. I looked up at the sky and silently laughed at the irony of the situation. Technically someone did ask me, Ray did after all. And technically I had turned him down, only to be left dateless come the dance. It's times like this when I have to think that God has a sense of humor, either that or settle for the old 'fates a bitch' mantra. \"I find it hard to believe that no one asked you\" \"Well why don't you hold a meeting with the male population at our school and find out why then\" I grumbled, turning around to lean against the railing. \"Well who says you even need a date, I don't have one and I don't think many of the others do either.\" \"You mean other than Petey, Julius, Gerry, Susan, and Brenda?\" I asked with a smirk, turning around briefly. \"Ok, so maybe they have dates but no one else does.\" He finished, coming over to stand by me. \"I'll even be your escort if you want.\" \"That's really sweet Louie, but I couldn't ask you to do that\" I told him, adopting a sly smile before turning and walking back to the swing. \"Besides, if you go with me you would be missing an opportunity to dazzle Melanie Morgan.\" Melanie was a slightly bigger girl who adorned short brunette waves and deep gray eyes. A lot of guys thought she was very pretty including Louie. She was in math with us and though she was very quiet and mostly kept to herself, she was really nice. Louie had his eye on her lately, but no confidence to do anything about it. Good thing I had my own secret too. I had ran into her the week before, and after twenty minutes of coercion and almost getting kicked out of the library for being too loud, she finally admitted to having a bit of a crush on him as well. \"How did you find out, I haven't told anyone?\" he asked, confusion covering his face. \"It's not that hard to figure out Lou, I see the way you look at her\" I laughed, getting up to give him a hug. \"Don't worry, I doubt anyone else knows…including Melanie.\" It was true too, she vehemently denied him having any interest in her. Guess that leaves me to play cupid for the reluctant couple. \"Why didn't you ask her to go to the dance with you?\" \"I doubt she would go with me.\" He said, sighing while he sat down. \"Lou you're an awesome guy, she would be lucky to go with you.\" I said, trying to get him to perk up. \"You should talk to her at the dance tomorrow.\" \"Well what about you? I'd feel bad if you were home alone.\" I seriously didn't understand why no one would listen to me. I genuinely didn't want to go, but no one seemed to grasp that. \"I told you I wasn't planning on going!\" \"Yeah but your reasons were ridiculous.\" Louie laughed, sitting next to me on the steps. \"Just promise me you'll think about going, half of us don't have dates anyway so we can all hang out together.\" \"Who exactly doesn't have a date? And you don't count because I want you to try with Melanie.\" I said, hoping the exasperation and pure annoyance sounded through. \"Ronnie, Rev, Alan, Blue, Petey-\" \"You are so lying!\" I said standing up and smacking him on the arm. \"I know for a fact that Petey had a date, Alan was going with his new girl, and Rev was planning on asking Bethany Smith in psychology.\" I said, narrowing my eyes while crossing my arms and staring him down. \"Not anymore, none of them have dates now.\" He explained, leaning back against the railing. \"What? Since when? Why?\" How did I not know that any of this happened? Except for Ronnie and Blue who both insisted on going stag, they all had dates at the beginning of the week, what changed? \"Well Ronnie and Blue just didn't get one.\" He started, receiving a nod of understanding from me before continuing. \"Rev got turned down, Alan and his girl broke up, and Petey's date canceled on him.\" I was shocked. I had no idea that they all were having these problems, and all the while I was worrying about myself. \"Why? What happened?\" \"Well the girl Rev was going to ask had a date already, Petey's date broke it off after her ex boyfriend asked her back out, and Alan… well his girl broke up him when she figured out he was friends with black people\" He explained, pausing uncomfortably because of the race card. \"Oh my gosh, that's horrible!\" I exclaimed, sinking to the floor while burying my face in my hands. \"How did I miss all that?\" \"You haven't exactly had the easiest week either Annie…\" he explained gently, laying a hand on my shoulder. \"That doesn't matter! Why am I just now hearing this?\" Me having a crappy week was no excuse to be a crappy friend; normally I would've caught on to something being wrong with them; especially Petey and Rev. \"Don't feel too bad Annie, to be honest I doubt they really wanted many people to know to begin with.\" He sighed and nudged me a bit, sending me a smile. \"Really, don't worry about it. But promise me you'll at least think about going to the dance\" I reluctantly agreed to think about it before I walked Louie back to his house before settling on the steps of my porch again, gazing up at the rolling expansions the sky provided. I got lost in those stars a lot lately, wondering how something so perfect and serene could float over a world so troubled. I had begun to quite literally space out, when I felt a blanket adorn my shoulders and the step groan under the weight of another person. I looked over to my father, finally pulling my eyes from the heavens and hoping for him to provide me with an answer to the world's problems. \"When things got tough, I would always try to find the answers in the stars too\" he told me, nudging me slightly before turning his own eyes upward. \"Did they ever give you them?\" I sighed, pulling the blanket tighter around my form once the winds began to pick up. \"Not directly.\" He smiled lightly, wrapping his arms around my shoulders before placing a kiss to my forehead. \"But I knew that with a sky as beautiful as that, there had to be something out there bigger than the problems we have down here. People will figure that out soon enough.\" I stared at my ceiling for a good two hours before I finally gave up, and went to sit on my window seat. I looked out at the sky and tried to get that feeling of bliss and understanding that my father seemed to have grasped by observing the same sky. Looking out towards the clear of the night, a single falling star made its way across the darkened sky. I closed my eyes and wished as hard as I knew how for the town to work past the issues of integration, and more than anything I wished to understand myself. I fell asleep like that, curled up against the window and comforted by the tranquility of the stars. When I awoke the next morning, I knew exactly what I was going to do. Whether or not it was the smart decision for me to make socially, it was one that I was finally making to make me happy rather than everyone else. I quickly dressed and ran past my dad in the kitchen, throwing a quick explanation over my shoulder and a promise to call later before rushing to the shed to grab my bike. I rode the fifteen minutes to my cousin's side of the neighborhood, surpassing my family's house and arriving at modest two story at the end of the block before running up the drive and repeatedly ringing the bell. Brenda answered a minute later, a look of surprise adorning her face. \"If you want me to go tonight, I'm going to need a dress.\" I explained, squeezing past her into the home I knew so well from so many years ago. I barely had time to roll my eyes at her over-eager squeal of excitement before she grabbed my hand and tugged me upstairs, all the while insisting she had the perfect dress for me.
