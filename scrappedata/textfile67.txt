So far nothing was out of the ordinary and no new freaks had come to show their faces and 'prove' how much better they were than his brother Theo. On that thought he made his way towards the track. FAST was at it again performing all their usual stunts. Whiplash being crazy, Smoove Move enjoying the beat of his music as he cruised, Skidmark all hyper, Burn speeding around and White Shadow being... White Shadow. Wait... Where's Theo? Chet scanned the whole track but didn't see any sign of his brother, not even the resting area. That's weird Theo never misses out on racing and I don't recall him being out for anything. \"Hey Boo!\" Chet called out to Burn. Burn looked towards his direction before speeding over to him. \"Hey ya baby, what's up?\" She asked giving him a kiss on the cheek. \"Well nothing unusual... I think, where's Theo? I've never known him to miss out on racing time.\" \"Yeah he's been acting weird, he's been all curled up his shell and not wanting to get out of bed, least that's what Whiplash told me.\" Chet got an odd look on his face. \"Theo actually curling up in his shell is NOT normal... That's concerning, I better go check on him.\" Burn nodded. \"Do your thing Boo, see you later.\" Burn speeded back on to the track as Chet made his way for the little place he and Theo called home. Tito had made them a little house by the tomato plant out of a cracked flower pot. Decoration was left up to Chet and Theo. It was simple and gave Chet memories of home. \"Theo?\" Chet called sticking his head in through the 'door.' \"ACHOO!\" WHAM! Chet jumped as he saw his brother speed on past crashing into a wall. \"Theo!\" Chet rushed over to his brother who was looking a bit more pale than usual. Theo let out a bit of a groan as he looked up at his brother. \"Hey Chet...\" He doesn't sound good either, his voice is all raspy. Chet felt around his brother's head with his eyes. He felt warm. \"Hm… Fever, sneezing, and raspy voice sounds like you're coming done with a cold Theo.\" \"Y-Yeah I n-noticed-ah ah-ACHOO!\" WHAM! Chet winced seeing his brother crash again. \"And seems like you're sneezing it's make you rev around as well.\" \"Yeah… Been trying to fight it all morning… Plus I rev even if I don't sneeze my powers are going haywire…\" Right as he said that the lights in his eyes turned on. \"Oh come on!\" He bit his tongue turning them off. Chet got an overly worried look as he made his way towards his brother. Theo looked at him giving a scared look. He hadn't seen him make an expression like that since the Indy 500. \"Oh Theo come here...\" Chet pulled his brother into a slug hug with his stocks. Theo hugged him back. \"It'll be okay, you got me around after all.\" Theo smiled a little. \"Yeah Mr. Safety never fails to do his job... Save the one time with Ace.\" Chet rolled his eyes chuckling a little. \"Only once and that didn't count because it was rigged.\" \"True...\" Theo coughed a little before curling half way into shell, shivering. Chet made his way over to Theo's bed and grabbed his blanket and draped it over Theo. \"Do you want me to stay here or do you want some time alone?\" \"Could you stay... Please..?\" \"Of course.\" Chet sat next to Theo as he cuddled up to him. \"Thanks Chet…\" \"Hey… What are brothers for right?\" Theo smiled closing his eyes letting sleep take over. Chet nuzzled him a little keeping watch over him. Even if he's the Indy 500 Champion… He's still my little brother.

When suddenly turbo saw the mast beautiful sight he had ever seen. This causes Turbo to crash into a dustbin. The thing he saw was a snail called Rocket. Turbo had fallen in love. Whiplash and burn rushed over to Turbo \"Turbo are you alright\" Burn asked turbo slightly worried about him. \"Yeah sure\" Turbo said dazed. Then Turbo got up and raced towards the beautiful snail and said \"what is your name\".\" my name is rocket, I have come to sea turbo\" Rocket said. \"my name is Turbo or Theo\". \"Right, my boss sent me to tell you and your team that he is challenging you to a race in New York\" rocket said. Turbo thought about it for a while then suddenly turbo said \"wait there I will ask what my team thinks\" \"Whiplash, Burn can you gather the others and meet me back here in ten minutes\" turbo said. Ten minutes later whiplash arrived with smoothmove and skidmark, burn arrived two minutes even later with whiteshadow. \"Right who is ready for a challenge\" said turbo excitedly. Then all at once they shouted \"yeah, go F.A.S.T\". \"Right we will race this boss of yours, oh and who is your boss\". \"it is only speedy the pet of guy gagne\" said rocket confidently. \"ha do you really think that I fill race even though I am going to easily win like I won guy gagne \"turbo said almost in hysterics. \"Wait till you here about the prize, the prize is £100,000. Guy is sponsoring the race and turbo you seem like a nice guy so here is an added bonus. If your team wins I will be your girlfriend. How about it\" rocket said staring at turbo's ridiculous expression on his face. The next day F.A.S.T was on their way to New York in Tito's taco van. On their way Kim was franticly polishing all of the teams racing shells. When F.A.S.T. got to the race track turbo saw for the first time his competition. Speedy was white and he had a jet black and blood red racing shell on with rather large boosters coming off of it. Speedy then went up to turbo and his team and said \"so this is the snail with talent\" \"yes, yes it is. Do you have talent\" whiplash said in a stern voice. \"Shut up, I'm not talking to you in talking to him\" speedy snapped while pointing to turbo who was just staring at rocket with goggling eyes. Then broke out of his trance when he realised that everyone was staring at him \"fine let's get down to business\" turbo said. So rocket led F.A.S.T. to their pit stop. \"Race day is today I can't wait\" burn said excitedly then she turned to her best friend turbo. The moment she looked at him she knew something wasn't right. He was really pale and could hardly Stand up. \"O my gosh turbo are you alright\" burn said concerned about the wellbeing of her friend. \"n no ….I feel ….so …w week and my….. s Shell isn't ….lighting up …when I rev …it\" turbo said very weekly. \"What were you doing last night?\" burn said \"I I ….went to… see …s speedy ….and he…. gave me a leaf…. With… blue …stuff inside …it. He pinned….. me to the ….floor and forced… it down ….my th..roat\" turbo said even more weekly than before [Flashback ,Night before] The phone rang at the F.A.S.T.'s pit stop. Turbo rushed over to pick it up, when he did a dark voice came over the phone line and said \"come see speedy pronto. He wants to speak with you\" the line cut off. Turbo quietly opened the pit stop door careful he didn't wake any of the team, and went to the gagne pit stop to meet with speedy. \"why did you call me here\" turbo said confused. \"Oh I just wanted to wish you luck for tomorrow and to give you a peace offering\" speedy said darkly giving turbo a juicy leaf. Turbo tried to refuse the leaf but speedy pinned him to the ground and forced the leaf into turbos mouth. Turbo realised that the leaf had blue stuff inside of it. Turbo knew what it was, it was snail poison. [End of flashback] Without warning turbo collapsed to the ground with a loud thud. The thud woke up the rest of the team. \"WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED HERE\" whiplash shouted at burn \"yeah burn what happened\" whiteshadow, smoothmove and skidmark said in unison. \"TURBO turbo please wake up for me\" burn started to shout then quieting down to a whisper. getting really worried about the condition of her best friend burn told skidmark to get Tito to come. (By the way the snails can talk to the humans). Tito hurriedly came into the pit stop and when he saw turbo laying on the floor unconscious he said \"lil amigo please wake up, we have a race to win ,you can't do this hours before the race\" \"tito he's not waking up\" burn said between sobs. CHAPTER 2 Six weeks later turbo awoke in a hospital bed at Manhattan hospital. But he couldn't open is eyes or speak because he was too week. Turbo would faintly hear the sobbing of his big brother Chet. Chet said \"Theo, turbo come on you can pull through this, I know you can please.\" \"Mmngh\" turbo groaned trying to speak. \"Theo?\" Chet whispered \"I...it...ngh…Hu… rts...\" turbo tried to say without sounding week but failed. \"what hurts turbo tell me\" Chet said now getting even more worried about his little brother. \"mmngh….my..sto..Mach…and…ngh…my….hea..d\" turbo said before dozing off again. It was 11:30 when turbo woke up and turbo felt much better although he still had pain in his stomach and head but not as much as earlier. Turbo then saw Chet sleeping in the chair next to his bed. \"Ch…et….\" Turbo said barely over a whisper. \"What is it Theo\" Chet said sleepily. \"When do you think I can race again\" Turbo said much more loudly as he was getting exited. \"Theo! Why can't you just slow down. You woke up from a coma 5 hours ago, I wouldn't be surprised if they said a year!\" Chet screamed at turbo a little annoyed that he was trying to push himself too hard after he just woke up from a coma 5 hours ago Just then a doctor knocked on the door and asked if he might come in and speak with Mr Theodor (turbo). Chet said he could come in. \"Mr Theodor, I am dr meiers and I am here to say that we need to run a few more tests before we let you go so you will be out of here in about 2 days\" said dr meiers. \"Oh.. Thank you so…much and… oh doc when can ….I start ra..cing… again\" turbo said drowsily. \"Mr Theodor I think you should just take it easy for a week before even thinking about racing but yes in a week Mr Theodor and you won't be able to race as fast as you usually do because your body is in too much stress of the nitroxide you inhaled so it can't cope with the extreme speeds you go anymore \" the doctor said with high spirits. Just then turbo fell asleep again and all Chet could do was sigh and think of how silly his little brother was. 34 hours later turbo woke up again to find a ruby red snail staring straight over him; it was burn turbos best friend \"about time. Listen turbo we had to do the race, sorry you missed out, anyway we won and rocket said she would like to meet up with you when you come out of hospital\". She said to him in a cheery voice. 2 days later and turbo was released from the hospital with burn although he did feel a little week from being on a bed for 6 weeks solid and not being able to move a muscle. As promised he met with rocket. \"hey look who's back in action\" whiplash said \"whiplash wears rocket\" turbo said weekly \"oh she is in there. And how are you feeling\" whiplash said happily. \"I'm feeling tired and week but over all I am just fine.\" Turbo said with a hint of annoyance in his voice. Turbo went into the building whiplash pointed at. In the far corner of the room he found himself in was no other than rocket. \"R r rocket?\" turbo stuttered he had never been good at speaking to girls other than burn who he has known for 4 years now. Rocket turned around and saw turbo and flung herself into his antennae's. \"oh turbo I am so sorry for what my ex-boss did to you I didn't think he would do that, I'm glad you're alright\" rocket said crying. \"its ok rocket I am here now and nothing can change that for the world. Rocket! Will you take my antennae in marriage\" turbo managed to say without stuttering. \"Oh turbo of course I will. I love you so so much.\" Rocket said almost bursting into tears again For weeks the happy couple have been organising their wedding. Finally the happy couple's day had arrived. 'The wedding of Theodor briefs and rocket son' it said above the entrance to the church. Turbo just stood there in his top hat and bow tie waiting for is beloved bride to be to come down the aisle. Then she came the most beautiful thing turbo had ever seen came down the aisle with flowers on her shell of the colours red and white. The vicar said his prayer and rocket son became rocket briefs. The whole church burst into emotion some were crying some were cheering and some like whiplash just clapped and the couple as turbo and rocket went off into the sunset to start a new life as a couple. CHAPTER 3 One year later the happy couple came to visit starlight plaza for a month with their two children zoom and geek. \"we are back\" turbo shouted across the deserted car park of starlight plaza. Tito then came out of dos bros tacos and came rushing up to turbo and rocket and said \"lil amigo nice to see you again and who are the two amigos behind you\" tito said excitedly. \"This is my daughter zoom and my…um...Son…geek\" turbo said. \"don't hesitate when you say your son's name rocket whispered to him. \"ok Hun \"said turbo slightly embarrassed that he had to call her Hun in front of his friend. Turbo then went off with his kids to show them around starlight plaza and meet his friends. Turbo started to race whiplash when something bad happened. meanwhile \"um, tito zoom likes to race like her farther. And has always dreamed of becoming a super star like her farther as well so I was wondering if you would ask bobby if he could possibly make her a racing shell for her birthday next week\" said rocket. \"Sure I will ask him now\" said tito. Tito went to ask bobby if he could make a racing shell for zoom. When zoom came into the model shop looking for Tito. \"come quickly dad has just collapsed on the floor after racing whiplash at high speeds\" zoom said out of breath. Tito ran quickly to where turbo lay motionless on the floor. \"oh no, what happened to little amigo\" tito said worriedly \"well I was racing him like 'old times' and well he sort of broke the sound barrier and he crashed through the wall, not being able to control himself. I rushed as fast as I could here and found him like this\" whiplash said at a very fast speed. tito examined the damage done to turbos shell, it didn't look pretty. Turbo had a massive hole in his shell, bigger than last lime. Tito hurriedly took turbo to the hospital and their he lay again on the hospital bed unconscious. CHAPTER 4 Turbo was moving very slowly after his accident. His shell hadn't completely healed 2 months after the accident. \"I should have listened to dr meiers after I woke up from my coma\" turbo said disappointed. \"Don't worry farther I am sure it will heal in time\" said his beloved daughter zoom \"Time for bed\" rocket said patiently waiting for ten minutes for her son and daughter to come to bed. She finally lost her patience with them and said rather angrily \"ZOOM, GEEK GET TO BED NOW!\" it had been 2 months since turbos accident and rocket was starting to notice changes to her beloved husband, that included him having very angry out bursts with his children and her. She was worried about him. Turbos p.o.v I keep having nightmares and not getting any sleep. But when I finally doze off geek has to go and blow something up in one of his experiments at 5 in the morning waking me back up and then I can't get back to sleep. This has been happening for 1 month and I think that rocket is starting to notice that I look a bit pale and not with it because she looks at me now like she wants to know what's wrong with me but is too scared to ask me because of my quick temper I am getting. End of p.o.v Next morning turbo woke up to a huge bang coming from the room next to him \"don't worry darling its only geek ding one if his experiments for school again\" rocket said in a comforting tone to try to calm turbo down but it was no use she could feel the heat of her husband as he lay there with his temper rising rapidly. Rocket new she had to get away from him so she wouldn't get hurt in turbos rage. \"SHUT UP GEEK!\" turbo said as he got up out of the bed he hasn't been able to sleep in and stormed to geek's lab/room and smashed all of his test tubes, beakers full of some sort of chemical. And stormed back out and down the stairs turbo herd his son saying sorry farther as turbo just left to see his best friend, burn and tell her about everything that was troubling him Turbo arrived at burns house as he always did on a Saturday morning to get away from his family. \"BURN LET ME IN NOW\" turbo shouted up at her window really really annoyed now. \"Alright alright I'm coming keep your shell on \"burn said sighing at her friends quick temper he was developing. The sound of burns voice just calmed turbo down a great deal. He didn't know but something about her made him calm his temper and go back to normal except not all normal this time turbo was deteriorating fast and burn could see that he hasn't been eating sleeping or drinking for 1 month and it was getting really dangerous for him and she needed to try and get him to eat something. But he always refused. \"come on turbo you need to eat, look at you, you're getting thinner\" burn tried to reason with him. \"ok I will eat something\" turbo said giving in then just at that moment turbo just fainted burn rushed to check his pulse she couldn't get one then she listened to his heart beet there was none. Burn started to cry by his side as turbo layed there motionless for the third time in 2 years but this time he wasn't awaking.

Summary: Random sentences based on the movie and Netflix series. Warnings: slash, some OOCness, dark themes, mature scenes, a bit of angst, hinted crossovers, and mpreg. Envy (1)- The snails from the tomato garden didn't care for speed. But when they saw how much attention and fame the now blazing fast Theo, or Turbo, received they couldn't help but feel envious. Duty (2)-Even before his brother became the world's fastest snail, Chet always had the duty of ensuring his safety, no matter the cost. Boo (3)-It was on Halloween that Burn learned that it wasn't a good idea to pop up from behind Chet, tackle him, and yell her pet name for him. Unless you wanted him to scream like a girl for ten minutes straight. Dough (4)-While snails didn't necessarily need money, the F.A.S.T. members were always excited whenever Turbo brought back a dollar for them to get a bag of Tomato Yums with. Nightmare (5)-The nightmares that consisted of Turbo not surviving the Indy 500 pile-up were the ones that made Chet wake up in a cold sweat that he could never break from. Tough (6)-Whiplash would never admit this to anyone, but he was tough on his team not just to heighten their success but to toughen them up should he ever fail to be there to protect them. Soup (7)-Like how humans enjoyed chicken soup on winter days, Turbo and the F.A.S.T. members loved piping hot tomato soup. Especially Tito's Spicy, Salt-Free Tomato Soup. Denial (8)-Before Turbo showed up, the F.A.S.T. members were in denial about being slow. When they met Turbo well…let's say they were shocked out of that denial. Music (9)-It was a general fact; music was one of the most important things in Smoove Move's life. Mastery (10)- It was obvious who had mastery over what; Turbo over speed, Burn over heat, Smoove Move over music, Skidmark over inventions/the paranormal, Whiplash over skill and strategy, Chet over safety, and White Shadow over food/brawn. Pain (11)-Skidmark couldn't understand why his heart felt like it was tearing in two every time he saw Turbo hanging out with Whiplash. Crave (12)-Burn didn't understand Chet's taste in bananas until she was pregnant and craved them 24/7. Tomato (13)-Tomato Yums, tomato soup, tomacos, heirloom, canned-it didn't matter, as long as it was tomatoes. Realization (14)-When the toy truck carrying a trapped Turbo was speeding towards the tar pits, Whiplash realized how much he cared for the other snail as he zoomed towards the miniature vehicle. Fears (15)-Most people (and snails) didn't realize that Turbo's fear wasn't losing his speed-it was losing the supportive family and friends he had. Evidence (16)-Sightings of sewer mutants, giant alien robots, and intelligent dinosaurs-they were all there! All Skidmark needed was to convince his friends. Soothe (17)-Whenever Whiplash was about to go off on the team, it seemed that only Turbo could calm him down. Undecided (18)-When Skidmark told the others about the cave spider incident, Whiplash didn't know what to feel-shock at the fact that two of his team mates defeated a giant spider or anger at Skidmark for nearly getting Turbo hurt. Favorite (19)-Smoove's quote \"I'm everybody's favorite\" wasn't exactly true. Burn's favorite was Chet and vice versa while Skidmark and Whiplash favored one orange, blue-eyed snail. Understand (20)-Turbo didn't understand why he was always humoring Skidmark and going along with his plans. Maybe it was because he knew what it felt like to be mocked for who you are and how you think. Scent (21)- Whiplash didn't see why Turbo would try to mask his natural scent with that cologne. Personally, he liked the younger snail's natural scent. Color (22)-If colors symbolized things then Whiplash believed that Turbo's orange color signified three aspects of the younger snail-optimistic, unique, and rare. Coffee (23)-After an incident at a coffee house, it became a well-known fact that coffee was Chet's \"courage juice.\" Injury (24)-If you asked Whiplash what was the worse injury he ever saw, he would say; \"Turbo after that Guy jerk smacked him into the wall.\" Naivety (25)-White Shadow's size was intimidating at first but when Turbo saw how naïve the larger snail was, the two of them became good friends. Safety (26)-When Chet found out that he was going to be a father, he stepped up his safety protocols as he childproof their home-and nearly all of Starlight City. Gazing (27)-\"Beautiful, isn't it,\" Turbo breathed to Whiplash as they gazed up at the meteor shower. \"Yeah…beautiful,\" Whiplash replied, no longer looking at the night sky but at the orange snail beside him. Banned (28)-After some disrespectful punks tried to harm the snail inhabitants of Starlight City with Dos Bros salt packets, Tito managed to convince Angelo to stop keeping them in stock. Anger (29)-Whiplash didn't know why he attacked Hardcase so viciously. All he understood that the Tiger Beetle had Turbo in a position that made him see red. Anxiety (30)-The way Chet stressed and paced in the waiting room, one would think he was the one ready to give birth, not Burn. Unspoken (31)- \"Dover? Really?! Idiot!\" Skidmark berated himself for telling Turbo such a useless fact instead of the three words he's wanted to tell the orange snail since Day One. I love you. Precious (32)-No moment was more precious to Chet-not even Turbo's winning the Indy 500-than right now as he held his newly hatched son. Light (33)-Skidmark couldn't help but notice how Turbo's eyes glowed a beautiful luminescent blue in sunlight and moonlight. Unexpected (34)- Whiplash was a smart snail and he was good at guessing. But never did he expect to fall eye stalks over tail for the orange snail he considered a friend and student. Storm (35)-Turbo thought that Whiplash was similar to a rain storm; loud and harsh but also relaxed and solemn. Loyalty (36)-After thinking about the Clamsquatch and ziplining incidents, Skidmark realized how lucky he was to have such loyal friends. Kiss (37)-Turbo didn't know what to expect when Whiplash dragged him behind the clubhouse. He never thought that the purple snail would kiss smack on the lips. But Whiplash was surprised equally when Turbo kissed back. Secret (38)-Turbo and Whiplash knew that the other F.A.S.T. members were going to catch on about their hidden relationship. But that just made the secrecy all the most exciting. Talk (39)- The moment Chet found out about what was going on between his little brother and the purple snail, he took Whiplash into a isolated room and gave him 'the talk.' Actually it was more of a list of threats Chet planned to carry out should Whiplash hurt his baby brother. Father (40)-Whiplash never considered the idea of having kids. But after watching Turbo fawn and coo over Chet and Burn's son, Blaze, he decided that becoming a father wouldn't be so bad. Surprise (41)-\"You were amazing out there today,\" Whiplash complimented as he nuzzled his mate. \"Thank you,\" Turbo cooed. The next words brought the purple snail even more joy; \"I just hope our son or daughter loves racing as much as you and me.\" Guard (42)-Upon learning Turbo was carrying his offspring, Whiplash became intent on guarding his mate. Turbo jokingly gave him the nick name \"Guardian Snail.\" It actually had a nice ring to it. Labor (43)-\"Now I understand why Burn was screaming bloody murder,\" Turbo gritted out as contractions wracked his body painfully. Happiness (44)-Whiplash never felt so much happiness as he watched his and Turbo's son break out of his egg and look up at him with Turbo's pale blue eyes. Danger (45)-When Breakneck broke out of Snail Jail, Whiplash knew that his family was in total danger. Broken (46)-The brotherly bond that use to exist between Whiplash and Breakneck had all but faded over time. But after catching Breakneck hovering menacingly over an injured Turbo and frightened Bullet, Whiplash knew that their broken bond was permanently shattered. Promise (47)-Once he was done reducing his former mentor into a bruised and bloody pulp, Whiplash tenderly comforted his traumatized mate and son. \"I'm right here,\" the purple snail whispered, \"Everything will be okay. I promise.\" And he intended to keep that promise. Tenderness (48)-The F.A.S.T. members weren't known for their tenderness. That took a 180-spin when Blaze and Bullet came into their lives. Completion (49)-Whiplash never felt a stronger sense of completion than right now as he gazed lovingly at a slumbering Turbo and Bullet. Family (50)-Back at the Plant, Chet was the only one Turbo called family. But as he gazed at his team, brother, nephew, mate, and son, he realized how much family he truly had. Author's Note: To be clear, Bullet is the name of Turbo and Whiplash's son. And yes I did get it from the movie. I thought it was a good name and it's the tough and fast name Whiplash would want for his child. Leave respectful comments. Flamers will be ignored. I already mentioned the back button.

In the spirit of the holiday, here's another story featuring our favorite snail couple. Enjoy. Valentine's Day Turbo and the rest of F.A.S.T. were doing some practice laps around the racetrack. It was a very windy day, and Whiplash wanted them all to learn how to handle themselves in intense weather. \"Hey Whiplash!\" Turbo yelled over the strong winds. \"How much longer are we going to do this?\" \"What's the matter, Garden Snail?\" asked Whiplash. \"Is the breeze too much for you? I thought an Indy Champion could take a little wind resistance.\" \"You have force yourself through the wind,\" said Smoove Move. \"You have to let yourself glide with it.\" \"I can handle anything,\" Turbo confidently replied. \"And I know how to handle wind. It's just that we've been doing this for awhile now, and some of us probably have places to be today.\" \"Oh really?\" Whiplash asked, obviously not believing him. \"And what, if you don't mind me asking, were you planning to do?\" \"I'm not talking about me.\" Everyone started to slow down and eventually stop after Turbo said that. \"I'm talking about Burn. You do realize what day it is, right?\" \"Oh, I know!\" White Shadow said excitedly. \"It's Friday.\" \"True,\" Skidmark began. \"But I think Turbo is referring to the fact that it's Valentine's Day. Right?\" \"Exactly,\" answered Turbo. \"And if I know Chet, which I do, he's been planning something special for her.\" \"I haven't seen him all day,\" Burn said. \"He'd better be planning something, or else he's going to experience why I call myself BURN.\" To emphasize her point, Burn started running her shell engine, making huge gusts of fire come out of the back. Suddenly, the fire died down and her shell made a rumbling sound. \"Dang, out of fuel. I'll be right back.\" Burn then went back to the track entrance to refuel her tanks, leaving everyone else to stare at her with bewilderment and fear. \"So,\" began Whiplash to Turbo, \"does you're brother have a death wish or something?\" \"I honestly don't know what's going on with those two,\" replied Turbo. \"It's complicated.\" Everyone was surprised to hear Chet's voice come out of nowhere. He then appeared from around the corner. \"Is she gone?\" \"Yeah,\" Skidmark said. \"For now, at least.\" \"Where have you been all day?\" asked Turbo. Chet went back around the corner and pulled out a rose without its stem. \"I've been picking this.\" \"Whoa,\" Turbo awed. \"That's a pretty rose.\" \"I know,\" said Chet. \"I've been looking all over for the perfect one. It took me forever to cut this thing off. Helicopter blades aren't meant for such tasks. My aerodynamics went haywire. I crashed too many times to count. At one point, I tried gnawing it off.\" Chet held out his tongue. \"It hurt more than you could possibly imagine. Even after I got it down, I then had to figure out how to get it here. Don't ask. I'd rather forget that part.\" \"You really went all out for this,\" Turbo complimented. \"The rose is the key to a woman's heart, baby,\" Smoove Move said. \"As the flower blooms, so does her heart.\" \"That was beautiful, Smoove,\" said White Shadow. \"I hope this isn't all you have planned for the rest of the day,\" warned Turbo. \"I also have a nice dinner planned,\" Chet said. \"Trust me. I've got everything under control.\" As if on cue, a large gust of wind blew by the snails. It was powerful enough to blow the rose up in the air and carry it away. Chet screamed in panic and tried to take after it in his helicopter shell, but the wind just made him crash into the wall. The snails watched as the rose blew out of sight. Whiplash went over to Chet. \"Well, Chet, let me be the first to say, it was nice knowing you.\" Chet just gulped loudly. \"I'm dead.\" \"No, you're not.\" Turbo tried to calm him down. \"We all saw the rose. We'll just explain to Burn what happened. She'll understand.\" The other snails backed away from the brothers. They obviously didn't want to get involved. \"Seriously, guys?\" Turbo asked in disbelief. \"Whiplash, not even you.\" \"I never get in between Burn and her men,\" Whiplash said. \"I'm crazy, but I'm not that crazy.\" \"Fine.\" Turbo turned back to Chet. \"I'll help explain things to her. How bad could she be?\" \"Yeah,\" White Shadow said. \"I'm sure you won't end up like her last boyfriend.\" \"Last boyfriend?\" Chet asked, nervously. \"What happened to her last boyfriend?\" \"Well,\" Whiplash began, \"he was a good guy, and they were good together for a long time. Then they got into an argument. We all gave them some space, and when we came back…\" \"Did she hurt him or something?\" \"Maybe. We don't actually know. No one ever saw or heard from him again. It was like he never existed.\" \"There are plenty of theories as to what happened,\" Skidmark took out a piece of paper from seemingly nowhere. \"There's a chance he left out of fear for his own life. But, someone did say they heard a crunching sound as a truck went by that day. Also, there was a lot of salt missing from Dos Bros after the fight.\" Chet made a big gulp after that last one. \"Okay,\" Turbo said. \"I think that's enough of your conspiracies for now, Skidmark.\" \"Actually,\" Whiplash interrupted. \"That last one was mine.\" \"I always thought that she fed him to the crows,\" added White Shadow. \"That settles it,\" said Chet. \"I'm leaving. Goodbye, everyone. It's been a pleasure.\" \"Chet,\" Turbo said to his brother. \"Stop being ridiculous. Burn cares about you. You know she does. We'll just explain the rose and you two will spend the rest of the day together. Take her through the park or something before you have that dinner you were talking about.\" \"It's a small dinner,\" Chet explained. \"The rose was the main part. She's going to think I forgot Valentine's Day and came up with something really fast and made you come up with some story about a rose that drifted away in the wind and she'll think I don't care and…\" Chet took a big breath from talking so fast. \"Easy, easy,\" Turbo said, trying to calm his brother down. \"You're overreacting again.\" \"But, didn't she say that she was going to burn him alive just a few minutes ago?\" asked White Shadow. \"That's not really helping, Shadow,\" Turbo irritatedly said. \"Think for a second. Is there anything else you can do for Burn? Something that will put her in a good mood, or help her forget about your absence the entire day?\" Chet thought about it for a second, but didn't get much time before Burn came back. \"There you are, Boo,\" she said as soon as she saw Chet. \"Everyone back away slowly,\" Whiplash whispered to everyone else. They all were too afraid not to obey. \"Where have you been all day?\" Burn asked him, a little anger apparent in her voice. \"I've been starting to worry.\" \"Chet's not doing too good right now,\" Turbo tried explaining to her. \"He spent all day trying to get you this rose, and it just blew away a moment ago.\" \"Really?\" asked Burn, having a little trouble believing it. \"I know it sounds kind of odd that it went away a second before you showed up, but…\" \"I'm sorry,\" Chet interrupted his brother. \"I let you down.\" \"What?\" \"I let you down, Burn,\" Chet repeated. \"It's something I promised myself I would never do.\" Everyone became quiet at this point. \"I haven't known you for all that long, but ever since you came into my life, you've messed up my ordered and safe existence in ways that I've never knew were possible. But the thing is, I've never been happier. My life was boring before you came along. I just didn't know it at the time. Since I've been with you, you've given me excitement and thrills that, if given to me by anyone else, I'd hate. But with you, it's different. You make everything seem less scary. With you, I feel like I can take on the world. You mean more to me than anyone. I don't quite know how this started, but I'm happy that it did. I would never want to hurt you, because I… I love you.\" There was silence in the area for a while as everyone took in the words Chet gave to Burn. \"He's quite the romantic, huh?\" Turbo whispered to Whiplash, only to see that he had tears in his eyes. \"Are you crying?\" \"No!\" Whiplash yelled back. \"The wind blew dust in my eyes! I can't help it if that happens!\" \"Oh, Chet,\" Burn said as she moved into close the difference between her and Chet. \"I love you, too.\" She then leans in and gives him a passionate kiss. \"Look I don't care what we do today. Just as long I I'm spending it with you.\" \"Me too,\" Chet agreed. \"Tell you what,\" Burn suggested. \"Why don't we go out looking for that flower of yours?\" \"Really?\" asked Chet. \"You want to spend Valentine's Day randomly searching all over the place for a flower, even though we have no idea where it could've floated off to?\" \"No,\" answered Burn. \"I want to go out searching, with you, alone, where no one else will be.\" \"Oh,\" said Chet as he put two and two together. \"Sure. I'm up for that.\" The two then proceeded to exit the track, side by side. \"Wow,\" Skidmark was the first to comment. \"That was intense.\" \"Your brother sure has a way with the words,\" Smoove Move told Turbo. \"Tell me about it,\" Turbo said. \"I think I finally understand those two. Well, sort of.\" \"I still say he's going to get himself killed,\" said Whiplash. \"I don't think Chet cares,\" said Turbo. \"He seems perfectly happy with the way things are. By the way, Burn's previous boyfriend didn't really disappear, did he? You were all just making that up to scare Chet, right?\" The other snails just laughed as if it were a joke and went off in different directions. Turbo stood there in the center of the track, looking confused. \"That's a no, right?!\" He yelled after them. \"Right?!\" THE END AN: Happy Valentine's Day, everyone!

There needs to be more of these, seriously. Set in a human-verse because I'm still trying to figure out how to write about snails. I also need to learn to write when the muses are talking instead of taking a nap… Also still working on headcanons. Hope you enjoy. ~*~*~*~*SK*~*~*~*~ \"Well this just sucks! I was ready to beat those boys on the track today.\" Burn grumbled to herself as she watched the downpour soak everything and anyone in it, the race track included. She blew a bubble out of frustration and looked around the main garage. It would appear the rest of her crew was MIA at the moment. It was then that the sounds of yelling males filtered to her. \"Come on! Come on! Come on!\" \"Haha! Take that!\" \"White Shadow!\" Following the voices and sounds of some game, the fiery red head found most of her team in their common room, surrounding a game consol. Of course it was some racing game. Turbo was in the lead, followed closely by Whiplash, Skidmark and White Shadow behind them. Smooth Move was in a recliner, earbuds in his ears and off in his own lala land. Suddenly prerecorded cheering and victory music played. \"Oh yeah!\" Their newest and youngest member cheered, \"Fastest human on the planet and the best racer in Mario Kart! Take that!\" \"Oh I don't think so, Garden Snail. You are so going to lose that cocky attitude in the rematch!\" And a new race was started. That's when Burn noticed someone was missing from their odd, dysfunctional and yet endearing family. \"Yo, Where my Boo at?\" She asked, trying to get the attention of the video gaming boys. \"In his office I think.\" Turbo answered, quickly looking over his shoulder at her. \"Thanks.\" Blowing another bubble she started her way down the hall. The boys crying out as something happened followed by a \"White Shadow!\" Huh, big guy must have hit them all with something. The twenty-two year old bluenette signed his name with a flourish and sighed happily as he tucked the form into the folder, adding it the finished pile. There was no better way than to spend a rainy day than catching up on paperwork. Dusting his hands off, Chet leaned back and surveyed his work. Not bad and it was still early. \"Hey Boo~\" Came the sultry voice of his girl from the doorway. \"Hey Sweetie~\" He greeted back, looking over his shoulder at her leaning against the door frame. \"What cha'up to?\" She asked, sauntering into the small yet cozy office. Chet grinned, \"Just finished up some paperwork! And I'm about to file them.\" He got up and took the pile over the file cabinet, \"There haven't been any emergency calls and with no one racing today, I've had a lot a time on my hands.\" Burn huffed and blew another bubble from her gum as she took a seat in Chet's chair, \"Don't remind me…I was lookin' forward to making those boys eat my tires.\" The paramedic chuckled lightly, \"I know. And you will once it stops raining. Say…what are the others up to anyway?\" \"Playing video games.\" \"And you're not joining?\" He would have thought she'd want to beat them in another form. \"Nah. I've known most of them for a long time. Video games get dull after a while.\" Chet chuckled again, \"Try living with someone like that for almost your whole life.\" Hazel eyes rolled as she spun around lazily in the chair, \"I'll take your word, Boo. I still wanted to race today….or at least take a spin on a track.\" The bluenette hummed as he continued to file, \"The track should be good to go tomorrow. Or I suppose if you really wanted to you could head down to the next town and use theirs.\" He didn't see the exasperated look cross the red heads face. She then smirked as she swayed over to her honey. \"Well…I kind of had one in mind…\" She wrapped her arms around his waist, hands lightly tracing designs over his stomach as she leaned up to talk into his ear, \"One I'm still learning…\" Brown eyes blinked, \"Oh… Ooooooh!\" He chuckled deeply and turned around, arms pulling Burn close. \"Well….Why don't you let me finish this filing and we can…go practice.\" Burn smirked as she blew a small bubble in his face, \"I suppose I can wait…But then you're all mine~\" Chet let his hands trace up and down her back, \"Of course, Your Highness~\" The rain was still pouring down on Starlight City hours later. The team had taken a pause on the games and were now simply lazing about. Turbo leaned back over the arm of a couch and sighed roughly, fastest boy alive and he was stuck inside, it was then something occurred to him. \"Hey…Whatever happened to Burn and Chet? Think she found him?\" He asked sitting up. \"It's highly possible,\" Smooth said in that smooth tone of his, \"Bet ya they're probably still in his office.\" \"Probably why he's got that huge desk in there, you know?\" Skidmark pointed out slyly as he chuckled. Whiplash nodded, \"And why that file cabinet of his is bolted down.\" \"Heh, maybe they're taking so long cause she's sharpening his pencil for him?\" Shadow said, smirking widely. \"Wha?\" Turbo muttered as the innuendo almost went over his head, but then it sank in, \"Aaah! You guys! Gross! ….You don't think they would actually do that….do you?\" \"Oh, I donno, Garden Snail, people in a relationship like theirs will do a lot things. Why don't you go check in on them if you don't believe us?\" The blue eyed boy sat for moment before a familiar determined look came onto his face, \"Fine. I will.\" And with that he got up and started marching toward his brother's office. \"How much you wanna bet he'll be scared after this?\" Smooth asked with a smirk. Said office was actually quiet save the soothing sounds of the rain on the windows, the subjects of conversation contently snuggled in the office chair, watching the weather. \"Not bored anymore I take it, Sweetie.\" Chet asked, a certain smugness in his tone. Burn hummed and tucked her head into his neck as her hands trailed lightly up and down his chest, \"You know it, Boo~\" However before anymore could be said a knock filtered though the room, \"Hey, Chet, you in there?\" The blunette groaned and cursed lightly under his breath, head falling back before he answered, \"What do you want, Theo?\" His younger brother groaned, hearing Chet's tone, \"Please tell me you two aren't actually having sex in there?!\" Chet began to sputter as Burn smirked and called out, \"Oh yeah, definitely! Harder, Boo~!\" \"Eww, Eww, Ewwww! Brain bleach! Need brain bleach!\" And with that the blonde zoomed off, hoping to get the sound of the chair squeaking out of his head. \"…Was that really necessary?\" Burn shrugged, \"Nope~ But it was fun~\" ~*~*~*~*SK*~*~*~*~ You can thank my beta for the ending.

A painful, red blur. Theo remembered falling off of a bridge because of a damn semi-truck, and then literally landing right in the middle of a race. Next thing he knew, he was passed out in the middle of a concrete street, baking in the hot sun. But he quickly noticed something was off…he was moving, for instance. When Theo finally gathered his senses, he looked down to find that he was slowly being carried off on the backs of four beetles. \"Ah! Hey, hey, hey! Get outta here! Not dead, not dead!\" Theo exclaimed while jumping off of the beetles, which crawled all over him before reluctantly leaving their meal. Just the thought of the insects made the snail shudder, especially after having crawled all over him. But then the ominous caws of crows circling above alerted the snail of even more danger, so he quickly looked around for a safe way out of the ditch. Luckily, he found a few empty boxes of Chinese food, and took cover under one of them to avoid the hungry eyes of the crows. When Theo finally got back home, he immediately headed into the garage and closely examined his reflection in the hubcap of an old car. \"Alright…I'm ok,\" Theo chuckled and sighed in relief, checking over himself one last time. But out of nowhere, his eyes twitched and flickered on like bright lights, taking him by great surprise. \"Well, that's a tad queer.\" After flashing his lit up eyes all over the garage, Theo wanted to see what would happen if he turned them towards each other; only to immediately regret it when the bright lights burned his eyes. Theo cried in pain and rolled back a bit to shake the pain off, and it seemed to turn off the lights in his eyes as well. But he accidentally bumped into a wall and activated a loud car alarm, so he hysterically started begging the alarms to stop…but his efforts only made it worse, and his eye lights came back on, too. So, after beating his shell against the wall a couple times, Theo finally got the alarms to stop and his lights off, as they deactivated with a little chirp. Theo had no idea what was going on with him and why, but he did not like it. To try and calm down and get back with his usual schedule, Theo headed out to a meeting in the garden, and he arrived just in time for his brother, who was giving the speech, and everyone started clapping their eyes together. Theo sighed and rolled his eyes before joining in, only to suddenly activate another new feature, and his mouth opened wide while playing RUN-D.M.C.'S \"It's Tricky.\" All of the other snails immediately turned their heads in shock and confusion, as the music eventually stopped and Theo's eyes stopped twitching and his mouth closed. But when the commotion was over, Theo looked around and chuckled nervously while shuffling away. But as he retreated out into the front yard to figure this out, the radio-like feature started coming back and played even more random songs. And by the time it finally stop, Theo reached the drive while playing Snoop Dogg's \"Drop it Like it's Hot.\" \"Oh, finally…\" Theo groaned in exhaustion and slithered out onto the concrete, but he turned in fright when he realized that the infamous Shell Crusher was fast approaching. He screamed as a bright red light illuminated from within his shell, and the next thing he knew, he was on the other side of the driveway with a smoking red trail behind him, completely unharmed. Neither Theo nor the Shell Crusher knew what just happened, but the kid was persistent and immediately drove backwards to try and crush him again. But Theo felt his heart racing and a raging fire in his veins, as the swirl in his shell lit up bright red again, and his clumsily skidded across the driveway once more. Both the Shell Crusher and Theo saw what happened this time, and both couldn't believe what they just witnessed. But that only made the child even more persistent to kill the snail, so he glared down at him and drove towards him; though, started to feel another new feeling inside, and that feeling was rage. He didn't notice it at first, but his eyes went from icy blue to blood red, as he grinned evilly and sped off the driveway and into the grass, leading the Shell Crusher towards the fence around the backyard. Theo purposely ran straight into a loose board and knocked it out of place, so that the Shell Crusher could ram his front wheel into the new hole. As the child started to laugh, thinking he finally had the snail where he wanted him, he was proved wrong when Theo slithered down the board and onto the front wheel of his tricycle, and spun the wheel forward with his super speed, sending the tricycle speeding backwards all over the lawn while he remained in one spot on the spinning wheel. And just as Theo planned, he gave the snot-nosed kid a taste of his own medicine, and smashed the tricycle against the doorstep, sending him flying back into the door hard enough to break his arm. But even after the Shell Crusher was taken out and went inside to cry to his mother, the tricycle kept going and Theo quickly lost control, as he was now heading right for the meeting in the tomato garden. Before Theo knew it, most of the snails had tucked and rolled before he crashed the tricycle into the tomato garden, destroying most of its vegetables and even fatally injuring a few snails. \"Whoa…that was…\" Theo breathed in awe, as he safely hopped down from the wheel and grinned maniacally again, \"Awesome.\" \"You're fired!\" Carl exclaimed in anger. \"Oh, I'm fired? Well, guess what, old man! I never wanted this crap job anyway!\" Theo snapped, his eyes still red and flashing to emphasize his point. \"No, c'mon, Theo! I'm sure Carl will let you back in!\" Chet begged and quickly approached their manager. \"Not exactly. When I said 'you', I meant both of you!\" Carl angrily protested and slithered away, glaring daggers back at the brothers. \"Well, that escalated quickly,\" Theo flatly pointed out, which angered his brother even more. \"All my life, I've defended you, covered for you, stood up for you, apologized for you—and this is what I get in return?!\" Chet growled threateningly, unknowingly attracting the attention of a crow perched on the roof, \"What were you thinking?! Did you seriously have ta go and toot your own horn?!\" \"Actually, now that you mention it-.\" \"It was a rhetorical question!\" Out of nowhere, a giant pair of claws swooped down and scooped up Chet, carrying him up into the sky as the helpless snail curled into his shell. \"Hey, drop my brother, you feathered bitch!\" Theo scolded at the top of his lungs, becoming a red blur as he chased after the crow and his brother. And as he followed the crow through the city, he remembered his new ability to incredibly fast. One thing was for sure: Theo was never going slow again. Yeah, we all know how this is gonna end...sorta. So, yes, this is basically a semi-AU where Turbo is infused with red nitrous instead of blue, and turns evil.

I don't own any of the characters in this fanfiction. All rights belong to Dreamworks Midday Nightmares Characters: Turbo and Chet Contains: A midday nap, a nightmare, a beloved one dying, and brotherly comfort (because there isn't enough of it in this world) It was a normal day in Starlight City. The sun was high in the sky, while a cool breeze swirled around. Snail citizens were out and about, mingling with each other. Laughing, smiling, totally oblivious of a small snail withering on a patch of grass at the side of the track in the shade, fast asleep. The gleaming shell with the number five branded onto it shifted as the light orange snail curled himself further inside. If anyone cared to stop long enough to notice the snail hidden in the shade, they would've heard small crying echoing from inside the little shell. Alas, no one noticed. The snail remained on the patch of grass, at the side of the track, hidden in the shade of the bleachers, hidden from prying eyes, hidden from the comfort he desperately needed. *Inside's Turbo's dream* A race around the track was how it started. Turbo was in the lead. His signature blue streaks were flying behind him as he kicked his speed up a notch. The other snails were close behind him as he made his way across the finish line. \"Yes!\" Turbo yelled in triumph. The FAST crew slowed down beside him and congratulated him. \"Not bad out there, garden snail.\" Whiplash said to the small snail. \"But you still got some work to do.\" Turbo sighed and nodded. Suddenly his stomach growled. He blushed at the sound of it and looked sheepishly at his fellow snails. Smoove Move slid his way next to Turbo and looked down, \"You know what that means?\" Turbo perked up at this. \"Tomacos?\" asked Turbo hopefully. \"TOMACOS!\" White Shadow yelled. Everyone cheered and revved up their engines. They made their way to the taco stand when everything went sour. \"So Chet, are you going to get any toppings on your tomaco?\" Turbo teased playfully at his old brother flying in the sky. \"Like bananas?\" Chet huffed and smirked down at him. \"As a matter of fact, I wa-!\" He's answer was cut short as a dark shadow descended upon him. Black feathers swirled around the racers as they stared up in horror. A large crow held Chet in its talons and began its flight back to its nest. Turbo was speeding after him before he even realized it. \"Chet! CHET!\" Screamed Turbo. A swirl of images flashed through Turbo's mind. The plant. Fighting. Crows. Racing through the streets. His brother almost eaten. His brother almost dying. \"No, NO! I've saved you once, I will do it again!\" the super charged snail screamed to himself as he cleared his mind of those horrific thoughts. When the crow landed to enjoy its meal, Turbo saw his opportunity. A clear shot to the beak. That's all it needed. One easy shot and the crow would drop his brother. Turbo was positive he could make it. The crow was just standing on a table, making itself a perfect target. But fate has a strange way of screwing with what people want. Even with the amount of luck Turbo has, eventually, that luck will run dry. Today just happened to be that day. 'Just rev up, fly through the air, and smack that bird in the beak. Not that hard,' thought the young snail. He eyed the beak and jumped. He missed. He missed by an inch. The whole world went in slow-mow as Turbo watched himself pass the crow with his brother dangling in its mouth and land on the opposite side of the table. He turned around in just enough time to see the crow swallow his beloved older brother whole. The next few minutes were a blur. A blur of terrified screams, rage filled yells and black feathers being pounded into the table. Everything disappeared. All that mattered was making sure that crow never ate another snail ever again. Turbo barely felt it when the crew pulled him away from the beaten crow. Nor did he hear their words of comfort and condolence. His mind was a complete blank. Tears started to fall. The reality of the situation finally sank in. 'My brother's dead.' That thought echoed through Turbo's blank mind. No more older brother. No more Chet. No more comfort. No more love. No more family. A mournful scream ripped through the orange snail's throat. \"CHET! CHET!\" Turbo tried to break through the grip of the others, but their hold was too strong. Despite the comforting words given, Turbo still continued to scream for his brother. \"Chet please! Chet, you can't be dead. I'm sorry! Chet! Chet! Chet!\" \"THEO!\" \"Chet?! Chet where are you!?\" Turbo screamed. Chet's voice rang through his head like a blade. \"Calm down garden snail!\" \"Hey Boo, is he gonna be okay?\" \"Maybe so soothing music would help?\" \"It's the aliens! They did this! I knew it!\" \"Why is he crying like that?\" All the new voices were like spears in his head. Turbo clenched his eyes shut, wishing the pain would go away. The world around him disintegrated away, replacing itself with solid black. Turbo cautiously opened his eyes. As he did, a white light appeared. \"Theo you have to wake up! It's just a nightmare! Wake up bro!\" The white light was pulling Turbo into it now. Turbo gave one finally yelp before disappearing into the light. *Out on the race track* Turbo's eye snapped open. He uncurled himself from his shell and was greeted with the sight of the FAST crew; and more importantly, his brother. \"CHET!\" The young speedster screamed and launched himself at his older brother. Chet yelped, \"Whoa, whoa! Theo! What in the wor-\" Chet stopped mid-sentence when he noticed his young brother had started to cry into his chest. \"Theo, are you okay? Come on, what's wrong buddy?\" Chet asked worriedly. It wasn't natural for his younger brother to be crying like this. Turbo was always so positive, so optimistic. Turbo frantically shook his head and started to cry even harder. Words started to spill from his mouth. \"Not dead! You're not dead! Brother. Dead. No! Not dead! My fault! My fault! My fault...\" As Turbo's crying grew, Chet looked over at the shocked expressions of the crew. He could tell they were thinking the same thing he was, 'What in the world happened in that dream?!' Chet gave a desperate glance at Whiplash. Whiplash nodded and turned to Burn, Smoove, Skidmark, and White Shadow. \"Okay, nothing to see here,\" He said and turned back to Chet. \"We'll give you guys some space.\" After they left, Chet was finally able to calm Turbo down. \"Okay, now that you're calm, could you please explain to me what happened?\" Chet asked in a comforting voice. Turbo nodded. With little hiccups in between breaths, Turbo began his story. Chet smiled at the beginning part. 'Of course he would be dreaming about racing.' he thought. He even chuckled a bit when Turbo teased him about his banana obsession. But as the story progressed, his smile soon turned into a concerned frown. \"An...and then I turned around...*hiccup*... and saw you get eaten.\" Turbo was near crying again. Chet pulled him closer to his side. \"Shh… It's okay little brother. It's okay. I'm fine, I'm alive and well. I certainly didn't get eaten.\" Chet comforted. \"I failed you! I failed you Chet!\" Chet's younger brother hiccupped. Turbo hung his head down in shame. He let his only brother get eaten alive by a crow. The guilt was heavy in Turbo's heart. \"Theo, look at me.\" Turbo lifted up his gaze to match his brother's. A kind, knowing smile was on Chet's face. \"You didn't fail me. Theo, if it wasn't for you, I'd probably wouldn't be here right now. Brother, you did save me! Remember when I was actually taken by that crow? Wasn't it you who pushed me out of the way and save me from being eaten.\" \"But… but I-\" \"I don't want to hear it,\" Chet stopped him in mid-sentence. \"Theo, Turbo, it was just a dream. I'm okay. I promise you. You didn't fail me. Nor did you just let me be eaten. From the story you told me, it seems like you tried your hardest to save me. And I'm glad you did. As long as you did your best then you could never disappoint me.\" \"Re...really?\" Turbo asked in a quiet voice. \"Positive,\" Chet replied. The biggest smile appeared on Turbo's face. \"Slug hug!\" he cried as he and his brother hugged. Then a loud rumbling came from Turbo's stomach. \"Ahhh...\" Chet smirked and nudged his little brother. \"Wanna get something to eat?\" Turbo nodded. \"Sure, but how bout we get tomatoes. Just plain tomatoes. No tomacos today.\" \"That seems like a great idea. Should we go get the others?\" Nodding his head, Turbo replied, \"Totally. And Chet?\" Chet looked at his brother. \"What is it?\" \"Thanks. Thanks for all the support.\" Chet could feel a smile appear on his face. \"Anytime, Theo. Anytime.\" With both brothers smiling, they made their way to get the other crew members. So what do you think? Yay? Nay? Anyway, I hope you enjoyed it! There should be more one-shots coming soon! *EDIT: As stated in the description, I've decide to just make this story a one-shot, rather than multiple stories. I haven't been in the Turbo fandom in a while and I'd feel bad if I deleted this. So this seems like the best options. And who knows?

I'm not expected to eat them right?\" \"Oh no no, they aren't good for you Theo, you just need to stack them up.\" \"What's the point in doing that?\" \"Well they have to go somewhere, and we leave it to nature to break them down over time and it'll help the soil as well, it's a big job, plus you're keeping the bad tomatoes away from the younger snails so they don't get sick.\" \"Okay…\" Chet gave him a hug. \"I gotta go now, Carl needs me up there with the others, good luck on your first day Theo.\" Theo hugged back. \"Thanks Chet.\" Chet pulled away and hurried off to his job. Over Ripe Tomato Wrangler… Why don't I like the sound of that…? Theo looked over to the pile of tomatoes that had already been stacked by the last snail who had had the job. (He wasn't around anymore since a crow got him. Poor Bill.) He cringed a little at all the rotting tomatoes. I get the feeling this is the least popular job here at the Plant… Theo sighed looking up. He could see the other snails getting to work on picking fresh tomatoes from their stalks. Some socializing as they worked, others just focusing on task. It was a team effort when it came to harvesting. He knew there were other Over Ripe Tomato Wranglers but they were in different parts of the plant with their own piles, and it was a one mollusk effort when it came to it so he didn't really have anyone to talk to. \"Over ripe!\" Theo looked over to the specially made transport system that was by his post to see an over ripe tomato coming down. There were snails posted along it that were calling out over ripe and pushing the tomato along to keep it rolling. Theo got into position as the tomato came towards him. Okay it'll be easy. Just let it come down, and then push it to the pile. He let it roll towards him before he started pushing against. What came next he didn't expect. He heard an odd noise and the next thing he knew he was covered in rotten tomato juice. \"OH GROSS!\" He quickly made his way out of the tomato shaking the juice off, spitting out any that had gotten in his mouth. \"BLEH!\" \"Welcome to the work force Theo.\" one of the snails on the travel system said snickering. Few of the other snails snickered along with them. Theo grumbled a bit before moving the tomato (or whatever was left of it.) over to the pile. The pattern continued throughout the whole day. Some didn't break, but majority did. He was grateful for when lunch time came around. He swore though that the stench of over ripe tomato was now staining his skin and shell. \"So how's your first day so far?\" Chet had asked. Theo didn't go into the details, but he did say it was hard. Chet told him he would get used to it over time and it would be easier. Theo hoped so since this was the only job he was allowed to do. (Least it was the only job Chet was going to allow Theo to do. He was constantly worrying about his brother's safety.) But over the course of two weeks it wasn't any different. More rotten tomato juice splattering all over him, and just waiting for lunch to come around to get away from it. You know what, I bet that crow was just having mercy on Bill. Theo thought one day after work was over. He was by himself for the night since Chet had to talk with Carl about some safety issues. Theo decided to take a walk around the house that the Plant was located by. Generally he didn't travel far from the Plant since he didn't want to get spotted by humans. But it was night time so they were all in bed by now… well… save one he came across. He was passing by the garage window when he saw a man inside looking at some box with pictures on it. A TV as Theo had heard once from some of the other snails. He peered in trying to see what the man was watching. On the screen he could see cars speeding side by side. He could hear someone talking about what was going. He felt... intrigued by it. He slipped in through the crack in the window to get a better look. He kept in the shadows so the man couldn't see him. He couldn't take his eyes off the screen. Didn't take him long to figure out that it was a race on the screen. What caught his attention was how quickly the cars were moving. It amazed him. He couldn't help but join in the man's cheers or boos when his favorite racer passed a car or fell behind. He had his eyes locked on the man's favorite racer. The car's colors had caught his attention, but now seeing the techniques he couldn't stop watching. Guy Gagne was the racer's name. According to the announcer he was a new leading champion in Indy Car Racing... Whatever that was. Theo didn't care, racing was a word he understood. He loved everything he heard. He was sad and happy when the race ended. He was happy Guy won, but was sad there was nothing else to watch... Well least for that night. After that night he found himself returning to the garage whenever Chet wasn't around. The man he saw in the garage started to appear less and less till it was only Theo showing up. During the times the man had been there Theo learned how to operate the TV and how to put in video tapes. Theo even learned about car mechanics and racing terms. Didn't take long before he found himself in love with racing. \"What is he doing...?\" A snail asked Chet looking down below at Theo. Chet looked to see his brother... Racing a tomato...? \"It's neck and neck!\" Theo cheered as he moved ahead of the rolling tomato. Chet blinked back confusion. He had been noticing that Theo was never near the garden at night, let alone he never seemed to get to bed on time. \"Well no harm in him playing with an over ripe tomato right?\" Chet asked giving a sheepish grin. The snail shook it's head. \"He's supposed to stack them, not race them.\" \"R-Right... I'll talk to him.\" Chet tried later that evening to talk to Theo about his antics, but he wasn't interested. He brushed it off saying he was just goofing around. Chet gave up momentarily hoping it was just a one time deal… But later that night, he noticed his brother sneaking out of their home and towards the garage. \"What is he…?\" Theo quickly made his way through the window turning on the TV and putting a tape in. \"Okay let's see... Ah!\" He quickly paused the tape at the shot of Guy's race car. Theo looked at his own shell and back at the car. \"Hm... can never drive a car... but I can decorate my shell like one.\" Theo grinned as ideas came to him on how to do it. Chet crawled up to the window to see him work. Theo let the video continue as he milled around the table looking at various objects. Chet lost sight of him then saw him reappear with pieces of a crossword puzzles in his mouth. He set them down and disappeared again. Chet heard a loud crashing noise come from the far end of the garage. Chet rushed in looking around. \"Theo?!\" He called out. \"I'm okay!\" Chet looked to the source to see his brother come out a recycling bin with a bottle cap in his head. \"What in the world are you doing?!\" \"Looking for decorations.\" \"For what?\" \"You'll see. Theo made his way back into the recycling bin rummaging through bottles. \"Theo, get out of that bin this minute!\" \"What? Sorry can't hear you!\" \"Theo!\" Theo ignored his brother's calls. He knew eventually he would stop. Chet stopped after a few and left Theo to his schemes. Theo emerged from the bin hauling a gold color bottle cap between his shell and neck. On it was a circle sticker that had a number five on it. He set down the cap and peeled the sticker off using his mouth. \"Perfect.\" he said between his teeth bringing it back to where he left his crossword puzzle pieces. Carefully setting it down he found a few minutes later the jackpot as it were. A tube of superglue... and a q-tip. Bringing both back over he got to work, gripping the middle of the q-tip between his teeth as he covered part of his shell in the glue, before carefully placing the sticker upon it. \"Hehe...Perfect.\" The next morning Chet saw the results of Theo's activities. Theo now had a number five sticker on the front of his shell. On the back he used the pieces of the crossword puzzle to make two race flags. \"What did you do to your shell?!\" \"Decorated it like a race car!\" Chet could feel his right eye twitch. \"Like a WHAT?!\" Theo grinned. \"A race car! Like ones the humans drive in the Indy 500!\" \"... Why?!\" \"Because it's awesome! Oh, and I even have a racing name since Theo isn't going to cut it. From this day forward I shall be known as Turbo!\" \"... You can't be serious.\" Theo grinned. \"I am, now if you'll excuse me, I got practicing to do.\" Theo hurried off leaving Chet baffled. Keep calm Chet... It's probably just a phase... He'll grow out of it. He couldn't have been more wrong...

We have to stop them before it's too late!\" The other FAST crew members looked up from the screen, eyes rolling. \"Skid,\" Whiplash muttered. \"Did you really come in here and interrupt our Laser Pigs game for that? \" Smoove Move blinked. \"Yo, Skid baby, enough with the conspiracies,\" he said in his usual smooth tone. The snails turned back to the smartphone, resuming their game. \"It's true!\" Skidmark protested to his teammates' backs. \"I read it on the Internet!\" \"And that makes it accurate, I suppose.\" Chet mumbled without glancing up. \"Look, Skid,\" Burn turned to the blue snail, her gaze meeting his.\"We don't have time for your wacked-out theories.

Turbo hurried after him, leaving the rest of the crew to resume their game without him. \"Skid, wait!\" Skidmark looked up. \"I suppose you're here to mock me out like everyone else?\" he demanded scathingly. \"What? No!\" Turbo had never heard his friend sound so hurt. \"I just-\" he broke off. He wasn't really sure why he'd rushed after Skidmark without hesitation. He paused for a moment, then realization spread over him. Of course. \"Skid, I know how you feel.\" Turbo began. \"People used to laugh at me all the time.\" Skidmark blinked. \"R...really?\" He knew that some humans had been skeptical about Turbo racing in the Indy 500, but he couldn't imagine the famous, beloved racer being mocked. \"Yep,\" Turbo replied, memories swirling in his mind. \"Even Chet used to think I was crazy for wanting to race.\" \"No kidding?\" Skidmark looked surprised. \"No kidding.\" Turbo confirmed. \"And working at The Plant was the worst. I remember when I got into a pretend race with an overripe tomato,\" he chuckled. \"I thought my co-workers would never let me hear the end of it.\" Skidmark laughed, his hurt seeming to melt away. \"Wow. I never knew you went through the same things I do.\" Turbo nodded. \"I guess that's part of the reason I'm always going along with your crazy plans,\" he teased. \"...And because you don't want to spend the rest of your life as a servant to a colony of vampire worms, right?\" Skidmark asked hopefully.

I've decided to do it on the ChetXBurn couple since it was surprisingly cute at the end and in the Netflix Show. Hope you enjoy and are inspired to make Turbo stories of your own. This movie needs more love, and more FanFiction. Enjoy! Boo So many thoughts were going through Chet's head at the moment. He still couldn't believe it all. His brother, a snail, had gained super speed, convinced all those humans to let him drive with race cars, and just now, he won the Indy 500! He didn't think any of it was possible. A lot of things have been happening to him recently that he previously thought were impossible. He still wasn't sure if it was all really happening. Chet still didn't quite know how Theo, or Turbo as he likes to call himself, got those super powers to begin with, but he was now just happy that his brother was able to achieve his dream. He just hoped Turbo would be okay without his powers if they never came back. Tito was currently carrying Turbo around in his hand, high in the air so everyone in the audience could cheer for him. Bobby was still trying to keep Kim Ly off of Guy, and failing at it. Chet was watching it with the other snails still on the racetrack. They weren't in too much danger of being squished since all the humans around them noticed them come in. After all, they did just see those snails come riding in on crows. \"Now that's what I call an exciting race,\" Whiplash exclaimed. \"That snail's got some moves,\" Smoove Move said. \"White Shadow,\" said White Shadow, again. Everyone else just turned and looked at him. \"Okay,\" Skidmark said, trying to break the awkwardness. \"Anyway, I haven't properly congratulated him yet, so I'm going up to talk with him. Anyone coming with me?\" Everyone else joined him on his way to see Turbo. As the snails slowly slithered their way over to where the trophy was to be presented, Burn made her way over to Chet. \"You know,\" Burn began, \"you were pretty amazing yourself.\" \"What are you talking about?\" asked Chet. \"Come on. You jumped out of a window onto a balloon so you could give a pep talk to your brother. That's pretty cool.\" \"I couldn't just let him sit down there, curled up in his shell. What else was I supposed to do?\" \"And you did all that without a seconds hesitation. Like I said, amazing.\" \"Well,\" Chet started thinking, realizing everything that he did. \"Did you see me go through that pretzel? There was salt everywhere!\" He was starting to get excited. \"I mean, don't get me wrong. That was one of the most terrifying things I've ever done and I hope that I never have to do anything like it ever again, but I'll admit it was pretty cool.\" \"Don't forget when you showed that crow whose boss.\" \"Yeah. No crow's going to mess with me again!\" In his excitement and without thinking, Chet wrapped his eyes around her neck in a snail hug. \"That was amazing!\" Chet then realized what he was doing, became wide eyed, and slowly backed away, red with embarrassment. He didn't know what came over him. Burn just had a sly smile on her face. \"I… uh… I didn't… I mean… uh…\" Chet couldn't stop stuttering. It was as if all logical thoughts exited his brain. The other snails just looked at him with amusement. \"Smooth, man.\" Smoove Move sarcastically said before moving away. The others followed, leaving Chet alone with Burn. Chet looked back at Burn to see she still had that smile on her face. He nervously chuckled. \"I'm uh… I'm going to go join Theo at the trophy.\" As he was going to leave, Burn quickly pecked him on the cheek. Chet stopped in surprise. \"See you later, Boo,\" she said before turning to join the others. \"Boo?\" Chet questioned that pet name again. Although, now that he thought of it, the name didn't sound as ridiculous as before. He kept thinking about it as he made his way over to Turbo, who was now on top of the trophy. \"It does sound kinda cute.\" \"What was that?\" Turbo asked him. \"Wah?\" Chet hadn't realized that he said that out loud. \"Oh, nothing, nothing. Just talking to myself. So, how are you feeling right now?\" \"It's a dream come true,\" replied Turbo. \"I still can't believe it's really happening. I'm an Indy champion! I'm not sure what's going to happen with my powers, but now that I…\" Even as he was talking with his brother, Chet couldn't stop thinking about Burn. The more he thought, the more he realized she wasn't so bad. She was pretty cool, actually. Chat didn't quite know what he was feeling at the moment, but he liked it. Chet didn't know what the future brought for him, but as he looked back on everything that happened, he had no regrets. He loved every part of it. \"Hey, Little Amigo,\" Tito said when he noticed Chet. \"I set your little girlfriend decided to join you.\" Okay, he loved everything except for that.

A/N: I honestly think the Turbo community is too small. So! I will now begin writing Turbo stories. Each chapter is going to be 1 or more K. And each is its own story unless stated otherwise. With that said, here is the main summery... M/S: An alternate time, place or 'world' brought about by a different choice in circumstance made by someone or something. That is one way to bring about an Alternate Dimension. Chapter Summery set in Movie Verse: Chet decided enough was enough. He had made it his job to watch and take care of Theo. But he wasn't about to let himself be dragged down with him...Not anymore. ' Thoughts' \"Speech\" Noises/Unknown An alternate end. Part 1 of 3 Chet POV Chet was of a calm kind of mind, at least… he liked to think so. But this was the last leaf! He just couldn't comprehend how his sweet, shy little brother hand turned into this…this wannabe car fanatic! When had it all started? Chet liked to believe it was because of their father...but, then again…their mother always had liked the 'strange,' as he used to think. Sighing, he distantly heard Theo say, \"Chet. I'm so sorry.\" ' Sorry?' Chet can't help but remember all the things he missed because he had to take care of Theo… yet he has the gall to say 'Sorry?' \"You have to believe me, I didn't mean for this to…-\" Theo began again, 'That's it! No more…' He. had. ENOUGH. Chet turned around and began what would shatter time and space to create a world that under any other circumstances...should never have happened. \"All my life…Heh…Aaaall my life, I've defended you. COVERED for you, stood up for you, APOLOGIZED for you…And for what!\" \"I-\" His little brother began, \"NO!\" Chet interrupted, \"Just…just let me finish…I've done so much for you; Theo…Is this what I get in return? To be dragged down with you on your 'sinking' ship?\" Chet used his eye sockets to make quotes in the air, as Theo flinched. He knew his little brother hadn't really meant to nearly kill them with the tricycle, but he had kept it all in for so long…He supposed though…that deep down, he was just worried for his little brother. He hadn't always been such a handful… Without even realizing it, he noticed that he had approached Theo and was already finishing up a sentence. \"-on the S.S. Theo! Aye-aye, Captain!\" he spat out sarcastically while saluting with one eye socket. \"Sign me up!\" Theo looked at him sadly, and repeated what was defiantly fast becoming his most hated sentence. \"I'm so sorry.\" Chet would have twitched had he not already begun to say something else, \"What is WRONG with you?!\" he began before Theo cut in, \"I don't know!? All I know is, the other night, I'm standing above the 101, and all of a sudden…-\" Here Chet decided he would hear nothing of it, and perhaps, later he'll realize that he should have…for both their sakes. \"NO! It was a rhetorical question!\" he sighs and notices that he was right in Theo's face yelling, \"I-I just can't do this anymore Theo…\" He sniffs and turns his shell to Theo, \"I want you to be happy…and if this-\" he gestured around to the destruction that was 'The Plant,' with his left eye socket, \"is how your happy…then I won't stop you…but…I won't join you in it either…\" \"Chet…\" He hers Theo call him, \"No, just no…Theo I-I don't really want to see or talk to you right now…just…give me some-\" CAW! CAW! ' Oh no…' before Chet knew it, the world was swinging from left to right and right to left. \"AH! The world is moving!\" Chet couldn't help but scream, and he watched as Theo grew smaller and smaller before he couldn't even see Theo at all… Theo POV Theo knew he had messed up when everyone just stared at him…but these weren't the normal stares he always got, these stares where like crows pecks, and they hurt more than when some other snail caught him 'pretend racing', and decided he was a freak or 'unwanted'. No, these were worse…much, much worse. Before he could even open his mouth to say ANYTHING, anything at all, Chet-his big brother was already trying to apologize. It warmed Theo right up to his small snail hart when Chet did something like that. But Theo knew…he knew that Chet wasn't going to be able to get him out of this one…not this time. So he watched…he watched and listened to what was going to happen, and he would accept his punishment as it was, even if they told him he was no longer welcome in the garden anymore. He would hold his head up high, and wish all of them a 'snail of a day!' and leave. It was too bad Theo didn't know that his brother was going to get his punishment along with him. The moment is here…this is a page break… (╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻ Enjoy… Theo couldn't believe his ears…well his technical ears anyways. The boss well their old boss had not only fired him, but his BROTHER as well! 'I can't believe this just happened…' he thought to himself. 'Are they crazy!? Chet's one of the best workers they have! This-this is crazy, no! Insane! They…' It was when Theo heard a sigh that he snapped himself out of his thoughts. 'Chet…' Theo never really liked The Plant. But he knew that being the safety supervisor was Chet's more or less dream. He was always trying (and usually succeeding) in keeping everyone safe. So much so that he was being considered for 'The Council'. Chet himself might not know, or perhaps he did and never said anything…but Theo knew it was one of the highest positions you could reach. As a snail anyways… Theo decided he would try and apologize before anything else happened. \"Chet. I'm so sorry.\" He said sincerely, he hadn't honestly thought that trying to teach the small human a lesson would end up this badly. Heck, he was lucky he hadn't killed anybody. \"You have to believe me, I didn't mean for this to…-\" He tried again before Chet interrupted him, \"All my life…Heh…Aaaall my life, I've defended you. COVERED for you, stood up for you, APOLOGIZED for you…And for what!\" \"I-\" Theo tried again, \"NO!\" Chet interrupted, \"Just…just let me finish…I've done so much for you; Theo…Is this what I get in return? To be dragged down with you on your 'sinking ship'?\" Chet used his eye sockets to make quotes in the air, as Theo flinched. Chet looked so sad…so, defeated… is this what he had done? He would have rather found out that he had killed somesnail then to see his big, smart, more cool headed brother look so sad, so, disappointed…with him. Theo backed up slowly when Chet began to crawl slowly towards him, he hadn't even noticed, nor did he catch most of what he said, just a little of the last sentence. \"-on the S.S. Theo! Aye-aye, Captain!\" he spat out sarcastically while saluting with one eye socket. \"Sign me up!\" He looked at Chet sadly, he knew it was his fault, and he had known that Chet was close to blowing up before…he just miss-calculated the 'how soon' part. So, Theo decided he would try again, it didn't matter how long it took him, he would make it up…truly he would. \"I'm so sorry.\" He said again, \"What is WRONG with you?!\" Chet asked him incredulously. Now every other snail knows that Theo was usually very quiet, unless it involves cars, racing or otherwise something he really, REALLY likes. But at that moment he realized that he hadn't told Chet what had happened to him at the 101. 'Now's my chance!' Theo thought to himself, 'Maybe if I tell him what happened he'll understand!' with that thought in mind, Theo attempted to tell Chet what happened, \"I don't know! All I know is, the other night, I'm standing above the 101, and all of a sudden…-\" \"NO! It was a rhetorical question!\" Chet yells at him in front of his face before backing off, 'Perhaps not…' Theo thought to himself, \"I-I just can't do this anymore Theo…\" he hears Chet sniff. And Theo watches as Chet turns his shell to him. 'That hurts…' he thinks sadly, 'Chet's never before turned his shell to me…' And in truth, Chet never had, not even when he had the opportunity to do so. Theo had this sort of odd sinking feeling in his stomach as Chet continued to speak, \"I want you to be happy…and if this-\" Chet gestured around to the destruction that was 'The Plant,' with his left eye socket, \"is how your happy…then I won't stop you…but…I won't join you in it either…\" he trailed off, Theo was hoping that this was going where he thought it was going, \"Chet…\" He called after him, 'Please don't leave me…' \"No, just no…\" Chet mumbled, \"Theo I-I don't really want to see or talk to you right now…just…give me some-\" CAW! CAW! ' Oh no…' Theo thought, unknowingly mirroring his brother's thoughts as well. 'Crows!' Before Theo could so much as scream the unwanted word, his brother, his ONLY family left, was being carried away, farther, and farther away… 'No…Not Chet…please not him too…' Theo only thought for a few seconds, no more than 3. But it was enough. For what he will never know, as in that moment no one would truly take into account 3 small little seconds of time. Another moment is here … this is a page brea k… (╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻ Enjoy … Theo POV ' This could not be happening. This can't be happening. It just can't be…' These were Theo's only thoughts at the moment. 'Why couldn't it be me? Why not me?' Theo had somehow, all over again, started that wired speeding thing where he swears he .like. . It was ridiculous! Snails aren't cars! He knows that now…But, then why did he sound like one…? He wished he was normal…just plain ol' Theo. Nothing more…Don't get him wrong…he was thankful that because he was so speedy, and…car like, he was able to catch up to the crows and all…but because he WAS speedy…his brother was hurt. How could he have known that knocking him out of the crow's beak was going to throw him hard enough towards the ground that he cracked his shell? How?! Theo just wished that he hadn't taken him so long to get to him. If he had-had just five more seconds…maybe he could have knocked him out of the air instead… \"Don't worry Chet…I'll get us home! And you'll get fixed right back up okay?\" Theo talked to his unconscious brother, \"Just you wait…\" Theo looked around the rather desolate parking area to find somewhere safe for his brother to stay. Just for a little, only so he could look for some kind of caring box or container so he could take Chet home. He had just now thought of putting Chet under the food truck when- CLANK! \"Well, well, well. Buenas noches , little amigos .\" The man laughs happily, as he uses his hat to pick up the unconscious Chet and a stunned Theo. \"This must be my lucky day.\" The man seems to tell the snails, as he walks towards the food truck and places them on the cars dashboard after getting in. Theo flinches when the load sound of the door closing makes Chet groan, and he wishes that the man would just leave them alone. The man, then uses his cell phone to call someone and simply says, \" Hola . Its Tito.\" Tito-it looked like the man's name was- looks down at them and says, \"Hey, tell everyone-I'm bringing it.\" He nodded as he says this. 'I'm bringing it?' Theo thinks to himself as the man-Tito, it was Tito he had to remember,- What was the man bringing? He hoped it wasn't them and it was just something else he had done while not in the food truck. Tito he remembers starts the truck, and Theo gets as close to Chet as he can to try and stop the cars vibrations from making Chet feel worse. The man-Tito, he corrects himself, even though Theo himself sees no actual point in doing so, turns on the radio and pulls out of the parking lot they were in to drive who knows where. Theo wonders if he'll be able to get out of this one alive along with his brother. After all…Crows were one thing, and small humans were another, but big adult humans might do things differently, this man-Tito-ah who cares what his name was anyways? Might decide he and his brother made good escargot! Theo decided he would wait a bit longer to see where this man was taking him and his brother. He could work with whatever was there first. … … .… … Theo didn't know how he did so, but it appears he had dosed off for a few minutes. The Man, as he would now call him. Was just barley taking them both off of the food truck. 'At least The Man was kind enough to flip the cup right side up so Chet didn't fall out…' Theo thought as he tried to take a look at his surroundings. There was a food place with the same logo as the food truck, an Auto body and a 'Hobby' place. Theo made sure to remember that the way the car came in from was from the right of the food place. That meant he and Chet would have to go left from the food place to go in the general direction of wherever they were now, to get to where they were before. \"Agh…\" Theo heard from beside him, Theo turned quickly to look at his brother and found him shivering slightly. \"CHET!\" he yelled worriedly, \"Chet if you can hear me I'll make sure to get you some help…okay? Just hang in there, and don't go anywhere towards 'the light' okay?\" Theo tried to joke lightly. Even though all he wanted to do was hide in his shell. 'Chet…' Theo looked up towards the man and then around himself as he heard distant talking, Theo noticed that they were being carried into the Auto Body shop. 'At least it's not the restaurant.' Theo thought sarcastically, 'It can't be worse…I hope.' As he thought this, The Man entered the Auto Body shop and Theo had to blink once or twice so his eyes could adjust, there were light up ahead and it looked like some people were standing in a line waiting for The Man. 'About 8 people…' Theo thought to himself. Just as he finished this thought The Man spoke to the adult humans gathered there, \"Somebody better call the cops, cause' I'm about to make a killing!\" the man laughs. Theo felt his blood run cold-er. Perhaps it was best that Theo get himself and his brother out of there. Before Theo could even attempt to formulate a plan, some small adult lady human pulled the cup and along with it them to her, she laughed and said, \"HA! Whiplash is going to eat them up!\" ' Whiplash?' Theo though, 'who?' \"It's going to be a slaughter.\" An elder-like adult said, \"Mm-humm, Dead meat.\" A younger woman stated. Theo was beginning to freak out; all he wanted was to help Chet! Was that too much to ask!? The Man passed all those terrible adult humans, and then followed by dropping him and his brother on an odd auto body lift that was styled like a racing track. Theo could see freedom just beyond the humans; if he could just get themselves over there…He was startled from his musings when the Younger Woman threw some kind of…water? On to the race track wannabe, then the Older Man came and placed a…a-a snail? Next to him, he-for he was defiantly more male, was a dark gray almost black color he seemed to have something that looked like an engine where his shell used to be. 'Doesn't he just look haughty?' Theo thought to himself sarcastically. \"A little far from home, aren't you…garden snail?\" The dark older snail nearly sneers at him. 'I always disliked snails like him.' Theo thought, before he decided on blocking the others view of his brother. 'No need for him to see my brother so weak.' Theo tried to justify his own actions, in order to block his growing worry. Perhaps it wasn't the best of moves as another snail was placed next to his brother's side, and laughed rather manically or was that menacingly? Before he –for this one was also a male- says, \"Hey! I think we got a crier here.\" The medium blue snail eyes him. Theo meanwhile, tries not to shiver, while another much, MUCH, bigger snail was placed where the previously dark older one was, and this one- also male- whoops and says: \"Let's do this!\" Another snail, of a red-ish color- female- if he's right, yells out, \"I got this one! I GOT this one!\" Theo thinks he sees her chewing…bubblegum? He's not too sure what to think of this one. And finally, (at least he thinks so, for there was no more room on the track) a snail that almost matched Chet's color but with a pink tinge was placed onto the track, he didn't glance his way and all he said was, \"Yhea! Yhea, yhea!-this ones on me!\" What happened next was the strangest moment in Theo's life by far…they were all acting like-like cars! With engines and all! 'This must be how the other snails saw me.' Theo realized, 'like a crazy snail…' He was snapped out of his 'self-discovery' process by the man yelling, \"GO!\" And like the signal it is, the other snails took off, or at least, they would have…should they not have been you know…snails! Theo right now thought they were all crazy, and if they wouldn't listen to him…then they would listen to his speed. With that in mind Theo turned around slightly to look at his brother, whom was still unconscious. 'He's been like that for so long…' Theo thought worriedly, \"Don't worry Chet\" he whispered, \"I'll be right back, and this time…they'll listen.\" With determination, Theo revved once more. He was determined to win this, but not for himself… for Chet. *READ MEEE!* A/N: This was relatively long. Part 2 will be up in about a week or so, as I am going to college. Review and tell me if you love, hate it? Or maybe you have a prompt for me? Or a short story you want me to write? Review and send it in! I am writing to grow the community after all. :D[Chapter 2] Alternate Dimensions A Turbo FanFiction Disclaimer: If I owned Turbo that would make me a snail, and also….his mother. DUN! DUNN! DUNNN! (O-O) A/N: I honestly think the Turbo community is too small. So! I will now begin writing Turbo stories. Each chapter is going to be 1 or more K. And each is its own story unless stated otherwise. Like so- Part 1 of Blah. Would mean it is part of the same one and thus grouped together. I'll also state if it's a new story. With that said, here is the main summery... M/S: An alternate time, place or 'world' brought about by a different choice in circumstance made by someone or something. That is one way to bring about an Alternate Dimension. Chapter Summery set in Movie Verse: Chet decided enough was enough. He had made it his job to watch and take care of Theo. But he wasn't about to let himself be dragged down with him...Not anymore. ' Thoughts' \"Speech\" Noises/Unknown An alternate end. Part 2 of 3 RECAP \" GO!\" And like the signal it is, the other snails took off, or at least, they would have…should they not have been you know…snails! Theo right now thought they were all crazy, and if they wouldn't listen to him…then they would listen to his speed. With that in mind, Theo turned around slightly to look at his brother, whom was still unconscious. 'He's been like that for so long…' Theo thought worriedly, \" Don't worry Chet\" he whispered, \"I'll be right back, and this time…they'll listen.\" With determination, Theo revved once more. He was determined to win this, but not for himself…for Chet. Theo POV Theo revved, and distantly he heard the Small Old Woman say, \"Look! Taco man bring dead snails!\" Theo didn't like that. And it wasn't just because his brother might or might not be dying, but also because The Man reminded him of well…him! He would show them, he would show both the snails and the other humans that he wasn't someone you could push over and leave for compose. He would also show them that The Man wasn't one to be made fun of. At least…not in his presence. Theo met The Man's eyes and revved much louder than before, and he knew The Man heard when he gasped. Now, Theo took off. It was such a wonderful feeling! And though he knew that it was these same powers that got him and his brother into the mess they were in right then…he also couldn't help but see these as an opportunity, for what…Theo still didn't know. Before he knew it he was off the fake track and passed the humans. 'I'm free!' Theo thought to himself, 'finally…' it only took him a second to realize that Chet was still inside with the crazy snails and terrible humans. Once noticing this, he tried to control his movements enough to turn and make his way back. While he was speeding in the general direction of the Auto body shop, he saw the snails from before make their way down to the pavement bellow the 'race track'. 'Time to show them what's REAL speed.' Theo thought a little vindictively. As he grew closer, he saw the Younger Woman pull The Man, out of his way. He wouldn't have cared either way; this was, after all, for his brother. Smirking, Theo began to stop as he created a large spiral right in front of the other snails' view. He rather liked the spiral; it had left a trial of glowing blue light and some smoke. From up front he heard through his panting The Man said something that sounded like, \" Santa Maria! \" Theo didn't know all too well what that meant…but he did know that what he had done was probably going to be seen as 'awe inspiring.' \"What did you say your name was again?\" Theo turned around and saw that it was the slightly pink-ish green snail that had asked him. And close behind him were the other snails. Theo himself was more worried about getting Chet some assistance, so he just revved, and blasted threw them right on back to the fake track. He knew it was rude, and when his brother woke up, he also knew he wouldn't be all too please to find that out. Theo distantly heard a 'hey!' from the one he assumed was the dark one, not that he cared, once again. Now on top of the track Theo continuously made circles around Chet's form, and every turn he did The Man grew closer and closer. 'Almost here…Come on!' Theo mentally urged, 'Just a wee bit more…there! ' The man was right in front of him, \" Que pasa little amigo ?\" The Man questioned happily, \"Whose-Oh…\" Theo saw the man trial off when he saw his brothers cracked shell, \"H-hey ah…Paz…somebody?\" The Man stammers and looks back, \"I think little amigo's friend is, ah…hurt.\" Theo, found himself seeing the world sideways all of a sudden. And he had no idea how that happened, 'I'm just tired…' Theo thought sluggishly (no pun intended). Much more distantly, he could hear someone say to take Chet somewhere where they could help him better. And now someone else was calling him kid. Couldn't they see he was tired? 'Just a small rest…' he thought, 'nothing too long…' with this thought, Theo surrendered himself to the warm darkness and fell asleep, at least now he knew that Chet was going to get some help… The Crew POV On their way up to the track, The Crew members were all thinking on their own. For once Whiplash wasn't telling them to do something or train more to best this 'new' kid. SkidMark wasn't saying something or the other about supernatural creatures. SmoothMove wasn't making beats; WhiteShadow seemed to be very careful with his movements and wasn't saying anything loudly-or anything- at all for that matter. And Burn seems to have thrown away her bubblegum. Every snail was off in their own thoughts, and it would remain like that until they knew their leader would talk to them and tell them it was okay to approach this new 'kid'. Whiplash wasn't all too sure what to make of the kid. He had looked like he wasn't going to be much of a challenge. He didn't seem like he was strong willed, or very fast at all. Heck, he looked no younger then SkidMark! If he were to go by \"human\" years he doesn't seem older then maybe sixteen, at the least, eighteen at the most! And though SkidMark was technically 'fifteen' he did tend to act like a 11 year old child… Whiplash knew that SkidMark was one, at hart and mind, much like WhiteShadow. But at least he himself knew what was what...most of the time anyways... And a snail with super speed was defiantly not in his 'what is what' list. Perhaps he should have a word with him…Just to make sure that he wasn't any danger to his crew or otherwise connected to HIM. SmoothMove , much like Whiplash was in a small dilemma. The kid had some wicked speed on him, and for all he knew he was radioactive! All Smooth had to do was approach the new kid and ask some questions. he would make sure to ask Whiplash first and then wait for him to give the 'go ahead'. For now though…the kid seemed alright...except for blowing of his question earlier, that is. SmoothMove would keep his opinion to himself until he knew how the kid actually was. In personality, character and mind. WhiteShadow thought the kid was cool. He was hoping the kid's speed was contagious! How awesome would that be! It almost made him want to dance around! Except…he wasn't all too sure he was a nice snail…it's not like he said hello, or even talked to any of them…WhiteShadow hoped he was. Maybe if he talked to him in a quite-er voice he would talk back to him too? Burn thought it was kind of cool to have super speed…she wished she had some of her own super power like that. Wouldn't that have been helpful before! Well…she had been so awed (as much as she didn't want to admit it…) by the speed, she had accidentally let her gum fall out! She needed to go get another piece soon…As for the kid…She would wait and see, to her it seemed Whiplash had found the 'perfect' apprentice. She wondered if he would give the kid a chance first… SkidMark was positive the new kid was an alien-robot hybrid! ' I just know he is! Skid thought to himself, 'Now all I have to do is convince everyone else that he is…' Skid knew that everyone was growing tired of his whole 'extra-terrestrials' thing. But he knew that there were some! He had met some himself! And…even if the kid wasn't an alien-hybrid…He looked, and acted weird like him…maybe…maybe they could be friends? The moment is here…this is a page break… (╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻ Enjoy… The Crew POV Burn hurried as much as she possibly could when she heard their leader shout. Now don't get things confused, Whiplash was one to shout anyways, (usually orders) but this was more of a- \"OH NO!\" kind of shout, and not a-\"GET BACK ON THE TRACK!\" sort of shout. Either way, Burn wasn't about to be the last to see what was wrong, nor the last to help. SmoothMove was rightfully worried. He was just a couple small snail steps behind Burn when he heard Whiplash shout. Smooth wanted to know what had happened, but…he didn't want to leave the younger (and a little slow on the up-take) team members (that were behind them), without some sort of vigilance…Smooth made up his mind. He would slow down some, just so the others would catch up. After all…he could always ask their leader what happened anyways. SkidMark was going to have a panic attack if he didn't find out what was happening up front! Their leader never shouts for nothing after all! What if he was being abducted right in front of them and he couldn't ward them away since he was so far behind!? Then where would he go? No one else has ever been this kind to him. These snails were his family! SkidMark decided he would just have to pass SmoothMove. 'Just like a race…' he told himself, 'Just…like…a…race…' WhiteShadow was sooo hungry! He really wanted to know if it was time for after-dinner, dinner! Another whole tomato would be great! But WhiteShadow had heard Whiplash shout something…Maybe he was hungry too? On the other hand…it could have been an order to speed up. WhiteShadow wouldn't know…he was much too far behind to hear what their leader had said. Nonetheless, WhiteShadow would hurry as much as he could. Maybe it was time for after-dinner, dinner! Whiplash nearly lost his cool, (key word nearly ), he did on the other hand-er-snail, shout a bit too loudly. He knew his crew was going to try and catch up to him because of that. Now…Whiplash could think of a view options right off the bat… He could tell his team to stay away from the obviously crazy snail doing circles in front of him. OR- he could shout at the kid and see if he would calm the heck down and explain himself, (and his powers)…They sounded like good ideas. But…those ideas wouldn't really keep his crew away from the snail…after all, they were ALL very curious as to who or what the snail-if he even was a snail-was. As Whiplash tried to figure out what to do exactly, (for both the benefit and safety of his crew) and to satisfy the curiosity he himself had. He overheard what the friend of his human pet said. Though most of what was said was in the background of his mind, something stood out enough to worry him, YES worry HIM. And it was this small sentence the Big one said: \"I think little amigo's friend is, ah…hurt.\" That small sentence had Whiplash nearly give himself whiplash. He turned his head so quickly towards to the crazy kid he was sure he did give himself just a bit of his name to his neck. That was when he gave the shout. Really, it wasn't anything to odd of him. He had shouted a bit ago to the team to \"Pick up the pace.\" But that was then…Now; when he saw the kid tip sideways…he couldn't just sit tight. He called out, \"Hey! Hey kid!\" Whiplash wasn't too sure he was heard, not even when he closed in the distance and asked the kid of he was 'all right.' Nope, nada , as The Big One sometimes says when there's no there humans around the Plaza, there was no response from the kid. If Whiplash wasn't well…Whiplash, he might have assumed the kid was ill, or hurt just like the other apparently was. But, he was Whiplash and he knew when someone collapsed from other injuries. The kid here had simply collapsed from exhaustion, he could tell now that he was up close. \"Hey Whiplash!\" he heard Smooth call from further away. \"What happened?\" Burn panted as she finished the sentence. Whiplash on a side note made sure to train up his crew more as he noticed everyone else coming up behind him and now Burn, were all dead tired and panting. Whiplash to answer everyone's question was to say the truth, \"The kid has collapsed because he's exhausted.\" \"Yha…?\" Smooth replied, \"Well…I'm…about…to collapse…too.\" He said as he closed his eyes and took a breath. Whiplash saw everyone nod behind SmoothMove, who had made his way back up to the front. Noticing everyone taking a break…Whiplash decided to use this presented opportunity to say some very important things, and maybe some less important things as well. \"I do believe you're all out of shape.\" He stated first, \"And-\" here he paused as everyone groaned, \"We will have to get up early tomorrow and go a few laps at The Course.\" Everyone groaned even loader. \"But first.\" He continued, and he watched as everyone perked up a little, \"First, we need to get this kid-\" He moved from his crews view of the unconscious kid, and now missing brother (he was carried away by The Big One earlier), \"And take him to the Den so he can properly rest. His friend is hurt-\" Whiplash didn't even have a chance to finish his sentence because everyone decided at that EXACT moment to shout simultaneously. \"What!?\" \"Whose hurt?\" \"There was another snail here, is it an alien-robot too!?\" \"WhiteShadow!\" Here everyone glanced at said snail oddly, before ignoring it entirely. Sighing, Whiplash told them what he had overheard, and what the other snail looked like-more or less. \"-I wasn't given the chance to see the other snail to well, he was purple though.\" Whiplash finished. \"Purple?\" SmoothMove asked confusedly, \"Purple is a color. You know…like grapes or like the sweet rocks called Jelly Beans?\" Burn said as she looked at Smooth oddly, \"Ya' know…like the PURPLE one that's YOUR favorite flavor?\" 'at the moment…' she thought privately. Here, smooth glared slightly at Burn, before saying rather pointedly, \"I KNOW what the color purple is, Burn. What I don't know or don't understand is how I missed a purple snail on the track earlier.\" \"Oh…\" Burn turned a slightly darker shade of her color, \"It's alright, I just want to crash for the night.\" Smooth put in before anything potentially explosive could happen. Either way, Burn wasn't one to apologize, but it was usually okay, her darkening color always indicated if she was sorry anyways. One just had to know how to read it. \"Whatever…\" Burn said, as she turned back to face their leader, he was being awfully quite for being right in front of a potential team argument. He never lets one brake out because it could, 'stunt team growth' or whatever. \"Um…hey? Ah- Whiplash?\" Here everyone turned around to face SkidMark, \"Can we go back to the Den now? I-I think the ali-ah…kid is going to be too tired to move himself sooo…\" SkidMark trailed off, unsure if they would pay him any mind or not. Whiplash, decide there had been enough standing around. \"Skid's right,\" Whiplash said, and he noticed how SkidMark brightened up a little. \"If we want to get to the Den. We need to get movin' or no one will get any good rest tonight.\" Whiplash thought for a moment when a sudden plan popped into his head, it could work. Plus, he decided it would be better to get everyone home faster, as traveling together would inadvertently slow everyone down with the kid still being unconscious and all. \"All right everyone, here's the plan.\" Whiplash savored a small moment of accomplishment when everyone dropped their side conversations to pay complete and utter attention to him. They weren't always so inattentive…perhaps they were just tired…Whiplash decided that since everyone's attention was on him, he could go ahead and give out the plan. \"Burn you and Skid here take the back way to the Den, and make a temporary bed for the kid. Also, see if there is any food left, he may be hungry when he wakes up.\" Whiplash used his tail (or foot if you prefer) to point at the kid. \"Got it!\" SkidMark jumped enthusiastically, \"Alright.\" Burn replied as she gave Skid the 'race you there' eye stare, before they both jumped off the track and used their parachutes to glide both down and as far as they could. \"Smooth. WhiteShadow.\" Whiplash said after the other two had gone out of his sight. \"Yha?\" SmoothMove asked, \"Yes?\" White shadow asked as well. \"WhiteShadow, you're going to carry the kid, alright.\" Whiplash stated, \"SmoothMove will help me hoist and secure him to you.\" He finished. \"ALL-sorry-alright!\" WhiteShadow said happily, \"Smooth?\" Whiplash asked, \"I'm on it.\" SmoothMove said as he moved to help Whiplash with the kid. \"He sure is a heavy sleeper.\" Smooth grunted as he helped his leader with the kid, \"And heavy too…\" he finished. \"That he is…\" Whiplash said as he finished securing the kid so he wouldn't fall off of WhiteShadow's back. \"How are you holding up WhiteShadow?\" SmoothMove asked. WhiteShadow's answer was to scream, \"WhiteShadow!\" as he too jumped off the track and used his parachute. \"Smooth!\" Whiplash barked at the only remaining Crew member. \"On it!\" SmoothMove replied in a hurry as he used his parachute to go after the misdirection-ed WhiteShadow. Meanwhile, still at the top of the track, or better said, what was LEFT of the track after the kid sped through, and blasted a good portion of it off of the table it was on. Whiplash had to remember to tell his Crew to remember, that until they had a destination it was never wise to go anywhere. Unless death was where you were…Thinking such thoughts led Whiplash to sigh. What a day it had been... 'It could be worse.' Was something Whiplash often thought, 'Much, much worse…' After all…he could still be with HIM. Doing his best to ignore his thoughts, Whiplash used his own parachute to get to where he spotted SmoothMove telling something to WhiteShadow. It was nice to have so many members in the Crew, and really, Whiplash wouldn't have it any other way. *READ ME!* A/N: Here is chapter 2! I hope it was more or less alright! And remember! Don't forget to review! Even if all you put is a face, like so - :D Even that counts to me. (And it's easy to show how you feel about the story chapter!) I may have to make this a 4 to 5 chapter thing! Jeez I thought it could be a 2 chapter story… sigh, college takes up LOTS of free time…oh-well, Got to go! ….. ….. ….. .. REVIEW! ","Summary":" Alternate Dimensions A Turbo FanFiction Disclaimer: If I owned Turbo...I would be his Mother. A/N: "},{"Movie":"Turbo","Title":"Rome","Author":"TRikiD","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11718894","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Ok, so I didn't know where I was going with Turbo Love, so I decided to delete it, rewrite it as a Rio parody and post this! I hope you guys like chapter one...despite that it's a little short. Rome Chapter 1 – Turbo needs to come to Rome! Every snail that lives in the small city behind Dos Bros Tacos, you know, the one actually meant for snails…anyway, the snails there are lucky to live in such a peaceful place, and not only is it nice and neighborly, but it's also the home of Turbo the snail that won the Indy 500. Now, of course, F.A.S.T. was once again found racing each other out on the track while Chet would wait at the side lines, like he always does. But something…or rather someone…would make this day extraordinary. Chet squinted down the track to see who the winner would be. This time, it was actually Whiplash to cross the finish line first and become the winner. \"Yeah, now that's how you pay the bills!\" Whiplash cheered. \"Nicely done, Whiplash. You paid the bills…like a snail who, you know, has to pay the bills,\" Turbo complimented, but he's still bad at snappy come-backs. \"Hey, Turbo buddy!\" The said snail's head perked up when he heard Tito call him from him and his brother's taco stand. \"Be back, Guys!\" Turbo called as he zipped off; wondering what Tito needed him for this time. When Turbo did get to the taco stand in the Starlight Plaza, he was curious when he saw a pale, blue-eyed, energetic-looking, blonde young woman sitting with Tito at one of the umbrella tables. So Turbo had no choice but to zip up onto the table to investigate. \"Little Amigo, this is Doctor Elizabeth; she's Italian,\" Tito told the little snail, and he whispered the last part with a wink, \"Doc, this is the racing legend and my best friend, Turbo!\" \"Oh Tito, you don't need to be so formal; just call me Beth. And this is Turbo? Wow, what a magnificent specimen of Gastropoda,\" Beth said in awe as she gently scooped Turbo onto her index finger to examine him better, \"Tito, do you know why I'm here?\" \"Because you said you are a doctor of Entomology?\" \"Yes! Let me explain. I've come from the other side of the world to tell you that we have been working on a VERY important project; we've taken a common female land snail and genetically modified her to become have unnatural sped, just like Turbo! But since this kind of modifying is somewhat dangerous and difficult, our hope is to bring the two together and breed a generation of fast snails.\" Turbo's eyes popped wide, and his jaw dropped and hit the floor. But when he got what Beth just said through his thick head, he shook his head and gulped while blushing. But Tito was a little surprised at first too, but in a good way. \"U-uh…I guess that's a good idea…yeah! When will she get here?\" Tito asked while purposely ignoring Turbo's desperate head shakes. \"What? Oh, no, no, no…Pam is in Italy; Turbo needs to come to Rome!\" Beth replied with a huge, enthusiastic smile. Now, it was Tito's turn for his jaw to go slack. \"Rome? A-as in the capital of Italy? As in the Italy on the other side of the WORLD?!\" Tito kept raising his voice as he stood up from his seat; his eye slightly twitching, \"oh man, I don't think we can do that. I mean, even when we do travel, it's never supposed to be too long; I have a taco career with my bro, and Turbo rather likes it here in California.\" \"Oh, don't worry; we'll make sure you're brother gets all the profit he needs, and that you can always contact him and your friends. Plus, Turbo will always be with you, and you will be with me.\" But the last part that Beth stated made Tito accidentally choke on a bite of his taco; luckily, he was able to save himself by pounding his fist to his chest and soon swallowing. \"Look Senorita, I hate to turn down your offer, but-.\" \"Oh please, Tito! Turbo isn't ordinary! If this doesn't happen, then when will the world ever get another chance to experience such a mistake of nature!\" Turbo nor Tito could not believe what they were hearing. \"I'm sorry, Doc; it's been nice meeting you…but I'm gonna have to ask you to leave,\" Tito said calmly but while glaring at Elizabeth and leaving the table to throw away his trash, and with Turbo sitting angrily on his shoulder. But Elizabeth started after them. \"No, please…look, just consider it,\" Beth pleaded as she grabbed out a business card, and Tito reluctantly took it; while Elizabeth then left wile sulking her head…and Turbo and Tito did feel bad as they exchanged worried glances. Later that night, everything was supposed to be sound asleep…but Turbo was pacing back and forth in the Crew Pit while the rest of the team was sleeping. \"'Not normal'. 'Mistake of nature',\" Turbo grumbled in a mocking tone, and then he stopped while looking at his reflection in a small mirror, \"I may have super-speed, but I'm just as normal as any other snail…right? I can still climb up onto walls a ceilings; I've got big eyes on eye-stocks; I've got a shell; I'm slimy; I can't stand salt…so what's so bad about me?\" Turbo continued to stare sadly at his reflection, thinking that he should just go to bed…but then his face brightened up when he had a brilliant idea. \"I know! The Starlight Plaza's parking-lot should be empty at this hour; if I can just take my time, like a normal snail, to take a gentle slither all around the perimeter of the lot, then I'm sure to be a very normal snail!\" \"Turbo! Will you shut up?! We're tryin' ta sleep!\" \"Sorry, Whiplash!\" Sure, Turbo used his speed to get to the empty, cold parking-lot, he determined to get around it by only using the slowness he was naturally born with. \"I will NOT use my speed; not once! I am still a snail, so a snail I will be tonight! You're gonna bite your tongue, Beth!\" And with that, the confident snail slowly started slithering his way…only to get bored and groan in the next three seconds. \"Ok, I immediately regret this.\" But then a huge truck was pulling into the lot, and it was driving right towards Turbo. But he snail was too frozen like a deer in the head-lights as the truck got closer. But Turbo was soon able to shake his head and sped away just in time while the truck came to a small, screeching stop. The truck turned out to be Tito's taco truck, as the said big man came bursting out in worry and picking Turbo up while gasping with fear. \"Turbo, are you ok?! I didn't hurt you, did I?!\" Tito asked frantically as he scanned Turbo for any injuries, but calmed down when he found none, \"what were you doing out here, anyway?\" It was then that Tito knew what the problem was when Turbo looked away with sorrow and embarrassment. \"Oh…it was because of what Elizabeth said earlier, huh? Little Amigo, I didn't like what she said about you either, but I don't want to see you get hurt just by trying to prove her wrong…if you really want to go through with going to Europe and meeting Pam, then I won't stop you.\" Turbo looked slowly up at Tito with wide eyes…and was smiling. \"Yes, I mean it, Turbo. We've traveled far before; what's different about Italy? And we'll be back home in California before you even know it.\" Those who were reading and/or loving Turbo Love, I am sorry. I just didn't know what else I could do! Anyway, hope you have seen and/or heard of the movies Rio and Rio 2 because this rewritten story is based off of Rio! So I hope you guys will like it! Until the next chapter, I'm TRikiD, bye-bye![Chapter 2] Chapter 2 - Turbo Meets Pam The next morning, Tito and Turbo broke the news to their friends and brothers that they were going to Rome Italy…but Turbo had a harder time explaining the real reason to his friends. \"You're going to WHAT?!\" Chet exclaimed with shock. \"Yup, you guys heard me right. I'm, um…ahem…going to meet a girl,\" Turbo replied while clearing his throat and blushing madly. \"Oh, a girl, huh? Well, listen ta Ol' Smoove and his love lessons,\" Smoove Moove added with a grin and startled slithering around Turbo, \"now, ta impress the ladies, ya gotta have confidence; never be afraid ta puff out'cher chest. Ya know, like a love bug.\" \"Yeah, right!\" Burn snapped, \"get advice about ladies FROM a lady, Turbo. All you have to do is be yourself, but Smoove was right about somethin'; don't get scared. Women HATE scaredy-cats…even though it is pretty cute.\" The boys all just stared at their female friend in silence when she clearly started rambling, but she soon growled and shook her head. \"Just don't act stupid, got it?!\" the fiery snail snapped. \"Are you SURE you have to do this, Little Brother? I mean, this is a big step, and you don't even know this girl,\" Chet added with worry. \"Yeah! What if she's a part of the secret reptilian forces in the government, and she's seeking Intel from you to take over the world?!\" Skidmark suddenly started rambling, and the team just stared at him blankly. \"Um, no…listen, Garden Snail, I need ta apologize,\" Whiplash added calmly. \"Apologize? For what?\" Turbo questioned, only for his mentor to answer by smacking him across the face. \"For that! I don't like this either, and I'm not even your paranoid brother…no offense.\" \"None taken,\" Chet sighed. \"And what? You think I'm actually comfortable with this? Of course I'm not; I'm about to travel halfway across the world to meet this modified girl snail, so that we can…ahem…of course I'm against this idea, but do you think I have choice? It's for science, and they need their research…and…well, I don't want to be the only freak of nature anymore. So, I'm gonna put a stamp on this age, and continue my legacy, whether you guys are with me or not,\" Turbo started to explain with anger, but his tone soon softened, and he then sped off without another word. But after Turbo left, the team shared worried glances, and soon nodded and smiled before activating their shells to catch up with their fast friend. \"Hold up, Garden Snail!\" Turbo couldn't help but screech to a halt and turn when he heard Whiplash's voice, and he was curious to stick around when his said mentor and the rest of his friends caught up with him. \"Of all the times you make a stupid decision…\" Whiplash began with a sigh and rolled his eyes, but then he started laughing, \"I'm not gonna stop you.\" \"You're not?\" Turbo asked with surprise. \"Why would we? This is a real chance for you ta find true love; we ain't gonna ruin that for ya,\" Burn replied. \"Especially considering your horrible history with women,\" Skidmark added in a chuckle, only to earn a slap on the face from Burn. \"I can't believe I'm saying this…but I'm gonna put aside my paranoia for your happiness, Little Brother,\" Chet sighed happily. \"Thanks, guys,\" Turbo says while smiling at each of his friends. \"Let's go, Turbo! Our plane'll be leaving soon!\" Tito soon called. \"I'll be back soon!\" Turbo shouted when he suddenly sped off after Tito. … \"We're gonna follow him, right?\" White Shadow soon asked. \"Dang right, we are!\" Whiplash replied with a grin. When Tito, Beth and Turbo's plane landed in the Ciampino Airport, it was already nighttime in Rome, so Beth had to hail a cab to take them straight to the lab…and it was awkwardly silent the cab. But as Turbo waited in the back to watch from the back window of the city go by, a city he has never seen before, but while his back was turned, he didn't notice two dark rat figures sneaking up behind him. And it wasn't until both the rats were both towering over him that Turbo finally noticed them a turned with a gasp…only to find that they weren't that scary. One rat was pitch black with amber eye, while the other was pure white with red eyes, and they were both smiling down at Turbo. \"Ciao, lumaca!\" the black rat greeted in a masculine voice with a heavy Italian accent. \"Come va?\" the white rat asked in a feminine voice, also with a heavy Italian accent. \"Oh, I-I-I, u-um…I don't, um…\" Turbo started stammering when he didn't understand the rats. \"I told you he was tourist, Nero,\" the white rat sneered at the black rat, but soon smiled back at Turbo, \"I'm Bianca and this is my brother Nero.\" \"'Sup?\" Nero asked with a shrug. \"Oh, you two are brother and sister? I couldn't tell,\" Turbo said sheepishly. \"Eh, no one can,\" Nero pointed out. \"But since we've introduced ourselves, we'd like it if you'd tell us who you are,\" Bianca added. \"Yeah, and what's with the shiny get-up?\" Nero questioned while referring to Turbo's shiny racing shell over his real one. \"Nero!\" Bianca hissed at her bother's nosiness. \"H-he's fine. And to answer your questions, my name is Turbo, I'm a snail who won the Indy Five Hundred, and-,\" Turbo began to explain with a smile, until the rats suddenly burst out laughing. \"You…you…YOU?! A snail?! Win a race?! That's a good one!\" Nero said between laughs. \"I have to agree! And whatever this 'Indy Five Hundred' is, I'm pretty sure no escargot could EVER win it!\" Bianca gasped while wiping tears away, making the winner of the Indy Five Hundred glare at them in annoyance. After a few more moments of laughter, is soon died down into awkwardness, and the rats couldn't believe the serious look the snail was giving them. \"Wait…you're actually serious?\" Nero questioned. \"YOU won a race?\" Bianca asked with shock, and then she and her brother shared a look of terror. \"HOW?!\" \"Well, let's just call it a 'freak accident'…and A LOT of luck,\" Turbo replied with a grin while turning to the side, and he revved up his shell, making the blue light it always gives off rise up into the swirl of his shell. \"Whooooooaaaaa…\" Nero and Bianca both sighed in amazement at the blue light emitting from Turbo's shell. \"You know what? You're ok…for a lumaca,\" Nero chuckled. \"Yes, well, I'm afraid we have to go…'Turbo' was it? Our stop is coming up soon, but we hope to see you again soon,\" Bianca sadly pointed out, and they used their stealth to go unnoticed while pushing the window down to lower it halfway, and they soon jumped out. \"Huh…what an odd pair,\" Turbo hummed. \"Please Tito, roll your window up; it's too cold to have it down,\" Beth soon demanded, and a confused Tito soon pushed the button to roll the window back up. But not a half hour later, their cab soon arrived at the entomology lab where Beth worked, and she showed them into a large room full many more busy scientists who were working with injured incest and snails of all sorts; there were even numerous terrariums that held recovering snails and insects. \"Whoa! Is this like your treatment room?\" Tito asked with amazement, as Turbo rode on his left shoulder, and the snail was also pretty enticed by the room. \"Yes, it is! We sometimes even like to refer to it as the heart and soul of our research. Now, are you ready to meat Pam, little guy?\" Beth asked with a smile while leaning towards Turbo, only making him and Tito nervous about the confined space between them. \"So, uh, anyway…where IS Pam?\" Tito questioned while awkwardly taking a step back from Beth. \"Oh, we keep her in a more 'welcoming' environment; she's a real free spirit,\" Beth chuckled nervously. \"No kidding!\" called a nearby man in a lab coat, as he turned while they approached, revealing a rather unpleasant sight; his left eye was black and puffy, as was his lower lip, and he even had a few bite marks on his face. And to Turbo, this could only indicate the worse. \"She did THAT?!\" Turbo asked with shock, and started to shrink into his shell, \"isn't that just charming? Ok, yeah, no, I've changed my mind about this!\" \"Oh, no, no, no, no, don't worry! There's absolutely NOTHING to be afraid of!\" Beth quickly pointed out and suddenly took Turbo off Tito's shoulder. And before Turbo or Tito knew it, the said snail was pushed through a small opening, and a solid metal door with no vents to escape through was shut, and right as he tried to turn and exit, only to smash his face against the door in failure. \"Oh no…\" Turbo whimpered while slowly and reluctantly turning around to see what kind of cage they put him in. the cage was rather large, especially for a snail, and it could probably fit ten adults inside; the cage was also dimly lit, but it was also covered in real soil, it was full of real forest trees and other vegetation, along with real tomato vines, plump with ripe tomatoes, that were growing up the sides of most trees. But as Turbo just stood there, looking around with wide eyes and almost hyperventilating, he was unaware that he was being watched by one of the many hidden cameras in the cage, and the ones watching him were Beth and Tito, who were sitting up in a small private room with windows that over looked the cage, and they were sitting in front of a desk with a tablet of many buttons and multiple computer screens projecting different parts of the cage at a time. \"Are you sure he'll be ok?\" Tito soon asked out of concern when his little snail buddy wouldn't move. \"Of course, of course! He just needs a little push,\" Beth replied while pressing a button on the panel, and that caused a few more lights in the cage to light up, bringing more light to it. The increase in light soon decreased Turbo's apprehension, and he gulped down some fear while moving forward slowly, towards a thick tree root that grew over a small and calm water stream. \"H-hello?\" Turbo called meekly while slithering over the root bridge. \"Hello?\" he called once more when he got to the other side of the stream, but he gasped when he heard what sounded like a pebble fall…from the treetops? An that same pebble somehow rolled in front of him…as if to get his attention. Was this a trick? But before Turbo could answer that question, something else suddenly dropped from above…and it wasn't a pebble. Turbo gasped once more, but it was with amazement; what was now in front of him was a female snail with dark red skin, like that of a red rose, she had bright red eyes, her shell was shiny like amber, and her body was short and fit. The Indy Five Hundred winner could only sit there and stare lustfully at who he could assume was Pam herself, and she there, just staring back in silence. She's…she's just…wow…I mean, what were they even talking about? She's like an angel, Turbo thought to himself, but that's when he noticed Pam glaring at him. An angel who's angry? Turbo asked himself in his head, but it all made sense when Pam suddenly whipped her whole body around to knock the pebble right into Turbo's face, knocking the wind out of him. And he was suddenly brought down when Pam pounced him and stood on her throat. \"Intruso! Tu chi sei?!\" Pam growled, but Turbo only replied with a bunch of strained gurgles. \"Che cosa?\" Pam asked with a cocked eyebrow. \"You're…standing…on my throat…\" \"Oh, you're an American,\" Pam said with shock while finally releasing Turbo, and he stood back up while taking deep breaths in. \"Thanks…ahem, thank you…I need my throat for talking and breathing, so thanks,\" Turbo coughed sarcastically. \"Whatever. Listen, we don't have a lot of time,\" Pam whispered while getting uncomfortably too close for Turbo. \"W-what?\" Turbo whimpered, but before he knew it, Pam suddenly wrapped an eye stock around his and started dragging him to the other side of the cage. \"Wait a minute! Wait a minute!\" Turbo demanded, and out of curiosity, Pam decided to stop. \"Why? What's the hold up? Besides, I'm ready to go, NOW,\" Pam said with excitement, and then she slithered off behind a tree. \"Oh, um…right! like Smoove said: be a confident love bug, be a confident love bug,\" Turbo whispered to himself repeatedly while grinning and following Pam. \"Alright, now…\" Pam began, but when she turned, she was greeted with a puckered-lips Turbo, so she knocked him back, \"whoa, what are you doing?!\" \"Well, I was…uh…for argument's sake, what are YOU doing?\" Turbo asked frantically. \"I'M trying to escape,\" Pam replied while pushing back a bunch of tomatoes out of the way, revealing a vent with openings too small for a snail the fit through, but there were some noticeable dents in one corner of the bars. \"Oh, right, yes…that's…that's EXACTLY what I was going with,\" Turbo laughed in relief. \"No, wait a second…you ACTUALLY thought I was going to kiss you, didn't you?!\" Pam asked matter-of-factly. \"Well, I was-.\" \"Are you crazy?! We just met!\" As their fight went on, Tito and Beth noticed the angry vibes between Turbo and Pam, and they could tell things weren't going so well, even though they couldn't understand what they were saying. \"Umm, Beth…?\" Tito urged. \"I got it,\" Beth whispered and pressed a different button. \"Yes, I know what my shell looks like, but I swear, I'm NOT pea cocking!\" Turbo protested while looking back at his decorative racing shell. But before Pam could argue against that, some music from the overhead intercom started to play…and it was Beyonce's \"Crazy in Love.\" Turbo could only shrink into his shell a little in shock. \"I have NOTHING to do with that…huh, but it is kinda nice,\" Turbo said with awkwardness at first, but then he like the song, and even started singing along. \"'Got me lookin' so crazy right now. Your love's got me lookin' so crazy in love'…yeah, sing it, Beyonce.\" But as Turbo sang, Pam could only stare in disappointed wide eyes and a slack jaw, and she soon couldn't stand anymore, so she once again lunged at him. The two snails were unfortunate to be pulled down a slant by gravity, and they landed in a tall patched of flowers and grass. \"Wow…that went faster than I expected,\" Tito admitted with surprise while scratching the back of his head. \"Beyonce. Works EVERY time,\" Beth boasted, but then she stood up from her chair and lowered her voice, \"we should give them some privacy.\" Tito looked back at the computer screen before reluctantly leaving the room with Beth. \"I-I don't really wanna leave my little amigo here alone,\" Tito pointed out with worry. \"Oh, don't worry. We have guard professional guards and well trained dogs patrolling. Besides, who better to protect him than Pam?\" Beth joked. Little did Beth and Tito know that Pam and Turbo weren't 'doing the deed'…in fact, Pam was actually perched up on a branch while pelting many rocks and pebbles at Turbo with precise aim, and Turbo had to use his speed to dodge everything…even if he failed most of the time. And while Turbo was fleeing, he soon noticed one of the hidden cameras in a tree trunk hallow, and he sped up to the lens. \"HELP ME!\" Turbo pleaded into the camera, but Pam soon found him again, and she threw another rock, and she not only hit him again, but the impact of the rock to the back of Turbo's head knocked him into the lens, smearing mucus all over it before he slid off in pain. Well, you guys really, and I mean REALLY wanted me to continue this story, so here ya go. And I'm sorry I kept you guys waiting so long. I've just been pretty busy with stuff, ya know? Everyone's busy with stuff, right? But I'll try to update again sooner. Until the next chapter, I'm TRikiD, bye-bye! ","Summary":" Ok, so I didn't know where I was going with Turbo Love, so I decided to delete it, rewrite it as a "},{"Movie":"Turbo","Title":"Moving Faster","Author":"fanfictiongoddess","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10316451","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Room B was fairly sparse compared to the rest of the physical therapy center. Turbo had spent most of his time in the gym filled with equipment to help him strengthen the muscles that had fallen into weakness during his recovery in the burn ward. He was just lucky that most of the burns had not scarred his face. When he looked in the mirror these days his blue eyed and short, brown haired self stared back at him without scratches of scar. His shoulders and back were dotted with a few splotches and he would be sensitive about them for some time to come. But he was glad he could cover them up. Other then that he really he was improving. He could now move about with one crutch, unaided. Even so his walking speed was not what it usually was. Every step was agonizingly slow to him. Moving so slow was not something Turbo enjoyed. Ever since he could remember Turbo had been obsessed with racing around and being involved in high adrenaline activities. His brother, Chet, could tell so many stories of stupid stunts Turbo had done. Such as the great hang glide off the roof of the house escapade. He had really thought the kite would make a good hang glider. Poor Chet. The crash at the race was just one more accident to play over and over in his head. Turbo himself didn't remember too much about the crash to be honest. Only that the barrier came up too fast. And at some point Chet was standing over him, screaming his name and tears in his eyes. Turbo had thought then that he truly was going to die. Turbo was brought out of his thoughts by a voice calling out to him. \"Excuse me sir. But I assume you're here for the group counseling session.\" a man with a clipboard asked. \"Oh, didn't see you I'm here for the group counseling. I'm Turbo.\" Turbo said. The man glanced at the clipboard a moment and frowned slightly. \"I don't see a Turbo here. I have a Theo but-\" \"That's me. I must have signed up while on those pain drugs. I mean Theo is, or rather was, my name. I prefer Turbo actually,If you could call me that in the future-\" Turbo started to say. \"Not a problem. I'll make a note of it. For the moment take any seat. Right now it's only you and another patient. The rest of the group should be here soon.\" the consoler said. \"Thank you.\" Turbo said as he stepped over to the circle of chairs. That was when he noticed the other guy. The other person in the room was tall. Turbo could tell even though he was sitting down. He also had an aura of toughness. As if he could take on five people at once. His choice of dark green clothing help add to the aura. There was almost a glow to the mans eyes. That could had been from the tint of his yellow tinted glasses. His teeth seemed a bit on the strange side too. Like they've been filed into points. Not that Turbo had never heard of people doing that to their teeth and he wasn't one to normally judge. Still he couldn't help but wonder things about the teeth such as what would happen if he accidently bit his tongue with them? The man was fiddling with his cell phone. Perhaps fiddling was not the right word. Rather he was tapping the screen hard. Turbo could hear the tapping from where he stood. \"Ugh! Stupid phone!\" the man grunted. He shook the phone violently as if that would make it work. It didn't given the way the man scowled when he stopped shaking it. Turbo took the a seat next to the man. At first the man didn't even look up at Turbo. He was far too involved with his phone. Turbo couldn't help but take a glance at the phone. The screen was dark and not responding to the mans tapping. Turbo decided now was a good time to be helpful. \"Did you try pressing the on button?\" Turbo asked. The taller man snorted in derision. But then he paused a moment. Obviously he thought about it and tried Turbo's suggestion. The screen came to life, showing a background of a deep orange and black motorcycle as the screen background. \"You have got to be kidding me.\" the man said to himself with a hint of disappointment in himself. \"Happens to all of us. Don't worry about it. I'm Turbo by the way.\" Turbo greeted, offering a hand to shake. The man looked to the hand then looked back at Turbo. He spoke without shaking Turbos hand. \"I'm Hardcase. And Yeah, I know who you are. I've seen you on t.v before.\" the man grunted. \"Oh well, yeah. Winning the indy five hundred and all. You a fan?\" Turbo asked, hand still offered. Hardcase snorted again, this time with even more disdain. \"Hardy.I don't think you're that great.\" Hardcase said. \"In fact I think you suck.\"[Chapter 2] That hadn't been what Turbo expected to hear. At the very least he had expected to hear neutral words. But the tone the taller man had spoke of a hostility directed at him. It made him pull back the hand he had offered to shake. \"Is there a particular reason why you think I suck?\" Turbo asked, a curious look on his face. Hardcase rolled his eyes as if it was the most obvious thing in the world. \"For starters everyone is always talking about how you're the fastest racer ever. That's all I ever hear. Doesn't help that I see your face on everything. Sellout much?\" Hardcase asked. Turbo frowned a moment. \"So basically you're jealous.\" Turbo said. \"I am not!\" Hardcase snapped a little too quickly. \"I'm just sick of seeing you're stupid face. Last time i got into a fight someone hit me with a sidewalk sign that had your face on it.\" It slowly dawned on Turbo that Hardcase was not exactly the most model of citizens. Something about the way he spoke about fights so off handedly and generally spoke were signs of that. And though clothes didn't always make the man, his attire suggested someone trying to look tough. Thinking on it, he realised he recognized some of the patches on the left arm of the jacket. Particularly the tiger shaped one. \"Wait, I think I know you.\" Turbo said. \"Whoop de doo.\" Hardcase grumbled. \"You're that one racer who's been in the news before. And not for very nice things either.\" Turbo said. Hardcase shrugged, not looking bothered at all by Turbo's description of him. If anything the slight smirk suggested he was proud. \"What can I say? I'm a bad boy.\" Hardcase said. \"A bad boy that gets the racing federation fined all the time. I honestly don't know where you get off thinking thats okay.\" Turbo said. Hardcase laughed a deep, guttural laugh and crossed his arms before speaking. \"And I don't know where you got the idea that I care what you think.\" Hardcase \"Well, that much is clear. Tell me, how do you manage to not get arrested when you cause so much trouble?\" Turbo asked. \"Never said I never got arrested. I'm just able to pay bail easily.\" Hardcase said. \"Now how about you go be peppy somewhere else? Like another continent.\" Hardcase snapped. \"Oh yeah? How about you go somewhere else too. Like uhh… another planet? Which I wouldn't go to afterward and see your face again.\" Hardcase rolled his eyes. Turbo had to admit that wasn't the best comeback. \"Yeah, well… who said you were invited to my planet in the first place?\" Hardcase said. The conversation spiraled down from there. To the point where both were yelling at each other. Given Hardcase's clenched fists it looked as if violence was about to erupt. Thankfully the twos raised voices attracted attention from the counselor who had just entered the room. \"Is something wrong here?\" the counselor asked. \"Just this jerk being a jerk.\" Turbo said, eyes still fixed on Hardcase. \"Is that your best insult? Here's one for you. You're a-\" \"Oh look, everyone else is here!\" the counselor said loudly. He didn't give Turbo and Hardcase time to continue their argument as he ushered in the rest of the group to their seats. Turbo made a point of changing his seat before any of the other seats further away from Hardcase were taken. Hardcase leaned back into his chair and continued to glare at Turbo They still gave each other dirty looks time to time. The counselor made a good show of ignoring them while wandering into their line of sight as a subtle way to tell them to knock it off. This usually lead to Hardcase grumbling something under his breath. After all that, Turbo couldn't really blame the counselor for lingering on a few other patients rather than get to Hardcase or Turbo quickly. Eventually though the counselor spoke to Hardcase. \"Do you wish to share anything tonight Hardcase? You've said relatively little since you've come here and quite frankly I'm a bit concerned.\" His arms were still folded in a defensive posture, though his voice was slightly less hostile than it had been when he had spoken to Turbo. \"No. I have nothing to share.\" he said eveningly. The counselor's mouth set into a straight line as he glanced down to his clipboard. \"Are you sure?\" he asked. Hardcase said nothing. There was no further challenge from the counselor and he moved on to Turbo. The parking lot of the therapy center was mostly empty by time Hardcase got to it. It was as he hoped it would be. He didn't need an audience right now. Not when he was about to go through his own personal trial in a moment. In truth he hated the consoling group. Why he would want to tell anyone about just how bad he was doing? That he was at his weakest. It just seemed like the worst thing in the world for him. Yet the doctors had suggested the idea after he told them about the nightmares. His own crash still stuck in his mind. No matter how many times he tried to just wave it away the memory persisted. Like a splinter in his brain. Non Removable and unable to ignore. Tires screeching sounded like pained screams, sparks as his car grazed the side of the concrete of the turn before he smashed into the back of another car. The driver of the other car had survived as well thank goodness. He did not need a death to add to his worries. No one had called out his name. Oh sure people were concerned and worked quickly to save him from the wreck and get him medical care. But there was also the lack of anyone who really knew him there. The whole thing had been very unemotional. And that stuck with Hardcase more than he would like to admit. All his recovery time so far he had pondered if anyone actually was happy he survived. He was alive yet he wasn't happy. That thought was terrifying to him and he tried to shove the thought aside., only to have it pop up again in the night after a terror fueled nightmare. Which was why he had taken to hanging out with some old buddies come the night. Only at places he could walk to or get a ride to though. He had tried to get back in a car months ago. It wasn't even a race car. Just a everyday car that's main function was just to get the rider from place A to place B. Simple and safer than racing at high speeds. Even so Hardcase was anxious. Just like he was with every vehicle these days. So much so he had not truly driven for about a year now. Not since the accident. His car hadn't left the parking lot since then either. Hopefully tonight would not be another walking home night. Steeling himself he got into the car. That in itself was a feat for himself. Even harder was to close the car door. After the slam of the door closing made him jump a little, he allowed himself a few minutes to calm down. Drumming his fingers nervously on the dashboard he breathed deeply and slowly. At first he thought he was doing fine. And hope was there for a moment. Then it was dashed as he carefully gripped the wheel. His fingers were already shaking even as he held onto it. They kept shaking even as he deluded himself a moment that he had this under control. Then it hit. His heart started beating too fast. At least Hardcase was convinced it was. His doctor had told him that panic attacks could feel like that. At first the suggestion of panic attacks had seemed ridiculous to him when the doctor warned it was possible. Now he wasn't laughing. His breaths came out in quick gasps. Far too quick and soon Hardcase was a bit lightheaded. Even so he refused to let of the wheel just yet. Even if It felt just like when he was dying. That didn't last long though as his pounding heart finally convinced he couldn't do this. Hardcase let go of the wheel like it was on fire. His breaths came out ragged and for a moment he thought he was going to faint. Somehow he was able to keep from blacking out and opened the door. He didn't jump out just yet. Instead Hardcase leaned his face against the wheel, mentally and physically exhausted. Too drained to really even care if anyone did see him like this. Even if he felt like crying. He didn't care. Because it seemed no matter what he did he would never drive again. ","Summary":" Room B was fairly sparse compared to the rest of the physical therapy center.

The little snail fel so loved by his peers and seeing Whiplash smile was the perfect way to brighten his day even more. \"Well, Me and White Shadow are gonna have a little private time\" Chet said to the two before leaving the lovebirds \"So, how did you find out that you were pregnant? He asked. \"It all started when I was in the final lap, I felt a little pain on my underside but I had to keep going until I won\" he paused as he started to feel sickliness \"I'm gonna go lay down for a big\" He had gone to his bed which was just an Chinese takeout-box with long streamers Tito had put at the top from his birthday party last week. Each time he went though, it felt smooth, sliding against his skin and he laid down on his side with his head against the wall. Whiplash came on side but Theo just closed his eyes. \"Are you okay, baby? He approached him with a worried face. \"I'm fine\" He said after sniffing. He tucked and rolled over in front of him then popped out again to notice that his life-partner had tears in his eyes. \"Is something wrong? He asked \"don't try and deny it neither. Theo leaned up and wholly admitted to his crying and what was he weeping about which Whiplash just got close and extended his neck for his mate to get under then wrapped it up. \"It's alright, you'll be a great mother\" He shushed him. \"Why am I'm the one who's pregnant? He questioned \"I'm still younger then you\" He stated then they parted \"I understand but isn't this what you wanted? He asked shocked. \"Of course, I love you very much and wish for us to be a family\" The small snail said then felt happy again but he may need some help with caring for his egg (0) Chet and his boyfriend were just talking about in they would ever consider having an egg as well, White Shadow just plainly blurted out a yes response. \"Really, your not gonna even think about this\" He asked quite surprised. The large sail just shook his head \"Not one bit\" he looked at him \"your femininity says it all\" He smiled. Chet just blushed on the inside, it always bothered him when folks think that he very much resembles a female at the sight of him but is took him right now to finally see why, it's his curves which stand out but give him some eye-lashes and BAM. \"Wow, you think that huh? Chet asked in depression.\"You bet, we had our very first kiss when your young brother won.\"I spun you around then I looked deep into your eyes\" He explained. Chet couldn't believe that his boyfriend could think that of him but he dose possess the appearance, it's no wonder that those male snails were hitting on him, talking about his curves, it was just something that he had to admit to himself about being special. \"Thank you\" It was all he said before the two shared a long kiss. Burn showed up right in the middle of it and caught Chet's eye so he pulled away. \"Burn, what're you doing here? He asked his ex. \"Oh, I thought that I should congratulate you and White Shadow's relationship\" She said looking at him, went over and kissed his cheek. \"So, what're you two gonna do now. They looked at each other \"Well, we were thinking of having an egg of our own\" White Shadow claimed. Chet still had to look after his baby brother but Whiplash got that handled and proved his worth so he had his blessing. (0) Theo and his bad boy were cuddling together \"You should get some sleep\" He said and Theo nodded, snuggled on in to get comfy while Whiplash covered him up with his warmth. Tito was taking a break from his taco truck driving and practiced his accordion \"Meh, might as well\" He said putting his hand through the holders before playing. Whiplash heard the sweet sounding music and got his neck off of his mate \"What is that? He said blinking slowly twice as he drew closer \"beautiful sound? He heard the notes play a love song through his ears and felt like tearing up. It was about Tito's love for his job and his brother. Whiplash sniffed a little and looked back at the orange snail. It was so emotional to him, even for a big tough guy. \"I believe in our future\" He said in regards to his boyfriend. His eyes were filled with hope and allowed the song to take over him, it was passionate yet full of foreverness. Tito turned around and smiled when he saw that the black snail was moving his head from side to side. \"Oh, you like that? He asked while playing then walking right up to him so he could get a much better listen. The guy smiled and saw his little snail friend sleeping then looked at the black one, he could've done more research cause he was so sure that he and that blue snail were a couple unless they broke up and didn't know it or he missed it. Sorry I'm late but you know how it is with me being random, this chapter is more passionate and heartfelt then the last. For the record, I know what an accordion is as well as México, I didn't include any songs in the native language cause I don't know any.

So... I've never actually written anything like this before, and I'm sorry if it's too unoriginal since there are already several Turbo snippet/one-shot collection things on here. I'm not trying to copy anyone. I just thought it might be kinda fun to do one of these, and it'll give me something to write while I'm trying to get past the writer's block that I've been having lately. x'D Yes, I will be taking prompts for this. Actually, prompts would be appreciated, since I've been so uncreative for the past little while. I will take prompts involving pretty much anything, as long as it doesn't raise the rating above a K+ or possibly a T. If for whatever reason I can't write your prompt, I'll let you know, but I'm pretty sure that won't be a problem, so... on to the first one-shot! :P[Chapter 2] This one is a Halloween-ish type thing. It's two days late, I know, but... here you go! xD (It's an idea I've had in mind for a while, but it was originally supposed to be a full-length story.) Oh, and keep in mind that in the Turbo FAST universe, worms are the snail equivalent of dogs. Kinda weird, but... enjoy! \"Vampire Worm\" \"There we go.\" Turbo set down his carving tool and smiled; he looked proudly at the ripe cherry tomato he had just carved into a jack-o-lantern. Chet glanced across the table, smirking. \"Very artistic,\" he said sarcastically, glancing at the tomato's jagged teeth and lopsided eyes. \"Hey!\" Turbo retorted. \"Could you do better?\" Chet's expression suddenly turned grave. \"It's a highly unsafe tradition, anyway. I'll never understand why anyone would risk chopping their eyestalks off with a knife just to give a piece of fruit a pretty face.\" Turbo rolled his eyes. Leave it to his safety-obsessed brother to find the depressingly dangerous side of everything. It was Halloween night, and the FAST crew was in the clubhouse, gathered around a table made out of a matchbox, carving tomatoes and drinking apple cider (with a drop of ketchup stirred in, of course.) Suddenly, the doorbell rang, cutting into everyone's thoughts. Whiplash hopped out of his chair. \"More trick-or-treaters, I bet.\" the purple snail muttered, reaching reluctantly for the candy bucket. The crew's leader didn't quite see the point in handing out perfectly good candy to random kids dressed in weird costumes. Turbo slid over to the door and opened it, expecting to see a herd of excited young snails holding up their bags. But all he could see was the dark night sky, glittering with stars; tree branches clawed at the full moon, and the calm, misty night air fluttered into the clubhouse. Turbo felt goosebumps prick his skin. \"Who's there?\" he called out warily. Suddenly, something emerged from the mist; it was a small green worm, wagging its tail and panting. It let out a happy bark, its brown eyes shining. \"Well, hello there!\" Turbo exclaimed, reaching over to give the worm a pat on the head. \"Where did you come from?\" At that point, Chet, Skidmark, Smoove Move, White Shadow, and Burn had all dropped what they were doing and gathered by the door. \"It's a puppy!\" White Shadow said excitedly. \"Aww!\" cooed Burn. The worm leaped up, balancing on its hind legs, to give Turbo a lick on the face. Turbo chuckled, petting it. \"Yo, who do you think he belongs to?\" Smoove asked in his usual smooth tone. Turbo glanced at the worm. \"No collar,\" he reported. For a moment everyone was silent, glancing at one another; no one said a word, but a million unspoken thoughts seemed to flash between the snails. Suddenly, Whiplash slammed down the candy bowl, his eyes dark with irritation. \"Uh-uh, no way.\" the crew's leader grumbled. \"We are not keeping him.\" Turbo hugged the worm close, looking offended. \"B- but it's cold and dark out there!\" he blurted. \"Whip, are you really gonna be heartless enough to send him away, on Halloween, when anything can happen?\" Chet's eyes widened. \"Yeah... anything, \" he repeated with a shudder. Whiplash stood his ground. \"I meant what I said,\" he declared. \"I put my tail down, and it's gonna stay that way.\" Turbo hugged the worm closer. \"I'd be responsible!\" he pleaded. \"I'd take him for walks and clean up after him and feed him, and...\" Whiplash hesitated, then shook his head; he was trying to look decisive, but Turbo could tell he was weakening. The FAST crew huddled around Turbo and the worm, their eyes growing huge; fake tears pricked the corners of everyone's eyes. Finally, Whiplash groaned and looked away. \"Fine! We'll keep him - but only for a little while. Would you just stop with those eyes?!\" Everyone cheered triumphantly. Even the worm hopped from snail to snail, its tail wagging in a green blur. The worm bounded over to Skidmark, giving the blue snail a lick on the face. Skid chuckled, but when the creature backed up, his expression suddenly grew serious. \"Guys... something's not right about this worm.\" Skidmark said, frowning. Burn glanced over at him, looking irritated. \"Let me guess - you're getting 'a bad feeling' about it. Sorta like the almond milk incident.\" \"Hey, how was I supposed to know the milk came from cows and not almonds?\" Skid flashed back. Then he glanced at the worm. \"...But yeah, kinda.\" Smoove rolled his eyes. \"C'mon, Skid. It's just your average, everyday worm.\" \"It has fangs!\" Skid cried. Turbo peered closer; sure enough, sharp teeth curled from the worm's top lip. \"Pretty sure those are just teeth.\" Smoove muttered. \"Hey - that gave me a great idea!\" Burn called out. \"We should name him Fang!\" The FAST crew all started chattering excitedly. \"No!\" Skidmark cried out. \"You guys are missing the point! This isn't just a normal worm! It's a vampire worm - and it's going to turn us all into its bloodsucking minions!\" Skid turned his panicked gaze on Turbo. \"You believe me... don't you?!\" Turbo shook his head sadly. \"Sorry, Skidmark, but Smoove's right. Fang's just a regular worm.\" The orange snail turned his attention back to the worm; the rest of the crew were still fawning over him. Fang rolled onto his back, exposing his stomach; Turbo scratched it, unaware that Skidmark was creeping out of the room, his eyes darting back and forth suspiciously. The next morning, Turbo poured a bag of worm kibble into Fang's bowl; the worm was wagging his tail excitedly, and dove straight for the food once Turbo set the bag down. Chuckling, Turbo turned to leave the room; then he jumped back with a startled cry. He hadn't known that Skidmark had been standing right behind him, eyeing the hungry worm and his breakfast. \"You might as well save your worm chow,\" Skid commented darkly. \"He doesn't want that. Why don't you pour some fresh blood into his water dish? He'll take it straight from the source anyway, whether you like it or not.\" Turbo sighed. \"Skid, can we drop that already? He's clearly not a vampire.\" \"That's what you think,\" Skidmark whispered, then turned and slid out of the room. Later that day, Turbo was sitting in the main part of the clubhouse, chatting with the other crew members. Everything seemed peaceful and quiet, until Skidmark slid into the room. \"Oh, hey Skid,\" Turbo called to his friend; but something seemed unusual about the blue snail. His eyes were dull and glassy, and as soon as he entered the room, he fell onto the floor. \"Skidmark!\" Turbo yelped, hurrying over to his side. The rest of the crew followed; when they reached him, Skid began to writhe and flail around on the floor like a fish out of water. \"It was the worm!\" Skid hissed, his eyes growing wild. \"Blood loss! Blood loss!\" For the first time, Turbo noticed two identical red spots on Skidmark's neck: bite marks. Horror struck deep into his heart. \"We were wrong!\" Burn gasped, tears forming in her eyes. \"Fang really is a vampire!\" \" He did this!\" Smoove's eyes were wide with shock and dismay. \"I knew I never should have let that beast stay here!\" Whiplash cried out. The horror-stricken murmuring of the FAST crew was suddenly broken by the sound of Skidmark's laughter. He leaped up off the floor, snickering. \"I got you guys good!\" he jeered, pulling a red marker out of his shell. \"Skid - what?!\" Turbo gaped, confusion making him speechless. \"You mean you never believed that worm was a vampire?\" Whiplash glared at the blue snail, anger sparking in his gaze. \"Wha-? No way!\" Skidmark laughed. \"That's crazy talk! Who'd ever believe a thing like that?\" The FAST crew exchanged glances. \" You. \" White Shadow pointed out. \" Pfft, \" Skidmark scoffed. \"Worms as vampires? You'd have to be some kind of paranoid spaz to ever - \" Skid trailed off, his eyes growing round; Turbo followed his gaze and noticed White Shadow munching on a bag of bacon-flavored popcorn. \"THE APOCALYPSE HAS BEGUN!\" Skidmark yelled; he began speeding around the clubhouse, knocking chairs and trophies over in his alarm. \"QUICK - EVERYBODY, GET UNDER A DESK!\" Turbo watched Skid for a few moments before rolling his eyes. \"Yup. You'd have to be a paranoid spaz, all right.\"[Chapter 3] A/N: First off, I'd like to thank everyone who left reviews. Your input really motivates me to keep writing. :D I will get to everyone's prompts eventually, but I'm not necessarily going to go in order, just so that I can get stuff posted right after it's been written. This one is based off a prompt requested by guest user TurboFan, who wanted something involving the 'Turdmark' pairing. Hope you like it! ^^ (Warning: Contains a same-gender (slash) pairing between Turbo and Skidmark. If you don't like it, you know how to close the page. No flaming, please.) Rain. Rain was everywhere, pouring from the sky in silvery sheets and hitting the ground in cold, wet plops. Skidmark sighed, sloshing through a puddle; misty droplets sprayed his face, but he didn't care. He didn't seem to care about much of anything anymore. His brain was in a jumble, and he didn't quite understand why. Something new had taken hold of his mind; it seemed that his heart was always racing much too fast, and his tongue was always tied in a knot. No, not always. Only when one snail was around, one snail in particular: Turbo. Skidmark didn't understand it, but every time he was around the orange snail, he found himself tripping over his words, blushing uncontrollably. It just didn't make sense. They'd been friends for quite a while now, so why did he suddenly feel like he was seeing Turbo for the first time? Skidmark slid over to the small window on the side of the clubhouse. Rubbing off some of the moisture with an eyestalk, he pressed his face to the glass and peered inside. The sound of the downpour seemed to fade into the background once he saw Turbo; the orange snail was smiling, talking happily with Whiplash and Smoove Move. Skid couldn't help but notice the way Turbo's eyes sparkled whenever he was excited about something, sort of like blue diamonds held up to the light. Stop it! he told himself sharply, backing away from the window. He doesn't feel the same way about you. Never has, never will. Skidmark sighed. No matter how badly he wanted it, Turbo would never see him as anything more than a teammate and a friend. Heart aching, the blue snail slumped down next to the clubhouse wall, still not bothering to take shelter from the rain. He was getting soaked, but he didn't care. It would be far worse to go inside and face Turbo, who knew nothing of the emotions he always kept bottled inside. I'm better off out here, Skid thought. He was there for several minutes before the door slid open. Skidmark looked up; instantly his heart began pounding and his face started to burn. Turbo! What's he doing out here?! The orange snail was carrying something; as he got closer, Skid realized that it was a snail-sized blanket, made out of a scrap of turquoise fabric. His first thought was that the shade of the cloth matched Turbo's eyes perfectly; then he shoved the thought away, remembering that Tito had given the blanket to Turbo in the days before Starlight City had been built. It was one of the orange snail's most treasured possessions, and for a heartbeat Skidmark wondered why he'd brought it out here in the rain, risking that it might get ruined by mud and water. \"What are you doing out here?\" Turbo demanded; once he got close enough, he threw the blanket over both himself and Skidmark, shielding them from the rain. Skid's face began to burn; he was close enough to Turbo to hear the beating of the other snail's heart. And in that very second, Skidmark knew that there was no way he could keep the intense emotions he felt towards his friend bottled up any longer. \"Why don't you come into the clubhouse and get dried off? This is crazy, even for you.\" Turbo's voice snapped Skidmark out of his thoughts. Skid shook his head quickly. \"No - I mean... that is -\" Turbo tilted his head in confusion. \"Skid, what are you trying to say?\" Skidmark let out a long sigh. \"I... I need to tell you something.\" he murmured, dropping his voice to a whisper. Turbo nodded, his light blue-green eyes sparkling; he was clearly ready to listen to anything his friend had to say. The pounding of the rain and the rumble of thunder in the distance faded into the background, and Skidmark forced himself to make eye contact. \"Turbo, I...\" Skid trailed off, then took a deep breath. There was no way he could back out now, not when he was so close to telling Turbo how he really felt about him. \"...I love you.\" he blurted out. Instantly Turbo's eyes widened in shock, then his expression changed to something Skid couldn't recognize, halfway in between horror and excitement. He's going to reject me! Skidmark instantly wished he could take his confession back. His mouth opened to apologize, but somehow he couldn't make the words come out. Finally, he managed to choke out: \"I... I'm sorry... I know you don't feel the same way, but - \" Turbo's eyes suddenly softened. \"Skid... I... I feel exactly the same way.\" he murmured. \"I've loved you since day one, but I... I guess I just never knew how to tell you. I guess... I guess I was just afraid.\" Shock washed over Skidmark like a wave, and he felt as if the breath had been knocked out of him. \"...You... you love me?!\" he stuttered. Turbo nodded, his turquoise gaze brimming with emotion. \"Of course,\" he said softly. \"Why else do you think I let you lead me into a giant albino spider's cave to track aliens, or helped you tranquilize a great white goldfish, or always had your back whenever someone called you crazy?\" Skidmark smiled, his eyes filling with tears. He was too wrapped in emotion to think of a response, but words weren't necessary. He leaned in for a hug, happiness flaming in his heart as he embraced the orange snail. Suddenly, Turbo drew back. \"Shouldn't we go inside?\" Skidmark blinked. He'd been so lost in the moment, he had forgotten all about the rainstorm raging on outside. But the two of them were perfectly sheltered under the blanket. Skidmark shook his head, smiling. \"Come to think of it, I kinda like it out here.\" A smile crossed Turbo's face. \"Me, too.\" As the two snails huddled together under the blanket, oblivious to the pounding rain outside, Skidmark leaned close to Turbo. \"I love you.\" he murmured. \"I love you, too.\" ","Summary":" Important A/N:: Hey everyone.

I though it was a cute movie and made this oneshot so here it is. disclaimer: I don't own any characters in Avalon high \"That's going to have to take some getting used to\" I said looking down incredulously at Marco who was kneeling before me. I noticed a small smirk gracing his lips as he stood up. \"Umm I'm just going to go back and finish watching the game\" Miles said shuffling out the room awkwardly before I could even begin to protest. I was going to have to yell at him later for leaving me behind with Marco in what seemed like a silence that could last say a 1000 years. \"Sooo..\" he said walking over to me stiffly. \"Soooo….\" I replied back looking down at my sneakers tense. \"I should be apologizing.\" He started. \"No I should apologize to you\" I said a little too quickly looking up at him. I treated him like crap and accused him of being Mordrid when really he was only trying to help. \"No you shouldn't your highness. Look, I said and did some mean things to you while trying to protect my brother and for that I'm really sorry. Believe me I feel horrible for not realizing that you are the reincarnation of Arthur and not being able to protect you. I really screwed up and I will leave upon your word to take responsibility for my actions.\" \"Slow down, we both screwed up Marco. I'm sorry for accusing you of being Mordrid when you were only trying to help. I'm just getting to know you as one of my knights so how can I have you leave now. I mean seriously we left you outside hurt and you still came back and pushed Mr. Moore off stage.\" \"Don't say that so casually\" He laughed \"Though, it was the highlight of the night for me. Actually no realizing you were Arthur is still number one\" \"That was a highlight for me as well considering I didn't know I was Arthur either\" I smiled. \"Well your highne-\" \"Just call me Allie\" \"No that would be disrespectful\" \"So is not following your highnesses orders\" I countered. I watched as he tried to sort out what was right to do in his head and I ended up laughing. He frowned looking down at me. \"Sorry, you just take this too seriously. Just because I'm Arthur doesn't mean you have to follow everything I say Marco. I trust that you and I will be good friends but we can't be friends if you put me above you\" \"No but it would work if we dated; you'd be my girlfriend so I could treat you specially\" I coughed what did he just say? \"Your highn- I mean Allie are you okay? \" He placed his hands on my shoulder leaning into examine me. \"Um yeah I'm good\" I lied. My face was completely flushed scarlet and now the idea of me dating Marco was drifting through my mind. His hands were still on my shoulders and I looked up to find his face was extremely close to mine. He looked concerned it was really kinda cute and I couldn't help but take advantage of the moment. I don't know why I did it but my lips were on his. My mind was chanting you like Will you like Will what are you doing. Marco's lips felt really good on mine though. It was sort of warm and a bit gentle something I would have never pictured from him but he was full of surprises today. Running out of air we both pulled away. \"I was kidding when I said we should date but…\" this time he moved in capturing my lips again and we started all over. This time his hands moved from my shoulders to my waist and my hands came up to his hair playing with it squeezing lightly. Soon he had me backed up against the theatre door and when I gasped he slid his tongue inside my mouth exploring. We battled for dominance and it seemed I was winning when he backed off and let me take control. I was confused when he pulled away fast. \"We can't do this\" he said looking down and shaking his head. \"Why?\" I asked confused. \"Well for one you are making me a little excited?\" He glanced down at his pants then back into my eyes I could have flushed from embarrassment if my check weren't already stained red from the kiss. \"Two, you like WILL and he already went through Jen and Lance screwing him over so we definitely can't\" \"Oh yeah Will… I do like him but…\" I trailed off wanting to say that I liked him more. Kissing Marco felt so incredibly right that there must be something wrong with me. Will was really sweet though and I wasn't sure if I'd be able to do this to him. I mean we weren't legitimately dating but it seemed it was going there. \"See you can't hurt him like this\" Marco said softly reading my mind. \"I got it but I also don't want to hurt you like this\" \"I'll be fine\" he reassured. \"Are you really going to be?\" I searched his eyes \"Because If I were you I might have trouble seeing my brother with a girl who enjoyed kissing me\" He smirked \"So you enjoyed that?\" \"well…yeah\" I admitted honestly avoiding his gaze. \"So did I\" he disclosed. He shifted back and forth on his feet nervously before he spoke again. \"Allie I see your point and you're right I would be jealous but still I can't\" \"Okay I understand\" I was going to take a step back and create some distance between us but I was already leaning against the door. \"Marco\" I said placing my hand on the knob so I could make a swift exit. \"Yes Allie\" he replied. \"You're a really good brother and knight. After today I want you to know that I'll act like this\" I pointed between us indicating what went on here \"never occurred\" I finished. \"I understand\" he said with a melancholy smile that twisted my heart and made me want to retract my statement.

Wait, WHAT ? An Avalon High One-shot parody by LucyCrewe11 \"Quick, Allie, lip gloss,\" Miles said out of the corner of his mouth, quickly getting out of the way. \"What?\" blurted Allie, in the confused half-second before Will suddenly came swooping in, kissing her on the mouth. It was a sweet, lingering sort of kiss, just what Allie had been longing for since she'd first met Will at the water fountain. She'd known him in two lives, and they'd talked about politics, law, and football (probably swords and armor, back in Camelot) so -in this case- love at first sight wasn't weird at all (no, seriously, it wasn't, this actually makes sense... somehow ...). Everything was wonderful. Until Will broke away and gazed at her, a little bemused. \"Wait,\" he said, breathlessly. \"If you're the reincarnation of King Arthur, what does that make me?\" Instead of an immediate answer (probably because she couldn't think of one for a second there), Allie kissed him again. When she pulled back, she replied, \"Queen Guinevere?\" Will started to nod, almost half-smiling, then seemingly registered what she'd just said. His game-sweat soaked eyebrows lowered, furrowing in even deeper confusion now. \"Wait, what ?\" Great, now the mood was broken. She probably should had said something - anything - else. \"Uh...\" Allie's eyes darted to Miles, hoping for some help. After all, if anyone could help King Arthur out of a jam, who better than his trusty wizard Merlin? Unfortunately, Miles was too preoccupied hugging some random girl to be of any assistance at the moment. \"What about my knight in shining armor?\" Allie finally offered. \"Cool.\" That was better; Will was happy again. But then, a few minutes later, as they walked off the field together, Will asked, \"So, which knight am I?\" Allie just moaned and buried her face in her hands.

Then im guessing Will's best friend walks up to him and gives him a hi five. Angel this is my best friend Jake. Hey, hey. So do you guys know were Mr. Moore's class is? Oh yea we're going there right now. We can walk there together. Ok. So I get to Mr. Moore's class and guess what we are doing. A report on King Arthur just my luck, and we're using the book my parents wrote. I have to do my report with the kid who got slammed up against the locker and his name is Michel. \"So mike when do you want to start the report?\" \"As soon as possible. You doing anything tonight ok good so we'll start tonight ill be there at 6:30\" Ok? Mike is at my house at 6 and he said at 6:30 right its just not me right? Anyway we start and we cant find any books on the order of the bear (our topic). So of course we have to take the easy way out and ask my parents. They go on forever then finally I get my parents to stop and give us the book and lets us do the research. Because I cant turn my parents as my bibliography lol. So the next day the knights are playing and we are down a touchdown and there is 15 second left. Will passes it to Jake and… they score! They only have 2 more games until state. So after wards Will invites me to a party at his house. And Marco of course is there and ruins the party. Will walks up to me and apologizes. \"Why are you sorry Marco is the one that ruined the party.\" \"Yea true but I wish I didn't know him then I would not have to worry about having to watch my back every minute. Hey I got to make sure nothing is trashed ill see ya in like 2 minutes ok. Ok will hey don't worry nothing bad is going to happen just relax. Yea I wish I could believe that. Then mike yells in pain and grabs his head like he was just hit in the head with a brick. \"Mike are you ok?\" Yea but im not sure if Will will be. What do you mean by that. Oh what its nothing. Ok im going to the bathroom be careful. I will. I walk up the stairs and I guess I stumble into Will's room and I find a crown and a red cape like kings wear. Ok then I guess this project is getting to my head. Im still looking for the bathroom not surprise that I cant find anything anymore. But instead of finding the bathroom I stumble in to something else way more insane. No it's not Will's parents room. I find Jake and Anna together. Wait a second I thought that Will and Anna were together. Crap im caught. Anna chases after me. She tells me how if I told will that his world would fall apart and that \"we\" didn't mean for all of this to happen. Ok first of all anna \"we\" are you and Jake not me and will. Will and I didn't do anything. I start to walk away but I promised anna that I wouldn't say anything. Then as I start to leave the party mike caches up with me. Then I turn around and I see will's face. Man my life gets harder and harder by the day. I don't know if I can keep this secret from will for long especially will the big game coming up and all. The next day was just as hard as yesterday. Trying to keep this huge secret from will was the hardest thing that I ever had to do. I mean I've only know will for 31/2 days but it feels like I've met him before I came here. I bring in the order of the bear book for Mr. Moore to read and we get to watch a movie. But I was constantly being watched. Either by Jake, Anna or Marco. I guess he figured out they jake and anna were a thing before I did. But how could he know and not tell will? If he hated will so much why didn't he just tell him? Maybe Marco was watching out for will instead of trying to ruin his life but this is Marco we are talking about. The guy that threatened mike to shove him in his locker. He couldn't be capable of watching out for anyone. And why was everyone looking at me everyone but will. Did he find out on his own already or was he just mad at marco? I don't know all I know is that I have to talk to will ASAP. I didn't matter were just as long it was soon. Just then mr. moore comes up to me and scares the crap out of me, all he wanted to talk about was the stupid book so if I brought the book in, does that mean I get extra points? I don't know but I have bigger problems. Will finally says hi to me but I tried to not to have a lot of eye contact with him I hope it didn't give him the impression that I hate him because he left me or that marco crashed that party. The next football game is here and we need a miracle to win this game we are down by 2 touchdown and there is a minute left in the game. The ball is on the 20 yard line on our side and we need to get down the field fast. Will calls hut and they spring into action just then BOOM he gets sacked and it looked like jake missed the block because he was to busy watching anna no shocker there. Anyway the ball flies and its….. Intercepted by the other team now its going to be impossible to go to state because in order to go we have to be the undefeated dragons. Yea not the best day for me or will. Jake throws his helmet then the whole team leaves, except will. He just sits there looking into the sunset. I go down the stairs to see if he's ok and to tell him everything. As im getting ready to tell him about jake and anna guess who interrupts me. Just guess marco god I want to punch him so bad. Is he here to help will or to hurt him god kid just make up your mind about what side your on. Of course he has to take will away because he doesn't have a ride home. Then maybe he should try harder at getting his license. Then I called will and asked him to come over for \"friend burgers\" its not a date because we are just friends. Of course my mom and dad have to embaress me in front of will. Saying that we should be together and then they start talking about king Arthur. Then will and I go out for a run I race him back to the house and I win haha. Will says wow you really are fast you should tryout for the football team. \"nah im not a fan of shoulder pads.\" oh (we both laughed the guess who has the nerve to call anna) hey angel I had a great time today ill see you tomorrow. Ok will see ya tomorrow. That night mike came over unexpectedly and said that that he saw he and I sitting in my house reading a secret page in the book. Weird but then it all makes sense if king Arthur is coming back so could merlin the courts wizard and phycic. So if mike is the rencarnation of merlin then maybe just maybe will could be the rencarnation of king Arthur. But wait didn't king Arthur have and evil step brother named Mordrid. Yes he did so will is king Arthur and marco is mordrid. The rencarnation of king Arthur's court is happening now. And when Arthur found out that gwenith was cheating on him with sir lancealot camalot crumbled. Then that means that when will finds out about Jake and anna he will not have the strenght to play in the game oh my god I got to go. Im sitting on the front steps of the school waiting for will to get here when finally he's here. Just as im about to say something, he sees anna and jake. Crap why didn't I run over to him or get his attention some how? Will gets back into his jeep and drivs off with me sprinting after his car. When I finally find him im pushed down the hill. Just then will runs after me and takes me into his arms and hugs me as hard as he could \"Angel are you ok?\" Yea im fine. How did you fall? I was pushed, someone pushed me. Who would push you? Mordrid. Like in the king Arthur story? Yea. Ok I think you need to lay down I think you hit your head. No will please listen to me, all of the stuff about the rencarnation of king Arthur is real. You are king Arthur and today is the day that you will rise above all of the lies and backstabbing and become the leader everyone has been waiting for. Your right, today I am like king Arthur. Yea, wait what. Yea I get it it's a metophor im the captin of the team and I need to be the leader.(Mike arrives) Hey mike can you give Angel a ride? Yea. Will gives me a kiss on the cheek. Angel, you are the reason that the knights are going to be reunited again. But will….. I didn't say that your like king Arthur you are king Arthur. (will drives off and mike says) Well that went well. Yea . So now what do we do? We go to the game and not let will out of our sights. We arrive at the game and will is on the field and marco is no were to be found. Well atlest will is away from marco I mean mordrid I mean well you know what I mean mike. 5 mintues pass by. Hey maybe we were wrong maybe its not tonight. Just then the stadium lights go dark and the moon is blocked out and a thousand metiors zoom past in the sky. Well we were right great. The lights come back on and the game resumes. The next play starts and will gets hit really hard because 3 stupid guys on will's team missed the block on purpose. Well its half time now and still no mordrid that is the only good new. The team goes in the locker room for a pep talk and will stratens things out with jake. Ok here they come. Will stops and talks to me and tells me that he will see me after the game and he runs back into the locker room to get his helmet. Ok bad idea marco could be in there and get will. Just then anna and jake come up to us and say that everyone is asking were will is. Mike and I go check the locker room and marco got him. But we don't know were they went. Mike forces himself to see a vision and he finds will they are in the school theater. We sprint to the theater and find marco trying to fight will. I yell will but just the will is thrown to the side and marco becomes mordrid. Then mike and I are thrown too. Will gets up and grabs a plastic sword and yells at marco to stay away from me. Marco starts to laugh and say what is a plastic sword going to do to me? Then the sword changes in to Excalibur. Will says what just happened? See I told you that you were king Arthur because any sword in the hand of Arthur becomes Excalibur. Will and marco battle it out and we are transported to another dimension. Jake, mike will marco and I are all transported to the dimension. So in the end marco is defeted and we get back to the game. Just in time too because the was just 12 seconds left and we needed a touchdown. Will fakes left and runs it right all the way for a touchdown we won we're going to state! I run down onto the field wating for will to come and say something smart but when he comes over he doesn't say something smart. Oh no he actually kisses me. So he cant be cheating on anna because she's moved on. I asked him if he was the rencarnation of king Arthur what that makes me? He said that I was his queen that we kissed again and then ran off into the darkness holding hands. Then next day all of our friends sat with us at our round table then the sene changed, we all were wearing armor exept me and anna. Then will and his knights took out their swords and placed the tip on the center of the table. Then will and I rode off on his horse along the beach by our castle and watched the sun set.

It's the first thing he notices. She's always the first thing he notices in this dismal excuse for a school. He needs her here, needs to know why she's not, but he's not very happy when he does. \"And she's home alone?\" he demanded, eyes flashing. \"What about your parents?\" \"There's a conference at the university this morning,\" Allie defended. \"They were gone before we even got up this morning.\" He turns from her, thinking, but it doesn't take him long to make up his mind. Without another word to Allie, he rises from his desk, swings his bag onto his shoulder and sets off briskly between the rows intent on making it into the hall before the teacher arrives. She needs him. She's dying. Well, not actually, but it feels like she is. Of that, she's absolutely certain. Normally she adores rainy days, but she knew today would be a miserable one from the moment she woke up. She hasn't thrown up, but her sinuses are filled to the brim and the smallest light sets off a new wave of pain. She's not running a fever, but she's got the chills, and everything just hurts . It can't get any worse than this. But it could get better. Something could make it better. Someone . She needs him. He takes the stairs two at a time, hair still a bit damp from the rain, not slowing until he reaches her door at the end of the hall. He knocks softly before easing it open. It seems unnatural to him, to find her so still, so quiet. \"How did you get in?\" she asks him, her voice so low he almost doesn't catch it. He answers as he enters the room and moves toward her bed. \"Allie told me about the secret key compartment in the King Arthur garden gnome.\" She stares at him blankly and he pauses, unsure. \"Are you cutting class?\" she wants to know, her voice soft but steady. \"Yes…\" his reply is hesitant. \"Are you going to yell at me?\" \"No.\" she whispers. She weakly holds her arms out to him, a clear invitation. \"I have to go change first,\" he tells her, patting his bag. \"I figured sweats would be more comfortable than jeans in bed. Also, there's some of my mom's soup in the fridge if you get hungry later.\" She stares at him unabashedly, a tender look that he can't quite put a name to settling over her face. It's still there when he returns a minute later. Approaching the bed, he pauses as she speaks. \"You know you'll get sick, right?\" Without even hesitating, he answers. \"Worth it.\" That tender look returns as she blurts \"I love you.\" She wasn't planning on telling him that, but by God does it feel good. Like releasing a breath she'd been holding just a little too long. He laughs quietly, clambering onto the mattress beside her and folding her body into his. His grey eyes seem to shine a little brighter after her confession. He's more than willing to return the sentiment, but she's already fast asleep, so he settles for pressing a kiss to her forehead and pulling up the covers. He'll get his chance soon though. Not two days after she returns to school, their roles are reversed as he comes down with the same bug; just in time for the weekend. ","Summary":" She's not here. It's the first thing he notices.

He started to move closer to me. He stared right into me eyes. The bell rang and everybody started to go to class. The teacher called out my name and said that is all I get from everybody, hello I just started at this school. No-body except will was looking at me. He gave a smile small and just walked of to get some lunch. \"Your Ally, right?\" A boy said standing behind me and I nodded yes. \"Yes, my name is Ally.\" I said with a statment as he walked away to sit at a table. \"Hi, my name is Lance.\" He sated to me and all I could think was that boy at the back of the classroom. My mum and dad won't like this when I get home from school. \"The lesson was acturally good to day.\" I told Miles before the bell rang again. It was time to go back to the lesson. \"I trust you all had an exciting lunch?\" The teacher asked every single one of us before turning to his dark board to do some writen. Me and Miles had to do history work. \"We all did.\" A boy said sitting on the other side of the boy who looked at me. The bell rang and it was time to go home to my mum and dad. Normal pov The next Ally got out of bed and brushed her hair, then after that she brushed her teeth, then she went downstairs to get some breakfast before going to school to see some of her friends. She waved goodbye to her mum before going of to school. She walked up to her locker and put her books away into the locker before heading into the lesson. \"Will, we ruby today.\" Lance said walking into the class and sat next to Jess. She fliped her hair. Ally did not want to say another word about what was going on over the other table. \"I know, Lance.\" Will said, with a grin to Ally and walked of to science class. \"How did you know?\" Lance aked with a confusion upon his face when he looked at Will. \"Because coach told us in practise yesterday morning.\" Will said with a statement look upon his face as they both walked straight to class. The teacher walked in and looked at Ally. \"Goodmorning, class.\" He said greeting all of them, before sitting down at his desk. \"Morning.\" Ally said to the teacher as she say down in her seat ready for the listen. \"Will, would you like to tell Ally your name?\" She asked questioning him with a smile. \"Yes. My name is Will.\" He said giving her a delighted smile before he went back to sit at the table. When the lesson had finished Will waited outside the classroom waiting on her to come out of the lesson that had just finished. It was lunchtime and Miles walked to sit with Ally. He gived a smile to her. She was waiting on will to come and sit with her when he had gotten his lunch to eat. He sat down beside and looked into her eyes. She realised that he had been falling ever since it was her first day there. He was looking over at Lance and Jen. But Jen saw him with Ally. \"You should stop staring at that table.\" Lance said getting up out of his seat to put his tray away. \"I know, but the new girl is kind of stealing my boyfriend.\" She said with a little bit of jealoucy, but Ally wasn't taking him away from her.

They've released all their really LOUSY movies to dvd, would it kill them to put out one I'd actually bother watching/buying?). And, yada yada, I happened to get on youtube and look up the trailer and stuff and get into a few disagreements with people who bash it because it's not exactly like the book and then I found a really cool desktop wallpaper that was Avalon High themed... Long story short, because of all this, good ol' AH was on my brain and this one-shot came into my head and I couldn't not write it. (Hey, maybe if we can expand the fandom a bit, Disney will break down and release it, or at least play it more often.) So, the plot is pretty much as follows, set some years after the movie when the characters have grown up and lived life and gotten married and all that jazz, Allie Pennington (now Allie Wagner) is having a baby, but it comes a bit early and Will's not home... There is one cuss word (\"Damn\") but aside from that no warnings. It's a fairly mild T-rated fic for the most part, I think. It's just a humour one-shot. Nothing fancy or all that deep, really. Allie Wagner groaned lightly and eased herself down onto the couch. Being over eight months pregnant was no joke. She'd gotten off a bit easy when it came to stuff like this, Allie couldn't help thinking, in her past life as King Arthur, having been a guy. Of course, she couldn't exactly remember any of that life, aside from a few crazy dreams and brief flashes where she thought she dimly recalled something-or some one -so it probably wasn't a totally charmed existence; and then there were all the battles and super bad hygiene of the Middle Ages to be reckoned with, in any case (her parents were professors of medieval literature, so she knew way more about that stuff than she ever wanted to). But still . All the same ... Her husband Will was away on business. He was a rising young politician, working his way up, he hoped, one day, to President of the United States. Usually, when he went to conferences or meetings with the Press, or wherever else his work took him, Allie came along. She was plenty used to traveling, having moved so many times with her parents growing up, her three years at Avalon High being pretty much the longest she ever stayed in one school. However, the doctor had said Allie was too drastically pregnant to be out on the open road (in spite of the fact that she hadn't quite gone the full nine months yet, and she wasn't even officially due for another two and a half to three weeks, he seemed to think there was a good chance she would just explode at any given moment), so she was stuck at home. Not that she minded being home in the comfortable, fair-sized house her parents had helped put a down payment on for her and Will as a wedding present. She wasn't even really alone , technically. Her friend Miles only lived three blocks away, and she had him on speed dial on her cell if she needed anything. And while Will had been gone for about a week (he was due to come home sometime early the next morning), Miles had stopped by every afternoon to make sure she had enough food in the house (Will left some money for gas in case he needed to go to the grocery store for her, but he probably would have done the favor for free anyway) and to keep her company so she didn't die of boredom sitting inside on gloomy gray-skied winter days with no one except her swelling, currently rather enormous, belly to talk to. Miles was one of only two people from high school who was still in their life now, the other being Will's stepbrother Marco. When she'd first met Marco, Allie hadn't liked him at all. She'd thought he was the reincarnation of Mordred and pure evil (honest mistake), and because she had also thought, at the time, that Will was King Arthur (it had all seemed to add up...), she believed he was, in accordance with the legend, borderline violently jealous of his stepbrother and trying to destroy him. Except, then it had turned out that Marco was actually part of the Order of the Bear, taking the place of his dead father in trying to protect Will from Mordred, who was, unbelievably, their teacher Mr. Moore. Then, in the strangest twist of fate of them all, Allie herself had turned out to be Arthur. Will was one of her knights (she still teased him about that sometimes, calling him her knight in shining armor). Mr. Moore had cropped up again from time to time, but the initial defeat stopped him from standing in Arthur's way, the shock of Arthur turning out to be a girl (now a woman), having worked in their favor. He'd wasted so much time on Will before that fateful night, when there had been a meteor shower and an eclipse at the same time, that by the time it became clear that Allie was the one whose life he should have been trying to ruin, it was just a little too late. When Allie's parents, Mr. and Mrs. Pennington, found out (Allie had to tell them, so they would stop giving Marco the stink eye, seeing as even after they gathered that Will wasn't King Arthur after all, they still didn't trust his stepbrother for a while there), they'd hoped he would be in jail forever. But right from the start they-and Allie-knew that wouldn't be the case. In the end, Mr. Moore hadn't actually hurt anyone. He'd basically threatened Allie, saying it was his destiny to destroy her, and in the end lost his job over that much alone, but there was no real reason for him to be permanently incarcerated. At least, no reason that could be legally explained. Apparently it was not a real crime to be the reincarnation of a dangerous villain. Go figure. Jen and Lance never had found out about their being reincarnations of King Arthur's court. If they'd suspected it there for a while, they never said anything about it to Allie-or to Will, she knew, because he told her everything and would have mentioned it. For a while, Lance and Will had stayed best friends, through the first year or so of college they'd been as close as ever, before they started drifting a bit. Will had even been the best man at Lance's wedding (he'd wound up marrying some girl named Elaine, not Jen, who'd gone off to some sort of beautician school in Switzerland after graduation) and invited Lance to their wedding when he and Allie got married. Lance had been away on a trip in Mexico and hadn't been able to make it back in time, sending a present (a very nice present) and his best wishes instead. If he'd shown, Will probably would have felt obligated to make him his best man, but since Lance couldn't come, he'd chosen Marco (Miles was an usher, because he'd flatly refused to be the male equivalent of Allie's maid of honor). Allie had wanted to go into something with law, but that hadn't panned out for her yet. She'd taken a few classes, then had to give it up for this or that reason. By the time she'd gotten pregnant, she'd begun to think it was a little pointless. Yes, she was King Arthur, and as such she would be expected to do something great, but she wasn't sure exactly what that something was. And, anyway, there was no real rush. She didn't mind Will getting all the glory so to speak; she never had. She always felt, in whatever he achieved, like she was up there with him, just like on the night of the big game. Besides, if she ever decided what it was she was meant to do to change the world, aside from being married to Will Wagner and having his child, she was fairly certain the Order of the Bear would be more than willing to pay any tuition fees involved, so that was pretty sweet. She picked up the remote and switched the TV on. Inside her, her baby jumped slightly. \"Hey now,\" she said, putting her hand on her bulging stomach. \"You don't get to complain about Mommy picking the channel until after you're out of there.\" The first thing she watched was the weather. They predicted a pretty heavy snowfall for that evening. So far, there was nothing, not a single white flake to be seen, but the clouds were getting denser, and goodness knew it was definitely cold enough! Allie had the heater up almost on full blast. She seriously hoped it didn't break or anything. Miles might just be able to fix it if it did, but she didn't have a whole lot of faith in his abilities as a handyman. She flicked the channel over. There was Will, doing an interview. It wasn't live, she knew, he was probably on his way back now. Even though she'd suggested he stay in a hotel for the night, he'd insisted on driving through it. He was hoping to be back with her as soon as possible. God he looks handsome on TV , Allie thought, sighing inwardly. Then again, he was even more handsome off of it, when he was really standing in front of her, smiling like he had that day she'd first met him at the water fountain. She imagined him walking through that door in the early morning light, seeing that she'd fallen asleep on the couch, coming over to kiss her gently and say how much he'd missed her and their unborn baby. Suddenly she felt a rush of searing pain. \"Ah!\" The remote slid out of her hands and onto the floor with a thud . She clutched her belly. \"Oh, no, not now .\" Will wasn't home yet! He couldn't miss this! It wasn't fair! This was too early! \"Will...\" She grabbed her cell, which was resting on the arm of the couch, and called her husband. \"Allie?\" He picked up the second his ringtone started and he saw his wife's picture on the Caller ID. \"I think I'm going into labor,\" she whimpered into the receiver. \"Allie, it's going to be okay,\" Will said firmly. \"Take deep breaths. Call Miles to come and drive you to the hospital.\" \"This isn't right,\" she panted. \"You were supposed to be here.\" \"Listen, I'm on my way. I was going to call you to let you know I was running ahead of time and might be there tonight. I'm still a few hours away, but I'll get there as fast as I can, I promise. I'm going to hang up now. You need to go to the hospital. Call Miles the second I hang up, okay?\" \"Okay,\" she groaned. \"Ah...\" Another rush of pain went through her. This was terrible. If this kept up or got any worse, the minute Will showed up (after getting over her relief that he was there, naturally) she was going to throw something very hard at his head for doing this to her. He hung up and she called Miles. Not even ten minutes later, Miles was bursting through the door (he had a spare key). He hadn't changed much over the years; aside from the fact that he now wore glasses, he still dressed and acted pretty much the same as he had in high school. \"Allie!\" \"Ow! Ow! Ow!\" \"Okay, hang on, I'm going to help you up.\" Which, he did, except the first time he dropped her by accident. She was a bit heavier than he'd expected. \"Miles!\" she snapped, sprawled out on the floor, putting one hand to her forehead and one to her belly. \"Sorry, I wasn't ready.\" He took her arm again, counted back from three, and helped her to her feet, leading her out of the house and into the back of his car. \"Come on, Allie.\" Miles jumped into the driver's seat and started up the engine. The first few flakes of snow began to fall, landing on the hood of his car and instantly dissolving upon contact. A slightly bigger snowflake hit the windshield and stayed there for a few moments, depicting its unique pattern. As they started off down the road, Miles turned on the radio. He wanted to be sure of the weather. It kind of sucked that, given the fact that he was at least partially psychic, being the reincarnation of Merlin the Wizard, he couldn't just make himself see important little details, like if the snowfall would turn into a storm. He had mastered his skills enough, in the years that had followed his time at Avalon High, to make his visions happen on demand (though they still hurt like he was being hit in the head with a brick) as he had managed to do with Allie's encouragement on the night of the big game, but that was usually directed towards people -like Will or Allie-or else major events in line with Arthurian legend or prophecy, and it was usually pretty weak on details such as when he needed an umbrella or a road was closed off. Allie was screaming so loudly in the back that Miles couldn't hear a word the guy on the radio said. \"Allie, could you keep it down? I can't hear the weather.\" \"I'm kind of in the middle of having a baby back here!\" \"Well, that would explain the stomach cramps, wouldn't it?\" he said sarcastically. \"Miles, shut uh-\" She whimpered and let out another scream, unable to finish. \"Ahh! God, this hurts. I can't take another second of this!\" \"In through the nose, out through the mouth,\" Miles told her, honking the horn at a car that was trying to cut them off. \"You're doing fine.\" He lifted one hand off the wheel and shook his fist at the other car as it overtook them. \"Would it kill you to use a turn signal?\" \"What if Will...\" she panted. \"What if he doesn't make it in time? I don't think I can do this without him.\" \"I'm with you, you're going to be okay, just keep breathing,\" said Miles. Suddenly he let out a yelp of pain, took both hands off the wheel and clutched at his forehead. Allie screamed, this time from understandable terror that they would be in an accident. Thankfully, the second his vision was over, Miles regained control of the car and they turned off the upcoming highway and into a fast food chain's parking lot. \"Miles, why are we here? What did you see? Was there a block on the highway?\" \"I just saw myself pulling in here.\" He shrugged. \"Well, pull back out!\" shrieked Allie. \"I can't give birth at a burger joint !\" \"Sure, we'll just take the opposite way out,\" Miles told her. \"Through the drive-through.\" \" Miles !\" cried Allie. \"Allie, I'm starving, you called right before I could grab some dinner.\" \"You can get something in the hospital cafeteria!\" she protested. \"Ahh!\" Ignoring her, he drove on up to the first window. \"Yeah, I'll have a double cheese burger, fries, and a medium coke.\" \"Mi-yeels!\" Allie shouted from the backseat. \"Oh, right.\" He looked over his shoulder, back at her. \"You want something?\" \"Yes, as a matter of fact, I do! To be at the damn hospital already!\" \"I'll get you an order of fries,\" Miles decided. \"Drive up to your next window,\" said a bored-looking middle-aged woman with a curly gray bob. \"I'm going to kill you!\" Allie swore from the backseat. \"Ow...\" Once Miles had gotten his order handed to him and paid for it, they drove off towards the back of the lot. They would have been out, but Miles noticed a familiar shape standing next to a motorcycle that apparently wasn't starting. \"Hey!\" He rolled down the window. \"Marco!\" \"Miles!\" Marco, as tall and brooding as ever, just older and with an Order of the Bear tattoo on his upper arm (currently covered by his long-sleeved T-shirt and leather jacket), came up to the side of the car. \"How's everything?\" Allie screamed in the backseat. \"I'm fine,\" Miles said. Gesturing back with his chin, he added, \"She's in labor.\" \"Can you give me a lift?\" Marco asked. \" Seriously ?\" cried Allie, bent over her belly like a jackknife. \"My motorcycle won't start, and my cellphone battery is dead.\" \"We're headed to the hospital.\" \"Eh, why not?\" Marco shrugged. \"It's not like I've got anything better to do right now.\" At least there would probably be a phone he could borrow at the hospital. Plus it would be warmer and drier; it was already snowing lightly and by all reports it was supposed to get a lot heavier. Heck, it was probably even technically his duty as a member of the Order of the Bear to escort Arthur to the hospital and offer his assistance in whatever came up. Boy, this was all so much more simple when they'd expected King Arthur to return as a guy ! \"Hop in,\" Miles said. Marco got in the passenger seat and started rummaging through the brown paper bag with the food in it. \"Hey, you got an extra order of fries! Can I have some?\" \"Hey, Allie, do you mind if Marco eats your fries?\" \"Miles, I swear to Go-Ahhhhh!\" \"I'd take that as a maybe ,\" Miles suggested, leaning over to talk to Marco. They were just exiting off the highway (having gotten back on it after leaving the parking lot, the hospital only about a block away from this point) when the car engine made a funny sound and Miles moaned, \"Uh, bad news...\" The car stopped moving. \"Why did you turn off the engine?\" Marco asked. \"I didn't ,\" he admitted sheepishly. \"We might have just run out of gas.\" \"Ahhhhh!\" Allie screamed. \"One of us has to get out and push,\" Marco said. \"We could flip a coin,\" Miles offered. \"You got a coin?\" \"Nah.\" He shook his head. \"I kind of had to run for the door when Allie called, I didn't have to grab any change.\" \"And yet you had enough money for burgers !\" Allie barked. \"By the way, before the next contraction starts, if either of you can find a working phone, or get a signal, maybe you could call Will and tell him I'm about to have his baby in the backseat of this car, on the side of the road, roughly one block away from the hospital, because neither of you can...! Oh, God! Ahhhh!\" So finally both Miles and Marco got out to push the car the rest of the way to the hospital, but after about two minutes Marco realized Miles was borderline useless at the task, panting and gasping, having about the same chance of successfully pushing that car to its destination as he had of winning an arm-wrestling contest against Superman. \"Don't hurt yourself, Miles,\" he told him. \"Just get back in the car and steer.\" As impossible as it seemed, they did eventually make it to the hospital, and managed to do so before Allie had her baby in the backseat. Marco helped her into a wheelchair, which Miles wheeled, speeding in the emergency room, right by injured gang members with bloody knife and gunshot wounds, really stupid kids who'd gotten pencils stuck in their eye-sockets, six-year-old twins vomiting up pizza and PLAY-DOH, an old man with what was most likely a broken arm, and some random woman in her mid-twenties with an arrow embedded in her thigh. \"Allie Wagner needs to see a doctor right away,\" he informed the lady at the desk. \"She's in labor.\" \"Is she sure she's in labor?\" the lady asked in a slow drawl. \"Because we've had a lot of expecting mothers come in when their bodies are only practicing for the birth.\" \"I'm not practicing!\" Allie exclaimed. \"And if someone doesn't get me into a room in the next five minutes...\" She started whimpering and sobbing. \"I'm never having any more kids. This hurts !\" \"Hey.\" Miles bent down on one side of the wheelchair and rubbed her arm consolingly. \"It's okay, Allie. You're going to do fine. Take it from someone who's has to deal with a lot of constant pain. Once it passes, it's always worth it, even when it's scary and you just want to make it stop.\" Sure, he'd never ( obviously ) given birth to a child, but having visions that gave him massive headaches had given him a hand in putting almost unbearable pain into perspective. Marco was suddenly on the other side of her wheelchair, kneeling beside it so he was on the same eye-level as her. \"Anyone strong enough to defeat Mordred can definitely survive having a baby.\" He gave her a kindly half-smile. \"Your Highness.\" She managed to smile back faintly. \"Thanks.\" She looked at Miles. \"You, too, Miles.\" Then, \"Ahhhhh!\" \"All right,\" the woman said. \"She's screaming bloody murder. I'm convinced. Let's get the doctor and have her wheeled into delivery.\" \"Will's still not here,\" Allie whimper-noted. \"Which one of you is her husband?\" the woman wanted to know. \"Neither of us,\" Miles said. \"Or boyfriend ,\" she sighed, rolling her eyes. \"No judgment.\" \"Again,\" Miles stated; \" Neither of us. Mr. Wagner's on his way.\" \"Well, if we take her into delivery now, who wants to go in with her?\" \"Excuse us for one minute, will you?\" Miles pulled Marco aside. \"You're in the Order of the Bear, you go in.\" \"Me?\" He frowned. \" You're the reincarnation of Merlin, not me. Merlin always stood by Arthur. You do it.\" \"Coward.\" \"Don't make me hit you.\" \"Okay, okay.\" \"You want to try the coin flipping thing?\" \"I don't have one!\" \"Miles! Marco!\" Allie called, leaning over heavily on the wheelchair's armrest. \"I think I've been extremely tolerant thus far.\" The automatic doors to their right opened. In walked Will Wagner, breathless, his tie askew and his snowflake-speckled hair disheveled. He stared, discomfited, at the people in the emergency room lobby as he scanned the area. When he spotted Allie in the wheelchair with Miles and Marco close by, he breathed a sigh of relief and dashed over. \"Oh, thank goodness!\" He bent down and kissed Allie on the forehead, smoothing back her blond hair, which was slightly dampened with perspiration. \"I was so worried I'd miss it. I think I went at least ten miles over the speed limit and took a few shortcuts on streets that were supposed to be one way only, but I got here and you're doing okay.\" \"And this means we don't have to go into the delivery room with her,\" Miles whispered to Marco. \"Amen,\" he replied. Two hours later, the baby had been brought into the world, cleaned off, and the mother and father were ready to see it. Unfortunately for them, Miles somehow got to the pram first and was already holding the baby and talking to it, telling it about its mother and father, and how it had a great legacy to live up to but not to worry because 'Uncle Miles' was going to be there every step of the way. \"Miles,\" Allie swallowed hard so she wouldn't laugh, \"you're my friend and I love you, but would you mind letting me bond with my baby?\" \"Your mommy's in one of her moods, Allie Junior,\" he whispered down to the baby in his arms. \"When she drives you crazy, you call me.\" \"Um, it's not an 'Allie Junior',\" Will coughed into his hand and raised an eyebrow. \"Why not?\" Miles frowned. \"Fathers name babies after themselves all the time, why not mothers?\" \"Because it's a boy ,\" Allie said pointedly. Miles checked. \"Oh, you're right, my mistake.\" He nodded down at the baby, almost apologetically. \"Definitely not a girl. Though you do look a lot like your mom.\" \"Marco?\" Will cocked his head at his stepbrother pleadingly. \"On it.\" He reached over and took the baby away from Miles and gave him a light slap upside the head (Miles, that is, not the baby). \"Here you go, Will.\" He handed him the baby. \"He's beautiful,\" Will said softly, gently placing the baby, his newborn son, into his wife's waiting arms. \"No,\" said Allie, her voice barely louder than a whisper. \"He's more than just that. He's perfect . And he was worth everything it took to bring him out here with us.\" \"Trust me,\" Miles said, grinning. \"That's saying a lot, Kid. Your mom sure does love you.\" \"So what are you going to call him?\" Marco wanted to know. \"We haven't decided yet,\" Will admitted. \"What about you, Allie?\" Miles asked. \"Any ideas?\" \"One,\" she said, smirking. \"And what's that?\" Will bent over and put his arm around her shoulders. \" Anything but Arthur,\" Allie said firmly. AN: Pleaseth to review and tellth me what you thought! ","Summary":" AN: Well the other day I happened to go off on one of my rants about how Disney Channel sucks and t"},{"Movie":"Avalon High","Title":"Better Choices","Author":"Fahiru","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8012366","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Better Choices By Fahiru Haha...King Arthur... Yeah, this was getting pretty weird. I stood in the football stands, halfheartedly applauding as Will and his team heroically carpe d the diem with the final count going to them. I really don't understand football, I'm more of a track kinda gal. However, even I could tell that Will's scholarship was now safe, he'd honored the school and won the game. Like a real King Arthur. So why did it turn out that I was King Arthur instead of Will? I'm not even a guy! I placed my hands on my aching temples. This prophesy really wasn't doing a good job at making sense. And the fanatical screams of the surrounding occupants of the stands really didn't help the pounding headache that had started to develop as soon as all had been revealed. I mean, having super powers for turning anything I touch that resembles a sword into the legendary Excalibur is a pretty sweet deal. It almost makes up for the pain my head is experiencing. \"Allie, are you feeling okay?\" I looked over at Miles, who was looking a lot more confused about the sport than I was. If anyone had felt excruciating pain in the head and not bothered to complain much about it, Miles takes the cake. Being Merlin the Wizard isn't all wands and epic beards, he also gets to feel the fun affliction brought on by his revelations. I didn't have the right to tell him how much my head aches when he feels twenty times worse all the time. I try to smile, he probably knows that it's fake. \"I'm okay. We should go congratulate him.\" As we file down the steps into the field I can see that Miles's attention has turned from worrying over me to observing a pretty blonde a few steps ahead of us. Come to think of it, she was at Will's party. I feel a twinge inside my chest. That's just me feeling happy for him, right? Will jogs up to us as we walk out onto the grass and sweeps me into a hug. I should be happy, but instead of marveling over being embraced by the boy I've had my eye on since I came to Avalon, I feel like I shouldn't be there. I anxiously glance to my right and spy Gen and Lance. Gen. Will just found out that she was cheating on him today. Their break-up seemed pretty clean, but did he get over her that quickly? I realize that me and Will are still hugging. This is weird. I mean, he still liked Gen earlier today, didn't he? They were still together this morning. What was he doing hugging me now? I was starting to get really uncomfortable. We'd only been hugging for a few seconds, but it felt ages too long. I should know, I'm King Arthur aren't I? I start to pull away and look to my left. There's Miles, he's with that girl from Will's party. They look kind of awkward. I feel that twinge surge up again, but it hurts this time. Miles hasn't ever talked to this girl before, how does he know that he likes her? I look over at Will, he looks really confused and a little hurt. Will's a nice guy, but seriously, how well do we know each other? He would stand up for Miles, but he never bothered to try to be his friend. Not to mention Will had turned to me as soon as he and Gen broke up. He had been seeking me out quite a bit even before they broke up. I start to back away from Will. He could have ended up doing the same thing that Gen had done to him, so why had he acted so hurt for the first half hour after he'd found out? Sure it sucked, but didn't he have any guilt of his own? Not to mention his self esteem, he needed for me to comfort him every time something happened, and put him back on his feet. I need to stop criticizing him. He looks so confused and sad, but I can already tell, this wouldn't end well. He...hasn't grown enough. I sympathetically furrow my eyebrows, looking hard at his sad face. \"I'm really sorry Will...I just...we were really meant to be very good friends.\" The poor guy probably feels terrible. But he got over Gen so quickly...how long would he think about me? He's only known me a few weeks, he's known Gen for years! He'll be okay. I smile at him and turn to make my way through the crowd. I had always been saving Will, but who had been there for me? I make my way to Miles and the blonde girl, who are starting to look like they wish they had never bothered to seek out each other's company. They aren't talking. I talk with Miles a lot more. Somehow we always have something to talk about. I feel like a jerk, interrupting his probably long anticipated time with his crush, but the twinge has grown to a suffocating jealousy. I'd never felt this strongly when Will was with Gen. Miles looks relieved when I take my place next to the him. The poor girl looks relieved too. I beg their pardon for barging in, even though they weren't talking or anything, and I promptly take Miles by the arm and drag him off to the now deserted stands. \"Allie? Is this important or something?\" \"You didn't look like you were that busy.\" \"I was very busy.\" \"Doing what?\" \"...Well...that...\" \"I thought so.\" Here I turn him towards me and we make eye contact. Look at that! He'll look me in the eye right away. That's...well, quality. What a good wizard he is. \"Remember when we very first met?\" \"If you say I told you so about us becoming friends, I will turn you into Saint George's Dragon.\" \"First of all, I'm afraid that would be treason against your King..Queen...man, what is my title? Second, actually, still kind of first, Merlin and Arthur were, like best friends anyways.\" \"Actually, I thought Merlin just taught Arthur everything he knows...more of a teacher thing...\" Darn smart kid, ruining my cheesey-half-thought-out-pick-up-line! \"Are you saying that you're still sad and friendless? I think you just don't want to give up the right to mope.\" \"Oh, we're sure best friends now! Just look at you being so encouraging and all, thanks Allie!\" I really liked this kid. We're both poor conversationalists, it's just too perfect. \"I forgot what I was going to say...I had something pretty good too...\" \"You plan out your conversations? I'd like to see just how many people stuck to the script.\" \"You're definitely not on the list.\" \"I like to think that I'm something of a rebel.\" \"In your prophesizing dreams.\" He winced. Ouch, I really was hurting my chances here, better get to the point soon. \"Miles...I didn't mean to...um, anyways, as I was trying to say...\" He looks at me expectantly. He...really looks a lot nicer than he is when he wears that expression... \"Um, a-as I was saying,\" I stammer on, \"uh, Merlin and Arthur were pretty tight. I guess it sort of carried across generations. E-even after all the people I met and became close with...\" I look him in the eye and try to say this next part audibly. \"Miles...you're my best friend out of all of them, and, well...best friends really get along well...that's important in every kind of relationship. I can talk to you about everything-\" \"Except this, apparently.\" I nearly stomp my foot like an overwhelmingly spoiled child. \" My parents are best friends too! They, um, they really get along and also talk about everything, and-\" \"And tease each other a lot.\" \"But that's just like us! Right?\" I cover my mouth. This isn't how I wanted to say it. I kind of just blurted it out. Miles is looking at me strangely. Like I'm a cat that just started talking and told him that mangoes are blue. He's about to respond, I can tell. I close my eyes because I don't want to hear it . Ha. Closing my eyes instead of covering my ears. I'm not as smart as Miles doesn't tell me I am. \"Allie...\" \"Don't say it!\" \"Your name?\" I start to laugh a little, but I choke. I'm so scared that I've started to cry. \"...Why didn't you just tell me?\" I look up at him, astonished. \"Up until when we found out about the prophesy, I'd thought you were still hanging out with me just to spite me. You know, because I said we couldn't be friends. I thought you were just being stubborn.\" I can't really take it, but I can't run away. This is the most important thing right now, I need to see it through. \"I...Miles...\" \"And what about Will? Wasn't he your Knight in Shining Armor?\" \"It was more like the other way around!\" I burst out,\" I always came to help Will, but...but the one who was there when I needed some one, that was you !\" \"What did I ever do for you?\" \"You were there! \" I'm not just crying now. My voice is catching and I probably look totally disgusting. I have to say it right though, I can't leave this hanging in the air. \"You were just there . Remember when I got pushed down that hill? Will had time to take me back in his car, but he told you to take me instead. I know that the game was the most important thing then but-\" \"Allie, that's just a little detail!\" \"But it's the small things that count!\" I grip his arms. He looks kind of scared. I don't blame him, I'm being pretty straight forward. \"You must be really tired, I should find your parents...\" \"No.\" I tighten my grip on his sleeves. \"You're confused, right? If we don't get things straight now, things will be pretty awkward, right?\" \"They're a little awkward now...\" \"I'm trying to ignore that fact, it will be worse if we wait. I want you to think about it without any excuses. What...\" I nervously take a deep breath, \"What do you feel for me?\" Miles looks really shocked. Not like he's surprised that such a question would arise, but like he never thought of it before. He seriously thought I was delirious till now, didn't he? \"If I was with Will all the time, and we were in a romantic relationship, how would it make you feel?\" I was afraid of the answer. I was afraid, but...I needed to hear this. \"If you were with Will...we probably wouldn't hang out that much...\" He squinches his brow, he doesn't seem to like this idea. Well, that's the best thing that's happened all day. \"It might be a little more awkward between us if you were with Will...he might get suspicious of our friendship because of what happened with Gen. And I...\" He's looking me in the eye, like he always does, concentrating hard. He's really taking this seriously. He takes me seriously. \"Allie...if you were always with Will...to tell the truth, I had kind of accepted it by now. He's the popular jock after all.\" \"Miles, I don't have a clue about how football works. What would we talk about? All that would happen is I would boost his self esteem for him every time something bad happened. I already do that anyways. But you and me...we talk about everything. We really connect, don't we?\" He looks at me. His gaze is intense. Miles is really serious, but he can be really funny too. He's made me laugh a lot more than Will has. Without shifting his eyes from mine, he slowly reaches up and brushes the hair back from my tear stained face. His hand tucks the loose locks behind my ear as his face draws closer to mine. I close my eyes, and as I wait for the kiss I wonder if he's still looking at me, or if his eyes are closed too. Closer- \"Allie! Where are you, kiddo?\" We quickly jump back from each other and both of us stumble over the bleachers behind us. I hit my head on the seat and sit up moaning and rubbing the back of my skull. The cranial pain has increased, like, tenfold. Miles is probably feeling worse. My thoughtful parents wander over to us. They might have noticed that we're both minorly injured, but they're distractedly searching the field. \"Did it turn out right with Will? I didn't see anything resembling the fulfillment of a prophesy. What happened?\" My poor, poor fanatical mother. I open my mouth to clear up the misunderstanding, but I lock eyes with Miles first. He is giving me an urgent \"you are about to stupidly ruin your whole life if you do this\" look. He's right. If my parents knew, then there'd be nothing keeping me here. They'd have Arthur and wouldn't need to stick around. I wouldn't finish the school year, I'd lose track club, I'd lose Miles... They would probably never treat me the same way again either. Miles and I share a nod of understanding. For now, it will just be our little secret. (A/N: So I was babysitting when I saw this movie. It was pretty okay and even sort of imaginative up until the end. Man, that ending sucked more than...a lot of sucky stuff. This is how it should have gone, or close to it anyway. I liked Miles WAY more than Will, who was a nice guy but there wasn't much to him. Allie was actually fairly likeable for a heroine. Keep in mind that I've only seen the movie once, so I may have gotten some of the characters/elements/plot wrong, but hopefully they kind of had the same feel. Seriously though, what was up with Will's melancholy personality, and his getting over Gen so fast? That guy is suspicious. And frankly, he wasn't very pretty, er...however you would describe him. Miles somehow seemed manlier. Thank you FatesMistake for pointing out MY mistake. I have fixed it and now everything should be pretty accurate. I know this is fan fiction, but I don't like to bend the original work more than I need to.) ","Summary":" Better Choices By Fahiru Haha...King Arthur... Yeah, this was getting pretty weird.

A story based on this quote from the film; 'I wish I was tiny, so I can give you a hug.' [I do not, and never will, own Turbo.] Chapter 1: Beginning Tito Lopez winced as he saw the rushing water from the sewer he was in, clinging from a ledge. He shivered as the coldness of the sewer raised gooseflesh on his skin, hence why he was only wearing a Tarzan shoal made from a napkin. Tito sighed. 'How did it come to this?' he thought. 'how did I, Tito Lopez, part of Dos Bros Tacos, the one who brought a snail into the Indianapolis 500, end up in a very big, no pun intended, problem, and in a life and death situation? I mean, maybe sometimes this happens to most people. If it could happen to my brother Angelo, he'd be in this situation too... I think.' he hauled himself up onto the ledge and sighed, staring up at the setting evening sun through the sewer drain. \"It feels like only a month ago that I entered Turbo in the Indy 500...\" FLASHBACK: Tito ran up to Turbo on the starting lineup of the race. It felt soooo exciting. It seemed like history was gonna be made that day. He leant down next to the super-powered snail. \"Everything's gonna be fine, okay?\" he said. \"We can do this, right?\" Turbo gamely, albeit nervously, revved his engine, anything for his new friend. He didn't wanna let him, his bro, and his new friends/teammates down. Tito's eyes welled up with tears. \"Oh, I wish I was tiny, so I can give you a hug!\" he said. \"Get off the track!\" one of the race officials yelled. \"OK, OK, I'm going!\" Tito said as he jogged off the track. \"Good luck out there, Turbo!\" END FLASHBACK 'Maybe,' he thought, 'what I said that day must be the cause of my current state! If it's possible. I mean, people don't just shrink, right?' He sighed and sat down, wincing as he felt himself shrink another inch. 'It's only a matter of time before I shrink so small, I'll end up becoming the world's smallest taco seller!' He sighed again. \"And to think, it all started so well yesterday!\" READ AND REVIEW![Chapter 2] [I do not, and never will, own Turbo.] Chapter 2: Yesterday... (PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE THE FIRST CHAPTER) The sun streamed into the window of Tito and Angelo Lopez's apartment. A Mexican Mariachi band alarm clock, reading 7:00 am, played loudly. Tito leaned over and pressed a button the clock, and the music stopped. He got up, and headed for the shower. Also, by this time, Angelo, Tito's brother, got up as well. Tito was busy singing his song in the shower. Angelo waited for Tito to finish so he could have his shower. Soon, Tito was outta the shower. He had just dried himself off when he suddenly felt a sharp tingle in his belly. It spread from the top of his head to the tips of his fingers to the ends of his toes. \"That felt... weird.\" Tito said to himself. Dismissing the thought, He weighed himself on the bathroom scales. but then... Tito gasped. he noticed something odd - instead of his usual weight [70lbs], it was a bit lower than normal [66lbs]. His thoughts were suddenly interrupted by Angelo banging on the bathroom door, saying \"Tito, are you finished yet?\" Tito quickly got out the bathroom and headed off to get dressed for work. As Angelo drove, Tito couldn't help thinking about the scales. Did it seem like he was losing weight? Was something wrong with him? It was actually hard to say. The day at Starlight Plaza went well too. The crowds were amazed at Turbo and the Snail Racing Crew's performance on the track. Later, Tito and Angelo were having their lunch break. Angelo stared at Tito, and saw his brother. his hat seemed to flop about on his head a lot. and his shirt did seem to look... loose. Angelo's eyes widened, and he nervously put his taco down. Tito looked at Angelo, then at the taco he'd put down. \"Are you gonna finish that, bro?\" he asked. \"No, uh... I'm not hungry, anymore.\" Angelo said, pushing his taco closer to Tito, who ate it. Angelo just got up and walked off to the Dos Bros Tacos shack. he made a mental note to weigh his brother after lunch. Also, by this time, Turbo and the other snails, including Turbo's brother Chet, were on lunch break too. Even Turbo noticed that something was up with Tito. Later, after lunch, Angelo examined Tito. Upon standing on the scales, Angelo saw that Tito's weight had lowered significantly. It was now 61lbs. Angelo stared, and saw that Tito was now roughly the same height as him. Tito stared at his brother, who, for some baffling reason, was staring at him like he'd grown a second head, or like his penis had disappeared and become a vagina. Angelo sighed. He had to tell his brother to reveal the truth. \"Tito, what is going on?\" Angelo asked. \"Are you on a secret diet you aren't telling me about?\" Tito looked bewildered. \"Angelo, what are you on about?\" Angelo sighed. \"Look at the scales!\" he said. He and Tito looked, and they saw the scales had gone from 61lbs to 57lbs. Angelo sighed angrily. \"Tito, what is up with you? You look almost a foot shorter than me!\" Tito stared at himself. \"You know what Angelo, I think you're right. There might be something wrong with me.\" \"Well? What is it?\" Angelo said, wanting the answer. \"OK, bro. I'll tell ya. You'll think it's crazy but, well, I'll tell ya. I think maybe, just maybe...\" Tito paused impressively. \"What?\" Angelo asked impatiently. \"...Well, I... could be... shrinking?\" There was a long silence. Then Angelo started laughing. \"What's so funny?\" Tito asked. \"Well,\" Angelo said, through laughing, \"Imagine, you, Tito Lopez, my little bro, a freak of nature! The Incredible Shrinking Taco Seller !\" He laughed for what seemed like 5 minutes. or more. \"People would only shrink in sci-fi movies, and such. You're just believing this stuff, bro.\" he said as he walked out. Tito sighed. Maybe his brother was right. Maybe he WASN'T shrinking after all. It was just a harmless ruse. Or was it? Later, Tito was just getting ready for the taco delivery run. It was then he saw his shirt. It seemed to somehow sag a bit, and seemed to be somewhat a little bigger than before. Then, he noticed his pants were sorta sagging. 'I'm gonna have a word with the dry cleaners about my clothes.' he said to himself. He then headed up to the delivery truck... which seemed to have gotten bigger. \"I really need to install steps on this thing.\" he said, as he struggled to get in. It took a while, but he eventually got in. He saw he could barely see over the steering wheel. And, not surprisingly, he wasn't the only one. Turbo, who was on the umbrella of one of the tables at the time, had seen everything. He saw the truck, slowly, but surely, start up, then drive off. 'Maybe something is wrong with him.' he thought. That afternoon, Tito drove through the streets back to the Starlight Plaza Strip Mall, after his day of delivering tacos. He was still thinking about the scales, and about his shirt, and about the truck, and what Angelo said earlier. he was concerned. WAS he shrinking? Or was it a mistake with the dry cleaners? It was hard to know for sure. 'Maybe Angelo is lying.' he thought. 'Heh. Wouldn't be the first time.' Then, another thought, this time a worrying thought, struck him like a bullet. 'But then again, what if he isn't? I mean, what if I could be shrinking? I could end up a freak of nature myself - 'Come to Dos Bros Tacos, home of the World's Fastest Snail, and also, of the World's Smallest Taco Seller!' He parked his taco truck right outside Dos Bros Tacos, and dashed to the male restrooms of the plaza. He stared at himself in the restroom mirror. His shirt looked a little somewhat bigger on his shoulders, and his hat seemed a little bigger on his head. I must have shrunk a few inches. Tito guessed as he came out and went back to the Dos Bros Tacos place. Overall, he didn't seem too worried about his problem. But if he'd been worried a lot, there'd be no concern over what would happen next... So far, Tito doesn't know he's shrinking... yet. But, little does he know the weird is just happening... Read and Review![Chapter 3] (i do not, and never will, own Turbo.) Chapter 3: Angelo's Discovery All too soon, evening arrived. Angelo was busy closing the Dos Bros Tacos shop. He waved goodbye to Bobby, Paz, and Kim-Ly as they headed for their homes. Now, all he had to do was wait for Tito to finish, so they could go home. Soon, Tito finished, and came out. He was a little smaller. He could see Angelo looking stunned. 'I guess the big bro just got bigger!' Angelo thought. He & Tito walked off to the truck. Turbo saw everything. 'Something is wrong.' he thought, seeing them driving away. Angelo drove as Tito sat in the seat of the truck, feeling concerned. He now seemed almost 2 thirds of his size. He almost pictured himself shrinking so small, he shrunk right out of existence in a cloud of smoke. He chuckled slightly at that, but then became worried. back at the apartment... Angelo and Tito returned. Tito was now approximately half his size. \"Tito, don't think I haven't noticed how short you are.\" he said sternly. \"Angelo, i think maybe that I am... shrinking!\" Tito sighed. Angelo facepalmed. \"Look, Tito, I think you're working too hard. Tomorrow, we're quittin early at 3. so you can relax.\" Tito looked quiet. he nodded. \"I'm just gonna turn in.\" he said. he walked off to the bathroom, his clothing trailing. Angelo noticed, but didn't say anything. After his shower, Tito sat down on his bed in dumb shock. He was now lower than before, almost a third of his size. \"That's odd.\" he said to himself suddenly, \"I don't remember my bed being this big.\" He stared down at his sandals, that had now came off his feet, and wriggled his toes with a wince. his face tugged into a smile briefly before fading back into a worried frown. Well, I certainly look like I'm shrinking, so I might end up shrinking so small, i'll become a freak myself. Tito quickly shrugged it off. \"Maybe Angelo's right.\" he said. \"I am working too hard. I just need to have a rest, and forget the whole thing.\" So he started undressing out of his huge bathrobe, and then he stared at his hat, and put it on. Now clad in only his loose looking underwear, he struggled to get back onto his huge bed, which now, seemed bigger than before... By this time, Angelo had just got out of the shower, and was now cleaning his teeth. It was then he suddenly felt a sharp tingle in his belly, just like Tito had before him. It spread from the top of his head to the tips of his fingers to the ends of his toes. He seemed normal. Or was he smaller? it was hard to say. That very night, Tito, now lying on his huge bed, in his huge undies, and his huge hat, was asleep. in the morning, he'd think the nightmare was over, but alas, the nightmare was just beginning... Omg! Tito guessed he IS shrinking! but the nightmare will get worse! READ AND REVIEW![Chapter 4] (i do not, and never will, own Turbo.) Chapter 4: Tito the Teeny Tiny Taco-Man As the dark night went on, Tito hardly slept, for he was having a nightmare, a nightmare of him, now shrunk to snail size, and Turbo, escaping from a giant Guy Gagne, chasing them down the track of the Indianopolis 500. At once, Tito saw Turbo's speed power ran down, and Guy was getting closer. Tito just managed to divert Turbo to the other racing snails, giving him a push to kickstart his speed. at once the huge footsteps of Guy knocked Tito off his feet. He was trapped, and could hardly get up. He watched in horror as Guy removed first one of his shoes, then one of his socks, then, raised his humongus bare foot in the air. \"Now you'll pay for having a snail ruin my career!\" he boomed, and he brought his foot down... Tito gasped, and awoke with a start, and he was sweating a lot . He saw the sunlight streaming through the apartment window. 'Don't worry, Tito.' He thought. 'There's nothing to worry about. You're gonna be fine. What happened was just a slight hiccup. Maybe Angelo is right. You are working too hard. Maybe you'll be normal again in no ti-' Tito's thoughts were rudely interrupted when he tripped and fell flat on his face. Tito pushed himself up, and it was then he saw what he tripped on: a huge pair of undies that were like his own. Next to them; a huge yellow Dos Bros Tacos hat that looked exactly like his! Looking at the tag on the back of the huge undies, he saw his name, 'Tito Lopez' on it. 'These are mine!' he thought. Then he looked at the hat and saw a label above the rim, which read 'If found, please return to Tito Lopez at Dos Bros Tacos' . in panic, he gasped. He saw his bedspread, which now looked like as big as the ocean, or even bigger. and he saw his hat looked about the size of a car! and his Mexican Mariachi band alarm clock was now the size of the Big Ben clocktower! It took Tito only at least 10 seconds, or even less, give or take, to realize... \"I've been... SHRUNK!\" Tito exclained in shock. Also, by this time, Angelo was weighing himself on the bathroom scales, but then he noticed something odd - instead of his usual weight [60lbs], it was a bit lower than normal [55lbs]. 'Surely I can't be shrinking as well!' he thought. But his concern was far from how bad Tito's concerns were. There sat Tito, on his huge bed, stark naked, and about the size of a doll. \"How could this have happened?\" he said. \"I really am the World's Smallest Taco Seller!\" Tito covered his eyes in fear and worry. all at once, the door opened, and Angelo came in, fully dressed in his uniform. Tito decided to get Angelo's attention. He got off the bed and ran toward his bro, who, to Tito's size, looked now the size of an office building. \"Tito!\" he called. \"Where are you?\" \"Bro! Down here!\" he yelled. But it made no effect; Tito was far too tiny to be heard. He ran up to Angelo's pant leg and tugged. Angelo's pants slipped. He pulled them up... And there he saw Tito. \"Tito?!\" he shouted, in a loud voice that made Tito wince and cover his ears. He picked Tito up and put him on the table. \"What on earth?\" Tito explained everything. \"I do not exactly know how this happened, but I'll make sure the doctor finds out what happened.\" Angelo phoned the doctor to make an appointment for the day after, then put Tito in his pocket, and drove to the Starlight Plaza Mall. Turbo was surprised to see Angelo going in, he could hardly see Tito at all. If only he knew... Once at the Dos Bros Tacos place, Angelo got Tito outta his pocket. Then, he fashioned a makeshift Tarzan shoal from a napkin. Tito stared at it and then put it on. it looked... awkward, but at least he didn't have to go round au natural. \"Do you like it?\" Angelo asked his doll-sized little brother. \"Si, I do, gracias, bro.\" Tito said, shaking his giant big bro's hand. Well, not quite hand; more like hand and finger. but still, it's good enough. OK. How will things turn out now? You'll have to wait & see. READ AND REVIEW! ","Summary":" Post-movie.

Normal POV Everyone was back at Avalon High after the summer break and no one new about the reincarnation of camalot. So Ali was walking down the main corridor because it was first period and she had to get some books from her locker. Once she got there and took her books out someone came up behind her full on, and ofcourse it had to be will.\"hey will you know i hate it when you do that\", allie said,\"yeah i know but i've got something really important to tell you\" will said as h took a step back from her.\" Morgana is here\"! \"what!\" allie said as she just stood there wide eyed. \"she was here this morning, she was in my class, she came up to me and threatened me that if you don't meet her in the history class room at lunch she will kill Miles\", \"OH MY GOD\" allie said as she started to tear up. It was 3rd peiod and the gang went out onto the field to have lunch, little did they know that two shadows where watching them like hawks, they were morganna and Elaine. Anyway, everyone was sat under a tree eating their lunch, lance had a chocolate muffin, jen had a fruit salad, miles had a ham sandwich, marco had a bacon bap, will had a chocolate sandwich and allie had an apple. When allie wasn't looking marganna quickly zapped the apple, so it was like the snow white apple. So while everyone else wasn't looking they quickly snuck away. Allie thought she saw something but forgot about it, that's when she took a bit of the enchanted apple, she bit into it and all of a sudden she couldn't break she chocked out a gasp and everyone looked at her, she dropped the apple from where she was standing and collapsed, everyone gasped when she hit the floor with a thump, everyone got up and surrounded allie, she was chocking and gasping for breath, lance acted fast, by picking her up and pushing her stomach from behind finally after about 3 minutes allie was turning purple, she swallowed the peice of apple then collapsed backwards onto lance gasping as she could finally breathe. Everyone relaxed but made sure allie was ok. She was perfectly fine, but just needed to get her breath back.[Chapter 2] Morganna and Elaine were extremely angery that their plan a had failed but there was always plan b. They dicided to coax allie into coming to them with bate. So they started kidnapping the football team one by one ending with will, jen and marco. Allie was waiting by the door after school for her friends but they were no where to be seen so she went looking for them they she heard a screem that sounded just like jen's she ran like hell to the history classroom to find morganna gripping jens hair vey tightly and lifting her about a foot of the floor, then she noticed all the jocks and her friends were there aswell, they were all tied to the wall. \"allie run\" will shouted she went to run but the door closed in her face then Elaine stood in the middle of the room with a scared jen by lance who was comforting her. Elaine and morganna stood there infront of everyone, the they started to incarnate spell suddenly 4 black tenticles came out of the walls and grabbe dallie by her wists and waist then they hooysted her into the air and threw her across the room and into the wall by will.\"allie!\" will shouted as she hit the wall with an increadable force. She fell to the ground motionless. Everyone gasped. Morganna dragged her back to the centre of the room where she go out a jewel plated dagger and held it in the air\"this will be the end of king Arthur she shouted before plunging the knife towards allie's heart. Allie woke up just in time to dodge the descending blade bfore it hit her. Her friends gasped in relief but quickly took on the same state of panic as morganna came running towards allie wit the blade. She dodged it and threw morganna to the floor and Elaine went down aswell. Allie started to undo everyone, then once she undid everyone they all ran out of the school, only to be stopped by non other than morganna and Elaine, morganna acted quickly as she thrusted the blade into allie's stomach, the she twisted it and allie collapsed on the floor, morganna smirked then in a green flash she and Elaine disappeared. Everyone gasped as they saw poor allie on the floor with a blade sticking out of her side, jen ran up to her quickly and pulled the knife out only to earn an earsplitting scream from allie, lance ran up and placed his hands in allie to try and stop the picked her up and handed her to miles \"heal her\" he said mile suddenly used his staff to heal her. Will placed her down and tried to wake her which actually worked, she awoke to see the worried faces of her friends, she sat up only to be greeted with extreme pain in her stomach. She groaned but smiled because she was okay. It was just a flesh wound. Miles had saved her life. She thanked him and everyone asked whether she was ok, she said she was fine. Will took her home and everything went back to normal, everyone never saw the two witches again, they all thought that it was over. Oh how wrong they all were. . .

Her hair was in her face and she raised her wet hands to move the strands away and saw that she was lying in the mud at the edge of a river. She could only assume she had washed up on shore and looked up at the sky wildly, but felt something calm in her as she stared at the too bright moon. Allie closed her eyes and took a deep breath before getting to her feet and made her way up the hill as steadily as she could. She even crawled up it to make sure she didn't go sliding back down. The blonde wondered how she was still alive as she was sure she was going to drown, but it seemed she might have just needed some air. She shivered in the night air and used the tree at the top of the hill to keep herself up and decided to go home as whatever was after her didn't seem to be around anymore. Another shiver ran through her before she saw a car driving down the road and tried to wave it down, but if seeing a soaking wet girl with a wild look in her eyes made people keep going, Allie couldn't really fault them for it. Sighing she decided to walk home herself. So trekking along the road, she hugged herself and hoped she'd get dry soon. Allie soon came across her home and saw that her parents were home now from their night out. She found enough energy in her to run the rest of the way home, walking into the house with a smile on her face, feeling safer than before this all happened. \"Mom, dad, please don't freak.\" She said and stopped dead as she saw that her mother was sitting worried on the couch and seemed to be crying and her father was on the phone. \"Yes sir, our daughter is missing and we tried her boyfriend's but he said she asked him to leave he hasn't seen her since.\" Her father said. Allie felt her eyes widen. \"Dad, what are you talking about? I'm standing right in front of you.\" She said moving in front of her parents. Her father continued to ignore her though and Allie felt frustrated. \"Don't you see me?\" she shouted, but neither of her parents reacted. \"Why? Why are you-\" she froze as her father got off the phone and walked right through her . Allie's face was one of shock and disbelief. She stared down at her hands and backed away from her parents as they talked about how she was missing and she couldn't believe what she was hearing. But she couldn't say anything as they didn't seem to hear her, and they couldn't see her either, so was she dead or something? No, Allie dismissed the idea because if she was dead then it would mean she could go through walls and stuff, but she couldn't as she used the door which was solid and when she jumped, she didn't go through the floor either. So what was going on? Not being able to watch her parents talk about how she was 'missing' any longer while not being able to tell them she actually was in front of them, she turned away and walked up the stairs to her room, hoping when she woke up in the morning this was all just a bad dream. Allie opened her eyes and saw the sun peeking through the window in her room and yawned while stretching her arms above her head and swung her legs over the bed before getting out of it. Her smile crashed once she remembered what had happened the day before and though about how deceiving it was that she could still touch things like there wasn't anything wrong. With a heavy heart, she made her way down the stairs and out the door, not wanting to be around this place any longer and watch her parents walk through her like she didn't exist. Instead she decided to try the school and hoped that maybe someone there would be able to see her. She stretched her legs before getting into a runners pose and took off for the school, feeling the air leave her as she realized she'd run a lot faster than she ever could. Just what had happened the night before after passing out? She couldn't be dead she reasoned as she wouldn't be able to touch anything, so all that was left to answer was just how she was like this in the first place. Though in the back of her mind, Allie thought it had something to do with the whole reincarnation thing. Yet another reason this whole thing sucked. Since she was at the school before the other-Allie felt her breath hitch as she corrected herself- her former classmates arrive, so she walked over to the bench by the school and sat down, wrapping her arms around herself and hoped she would be able to be seen by at least one of them. She vainly hoped it would be Miles, but she wasn't holding her breath for anyone to notice her. As the first bus pulled up, Allie brought her knees up to her chest, cringing as each one of them walked past her. She saw none of them even glance at her, and put her head on her knees. It was just hopeless- \"Allie?\"[Chapter 2] It couldn't be; Allie didn't think it could, but when she looked up, her eyes locked with Marco and she felt her breath hitch again, but this was the only time it could be considered a good reaction. \"You can see me?\" she whispered hopefully. Marco raised a brow. \"Why wouldn't I be able to?\" he quipped. \"Where were you? Your parents are worried about you.\" \"After Will left, I was chased out of my house by… somethingcalling me Arthur, like he didn't know my name. Mordred did know my name though, so there's another point it probably wasn't him.\" \"Did he say anything else?\" Marco questioned. \"He said that Mordred wasn't the only thing I had to worry about, but I was so terrified that something was out to get me that I almost believed it was him.\" Allie replied grimly and Marco nodded. She noticed the students walking by were giving the teen strange looks, and she knew it must look like he was talking to thin air. \"There's another thing, when I woke up at the shore of the river and walked home, my father walked right through me.\" Marco stared at her with disbelief. \"But…but you can't be dead!\" \"I don't think I'm not,\" Allie replied and gestured to the bench, \"I'd go through this if I were, and my heart is still beating.\" She said placing a hand over her heart. Marco raised a hand before slowly placing it over Allie's own, as if to affirm that she was actually there. The feel of another's presence made Allie want to cry; she wasn't being ignored, nor was she being treated like she didn't exist. \"Why can I still touch you then?\" \"I don't know.\" Allie whispered, but her was voice strengthened by the fact at least one person could see her. \"But maybe the book can help me, and if not, then I'll find the answers on my own…no matter how long it takes.\" \"And then everyone else will believe you're still here like I do.\" Marco said with conviction. Allie felt herself smile despite the rather grim situation. \"You still believe in me?\" \"Whether or not you are dead or not, you're still meant for something better, and I'll always believe in you.\" Marco replied. \"Even when I turned out not to be the Arthur you expected?\" Allie asked sardonically. \"Even then.\" Marco said dryly and Allie snickered. \"Then wish me luck.\" She said clenching his hand for a moment, not knowing for how long she could last without this contact. It felt physically painful for her to let go, but she needed to do this. \"Good luck.\" Marco said nodding at her. Allie nodded back before she ran at her abnormally fast pace home, hoping the key was under the doormat. Since her parents weren't home, it would make retrieving the book just a bit less painful, but she knew it'd hurt still no matter how long she was going to be gone. The blonde knew it was pitiful to think she could come back without answers, but she still wanted the option, no matter how in vain it might turn out to be. She sprinted up the steps of the staircase quickly, going into her room and grabbed her bag before dumping out the contents and stuffed the book into it, along with a sweater for when she got cold as that still affected her it seemed. When she ran downstairs, she paused and went into the kitchen to take a dull butter knife out of the drawer, watching in fascination as Excalibur was once more in her hands. Conviction coursed through her as she stared down at the sword and clenched her fist around the handle. \"I'm still here.\" She whispered to herself. \"I just need to remember that; this wouldn't be working if I were dead.\" With that firm thought resounding in her head, Allie locked the door upon exiting and sped away from the town she was promised was going to be her home. She looked back at it regretfully for all she would never be able to do, but breathed in deeply before she continued to run. And even if she could never interact with anyone other than Marco, she still existed; and no matter how small a consolation prize it was, it reminded her that she was still there. She was going to get the answers and let others know she existed too. No matter how long it might take her.

Whiplash shivered; he wanted nothing more than to curl up inside his shell forever, but he knew that wasn't an option. Not now. Not after what had happened between him and Breakneck. He had to be strong. There was just no other choice. Now that he could never return to he and his mentor's old home, the only thing left to do was to find a new place to live. But where can I go? He wondered desperately, fear suddenly creeping into his heart. Whiplash was a fit, young snail - despite Breakneck's shameful intentions, he had been excellently mentored. He rarely broke down, rarely gave up, and was wise beyond his years, but this hopeless situation was almost too much for him to handle. Tears pricked the corners of Whiplash's eyes as he forced himself through the driving rain. Suddenly, he stopped dead in his tracks. Something had caught Whiplash's eye. Through the silvery downpour, he could see lights - bright lights. They were blurred by the rain, but they were there, glittering through the mist like tiny welcome signs. The tears that threatened to pour from Whiplash all but vanished; the rain suddenly let up a little, the freezing sheets of water fading into a light drizzle. Now Whiplash could see the sign that topped the small building which lay in front of him. DOS BROS TACOS. Whiplash felt a tug in his heart - not a tug of pain, nor of fear, but something else. Belonging. This is home.[Chapter 2] After Whiplash settled into Starlight Plaza, the weeks seemed to speed by like a snail on a racetrack. The feeling of belonging in the purple snail's heart swelled with each passing day; it was like the plaza was meant to be his home. He had everything he could possibly need - plenty of food from Dos Bros, lots of space to cruise around, and perhaps most importantly, distance from Breakneck. What more could a snail want? Somehow, something seemed to be missing from Whiplash's life. He tried to ignore the emptiness at first, but pretending it wasn't there didn't make it go away. If anything, acting like his life was complete only made the nights longer and lonelier. Whiplash yearned for company. Sure, the Starlight Plaza shopkeepers were friendly enough - especially Tito, who always provided Whiplash with plenty of leftover tomatoes - but it just wasn't the same. Whiplash longed to have other snails to talk to, to befriend, to race with. It took weeks, but eventually that wish came true. It was a warm summer night, with only a slight breeze drifting through the air. Starshine filtered down, dappling the ground with silver light; Whiplash had just settled down to dig into a late dinner consisting of two thick, juicy tomato slices. Before he got a chance to take one bite, however, a rustling noise sounded from around the corner. Startled, Whiplash snapped into action, firing up his engine. \"Who's there?\" he demanded. When no response came, Whiplash stared around defensively. \"I know there's somebody out there!\" he called into the shadows. \"Now come out!\" Whiplash braced himself for the worst; anything could emerge from that blackness - a tiger beetle with a packet of salt, a trio of vicious crows... even Breakneck. He opened his mouth to call out again, but quickly shut it, shock washing over him like a wave; a small blue snail crawled reluctantly into the open, eyes flashing with fear. Whiplash let his engine die away, hardly able to hide his surprise. This snail was young, no more than a kid - and a terrified kid at that. He was trembling from eyestalks to tail, and looked as lost as Whiplash had been before he'd discovered Starlight Plaza. \"Hey there,\" Whiplash said softly, his voice unusually gentle. He didn't want to frighten this snail even more than he already was. \"H-hi,\" the young snail stammered. \"It's okay,\" Whiplash tried to comfort him. \"I'm not gonna hurt you, kid. I'm Whiplash. What's your name?\" \"S-Skidmark,\" the blue snail answered quietly. \"My name is Skidmark.\"[Chapter 3] AN- I'd like to take a minute to thank everyone for your kind reviews. It really makes me smile to know that people are actually reading and enjoying something I've written. :D I'm sorry it's taken me so long to publish this chapter; I haven't forgotten about the story, I've just been really busy. I think I'll be writing more often now that things have settled down a bit. Thanks for being so patient with me! Skidmark. Whiplash rolled the name around in his mind like he was tasting a fresh slice of tomato. He glanced at the younger snail; even though Skidmark was still quaking with fear, there was something about him that made Whiplash wonder if he'd make a good racer. Was this how Breakneck had felt when he'd met Whiplash for the first time? Stop it, The purple snail told himself firmly. There would be plenty of time to contemplate Skidmark's future later on. There was no sense in getting ahead of himself when there were more urgent matters to take care of. \"I bet you're hungry,\" Whiplash said to the younger snail. He pushed one of the tomato slices towards him; Skidmark tensed, looking ready to flee. \"It's okay, there's plenty for both of us,\" Whiplash reassured him. Reluctantly, Skidmark edged forward and took a couple of uncertain bites; soon, however, the small blue snail began to devour the slice in famished gulps. \"So, uh... how'd you end up in Starlight Plaza?\" Whiplash asked, curiosity pricking at him. Skidmark glanced up from his food, still obviously hesitant to come out of his shell (figuratively, of course.) \"It's okay, you don't have to tell me if you don't want to.\" Whiplash wondered if he'd been too abrupt. \"I... I'm lost.\" Skidmark said quietly, not moving his gaze from the tomato slice. \"I don't know where my family is.\" Pity twisted in Whiplash's heart. \"You can stay here, if you'd like,\" he offered gently. \"Until they come looking for you, I mean...\" \"Really?\" Skidmark looked Whiplash in the eye for the first time, his blue gaze tinged with relief. \"Of course.\" When Skidmark had finished the tomato slice, he curled into his shell sleepily. Whiplash tried to fall asleep himself, but his mind was whirling. Was he going to be a mentor at last?[Chapter 4] A/N: I'm sorry it's been so long since this was updated. I was going through some severe writer's block , but now I that I have a better idea of where I want the story to go, I think I'll be updating more often. :D One morning a few days later, Whiplash was running laps around the taco stand when an explosion shattered the still air. Smoke followed the earsplitting sound, billowing into the air in a choking gray mist. Whiplash closed his stinging eyes; coughing, he rushed over to the source of the sound, shock brimming in his heart. What could have caused an explosion like that? I thought Tito and Angelo got that stove fixed! Whiplash halted; with the thick clouds of smoke, it was difficult to see where things were, but he guessed he was somewhere behind the taco stand. Blinking against the smoke, he spotted a small blue snail wearing a lightbulb as a helmet and holding a snail-sized fire extinguisher. Skidmark?! When the smoke cleared, Whiplash spotted an array of test tubes laid out in front of the younger snail. \"Skidmark! What on Earth are you doing?!\" Skidmark glanced back at the older snail. \"Do you really wanna know?\" he replied, setting down the fire extinguisher. Whiplash guessed that he wasn't supposed to answer that, but he glared at Skidmark. \"You bet your shell I want to know!\" he shouted. Skidmark shrugged and began to explain how he was experimenting with the chemicals in the test tubes. Most of what he said made absolutely no sense to Whiplash, but the older snail was stunned nonetheless. What had happened to the shy, reluctant Skid he had gotten used to? This was certainly a jarring change. Had Skidmark finally come out of his timid nutshell? The weeks after the explosion seemed to fly by. At first Whiplash was skeptical about the changes in Skidmark's behavior, but he soon warmed up to the kid's personality. Sort of. It took a lot of prodding to get Skid interested in racing; much to Whiplash's frustration, he preferred spending time in the laboratory to spending time on the racetrack. But once Skidmark took a look at Whiplash's racing shell, he realized that he could combine his inventing skills with his mentor's hobby. He spent lots of time building new shells, and he was constantly upgrading them. Whiplash had to test out several failed creations, from a prototype shellicopter to a solar-powered jet engine, but the constant explosions were a small price to pay for a racing partner. Whiplash trained Skidmark hard, competing with him and teaching him the best skills and strategies. In return, Skidmark's inventions made Whiplash a faster, better racer. They worked together; they were a team. One evening, Whiplash slid into the taco stand, looking for Skidmark. It was time for racing practice, and the small blue snail was nowhere in sight. \"Skid!\" he called out. \"Come on, we're -\" \"Shh!\" Whiplash glanced up to see Skidmark peering down at him from a countertop. What is he doing? The older snail revved up his engine and joined Skid on the counter. \"Skid, what are you -\" he broke off abruptly. Skidmark's eyes were glued to the small tv screen a few inches away. Dramatic music was coming from the television, and a title flashed across the screen. \" Discovering Bigfoot?\" Whiplash stared at Skidmark in disbelief. \"There's gonna be a marathon tonight,\" Skidmark replied, without taking his eyes from the screen. \"Fifty back-to-back episodes. I'm gonna have to miss practice.\" Whiplash shook his head, not in the mood to argue. There were many things he still had yet to learn about Skidmark, but after all, they were a team. Little did either of them know, they would soon be a team of three.[Chapter 5] A/N:: Ugh, I'm sorry I haven't updated in so long. I say \"I'll be updating more often!\" but then I disappear for a million thousand weeks. -slaps self- xD Anyway, here's Chapter 5... at long last, we finally get to see who's next to join the newly-forming FAST crew! Hope you enjoy c: (Oh, and by the way, happy Thanksgiving to those who are celebrating it today. If not, then just have a dang good day, okay? ^^) Bright sunlight washed down over a long stretch of bare ground. Whiplash turned to Skidmark, revving up his engine. \"You ready, garden snail?\" \"Oh, I was born ready.\" Skid smirked. \"We'll see about that.\" Whiplash retorted with a small, challenging smile. On that note, the two snails took off down the track in an explosion of dust. Skidmark quickly took the lead, pulling ahead of his mentor. \"Oh, no you don't,\" Whiplash muttered, narrowing his eyes. \"The student isn't gonna beat the mentor - not today.\" \"Wanna bet?\" Skid tossed back over his shoulder. \"You bet I do.\" Whiplash responded with a smirk. The dark purple snail's engine revved; he caught up to Skid in the blink of an eye. The two snails raced along side-by-side for a few moments, each trying to pass each other. At last, Whiplash gained on Skidmark, leaving the young racer on the dust. He laughed triumphantly, pumping an eyestalk in the air. \"I told you, Skid, the student cannot beat the -\" Suddenly, a loud crashing sound, followed by a shout, sliced through the air. Startled, Whiplash slammed on the brakes. Spinning around, he spotted Skidmark sprawled a few inches away; he hurried over to the scene, eyes wide. \"Skid! What happened?\" As Whiplash got closer, he realized with a pang that Skidmark was entangled with a stranger - a small, pinkish-colored snail who he'd apparently run into... literally. \"Get offa me, you klutz!\" the stranger snapped, her eyes blazing. As Skidmark tried to stand up, looking flustered, Whiplash stared at the unfamiliar snail. \"Who are you?\" he demanded, an edge creeping into his voice. He tended to be wary of strangers, especially those who appeared out of nowhere when he and his student were having their morning run on the track. Whiplash narrowed his eyes, studying the stranger. She was young, probably around Skid's age. She wore bright red lipstick, and her golden eyes had a fiery edge to them. \"The name's Brittany,\" she responded, her voice sharp. Whiplash didn't blink an eye. \"Well, then, Brittany, how about telling us where you came from and what you're doing here?\" Brittany locked her gaze with Whiplash's; she clearly wasn't the type to back down easily. \"Oh, I've been watching you guys for days,\" she answered smoothly. \"I've seen it all - the stunts, the speed, those ridiculous shells you're wearing...\" her eyes briefly flitted over Whiplash's racing shell before meeting his gaze once more. \"I know everything about you two; I know how you live. \" Skidmark looked nervous. \"E-everything?\" he stammered. Whiplash narrowed his eyes, glaring at the sly female snail. \"So basically, you've been stalking us?!\" Brittany shrugged. \"I prefer 'observing.' Anyway, I was on my way out to talk to you face-to-face for the first time, when this weirdo came crashing into me.\" She shot a glare in Skidmark's direction; his face was as red as an overripe tomato. Whiplash blinked. \"And you wanted to talk to me about what, exactly?\" he demanded. Brittany smiled, her eyes narrowed. \"About racing, of course. I'd like to join your team.\" her voice held a note of defiance, as though she were challenging them to reject her. \" What? \" Whiplash boggled at the young stranger, unable to keep the shock out of his voice. \"You come crashing onto our track, out of the blue, without warning, a complete stranger, and you expect me to let you join us?\" \"Yep.\" Brittany smiled slyly. \"Simple as that.\" \"No. No way,\" Whiplash shook his head. \"Absolutely not happening.\" \"Why not?\" Brittany shot back, a bit of aggression creeping into her voice. \"With a shell like yours, I'd be able to race just as fast as you two - probably faster.\" Whiplash blinked. \"It's not about your shell,\" he answered. How am I supposed to explain that I'm not about to let some creepy stalker live with me? That I'm not going to teach a snail that doesn't even respect my privacy how to race? \"So what's holding you back?\" Brittany retorted. \"Well... for one thing,\" Whiplash reasoned, \"you don't even have a racing name. How's that going to look to our opponents? Here comes the star racing team of the century... Whiplash, Skidmark, and Brittany!\" Brittany didn't bat an eyelid. \"So I'll change my name,\" she shrugged. \"No big deal.\" Whiplash stared at her. \"Well, you just have an answer for everything, don't you?\" he muttered. \"Yep, I do.\" she smiled. Whiplash blinked, studying the younger snail. \"Tell you what, Brittany, if you can think up a suitable racing name, I'll think about letting you join.\" Brittany grinned. \"Hmm... how about Flame?\" \"Doesn't really suit you.\" \"Fire?\" \"Nah.\" \"Blaze?\" \"Getting warmer.\" \"...Burn. I'll change my name to Burn.\" the pinkish-colored snail smiled triumphantly. Whiplash groaned in defeat. \"You're in. Welcome to the team.\" ","Summary":" Rain poured down in cold gray sheets, blurring the full moon overhead and frothing in puddles on th"},{"Movie":"Avalon High","Title":"Resolute Protector","Author":"TrueCybertronianAtSpark","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8845927","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Ok, here is the final edited first two chapters to the story Resolute Protecter.

To all you readers, please tell me what you think. :) Chapter 1 – Medieval Roulette \"Okay,\" Mr. Moore announced gaining his class's attention. \"First thing we are going to do is to break up into teams to write research papers. You will draw your topics out of this.\" Pulling out a medieval knight's helmet, he started going around the classroom having students draw their essay topics out of the helmet. \"Courtney, you're with Ton: the architecture of Camelot. Interesting . . . Will, you're with Karen.\" \"Can't I be with Jen?\" he protested. \"No, she's with Lance.\" Drawing his topic, Will held the text up to his teacher. \"Ah, how apropos: the sports of Camelot. Jennifer: the tragedy of Camelot. Now, your paper is gonna be about the love triangle between King Arthur, his wife Guinevere, and his best friend, Sir Lancelot. Ultimately, it destroyed Arthur and uh . . . Camelot itself. Bit of a downer. Miles, you're with Allie.\" The boy disagreed, \"I'd rather work alone.\" \"I'd rather be eating pineapple on a beach in Hawaii, but that's not going to happen either,\" Moore replied sarcastically. \"Fine, I guess you'll do,\" Miles said. \"Wow, thanks,\" the blonde said retrieved her topic from the offered helmet and was surprised when the teacher announced their topic. \"The Order of the Bear. What? I've never heard of that.\" \"So much for the easy A.\" \"Ask your parents, I'm sure they have heard of the order.\" The professor paced over two rows and leaned on his cane. \"Velma, you're with Marco.\" In the back of the room, a girl raised her hand and reached into the helmet. \"The Story of Mordred. You and your partner will tell Mordred's specific role in the downfall of Camelot.\" Once the teacher had moved onto his next victim, Velma turned and seeing that Marco was looking at her, nodded at him. 'This is going to be interesting,' she concluded and returned her attention to the front of the room, where Mr. Moore was saying, \"Alright, now this is a semester paper. Good thing, you have two months to complete it. Bad thing, you're stuck with your partner for two months; just don't kill each other.\" Laughter rippled across the room. When the bell rang, the students rushed toward the door. Getting out of her seat, Velma walked over while Marco was rummaging through his bag and placed a piece of paper on his desk containing her e-mail address and name. Then without a word, she walked out of the room.[Chapter 2] Chapter 2 – Genesis Getting out of her seat, Velma walked over while Marco was rummaging through his bag and placed a piece of paper on his desk containing her e-mail address and name. Then without a word, she walked out of the room. Marco POV: I stood at the door of a small single-story house, holding a piece of paper with its address in my hands. My assigned partner, Velma Taylor, had been surprisingly prompt when replying to my e-mail and provided her address to get this essay done. I just wanted to get this over with. I had gotten into another fight with Will at home. So, I figured that I might as well come over here and be done with it. When I rang the doorbell, a girl about sixteen years old with light brown hair, wearing black jeans, and a black wife beater answered. Looking at me for a second, she motioned with her head for me to get inside and closed the door behind me. The first thing I noticed was that the place was filled with books, but in an orderly manner. The second thing I noticed was a very large dog growling at me. I jumped back in alarm before hearing Velma placate the mutt, \"Adonis, he's fine.\" She then turned and started inspecting me with her light blue eyes. \"Don't worry. He will only hurt you if I tell him to.\" Warning heeded, I shrugged my backpack higher up onto my shoulder and followed her into the living room. She motioned for me to sit down and walked over to a book shelf on the far wall. While inspecting the titles, she spoke, \"Okay, Campbell. Let's see how good you are at learning with all those classes you skipped.\" I was surprised, not that she knew my family name, but that she was so blunt. No one other than my mom and her husband had dared to talk to me that way. \"What did you say to me?\" I demanded, not sitting down. \"Oh, come on,\" she said, not turning around. \"Do you actually think that I would let anyone into my house without finding out more about them? Besides you wouldn't hurt me; not if Adonis or I have anything to say about it.\" Pulling out several books the size of my head, she put them on the round metallic-accented wooden table in front of me. Then, she sat across the table in a black leather seat. \"Please, sit and you can cut the tough guy crap. It doesn't affect me.\" I sat down feeling out of place, stunned, and amused. But as requested, I relaxed a bit slightly and mentally foreshadowed, 'This should be interesting.' [ Marco POV In 3rd Person: Marco stood at the door of a small single-story house, holding a piece of paper with its address in his hands. His assigned partner, Velma Taylor, had been surprisingly prompt when replying to his e-mail and provided her address to get this essay done. He just wanted to get this over with. Marco had gotten into another fight with Will at home. So, he figured that he might as well get this done with rather than stay at his house. When Marco rang the doorbell, a girl about sixteen with light brown hair, wearing black jeans, and a black wife beater answered. Looking at him for a second, she motioned with her head for him to get inside and closed the door behind her visitor. The first thing he noticed was that the place was filled with books, but in an orderly manner. The second thing Marco noticed was a very large dog growling at him.

But as requested, he relaxed slightly and mentally foreshadowed, 'this should be interesting,' while opening one of the massive tomes. ] 3rd POV: After what seemed like hours of reading, Velma put down her book and summarized, \"Well, I guess we'll start by writing what we know so far about Mordred. We know Mordred was a druid, who formed a close bond with Morgana, Arthur and Merlin. But Merlin betrayed him and they have seemingly become enemies. Mordred was the first person to call Merlin by his druid name 'Emrys'. Kilgharrah, a seer, foresaw that Mordred would be responsible for the death of Arthur Pendragon and warned Merlin not to help the young druid. When Mordred had to choose between Arthur and Morgana, he chose Arthur because he believed in the good inside him. This made him a Knight of Camelot, but Merlin still did not trust him. When his love interest Kara was captured and executed by Arthur, he decided to turn against Camelot and ally himself with Morgana. He revealed Merlin's true identity to her. This may have been the reason for him bringing down Arthur. He succeeded in mortally wounding Arthur, but Arthur still had the strength to fatally wound Mordred.\" \"Mordred was either both the son and nephew of Arthur or his half-brother,\" Marco added. Getting up, she stretched and walked into an adjoining room. \"By Morgana, how time flies.\" Looking at his phone, Marco saw that hours had indeed passed: it was seven now. He had arrived at five. Marco started packing up when he heard Velma moving around in the other room when she called, \"Marco! Have you eaten?\" Shocked, he stopped what he was doing. No one had ever cared to ask if he had eaten \"No,\" he replied. \"Why does it matter?\" For several long minutes, all he heard was the sound of pots moving and buttons being moved about. Then, she called out in response, \"Because, one: you're a guest in my house; and two: you're a growing teenage boy. Now, sit.\" For a second time, he found himself being told what to do by a virtual stranger. He opened his mouth to speak, but Velma interrupted and placed two plates of steaming food on the table, where they were researching. \"No buts. Now, sit and eat.\" And so, he sat.[Chapter 3] Ok. Sorry it took so long but life have been busy and this chapter was difficult to write due to the character interaction and bonding. Hopefully ideas will come easer to me. Any-who… back to the story Marco lay in his bed reminiscing last night…. After he had sat down in the chair that Velma, all but man handled him into, a steaming plate was placed in front of him. Fuming he sat, staring at it not touching and glaring, infuriated that one girl were to order him about like that. He opened his mouth to tell her what he exactly thought about all this. But before the words could even be uttered in his mind he felt a prick in his conscious, how far he had fallen in his hatred for William... so far that he would even slander a girl? Something his mother had drilled into him at a young age, was the importance of respecting a woman. Contrary to what people said and thought he refused to hurt a girl, no matter who. So instead he picked up a fork and placed a pile of steaming hot food into his mouth. Other than the burning in his mouth he identified it as chicken alfriedo. Sputtering he picked up the glass that was slid over to him and took a big gulp of something delicious and unidentifiable. Laughing Velma asked him, \" My cooking wasn't that bad was it?\" Taking another sip Marco said, \" You made that? No, actually your food wasn't bad at all. Its just that I'm vegetarian.\" Grinning she said,\" That is the only meal I really know how to make. My mom was a master chef. She was determined that I was going to follow in her foot steps, but then...\" Looking down she trailed off and resumed her eating. About half way through the meal their awkward silence was interrupted by a scuttering and sliding of claws. Then suddenly Adonis the large German Shepard burst into the dining room, running after a green tennis ball. The ball bounced and rolled about as if trying to evade the large creature intent on its demise, only to come to a stop at the feet of Velma. Grabbing the ball she then began to play and wrestle with the dog, with Marco looking on in amazement. Pulling back her arm she released the ball only to have it land in his food. For a split second Marco just stared at the object, unaware of the impending doom rushing toward him. Propelling off of the chair the dog leaped into his lap, knocking him over, and chomped down on the ball before sitting on the poor boys chest. Marco struggled under him for a while before looking over at Velma for help. Obviously none was going to be coming from that direction, she was doubled over in laughter and when the dog dropped the now slimy and dinner flavored ball onto his face, her fits doubled in measure as she fell gasping to the floor, clutching the couch for support. Freeing his arm, he grabbed the slimy lump off of his face only to have it covered in doggie slobber. This was the last straw for the gasping girl, she fell completely on the floor motioning desperately for him to throw it. Once he did the dog leaped off of him. Somewhere in the chaos that ensued Marco found himself enjoying his time with this strange girl and her crazy dog. This feeling was shattered by the ringing of his phone, in the mist of laughing like crazy and tickling Velma. It was Will, summoning him home. After the polite thank you and the command to come again in two days, he left. He was confused, why was it that this one girl could make him feel so different? There was just something about her that made him want to stop being tuff and just be him. It was a feeling that made him feel insecure and frustrated. Why did it have to be him? In any other circumstances he would have simply walked away or said something mean and harsh. But since he was stuck with her for the term paper he would rather not spend all the time in hateful silence with her. Cursing, Mr Moore for his insane pairing he rolled over and resolved that he would to get the point across to the girl that he simply did not care and wanted this over with.

So I decided that my first fanfic should be about my favorite movie, Cloud 9. All credit goes to Disney This is a possible series of One Shots, and this one is about what would've happened when Will decided to coach Hog Doggers and Kayla joined. I decided to make this after re-watching that scene, because I saw Wills eyes, they kept looking at Kayla's lips than back up to meet her eyes. This might not make sense now, but it will ( ha, will, get it ) Plz give me more ideas in the comments They were standing right behind the half pipe when Kayla looked up. There she was, a dark haired border wearing a Swift team jacket. \"Looks like they didn't waste much time replacing me\" As she got a closer look at the border she stood in disbelief \"Wait a minute... is that\" \"Skye Sailor\" Sam said as he interrupted Kayla couldn't believe it \"But.. she's with Pro Ice in Aspen\" Will looked at her sympathetically while Dink blurted \"I've heard she's never lost\" As Kayla looked down she turned to Will, looking up and catching his gaze, saying \"You know, the Swifts didn't just kick me from their team. They also beat you, and you haven't competed since. Now they don't think either one of us is a threat. Wouldn't it be great to prove them wrong?\" Sam turned to look at Will, confused, asking \"What is she talking about?\" Kayla was still looking at Will. He took a deep breath in, and said \"Kayla's gonna join your team, and I'm gonna coach you\" Kayla sprung into Will's arms, he was shocked at first. Then, right before Kayla pulled away, melted into the hug. With Sam, jokingly saying \"Wait, wait. You mean you're gonna coach her. Right? Because, I mean, we all know that I don't need coaching. Cuz I'm the best, ever\" They all laughed. And as Will and Kayla walked back to Hot Doggers, he suddenly stopped, and grabbed Kayla's hand. When she turned around, he pulled her close. As they stared into each other's eyes, they could also feel each other's warm breath against their bitter cold faces. \"Kayla, I've been meaning to tell you this for a long time\" \"Will... what is it\" His eyes kept fluttering to her lips, then back to her eyes. Until he couldn't take it anymore, and gently pressed his lips to hers. The kiss lasted a couple seconds, and when they finally came up for air, with the biggest smiles on their faces, Kayla looked into Will's eyes, saying \"I love you too\" Hi guys!!! I know this is kinda short, buuuuuttttt I feel it's also super sweet and perfect just the way it is. And please leave me story suggestions in the comments Thx.. ","Summary":" Hey guys!!!

She left Will in her snow dust and he watched anxiously as Kayla got in position above the pipe. Will bit his lip as she dropped in and busted out her first few moves. Will let out a breath he didn't know he'd been holding. Then Kayla began the Cloud 9. At first it looked good, and Will thought she might actually be able to do it. But then everything went wrong. The tip of her board caught on the edge of the pipe and she went plummeting forward. Kayla thrust out her arms to catch herself, but she ended up flipping over. Will could hear the sickening crack of bones shattering from all the way across the pipe. The crowd went silent as Kayla's limp body slid to the bottom of the pipe. She lay on her stomach, completely still. \"KAYLA!\" Will screamed. He ran down to the edge of the pipe and slid towards the center, sprinting towards Kayla. Somehow a paramedic beat him to it, though. \"Stop right there. I need you to please stay back until the patient is stabilized.\" Another paramedic appeared. \"No, you have to let me go to her, please!\"Will yelled, struggling against the man who had to forcibly restrain him. \"I'm sorry sir, but you need to stay back.\" The paramedic said, his voice devoid of emotion. Will gulped back a sob and sank to his knees a few yards from where the two paramedics were attempting to help Kayla. The man who'd been restraining him joined the two helping Kayla, and Will sat on his knees, desperately trying to hold back the sobs threatening to escape. After a few minutes, sounds of worry came from the paramedics around Kayla. Will sat up, his eyes widening in terror as he tried to move back towards her. He could barely see over the paramedics shoulders. Kayla's tiny frame lay completely still on a stretcher. They'd removed her snowboarding helmet and heavy winter jacket and her skin had become pale and clammy, her whole body shaking. Will tried to get to her, but the medics picked up the stretcher and loaded it into the ambulance and took her away. Away from Will. He tried desperately to chase after the speeding ambulance. His mind told him it was useless, but his heart urged him on. Will ended up collapsing near the edge of the pipe. He dropped his head into his hands, trying to get a hold of himself. After a while, Will's mom appeared behind him. \"C'mon sweetie. Let's go back home.\" Andrea Cloud put a hand on her son's shoulder. \"Kayla.\" Will breathed. His eyes were void of emotion. He'd used up all his anxiety and worry already. Nothing was left. Will stood up and followed his mom. The next morning when Will woke up, he at first didn't remember what'd happened at Fire and Ice. But then it all came crashing back to him, and he almost collapsed under all the emotion and anxiety. He dropped back into his bed, covering his face with a pillow. He threw the pillow aside and took a deep breath before changing into some clothes off the floor and grabbing his phone. Will called the hospital number his mom had given him the previous night. \"Hello sir, how may I help you today?\" A soft voice said on the other end of the line. \"I'd like to visit my fr- girlfriend. Kayla Morgan. She just went in last night.\" Will replied, trying not to let his voice break. \"Okay, please hold for a moment.\" He tried to stay calm. He took a deep breath and attempted composure. \"I'm sorry sir, but she's going to be in surgery all day, so no visitors permitted. I'm sorry.\" The feminine voice said through the phone. \"Oh. Okay, thanks. Bye.\" Will hung up. Then he threw the phone across the room, trying not to yell in frustration and worry. Will drifted through the day without being able to focus on anything. His mom let him off work early, and he tried to snowboard, but even coming near the pipe was too much. Every time, Will could only see Kayla crashing to the ground again. He couldn't take it. He didn't care if she was in surgery, he was going to see her. Or at least find out when she was going to recover. Or if... No. He couldn't even finish that thought. Will burst into the hospital and asked the man at the reception desk where Kayla's room was. He found it easily. When he saw what was going on in that room, he couldn't even stand it. Will slid down the wall until he sat with his back to the wall and his head in his hands. The doctors had defibrillators. Will took a deep breath and tried to calm down so he wouldn't hyperventilate. She was going to be absolutely fine. He swore right then and there that as soon as she woke up he was going to kiss her right on the mouth. Will stood up slowly and looked into the room again. He didn't want to see what was going on in there. He was terrified of the sights that might meet his eyes. But he looked anyway; he had to know. The heart monitor ran steadily. She was okay. Kayla was okay! The doctors were slowly backing off, and Will got a good look at her. Her right arm was casted past her elbow and her left leg casted up to the knee. Thick cotton padding was wrapped around her torso, probably supporting broken ribs. She wouldn't be able to snowboard for months, but she was alive. And right then, that was all Will could ask for. ~^~Three days later~^~ Will's phone rang incessantly. He finally reached for it after shoving Donald off his lap. He picked up the phone. \"Hello?\" \"Hello, I need to speak with Mr. William Cloud.\" \"That's me.\" \"I'm calling to inform you that Miss Kayla Morgan is conscious and will accept visitors.\" \"Oh my gosh. Thanks, goodbye.\" Will yanked on his jacket before bursting out of Hot Doggers and virtually leaping into his car. Fifteen minutes later he finally reached the hospital and almost forgot to check in before racing towards Kayla's room. He slammed the door open and his eyes immediately locked on Kayla. He crossed the room in two steps . Ignoring the nurses still in the room, he caught her lips with his and slid a hand behind her head. When they separated all the nurses had left the room with tiny smiles. \"Oh my gosh, are you okay?!\" Will cried, studying her face . \"I-I've been better.\" Kayla muttered. The obvious pain in her voice wrenched Will's heart. He stroked her hair back from her face gently. \"I can't board for three months.\" Kayla closed her eyes, trying to suppress tears. \"This is all my fault. I never should've taught you that stupid trick.\" Will dropped his head into his hands miserably. \"Will... Look at me.\" Kayla said softly. Will looked up, watching her from between his fingers. \"It is not your fault, Will. It was my choice. You hear me? Not your fault. Kayla said, looking straight at him. She reached over and tilted his chin up. \"Not. Your. Fault.\" She said slowly. When she leaned back against her pillows, Kayla winced and bit her lip to keep from crying out. Will winced in sympathy, wishing he could help somehow.

This is my first fanfiction, so constructive critisism is greatly appreciated Everything was perfect. They had won at Fire and Ice, Nick had apologised, and she had proven to everyone that she was more than what they saw on the surface. The Hot Doggers were walking back to the dog spa for some celebratory pizza, she and Will strolling along just behind Sam and Dink. Nothing could ruin this. Nothing except….. \"Kayla,\" Will said suddenly. \"Will.\" She said with mock seriousness. \"Why are you limping?\" Kayla's heart sank in her chest. All that work to make it look like she was fine, all that effort… \"What do you mean? I'm not limping.\" She said lightly, hoping to confuse him. \"Yes, you are. You're favouring your right leg. What's up?\" \"Nothing, I'm fine, honestly.\" Will gave her a sceptical look, as if to say Really, you're gonna try that ? They reached Hot Doggers, Sam reaching for the phone. \"What kind of pizza?\" Will gave Kayla a look and answered \"we're not getting any pizza until Kayla tells us what's wrong with her ankle.\" Dink nodded, while Sam grumbled, putting down his cell phone. Kayla sighed. \"Promise you won't get mad?\" Sam and Dink nodded, while Will smiled. \"You can trust us, Kayla.\" \"Okay,\" she sighed, pulling of her snow boots. There was silence as they took in the sight of Kayla's ankle, purple and swollen. Then Will started yelling. \"What the hell Kayla! How could you not tell me?! You could have…\" \"Stop, man,\" Sam yelled. \"Can't you see you're not helping?\" Will looked at Kayla then and his rage guttered, then went out. Kayla sat on the couch, holding back tears, waiting. Waiting, he realised, for Will finish. She had known he would react like this. She just sat there, taking it. Will sat down beside her, pulling her into a hug. Kayla stiffened in surprise, then sank into him, wrapping her arms around his neck and letting a few tears run down her cheeks. \"What happened?\" Will asked, softly this time. \"Last night, after Sebastian approached me, I knew straight away that I wouldn't take his offer. So I went back to the half pipe…\" \"Alone?! You went back alone, with no one to coach you, or help you if you were injured, or..\" \"Let her finish man.\" Sam was right. Kayla waited a minute, took a deep breath, and continued. \"I had to beat Team Swift. I had to show them that I was a good boarder, not just 'everybody's favourite Daddy's girl'. So I went for it. The Cloud 9. I got so close, but then it all went wrong. The edge of my board hit the pipe, and I fell, landing on my ankle. I thought it was just twisted, so I kept going. But it got worse. It got so bad that I couldn't concentrate. So I went home and rested it, hoping it would be better by morning….but it wasn't,\" she was whispering now. \"I had to prove myself, Will. I had to. So I boarded anyway. And I did it. So it was worth it.\" Stunned silence filled the room after Kayla's story. Sam left briefly, returning with ice and wrappings. \"Let me get this straight.\" Asked Dink. \"You won Fire an Ice, you beat Skye Sailor, you did a CLOUD 9, with a broken ankle.\" Kayla nodded. \"Will? Will pleased don't be mad.\" Kayla started to cry again. Will mutely wrapped her ankle, and picked her up. Finally, he spoke. \"I don't think I've ever been prouder of anyone in my life.\" And he kissed her. Will kissed her, holding her bridal style, in the middle of the room. Sam and Dink started cheering, and the dogs joined in, howling along. Finally, Kayla and Will broke apart, smiling broadly. Only to hear someone whisper behind them \"Kayla?\" They spun around, Will almost dropping Kayla in shock, to see Nick Swift and the rest of the Swift Team, excluding Skye, standing in the entrance to Hot Doggers. \"Kayla, what are you doing?\" Nick repeated, louder this time. It was Will who replied. \"What does it look like, Swift? She's kissing her boyfriend.\" Kayla looked at him then, eyes shining. \"Are you sure?\" And she looked so worried, as if he would laugh at her and tell her no, of course not, that he kissed her again. \"If you're sure, I'm sure,\" he replied. Nick broke into their blissful bubble. \"Well, we just wanted to congratulate you guys. I was wondering if I could maybe, talk to you, Kayla?\" Kayla looked so afraid then. She tried to hide it, but Will knew her too well for that. \"Whatever you want to say to her, you can say where we can hear it. You don't get to hurt Kayla again.\" Nick looked temporarily shocked, but accepted it. \"Kayla, I'm sorry about everything. I really am. I love you, and I wanted to know if we could give it another shot?\" Kayla took a deep breath. \"Nick…\" she paused, and Will was suddenly so afraid that she would leave him, that this beautiful girl who had turned his life upside down would leave him. \"Nick I'm sorry. I don't love you anymore.\" Will's heart rose. \"I love my boyfriend, and I want to be with him. I love you Will.\" Will thought he would burst with happiness as Nick nodded slowly, as if he was expecting this. \"Well, if you ever change your mind, you know where I'll be.\" With that, the Swift Team left. \"Well, we still have one unanswered question.\" Dink said, shocking everyone….they were pretty sure everything was covered. \"What pizza are we ordering? I'm hungry.\" The four friends laughed, and Will sat down, Kayla on his lap, and shared a small smile with her. Now it really was the perfect day.

So Basically Will has a memory resurface of when he failed his cloud 9 and Kayla is there to comfort him and tell him everything is ok. They are now boyfriend and girlfriend in this story. Also the reason Will is on her couch is they are having a sleepover. I don't own anything it belongs to the Disney channel. Thank you so... Here. I. Go. He was snowboarding. He shredded the half pipes and was winning. The crowd roared as he continue his stunts, they cheered and clapped with amazement and excitement for his moves. Will smiled to himself as he got prepared to do a cloud 9. Everything was going so well and everything was in place, all he needed to do was do three rotations and he would win fire and ice. One. Two. Crack. Will's body crashed to the ground and slid down the slope, gasps and shouts for help erupted as people rushed over to will's unmoving body. His mother ran over while cameras continued to film. He could see his mother through blurred vision, she was calling for help. Then it went black. Will shot up from where he had been lying, he was breathing heavily and his body shook as tears came into his eyes. \"It was just a dream, just a dream\" Will whispered to himself. \"Will?\" Kayla questioned walking over to the grey couch Will had been sleeping on. She turned on a light which sat on a table near the couch and took in the sight. Will had his legs brought up to his chest and his face was wet with tears. Kayla sat down where will was and placed a soothing hand on his back. \"Will, what's the matter ?\" Kayla asked, her tone was laced with concern. \"I.. I dreamed... my epic fail\" Will whimpered, burying his head further into his knees. Kayla gently traced a hand through his hair as she knew it calmed him down. After a few minutes of tracing her hand through his hair and comforting words the crying and whimpers subsided to slight hiccups. Will raised his tear stricken face to Kayla who proceeded to wipe some stray tears from his flushed face. \"Hey it was just a nightmare, an old memory. Don't worry I'm here\" Kayla whispered and placed a gentle kiss to his lips which stopped his hiccups. \"It's ok Will I'm here.\" \"Kayla.. Will you stay with me?\" Will asked with his head dropped down again. \"Of course Will\" Kayla answered. Kayla placed a finger under wills chin and brought his head up so they were kissing, after they ended the kiss Kayla took Will's hand and pulled him from the couch and led him up to her room and sat him down on the bed and she got into the other side. Smiling she pulled him in and to her chest to hug. \"Kayla, what would your mum and dad say if they caught us in the same bed?\" Will smirked \"Well my parents have gone away for the weekend so they won't be here to see it\" Kayla replied Pulling Will closer so she could place her chin on his head and the other hand on his back she sighed in contentment. \"Go to sleep Will, I'll wake you if you have another nightmare.\" With that Will closed his eyes and drifted off to sleep In the arms of Kayla.

My name is daphrose, and usually I hang around the Lab Rats fandom. In fact, this is my very first non-Lab-Rats story, so I'm super excited about it! It's only one chapter long and it's pretty short, but I'm excited anyway. This one-shot is rated T for injuries, depression, and some suicidal thoughts. If that kind of stuff is a trigger for you, then please don't read. This story has slight hints of Willayla. As much as the movie has, anyway. For all you suckers for romance out there. ;) Just as a warning, I know next to nothing (closer to nothing) about snowboarding, so I apologize if I got anything wrong! I hope you guys will enjoy this! I don't own Cloud 9; Disney does. I do own this story. Enjoy! * * * Fear * * * Will didn't rightly know how he had gotten caught up in this. Kayla Morgan, the girl whose father owned the resort, began work at his mother's dog kennel because she crashed his sled. That was how it started. Things got crazier after that. So Kayla learned that her whole career was a fraud. Frankly, Will was surprised she didn't know it before. I mean, how do you not know something like that? It doesn't take a genius to put the pieces together! The judges' comments were hardly stunning, and Kayla had had her shares of failures. Did she really still think that she was this \"epic snowboarder\"? Maybe Will was selling her short. Or at least, he had in the beginning. Because things changed. Things really changed. Kayla Morgan, that daddy's pampered princess, the spoiled brat of Summit Valley, the popular girl, queen bee, whatever you wanted to call her—Kayla Morgan got him back on the slopes. Him . Will Cloud. Back on the slopes . How the heck did that happen? Here he stood at the top of the halfpipe. Sam and Dink were there beside him, cheering him on. Kayla was there, smiling at him. He couldn't help but laugh inwardly. Kayla Morgan was a magical creature, surely. Nothing but the strongest magic could've gotten him to strap that board to his feet again. After all, Kayla had somehow talked him into teaching her. That in itself was a miracle. Will didn't know why he agreed to teach her. In the beginning, he thought she had no talent. No real talent, anyway. But she seemed sure. She seemed willing to try. That was more than a lot of people would do. So Will begrudgingly agreed to teach her. Lo and behold, they wound up here. Will stared down at the halfpipe. \"And hey,\" Kayla said softly, \"no fear.\" His own advice, tossed right back at him. In order to snowboard, you needed no fear. You needed confidence. Will stiffened when he realized he didn't have that. Kayla did. She snowboarded down Tyson's Peak to prove it. But Will didn't tackle the peak. He went to rescue her. That was all. Will slid his goggles over his face and patted his helmet one more time. His breathing quickened as he slid into the halfpipe. He coasted down it smoothly, much smoother than he thought he would. When he came up the other side, his holds were shaky and his arms were flailing. Boy, am I out of practice, he thought. As Will went along, he felt his fear slowly fade. This wasn't so bad! In fact, it was actually fun! It was the most fun he had had in a long time. Suddenly Will remembered why he enjoyed snowboarding so much. He could hear his friends cheering him on in the background and he grinned. Snowboarding was his passion. It always had been. As the wind rushed past his helmet, Will reminisced about his snowboarding experiences as a child. His chest tightened as he thought about his dad, the man who had taught him everything he knew. Will would be nothing without his father. \"Son,\" his dad used to say, \"you've got a real gift. Some people say that if you love what you do, you'll never have to work a day in your life. I wholeheartedly believe that. I also wholeheartedly believe that you were meant to be a snowboarder. You love it. You have the talent. Will, you'll do great things. I know you will. Promise me that you'll never stop doing what you love.\" \"I broke my promise,\" Will whispered softly as he clutched the edge of his board. A tear made its way to the corner of his eye, but he quickly blinked it away. Will remembered being at his father's bedside. He wasn't even nine yet. He remembered the moment the heart monitor stopped beeping; he remembered sobbing into his mother's chest as she sobbed into his hair. In that moment his world stopped. Everything he knew faded away. In that moment, snowboarding became the single most important thing in his life. So he did it. He would snowboard from dawn till dusk. It kept him connected to his father. When Will missed his dad, he would take a ride in the halfpipe. It made him feel closer. It made everything feel better. Until that day. Will's head began to spin. What was I thinking? This is crazy! I can't do this! No! I-I can't! The second time he was in a hospital room was when he was sixteen. Only instead of looking down at someone in a bed, he was the one in the bed. Will remembered much from those weeks of recovery. Too much. The pain was most of it. Oh, yes, the pain. That would be the obvious part. His ankle was wrapped in soft bandages, as was his knee. He had a tube down his throat. Every breath came out raspy and strained. That was horrifying. Breathing is easy, right? Not will a collapsed lung. Will drew in every gulp of air like it was his last. For a while, he was afraid it was. For a while, he hoped it was. It didn't end when he left that cramped hospital room. For months, Will would wake up with sweat pouring from his forehead and his whole body shaking. The nightmares gave him dozens of sleepless nights. He hated going to bed. He hated waking up. He hated breathing. There were times when he wished he had died in that fall. He lost his passion. Will had lost his will to live. He went on, though. Will continued going to school. He helped his mom with her new kennel. It was her dream, and he wanted to encourage it. His dream might have died, but that didn't mean his mom's had to as well. Before all that happened, though—before Will was too scared to try again—there was the ride. It was the ride when he finally tried out his new move. It was the ride that was meant to be a showstopper. It was the ride that became a literal showstopper when the ambulance pulled up. It was the ride that he thought would be his final one. It was the ride that ended with him saying, \"I'll see you soon, Dad.\" It was the ride that was just like this one. Just like this one. This one. I never should've done this, Will thought tragically. He felt his hands swinging frantically through the air. He knew what would happen next. Maybe he would be lucky this time; maybe he would actually die. I'm sorry, Kayla. Will's back slammed into the ground and he couldn't help but grunt. Pain flooded through his chest. Oh, no, it's happening again! Oh please, please no! The pain lessened, but Will was still struggling to breathe. Then he realized that this was nothing like before. This wasn't another collapsed lung. This was . . . this was . . . why, he had just gotten the wind knocked out of him. That was all! He wasn't killed. He wasn't severely injured. In a few minutes—heck, a few seconds!—he would perfectly fine. A different feeling swelled through Will. This time, though, it was pure elation. It wasn't fear. The fear was gone. Okay, the fear was still there, but it was smaller. It was weaker than before. It wasn't controlling anymore. Will had at least partially conquered it. He had expected this ride to be devastating. He had expected it to end as tragically as the one the year before. But no. It wasn't the best ride ever, that was for certain. But he survived. He was in one piece. Dad, I'm not ready. I wasn't ready then, and I'm not ready now. I'm sorry for breaking my promise, but I'm going to fix that now. It'll be a long time before I see you again. Dad, I almost made the choice to come to you a lot sooner. I'm sorry. That would've been a horrible mistake. There are people here who need me. And I need them. Will suddenly realized what had ended his career a year earlier. It wasn't the failed stunt. It wasn't the injuries. Sure, those hindered it, but they didn't end it. Will ended his career. He ended it when he decided that his dreams weren't worth the risk. He ended it when he became a slave to his fear. He ended it when he gave up. Winners never quit and quitters never win: one of his dad's favorite sayings. Why had he ignored that? Snowboarding was Will's passion. There was no doubt about that. When he was on the slopes, he felt free. Will was bird, free to soar and go wherever he pleased. He was closer to his father. He could do anything when he tried. Wasn't that what Kayla had been saying all along? Lying there in the cold, wet snow, Will made a decision: he was back. And when he said he was back, he meant he was back for good. He had missed it so much. The past year had been the worst of his life, and he only made it harder on himself. Will wasn't going to make the same mistake twice. He wanted to snowboard. He knew what his mom meant now when she said she missed his smile. Will missed his smile too. He had finally found it again. \"Somebody go get some help!\" Will became aware of someone grasping his arm. He realized that he had been too caught up in his thoughts to pay attention to what was going on around him. Kayla was kneeling beside him, yelling at Sam and Dink. Will grinned. \"Ah!\" he shouted, sitting up suddenly. Kayla gasped and groaned. Will removed his goggles and began to laugh. The joy swelling through him was something he hadn't felt in a long time. It was something he hadn't felt since a year earlier; since he had been snowboarding. \"I got ya!\" he said giddily. \"Were you playing roadkill on us?\" Kayla asked indignantly. Guess Donald taught me a thing or two. \"Yeah,\" Will told her, \"but I'm okay.\" Will loved the sound of those words. He hadn't said them in a long time. At least, he hadn't said them and meant it. How many times had his told his mom or his friends that he was just fine? Every time it was lie. Not now. Not this time. He said it again, just to hear those sweet words once more, and to assure himself that they were true. \"I'm a little sore, but . . . I'm okay.\" Will truly was okay. For the first time in a year, he was okay. Ta-da! How did you guys like that? I found Will's character to be very interesting, and I thought there was a lot to be explored with him. Maybe someday when I'm less busy I could write a multi-chapter story about his past. What do you think? I only edited this once or twice, so I apologize for any grammar mistakes that slipped through. And again, I know nothing about snowboarding, so I apologize for any mistakes with that too. Be sure to review/favorite if you liked the story! I love hearing your feedback. Again, this is my first story outside of the Lab Rats fandom, so I'm curious to see how it goes! I hope you liked it! Well, it's still Christmas where I live, so Merry Christmas everybody! :D Bye! ~ Rosie ","Summary":" Hi Cloud 9 fans! My name is daphrose, and usually I hang around the Lab Rats fandom.

So thank her for allowing me to use it. I hope I did it justice. I don't own anybody. Hope you guys enjoy it. I know it will be mushy, cliché and slightly cheesy but that is how I write stories. I kind of enjoy making certain characters real jerks, snobs and big whinny babies when it helps my pairing realize their love sooner. I know that in the actual movie, Nick Swift isn't a total jerk but in this story, he is so don't be alarmed. Also please don't hate on me for making Nick and Skye so mean or whiny, this is how my imagination played out the story so I had to write them that way. It was Monday morning at Summit Valley High School and already the gossip mill was working full speed. It didn't matter that most of the information was made up by a third party in order to have anyone who is willing to listen to have a positive and negative impact the people involver's reputation,depending on the oh so important social standing on the social ladder of the school. Everyone was discussing it even before entering the doors of the school so the noise level rose in the halls that the morning bell could barely be heard. \"Will says that I am so close to getting the hang of the Cloud 9, all I need to do is stay focus and practice, practice and more practice. I can't wait to get the move down pact and show all those people who think all that I am good for is looking pretty that I am also one determined and stubborn girl. I think that my attempt to ski down Tyson Peak, one that not anyone has tried might I add, proved how determined I am to show everyone what I can do.\" Kayla was saying as she walked down the hallways with her two best friends Lindsay and Pia. \"Gee Kay, all we have heard from you is either about snowboarding or Will for a couple of weeks. Me thinks that someone is getting a major crush on her snowboarder instructor, I told you that Will Cloud wasn't un-cute but glad that you realized that for yourself. We have been watching you two during practice and when you guys are hanging out and can I say \"OMG!. I thought Chris and me were the cutest couple in school but Will and you take the cutest couple award hands down.\" Lindsay said as she put her books in her locker, Pia nodded and did the same. \"I didn't think I was that bad. My excuse is that I can't help but flirt up a storm with Will, he makes it so easy to be myself around him. He is him, 100% no pretence \"take me or leave me\" attitude, around me and expects the same from me. To be fair in the beginning Will drove me crazy, not in a good way, with his own stubbornness and determination not to take a second chance at something he obviously loves to do because of the accident. Over time those qualities as well as his sweetness, easy going attitude and that adorable smile guaranteed to melt any girl's heart changed my view on him. I went from trying to show him that I was strong and determined enough for him to train to maybe possibly oh who am I kidding impressing him cause my feelings for him had changed.\" Kayla said as her face started to turn red as she admitted out loud to slowly falling in love with Will as her heart started to flutter in her chest at the thought of him. Her lovesick thoughts were interrupted by someone rudely bumping into her; when she turned around she saw her ex boyfriend with his arm around her rapidly becoming enemy Skye Sailor smiling smugly at her. \"Hey look it is my pathetic, whinny, prissy ex girlfriend. What is the matter sweetie? Mad that I not only found a true contender in \"Fire & Ice\" to let the world know how totally awesome and talented Team Swift is but also a true woman for me cause I am a God compared to others my age. I still can't believe that I gave you any of my precious time or attention this past few months, you aren't worth it. You are too clingy, needy, always wanting to talk and talk about whatever is in your pea brain and your only skill is being a pretty arm candy. I dumped you before you could hurt my spotless reputation with breaking the resort's personal property. I am too handsome and rich to get into trouble with the law. But Skye is more my type of woman; knows when to keep her mouth shut and when to speak, how to be arm candy and how to make a man feel like a man. Because of this she is worth my time, energy and reputation and together we will not only be the hottest couple at school but rule the \"Fire & Ice\" competition.\" \" Sorry Daddy's Girl. But it is just how things are; the real woman won the guy, the life you wish you had and soon the recognition and the award of the competition. You lost so deal with it, cry on the shoulders of your little friends and try to stay away from my Nicky and me. Kay? Bye bye loser\" Skye said with all the haughty and nastiness of being a total diva while hanging onto Nick's arm before she and Nick walked away. Kayla turned back around, mouth opened and eyes wide just like her friends \"Ok so that was unexpected, totally rude and I have done nothing to him to warrant him or that diva to say those things to me. I am so glad I don't have feelings anymore for Nick Swift other then hope that Will beats that jerk's butt in the competition so I can kick Skye's . Thank goodness I found the last honest, sweet, family and friend oriented, easy to talk to, shows his true self with no thoughts of manipulating anyone for his own well- being all around kind of guy in Will. Now to tell him all this without throwing up.\" Kayla commented as she saw Will coming towards them. \"Hey Kayla. How are you? I would have called you last night but since my mom has been working overtime at the restaurant lately I spent most of the night catching up with her. The next thing I knew it was 10 and I didn't want to wake you up if you had gone to bed cause I wanted to talk.\" As Will was talking, he shifted his books around like she would tease him about actually wanting to spend time with his mother or that he was eager to talk to her when they had been together all day. But Kayla had no intention of making fun of Will, not when her heart was melting a little at what a sweet, caring and considerate son he is to his mom and how adorable the fact is that he wanted to talk to her. She just hoped that her soft smile along with her eyes that probably had love spilling out of them told him what she really thought of his confession. \"Hey Will, I have a question\" Will nodded, confused about the question she might ask but willing to answer as truthfully as he could. \"Could you hold my hand? I was told that my hands are too small. What do you think?\" Will didn't even hesitate to take her hand, both feeling instant sparks running through their bodies along with a spreading warm and comfortable heat but they were so used to it happening. It happened pretty much anytime they touched, intentionally or not. \"Definitely not small. More then perfect. Kind of like you at least according to me.\" Will responded saying the last sentences softly hoping that Kayla didn't hear it. She didn't hear all of what he said but the words she did hear made her go \"aww\" in her head. They just stared deeply into each other's eyes, seeing the love they felt for the other person reflected in the other's eyes until their moment was interrupted by a loud \"No!\" coming from behind them. Nick planted himself in front of Kayla with his hands on his hips and literally glared at the couple: \"Oh heck no. There is no way on this green Earth that a whiny, little girl like you will ever get any guy even an epic fail, no-body and complete and utter loser like Will Cloud. I mean you had the best of the best and you lost him so now you need to accept the fact you will be alone for the rest of your life. No guy will want the High and Mighty Nick Swift's seconds unless it is to use you for their own purpose by showering you with simple acts of affection to make you their easily manipulative slave only to dump you when your purpose is fulfilled. You are suppose to be all miserable, lonely, down-trodden and crying non-stop over our break-up, not badly flirting and have all these sappy moments with another guy. Though I think it is adorable that you and Cloud have been bothering to practice snowboarding cause there is no way that you two, in any amount of time, will ever beat me if the competition. But if you choose to embarrass yourselves in front of ten thousand people, then I guess I could stand to laugh my butt off at your stupidity and clumsiness from the winner's stand with my huge trophy, Hmm that actually sounds quite promising and quite entertaining to me so go ahead practice, it won't make a difference in the end. Back to my original thought is only I should be happy and be dating someone, not you so stop it right now. Or I will be forced to use my cleverness to instruct both of you how life works; the good-looking, powerful, smartest people who aren't afraid to use what they have or who they know to get what they want. Money does more then morals and values ever could. You don't want to mess with me.\" Nick said in a voice that boosted of high self esteem that should make people listen to him and bow to his wishes since it has been happening since he was small, thanks to his dad`s business and money. Nick wandered off leaving Kayla with a sense of incredulity at how her ex`s personality changed what seemed like overnight and not in a good way. Nick Swift was the biggest jerk, snob, manipulator, self absorbed young man she had ever encountered, more then she ever thought possible in a person. And we have his dear father to thank for raising him like the biggest spoiled brat who thinks money and manipulating people is a way of life. `` Don't you dare even consider believing what that big headed blowhard said. It is so not how the real world works, no matter what his daddy has to say. You are too sweet, sensitive and beautiful inside and out of a person not to have guys line up to win your heart. You deserve all the happiness in the world and hopefully a really special guy in your life to make all your dreams come true. He will make it his mission that you feel loved, cared for and treasured.`` Will said with lots of emotion, with every word he was literally begging Kayla not to change anything about herself to please that big baby. Heart in her eyes, Kayla glomped onto Will for a huge hug while saying in a voice that dripped with love: \"Don't worry, I stopped listening or caring what Nicholas Swift thinks or says when he dumped me when he couldn't use my father's name or money to better his own status anymore. What I was thinking when he was talking was how could such a huge head and ego fit on such a small body and not make him fall over? You are such a sweetheart, no matter how much you might deny it. There isn't a lot of guys in this world like you but in a good way; a complete and utter sweetheart who deserves all the joys, happiness and best in this life. I am surprised that the girls in our school are too blind not to see what a special of a guy you are and want to spend as much time as possible to get to know you but their loss is my gain. So I am glad they are blind.\" Will and Kayla just stood in the hallway hugging like there's no tomorrow, both soaking up the love and warmth that was passing through them during this simple action, not caring if they weren't alone in the school hallway where anyone could see them. \"I love you\" just seemed to slip out of Will's mouth without him even knowing it was happening until the words were out there. Good thing it was spoken in whispers so Will was hoping that Kayla was too involved in the moment to notice what he said. Nope she noticed; those three words had stopped her heart for a minute as she focused on those words she had been dreaming about hearing from Will and stop herself from either rubbing her eyes or pinching her arm to make sure she wasn't dreaming. Then her heart re-starting to go a faster beat with a couple of skips in between as she realized that she wasn't dreaming and that Will really did love her back like she loved him. \"I love you too.\" Kayla said as she slowly pulled away to look him in the eyes to make sure that Will knew that she meant every word and was speaking from the heart. His response was to plant a soft, tender and love-filled kiss on her eager for his lips to which she instantly responded with all the love she could pour into that one act of affection. They just stood there kissing, not wanting to stop for something as silly as classes or even breathing, until it was necessary to breath so with a gasp of air, they pulled apart, still in each other's arms. Will could feel someone, he guessed it was the \"big baby\" aka Nick Swift and his girltoy, glaring holes into his back but he was way too blissfully deep in a world of love with his girl to care what those losers thought. He and Kayla had smiles on their faces that went from ear to ear that didn't seem to be going anywhere soon, they were that ecstatic at this moment of time. With one more kiss, Will slung one of his arms around Kayla and the other was holding her books which worked out for both of them as Kayla could now wrap both arms around his waist as she was lead to her first class. Kayla didn't know what got into her, she wasn't usually unkind or likes to rub anything into anyone's face but she turned around and did a little \"Na Na I didn't listen to your whinny rant. What are you gonna do about it, you big baby?\" wave at Nick, who was sitting on the group of chairs with Skye and to supposedly watch the entire event.

He's willing to do almost anything, but can he give Marco what he wants. It had been almost two months since the \"King\" incident. Knowing it was too ridiculous no one involved ever actually told anyone, especially their parents. Due to this fact the parents of Marco and Will unknowingly left two ex-enemies alone for two weeks while they had a vacation. \"We left the money in the sugar jar, call if anything happens, don't throw a party and please…don't fight.\" their mom said as she rushed out the door. The two boys waited about thirty seconds before their mom re-entered the house. \"I-I forgot my cell phone.\" she said in a embarrassed tone. Marco handed her the phone off the table and off she was this time she forgot nothing else. Now alone just as he had done since the incident Will began to thank Marco and apologize twice as much. \"Marco I know we've had A LOT of complicated issues, but I really didn't know- well how could I. my point is owe big time…I'll do anything you want. If its embarrassing I won't tell a soul and mom and dad are gone so it's just you and me.\" Marco only rolled his eyes. \"For the millionth time Will it's cool. I was only doing what dad wouldn't. Don't sweat it man.\" He knew Will would dog him the whole two weeks. He considered earplugs. Bud decided to shower instead. He could still hear Will trying to apologize to him in the hall way. When he got out and wrapped himself with the towel Will was there, big eyed and all this drove Marco over edge. He needed to be alone right the fuck now. \"Dude it's cool just go watch TV to thank me or something\" he said trying to get to his room. \"NO WAY! You did too much for me so I'll do whatever you want me to do to thank you\" he said firmly. With that said Marco pushed Will up against the wall and kissed him hard. Will was so shocked, but when he opened his mouth to protest Marco slid in his tongue. And both Will and Marco began to groan and moan into the kiss. Realizing what he was doing Will pushed away from his brother. Will was confused, hurt, angry, shocked and horny all at once. He stared at his brother and saw sadness in his eyes, but showed no signs of regret. This was enough to throw Will past his limit. \"I HATE YOU!\" he screamed before running to his room. Marco stood there in twice as much shocked as his brother. For years he had kept his feelings for Will secret. Only secretly staring at pictures, because it'd be hard to explain if he was caught daydreaming. All his work had been thrown away by one beautiful, sinful and lustful kiss. End of chapter 1 Please Review :)[Chapter 2] Will was so confused by Marco's action, he just didn't get it. Why now? Why him? Why did he do it in the first place? Will wasn't mad at Marco at all, if anything he was beyond happy about the kiss. He would have raped Marco right then and there, if he wasn't confused. He always had a little boy crush on Marco, but hated how Marco had treated him before. Even after he found out about the King Arthur repeat, he still thought Marco hated him. That was why he wanted to make it up to Marco. Marco spent so much time trying to save him, when he should have been protecting Allie. When Will found out he wasn't King Arthur, it crushed him. Not that he wanted the power, but he wanted Marco's hard work to protect him would pay off. He felt like he was a worthless loss-cause to Marco. After that he just gave up on Marco loving or even liking him. He decided to be with Marco one way or another, even if it meant just his step-brother. Will hated that word with all his soul. The word just so disgraceful and rude to him. He had been so caught up in his thoughts he realized that he did not realize what he was doing. He was laid back on his bed in his room. He always complained that his room was the smallest one in the house, he thought it was unfair. Especially since he was the oldest of the brothers. Even though everyone told him the rooms were the same size, he'd only say that the closet was bigger in Marco's room. Will felt a tightness in his pants. Oh how he prayed it wasn't what he thought it was. He closed his eyes tight as he hesitantly moved his hand \"down south\" and he was right. Despite his confusion he was still horny from his kiss. He closed his eyes and touched his 'blessed' lips before taking a deep breath. He thought about how soft Marco's lips were, he pictured those lips surrounding his nine inch manhood. \"Mmm~ Ah…\" he moaned as he wrapped his long slim fingers around his fully erect cock. He was loving this, but he was dying for the 'real thing' The thought of his brother on his hands and knees, and slightly gagging as he takes Will fully in his mouth. \"Aaaahn~\" The feeling of his cock hitting the back of Marco's throat. \"ooh~\" Marco jerking himself off while he continued to suck Will off, like life depended on it. \"Ah…fuck!\" Will said (more like screamed) like he always did whenever he jerked off. He looked at his now cum covered shirt. He groaned at the thought of taking a shower, and risking Marco seeing him like this. He decided hiding and avoiding Marco is a cowards way out. Will was a lot of things, a gay, a jock, a sick bastard in love with his step-brother. Not a weak ass coward who wont dance when the music plays. He changed his shirt and took a deep breath as he looked at his door-knob for what felt like an hour, but was actually only thirty seconds or less. He finally grabbed the taunting door-knob, with a strong enough grip to turn his knuckles pure white. He chewed on his tongue, a habit he had picked up as a kid. He only when he was scared. He swung the door open, with determination burning in his eyes. He marched down the hall using all his will-power to fight the urge to run his ass back into the safety of his own room. Finally he was in front of Marco's room, he saw familiar signs on his brother's bedroom door. One of said 'KEEP OUT OR ELSE' the other was hand made by Marco personally in woodshop last year. That sign said 'BEWARE BEAST'. These signs hadn't been displayed since the 'King Arthur\" fiasco. Will took as a Marco sign of hatred for him, he was so heart broken. He could swear he heard his heart break. It sounded like a huge glass vase being thrown at a glass window. Wait-doesn't Marco have a foreign vase collection in his closet. (Don't ask) Will tried to open the door but not much to his to surprise, it was locked. He heard another smashing sound, this one was pained scream from Marco. \"AARGH!\". This only reason he needed to kick down Marco's innocent door and run into the room what he saw did more than shock him. It paralyzed him where he stood. The sight was horrific. Marco's window was broken and very colorful glass was all over the floor, along with some of the glass from the window. Two of Marco's pampered vases were gone. Marco was stark naked sprawled out across the glass coated white carpet. The white carpet was beginning to stain beneath Marco's seemingly lifeless body. He was covered in cuts and scratches. It looked like he had rolled around in the glass. Will finally was able to move toward his brother. He was biting his tongue to the bleeding point. He was absolutely terrified at the thoughts that roamed in his head. This is my fault. His hatred for me was it really this strong? He'd rather die than live knowing that he kissed something like me? Will leaned down to look at Marco's body, the glass cutting him through his jeans. He knew he was bleeding but his body was still numb to everything but Marco. He touched Marco with shaking hands. He had to check right now. He checked Marcos pulse on his neck, which seemed to be the only part of him that was uncut. When he touched the younger boy's neck, he prayed it wasn't imagining thing right now. THERE WAS PULSE! It was very weak but a pulse none the less, there was hope for Marco. That's all Will needed, a chance. He grabbed Marco's blanket of his bed and wrapped Marco up so his no-no part was covered. He picked up his barely living brother and rushed him to his car. Will got it as birthday present last year. He put Marco in the backseat, and rushed to the closest hospital. Once he was at the hospital he rushed in and ran to the first nurse he saw. \"Nurse! Please you have to help him, he's covered in glass! PLEASE!\". The nurse only looked at Marco's face once before her face showed pure horror and worry. She shot Will a sympathetic look before turning to approaching doctor behind Will. \"Doctor, please, this treatment at once!\" she shouted at the doctor. The doctor called for a stretcher for Marco. Once the stretcher was there Will laid Marco's body down gently. He prayed Marco would make it. The nurse tapped Will on the back to get his attention. Will turned around to see the nurse holding HUGE stack of forms for Will to sign. He chuckled as he forgot what a pain in the ass the hospital was. \"Here's a pen and a dollar in quarters so you can call your parents.\" The hospital sucks eggs but at least the lady was nice enough to patients.[Chapter 3] A/N: So it has been literally YEARS since I updated this story, but I was going through my old reviews. I was just going to ask that everyone leave a review if you want me to continue this fic.[Chapter 4] After a long phone call with his mom and a lot of left out information, Will got his parents to agree to stay on their trip and let him take care of Marco. He had filled out all the paper work was now sipping gross coffee in the waiting room, waiting for the doctors to tell him he can see Marco. After a while he saw the nurse from earlier. 'Can I see him?' Will asked. 'Yes, he's in room 346. The doctors managed to remove all the glass, but he is covered in cuts. You'll need to basically bathe him in disinfectant cream. You can take him home after we finish changing his bandages. Before you leave I'll need you to stop by the desk and I will give you a list of good disinfectants to buy for when you run out of what we send home with you.' The nurse, Elda, said. 'Oh thank God, he's ok.' Will sighed a breath of relief. 'Yes, he's fine, but what I don't understand is why he would bust up two vases and roll in the glass.' Elda said. 'I didn't.' Will and Elda turned around and saw Marco limping their way. He was wearing a hospital gown and some pants the hospital supplied. 'You didn't?' Elda asked. 'No, I was pissed and emotional so I threw the vase that Will got me last Christmas. I picked up another one and threw it out the window. When I realized it I tried to walk over to the window and stepped on the glass and fell down. Then I made it worse by trying to roll over, getting the glass everywhere.' Marco said as he limped closer. 'Really? All of it was an accident?' Will asked. 'Yes, what did you think?' Marco said back. 'I thought this was a crazy suicide attempt.' Will answered. 'I may be emotionally stable, but I'm not suicidal. Now can I get the hell out of here? I hate hospitals.' Marco said, making sure not to look at Will at all. 'Sure, I just gotta give you your disinfectant cream, and I need your signature on a dotted line.' Elda said before walking over to the counter and hands Marco a clipboard and a board. 'What's this?' Marco asked as he took the items. 'It's a release form; you can't leave without signing it.' She said. Marco quickly signed the paper and politely handed the clipboard and pen back to the nurse. 'Thank you, here is your cream.' Elda said before walking around the counter and reaching beneath the counter and pulling out a large tube of cream. 'Apply this to ALL your cuts every morning until they heal.' She said to Marco while handing the cream to him. 'And this is the list of other creams to use when that runs out.' Elda said, handing a piece of paper to Will. 'Thank you Elda.' Will said as he took the list. 'You're welcome; now you two can go home.' She said before walking over to help some of the other people. In silence Marco and Will head back home, when they do make it to the house they see the aftermath of Marco's accident. The window for Marco's room was shattered and the colorful broken glass of the vase stuck out in the green grass. 'Damn, that was one of a kind Korean made vase. I'll never find another one, even if I did that was a forty thousand dollar piece.' Marco grumbled. Will had nearly fainted. 'F- Forty thou-thousand? Did you just say you paid forty thousand dollars for that vase?' Will asked in amazement. 'I know right, it was such a deal.' Marco said before heading to the house. 'You know the door wasn't locked.' Marco said over his shoulder as he opened the door. Will briefly remembers forgetting to lock the house up in the panic of trying to get Marco to the hospital. So in addition to a broken window the front door was unlocked. A burglar would think it was Christmas. Will walked into the house and was happy to see that nothing obvious seemed to be missing, but just to be sure he would look around later. It was getting dark outside; they had been at the hospital since yesterday afternoon. Ugh! I didn't know how tired I was until I got home. Will though as he yawned and stretched. 'What, you're tired? I'm the one whose head is swimming in pain killers.' Marco scoffed as he sat down with a wince. 'Right sorry, do you wanna go to your room and lay down?' Will asked. 'My room is covered in glass.' Marco reminded. 'Oh yeah, right. Well you can sleep in my room for now; I'll clean up the glass and see how much it'll cost to fix the window.' Will suggested, looking to his step brother for confirmation. 'As long as can sleep I'm fine with whatever.' Marco said before he stood up with a grunt. 'You know if it hurts to move around you can ask me for help.' Will said. 'Wow, how polite, you know, for a guy who hates me.' Marco said as he limped past Will and made his way down the hall. Will was confused for a second, and then he remembered. ' I HATE YOU!' Will remembered screaming that at Marco after the kiss, but he can't remember why he said it at all. He loved the kiss, hell he loved it so much he jerked off right after. ' I HATE YOU!' It echoed in Will's head, just as it had echoed in Marco's as he threw his vases in a fit of rage. 'Why did I say that?' Will thought out loud as he grabbed the broom and dust pan. 'I didn't mean it. I didn't mean it at all.' He said as he walked into Marco's room. The floor was covered in glass and there were little red stains on the carpet, reminding Will of when he found Marco. While cleaning the room Will replayed everything that happened that lead to this. He thought about how bad he felt for letting Marco down when Allie turned out to be the King Arthur reincarnation; when Marco kissed him; when he got so confused and frustrated he screamed a complete lie. It had taken Will twenty minutes to deem the floor glass free and another twenty minutes to get rid of the blood stains. By the time he was done he had thought it over and over again and he had figured it all out. He loved Marco. He hated disappointing Marco, he hated it when Marco didn't like him and when he did mean things, he didn't want to hurt Marco and he loved touching Marco and kissing him (not to mention dreaming of doing other things with him). No matter how hard it was, before these two weeks past, he was going to be with Marco.

It is sophomore year after this discovery was made, and all the reincarnations of the nights of the round table had been discovered. They had even run into the reincarnations of two of Merlin's apprentices, but the third, Veronica, had yet to show up. We start this story at the beginning of a new year with a new school for Kendra. I woke up to the sound of my alarm clock sitting next to my bed. I hit the snooze button, about fifteen minutes later I turned it off as I rolled out of bed. I hoped this school wouldn't be like my last one, where they completely ignore you if your not exactly like every one else. After taking a shower and getting dressed, I looked at the reflection of my pale face in the mirror. I let my wavy light brown hair fall to my shoulders and frame my diamond shaped face with a sprinkle of freckles around my nose. I decided that, as usual, I was to lazy to wear make up, and put on my favorite shirt and a new pair of jeans. I grabbed a bowl of cereal for breakfast before putting on my green converse and heading to school. My first class was Algebra II with some person named Will. He is the quarter back for the school's football team, and would not stop talking about his girlfriend named Allie. She seemed a little to good to be true the way he described her, which could only mean he was in love. He was nice though, I just was a little annoyed by the constant talking about a girl I did not know. At lunch, I sat alone outside. I was already feeling the separation of being different. A difference they would never know, yet somehow felt. As I sat alone, I held out my hand and connected myself with the water in the air. I pulled the water into a bubble and soon I was controlling the movement of the water bubble. I practiced moving it into designs. \"Can I sit here?\" The water dropped onto the ground. I hoped the person who asked that question had not noticed the water, but he did not say anything about it at least. I turned around to discover that it was Will asking to sit with me. \"Where's your girlfriend you told me so much about?\" \"She has first lunch.\" He said as he sat down. So I ate lunch with the quarterback that day. Not exactly normal for a girl like me, but it was differently better. Maybe this school would be alright. The last class of the day was theater. There was a boy in the class who, to me, looked a little nerdy and wise. Those were the types of people I usually got along with so I went over to talk to him. \"No, back away.\" He said to me. I felt a little hurt \"Why?\" I asked. \"Because if you don't talk to me you will ruin your chances of being popular.\" I honestly didn't care whether or not I was popular; I just wanted some real friends. I held my head high \"I'll talk to who ever I want to talk to.\" The boy smiled as if he had gone through this before and held out his hand \"I'm Miles.\" He told me \"I'm Kendra.\" I replied smiling. Just as I said my name Miles doubled over holding his head in pain as if he was having a migraine times ten. \"Miles! Are you alright?\" I asked even though in my mind I already knew something was wrong. Soon he seemed fine again, but when he looked up he looked into my eyes with a look of worry and concern.[Chapter 2] It had been a week since I had met Will and Miles. Every time I saw Miles he looked at me as if I was dieing, he even told me that magic would destroy me. This scared me, how could he know that about me and how could the very thing that is me destroy me? Lately I had been scared to do magic because of what Miles said to me. It hurt that he wouldn't talk to me, not many people did. They were all to wrapped up in their dramatic lives, but Will did talk to me and he was a good friend. He finally stopped talking about Allie all the time, although she still was a big chunk of what he talked about. It turned out that Allie was in my History class. She was nice to talk to and, as a bonus, she actually talked about stuff other than Will, but he did pop up in a couple conversations. \"Hey did you hear about the school play? Will and I are trying out to do something new together and I was wondering if you were going to try out?\" she asked me \"Yeah, I'm trying out, but I don't think I have much of a chance, being the new girl and all.\" I smiled at her as we headed down to the theater room. I was after school tryouts. The tryouts at this school were a cold reading from the book. Allie and Will did alright and got big roles. I got the part of the twin sister of the main characters best friend. I wondered who had the part of the brother. The play was a not well-known play about two best friends who end up falling for the same girl who ends up loving someone else. The sister tries to tell them that the girl loves another person, but they won't listen until the end where they find her kissing the person that she loves and finally make up after all the fighting. For the sister it's almost a \"told you so\" moment. At the rehearsal, I found out who would be playing my brother, it was Miles. I took this as a chance to talk to him, but I was nervous for some reason. I ended up rambling about something I read the other day. \"Hey did you know that Merlin had three apprentices? He also had an archenemy, Morganna was her name. She killed him, and then went after his apprentices.\" Miles starred at me with wide eyes. I blushed and walked away. I obviously freaked him out, but he followed me to the parking lot. I turned around to tell him to quit stalking me and ended up face to face with him. He looked straight into my green eyes with the same worried look he always gave me and I couldn't help but stare back into his deep brown eyes. I looked down after a few seconds. \"Have you heard of the order of the bear?\" He asked me I nodded \"Its about the reincarnation of King Arthur, do you think its real or something.\" \"It is real, Allie is Arthur, I'm Merlin, and Will is a night of the round table.\" Part of me didn't want to believe Miles, but I knew it was real, but it did surprise me that he was Merlin even though it shouldn't have. \"I think you might be Veronica, can you do any magic at all?\" I nodded, now it made sense why Miles was acting the way he was. If he was Merlin then he would be able to see the future, and if he saw something bad that would explain why he looked at me the way he did. \"I'm I trouble, aren't I?\" I asked him. \"If being in trouble means Morganna trying to kill you, then yes, you are in trouble.\" He looked sad. Then as if trying to avoid the subject he asked me what I had learned to do with my magic. I showed him what I could do with controlling the water then I tried something new with lightning and almost electicuted him. \"I'm so sorry.\" I said after making sure he was ok. He just laughed and took out a pen. I wanted to ask him what the pen was about but it turned into a staff and I understood a bit better why he had it. \"I'm going to teach you how to defend yourself using magic.\" \"But I thought you told me to stay away from magic.\" \"I meant other people using magic, except me of course.\" He said with a nerdy smile.[Chapter 3] The next week had been great. Miles had been teaching me magic during lunch and I had become fairly decent at it. However, I did fry him with electricity a few times. He didn't seem to mind though, he would just look at me with that same sad look he always did. It was starting to bug me. Every time I was happy and I would look at him, it would ruin the moment. Miles decided to bring me out to pizza for dinner one night. \"But, I don't want you spending money on me.\" I complained. \"No buts, I am buying you some pizza.\" \"Why?\" \"Because that's what friends do.\" \"Oh so you admit I am your friend.\" Miles frowned as I caught him. He had been insisting that he was only my mentor, and that we were not friends. I smiled to myself because I caught one of his mistakes, which apparently don't come around all that often. He frowned at me. Angry with this fact. I continued to smile which only made him frown to himself more. \"Come on Miles, don't be like that.\" \"Be like what?\" \"You're always upset about something, its getting on my nerves.\" \"Well I'm sorry, Kendra, that I cant control my life!\" He started storming off. \"But.\" I reached out my hand but he was already to far away. He turned around, still angry. \"Well get the pizza tomorrow!\" Then he was gone. I stood alone, the wind blowing my hair into my face. \"I'm sorry.\" I whispered to the wind. I went home, and laid on my bed. I feel asleep sometime in the next hour with my homework spread out all over my bed. When the alarm clock went off the next morning, I shot out of bed and landed with my face on the floor. \"Oww\" I whined to myself as I pealed my lazy body of the floor. I went to take a shower, dried my hair, and then paused standing in front of the makeup dour. I decided to skip it today, as I usually do. I grabbed my backpack, stuffed it with my books, and then headed out the door on my way to yet another day of school. After the play rehearsal, Miles and I went to the pizza parlor like we planned to do yesterday. We made it there with no fights. \"One small pepperoni pizza please.\" MMiles said handing a ten-dollar bill to the cashier. The cashier took the money, gave him change and a receipt with our number on it. There was an awkward silence while we were waiting for our number to be called. \"NUMBER 7\" The speaker boomed. \"That's us.\" Miles said as he got up. He brought back a small pizza, which we shared. I bit into the pizza. \"Oh my god this is amazing!\" I said, the pizza hanging out of my mouth. Miles smiled, \"I told you so.\" I started scarfing down the pizza a little fast. Miles looked up at me, his eyes widening. \"Id slow down before you choke.\" He said. Soon we were done with our pizza. \"You got a little something on your chin.\" He said as he wiped my face. He was done before I could complain, and before I could thank him, he bent over the table, holding his head in pain. \"Miles?\" I asked, worried about him. I didn't like that when he had a vision it hurt him. He looked up at the Kitchen. As soon as he did, the oven burst into flames.[Chapter 4] The room quickly filled with smoke from the flames in the kitchen. Every breath I took resulted in choking. The few people in the restaurant were screaming and bolting for the door. A large guy ran into me through the thick black smoke. I was knocked to the ground and the guy didn't bother to help me up, he just continued to run out the front door. I couldn't stand back on my feet, but I managed to pull myself to my hands and knees. The room was spinning and I couldn't think. \"Kendra? KENDRA!\" Miles's voice sounded distant. Luckily I had enough sense to answer him. \"I- I'm .. down.. Here.\" I said between coughing fits. I felt hands rap around my waist, pulling me up onto my feet. It was Miles. One hand remained around my waist, the other guiding my arm to rest on his shoulder for support as he led us to the exit. I was still in a daze and I was only half-aware of what was going on. The room was completely full of smoke. All I could see was the flickering flame that had grown into the seating area, engulfing the table we had been at just a few seconds ago. The sound of the crackling as the flames ate the wood filled my mind. Something was wrong, more than just a fire, but I couldn't place my mind on it. Miles had dragged me to the door and was just opening it as I became aware of what was bothering me. Behind the sound of the crackling fire there was a faint screaming coming from the kitchen. I slipped away from Miles's grip, much to his protest, but I couldn't make out what he was saying. I stumbled to the kitchen and tried to put out the flames with water from the air, but there was barely any water. I found the worker who was screaming, but she didn't look scared. She just smiled at me with her hair, as brightly colored as the flames around her, covered her emerald green eyes. With the snap of her fingers the flame disappeared. She was a witch. \"Such spunk you have there.\" Her voice ringed in my ears as the world around me went black. I woke up in my bed the next morning. The whole night in the fire seemed like a dream to me. I would have believed that it was a dream if it wasn't for the fact that my hair still reeked of smoke. I dragged my sore body into the bathroom and leaned over the counter. After about five minutes I finally looked up at my reflection. My hair had completely straightened under the weight over all the soot that had entangled itself into my light brown hair. My face had been turned gray from the ash, and my green-blue eyes were the only feature that could be made out. \"Hey, Kendra? Did you hear about the fire that burned down that little pizzeria last night?\" My mom called from the living room where she was probably drinking her coffee. \"Yeah mom, I heard.\" I replied. I couldn't tell her that I had been in the fire, she would only freak out. Over the next half hour I cleaned all the soot and ash that had come home with me. I slowly packed my bag for school, my homework was finished the night before, but I had no memory of doing it. I started to head out the door, a couple dollars in hand to buy some bagels on the way to school. \"Aren't you going to eat breakfast before you go?\" Mom asked holding a plate of eggs and bacon out to me. I sighed and nodded as I set my bag by the door. I sat and ate my mom's delicious cooking. I finished the breakfast and forced a smile for my mom as I hopped up off the chair, grabbed my bag, and left out the door to go to school. \"Kendra!\" I was caught off guard as Miles picked me up and spun me around in a hug. I was confused, but happy. \"Are you alright.\" I nodded and he quickly regained his usual uncaring appearance. I continued to smile as I noticed Allie smiling off in the distance. Will came up and hugged her from behind. I felt a pang of unexplained jealousy. I wished there was someone who would hug me like that. I didn't want just anybody to hug me, but I didn't know whom I did want. Out of the corner of my eye I noticed a redheaded girl walking up to us. She snuggled up next to Miles, wrapping her arms around his arm. I became ferrous at her, and also didn't trust her, though I had no idea why. She looked at me with her emerald green eyes and smiled. Miles noticed me staring at her. \"Oh, Kendra, this is Scarlet, she saved your life last night.\" ","Summary":" Miles is Merlin, and Allie is King Arthur.

The lights, the screaming crowd, and his friends, waiting for him to make this so special figure, the one that was so impressive and difficult, it would give him a ten if well executed. He jumped and entered the pipe. He began with a rotation, gaining height for the rest of the run. He made some other tricks, then it was it. It was now or never. He took his breath, but it was too late, he had been hesitating, and now he was too short on the jump, his rotation was too close from the slope. His board touched the top of the pipe, giving him a hard time. He lost his balance and his back was the first thing to hit the ground. His left knee was twisted under his weight and he couldn't breath anymore. He blacked out. Stella Cloud was worried. Will fell and now he was gliding on his back along the center of the pipe. He stopped ten meters before the end of the slope, and he was not moving. The crowd was silent. They were waiting for him to get up, to show that he was ok. They waited about one minute, but seeing that the boy was still motionless, some medics joined him. From what she saw, they seemed quite in a hurry, and Stella was getting more anxious as time went by. The medics put her son in a rescue sled and she could hear that an ambulance was coming. She left the crowd to go near the ambulance so she could go to the hospital with Will. The medics arrived with him a short time after her. She saw that her son was still uncouncious. His neck had been immobilized, and his left leg had been put in a brace. She told one of the doctor that she was the mother and she softly touched his head. He no more had his helmet on and she could see that her son was in a bad shape. They had to transfer him to the ambulance, and she saw that the doctors seem quite concerned and made sure not to hurt Will more than he already was. \" Why did you put him in a minerva ? \" Asked Stella to one of the paramedics. \" He is not moving and due to the fall, he may have damaged his spine, and we do not want to take a risk, so we immobilized him to make sure he would not damage it more if it is already broken. \" answered one man. They all got in the ambulance and Stella took place next her broken son, thinking about Will and his shattered dream. * Thanks all for reading this. It is my first fanfiction and I hope you enjoyed it. Tell me if you want to read what's next and please review so it can only get better. *[Chapter 2] Cloud 9- The accident chap.2 He woke up in pain, both physical and mental. He was lying on a bed, his left leg casted up to the middle of his thigh. His torso was aching, and his back was sore. He wondered what happened to him, but then he remembered the fear, the fall and the blackness. His mom was sitting in a chair next to the bed. She was sleeping. She surely had been exhausted by what had happened to her son, and she was now taking a rest. Will looked at all the medical devices that were surrounding him, and while watching, he discovered that some cards were on the cupboard at the end of the room. He couldn't reach for them, nor could he move, as he was too weak. His mom suddenly woke up. And seeing that her son was awake too, she took his hand. \" Will, I was so anxious...You were unconscious for two days after your fall, and we were not sure if the crash had damaged your spine. Fortunately, it was not the case, and the doctors said that due to your good body shape and your young age, you would recover soon. \" Said his mom, smiling to him. Will was a bit numb; he couldn't feel all his body. It was probably the painkillers. He looked at his mother and asked: \" What happened? I can only remember hitting the top of the pipe, but I have no memories after that. \" \" You hit the ground heavily, first your back, then your right leg was somehow twisted by the weight of your body. \" Stella answered, with some sadness. \" Can you tell me what sort of injuries I suffer from?\" \" Not that much, when we consider the fall, and the doctor said that you were lucky not to have break much more. For the injuries themselves, you have had your lungs compressed by the shock, and you broke your right ankle, and you also sprained your knee. You were quite lucky, they said to me, not to suffer form a punctured lung, because one of your rib could have damaged it\" Stella left her seat and came closer to hug her son, and kissed him on the forehead. The hug was quite painful for Will, but it was nice too, knowing his mother was there caring for him. She sat on the edge of the bed and smiled at him. It was not a real happy smile, more of a smile saying, \" I am sorry for you\". \" How much time to recover? \" Asked Will, knowing that the answer may not be what he wanted to hear. \" About six weeks for the knee. But your ankle may need more time, so you are off snowboard for at least two months.\" She answered, thinking about all the things Will didn't know yet, like that viral video of the fall, and she was sure it would make Will feel even worse than all his injuries.

Shell- If there were downsides to having a snail boyfriend it was that his shell could get so cumbersome when trying to cuddle with him. 2. Lessons- Whether Whiplash wanted to admit it or not he had learned so many things from Breakneck. Without meaning to he would observe others and was able to pick out their quirks. Or their weaknesses. He reminded himself often that he was different from Breakneck, and he would only use this ability for good. Or for getting that last tomaco. 3. Crack - Ace Gecko knew Breakneck was going to do the thing seconds before he did it. Before Ace could say a thing Breakneck's neck contorted, getting rigid in areas and making a cracking noise. How the cracking noise came about Ace didn't know as snails did not possess bones. \"Don't do that thing with your neck! It's freaky.\" Ace said. Breakneck smirked at Ace, his uneven grin making the newt shiver. Suddenly Breakneck's neck was loose and normal looking, the smile looking just a little more friendly. Though Ace knew better. \"Aww, does it bother you? \" Breakneck asked before cracking his neck a bit. \"You are a scary, scary snail.\" Ace commented. \"And yet you never stay away for more than a month at a time.\" Breakneck said. Ace sighed deeply. \"I know. Up until I met you I thought I was smart.\" 4. Kiss - Turbo and Hardcase had found that they had gotten into a slightly odd habit. It had stemmed from the days they were hiding their relationship where their meetings sometimes had to be quick. Either Turbo or Hardcase would be standing there, minding their own business, when there was a woosh of air from a quick moving creature and then a quick little kiss before the kisser sped off. Hardcase knew it was coming. So when Turbo came in for a quick smooch this time around this time he grabbed hold of Turbo's face and carefully (taking care not to hurt Turbo with his mandibles) kissed him passionately. 5. \"Oh, here comes Tito. You're going to love him.\" Turbo said, spotting Tito heading in his and Hardcase's direction Hardcase looked unsure. He had never stuck around when it came to humans before. Humans were in possession of large,crushing feet or rolled up magazines. But the fact Turbo trusted him kept him still. \"Hey little amigo!\" Tito said, carrying a tiny tray of small items, some of which could be considered junk but the snails would use to add to their city. \"Got some more of those toothpicks you guys seem to be using alot. I- oh, who's this?\" It took everything in Hardcase to not run off. Human attention never ended well for him before. But he relaxed when Tito smiled. \"This a new amigo of yours?\" Tito asked. \"Can he understand us?\" Hardcase asked Turbo. \"Not really in the sense of language, no. But he'll get the basic message if you give him enough to work with.\" Turbo said before leaning against Hardcase. It took Turbo giving Hardcase a small kiss to realise what Turbo was saying. \"Ohhh, your girlfriend?\" \"Girlfriend!?\" Hardcase cried. \"I said the basic message. Not the exact message. Just roll with it\" Turbo said. Hardcase grumbled slightly to himself. \"Things didn't work out with your old girlfriend? Well, these things happen. In any case, as long you're happy I'm happy. Nice to meet you too.\" Tito said, looking down at Hardcase. Hardcase could only wonder if this was Turbo's version of meeting the parents.[Chapter 2] \"Skid, you are not turning into a vampire. Now stop sticking to the ceiling when you sleep. It's creeping us all out.\" Turbo said. \"The undead do what they feel like.\" Skidmark replied, not moving from his spot on the club house ceiling. \"All this from being attacked by a bat, huh?\" Smoove commented. \"It was a vampire bat! One of the minions of the night, such as I am now.\" Skidmark cried. \"It was a normal, everyday bat. Now get off the dang ceiling!\" Whiplash shouted. Skidmark hissed. \"Oh, you did not just hiss at me!\" Whiplash yelled. Skidmark hissed once more before drawing into his shell. \"That's it. Where's a pencil?\" Whiplash spent the next fifteen minutes locating a pencil and using it to knock Skidmark off the ceiling. Twenty more minutes were spent by everyone chasing Skidmark around the clubhouse, trying to get him out to the light to show him that he indeed was not a vampire. When Skidmark was forced out into the light he twisted and hissed for about one more minute before understanding that he was not burning up. \"Huh… guess I'm not a vampire.\" Skidmark said. \"You think?\" Burn snapped. \"Smoove wishes you had realized that before you bit the heck out of my neck, yo.\" Smoove said. \"Sorry. That was meant more of an eternal lover kiss deal. Didn't mean to make it hurt.\" Skidmark said. \"No big.\" Smoove replied. \"New rule. No more vampire movies for until I've decided this nonsense is out of everyone's heads. Yes Chet, even the sparkly ones.\" Whiplash said. \"Darn.\" Chet grumbled. \"We were on the last movie too.\"[Chapter 3] Notes: First off I want to thank everyone who have faved or reviewed these drabbles. Glad they are being enjoyed. Second, a reminder that I am open to prompts. 1. Movies- Burn loved her action films. She loved the explosions and fights. Chet however did not quite care for action films. The rules of safety were completely thrown out the window in such movies, and the loud explosion noises made him nervous. Yet, he would watch every action film ever if he got to watch them with Burn for the rest of his life. 2. Jacket: (human au verse) Hardcase's jacket was far too big for Turbo. The sleeves went over his hands so he had to grip the inside of the jacket to keep it from slipping off. Even so Turbo loved wearing the green, canvas jacket. And Hardcase found the look endearing. So much so that he couldn't help but wrap his arms around Turbo when he wore it. 3. Drink: \"Who's fool idea was it to let Turbo try an energy drink?\" Whiplash asked. White Shadow slowly raised an eye stalk, a guilty look on his face. \"I didn't think it be a bad thing. He said he felt a little tired today and I thought-\" White Shadow tried to explain. \"I know what you thought. And as well meaning as it was you should and stopped to think what a snail that's already naturally moving around all the time would react to an energy drink.\" Whiplash said. \"But Chet said he use to drink them all the time.\" White Shadow said. \"Yeah. Before the incident that gave him his speed. So because this is your fault, you're going to help me to get him to calm down.\" There was no complaint from White Shadow. \"Okay garden snail.\" Whiplash said as he slid over to Turbo. \"Maybe some racing will get the drink out of your system.\" Turbo was shaking in place, his eye stalks darting in different directions. \"That sounds great! Boy I could really go for a race. I could race all the way to Austria. Want to race to Austria?\" Turbo rattled off at a speed where he could hardly be understood. \"How about we keep it to the track?\" Whiplash replied. \"We can practice jumps.\" White Shadow offered helpfully. Turbo grinned at the idea and revved up a couple of times. \"Sounds great! Oh, how about we make the jumps bigger? Make it a challenge.\" Turbo said. \"Sure!\" White Shadow replied and they headed to the track. Whiplash followed of course to keep a stalk on the two. Luckily after two hours of racing around the track and then attempting to make the worlds biggest sand dune the drinks energy wore out. The passing out from the energy crash was another matter to deal with. As was the odd hangover as if he had been drunk, Turbo had the next morning.[Chapter 4] It had been about two weeks since Turbo had seen any trace of Hardcase. The tiger beetle did have a habit of disappearing for awhile and then turning up as if no time had passed. Sometimes he would bring a gift as a unspoken apology for disappearing And it drove Turbo crazy. Turbo was not the type who enjoyed wondering where his boyfriend was at the latest, darkest hours of the night. Especially when said boyfriend was known for getting into trouble. Turbo was racing out his worries around the track one late night. Skidmark had currently installed lights around the track for such moments. If it was because Skidmark hated to see him pace in the clubhouse or if it was to draw out aliens Turbo didn't know. He had made his nineteenth lap that night when he saw a familiar sight near the finish line. \"Thought I'd find you here.\" Hardcase said, the track lights making his silhouette loom. \"There you are!\" Turbo cried, zipping over to Hardcase. \"Where have you been?\" It was then Turbo noted the state of his boyfriend. He was covered in cuts and bruises and one of his arms were limp at his side \"What happened to you!\" Turbo cried. \"Got into a fight.\" Hardcase said with a slight shrug of one of his shoulders. He slumped down to sit on one of the seats around the racetrack. \"A fight! How did you- wait, no, that makes sense for you. But still, you got into a fight? Just… just stay right there.\" Turbo zoomed off and returned moments later with bandage strips, and a cotton swab with a bit of rubbing something he had gotten from Chet. He started to clean the wounds carefully, trying to ignore when Hardcase hissed from the stinging. \"So. Mind telling me how you got into this fight?\" Turbo asked once he started to wrap the bandage strips. \"Do I have to?\" Hardcase asked. \"Yes you do.\" Hardcase sighed. \"Well, to start with those other bugs started. I was just walking down near the old movie theater and-\" \"Wait. Is this the same movie theater with that gang of silverfish who really, really don't like you?\" Turbo asked. Hardcase hesitated just a moment before answering. \"Yes.\" he said.. \"What did I tell you about going there? You said yourself that the bugs over there hate you. Why would you even go to that area?\" Turbo shouted. \"Yeah, yeah.\" Hardcase grumbled. Turbo finished with the bandaging, sure he had done a good job even if he was as paranoid about germs as his brother was. \"There. At least now you'll hopefully heal faster.\" Turbo said. \"Heh, if you think i'm bad you should see the other guys.\" Hardcase chuckled. Turbo frowned deeply at Hardcase now. Hardcase noticed the frown and stopped laughing. \"You're mad, aren't you?\" Hardcase asked. \"Of course I'm mad. You disappear for weeks and then you come back all beat up. Worst of all you just joke about it like it's nothing. You could have been dead or dying and I wouldn't know.\" \"This from the snail who constantly gets into his own dangerous situations.\" Hardcase mumbled. Turbo's frown went deeper. Hardcase cleared his throat a bit before continueing talking. \"But… yeah. I guess I see your point. I'm just use to not really checking in with anyone, you know? I'm sorry for worrying you and it won't happen again.\" With the sincere apology given Turbo's frown eased. \"Promise?\" Turbo asked. \"I promise.\" Hardcase said before leaning down and resting his forehead against Turbo's. Turbo smiled and closed his eyes a moment. \"Think I can gross out Chet with that cut on my back?\" Hardcase asked after a moment. \"Please don't. I'll never hear the end of it if you do that.\"[Chapter 5] Notes: This one is based off a prompt from tumblr. As always requests are open. Speaking of which, I am working on the requests I did get. So no worries. Requests included, in the future look for some Turbo/Hayaku Turbo/Hardcase/Hayaku One sided Fusion/Hardcase And more Turbo/Hardcase. Thanks for the support and reviews you guys. Smoove Move lived up to his name normally. He certainly was good at being suave and there was no argument to be made about his moves. And Skidmark never complained about their relationship. Still there were moments that weren't as smooth. Even though he knew Skidmark, perhaps more than any of the other crew members, there were still times when he didn't quite get Skidmark. He was a mystery for sure. One of the things Smoove loved about him. But it made getting things for Skidmark hard sometimes. Like the time he had gotten Skidmark a moon rock. The site he had ordered it from claimed they were moon rocks anyways. Either way Smoove had thought the gift would be well accepted by Skid. Instead Skidmark had freaked out about possible moon men virus and spent weeks studying it to make sure it was safe. Not only did that kill any romantic moments for that time span but he felt horrible that he had put Skidmark through that panic. For this next date Smoove was planning on making something that hopefully wouldn't cause such a reaction like the moon rocks. Music was safer and something Smoove knew well. So this shouldn't be a problem. Shouldn't was the key word. He had spent a whole day now trying to figure out the perfect song to play for the date. No matter what genre he shifted through, what obscure song he listened to, he couldn't find the ones that described Skidmark and how much he meant to him. Time was running out. The date in a day and he still had nothing. Sighing Smoove laid his head against the screen of the smartphone, not caring about any streaks or smudges he might leave. \"This shouldn't be this hard.\" Skidmark grumbled to himself. \"All I need is a song that would describe my every feeling for Skid.\" It seemed like the perfect song didn't exist. And for just a second Smoove was going to try and think of something else. Then something occurred to him. Just because the perfect song didn't exist now didn't mean it couldn't. In moments Smoove got to work. Skidmark slid over to outside the track that night, looking for Smoove Move. They had agreed to meet at the track. Not unusual. What was unusual was that Smoove Move was late. Thoughts of what could be keeping Smoove ranged from ninja yeti attacks to the old standby that were aliens. Suddenly Smoove slid up to Skidmark. \"Sorry Skid baby. Time got away from me, you know.\" Smoove said \"Just glad the aliens didn't get you. So ready for our date?\" Skidmark asked. \"Yeah baby. Though I want to share some unique rhythms first. And I mean unique. As in I made it myself.\" Smoove Move smiled at Skidmark. \"I made it for you.\" Activating his speakers the song he had created started to play. It had a fairly slow beat for something Smoove worked on. But there was something signature Smoove about it. The song had no lyrics. And the song didn't need it. There were influences in the song that Skidmark picked up on. A bit from the soundtrack of the first movie he and Smoove had watched on their first date. Some of it from the theme of one of Skids favorite television shows. Soundtrack of happy things associated with Skidmark, brought together in a way that sounded wonderful. The song ended and Skidmark was silent for what Smoove felt was too long. Worry began to dig at Smoove. It was possible that he had miscalculated again. He was about to open his mouth to apologize before Skidmark spoke. \"You really made that for me?\" Skidmark asked in a tender tone. \"Of course. It wasn't really that hard with you as an inspiration.\" Skidmark grinned and leaned in to kiss Smoove. \"I love it. Could you… play it again before we go?\" There was no hesitation as the song started up again, and the two snails leaned against each other. They ended up playing the song two more times before heading to dinner.[Chapter 6] Dancing was not something Hardcase saw himself doing this afternoon. Or ever really. At least not dancing like this. The kind of dancing that depended on both dancers having some form of grace and to know the steps. There was very little of either as Turbo and Hardcase practiced the steps. Hardcase's tall body made this just a little bit awkward. And neither of them were having much luck in remembering the dance steps right. Hardcase was happy that at least no one else was in the crews club as he and Turbo practiced. They looked silly right now and both knew it. And both suspected there would be some teasing if any of the crew saw them right now. It wasn't all bad. The whole thing was a good excuse to be close to each other. Even with the size difference it was good to be so close, hands clasped in the others. \"How did it go again? Quick, quick, slow-\" Hardcase mumbled. \"I don't do slow.\" Turbo said, with a small grin to show he was joking. Hardcase did find the joke amusing enough to grin back at Turbo. \"Neither do I. Maybe that's why we're having so much trouble with this. Why are we doing this again?\" Hardcase asked. \"Charity event, remember?\" Turbo said. Hardcase huffed. \"Right. The charity event. Knew it was some kind of event. I'm going to stick out like a sore thumb there you know.\" he said. \"What makes you say that? Oh, I think you're suppose to dip me here.\" Turbo said quickly. Hardcase quickly dipped Turbo. \"We both know that I don't exactly match the mental image of someone who would be at a higher class event like this.\" Hardcase explained. \"Maybe.\" Turbo said. \"But I'd rather you be there. Besides, if you think you'll stick out, you should see the outfit Skidmark was thinking of wearing until we all had an intervention.\" \"I can only imagine.\" Hardcase chuckled. \"Hardcase…\" \"Yeah?\" \"Can you uh… lift me back up now? The blood is rushing to my head.\" Turbo asked. \"Oh, sorry.\" Hardcase, bringing Turbo up from the dip. \"No problem. Not like looking up at you is a bad view.\" Turbo said. \"Looking down at you isn't bad either.\" Hardcase said. Turbo couldn't help but grin with a hint of a blush to his cheeks. \"Stop, you're flattering me.\" Turbo said. \"Maybe I mean you.\" Hardcase said. \"And maybe I actually really like being flattered and would love for you to do it again.\" \"Maybe I will.\" \"Maybe-\" \"Ahem.\" a voice interrupted. Hardcase and Turbo looked away from each other to see Whiplash standing at the doorway. \"Oh hi Whiplash.\" Turbo said. \"Didn't see you there.\" \"How does he just show up like that?\" Hardcase asked. Whiplash didn't answer at first. Instead he strode over to Turbo and Hardcase and studied their position a moment. Then he spoke. \"First off I swear you two are just needlessly complicated with your sweet talk.\" Whiplash said. He paused then, rolling up his sleeves. \"Also, I'll show you how to actually waltz. Come here.\" Turbo chuckled as Whiplash took an confused Hardcase's hand and pulled him into a Waltz position.[Chapter 7] Notes: This is another set in human au universe. Also, slightly mature things mentioned. But nothing out right sexual or anything like that. A text tone sounded from Chet's cellphone. This worried Chet a bit for two reasons. He very rarely even used the phone except for emergencies or to talk to Burn or Turbo. There was also the fact that while he didn't know who was texting him, the number looked familiar. Like he had glanced it on Turbo's phone once. It clicked suddenly. The text was from Hardcase. Strange as the last time they had interacted it had ended heated. And Hardcase wasn't really one to apologize. That and he didn't recall giving Hardcase his number. Chet had no idea what this was about. A quick glance told him all he needed to know. Without a word he set off to find Turbo, phone still in his hand. He didn't need to go far. Turbo just so happened to be visiting and was currently on the couch, having changed the television to the NASCAR channel. \"Your boyfriend just sent me a picture on my phone.\" Chet said. Chet seemed unusually upset. His face was red and his eyes narrowed at Turbo as if it were a grave insult that was Turbo's fault. \"That's rare. He must have found it to be pretty funny.\" Turbo said, sounding a bit confused. \"I don't think he was trying to be funny. In fact, I think he meant to send it to you.\" Chet said. \"What makes you say that?\" Turbo asked. Chet shoved the phone close to Turbo's face. Turbo's eyes widened at moment as he glanced at the screen. Then he laughed. \"It's not funny!\" Chet cried, growing redder. \"Yes it is. This is so very funny! Oh man, I got to tell Hardcase what he did.\" Turbo said. Turbo called Hardcase, ignoring his brothers dirty look. Once Hardcase picked up Turbo got right to the point. \"Yeah, um, hun, you sent Chet a dick pic.\" Turbo said. There was a pause. Turbo was still grinning as he listened to Hardcase's side of the conversation. \"No, he didn't say if he was impressed or not, let me ask. Hey Chet, Hardcase wants to know what you think from a scale of one to ten..\" \"I'm out of here.\" Chet grumbled, walking away. \"Oh come on Chet, I was kidding!\" Turbo called out. Chet was already gone, hoping going over work related papers would help take the image out of his mind. ","Summary":" 1.

Warning, it probably sucks, just so you know, so read at your own risk. DISCLAIMER: I own nothing but Eliana/Eli and her plot lines. (full name pronounced ell-e-ona, goes by Eli) Two armies on horseback raced across the beach as they prepared to fight. As two soldiers charged ahead of their allies on either side, a lone figure watched from a distance, waiting for the proper moment to intervene. The rider in possession of a staff gained the upper hand and knocked his opponent to the sand, rendering them unconscious. The lone figure began to race forward as the man approached his fallen opponent when suddenly– \"Oof!\" Eli exclaimed as she fell out of her, coincidentally at the same time as her twin sister Allie, whose bed was located on the other side of the room. Eli chuckled when her sister woke with a gasp. \"You alright over there, A?\" she shouted, unnecessarily, to her sister as she stood from the ground. Allie released a groan at her sister's cheekiness as she let her head gracelessly drop back to the floor. \"Just peachy, Eli.\" Shaking her head, Eli walked over to her sister, being sure not to stumble over the numerous boxes that littered the floor. Offering her hand, she pulled Allie to her feet just as their mother threw their bedroom door open. \"Are you girls alright? I heard a thump!\" Taking a moment to observe her daughters, confused laced her features when she realized the situation she had walked in on. \"Allie, sweetheart, what were you doing on the floor?\" Allie roughly elbowed her sister in the stomach as Eli let out a snort. \"Hey! Don't laugh at me. You were on the floor, too.\" Eli just rolled her eyes at her sister. \"Yeah, yeah, whatever little sis.\" she teased, before she noticed her mother's expectant look. \"Weird dream, don't worry about it.\" She spoke nonchalantly as she picked up one of several books that laid in boxes. It was Allie's turn to scoff. \"Speak for yourself,\" she shouted to her sister, who was engrossed in a book. \"We fell out of bed, and if you ask me, it hurt like hell.\" Their mother simply smiled as she readjusted her grip on the box she was holding. \"Aw, you two used to do that all the time when you were four.\" She spoke nostalgically, as if remembering something from the day before. Allie rolled her eyes. \"Well, I don't think I was dreaming of medieval combat when I was four.\" At this, Eli torn her gaze from her book and looked to her sister with curious ears. \"You too?\" she inquired as they shared a look, before coming to a conclusion. \"Twin Telepathy.\" they spoke simultaneously, false seriousness plastered on their faces, until their broke out into fits of giggles. Their mom smiled fondly at her daughters. \"I was.\" she interrupted the laughter. \"What a surprise.\" Allie responded sarcastically. Eli frowned down at her sister. \"Now Allie, my sweet, sweet baby sister, I'm the only sarcastic one in this family.\" Smirking slightly, she began to nudge her twin with her elbow before their mother cleared her throat, regaining their attention. \"Well, as long as you two are up, you can start to unpack.\" Eli groaned as her mother left the room, and she and Allie knelt down next to one of the boxes. Sighing, Allie pulled a brochure of their new school from the box, along with a flyer for track tryouts. Scoffing, Allie crumbled the paper up, throwing it across the room, before muttering a disappointed \"Yeah right.\" Eli smiled sympathetically as she placed a comforting hand on the younger twin. \"come on,\" she said as she adorned a fake smile. \"These boxes aren't going to pack themselves.\" After unpacking a few boxes, albeit grudgingly, the twins left their room to see their parents unpacking their last few boxes. \"Hey girls, all done unpacking?\" he asked cheerfully as he carried a box across the room. \"Uh, almost.\" Allie responded with mock joy as her eyes followed her dad across the room. \"I see King Arthur and his Merry Men have taken over the house.\" She commented sarcastically as she picked up a box. \"It was Robin Hood who had the Merry Men sweetheart.\" Their mom corrected obliviously as she reentered the house. Eli removed herself from her position leaning against the wall as she finished her mother's thought. \"King Arthur had the Knights of the Round Table. Shouldn't you know this? Robin Hood was only like, your favorite cartoon movie, EVER!\" Eli teased as she returned to her book. \"And you know the story of King Arthur, sweetie.\" their mom commented from another room. Suppressing a groan, Allie replied as she began to unpack only some of the may books their family had. \"Yes, I know that. How could I not know that when it's all you three talk about.\" \"Your mom and I are professors of medieval literature, sweetie. It's our job to talk about it. And it's not your sister's fault she has good taste in literature.\" the only man in the house stated. \"Thank you!\" Eli shouted from her place at the table as she remained engrossed by her novel. Allie scoffed once again. \"I know but you guys talk about King Arthur so much I'm starting to dream about him.\" She set her handful of books down as she continued speaking. \"Not like most girls who dream about knights in shining armor. Mine had dirt all over them, an– and B.O., and are missing half their teeth!\" she exclaimed at the end as she threw her arms up to emphasize her point. \"Well,\" Eli chimed in as she finally set her book down. \"Think of it this way. Better to dream of that that some ax murderer trying to kill you, and at least your dreams are anatomically correct.\" She offered sarcastically as she patted her twin's shoulder. \"Your sister's right, you know.\" their dad commented unnecessarily. Allie groaned. \"Seriously dad?\" she exclaimed as she continued unpacking. He threw his hands up in mock surrender. \"Your right, sorry.\" As Allie reluctantly dusted off the dirty books, Eli took this time to say what had been on both of their minds since that morning. \"Why do we even bother unpacking, guys?\" She spoke, bitterness hidden, almost professionally, from her tone as she placed her hands on her hips. \"I mean, we're just gonna pack up and move in six months again, right?\" Her parents shared as look before speaking two their daughters. \"You see girls, it's not going to be six months this time.\" At this, Allie turned to address their parents with a slightly panicked voice. \"What, one month? Two? Maybe we should just legally change our names to 'New Girls'.\" Their father responded with a sigh. \"It's gonna be three years.\" The twins froze in their tracks, before large grins began to break out onto their faces. \"What?!\" they shouted simultaneously. Their mom responded meekly. \"We're gonna be here for three years. This place is, special.\" she spoke as she shared a knowing look with her husband. \"Wait, so we're staying?\" the younger twin spoke in disbelief as Eli already began to fidget with excitement. \"Yes,\" their dad began. \"Now, I know three years is a long time, but–\" \"Wait,\" Allie interrupted. \"We're gonna be at Avalon High until we graduate?\" At her father's nod, Eli finished her sister's thought. \"So you mean we're actually gonna be able to try out for sports, and finish the season, and make friends for once?\" she questioned, although she already knew the answer. When their mom and dad nodded again, Allie screamed out in cheers of happiness. Eli smirked at her little sister's excitement as she practically ran around the room, before returning to their shared bedroom. Looking at her parents, she smiled gently while she commented nonchalantly, \"Well, I think she took that rather well.\" before she engulfed her parents in a tight embrace. \"Thank you.\" she spoke, her voice barely above a whisper. Releasing her parents from her death grip, she took a step back as Allie came plowing past her to the front door. \"Hey Eli!\" she shouted as she struggled to pull on her shoes. \"I'm going for a run, wanna join?\" Smirking at her sister's hastiness, Eli responded playfully. \"Nah, I'm good. I wouldn't want to embarrass you if you happen to run into any hot guys.\" Allie rolled her eyes at her sister's teasing as she ran out the door, shouting a goodbye to the rest of her family. While Allie went on her run, Eli was content to sit on the couch and resume reading her book. Okay, so there is chapter one. I know I should probably be updating my other stories, but I recently rewatched Avalon High and a bunch of other movies, and I've had so many ideas that I just had to start writing a bunch of new stories. Hope ya liked it, if ya didn't, then let me know what I can improve. Auf Wiedersehen![Chapter 2] I know, I suck. Sorry I haven't updated in like, 300 years, but I've been going through some really difficult family things, but I promise I'll try to be more active, even though that probably won't happen due to my unreliable nature. But yeah, sorry about that. Also, just to clarify, the name she goes by sounds like the commonly male name \"Eli\", because she thinks her actual name sounds too feminine. A/N: I own nothing but any characters/plot lines you don't recognize. \"Do we have to go?\" Eli groaned as she, Allie, and their mom pulled up to our new school. \"I mean, come on. Can't I just get a GED online or something? Is the whole \"socializing with other human beings\" thing really necessary?\" Allie chuckled at her sister's sarcasm, while their mother merely ignored her oldest daughter. \"So,\" she began as she turned to face her children. \"Are you nervous? Eli, you must be nervous. Sarcasm is just a defense mechanism.\" At this, the girls simultaneously scoffed. \"Mom, please, it's like our millionth first day of school.\" Allie denied vehemently. \"Mhmm\" their mom mocked. \"So you're nervous?\" \"Of course I'm nervous!\" Allie exclaimed dramatically. Eli let out a bark of laughter at her sister before commenting \"I'm never nervous mom. And seriously? Sarcasm is not a defense mechanism, it is merely my default state.\" Their mother sighed at her odd daughter. \"Whatever you say my dear.\" After cracking her knuckles, Eli clapped her hands together as she exclaimed, \"Well, not to break up this very interesting conversation, but Allie and I have our first day of Hell to attend to, so if you wouldn't mind,\" she trailed off as she gestured to the car door. \"Of course.\" the oldest Pennington woman stated as she unlocked her car. \"Good luck girls!\" she leaned over the passengers seat to address her daughters. \"I'll pick you up at three.\" \"Oh!\" Allie proclaimed as a thought came to mind. \"Make it five. I'm going out for track, remember?\" she said while sending a glare to her older sister, who happened to be mocking her from behind. \"Yeah yeah, we know, you're an athlete. Come on, I don't want to miss any of the exhilarating high school hallway drama. Bye mama!\" Eli shouted over her shoulder as she dragged Allie away from the car, and towards the building that was to be their new torture chamber for the next who knows how many months. \"So you seriously didn't get your mystery boy's name yesterday?\" Eli exclaimed as the twins trekked the hallways in search of their lockers. She legitimately couldn't believe her sister hadn't bothered to get the name of the hot boy she coincidentally ran into on her run right after Eli had mocked her about it. \"Eliiiiiiiiii.\" Allie groaned as her sister pestered her for information she didn't have. The oldest twin raised her hands in a mock-innocent gesture. \"Hey, I'm just saying, when you literally run into a random hot guy, you usually at least ask for their name, if not their phone number.\" she ended with a teasing wink as they began to pass one of the many halls lined with lockers. Suddenly, they heard a bang from the end of said hallway. \"Now Marco,\" they heard a kid scoff as a guy dressed head to toe in black threw a book bag to the floor. \"why can't you just steal my lunch money like every other bully? I need my locker. What's wrong with yours?\" the boy groaned as he faced the taller guy who was apparently named Marco. \"Well Miles, since you asked, mine's too far from class.\" Marco snarkily responded as he effortlessly intimidated his victim. \"Oh please,\" Miles scoffed once again. \"Like you even go to class.\" Eli snickered loudly at the scene before her, earning an elbow to the rib from her little sister. \"Dude's got a point you know.\" She commented with a shrug, earning a glare from the bully who somehow overheard her. This resulted in Eli sending him a cheeky smirk and a wink, after which he turned back to Miles with a roll of his dark eyes. \"Give me the combination!\" he snarled as he slammed the book out of the dork's hands. \"One, two, three, four, five.\" Miles counted off mockingly before getting grabbed by the collar of his shirt and getting roughly shoved into the wall of lockers. \"Give it to me, preschool, or I'll put you in the locker.\" Marco threatened sarcastically. \"Would he even fit in one of the lockers?\" Eli muttered to her sister, whom shrugged in response, as they watched this all unfold. \"Wow, nerd in a locker, how original. We're now living inside of an eighties teen movie.\" Miles responded sarcastically, trying not to let his fear show. Just as Marco went to slam the smaller boy back into the lockers, a voice came from the very end of the hall. \"That's enough Marco!\" shouted a boy who adorned a Letterman jacket as he approached the pair. \"Grrrrreeeeaaaatttt,\" he drawled out as he turned to face the new addition. \"If it isn't Will Wagner here to save the day. My hero.\" Marco said the name in such disdain it was a surprise steam wasn't pouring out of his ears. \"What are you gonna do Will? Hit me?\" \"And the plot thickens.\" Eli commented, earning a snort from Miles who overheard her comment. \"Shut up.\" Allie mumbled from beside her, resulting in Eli rolling her bright blue eyes. \"Your now worth the detention.\" the boy now identified as Will stated as he looked at Marco, disgust written all over his face. \"Just get out of here before I change my mind.\" Marco humorlessly laughed as he began to turn away, before he tried to make another go at Miles, ending in him being pushed away by the jock, Eli assumed. The boy stormed up to him, clearly pissed off, but didn't do anything. Instead, he just scoffed and muttered a \"whatever\" before turning to mumble a threat to Miles. \"He can't protect you twenty four hours a day.\" he threatened with a smirk on his face. \"Oh, wow,\" Miles spoke up, gaining some confidence from his new \"protector\". \"You Know that there are twenty four hours in a day? You must be evolving .\" he spoke the last word slowly, as though speaking to a child. As Marco approached the pair of sisters, Eli plastered on a mocking smirk. She tsked as though in disappointment and said the the man \"So intimidating. Much wow.\" Marco just scowled as he passed by her and continued down the hall. \"No really! The brooding bad boy thing is super hot!\" She shouted after him sarcastically as he walked away. \"Thanks, Will.\" Miles said as he gathered up his school things from the floor. \"I was about to, as they say, throw down with him, but I thought you'd wanna deal with him since he's your brother.\" Will looked away in embarrassment as he chocked out the word \"Step-brother.\" before looking up and finally noticing the Pennington sisters. \"Come on.\" Allie mumbled as she quickly pulled her sister down the hall to again search for their lockers, with the jock shouting a \"Hey!\" behind them. As they somehow immediately found their lockers and began to put in the combinations to open them, the man came running up to them shouting \"Hey! Water fountain girl!\" At this Eli paused, and turned to face her blushing sister with a knowing smirk and a quirked eyebrow. Sending a glare to her sister that clearly said \"Shut up!\", Allie turned to face Will, stuttering out a flustered \"I guess that's me. Hi.\" \"I didn't know you went to Avalon high.\" he spoke cheerfully as he conversed with the youngest twin. 'Well, someone has a crush...' Eli thought as she watched her sister and the boy. Allie plastered on a forced smile. \"Yeah, I didn't know you went here either. Although, technically we don't know anyone who goes here. We're new.\" She rambled on before a look of horror came over her face. \"I mean, my name's not new, it-it's Allie.\" She said in one breathe. Eli chuckled at her sister's predicament before she stuck out her hand. \"I'm Eliana, but call me that and I'll cut out your tongue. I go by Eli, Allie's older and much funnier twin sister.\" she spoke as she shook Will's hand. \"I'm Will\" he chuckled at the two sisters. \"And really? Twins? You two don't look anything alike.\" He commented offhandedly. \"We know.\" the girls intentionally responded simultaneously, before breaking into chuckles at the terrified look on Will's face. \"But there, now you officially know one person.\" Will said nervously, clearly still disturbed by their \"twin telepathy\". Allie chuckled lightly while Eli rolled her eyes. \"We're practically homecoming queens.\" she spoke while doing her best to ignore her sister gagging at the mention of homecoming, resulting in Will letting out a bark of laughter. \"S-so,\" Allie began to stutter, showing her nervousness. \"Are you on the track team? Y'know, because of the running in the park. O-or maybe you just like running. I love running.\" Allie gasped for breathe after her little rant. Eli smother her smirk and sent a discreet thumbs up to her sister as Will replied \"Uh, actually football. I'm kinda the quarterback.\" Eli hummed in content as she muttered a \"Cool\" with a slight nod of her head. \"Ah, of course.\"Allie unknowingly said aloud, before her face morphed into a look of embarrassment. \"I mean, because you seem so quarterback-esque.\" Smirking, Eli faked a cough while mumbling \"smooth\" to her sister, earning her a light jab in the ribs, before a red head came up and planted a kiss on Will's cheek. \"Hey sweetie,\" she said as she placed her hand on his shoulder. \"Come on, I wanna make sure we get seats together in history.\" 'Well fuck.' Eli thought as she placed a sympathetic hand on her little sister's arm. \"Oh, hi.\" the girl exclaimed as she took notice of Eli and Allie. Will took this moment to introduce them all. \"Jen, this is Allie and Eli. They're new. Allie, Eli, this is my girlfriend Jen.\" \"Hi, nice to meet you.\" Jen chuckled as she shook their hands. Allie quietly mumbled out a greeting, while Eli just responded with a tight lipped smile. \"There you go, you're friends have already doubled.\" Will joked. \"Wow, so impressive.\" Eli sarcastically stated, slight hostility in her voice, though no one seemed to notice. \"Will, Jen.\" another figure spoke as he came up to his friends. \"Where were you guys this morning? Didn't you get my text? Five burgers for five bucks!\" the boy exclaimed in delight. \"I like you.\" Eli said bluntly as she pointed at said boy. Will chuckled once more. \"Guys, this human garbage disposal is my best buddy Lance. Lance, this is Allie and Eli.\" \"Hi.\" Allie responded shyly whilst Eli said boisterously, \"Cheap food? I'm liking this place more and more every second.\" Lance chuckled before gesturing to the red head. \"Have you guys met Jen yet? Jen's the coolest chick in school.\" He spoke almost longingly as he stared at his best friend's girlfriend. Eli narrowed her eyes slightly at the two, causing Jen and Lance to avoid her gaze. 'Something's not right here...' Eli thought to herself as she observed the group of three. \"Yep, that she is.\" Will spoke fondly of his girlfriend. Jen blushed as she wrapped her arms around the boys. \"Aw, thanks guys.\" Just as Eli was about to make a comment that would likely make everyone uncomfortable, the bell rang, signaling the need to start heading to class. \"So, what's your first class?\" Will inquired as he attempted to get a look at the girls' schedules. Allie fumbled with her schedule, while Eli didn't bother to get hers out, seeing as the twins shared the same exact schedule. \"Um,\" Allie began as she read off the piece of paper. \"European history with Mr. Morse.\" Eli jokingly banged her head against the lockers as she let out a groan. \"Oh joy.\" The group of three perked up at this news. \"Oh, we've got that too.\" the red headed beauty spoke as they began to walk away. \"Come with us.\" Allie spared a glance with Eli, whom simply shrugged before commenting, \"Well, might as well get this day over with. And with that, the twins followed after their newly found friends. Well, there is chapter 2. Probably sucked, cuz I'm shit at writing. Just warning you, updates are always very inconsistent with me. I can't really help it, my personal life is a fucking mess. Anyway, hope you could at least tolerate this chapter, I'll be genuinely shocked if anyone made it this far, and if you did, congrats, you have a high tolerance for idiocy. Anyways, read and leave reviews, I want to hear if there is anything I can improve on. Peace.[Chapter 3] A/N: oops? (also warning, f-bombs and innuendos await you in this chapter) As the twins entered the classroom, Eli was less than thrilled to see the number of students that she would be forced to work with. To say she was not a people person would be the understatement of the millenium. \"Alright everybody, grab a book, and a seat!\" the overly cheery teacher exclaimed as he wrote on the board. \"What if I wanted to stand the entire period?\" Eli announced sarcastically. \"Shut up.\" Allie muttered as she glared at her twin. The teacher was less than pleased with her attitude. \"Wonderful, it seems we have acquired a female Marco. This should be interesting. William!\" Mr. Morse's tone made a complete one-eighty as the star of the school entered the room. Will turned around as the class began to take their seats. Allie and Eli awkwardly stood off to the side, waiting to speak with Mr. Morse. \"Rumor has it you're gonna lead Avalon football to state for the first time this year.\" Eli faked a yawn, earning another elbow to the stomach, something that no longer fazed her. Will chuckled modestly as the male students in the class cheered. \"Um, that's the plan, sir.\" \"That's my boy.\" Morse said affectionately. \"Class president, homecoming king, straight A student, and he's polite . If only I had a whole class filled with Will Wagners.\" He directed towards Marco, who had finally entered the class. \"I think I'm gonna puke.\" Marco announced before throwing his stuff to the ground. Smirking, Eli turned in his direction. \"Well, it looks like dark and moody has to come to class, just like the rest of us.\" She taunted confidently, earning her a room full of chuckles, and a single heated glare. She turned around when Allie tugged on her sleeve. \"Here.\" Morse said softly as he handed the girls their books. Seeing the cover, Eli let out a loud laugh whilst Allie chuckled softly. Adjusting his position, Morse addressed the girls in a stiff tone. \"I'm sorry, is there a problem, misses…\" he trailed off. \"Pennington. Allie Pennington?\" she spoke softly. \"Gee thanks, not like I have a name or anything.\" Morse's face turned into one of realization as he let out a semi-surprised exclamation. \"Well,\" he snorted, \"that explains everything.\" Sitting on his desk, he announced to the class, \"Uh, everyone please welcome Avalon High's newest students, Allie and Eliana Pennington.\" \"Call me anything other than Eli and I'll break bones.\" Eli warned threateningly, being sure to glare at the class, causing quite a few students to shrink into their seats. Seeing as her threat had done the job, she smirked and gestured for Morse to continue speaking. \"Uh, alright. Allie and Eli's parents are professors of medieval literature at the university, and uh, they also wrote the textbook, that we will be using this semester, when we learn about King Arthur and his court.\" \"Easy A.\" Lance coughed into his hand, making the class erupt in laughter. Morse mocked him, coughing into his hand, \"Nobody asked you.\" Eli rolled her eyes at the people she would be dealing with for God knows how many years. \"Welp, now that that completely unnecessary announcement has been made, uh, where do we sit?\" She inquired impatiently, tapping her foot to the beat of a random song in her head. Morse cleared his throat uncomfortably at the oldest twin. \"Alright. Allie, you'll sit next to Miles, and Eli, you will sit next to your apparent twin, Marco.\" A glint appeared in his eyes as he instructed Eli where to sit. Rolling her bright blue eyes, Eli made her way to dark and moody whilst Allie walked to her seat by the nerdy boy from earlier. Sitting down, she turned to face the boy she planned on tormenting for the next year. \"Well, since we're apparently twins, does this mean I get to paint your nails and do your makeup? Because I have this pink lipstick that would look absolutely fabulous on you.\" Eli smiled deviously as she unleashed her sarcasm on the boy. Not facing her, Marco gave her the middle finger, hoping she would shut the hell up. Eli had other plans. Leaning over, she whispered into his ear, \"Oh sweetie, you wish I would fuck you, but you see, you just aren't my type.\" She gave him a pitiful stare as she leaned back into her seat. When Marco turned around, Eli expected to see an annoyed frown on his face, but was instead surprised with the smallest smirk she had ever seen someone manage. Copying her actions, Marco leaned into her ear, and whispered tauntingly, \"That's not what it seemed like earlier.\" Eli choked on her words slightly as the man next to her relaxed into his seat again. While she would admit that she had found Marco somewhat attractive earlier, she would never let him know that. Discretely, she recomposed herself as Mr. Morse began to speak to the class. \"Okay, first thing we are going to do is break up into teams to write research papers.\" Eli internally groaned at the thought. She hated essays. Writing, eh. Research, on the other hand, could go suck a cactus in Eli's opinion. \"You'll draw your topics,\" Morse held up multiple pieces of paper. \"From this.\" he said as he dropped them into a medieval helmet. \"You have got to be kidding me.\" Eli muttered under her breath, not seeing the slight nod of Marco's head. \"Courtney, you're with Todd.\" Morse announced as the girl reached into the helmet and pulled out a slip of paper. \"Ah, the architecture of Camelot. Interesting. Will! You're with Karen,\" \"Can't I be with Jen?\" Will inquired hopefully. Morse sighed. \"No, Jen's with Lance. Now pick.\" Sighing disappointedly, he reached into the helmet. Reading it, Morse chuckled slightly. \"Huh, how apropos. The sports of Camelot. Jennifer.\" When Jen revealed her topic, Morse's mood became considerably darker. \"The tragedy of Camelot. Now, you're paper will be about the love triangle between King Arthur, his wife Guinevere, and his best friend Sir Lancelot. Ultimately, it destroyed Arthur and, uh, Camelot itself.\" Eli's gazed hardened significantly as Jen and Lance shared a look. If she didn't think something was going on before, she definitely thought so now. \"Bit of a downer.\" Morse commented, causing the students to laugh. \"Miles, you're with Allie!\" he announced as he moved towards the youngest twin. \"I'd rather work alone.\" Miles spoke stiffly. \"Rude.\" Eli bit out sharply, causing the boy to shrink away from her slightly. Morse cleared his throat. \"And I'd rather be eating pineapple on a beach in Hawaii, but that's not gonna happen either.\" Smiling, Allie grabbed a piece of paper from the helmet. \"The Order of the Bear.\" At this, Eli visibly became much more alert, as did Marco, although she didn't notice. Frowning, Allie turned the paper around and stared at it in confusion. \"What? I've never heard of that before.\" Morse sighed. \"Ask your parents. I'm sure they've heard of the order.\" Quickly writing on a piece of paper, Eli crumbled it up and discretely threw it to her sister. When it hit Allie in the head, she glared at her twin, who motioned for her to read it. In messy handwriting, the note simply said, \"I'll show you the book at home.\" Nodding, Allie quickly put the note into her pocket, and Eli turned back to Mr. Morse. When he finally got to her, he smiled sinisterly and spoke tauntingly, \"Well it seems Angry and Sarcastic are gonna be working together. \" Eli slammed her head onto her desk dramatically. \"Do I have to? I'd rather just take the fail.\" \"Ha. Yeah, no. Now pick.\" Sighing Eli mumbled some less-than-school-appropriate words under her breath, before pulling out her paper. \"Ah.\" Morse said thoughtfully as he looked at the paper. \"I doubt you will have any trouble with this topic. The Lost Queen Eliana.\" Smirking, Eli let out a confident, \"Piece of cake.\" before turning to Marco as Morse continued on. \"Listen asswipe, just because I'm named after this chick doesn't mean I will be doing this paper on my own. So cancel your plans for this afternoon, because you are coming over to my house so we can get this shit over with. Got it? Good. Here.\" she demanded firmly, before handing him a slip of paper with her address and a time on it. Marco chose not to reply, deciding it wasn't worth the energy. Neither knew that this was the beginning of a rather interesting duo.[Chapter 4] A/N: I am the living, breathing personification of commitment issues. The school day had finally come to an end, but unfortunately for Eli, she would have to stay after school for a little while longer so that Allie could try out for track. Hence why, much to her chagrin, Eli was sat in the last row of the uncomfortable and slightly ass-numbing plastic bleachers that overlooked the football field. \"You know, you'd think this school would be able to afford some more comfortable chairs, considering the school board basically shits gold.\" she mumbled to herself as she dug through her already overflowing backpack, searching for her book. She gave a sigh of content as she finally retrieved it from the abyss, and relaxed against the hot plastic. \"You know,\" Eli quickly spun around in her seat as an easily recognizable and completely unwanted voice begun to speak. \"The school spends all its money on gear for the meat heads and morons instead of things that would actually be useful.\" She rolled her eyes and subconsciously cracked her neck as she adjusted so she could fully face him. \"Wow, thank you for your completely unnecessary and unasked for input, Marco. I really appreciate it.\" He smirked as her voice and posture oozed sarcasm. \"Do you make it a habit to talk to yourself, then? Or do you have little voices inside your head that respond to you?\" Eli began to chuckle before attempting to cover it with a cough. It didn't work. \"Yes actually, and right now the voices are telling me that I should rip you a new asshole so you can have two sticks shoved up your ass, instead of the one that is ever-present in every situation you're in.\" Marco's devious smirk widened. \"So you like watching me, is that it?\" Eli's naturally rosy cheeks swiftly took on the pigmentation of a tomato at that. \"I-I uh, wha- no!\" she spluttered as she stood up in defense. \"I absolutely do not watch you!\" Marco crossed his arms over his chest as he leaned against the brick wall. \"Mmhmm. Keep telling yourself sweetheart.\" If possible, Eli's cheeks turned even redder in a mix of anger and embarrassment as she stormed up to him. \"Never,\" she growled as she pointed her finger in his face, standing a mere five inches away from him. \"Ever, call me sweetheart again. Got it, douchebag?\" As he began to lean away from the wall, his smirk still plastered to his rosy lips, Eli's eyes narrowed and she roughly shoved him back into the wall. Marco's demeanor changed almost instantly. The smirk disappeared from his face and he suddenly looked much larger, and much more intimidating. Faster than she could comprehend, Marco grabbed onto her forearms and spun them around, slamming her against the bricks. As she struggled against him, Eli suddenly became aware of how close his face was to her own, and felt her breath become stuck in her throat. Leaning in even more, their faces now only two inches apart, Marco glared through slitted eyes and gritted teeth. \"If I were you, sweetheart , I'd be careful not to touch me again. Unless, of course, you can come up with some friendlier ways to go about it.\" His smirk quickly made a reappearance as he gave her a cheeky wink. Eli took him by surprise when she mirrored his smirk and leaned in close, letting her lips graze his ear. \"I wouldn't touch you if you were the last person in the entire universe.\" She whispered sensually, before breaking free of his grip and walking back to her backpack. Lifting it onto her shoulder, she turned and faced the track, where the runners were already sprinting around the track. Glancing across all the faces, Eli's lips widened into a large smile as she spotted Ali, quickly making her way to the front of the pack. Her smile lessened, however, when she suddenly was no longer staring at her younger sister running on a track, but watching as a group of knights and their horses raced across a white beach, much like the dream she had experienced the previous night. With a blink, she was once again staring at her sister as she crossed the finish line, the first one, to be exact. Smiling, Eli turned and made her way to the parking lot where her mom would meet her and Allie. She didn't notice Marco's curious and thoughtful gaze as he watched her go, having witnessed the exact vision that she had. Edited: TBA A/N: Yes I'm aware this is short, but I figured this would be a good place to end the chapter.[Chapter 5] (A/N: i suck) When the Pennington finally arrive home, Eli jumped out of the passengers side of the family van and ran inside, shouting a thank you to her mother before slamming the front door shut. Swinging open their bedroom door, she made quick work of putting away the remainder of her belongings still scattered across the carpet. If you asked, she'd never tell you it was because of Marco's impending arrival. She threw her dirty clothes into a bin, planning to do her and Allie's laundry that night, and finished placing all of her books neatly on to her shelf. Organized alphabetically, of course. As Allie closed the door quietly behind her, she smirked at her sister's actions. \"What, nervous about a certain someone coming over?\" Usually very observant, Eli jumped at her sister's voice. She hadn't noticed her come in. \"Could it be, a boy, perhaps?\" Allie's smirk disappeared when a dirty towel landed on her head. Immediately pulling it off, she scowled at her sister's amused grin. \"Please, I couldn't care less about Marco. But, being the wonderful sister I am, I was going to let you and Miles have the reading room, and I figured people should be able to at least walk through our room without tripping over something. But I guess if you keep teasing me, I'll just let you two deal with the bedroom instead.\" Eli wore a victorious smirk as Allie huffed and began to help clean the room. \"You know, we have like a thousand books on King Arthur, but I don't think I've ever read anything about the Order of The Bear, or Queen Eliana. Care to fill me in a bit.\" Eli shrugged her shoulders as she finished making her bed. \"The Order of The Bear is a pretty obscure topic, so that's not really surprising. But the book will fill you in, so I'll give that to you when we're finished. Same goes with Queen Eliana really. She's only mentioned in most books. There's only, like, three that go into detail about her life.\" As Allie put the last of the cardboard boxes into her closet, she turned to her twin. \"Then give me the short story. I mean, she has to have been at least a bit interesting for you to be named after her.\" Eli smirked. \"You know mom and dad, of course they named me after her. Hell, I'm surprised they didn't name you Arthur.\" They both chuckled at the thought. She wasn't wrong. \"But basically, she was Arthur's twin sister, she was born first actually, and was his greatest advisor. Like, he valued her opinion above anyone else's, which was really rare in those times, since she was a woman. But a couple year's before Arthur's death, she disappeared.\" \"You mean like, she ran away?\" Allie inquired as confusion set in. Eli shook her head and sat down in her desk chair. \"No, like she vanished. The last account of her is being in the castle, telling Arthur that they and the Knights of the Round Table needed to have a meeting, that it was urgent, and then, poof. Gone. She was a no show at the gathering, and no one knew where she had gone. Arthur was heartbroken, according to my books, and he searched for her for years. Even up to his death. Quite sad, really.\" Allie pondered the story for a few minutes as Eli reorganized her desk for the hundredth time since they had moved in. \"That's definitely not what I was expecting.\" She finally said. \"But, then why isn't she mention more often in books? I figure that's be kind of important information.\" Eli sighed as she closed one of the connected file cabinets on her desk. \"Like I said Allie, she might have been Arthur's sister, but she was a woman. She never married, though some books theorize she was involved with one of the knights, and she never had children. In those times, that was the only important thing a girl could do. So they didn't bother to record that much information on her. But let me tell you, the things that were recorded, and are actually included in the books, damn. It's no wonder mom and dad named a kid after her. She was pretty fricking cool if you ask me.\" Allie's crystal eyes shined with wonder at her sister's words. \"But so am I, so it makes sense.\" The younger twin groaned at Eli's witty comment, and grabbed a small pillow from the bed and smacked the back of her head with it. \"Hey! Watch it! I could sue you, you know.\" She squealed in annoyance, but smiled nonetheless. \"You could, but you won't. You love me too much.\" Eli rolled her eyes at her sister's antics. \"Yeah yeah, whatever.\" She mumbled under her breath, spinning her chair around and relaxing a bit. \"Wait,\" Allie paused as she situated herself on her bed. \"You said she never married.\" Eli nodded her head lazily and gave a hum of agreement. \"Then why do people think she had something going on with one of the knights. It's not like they had Facebook relationship statuses back then or something.\" Eli snorted a bit at the thought of medieval knights using Facebook. \"I don't know. I think it was something about her name almost always being mentioned with another guy's name. Besides Arthur anyways. But remember, it's just a theory.\" \"What's the dude's name?\" Eli searched her brain for the name, but eventually gave up and shrugged her shoulders again. \"No clue. Can't remember.\" Allie scoffed and fell back against her soft pillows. \"No way. You? Can't remember something you read? I guess the world has ended.\" \"Oh stop being dramatic.\" Standing up, she stretched her toned limbs out before walking towards the door. \"Well, you coming? We both have people coming over, and I don't know about you, but I can hardly stand Marco on a full stomach. I might actually kill him if I'm hungry.\" Allie quickly sat up and ran out of the bedroom, followed by the sarcastic laughter of her older sister. After finished her food, Eli took her and Allie's plates and rinsed them off, and placing them in the dishwasher. As she began to do the same with all the others, the doorbell gave a high pitched ring. \"Allie! Get the door!\" she shouted over her shoulder, blowing some of her red locks out of her mouth. \"Why can't you?\" her sister exclaimed from her place on the couch in front of the television. \"Lazy asshole.\" Eli mumbled to her self, removing her foam covered hands from the soapy water. \"I a bit busy at the moment. So open the damn door or I'm never doing your laundry again.\" The blonde scrambled off the couch and, after giving her sister the finger, opened the front door. \"Marco.\" she said distastefully upon seeing him outside the door. \"Pennington.\" He greeted in the same tone. \"Now children, play nice, or do I have to put you in time out?\" she teased without looking at the two. Marco grumbled inaudibly as he was let into the house. Allie slammed the door shut behind him. \"I'll be in the reading room. He's your problem now.\" She disappeared into the biggest room in the house, harshly closing the door. \"I'll be finished in a minute.\" Eli informed the teen as he awkwardly stood in the kitchen with her. Taking a hand from the sink, a bit of soap fell to the floor as she pointed down the hall. \"Just chill in my room. Third door on the right, you can't miss it.\" With a roll of his tired eyes, he started down the hall. \"Hey Marco!\" she shouted, causing him to halt. He slowly turned around, quirking a brow in annoyance. \"Yeah?\" his deep voice drawled, making Eli smirk in amusement. \"Try not to break anything.\" she teased as her teeth sunk into her bottom lip to contain her laughter. He huffed, but nodded his head anyways and made his way to her room. Turning back to the dishes, she finished the last of them and quickly dried off her hands. She grabbed her shabby backpack from the chair she had left it on, and took her time walking to her room. While she most certainly did not trust Marco alone in her room, she wasn't exactly excited about working with him, so she felt no need to rush to his side. When she opened the door, her temper flared at the sight of Marco inspecting her bookshelf, one of her favorite novels in his large hands. Hearing her open and close the door, he shut the book and place it back in its spot on the shelf. \"I didn't know you could read.\" he quipped as she set her bag on the floor. \"Making a Harry Potter reference, Marco? I didn't know you were such a nerd.\" She squatted to the floor and removed her history things from the bag. When she looked up at him, he gestured to her books. \"Really? You're calling me a nerd. You probably have more books here than you do friends. Although,\" he sat down in the chair she had been lounging in less than an hour ago. \"that can't be too difficult.\" She rolled her cerulean eyes and stood up, picking out two books from the shelf and setting them on the desk. \"Fuck off, moron.\" Eli ignored the goosebumps on her arm as he smirked, blaming it on the air conditioning her parents always seemed to have running. \"Well, I would, but I don't think your parents would approve too much.\" Eli's usually calm features contorted in disgust at his comment, and she chose to associate the burning in her cheeks with her annoyance at the boy in front of her. \"You're disgusting. Let's just get this stupid paper over with.\" Marco withheld another teasing comment, and nodded his head in agreement. Rolling Allie's desk chair over to him and taking a seat, Eli grabbed the first book she had picked out and opened it to the front page. \"So, I figure, I can look through this book, you can read that one,\" she nodded her head towards the one that remained on her desk. \"and we can both take notes and stuff. We can compare them afterwards, and start working on the paper another time. That sound good, your highness?\" she snipped sarcastically. She was surprised when he did say anything back, just nodded his head and pulled the book into his lap, taking out a pen and notebook. Shaking off her surprise, she began to read. It was about two hours later when they both finished reading, pages filled with quickly scribbled notes. Eli slammed her book shut and threw it onto her bed, leaning back and cracking her neck. A satisfied sigh left her lips as Marco did the same, though he quietly set his book back onto the desk instead. After shutting her eyes for a moment, she leaned forward and craned her neck to see his notebook. \"Looks like you actually got some decent notes down. I'm almost impressed.\" The handsome teenager smirked at her comment, before examining her paper as well. \"Same to you. We might actually get a decent grade on this paper after all.\" \"Oh please,\" she scoffed as she placed the notebook onto her desk. \"I could bring in a few of my family's King Arthur books for Mr. Morse and he'd give us an A. The dude has a problem, I swear.\" We both burst into laughter for a few minutes. He actually had a nice laugh, Eli thought, before internally berating herself for the ridiculous thought. When they finally calmed down from their little laughing fit, they began to compile their notes onto one page. It was easy enough, considered they had written pretty much the same things, with only a few exceptions from either one. \"You know,\" Marco interrupted the silence a few minutes later. \"You're not as dumb as I though you'd be. Looks like I underestimated you.\" Eli rolled her eyes and smiled at him. \"Gee thanks. That almost sounded like a genuine compliment. I'm touched.\" sarcasm dripped from her tongue as he chuckled at her. Despite their mutual dislike for one another, they both admitted that they were actually having a relatively good time with one another. \"Just don't go falling in love with me now.\" He said, closing his eyes and relaxing against the back of his chair. At the sound of her boisterous laughter, he opened one of his eyes and watched her in amusement, a smirk ever present on his lips. Eli's head was thrown back and her hair tumbled down her back as she laughed, genuinely laughed, at his comment. She sighed and rubbed at her eyes once she had calmed down. A yawn escaped her rosy lips and as she stood from her seat. \"Well, I'd say we did a decent bit of work, so how about we call it quits for tonight?\" she inquired as she returned her books to their rightful place on the overcrowded shelf. Marco nodded and gave a hum of agreement as he stood and began to collect his things. She watched him in silence, taking a moment to observe the way he moved. She had been correct in her initial assessment of him, she thought. He was indeed attractive, although she'd never admit to that. When he had collected all of his materials, he chose not to comment on her gaze. He knew she had been watching him, and struggled to keep a smirk from gliding onto his face. He followed her out of the bedroom, and took the time to return the favor. Despite obviously being tired, her movements were graceful as she took long strides down the hall, her hips swaying from side to side. He appreciated the view, to say the least. After all, Marco was still a teenage boy. Eli pulled opened the door for him, and planned to shut it and return to her room without interruption. She was surprised when Marco paused in the doorway and turned back to her, leaning against the framework. \"So, when are we doing this again?\" he inquired lazily, his dark gaze had to look down at least half a foot to meet her own. Eli thought for a moment, going through her schedule in her head. Less than a minute later, she shrugged her shoulders. \"I'm free this Saturday, I think. That work for you?\" Marco let out a rather attractive groan. \"Will's having his stupid party on Saturday. But other than that, yeah, I'm free.\" Eli chose not to comment on his relationship with his brother. \"Then, how about we meet up there, and when you get tired of wreaking havoc, we can come back here and finish up the paper. That work?\" He thought it through and nodded his head, before an idea popped into his head. \"That almost sounds like a date to me, Ms. Pennington. You sure you don't like me?\" She scoffed and rolled her eyes, placing a hand on his chest and lightly pushing him out of the doorway. \"In your dreams.\" He sent her a flirtatious wink as he began to back away. \"Every night.\" She shook her head at Marco's antics, silently hoping for him to trip over a rock or something. \"Good night Marco.\" she mocked, starting to shut the door. \"Good night sweetheart!\" he shouted, causing her to pause for a second, before pulling the door shut with a satisfying click. The two teenagers were more alike than they knew. As they both grew further from the door, one beginning the trek home, and one preparing to flop into bed and pass out, they both sported pleased smirks on their faces. That is, until they fell asleep. ","Summary":" A/N: so in case you didn't notice, this is an Avalon High/Marco fanfiction. Warning, it probably su"},{"Movie":"Avalon High","Title":"Double Trouble","Author":"lyra swan","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10944241","Passage":"[Chapter 1] OK, so am I the only one who thought Marco was wayyy cuter than Will? I also thought that Allie was a bit odd, like some of her lines just sounded off, but that's just me. Anyway, since the canon ending didn't give anyone to Marco, I thought I'd give him someone to fall in love with. I awoke with a thump. Literally. \"Allie? Are you okay?\" I asked, peering down at my twin sister from my top bunk. \"Yeah, I'm all right.\" She groaned back. Just then our mother came rushing up the stairs, arms around a box full of, surprise, books. \"Are you all right girls? I heard a noise, an- \" she paused seeing Allie on the ground. \"What are you doing on the floor?\" \"I guess I fell out of bed.\" Allie replied. \"Didn't you used to do that all the time when you were like four?\" I questioned. \"Oh shut up, Ilah.\" She snapped back. \"Besides, I bet when I was four I wasn't dreaming about medieval combat.\" \"Well, as long as you two are up, you can unpack.\" Mom suggested. I responded with a heavy dose of sarcasm. \"Sure thing Mom! Want us to organize your books as well?\" As usual, she was completely ignorant, while Allie started laughing behind her back. \"Oh no sweetie. Don't worry, your father and I will handle the books.\" And with that she went back downstairs. \"God she's so oblivious.\" I sighed. \"Yeah, well we'll probably thank her for it later on down the road. Come on, let's get started.\" We had worked our way through about half of the boxes before we found the two smaller ones that contained all our school stuff. In each one there was a small, cream colored brochure for our new prison I mean school, Avalon High. Inside each brochure was a flyer for track and field tryouts. The flyer stated that tryouts would be held until 5 o'clock after the first day of the semester, and that all were welcome to try out. Allie and I looked at each other and rolled our eyes. We both love to run, and we each specialized in our own events, me in the sprints and her in the long distance, and we were really good. But, because the longest time we ever stayed one house was six months, it was obvious that even if we made the team, we wouldn't be around to see the end of the season. Allie passed me her flyer, and I crumpled them up and shot two three-pointers one after another into the trashcan. I sighed. \"I think I'm going to go downstairs and help them with the books\" \"Help or read?\" Allie shot back. \"Touché sister, but I have to make sure they haven't been holding out on me. The last one I read on Lancelot and Guinevere almost made me throw up from all the lovey-dovey stuff.\" \"I'll remember that when I married and you're an old cat lady\" \"Screw you!\" I huffed, as I left the room and headed down. Downstairs, it was obvious that the books had already made a permanent home for themselves; everywhere. \"All unpacked sweetie?\" My dad asked. \"Getting there,\" I replied. \"I see King Arthur and his Merry Men have once again taken over the house.\" \"It was Robin Hood who had the Mary Men, sweetie. Arthur had the Knights of the Round Table. You know that!\" \"Yes, I do. How could I not know that, when it's all you guys talk about?\" \"We're professors of medieval literature, Ilah. It's our job.\" Dad soothed. \"I know, I know, but you guys talk about King Arthur so much, I'm starting to dream about him. And not even like most girls who dream about knights in shining armor. Mine have dirt all over them, and BO, and are missing half their teeth.\" I replied. Dad paused, \"that's actually quite accurate. During Arthurian times, dental hygiene wasn't considered to be-\" \"Ew! Dad! Seriously?\" I cut him off as I hopped up on the counter. \"Well, I don't even know why we bothered to unpack. We're just going to move in six months, right? I mean which is great, I love always moving, like you always say once to live in one place right?\" They both fell silent. \"What?\" \"Well, \" Mom started. \"It's not going to be six months this time.\" She stopped, glanced dad, and then continued. \"Ilah, we're going to be here for three years. We were just offered contracts at the University, and this place is so…special. Now we know that three years is a long time, bu-\" \"Whoa, whoa, wait. So we're going to be at Avalon High until graduation? So we can be on the track team, and finish the season, and make actual friends?\" They nodded. \"Yes! Yes! Yes!\" So there's the first chapter! Let me know what you think, this is my first story ever, so please review but go easy. Thanks for reading! Cheers, CC P.S. you say her name like [Eye-luh][Chapter 2] This is one of my favorite Marco scenes. *squeals* What can I say, I think we all love bad boy Marco. XD After I told Allie the good news, she went for a run while I kept unpacking. When I was done, she still wasn't back, so I grabbed my journal and climbed onto the roof. I started writing down things I could tell people at our new school, things that would help them get to know me and tell us apart. I wrote about how even though we're twins, we're still two different people. People have always described Allie as good. I don't know if that means I'm bad, or just not good enough. But either way, I don't know who I am, and I am who I am, so that's enough for me. I put down that even though I love history, I absolutely hate school. And how I love to play the violin and draw, but Lord have mercy on anyone that tries to listen or look at my work without my permission (something I've never given anyone ). Even though I know exactly what I'm doing I usually struggle in other subjects. Even when I don't know what I'm doing usually if I go with my gut I get the right answers anyway. I talked about how I like dark colors, so people usually assume that I'm gone or just rebellious, even though I can be even good earlier than Allie. And I also tried to describe how alone I feel, even though I knew I would never share that anybody. The problem is I just feel sometimes like nobody, not even Allie really understands. The dreamer in me thinks I'm just waiting to meet my true love. The realist wants to know my straitjacket size. After Allie came back from her run she would not shut up about some guy she met at the water fountain. It's like that book I read all over again. God, I hope I never sound like that. The next day was our first day at Avalon High. After making sure Mom was to pick us up at five not three because of track tryouts, we walked into the building together. Immediately, there was a loud crash. Allie looked around the corner sighed. It must be a bully then. I looked around the corner and saw… And saw one of the cutest guys I have ever seen. That was great. The unfortunate part is that he was the bully. \"Marco, why can't you just feel my lunch money like every other bully? I need my locker!\" His victim appealed to him. \"What's wrong with yours?\" \"Well, Miles,\" Marco replied. \"Since you asked; mine's too far from class.\" Miles scoffed. \"You don't even go to class!\" \"Give me the combination.\" Marco demanded, slamming the rest of the books out of Miles's hands. \"That must've been what we heard before,\" I whispered to Allie. \"1-2-3-4-5\" Miles shot back. \"He's going to get himself killed!\" Allie whispered back. I hummed in agreement Marco slammed Miles against the lockers. \"Give it to me, Preschool, or all put you in the locker.\" \"Wow, nerd in a locker. How original!\" Miles mocked. \"We're now living inside an 80s teen movie.\" Just as Marco went to pick Miles, a voice from behind him called out \"That's enough, Marco!\" Marco rolled his eyes and turned to face the interrupter. \"Hooray! If it isn't Will Wagner here to save the day! My hero.\" He sneered. \"We are you gonna do, Will, hit me? \"You're not worth a detention.\" Will replied. \"Just get out of here, before I change my mind.\" Marco scoffed, but started to turn away before suddenly lunging at Miles. Will instantly threw himself in between the two boys and shoved Marco backwards, right into me. I tried not to look like a tomato as he righted himself. He moved back towards Will until they were face-to-face, before smirking and letting out a simple \"Whatever,\" Marco then faced Miles and stated with a dark tone, \"He can't protect you 24 hours a day.\" before loping away. The strange thing was, as he passed me I could've sworn I heard him mutter a low \"sorry\", but when I looked up, his eyes held absolutely no emotion. As Marco turned the corner, Miles yelled after him, \"Oh, wow, you know that there are 24 hours in a day? You must be evolving!\" I watched him he walked down the hall. It was wildly contrasting, for he held himself straight and tall, with an arrogant yet self-assured confidence, but at the same time he curled his shoulders inward just slightly, as if trying to protect himself. It was an odd concept, but yet just as intriguing as he was. I was actually very pleased with myself for noticing. \"Thanks Will.\" Miles murmured \"I was worried I was going to have to, as they say 'throw down' with them, but when I saw you coming I thought you might want to deal with him yourself, since she's your brother.\" \"Step-brother\" Will corrected under his breath. He then looked over Miles' shoulder - right at us. Or more specifically right at me; Allie had disappeared around the corner. I scurried after her with him following, shouting for me to wait up. I caught up with Allie right by her locker, and was about to demand to know why she pulled the disappearing act, when behind me Will called out \"Hey! Water Fountain Girl!\" Oh, so THAT'S why she wanted to avoid him Allie sent me a look, saying that if I didn't scram now, I was going to regret it later. \"Oh, hey, it's Will, right?\" she said to him as I ducked around her to get to my locker. \"Yeah. Hey, I didn't know you went Avalon.\" \"Well, I didn't know you go here either. Although, technically, I don't know anyone who goes here. I'm new. I mean my name's not 'New', it's Allie.\" He laughs, shaking her hand as I roll my eyes at her disjointed introduction. \"Well, it's very nice to meet you Allie. And I assume this is your sister?\" he asks, reaching for my hand. OK Ilah, be cool. First day, new school, new people, fresh start. Don't screw it up. \"Hi, I'm Ilah.\" I say, shaking his hand before turning back to my locker. \"There,\" Will says to Allie. \"Now you officially know one person.\" \"Yeah,\" I comment as I lean around my locker door. \"You're practically Homecoming Queen.\" \"Ilah!\" Allie hisses. I roll my eyes and turn back to my locker, mentally chiding myself for not thinking before I speak. \"So, are you on the track team?\" Allie asks Will. \"You know, because of the running in the park. Or maybe you just like running. I love running. We love running. Will laughs, \"Football, actually. I'm kinda the quarterback.\" 'Course he is. I think to myself. Cue head cheerleader. All of a sudden a girl with strawberry blonde hair bounces over to Will, and with a quick \"Hey, sweetie!\" Gives him a nice kiss on the cheek. There she is. Will introduces her as Jen, commenting on how our friends have already doubled, before introducing us to his best friend Lance, surprise, is also on the football team. I don't know how perceptive will is, but I think pretty clear that Jen and Lance have feelings for each other, so just as I ponder why she's dating will, I suddenly realize that they are showing us to our first-period class, European History with Mr. Moore. So here's the second chapter. I'm trying to do these very fast because the movie is only available to me till tomorrow, and i like to check it to make sure I'm getting the right dialogue. Let me know what you think! Cheers, CC[Chapter 3] When we walked to class, the first thing that struck me was the loud voice at the front of the room blurting \"William!\" I assumed it was our teacher, Mr. Moore. \"Rumor has it you're going to lead Avalon Football to State for the first time this year.\" Mr. Moore continued. \"That's the plan Sir.\" Will replied as a few other boys with letterman jackets slapped him on the back. \"That's my boy!\" Mr. Moore exclaimed. \"Class president, Homecoming King, straight A-student,\" he went on. Turning around to catch Marco slinking past behind him to grab a book, Mr. Moore decided to add one more attribute to the list, aiming it directly at Marco. \" And he's polite! If only I had an entire class of Will Wagner's.\" He finished turning towards Allie and I. \"Oh, I think I'm going to puke!\" Marco called back, heading for a seat at the very back of the room. When he was about halfway there, he turned back around and caught my eye. After giving me a once over, he scowled and spat out \"What are you looking?\" Me being myself I instantly feigned innocence before replying with a pitying \"Nothing pretty. Find a mirror and you'll see what I mean.\" *** He just glowered at me, and went to go sulk at the back of the room, giving me another dirty look once he reached his seat. Mr. Moore handed us our books, and I followed Allie trying to find a seat, when all of the sudden she stopped walking and started laughing. I looked down at the book and then started laughing too. \"I'm sorry, is there a problem, Miss…?\" Mr. Moore asked. \"Pennington. Allie and Ilah Pennington?\" Allie said. \"Ah!\" Mr. Moore started laughing. \"Well then, that explains everything! Everyone, please welcome Avalon High's newest students, Allie and Ilah Pennington. Their parents are professors of medieval literature at the University, and they also wrote the textbook we'll be using this semester, when we learn about King Arthur and his court.\" From the middle of the room, Lance faked a cough before muttering a dry \"Easy A!\" making everyone laugh. Mr. Moore then repeated it back at him with a \"Nobody asked you!\" By that time, the only seats left were the ones at the very back of the room. Allie picked the one next to Miles, the kid from this morning who was getting bullied, but I got to sit behind him next to Marco, the kid who was doing the bullying. Lucky me. I thought to myself as I sat down and put my backpack on the floor. In front of me Miles was trying to tell Allie how big of a mistake she was making by talking to him. \"You had a great start!\" He reasoned. \"I saw you talking to Captain Everything this morning. You have a chance to be in the popular group. Don't mess it up.\" She laughed. \"I can be friends with whoever I want. Including you. Including you.\" \"Uh, who said I wanted to be your friend?\" Miles sassed \"You\" she replied. \"No, I didn't.\" He retorted. \"Then why are you still talking to us?\" I interjected. From the corner of my eye I saw Marco had turned slightly towards us, as if he were listening to our conversation. \"But I'm not.\" Miles responded. \"Ah, but by saying you're not, you are.\" I countered. Miles struggled for a few seconds to come up with an answer, but found himself beaten and slumped in his desk. \"Check…\" Allie started. \"and mate.\" I finished. I heard a snicker come from my left, but when I looked Marco was not paying attention at all, faced straight ahead, and completely ignoring everyone. Oh this is going to be a long year. At the front of room, Mr. Moore started ringing a tiny bell. \"Okay, first thing we're going to do is break up into teams to write research papers. You're going to be drawing your topics out of a hat, or in this case a helmet.\" He said, pulling out the helmet off a suit of armor. The first group was two kids I didn't know, and they got the architecture of Camelot. Next, Moore paired Will with some girl, even though he clearly wanted to be with Jen. They got the sports of Camelot. Jen, who was working with Lance, picked the tragedy of Camelot. Their paper was to be on the love triangle between King Arthur, Queen Guinevere, and Sir Lancelot. In that book I had read, it said that the triangle ultimately destroyed Arthur and Camelot itself along with him. I couldn't help but wonder Mr. Moore had a sick sense of humor, and had somehow rigged the drawing. Next was Miles and Allie. \"I'd rather work alone.\" Miles protested. \"And I'd rather be eating pineapple on a beach in Hawaii,\" Mr. Moore retaliated, \"but that's not going to happen either.\" Allie picked the Order of the Bear. I've never heard of that I thought to myself. I heard a sharp intake of breath beside me, and when I snuck a peek at Marco, he was staring directly at Allie, with his hands clasped together, eyebrows furrowed and jaw clenched. I couldn't tell what was wrong with him. I don't know if he was upset because she had gotten it and he hadn't (assuming he'd wanted it) or if he was just trying not to laugh because she looked so confused. Next came me and you know who on my left. \"Alright Ilah, you're with Marco. Pick.\" I shuffled around for a bit before pulling out a strip of paper, unfolding it and holding it up for him to see. \"The Story of Mordred,\" Mr. Moore read. \"Oh that's a good one. Your paper will tell of Mordred's specific role in the downfall of Camelot. Joy. Really. I sighed, pulling out a sheet of paper to write down my phone number, email address, and home address, so Marco would be able to contact me while we worked on our project. You know, I thought to my self as I folded the Story of Mordred paper into a crane, I don't particularly relish the thought of him having my personal information like this, even if it is just to get a paper done. By the time the rest of the class had finished picking, my contact information had followed the Mordred slip into another crane, along with two more made out of a spare notebook sheet I'd ripped in half. When class ended, I dropped the one with my info on his desk, and then walked out without another word. He didn't say anything, and I didn't look back. *** OK, so the comeback I had earlier was literal crap, and thank you all for the suggestions. I like this one a lot better. Shoutout/Credit to DeathScythe16 for the inspiration. Thanks mate. Hope you enjoy. Thanks for reading! Cheers CC[Chapter 4] So this one's kinda short, but like I said last chapter, I loose the movie after tomorrow, so I'm kinda trying ta crank em all out before tomorrow, but that's clearly not going to happen. I'll tell you why later. For now, the story... After school were track tryouts. First we stretched a bit, and then we started jogging. The try-out was a 400 yard sprint, and the first 3 girls would make the team. The whole time we doing this, I felt a familiar presence nearby. Someone was definitely watching us. At first I thought it was just the male track runners, or the football players. The longer I felt it, the more familiar seemed. I know whoever it was had to be someone I knew, someone I'd been close to recently. But I'd been through over half a dozen classes that day. I'd been close to a million people! I tried to forget about it and just focus on running. \"All right!\" The coach yelled. \"Go to your marks!\" I was in the second lane, right next to Allie. \"Good luck\" I said as I passed her. \"You too, Ilah!\" she replied. I fixed the blocks, got into position, and waited for the gun. As I did, I felt that presence again, and I looked up into the stands to try and pinpoint it. The next thing I know, the gun's gone off, the other girls including Allie are already reaching the first turn, and like an idiot I'm still at my mark! I took off as fast as I could. *** Rounding the last corner, I pushed with everything I had left, flying across the line neck and neck with Allie. The coaches congratulated us, and told us those were two of the fastest 400s they'd seen in years, and they'd love to see it again with proper starts from both of us. Huh. I guess I wasn't the only one who was distracted. Now, speaking of distractions, where's the person… My trail of thought died as up at the very top of the stands, I saw the black flap of someone's jacket for about half a second, before it whipped around the corner and into the boy's locker room. Black, black. Who do I know who wears… oh no. No, no, no. Seeing that color combined with the presence, I realized why is felt so familiar, it was the same one I'd felt this morning in the hall, just before I officially met Will, the seemingly egotistical yet quietly assuring confidence. It was the same one I'd be feeling all year long, emanating from the left, in Mr. Moore's European History class. Great. Now he's stalking me. That night, Mom and Dad took us out to a restaurant to celebrate. \"I'm so proud of you girls.\" Mom beamed at us. I sighed. \"Yeah, I'm pretty proud of us too.\" I grinned, sliding my arm across Allie's shoulders and pulling her into a one-armed hug. \"This is gonna be a great year for us. I can feel it.\" Allie announced, flashing me a huge smile. Not if Marco keeps this up. I thought. But tonight wasn't about him. For now, it was just about us. *** insert the running scene from the movie here, with a couple of differences. Ilah has bright green eyes, a purple shirt, and is wearing a bra! Seriously! How did they miss that! So the reason I won't get this done today is because I mapped out how I want the story to go, and the plan gives me 18 chapters. I was thinking about trying to write all through the night, not necessarily posting, just writing, but I have a birthday party tomorrow and a hockey game tomorrow night, not to mention school starts again for me on Monday, and my mom wants me to try and get back on my normal sleeping schedule. I'll write as late as I can tonight, and hopefully post a little more soon. Thanks for reading, be sure to review! Cheers, CC[Chapter 5] OK, wow, it's been a while. But the story must go on! Quick note, I've made a few small changes to the previous chapters, just little details here and there. they're not really that important to the story [well, not yet ;)] But, if you want to get to know Ilah's character a little better, I suggest going back and re-reading, if only to refresh your memory because it's been so long . GAHH I HATE ME TOO! Finally, Ilah and Marco get to be alone! ;) This chapter comes mostly from my own imagination, seeing as how there is no such scene in the movie because Ilah doesn't exist! Enjoy! I can't believe I'm actually doing this. That's the only thought I have in my mind as I ring Marco's doorbell. I'm also desperately wishing that I'd asked Mom and Dad for a little help before agreeing to do this. A little help from them and I'd have the entire paper written in my head before we even sat down. God dammit, why'd I have to be born so stubborn? I hear the lock turn, pulling my focus out of the clouds and onto Marco opening the front door. He gives me a quick once over and pulls a face. 'All right,\" he sighs. \"Let's get this over with.\" He turns away from me and ambles deeper into the house, leaving me to step in and close the door on my own before following him to the living room. As I walk through the house, I can't help but marvel at how uncluttered it is. Due to the fact that my family is constantly moving, we've never actually taken the time to make our house a home. Our usual strategy is merely to unpack the books, find a space to set them down, and then make life happen around them. However, that's apparently not the case in every household. Marco flopped down on the sofa, and lazily watched me taking in my new surroundings. \"So are we going to actually work, or are you just going to stand there all afternoon?\" he inquired. I shot him a withering look and answered his question in the form of action, sitting myself down cross-legged on the floor across the coffee table from him. I pulled out my notebook, where I'd already scribbled down a few ideas while Mr. Moore had finished pairing up the rest of the class. \"See you've started.\" Marco huffed. \"See you haven't!\" I retorted, gesturing toward his blank page on the table.* \"We've got like three weeks until this thing's due; why on Earth are we doing it now?\" he whined. I sighed. \"Because I know you don't want to spend any more time with me than absolutely necessary, so I figure that it's better to tolerate each other for a few hours and get it out of the way now instead of spending two and a half weeks dreading it then waiting till the absolute last minute and doing a crappy job.\" That's pretty good reasoning…right? He was sitting up now, listening very intently with a very conflicted look on his face. Aww crap. Why did I have to say that? Me and my big mouth! Stupid stupid stupid… I could feel my face getting redder with every moment of silence. \"Is that really how you think I feel, that I just hate everyone? That I… hate you ?\" he asked softly. I looked up at him from my place on the floor, but he refused to meet my eyes. I furrowed my eyebrows, confused. Well, this isn't exactly the reaction I was expecting, but I guess it's better than him getting angry. \"Well- I mean-\" I floundered for a few seconds, trying to find the right way to put it. \"That's kinda how you act…\" I trailed off, not exactly sure if I was helping or hurting. All of a sudden, his entire demeanor took a 180, his spine stiffening, and his eyes and mouth hardening. \"Good. Maybe everyone else'll finally cue in.\" Wow. OK. I didn't know why, but his declaration felt like a punch in the gut. Or, maybe that was just me wanting to punch him -in the face. Just as I was about to open my big mouth again (I should really look into super-gluing it shut), the sound of a door opening somewhere else in the house caused Marco to groan and slump down on the couch. \"Marco? Where are you?\" a friendly female voice sounded. \"Can you come help me get the bags out of the car?\" Ohmygod his MOM is home! I started panicking. Wait; why am I freaking out? We are working on a paper - kinda! It's not like we were... Whoa, where did THAT come from? Don't even go there. She came around the corner just then, a shorter, cheerful looking women, her chestnut hair threaded with grey and warm brown eyes giving no indication of any shared biology with her son. If he looks nothing like her, he must be the spitting image of his father, I mused. \"Lillian Wagner,\" she greeted me, transferring a few of the bags of groceries in her arms to Marco's so she could extend her hand to me. \"nice to meet you\" \"Ilah Pennington,\" I replied. \"you have a lovely home.\" I saw Marco's eyebrows go up behind her, like he was trying not laugh. I restrained my self from snapping at him, but his mother turned and gave him a look that said she knew exactly what he'd been doing. I like this woman. \"So,\" she continued, taking the bags back from Marco and heading into the kitchen. \"what are you two up to this afternoon?\" \"We're just working on a paper Mom.\" Marco grumbled at her, collapsing back onto the sofa. Well you don't have to sound so tortured about it, I thought. I'm not exactly having the time of my life here either. \"Well, if you'd like a break,\" she replied, taking her son's grumpy attitude in stride. \"you can help me put things away and get started on dinner, and then you can take another one in about an hour to eat.\" she said, before turning to me and adding, \"My husband is on a business trip at the moment, and Will went out running and most likely won't be back till late, so it'll just be the three of us for dinner. I hope you like chili, Ilah.\" Three hours later, the sun is starting to go down, and while some progress has been made on our paper, we are still no where close to being done. It's about this time that I look up to find that Marco has drifted off to dreamland in the middle of looking up the approximate dates of Mordred's birth and death. Un-fricking-believable I think to my self, going over to take the computer off of his lap. He doesn't even move. I roll my eyes, but figure that if he's gonna take a break, then I may as well too. I log onto my Pandora, and pull up my Irish rock band station. I had stumbled across the genre while going through a U2 phase in seventh grade, and thought of it as the greatest thing since sliced bread ever since. There was just such a personal connection sharp contrast between the elegant tenderness of the violins and flutes and the harsh drumbeats and electric guitar. I think that's part of why I stopped taking piano lessons with Allie, and started teaching myself to play violin instead. Without even thinking, I flip to a fresh page of notebook paper, and begin to draw, losing myself in the music and the picture. Next thing I know, Will comes breezing through the living room to go upstairs. I didn't even hear him come in. Wait a minute. Mrs. Wagner said he wouldn't be back till late. What is he doing home? I check the window, then my watch. Holy Schist, it's almost 9:30 and it's COMPLETLY DARK OUTSIDE!** I start scrambling to pack up my stuff, and only then do I notice that Marco is awake. In my defense, he not very active about it. Only his dark eyes move, following me around the room as I search for my crap. \"So,\" I say awkwardly, just to say something to break the silence. \"we didn't really get that much done today, so do you want to meet again tomorrow during lunch, or after school again, or...\" I'm babbling, and we both know it, so I trail off as he gracefully rises from his chair and wanders over to me, hands in his pockets. His eyes haven't left mine the entire time, even now as he finally responds. \"You should probably get home.\" I'm going to kill him. *Yes I did just make a Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone reference. So sue me. **And yes, that was a Percy Jackson: Son of Neptune reference. I'm a nerd, it just can't be helped. *shrugs* WOW long time off. Yeah. I... have no good reasons. I don't want to make half-assed excuses to you guys. Life just happened, I guess. Anyway, more important things to discuss. Since, after all, this story is for you guys, I want to get your thoughts on a couple points that I'm wavering on. 1. My chapter names kinda have a theme going; they all end in -ing. The last one was called Winning, but I can't decide if I want to call this one Losing or Gaining. Read through, and let me know. 2. I gave Ilah the lead in with the drawing and music, and I'm wondering if her powers should somehow stem from that? Miles doesn't really have any specific vein for his in the movie, but I kinda want Ilah's to be different? Let me know if I should stick with just powers, or use music or art or both or something else or whatever! As always, any questions, comments, or criticisms are greatly appreciated and will hopefully be addressed swiftly and accurately. Thanks for reading! Cheers, CC P.S. That whole \"cheers\" thing, is paying homage (kinda) to one of my favorite authors on , tears-in-rain ! Her stories are amazing, and you should all go check her out!

The only thing I own is the plot, and the name of Will's dad, since they never said anything about him or what had happened to him. I also own my oc character named Emily Parker who will come into play very soon in the story. Everything Cloud 9 related, except for Will's dad and my oc character all belongs to Disney Channel.

Chapter 1 - One Year Later...Tragedy strikes twice {Will's POV} I tossed and turned as another sleepless night took it's hold on me. It was the same dream I had been having for weeks now. It was of my dad being killed in a snowboarding accident. The accident happened ten years ago, when I was six years old, the very first time I ever fell in love with snowboarding. It was also the very first time I had ever been to a Fire & Ice competition, only not as a competitor, but as part of the audience. I held my breath in anticipation as I waited to see dad's tricks as he came off the ramp and flew into the sky. It was then that I saw him perform his signature move, the Cloud 9. As I watched him flip through the air, Something was wrong. His rotation was too close from the slope. I gasped and whispered, \"No.\" as I saw his board touch the top of the pipe, and he lost his balance. It seemed as if time had slowed down for an eternity, before he finally fell to the ground, with his back being the first thing to hit the ground. His left knee was twisted under his weight and he couldn't breath anymore. \"Dad!\" I shouted in horror as I rushed from my seat toward him, with mom not far behind me. \"Will, honey get back here!\" I heard her cry out, but I didn't stop. \"Please be okay dad.\" I whispered as my heart slowed into my chest. By the time I had reached dad, there was already a large crowd circling around him, and paramedics were already loading him onto a stretcher. \"Wait! stop!\" I shouted. \"Is he going to be okay?! Dad!\" The next thing I remembered was mom pulling me close to her, and I cried on her shoulder hugging her tightly as we waited for the ambulance. As I sat in the waiting room waiting for news on dad with my heart pounding in my chest, I suddenly overheard the doctor explaining to mom of dad's condition. \"I'm sorry Mrs. Cloud, his internal injuries are much too severe.\" He said quietly. \"When his back hit the slope, it caused one of his lungs to collapse. We'll do everything we can, but it may not be enough. I'm sorry.\" I could hear mom quietly sobbing, and felt tears brimming to my own eyes. No. I thought sadly. Not dad. The scene of the dream changed and the next thing I saw was me standing beside mom glancing at dad's casket with tears running down my cheeks. \"It's just you and me now Will.\" Mom said choking back her sobs and she pulled me close into a hug. Suddenly I could hear the dogs below barking up a storm, and then felt something heavy jump onto my chest, which woke me up with a jolt. \"Donald!\" I cried out in alarm, catching a glimpse of his big saucer-shaped brown eyes. \"Sheesh, you trying to give me a heart attack boy? what's gotten into you?\" Donald barked, and leaped off of me and ran down the hall. \"Will honey! let's go!\" mom called from downstairs. \"Don't you have to go and meet Kayla?\" Suddenly my eyes snapped open in alarm. I completely forgot about Kayla! I dashed out of bed and quickly got dressed, then headed down the stairs to find mom feeding the dogs in their kennels. \"Bye mom! I'll be back later!\" I called as I headed out the door. {PAGE BREAK!} I met Kayla practicing her moves on the slope. She was amazing! I watched as she caught some air coming off the ramp, and fliped through the air in a backflip motion before landing gracefully on the snow like a snowy angel. Her blonde hair shimmered in the afternoon sunlight as she pulled off her goggles, and smiled as she saw me. \"Hey! did you see my run?\" she asked excitingly. \"Yeah, you were amazing!\" I said with a smile as she gave me a quick kiss on the cheek. \"Hey are you okay?\" she asked obviously noticing the look on my face that I was trying to hide. \"Yeah,\" I replied quickly looking away from her. \"I'm fine.\" \"Hey, your obviously not okay.\" She said as she pulled me close to her, which forced me to look at her. \"What's wrong?\" I drew in a shaky breath as I fought back the tears that threatened to fall from my hazel eyes. \"I didn't create the Cloud 9 move.\" I said shakily. \"My dad was the one who created it originally before he-\" I stopped myself as I felt tears falling down my cheeks, and I quickly brushed them away with the sleeve of my jacket. \"Will, it's okay. Please talk to me.\" Kayla said softly. \"Don't shut me out please.\" \"Forget it.\" I said chocking back a sob as I moved away from her. \"Will!\" Kayla cried out as she ran to catch up with me. I could hear her footsteps crunching rapidly in the snow as she ran. \"Will please! talk to me!\" She cried out. \"Don't shut me out! Tell me what's wrong! Will!\" I stopped and felt my heart racing in my chest as I chocked back sobs, as I turned to look at her. \"You want to know the real reason why I lost my focus during the competition? The real reason why I crashed and nearly died? It's because the last Fire & Ice competition was on January 11th. The same day my dad died.\" I looked at Kayla and could immediately see the hurt in her green eyes. \"Will I- I'm so sorry.\" She said sadly. \"I- I didn't know.\" I drew in a heavy sigh and walked away from her again, but she grabbed my arm, and turned me around to face her. \"Is that why you didn't want to teach me the Cloud 9?\" she asked. \"Because of your dad?\" I nodded and drew in a shaky breath. \"I didn't want you to end up like he did.\" I said softly. \"I didn't want to lose you.\" {PAGE BREAK!} \"Why didn't you just say so in the first place?\" She asked, as she leaned her face close to mine. The kiss caught me completely by surprise, as I kissed her back not pulling away from her. Having her arms around me, just having her near me made me feel a lot better. \"Well, Well, if it isn't everyone's favorite little daddy's girl.\" Both Kayla and I both turned our heads in annoyance, and we saw Sebastian Swift walking up to us, with his son Nick not far behind looking slightly annoyed and slightly defeated, almost like he didn't want to do something. \"What do you want now Sebastian?\" Kayla asked obviously getting slightly defensive. \"Me? nothing. I just wanted to propose something to you Mr. Cloud.\" \"Me?\" I asked, as my emotions began to change from sad and depressed to slightly annoyed. \"My son Nick wants to challenge you in race down Tyson's Peak.\" He said, as Nick looked up at me. \"The one snowboarder who can do the most successful tricks while riding down the mountain of course will win Kayla.\" \"Excuse me?\" Kayla asked defensively. \"No offense Sebastian, but last time I checked, Nick and I were over, as with me joining Team Swift, and also, Nick's dating Skye. He doesn't need me anymore.\" Just at that moment, Nick walked up to us looking apologetically. \"Kayla, I only dumped you because my dad wanted me to. I never truly loved Skye. You have been the one person I have only ever truly cared about.\" I rolled my eyes in annoyance, just as Kayla said, \"Well it's a little late for you to be telling me this now isn't it? How do I know your not going to try and trick me again for your dad?\" \"I swear Kayla! this is me talking. Not him. I swear I won't ever hurt you like that again.\" I gasped and felt a surge of anger flare up within me as I watched Nick pull Kayla close to him, and they kissed! {PAGE BREAK!} I growled and shoved Nick away from Kayla making him land in the snow hard. \"You want a race?\" I asked angrily. \"Fine! you've got one!\" After that I stormed off as another surge of anger flared up within me. The nerve of that jerk! How dare he do this to Kayla! She doesn't deserve him! She deserves so much better then that little rat! \"Will!\" I turned and saw Kayla rushing up to me. \"Are you crazy?!\" She cried out. \"You can't slide down Tyson's Peak remember what happened to me last year? I almost got buried alive by an avalanche. It's too dangerous.\" \"That jerk needs to pay once and for all!\" I growled. \"He's just trying to psyche you out!\" Kayla cried. \"He's trying to egg you on into racing just so you'll get hurt again. Please Will don't do this!\" \"Don't worry, I'll be fine.\" I reassured her. \"I know I can beat him.\" TYSON'S PEAK I could feel my heart pounding in my chest as I glanced down the mountain, then back over at Nick, who seemed very calm and collected. I drew in a deep breath, and muttered under my breath, \"Come on Will, you can do this. You cannot let this jerk win!\" Sebastian Swift gave us the okay, and I shoved off with my board, immediately catching up with Nick as we jumped off the first ledge, and I grabbed the side of my board in the air before I began to descend. I let out a breath that I didn't realize that I was holding, as I landed and continued down the mountain. Piece of cake! I thought triumphedly. As I flew through the air off the second ledge of the mountain, I suddenly heard a crackling sound so loud that it sounded like a gunshot. I looked behind me just in time to see an avalanche spilling out behind me as I landed. \"Will!\" I heard Kayla scream out over the roaring avalanche. I made my jump off the third ledge of the mountain but suddenly lost my footing as I landed and now began tumbling down the mountain with the avalanche not far behind me. Waves of pain shot through me and I immediately blacked out. The last thing I remembered before the avalanche buried me, was Kayla screaming my name in horror. \"WILL!\" To be continued...What does everyone think of this so far? I hope everyone likes it and wants to know more, becasue I do plan on writing more for this story, but I wanted to get everyone's opion on what they think first. I loved the movie Cloud 9 and loved the chemistry between Will and Kayla. So much better of a couple then Kayla and Nick was seeing as how even though Nick treated Kayla poorly and even though he apologised to her at the end of the movie, he was still following daddy's orders and in my opinon, that kind of guy who does that escpecially for his own father over his girlfriend isn't worth it. Anyway better get to work on chapter 2 before I start to ramble. hope everyone enjoyed the first chapter and as I said before, Please review and commet, but if you have nothing nice to say, then please do not say anything at all.[Chapter 2] I do not own the Movie Cloud 9 or the characters.

Waves of pain shot through me and I immediatly blacked out. The last thing I remembered before the avalnache buried me, was Kayla screaming my name in horror. \"WILL!\" NOW... Chapter 2 - Won't go down without a fight {Kayla's POV} Tears filled up within my eyes as I chocked back sobs while crying on my mom's shoulder as we waited in the Emergency Room of Summit Valley General Hospital. \"Don't worry baby, I'm sure everything's going to be okay.\" Mom said gently rubbing small circles on my back comfortingly. \"Will's going to be okay.\" \"It's all my fault.\" I sobbed, \"I should've done more to stop him!\" I said miserably not even caring that my mascara was running all over my face now. \"Will's hurt because of me mom! It's all my fault!\" \"Shh, it's okay baby.\" Mom said soothingly. \"It's okay calm down.\" I heard footsteps coming from down the hall toward us, and looked up as I saw my dad approach us. \"What did the doctor's say daddy? Is Will going to be okay?!\" The moment I saw the look in my dad's eyes that everything wasn't fine, I felt tears threatening to fall from my eyes again, and felt the urge to break down. \"It doesn't look good sweetie.\" Dad said softly. \"Will's in pretty bad shape. He's got at least three broken ribs, a fractured collarbone in his left arm, a hairline fracture in one of his legs, and one of his lungs collapsed.\" I buried my face into my hands and began crying again. \"Daddy it's all my fault.\" I sobbed. \"Will wouldn't be in this mess if it wasn't for me.\" \"Calm down sweetie.\" Dad said gently hugging me. \"This wasn't your fault. There was nothing you could do to stop the avalanche.\" I pulled away from my dad just as I saw Will's mom Andrea walk briskly into the emergency room with tears running down her face from her brown eyes. \"Where is he? She asked worriedly as she approached us. \"Is he okay? Where's my son?\" {PAGE BREAK!} While dad talked to Andrea to inform her of Will's condition, I found my opportunity to sneak of down the hall. I had to find Will's room. I had to see him. As I walked, I could see several nurses walking and keeping their eyes locked on the charts in their hands. To busy to notice. I thought fighting back the tears that stung in my eyes. Suddenly I heard someone in another room cough loudly which startled me, causing me to bump into someone. I looked up through teary eyes and saw a middle-aged man, with white hair, and grey-blue eyes wearing a doctor's uniform. \"Are you lost here little lady?\" He asked in an well mannered elderly tone. \"N-no I'm n-not lost.\" I said stammering a little on my words while chocking back sobs. \"I was actually looking for someone. Do you know where Will Cloud's room is by any chance?\" \"Are you a family member?\" The kind doctor asked. I was about to answer with the truth and tell him, 'No I'm not, I'm his girlfriend.' However if I told him the truth I knew they probably wouldn't let me into see him, so I decided to tell a little white lie instead. \"I'm uh-\" I hesitated for moment, before finally saying, \"I'm Will's sister, Kayla.\" \"Well then, it's a pleasure to meet you Miss Cloud,\" The doctor said as if he was speaking to royalty. \"I am Doctor Nicolai, and I think I can help you.\" I let out a huge sigh of relief and followed the kind doctor down the long hallway. \"So what happened to your brother?\" He asked. \"Was he involved in some sort of gang violence gone wrong?\" I felt my breath catch in my throat, and felt my heart stop as tears sprang to my eyes again and threatened to fall down my cheeks. The memory of Will boarding down Tyson's Peak with the icy avalanche trailing behind him suddenly replayed itself over in my mind like a movie being placed on rewind. \"It was a snowboarding accident.\" I said trying not to break down in tears again. \"I'm so sorry.\" Doctor Nicolai said comfortingly. \"Don't worry, I'm sure you're brother will be just fine.\" \"Thanks.\" I said, whipping tears away with the sleeve of my pink jacket. Suddenly an alarm rang over our heads, followed by a female robotic voice that called out over the hospital intercom, \"Code Blue! Code Blue!\" \"What's happening?\" I asked as a wave of both panic and fear settled in the pit of my stomach. \"One of the patients must be on the verge of slipping away.\" Doctor Nicolai said sadly as the alarm began to die down. Several doctors and nurses rushed past us, and Doctor Nicolai managed to stop one of the nurses in her tracks to figure out which Patient had the code blue alarm. \"It's the one in room 25.\" She said nearly breathless. \"Will Cloud.\" At that moment my heart sank low into my chest, and for a minute I felt myself nearly ready to pass out as I took off running down the hall, not caring if I was going to get in trouble. Will needs me. I thought. I reached room 25, and immediately burst into tears as I saw several doctors and nurses working on Will trying to get him stabilized. Oh god! I thought feeling terrified. No! Come on Will! don't do this to me! \"He's not responding doctor!\" one of the nurses cried out, which only amplified my fear even more. \"Come on Will.\" I found myself muttering trying to silently get through to him. \"Nothing's impossible. No doubt. No fear. Come on Will please don't die on me. I need you.\" I found myself trying not to cry but could feel the tears running down my cheeks. \"Please don't leave me. I- I love you.\" \"We're loosing him!\" One of the doctor's cried out. I sank to my knees and huddled myself near the wall facing the room, and cried. I have never felt as helpless as I did just now. Will was dying, and there was nothing I could do to help him. What was I going to do if I never got the chance to really tell him how I truly felt? {PAGE BREAK!} {Inside Will's Mind} I found myself floating. Floating peacefully, as I suddenly looked down at my body, as I saw doctors and nurse trying to revive me. Am I dead? I thought, looking down, I realized that I was see-through. Oh man! I'm a freaking spirit! I really am dead! What I am I going to do? I heard crying through all the chaos, and looked outside of the room to see Kayla crying, and huddled up with her knees up to her chest. \"Please be okay Will.\" I heard her voice racking with sobs. \"Please be okay. I can't loose my first love.\" \"We're loosing him!\" One of the doctor's cry out again as I felt a huge jolt of pressure shoot through me. \"Charge the paddles again!\" one of the nurses called out. \"We're not losing this kid now! come on kid! fight!\" I can't die yet. I thought. I still have a life here. I have my mom, and Donald, and Kayla. I can't give up yet. {Kayla's POV} \"Charge the paddles again!\" One of the nurse cried out. I heard another jolt of electric current, then suddenly, I thought I was hallucinating at first, but I then I heard it again as the room got quiet. It was faint, but it was steady heart rhythm. My own heart nearly jumped out of my chest and I scrambled to my feet and burst into the room, with tears still running down my face. \"Will! Will, say something can you hear me? It's me Kayla.\" at first there is nothing but silence, while two middle-aged doctors suddenly grab me by the shoulders and begin to drag me out of the room. \"How did you get in here?\" one of the doctors asked. I was about to answer, until I heard something that made my heart jump for joy. \"N-n-no-th-ing's i-im-p-oss-ible...N-n-no doubt...N-n-no fear.\" I felt tears flowing into my eyes and run down my cheeks again. It was very faint, but I knew it was Will's voice. Will's okay! Too be continued... Chapter 3 coming soon, with Nick and his dad. Did they possibly plan for this to happen to Will? Wait for Chapter 3 to find out.[Chapter 3] I do not own the Movie Cloud 9 or the characters. The only thing I own is the plot, and the name of Will's dad, since they never said anything about him or what had happened to him. I also own my oc character named Emily Parker who will come into play very soon in the story. Everything Cloud 9 related, except for Will's dad and my oc character all belongs to Disney Channel.

Author's Note2: Yay! This story is finally back! I know it's been at least a year since I last worked on it, but I figured it was time to work on it again since I watched the movie again. I will try to continue with this as much as I can so I hope you all, that have already read this will still enjoy reading. Previously on Cloud 9: Nothing's Impossible: \"What did the doctor's say daddy? Is Will going to be okay?!\" The moment I saw the look in my dad's eyes that everything wasn't fine, I felt tears threatning to fall from my eyes again, and felt the urge to break down. \"It dosen't look good sweetie.\" Dad said softly. \"Will's in pretty bad shape.

My own heart nearly jumped out of my chest and I scrambled to my feet and burst into the room, with tears still running down my face. \"Will! Will, say something can you hear me? It's me Kayla.\" \"N-n-no-th-ing's i-im-p-oss-ible...N-n-no doubt...N-n-no fear.\" I felt tears flowing into my eyes and run down my cheecks again. It was very faint, but I knew it was Will's voice. Will's okay! NOW... Chapter 3 -Don't Give up, Keep On Taking Chances {Will's POV} A flash of sharp pain shot through me and I groaned as I slowly opened my eyes, and as I stared into Kayla's green eyes I smiled. \"I thought I was going to lose you.\" She said softly leaning down to kiss me on the cheek. \"Your voice was the one thing that kept me going.\" I murmured softly. My throat felt dry as a desert and it hurt to try and clear my throat. \"Will?\" I turned my head at the sound of my mom's voice and smiled. \"Hey mom,\" \"How are you feeling honey?\" \"Pretty sore.\" I replied as Kayla handed me a glass of water. I tried to sit up to take a sip of it and immediatly sharp agonizing pain shot through my ribs. \"Easy sweetheart.\" Mom said gently as I opened my eyes once the pain passed. \"I'm so sorry.\" Kayla said looking at me apologetically. \"It's okay.\" I said softly as she kissed me on the cheek again. I winced in pain and saw the concerned look in Kayla's eyes. \"Don't worry about it.\" I replied. \"It just only hurts to breathe.\" {Kayla's POV} I felt tears about to pour out of my eyes as I tried not to cry. \"Kayla, what's wrong?\" Will asked. \"If this is about what happened-\" \"It's not just that.\" I said as I felt my voice breaking and the tears falling down my cheeks. \"You wouldn't be in this position if it wasn't for me.\" \"What are you talking about? You had nothing to do with it.\" He replied softly. \"But it's because of me, that Nick was able to get you into agreeing to go along with it.\" I said trying not to cry, even though my emotions were taking over. \"You wouldn't be hurt if it wasn't for me.\" I felt his hand on top of mine as I looked at him through the tears that blurred my vision. \"Don't worry okay? Nick's going to get what's coming to him.\" Suddenly at the mention of Nick's name a pang of fury flashed through me eliminating the sadness I was just feeling. \"Your right.\" I said wiping away the tears from my eyes with the sleeve of my pink jacket. \"He is going to get what's coming to him.\" \"Sweetie, let's not do anything drastic now.\" I heard mom say as she and dad came up from behind me. \"They need to pay for this.\" I said looking over at dad. \"Honey, even if there was something we could do, it would be our word against theirs.\" Mom said gently. \"Your mom's right.\" Dad agreed. \"Besides, we can't prove that they were the cause of the avalanche anyway, it could've just been a freak accident or something.\" \"Then I'll get proof.\" I said. \"I know Sabastian had some kind of set up for that thing. I mean if they weren't the cause of it, then how come Will was the only one that got hurt? Where's Nick?\" I saw the look on my parents' faces and then looked back at Will. \"Don't do anything drastic.\" He said softly. \"I don't want anything to happen to you.\" \"Don't worry,\" I said with a smile. \"You just concentrate on getting better so we can train for the next Fire & Ice Compition.\" I saw Will's eyes light up as he smiled, and a second later, he squeezed his eyes shut as his face contorted in pain. I felt my heart break to see him like this, but I knew that Nick and Sabastian were not going to get away with this. No matter the cost, I was going to prove they were involved one way or another. TOO BE CONTINUED...I know the chapter is pretty short, but There will be longer ones to come. Boy Kayla is really out for vengeance isn't she? But is she right? Did Nick and Sabastian really have something to do with the avalanche that caused Will's injuries? or are they really innocent after all? Stay tuned to find out. Hope you enjoyed and please review! ","Summary":" I do not own the Movie Cloud 9 or the characters. The only thing I own is the plot, and the name of"},{"Movie":"Cloud 9","Title":"Doors: Glued and Locked Shut","Author":"Clato 27","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10501915","Passage":"[Chapter 1] A/N: so I was watching Cloud 9, a duh, and at the part where Nick tells the whole sled story I noticed Sebastian looked back at Will and Will looked like so hurt. Then I was totally like what if Sebastian was Will's dad and he left him and like this whole thing spread out before my eyes. Like Will and Nick could so be brothers just because they are both so fiiiinnneee like damn those Disney boys. I guess it's kinda like One Tree Hill only, not. I wrote it in like a hour. Hope you guys like it! Doors: Sebastian Allan Swift never wanted to become a father. He had told Elizabeth Cloud that the moment they started dating and she agreed. He didn't want kids. She didn't want kids. He would be a pro snowboarder. She would be a first class veterinarian. They both had to big of plans that a baby could crush with his little, pudgy hands. He wouldn't of said they were in love, him and Lizzie (he will admit it was more than what he and Charlotte had) but they had dated for two years before she told him she was pregnant. He broke it off, giving her all he had in his wallet (a hundred and thirty one dollars and eighty seven cents) and told her that should be enough for an abortion. Then he left, assuming she got one. He met Charlotte less then a week later. They didn't want the same thing, but he didn't care. She was just a rebound. He'd date her for a few months to get over Lizzie and then look for someone to spend the rest of his life with. She didn't exactly know that (they didn't really talked about thing like that. Or anything really) and purposed when she found out she was pregnant less then a month after they got together. Her parents had money. They could bankroll him all the way to the top. He said yes and they were married that September. Nicholas Robert Swift was born that November. It worked out well at first, Charlotte stayed home with the baby and he went out and shredded, winning challenge after challenge and competition after competition. He was on the way to the top. Then his in-laws lost most of their money in stocks and a factory fire or something devastating in more ways then one. He had to stop competing to provide for the wife and son he didn't want. However, it wasn't as terrible as he thought. He worked as a coach and in an office building using the degree he received but he never thought he would use. It wasn't until Nick started school that it completely fell to shit. He picked his five year old son up on the first day of school and was introduced to his first friends. (\"Daddy! This is Dink-\" \"it's Dick!\" \"No, your name is Dink!\" \"See Will agrees. It's Dink! Oh right! Daddy, this is Dink Johnson and Will Cloud. Were best friends!\"). He stared at the little boy, laughing with his son at the other kid yelling that his name was Dick, not Dink. His hair was brown and eyes were a clear blue. The same blue as his and Nick's. Lizzie was on the other side of the class room, looking at him and confirming his suspicions. She never got the abortion (she never spent the hundred thirty one dollars and eighty seven cents either). He had snatched his son away, telling him not to play with that boy again. Nick asked why and he replied he would hate him forever. (Little did Nick know that he already did because of his existence- not to mention his brother's. He never really had a chance in the first place). The five year old promised never to play with Will and Dink ever again for as long as he lived, cross his heart and hope to die, and held to that promise for a little over eleven years. Then Nick met Kayla Morgan, Mike Lamb and Burke Brighton after he switched kindergarten classes. They then became his friends and eventual teammates. Nick started snowboarding as soon as his feet were big enough to fit in the boots attached to his father's first board. Sebastian started his own snowboarding club and equipment company when Nick turned 13. He pushed his son hard, not because it was Nick's dream, but to beat Will. Both his sons were apparently naturals on the slopes. After Will beat Nick at their first competition, Sebastian pushed his son harder. He didn't need the son he claimed as his own and raised to be a looser. That reflected badly on him. Charlotte left him a year later. Apparently, he was to intense and ruff and she couldn't take it anymore. She went to live on the other side of the mountain with her parents and Nick. His son stayed with him on weekends and nights when practice went long, which was fine with both if them. He had the divorce papers written up less then a month after she left him. He signed and ended his 14 year old marriage without blinking an eye. He needed Nick to win, pushing him past his breaking point and cheating to make sure of it. He had him date Kayla Morgan so her dad would pay for the team. He greased the bottom of Will's board so it wouldn't grip the ice properly and lead him to break his leg and collapse his lounge. He had almost killed his first born and temporarily ended the young man's career. But he didn't care as long as Nick won. (He did, but it wasn't like anyone noticed anyway with Will Cloud almost dying on the snow right before their very eyes. Not even Nick was happy about that victory). a year later, he told Nick to run his brother's sled threw the sign and frame Kayla for it to get her off the team. They needed to win Fire and Ice and they weren't going to do it with Kayla dragging them down like an anchor. At first he said no, but he persuaded him like he'd been able to do since the day he befriended the brother he never knew he had. (Now the \"I will hate you forever\" threat was a bit more advanced). He had him break Kayla's heart and date Skye as well, just to make sure she didn't leave the team before he could beat the Hot Doggers into the ground. He wouldn't of done that if he knew what would come out of it. The son he never claimed did what he could never do, coach Kayla into shape. She learned how to do advanced tricks that he never would have bothered thinking about teaching her. Nick barely beat him in the men's half pipe, which made him smile in triumph. He was still the failure he knew he'd be the moment he saw Will shred for the first time. Then Nick turned on him. He came clean about the whole thing just because he hadn't been proud enough or cared for him enough. Sebastian glanced at Will and saw the shame written in his features at his son's proclamation. Will already hated him and now Nick did as well. Sebastian lost both his sons a long time ago and he was ok with that fact until then. Until the day after he saw four eyes, identical copies of his own, looking at him with sadness and shame. They lost because Kayla Morgan, the girl he had put in harms way because he thought she wasn't a threat, did the fucking Cloud 9 and got a fucking perfect score. That was unheard of and all that night it was all Sebastian could think about. Until he walked into his son's room the next morning and found it empty besides the furniture and Nick's Team Swift snowboard laying in the middle of the room, broken in half and with a hateful note laying on the desk. It wasn't until the next day that it hit him. He had lost all the arrogance and intensity and the ability to hold back his feelings so he could hurt those around him without the guilt seeping in and realized he lost everything . He had no love, no son and no respect. People sent him glances of hatred and crossed the street when they saw him coming. Richard Morgan, owner of the resort, stopped all his funding for the club. Nick moved completely in with his mom, only leaving a few useless and broken items to show he had ever lived there. For the first time in his life he was alone . He had lost all hope and went to the last place he'd ever thought he'd end up: Lizzie Cloud's doorstep. He had knocked and Dink answered the door, having stayed at his best friend's house after the night full of festivities for the Hot Doggers. (\"Dick, is... um, Will home?\" \"It's Dink\"). He had gotten his son and Will had told him that he wasn't welcome here, in the home that he had livid in once with the mother of his eldest son. He stayed silent though because he didn't know why he was there, let alone what to say (\"when's your birthday?\" and \"what's your middle name?\" came to mind, but he was still to scared to show that he cared- correction, cares). It was the closest he had been to his first born in about twelve years and that fact alone startled him. Will didn't look anything like him, except the nose and the striking blue eyes. Then Will started talking. (\"My mom told me about you, how you left, told her to get an abortion, and didn't even stick around long enough to see it threw. Then you get Nick's mom pregnant twenty minuets later and marry her? I am not envious of Nick. I could never be after how I saw him last night. He came by here and apologized because you greased my board the night of my accident. He thought he should have stopped you and shouldn't have wrecked my sled. He told me he wished we could have been friends, but you told him no. That you threatened to take away something you didn't even give him in the first place. I told him I wished we could have been friends too and then I told him that we're brothers. I told him because he deserves to know, not to get back at you. So please go before I call the cops\"). He shut the door on him and Sebastian lost it. He went home that night and cried himself to sleep because now he apparently had feelings . He grew a heart when no one needed him to use it, when no one cared if he had one anyway. It was to late for him. It was much, much to late for him to prove himself to and love his family because they had shut him out. One door had been glued shut years ago and no matter how hard he tried he couldn't pry it open. The other door was locked from the outside and he couldn't get out even of he had the key. He would he'd never be able to prove himself to his boys. He saw both his sons again together five years later. They were at the Cantina, their boards leaned against the wall behind them and they were laughing and talking and smiling (three things he never saw Nick do when he was in his life). Kayla Morgan was basically in Will's lap, a huge ring on the ring finger of her left hand and his eyes were filled with love and adoration when he looked at her. Nick had his arms slinged over the shoulders of a skinny red head who was sneaking spoonfuls of his ice cream without his notice. They were happy and he only knew that because of a chance passing one cold afternoon. That was the last time he saw them in person. He watched Will (and occasionally Kayla) win gold medals and a few silver medals in the 2018 and 2022 Winter Olympics. There was an announcement in the newspaper a while latter that the local Olympians were expecting a baby boy. He clipped that article out and put it with the one announcing that they were married. He never met his grandson or even learned his name. He received a letter from Nick about a year after reading the article. It contained details of his life. He quit snow boarding after he graduated high school and went to Santa Clara University in California while Will joined the Olympic team. He became an architect and was the best man at Will and Kayla's wedding. Nick told him of his girlfriend who he was thinking of proposing to and that maybe he could come to the wedding, if he ever worked to the nerve to propose. He also bragged about his little nephew who apparently looked just like his hot uncle. He had included a two pictures. One was of Nick and Will, both looking smart in tuxes and standing at the altar at Will's wedding. Nick was giving the camera a thumbs up and Will was smiling larger than he had ever seen him smile. The other was of himself, his brother and the baby boy who was smiling a toothless smile. The two brother's arms were wrapped around each other's shoulders and the baby was sitting in his father's other arm. The baby looked just like Will except for Kayla's blond locks and Nick's huge nose, but even that trait both brother's got from himself. He also possessed the striking blue eyes of his grandfather. He starred at those pictures while waiting for the wedding invitation that never came. Years went by and eventually Sebastian knew he was completely forgotten by his sons and their growing families. Sebastian Allan Swift never wanted to be a father, but he became one anyway. He distanced, resented, threatened and pushed his sons past their breaking point and lost both of them in one bad decision and a first REAL conversation between two brothers. It wasn't until he wasn't one anymore that he realized he wanted to become a father. He had loved being a father. A/N: yeah. I don't really know where that whole thing came from, but I'm glad I wrote it. So this will become a three-shot, the next two chapters restricted to both Will ad a Nick's point of view. They will contain more info about what happened to all three of them after the Fire and ice competition. Hope you guys liked it and stay tuned for the next installments.[Chapter 2] A/N: so it's is part two of the Doors: Glued and Locked installment. This part is restricted to Will's point of view. Kinda goes into his backstory and his feelings about Sebastian. I can tell you right now that it'll be different then what Nick feels. Anyway, I hope you enjoy it. Glue: Sebastian Allan Swift never wanted to become a father. Will Cloud always knew that. He was kinda living proof. His mother had told him he didn't want a baby either, not at the time any away. They dated for two years and before Lizzie found out she was pregnant. He left, only giving her a hundred and thirty one dollars and eighty seven cents and orders to terminate the pregnancy before he left. Will Cloud's mother hadn't wanted him at first, but, lucky for him, it was against all his mother's morals to get rid of him. She was thinking of putting him up for adoption or finding a nice family to take care of him, (he never though it would be that bad). But he always thought he was lucky his mom kept him and raised him like she did. She got a desk job at an office in town and he stayed at the daycare there during the day. Occasionally his mother would pick up an extra shift at the Cantina at the newly opened resort just up the mountain from his house. Those were his favorite nights because he would stand out on the snow and watch the big kids ride the half pipe. Sometimes these big kids would take him up to the top and show him tricks. His first board was a hand-me-down from one of the said big kids. It was a hand-me-down and it would take a year or two to grow into, but that was fine by him. He just couldn't wait to learn how to shred. He found out about his little brother (if he could even call him that, they were so close in age) on his fist day of kindergarten. Out of all twenty-something kids in the class, he picked his brother and Dink to befriend on the first day. They had all flocked to the bin filled with plastic dinosaurs and a friendship instantly formed. Dink had introduced himself as Dick (that was his real name after all) but somehow Nick had misheard that and he was branded Dink for life. Nick had dragged the two over to his dad because he wanted him to meet his new friends. (\"Daddy! This is Dink-\" \"it's Dick!\" \"No, your name is Dink!\" \"See Will agrees. It's Dink! Oh right! Daddy, this is Dink Johnson and Will Cloud. Were best friends!\"). Will had noticed the look Mr. Swift had given him and his mother and was sad when Nick told him they couldn't be friends the next day. Will had asked his mother about it and that's when he first learned the whole story about his father. How he left when he found out about him and then married another lady a whole month later and made him a brother. His mother made it clear that his father didn't love him, but she had enough love for him to make up for his father not being there. She had also made it clear not to tell Nick that he was his brother because it was not his place to tell (not yet anyway). Will remained best friends with Dink after Nick switched classes and Sam Landerson joined their class. He was into dinosaurs too and they both started snowboarding as soon as they were old enough to. They made their own team, coaching each other, with the help of the big kids, and coming up with their own moves. The time spent when they weren't at school or at home, they were on the half pipe at the resort. They went against the Swift team several times, winning their share and the Swift team winning occasionally. That did not make Sebastian happy. Then his accident happened. He had invented the Cloud 9. He had been so close to landing it so many times and even landed it in a practice run. However, he wasn't so lucky in the competition. He fell on his back, broke his leg and collapsed his lounge. It was bad, really bad and he quit then because he had almost died. He wasn't about to die and leave his mother alone just because shredding was one if the most important things in his life. His mom opened the dog kennel that year. Hot Doggers wasn't exactly a success at first, but it brought in enough money with wages for night shifts at the Cantina. It was a step closer to his mom's long lost dream to become a vet and Will loved dogs and never complained working there once. He kept convincing himself that he was happy, but there was always a gap where snow boarding used to be. Then he met Kayla Morgan. She ran his sled threw the famous billboard that had been there longer then her father's resort itself. Her punishment was working at Hot Doggers and while he was thankful for the help, she was a real pain in the ass. Then Nick dumped her and she persuaded him to coach her (to this day he still can not believe she did). She improved, that was for sure, and he thought she had officially gone insane when she asked him to teach her the Cloud 9. Then she snow boarded down Tyson's Peak and he couldn't exactly not teach her or get back on his own board in the process. What she did to him was amazing and crazy and somewhere along the line he fell in love with her. Then there was the Fire and Ice competition. He had came in second, Nick beating him by just a few points. He was ok with that though. He had Kayla smiling up at him and her hand in his and that made up for the loss. Not even his father congratulating the son that he picked could bother him. But Sebastian wasn't congratulating Nick and Nick finally broke. He was standing next to Kayla when he went off on their father. Sebastian was never proud enough of him or cared enough for him and he was done with him. He saw Nick's eyes boil with hatred and disappointment and he felt his eyes mimic the feeling because he felt it to. He had only spoken to his father once in his life (the second time being later that night) but he hated the man because he made his mother and his little brother miserable and because he couldn't see what he was throwing away. Sebastian looked back at him and there was hurt in his blue eyes. Will looked away and them Kayla was doing her second run. She had told him she was going to do it and he was so scared she would hurt herself like he did, but she didn't. She landed the Cloud 9 and got a perfect score, and pushing them above first place and they won. The whole team slept over at Will's house. He woke up on the floor to a knocking at the front door. It was the middle of the night and it seemed like he was the only one up. He jumped over and maneuvered threw the empty bottles of soda, Chinese take out and pizza boxes. Nick was at his door, and that was the most surprising thing that happened all night. (\"Look, Will, I'm so sorry. I shouldn't of ran your sled threw that sign and I should have stood up to my dad, but... He's been pulling the same thing on me since I was five and I can just never get away from him. I have to listen to him. I'm so sorry. And your accident lat year wasn't an accident. My dad greased the bottom of your board so it wouldn't grip the ice. I tried to stop them because even though I wanted to beat you, I didn't want you to get hurt. I'm sorry I should have stopped him. I should have stayed your friend all those years ago. I am so sorry, Will.\" \"I wish we could have been friends too, man. We still can be if you want. I don't think your dad's told you, but I'm kind of your brother.\" \"My parents used to fight about you. My mom didn't even find out until I was eleven. I heard them fighting about you... Can we just skip the friends part and be brothers 'cause I kind of disowned my dad tonight?\" \"That's cool, dude.\") Then he left and Will closed the door and fell back asleep on the floor only to be waken up a few hours later by another visitor. Dink was the first one up to answer it while Will tried to wake himself up. Sam and Kayla were still passed out on the couches when Dink came back, telling him Sebastian Swift was at the door. (\"He called me Dick. Not even my grandma calls me Dick.\") He had gone to the door, jaw clenched and the first thing out of his mouth was you're not welcome here. Sebastian starred at him, saying nothing and doing nothing. Just as his first conversation with his father should be. It was clear he wasn't going to leave so he started talking. (\"My mom told me about you, how you left, told her to get an abortion, and didn't even stick around long enough to see it threw. Then you get Nick's mom pregnant twenty minuets later and marry her? I am not envious of Nick. I could never be after how I saw him last night. He came by here and apologized because YOU greased my board the night of my accident. He thought he should have stopped you and shouldn't have wrecked my sled. He told me he wished we could have been friends, but you told him no. That you threatened to take away something you didn't even give him in the first place. I told him I wished we could have been friends too and then I told him that we're brothers. I told him because he deserves to know, not to get back at you. So please go before I call the cops\"). He felt like he didn't make any sense but so much if it at all the same time. the he shut the door in his face, leaning against it and taking a deep breath. Kayla, Sam and Dink were at the end of the hallway, looking at him with wide eyes and huddled together like penguins. Yeah. He's my dad, he told them and they went on with the day as if there wasn't a visit from Evil Spawn himself. The Swift team disbanded. Skye moved back to Aspen or some other foreign destination, and Mike and Burke had went to another club farther down the mountain. Nick had joined Hot Doggers and never spoke to his father again. The two brothers became close and found out they were even more similar then they thought. They basically became each other's best friends. Nick had decided to go to collage, but he and Kayla had been recruited for the Olympic team. He had won five gold medals and three silvers during the 2018 and 2022 Winter Olympics. Kayla had win six gold medals and continues to hold it over his head. She would never let him live it down. Will had proposed to Kayla the summer when they were 21. (\"You're pretty young to be getting married, dude.\" \"Shut up, Nicholas , and just hold the damn roses!\"). Then they were married in the winter of 2019. Nick was the best man and Will regretted that decision during his toast. (\"Although I did have Kayla first, you two look much cutter together plus I didn't know we were brothers back then. I don't think that's breaking the bro code or anything so congrats, I guess\"). Kayla thought it was funny, Will not so much. Kayla found out she was pregnant during their second Olympics. They were only 25 and pretty young to have a baby, but that doesn't mean that they weren't ecstatic for the arrival of their baby. They had a blond haired, blue eyed baby boy with his uncle's nose (given, Will and Nick had the same nose, but they let him this one thing). It was shortly after his son's birth that Nick came to him. He said he was writing Sebastian a letter. He just wanted to tell him what was going on in their life and wanted to make sure Will was ok with it. Will said it was fine. If he wanted a relationship with their father he wasn't going to be the one to stop him. Will wrote him a letter too, but never sent it. He had just stuck it in the back of the drawer in his bedside table. Turns out, Nick was a real wose when it came to feelings. He usually only had flings or one night stands or girlfriends that barely lasted a month. (\"Will, how am I supposed to settle down with someone when you married the best girl out there?\" \"Let's not talk about how my wife and the mother of my child used to date you.\" \"Way to rub it in, dude\"). Then he met Ellie and they dated for two years before he finally found the balls to purpose. He wrote Sebastian a wedding invitation, but it just ended up in the drawer with Will's letter. Will and Kayla ended up having two more kids, a boy and a girl. Nick and Ellie only had one daughter. Will doubted his father even knew his children's names. After the birth of his son, he couldn't understand how Sebastian could just abandon him and treat Nick like crap. From the moment he held his kids for the first time, he knew he would do anything to protect and care for them. Sebastian Allan Swift never wanted to be a father, but Will Cloud was glad he did. If he didn't he wouldn't have his perfect wife or three beautiful kids or a brother that against all odds became his best friend. If he wasn't distanced, resented, threatened he wouldn't have the life he had today. He would trade his father for that any day.[Chapter 3] A/N: So I was watching Cloud 9 (for probably the 100th time) and my inspiration for this was boran again. Yay. So this is the third and final installment and is restricted to Nick's point of view. I actually made this whole thing kinda symbolic and deep, like over two years ago me really had this thing figured out and it's probably the most English class worthy thing that I've ever written. Explanation will be at the bottom. Enjoy! Locked: Sebastian Allan Swift never wanted to be a father. Nick Swift didn't know that growing up and he wished he did. Or, well, he wished he figured it out on his own rather than by told by his secret half-brother that he bullied his whole life. Nick's mother wanted him. She wanted him more than anything in the whole world. She always told him that, always. Whenever his father pushed him to hard, whenever he lost a competition and his father wouldn't look at him, whenever he just had a bad day, she would tell him. I always wanted you, Nicky, and I always will. He knew his parents got married because his mother became pregnant with him. They had a blissful first few years until Nick turned _ and his grandparents lost their money in stocks and a fire. He spent all his time with his mother and his father would be gone for challenges and competitions or, in the years after the fire, he would be at work. It was a peaceful and happy life until Nick's first day of kindergarten when he unknowingly befriended his brother and Dink- well, Dick. He remembers the day, dragging the two boys over to meet his father because, back then, his father was his role model and his opinion meant the world to Nick. (\"Daddy! This is Dink-\" \"it's Dick!\" \"No, your name is Dink!\" \"See Will agrees. It's Dink! Oh right! Daddy, this is Dink Johnson and Will Cloud. Were best friends!\") And his father had ripped him away and basically thrown him into the car. Nick's father told him to never play with those boys again and, when Nick asked why, Sebastian answered, with absolutely no hesitation, that if he played with those boys again he would hate Nick forever. So Nick didn't. He transferred classes and made friends with Mike, Burke, and Kayla and his dad was happy about it so he stayed friends with them. They all joined his dad's snowboarding club once they were old enough to compete. Nick was better than all of them. He'd been training for longer, pushed harder to be better, made to feel like a failure whenever he lost. He had to be better, there was no question. When Nick's mom left, taking him with him to go live with Grandma and Grandpa on the whol other side of the mountain, Nick felt like he could breath, at least some of the time. He still spent weekends with his dad and the nights they practiced late. It was fine because, eventually he would end up a whole mountain away from his father and he could breathe. But, in some ways the divorce made things worse. His dad pushed him harder as if Nick's mom was the only thing keeping him from pushing Nick full force. Sebastian started cheating too and using Nick as a pawn to get what he wanted. He had Nick date Kayla Morgan even though he only liked her as a friend and really had no interest in dating anyone. But he did it so his dad could get the money for his company and so his father wouldn't be disappointed in him. He was so scared of his father being disappointed in him and hating him (he already did, but Nick didn't know that, he liked to pretend everything was fine, that his father loved him like Kayla's dad loved her) that he ignored when his dad greased Will Cloud's board and nearly killed him. He didn't stand up to his father when he told Nick his plan and he didn't tell the truth after Will almost died. (He felt bad about it for years, whenever he saw Will hobbling around on his crutches and even when he was perfectly healthy. The guilt only got worse when he found out Will was his brother , but it went away after Will punched him and told him to forget it. His brother got him way better than his father ever did). He also didn't say anything when his father asked him to run Will's sled into the sign and frame Kayla for it. He put Kayla's life in danger and wrecked private property all to avoid his father's disappointment. Then he broke Kayla's heart just to date another girl he had no interest in dating. He never deserved Kayla or Skye, both were both beautiful, strong, talented women he temporarily ruined. Then Fire and Ice happened and Nick broke. He won the whole thing, just barely, but it was still a win and he did what his father pushed him to do his whole life, but he still wasn't proud. Nick didn't win by enough, wasn't good enough. He was the best but he still wasn't good enough. So he broke, he came clean. About Will's accident, the sled, everything because he couldn't do this anymore. He couldn't push himself to the breaking point to impress a man who would never be proud of him, never love him in the way a father was supposed to love his son. So he broke and he told the truth and he could breathe. He didn't care And then the Swift team lost because Kayla did the fucking Cloud 9 and Nick is sure he never cheered so loud in his life (that's until he watched the same girl do the same trick years later, at the 2018 Olympics). And then he went back to his father's house, a place that hadn't been home since his mother left and he packed his stuff. He packed everything. All his belongings that were left at his father's house, except for his Team Swift snowboard. That, he broke in half and left the pieces of his floor. He meant to go back to his mom's house, he really did, but instead he walked and walked in the freezing weather and snow until he found himself on Will Cloud's doorstep. It was the middle of the night, but he knocked anyway, hoping that Will would want to see him and he could apologize for everything he and his father did. Will answered the door and they had their first REAL conversation. (\"Look, Will, I am so sorry. I shouldn't have ran your sled threw that sign and I should have stood up to my dad, but… He's been pulling the same thing on me since I was five and I can just never et away from him. I have to listen to him. I'm so sorry. And your accident last year wasn't an accident. My dad greased the bottom of your board so it wouldn't grip the ice. I tried to stop him because even though I wanted to beat you, I didn't want you to get hurt. I'm sorry I should have stopped him. I should have stayed your friend all those years ago. I am so sorry, Will.\" \"I wish we could have been friends too, man. We still can be if you want. I don't think you dad's told you, but I'm kind of your brother.\" \"My parents used to fight about you. My mom didn't even find out about you until I was eleven. I heard them fighting about you… Can we just skip the friends part and be brothers 'cause I kind of disowned my dad tonight? \"That's cool, dude.\") And then Nick went on with his life. He lived full time with his mom, never seeing his dad, and developed a relationship with Will. He stopped competing entirely, but kept boarding because he loved it. He even practiced with the Hot Doggers and became friends with Sam and Dink (\"Y'know, that nickname you gave me back in kindergarten was stupid, but thank God no one called me Dick in middle school. You saved me from a bullet, man\"). Will became Nick's best friend and sept that position for the rest of their lives. Will and Kayla went off and got recruited by the National team and Nick went to college. He got accepted at Santa Clara University in California, a whole four hours away from the squishy ice Californians called snow. He went to school and watched Will and Kayla win their gold medals in the Olympics. They were just 21 when Will proposed to Kayla. Nick was there, holding a bunch of flowers and giving Will crap about how nervous he was. (\"You're pretty young to be getting married, dude.\" \"Shut up, Nicholas, and just hold the damn roses!\") He was also Will's best man at his and Kayla's wedding, which he regretted as soon as Nick started his toast to the happy couple. (\"Although I did have Kayla first, you two look much cuter together plus I didn't know we were brothers back then. I don't think that's breaking the bro code or anything so congrats, I guess\"). Kayla thought it was funny, Will punched him in the arm and told him he wished he was still an only child. He was never good at relationships, never really wanted a relationship, until he met Ellie. He loved her, that was for sure and Will loved to make fun of him for it even though he wasn't much better when it came to his wife. When he was 23, the greatest thing in his life happened: Kayla and Will had a baby. Nick loved his nephew more than he loved anyone. He had Kayla's hair and Will's eyes but Nick's nose. In the eyes of Nick and his parents, the little boy couldn't have been more prefect or more loved. His nephew was what gave Nick the final push to propose. Right before that proposal, though, he wrote a letter to his father. Just about his life a little about Will's and maybe an invitation to his wedding. He went to Will with it, hoping his brother would tell him not to send it, but Will didn't tell him that and Nick sent the letter. A reply never came and a wedding invitation never followed it. Nick never introduced his father to his wife or his daughter, Nick never even saw the man again, alive anyway. He went to the funeral, his daughter in his arms and his wife at his side and that was it. Sebastian Allan Swift never wanted to become a father, but he did. He fathered two kids and never took responsibility for them, but it worked out. Nick turned his life around and made it his own and ended up happy in the process. That's all the mattered. A/N: Two years later and it's finally done. Yay! So, yeah there it is. I'm really proud of it, like, it's kinda sad but I am! They symbolism is actually really important to me and it's kinda lame but I think it's clever so here we go. Sebastian has like doors that symbolise his sons. One is glued shut as in it can't be opened and never can be opened no matter how much he tries to open it. What is behind that door is forever closed off to him and was never open to him. That door is supposed to symbolised Will and his relationship with Sebastian which is nonexistent. The other door is locked. It was once open and accessible but then it was locked from the other side and he can't open it, no matter how hard he tries. That door is Nick and how the door used to be open to Sebastian but then Nick essentially locked him out of his life. So yeah, I'm extremely proud of this whole thing and think I'm clever. Thanks for reading and if you actually were an original reader, I am proud of uou and PM me so we can be trash over this movie together.

Since its creation this organization lives and breathes for only one single goal. To create a whole brand new world out of the remnants and pieces left behind after the old one is brought to its knees cleansing it out humanity. In order to remold it the correct way with order and no chaos. The leader of the League of Shadows is a man named Ra's al Ghul. For century's Ra's al Ghul has managed to cheat death with what's known as a Lazarus Pit. Through this method Ra's al Ghul has kept this organization alive into the modern day. But while this man is immortal that doesn't mean he is invincible. Ra's al Ghul has to look to the future for those who can take on the role he leaves behind to lead the League of Shadows after he is gone. Because of this his daughter Talia al Ghul became pregnant by her lover in Gotham City so as to create a new heir for the dynasty to grow and legacy to continue onwards should anything happen to them. To their surprise and delight Talia conceived twins in her womb doubling the chances for the League of Shadows survival into the next generation. During the pregnancy Talia was exposed to some forces of magic, gems that contained great power within them. The Sun Drop and the Moonstone, separate entity's of darkness and light. One that grants life and the other that can take it away. During this exposure one of the infants Talia carried within her absorbed the aura's radiating off of them for a long length of tremendous time. As a result of this the child born would forever be granted gifts that can possibly alter the course of the world's fate for better or worse. This girl is Danika Wayne, twin sister to Damian Wayne and daughter of Gotham's Dark Knight. The League of Shadows Little Morning Star. Authors Note: Dun dun dun! Ah! Here is another one! Wow, I am really dishing them out lately. Now this story I've been debating with how to put up for a long while. I can't recall who it was or what story the review was in, but a very long time ago one of my readers did suggest a story idea similar to this one. Just to be very clear Id' already thought about doing one such as this before he/she mentioned it to me. I wanted to put it up immediately, but I was having problems with figuring out the persona of my female OC character. Now I've already figured out her name. Unfortunately there are other layouts of her life to contend with. For one it's her and Damian's age. I'm putting them down as eleven years old in this story, but if any of you know a different age Damian is supposed to be in the Son of Batman please let me know so I can change it. Another thing that was holding me back from putting this story up was if Danika should have powers or not. The same reviewer as before did say she should have elemental powers, but it never really sat well with them. Now I finally found the perfect ones for her to possess. Best part about them is that they suit the definition of her name too. Basically the name Danika means Morning Star. I've decided to grant Danika the powers that lay in the Moonstone and Sun Drop in Tangled. I watched and listened to the new song on Youtube for the Moonstone incantation and just got inspired. It's like a huge light bulb went off in my head. I finally have something I can work with. I was so happy the moment it clicked. She won't quite have magic hair like Rapunzel has, but in order to use her powers/magic she will have to sing the incantations that come with them. The abilities that Danika has will be explained for in the following chapter after this one and the reasons why they fit. Trust me, they'll be making a whole lot more sense once I get further into it there. We're a long way of from it at this point, but I really need to figure out her superhero name. I'd really love to hear your suggestions on the matter. As per usual anyone who gives me the winning suggestion will get a question answered on the story. So go over every single one of them carefully because remember you only get one until the next event that pops up. I really do need a name for her when she's in costume. Also, Heads up guys! We've got trouble. I received this alert from another fellow author.

(I only own what's mine) (Sophia's POV) \"I'm not afraid Damien,\" I state, ignoring the truth staring me in the face and look back at the mirror, my hands covering my exposed shoulders. They were scarred. The ever present reminder of my time to The Joker. They littered down my whole body. The others didn't mind. Each member of the bat family was covered in a scar of twenty. Even more, if you counted Damien and Jayson but the two birds were a bit more rambunctious and less cautious about their bodies. Throwing themselves in the line of fine to get closer and deliver the finishing kill. There had been a few times Jayson and Damien had crossed the line, earning tension from Bruce and an awkward three weeks of silence but they tired of abiding by his rules and more time than not taking a bad guy down with less force than wanted. \"Then put on that dress and show the world the beautiful, strong and amazing girl I fell in love with.\" My eyes snapped up at him, Love? That was the first time he'd said that out loud \"Or,\" Damien continues not letting me process what was just spoken \"you can stay with your other dress and hide from the world because of your too scared of what others might say. \"It's not that simple Damien.\" I sigh, hugging my body tightly. The party was in full swing downstairs. I'd often don a lacy dress that covered my scars, form fitting and acceptable for the occasion but it seemed to bug Damien. The grandson of the Demon never understood the shame I had for my scars. Damien was taught to rule humanity and hadn't spent much time on it even under the tutelage of Bruce. His body was littered with scars and would often make me forget mine as he placed burning kisses down each one. His talented fingers tracing the curves of my body like he was memorizing every inch. Holding me with such care like he was losing me in the morning. Even though he wore his scars with pride, his body was covered up. The mini Bruce was donning an expensive tailor-made suit, only the finest for the Waynes and I was stuck looking between two dresses hanging on the wall. My original one, a Versace evening gown, and the one that Damien had ordered and hung beside it. It was beautiful, a Gucci cocktail dress that was red and lacy but exposed my arms, back and legs. The lace ran through the middle of the dress and down to the left hip, exposing just enough skin to prove that Damien had indeed picked it. I stood there in a mini robe, the black silk stopping at my mid-thigh and slippers on my feet. It seemed silly as the room was carpeted with red soft fabric but it felt better this way. I could feel Damien's eye burning into my body, his hand runs down my arm, the warm flesh calming my nerves. He steps forward, pulling me to his firm chest and whispers in my ear. \"Sophia, I will love you no matter what you choose, nothing in the world could ever change that... I just wish you would learn to love yourself as well.\" I step forwards, hugging myself again as I looked down at the floor. Damien seeing he wasn't getting anywhere else stands, hand on the door. He looks at me one last time before opening it \"… I'll wait for you downstairs.\" With that, he shuts the door. I stop, staring at the two dresses and fiddle with my mother's necklace, the last thing I had of her and wonder what to do. (Bruce's POV) I stood downstairs at the party, a drink in my hand and my eyes gently surveying the scene. I kept an awfully close eye on the resident trouble maker, Jayson. My wayward son had finally agreed to a party, arriving for a fitting at the tailors and showing up at the party with a not completely sour face. He'd done pretty well, dancing with a few women… and flirting of course. All in all, he seemed to be enjoying his time. I scanned around the room and picked out each of my sons from the crowd. Tim was Dancing with Cassie. Dick was dancing with Kori. Jayson was spiking his drink and almost the punch when Alfred steps in, sweeping up the container and placing it in a secure pocket in his jacket. Barba was talking with her father about something, laughing out good memories. And my youngest, I glanced around the room searching for my blood born son and his fiancé. The only daughter of Selena Kyle and my one love, Cat Woman. The whole incident had been my fault, Joker knew we were an item, hitting both the streets and the sheets more than a few times. I knew Selena had a daughter around Damien's age and I stupidly ignored the fact like nothing would happen. Sophia wasn't mine but that didn't stop Joker from trying to lure me out. It worked of course and when we got there, Selena was gone and Sophia was on death's door. Damien was the one to save her. During her time at the hospital and our home, my youngest son seemed to form a connection with the young female, much like I had with her mother and when Sophia got better it was only a matter of time before they got together. Dick was hesitant about it at first, claiming that Selina was a well-known criminal and her daughter could follow in her footsteps but Selina had changed for me and it's not like Damien's hands were the cleanest either. They did everything together. Sophia clinging to Damien for protection, much to my son dismay at first and Damien held in his murderous tendencies so he wouldn't frighten her. Sophia had Damien had quite a few fights, Sophia claiming Damien was too harsh on our bad guys and Damien saying Sophia got injured because we were too soft on them. After a few years, they figured it out, now staying by each other's side out of mutual love, not hatred. I found him a few minutes later, walking down the main hall that leads from the bedrooms. The second story of the hotel that I'd personally rented out. One room held all of our gear, in case things went bad and the others were rented out for each member of my family. I turn and see Damien stop, a few steps behind me and like I had, slowly survey the crowd. Snorting once when his eyes landed on Jayson but continue none the less. When he's done he stands by me, hands behind his back and a serious look on his face. \"Did you two get in a fight?\" I ask. Half afraid for my soon to be daughter in law and for the state of the hotel room if they had. \"Not a fight exactly, more like a disagreement.\" Damien states after a moment \"The room is fine and so is Sophia.\" I smirk at this but say nothing, trusting my youngest son words and walk out into the crowd. \"Drink?\" I ask, grasping two glasses of champagne with ease and hand one to him. Damien takes one, nodding once and turns engaging in a conversation with one of my business partners daughters. I leave them alone, allowing them to talk, laugh and converse on whatever subject they want and turn my attention to the room. Watching over everything and making sure people had enough food and drinks. I was conversing with the waiters and kitchen staff when the room falls silent. The music stops and I turn, instantly expecting Jayson or Damien to be fed up with some clingy female or obnoxious heir and find myself not looking at a disaster but the stairs. There at the top stood Sophia. Standing in all her glory, a nervous look on her eyes but her face calm and collected. The dress was beautiful, a little sexual for my tastes but it fit her body well. Hugging her curves and exposing her long legs to the world. The most shocking thing was the exposure, Sophia had been so hesitant to show off her body, at work, at the pool, at home so doing this at a public event was astounding. Her hair was let down in gentle waves, framing her shoulders beautifully. Sophia stood frozen at the stairs, looking around the crowd nervously and when her confidence ran out Damien broke through the crowd. Standing at the bottom of the stairs, arm extended up to her and the first genuine smile I'd seen all month. A small smile was on her lips as she made her way down the large staircase, taking Damien's hand and let herself be lead onto the dance floor. The music started again but the crowd was frozen, Sophia sensing this freezes, looking around with a painful face. I understood Damien's actions and his intentions were pure but people weren't that easily changed. The scars on her arms, shoulders, and back were deep. The Joker had done a massive amount of damage and even with years of physio and surgeries, her body wasn't the same. The look broke my heart and I moved, going to step in and say something when Damien steps forwards, surprising me for the second time. Damien, stepped back, removing his shirt and using his hands rips his dress shirt open. Sliding the ruined material off his body and exposing his scarred body to the world as well. Sophia's eyed widen at this but it doesn't stop as not only Damien but my others sons move, copying the same movements and tossing the rags and coats into a pile by the wall. Sophia's hands move to her mouth, a tearful smile on her face as Damien extends his hand once more. This time Sophia takes it and the music starts. I feel a hand on my arm and turn to see my old butler standing beside me. \"You should be proud of him Master Bruce,\" he smiles, a proud smile \"This is the first time I've seen Damien do something out of love.\" \"Yeah but now I'm going to have Social Services up my ass for weeks,\" I place a hand on my head \"God if people don't figure out our secret they'll think I'm abusing them or something.\" Alfred chuckles once before leaving, placing a hand on my shoulder before he goes. \"Be happy Bruce,\" he says with a cheery smile \"at least they aren't killing someone one.\" Okay, Read and Review.

I originally wrote this thing for a class assignment. But when I finished it and read it over, I couldn't help but think this is so Damian . Obviously, I changed it somewhat, so it fits better but please duly note that there is no actual scarlet sword. The reason why is this; the purpose of the original assignment was to chose an object and write about it metaphorically. If anyone is interested in the original copy, it will be posted on my profile ... eventually. Disclaimer; I no own. Without further ado, SCARLET By The Mishmosh Bird When I was a young child, grandfather gave me a sword. It was a sharp, pointed thing and it shone like tempered flame. I thought it was prettier than mother's diamond jewellery. I've cut myself on accident many times, of course. I was young after all. At first, grandfather and mother had little energy and attention to spare for me, but I learned from them what I could. I used to set up targets for myself. Wooden things. Stubby, ugly things. I would pass my sharp, pointed blade through them once, twice, leaving scars, precise and straight. I used to run my chubby fingers across the marks left by my thin, pointy sword. And I'd smile. Mother and grandfather soon saw my potential. My days filled with conditioning and endurance exercises on top of my usual academics. Dawn till dusk, I was either on my feet scaling the menacing Mount. Edna, on my back, counting fifty, sixty, seventy sit-ups or cross-legged in front of my politics tutor listing the pros and cons of communism. My favourite moments were when grandfather taught me swordplay. My eyes would trail the deadly, delicate sword as it twirled and danced in my hand. Everyday pushed me to my limits, and everyday people told me that I was exceptional. I learned later that I wasn't the only one with a glittering blade. But prideful, I am to say, that mine was by far the sharpest. It was the only one capable of cutting through bone. Then there were those without any sword at all. They slumped through their days with their heads down. Straight precise scars ran down their limbs. Puddles and trails of scarlet followed them like footprints. Utterly pathetic. I rarely sheathed my blade. Why should I? It was presented to me for use. Its edges were red-tinted by this time. A majestic and graceful thing. The day I noticed the red colouring, I named my blade Scarlet Flame. Then Deathstroke arrived. Burned my home to the ground. He decimated our defenses, killing with utter nondiscrimination. He slayed my grandfather. My grandfather, who had only recently celebrated his 456th birthday. My grandfather, the Demon's Head, the immortal leader of the League of Assassins. For me, it was a stark reminder that not even the best men were invincible. Mother did the only think she could think of. She brought me to Gotham. To father. Up until then, I had only ever heard my father spoken of, and in revered tones at that. I had not ever seen him, nor him me and I'd bet good money that he knew naught of my existence. I suppose I ought to have been nervous, but that emotion had been trained out of me long ago. Instead I felt a vague sense of satisfaction and anticipation of receiving a gift long withheld. Father did everything differently. While Mother expected me to be up at dawn and training, no excuses, Father seemed surprised to find me hacking at his numerous plant figures in the early light of the day. Well, it wasn't like he allowed me free access to his coveted cave. And the figures were ugly anyway. Mother and Grandfather always made me train until dark, and forced me to bed right after. Father, on the other hand, had me train far less in comparison and encouraged me to take breaks, yet he expects me to be awake and alert well after nightfall. I was the only child when I lived with Mother and Grandfather. Here, I suddenly had a sister and three brothers, only one of whom, the circus clown no less, actually showed their face. I would have thought that a new sibling warrants some interest. Of course, I was the only blood child, so I suppose I still am an only child. None of that, however, prepared me for the expectations Father had for me when I fight. He told me, ordered me, not to use my beautiful, gleaming blade. It was an easy rule to follow, at first. The thugs, lowlife and scum are undeserving to taste my sword's steel. I wouldn't have wanted their unworthy blood staining it anyway. Then it got harder. I realized that when Father forbade me from using my sword, he forbade me from killing as well. To kill. To end someone. To watch as the light drain from their eye as their very being is extinguished. To feel the warm gush of red that pours from them. To follow my instinct, ingrained in me from infancy. Father didn't understand what he was asking for. That's what I had thought. He didn't understand that he was asking me to deny, shun, a crucial part of myself. That he was requesting I lay down my scarlet sword forever. Who was he to tell me what to do, anyway? Who was he to forbade these things when it could so easily solve so many of his problems? Put a stop to the revolving doors of Arkham. I'm doing him a favor. If he's too weak to kill, the least he could do would be to step aside so I may perform the deed. He'll see sense in time. But for now, I suppose, he sets the rules. Deathstroke made another appearance. I had been watching him converse with Father on his screen when … was that Mother? She had been brutally beaten. Her body hung limply from their chains, with numerous cuts, still bleeding red. Deathstroke lifted her head up by the hair and I saw that one of her eyes had swollen shut, the other barely open. A chill ran through me. Mother had bested me in all our hand-to-hand spares. She was incredibly skilled physically and even more so of the mind. And Deathstroke had defeated her soundly. Fought her and won. What chance have I? What can I do to avenge her? I hadn't wanted to admit it to myself then, but there was another reason for my unease, a sentimental one. Mother was all I had. The Dojo lies in ruins as my immortal grandfather's corpse festers beneath the ground. If Mother were to … die … I'd have lost everything of my old life. At least father was here. A sudden urge to embrace him washed over me, but I shoved it back. This was not the time to be weak. In that moment I had decided. Father's rule be damned. If it took my Scarlet Flame to take Deathstroke down, then it was time my gleaming blade saw light. I knew that Deathstroke sought me out specifically, I was no fool. He wished to bait me. To lead me into a trap. I will make him regret that wish. Nothing, nothing was even vaguely comparable to the eventual battle between Deathstroke and I. His strikes were as fast as the snake he is, his every move, like dancing silk, unrivaled in their grace, except, maybe, by father. His blows were powerful enough to send vibrations through my very bones and brutal enough that they would pierce my skull. I barely held my own and was once again thankful for Grandfather's Itami regime. It was the only reason I was able to fight through the agony of being pierced through both wrists. I was going to kill him. I had planned on it. And my conviction gave me the strength I need. Deathstroke soon lay helpless, at the end of Scarlet Flame. Seconds before I was about to strike, Deathstroke said something that struck me to the core, \"Go ahead, finish me. You were train to kill your enemies weren't you?!... It's what you want, it's what I would do, it's what your grandfather would do...\" It was then, only then, that it occurred to me … what a child I had been. I've always scoffed at those who viewed the world in black and white. Good and evil. Idiots the lot of them. Everything, everything is a matter of perspective. There are only shades of gray. Uncertain and undecided until the moment society hail them as hero or condemn them as villains. Only a fool of the most ignorant sort would ever believe otherwise. But I realized right then that I had fallen into the same trap. I'd allowed myself to believe that the world were made up of two sort of people. The strong...and the weak. And I had thought that me … my family, mother, grandfather...we were strong. But everyone else? Pathetic. Defenseless. Weaklings. But this notion is every bit as ridiculous as believing in pure good and pure evil. But I'd believed it … and in my belief, I saw nothing wrong in ridding the world of those too weak. Those who fell to Scarlet Flame. Strength and weakness come in all forms, shows up in strange and different ways. Father … he is strong. His refusal to kill wasn't born of reluctance, or pity, or weakness. No, it was nothing less than an incredible, astonishing show of will and control. I decided that I'm going to be strong as well. Justice. Not vengeance. Just like father always said. I cast away Scarlet Flame. Felt more than saw it's glittering blade fall, tailing light like splintered diamonds. I looked Deathstroke in the eye and told him, \"No, I'm my father's son too. I'm Robin.\" I walked away from his prone form. To those who are wondering what the heck an Itami Regime is, itami is Japanese for pain (thank you google translate!). So basically, I was trying to say pain endurance training or something of the like. Heh heh. I know I didn't stick too close to the comics, but I've never read them, so meh. How'd I do with Damian's characterization? Did I get him right? Thanks for reading and I'd love to hear from you!

I know it's been a looooooonnnnngggg time but I just wasn't in it at the moment and freshman year takes work and a lot of time so yeah. But anyway, I just had to come back for this one special movie called Cloud 9. Disney channel totally rocked it becuz this movie is the bomb! I've seen it about 10 times in the past 3 days! Coming back to the point, I just couldn't let this inspiration pass me by, so I give you...Willayla! The newest ship of Will (Luke Benward) and Kayla (Dove Cameron). They are just so cute! A special shout out to the best Willayla author out there at the mo, Puppy-Face-Love, a round of applause please! Great job with all the one-shots (check em out people!) and I can't wait for the newest ones! On with the Willayla! Kayla's POV Sam, Dink, Will, and I stood in a line as we watched this chick board down the slope. God, Sky Sailor, why was she so \"cool\" and \"awesome\" and all that crap? Why did she get to be on the Swift team? Why did Nick smile at her in a way he never seemed to smile at me? Ugh. And to make it even better Will just goes on complimenting her like it's the most natural thing in the world. It's bad enough she has Nick falling all over her but Will too? I thought he was different. What happened to substance over style? She finishes her run and Will says the only thing that can infuriate me even more, \"She's good.\" And that just sets me off. \"Don't you think I know that Will?! God it was going to be hard enough learning all these new moves and now I've got her to deal with, which you seem to be paying more attention to her anyway, so why don't you just go coach her Will?! Then you'd actually have someone who had a chance at winning! Well go on! She's got substance and style, which I thought you didn't care about but evidentially I was wrong! I thought at least someone believed in me, someone thought I could do it, but I guess I was wrong about that too! So why don't you, and Nick, and everybody else just go fawn over Sky and I'll just leave you guys alone and pretend that everything is ok like the fake that I am!\" By now a few tears had made their way onto my cheeks and the guys were staring at me in shock. Will looked completely lost at what to say so I just stormed off, wiping furiously at my eyes, telling myself that I would not cry as I made my way back to the lodge. Will's POV What the heck just happened? One minute I'm evaluating Sky's performance and the next Kayla is screaming at me that I should just go coach Sky and that I didn't believe in her, which was NOT true. I watched Kayla's retreating form, still shocked at her out burst. What had I done? I turned to Sam and Dink to find them wearing matching expressions of confussion. Their eyes silently asked me what had just happened and I told them honestly, \"I don't know.\" The three of us turned back to see Kayla slamming the door to the resort closed, snow falling from awning above. \"I-Im gonna go talk to her,\" I said. The guys just nodded and slowly started making their way to the top for a few runs. I entered the lodge and took to elevator to Kayla's floor. At the door, I knocked and patiently waited for Mrs. Morgan to open the door. She didn't even ask why I was here, just pointed up the stairs to Kayla's room and gave me a sad smile. I nodded my thanks and walked up to Kayla's door. I stopped for a second before cautiously approaching her door and softly knocking on it with an even softer, \"Kayla?\" \"Go away,\" she sniffeled. \"Kayla come on, let me in,\" I all but begged. I heard a sigh and the sound of a lock clicking before the floor creaked and I heard her sit back donw on her bed. I slowly twisted the handle and opened the door to find Kayla curled up against her headboard with a pillow clutched tightly to her chest, tears running down her face. I immediately scrambled over next to her and sat down. \"Kayla what's wrong?\" \"Nothing sniff I'm perfectly sniff fine.\" \"Obviously you're not. Come on Kay, talk to me, please.\" She looked up at me with pain in her eyes as she spoke. \"Fine, you wanna know what's wrong? What's wrong is my god dang coach is off praising my competition WHEN IM STANDING RIGHT THERE, and on top of that he's just another guy who doesn't believe in me! That's what's wrong Will!\" She can't honestly think that can she? Of course I believe in her! I believe in her like I've never believed in anything else before! She has to understand that! \"Kayla!\" I grabbed her shoulders and held her in place, forcing her to look at me as I spoke. \"I will always believe in you ok? And Sky? I'm sorry, I was just doing what I do, evaluating the competition. I didn't mean to make you mad. I swear I would never just go and blatantly hand out compliments to her, or anyone as a matter of fact, in front of you or away from you. I'm your coach, no one else's, and I will never leave you, ok?\" There was silence for a moment before she let out a cry and collapsed against me. \"I'm sorry, I'm sorry,\" she sobbed. \"Hey, hey, its ok, shhhhh, its ok, dont cry, I'm right here,\" I whispered, wrapping my arms around her tightly, one completely around her waist, the other around her shoulder blades, my hand stroking her hair. She finally settled down and looked at me, tear tracks still visible on her cheeks. I gently reached one hand over and wiped them away before leaving my hand to rest on her cheek, my thumb sofly drawing circles below her eye. \"Kayla?\" I whispered. \"Yeah?\" \"What was that about?\" She stiffened. \"Nothing, I just, got jealous of you complimenting her that's all.\" \"Come on, you know I know you better than that.\" She looked conflicted, her eyes telling me she was going back and forth on whether to answer the question truthfully. Finally she sighed, buried her face in my chest, and mumbled something I couldn't understand. \"What was that?\" Another mumble. \"Kayla...\" \"I said I was jealous ok?!\" \"I thought I just told you I know you bet-,\" \"Not that kind of jealous! I was jealous because you seemed more into her than...\" \"Than?\" \"Me.\" It was so soft I could barely hear it. \"You? Kayla...\" \"Yeah I know ok? I get it! You don't see me that way and whatever and now I've just totally screwed everything up because it's gonna be awkward forever now and-,\" She had started pulling out of my arms she talked so I made a split second decision and yanked her back down, smashing my lips to hers. She froze for a second before relaxing for the first since I had arrived, gently placing her arms around around my neck. I still had one arm around her waist and I moved the other to the back of her head, supporting her. We broke apart, both bright red, foreheads resting against each other. I was the first to speak. \"I would never be more interested in anyone compared to you. You're beautiful and funny and I love to see you smile. You brighten up my day just by walking into the room. And of course I see you that way, how could I not? I was just scared it was you who didn't feel the same about me.\" She stared at me in shock before putting on her dazzling smile. \"I thought it takes no fear Will?\" she teased. (AN: just go with it!) I smiled too. \"Haha very funny. But are we good now? You're ok? We're ok?\" \"Yeah, yeah I think we are.\" \"Good.\" With that I leaned in once more and kissed her again. So? What'd ya think? Good? Great? Terrible? This is the first of, I will not say many becuz I know that that is just not going to happen, so I'll settle with first of this set of one-shots. I will promise though there will be at least three. Dont forget to check out the other stories, just search will and kayla and select Misc. Movies as the category. There's only a few so dont get too excited, but hopefully there will be more soon! Follow me on tumblr smorelotta and I'll see you for the next chapter! Until then, stay shinny! Luv, Operative CG16[Chapter 2] So how's it hangin my fellow fanfictioners? Are y'all ready for Willayla-ness chapter 2?! (Or Wayla, whatever floats your boat). This next chapter is what would have happened if Will and Kayla had kissed in the pool. Come on, we all know it's what people wanna see :) A shout out to my new bro on this great big web of insanity, WaylaLove16! Give it up for this awesome new author of Wayla-ness! One, you're awesome, and two, you're even awesomer because 16 is my fav number. On with the Willayla! Will's POV \"That sounds impossible.\" Sure Ms. Nothing's Impossible. \"I did it in a practice run,\" I replied. \"So teach me.\" Kayla was drifting forward, and so was I. We got about a foot apart and I slowly started rising out of the water, my shoulders becoming cold, but I didn't care. Kayla's head tilted upward, moving even closer. Her eyes fluttered closed and mine soon followed. We were so close I could feel her breath on my face, sending shivers down my spine. I was just about to reach for her waist and do what I had wanted to do for so long when a voice snapped me back to reality. \"I brought you guys some towels,\" Kayla's mom said. Kayla and I jumped apart, blushing like mad. \"I should go,\" I stuttered, swimming away from Kayla. \"No no, Will you stay. Your mom had to pick up a shift and she asked if you could stay here, not because you can't be by yourself of course, she just wanted you to stay with someone because she'll be working late.\" \"Oh, uh, ok then.\" Well this is going to be awkward. \"Good, well I'll just leave these here and you guys just come out when you're ready and I'll start on food, sound good?\" \"Great, thanks Mom,\" Kayla squeaked. \"Alright, I'll leave you kids to it.\" \"Uh-huh, you can leave now,\" Kayla mumbled, loud enough so only I heard. I heard the door close and I slowly turned back to Kayla. \"Hey.\" \"Hi.\" There was silence before Kayla started cracking up. I stared at her like she had grown an extra head. \"Um, what's so funny?\" \"You're laugh hair laugh is just so laugh...\" \"My hair is what?\" I challenged, smiling slightly. Kayla just giggled and moved her hands in rapid circles on either sides of her head to express what her words could not. I raised an eyebrow and floated back to her, completely forgetting the awkwardness of before. \"What's wrong with my hair?\" I repeated. \"It's just so crazy,\" she managed to get out before collapsing in a fit of giggles once again. \"You love it,\" I teased, smirking. (AN: again, just go with it) \"Yeah,\" Kayla said, sounding serious. \"I do.\" I quickly covered up my shocked expression and replaced it with a smug one. \"Really?\" \"Oh, um, did I say that?\" \"Yeah you did. You wanna explain that?\" \"I uh...no.\" \"Well if it helps,\" I said in a low voice, creeping closer. \"I love your hair too.\" She blushed and smiled, looking down at the water. \"Kayla?\" She looked up at me, eyes wide with innocence. I slowly reached up and tucked a stray strand behind her ear, my hand lingering. \"Will?\" I quickly looked around the room, searching for any possible interruptions before turning back to her. I lightly placed a hand on the small of her back and pulled her up to me. Her hands landed on my shoulders. I leaned in... And Let's Go To The Mall suddenly started blaring from Kayla's phone. (AN: How I Met Your Mother, Robin Sparkles? That's my actual ringtone FYI. And haha you thought they were gonna kiss :P). \"God dammit!\" I yelled. Kayla looked shocked and started pulling away, venturing toward the table that held her cell. \"Not this time,\" I muttered before grabbing her again and pulling her close. You know that feeling in your stomach when you fly through the air? That dropping sensation where your stomach crawls into your throat? And there's a numbness that consumes your every nerve? Snowboarders get that feeling a lot, it's something we have to learn to live with, but this, this was that multiplied by a thousand. My heart was racing, I couldn't think, all I could feel was her lips on mine as I kissed her with all I had. Kayla responded and wrapped her arms around my neck, fingers playing lightly with my hair. When we pulled apart I rested my forehead against, breathing heavy. \"Will?\" \"Hmm?\" \"Why?\" \"Why?\" That took me back a little. \"What do you mean why?\" \"Why'd you kiss me?\" \"Kayla,\" I sighed. \"Kayla, Kayla, Kayla. Don't you get it?\" \"Get what?\" \"I love you,\" I said, staring deeply into her eyes. She looked shocked. \"You...you what?\" \"I. Love. You.\" Her smile was brighter than the morning sun against fresh powder. \"I love you too.\" Now it was my turn to smile as I brought hers to collide once again with mine. We pulled away and she smirked. \"Does this mean you'll teach me the Cloud 9?\" I laughed. \"This just makes me worry even more, but yes, I'll teach you the Cloud 9, I believe in you.\" \"I believe in me too.\" \"Good, if there's one thing I've thought you it's to believe in yourself.\" \"You taught me more than that Will.\" \"I know,\" I whispered, ducking my head down to peck her on the lips for the third time. \"Why don't we go get dried off, I'm hungry.\" \"Sounds good babe.\" \"Babe?\" \"Too much?\" \"Nah, I like it.\" She smiled. We got out of the water, dripping, and grabbed the towels laid out for us. Kayla wrapped hers around herself as I swung mine around my shoulders before taking a hold of her waist and leading her out the door. \"Mom, we're hungry!\" Kayla yelled. \"Got it honey!\" her mom called back. \"Let's go get changed,\" she said, turning to me. \"Ok.\" And as she grabbed my hand and led me upstairs I couldn't help but smile at how lucky I was that this amazing girl was mine. So? What'd ya think? I know it was a little similar to the first chapter but whatever. Hope it met all your standards and stuff, I'll try to have chapter 3 up by the end of the week. Review please! I don't get may so its always nice when someone takes the time to say something. Don't forget to check out my new bro WaylaLove16 and stay shinny! Luv, Operative CG16[Chapter 3] Ok, I know it's been a while, but at least not as long as last time :) Anywho, I did promise at least three chapters and I just watched the movie so inspiration struck! This will be a collection of mini one shots of all the kisses that should have happened but didnt. Thanks to all of u who reviewed, followed, favorited, etc. Let's get started! Kayla's POV Will and I were walking down the street after getting ice cream when I finally voiced what I had been thinking about for the past few days. \"I think you should join our team,\" I blurted out. (AN: Yes I know this isnt how it goes but if it was it wouldn't be FanFiction now would it?) Will stopped and turned to look at me, shocked clearly written on his face \"What?\" I took a deep breath and repeated myself. \"I said 'you should join our team.'\" \"Wha- Kayla, no.\" \"Why not?\" I whined. \"You're amazing and frankly we could really use you!\" \"Kayla, that wasn't a part of our deal!\" \"I know that! But I've changed, why can't you? Come on Will! It's time to get back out there!\" \"Kayla-\" \"Just promise me you'll think about it?\" I said, giving him the puppy dog eyes. He sighed. \"Fine, I'll think about it ok? NO promises.\" I squealed and hugged him, planting a kiss on his cheek. We both froze and a moment later quickly untangled our arms and stepped back. \"I'll um, see you tomorrow,\" I stuttered. \"Yeah, ok, see you tomorrow,\" Will said, just as flustered as I was. I turned and started walking back to my place, just a little faster than normal. Tomorrow was going to fun, not! Will's POV I could barely restrain myself from punching that jerk in the face. How dare he do that to Kayla?! I feel sorry for Nick, having to have him as a dad. Dont get me wrong, I was angry at him too but also kind of glad he did it because now Kayla's in a better place, with me. I tuned back in to what was happening to see Kayla staring at her former coach in disbelief. She looked a little heart broken. All I wanted to do was take her in my arms but I held back until she came my way. When she passed without even looking at me I called out to her. \"You're going for it aren't you?\" She turned and I could the determination in her eyes. \"I have to show them, I have to show that I'm not who they think I am.\" \"You've already done that, and so much more Kayla, you dont have to do this.\" Its not that I didnt believe in her, I just didnt want her getting hurt. Kayla noticed this and stepped closer. \"I'll be ok, I promise,\" I took a deep breath and pulled her to me. \"Ok, just... be careful.\" She looked up at me and smiled. \"I will.\" I nodded and lowered my head to kiss her. She put her hands on my shoulders and I wrapped my arms around her waist. The clock was ticking but I wanted to draw this out as long as possible. We pulled apart, foreheads resting against each other. \"I believe in you,\" I said. She smiled. \"I believe in me too.\" \"Then go get em tiger.\" \"Aye aye captain.\" She turned and made her way up to the top of the pipe. I watched her go, hoping she would be alright but knowing she would pull it off because she's Kayla Morgan, the girl who can do anything. And my girlfriend. Kayla's POV I couldn't believe it. I actually did it! I pulled off Cloud 9! I was smiling like never before was I watched our magnet (AN: I thought the name plates and team names were magnets and stuff on the score board) get put into first place. I felt like I finally proved I was more than just daddy's little girl, which I did. All the sudden I felt something, or should I say someone, slam into me. I laughed as Sam, Dink, and Will wrapped their arms around me and crushed me into a group hug. I flicked my eyes upwards to see Will's head pressed against mine. His smiled widened as Sam and Dink pulled away and he took me in his arms, crushing me to his chest. \"I'm so proud of you.\" I hugged him tighter, whispering my thanks. He pulled back and held me at arms length. I could see what Will's mom meant by his smile being different. When I first met him it was your average smile but now it was brighter, more lively. And so damn cute. \"We did it,\" I said. \"No, you did,\" Will replied before leaning down, taking my lips with his own. My mind went fuzzy and all the lights and noise were not helping. My skin tingled and the shivers were almost too much to take. We didnt realize how long had passed until Will suddenly shook and he groaned in annoyance as he pulled away and glared at Dink, who had shoved Will to get his attention. The guys smirked and I rolled my eyes. \"If you guys aren't too busy with each other, they'd like to give us our trophies now.\" We all laughed and turned our attention back to the guys walking toward us with big trophies in their hands. I couldn't help but smile wider as I stole one last look at Will. I had a perfect run, perfect day, I had perfect friends, and the perfect boyfriend. So? What'd ya think? Please review! It makes me smile! I will try, no promises, to put up more chapters but I am really really busy. Dont be afraid to write your own! If you ever need help or anything, just PM me! I'm always here! Until next time, stay shinny! Luv, Operative CG16 ","Summary":" Hey guys, I'm back! I know it's been a looooooonnnnngggg time but I just wasn't in it at the moment"},{"Movie":"Cloud 9","Title":"Cloud 9 The Cloud 10","Author":"no.1potterhead","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11385237","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Hey guys! This is officially my second fanfiction! YAY! I'm not sure if this is going to be a one shot or not. I still don't know how to post different chapters so it's probably going to be a very long one shot. I'm still trying to get the hang of this so please bear with me! Please excuse my grammar and spelling mistakes because I'm sure I'll have some. I saw Cloud 9 a couple of months after it came out and I loved it! I really wanted a sequel but it never happened. So I decided to write my own Cloud 9 2: the cloud 10 or something like that. I don't really like it when fanfictions mess with the story line so when u read my fanfictions it will always start right where the movie ended. Please enjoy and review! Summary: The Fire and Ice competition just ended! So did the movie. We start off where it left off and see if Kayla and Will end together and if they do how they get together. They also invent a new move. Everything in italics is the same for my Starstruck 2 fanfiction. All the characters portrayed as in the DCOM movie. I don't recommend you read this unless you saw the move. I DO NOT OWN ANY OF THE CHARACTERS. All characters belong to Disney. Starts off where the movie ended CHAPER 1 \"You did it!\" shouted Will as he put Kayla down from when Sam, Dink and he hoisted her up. \"No we all did it\" said Kayla pulling all of her teammates into a hug. They were all so ecstatic that they won Fire and Ice but they were even happier that Will was a part of it all. After they got their pictures taken and got their medals as a team they all went to Hot Doggers to celebrate. \"So what do you guys want to eat?\" Will asked \"Hot dogs!\" Sam and Dink said at the same time. At that moment Donald started growling. \"Don't worry, Donald. It's not made out of dogs. But either way I'm not in the mood for them.\" \"How 'bout pizza?\" Kayla asked. Will immediately agreed while Sam and Dink nudged each other that Will was acting like a loved sick puppy. Kayla didn't notice this but Will gave them a glare saying 'knock it off or I will hurt you.' They immediately stopped because they knew Will was tough and he would definitely hurt them if it meant keeping his secret safe and sound. It dawned on Will that Kayla probably knew he had a major crush on her. Kayla POV \"I'll order it!\" I said and quickly got on my cell and ordered 2 large cheese pizzas. After all, my whole team was three boys and then me. Everyone knows that boys can have a big appetite from time to time. I hung and told the guys the pizza would be here in a little bit. While we waited we started talking about the competition I wasn't really into the conversation since all I could focus on was my appetite. What caught my attention was when Dink and Sam asked me how I convinced Will to teach me the Cloud 9. \"Nothing really,\" I lied. \"No seriously, what did you do to convince him? We need to learn from you.\" \"Nothing,\" I said again, \"I just asked him a couple of times.\" I really did not want to tell them how I did convince him. I didn't want to say, 'I told Will that he was just like those other people in my life who didn't believe in me and he ended up turning around to kiss me to convince me he believed in me.' \"Guys, she just asked me now can we drop the subject?\" said Will. I could tell he was getting a little embarrassed. I could see from the corner of my eye his face flushing bright red. He looks so adorable when he's embarrassed! I could tell that Dink and Sam were enjoying his embarrassment so they kept pushing. Poor Will. \"No, no really how did she do it, Will?\" Sam asked grinning widely. \"She just asked, ok?\" Will said blushing ever so brighter. \"I don't think that's it,\" said Dink, \"I think the forecast had snowy with a chance of steam, if you know what I mean.\" he said slightly nudging Sam slightly. (If you remember from the movie, Dink was obsessed with weather) Sam was now bursting out laughing. I saw Will's face turn the darkest shade of red I have ever seen, and that's dark.\" I thought it was time that they stopped teasing Will. \"Guys, leave poor Will alone.\" \"Alright, fine. You probably were able to convince him anyway because you're a girl.\" Sam said, trying to stop laughing. I just glared at them and they stopped laughing. I turned to Will and saw he was still a little red but not as much as before. I was going to say something to him but then the door to Hot Doggers opened. Pizza was here. Will and I both got up at the same time to get the pizza. Will went right over to the pizza man and I just glared at Dink and Sam. \"You guys be nice to Will. You're lucky he didn't quit just now.\" I whispered to them \"Awe come on, Kayla,\" Dink said, \"We always tease him like this.\" \"Yea! He should be used to it by now,\" said Sam. \"I'll tell you guys how I convinced him if you drop the subject.\" I said glancing at will to see if I had enough time. It seemed like I did, so I quickly told Dink and Sam about my comment and the kiss. They just stared at me like I had two heads and then smiled a devious smile. \"So Will is in love with Kayla.\" Dink said. \"Your Forecast was correct.\" Sam added. \"Remember you guys promised.\" \"Alright, alright. We won't tease him about it.\" Dink said. I sighed relived when Will came back with the pizza. He didn't seem that embarrassed anymore. Will POV I spent as much time away from the team and signing as slowly as I could for the pizza guy. I was so embarrassed. I saw Kayla saying something to them but I couldn't hear what she said. I just shrugged it off and came back to the table. \"Two large cheese pizzas, as ordered.\" I said as I looked at Kayla when I said as ordered. She smiled back at me. \"Alright guys, dig it!\" she said and took her own slice of pizza. We all ate in silence. Thank goodness for that, I didn't get teased at all. Kayla's phone started ringing all of a sudden. She groaned put her pizza down and picked up her phone. \"Hello? Now?! Alright I'll be right there.\" She said and then she hung up. \"I'm sorry guys, I got to go home. Maybe we can all hang out tomorrow and have some fun at the half pipe.\" She said. We all agreed and said bye. Once she left I could see Dink put on a devious smile and whatever his idea was, Sam had the same one because he had the same expression. \"Kayla told us what happened. I mean like how she convinced you. She told us we couldn't tease you about it but she never said we couldn't talk about it.\" Dink said. I sighed. I wasn't getting out of this anytime soon. \"Dude! Why didn't you tell us you kissed Kayla?!\" Sam asked. \"Because I knew I would never hear the end of it! Plus that is between Kayla and me.\" \"Literally.\" said Dink. \"Look you guys are my best buds but I knew I would get teased about this.\" They both sighed and said \"We're sorry man\" at the same time. I smiled. \"It's ok guys but please when you see me blushing bright red, please don't keep trying to embarrass me.\" \"Alright man,\" Sam said, \"but you need to ask her out. It's obvious that you like her and she feels the same way, why would she defend you if she didn't?\" \"Cuz she's my friend, that's why. Look guys, I don't know if I have the nerve to ask her out. What if she says no? I can't take rejection. Plus how do I know she likes me?\" \"This may seem kind of personal but when you kissed her, did she kiss back or pull away?\" Dink asked. \"Why would it matter?\" \"Because, she could have pulled away if she kissed you or if she didn't kiss you back she could have.\" Dink stated. \"I'm not following.\" I said plainly. \"Dink is trying to say that it depends on her reaction when you kissed her. If she kissed back she likes you, if she didn't, well, you know.\" I thought about for a moment, trying to remember the pure bliss of the moment. That's when it hit me. She did kiss back, passionately, even though it was only a few seconds, she kissed passionately. \"She kissed me back,\" I smiled. \"That settles it,\" said Dink, \"you're asking her out. Good luck dude. We expect that she's your girlfriend by the time we meet at the half pipe, if not, you own us twenty bucks.\" Before I could object, Dink and Sam were already out the door. What's the point in arguing with them I thought? I'll just text Kayla tomorrow to meet me here before we go to the half pipe. And with that I went to bed. Kayla POV I woke up to the sound of my cell phone text tone. I slowly stretch and grab my phone from my bedside table. I open the text and read a message from 3 Will 3. That's how I put down his name from my phone. I needed to change that. The message said Kayla, I need to talk to you. It's really important. Meet me at Hot Doggers in 5 minutes. 5 MINUTES?! That doesn't give me much time. I jumped out of bed and changed into my gear and did my hair in its usual braid. I did my everyday make up brushed my teeth and ran out the door with my board. I snowboarded toward Hot Doggers and ran inside right on time. \"Hey Will,\" I said trying to catch my breath. He walked right toward me and instead of say hi back or giving me a hug, he pressed his lips right on mine. I opened my eyes wide in shock but then gave in. I closed my eyes and felt Will beg for an entrance with his tongue. I quickly opened my mouth and felt him exploring every part of my mouth quickly, I did the same. We parted after 30 seconds and stared at each other breathlessly. Will smiled at my confused face. \"What was that for?\" I asked confused yet grinning. \"What? You didn't enjoy it?\" Will asked smiling widely \"I never said that.\" \"Aha! So you did enjoy it!\" Will said excitingly. \"Alright fine I enjoyed it but why did you even kiss me in the first place?\" I asked. \"Because I wanted to ask you something.\" \"What?\" I said curious. Will looked really nervous all of a sudden. He opened his mouth to speak but nothing came out. He just sighed and smiled again this time he started typing on his phone. A second later I got a text message. \"It's from me,\" he said. I smiled but then looked a little petrified. He's going to see that his name in my contacts are surrounded by hearts. I was debating whether to open my phone or not. He looked at me expectantly when he finally said. \"Are you gonna get that?\" I blushed bright read and I shook my head no. \"You were gonna ask me something.\" I said trying to change the subject. Will sighed. \"Open it or I'll open it for you.\" He said. At that I quickly took my phone out and try to change the contact name before he looked over my shoulder. That failed miserably. He saw it and smiled smugly. \"Kayla, why are there hearts around my name?\" he asked grinning his famous grin. Oh no! I'm toast! I tried to act casual. \"What those? Oh um they are supposed to be snowboards I guess they do look like hearts don't they?\" I lied. \"Kayla you're not fooling anyone.\" I blushed profusely and just looked down, avoiding eye contact. \"Hey,\" he said. I looked up expecting to see him holding back laughter that I was stupid to like him. But he was smiling his easy going smile. He took out his phone and showed me my contact. My name was surrounded in more hearts than my two embarrassing hearts. \"Looks like we both like each other,\" he said with a smile. I laughed and blushed at the same time. He smiled at that. I opened the text and I was surprised to see what it said. This is easier to say in a text message than out loud because I'm afraid I'll should stupid and if you don't feel the same way I won't get rejected to my face. I like you a lot Kayla. And I mean like-like you. Heck I'm just gonna say it, well type it. I'm in love with you. Tell me do you feel the same way. Will you be my girlfriend? I just smiled and crashed my lips on his. And this time we kissed longer. Will POV I moved my tongue over and over her lips, begging for an entrance. She opened her mouth and my tongue went shooting in. I felt her tongue go into my mouth as well. I rubbed her mouth with my tongue exploring every possible cranny. She let out a sound of pleasure which made me go deeper into the kiss. I knew she wanted to pull away because I felt her losing her grip on my shoulders. I wasn't going to let go so easily, so I wrapped my arms around her waist even tighter, pushing us closer together. She gripped my shoulders tighter and pushed the kiss even deeper than before. I overlapped her lips over and over again. My arms tightened even more around her waist. She moved her hands from my shoulder to my face. A second later she was running her finger through my hair as we continued. I held on tight as she overlapped my lips with hers. She tilted her head as she continued overlapping my lips and exploring my mouth. I sighed pleasurably hoping that no one came in as we were 'busy'. She tried to pull back and relented, we both need oxygen. The kiss lasted a minute and it was the best minute of my life. I smiled breathlessly. \"So is that a yes?\" I smiled \"Yes.\" She giggled. I heard the door open and I saw Dink and Sam. \"Are you to love birds done and I take it she said yes? You know just asking cuz I could only see you two making out from the street.\" Sam said. Both Kayla and I blushed bright red. \"Let's go hit the half pipe, cuz the forecast calls for fresh powder and love.\" Dink said. \"You guys better not tease us.\" Kayla said. I smiled and gave a quick kiss on the lips. She smiled back. \"Alright let's go to the half pipe.\" I said. I grabbed Kayla's hand and we all head to the half pipe.[Chapter 2] Hey guys! So sorry I didn't update sooner! Well, enough of my blabbing, Chapter 2 of cloud 9 the cloud 10! CHAPTER 2 \" Alright let's go to the half pipe.\" I said. I grabbed Kayla's hand and we all headed to the half pipe. Kayla POV We walked out of Hot Doggers and made our way to the half pipe. \"Dude! I was hoping you failed so we could get the money…\" Dink said sadly. I was honestly confused. What money? \"But my happiness is more important to you guys right?\" Will asked \"Yea sure it is. You owe me five bucks Dink,\" Sam said immediately turning to Dink. Dink sighed and pulled five bucks out of his pocket. He reluctantly gave them to Sam. Will sighed. \"Did I miss something last night?\" I asked slightly confused. \"Yes! I mean no,\" Dink said. He said no when he saw Will giving him a meaningful look. He must have seen that I noticed him because he stopped looking at Dink and started blushing. I turned my attention toward him. \"Is there something you want to tell me Will?\" I asked \"I um uh well um 'sigh'\" Will said. \"Trouble in paradise,\" Dink laughed. I glared at him and he stopped laughing almost instantly. \"Will?\" I asked, waiting for an answer. Will sighed. \"Dink and Sam made a bet with each other. The bet was to see when I would ask you to be my girlfriend.\" Will said. \"See now was that too hard?\" I said. Will started to blush incredibly bright. \"Dude! You sung like a canary!\" Dink exclaimed. \"Kayla deserves to know.\" He said. I smiled brightly at him. \"Enough mussy stuff! Let's hit the pipe!\" Sam said. Will POV \"Alright let's do the same order we always do at practice.\" I said. \"I guess I'm up,\" Kayla said happily. She grabbed her board and went to the top of the half pipe. She strapped her board on and put on her goggles. She gave us a quick thumbs up and then she did her thing. She did a Crippler 7, an Indy, and the Cloud 9. We all cheered as she made her way towards us. She Dink and Sam a high five then made her way over to me. I shrugged as if I have seen better and she pushed me down we started laughing. I pulled her down and when Dink and Sam made their way to help us up we pulled them both down. We all started laughing. Finally I managed to say through laughs \"Am I the only one who wants a quick drink before we snowboard?\" \"Nah I'm kinda thirsty,\" Dink said. \"Me too,\" Sam agreed. \"You guys go ahead and get some drinks I'll wait here,\" Kayla said. \"You sure?\" I asked, not wanting to leave my girlfriend behind. \"Yea, go ahead.\" \"Alright….\" I said unsure. She gave me a quick peck on the cheek and smiled. I smiled as well. We stared into each other's eyes for a couple of seconds before Dink pulled us back to reality. \"Alright enough of the goo-goo eyes because I don't have a goo-goo eyes partner.\" \"You have me,\" Sam said, smiling. Dink sighed in disgust. Kayla started giggling. Man, she is SO cute. Dink. Sam, and I walked over to the lodge to see if we could get something to drink. Kayla POV I watched Will, Dink, and Sam walk to the lodge with a smile on my face. A voice behind me interrupted my thoughts. \"Hey Kayla. I see you're still hanging out with those losers.\" I turned around annoyed. \"What do you want Nick?\" I asked, annoyed. \"Nothing I just think you can do so much better than those losers. You know what I change my mind I want you.\" Before I could reply Nick pulled me into a kiss. And let me say it was the absolute opposite from Will's kisses. It was awful. No POV Will, Sam and Dink were walking toward the lodge which was right in front of the half pipe so they could easily watch her snowboard, much to Will's content. Dink and Sam were talking in line while Will was staring at Kayla's direction. \"Dude! Stop staring! It's creepy!\" Dink said. \"I can't help it. Nick is talking to her and-\" \"Did he just pull her into a kiss?!\" Sam exclaimed. \"Dude! That's YOUR girlfriend! What are you gonna do about it?\" Dink asked. \"I'm gonna give him a peace of my mind.\" Kayla POV I tried my hardest to get out of Nick's grasp and to get out of that kiss. I struggled and then I finally slapped him. He immediately let go. \"OW! What was that for!?\" Nick screamed. \"For kissing me when I have a boyfriend!\" I screamed back. I heard shuffling of snow and immediately knew it was Will. Anger and sadness bubbled inside me. Anger at Nick because he kissed me. Sadness also at Nick because he doesn't have a life and also because of him, Will might dump me! We have only been dating for 15 minutes! I cringed when I felt Will's hot breath behind me but was surprised at his words. \"What do you think you're doing kissing my girlfriend?!\" How did he know I didn't kiss him? I saw Will with an angry expression. I never seen him so mad. He look so made that his face was turning red. \"Your girlfriend? Please! Like Kayla would want to go out with you!\" Nick exclaimed. Ok, THAT was the last straw! \"Excuse me!? What is your problem Nick?! Did Skye dump you?\" I said with mock pity. \"Kayla I'm just saying you can do so much better than Doggie Daycare!\" \"Oh really? Then what's better for you? Yourself? Yea.. about that…I rather break my legs and not be able to snowboard than date you!\" I said harshly. \"Kayla, why are you being so rude? I'm the good guy here!\" \"Oh so the good guy would do all those things you did to me?!\" I retorted. \"Those were orders! I didn't have a choice!\" He replied, almost screaming. \"Everyone has a choice.\" I said. \"Stay away from Kayla… or else,\" said Will. \"Whatever,\" Nick replied, obviously feeling defeated. Nick snowboarded away. I turned to Will and pressed my lips against his. He was obviously shocked because he didn't kiss back till a couple of seconds. \"What was that for?\" Will asked, still holding on to my waist. \"Oh so now I can't kiss my boyfriend?\" I teased. \"No no! You can definitely kiss me I just wasn't sure why you kissed me now.\" \"Well, why not now?\" I asked again, still teasing Will. \"Good point.\" \"Oh so you can tease Will but we can't?\" Dink said appearing behind us. \"Sorry guys, only I can tease him because-\" Will interrupted me. \"Because she's my girlfriend.\" The just rolled their eyes at us. \"Whatever, anyway, we got your hot chocolate, Will,\" Sam said. \"Thanks guys! Now Sam, show us what you got.\" \"K wish me luck,\" Sam said after taking a gulp of his hot chocolate and handing to Dink. *30 minutes later* Everyone had their run on the half pipe and decided to go home. Well, almost everyone went home. Kayla and Will decided to hang out at Hot Doggers for a little while before heading home. I'll update as soon as possible.[Chapter 3] Oh my goodness! I am so sorry I did not update sooner! I've just been really busy with practicing the piano and my Italian lessons. Let me say sorry in advance cuz my cuz (lol) that I haven't seen in forever is coming to visit so I will not be able to update in a while. To make it up to u guys for the long wait, I will try to make this chapter long, but no promises. Ok! ON WITH THE STORY! Will and Kayla went inside Hot Doggers laughing and eating ice cream. They went to the counter and sat on it. After a long pause Kayla finally spoke. Kayla POV \"Thank you for not jumping to conclusions so quickly after you saw Nick kissing me,\" I finally said. Will's face went from his easy going grin to his serious face. \"Kayla, I trust you. I know that you would never do anything with Nick after what he did with you. What exactly happened anyway?\" \"He was trying get me back together with him and called you guys losers and kissed me.\" I said simply. \"That jerk if he tries anything again I will-\" \"Whoa! Calm down there!\" I exclaimed, trying to lighten up the mood. Will just laughed. \"I'm sorry it's just that I worry about you. I'm gonna be completely honest with you, Kayla, since I am your boyfriend. Man, I love saying that.\" I giggled. \"Anyway ever since I became your coach, I was starting to feel more protective over you, more than a coach should. And the thought of you getting hurt scares me.\" \"I will be fine Will.\" \"I know that now.\" I reached in and kissed him. \"Meet me at my house tomorrow at noon.\" I said and left. Sorry guys! I didn't know what I else to write and I know I said I would try to make it longer. I really did try. You guys can't be mad cuz I said no promises. I'll try and update at least one more chapter before my cuz comes. Bye![Chapter 4] Hey guys! I am completely stumped on how to finish this story. Please add in the reviews any ideas you may have and I'll be sure to give you credit! Thanks so much! ","Summary":" Hey guys! This is officially my second fanfiction! YAY! I'm not sure if this is going to be a one s"},{"Movie":"Son of Batman","Title":"Who we are","Author":"Demonic-Purity","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12841067","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Everything in her life was normal, well as normal as it can be since she was found four years ago by Batman when she was seven years old. She was surrounded by debris, the buildings were completely ruined at it looked like there wasn't a soul in the city... because all the people there were swimming in their own pool of blood. But strangely she was unharmed, not even a single scratch on her or her clothes that consisted of a black dress with no sleeves apart from a grey strap hanging around her shoulders with a silver cross in the middle, laces were around her neck and the dress stopped a little above her knees where you could the first one of the black leg belts, there were three on each of her legs. The only thing that could indicate Batman on the girl's state was the dull look in her dark red irises as she was wandering around, completely lost and alone. Seeing the girl in such a state, Batman decided to take the girl with him where she could now live a normal life. At first, she wasn't very talkative and still the dull look in her eyes even after having a home and the three men that were Bruce, Dick and Alfred trying their best to engage a conversation with the child and put her at ease. Bruce was surprised the first time he heard her talk, it was during dinner. Her long blonde hair was combed, her skin proper but she would still wear the black dress and leg belts that Alfred decided to wash everyday. The room was quiet apart from the sound of the silverware when the little girl put down her fork before turning to the three men. \"Rosary.\" She simply said with a soft voice. Bruce and Alfred lifted their head in shock of hearing and also confused of the meaning behind her word. \"Excuse me, could you repeat ?\" Bruce asked kindly to her. \"That's my name, Rosary. Rosary Vossen.\" Rosary replied still in a soft voice and there, Bruce saw something in her eyes... a spark, a spark of life in her dull gaze. After that Rosary walked more into the manor and spoke a little more too, mainly to ask Alfred if he needed help or if Bruce needed her for something. If there is something that they noticed, it is that she has a good memory because she quickly knew her way around and was never lost only after a little time spent in her new home and the fact that she remembered about ùbatman's identity even though she was quite exhausted and thus Bruce removed his mask in the Batcave, believing that she won't remember. They also quickly learned that the girl has a passion for books as she spent a lot of her free time in the library, reading countless of books about anything that she came across. But when Dick came to pay a visit, she would avoid the library to spend all her time with him and ask as many questions as she could, or demanded to teach her something. Rosary Vossen is a calm but kind and curious girl who doesn't really like being in crowds and drawing attention on her which is why Bruce didn't announce publicy that Rosary was his ward. Her life was pretty normal, living with Bruce Wayne, going to school, getting back home, going to her martial arts lessons and ballet lessons. Right now, the bell just rang at the prestigious school that Rosary was attending. She packed her belongings before making her way towards the parking and paying no mind to the others students apart from an occasional wave or nod the the ones biding their goodbye to her. She quickly scanned the differents parked cars to find Alfred waiting for her like always. She made her way to the man that she called a friend and climbed in the car when he opened the door, then the man shut it before going around to the driver's seat, starting the car and driving off to the place that Rosary called \"home\". \"Hello Miss Rosary, how was school today ?\" Alfred asked the girl in the back as he drove. \"Hello Alfred. School was fine, like always. Thanks for asking.\" She told him before looking out the window. \"How is Mr. Bruce ?\" She asked turning away from the window. Bruce told her that she could call him by his first name but she thought that she still needed to show him respect so decided to call him \"Mr. Bruce\". \"Master Bruce is doing fine Miss Rosary but he told me to inform you that he couldn't attend dinner with you because of important business he has to take care of.\" Alfred informed the blonde haired girl who nodded at his words. \"I see, then do you mind if I eat dinner in the kitchen with you ?\" \"Of course not Miss Rosary. You're always welcome.\" Alfred accepted her request immediately which made the younger girl smile softly before she went to look back at the scenery. Arriving at the manor, Rosary went to her room that she tried to keep as clean as possible to not burden Alfred too much before changing out of her uniform and put on a more confortables clothes such as a black and pink striped hoodie along with a white skirt before taking her notebooks and going to the kitchen where she would do her homeworks while Alfred was cooking. After eating she took a bath and then went to bed, Alfred tucked her in like always before switchinf off the light. Later on, the girl woke up, feeling something weird. She rubbed her eyes before going out of bed and wander in the manor, barefeet like she used to when she first came in the manor and dressed in a black nightgown that looked similar to what she was wearing four years ago. She made her way to a secret passage of the Batcave that she opened and began to walk down the stairs. On her way she could hear voices, two of them were known as Bruce and Alfred but the last wasn't recognizeable to her, no matter how hard she tried to remember ever hearing that voice. Finally arrived at her destination, Rosary kept moving and looked up to see Batman, Alfred and a boy maybe one year younger that her that could be mistaken for a younger version of Bruce if not for the green eyes. The three of them didn't notice her as she stopped only a meter away from them. \"Mr. Bruce,\" She began softly and everyone turned to look at her. \"what is going on ?\" The younger version of Bruce crossed his arms. \"And who is she ?\" He asked with a serious yet demanding expression as his eyes never left her, just like a hawk. The girl turned her gaze at him and raised an eyebrow, confused at his scowling face. \"Rosary this is Damian, my son. Damian this is Rosary Vossen, my ward.\" Batman introduced the both of them. Rosary walked up to Damian. \"Hello, I'm looking forward to get to know you and I hope that we can be friends.\" She tilted her head slightly before putting out her hand forward for the boy to shake but he just stared at her hand before looking her up and down and scowled at her. \"I'm not here to be friend with you.\" He replied harsly. She only blinked at his words before putting her hand down and looked at him curiously, still with her head tilted. \"Then why are you here ?\" She asked him. Damian was taken as he wasn't expecting her to react like that but he didn't show it and only scoffed. \"That's none of your business.\" She only nodded like she understood. \"I see. Well, it is still nice to have another child around, it sometimes gets lonely here.\" The blonde girl told him unfazed. Damian narrowed her eyes at her. \"Do not compare me to you, I'm more mature than I look.\" \"How old are you then ? I'm eleven.\" She informed him. \"Ten.\" He replied bluntly before looking at her with a puzzled expression. \"You're weird you know.\" He commented. Batman decided to step in. \"Well I think it is time for the both of you to go to bed. Rosary, go back to your room. Alfred, get Damian settled.\" \"Yes Sir. Right this way Master Damian, Miss Rosary.\" Rosary turned and a few seconds after, she felt someone charging at her so she spun around, grabbed their wrist before kicking their legs and using the fact that they were off balance to push them on the ground to pin them and realize that it was Damian, her long hair was spread like a curtain around the two and she only gazed at the boy with her head tilted. \"I would rather not fight with seeing that I'm not...\" she looked down at her attire. \"dress properly.\" Damian gazed away, realizing the thruth of her words. \"I can see that.\" Then she got out of him and brushed away the dust as the boy got on his feet. \"Where did you learn to fight ?\" He asked her, curious about her, finding her more strange each passing second. \"I take arts martial lessons and sometimes watch Mr. Bruce training.\" She answered him thruthfully. \"So you want to tell me that you learn to fight just by observing people.\" He said suspiciously. The blonde nodded. \"I have a good memory.\" She told him before making her way to her room, following Alfred. Damian stared at her for a few more seconds before beginning to follow Alfred too. The way to their rooms that they discovered was in front of each other, Rosary turned to look at Damian when she was in front of her door. \"I wish you a good night Damian and welcome to your home.\" She told him with a small smile before turning around and entering her room, not letting time to the boy to do anything so he just entered his own room.[Chapter 2] Hello everyone, I'm just doing a quick note to inform you that the story will be written with Rosary mentionned as you because it's easier to write if I also put the intentions/thoughts of the others characters. Well, on with the story ! You were sleeping peacefully until you heard the door in your room making a quiet sound, since your back was facing the door you couldn't see the person coming in. The intruder just looked around like he was intrigued before stopping at the end of your bed, from your peripheral vision you could see the back of Damian, he then proceed to one of your drawers and looked inside without being noisy. You decided to sit up, not pleased by his attitude and crossed your arms on your chest. \"You know, if you wanted to know me better you could just ask me.\" You spoke. He turned around a little startled but tried to hide it. \"Why the sudden interest ?\" You asked as You went to close your drawer. \"Nothing that concerns you.\" He replied sharply. \"Well, you are looking in my stuff, in my room so basically... I would say that it does concern me.\" You reasoned softly. \"Why are you so calm ?\" He asked after some time of silence. You blinked at him. \"Excuse me ?\" \"I just invaded your room and looked through your drawer and you're completely calm like you were unfazed by it, shouldn't you be angry instead ?\" He explained in an annoyed voice. His scowl deepened at your silence when you finally opened your mouth. \"I don't like when I'm angry.\" You answered simply while shrugging like it didn't matter. He looked puzzled by your answer. \"Why ?\" \"I don't see why I should tell you.\" You told him in a blunt tone which sent him off guard but he again, quickly hide it. \"You're the one who told me that you wanted us to know each other better and be friends.\" He reminded you thinking that you would talk by using that. \"If you aren't telling me anything about you then there is no reason to tell you anything about me.\" You reasoned once again, this time with no emotion in your voice. Damian didn't understand the change of attitude from you and decided to leave the room instead. You waited for the door to close before going back to your bed and trying to go back to sleep. Time went on and you still couldn't sleep so you took some clothes, put them on and went to the kitchen. There you could see Damian with Mr. Bruce's grandfather's sword in the garden, doing some figures, you looked at the clock to see that it was 5 o'clock in the morning. \"What does he think he's doing.\" You muttered before going to the garden and watching him. He kept practising, not noticing you and cut the animals shaped plants, you turned to the window to see Mr. Bruce and Alfred, from the suit that he is wearing, Mr. Bruce was going to be off to work at Wayne Industries. After cutting another plant, he finally seemed to stop so you spoke. \"Did you really have to begin that at 5 in the morning ?\" You asked him with a yawn. He turned to you and narrowed his eyes at you. \"For how long have you been here ?\" He ignored your question. \"Five in the morning.\" You rubbed your eyes as he raised a questioning briw at you. \"I couldn't sleep.\" \"And so you decided to watch me.\" He scowled, accusing you. You shrugged at him. \"Where did you learn that ?\" You wondered in a soft voice. \"With the league of assassins. Why are you asking ?\" \"Simple curiosity.\" There was a silence in the air and you walked towards him, your head tilted to the side in wonder. Damian didn't move, curious about what you were doing but still kept his guard up. You leaned towards him and he took a step back. \"What do you think you're doing ?!\" You ignored him. \"It's strange. How can a 10 years old like yourself smell so much like blood ?\" You wondered aloud. The boy was surprised by such a question and narrowed his eyes in suspicion at you as you went back to the kitchen, seeing Alfred cooking. \"How are you Miss Rosary ?\" Alfred kindly asked you. \"Tired.\" You replied taking a plate of bacon and eggs with a glass of orange juice. Damian came a few minutes after and was going to walk away. \"Do you want to eat with us ?\" You asked him He glanced at us for a second before turning his back. \"You can just bring it to my room.\" He told you before leaving as you finished to eat. \"Could you bring Master Damian his breakfast, Miss Rosary ?\" Alfred asked you as he pushed Damian's plate towards you. You stared at each other for a moment then you sighed and took the plate before making your way to the boy's room. You knocked on the door before entering and saw Damian laying on his bed, he lifted his eyes when you closed the door. \"Here's your breakfast.\" You told him. You stayed in his bedroom, looking out the window. \"Why are you staying here ?\" He asked you. \"I have nothing else to do, and maybe we could talk.\" \"Again with your hope to be friends.\" He scoffed. \"I know that you find me strange but don't you think it would be good to have a friend ?\" You asked with a smile. He looked up from his plate to gaze at you with a skepticak look for a few seconds before going back to eat. \"No.\" Was his flat answer. You raised a brow at that. \"We'll see about that.\" You were smiling but your words had a tone of defy in it.

Aquí está la I, la sigue la O Una es flaca y otra gorda porque ya comió Y luego hasta atrás llego la U Como la cuerda con que siempre saltas tu Helena escucha la canción sonriendo, Alfred la miraba por el retrovisor de vez en cuando y sonríe un poco al ver la alegría y la inocencia que representa esa niña, ya que esa niña no solo era una niña pequeña que viene una familia millonaria, es hija de Bruce Wayne quien es el famoso millonario y dueño de las empresas, quien además en las noches es el caballero de la Noche de Ciudad Gótica: Batman Alfred no podía negar que la niña es la viva imagen de su padre, su versión femenina, ella era demasiado alegre justo como Bruce Wayne era antes de que asesinaran a sus padres, pero por desgracia para la pequeña si situación era casi igual. Ella no solamente es hija de Bruce Wayne también es hija de Selina Kyle quien en las noches era Gatubela. Por desgracia ella fue asesinada cuando Helena tenía siete meses, por lo que jamás pudo conocer a su madre. Ella sabe lo que le paso a su madre pero por suerte no busca venganza, solamente desea que Batman atrape a quien se la arrebato de su lado. Por desgracia nadie sabe quien lo hizo. Helena sabe los secretos de su y quiere ayudar pero le da miedo los criminales así que según ella ayuda desde la baticueva comunicándose con él antes de irse a dormir. Alfred se detiene frente a un restaurante y sale para abrirle la puerta a la pequeña quien sale emocionada y corre a los brazos de su padre que sale del lugar para recibirla con los brazos abiertos -¡PAPI!-grita Helena abrazándolo -Hola Helena, ¿Te divertiste en la escuela?-pregunta Bruce acariciándole la cabeza -Sip, hicimos muchas cosas-dice Helena sonriendo Bruce asiente y se levanta para ver a Alfred -Gracias por traerla Alfred, puedes irte a casa yo la llevare más tarde-dice Bruce -Que tengan buena tarde, los espero en la casa-dice Alfred entrando al auto para irse Bruce entra al restaurante con la pequeña, toda la ciudad la conocían como la heredera de Industrias Wayne. Bruce cuida a la niña con su vida, le enseña a pelear para que pueda defenderse y trata de mantenerla lejos cuando es Batman, Lo que no sabían es que sus vidas iban a cambiar para siempre.

Damian found out that it was almost Daphne's birthday from Dick and Alfred's conversation. Well, let's read to know the rest,,, - ( 14/03/2017 ) Her Birthday Twelve-year-old Damian paced around the living room, deep in his thoughts. He was thinking about a certain orange-haired girl. Bruce walked by. He stopped when he caught sight of his son. He called for his butler to come see what Damian was up to as well. \"He seems troubled, sir...\" Alfred explained. \"Yeah, but I wonder what's up...\" Bruce replied in a whisper. He looked around. Seeing Daphne walking to her room, Bruce called out to her. Upon hearing her name, Damian froze. Alfred raised his brows at the boy's reaction. Daphne, in her maid uniform, trotted to Bruce with her wide eyes keeping their gaze on him. \"Can I help you?\" she asked. \"Well, it is your birthday this coming Friday. Is there anything you want?\" Bruce asked. Daphne pondered for a while. She didn't realize that Damian was listening to thier conversation. Alfred smiled at the girl as she thought of what she wanted. She shook her head and decided that she would want a day off the whole day. She wanted to go shopping. Alfred thought it was a good idea. He mentioned that Dick would be glad to go with her. \"He did ask me...\" Daphne mentioned. \"Hmm...he's one step ahead of us,\" Bruce said, chuckling. \"So, a date with Master Dick then?\" Alfred asked. \"Yes!\" Daphne chirped. She excused herself after that. Bruce glanced up at his son. He could sense a dark aura of jealousy coming out from the boy. Damian sank down into his favourite sofa. He sighed, feeling defeated. He called for Alfred. \"Something the matter, young Master?\" Alfred asked. \"Pennyworth, I would like to eat my dinner in my room. Tell her to send it,\" he demanded. \"Alright,\" the butler obliged. After taking a bath, Daphne rushed to the kitchen to prepare Damian's dinner. Lucky for her, Alfred had already taken care of the cooking. She had to deliver it to his room. She sighed. After fixing her hair, she took the tray with Damian's dinner on it and dragged herself to his room. She knocked once and opened the door. The boy was busy reading another book by Charles Dickon. He took a glimpse of her as she place the tray on the table beside the door. \"Is there anything else?\" she asked in a gentle tone. \"Feed me,\" he said. \"Excuse me?\" she was surprised. \"I mean...\" Damian gulped, \"Stay with me while I eat.\" Daphne found it cute when he gulped and acted nervous. She nodded to his request. Damian sat at the table. She served his dinner. As he ate, she looked around his room to see of there was anything to tidy up. He kept his eyes on her, chewing on his food as she did. \"Your birthday is coming up?\" he suddenly asked. \"Well, yes. I'm really excited!\" she said. She covered her mouth after that. She didn't want to sound too happy in front of him because he would be cold towards her all day. He nodded to her words. She excused herself when he was done with dinner. It was Daphne's special day. Dick was already waiting for her by the gate of the manor. He had his rider jacket on, a pair of jeans and sneakers. Damian came up to him with a scowl. He flashed a teasing smirk at the boy. Damian crossed his arms, a little angry. \"Master Dick!\" they heard the familiar squeaky voice. The two rivals turned towards the girl. Her hair was loose and she was wearing a pink baby doll dress and a pair of black knee-high boots. Her smile faded when she saw Damian. She kept her eyes on the ground. Dick chuckled, handing her the extra helmet he had brought. She took it and hesitantly put it on. Damian was still there, eyeing her from head to toe. She felt as if she was doing something wrong. \"Let's get going. We should have a drink before your shopping spree. There's this café Kori recommended for the two of us,\" Dick said. \"Café?\" Daphne looked up at him. \"My treat,\" he smiled. She hopped on his motorbike behind. Damian left to head inside the manor before she could say anything to him. She sighed, holding onto Dick's torso as they set off. \"Did he say anything to you?\" she asked. \"Nope. He just glared,\" Dick replied, chuckling again. \"Hmm..is he angry at me?\" she asked. Chuckling yet again, Dick replied, \"Shouldn't he be angry at me for taking away his gril?\" Daphne hit Dick's back with a pout. He laughs at her reaction. She hugged him tight after that, blushing at his statement. She couldn't say why she was so embarrassed knowing that Damian claimed her as his servant. They soon arrived at a building shape like a large shortcake. A group of kids were running around on the pave way decorated with bricks shaped like crackers. She giggled at the cuteness of the sight. \"Well, this is the place. Kori said you might like the shortcake here,\" Dick explained. \"She knows I like shortcakes?\" Daphne asked. Nodding, Dick replied, \"I told her a lot about you.\" All eyes were on them as they entered. The café was solely made for kids, twelve years and younger. A woman and a teenager greeted them. Daphne wondered how Kori found out about such a place. The woman who greeted them earlier welcomed them with a smile. Her long pink hair was neatly combed. She was wearing a frilly dress. \"What would you like?\" she asked. \"We'll have the finest shortcake you have,\" Dick said. \"A glass of warm milk, please,\" Daphne replied politely. The woman nodded. As she went off to prepare their orders, Daphne looked around again. Dick gazed at the girl sitting across of him. He liked how innocent her eyes were. After meeting her, she became one of the reasons to keep on visiting the manor. He hardly did ever since he became Nightwing. \"So, how are things with Damian?\" Dick asked. \"Not much has changed. He's still cold towards me…\" Daphne sighed. \"He's just not good at conveying his feelings is all,\" the young man corrected him. Before she could reply, a slice of cake was put in front of her. Her eyes gleamed with excitement and hunger. She started to eat her cake. Dick smiled at the sight. He was glad she was happy with him. Done with their short break, Dick took her to her favourite mall. As they were walking, a pair of eyes were following them. They did not notice it at all. Daphne pulled Dick into a boutique. The person in charge greeted them. She smiled, running up to a line of dresses that caught her eyes. Dick sighed, shaking his head. He knew how much Daphne actually loves shopping, but she would never overspend. \"Pick one, I'll pay for it,\" he said. \"Really?\" she squealed. She twirled around the boutique, amusing the other customers. She chose a white dress with pastel green flower petals. After paying for it, Daphne pulled Dick to follow her to a bookstore. She bought a book about magical creatures. Dick treated her to another drink. He suddenly felt a cold stab when he attempted to feed her a spoonful of cake. When lunch time came, Daphne decided to head back to the manor. She promised to have lunch with Bruce. \"Would you like to join us?\" she invited. \"I guess I should,\" Dick replied. They got to the manor. Alfred had already served the food. Bruce was waiting for the birthday girl. Daphne rushed upstairs to put the things she had bought in her room. She was surprised to find Damian on her bed, waiting for her with his arms crossed and an angry face. Daphne backed away as he stood up. She kept her gaze away from his eyes. He kept on staring at her. \"I-Is everything alright?\" she asked him. He took out a small box. Daphne tilted her head to the side, confused. She could see a tint of red on both of his cheeks. \"H-Hap…\" he mumbled, looking away, \"Happy birthday.\" \"Is this…for me?\" she asked, looking at the box. He nodded rapidly. He shoved the box into her hands and ran out of the room. Daphne opened it to find a necklace with a capital 'D' as a locket. She smiled to herself, cherishing what she had gotten. Thank you…[Chapter 2] for my second shorts, happens a week after Dahlia left Daphne to Bruce and Dick. Damian would always request Daphne to stay with him until he falls asleep. Well this tells how he takes Daphne on a date. This has a little OOC Damian - ( 20/4/2017 ) First Date Dick arrived at the Wayne Manor right after Damian had called him. He was irritated because it was his weekend with Kori. The word urgent brought him here in an instant. Damian was waiting for him in the dining room. Alfred was with him. Dick turned to the butler who replied with a shrug. He sighed, approaching Damian. The seventeen-year-old looked with stern eyes. \"What do you want?\" he asked. \"Grayson...w-where...\" he started, gulping, \"Where should I...\" \"Stop stalling, Damian,\" Grayson scolded him. \"Where should I take Daphne out to?\" he blurted, covering his mouth immediately. Alfred and Dick laughed. Damian covered his face because he was embarrassed. His cheeks were beat red. The older male couldn't stop laughing. Damian had the guts to sleep with Daphne but can't even ask her out on a date. Daphne peered when she overheard the loud laugh. Damian caught sight of her. He looked away immediately. \"Master Dick, why are you here?\" she asked, walking up to them. \"Daphne, perfect timing!\" he said, stifling his laugh. \"Don't say anything, Grayson!\" Damian warned him. Alfred chuckled, earning Daphne's attention. \"Master Damian has some things to discuss with Master Dick,\" he lied. \"Oh...\" she muttered. \"Daphne...\" Dick pulled her, asking, \"What do you think of Damian?\" Daphne froze at the question. She blushed furiously, staring at the floor. Damian slapped his forehead before covering his face again. He did not want to here her answer or rather, he was scared of hearing it. The orange-haired was playing with the hem of her skirt. She did not know how to respond. Dick smiled, patting her head. \"I can see the answer...\" he remarked. \"What?\" Daphne stuttered. \"Damian here wants to take you out,\" he said, smirking. \"Grayson!\" Damian shouted angrily. Before Damian could punch him, he was already out of the manor. He shouted a good luck and went off. Alfred excused himself after patting the girl's head as well. Daphne glanced up at Damian who froze in his seat. He could not say anything. She chuckled to herself. It was not her first time seeing him that way. She bowed, walking away from him to complete her chores. \"Wait,\" he called. \"Would you like anything?\" she asked. \"Tomorrow, we go to the mall,\" he muttered. It was like an order than an invitation. Daphne formed a smile and nodded to him. He told her to get back to work. Once Daphne was out of sight, Damian slammed his right cheek onto the table. He groaned at his stiffness towards his beloved. He wanted to be more loving and caring but was still having a hard time to do so. He hated himself. Bruce passed by and saw how troubled his son was. \"Are you alright?\" he asked. \"What do you usually do at the mall?\" he asked his father. Smiling, Bruce replied, \"Girls love to go shopping there. You can take her to the movies and the game centre, but I guess you guys are older now...\" Damian groaned again. He regretted for making a promise with her. He didn't know the first thing about dating. He just wanted to see her smile for him and because of him. Meanwhile, Daphne was busy preparing dinner. She contemplated on what to wear on her day out with Damian the next day. Alfred smiled at the girl, satisfied that Damian was complying with his feelings towards her. \"Alfred, what do you think I should wear?\" she suddenly asked. \"Your favourite blouse and skirt would do. Your boots as well,\" he suggested. Daphne nodded to his words. \"I don't know what is going to happen tomorrow. He ordered me to go with him...\" she sighed. \"He has his own way for everything, Miss,\" the butler remarked. Daphne fixed her hair into loose curls. She dabbed on a pink lipstick and faint blusher. Then, she put on her black knee-high boots. Her skirt was above her knees. It would make her look taller. She brushed her pink blouse a few times. \"Are you done yet?\" Damian asked. \"All done, Master Damian,\" she replied, standing up. She opened her door to find Damian, leaning against the wall. He was in his black turtle neck shirt and black pants like always. She sighed in disappointment. He raised a brow at her reaction. \"I'm comfortable in these. It doesn't matter to you what I wear,\" he replied coldly. \"I guess...\" she mumbled. Alfred drove them to the mall. Damian was having a hard time digesting what was happening around him. Daphne waited for him to move. She tilted her head to the side when she saw him looking around. \"Umm...should we get going?\" she asked. \"Hmm. What should we do first?\" he asked her. Daphne gawked at his question. She replied, \"There is one place I think you would love to go.\" She started walking ahead. Damian looked curiously at her and followed her. They reached a bookstore. It was his first time, so Daphne explained to him about the store. He found it interesting to buy books. \"So do you always come here if you go to the mall?\" he asked. \"When I feel like it. There are other things around here that I love to check out,\" she explained. \"Let's go there,\" Damian said. A few young teens passed by and brushed Daphne's skirt. The girl blushed, inching closer to Damian. He fumed up when he saw that the teens were laughing and giggling at what one of them just did. Daphne shook her head as a sign to not get into trouble. He sighed, pulling her hand and exiting the bookstore. Damian took her to a craft shop. There were a lot of handmade dolls. The girl's eyes sparkled with excitement. He was glad that she had forgotten about the incident in the bookstore. She chose a small doll to buy. \"I'll pay for it,\" he offered. \"T-Thank you...\" she muttered, biting her lower lip in embarrassment. Damian nodded to her and handed her the Robin doll. She hugged it close to her before placing it into her sling bag. She suggested that they should have lunch. The boy chose a restaurant that he was attracted to. A few couples were there too. The orange haired kept her gaze on the menu while the black haired looked around in confusion. \"Why are they acting that way?\" he asked her. Daphne did not know whether she should laugh or scold him. She sighed at his naivety. \"They're snuggling and feeding each other...b-because that's what c-couples do...\" she whispered. \"Oh...\" Damian raised a brow. They ordered their food and ate quietly once it was served. Daphne glanced up at Damian once in a while. He was watching two lovebirds sitting two tables away from them. She shook her head at his behaviour. He suddenly shoved a spoonful of pieces of lamb chop in front of her. She stared at the food. \"Eat it,\" it came out like an order as always. Blushing faintly, Daphne obeyed. \"Thanks...\" she muttered. \"How does it taste?\" he asked curiously. \"It's good enough,\" she replied, confused. \"I thought it would make it taste better if the guy feeds the girl or vice versa,\" he mumbled. Daphne blushed furiously this time. She looked away from him and chuckled. Damian wondered why she was laughing. She apologized, assuring him it was nothing. They split the bill for the food and went to see a movie next. The boy decided on a horror movie. \"Is this okay?\" he asked her. She nodded. \"I think I will be fine...\" Throughout the movie, Daphne jumped at her seat a few times. Damian held her hand to soothed her. He cringed when her grip tightened around his. He glanced up at her. He tensed up when she abruptly wrapped her hands around his arm, muffling her scream. She's scared but she's willing to comply... The movie ended but Daphne was still shaking. He decided to take her to a boutique to distract her. She was happy, playing around with some of the dresses, trying on a few gowns. The salesperson seemed to enjoy dressing her up because of her small stature. She told her to try on more designs. Damian sat on one of the benches, waiting for her. \"M-Master Damian...\" she suddenly called. \"What?\" he asked. He looked up to see Daphne in a wedding dress. She pulled at the waist, waiting for him to respond. Damian gazed at the girl in front of him. Her hair was neatly tied into a ponytail. The salesperson even gave her a matching hairband for her to put on. The mermaid dress was beautiful on her. \"How do I look?\" she asked, blinking eagerly at him. Shaking his head, he replied, \"It's too revealing. Go and change back.\" Daphne sighed. She dragged herself back to the fitting room. Of course, he doesn't like it... Damian was still a bit dazed. Daphne was a beauty but he didn't want to admit it. He shook his head and silently scolded himself. -skiptime- \"Thank you for today, Master Damian...\" Daphne said as they stepped into the manor. \"Hmmm... I have a request,\" he started. \"Hmm?\" the girl muttered, tilting her head to the side. \"From now on just call me by my name...\" he ordered. \"I can't do that... You're the young master. I even called my brother, Master Dick...\" she insisted. \"It's an order,\" he said sternly. He walked passed her. Daphne pulled the hem of his shirt. He turned around to see her red face. \"D-Damian...\" she muttered, squatting out of embarrassment, \"I can't! I just can't!\" Dick and Bruce made an appearance. \"Hey, the lovebirds are...back?\" Dick held his excitement. He turned to Bruce who shrugged. The two young adults were frozen like a doll. Daphne was blushing while Damian just stood there silently. Dick pulled his sister into her hug. \"What did you do to her, Damian?\" Dick demanded. \"I did no such thing!\" Damian shouted defensively. \"What 'such thing'?\" Bruce asked in a stern voice. Damian gulped and replied, \"Nothing! Hey, Daphne, tell them!\" Daphne hid her face behind Dick's arm. She was still trying to recover from her own embarrassment. The boy gulped when he saw how red her face was. Bruce stood right behind him with a serious look. \"You've got some explaining to do...\" he muttered to his son.

Just have to write a fanfic. Chapter 1 NPOV Weeks passed since the Fire and Ice competition. Kayla and Will had started to date; Sam and Dink were still trying to date Kayla's friends. Nick and Skye broke up, since she left and went back to her original home town. Kayla had become friends with Nick, and noticed he really needed support. \"We may not be dating, but I'm your friend. I'll still support you with your…dad.\" Kayla said as they walked to school. \"He's been ignoring me ever since I spilled everything at the competition. You'd think he would learn from it.\" Nick sighed. \"He's a bad father, I know. My dad didn't believe in me until the competition. Do you enjoy snowboarding?\" \"Yes, it just isn't my dream to win every competition. I honestly don't care for the wins; just want to have fun doing something I love. He has to come and ruin it, every single time. He forced me to break up with you, forced me to get you kicked off the team, and wanted me to do something to you or your father during the competition. That is when it ticked me off, to hurt others. That isn't me.\" Kayla's heart sank for the guy. She did still slightly love him, but she loved Will even more. She realized though, the more she hung out and talked to Nick, the more she wanted him back. She still fell more in love each day she hung with Will. When they got to school, they split and went to their classes. Will was usually in her first class, and realized today his seat was empty. Concerned, she texted him. After class she checked her phone, \"Sick today, won't be coming in.\" was his text. She frowned but went to her classes and lunch. The whole day went by slow. Her friends were on vacation in Florida. They wanted her to come along, but she had another big competition in two weeks, and she had a huge test Friday. They wouldn't be back till the week after next. She wanted to go though. She walked into Hot Doggers, and smiled. \"Hi, Mrs. Cloud. How's Will feeling?\" she asked. \"Oh, he has the flu. Not feeling the greatest.\" She replied. \"Aw, could I go see him?\" \"Of course! You have the house key.\" They both laughed before she left. When she got to the house, she unlocked it and walked in. she then walked up to Will's room. When she opened the door, Will was lying on his side. He was sweating and shivering at the same time. She felt horrible for him and gently touched his shoulder. He looked at her and smiled. \"Hey.\" He said in a hoarse voice. \"Hey, so you have the flu, huh?\" she asked as she sat beside him. \"Yeah, it'll pass in a few days.\" \"Well, I'll mother you until then.\" \"Hey, I have enough from my mom.\" \"Oh, but one mother is not enough.\" She teased. Will sighed and she smirked. \"I win.\" He chuckled before getting into a coughing fit. After Kayla calmed him down, she ran and got some ice chips. \"Here, suck on these.\" He took the cup and started to suck on one ice chip. She spent the rest of the day there before going home. When she got home, her mother was sitting on the couch and eating chocolate covered strawberries. \"Cravings for them, again?\" Kayla asked, taking one. \"You have no idea.\" Her mother replied, smiling. Kayla couldn't help but feel excited for her soon to be baby brother. Her mother was worried though. \"Honey, you do this baby will require most of my attention, right?\" her mother asked. \"Well yeah, he is a baby.\" Kayla smiled. \"Well, yes, but you wouldn't mind if you had less attention?\" \"No, I'm never really home anyway. Besides…I'm kind of used to it.\" She then bit her lip, it slipped out. Her mother looked at her, worried. \"Used to it? We haven't paid much attention to you, oh my gosh…oh my gosh…\" her mother rambled. \"No! You guys have paid enough attention to me! I'm spoiled! That is from a lot of attention!\" Kayla reassured her. \"Are you sure?\" \"Yes, I meant I'm used to not a lot of attention from Nick…when he dated Skye and after I was kicked off the team.\" She lied. \"Oh, okay.\" Her mother calmed down and continued to eat her strawberries. Kayla relaxed as well. Truth was her mother and father never really spent time with her. They would only let her spend their money on things she wanted, just to shut her up. Her father was mostly about business, and her mother was all about her decorating job. That's where she gets her styling from. Her mother. They both had jobs, and both paid more attention to them. She was used to it, and only hoped they would show good attention to the baby. ~ 1 week later~ Will was better and was back in school. Kayla was always spending time with him and Nick. She could still sense some hatred between the two teens, but ignored it. She only tried to get them to like each other, enough for her not to feel uncomfortable around them. She couldn't help but feel stressed each day. Her mother was pregnant and due any moment, her boyfriend and friend both hated each other, she has so much homework to do, and a competition to practice for. She needed a breather, but didn't want Will and Nick to murder each other. When she got home, she brought her attention to style. She designed patterns, and made her own clothes. Her mother had taught her for the past three months. Making sure she knew she loved her before the baby came. After three hours, she walked downstairs. Only to see her parents rushing out and evident pain on her mother's face. \"Honey, we'll be gone for quite a bit. Okay?\" her father said. \"What's wrong?\" Kayla asked. \"I think it's time for the baby.\" Her mother gasped. They shut the door and left, leaving a stunned Kayla behind. She frowned and sat down on the couch. Author's note: Okay, first chapter is rough. : but please review, follow, and/or favorite! Hope you liked it and sorry for any mistakes and if the characters are OOC :([Chapter 2] Author's note: Thanks for the review and private message Here's chapter 2 and glad you enjoyed it! I'm taking any tips from reviewers. :D Chapter 2 NPOV It was six hours later when her father called. Telling her it was a healthy baby boy, and that he had blue eyes and brown hair. Kayla congratulated them and talked for a bit. Her father was in a rush to see the baby again and to be with her mom, so she hung up and went to bed. She didn't eat anything for dinner that night, but she wasn't really hungry. The next morning, she slept in until nine. Relieved it was a Saturday. She looked at her phone to see a text from Will. \"Snowboarding today at ten?\" he texted. \"Sure.\" She replied. After hitting send, she got dressed and walked downstairs. She was about to say good morning to her parents, but remembered they weren't home. She thought her father would be home, but she had a feeling he wanted to stay with her mother. So instead, she made herself a bowl of cereal and grabbed a glass of milk. After finishing breakfast, she grabbed her gear and walked down to the half-pipe. Will, Dink, Sam, and Nick were all standing there talking. It was more Dink, Sam, and Nick talking. Will was standing there, obvious anger in his eyes. Kayla rolled her eyes and walked up and hugged her boyfriend. \"You okay?\" she asked. He smiled, \"Yeah, I'm fine.\" \"Well, then lets snowboard!\" They spent four hours snowboarding, a few falls here and there but nothing major. Kayla was enjoying her time when she spotted a familiar face. She wanted to scream when she recognized Skye. She nudged Nick. \"Looks who's back.\" She whispered. Nick looked in her direction and sighed, \"Skye. What is she doing here?\" \"How should I know?\" \"What's wrong?\" Will asked. \"Nothing.\" Both answered. \"Okay…well let's get back to shredding some snow.\" \"How about we have a mini competition?\" Dink asked. \"That sounds awesome!\" Sam replied. \"Alright, sounds good to me.\" Will piped up. \"Okay.\" Nick said. \"Sure.\" Kayla added. ~2 hours later~ Kayla was laughing while Nick made funny faces, enjoying the time with her ex. Will kept glaring at them the whole time, but eventually talked to Dink and Sam. After they were done lunch, they split to go home. After Kayla waved goodbye Will grabbed Nick aside. \"Could I talk to you?\" he asked. \"Sure.\" Nick replied, his voice emotionless. \"Am I not allowed to talk to my girlfriend at lunch?\" Will growled. Nicked scoffed at him, \"Jealous much?\" \"Haha very funny. No, I just want to be able to talk to her.\" \"Right, that's why you glared at us. I know when a guy is jealous. I don't mind if you talk to her, but it's pretty obvious.\" \"What?\" \"Kayla is falling for me again. You better enjoy your last moments of being her boyfriend. It's going to be soon that she comes crawling back to me.\" \"Yeah right. All you're going to do is hurt her again!\" \"I've learned my lesson, I would never hurt Kayla. That wasn't even me, my father made me!\" \"You had the choice to step down and refuse to do anything to her, but your head was into the competition and winning. I didn't want her to get hurt doing the Cloud 9, but she did it. I had faith in her. All you ever did was lie to her and bring her down.\" \"I cared about her too! I'm the one who warned you if she got hurt it would be all on you. That's why you didn't want her doing it, you didn't want the blame on you. You knew her father would come after you, if anything happened to his little girl.\" \"You mocked her the whole time, lied and then dated Skye!\" Nick was about to say something when Skye walked up. \"You two alright?\" she asked, smiling. \"Skye?\" Will asked, turning around. She grinned, \"Hey handsome.\" \"Hey.\" Nick smiled. \"Oh, hi Nick.\" She growled. Nick glared at her and Will and then grinned. \"Well, you can talk to Will. I have more important things to do.\" With that he walked away, grinning to himself. He had just what he needed to break Kayla and Will up. Skye rolled her eyes. \"He's such a drama king, so how's life been? How is Kayla?\" \"Good and fine. Why?\" \"Well, no need to get snippy. Was just being polite.\" \"I wasn't getting snippy.\" \"Please, you just snapped at me. Should I say down boy? Man, hanging with those dogs is turning you into one.\" Will glared daggers at her, \"Why don't you shut your trap and bother someone else.\" Skye sighed, \"Calm down. I was just teasing you, Kayla can do it. Listen, I really like you and…I want to hang with you some more. Would that be okay?\" \"No, I have a girlfriend.\" Will turned his back on her and walked away. Skye glared at him, biting her cheek. \"You'll regret that.\" She hissed before turning and heading back to her house. The next day, Kayla woke up to a text from her father. \"Will be home soon, to pick up some fresh clothes. Don't mess up the house, and don't get into any trouble.\" She closed the text and was about to get dressed when Nick texted her. \"Will you tell your boyfriend to lay off? He's been getting snappy with me, and it's starting to bother me a bit.\" She stared at in confusion, but had a little spark of anger in her. With all the stress with grades and her new baby brother, she didn't need Will causing anymore. She groaned and grabbed her clothes. She skipped breakfast and marched right over to Hot Doggers. She walked in to see Will finishing bathing Bruce. Will turned and smiled, but frowned when he saw the anger in her eyes. \"What's wrong?\" he asked, concerned. \"Why are you being rude to Nick?\" she snarled. \"Whoa, getting defensive?\" he teased. \"I'm not joking, William.\" She replied, using his full name. He sighed, \"I only asked if I could talk to you at lunch too.\" \"We always talk, what is wrong with me talking to Nick?\" \"Nothing, just would like to talk to you during lunch.\" She rolled her eyes, \"Nick and I barely talk as it is. I like spending lunch joking with him, he's my friend. No need to get all jealous over it. You're still my boyfriend.\" \"Yeah, and you're falling for him.\" He snapped. \"Excuse me? Are you really losing that much faith in me? I'm not falling for him.\" \"Please, Kayla, I can see it in your eyes! You're enjoying his company, you're always gazing at him like a love struck puppy, and you're always talking and joking with him. Even during school. You'll ignore me sometimes!\" \"Because I don't always want to talk to you! All you talk about it snowboarding! He likes talking about other things. We've known each other longer.\" \"Oh, so I'm boring?\" \"No, why do you always do that?\" \"Do what?\" \"Take words out of my mouth? First the freak accident thing, and now this. Gosh, you're so annoying sometimes!\" \"Then maybe you should leave!\" \"Fine!\" \"Fine!\" Kayla stomped her foot before walking out, slamming the door behind her. Will groaned and sat down, staring at the ground. Kayla was crying as she walked back home and called Nick. \"Hello?\" Nick answered. \"Hey, it's Kayla.\" She replied. \"Kayla, what's wrong? Are you crying?\" \"No, I'm fine. Will and I just had a little fight. That's all.\" \"Want me to come over?\" \"Nah, want to meet at the half-pipe? Snowboard for a bit?\" \"Sure.\" \"See you there.\" \"See ya!\" She hung up and grabbed her gear. While she walked there, the fight played over in her head. It was a stupid fight, but she had so much jealousy, anger, and stress pent up inside that she was ready to crack. She didn't though, knowing she needed to stay calm and not start any drama. Or it would stress out her mom. When she got to the half pipe, Nick was standing there. He hugged her and smiled. \"You're tense, you need to relax a bit.\" He said, rubbing her arm. She smiled, \"Yeah, guess I do.\" Will watched from the window in the shop. He glared at them but then brought his attention to the new customer. Skye smiled as she walked through the door. \"Nick and Kayla back together?\" she asked. \"No, they're just friends.\" Will replied. \"Well, why can't we be friends?\" \"Because you're rude and stuck up. \"Like you never were? Could we just start over? Please?\" Will stared at her for a second before sighing. \"Fine.\" She grinned and started talking to him. After a while, they were laughing and sharing funny stories. Kayla walked in and looked at Skye. \"You're back?\" she asked. Skye smiled, \"Yeah and enjoying time with your boyfriend. You looked like you were having fun with Nick.\" She noted. Out of jealousy, Kayla smiled. \"I was, he's such a jokester. Well, Will's mom wanted me to tell him that she'll be working late tonight.\" Will nodded, \"Thanks.\" \"No problem, now you and Skye enjoy your evening together.\" She snarled before leaving. Will rolled his eyes and was about to go after her when Skye grabbed his wrist. \"Don't, let her have some space. It's good for us girls.\" Skye said. \"You don't want to bother a girl who's angry and needs some space.\" \"Fine.\" Will agreed and sat down. They spent the rest of the evening talking. Kayla sat in her room, crying. He didn't try to stop her, he didn't run after her and explain everything, he didn't even say sorry. He just stayed there, talking to her worst enemy. She sobbed into her hands, stress taking its toll. She wiped the tears away and grabbed her snowboarding stuff. She had a competition to practice for. Author's note: This may be only 5 or 6 chapters, maybe less. depends on how long my chapters will be. Anyways, sorry for any mistakes. I tried adding some more Will and Nick interaction. Don't know if I did a good job. Please review, fav, and/or follow! :D Also, I know, I kind of threw Skye into there. But I needed her for this chapter and I guess it didn't go as smooth as I was hoping. Hope you enjoyed! :D[Chapter 3] Author's note: Thanks for the support and here's chapter 3! Enjoy! :D Chapter 3 NPOV Kayla walked down to the half-pipe to see Skye and Will snowboarding. She clenched her jaw, unsure if she should snowboard. She hid behind the wall of the half pipe and watched. They would fall and laugh, and do some amazing tricks. Jealousy was burning in her heart, but she ignored it as she kept on watching. After thirty minutes, her legs cramped up. She winced as she moved them, to get the blood moving in them again. She then heard laughter and looked up. They were standing on the flat, laughing. \"That was some weird fall!\" Will laughed. \"Shut up! You've done it before!\" Skye joined in. \"Did not!\" She smacked him lightly on the shoulder before looking at him in the eyes. Will stared at her, wondering what she was doing. Before they knew it, they were kissing. Kayla wanted to scream at him, smack him, and most of all, run. And so she did, she ran away leaving her snowboard on the ground, forgotten. Tears stained her face as she ran back to her house. Once she got in, she slammed the door and broke down. She sobbed loudly, her heart shattered. She heard someone run in and looked up to see her father. \"Dad?\" she asked. \"Came home to get some clothes for your mother and to wash up…what happened? Are you okay?\" he asked, concerned. She sniffed, \"Fine. Just…going to bed.\" She whispered. She ran upstairs and closed her door, locking it. She threw herself onto her bed and sobbed loudly into her pillow. Her father wanted to go and comfort her, but felt like she needed to calm down. So he decided he would drop off his wife's clothes and then come back to make sure she was fine. He dialed his wife's number and waited for an answer. \"Hello?\" his wife answered. \"Hey, I'm going to drop off your clothes and then come home. Kayla is sobbing upstairs, and I don't know why.\" He said. \"Oh my gosh! I hope she's okay, you stay home. I can wait for my clothes tomorrow. Or actually, my sister can come and pick them up. I don't want Kayla staying there alone.\" She exclaimed. \"Alright, are you sure?\" \"Yes, you need a break anyway. I'm fine, Hayden is fine, just rest and be there for Kayla.\" \"Okay, love you, bye.\" \"Love you too, and tell Kayla I love her, and bye!\" After he hung up he walked upstairs and knocked on his daughter's door. \"Kayla? Can I come in?\" \"Sure.\" She said. He heard the door unlock and opened it. Kayla walked back to her bed and sat on it, staring at her hands. He sat beside her and wrapped an arm around her. \"What's wrong?\" he asked. \"Will and Skye…th-they kissed.\" She whispered. \"What?\" he gasped. \"They kissed…she stole him from me…\" \"Honey, I'm sure he got caught up in the moment. I did it before in front of your mother by accident. But she forgave me, because she loved me. And I did truly love her, if I didn't I wouldn't have married her! And I wouldn't have you as a daughter!\" \"I know, but…it hurts.\" \"I know, I hurt your mother badly by doing that. But there are going to be bumps in a relationship, and if you guys can get through that then you're truly meant for each other.\" \"Thanks dad.\" Kayla said, smiling a little. He hugged her, \"Anything for my baby girl.\" She returned the hug before grabbing a pair of pj's. \"I'm going to go to bed.\" \"Alright, I'm going to bed too. Well after your aunt picks up your mother's clothes. And your mom says she loves you.\" \"Love her too.\" He walked out and closed the door, before walking back downstairs. Kayla got dressed and then lied down in her bed, pondering on her father's words. Her heart was took broken to consider forgiving him, so she didn't do anything. She just turned off her light and went to sleep. Will said goodbye to Skye before grabbing his snowboard. He was walking out of the half pipe when he spotted something. He walked over and picked up the snowboard. He gasped when he realized who it belonged to. He ran to Hot Doggers and grabbed his cell. He dialed her number and called. After four times, he texted her. Saying sorry, and hoping she didn't see that kiss. He didn't mean to, he just got caught up in the moment. He sat down and sighed, holding the bridge of his nose. \"She's going to hate me.\" He whispered. ~Next Morning~ Kayla woke up to see four missed calls and one text message. All four calls were from Will and so was the message. She opened it and read it. \"Hey, Kay. I'm really sorry, I was such a jerk to you. I shouldn't have yelled at you, and should have ran after you when you walked out. I wasn't thinking. There is nothing going on between me and Skye. \" Angered she texted back, \"Then what was that kiss last night? Huh? Just caught up in the moment? You know, you hurt me way worse than Nick ever did. I was better off with him!\" She sent it and threw the phone on her bed. She then broke down in tears again, not wanting to go to school. So, she got back into bed and went to sleep leaving a note on her door telling her father she wasn't feeling well today. Sure enough, her father got the note and didn't bother her. He only peeked in to make sure she was fine. After he was sure, he grabbed his car keys and left a note on the table. Explaining he was going to the hospital to visit her mother. Will woke up and got dressed and ate breakfast. He grabbed his bag and his phone. On his way to school he read the message Kayla sent him. His heart broke. He refused to let the tears go that were in his eyes. He wiped them away and shoved his phone in his pocket. ~6 hours later~ Kayla heard a knock at her door and walked downstairs. When she opened it, there was her snowboard and a letter. She picked both up and closed the door. She lied her snowboard down on the couch and opened the letter. \" Dear Kayla, I'm sorry about the kiss. It meant nothing, and yes I did get caught up in the moment. I know, I hurt you. If you're…better off with Nick, then so be it. If dating him would cause you less pain…then go ahead. I won't date Skye, I don't like her like that. She's not the one for me, I thought you were…but I don't want to hurt you anymore. Love, Will\" Tears slowly slipped down her cheeks. She sank into the couch, and stared at the ceiling. Not knowing what to do. She regretted sending that text, she could see in the letter that she just broke his heart. She didn't want that for him. She then got dressed and ran down to the half pipe. Hoping he would be there. She was sad when she only saw Skye and Nick snowboarding. Nick noticed her and ran to her. \"Hey, I heard about the whole…Will and Skye thing.\" He said. \"I know, but where is Will?\" Kayla asked. Nick shrugged, \"Don't know. Hey, if he keeps hurting you like this…then tell me. I can take care of him for you, and- Before he could finish a loud cracking sound, sounded. They all turned to see an avalanche heading towards the slope. Skiers and snowboarders started running from the slope, towards the café. Kayla was stunned as the snow tumbled off the mountain. Nick grabbed her and ducked behind counter in the café. After ten minutes of shut eyes, and hands over heads, they all stood up. The avalanche didn't reach them, luckily. A man came running over. \"Is everyone okay?\" he asked. They all nodded, \"Good, I need helpers. There are people trapped under the snow on the slope. Any volunteers?\" Kayla instantly stood up, having a feeling she knew where Will was. She also had a feeling Dink and Sam were under that too. Nick and Skye volunteered with her, and a few other people. They all dug through the snow, finding a few people. \"Found one! She's about five, not breathing!\" someone shouted. \"Alright, start doing chest compressions!\" an adult ordered. Kayla dug through the snow like a crazy woman, wanting…needing to find Will. An idea swam into her mind as she raced down to Hot Doggers. She ran in to see Mrs. Cloud calling Will. \"He's not answering..\" she whispered. \"I need Donald and Bruce.\" Kayla said. \"Sure, take them.\" She took the two dogs and lead them back to the slope. Both dogs started sniffing and digging. One of the girls saw her and ran to get her German Shepherd, who was a trained rescue dog. She nudge Kayla. \"Great idea.\" She whispered. Kayla smiled, \"Thanks, got anymore trained dogs?\" \"No, but my dad has five at the station. Want me to shoot him a call?\" \"Yes, that would be awesome!\" The girl grabbed her phone and dialed her father's number. Ten minutes later a car pulled up, as three German Shepherds and two Rhodesians jumped out. \"Whoa, Rhodesians!\" Kayla gasped. \"Yeah, they're mates. We have their puppies, which are only two weeks old! Rose, the smaller one, can't be here long. She needs to feed the pups soon.\" \"That's fine, thanks.\" The girl nodded before getting back to work. Kayla noticed Donald digging. She ran over and helped him, she uncovered Sam's face. She dug the rest of him out and helped him up. \"Sam? Can you hear me?\" she asked. Nick ran over, \"I'll help him, find Dink.\" \"What about Will?\" \"What about him?\" Kayla wanted to punch Nick for being so stupid, but walked away. Bruce howled loudly, causing Kayla to rush over. Relief filled her when she noticed Will's snowboard. She dug through the snow, along with Bruce. She wanted to cry when she found Will. She quickly got the rest of his body out and started chest compressions. After five minutes, Will coughed. His face twisted in pain as he coughed. \"Hey, calm down. You're okay.\" Kayla whispered. Will's eyes fluttered open, and blinked. \"K-Kay?\" \"Hey.\" She grinned. He smiled but then tried to get up. He winced and held his mid-section. \"I-I think my ribs…\" he gasped and fell back down. He paled and clenched his jaw. Kayla ran her fingers through his hair as she called over to an EMT. Two came rushing over. Two minutes after, Will started having trouble breathing. \"Collapsed lung.\" The one said. \"How?\" Kayla asked, fear paralyzing her. The one EMT looked at her and smiled, noticing her fear. He gently pulled her aside. \"One of his ribs must of stabbed a lung, we can fix it. He has some blood in his helmet, I'm pretty sure he has a concussion. He'll be fine though. Just need a helicopter to get him to the hospital quick enough.\" He explained. \"Do you have one?\" she asked. \"I have to call, it'll be ten minutes.\" \"Why wait that long when my dad has friends who can be here in two?\" He grinned as she called her father's friends. They ran back over to Will, as he started to panic. Kayla instantly calmed him down, stroking his cheek. Soon enough, a red and white helicopter appeared and landed next to them. Kayla studied it. \"How did you two manage to get a hospital one?\" she asked one of her father's friends. \"We have many different types.\" One of them answered. They loaded Will up and took off. The lead EMT said most of the people under the snow only need chest compressions and some Advil for headaches. \"We need children's pain medicine, for the younger ones.\" He announced. Two older women walked over with three boxes each, of Children's pain medications. They handed them to the EMT who gave it to people who needed it. Kayla helped search for more people. They found Dink and Sam, who only had headaches. There were two more people who had broken bones. The one girl, who was about fourteen, broke her wrist and sprained her ankle. Her younger brother, who was twelve, broke two ribs and may have collapsed a lung. Mr. Morgan's friends did come back to take the two to the hospital. The search continued for the rest of the day and through the night. Luckily, they had a log that listed how many people were currently on the slope when the avalanche happened. There was a total of twenty, and they found fifteen so far. At two in the morning, they found the last five. One got stuck under a small tree, the other three were just buried. It took a little longer to get them breathing, but fourtantly they got them breathing. They sent them to the hospital just in case. Kayla went to the hospital at two thirty, hoping Will would be out of surgery and awake. When she got there, a nurse lead her to his room. Mrs. Cloud was sitting there, waiting for him to wake up. She smiled at Kayla. \"I owe you.\" She whispered when she sat beside the mother. \"Nah, the best award is knowing he's okay.\" Kayla smiled. They both sat there, waiting for him to wake up. Author's note: Hope you liked it! Sorry if it's rushed and confusing…and for any mistakes![Chapter 4] Author's note: Here's the next chapter! Sorry I kept you waiting, thanks for the amazing reviews! And favs and follows Chapter 4 NPOV Will woke up to see Kayla and his mother sitting in the chairs by his bed. Confusion took over only for a few minutes, before remembering why he was in the hospital. Kayla was sound asleep, while his mother was reading a book. He smiled. \"Morning.\" He croaked. His mother glanced up and grinned, she shook Kayla. The blonde teen woke up and blinked a few times. Staring at Will in a daze. Both Mrs. Cloud and Will laughed. Causing Will to go into a coughing fit. \"Will! You're up!\" Kayla gasped. \"Now you realize?\" he chuckled. \"Shut up…I was half asleep.\" \"Well, now that you're up…the doctor needs to check on you. I'll be back in a few minutes.\" His mother said as she walked out. \"How are you feeling?\" Kayla asked. \"My ribs hurt…I have a busted lung…a concussion…almost like the last time I got hurt while snowboarding.\" \"You're going to go back to snowboarding…right?\" \"Of course!\" They sat there in awkward silence for a few seconds, \"About my last message…I didn't mean it. I was just hurt from seeing you two kissing…and was upset…\" \"Kayla, its fine…I shouldn't have let Skye kiss me. I have an amazing girlfriend that I don't want to lose.\" Kayla teared up as she hugged Will. \"I was worried I was going to lose you….after the avalanche…don't scare me like that again. When there's an avalanche…run. Okay?\" \"Okay…is Sam and Dink alright?\" \"They're fine, will be snowboarding in a few days. When are you getting out of here?\" \"I don't know, it's up the doctor.\" ~3 weeks later~ Will lied in his bed, tired and feeling little aches. His ribs were almost healed, and so was his concussion. His lung was fully healed, and he was breathing on his own. Kayla visited him daily, making sure he was fine. Sam and Dink also visited him, and promised Kayla next time they would run from the avalanche. \"Are you going to snowboard again?\" asked Sam. \"Yeah, I'm not going to get badly injured every single time.\" Will replied. \"That's good…because…Kayla is a scary coach.\" Dink said. \"Is she?\" \"Well, they need to work harder.\" Kayla smiled. After four more weeks, Will was back in school. Skye would give jealous glances as Will walked down the hallway with his arm wrapped around Kayla's shoulder. Nick tried getting back together with Skye, but the teen wanted nothing to do with him. Will walked into his last class, which he only had with Skye. She grinned as she guided him to the seat next to hers. \"How are you feeling?\" she asked. \"Fine, been better.\" Will replied. \"So, want to hang later on? Now that you and Kayla aren't together.\" \"We're still dating, I'm not losing her.\" \"Right.\" Skye glared out the window, but then grinned as a plan sunk into head. \"Kayla won't be an issue soon.\" She thought to herself. After school, Skye searched for Kayla. She was just shutting her locker when Skye grabbed her wrist. \"Kayla, heard you and Will are back together.\" She said. \"We never broke up.\" Kayla growled before turning her back. \"What? Still angry at me? Why don't you grow up already?\" \"Excuse me? The one who needs to grow up here is you, running around and stealing boyfriends. Is that all you're good at besides snowboarding? Being a whore?\" Kayla snarled. Skye stood there in shock before pushing Kayla down the steps. Kayla groaned as she sat up. A few students stopped and helped her gather her books and stand up. Kayla winced at the dull ache in her left ankle. She glared at Skye. \"What was that for?\" she snarled. \"Calling me a whore.\" Skye retorted. She lunged at Kayla and grabbed her by the throat. \"Listen closely you little bitch, Will is mine and only mine. You'll break up with him and stay away from him forever.\" \"In your dreams.\" \"Get off of her!\" a boy shouted. Skye let go of Kayla as she turned. Sam and Dink were jogging down the steps. Sam glared at Skye. \"Leave her be, Will loves her not you.\" He mumbled before grabbing Kayla's bag. Sam and Dink walked with Kayla towards Will's locker. Skye stood there, boiling with anger. She didn't know what caused her to get so violent, so fast. She liked it though, she liked seeing the fear in Kayla's eyes. She may be a talented snowboarder, but she didn't know how to defend herself besides smart comments. When the next day rolled around, it was the final day for Kayla to practice for the competition. Skye decided to enter last minute and was practicing on the style slope. Will, Sam, Dink, and Kayla all practiced on the half pipe. Doing many different stunts. By now, Will and Kayla nailed the cloud 9. Teaching Sam and Dink was hard, but they refused to give up. Will was angry at Skye for attacking Kayla like she did. He now veered away from her, and sent her side glares. Kayla had a small bruise on her back and a sprained ankle from falling down the stairs. Nick hadn't said anything, but only hung with Skye. Clearly annoyed that Kayla didn't want to date him. \"So, how's your back?\" Will asked as they walked to the café. \"It still hurts, since it is fresh…but I can deal with it.\" Kayla replied. \"Are you sure you want to do the competition, with a sprained ankle?\" \"I'm fine, I'll get it checked after.\" \"Alright.\" Will had a feeling that something bad was going to happen tomorrow, but he ignored it. Thinking he was just being paranoid. But he was about to find out, he was wrong. Author's note: Sorry it took so long! It's a bit rushed, but I'll fix it later. Sorry it's short and for any mistakes!

She was wearing a black high necked tank, denim cargo pants, black combat boots, and the black bandanna. The Horned Bandit carried a sword, and battle ax, with a small dagger. She could see he had been crying. She opened her arms. Not sure if the boy would trust her, but he embraced her. Sobs came from Damian as he clutched her. Kate stroked his hair rubbed his back. \"Sshh, I'm here. You can trust me.\" She soothed Damian did trust her. He did not know why but he most certainly did. He was still sobbing but it quieted down a little. Using her wings, she wrapped them around him. \"Sshh it's going to be alright,\" she whispered Looking up into soothing black eyes he began to calm down. \"Please...\" He begged quietly, \"don't... don't leave.\" \"I will not.\" She promised, \"come, let's go back to my home.\" She said, scooping him up and flying off. Being eighteen, Kate did have a small apartment. They came in through the window. The place was very nice and modern, but had a comfy feeling. Damian looked up at the girl. \"What is your name?\" He asked She looked down at him, \"my name is Kate Breeze.\" She replied removing her bandanna and brushing back the bangs over her left eye to just above her eyebrow. \"I know you're the Boy Wonder, and all so you don't ha-\" \"Thank you.\" He said. \"You need some clothes?\" She asked \"Yes. That would be great.\" Damian said quietly. She walked into her room and returned moments later with black sweat pants, and a blue hoodie with a white shirt. \"There is one other pair if you these don't fit.\" She said He looked up. She had changed as well. But only in moments she changed to black sweats, a green shirt, and a grey zip-up hoodie. No wings or horns either. \"Wh-Where did you get these?\" He asked \"Oh, they're just old clothes my friend left here awhile ago, he doesn't really wear them at all...\" She said \"They're my size.\" Damian stated \"They're from a few years ago.\" Kate explained. Damian went and slipped them on and returned to the eighteen year old. She sat upon the couch. \"Robin, why are you here from Gotham?\" Kate asked \"My...mother. She died and now all I have left is my father. I just don't think I could mourn in the same way he does... I was trained to be an assasin, but he helped me change.\" She knew he was holding back tears. But he couldn't remove the mask. She got up once more. And returned with a small box. \"Here, these will change the coloration of your irises. That way I do not know who you are.\" Damian thanked her and went to put them on. They didn't hurt, thank heaven. Damian returned with brown eyes. \"Do you want something to drink?\" She asked He nodded. \"Tea. With brown instead of white sugar, in a china cup.\" He said She nodded and went to the small kitchen. She fixed them both tea and they sat in the floor. \"So, Robin, why did you come to me?\" She asked Damian set his saucer and tea down. \"I honestly didn't mean to. I came here thinking there was not hero here, I rarely call out for help... but I needed it.\" Kate nodded, \"I understand. I lost my parents to a bomb. I was the one to escape my planet... but fate happens for so many reasons.\" She says Tears streamed down his cheeks. She leaned over and embraced him. Eventually, he fell asleep from exhaustion and she carried the small boy into the spare bed room. \"Good night,\" she whispered and tucked him in. Damian woke up the next morning to the smell of eggs and sausage. He got up and walked into the kitchen. He sat down at the table. \"Good morning, Kate.\" He greeted \"Morning, Robin. Did you sleep well?\" She asked setting a plate of food infront of him. \"Yes. Thank you.\" He said and began to eat. The front door opened. \"Hey, Babe, sorry I didn't get home last night I-\" the voice stopped. The guy, that had just walked through the door, stopped at the sight of Damian. \"Oh, my god,\" he whispered. \"When were you pregnant?!\" He asked \"What?\" Kate asked \"The kid's like ten!\" He went on \"Wh- dear god, Noah, I WAS NEVER PREGENANT!\" Kate said Noah was tall and blond. He wore a jean overcoat and a black shirt, black jeans, and nice shoes. \"Oh, sorry, my bad.\" He said 'That's Kate's boyfriend?' Damian thought, 'very suspicious.' He say across from Damian. \"So, what's your name, bud?\" Noah asked \"Nate.\" Damain replied \"Well, Nate, you didn't do anything while wasn't here, right?\" Noah said \"No. I only got here around two this morning.\" Damian said glaring up at him. Noah glared back. Damian knew something was up. He just knew there was something not right going on. Later that day, Kate took Damian shopping for some clothes. Damian had told Kate he needed a little time away from Batman. She said he could stay with her as long as he likes. They even bought a few things for his room. \"Kate?\" He asked. \"Yes?\" She asked. \"Oh! Before I forget, should I call you Nate? I know it's not your real name, but should I?\" She asked \"Yes, if that is what you wish.\" Damian replied. \"And, do you ever get a little suspicious around Noah?\" She sighed. \"Yes. I have,\" she said sadly Damian's eyes narrowed. It's time he paid Noah a visit. A few nights later, Damian waited until Kate was fast asleep. He knew her senses were keen and he had to be super stealthy. He saw Noah and followed him. Turns out, he walked into another building, not far from Kate's. Damian used x-vision goggles to follow. Noah walked into an apartment and there was another girl inside. They started to kiss, then things got dirty. Damian whirled around ready to tell Kate. But the dragoness was also a master in stealth, and was standing behind the Boy Wonder. Her eyes let go a few tears and she sighed. \"K-Kate I-\" \"Thank you, Robin.\" She said. Kate kneeled down next to Damian. \"You mean more to me... much more than him.\" She said to him Damian embraced her and she returned the hug. Pulling back, she smiled faintly, and placed her lips on his forhead, like his mother used to. \"Let's go home, Robin.\" Kate said with a smile. The next day, Noah opened the door to Kate's appartment to a totally pissed off Damian starring into his soul. Damian had been up for hours training as normal, them returned to Kate's place. \"Hey, Nate, wha-\" \"Leave.\" Damian ordered. \"Dude, just because you showed up one day and she's letting you stay here doesn't mean you can boss me around like you're a dictator.\" Noah stated \"You hurt her. You don't deserve her!\" Damian told him angrily \"No I-\" \"Yes. You did.\" Damian said, \"I followed you and used some tech to know exactly what you are up to. You. Don't. Deserve. Kate.\" \"I didn't do anything! Tell him, Kate!\" Noah yelled Damian felt her place her hand on his shoulder. \"I stand with him.\" Kate said lightly squeezing Damian's shoulder. \"I was there.\" \"You hurt her. Now I hurt you!\" Damian yells and runs at Noah who had started to run when Damian finished his threat. Damian chased Noah out of the building and returned to Kate who had began to let tears drop slowly, with small sighs. \"I'm sorry, Kate.\" Damian whispered \"It's not you're fault, Robin.\" Bruce made up his mind that he would let Damian comeback when he wanted to. \"Bruce?\" Selina's voice echoed. \"In here.\" Bruce told her Selina walked behind Bruce and kissed his cheek. \"So, where's Damia?\" She asked \"Gone.\" Bruce said simply \"Where?\" The Cat inquired \"Anchor City.\" Bruce replied. \"That far? He must have been exausted!\" Selina gasped \"Probably. But with his training he probably found shelter and food.\" Bruce said, \"I'm not forcing him to return. I will go to him when I think he is ready.\" Two weeks later, Damian and Kate were on patrol and everything seemed to be fine. When they had gotten home, taken showers, and changed clothes, there was a knocking at the door. Kate opened the door and saw Billy Batson in the door way. \"Hey, what's up?\" He asked Billy a head taller than she, and he had big blue eyes, and in her secret mind's words, perfect black hair that reached just above his eyebrows. \"Nothing, thanks to the Boy Wonder, I saw the truth about Noah and we broke up...\" Kate said Billy was absolutely Kate's best friend. Since she started the hero gig, Billy had been crushing. \"Oh, I'm sorry.\" He said hugging her She burries her face in his chest and small sobs were heard from the girl. \"Sshh, Kate.\" Billy said rubbing her back. Damian saw the two. He didn't feel funny or against Billy, which was good. \"Kate, just to help, I can take you out for a walk or something tonight.\" Billy suggested, then he gasped alittle. \"What is it?\" Kate asked \"Wh-Who is that?\" Billy asked gesturing to Damian. \"It's Robin. He called out for help and I delivered.\" She said smiling Billy smiled. \"So, stupid and totally awful messed u-\" \"What is it?\" She asked gently \"I-I need a place to stay. And as you know my uncle is... dead. So could I-\" \"Yes, of course you can.\" Kate says Billy smiled. \"Thank you so much. I'll help pay if you want.\" \"No. It's fine. It's like two-hundred dollars a month.\" Kate said \"no biggie. This place is great and super cheep too.\" \"Are you sure?\" \"Possitive, Billy.\" Night came, Kate, Billy, and Damian all went for a walk. Damian was staying far away to give them privacy, but also listen to make sure she was okay. Damian and Kate went on patrol that night and returned home with ripped costumes. \"Give it here, Robin, I have to wash it, then repair it.\" She said he nodded and ran to his room for a shower and so did she. Bruce and Selina have been hanging out. Maybe alittle too much. She's moved in and he's okay with it. He was coming to get Damian soon. Another week passed. Billy and Kate have been getting along greatly with Damian. He loved it there but knowing Bruce, he would have to leave soon. Over a week Kate and Billy have gotten together. Which Damian wasn't against. Every night he's go to sleep while Kate and Billy slept in the master. There was a knock one night. It was Batman. Bruce Wayne. Bruce had brought Catwoman. \"I am here for Robin.\" He said Kate held back tears and nodded. \"Robin?\" She called \"Yes?\" Damian asked. \"It's time to leave.\" Damian had already packed his bag. \"Wait, may I have a moment with Kate?\" He asked Bruce Bruce nodded and shut the door. Billy, Damian, and Kate sat on the floor \"I'm not going forever.\" Damian promised. \"I'll visit. I swear!\" She smiled, \"I know you will.\" She said and kissed his forhead. \"Robin, I want you to make me two more promises.\" Damian nodded. \"Don't forget us.\" She said \"And, don't grow up too fast.\" Billy said He smiled and nodded once more. Hugging them both he left with Bruce. Damian looked out the window of the BatWing. He had found a young girl with a terrible boyfriend and he had been her comfort. He came to her for comfort when he lost his mom. She was like his mother now. He loved her and she loved and cared for him. She helped him and he helped her. He's the son of Batman and now the son of a Dragoness. \"I love you, Kate.\" He whispered. Of course her keen hearing him say it. \"I love you too, Robin.\" She whispered with a small smirk. AN: continue or no? Please reveiw! Thanks![Chapter 2] AN: Okay, so this is like an Alternate way to play out Batman vs Robin with the Horned Bandit and Shazam. So I got inspired after watching this.

Damian Wayne hasn't seen Kate and Billy in months. And after tonight's fiasco he totally plans to sped the night at the least. The Boy Wonder jumped down from the window in his room at Wayne manor. He made his way across the lawn and stopped abruptly to see a glimpse of the electric fence Bruce had set up to keep him inside. Narrowing his eyes at the electric fence, he stepped back and set a small device on the ground before the electric fence. The small machine made a small 'whirling' noise and disabled the fence. Slicing through the now useless fence, Damian made his way to the wall. After he had scaled the wall he met an unfriendly sight on the other side of the useless fence. \"You knew I was going to sneak out?\" Damian asked with anger clear in his voice. The whites on Batman's cowl narrowed at the tone Damian had used. \"Yes. After tonight's fiasco, it wasn't hard.\" Bruce snapped. \"Where do you think you're going anyways?\" Clenching his hands into fists, Damian replied to the Dark Knight. \"So see her. It's been months.\" Damian answered truthfully to has father. \"Definitely not after tonight's events.\" Batman stated sternly. Now clenching his teeth as well, Damian began walking towards Batman. \"I'm going to see her. She's my family too now.\" Damian spat. Damian pushed past Bruce. \"If you get into trouble contact me.\" Bruce ordered his son. Glaring at the ground as he walked, Damian grumbled. \"Fine.\" There was a knock on Kate's door on a Saturday night. Billy was in the shower as he had just came home from 'work'. Her birthday, or 'hatching day' as they called on her planet, had occurred only three days ago and she was now the age of nineteen. She opened the door and laid eyes on the ten year old boy who had stolen her heart four months ago. He was dressed in his Robin get up and mask. She was slightly shocked to see him. Kate quickly got him inside her apartment and as soon as he was in, she embraced him tightly in her arms. \"Robin!\" She exclaimed as she let him go. \"You're here! Is something wrong? Is Bats okay?\" Kate began asking the boy many questions. Finally he had to make her be quiet enough to get a word in. \"Kate. Everything is okay. Alright? And yes. Batman is okay. So no need to worry there.\" Damian finally said breaking her streak of questions. At that moment, Billy stepped into the room with wet hair and a t-shirt and sweats on. \"Hey, Robin, everything okay?\" He asked the boy standing in front of Kate. \"Yes. Everything is okay. I just came to visit.\" Damian said quickly. From that statement, Kate knew something was up. He said that one statement too fast. Which meant something was up that she needed to know. She made Damian tea just the way he likes it, and they all sat down for a movie. After the movie, Billy headed down the hall to his and Kate's bedroom. Kate, herself, walked down with Damian to his room at her apartment. After he was dressed and ready for bed, she sat down on the side of the mattress. \"Hey, what's wrong, Robin?\" She asked naturally concerned for the boy she had learned to love. For a long moment, he didn't say anything, he merely starred at the ceiling for a while without blinking. Finally, he said something. \"You don't have to call me 'Robin'.\" He stated to her. \"My real name is Damian. Damian Wayne. My father is Bruce Wayne and the Batman.\" He sighed a little. \"Tonight, we faced off against the Doll Maker. He had been abducting kids and turning them into dolls he controlled, claiming he loved them. And I nearly killed him. But I didn't. Bruce's voice stopped me. However, someone else did. Ripped his heart clean out of his chest. And Bruce saw the batarang in the snow next to the dead corpse. He thought I did it.\" Kate pursed her lips together, but said in reply. \"Do you know how I got this scar?\" She asked him as she gestured to her left eye with the large scar upon her face. Damian shook his head. \"No, but how does that have anything to do with Bruce not believing me?\" The Horned Bandit chuckled a little at his question, but seeing the puzzled look on his face caused her light laughter to come to a stop. \"Damian, what do you think gave me this scar?\" She inquired the boy. Damian thought for a moment. \"You fought some lizard thing and it gave you that.\" Damian motioned to her scar. She smiled. \"Not quite.\" Kate said to the boy. \"When I came here 3 years ago, at the age of fifteen, a double decker bus hit me. When I flew into the air, from the collision of the bus, my face hit the corner of the concrete on an interstate. The sharp corner nearly took my eye out, but it left me with this scar instead.\" Kate explained. Damian sat there in awe. He didn't expect her scar to be an accident at all. But here she was, telling him exactly how she obtained her scar that was so famous in this city. \"Oh...\" he mumbled. \"Now let me apply this to tonight's events with Daddy Bats.\" Kate said. Damian gave a slight smirk at the nickname she had just given his father. \"Things aren't always as they seem. And I know that you fighting, alongside the legendary Batman, probably know that. The point is, you may feel as if he doesn't trust you, and maybe he does. Like when I landed on the pavement of the street, I trusted I wouldn't get hurt, and look at what happened instead of my assumption. It's the same thing, just the opposite of your issue. You can trust Batman, but if you do, you walk blindly through water.\" Damian nodded slowly. He knew for certain he trusted Kate. Ever since he met her, he knew she would always stand by him. \"Okay...\" He muttered as he laid down in the soft sheets of the bed Kate had on the bed. She smiled at him, leaned in, kissed his forehead, wished him goodnight, and closed the door with a light click noise. Damian closed his eyes and slowly drifted off to sleep. That night, he dreamt of the owl suited man he had seen only hours ago. The man was chasing Kate. She was running from a bloody body that was laying the snowy ground. It was Billy's body. The owl man had killed Billy. Killed Kate's love, and now he was trying to kill her. She ran away from him, but they soon engaged in a battle. His razor sharp claws against her strong willed battle ax. She had tears streaming down her pretty, silver - scaled, cheeks. Finally, the owl man killed her with the claws he barred on his hand. He removed his mask and Damian saw something awful. It was him, but older. He had just killed the girl who had cared for him when his mom had been killed, the girl who had loved him with all of her heart. He, Damian Wayne, had killed Kate Breeze, the last FlashWing, and her lover, Billy Batson, Shazam. Damian woke with a jolt and a yell. He had wet eyes and tears streaming down his cheeks and sweat upon his brow. The thing is, Damian Wayne did not cry. At all. Not over a broken leg, exhaustion, and especially not bad dreams. But that wasn't a bad dream. It was a nightmare. The door to his room swung open and in stepped Billy and Kate. Kate rushed to the left side of Damian, and Billy rushed to the right side of him. Kate sat on the small space between him and the edge of the bed, while Billy kneeled next to him. \"What's wrong, Damian?\" She asked worriedly as he leaned into her, resting his head on he chest. He remained quiet for a good bit, while Kate rested her chin on the top of his head, and her fingers ran through his hair. Billy had now done the same as Kate, joining the two on the small mattress. Finally, Damian spoke. \"You...\" More tears streamed down his already damp cheeks. \"You... b-both of you... died.\" He managed before gulping and finishing, \"And I...I'm the one who... murdered you.\" He whimpered out before pressing his face to where his head laid on Kate's chest, and cried quietly as he got a grip on her frame, not wanting to let her go. This caused her tank top to become damp, but she didn't mind. Billy scooted over due to the shifting Damian did in order to get closer to Kate. She now had her other arm wrapped around him, resting her hand on his back. \"Ssshhh...\" She hushed as a few sobs were heard from the Boy Wonder. \"It was just a dream. You're not going to do that, Damian.\" Kate hushed. Billy came to his girlfriend's aid. Wrapping his arms around her and resting his forehead against her own. \"Hey, Damian, it's okay. We're fine.\" He assured the boy they were comforting. \"We're going to be fine.\" Billy promised. They fell asleep like that. All three of them holding onto each other. Damian awoke to the smell of Kate's perfume. She was still holding him like she had late lest night. Billy had gotten up and was in the kitchen, cooking. He noticed a blanket covering him and Kate. Damian assumed Billy had placed the soft cover on his girlfriend and himself when he had risen that morning. Slowly, he saw Kate's eyes flutter open. She was slowly waking up. \"Damian?\" She asked with sleep still in her voice. He looked up into her obsidian, black eyes. \"yes?\" \"Are you okay?\" She asked concerned. She saw him nod. \"Good. We're going to Wayne Manor. I asked Bruce last night if it was okay if me and Billy stayed for a few nights. He said it was fine with him.\" Kate informed him. Damian's eyes widened, and he tried to protest, but Kate was stubborn as a mule and she would have none of it. When Damian walked into Billy and Kate's room, he saw everything was packed and ready to go. Later on that day, they piled into Kate's car with their belongings and headed off to Gotham City. When they arrived, it was later at night, but Alfred faithfully greeted the trio with happiness and care. Bruce's POV: Bruce sat at the table with Samantha. They were having a nice conversation, until Samantha caught a glimpse of blood red hair, and the Boy Wonder. She didn't say anything about it, but she was a little suspicious. Bruce had no clue Kate, Damian, or Billy were present in his house. But when he went to show Samantha his idea's for Gotham's future, he saw Damian passed out on the couch with a book open on his chest. Bruce had seen him but Samantha had seemed to not. \"Rather than focus on the demons and the darkness, and all that's wrong with Gotham, something I've been guilty of for too many years,\" Bruce told Samantha. \"It's time to focus on how exceptional this city is, and how much better it can be. Will be tomorrow. But before we can build it, we have to dream it. And luckily, I have the imagination d the capital to do both.\" He saw Samantha smirk as him a little. \"And all they write about is the billionaire - playboy.\" She tutted. Bruce smirked back at her slightly, \"Not to worry,\" Bruce half joked, \"He's in here too.\" The duo went in for a kiss, but as soon as their lips met, Damian made a loud snoring noise, slowly sat up, stretched his arms with a yawn, rubbed the sleep from his eye with a small groan, and said: \"I was reading; must've fallen asleep.\" He looked up at the two a still a little sleepy \"What's-What's going on?\" He mumbled. Samantha's eyes widened slightly in surprise. \"Oh, and -um- who might this be?\" She stammered slightly. Damian got off the couch with the book in hand. \"I'm Damian,\" He introduced himself to Samantha, \"I'm Bruce's-\" \"Ward, well, he will be... soon.\" Bruce finished for him. Though, Damian would have said something different. Both Bruce and Samantha looked down at the ten year old boy. Samantha turned her head to look at Bruce, \"That's twice you've surprised me tonight.\" She mused playfully. \"Damian?\" A voice called. Bruce knew Damian recognized he voice immediately, for he jerked his head towards the door way immediately as well as avoiding eye contact with both him and Samantha. And Kate appeared in the doorway, without horns, wings, scales, claws, or her scar on her eye, but her long blood red hair was in long curls. Normal POV: Kate stood in the doorway in a black hoodie (with the sleeves rolled up to her elbows), a white tank underneath, black cargo pants, and black combat boots. There was a single silver bangle dangling from her right ear, and a black choker on her neck. Samantha cleared her throat slightly, \"And who is this?\" she asked as she gestured to Kate with distaste in her voice. To Damian, not only because he already didn't like Samantha, she gestured to Kate in a disrespectful way, causing anger to stir in the Boy Wonder. Kate had walked into the room and stood next to Damian. \"I'm Kate, Kate Breeze.\" She extended her pale hand to Samantha while smiling best she could. Samantha extended her well tanned hand to Kate and shook it warily. \"I'm Samantha. Samantha Myers.\" (AN: IDK a last name) \"Damian's been through a lot. I just don't want those vultures after him just yet. So for now he stays a secret.\" Bruce explained. \"Ah, I see. And how do you relate to him?\" Samantha asked Kate. Kate thought for a second, and since she couldn't think of a strange way to confuse herm she just decided to explain. \"Well, I'm kind of like his mum.\" She stated. \"Bu-\" \"How old are you?\" the blonde woman asked squinting her eyes slightly. Taken back form her sudden question, Kate paused for a moment. \"Nineteen. As I was saying, Damian found me when his real mum was killed and I've kind of stuck with him ever since. I'm sorry you-\" Samantha bent down to Damian's level, \"No, don't apologize. You've taken in this boy,\" She was talking to Bruce, as she squeezed Damian's cheeks with one hand, and looked at him as if to see if there was any trace of Kate's genes inside if him. He looked exactly like Bruce, but with bright green eyes; Kate had large pools of black for eyes. \"and given him a better chance at life!\" Kate stood with her hands on Damian's shoulders. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw that look she got when she was protective. If looks could kill, Samantha would be dead. Dead for messing with her \"son\". She smiled at Bruce, then her phone rang. She apparently had a late meeting to attend. She finally let Damian's cheeks go and she kissed Bruce goodbye for the longest time, making Damian roll his eyes. Getting annoyed with the excess kissing, he announced to them, \" Well, Kate and I will just be going.\" He said as he tugged Kate to the door and down the hallway. \"I don't like her.\" He grumbled to Kate as he crossed his arms over his chest. \"What, Damian? Give her a chance.\" Kate said pulling him to her side. \"No.\" Damian said stubbornly. She quirked an eye brow at him. \"And why not?\" \"She's nothing like you.\" AN: I hope you liked it! I'll try to update soon! but please review and tell me what you think! Thanks! ~ Xx Wilting Rose xX[Chapter 3] AN: New update! Yay! I hope you enjoy this! Please tell me your opinions on the plot and character quality! Thanks! ~ Xx Wilting Rose xX Bruce entered the dining roomto find Damian eating at a dish set before him. He made his way to the younger boy, sitting next to him. Silence fell over them until they move family asper something he had been wanting to ask. \"Why did you she could come?\" Damian asked harsher than he meant to. \"First she didn't ask if she could come. I invited her and Billy. Alfred gave me the idea. Thalia is gone and we both know she was too late for the Lazarus Pit. If Kate is your comfort, I should get to know her better. You are my son, Damian.\" Bruce said. \"She just said she asked so you wouldn't be upset with me, but with her. She hates seeing you upset.\" Damian stared in front of him. \"Yes. I know. When I stayed with her for that one month, she trained me. She's tough. But she's not brutal. I trust her. She knows who I am and who you are.\" Bruce nodded. \"So that's where you learned how to temporarily paralyze someone with a single that one kick.\" Bruce stated in realization. Damian nodded his head. \"Yes. I learned it from Kate. When we would go on patrols, she made sure the robbers and such would Forget me. So nothing would be suspicious around Gotham or Anchor City.\" \"do you think she'd want to come with us tonight?\" Bruce asked his son. For a moment about it. He knew Kate wouldn't it would be more than glad to help out with controls, but Anchor City had only half the crime population as Gotham did. If they were to split up they might be able to stop crime faster. \"Er, maybe.\" Damian made a move to get to Kate and Billy's room. Bruce stopped him. \"No, I'll go do it. I need to become better quit it with Kate.\" Damian father said. Bruce made its way through May we made it to Kate and Billy's room they had been placed in by Alfred. he knocked on the door and stood as Kate answering, Billy stood in the doorway dressed in a red T-shirt black, zip - up hoodie with blue jeans and black and white sneakers. \"Mr. Wayne!\" Billy exclaim in quiet voice. \"Sir, thank you for inviting Kate and me to stay with you.\" Bruce chuckled wholeheartedly. \"Please, Billy, call me Bruce. It's a pleasure to have the mighty Shazam staying at my home.\" \"But you're the Batman. I'm just that guy like Superman.\" Billy mumbled. Bruce quirkiest an eyebrow at the nineteen - year - old hero. \"What do you mean, Billy?\" \"You're.\" Billy began, then sighed. \"you're the dork night. You're a legend. I… I am just that guy like Superman.\" Billy's head group so he was staring at the floor beneath him, hands shoved in his pockets. \"Billy, I know you feel like your Superman's shadow. But you're a good, different person altogether. You're not just a bad copy. You have different abilities that make you just as great as Superman.\" Bruce's to the point for him. \"ironic.\" Billy mused with a chuckle. Bruce cast him a strange look. \"What is?\" He inquired Billy. He looked up at Bruce Wayne and replied, \"That's exactly what Kate said.\" At the mention of her name, Bruce was reminded why I can't come to their room. \"where is Kate anyways?\" Bruce asked Billy. \"she said she was going to the library.\" Billy explained. \"He loves to read; it's one of her favorite things to do.\" Bruce nodded. \"I see.\" Kate set at a wooden oak desk in the library of Wayne Manor. She had a book on I was open in front of her. The dragoness could hear the pattering on the windows in the big room. The only she could hear the peace will reign but she heard heavy footsteps on the carpet coming towards her. \"Kate.\" A deep voice addressed her. The girl with blood red hair with her head around lay eyes on none other than Bruce Wayne. \"Oh, Mr. Wayne, sorry, did you want me to leave?\" Kate asked. Without waiting for the last plane to reply, Kate began to gather book together in her arms. \"No, no, Kate.\" Bruce began. \"I just called to ask if you would like to acompany us on patrols.\" Kate stared at him for a long moment. \"you want to take me out on the trails with you and Damian?\" \"Yes.\" Bruce replied simply. \" what about Billy?\" Kate asked. \"he would be upset with me. I can't if he doesn't.\" \"I understand your view, but we need to spend time together. Damian choose you. You excepted him as a son. I know his father. We have to at least try to spend time together. To trust one another.\" Bruce said. \"Like you trust him?\" Kate spat. Bruce's eyes narrowed. \"I do trust him.\" Kate narrowed her own black eyes. \"You thought he killed someone.\" \"I know his background.\" Bruce told her harshly. \"You don't.\" The girl before and folded her arms across her chest. \"I don't do I?\" She asked him in a challenging way. He continued to glare down her. \"Damian was raised by the League of Assassins, led by Ra's A Ghul. At the age of four, Damian was told to climb mountain as training. He broke his wrist continued on. It was required of him. At ten years old, he lost his role model, but he found a new. His mother died, and he's been living with you for about six months. His mother is Talia A Ghul, and she is the daughter of Ra's A Ghul. The two train Damien to seek vengeance on those whom he thought did wrong, but killing. But you, Bruce, have convinced him not to kill. For he heard your words in his mind when he confronted the Doll Maker. Instead a man dressed in an owl suit ripped the heart out of the victim.\" Kate stated plainly. Bruce's scowl remained on his face. \"Kate, I trust him to an extent.\" Bruce clarified. Kate side and closed her eyes. Her long eye lashes curled perfectly and suddenly her eyes flew open. \"May I borrow this book, Mr. Wayne?\" Bruce's show expression soften slightly. \"Yes, Kate.\" The Dragon this not it muttering, 'thank you, Mr. Wayne'. She made her way to the exit of the manor's library. \"Kate.\" Bruce called not turning to face her. she stopped immediately; but did not make a move to turn and face him. \"Yes, Mr. Wayne?\" She asked somewhat coldly. \"At least think about the patrols offer. We leave at eleven o'clock.\" Said Bruce. Kate made a motion to the door. She had her hand on the door handle and turn the doorhandle exit. \"I'll take it under consideration.\" she said and left the room leaving Bruce standing alone in the large library. Damian look at the clock it is room. Seeing that it was 10:47 PM, he assumed he should go get ready for patrols. Damian made his way down to the Batcave, through the grandfather clock. He pulled on his Robin uniform and ran down to the Batcave. When he had made his way down, he saw Bruce and Kate dressed in hero gear ready to go. \"Let's go. Damian?\" Bruce asked. Damien nodded and they took off. Bruce in the downhill, Kate flying in the air with Damian upon her back. \"No! Please! Don't hurt him!\" Kate heard the cry if begging and pleading. \"C'mon, Robin, let's see what's wrong.\" Kate advised. She flew them down to the Crimora man once leaving on the ground, and one large guy held captive, while another study in front of her with a knife in her throat. \"Ready?\" She asked. Her 'son' nodded, and they descended. \"Hey!\" Damian barked at the guy with a knife clutched his hand. \"Pick on someone your own size.\" The man scoffed. \"Like who? You?\" Kate and it silently behind the man making fun of Damian. She tapped his shoulder. \"He meant me.\" She said, and with a smirk on her face, she punched him in the face knocking out a few teeth and breaking his nose. The other Goonan turn to Damian, they Kate. \"Please don't hurt me.\" The guy begged. \"Funny. That's what she was begging for.\" Damian said as he motioned to the woman and man. \"You should treat others like you want to be treated.\" And with that, he handcuffed and not him unconscious with his gloved fist. ","Summary":" AN: using my new OC the Horned Bandit. I hope you enjoy! I'm using Damian from Son Of Batman and Bi"},{"Movie":"Son of Batman","Title":"Family Love Can Be Stronger Than Revenge","Author":"Reina Grayson","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10441869","Passage":"[Chapter 1] This is based off a dream I had that was from an OC of mine's POV. I've had alot of people say that my stories shouldn't have my OCs in them, but when I have dreams about my stories, they always seem to be from her POV, so I go with it. Just saying this now. Chapter One Ra's' Oil Rig Near the Outer Hebrides of Scotland Talia was doing her damnedest to get out of Deathstroke's grip, but his assassins and followers caught her every time she tried. \"I have to give you this, Talia; you are resilient, just like your father was. Even that brat of yours is resilient.\" Deathstroke told Talia as his followers chained her back up. \"You will NOT touch him.\" Talia shouted at her captor as she tried to free her wrists. \"We'll see about that.\" Deathstroke said and with that he left the room. BATMANBATMANBATMAN Gotham Dick was concerned…..sure Damian was given Bruce's permission to be Robin, but what if he went TOO far, like he almost did with Ubu. Dick, along with a female, were still in the Batcave with Langstrom, but they were far enough away to not be overheard. \"Dick, don't worry; Bruce trained us well, and yea, Damian was trained by the League of Assassins, but he's with Bruce now, he'll learn.\" A dark haired female said. \"I know, Reiena, but he's just so…..\" Dick said then he let out a frustrated cry. \"He's somehow going to get to that oil rig, I just know it.\" \"Well then, let's go keep an eye on the rig while Bruce heads that way.\" Reiena said. Dick was concerned at first, they learned that Deathstroke had actually KILLED Ra's, so he was tough, but they had to protect Bruce's biological son. Reiena had gone into the changing area and returned in a uniform that was a deep gray with a red bird on the chest. \"You go ahead, Flamebird; I'll help Langstrom get the antidote loaded up into the Batjet once he's done.\" Dick/Nightwing said. \"Alright, be careful out there, from what Batman and Robin said, these Man-Bats are fast AND strong.\" Flamebird said, and with that she lifted herself off her feet and flew off to get to Scotland. \"From what I've read about you and Flamebird….she's grown more powerful with that fire ability of hers.\" Langstrom said. \"Yea, but right now, we have to get the antidote loaded up.\" Nightwing said. \"Right.\" With that said, the scientist and the hero started getting the antidotes ready for injection into the Man-Bats. BATMANBATMANBATMAN Five Miles from Rig Young Robin popped his head out of the water not far from the rig where he knew his mother was being held. His assassin training gave him the endurance to swim the 50 miles from the coast of Scotland to the Rig. He was ready for this, and he was going to end Deathstroke. He got to the rig and was silently taking out any guards that he saw on his way to the interior. Robin soon found a room that had TWO guards outside the door and he KNEW his mother was in there. As he waited for the right time, Damian was grabbed from behind by the very person he was swearing revenge on. \"So nice of you to come, BOY.\" \"Let me go.\" Robin shouted to his captor as he struggled. \"You mother wishes to see you….then you'll BOTH die today.\" Robin was carried into the room and saw his mother chained to the wall. He struggled harder to get free, but he couldn't as he was lifted up to a set of shackles and they were quickly placed around his wrists. Damian hung from the ceiling and just glared at Deathstroke as more shackles were raised up from the floor and secured around his ankles. The new rustling of chains awakened the resting Talia and her face went from one of anger at Deathstroke to dread when she saw her son chained up so he couldn't escape. \"So, Talia… it's up to you. Choose me as your husband and the new leader of the League; or little Damian dies.\" Deathstroke remarked. \"Don't do it, Mother.\" Damian/Robin screamed. \"You can try to kill my son, but there are people out there that are going to keep that from happening.\" Talia said, her face going to a look of defiance. \"I highly doubt that. The sperm donor doesn't know where we are.\" Deathstroke said as he turned to Robin. \"You're wrong Deathstroke; we DO know where you are.\" A voice said. Only Talia recognized it and turned to the window where there was a feminine figure standing on the window sill. Her hair blew in the wind, and there seemed to be a strange heat coming off of her body. \"And just who are you?\" Deathstroke asked. \"What…you don't remember me, Deathstroke, well maybe a little demonstration will help.\" The heroine stated before she jumped from the window sill and right for the assassin/mercenary. The two fought and it was then that he recognized her style. \"So, Batman sends the little Cardinal to bring his brat home.\" \"I'm Flamebird now, and you'll wish you hadn't messed with my family.\" Flamebird remarked as she kept fighting off Deathstroke's attacks. \"These two are no blood to you.\" Deathstroke said as he was able to grab his sword from its sheath and cut Flamebird's left arm. \"They may not be blood, but Robin IS my little brother, so you better back off.\" Flamebird said as she held the cut and it quickly singed closed. \"Then you will die along with him and his mother.\" Deathstroke said as he pulled out a gun. \"It's your choice, brat.\" \"Then I choose to save them and keep you from ever hurting them again.\" Flamebird remarked. She then formed a couple of fireballs out of nowhere and they went right for Talia's chains. The fireball burned through them quickly and she fell to the floor weak from the torture she had endured. \"Mother.\" Robin called out. Talia quickly gathered her strength and got up. Once she was stable on her feet, she walked to where Damian was chained up and started to unchain his ankles. \"I WILL kill both of you.\" Deathstroke said as he turned from his fight with Flamebird and fired the gun he had quickly pulled. Damian saw the bullet leave the gun, but he couldn't do anything as he was still chained up. Talia it seemed didn't care about the bullet as she just wanted to get her son away from this madman. \"NOOOOO; MOTHER.\" Damian cried out. Flamebird was beyond pissed off as Deathstroke turned his attention back to her and she fought him around the room until she got him close to the very window she entered through and gave a strong kick to his chest…sending him flying out of the window. Flamebird then ran to where Damian and Talia were, and checked for a pulse in Talia. \"Is she alright?\" Robin asked, concern actually showing in his voice now. Flamebird didn't say anything as she sent a couple of fireballs at the chains holding the young Robin. As the chains melted from the heat, Flamebird picked up Talia. \"Let's go.\" Flamebird said as she ran out of the room carrying Talia with Damian not far behind. BATMANBATMANBATMAN Route to Rig Batman had a bad feeling that his son was in trouble, so he was taking his glider to get to the oil rig. Suddenly his comm beeped and he activated it. \"I'm en route now for the Rig, anything I need to know.\" Batman said to the person on the other end. \"Flamebird's already there, she wanted to see what she could do, but I haven't heard from her.\" The person said back. \"I'm sure she'll contact you soon enough, Nightwing; how's the antidote coming?\" Batman said back. \"Langstrom's finished it and it's ready to go whenever you give the word.\" Nightwing said. \"Alright, I'll let you know. Batman out.\" Batman said and with that he went back to his flight.[Chapter 2] Chapter Two Within the Rig Flamebird found a hiding spot and laid Talia down. Damian was at his mother's side quickly. \"We have to get her to the Pit that's here.\" Damian said as he looked to the heroine that saved him. \"Damian, I'm sorry, but I doubt the Pit can fix her heart. That was a hollow point bullet Deathstroke used. The tip will have stuck into her heart, and the way it mushrooms….it would have torn that part of her heart and the tissue around it to shreds.\" Flamebird remarked; remembering her ballistics studies. He couldn't believe it…no, she couldn't be dead; but this heroine knew what she was talking about, it was in the tone of her voice. There was no one left to him now that he grew up with…sure he had his father, but he had JUST met him. \"You seem familiar to me, but we have not met.\" Damian said. \"You've met my twin brother…which I'm surprised he let you take up his old name.\" Flamebird said. \"He didn't have a choice. Please, my mother can't be….she's not burned all over like grandfather was….\" Damian told Flamebird. \"There are different types of unrepairable damage, Damian; believe me, I've seen some first hand.\" Flamebird said. \"There's still time…we have to try.\" Damian said, his voice starting to crack with despair. Flamebird knew she had to connect to this boy on a different level so she reached up and pulled her domino mask off and Damian saw her brown eyes. \"I know you've seen a lot of death in your short life, but most of it was people you didn't love. When my brother and I were eight, we watched our parents fall to their death from a sabotaged trapeze wire. That's when your father took us in and after we found out the truth about who he really was, we wanted to help so that no children would feel what we did. There's a difference between revenge and vengeance, you have to find the line and make sure you never cross it.\" \"I'm going to END Deathstroke.\" Damian said as Flamebird noticed his mask was coming loose. \"That's what I'm talking about, Damian; ending Deathstroke will not bring Ra's or Talia back, but we can get justice for them by capturing him.\" Flamebird told the ten year old. \"Dick told me about you asking Bruce if he ever felt vengeful. It's the same with me and Dick, we're vengeful every day of our lives since we lost our parents, and your father is the same way, in fact he lost his parents when he was just eight as well. Find your center, and you'll never want to kill again.\" It was then that Flamebird's words sank in and Damian removed his mask. Flamebird gave a soft smile as she saw the tears in his green eyes. She knew he needed comforting, but even though he was brave, the front he had put up since coming to Gotham had fallen and he fell into Flamebird's arms, letting out all the sorrow he had inside. \"It's okay, Damian, just let it all out. I can tell you that the pain never goes away, but you will be able to use it to fuel your drive to defend the innocent.\" Flamebird said. Damian had looked up at Flamebird and he could tell that she was being sincere. She then released him, put her domino mask back on and moved to pick of Talia's body. \"Let's get your mom's body to a safe place, then get out of here and wait for Batman, I'm sure he's on his way.\" \"Very well; but….\" Damian said; starting to question everything he's ever learned from the League of Assassins. \"Don't worry; we'll get out of here.\" Flamebird said as she smiled at her 'baby brother'. Damian put his mask back on and gave a silent 'I'm ready'; then Flamebird carried Talia to the edge of their hiding place and made sure the coast was clear then headed out to leave the rig. Ten Minutes Later The guard was watching the sea through the scope on his gun, but he didn't see anything flying into the area and was not expecting to be knocked out. With no other guards on their way, Batman took the time to contact his daughter. \"Flamebird, can you read me.\" Batman said into his comm. \"I've got Damian, but Talia's….I'm so sorry Bruce, but Deathstroke got her in the heart with a hollow point bullet.\" Flamebird came back over the link. Batman didn't know what to think, sure Talia had drugged him when Damian was conceived, but he still loved her. \"Find a way out of the rig; I'm going to see if I can't lure any Man-Bats out into the open so your brother can take care of them.\" \"Alright; be careful.\" Flamebird said back. \"Always.\" Batman then took off into the rig to see if he could find anything that would lead him to Deathstroke. \"So, the little bastard's sperm donor IS here, well you won't be leaving alive.\" A voice remarked. Batman didn't say anything as he looked the owner of the voice right in his one visible eye. \"Deathstroke.\" \"I'll finish you off after I finish the two brats that are running amok in my rig.\" Batman said nothing more, and was ready for an attack, which Deathstroke delivered as he came at the Dark Knight with his sword drawn. The two fought and Batman was even able to get a few good hits in on the assassin, but that didn't last long as Deathstroke pulled out his gun and got to a good long distance range. He started firing at Batman, but the Gotham hero was quick enough to avoid the bullets and get into a position to where he could get in punch/kick combos and pushed Deathstroke back right to the edge of the platform. Deathstroke was teetering on the edge of the platform and just as he gained his balance, Batman feinted a punch and went to a leg sweep, sending Deathstroke over the edge of the platform. With that distraction taken care of, Batman went to work at locating any Man-Bats he could. BATMANBATMANBATMAN Flamebird and Robin run through the building and that's when Robin sees a way they can use to get to a particular spot. \"This way.\" Robin called out. \"I'm sure you know this rig well enough, but are you sure it will get us out of here?\" Flamebird said as she stopped running. \"It will help.\" Was all Robin said as he pulled up a grate and fell into the vent. Flamebird was questioning his route as it went down not out, but she told her brother she'd keep an eye on Robin, so she followed after attaching a grapple rope to Talia's body and lowered her into the vent and held on as Flamebird herself entered. With gravity doing the work, it wasn't long before Robin, Flamebird, and Talia's body were now in a cavern and the only light came from a large pool. \"Damian, I told you; this won't work….I've seen what bringing a dead person back to life can do; it happened to someone I cared for. You aren't the second Robin, you're the fourth. After what happened to the second Robin, Bruce was always against another Robin, but the third one proved he had what it took, and you are way above his level.\" Flamebird started as she stared at the pit. \"What DID happen to the second one?\" Damian/Robin asked. \"He was killed by Joker and your grandfather thought he would bring him back with a Pit. Jason came back damaged and turned to a life of crime. All of Bruce's moral teachings were gone, and Jason thought he could do a better job of controlling crime...by becoming a criminal\" Flamebird told the 10 year old. \"But…Grandfather did a good thing didn't he; he gave father back a fallen soldier.\" Damian retorted. \"You don't know the story, do you?\" Flamebird asked with a sigh, only receiving a curious look from Damian. \"Bruce and Jason were in Europe after they found out about Joker stealing prescription medications. It wasn't till later that we all learned that Ra's was behind Joker being in Europe. Joker wasn't supposed to capture Jason, but he did and beat the crap out of him then blew up the old warehouse he was holding Jason in… with him still inside. Bruce didn't get there in time.\" Damian didn't know what to say and he started thinking back to when he wanted to put his grandfather in the pit back at the League of Assassins' base. \"Mother knew about this.\" \"I'm sorry Damian; I wish what I said wasn't true, but it is.\" Flamebird said. Just as Damian started to let everything sink it, a sound was heard coming from above the two heroes. They looked up and saw Man-Bats staring at them and screeching. \"Don't worry; they won't attack unless I tell them to.\" A voice said, and both heroes were ready to fight. \"What are you, a cat?\" Flamebird questioned. \"If that is so….then I have seven lives left. I'm surprised your father figured out my location.\" \"We're Bats, Deathstroke; we're always three steps ahead of our enemies.\" Flamebird said, making sure to protect Damian. \"Let's test that theory shall we. Kill them.\" Deathstroke said, and with that command, the Man-Bats dropped from their perches and were flying after Flamebird and Damian. The two were dodging them every which way, but Deathstroke was going to stop their movements. He pulled his gun and was able to shoot Flamebird and Damian each in one knee. The Man-Bats then started piling on the heroes, but a huge fire blew about twenty of them off of Flamebird and she got up, not worried about her knee. She then ran over and started pulling Man-Bats off of Damian. Deathstroke saw his chance to end ONE bat's legacy then he finish off the Al Ghul family so he took it and fired a bullet right at Flamebird's spine to disorient her more. \"AHHHHHH!\" Flamebird screamed as the bullet entered her back and she fell backward. Suddenly, a shadow came into the room from the same vent that the young heroes came through and it was revealed to be Batman. He pulled a batarang and threw it to disarm Deathstroke then the Man-Bats were coming for him so he pulled another batarang and when it was in the air it split into three and once they were embedded in the wall they released a supersonic sound that began to drive the Man-Bats crazy and they flew up the vent to get out of the cave. \"I'll take my leave…for now.\" Deathstroke remarked, and with that he went into the shadows and disappeared. Batman ran to his children and saw that Flamebird had a bullet wound at the bottom of her spine and the bullet had exited through her stomach. \"Flamebird.\" Batman said as he gently picked her up. \"Hey dad… I'll live, it wasn't a hollow point, but don't know if I can be a hero anymore.\" Flamebird said as she looked her father in the face, then passed out from the blood lose she was suffering. \"Father, the Pit…, it couldn't save mother, but for my sister it will work.\" Damian said. \"Can you get here into it safely?\" Batman asked his son. \"Yes; just end Deathstroke's reign of evil.\" Damian told his father. \"What made you accept her as a sister so quickly?\" Batman questioned as he laid Flamebird at the Pit's edge. \"She only just met me and yet she risked her life to help me and mother; then she revealed to me what happened to her parents.\" Damian said, and with a nod, Batman took off to find Deathstroke.[Chapter 3] Alright, so, here's the end... I have something to say to a reviewer that is a guest, and I hope they find this story agian. I didn't know Damian's age, and while I was looking online, I found the age of 10, so that's why I set him at age 10. Also, you mentioned Flamebird's eyes: The reason they are brown is that in the movie Son of Batman (which this is an alternate ending of) Dick's eyes are brown...not blue. I had this checked as I asked a friend to look at a screencap of him from the movie, and she agreed that his eyes were brown. With that said, on to the ending to the story. Chapter Three Within the inner mechanics of the rig that were not far from the cavern, Deathstroke was casually walking to get to an escape pod. All of a sudden a titanium rope came out of nowhere and tied his arms to his side. He turned to see Batman standing there, which he had hoped it would be Damian so he could finish him off. \"Ready to finally cross the line; your daughter is dead by now.\" Deathstroke remarked, smiling behind his mask. \"Not if my son has anything to do about it. You're going away for a long time.\" Batman said as he pulled Deathstroke toward him. \"I highly doubt that.\" Deathstroke stated as he pulled out a hidden knife and was able to cut the rope. He then went after Batman and the two were caught up in a 'dance' that would be the deciding battle. BATMANBATMANBATMAN Outside The Rig The Man-Bats had made it to the outside of the rig from the cavern, only after many of them perished when the support tube they had piled into to busted and started to flood the facility. They were met by a jet and it started firing something at the creatures. As the needles stuck into the Man-Bats, the liquid inside went into their bodies. They soon enough transformed back into humans and fell into the ocean. BATMANBATMANBATMAN The Lazarus Pit Damian pulled Flamebird into the pit, and with the liquid helping her float, he got her to the middle of it. He then released his hold on her, and she floated a bit more then started to sink below the surface. Flamebird's blood was mixing with the liquid, but it wasn't long before her eyes opened and she came back to the surface of the pit, with the liquid raising up behind her and she was screaming out as if in pain. Damian moved through the liquid and got to Flamebird and caught her as she was about to fall back into the pit. He pulled her to the edge and got her out. It wasn't long before her breathing stabilized and she moved so she was looking at him. He pulled her mask off and saw that her eyes were blank…but then they returned to normal and she passed out. \"I hope you'll be able to walk again.\" Damian said as he held his newly accepted sister close. BATMANBATMANBATMAN Batman and Deathstroke were still at a standstill in their fight, but Batman needed to end this and go check on his children. He saw an opportunity to stop Deathstroke's movements so he took it and back the mercenary/assassin up to the point where he was against a piece of machinery and Batman threw five batarangs and they caught parts of Deathstroke's uniform, trapping him against the machine. \"So, are you going to finish it?\" Deathstroke questioned as Batman walked up to him. \"You really think I'd cross that line.\" Batman answered back. \"I'm surprised I'm not dead already…what with Talia dead, and your son watching it happen. Not to mention Flamebird; I hope Damian saw the light leave her eyes.\" Deathstroke stated; wanting to get Batman mad enough to actually kill. Batman said nothing…just turned around and walked away. \"Get back here and finish this fight…coward.\" Deathstroke said and with that last word, Batman stopped walking. Deathstroke was smiling under his mask, but was not expecting the speed that came next as Batman was back in front of him, and punched the assassin right in the face…knocking him out. BATMANBATMANBATMAN Damian cradled Flamebird's head in his lap as she started to come to. As she opened her eyes, she saw concern on her baby brother's face. \"Where's Bruce?\" \"He went after Deathstroke, I told him that the Pit could save you and he trusted it, so he left me to care for you.\" Damian said as Flamebird started to sit up on her own. \"I remember waking up and feeling a little strange, but then blackness.\" Flamebird remarked. \"It's the effect of the Pit.\" Damian said. \"Thank you for helping me, Damian.\" Flamebird stated. \"It is what family does for each other.\" Damian told her. \"According to Dick, you didn't take too well to him; what changed your attitude with me.\" Flamebird said as she stood up with Damian's help. \"It didn't matter to you what I did to Dick; you still came to protect me from Deathstroke. Not many people would do that after I sliced a family member of theirs up the way I did.\" Damian said; a small smirk on his face. \"That's true, Alfred told me that Dick was about to cuss you out. I'm actually surprised he was able to hogtie you, your skills are good.\" Flamebird said as she finally stabilized herself on her feet. \"Well, Mother and Grandfather did tell me that Father was very skilled, and it seems he passed his excellent training down to you and Dick.\" Damian said. Just then, a rumbling was heard and rocks from the cavern's ceiling were falling into the Lazarus pit. All of a sudden water started pouring into the cavern and the two young heroes started to run. Flamebird felt the water coming too fast, so she grabbed Damian and held him close while she heated the air around them and they flew at a fast pace…making it to the heart of the rig. They landed on a walkway as the water rushing behind them started into a waterfall into the new room. As Damian looked around, he saw Deathstroke pinned up against a huge pipe and Batman walking away from the assassin. \"Father.\" Damian said as he ran to stand in front of Batman. \"I'm glad to see you are both safe. Damian, thank you for helping Flamebird.\" Batman said as he looked from his son to his adopted daughter. \"I'm sure she would have done the same for me.\" Damian said as he looked from his father to Flamebird. \"We have to go, Batman; the cavern started filling with water. The whole place is going to come down around us.\" Flamebird told her father. Just then, Damian caught sight of movement close to Batman and interfered with its advancement. Batman and Flamebird watched as Damian fought with a free Deathstroke, and Flamebird wanted to interfere to protect her brother, but Batman stopped her. A silent conversation happened between the two, and Flamebird relaxed a little bit. Deathstroke and Damian fought hard, and Damian was even able to get one of the assassin's two swords and they were fighting hard in swordplay. As Damian was able to cut though Deathstroke's uniform, the assassin grabbed his arm and shoved his elbow into Damian's from underneath, breaking the arm and causing the boy to cry out in pain. Flamebird was concerned, but Damian soon enough flung the sword into the air and caught it with his other hand, then went right back into fighting. Batman was watching, ready should his son need him. Damian was then backed up in his fight and landed against a pipe that had some Lazarus liquid in it. The young Robin saw an opportunity to defeat Deathstroke and so he threw a birdarang and it hit a pipe causing steam to blow in Deathstroke's face. \"Time for me to finish the Al Ghul family.\" Deathstroke said as he readied his sword and ran straight for Damian. The 10 year old smiled as Deathstroke came close then jumped away and Deathstroke's sword impaled the pipe with the liquid in it. With the glass shattered, the liquid came pouring out and threw Deathstroke to the level below. He drug himself out of the waterfall of liquid and there was Damian standing before him with a sword right in his face. \"Well, finish me…\" Deathstroke yelled, but Damian didn't move. \"It's what you want…it's what I would do…it's what your grandfather would do…well DO IT.\" \"No, I'm my father's son too.\" Damian said. \"I'm Robin.\" With that he walked away and got to the above walkways to meet up with his family. \"We have to go; the water level is rising fast.\" Batman told his children. \"There's an escape pod this way.\" Damian said; remembering the layout of the rig and took off. Batman and Flamebird were right behind him. They got to the pod, Damian took the controls and the pod launched upward. As the area flooded, Deathstroke was too defeated to move, so he started to sink into the water…never to be seen again. BATMANBATMANBATMAN Outside the Rig Nightwing watched the water, and the Rig was starting to go. He was hoping that his father and sister were alright…as well as Damian. Sure the boy was bloodthirsty, but he was still Bruce's son, so Dick was worried about him as well. Soon enough, an escape pod came popping out of the water and Nightwing veered to intercept it. A part of the rig was about to fall right on top of the escape pod but Nightwing got the Batjet there in time and launched magnetic wench cables and pulled the pod with him as he took off to a safe place. BATMANBATMANBATMAN Three Hours Later Everyone was back at the cave and they had wound down from the recent events, but Damian had secluded himself from the rest of his family. \"Do you think he'll be alright?\" Reiena asked. \"I don't know, Bruce is his only family now….guess he's becoming an official Robin.\" Dick stated. \"Bruce isn't his only family, we're his siblings now, and we have to be there for him.\" Reiena said. \"He'll never accept us…I mean he did remind me that I'm not Bruce's blood son.\" Dick said, remembering when he was getting his sword injuries patched up. \"He's already accepted me.\" Reiena told her brother. \"WHAT?\" Dick questioned; excitement in his voice. \"It happened while we were at the Rig; it was right after Talia died. He wanted to kill Deathstroke; I had to talk to him about the line between revenge and vengeance. I didn't go into super details, but he also knows what happened to our parents.\" Reiena remarked. \"I see; he became the scared little boy that he should have been all along.\" Dick said softly. \"He did, but he helped me after Deathstroke shot me in the spine. I don't think I'd be STANDING here right now if he hadn't gotten me into the Lazarus Pit.\" \"So, is it as intense as the research suggests?\" \"I don't remember much, but yea…from what I do remember it was intense.\" It was then that Damian came walking up to the twins. \"So, Dick; I…I wish to apologize for what I said and did when we first met.\" Dick was thrown off his guard…the grandson of Ra's Al Ghul was apologizing….this really was a big change for the boy. \"You're a different person that you were when we met. So…the League of Assassins falls to you now…what are you going to do with it?\" \"I've been thinking about that; I'm going to hand it over to one of Grandfather's most trusted assassins. I wish to stay here with my father and older siblings.\" The twins smiled and it was then that Batman came up to the three of them. \"Bruce, I'm sorry I couldn't save Talia.\" Reiena said, turning to her father. \"She died trying to save our son from Deathstroke. I'm sure if the bullet had not been a hollow point, she COULD have been saved by the Pit.\" Bruce said as he pulled his cowl off. \"I'm curious, sister; how did you know it was a hollow point bullet?\" Damian asked. \"I've trained in sounds, and a hollow point bullet has a slightly different sound than a regular one. The second piece of data was that it didn't exit her body, if it had, your leg would have been injured as well.\" Reiena told her new brother. \"Grandfather was right about Father's skills, and I'm glad he passed them on.\" Damian said. \"Bruce didn't earn the title of 'World's Greatest Detective' without doing his homework.\" Dick remarked, a grin on his face. \"Let's get some rest; it's been a long week.\" Bruce said, and with that the three siblings went up to the manor, as it was now Damian's home and the twins could use their old rooms for the night before they returned to their own apartments.

I've had alot of people say that"},{"Movie":"Cloud 9","Title":"Willayla(Will and Kayla)One shots! 1st Cloud 9 story up on fanfiction!","Author":"dropdatbiblio","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10033593","Passage":"[Chapter 1] HEEEEEEEEEEEEEEY GUYS! So I saw Cloud 9 last night! I loved it! Did you love it? It was so cute. THEY ARE SOOO CUTE TOGETHER! (better than Olivia Holt, cuz she belongs with leo) I recorded it and had to have watched it atleast 5 times already today. So anyways, your here for the story, so... In this collection of one-shots remember! They don't date a the beginning of the one shot and get together by the end, so that kiss scene in the movie never happened, but the almost kiss in the pool did happen! But I will try to recreate that kiss scene, because I loved it. NONE OF MY CHAPTERS RELATE TO EACH OTHER IN ANY WAY! Chapter Setting: Right after the competition. After the Fire and ice competition, the Hot Doggers all went down to well, Hot Doggers. When they reached the entrance and opened up the door, they were immediately hit with the aroma of dog. The smell that they have all gotten used to. Everyone threw their gear in a pile on the floor, too tired to put it elsewhere. They were all now in just a pair of jeans and t shirts, exluding Kayla who was wearing Will's jacket. The same one she wore as she was running out the door to grab the dogs and Nick broke up with her. Will didn't object. He wouldn't tell anyone, but he thought that she looked adorable in his jacket. \"Hey man, I'm starving!\" said the slightly chubby blond haired Sam. \"Ya, weather calls for pizza,\". \"C'mon Dink! We've had pizza everyday this week.\" exclaimed Will. \"Ya, change the forecast in there.\" Kayla argued. Will chuckled at that. \"Fine, Chinese takeout?\" Dink said, while picking up the phone, and starting to dial the number. \"Sounds good.\" Sam said and Will and Kayla nodded in agreement. While they ate their food by the fireplace, they talked about the competition and how Will would definitely win next year and how proud they all were of each other. But then suddenly a topic came up that caught Kayla's attention. \"You know Kayla, I don't know how you did it, but thanks for getting Will on his board again.\" Dink stared thankfully at her. Sam jumped in, \"Ya, we couldn't have held that topic on for more than a minute or so.\" Kayla was confused. \"Wait, you guys have asked him to get back on his board before? I just thought that one reason he never went back to snowboarding was because nobody had asked him to come back\" \"Ya, we begged him all the time.\" \"And when you asked him, he was on his board the next day.\" \"Guys, can we not talk about this right now.\" Will was looking into his paper box of fried noodles, but the red on his face could have been seen a mile away. The guys smirked and kept going. \"He must really care about your opinion.\" Dink teased in Will's direction, making Kayla blush now and Will blush even redder. \"Ya! I mean he never looks at us that way.\" said Sam mockingly hurt. \"I have to use the bathroom.\" said Will and with that he got up refusing to look at Kayla. \"Oh ya and he talks about you all the time!\" Sam yelled and as soon as he was gone, the two both burst out into laughter. Kayla got up and playfully hit them on the shoulder. \"Guys! Just give it a rest. Your torturing poor Will.\" \"Ya, you'd be the person to defend him. After that little kissy incident in your pool the other day.\" \"How'd you know about that.\" \"He won't stop talking about it! He kept saying how he wished your mom would have came in just a couple seconds later.\" Kayla's face lit up. \"Really? He said that?\" \"Yup\" Sam said emphasizing the \"p\". Kayla ran off into the direction Will left to and found him sitting with his back against the wall, with his face in his hands. She sat next to him and put a hand on his knee. Shocked, Will looked up. They caught each other's eyes. But after about 3 seconds, Will looked away and down at the floor. \"What's wrong Will?\" \"Nothing.\" \"Something's wrong. Can you please look at me?\" Will looked up and saw her leaning closer. He imitated her actions. Their lips were brushing. You can do it Will. It takes no fear. Will thought to himself. With that Will smashed his lips onto hers, and they went through sparks, fireworks and all that other mushy cheesy stuff. They reluctantly pulled apart, cuz they needed something called \"air\". Will and Kayla blushed and grinned like crazy. \"So...\" Kayla teased \"So...\" Mocked Will \"So...you really wanted to kiss me in my pool?\" She teased. \"Dink! Sam!\"[Chapter 2] Story Setting: At school, during the hand incident Will pulled his hand away and Kayla looked confused. \"What's wrong?\" Kayla questioned. \"I have to go.\" Will ran past her and Kayla looked at her friends questioningly. One of them quickly typed something on her phone and the other one's(Pia) beeped. Pia looked up. \"She said that she saw Will look over at Nick. Huh. Did you? Maybe he's jealous Kay.\" \"No, Pia. He wouldn't be.\" BEEP Pia grabbed her phone. \"She thinks he is\" Kayla looked at her speechless friend. Her friend nodded in return. \"Maybe you should talk to him.\" BEEP \"She thinks so,too\" Kayla thought about it. Why did I feel so happy? I don't need Nick right? I like Will. Oh my gosh...I like Will. Kayla went to find Will. \"Will! Will! Where are yo-\" She stopped when she found Will by his locker playing with the things in it. \"Will!\" \"What is it.\" Kayla grabbed Wills hand and he looked down at it and his eyes softened for a second, but that look left as soon as it came, and he yanked his hand away and stuck it in his locker, grabbing a book. 'What? Nick watching?\" \"Will, I promise you that had nothing to do with Nick!\" \"Oh ya? Why'd you keep looking back at him? You were just using me to make him jealous!\" \"No, no, no, no Will, I didn't mean to make it look like that!\" \"It seemed like it. Looked pretty coldly at that Skye girl.\" \"C'mon Will you have to believe me\" \"Why do you even Care if I believe you or not!\" Kayla stopped. What was she about to do? \"That's what I thought.\" Will shut his locker and started walking away from her. \"I like you Will. Not Nick.\" Will stopped. He turned around and searched for any sign of distrust in her eyes and found none. She walked up to him and grabbed his hand. Will looked back down and the softened look in his eyes stayed that time. \"Kayla, what are you doing?\" \"Do you see a Nick Will, look around.\" Will didn't look. He took her word for it. And he grabbed her other hand and gently placed his lips onto hers. It was short, but sweet. As they pulled away, their foreheads rested on each other's. \"No, I believe you\" I believe in you. WHOOOOOO! Told you guys that was cheesy. Hoped you liked it![Chapter 3] Hey guys! So, this one was short, but I thought it was cute. Question: What if they kept flirting after Kayla made fun of Will's hair? Will looked around the newly decorated 'Hot Doggers', but gained no victory. \"Hey Kayla, where are the brushes?\" \"Oh! I washed them!\" Will and his mom shared impressed glances at one another. \"Oh really? I thought you were allergic to dog hair.\" Will teased. \"Oh, I'm just allergic to bad hair in general. And now Rufus is a step up from,\" Kayla gestured towards Will's hair, \"you.\" \"What I like my look!\" Will defended. \"And what look is that? Shaggy dog?\" Will gasped in mock pain. \"Please, you love it!\" \"Ya, well you just keep telling yourself that.\" Will's mom stood there awkwardly, and decided that now was a good as time as any to make an exit. Not that any of them would notice her departure. \"Oh, Come on! My hair is the best in all of Summit Valley.\" Will raised his arms up for emphasis. \"Um...Right here!\" Kayla gestured towards herself. Will looked down at her softly and whispered, \"Oh ya, make that second.\" He grinned down at her and smirked, making her smile as their eyes locked. \"Really?\" \"Ya, make that prettiest eyes, too\" Kayla grinned bigger, and Will didn't stop the compliments there. \"And the prettiest smile, and the prettiest laugh.\" He started leaning down and she followed, pushing herself into a tippy-toe formation. \"You can stop, I get it, thank you.\" \"Why would I stop? Why not tell you how beautiful you really are, not just on the outside...but on the inside, is where you really sparkle.\" Their lips were brushing and at that, Kayla smashed her lips against his. At first it was hard, but then they both melted into the kiss. After about a couple short sweet seconds, they pulled apart for air. Their foreheads were resting on each other's. \"Thank you, Will.\" \"Not a problem, but...\" \"But...\" \"Does my hair really look like Shaggy dog?\"[Chapter 4] WHERE TO FIND OTHER WILLAYLA STORIES BELOW! Hey guys! So, this one was requested by Kassandra Forever(Guest) ! Thanks for requesting! Also, a lot of you asked for other Willyla stories and I have a couple for you! One is by a friend I made here on faniction! Her name is Houseofanubislover89 and another one is by Wallflower8877 . Both of them are about the pool scene and I personally love them, so go off and read them NOW! Well, after my story. JK! Only if you want to. \"Kayla!\" ... \"Kayla where are you?\" As Donald starts sniffing on a certain patch of snow, Will acts fast and starts digging with the shovel he brought along with him. \"C'mon Kayla\" He finds her and clears the snow off her face. \"Kayla, C'mon say something.\" \"Nothing. Is. Impossible.\" A wave of relief went over Will as he dug up Kayla and swooped her in his arms. She clung onto his jacket, burying her face in his chest. Will signaled the helicopter that she was okay, and cheering could be heard from the lodge. Everyone ran over to Kayla and Will. \"You scared me Kayla. Why would you ever do that?\" Will cried with worry and desperation in his voice. \"I'm sorry Will, it was just the only thing I thought would impress you.\" \"For what Kayla? The cloud 9? Well it took you almost risking your life, but ya. You have my attention.\" Will and Kayla were unaware they were inching closer. \"That's not the only thing I was trying to impress you for, Will.\" It was a whisper, but it was loud enough for Will to hear. Suddenly a large chant surrounded them. It was the people from the lodge, finally managing to announce their appearance. \"KISS!KISS!KISS!\" The two blushed as red as roses. Will looked down, then slowly looked back up at Kayla. Kayla was looking and the ground, but Will could tell she was smiling. And in one swift motion, (hehe swift. get it? get it?) Will lifted up Kayla's chin with his hand and closed the gap between them. The kiss was like the one they had in the movie. Short and sweet, with Will caressing her cheek with care. But of course, they were sitting down and covered in snow. Will pulled away first, being the first to run out of air. Their fore heads were rested against eachothers and cheers erupted around them. Will was the first to speak up. \"Kayla?\" \"Mhm?\" \"Never scare me like that again.\" \"Never.\" Sorry guys! Didn't know how to end that! Hoped you liked it anyway. So I have some ideas and I want you guys to choose which one i do next. -What if they kissed in the pool? -What if Will had comforted Kayla when she came back to \"Hot Doggers\" soaking wet and broken hearted? -What if Will pulled her down for a kiss when Kayla playfully pushed him down on the ice. -(I know I already did a hand scene, but...) What if Will had decided to bring up the hand incident at practice? -What if Will decided to bring up what Nick told him after he caught up with Kayla to eat? Tell me which one I should do next guys! THAT'S ALL I GOT! BUT SUGGEST YOUR IDEAS, TOO![Chapter 5] Hey guys! So, most of you guys voted for this one next. And btw, I found a new WILLAYLA story! It's by AwEsOmEsToRyPeRsOn. If you want to read it, head on down to her profile. It is about the avalanche and I found it absolutely adorable! Question: What if Will had comforted Kayla when she came broken hearted into \"Hot Doggers\". (BTW even though I really wanted will to comfort her in that scene, his facial expression when Kayla found out she wasn't fired? Can you say HILARIOUS and ADORABLE!?) Kayla ran into 'Hot Doggers' soaking wet and a tear-stained face. Will, who was currently trying to pick up a fallen table, dropped it, his eyes now illuminating with worry. \"Kayla what happened?\" He went over to the counter to grab her a blanket and wrapped it around her petite figure. Will's mom went off to grab her some hot chocolate and set up the fireplace for Kayla. \"Your soaking wet!\" \"It was all Donald's fault!\" Kayla's outburst took Will back a little. Kayla immediately noticed and her eyes softened. \"Will, I'm sorry\" \"It's fine,\" he said still holding onto the edges of the blanket, \"But why are you crying?\" He lifted his hand and used his thumb to wipe a tear away from her cheek. Will's mom came back and gently directed Kayla in the direction of the fireplace where her hot chocolate awaited her. \"Thank you, Ms. Cloud\" \"Aw, no problem honey. Listen Will, I have to go to my shift.\" Will's mom paused and looked at Kayla. \"Can you handle all this on your own.\" She tried to be subtle that she was talking about Kayla and NOT the shop. \"Ya, mom. I think I got it. We can just close up if that's alright with you?\" \"Alright sweetie. I'll turn the sign on my way out.\" Will sat beside Kayla, huddled next to the fireplace snuggling with all the blankets. \" Kayla.\" \"ya, Will?\" \"Wanna tell me why you were crying now?\" There was a long pause. Kayla shifted so that she was leaning on Will's chest. Will didn't object. \"Nick broke up with me, today.\" Will was stunned! How could he do that? \"What?! Why would someone want to break up with you?\" \"Well, why not?\" \"Your perfect Kayla. Your beautiful, smart, kind...\" \"I don't get why he would ever do that. If he can't see how amazing you are then, that's his loss.\" \"Do you mean all that Will?\" Kayla's chin was pointed up towards him. \"Of course! And, you know what I love most about you?\" \"What\" \"Your determined. You never give up. When you found out that you weren't good, you tried to work harder. Because you believe in yourself. You know that you can be amazing. And I think that's one of the most beautiful things about you, Kayla.\" \"Thank you, Will. You know, your an amazing guy, too. Words can't even describe it.\" Will smiled down at her and started leaning in. Kayla's eyes fluttered shut. And as their lips were brushing, Kayla realized. I don't need Nick! I never needed Nick. I just needed some one who cared about me, as much as I cared about them. Kayla was the first to close the gap between them. The kiss was soft, but passionate. They were both so happy. They pulled apart and smiled at each other like crazy. Will was caressing her cheek with his hand. \"Kayla..\" Will leaned in closer. \"Ya, will?\" She leaned in closer. Will put on the best serious face he had. \"Your hot chocolate's gonna get cold.\" But that serious face automatically broke out into a grin. Kayla gasped and playfully hit him on the shoulder. \"Tease!\" And with that he kissed her again, and rested by the fireplace the rest of their evening. Hey guys! I never know how to end my stores! Ha! So anyway, here you go vote away! (Hehe that rhymed) -What if they kissed in the pool? -What if Will defended Kayla when she had that little argument with Skye? -What if Will pulled her down for a kiss when Kayla playfully pushed him down on the ice. -(I know I already did a hand scene, but...) What if Will had decided to bring up the hand incident at practice? -What if Will decided to bring up what Nick told him after he caught up with Kayla to eat? Tell me which one I should do next guys! THAT'S ALL I GOT! BUT SUGGEST YOUR OWN IDEAS, TOO![Chapter 6] Hey guys. So I know I promised you an overload of fanfics, but I just found out that my grandma's in the hospital and I need to be with family right know. But NO WORRIES! I do have this one for you guys. I'll try to right more, but if I don't please understand. Thanks. You guys are the best. Question: What if they kissed in the pool? Kayla and Will were in Kayla's pool, playing and having a good time. At this point, will had told Kayla how to to the cloud 9. And their faces were so close. \"It's not easy.\" Will warned. \"So teach me.\" Their hot breaths could be felt on each other's faces. They were leaning in. Then Kayla's mom entered. \"Hey, I brought you guys some towels. \" The two bolted to other sides of the pool. Both blushing furiously. \"Oh, thanks mom. \" \"No problem sweetie. \" With that she left and it was like she never came. \"I should go. \". Will started up and swimming towards the steps. Kayla couldn't help but notice how toned he looked as he got up from the water. His chest wasn't in a perfect six pack, but had more of a pec appearance. He hadn't snowboarded in a while. Kayla found it perfectly attractive. Water was dripping from his hair. It was almost unreal. \"I'll walk you out. \" Kayla said. Her voice cracking. She got up and followed him to the towels. She went to grab for one as will did. Their hands touched and they stopped. The hold word stopped. Will looked up at Kayla, then back down at her hand. He gently picked it up and held it more normally. Now, he was holding her hand. Kayla was shocked and searched his eyes for any sign of trickery. She found none. She gently smiled up at him. Their eyes locked. Will lifted his other hand and used it to caress her cheek. His thumb stroked a little under her eye. This time he wanted no interruptions. Will smashes his lips onto Kayla's and she responded almost immediately. As they parted, they smiled at each other like crazy. \"I'll teach you. \" \"What?\" \"I'll teach you the cloud 9.\" Sooo, I know it's short. Don't judge, I wrote this kinda fast. I didn't wanna disappoint you guys. Alright guys! Well, her's the usual \"What your gonna see later\" topics. Ugh! I'm probably gonna have to watch cloud 9 again to gain my passion back. THE ONE'S IN ITALICS ARE NEWLY ADDED IDEAS! -What if Will defended Kayla when she had that little argument with Skye? -What if Will pulled her down for a kiss when Kayla playfully pushed him down on the ice. -(I know I already did a hand scene, but...)

(And she tells him he's amazing...bla, bla, bla.) REQUESTED IDEAS! THANKS FOR REQUESTING! I LOVE THESE IDEAS! -What if Kayla has an epic fail? Just like Will and Will reacts. -What if Kayla gets hurt and she tells Will that she likes him, while she's drowsy on her medicine. (I might put the last 2 together! If I do, then I'll probably do the \"Epic fail\" one again separately) -Another Avalanche one, but more dramatic. -Another version of what happened when Will played Road Kill on Kayla. -During the hand scene, what if Will never let go. And Nick got Jealous. (Don't worry, I know that in the movie, he ends up a nice guy, but i'm gonna make him a total horror, so you/I don't feel bad for him.) PS guys, I found 2 other stories. I do check frequently, but when this fandom starts to blow up(Which I know it will-hehe, Will), I'm gonna stop, cuz it might get too much to handle, but since right now it's small, here are the one's I found. -One by loveshipper1 and she/he also writes one-shots! Yay! She/he just posted it today (Like 7 hours ago) and I loved it! -One by Blueandgreen91 I thought it was very interesting and well written! What are you waiting for? Check them out! UGH! I just had another idea, but it just left my mind! Oh well, it'll come back! I love you guys! You make my day brighter! I promise that i will try to write more this weekend, and I'm sorry for breaking my promise that I would overflow you with fanfictions, but this was all just so sudden. Bye guys! You're all beautiful.[Chapter 7] Hey guys. Sooo, here you go. I promised I wouldn't give up on you. Question: What if Will pulled Kayla down for a kiss when she pushed him. This one is short, but it's short and sweet. Will and Kayla were taking a break from practice and somehow got into a playful fight about who was better at snowboarding. \"Will! You haven't snowboarded in a year! I think I'm better.\" Kayla stood u from where they sat next to each other and faced him. Will locked eyes with her and gave her a look that said, you wanna play that game? \"Oh ya? Well sure you've been snowboarding nonstop, but who's coaching ya? Huh?\" Kayla couldn't miss the smirk on Will's face and for a second she pulled back, and melted at how cute his smirk was. Pull it together Kayla. And she did. She playfully hit will on the arm. Will stood up and hit her back. They both kept doing this back and forth, each hit getting harder and stronger. Eventually, Kayla ended up hitting his chest multiple times with her fists, with Will standing there, and amused look on his face. He then grabbed her wrist and in one swift movement pulled her against him. Their eyes locked and they could feel each others warm breath on their freezing skin. Then...Kayla pushed him to the floor. Will fell to the ice only to look up and find her laughing. He couldn't help but laugh with her. Then Kayla offered her arm out to Will, but what she didn't see coming (although she should have seen it coming) was that Will took the chance to pull her down. Their faces were so close. Will couldn't take it anymore. He gently placed his lips on Kayla's. She was shocked, but then realized what was happening and kissed him back with full force. They probably could have stayed there forever, breathing occasionally, but were interrupted by two dimwits awkwardly clearing their throats. Dink was the first to speak up. \"Okay guys forget the snowfall, forecast says LOVE IS IN THE AIR TODAY!\" Alright guys! Well, her's the usual \"What your gonna see later\" topics. THE ONE'S IN ITALICS ARE NEWLY ADDED IDEAS! -What if Will defended Kayla when she had that little argument with Skye? - What if Will kissed her when they won the fire and ice competition (They haven't kissed yet.) -(I know I already did a hand scene, but...)

I hope this overload helps with how long I've been gone. Here, have a cookie (::) XD BTW! DID YOU GUYS HEAR? CLOUD 9 NOW HAS AN OFFICIAL CATEGORY THANKS TO ' TsunamiTides' go check her out. And...guys? I'm gonna kinda stop telling you about new stories, beacause a category has now opened up, but also there are some that are still in Misc. Movies. What I do is just search \"Will and Kayla\" in the search bar. Then, I filter it down to misc. movies. And then BAM you have like 15 Willayla stories. Have fun with those! Only after reading mine first. XP Question: What if Will defended Kayla during her little argument with Skye? Oh and this chapter might be a little AU. But dont worry! It's still FLUFFFFFFFYYYYYYY! After a days practice, the 'Hot Doggers' went down to the lodge for something to eat. Kayla was walking back to her table when somebody bumped into her. She could have just kept walking, but after pulling away, she heard snickering behind her and realized that the one who had pushed her had been the one and only Skye Sailor. She new the shove had been intentional. Kayla got herself together, and as Skye was walking back to her table with team 'SWIFT', accepting a-dare she say it-well deserved applause and praise from the locals settling in for lunch time. Skye was about to give another high-five to another one of many of her admirers, but then stopped as she saw a fuming blonde-headed girl approach. Skye decided to play dumb. She pulled out a picture of herself from her jacket and a pen from the nearest waiter. The waiter, of course was happy to oblige. \"Who should I make this out to?\" \"Kayla Morgan. Maybe you've heard of me.\" Kayla suddenly felt a presence beside her. A tall, dirty blonde, ironically good smelling presence beside her. Considering he works with dog everyday. She immediately new the presence was Will and she smiled to no one in particular. He had her back. \" Kayla . Kayla. Kayla. Kayla.\" Skye spoke to herself as if trying to think where she'd heard that name. And then mockingly popped her head up, \"Of course. Kayla Morgan, everyone's favorite daddy's girl.\" Will fumed. \"Hey!\" Skye turned her head, finally noticing Will, and breaking the tension between her and Kayla. \"You can't just talk to her like that!\" Skye laughed as if finding his remark amusing. \"Aw. Kayla...got your little boyfriend here to protect you?\" For a second, both their anger subsided and they blushed. Will was the first to gain back his composure. \"She's not my girlfriend.\" It wasn't loud. It was muffled and his eyes were focused on the fallen french fry by his shoelaces, but Skye could hear him, not to mention see the blush creeping up on his cheeks. \"Will Cloud. I saw your video. Aren't you in supposed to be in a hospital or something?\" \"Listen, I know you're new here Skye, but that happened like a year ago.\" Kayla defended. \"Ya...okay.\" Skye just smirked and walked off. Kayla had to admit, she admitted defeat in a pretty clever way. Kayla had won, but yet, she still felt like the loser. She turned to face Will. \"Thanks Will.\" \"No problem.\" He smiled down at her and they walked back to the table where Dink and Sam were waiting. \"Whoa, talk about pressure.\" Sam said through a mouthful of burger. \"Don't worry guys. Skye's no threat.\" Will assured them. Dink was confused, \"Uhhh, ya guys. It sort of is. I mean it could snow really hard on the competition or something. It might even hail or-\" \"Not that sky Dink.\" Kayla laughed. Ironically the two were so alike. Cold, pretty, and unpredictable. Yes, they do not get together in this chapter. Deal with it and find a cookie to munch on. Alright guys, this is probably gonna be the last story in a while...or at least until summer. If anyone wants to take over, just PM me! I already have people who have asked to use my ideas. Please, because I kinda wanna delete this story, but I want it to keep going, so if you have any interest in continuing WHATSOEVER...just tell me. Thanks Guys! I'll miss you!

Ali sighed as she lay on her bed and looking up at the ceiling it had been a full year since she found out she was King Arthur reincarnated. Miles loved to remind her of his powers whenever he could she would just smile at her friend. Will and Ali had dated for a few months until they realised that they were better as friends. Will always managed to keep her grounded whenever she felt that the legacy was too much for her he would be right their to remind her how brilliant she was as he would say. Marco had only just stopped his bowing at her she had insisted for months for him to stop at least he didn't fully bow on one knee unless they were in private. He would tip his head forward towards her people around them would luck strangely at them. True to his word he became her protector whether she want him to or not. Not that she needed protecting now that Mordred well Mr Moore had been arrested for trying to attack them but he insisted on walking with her to school and all her classes which for the most part she shared with him. He would watch her when she ran on the track team and he would wait for her to get change before walking home with her. He took his calling seriously and hated to leave her at home alone always insisting if she needed to go anyway she had to ring him. She got an earful the first time she didn't call him she had tripped during her run and had to call someone to help he wasn't happy. He has now started to run with her in the mornings which she likes the company but he doesn't say much Will runs with them sometimes and he can't stop talking. Ali sighed again before reaching for her phone it was only 8 o'clock and tomorrow was Saturday so she knew he would be up. \"Ali what's wrong has something happen?\" he quizzed. She laughed at his concern \"no nothing Marco I was gonna go for a run wanna come\" she asked. Now if it was Will he would have answered with an 'of course' reply or something cheeky but Marco just said ok and that he would be over very soon. Marco didn't like parental figures much so Ali's parents had never met him even though they asked her constantly to bring him round since she spent just as much time with him as she does with Miles. She shook her thoughts out her head and quickly changed into her running gear. Her parents were in the kitchen when she came downstairs. \"Honey where are you off too at this time of night\" asked her mother. \"Oh just for a run I can't concentrate on school work so I'd thought I'd try and clear my head\" she explained. \"Your not going out at this time alone Ali\" said he father sternly. Ali just chuckled \"I'm not gonna be alone I called Marco he's gonna come and run with me\". Both Ali's mum and dad looked at each other with a smirk \"when will we get to meet this Marco\" asked her mother. Ali shrugged \"I dunno he doesn't like par… I mean teachers much\" she said before laughing at the look on her parents faces. Her laughing was cut short by her phone ringing \"hey Marco … yes I'll be right out ….. Ok bye sorry mom dad but I gotta go be back soon\". She rushed out quickly Marco was wait a little further down the street for her he greeted her with a boy he had stopped in public but when it was just them he still did it. \"Your highness\" he said before turning around and slowly starting to run Ali sighed and ran to catch up with him. They ran through the park when Ali noticed the tree where she met with will so many times she veered away from Marco which caused him to race to catch her up to which she just laughed. She stopped at the tree and climbed up gesturing to Marco to do the same which he reluctantly did. \"What are we doing here your highness?\" he asked confusedly as he looked around making sure she was in a safe position. \"What have I told you about calling me your highness I hate it even in private I'm not a Queen or a Princess not in this life\" she groaned. Marco just sat looking at her seeing if she was serious realising she was he himself sighed. \"You are to me\" he said simply not looking at her as he did if he had he would of seen her shocked expression with a slight pink tint to her cheeks. She didn't know what to say to that she knew what he meant it was his duty to protect the new king Arthur but she couldn't help the feeling that arose in her. She did think he was quite good looking and he could make her feel so safe the way he would look after her sometimes left her in a flush. \"Marco …..\" she started but didn't know what else to say. \"Yes your highness\" he enquired after she become silent. She racked her brains for something to say and blurted out the first thing that came into her head \"my parents want to me you\". Marco shook his head \"you know I don't do parents\" he explained before jumping down and reaching up to help her down. Normally she jumped down herself to show him she could but this time she moved down and slowly lowered herself with his help. He hands were hooked you her arms as he slowly lowered her down so he could lower her safely he was standing quite near the tree so as she came down she could feel his chest sliding against her stomach and chest. Their faces passed within an inch of each other she couldn't take her eyes of his. He in turn never took his eyes of hers as she came to a stop she was just a foot smaller than him. She held her breath as she waited for him to move or step back but for a time he didn't until he realised how close they were and stepped back. She shook herself and remembered what she had asked \"erm …. Yeah I know but they want to meet all my friends and tomorrow we are having a bbq so as your king, queen whatever I am ordering you to come\". He smirked at her then nodded \"if it is your wish\" he said causing her heart to skip a beat again. She nodded and set of determine to get thoughts of being close to him out of her head. The next day she informed her parents that they were going to meet Marco they seem overly thrilled. As she helped make the salad her phone went of \"hey Marco ….. Ok I'll be right there\" she hung up and sighed. \"Is he not coming?\" her mother enquired. \"Yes he is\" said Ali so matter of factly her mother had to laugh. She went to the same place she had met him that night and smiled as she saw him nervously pacing to and fro near his car. He was dressed in his usual black T and jeans but they seemed not as worn in as the rest of his clothes. \"What's wrong?\" she asked as she stopped him from pacing he looked so lost she couldn't help the giggle that came out. He stopped and glared at her \"well I am glad you find this so amusing\" he said she quickly grabbed his arms to stop him from pacing again. She gasped as he hands touched his bared skin she hadn't realised he had bunched up his sleeves. She looked up into his eyes and for a spilt second thought she saw a flicker of desire in his eyes. Not really thinking she moved one hand up to the back of his neck and pulled him down she touched her lips to his in a gentle kiss. Quickly realising what she had done she stepped away \"that was to …erm … to erm….. Help settle your nerves down\" she explained. He nodded too surprised to say anything she then quickly gripped his arm and led him towards her house and her parents. Love or hate let me know[Chapter 2] I apologise for all the mistakes in the last one when they story is flowing I type so fast I don't realise I have added a letter or left one out. I don't always have time to re read it through but I will try and keep on top of it. Ali pulled Marco inside towards the kitchen where her mother was still finishing off the food. \"Mom this is Marco\" greeted Ali as she let go of his arm Marco unsure of what to do bowed his head slightly in respect. \"It's an honour to meet you miss …\" he trailed of realizing he didn't know Ali's last name he looked at Ali for help who just covered her mouth and tried not to laugh. Her mother blushed at the courtesy \"oh dear call me Helen\" she gushed as she held out her hand for him to shake. He then helped Ali and her mother take out the salad and drinks. \"You must be Marco I'm John Ali's father\" greeted Ali's dad as she removed the oven mitt and held out his hand. Marco approached him and took the offered hand he nodded his head in response. He stood awkwardly next to Ali's father as he started cooking the burgers he could see he was gonna burn them he looked at Ali and her mother then back at the burgers. \"Erm …. Why don't I take over from you\" Marco offered john looked up surprised then at Ali and Helen who tried to hide their laughter. \"Ok young man sure that would be good\" he handed over the tongs and went over to Helen and Ali. Helen shooed John away and sat Ali down on the bench nearest them she smirked at Ali then looked back at Marco. \"So ….\" She enquired staring intently at her daughter which caused her to blush she knew what her mother was asking her she just didn't want to admit anything. \"So what?\" she asked feigning innocence her mother gave her a look that said 'you know what' and then looked back at Marco who seemed intent on the burgers. Ali sighed \"he's a friend mum that's all ok\" her mother didn't look convinced and raised her eyebrow at her daughter, \"You sure he looks at you like …. I dunno like he would fight an evil wizard to rescue you or something he keeps glancing over here only looking at you\" she said with a whimsical look on her face. Ali laughed at her mother's words he had done that to a degree some months before \"mom your fantasising he looks over her cause he is in a strange place were he only knows one person wouldn't u want to be near the one person you knew in a strange place\". Her mother thought a moment then seemed satisfied with the answer and left it at that leaving Ali sat their to help her father with the table. Later on that day Ali and Marco were sat alone in the garden just on the grass facing each other warming themselves on the sun while Helen and John discreetly watched from inside. The silence was started to make Ali nervous he had barely said two words to her since she had kissed him he was nice with her parents but he barely spoke to her. Finally the silence got to her she pushed him slightly causing him to look up in surprise and shock. \"Will you please just say something to me the silent treat is starting to annoy me\" she demanded. He looked at her confused \"I haven't been giving you the silent treatment\" he explained. \"Yes you have you've barely said two words to me all day ever since I ki…\" she trailed off whilst blushing at the memory of his lips on hers. He too seemed lost in the memory for a moment before he shook himself \"I'm not giving you the silent treatment and that can never happen again your highness\". He said so matter of factly before standing up and returning inside he bid his goodbyes to her parents and then left. Ali sat shock for a second before running after him. \"Why\" she shouted as she caught up to him she gripped his arm to stop him \"why can't it ever happen again\" she said anger in her voice. He sighed \"because Ali your King Arthur and I am a knight sworn to protect you nothing can happen between us despite what we feel\" he said before turning back around. Ali was shocked \"what WE feel? You mean you feel something for me?\" she said in a whisper not daring to believe it. \"No that's not what I meant I just meant it can't happen no matter what\" he said he winced when he saw the hurt look flash across Ali's face before it turned to anger. \"WE DON'T LIVE IN THE OLDEN DAYS I'M NOT SOME FAIRYTALE QUEEN WHO NEEDS A PROTECTOR SO FROM NOW ON LEAVE ME THE HELL ALONE\" she yelled at him before running back home and straight up to her room. She slammed the door and locked it refusing to talk to anyone she just cried against her pillow muttering 'stupid Marco' over and over again. I know it's a lil short but let me know ok[Chapter 3] Thank you all for the reviews so glad you are enjoying the story please keep reading. I also apologise for all the mistakes that may appear I don't always have time to re read through. Ali walked into school the next day she was slightly relived and disappointed to not see Marco waiting at his usual spot. She didn't see him as she walked into school either she was again relived and disappointed to not see him. She spent the next week with her head down she focused intently on the lessons and track but then she just floated around Miles, Will, Lance and Gwen tried to cheer her up but they didn't really know what was up. One night she decided to go running she got herself ready and waved goodbye to her parents. She started to feel better as she jogged the wind rushing past her face and the sound of the trees as she pasted them. She was so intent on her rhythm she didn't notice the sound of another pair of feet behind her until she felt the hands around her wrist pulling her to stop. She screamed in surprise until a hand clasped around her mouth to silence her. \"Shh your majesty we don't wanna be interrupted right now\" the stranger hissed in her ear she immediately stiffened \"Mordred sends his regards\". She looked at the man's face in fear as he grinned evilly before he could do anything else he was gripped from behind and flung backwards. Ali fell forward as the man was forced back and she watched as s stranger fought off her attacker. She was too shocked and numb to really comprehend what was happening until a pair of warm hands cupped her face. She looked up into the face of her champion she gasped to see the worried face of Marco. He scanned her over worriedly she was too still and quiet for his liking he finally looked into her eyes. \"Ali, Ali are you ok please tell me your ok\" he asked shaking her a little to wake her up her heart skipped at his obvious concern but then it was replaced by anger when she remember his no show for the last week. She pushed his hands away angrily and got up brushing off the leaves that stuck to her trousers and started walking away. He got up and slowly walked after her after ten minutes she stopped and turned glaring at him. \"What the hell are you doing, you're gone for a week and now you suddenly show up\" she accused. He sighed \"just because you couldn't see me doesn't mean I wasn't there you told me to leave you alone and I did I just made sure you couldn't see me\" he explained calmly. She glared at him before starting to walk away again \"Ali wait\" he called out causing her to stop she looked back at him and waited. He didn't know what to say he could see she was about to go again so he did the one thing he knew she wanted. He moved to her gripped her neck and crashed his lips to hers and pulled her as close to him as he could. Ali was momentarily shocked before responding she wrapped her arms around his neck and moaned into his mouth. Marco tried to hold back a moan he had started this to keep her with him but now with the feel of her pressed against him he was losing his control. He backed her up against the nearest tree his resolve slipped as he pushed up against her he allowed his moan to slip through. Ali smiled when she heard it she knew how he was making her feel and to hear she was making him feel the same was empowering. He finally pulled back catching his breath she stood back at arms length \"you have no idea how hard it has been for me the past week keeping away from you\". Ali gasped \"Ali I hated that I caused you pain I wanted to protect you and I thought that if anything happened between us I wouldn't be able to protect you properly but I can't stay away any longer\" he said through a pained voice. \"It almost killed me to stay away so I'm not going to anymore\" he said finally before crashing his lips to hers again. She smiled into the kiss and wrapped hers hands around his neck again. When he pulled back this time he kept his body connected to hers and rested his forehead against hers breathing deep. Ali smiled at him bringing her hand up and resting it on his cheek he looked up and smiled at her in return. \"I am so glad you've come to your sense's\" she chuckled before touching her lips to his for a slow kiss he chuckled against her lips before responding in kind. Here you go sorry its short let me know[Chapter 4] Thank you all for the reviews so glad you are enjoying the story please keep reading. I also apologise for all the mistakes that may appear I don't always have time to re read through. Also sorry for the long wait been mad busy hopefully this is worth the wait. Ali smile as she woke up the next morning after the kiss Marco had walked her home holding her hand tightly they hadn't talked much but she didn't care she just loved walking with him. He had kissed her again before leaving to go home himself she had walked inside with a goofy smile her mum spotted her and smiled knowingly at her daughter which caused Ali to blush. She quickly got dressed and collected all her things before rushing downstairs and through her breakfast \"bye mom bye dad\" she called as she raced out the door leaving her mother chuckling and her father confused. She could see him waiting for her at his usual spot he was leaning against his car wearing his signature black skinny jeans and top. He smiled a genuine smile as he noticed her approaching she was always amazed at his smiles he never really smiled much but when he did it was breathtaking. \"Morning\" she greeted as she stopped in front of him he smiled at her again and gripped her waist and pulled her flush against him. He bent his head down and captured her lips in a passionate kiss. \"Morning\" he greeted back once he finally released her lips she looked dazed for a moment before grinning back and wrapping her arms around his neck and pulling his head down for another kiss. They finally released each other enough to get in the car and drive to school. Miles was waiting for them as they pulled up he was forever fiddling with his lion pen he did it more when he was nervous. Ali and Marco shared a smile before getting out and walking upto their friend. \"Finally I was beginning to worry\" he said with a slight hint of panic in his voice Marco became increasingly concerned. \"Why? What's wrong? What have you seen?\" he asked Miles relaxed and smirked at the pair which gave Ali an uneasy feeling. \"Oh I have seen a few interesting things lately but nothing that will cause any danger\" he said. Ali blushed while Marco looked confused \"What have you seen lately?\" he asked genuinely confused Ali blushed even darker as Miles smirked again. \"I saw what happened between the two of you last night I had the vision of that guy attacking Ali I was gonna call and warn her but then I saw you save her and I saw what happened after\" he explained. Marco paled he hadn't thought about people finding out he was new to the whole dating thing he wasn't sure he was ready for all that. Ali could see his distress and she was thinking the same she wasn't sure she wanted people knowing about them until they were both ready. \"Miles were trying to keep that quiet ok don't tell anyone alright\" she explained Miles just smirked again and nodded before walking off Marco looked at her gratefully before following their friend into school. The day passed but uneventfully for the pair they tried to steal moments alone together but that was proving difficult Will, Lance and or Gwen would pop up every time just wanting to chat. They finally got time alone when Marco drove Ali home from practice luckily Marco watching her during practice and taking her home was a common thing that no one battered an eyelid at them. When he first started hanging around her at school and watching her practices and driving her to and from school, the entire was whispering about the god knows what they were saying about them but Ali and Marco didn't really care or notice. He pulled up at his usual spot and turned of the engine Ali smiled at him she was nervous but found it reassuring that he appeared just as nervous as she did. \"Marco I just want to be sure I know we want to keep this quiet I just need to know what this is?\" she asked. He gulped he knew she was gonna ask that question in truth he didn't know he knew he liked her and wanted to spend more time with her but not like before. When they spent time together before he was always on the look out for anything and anyone that could hurt her he hadn't really talked to her properly he was usually just a presence near her. He would like to just spend time talking, kissing and touching her he had never really had a girlfriend before his duty took up most of his time which he didn't mind but now was a chance to really be with someone. \"Look I'm not sure what this is I'm new to all this so how about we just see where it takes us and label it later\" he offered she smiled at his answer and nodded completely agreeing. He smiled and leaned over and cupped her cheek he stared into her eyes as he brought his head forward and captured her lips in a heated kiss. They were so absorbed in the kiss that they failed to notice two pairs of eyes on them from further down the street. Love or hate let me know please[Chapter 5] Thank you all for all your comments sorry I haven't updated in a while my laptop loves to play up on me all the time. Ali's parents smiled to each other and they watched their daughter walk slowly towards their house with a dazed look on her face. They had seen the kiss Ali had shared with Marco and they couldn't be happier. They didn't care that Marco wasn't like the typical boys they should want for their daughter he was a sweet boy who seemed to care a great deal for Ali. He seemed to be like a knight of old the ones who would fight to protect the woman they love even die for her. Helen loved the romantic side to the legends she teaches and has always wanted to know what it felt like to be loved the way Marco loves Ali now she loved John with all her heart but he wasn't the most observant of men. She was happy that at least her daughter would know what it felt like to be completely loved to the point that they would die for you. Ali finally made it inside and noticed her parents amused faces she looked back and realised they saw everything that had just happen. Ali's face turned red before bolting upstairs and closing her bedroom door she couldn't believe her parents had just seen her kiss Marco after everything Ali had said to her mum that day when he came to the bbq. Ali lay on her bed and looked up at the ceiling she couldn't believe she was with Marco the resident bad boy. She chuckled 'bad boy' she thought 'yeh right he is anything but' she remembered when she first saw him he was picking on Miles. At that time she had thought he was just the typical school bully picking on someone smaller and smarter then him trying to make him self appear hard. She was never scared of him even when he seemed intent on scaring her she just ignored him and stayed out of his way as best she could. Now that she knows him better she can see through all the bravado he puts out he really is a nice guy with a mission in life not many people can say that and his mission is to protect her. She knows that being with her was never part of his mission and he is worried that it will effect how he does his job but Ali is happy he is at least willing to try. Ali's mind went back to the kiss they had just shared it had been amazing she was inexperienced when it came to being kissed but that one had left her speechless. Her thoughts were interrupted by her phone buzzing she reached into her pocket and smiled it was a text from Marco. M – Hey what are you up to? A – Hey nothing much just hiding from parents they saw us Marco smiled he could imagine Ali's face would of been bright red at being caught personally he didn't mind he was glad it was them and not someone for school. M – Lol how red is your face Ali glared at the phone imagining it was his head. A – My face isn't red M – Yeah ok if you say so anyway if you're not busy do you fancy going for a run Ali eagerly responded back and started getting changed into her running gear. A – Yeah ok meet you at usual place in 5 Ali raced down the stairs and said a quick goodbye to her parents who simply chuckled at her. Ali raced down the street and smiled Marco was already down their waiting for her she smiled as she walked up she didn't know whether to just stand in front of him or wrap her arms around his neck. She didn't know which one he would be ok with she knew what she wanted to do she wanted to wrap her arms around his strong neck and pull him flush against her but she didn't want to chase him away after he finally admitted how he felt. She made it to him and he surprised her by wrapping his arms around her waist and leaning his head down and capturing her lips in his own. She instantly wrapped her arms around his neck and deepened the kiss he gave her a genuine smile as he pulled his head back. \"You were already here waiting for me what if I had said no\" she said with a chuckle he laughed with her and shrugged his shoulders. \"I would of gone home\" he said as if it was the most obvious thing in the world she laughed and pulled him down for another kiss before pushing him playfully away and running off. He quickly gave chase which caused her to squeal in delight he found himself laughing along with her for the first time in years he was actually happy. They ran for awhile before finally stopping beside the large tree that they had sat on before instead of sitting facing each other like they had before they now sat with Ali in-between his legs leaning back against his chest. Marco leant his head down and placed his chin in the crook of her neck he angled her head to accommodate him better. He moved her hair aside so that her neck was bare to him he gave her a quick kiss and pulled back to gauge her reaction. He had heard her gasp and for a second he thought he had done the wrong thing until she moved her neck again showing more of her neck to him. He smiled as he leaned forward again and placed a series of kisses on her neck. Ali closed her eyes and the pleasurable sensation she loved the feel of his lips on her skin one of his arms that was around her waist came up and cupped her head moving it so she was now facing him. He captured her lips in a very heated kiss it was so heated that she didn't notice him push his other hand up her top to touch the skin on her stomach until she felt his cold hands. She pulled back and a moan escaped her Marco smirked at her whilst attacking her neck again this time she let the moan flow through her lips. Ali could feel how she was affecting him the proof was poking into her lower back she should of pushed him away but she felt empowered that she was getting this reaction from him and she hadn't even touched him. \"ALI! Marco!\" came a shout which caused the pair to jump in surprise and stare in shock at the unwelcomed interruption. Love or hate let me know[Chapter 6] All I seem to be doing is apologising for not updating sooner but I am sincerely sorry for making you wait hope it was worth it. Ali and Marco shot down of the tree and tried to right themselves before they were found Marco did everything he could to rid himself of his arousal even thinking of his mum. Ali could see his problem and stood infront of him as their unwelcome guest came closer hoping to help him without looking embarrassed. Ali sighed as Miles came in to view she tried to not let her annoyance of her first friend to show on her gave he looked like he had just run a marathon. When he finally reached them he stopped for air panting as he tried to calm his breathing. Ali softened towards him she knew he wasn't the running type she made sure she still blocked Miles view of Marco as she approached him and patted his back. \"You ok Miles\" she asked as she chuckled at his red face as he stood up even Marco started laughing at him which for Miles was unusual. \"I (pant) had a (pant) vision\" he managed to get out those words were like an instant cold shower to Marco when Miles had a vision that made him get so out of shape to find them meant only bad news. He came up and both Ali and Marco waited painstakingly long for him to be able to talk without losing his breath. He finally regained his normal breathing rhythm and stood up and looked and his two friends. \"I saw you get attacked by a man wearing Mordred's sign\" he said Ali smiled \"that already happened a few nights ago Miles\" Miles shook his head quickly. \"No I saw that one but I also saw Marco protect you so I didn't need to get to you but this one hasn't happened yet from the feel of the vision it will happen within the week I think\" Marco became instantly on guard. Ali sighed she knew that this means he'll be even more intense and less like the boyfriend he should be. Miles looked confused at her reaction but decided to store it away for later he would ask her when they were alone. Marco escorted her back home and even though he didn't like it he left her with her parents he knew they would not attack her when she was there. He went home and to his mum's surprise went to Will and started secretly talking. Marco and Will were thinking of ways to protect Ali Will would fill Lance and Gwen in, in the morning. When they were finished Marco's mum called Marco to come to her he slowly walked up to her in the kitchen wondering what she wanted. \"When do I get to meet her?\" she asked causing Marco to look surprise Will had walked into the kitchen not long after Marco and smiled at the question and stopped to hear the answer. Marco glared at Will \"who you talking about?\" he asked hoping against hope that she would drop it of even that will would help him out but the look from his step brother gave him a sinking feeling he was on his own. \"Oh don't pull that one you know who I am on about these past few weeks I have seen a change in you your even talking and laughing with Will there has to be a girl for this sudden change or is it a boy?\" she asked to his horror. Will look like he wanted to burst out laughing at that last question Marco looked horrified did his mother really think he was gay? \"No mum I'm into girls and does there have to be a girl for me to have changed I am capable on my own you know\" he said as if a little hurt hoping she took the bait. \"Oh come off it Marco all of us know you have a thing for Ali I know you said you would erm help her out with school stuff but we all see the way you look at her and the way she looks at you\" Will said causing Marco to turned red. He hadn't realised he had been that obvious they all knew he was Ali's self-proclaimed protector but they couldn't know about his other feelings towards her. Marco's mum smiled \"oh Ali is it I remember her isn't she your ex Will?\" she turned with a smile Will nodded and shrugged his shoulders \"yeah but its ok me and Ali just never got that into each other we realised we were better friends then boyfriend and girlfriend its ok for Marco to date Ali in fact I give my blessing\" he said whilst patting Marco's shoulder before leaving him in the kitchen with his mum. Marco wanted to deck Will right then if only he had shut up his mother would still be in the dark he hadn't wanted anyone to know about them yet Miles did only cause he saw it and that couldn't be helped. \"Oh that's wonderful we must have her over here one day even her parents we'll have a little party you can invite some of your friends Will too\" she beamed Marco wanted to badly scream no but again Will butted in. \"That's great I'll start calling round we can do it tomorrow it's a Saturday so everyone should be cool to come\" Will was on the stairs as Marco whipped round and barrelled after him Will managed to make it to his room and lock it he laughed as Marco banged on the door. Ali was surprised to hear about the party but chuckled as Will told her about what had happened with Marco's mum she wanted to scold Will but she found it too funny. Her parents agreed quickly eager to meet some new people Miles, Lance and Gwen were all happy to make it they would miss it for the world. The next day Marco was a bundle of nerves he didn't know how he should react with Ali there with his and her parents. He hoped she would know what to do but unfortunately for him Ali was just as nervous as him so nervous she was bouncing around the house. Love or hate let me know[Chapter 7] So sorry guys that I have made some of you wait so long I hope this chapter makes up for it. Marco and Ali stood awkwardly beside each other and their families and friends filtered around the garden making conversation and enjoying themselves. Both their parents would occasionally look at the pair and chuckle to themselves. Marco kept on giving Will glare after glare when he caught him looking over at him and Ali and laughing. Gwen would hit Will every time he did Marco guessed she must know what it's like to be in their shoes he liked her a little more for that. Eventually Miles came over and chuckled at the pair \"will you two relax this is supposed to be a party and practically everyone here knows you two are together so just enjoy being a couple it might be a long time till you can again\". Marco glared whilst Ali sighed \"ok one people here don't practically know, thanks to you and Will they completely know, which FYI wasn't something we wanted people to know yet and two we're not exactly comfortable acting like a couple infront of people we know ok so lay off\". Miles just chuckled and walked away Marco looked at Ali and smiled \"thanks\" he muttered quietly he knew Ali was ok with doing all the usual girlfriend and boyfriend stuff infront of people it was him that was uncomfortable with it. She smiled and took a step closer so that she could hold his hand without most people seeing at least at first. He smiled down at her not a full smile he does when they are alone but a small one that suited him just as well. Ali's quickly glance over to the rest of the gathering and smiled for the first time that afternoon she and Marco were not being watched. Ali looked up at Marco and winked he looked confused until he felt her tug at his hand towards the back gate that led to a path that brought them out to the front of the house. They slipped away unnoticed slowly at first until they were clear and quickly sped away \"you do realise this is gonna give them some ammo against us right?\" he asked her as she led him god knows where. She smiled \"yeah but we were also doing that just stood there at least this way we don't have to see them sneaking glances at us and whispering obviously talking about us\" he laughed at her logic and totally agreed. Marco hated being the centre of attention he always liked to just bend into the background let everyone ignore him he didn't mind there was only one person he wanted to take notice of him and she finally had. Marco had been so intent on scoping his surroundings for danger to Ali that he failed to notice where they were headed until she was unlocking her door. He looked around confused how had they gotten hear so quick on foot had he been that out of it. He wondered what they were doing here whilst Ali walked in leaving the door open for him to follow he slowly walked in suddenly having a bad feeling. It wasn't the type of feeling that he got when he knew danger was close to Ali it was the type that made him worry that something was about to happen that he had no control over or any clue how to deal with it. Ali led him through the house and up to her bedroom she sat comfortably on the bed waiting for him to enter she held a laugh in when she saw him slowly and cautiously enters her room. He walked over to the chair near her table and sat down and looked at her expectantly and this time Ali couldn't help but laugh he looked so awkward and out of place such a dark figure sat in her room. \"What's so funny?\" he asked really confused he couldn't see what was so funny she managed to stop herself and regain her breathing. \"Come here Marco\" she asked patting the space next to her on the bed he hesitated for a while she thought he was gonna shake his head and then leave but instead he inched slowly towards her. She didn't think he could look anymore awkward when he was sat on the chair but he proved her wrong when he finally sat down on her bed he looked worse. Ali smiled and took hold of his hand an action which caused him to be suspicious. They both just stared at each other neither moving neither wanting to break the moment it was something Marco wasn't used to and Ali wasn't exactly an expert on the subject either. Slowly they moved closer Ali looked from his eyes to his lips and back up again ever since the other night when Miles had interrupted them she had been consumed with the feel of his lips against hers. They were now a hairs breath away from each other neither taking that last step or moving away they just sat there looking into each other's eyes. Ali wanted to close the gap but she didn't want to seem desperate or anything or too clingy so she waited for him to make the first move. After what seemed like hours to Ali he finally leant forward and claimed her lips with his. The kiss started out slow before Ali deepened it after awhile the angle was hurting her neck so she lifted herself up and straddled his lap never breaking contact. He was momentarily surprised by her actions but then with the new position he seemed even closer to her a feeling he realised he liked very much. Ali wrapped her arms around his neck whilst one of his wrapped around her waist and the other was ever so slowly rubbing along her arms and side. Ali tried to stay quiet but they feelings he was provoking in her was new and exciting Will had made her feel good when they were together but it was nothing like this he moved with experienced hands at least that's what she thought. She had no idea that he was as new to this as she was and he was basically going with the motions an old friend of his had told him about his first time and he had said that all he did was go with whatever he was feeling. So that's all Marco was doing and so far it seemed like she was enjoying whatever he was doing so he didn't stop. He knew they weren't gonna get interrupted their parents and friends were all at the party thank god for his mum organising that. Marco turned them around and laid Ali down so he was hovering over her there kiss continued getting more heated by the second. Eventually the need for air broke them up but he didn't stop there he started kissing down her neck and back up. Ali couldn't control herself she let out a loud moan that had Marco grinning from ear to ear that was by far one of the sexiest things he had ever heard. He hissed when he felt her hands slid up his back underneath his shirt. She pushed it up until he finally took the hint and removed it and threw on the floor her hands immediately found his bare skins which caused him to gasp and her to smile. He closed his eyes and just enjoyed the feel of her hands on him she smiled even wider he looked so content she gasped though when he opened his eyes and looked at her with such passion it took her breath away. Marco crashed his lips onto hers Ali responded eagerly he groaned in frustration when he couldn't feel her skin so he placed his hand on her hip just under her top and looked at her for permission. Ali looked undecided for a second until she bit her lip and nodded he went slowly as he removed her top she blush bright red she still had her bra on but it was still slightly embarrassing no one had seen her like this before. He lifted her face to meet his and whispered \"beautiful\" she smiled and pulled him down for another kiss. Marco wanted to go further but he wasn't sure how Ali would feel about it so he restrained himself as best as he could but it was getting harder the more they continued. Eventually Marco pulled away and lifted himself up slightly so he was crushing her and so he could clear his head he closed his eyes and took several deep breaths. Ali looked at him confusedly \"what's wrong Marco? Why did you stop?\" she covered herself slightly self conscious now that he was still. He opened his eyes and smiled before removing her arms \"nothing is wrong I just need a moment if we don't stop now I might not be able to stop later\". Ali blushed at the images that brought up and then taking a deep breath she moved her arms up behind her and removed her bra. He looked at her uncertainly asking her if she was sure she smiled and placed a hand on his face and pulled him down \"yes I am now kiss me\". He happily did as he was told unfortunately his full attention was on Ali as it should be but if he had been looking outside through Ali's bedroom window he would see a cloaked figure watching them and waiting. Let me know what you think hopefully you don't hate it.[Chapter 8] So glad your all enjoying my story I hope none of you are disappointed here goes. Ali smiled as the sun shone through the curtains and shone across the very well defined chest of Marco as he lay sleeping. She had woken up almost ten minutes earlier at first confused until her mind slowly came back she had turned as carefully as she could and smiled. She watched him sleep he looked so peaceful and carefree as if he had no troubles in this world Ali knew that once he was awake he would probably smile but she would be able to see the hidden feelings in his eyes. He would be on major alert ever since Miles had told them of the latest vision Marco had been even paranoid and controlling. He wouldn't be happy unless he knew where she was all the time she would never admit to him or anyone else but she really loved that about him and now with this happening it felt even better. He was so different to Will in his physique not that she ever slept with Will but the times they went swimming Will had an impressive upper body from his years of football but Marco's was lightly more toned and tanned. She heard her parents downstairs and paniced as she looked at her door it was unlocked she blushed bright red at the thought of her parents possibly coming in and seeing them naked in her bed. Her parents weren't prudes they knew Ali would never do this with just anyone they knew that if or rather when she did it in high school it will be with someone she really cares about so they won't mind him being her but she still didn't want them seeing anything. She got up as quietly as she could and picked up the nearest shirt she could find which turned out to be one of Marco's he had worn his usual dark t-shirt with a black shirt over it for the party. She buttoned up his shirt and quietly walked to her door and locked it before they could come in. When she turned back around she found him sat up looking at her sleepily he seemed to find trouble remembering where he was until it finally clicked in his he turned to her with the shyest of smiles. That was until he noticed what she was wearing his shirt only his shirt his mind flashed to the night before imagining what lay under the fabric she walked over to him straddling him on the bed. He smirked at her before crashing his lips to hers before they could get too carried away a knock startled them apart. \"Ali sweetie it's time to get up\" came her mothers voice Ali blushed before replying \"I'm up mum just getting dressed\" neither moved until they finally heard her mothers footsteps on the stairs. Marco quickly found his clothes whilst Ali found her she was however very reluctant to give Marco back his shirt but she eventually did. Marco climbed out the window which lucking had a trelless attached to it Ali went downstairs to make sure that neither of her parents noticed Marco leaving. Helen and john smiled as they greeted their daughter she kept a close eye on the windows whilst she talked halfheartedly to her parents over breakfast. Helen noticed her distracted behaviour and smiled \"oh goodness sake Ali Marco got off cleanly before we could see him it's your behaviour drawing attention to him\" Ali stared in absolute shock 'they knew, they knew what we did oh my god'. \"Sorry gotta go\" she rushed out the house as if it was on fire leaving her parents chuckling after her john turned to his wife \"I'm not sure she wanted us to know dear that was the point of him sneaking out her window\" Helen smiled. \"I know dear but I couldn't help it\" Helen was beeming they had noticed their daughters and Marco's disappearance a little later in the evening but paid no mind to it they had enjoyed themselves immensely at the party and was reluctant to go but they had too. When they returned to the house they check in on their daughter but before they could open the door they heard sounds strange sounds coming from inside. Both knew instantly what was happening and should have been angry that their teenage daughter was sleeping with a boy she had only been seeing for awhile but they knew their daughter would not so something so important unless she truly cared for the boy which was soon comfirmed as both Ali and Marco suddenly called out 'I love you' to the other which had her parents smiling. They had left their daughter to it and retired to bed themselves Helen had checked on her daughter the next morning and could not take her eyes of the look on her daughters face Ali looked amazingly happy as did Marco's face. Ali ran as fast as she could not really taking any noticed to where she was going she simply needed to get away from her family 'oh my god this is bad this is very bad' she thought over and over again. She finally stopped next to the tree she had first kissed Marco beside she bent over to catch her breath and calm her racing heart she had no idea how she could face her parents ever again after this it would never be possible. She sat lost in her thoughts not really taking in her surroundings which is probably why a voice from the hill above scared her that she actually jumped before turning to the figure who was cloaked by the sun. \"Well, well lookie what I found all alone\" she froze unable to take her eyes on the man as he decended towards her she couldn't believe he was here she never thought she would ever see him again well she hoped. \"What they hell do you want?\" she asked with as much venom in her voice as she could muster which wasn't much since she was still a little out of breath from running. The man chuckled \"now, now play nice\" he said before taking a step forward which had her stepping back. \"Go away!\" she yelled as loud as she could hoping someone would hear and rescue her but no one came it was still early in the morning. \"Now that's no way to speak to me come on lets go somewhere and talk your little lover boy will just get in the way if he shows up so lets not be here when he comes\" he said before grabbing her arm and clamping a hand over her mouth leading her to god knows where. Let me know love or hate please[Chapter 9] Thank you all for your amazing reviews and DannyHound I hope it was worth the wait and the nagging for you lol. Marco walked home once he managed to get clear of Ali's his head was full of a thousand thoughts the main ones were of what he and Ali had shared last night. Now he will admit that when it comes to girls there is no shortage wanting the local self proclaimed bad boy even after he amended his ways once he realised who was King Arthur. Even with all the girls there hadn't been one in particular that he wanted to sleet with no one seemed like the right one and then with his duties as a member of the order of the bear he didn't really have any time anyway. He was glad that Ali was the one she hadn't begged him and tried to act slutty like a lot of the girls that use to hang around him and his old friends did. She was just as inexperienced as he was and he wouldn't admit out loud to anyone but he liked that no one had touched like that. He loved how she felt against him and how he could make her feel the sounds she was making were intoxicating and a great ego boost since it was he that was making her feel like that. He was also a little troubled about it though he had let his guard down last night and focused mainly on her which was a great thing to do but if someone had attacked her then what would he have done he would have been unprepared. He knew what he would have to do and he knew Ali won't like it Marco didn't like it but it was something that have to be done. He was gonna have to say to Ali that until this threat was stopped what happened last night can't happen again afterwards yeah sure it could but not until. Marco quickly made it to his house and made a fast track to his room hoping not to be spotted by anyone his mom would be in the kitchen and he hoped Will wouldn't be up yet but there was no such luck for him. Will was just coming out the bathroom when he noticed Marco he looked him over and noticed he was wearing the same clothes as yesterday and if he thought about it he couldn't remember him coming back after him and Ali sneaked off. Will started to smirk as the realisation of what his step brother has been doing \"well, well Marco did you just get in?\" he asked pretending to feign innocence but failing. Marco just glared at him and refused to comment before going into his room but unfortunately Will followed. \"Go away Will\" Marco said almost begging Will just chuckled \"come on Marco tell me what happened please\" Will practically begged with a chuckle Marco just shook his head. \"Ok then if you won't tell me I will just guess\" he started waiting for a reaction from Marco \"I think after you sneaked off yesterday with Ali you went back to her place maybe straight away or maybe eventually and you spent the night in her room in her bed\". Will raised a curious eyebrow at Marco and then smirked Marco was looking at anything but Will which just confirmed it for him. Will started laughing and clapped Marco on the back Marco saw the smug look on Will's face and grabbed him by the arm and pushed him out of his room before closing and locking the door. He could hear Will's laughter as he walked away and it annoyed him how had he guessed completely right he wasn't ashamed to admit what happened but it wasn't something he wanted to be made public knowledge. Marco was and always will be a private person Ali is a little too not as much as him but enough to respect him and his privacy. Marco flopped down on his bed and picked up his phone and called Ali the sooner he told her the plan the better it will be he hoped. Helen – hello? Marco – hello Miss … I mean Helen is Ali there please H – Oh hello Marco no she isn't here she ran out of here ten to twenty minutes ago M – Why she run out? H – (Chuckling) I told her to stop looking out the window to see if you made it out without us seeing you Marco froze 'OMG they know' he couldn't think of anything to say or do his mind was a blank. H – Marco? Hello you still there? M – Erm yeah, yeah I'm still here do you err do you know where she went? H – No sorry she'll most likely be on the same route she runs on M – Thank you He hung up before she could say anything else and quickly changed and left Will was in the kitchen Marco had a bad feeling and decided that maybe it would be a good idea for a little back up. \"Oh good morning Marco you came in late last night\" said his mum oblivious to the fact that he has only just got in Will smirked \"yeah Marco you were real quiet\" Marco wanted to hit Will right then but decided against it. \"Yeah sorry mum Will can I talk to you\" Marco added he wasn't gonna explain why he was late and before his mother could ask he grabbed Will's arm for the second time that morning and dragged him out the house. \"What's up\" Will asked noticing the tone of Marco's voice \"I think something might have happened to Ali but I'm not sure\" Will nodded and followed Marco they both looked through the park and the usual spots where she runs but couldn't find anything. The stopped at the tree catching their breaths when they heard panting coming from up the hill \"Ali!\" Marco and Will recognised it as Miles he was rushing down the hill he stopped infront of the boys and tried to catch his breath. \"Miles what did you see?\" demanded Marco Miles held out a finger saying 'one minute' Will wanted to laugh at the kid he really wasn't athletic. Finally after what seemed like more than one minute he stood up and shook his head. \"I saw Ali being taken but I couldn't figure the time I thought I would get her in time normally my versions give me a few hours or days, weeks even to prevent it but this time I barely had anytime at all\" he explained looking panicked. Marco stopped the Merlin reincarnation from pacing and turned him to face him \"did you see who took her and where? Was it Mordred?\" he asked Miles shook his head. \"It wasn't Mordred and I don't think it was one of his goons they all usually look the same I can recognise the guy if I saw him again but I don't know who he is I think though that Ali knew him\" he said looking confused. Marco nodded and as calmly as he could he hatched a plan he needed to get all three of them into Ali's room and see if there was any clue as to who this guy was but how. Plus it also meant facing her parents and he so wasn't ready for that but he knew he would have to in order to save Ali. Marco, Will and Miles walked up to an empty house hope filled Marco's chest at the thought of her parents not being in he knocked on the door fingers crossed hoping beyond hope that no one will answer. Thankfully no one did for a second and a small wash of relief flooded through him then the realisation that they couldn't get into her room which was something they needed to do straight away. Marco looked at Will and Miles for suggestions if it had been before all of this when he was the bad boy he would of just broken in got what he wanted and then left but now times had changed he had changed. Will was stumped so was Miles until he looked down near the front door and noticed a small plant pot with fake flowers in it. \"I got it!\" he shouted making Marco and Will jump slightly he picked up the pot and turned it upside and slide open a secret compartment revealing a small hidden key. \"We could use this I'm sure they won't mind if they knew the reason behind it they don't even have to know\" said Miles with a hesitant look on his face Will and Marco shared his hesitation even though they weren't breaking in it was still trespassing. They made it quickly to her room and Marco had to stop himself from looking at the bed in case the memories distracted him. All three searched around her room until Miles came upon a box under her bed he pulled it out and opened it up. Inside were various pictures of Ali and her family when Ali was younger and there were some of Ali and her old friends in the many other places she has lived. Miles came across one picture of Ali stood smiling with a guy wrapped around her. Miles showed the picture to Marco and Will \"that's the guy I saw\" he said Marco didn't like how close this guy was to Ali in the picture but this happened well before anything happened between them so he couldn't be angry. He turned the picture over his mother always writes something on the back he was hoping Ali had that same trait and with great luck she did. The inscription read 'me and Gale before I left' . \"So this guy has Ali and we have no idea where she is\" stated Will Miles nodded before Marco looked pointedly at him. \"What!\" he asked in defence Marco sighed \"Think where is she you can do it\" he said Miles soon realised what he meant since learning who he is his visions haven't been any easier but he knew Ali needed him. Miles focused on Ali and gripped his head his head exploded in pain but it paid off he saw Ali tied to a chair in the school gym as soon as he told the guys they were off making sure to put the key back where they found it. They reached the school quickly and rushed to the gym hoping beyond hope that Ali was ok. Let me know what you all think please love or hate all is welcomed[Chapter 10] Hey guys thank you all so much for your patience with this story. It has been so hectic here. I just about moved house and I still aint sorted lol. I hope this chap will help. Just to let you know not many chapters left for this story. It was only supposed to be a short one anyway. Ali glared at gale as he sat across from her. Gale just smiled leering at her. Ali wanted to hurl, he was making her feel so grossed out. She tried her bindings again, but they hadn't changed still as tight as possible. \"What do you want with me Gale?\" she asked after failing again to break free. He shrugged his shoulders and continued leering at her. She was starting to get annoyed. \"Oh come on Ali, loosen up please\" he said as he moved his chair closer to hers. She tried moving her chair backwards but it was a little awkward to do. Gale put his hands on her shoulders and looked into her eyes. \"Ali, Ali, Ali\" he started \"it has been so long since we have seen each other and I get attitude from you?\" He sounded like he was telling off a child. \"Oh you haven't seen attitude yet\" she warned as she tried to lean away from him. Gale laughed \"that's funny Ali I almost believed it\". Ali sighed \"look! Gale I have no idea why you are here, or even why you would think I would want to see you again after what you pulled\" she said as civilly as she could. Gale looked mad \"what I pulled?\" he demanded \"I only tried to loosen you up. I tried to make you more fun that was all\". Ali stared gobsmacked \"seriously? Are you really serious right now?\" she asked. Gale nodded innocently. \"You drugged my drink!\" she yelled. \"It wasn't to get me to loosen up, or to be more fun. You drugged my drink so that I wouldn't resist you when you tried it on. So I wouldn't fight back as you raped me!\" Clap, clap, and clap. Gale turned around looking puzzled. Ali looked in hope before the feeling crashed when she saw who it was. \"Young man it is a pleasure to meet you\" Mordred came up and clasped Gale on the shoulders. \"I have been unable to acquire Ali for some time. The little pest has always slipped through my fingers and now she is here all wrapped up for me like a present\". \"Dude who the hell are you?\" asked a puzzled Gale. \"Gale, though I really do want you to leave. I am actually saying this to save your life, leave now!\" Gale just looked even more puzzled. Mordred smiled at her then looked back to Gale. \"Yes young man that would be for the best, Ali and I have some things to discuss\" he said. Before Gale could protest Mordred used his magic and cast a forgetting spell. Gale stared blankly and then slowly walked away. 'Well at least I don't have to worry about him anymore' Ali thought with a sigh. \"Now what to do with you my bounded foe?\" said Mordred as he smiled at her. Ali rolled her eyes \"Could you sound less like you were from the past please?\" she mocked. Meanwhile Gale had made it outside and was walking down the street when Marco, Will and Miles came running up. Marco grabbed him demanding to know where Ali was. \"Marco look\" demanded Miles. All three looked at the distant look on Gale's face. \"Someone has done a spell on him he's no use\" he stated. Will stepped forward \"hey man which way did you come from?\" he asked. Gale didn't answer he just turned and pointed to the school gym. All three set off again. They reached the gym and burst through the door to find Ali bound to a chair with her head slumped forward. Mordred was stood behind her with a smirk on his face. \"Your king is dead\" he yelled victoriously before disappearing. Marco fell to the floor, he couldn't breathe. Will was frozen to the spot whilst Miles ran to her. Marco felt a strange chill go through him sucking even more air from him. Miles checked her over looking for any sign of life. There was none he fell down at her feet and cried. None of them could understand they had failed. Will also felt the same chill as Marco did and it shook him up enough to run to Ali crying. Not long after that Miles felt the chill then a vision hit him. After the vision finished he dried his tears and stood up. He grasped his pen and made it into the staff. The head glowed and then Miles closed his eyes. \" Ali?\" he said as he opened his eyes. He found himself in a mist filled room he couldn't see any doors, windows or walls. \" Hello Miles\" came her voice from the mist. Miles searched around for her. She appeared infront of him in a cloud of smoke. \"Ali?\" he asked she smiled sadly and nodded. He rushed to embrace her but he just fell through her. \"I'm sorry Miles\" she said. Miles started crying \"no I'm the one that is sorry Ali. We were too late\". Ali shook her head \"no Miles please don't blame yourself. Make sure Will and Marco don't either ok\". \" How can we not Ali? We knew about the threat we weren't more careful\" Miles wanted to hug her, feel her something to help. \" Miles I'm not dead!\" she said strongly. \"I know right now it looks like I am but I'm not I'm still connected to my body I can feel Will with his head on my legs\". \" There was someone here before it was the lady of the lake or well this time it would be lady of the mist\" she chuckled to herself. \" Mordred thinks he has killed me but all he has done is fulfil a prophecy. He has sent my spirit here. There is something here I have to do and then I will come back.\" Ali sounded so sure of herself. Miles shook his head \"but Ali how long will that be what do we tell your parents and school?\" he asked. Ali looked puzzled before looking around for help. \" You will return to your life within the day\" came the most beautiful voice Miles had ever heard. Ali smiled and turned back round to him \"there you go now go back and stop them from hurting especially Marco\". Ali disappeared infront of him and with one last sigh Miles closed his eyes. He opened them again to find Will exactly where Ali had said he was. Marco was still knelt on the floor clutching his chest. \"Marco, Will listen to me\" he said but neither could hear him. Miles raised his staff and brought it down with a force. A great booming sound was heard in the hall. It caused Marco and Will to look up sharply at Miles. \"She's not dead\" he said. \"Come on man yes she is look at her\" said Will in a broken voice. \"That's just it, I had a vision I think just without the pain it was Ali\" he sounded so excited. \"She is in some kind of limbo the lady of the lake was there. She said that Ali had something to do there and then she would come back to us within the day\". Marco slowly regained his breathing enough to walk over to Miles, even Will stood up as well. \"We will have to take her somewhere safe and then tell her parents she is sleeping at mine and I'll say I am sleeping at hers\" explained Miles. Marco and Will nodded still a little confused. \"We can go to mine mums working the night shift tonight so she will be gone now\" offer Marco. They all nodded and then Marco carefully untied her and lifted her up. They made it look like she was just sleeping on him just in case they were spotted by anyone. They made it back to Marco's without incident and he gently laid her on his bed. \"Now what?\" asked Will? Miles sighed \"now we wait\". What do you think let me know.[Chapter 11] Hey guys thank you all so much for your patience with this story. I know I haven't written anything for a very long time but all I can say is writers block is a bitch lol. Hope u enjoy the chapter and sorry to say this will be the final chapter. Miles, Marco and Will waited anxiously beside Ali's sleeping form. As the night wore on they checked her over and over again and were relieved to find her heart now beating strong. Marco couldn't turn his face away from hers. In his mind he couldn't stop chiding himself for his stupidity. I can't believe I was so stupid She almost died I should have never left her alone I should have been there She was dead I couldn't breathe My life was over My purpose in this world was almost taken from me I won't make that mistake again He repeated over and over again to make it stick. He watched her eyes carefully for any sign of movement any indication that she was waking up. Miles cursed himself for not seeing more in his visions to get to her sooner. Ali was the best friend he had ever had in his life. Will looked on helplessly. Ali had been an important part of his life for some time now. He loved her, not the way Marco did but he still did. He knew Marco would turn back into the big moody bully he had been before she came. It was getting lighter Marco knew his mother would be home soon. Though she wouldn't come in to his room she would pop her head in the door to make sure he was there. Hopefully this time will be different. Hopefully she might be too tired and she might just go straight to bed. Marco snickered to himself 'Yer right, like that's gonna happen' he thought. \"What's up?\" ask Will as he and Miles came up to him. They had heard the snicker and wondered if something was wrong. Marco sighed. \"Nothing\" he said not even taking his eyes away from Ali. Miles put a hand on his shoulder forcing him to look up \"yes there is what's wrong?\" Marco turned to face them \"really it's nothing. I'm just keeping an eye on the time. Mum will be home soon and she has a habit of looking in to check I'm here\". Will nodded his head knowingly. He had heard his father and Marco's mum talking about Marco's behaviour long before we all found out the truth. Miles nodded his understanding and stood up. He took out his pen and twirled it around in his hands thinking. \"Well I could always do a spell\" he said as he turned around to face the two men. Marco nodded as did Will. Miles concentrated and transformed his pen into his staff. From a night so long and filled with stress Go straight to bed and have a good rest Will and Marco stared at Miles with raised eyebrows. \"Yeah, yeah I know but it's the best I could come up with given the time limit and that fact that I haven't slept all night\" he defended. They both nodded and froze as they heard a car door shut. They waited nervously as the front door opened and they heard her climbing the stairs. She paused a moment infront of his door before continuing on to her own room. They all let out a sigh of relief when they heard her door shut. The moment was short lived as Miles doubled over in pain clutching his head. \"Miles! Miles!\" both boys called as they helped him up. \"What did you see?\" Marco asked. Miles looked at the boys sadly \"I saw Mordred. He was surrounded by lots of machines and wires. I think it's the electrical plant. I think he means to shut of the power for the city\". \"What would that do except make everything dark\" asked Will. \"It would cause a panic since they wouldn't be able to get it back on. Some people would start to riot and others would start blaming other people. There will be chaos and pain everywhere\" he explained. \"We have to stop him\" said Will, Marco and Miles agreed. They all looked at Ali. \"She's safe here we'll leave a note in case she wakes up before we get back\" Marco hated the idea of leaving her but he knew they had too. All three ran quietly out the house and raced towards the electrical plant as fast as they could. They made it to the plant quickly and snuck inside. They were surprised with the lack of security. They managed to make it to the main room. Thanks to Miles vision which gave him the layout and the best route to take. When they got to the main room they understood why there was no security. All the security officers and the night time staff where passed out in a huddle in the corner. The boys couldn't see Mordred anywhere so they snuck over to the group to check if they were alive. Miles felt for a plus and smile \"there alive\". Marco nodded and moved around the room searching. \"Well, well, look what we have here\" came a chilling voice from behind them. All three turned around to see Mordred in all his battle armour. He smirked at the trio as he walked closer to them. \"You are nothing without Arthur. Why are you even here? Do you really think you can stop me\" he boasted. \"I killed your king you have no reason to fight anymore. So why even try. Here's an idea boys why not join me. Oh the endless fun we could have making others miserable\". All three laughed \"I'd rather die\" they said in unison. Mordred stopped smirking and snarled \"very well so be it\". He charged at them with his sword raised. The three boys managed to hold their own for a little while. However Mordred was for too strong. One by one they fell with Mordred standing over them in triumph. He looked down and them briefly before walking off towards the main computers. \"You will now see the world in a new way. Oh the time when mayhem and chaos ruled the lands. There is no one now to stop me\" he laughed evilly. He laugh however was cut short. \"I wouldn't bet on that\" he turned and stopped in shock. \"You're dead. I killed you\" he stammered as Ali walked in with her sword in her hands. She smirked at him. \"Sorry to disappoint you\" she slowly edged towards the guys. She quickly scanned them over to check they weren't too badly hurt. When she was satisfied that they weren't she focused back on Mordred who had managed to recover somewhat. \"How is this possible?\" he asked. Ali smirked \"I guess you're not that good of a bad guy as you used to be\" she taunted. \"You didn't kill me instead you sent me to the lady of the lake who gave me a quest. There was something or rather someone I was missing\". Mordred look confused before he noticed a figure walk in towards Ali. When the figure was in the light he looked unassuming. He was just another punk kid that dressed like a punk. Mordred started laughing. \"Who is this that was so important\" he sneered \"this one looks just as pathetic as the rest of your silly band of knights\". Ali smiled \"well Arthur needed his knights then and the same for me now. Mordred met Garth. You would actually know him as Sir Galahad\". Mordred laughed again. Garth stepped forward in a protective stance infront of Ali and sneered. Mordred rushed him like the others but Garth was better prepared for him. Whilst they fought Ali rushed to Miles, Marco's and Will's side. \"Are you guys ok?\" she asked concerned. Will and Miles smiled and nodded \"it's good to see you awake\" Miles said whilst hugging his best friend. Marco waited until she looked at him and leaned forward to kiss her. \"Don't ever do that again\" he said as he pulled away. Ali smiled at him before touching her forehead to his. They were interrupted by a cough. Ali and Marco looked up to see that Will and Miles had helped Garth subdue Mordred. Marco didn't miss the look Garth gave him before turning to Ali. \"He is captured your highness. What would you like me to do with him?\" he asked whilst bowing. Ali groaned whilst the other three laughed. Garth looked confused \"Did I miss something\". \"She doesn't like being called your highness or your majesty or my lady or anything else\" explained Miles. \"She also hates it when you bow especially if you do it in public. You're not even allowed to just bend your head at her\" followed Will. Ali glared at them whilst getting up holding Marco's hand. \"The name is Ali ok these two are annoying but right. I don't like being treat differently I only just got Marco to stop doing that so I don't need you to do that too ok\" she asked. Garth nodded slowly. \"As for Mordred tie him up good I think I can hear the police coming we made sure to trip an alarm\". Garth again nodded and did as she asked. They made it out before the police saw them. They headed back to Marco's. Will took Miles and Garth to sleep in his room whilst Marco took Ali to his. Again Marco did miss the look Garth gave them when this was suggested. He ignored it until they were alone. \"What's up with that Garth guy\" he asked. Ali looked at him confusedly. \"He keeps giving me strange looks especially after I kissed you at the electrical plant and then when we came up here\". Ali shrugged her shoulders and looked away Marco wasn't having any of it. \"What is it Ali? Tell me please\" he asked whilst kneeling infront of her as she sat on the bed. \"Well when I was searching for him they lady of the lake did mention that he was destined to fight by my side. He is also supposed to be the one meant for me to keep me on my righteous path\" she couldn't look at him. Marco didn't know what to say. He stood up and took a step back before turning away. It killed him to think of Ali with another guy but if that's what she needed to help her then he would do it. He wouldn't leave her. He would still protect her. He just wouldn't be able to watch them be happy. \"After she said that I told her about you, she didn't say anything after that. I told her that I didn't care what the fates centuries ago decided would be a good match for me. They don't know me at all and they don't know you otherwise they definitely wouldn't say he was better for me\". She sounded so sure he wished he could believe her. Ali stepped up to him and wrapped her arms around his waist. \"Marco, please look at me\" she asked. He slowly turned around he would always obey her commands. She smiled slowly \"the fates are wrong. I spent a little time in that mist travelling back with him. He is a lot like my ex Gale. There is no way in hell I would ever date him. He said because he has always known about me and that he would be with me one day he hasn't had any serious girl's just flings. I wanted to slap him\". Marco searched her eyes for any sign of a lie. She touched his cheek \"I want you Marco I couldn't do any of this without you\". Marco slowly smiled and nodded before leaning his head down and capturing her lips with his own. Ali sighed into the kiss. Marco lifted his head back \"did you tell him about me\" he asked she nodded. \"What did he say to that?\" he asked again whilst kissing her neck. Ali chuckled \"he said that it didn't matter if I was with you now I would be his when we got to where we were going. I actually swung for him he only just managed to dodge it\". Marco laughed at that. Later on that day the group was sat outside in Marco's and Will's garden. Ali and Marco were sat close together holding hands whilst Garth, Miles and Will sat across from them. Marco didn't miss the looks Garth gave him. Ali excused herself from the table to go to the bathroom. Whilst Will and Miles went to get more drinks which left Marco and Garth alone. \"You do know she is destined to be with me now\" asked Garth. Marco nodded at him. \"So what's the point in continuing with whatever it is you are doing? I can guarantee you that this thing between you isn't serious. I bet she hasn't even given it up yet to you has she?\" Garth smirked as Marco glared that seemed to confirm it for him. \"There is a reason for that Marco. I am destined to be her first and only. The sooner you realise that they better it will be for everyone\" Garth sounded so sure of himself. Marco was about to retaliate when Ali sat down glaring at Garth. \"Actually Garth not that it's any of your business but Marco and I have already slept together. I don't care what the fates ages ago thought but you are so not a good match for me I wanted to kill you when I was bringing you back here. Marco is the one for me I love him and there is nothing you can do or say that will change my mind. If you're going to act like this then you can go back to where ever you came from\". Garth looked shocked before storming of in a sulk he stopped just before he went inside \"I won't leave me king defenceless\". Ali nodded and then he went inside. Ali turned to Marco who was smiling. \"What\" she asked. He leant forward and kissed her lightly. \"I love you too\" he said. Ali gasped before the hugest smile appeared on her face. They crushed their lips together. They both sighed into the kiss finally happy and safe to be with each other. They couldn't predict what would happen in the future but they knew as long as they were with each other nothing to get in there way.

I didn't think it was that good. Sorry for anyone who found it good, but don't worry because the new version is going to be better. In the meantime, here is my Son of Batman story. DISCLAIMER: I DON'T OWN ANY DC CONTENT. The Twins Far beyond the mountains, covered by the mist, hidden by all except those who knew of it was a headquarters. This was no ordinary headquarters, for this was the headquarters of the League of Assassins. Others called them, the League of Shadows. Whichever you prefer, they all represent the same thing. They have only one duty, to rid the world of evil and corruption. Though their motives are noble, their methods are far from what any good person would do. Some, like Batman, would not stoop low to the life of a killer. It was what makes the good people different from the bad. But the League would not let anything stand in their way to complete their task, anything. Batman, or his true identity Bruce Wayne, had been chosen by Ra's Al Ghul to become a successor to lead the League. He declined for he made a code to never take a life. But Talia, Ra's daughter, had fallen in love with him. One night, they both did something that would create not one, but two who would be their legacy. Whether it would be the legacy of the League of Shadows or legacy of the Batman, would be up to them. This is the story of the twin sons of Talia Al Ghul and the Batman, the grandsons of Ra's Al Ghul, Damien and Adrian Wayne. Four individuals view upon the soldiers of the League of Shadows as they train their arts in combat and sword fighting. One was old but strong, and was wearing a black armor with golden markings, along with a green cape. This was Ra's Al Ghul. One was a woman wearing tight fitting combat attire, exposing her curves. This was Talia Al Ghul. The two young short ones, who were still in their pre-teens, were wearing identical outfits, but were smaller in size and had red capes. They were so identical in appearance, both having black hair of the same style, along with the same face, that you wouldn't be able to tell the difference of their identity, unless if you look at their eyes. One had sky-blue eyes, while the other had jade colored eyes. The one with the blue eyes was Adrian, while the one with the green eyes was Damian. They were both identical twins, sons of Talia Al Ghul. They were considered to be bastards among few as the identity of their father was never told. Only two people knew of his identity, other than the boys themselves. One was of course, their mother Talia, the other, their grandfather, Ra's. When it comes to their father, they were both curious of anything related to him. Always listening intently to their grandfather and mother's stories of him, never missing any detail. They would sometimes be unsatisfied with the information and would often wander to places in the temple to search for any additional information, places they weren't allowed in, or find things they weren't supposed to. Talia had always complimented them for this, saying that they had the makings of their father's detective skills. While Damien slowly became bored with the topic, Adrian grew more curious. Talia had told him of the tragedy that had ultimately been the catalyst for his father to become what he was now, the Batman. Adrian became curious as to why his father didn't come visit them at times, though he had a suspicion. He didn't know about them. Adrian was saddened but decided, it was a price to pay. But he had hoped that someday, both he and his brother will meet their father. \"Here is your legacy Damien, Adrian,\" Ra's said as they overlooked the League headquarters. Damian and Adrian took one step forward to look at the view more closely, \"Here is your inheritance, The League of Assassins,\" Damian and Adrian turned to their grandfather, \"Yes, grandfather,\" they both said with pride as they turn back to the training happening below them. Ra's glanced at his grandchildren with a proud gleam in his eyes, \"They will be yours to command, to make certain the earth abides a natural contentment, without the abuse of man,\" Ra's said with pride. Talia watched their interaction as her brother, who was wearing a cream colored armor with white markings along with a white cape, his face wrinkled at his age, \"It is good to see our revered father so devoted to his grandsons,\" He said as Talia turned to him with a smile, \"Yes brother, it is,\" Talia said as her brother turned to the twins. As Adrian stood to Ra's right, Damien suddenly had an uneasy feeling. It was a sense that both twins had. If one of them was in danger, somehow the other could sense it. Damien whipped to his brother, \"Adrian,\" He called as Adrian suddenly, startling his brother. His uncle, sensing the danger, immediately ran to his nephew as he protected him from an incoming bullet. It went to his back, \"Uncle,\" Adrian exclaimed as his uncle fell to the ground, motionless. He was dead in an instant. Adrian immediately scanned the area. He glanced at a small hole where he could see an eye peeking through, \"Over there,\" He said to his mother and grandfather. Ra's saw the eye in the hole. He immediately turned to Talia, \"We have been breached, they are already inside, take the boys,\" Ra's ordered his daughter as he unsheathed his sword. The wall fell as they could see men wearing black ninja outfits with an orange symbol on their right shoulder, carrying firearms. Talia immediately grabbed both of her sons, jumping at the balcony and slides on the rooftop below them. They landed with no injuries as they looked up towards Ra's position. Adrian and Damian heard a distant buzzing of a helicopter as they turned to the front, seeing helicopters open firing at the League members. Bullets rained upon them, killing many in their path as they fired missiles. Talia grabbed her sons to cover as they saw more helicopters heading their way for an attack, also dropping ground troops. \"Adrian, Damien, stay here,\" Talia ordered them, \"Yes, mother,\" Adrian replied with a nod. Talia ran to the battlefield. Damian turned to his brother with a blank face, \"You're gonna fight, aren't you?\" Adrian turned to his brother as he pulled out two guns and two katanas, \"Were you going to do nothing?\" Adrian replied. Damien gave a smirk as he took the blade and the gun, \"Fair point,\" Damien replied. They both looked towards the battlefield, turning to each other and nodded as they both charged. They shot down many enemies, occasionally attacking with their swords. Then they turned and saw a large explosion at the main building, where their grandfather had been, \"Adrian,\" Damien called as he ran to the building, \"I know,\" Adrian replied as they both ran to the center courtyard. They could see the burned figure of their grandfather lay on the ground. Then an old man wearing a black and orange colored armor dropped down near him. 'Deathstroke,' both boys thought in hatred. Slade slammed his foot at the burned form of Ra's, \"After five hundred years the world's had quite enough of you, old man. The Lazarus pit will not bring you back this time,\" Slade said as he put his sword in a reverse grip, holding it above his head to stab Ra's. Adrian and Damien immediately ran towards him with a battle cry as they leaped forward and kicked Slade away from their grandfather. Slade recovered from the attack as he looked at the boys, one of them was kneeling beside Ra's, the other holding a sword with an angry glare. 'If looks could kill,' Slade thought, now realizing they were Talia's bastard children. But when he looked at Adrian's glare, he couldn't help but noticed the look on the boy's face, almost familiar. \"Grandfather,\" Damian whimpered as Adrian held down his sadness, glaring hatred at the man in front of him, \"Damian, we attack together,\" He growled to his twin as he stood, sword flashing in his hand, \"I was just about to say the same thing,\" Damien growled back. Slade, holding two swords, charged. Both brothers blocked his attack, pushing each sword back as Slade swung his swords downwards, towards Damien. Damien dodged as Adrian took the opportunity to attack, but Slade swung his sword faster before he could reach him. He leaped sideways, barely dodging the attack as Slade swung again at his brother. Damien dodged, managing to get behind Slade, sliding backwards. Then he leaped to Slade, before barely managing to block Slade's counter. The attack was too much for him to block as he was thrown across the courtyard, slamming to the wall. \"Damien!\" Adrian yelled as he turned to Slade. He ran and swung viciously at him, before his attacks were countered. Adrian blocked the attack but, like Damien, he too, was thrown across the courtyard. Damien saw his brother get thrown, immediately catching him as they both fell to the ground with a grunt, \"Thank you, brother,\" Adrian said to his twin, who nodded. They glared at Slade as he spoke, \"So you're Talia's little bastards, not bad for a pair of children. But now, we end it,\" Slade said as he charged, both his swords held ready. Both boys glanced at each other, having the same idea as they dodged his attack and went separately. Then they ran to a couple of the pillars supporting the wooden floor above, cutting them, before moving out of the way. Slade looked upwards as the wooden floor fell on top of him. He emerged from the wooden rubble, moving towards the boys, but screamed in pain as Damien stabbed his left eye. Damien pulled his sword back as it glistened with blood, \"Now your heart,\" Adrian said as he emerged from behind Damien. His attack was blocked as Slade threw out a few tiny smoke bombs. Black smoke surrounded the twins, blocking their vision. They blocked their mouth and nose, preventing the smoke from entering their lungs as they heard Slade's voice above them, \"I'll make you pay for this, boys,\" They looked up and saw Slade holding a rope being pulled upwards to a helicopter. They narrowed their eyes as they saw a large muscular chocolate skinned man, with many scars, wearing a black tank top and green combat pants, smirking at them. \"Ubu,\" Both boys muttered at the same time as the smoke cleared around them. As Slade went inside the helicopter, it flew away. Damien and Adrian ran back to the battlefield as all the helicopters and Deathstroke's men ceased their attack. Damien raised his sword, \"COME BACK AND FIGHT YOU COWARDS!\" He yelled as the helicopters dropped ropes. Deathstroke's men immediately retreated, throwing smoke bombs as they grabbed the roped and pulled tow the helicopters. Both brothers glared at the retreating helicopters, before remembering something, \"Grandfather,\" Adrian muttered as he ran back to the courtyard, followed by Damien. \"GRANDFATHER!\" Damien yelled as he and Adrian stopped at the courtyard, noticing their grandfather missing. Adrian then saw an entrance with green light coming from inside, \"Lazarus pit,\" Adrian muttered as he ran to the room. Damien heard his brother and followed him. Talia called her sons as they went down to a set of stairs, heading to the Lazarus pit. They both stopped as their mother ran and stopped beside them, looking at the pit . . . or rather, the body close to it. Adrian dropped his sword as he ran towards his grandfather's unmoving form. He struggled to carry him, \"Come on, we need to get him to the Lazarus pit,\" Adrian said with a struggle as his mother went in front of him, Damien putting his hand on his brother's shoulder, \"Stop,\" Talia said as Damien looked at his brother in sadness and grief. Adrian looked pleadingly at his mother, \"We have to try, we can't just leave him-\" Damien cut his brother with a sad tone in his voice, \"He's dead,\" Adrian turned to his brother with his face trembling as he turned his grandfather's form. \"The pit can restore a body this damaged. He's beyond healing,\" Talia said to her son. Adrian slowly put Ra's body to the ground as he knelt. \"We did our best, brother,\" Damien said to his brother. Talia walked away as Adrian closed his eyes, \"We failed,\" Talia stopped and turned around, \"We can't think about that now, we have to move, come,\" She sternly said. Damien walked to his mother but noticed his brother was still kneeling beside their grandfather, \"Adrian, now,\" Talia ordered as she grabbed her son's arm and pulled him with her, Damien followed. \"Where are we going?\" Damien asked her, still walking. Their mother replied, \"Gotham City,\" Both boys widened their eyes; Adrian couldn't help but thought 'Could it be?' His thoughts prove to be true as his mother added. \"It's time to meet your father,\" A/N: Well … what do you think of the first chapter?[Chapter 2] A/N: I'm back. I'm working on another story, Hotel Transylvania. Check it out in my profile. Anyways, here is the second chapter. DISCLAIMER: I DON'T OWN ANY DC CONTENT. Father meets Sons The trip there was . . . restless to say the least, for Adrian. Despite his grief for his grandfather, he and Damien were going to see their father, for the first time in their life. Nervousness immediately came after they went onboard the ship, fancy ship. Both twins weren't surprised by this fact. The League had a large funding, which was the understatement of the year. Their father was even more so. They couldn't even imagine what sort of wealth he had, at least the total amount of it. The fact that it would one be theirs was . . . actually not so pressuring as Adrian thought. Well, both he and his brother have had quite a lot of time learning. They were both intelligent beyond that of normal kids. They were only physically children, inside they were very mature. Although, both brothers were prepared for a few . . . phases. It was a good thing their mother had given them 'The Talk' already. The awkward part was she blatantly described how her and their father . . . made them. They had both looked as if unfazed by the fact, although both brothers were actually resisting the urge to just make her stop, but they respected the, uh, knowledge they had gotten. They had to learn it at some point. Adrian and Damien were hiding behind a curtain, waiting for their mother to reveal them to their father. Damien wasn't exactly thrilled that they had to be 'babysit' by their father. On the other hand, he was actually quite curious of his father as well, just not as Adrian was. Speaking of which, Adrian was actually taking deep breaths. He had to be strong, show no sign of weakness. \"Not you.\" Talia stated. It was time for the reveal, \"Me,\" Talia continued as she pulled the purple curtain, revealing both boys standing there confidently, \"And your sons.\" They walked to the light, revealing them completely. Damien had his hands on his hip, Adrian had his arms crossed, \"Sons?\" Batman said, sounding not so much shocked by the fact. When in fact, he was. \"I assure you they're yours, beloved.\" Batman didn't even know why Talia needed to say that. He could pretty much see the resemblance, they both looked like him. Only difference is that one had Talia's jade eyes, while the other had his. They couldn't have been more than ten years old, though judging by the looks in their eyes. Batman knew they were no children. And the League of Shadows uniform they were wearing wasn't there for show either. They both walked towards him. They stopped as the one with the jade eyes examined him and spoke, \"Don't look so stunned, father. I thought you'd be taller.\" He said with a raised eyebrow. While Damien had a look of unimpressed, Adrian was mentally in awe at his father. The stories weren't even close to what he was experiencing now. His father had an aura of strength and intelligence. Definitely someone you don't want to be on his bad side. Though he had a feeling Damien would ignore this. Father and sons stood in the docks, watching the ship Talia was in moving away. \"You didn't know about us.\" Adrian said. Batman immediately replied, \"No.\" Damien looked up to him from the corner of his eyes, \"So mother has made us your responsibility.\" He said as both he and Adrian turned to their father. Batman looked to them, \"Something like that.\" He replied. Damien immediately spoke, \"This isn't necessary, we'll do fine by ourselves.\" Batman turned to them, \"So do I, but things have changed. She thinks you both will be better off with me, for now.\" He said. Batman took a moment to reply, \"Better than with the League of Assassins.\" Adrian couldn't help but be a little offended. They had grown up with them after all, \"They thought us how to fight.\" Adrian replied. Batman looked to them with a raised eyebrow, \"And I take it, not much else.\" Adrian opened his mouth to argue, but decided against. Yes, his father was right. Well, when you're the grandson of the leader, you were practically trained after you learn to walk, \"No.\" Adrian replied, looking away. Batman turned to the Batmobile, which had been parked near the docks. He pressed a button on his belt as it opened. Both brothers turned to it, \"I'll drive.\" Damien said. \"No.\" Batman immediately replied, \"I know how.\" Damien said, \"No.\" Batman said more sternly, \"Someday, perhaps?\" Adrian couldn't help but asked. He had always been interested in his father's 'toys' as Talia had put it in her stories. No, the gadgets of course. What were you thinking about? Batman couldn't help but noticed the hopeful tone. It seemed this was the more, child-ish twin. The nostalgia came as he once had that same hopeful look on his son's face. Back then, when he had been their age. He internally smiled, \"Maybe.\" That was the most Adrian was going to get. It did give him hope though. They both took their sacks, containing some items they had from the League, and ran to the car. They sat in opposite side of their father. Batman went inside and pressed a 'call' on the screen of the Batmobile, showing his butler's face, Alfred Pennyworth. While Damien thought him to be a servant, Adrian was told that he was a friend of the family. He had been there for their father when their grandparents had been murdered, \"Alfred.\" Batman said. They heard a voice, clearly elderly, \"Yes, sir?\" \"We're going to have company.\" Batman stated, strangely with a bit of an excited tone. It was so distinct that Adrian was sure he was imagining it. \"A sleepover? Oh goodie.\" Alfred's voice stated in a tired tone, \"For my sons.\" It all went silent for a few moments, until Alfred replied, \"Pardon me, sir, I seem to have mistaken. I thought you said your 'sons'?\" \"I did.\" Batman replied. They drove off through the night of Gotham City. Both brothers looked around the tall buildings. They certainly gave off a dark theme, even with all the lights, the gargoyles only adding the effect. They saw Wayne Tower, their future legacy. Well, they weren't going to be separate of course. Adrian and Damien prefer to work together. So if they were going to inherit the multi-billion dollar company, they were going to do it together. Throughout the journey, Adrian couldn't but be curious of what his father thought of them. He didn't know about them, after all they've only just met. Though unlike his brother, he was actually hoping to learn some things from his father. He wouldn't become Robin of course. His brother could take up that role, if he wanted too. He had another thing in mind, something similar. He didn't know if his father would approve, but he figured he should let them try at least. If they took up the roles, of course, which Adrian was considering and unknowingly to him, his brother as well. There wasn't exactly any changing to the name for Adrian's, only adding one word. And it held an entirely different meaning. Red Robin. A/N: Sorry if it's shorter.[Chapter 3] A/N: LADIES AND GENTLEMAN! Sorry for the slow update. I'm currently testing my limits on working on 2 stories, the other is Hotel Transylvania. Just to make things clear, updates will not be consistent. Whenever I can. DISCLAIMER: I DON'T OWN ANY DC CONTENT. New Home The Batmobile drove through the night, towards the secluded regions of the forest near Gotham. Both brothers could see the Wayne Manor in the far off distance. They were both wondering why the place was located so far away from Gotham. Though judging from what they already knew about Gotham City, it wasn't exactly surprising. It was quite brilliant, considering it was located near a cliff and out to the open sea. It gave a tactical advantage should any trespassers came around. 'Though to be quite honest, who would be bold enough to trespassed Wayne Manor?' Both boys thought, not knowing that would actually happen in the future. The boys couldn't help but noticed another thing, the road leading downwards on the edge of the cliff-side. No doubt towards the infamous Batcave. The Batmobile drove through the cave entrance towards a long bridge, stopping at a circle in the centre in front of a large multiple-screen computer. Waiting for them was a man wearing butler attire. The Batmobile stopped, the circular floor rotating the vehicle, facing towards the entrance of the cave. Damien and Adrian jumped out of the vehicle as it opened, \"Welcome back, sir. I presume these are the young men of whom you spoke.\" Alfred said. \"Hello, Pennyworth.\" \"Hello, Mr. Pennyworth.\" Damien gave his brother a raised eyebrow. He couldn't blame him really. Out of the two of them, Adrian was the more 'soft' one, if you could call it that. But Damien couldn't care less about that fact, considering they both had flaws. It was how they both work, opposite twins. Alone they were still very deadly, but they were more effective working together. Where one of them would fail, the other would succeed. It was a dangerous combination for them to have. Alfred could see the difference of the two already. He would try his best to tolerate Damien, as he would probably be the more stubborn twin out of the two. He had a feeling he wouldn't have to do that with Adrian. They both shared their father's trait. The stubbornness was definitely there, though Adrian had less than Damien. Damien turned to the butler, \"We've heard of you.\" He said. Alfred bowed, \"At your service, Master Damien, Master Adrian.\" He replied. Damien looked around, as if looking for anyone else. Adrian was also confused, \"Where are the rest?\" He asked to the butler. Alfred could tell they hadn't expected their father to have just one butler for the entire manor. \"I am the sum total.\" Alfred replied. Damien turned to their father, \"You have only one servant?\" Damien asked in his incredulous tone, as if it was hard to believe. Adrian had to wonder, how one butler could be enough for the entire manor. They must have hired some people to do specific chores. Though Adrian assumed they just come and go. Alfred pretty much handled most of it. 'Well, considering father's other alias, I guess that would make sense.' Adrian thought. Batman looked to them, \"He's not a servant,\" He replied sternly, \"He's a friend.\" Both boys stared at their father for a few moments, \"Hm.\" Damien said. Adrian then turned around, walking towards, what he assumed, was the Batcomputer. Damien followed him, scanning around the cave, \"So this is the fabled Batcave. Grandfather told us all about it.\" Damien said. Adrian sat at the seat in front of the large computer, rotating the chair facing them, \"Smaller than we imagined,\" Damien said, \"Very efficient though.\" Adrian finished. Batman and Alfred looked to the two, as they walked up the stairs, hands behind their backs, scanning the large cave. Alfred turned to Batman, \"They are the spitting image of you at that age,\" He said, as he crossed his arm, \"It's a bit chilling.\" \"Tell me about it,\" Batman replied, \"Look, you're gonna have to get them settled. I'm not sure how long they'll be here but,\" He said, looking at where the boys were, \"For the time being, this will be their home.\" He said to Alfred. The boys looked at a red and green colored suit, with a green domino mask, and a yellow cape inside a glassed barrier. The original Robin suit, \"It looks rather effeminate, don't you think?\" Damien said to the two adults below. Adrian couldn't help but agree. Alfred replied, as he walked up the stairs towards them, \"Master Dick was boy when he wore that.\" Both knew who Dick Grayson was. They couldn't help but wonder, \"Where is he now?\" Adrian asked. \"Moved on, and so shall we.\" Alfred replied as he led the two boys, \"Would you both like to see where you will be sleeping?\" Batman watched them walked away. He would have to get used to this, having children. He hadn't known about them, and now they were suddenly his responsibility. He wasn't complaining though. In fact deep, deep, deep down, he actually wished Talia had told him about them. At least he would've had time to prepare for this sort of occasions, having to take care of their children. Though with the League of Assassins, he knew they weren't children. They were mature enough to be adults, although he could see some bits of children in them. He could tell by the way they looked at the old suit, that they wanted to become the new Robin. Although Adrian had something else in mind, not entirely different. He didn't really know if they were ready for that. Damien and Adrian walked behind Alfred as he led them to their room. They both occasionally glanced at the manor. They saw their grandparent's picture with their father as a child. Adrian couldn't help but be amused at how similar they were to him. Like father like son, or in this case, sons. On the way, Adrian couldn't help but noticed two katana swords, sheathed and hanged crossed in the wall. He immediately walked to the swords. Damien looked to his brother with curiosity, until he saw the swords. He followed Adrian, stopping beside him. Both swords looked to be very well-crafted. Alfred saw the boys looking at the swords with interest, \"They belonged to your great-grandfather.\" He said to them. Adrian turned to him, \"You both could use them, if you'd like?\" Alfred said as he looked at the hidden glee in both their eyes. Damien gave the sword one last look, before turning to his brother, \"Let us continue, brother. We will use them tomorrow.\" Adrian looked to his brother and nodded. They followed Alfred, \"I presume you will be sharing a room?\" Both brothers looked to the butler, \"Yes, we prefer it that way.\" Damien replied. Alfred nodded, approaching a double door, \"Then I hope this isn't too cramped for the both of you?\" He said, opening the door and revealing a rather large bedroom. It had two large beds, a few pictures hanging on the wall, a few drawers, a large closet, two separate doors, and a large television. \"That door leads to your bath,\" Alfred said towards the door to their left, \"The other to a game room,\" He said towards the door to their right, \"And you also have this for your amusement.\" He continued, picking a television remote. He turned on the television, showing an old Looney Toons cartoon. Well, they didn't exactly like this sort of childish things. \"Naturally you have the run of the mansion?\" The twins turned to him, \"Of course,\" Damien replied, \"We know that.\" After they finished examining the room, Damien turned to Alfred, \"Prepare some tea, Pennyworth,\" Damien said, \"Brown sugar instead off white,\" Adrian continued, \"Fresh cup lemon,\" Damien continued, \"China cups.\" Adrian finished. Alfred looked to them left and right, internally smiling. They were more twins than he realised, finishing each other's sentences. It was quite amusing, \"Perhaps the young masters would like some warm mixed nuts, and a moist hand towel?\" They couldn't help but noticed the slight sarcastic tone in Alfred's voice, as they sat at couch near the door, \"Watch yourself, Pennyworth.\" Damien said, \"We're not so young that we don't understand sarcasm.\" Alfred replied with a slight tired tone, \"Well I am much too old to care.\" He then turned off the television, walking out of the room. \"Alfred?\" He stopped and turned around, noticing Adrian standing behind him, \"Yes, Master Adrian?\" The boy gave him a barely distinct hopeful smile, which the butler noticed, \"Could you also bring chocolate?\" Alfred smiled at the boy. He was definitely going to enjoy having them both around. They both had their father's persona, which gave him a bit of nostalgia. He wondered if they would also take the mantle Robin, although Master Bruce did told him that Adrian had something else in mind, \"Of course, Master Adrian.\" Adrian nodded, before returning to his room. The next day, Bruce walked to the kitchen, \"I've gotta get down to the office,\" He said, picking up a toast, \"How are the boys?\" He said, as he took a bite. Alfred was watching outside the window, in the garden, \"See for yourself.\" He said gesturing to the garden. Bruce walked to the window and saw his sons holding katanas, chopping down bushes of different shapes, \"They've been at it since five o'clock this morning. I hope you don't mind, sir. The swords are your grandfather's, the ones on the wall pluck.\" Alfred explained. The boys then ran to the window, running on it, before doing a back-flip and chopped another bush. Bruce noticed the perfect synchronization of their movements. They were both very skilled. He watched as they landed, putting their swords in a reverse grip, before stabbing the bush behind them at the same time. They watched as the twins jumped to a deer-carved bush, before jumping to a circular bush. They jumped to a giraffe-carved bush's back, cutting the head. They landed side by side, before cutting down the legs of the giraffe. Bruce watched them with a blank look, \"I think we might be able to skip the gardener this month.\" Alfred said. Bruce looked to him, \"Well they were trained by the League of Assassins.\" He replied as a matter of fact. Alfred watched the boys with a tired look, \"I myself, am rooting for the shrubbery.\" He replied. Bruce raised an eyebrow as he watched his sons swung their blades at the deer, before they sheathed their swords. A few short moments later, the bush was cut to pieces. Bruce couldn't help but smile, \"They have talent.\" He said with a hint of pride in his tone.[Chapter 4] A/N: Guys, fair warning. I'm quite good at English, despite it not being my birth-language, but it's not THAT perfect. I apologize if there are any mistakes in grammar or anything of the sort. Also, sorry if this chapter is shorter. DISCLAIMER: I DON'T OWN ANY DC CONTENT. Family Inheritance After their morning 'exercise', the twins took a bath and wore matching set of clothes. Tight black turtle neck shirt with tight black pants and black shoes to match. Damien turned to his brother, \"Do you have it?\" He asked. Adrian nodded, then for a moment, \"We should also visit father's company, to tell him of our discovery.\" Damien raised an eyebrow, before smirking, \"You just want to look at our father's company, don't you?\" Adrian gave his brother an innocent look, \"It will be ours someday. Don't tell you're not curious yourself?\" He replied. Damien could agree. There was no way one of them would be in charge of the company. They work better together. They also wondered, since their father had only known them just last night. Imagine what the company's reaction might be. 'Quite amusing.' They both thought. How they managed to infiltrate the company without anyone noticing was beyond the twins. They didn't even need to try so hard, not even a sweat. In truth, they had expected better security, with their father as the Batman after all. They weren't expecting this lack of safety for such a large company. The boys were already having ideas on how to improve it. 'Embarrassing, even a bird's nest has better security.' Damien thought with a slight embarrassment. They went inside the main office, careful but skilfully hacking the computer. They went through the files for useful information. They were going to inherit the company. They might as well gather information on the inner workings of it. Suddenly, they managed to find a rather interesting discovery. They heard multiple voices over the door. They recognized their father's voice instantly, as the door opened, revealing Bruce along with other departments' employee, \"What the hell?\" One of them said. They ignored his comment, Damien, who was sitting beside Adrian, revealing a monitor. It showed margin schematics of the profits of Wayne Company on Argentina, \"Your profit margin is down in Argentina,\" Damien said, smirking as he looked at the monitor, before turning to them, \"Someone is scheming revenue, father.\" Adrian finished with an equal mischievous smirk. \"Argentina? That's my division, Bruce!?\" \"Did he just say 'father'?\" \"Bruce, you have kids?\" Bruce turned around, not bothering to answer the question, \"It's okay, it's alright. I'll deal with this.\" He said with a final tone, as he closed the door. He walked over towards the twins, \"What are you two doing?\" He asked. \"Reviewing our birthright,\" Damien replied, \"This will be ours someday.\" Bruce frowned, as he turned the monitor back, before demanding, \"How did you two get in here?\" Adrian gave his father a small hint of a sheepish look, \"No offence, father, but a bird's nest has better security.\" 'Just what I was thinking.' Damien added silently. Then both of their expression turned more serious, as they stood and faced the window, showing a beautiful view of the city, \"We need to talk.\" Damien said. The brothers surveyed at the city, before Adrian continued, \"Deathstroke has a contact stationed here.\" Bruce walked to them, \"In Gotham?\" He asked, walking over to his sons. Both brothers looked to their father, \"We find him,\" Damien started, \"We find Deathstroke.\" Adrian finished. \"We can take Deathstroke out,\" Damien continued before both of them simultaneously said with a dark tone, \"Permanently.\" Bruce looked at his sons and replied with a stern tone, \"We don't kill.\" The twins grew frustrated. Adrian might have been more reasonable, but he was still trained by the League of Assassins. They taught him, and his brother, to take a life. They had already done so during Deathstroke's attack, \"We were taught you destroy your enemy.\" Damien replied instantly. \"That makes you like them.\" Bruce said. \"It makes us better than them,\" Adrian said in their defence, \"Deathstroke killed our grandfather! He has to pay!\" \"Ra's was a madman.\" Bruce told them. \"He was a hero,\" Damien replied, \"He died a hero.\" He finished. Then Adrian pulled a device out of his pocket, pressing a button, showing a holographic image of a large figure along with information of his profile, \"Ubu's Deathstroke's right hand man. He used to work for our grandfather, he stays in Gotham City between missions to indulge his…\" Adrian temporarily closed his eyes, before his brother continued, \"…vices, according to mother.\" Bruce noted the slight showing of disgust on their faces, \"We looked up the rest.\" Damien finished. Bruce noticed the data they had on Ubu, recognizing it instantly, \"This is classified mater- you downloaded this from the computer in the Batcave, didn't you?\" Bruce asked. \"We hacked an inorad when we were six, individually. It was easy.\" Damien replied. Bruce gave his sons a glare. Adrian quietly sighed as he and his brother waited beside their father for Alfred to take them home. The butler pulled up the car, and then Bruce opened the door. They both went inside the car, \"Alfred is to take both of you directly home, no stops. Both of you will not go off on your own for any reason, you will stay away from the Batcave computer, and you will stay out of sight, do you understand?\" Bruce said with warning. Damien crossed his arm, simply replying, \"We owe our grandfather a death.\" He said. Adrian closed the door of the car. As Alfred drove the car through the city, Adrian could see a look on his brother's face, as he looked at him. Adrian nodded, as Damien gave a smile. He could always count on his brother. \"Great-grandfather's swords will be very useful.\" Damien nodded in agreement. They had decided to keep the swords, as they were technically theirs. Tonight, they will make their move. Unknowingly, they will also meet their, big 'brother'.[Chapter 5] SORRY FOR THIS LOOOOOOOOOONG UPDATE! School has been so time-consuming, and it's going to get worse soon. So just a heads up, I might not update that much. Idk when this is going to end. By the way, like I said before… or if I hadn't, then I'm telling you all now. I have a strange thing where if I watch something that I really like, I have an urge to just write a fanfic about it. It depends on my mood, you know what I mean? So if I suddenly add another story, that doesn't mean I'm going to abandon a story. So don't worry about that. DISCLAIMER: I DON'T OWN ANY DC CONTENT. Meeting 'Big Brother' While their father went to Arkham Asylum to interrogate Killer Croc, one of their father's infamous enemies, the twins prepared themselves for their 'appointment' with Ubu. Adrian wasn't going to kill the man, at least not until he talks, so he was a bit worried of what his brother would do. Damien preferred the more brash actions, which Adrian didn't mind at all. Though he'd make sure Ubu would still be able to at least say some information, before ultimately killing him. After all, that was the whole point of finding him. \"Make sure he's not too injured. We need him to talk first.\" Adrian requested to his twin. Damien internally sighed. He knew his brother was worried he would go too far. Of course he understood why. That was exactly why he could always rely on Adrian. Every time Damien would go overboard, Adrian would be there to stop him. They were both sides of the yin and yang, or the same coin… whatever the impression was. They both couldn't honestly know what would happen if they went separate. Odds are they would probably do something stupid. They might be skilled, even individually, but even they had weaknesses. They put on their League ninja uniforms, sheathing their new swords and pulling their hoods. As they prepared to leave the mansion, Adrian left a note for Alfred. It was more of a blueprint than note as of matter of fact, for their new suit. It didn't require much. Both he and Damien had already decided to mix the suits with their League of Shadows outfit. After measuring them, they found out that it was at least much more practical than the original. Damien also added a few things for Adrian's suit, which he was grateful for. As they set out to confront Ubu, both of them couldn't shake the feeling that they were going to have another 'family' reunion. In a, somewhat, friendly way. Ubu was not an intelligent individual, they both summarized. The large man had only brawns. He may have been able to detect them, but his guest wasn't even close. How could he had been Deathstroke's right hand man, they would never know? Other than the brawns, he could be a strategist for his militia, though they didn't know if that was true. Damien leapt first, his brother moments after him. Damien broke the balcony window as Adrian unsheathed his sword. They both landed in front of Ubu, startling Ubu's 'vices'. The large man immediately fired the gun he was holding. The brothers easily dodged his shots. Damien kicked the gun in his hand, disarming him. Adrian immediately charged in, dodging a few hits from Ubu, before hitting him in his torso while Damien struck him in the face. Ubu staggered back to the wall, before he grabbed a pair of lamps at the two. The twins immediately took out their swords, cutting the pieces as if they were made of butter. Adrian turned to the two other occupants of the room, \"Leave, harlots!\" He growled with a threatening motion of his sword. The girls immediately ran out the door in fright. Damien jumped to the bar counter in the room, as Ubu walked back, before he grabbed the bottom of the counter and flipped it over, knocking Damien off his footing. Adrian caught his brother before he could hit the floor, then they saw Ubu putting on a pair of claws. He jumped over the flipped counter to hit them. They both parried with their swords, also countering his attacks with their own deadly strikes. Ubu had a hard time blocking their attacks, before he saw a small opening. He managed to slice Adrian's torso, luckily it did not injured the boy. Adrian immediately retaliated with another attack, managing to create an opening for Damien to knock Ubu off-balance, before Adrian kicked him across the room, slamming to the wall. Ubu growled, charging at the two boys. His attacks were fast and vicious, but the boys were able to block and parry most of them. They countered his attacks, before managing to stagger him back. \"Where is Deathstroke?\" Damien demanded. Ubu gave a chuckle, \"Did you think it would be that easy? Just ask and I will talk?\" He taunted. Damien turned to Adrian, who had a cold smirk on his face. Damien mirrored his smirk, as Adrian replied, \"No, we were hoping it wouldn't be.\" Their battle reached the streets, and the odds were against Ubu. He was exhausted and sweating, the boys weren't even breaking a sweat. Their weapons were locked, Ubu fighting to overpower the twins. His efforts were futile as they took the jump on him and kicked him in the face. Ubu was badly wounded, trying to crawl away, only to find Damien with his sword raised in front of him, \"Either we get answers, or you get the sword.\" Ubu glared at him, \"Do your worse.\" Damien gave a sadistic smirk. He swung his sword with a cry, when it was blocked by Adrian's. Damien looked to his brother, \"We need him to talk.\" Adrian said. Damien closed his eyes, before sighing, opening his eyes and nodded to his twin. Ubu looked to the other twin, \"I wonder what use you will have once Deathstroke found out that his right hand was beaten by a pair of children, hmm?\" Adrian said with a raised eyebrow. Ubu was about to retort, but his injuries had taken its toll on him. He immediately fainted. Adrian blinked twice at the man, \"Well,\" he started, \"I wasn't expecting that.\" Damien gave his brother a deadpan look, \"We overdid it.\" Adrian mirrored his deadpan look, \"You think?\" He asked in a very sarcastic tone. \"Well since he is no longer of use to us,\" Damien said, as he raised his sword to end Ubu's life. Adrian noticed something else, \"Uh, Damien-\" Adrian didn't get to finish as he and his brother was tossed over. They hit the ground with a grunt, looking to see who it was. They immediately recognized the blue bird symbol, \"Nightwing.\" Adrian muttered. Great, their, technically, step-brother was here. Nightwing looked at the two on the ground, \"The psychos just keep getting younger.\" He said to himself, before noticing that one of them had their hood down and had a familiar but rather younger face with blue eyes. 'Bruce?' Nightwing thought with confusion, before noticing the other one had the same face as the first, but with green eyes, \"Okay, either I'm hallucinating, which I'm not, or you both look familiar to a certain someone I know.\" Adrian gave his… well he was technically his older brother, not by blood, but still brother, a sheepish look, \"Uh, we can explain?\" Damien groaned at his brother. Well, it was better than fighting him, Damien guessed. They both knew how skilled Nightwing was. Even with both of them together, they wouldn't be able to beat him. \"We're his sons.\" Damien decided to just be rather blunt. Adrian face-palmed, sometimes, his brother was too blunt for his own good. Nightwing immediately knew who they were referring too, giving them shocked looks, \"Mother?\" Both boys immediately answered, \"Talia Al Ghul.\" Nightwing sighed, holding his nose in frustration. \"Well, what are you gonna do with him?\" He said, gesturing to the unconscious form of Ubu. Adrian gave his brother a look that basically said, 'let me do the talking', Damien couldn't care less, \"Well… we were going to make him talk first, before disposing him,\" Nightwing gave a raised eyebrow at the last part. So they were trained by the League. Of course. \"But, now that you're here… well up to you, I guess, big brother.\" Nightwing didn't know what it was, but he felt that he might… no, could get along with them. The green-eyed one was definitely going to take more time than the other. \"I'm Adrian,\" Adrian introduced himself, before gesturing to his twin, \"This is Damien.\" Nightwing smiled, \"Well, I guess you already know who I am.\" \"Of course.\" Nightwing noticed Damien had a bored tone. Yep, this one was going to be a lot tougher to get along with. Adrian seemed much nicer. \"Well, you're not gonna kill him.\" Adrian hesitantly nodded, while Damien clenched his fists. Before Adrian could stop him, with a battle cry, Damien charged at Nightwing with his sword. Adrian face-palmed. Oh boy.[Chapter 6] I just want to be clear, I love SOME elements of the new 52, but I really hated the fact that they paired up Superman with Wonder Woman. Justice League TV series was one of my most favorite DC childhood series, and one of the things I liked about it was the chemistry between Batman and Wonder Woman. And I absolutely love Dick Grayson with Starfire because of Teen Titans series (not Teen Titans Go! That's one reboot series I absolutely HATE… one of some). And I also added some things that I wish were in the DCAU. So just wanna get this out of the way. I'll pair Adrian with Raven mainly because in JL v TT, Damien and Raven had a very (in my opinion) weak chemistry (then again, idk if I could do better). And to be clear all of THIS will be in this story. So it won't be just until JL v TT, there will be some things pass that. I am planning on adding the old Justice League series into this, also there will be some elements from DC Rebirth, because there are some things there that I (and fans of the old DC, might) like… okay, I've said too much. DISCLAIMER: I DON'T OWN ANY DC CONTENT. In Trouble… And A Predecessor Revealed When Damien had blindly charged in to fight Nightwing, he had honestly expected Adrian to at least help him. Instead, his (technically younger by a couple of hours) brother only watched on the sidelines. Even though it was no surprise that they were outmatched in both skill and experience (yes, they haven't exactly gone through anything as bad as Dick), he still expected him to help. Instead the fight ended with Damien tied to a lamp post, Nightwing with numerous cuts on his body (not fatal, as Damien wasn't trying to kill him), and Adrian standing sheepishly and looking quite guilty for not helping his twin. They could hear their father from the com that Nightwing was holding, \"Talk.\" Their father said sternly. \"Missing something?\" Nightwing asked in reply, sarcastically. \" Not in the mood for games.\" \"Yeah… well these two are certainly not playing like siblings.\" Nightwing said. There was a pause, before the three of them heard a small sigh, \"I'll be right there.\" The call ended, as Nightwing looked over to the hanged twin, \"Why did you do that?\" Adrian jumped on lamp post and cut the ropes holding his brother, who both managed to land. Damien answered, \"We were trained by the League of Assassins, taught to kill. What did you expect? Let you take the target?\" \"Yet your brother didn't help you out on that.\" Nightwing replied. Before Adrian could reply, his brother answered, \"He's much more knowing of when to back down.\" Adrian shot his brother a surprised look, \"You are too.\" Damien glanced at Adrian with a raised eyebrow and a small smirk, \"Not as much as you do, and you know it.\" Adrian wasn't going to back down. He was really stubborn when it comes to his family, even the ones he had met only recently, \"Well, you still have some better traits than me.\" \"Indeed. Traits that you could counter with and vice-versa.\" \"…Touché.\" Nightwing gave the boys an amused look–despite his minor injuries, 'Huh, I think things are going to get interesting now.' Add the fact that they both reminded him of himself and… a certain someone. Granted, unlike these two, they weren't twins–but they had been brothers, not by blood, but still brothers. And as he was seeing the two interact, he couldn't help but feel a wave of old memories rushing back. After they all arrived at the Batcave, Alfred (conveniently) arrived with a medical kit to sew Nightwing's wounds… to the utter confusion of the twins. Really for the man to survive being the butler, and practically caretaker, of the BATMAN is a feat of itself, so they didn't know if they should amazed or shocked or disturbed… or all three at the same time by the fact that he was so prepared. \"It really ticks me off after ALL those lectures he gave ME about using protection.\" Dick couldn't help but comment, as Alfred sewed his wounds. \"Indeed.\" Alfred replied. Despite the fact that Dick both had already met the twins, he just couldn't help but be annoyed by Bruce (when has that ever not be an understatement)… the man had faults (he was still human after all), but this had to be a record. Even so, Dick had to admit that there had to be some sort of explanation for this. Dick grunted at the sudden pain from the stitching, having forgotten about his injuries. \"Are you alright, Master Dick?\" Alfred asked in slight concern. He couldn't help it. Despite having taken care of many wounds of Bruce and Dick. And Dick couldn't blame him. Despite his minor injuries, they all had been reminded of the fact that despite all their accomplishments, they were still human, when it happened. \"Maybe you need more anesthetic.\" They both looked up to see the twins. Adrian had a surprised face, pointing to Damian. If Dick hadn't learned to read people well, he wouldn't have caught the slight concern tone from Damian… and Alfred said he was the harder-to-like twin. \"Well, I took the cut, I can handle the stitch.\" Dick replied. After a few moments of silence, Adrian decided to speak. \"Father didn't know about us, you know.\" Nightwing looked to the blue-eyed boy, \"He was drugged by mother the night he… made us.\" That… was putting it very bluntly. \"Yeah, well… for now, you two aren't turning out to be so bad… yet.\" He said, eyeing the green-eyed twin with amusement. It would actually be fun to have Damian act out as the bad twin. \"Hm, that will happen sooner or later.\" Damien said. Alfred was nearly finished with stitching the wound, when Damian walked to the glass barriers. Adrian followed closely behind him, as they glanced at their father's old Batman suits. They then stopped at the one displaying Robin. \"This was yours?\" Damian asked with amusement. Really, who could blame him? The suit actually looked quite ridiculous, in the aspects of protection. Then again, they had studied and found something interesting when they had been researching about their father. There was supposedly another robin that their father had taken in who wore the mantle with a modified version of the uniform. If what they read was true, that person was two years younger than Dick and was recruited exactly one year after Dick had left to become Nightwing. The name had strangely been erased from the archives that they had read. The details of it still baffled them to no end however. How could someone be brave enough to try and steal the Batmobile's tires? As Damian pushed the glass barrier to open it, Dick immediately closed it. \"Still is, and please keep your hands off.\" Adrian curiously asked, \"Is this what you wore in training?\" \"It's what I wore when I'm on patrol.\" Damian looked at the suit in amusement, \"The only thing its missing is a lace trim and a sun hat.\" Dick smirked, immediately catching up on the boy's hidden tone of admiration, \"You two don't fool me. I know what you're thinking, that you can become Robin. Well, there are two things I'm having trouble getting at. First, both of you are not ready yet. Second, there's only one Robin.\" \"My brother doesn't want to be Robin, at least not exactly.\" Damian replied, gesturing to his twin, \"He has something else in mind.\" Dick turned to Adrian with a curious look, slightly embarrassing the boy. His idea was not original in the least, but it did bring a new element. \"Uh, well, the name isn't exactly original, for starters. The suit design isn't much different too, only adding a few differences. So, it's not really copying the original… that was quite a pathetic explanation.\" Dick gave a thoughtful look, \"I think I get what you're saying. Can I have a look at it?\" \"No need. I have already finished the design as requested by Master Adrian.\" They saw Alfred holding a medium-sized sketch book. The twins, and Dick for that matter, would never know how the old man could be so stealthy… then again he survived being Batman's butler (how could they forget that fact?). \"…Uh, thanks Alfred.\" Dick said, as he took the book. As he examined the drawing, he couldn't help but admire the design. It was similar to the original, but there were two R symbols. There was also a golden line crossing at the chess forming an X. The cape was still the same with only black on the outside being the difference, but the gauntlets and boots were a grayer set of green. He couldn't help but feel nostalgic at the slight similarities it had with… \"Alfred… were you-\" \"I had intended to consult to Master Bruce, but I feel it would be much more fitting for you to decide. You are after all, the original.\" Dick smiled, \"I think you already know what my answer is, don't you?\" Alfred gave an amused grin, \"Then, would you all like to see it?\" They all looked confused for a moment, before Alfred switched a mechanism hidden beside the glass panel of the Robin uniform. Suddenly, they heard something coming from the glass panel next to the Robin uniform. They walked to see two more suits. One that was a more modified version of the first Robin uniform, the other with a similar design but with two R's and a golden line forming an X. \"Brother, do you think that's-\" \"I think we both know what it is.\" Dick and Alfred gave the twins a confused look. They expected Adrian to be excited at the finished uniform, but instead he (and Damian for that matter) was more focused on the one next to the original. They both turned to them and asked the inescapable question. \"Who was the second Robin?\" A/N: The Red Robin suit is basically like in the story image but with the added details, which is a shout out to the new Rebirth outfit (which is actually much more cooler than I thought).[Chapter 7] A/N: SCHOOL IS SO FREAKING ANNOYING! AT LEAST I HAVE GREAT FRIENDS :DDD! AND THANK YOU FOR THE REVIEWS/FAVS/FOLLOWS- I DON'T KNOW WHY I'M STILL YELLING! At LEAST I don't have anything else to do other than continue this since I'm just waiting for the graduation party now…YAAAAY! Whoo, finally I can focus. DISCLAIMER: I DON'T OWN ANY DC CONTENT. Slight Tension Done Unintentionally Dick raised an eyebrow at the two. Damien immediately noticed the tension in the room had spiked… and the source was coming from the front of the bat-computer. Adrian, for the first time in his life, became a bit nervous at the tension his father was giving off. Not even Ra's or his mother had ever been this tense. At least not that he can tell, as he had never tried to get on their bad side. Damien was hiding the same feeling his twin was giving off a bit. \"Perhaps we shouldn't have asked so soon.\" Adrian said in an uncharacteristically nervous tone. Damien couldn't blame him as well. Dick smiled internally. While the boys had been a bit… blunt, he couldn't exactly blame their curiosity. For all their behaviour and heritage, the twins were still, in some aspects, children. It was also fortunate that Adrian had voiced his opinion on their mistake. They may be family by blood, but he was sure that not even Bruce would share that particular secret to them. Not yet at least, as it would seem that neither Talia nor Ra's had told them, despite the fact that he was certain they knew what happened. \"Yeah, you shouldn't ask that question anytime soon.\" Dick said with a warning yet not intimidating, \"Give it time, he'll tell you when you're ready.\" He finished with a small grin. The twins looked at him in doubt, \"That won't be anytime soon.\" Damien said. It wasn't a question and they all know it. Alfred decided to speak, \"I'm afraid this matter is one you should approach with caution.\" \"No use stating the obvious,\" If Dick hadn't been so perceptive, he would've missed the small cringe Adrian did as he glanced at Damien, \"But thank you.\" Adrian swore he almost sigh in relief. Sometimes Damien's bluntness and behaviour frustrated him. He was convinced that someday, his brother would be the reason they both somehow got seriously injured. He was trying not to be so pessimistic, which was why he didn't say his brother would be the death of them. He may never realize that would happen someday… just not with the brother he thought. AN: Short chapter for now. It's better than nothing because my sisters always use the computer most of the time, unfairly might I add, but I can't do anything about it even though I am the big brother. I'll be scolded by my mom or dad. Unless I somehow become a big brother like Rodrick from Diary of a Wimpy Kid, I won't be having much computer time. And I have no intention of being a big brother like Rodrick because I am not that kind of big brother. By the way, just to be clear, I can't use a laptop because I do not have one and my dad's laptop is for work or emergencies (regarding school work).

Now thirteen, she is out for revenge. Her mother delivered horrible news: the little brother she loved was slain by the Batman. In his final breaths, he asked his mother to find his sister, so she could take his place as heir. Unwilling to kill before, Daire is now out for revenge. Her target: her brother's father.

They grew up together and are close. Damian is the favorite/ protege. Daire wasn't bad but not as talented as her grandfather and mother wanted her to be, making her the disappoint.[Chapter 2] ~ Prologue ~ The young girl could hear her mother's screams. She flinched, covering her ears. She wondered why the baby was hurting her mother. Why would the baby do something so mean? She couldn't understand. Her mother had been unusually kind and relaxed during the pregnancy. She still worked out, but no where near as much as before. She didn't work little Daire as hard, either. Her grandfather switched between two moods: train to protect the future heir and gushing as his daughter and granddaughter. Her mother didn't want for anything. She had everything handed to her. Her grandfather even had the best doctors come to watch over her and the baby, making sure the pregnancy went by without a hitch. The young girl wondered if this was what it was like when she was in her mother's tummy. She wondered how she fit in there. She was so big. Her mother told her she was a tiny baby. At first, they didn't think she'd make it. She was so frail and sickly. They almost gave up on her, thinking about leaving her to freeze to death outside. Now, she was tough for her age. She had plenty of training scars, and fought as furiously as anyone else in the compound. She was no where near as big or strong as the adults that surrounded her, but she was quick and agile. She had been taught to take down opponents many times her size since she could walk. She had spent every day of her young life training with her mother and grandfather. She wasn't gifted, but she worked hard. She practiced for hours by herself, waking up early to go over moves before her sunrise training started. Her hands flew to her ears as another high pitch shriek echoed off the walls. She wanted to run away. She didn't like hearing her mother in so much pain. She also wanted to barge into the room, to save her mother. \"It's almost over,\" the girl's father assured, nudging her small hand. Her parents were not together. Her mother was in love with another. She was a mistake. A product of a one night stand, whatever that meant. But they lived in the same compound, had the same leader. They were skilled assassins. The girl looked up at her father, who stared at the blank wall ahead. He didn't want to be here, the girl knew. Her grandfather forced him to spend time with his daughter, to be here for her. She didn't know what she did to make her father hate her, but she wasn't fond of being around him, either. He had this creepy gaze in his dark eyes. Soon, the screaming stopped. A minute later, a bold wailing started. A baby! Her grandfather opened the door, beckoning the child in. The girl hopped off the bench, leaving her father to see her newborn brother. She was lifted onto the bed beside her mother, who was sweaty and pale. She looked ill, but had an unusual smile blessing her pink lips. \"Daire, meet your baby brother Damian.\" The girl leaned over the little bundle. He was quiet now, his eyes scanning his surroundings curiously. He was so squishy looking. The girl gently touched his exposed cheek. A green blanket covered most of his tiny body, letting the girl see only his face. He barely had any hair. His cheeks were plump and rosy. His eyes a bold green that matched her and her mother's. She had seen pictures of her brother's father, who was different from her own. He looked much like a baby version of the stern man. Big green eyes blinked, staring at the girl. \"Hi, Dami. I'm your big sister,\" the girl greeted, smiling. The infant let out a short giggle, a gummy smile appearing. \"Awe, he likes me!\" (AN: I know he wasn't really \"born\" so here's this) The young girl looked up in the tube, where her baby brother floated, eyes closed. He was finally big enough! He was finally coming out! Daire would finally get to hold her baby brother. She had been waiting months for this day. She wasn't to be in the room when the removal procedure happened, but she here for little Damian now. She rested her hand on the glass, watching his leg twitch, kicking the container it was in. Her mother had told her how usual pregnancies go, but her little brother had the perfect genetics. He was being watched every second of the day. The best doctors in the world were here, helping her baby brother grow. The young girl had been told of the time when she was in her mother's tummy. She wondered how she fit in there. She was so big. Her mother told her she was a tiny baby. At first, they didn't think she'd make it. She was so frail and sickly. They almost gave up on her, thinking about leaving her to freeze to death outside. Now, she was tough for her age. She had plenty of training scars, and fought as furiously as anyone else in the compound. She was no where near as big or strong as the adults that surrounded her, but she was quick and agile. She had been taught to take down opponents many times her size since she could walk. She had spent every day of her young life training with her mother and grandfather. She wasn't gifted, but she worked hard. She practiced for hours by herself, waking up early to go over moves before her sunrise training started. \"It's time.\" A few bubbles floated up to the top, where a small blanket of air had gathered where the blue-green liquid stopped. She let out a giggle before being pulled away. She was told to wait in the hall. A nice little bench had been placed there for her to wait. She scrambled on it, smiling. She didn't know how long the procedure would take. All she knew was she couldn't wait to officially meet her baby brother. She was eager, she could hardly sit still. He father- whom was at her side- assured, \"It's almost over,\" nudging her small hand. Her parents were not together. Her mother was in love with another. She was a mistake. A product of a one night stand, whatever that meant. But they lived in the same compound, had the same leader. They were skilled assassins. The girl looked up at her father, who stared at the blank wall ahead. He didn't want to be here, the girl knew. Her grandfather forced him to spend time with his daughter, to be here for her. She didn't know what she did to make her father hate her, but she wasn't fond of being around him, either. He had this creepy gaze in his dark eyes. Suddenly, there was a sharp, long wail. The girl leapt out of her seat, jerking back when her father's hand stopped her from going into the room too soon. She looked up at her father, but he simply shook his head. Obediently, she climbed back on the bench. the wails didn't last long, and soon her grandfather opened the door, beckoning the child in. The girl hopped off the bench, leaving her father to see her newborn brother. Her mother knelt down, holding a bundle of blankets. Daire walked over, seeing a plushy little face. \"Daire, meet your baby brother Damian.\" The girl leaned over the little bundle. He was quiet now, his eyes scanning his surroundings curiously. He was so squishy looking. The girl gently touched his exposed cheek. A green blanket covered most of his tiny body, letting the girl see only his face. He barely had any hair. His cheeks were plump and rosy. His eyes a bold green that matched her and her mother's. She had seen pictures of her brother's father, who was different from her own. He looked much like a baby version of the stern man. Big green eyes blinked, staring at the girl. \"Hi, Dami. I'm your big sister,\" the girl greeted, smiling. The infant let out a short giggle, a gummy smile appearing. \"Awe, he likes me!\"[Chapter 3] ~ The Girl ~ \"I need you, Daire,\" the mother said. \"Damian needs you.\" The girl couldn't look at her mother. Her glare pointed at the ground. Her fists were so tight, her nails bit into her palms. Crying is for the weak; crying will get me beat. She silently chanted the rhyme her mother taught her when she was two. Crying was forbidden. Any sign of weakness was. Of course, family seemed to give some leeway but not much. Her brother's and her relationship seemed to be the exception. Once her grandfather realized it made the duo train harder, he allowed it. \"There's no way Dami is dead,\" the girl protested. \"He can't be.\" Her brother was one of the best fighters she knew. At eight years old, he put up a decent fight against Ra's Al Ghul. He never won, but he did better than most of Ra's students. He had been trained since birth. The girl was good, too, but not as talented as her little brother. The mother stepped forward, sorrow in her green eyes. She put a light hand on her daughter's shoulder. \"He's dead, Daire. My beloved killed him.\" \"But- But his father doesn't kill. It's not his M.O.\" Her rough palm gently cupped the child's cheek. \"People change, Daire. My beloved changed.\" \"But how did he find Damian? I thought he didn't know about him.\" \"Slade Wilson. Now known as Deathstroke.\" \"Grandfather kicked him out.\" \"He came back. He killed Ra's Al Ghul.\" \"Unlikely. The Pit would bring him back.\" Talia shook her head. \"His body was badly damaged. Not even the Pit could save him.\" Daire took a step back. \"But- but Grandfather.\" Her mother was a skilled liar. She never hesitated and had the eye of a hawk. Still, Daire trusted her. What reason would her mother have to lie? While it was unlucky Ra's was dead, it wasn't impossible. Daire had seen the impossible happen. But death was death. Her grandfather had cheated death a thousand and one times. But death eventually gets everyone. There is no escaping death. That's why Ra's Al Ghul was training Damian. Damian was the heir to the League of Assassins. He was born to kill, and he was good at it. His cold eyes and isolation made it difficult for him to act like innocent child, but people still put their guard down around the boy. He killed like his mother and grandfather before him: without hesitation. Her little brother had a soft side. He was human. Actions based on emotions weren't encouraged, but there was little they could do to stop emotions altogether. Besides, his passion was his greatest weapon. \"He's dead, Daire. They're both dead,\" insisted her mother. Her green eyes swarmed with strength and determination. Strangely, her eyes showed barely any sorrow or grief. But that was to be expected of the woman. She was raised from birth to be an assassin. \"Help me rebuild the League. Slade Wilson and the Batman made quite a dent. Damian would have wanted you to help. You know how loyal he was to the League. Join me. Kill your brother's killer. Avenge him. Save the League. It's what Damian would want.\" \"It's what Dami would want,\" the girl repeated, closing her eyes. It did sound like him. Dami never failed. Never. He loved Grandfather, Mother, and the League of Assassins. He would have died fighting. His father must have put up quite the fight. Dami was a skilled fighter. Not like Daire. Daire could practice more than Dami and still not be as good. Dami has the talent for fighting. \"Yes. It's what Damian would have wanted,\" the mother assured. Daire could hear the small smile in the woman's voice. Daire wasn't much of a killer- it was why she got kicked out of the League- but she would kill if necessary. \"Join me, Daughter. Help me rebuild the League your brother loved.\" Daire nodded, a tear slipping down her cheek. Her mother wasn't a beggar. If she was asking for help, she needed it. Whatever shambles the League of Assassins were currently in, Daire would do her best to fix it. She would help her mother strength the League to its former glory. And when the time came, she would carry on Ra's Al Ghul's legacy. She would not fail Grandfather. She would not fail her brother. Not Damian. Not ever again. \"Yes, Mother.\" oOoOoOoOoOoOo \"Robin, report,\" a stern voice commanded over the comlink. Robin, a young lad, raised his hand to the com, replying, \"Everything's clear,\" in a childish- pitched but equally stern voice. He paused, watching a young teen boy walk beside a young woman. They laughed, the girl bumping purposefully into the boy's shoulder. The boy beamed, returning the playful gesture. \"Whatever, you're just jealous because dad bought me a new game system,\" the girl challenged. \"So? You have to share it with me until you leave for college!\" the boy rebuked, still smiling. \"Which is in, like, six months!\" \"Not if I have any say about it.\" The boy let out a wicked laugh, running ahead with glee. \"Thomas!\" the girl called, laughing. An unease grew in her brown eyes the further her brother got. A sense of relief flood her when he stopped and turned, waiting for her to catch up. Robin remembered the days before he put on the mask. The years he spent training to take over the League of Assassins, his birthright. He remembered his older sister. How kind, gentle, and motherly she was. He loved his mother and grandfather, he would do anything for them. But he would save the world for his lost sister. She was the main reason he agreed to be Robin and stop killing in the first place. He wondered how time had changed her. She was smart, cunning, and skilled. Not as skilled as he was, but skilled nonetheless. He didn't see himself as stronger than her, not anymore. What she lacked in physical strength, she more than made up for in empathy. Something he struggled with. She never gave up, found unlikely success without casualties (much like his father. Honestly, he doubted they had different fathers. She was so much like his father.) and had the purest heart he had ever known. She had a strong sense of morality, despite her upbringing. Their grandfather blamed it on her early interaction with society. She had been trained to act like the child she seemed to be to get close to targets, taught what to say and how to act. Somewhere along the line, it stopped being an act. A scream pulled Robin out of his thoughts. The boy had a gun to his head, tears in his eyes. His sister was frantically trying to bargain with the lowlife, handing over her purse without protest. Robin leapt down and landed silently in the shadow between two buildings. Staying low, he darted across the empty street. The criminal noticed him too late, and Robin took him out with a few well placed punches. The pair of siblings took off the moment they got the chance. Robin tied the man up. It was obvious he wanted the money for drugs. His pale, sickly skin told it all. He alerted the police, disappearing as a voice spoke to him. He raised his hand back to the com in his ear to answer, \"Just some deadbeat trying to mug someone. I took care of him.\" Pause. \"I didn't need help. I can take care of myself.\" Another pause. Robin huffed but complied, \"On my way.\" oOoOoOoOoOoOo The girl was panting but kept alert. Surrounded by half a dozen men, all bigger and buffer than her, she couldn't afford to lower her guard. One charged at her, screaming. She did a back flip over him with little effort, jumping over his six foot frame. With the bamboo staff in hand, she swiped at the back of her knees. With a yelp, he crumbled. She had less than a second to dodge the opponent creeping behind her. Having felt his quiet presence the moment he started moving, she ducked. His arms collided, sweeping over empty air. Before he could register what went wrong, he instinctively circled inwards on himself. His torso flared with pain in three places, then his head was quickly guided down to a hard knee. He let out a wince, rolling to the ground to coddle his bloody and broken nose. The rest of the men were more weary, two charging her at once. She leapt at the one who reached her first, talking a running few steps to gain momentum. She twirled, circling her arm around his unsuspecting torso. The force of her body spinning around his waist through him off balance, and he stumbled into his partner, who had been kicked in the gut by the girl's flying legs. The girl let her grasp of the man go, landing elegantly on the balls of her feet as the men kissed the ground. She couldn't help the smirk that graced her lips. She couldn't help but feel smug. She had missed this feeling. Feeling strong, powerful, and invincible. She only lost battles with her mother, grandfather, and talented little brother. She had been trained to win, not lose. To succeed, not fail. To kill, not die. She wasn't going to fail her family- her little brother- again. She failed him in life, but she refused to leave him in death. She would avenge him. An eye for an eye; a life for a life. Another set of men charged at her, hesitating. She hit the pressure points of the big one, disabling him in seconds. She did a cartwheel, going to the left to dodge a punch. She went to turn, prepared to finish the fight she was growing bored with. This wasn't challenging. Was this really how little her mother thought of her? One of the guys she had previously taken down reached out, wrapping his hand around her ankle. Her eyes widened as her leg was held back, not moving with her. Her arms started flailing desperately searching for balance. She managed to yank her way out of the weak grasp, refusing to fall. She straightened, but steadied herself moments too late. Strong arms wrapped around her, firm and stiff. She squirmed, feeling for any weakness or weak spots in her cage. She cursed her age and height when her feet dangled above the ground. She could feel hot, quick breaths against her hair. Her skilled kicks weakened the hold momentarily, but then it re-tightened. She felt the arms tighten around her, limiting her air supply. She gritted her teeth throwing her head back. With a grunt, the man stumbled back, dropping her to bring his hands to his bloodied mouth. She flipped around, surprised but not reacting to the amount of blood falling down his chin. He pulled his hand away, his eyes widening at its contents. He didn't have time to get over his shock. The girl jumped and spun, roundhouse kick to the side of his head. He flew to the ground, a bloodied rock clicking out of his hand and against the ground. \"She broke my tooth!\" he wailed, scouring the stone ground for the little white pebble. No, Daire realized. He was looking for his tooth. She smirked, feeling an odd mixture of pride and guilt swirl in her stomach. Thinking of her late baby brother, she pushed the guilt aside. She shouldn't feel guilt. She couldn't let her feeling guide her from doing anything but carrying out Damian's legacy. Her love for her brother would be the only emotion driving her. Guilt, sadness, pity, and any other worthless emotion would be discarded. \"My tooth!\" came the cry. It was repeated a few more times. Pathetic. She didn't have time for them. \"Sloppy,\" her mother scolded. \"Next time, kill them.\" The girl's head snapped towards her mother, ignoring the men's fearful and shocked expressions. \"They're part of the League,\" she reminded. \"Next time, they won't be. Besides, the League has no use for those who lose. Either win, or die.\" Sensing her daughter's empathy, the mother assured. \"Batman nor Deathstroke showed Damian mercy. We will do the same to them. We will make the League strong and proud, for Damian.\" The girl caught the sword tossed her way. The woman pointed to the three with injuries: the broken nose, missing tooth, and a third whose leg snapped on a bad fall. The bone wasn't showing, though it poked through the skin at his shin in a disturbing way. He was barely keeping in his shouts, biting his lip so hard it bleed. \"For Damian,\" Daire repeated, tonelessly. With three quick, precise movements, the three stopped moaning and groaning and went still. \"You three,\" Talia snapped to the survivors, \"dispose of the bodies then return to training. You're disappointments to the League.\" They scurried to their feet, not daring to oppose or challenge her authority in any way.[Chapter 4] ~ The Target ~ Ra's Al Ghul and Talia had quite a few files on the Batman. Some of the places he trained, his identity, his past, his butler, his butler's past, and the kids he took in over the years. Even DNA samples! Ra's was more interested in his strength and ability to take over the League of Assassins and continue his work. Talia was less interested in that but still kept up to date. She had plans on how they could use his company to help the League take control of the world. Those documents were new, dating after Ra's and Damian passed. Rather than a twisted version of doing what's best for the world, Talia flat out wanted to rule it. On any other day, that would concern Daire, but after her baby brother's death, she could understand whatever pain their mother must be in. Not that she showed it. But surely she was mourning. She lost her father and son. Daire pushed aside her mother's plans, focusing on her assignment. She went through every file the League had on the Batman. She also surfed the internet for articles on both Batman and Bruce Wayne. There was a lot about him, for both personas were famous, but Daire was a quick reader with an excellent memory. It took a few hours, but Daire finally finished going through everything. She stood, stretching her unused muscles before shutting down the computer and heading out. She wasn't quite sure what she wanted to do, but she knew she needed to move. Sitting for long periods of time made her want to move. She was used to contact movement and had a lot of built up energy just waiting to be released. What better way to get rid of excess energy than to work out? Daire walked into the training room, spotting Damian's clone by the punching dummy. With amazing accuracy, Clone landed a series of punches on the dummy. If the dummy wasn't bolted to the floor, he would have knocked it over. Daire cleared her throat, trying to hold back tears. Clone looked so much like Damian (for obvious reasons) and it made Daire's heart ache at the thought of her brother's untimely death. He would never grow up, into an adult like Clone. He would have been such a handsome young man. He would surely have the looks to get anyone he pleased. With some work on his people skills, he would be quite the charmer. Clone turned, his breath heavy with exertion. Daire stepped forward, pointing out the few mistakes she saw. It wasn't much, but that much was to be expected from Damian or his clone. She pointed to the spot on the dummy. She curled her fingers into themselves but not her palm. Using the nubs, she jabbed certain parts of the dummy. \"Rather than using blunt force, a quick series of jabs at pressure points will have your opponent breathless in seconds. Even the strongest man alive has pressure points. They always work. Some people can take a punch, or many, but every body has a weakness.\" Without hurting him, Daire pointed out the places on Clone. He nodded, something she didn't recognize swimming in his eyes. He had had this look before, Daire had noticed. Daire stepped back, letting Clone get into his stance. \"No,\" she stopped before he started. \"You're form is off.\" He frowned. \"No, it isn't.\" \"For this style of fighting, yes it is. Here.\" She moved his limbs as she saw fit, which was odd to Clone. \"I know that a tank like you won't be taught this, but I think it's important everyone learns this. Who knows, you might someone who uses this technique? If you know it, you can block it. Lean on your toes, knees bent a bit more. Not that much. There you go.\" For Clone, the position felt strange, less sturdy. But he kept it. As instructed, he jabbed the dummy in quick thrusts. He looked at Daire, who was shaking her head. \"Good, but you don't need so much force. You can seriously hurt someone if you use that much force. You need some force, yes, but not much.\" He narrowed his eyes. They were assassins. It was their job to hurt people. Daire seemed to sense his confusion and smiled. She didn't comment on it but kept teaching him. Clone knew he preferred her teaching methods. They were strange, ending in less bruises and broken bones, but it was nice. She was gentle, kind, and patient with him. He enjoyed her company. He went through the series of movements until Daire nodded and stepped in between him and the dummy. \"Good. Very good. You're a fast learner,\" she complimented. He nodded, liking but not sure how to respond to the comments only she gave him. A wave of sorrow flooded her. She whispered, \"You're just like him.\" Clone didn't need to hear anymore. He knew who she was talking about. He also knew his original was alive. Seeing Daire hurt like this made him want to tell her the truth. Such a kind girl didn't deserve this pain. But he knew Mother wouldn't approve. Besides, he was greedy. He wanted Daire to stay. She straightened herself then leaned into a fighting stance. The same one he just learned. \"Fight me.\" Clone blinked. \"What?\" \"Fight me.\" \"But-\" he remembered her earlier words, taking fear from them. \"What if I hurt you?\" She smiled. \"I'll be fine. I grew up here. I'm used to pain.\" He burrowed his eyebrows together. It was nice to hear the truth, but the truth also had a dark twist. How could Mother be so cruel to Daire? She was kind and gentle and nice. She wasn't like anyone he ever met, though that wasn't saying much. \"I don't want to hurt you.\" Daire kept smiling, her eyes relaxed. \"Don't worry, Clone. I'll be fine. Fight however you want.\" Though he was skeptical, he sunk into usual position, striking first. Daire was quick and light on her feet. She had dodged the blow with ease. Clone blinked, picking up some slack. He had taken it too easy on her. He threw another punch, gasping when Daire sidestepped, grabbed his wrist, and began to flip him over. She stopped a moment before he should've been lifted off the ground. They paused for another moment, then Daire released him. \"Again.\" Clone got back into his familiar stance, know full well he could beat Daire even without the new moves. She was right, they were nice to know, but he wasn't like her. He was bigger and stronger. He lounged into another punch. She dodged it, but wasn't expecting the immediate second punch. His fist collided with her chest, bordering her neckline, and sent her flying back. With anyone else, Clone would have continued. But not with Daire. He was sure he had hurt her. He lowered his stance, eyes wide. But Daire wasn't affected as much as he thought. She pushed her hand against the ground, doing a one handed back hand spring and landing elegantly on her feet. \"Good,\" she coughed but didn't slow. She charged at Clone, making him hastily put back up his guard. She threw a series of quick jabs at him. He barely managed to dodge any, but he knew Daire was taking it easy on him. She wasn't hitting the exact pressure points. Or not all of them, at least. But she was right, he was out of breath and sore within thirty seconds of her assault. When she jumped back, his limbs felt heavy and he panted. She was patient, letting him catch his breath. His shifted his stance into the new one, the one he just learned. Daire shifted, too, her stance seemingly sturdier, her eyes alert. This time, she struck first. Clone's instinct was to jump back. His mind automatically swung his arm to block the attack, knowing where the attack would be. Daire gave him a quick nod before striking again. This time faster. The pattern continued, her slowly increasing speed, until he had problems blocking her attacks. Then she bounced around like a kangaroo. When would press her fingers against a new pressure point but not jab him like she should have. She showed him dozens of new pressure points around the body. He was almost surprised at how many weaknesses the human body had. Daire carefully explained the importance of blocking certain series of jabs, which had potential to leave one temporarily paralyzed. Gently, she went through the motions, gently tapping the places he should always be weary of. She taught him a few other tricks over the next three hours of constant training. They only stopped twice for water breaks, and both were sweating by the time Talia entered. \"There you are,\" she snapped. \"I thought I told you to get the jet ready.\" Clone realized the time, body tense. \"Yes, Mother. Sorry, I forgot.\" Mercilessly, she slapped him. \"I don't want excuses.\" She turned to Daire. \"And I thought I told you to learn everything about my beloved before you left.\" Without emotion, Daire responded, \"I did.\" Not wanting to face Talia's wrath, Clone left when she started questioning her daughter. oOoOoOoOoOoOo Daire arrived at dinner late, with a limp and a few bruises on her exposed skin. Clone widened his eyes in shock. He knew it wasn't him who left those marks. Daire sat down beside Clone after getting her food. She was unusually quiet, keeping her gaze downwards when Talia entered a minute later. Clone felt a wave of something, but he didn't quite know what it was. He knew he didn't like seeing his sister like this, and he knew he was mad at his mother for hurting her. But what could he do? If he couldn't beat Daire, he surely couldn't defeat Talia. Instead, he kept quiet, carefully watching Daire as she ate her single roll. It was the only food she received, probably by her mother's orders. Talia was strict and didn't take failure well. She was especially harsh on her own child, whom she expected perfection from. He knew it all too well, but it was in his blood to be perfect. It was why he was created. oOoOoOoOoOoOo Clone knew something was wrong with Daire. He didn't know how or why he knew, but he knew. He walked down the halls, searching for her room. She had taken her old room, but it was right next to his original's old room. It was also near Mother's room. He stopped outside Daire's room. He kept silent, knowing he would get in serious trouble if Mother caught him. She hated the weakness of emotions. But he had to know if his sister was okay. He raised his hand to knock then froze. There was a weeping sound coming from the original's room. Damian's room. Quietly, he opened the door, whispering, \"Daire?\" She sniffed. \"Yeah, Clone?\" He opened the door further. \"Are you okay?\" He honestly didn't know why he asked, but it seemed right. She was crying; she wasn't okay. \"Yeah, I will be,\" she assured, sniffing again. Will be? So not now? He came all the way into the room, shutting the door behind him. It was dark but his eyes were adjusted. A single candle flickered near the bed. He looked around. Other than a small layer of dust, the room was in perfect condition. The area around the bed was dust-free. Daire's doing, no doubt. She once told him she wanted to leave the room just how Damian left it, despite the plain-ness of it all. \"Do you want someone to talk to?\" Daire had told him talking to someone was nice and helpful. She told him it took this invisible weight off one's shoulders. \"S- Sure,\" she hiccuped. Clone made his way over to the bed, sitting at the foot, beside Daire. She clutched the hard pillow, digging her nose into it. He heard her inhale deeply, then pull away to let out a quiet sob. He didn't know what to do. All he knew was that he hated seeing his sister like this, all sad. \"Sometimes, talking about something helps,\" Daire had said. \"Will you tell me about him? About my original? About Damian?\" She shook her head. \"Don't call him the original. You may have the same DNA, but it doesn't mean you're any less real. Identical twins can be very different.\" She peered up at the fully grown version of her baby brother and tears sprang to her eyes once more. \"You look so much like him,\" she breathed, squeezing her eyes shut. \"But yeah, I'll tell you about Damian.\"[Chapter 5] ~ The City ~ Daire Al Ghul walked through the dim courtyard. The setting sun making the shadows longer. Her eyes blindfolded, she was heavily dependent on her hearing. The wind was not on her side, loud enough to make a dull roar around her. Still, she walked with confidence. While it had been a while since she took this challenge, it was not her first. He hadn't meant to, but her first opponents grazed his foot against the ground, alerting her of his presence. Without hesitation, she swiped her sword at him. She heard a clang, their swords met. Ducking down, she took another swipe for his unprotected abdomen. She heard his shocked gasp and heavy stumbling. Daire had heard him fall and marched up to him. She heard the desperate wind from the sword, barely blocking it in time. She caught her boot on the blade, holding it to the ground. The man opened his mouth, begged for mercy. \" End him ,\" she knew her mother would say. Daire didn't wait for the command and took the initiative, making his death quick. By the end of the challenge, Daire was panting. Blood ran down her face and she cradled her right arm to her chest. She leaned on her left leg, leaning forward slightly. She had many cuts, most deep, but she did her best to ignore them. At her mother's command, she removed the blindfold. She blinked at first, adjusting to the sudden light. Her eyes scanned the bloodied ground. She pushed the guilt aside, knowing she was doing this for her brother. She started into her mother's eyes, waiting. With a firm nod, Talia declared, \"You're ready.\" oOoOoOoOoOoOo Daire forced herself not to cough. She wondered how people tolerated all the smog. She couldn't even see the sun. She could feel it's warmth, see it's light, but not it. She was walking around the city, glaring at anyone who came within two feet of her. She walked with such confidence and fast strides, people naturally made way for her. But few challenged her, probably because of her young age. A tourist map in hand, she soaked in every bit of information she could. Which alleys had fire escapes, were dead ends, good for hiding, great routes of escape, everything. She stayed out all afternoon, exploring. She walk all around Gotham, memorizing everything she deemed important or useful. If she was to take on Batman in his city, she'd need to know his city like the back of her hand. As dusk fell, she ducked into an alley, changing into the outfit her mother told her to wear. It wasn't a normal League uniform. None of the men she had with her wore it. Her mother wanted to keep the League's participation in this mission quiet. For now. Daire didn't understand why but went along with it. There was something her mother wasn't telling her, but it couldn't have been that important if it was being kept a secret. Her mother would have told her anything and everything she needed to know about the mission. Her hood on and mask raised, she climbed the fire escape. She hopped along the roofs, keeping a low profile. She didn't want to run into the Batman before she was ready. The mission would be over soon, but not so soon. Batman was skilled in battle and difficult to defeat. Hell, her grandfather couldn't beat him. Luckily, she'd have the element of surprise on her side. Daire heard a sudden scream, followed by a gunshot. She darted towards the commotion, seeing two teens and a mugger. No one seemed hurt. The shot must have been a warning one. The girl teen was obviously a couple years older. The boy was undecided, partly behind his sister and partly by her side. He wanted to protect her but he also wanted to be protected. The girl was hastily emptying her purse, throwing whatever money or valuables she had at the mugger. Daire jumped down, gracefully landing on her feet. The building had only been one story, but she still felt the jolt of contact. She used the excess energy to roll forward. Her leg kicked out, hitting the man's knee. He let out a grunt, collapsing. Daire swiped the gun from his hands, twirling it in hers as she stepped back. She waited for his next move. With any luck, he'd learn his lesson and scurry off like the art he was. She was trying to keep a low profile. No such luck. With a growl, he lunged forward. Daire sidestepped, placing two strategic kicks as he flew by. He landed with a heavy thud, groaning at the forming bruises. This time, Daire pointed the gun at him. When the mugger turned around to attack, he froze. Hands up in surrender, he slowly rose to his feet and back away. At the entrance of the alley, he sprinted off and out of sight. \"Thank you so much!\" the girl gushed, pulling Daire into an unexpected hug. She tensed, not used to the kind gesture. The girl pulled back before Daire could relax. \"I haven't seen you before. Are you new?\" Daire shook her head, putting her finger to her lips. Leaving the confused kids behind, she darted back up to the roof. \"Thanks!\" the boy called out. Daire ran for several minutes, getting to higher ground. Her chest squeezed with longing and tears sprang to her eyes. The girl had bright green eyes. The boy had raven black hair and held himself with confidence. Not as much as Damian, but it was enough. She leaned sat down, leaning against the border of the roof. Her eyes shut, flashes of her little brother flooded her mind. She gripped her hands into fists, a wave of determination crashing over her. Batman would pay for what he did. Daire would make sure of it. oOoOoOoOoOoOo Damian Wayne found himself stuck at a gala for one of his father's charity foundations. He hated the snug suit around him. He hated the imbeciles at the party. Hated their naivety and ignorance. Hated how they wasted their lives doing nothing. Not like him. Not like his father, either. Both father and son did a lot to help Gotham. Few people knew of their nighttime activities, but he wasn't Robin for the spotlight or fame. He heard a loud laugh. His father. With a glass of champagne in hand and a fake smile on his lips, he was surrounded by half a dozen women. Two sat on either side of him, leaning as close as possible. They all clung to his every word. Damian rolled his eyes with a quiet scoff. The masquerade was a sham. It wasn't hard to tell who was who under the revealing masks. It made him wonder how no one put together how him and his adopted brothers were Robin. Their mask only covered their eyes. Now the cowl covered much of Batman's features, so that was understandable. But Robin? He was surprised no one had figured it out yet. \"Hello, Robin,\" a light voice sung in his ear. To speak of Satan! He spun around, shocked. He caught the whisp of black hair. A domino mask covered the girl's eyes, but she looked amused at his shock. Through the mask, he knew she was looking directly at him. Without another word, she slipped into the crowd. \"Wait!\" A few people noticed his cry but quickly returned to their own beings. \"Wait!\" He pushed through a group of people, disrupting their conversation. They made small remarks but let him pass. The shiny hair reflected the light off the chandelier, catching his attention. He looked, seeing the domino mask and the smile. He dove after her, never managing to catch her. She was about his age, though a year or so older. Not many kids came to the galas, but that wasn't what caught his attention. He wasn't entirely sure what caught his attention. Probably the fact that she recognized him as Robin. For once, he was glad his father hadn't outed him to the public yet. Still, there was something else about her. Something familiar but also. . . not. He needed to speak with the girl. He chased her around the ballroom, following when she slipped into a side hall. She was quick and stealthy. Damian couldn't even hear her breathing in the silent hall. Guard up, he softened his own breath, hands twitching for a weapon that wasn't there. Opposite of Grayson's teachings, his father didn't want Damian to have a weapon on his person unless he was Robin. It wasn't that he needed a weapon to kill, but it showed the lack of trust between the new dynamic duo. Damian barely reacted in time. He leapt back, dodging the blade aimed for his ribs. He faced his attacker, eyes narrowing. She went straight for another attack. Though Damian recognized the technique, he knew there was a lack of force in the moves. This person didn't want him dead. So what did she want? Doesn't matter, he decided, sinking to the ground and swinging his leg out to knock his opponent down. He had questions of his own. Like how did she know his moniker? How much does she know? She fell heavily to the ground, immediately rolling back and to her feet. A strand of hair fell from the hood she had thrown on during his pursuit. She made no move to tuck it back in nor any kind of acknowledgement it was there. Her covered eyes stared at him. \"Who are you?\" he demanded to know. She didn't answer. They exchanged blows. Damian was winning. With each attack, his opponent was falling back. He smirked, pushing her further back. The pattern continued until she had her back to the wall. Before Damian could blink, she threw the window beside her open. oOoOo Daire climbed out a window, waiting for Robin to come close before leaping off the edge. Without hesitation, he followed her. Robin was impulsive, making her mission to lead him away easy. Too easy. If it weren't for his careless and quick eagerness to follow Daire, no matter the direction she led them, she would have suspected a trick. It took longer than planned, but Daire wanted to be sure there wasn't some sort of trap. Daire finally brought Robin to the others. Daire was studying her soundings, looking for something. With her attention elsewhere, Robin took the opportunity to attack. Daire did a back flip, jumping out of his reach. The new angle was perfect. Daire spotted Clone in the shadows, saw him nod once. With a quick gesture, a dozen League members jumped out of their hiding places. Robin glared but didn't seem caught off guard. As the others moved in, she backed off. Robin easily fought three off at once. Some of his moves were familiar. Daire recognized the style, but Batman had fought her grandfather and mother many times. It was no surprise that he'd teach Robin how to fight. But there were moves she recognized from other places, other styles. Few she didn't recognize at all. Needless to say, Robin was good. He'd beat the dozen enemies before him in no time. With one last signal, Daire ordered Clone to join the fight then disappeared into the shadows. She knew Clone had given Batman some kind of clue as to where to meet. She ran north, to an abandoned factory. No one would disturb them here. Standing on the roof, Daire looked out into the night. She wasn't high enough off the ground or close enough to watch Robin and the League members battle. If they were still fighting. Daire wouldn't be surprised if Clone and Robin were the only ones dueling. A car flew down the street, stopping abruptly outside the factory. The man in the cowl marched inside. Went around to a side entrance, but found his way in nonetheless. With a smirk, she turned to find my own way inside. It was time Daire met the infamous Batman. It was time she killed him.[Chapter 6] ~ The Batman ~ Daire raised her mask, leaving her green eyes to be seen under her black hood. She was silent, unnoticeable. She wasn't sure what Clone did to draw Batman towards her, but she was thankful. The mission had already taken longer than anticipated. Without warning, she leapt off the platform, diving at Batman. He barely blocked her sword in time with a bat-a-rang. With the element of surprise lost, Daire tightened her grip on the sword, staying low to the ground. She already knew his basic attack patterns, so she didn't hesitate to charge at him. Put him on the defense. Bat-a-rangs in hand, Batman blocked or dodged every attack she made. \"Who are you?\" he questioned at some point. \"Where's Robin?\" She refused to answer in anything but another attack, followed through with a grunt. \"Do you know who's behind this?\" he tried again, dodging the swishing blade. It nipped his cape, which flowed behind him. He glanced at the cut fabric with irritation. Even through his masked eyes, Daire knew the gaze. It was one she was all too familiar with. Daire took the opportunity to launch a flail of attacks, which the Dark Knight met each thrust and swing in time to only get a few nicks. If Grandfather could see her now. . . he'd be ashamed. Disappointed. It wasn't the fact that she was losing. Well, not completely. Her anger and grief fueled her, causing sloppy and exaggerated moves. It was not the way of the League. Not the way she had been taught. But she found herself rather dependent on the emotions. \"Stop,\" Batman ordered, twisting the sword out of her hand. The sword clattered to the metal ground, but Daire pulled out her spare knives, charging again. \"Stop this. Now.\" In another series of moves, Batman had one-upped her again, pulling one arm behind her back and twisting the other one, loosening both grips. The smaller blades clattered noisily to their feet while Daire squirmed, looking for a weak spot in the tightening grip. \"Give up,\" the deep voice growled in her ear. She was yanked closer to him, sending a wave of panic through her. Memories forced themselves to the front of her brain, taking over her sight. She struggled to remain in the factory she and Batman were in. Struggled not to go back in time. Instinctively, she flipped the man over her shoulder. Without a word, she dove in for the final blow. Unexpectedly, Batman threw his leg out with a grunt, knocking Daire over. He pinned her wrists to the ground, straddling her small body. \"Who are you?\" When she didn't answer, he continued, \"Who's behind this? Who do you work for?\" She flinched as his voice raised, making him back off. Without releasing her, he took some of his weight off her. \"You don't have to do this. You don't have to kill. There's always another way.\" Thoughts of her dead baby brother filled her mind, pushing fear and anxiety carelessly to the side. With a roar and incredible strength, she pushed him back. He went into a roll, quickly getting back up and dodging the series of attacks sent his way. \"You don't have to do this!\" he growled. Daire ignored his protests, annoyed at his lack of offense. She had heard Batman had a soft side for kids and she knew she was short for her age, but this was ridiculous. After a few rounds, Daire back off to catch her breath. Batman never took his eyes off her. He jumped, not expecting something. He heard something Daire hadn't. He paused, holding his hand to the side of his head. A com. \"Copy,\" he reported. Keeping his attention on Daire, he reached into his belt. Before Daire could do anything about it, smoke bombs bounced. Smoke filled their surroundings, but Daire simply stood there. She knew going after him would be fruitless. For now. But next time. Next time she'd kill him. oOoOoOoOoOoOo \"How'd it go?\" Clone asked when Daire returned to the safe house. \"Is the mission over?\" \"Not yet,\" she growled, surprising him with her bitter tone. She flipped down in a chair, slipping her hand down to slip something from underneath. A photo. Clone had seen this photo before. It was one of little Daire and Damian at a playground. It was the only one the siblings had ever been to, and it had been for their first mission together. The sun was bright but few people were around. The coats the children were wearing suggested of frigid temperatures. Both beamed into the camera, spots of blood littering their clothing, hair, and skin. It was one of two pictures Daire had of Damian. One of the few their Grandfather and Mother found worth taking. It was the one she held close. \"Tell me about him,\" Clone suddenly demanded. \"What?\" \"Please, tell me about him. About why you love him.\" Daire relaxed, frowning. \"I love him because he's my brother. Was. Was my brother. I love him because he gave me hope in the nightmare that was my life. I love him because of his innocence and determination. All he ever wanted was to be loved, unconditionally. While both adored him, neither Mother nor Grandfather could give him that.\" \"Why not?\" Daire shrugged, \"I don't know. He loved them without question. To him, they could do no wrong. He idolized them, did his best for them, pushed his limits to see the pride in their eyes. But, for whatever reason, it was never enough. Mother and Grandfather only saw the power, the strength in him. They did their best to smother any weakness, emotions, and childlike tendencies.\" \"Those are weaknesses.\" Talia had told him that many times. \"No,\" she denied. \"Emotion can help in battle. Not always, for example: tonight. But a strong one, like love, can win wars. It can change people for the better. Make them do the impossible.\" \"And you love Damian?\" Clone checked. \"Without a doubt,\" she nodded. \"And me?\" With the tenderness Clone had only seen from her, she smiled up at him. \"Of course.\" \"Is it hard to love?\" \"No,\" she answered immediately. \"But it can be dangerous. While it brings out good in people, it can also bring out the bad. Like with me. I'm prepared to kill, the one thing I promised to never do again, for D- Dami. I'm willing to take a life. An eye for an eye.\" \"It sounds like love hurts.\" \"Oh, it does.\" \"Then why love at all?\" She glanced up at him as if the answer was obvious. But she answered anyways. \"Because the happiness, the laughter, the joy is worth it. Every single moment with the person you love is worth it. Whenever I was with Dami, I was happy. Even in training, I was happy. I loved seeing the glow in his eyes whenever he was praised. He acted nonchalant about it, but he soaked the attention up. Needed it. It was like water to him. It kept him going, even when he couldn't go anymore.\" Clone frowned. Was that why his heart fluttered every time Daire complimented him? Did Daire see the same light in his eyes? Was that why she loved him, because he looked and acted like the original? Looking at the horizon, she continued. \"Sometimes, I see so much of my baby brother in you, it almost makes me cry.\" Clone frowned. He didn't want Daire to be sad. And just by looking at him? That definitely wasn't what he wanted. \"Sometimes you act so much like him, too. But then you do or say something he never would, and I'm reminded you are not him.\" \"Does- Does it make you sad?\" \"Of course it does. He was my baby brother. I'll always love him.\" \"A- And-?\" he couldn't finish the question, too afraid of the answer. But Daire seemed to know. \"And you?\" She leaned into his side. His arm instinctively wrapped around her back, his hand resting on her shoulder. \"You're like the big brother I dreamed of having. You're brave and strong, kind and patient. It took a bit of time with me to get you that way, but it was time well spent. Just like anyone else, you deserve to be happy.\" \"I am happy. I was happy.\" She glanced up at him, not believing him. But he didn't blame her. He didn't believe himself. She went along with it, squeezing him into a side hug. \"Good. You deserve to be happy.\" \"Daire?\" \"Hmm?\" \"Are- Are you my- my sister?\" \"Yes, we have the same Mother and Grandfather. Clone or not, you have my blood in your veins, a beating heart, feelings, and are you're own person.\" \"How do you know?\" She squeezed him again. \"Because you openly like hugs, just like me. Dami did, but he would always deny it. And yes, sometimes he didn't like physical contact, but overall he did.\" \"How else are we different?\" \"Hmm. Let's see. You tend to go along with things without reason. Dami was pretty bad about that, too, but he would ask questions, look for reason.\" \"I ask questions,\" Clone argued, defensively. \"I've never seen you ask Mother a question. I've never heard you call her anything other than Ma'am to her face.\" \"She isn't my mother. Not really. She didn't birth me, not like you and my original.\" \"So what? You're her son! Half her DNA is in you! That aside, you can have a family without being the same blood. All you need is love, respect, and each other.\" \"Where did you learn that nonsense?\" he asked, though he really wanted to believe it. She shrugged. \"My time away from the compound, the League. I made a few friends. Good ones.\" \"Where are they now? How come I've never heard of them?\" Daire smirked up at him. \"Protective big brother much?\" Before he could retract his questions, she cut him off. \"Its fine. It's nice to know someone cares. Anyways, I cut ties with them. Being a part of the League- being at the head- is dangerous. Keeping a friendship with them would put them in danger. It'd be selfish, so I let them go.\" \"Don't you miss them?\" Clone wondered. \"Of course I do. Just like how I miss Dami. A bit less than Dami, probably, but you get my point. That Daire is dead. After this mission, I'm going to be the best heir (besides Dami) that Grandfather could wish for.\" More to herself and in a whisper, she added: \"I'll make them both proud.\" \"Would- Do you think Damian would like me?\" Startled by the question, she needed a minute to ponder. \"Um, he didn't like many people, but I don't see why not. In a way, you are him. But then again,\" she trailed, eyeing him up and down, \"you're also different. Maybe.\" Seeing Clone's deflated expression, she pushed, \"Probably. With your talent and dedication, he'd certainly respect you.\" The compliments and the declaration brought a soft smile to his face. Then hesitation. \"Do you- What do you think of me?\" \"Me? Well, what's not to like? You're handsome, strong, funny, nice, you pay attention; you're amazing, kind, unique, and the big brother I've always wanted. You're perfect, Clone, just the way you are, okay? So don't go changing on me.\" Clone blushed lightly at the praise, loving the warm feeling of his little sister leaning into his side, pulling him into a hug. He closed his eyes, resting his cheek of the top of Daire's head. Daire glanced up, barely catching sight of the smile dancing at Clone's lips. It hurt, seeing what Damian would have looked like if he'd grown up. It hurt, seeing the wonderful, caring person both he and Clone could become. It hurt, losing her brother before she could save him. It hurt, she loved and missed him so much. It hurt.[Chapter 7] ~ The Dynamic Duo ~ Daire and Clone were in a hotel room, curtains ajar. The door was locked tight, and a television provided background noise. Daire finally moved her gaze, lowering the binoculars and handing them to Clone. \"He's not doing anything,\" Clone observed. He was in the same place he was ten minutes before, which was the last time he got a turn with the binoculars. He was so bored. He wondered how Daire managed to stay focused on something so dull. \"Now would be easy to carry out the mission.\" He glanced at the sniper rifle laying proudly on the bed. Daire, not glancing at him, knew what he meant. \"That's not the way the League does things.\" \"Sometimes they do.\" Daire sent him a stern warning look. \"That is only to be used as a last resort. We came here for a job. Do not fire unless I give the signal, and for the love of God don't shoot me!\" Clone frowned. Why would she feel the need to say that? To him, it was fairly obvious. What kind of moron had she been forced to team up with in the past? Daire left the room, her strides purposeful. She let the door slam shut behind her, letting it lock automatically by itself. Clone lifted the rifle, setting the tripod and gun on the table. He may not have as many hours of practice as Daire, but he was always told his genetics gave him an upper hand for everything. He'd had enough practice to know he was a great shot. Not perfect, like Daire (yet), but skillful. He watched the lazy, fat man though the scope, finger extended passed the trigger, straight but ready. The target jerked his head towards the door, muttering something under his breath as he forced himself up. He walked back into the room, this time followed by Daire. She was in a black outfit with a white apron. Excluding the apron, she did not appear to be one of the employees. The man didn't seem to care, letting her right into his room. She pushed a cart flooded with shiny plates, contents hidden by big domes. He waved her off, saying something Clone couldn't hear. Clone felt his anger rise when Daire bent over some to appear to do some last minute preparations for the man's food. She was actually putting on her mask. The sick eyes stared at the rising skirt. Clone wrapped his finger over the trigger, wanting to pull it. Then Daire turned around, a large knife in hand. The man didn't seem the least bit frightened. Surprised but not fearful. The man responded to her, so Clone assumed she said something. He couldn't see her clearly. She danced right along the edge of his sight. Boldly, Daire strutted up to the man. She leaned forward, and the man's greedy eyes flickered to her bust. Clone clenched his teeth. Suddenly, Daire's arm flew, and the man's eyes widened in pained shock. Daire spun around, catching his stare. She sent a quick signal: it was time to leave. She pulled off her apron, hiding the bloody cloth under her arm. She bunched it up just right, hiding stains from prying eyes. She away walked casually. Side mission: complete. Time to focus on Batman again. Swiftly, Clone packed up and left. oOoOoOoOoOoOo \"What did you just do?\" a deep voice asked Daire. Daire didn't answer, throwing a star. Batman, of course, dodged it with ease. Daire knew the bat worked mainly at night, but she didn't expect him to catch her red handed. She kept her breath even. She was trained for this. Batman wouldn't escape. Two heads with one blade. Nice. At least Daire wouldn't have to waste time trying to catch his attention and find him. Here he was, standing before her. Presented to her just like a gift. \"Robin, don't!\" Batman ordered, giving Daire a heads up. She ducked to the side, getting out of the way. Robin landed heavily on the spot she had been standing. That move. . . Could it be? No. Impossible. Daire rushed forward, trying to take out Robin. Everyone knew Robin was Batman's weakness. If she could take down Robin, Batman's focus would be split. He would be easier to kill. Robin, however, blocked her punch, leaning into one of his own. With her other arm, she barely managed to redirect it. She spun around, twisting Robin's arm behind his back. She tugged upwards, making him grit his teeth. Batman darted forward to help his partner, but Daire forced a step back, bringing her knife to his throat. She clicked her tongue in a taunting warning. As expected, Batman froze. \"Don't. You. Dare,\" he growled. The knife pressed deeper into Robin's skin. Daire knew she wouldn't do it. Robin wasn't her target. And she didn't kill kids. Robin was safe from her wrath. But Batman didn't know that. Robin sucked in a breath, and Daire could tell he was about to speak. She dug the knife further into his skin, careful not to break it. She didn't want to hurt him. His voice croaked, \"Batman, do it.\" Batman didn't move, his worry for the boy preventing action. Daire suddenly released the boy, using his shoulder as leverage to flip over him. Her feet firmly together, she kicked Batman right in the face. He stumbled back from the force, and Daire quickly went to work. With his build, she knew her weight wouldn't keep him pinned down. She was relying solely on his shock. She twirled the knife, aiming it to drive deep in his neck. Deep enough to kill, but not instantly. Daire wanted his last moments alive to be bitter and painful. Chocking on his own blood seemed good enough. She had wanted to draw out his death- torture him- but from his files, it would be a poor choice. He had a nasty habit of escaping. So, this would need to be quick. But it didn't need to be painless. A blunt disk smacked her hand, sending the knife flying. The blade grazed Batman's chin, leaving a shallow cut. At this point, Batman had recovered, rolling them over and pinning her down. She grunted, fighting to free her wrists from his firm grip. \"Who. Are. You?\" She didn't answer, continuing to struggle. The position was forcing her back in time, and she began to shake. Her breathing picked up, and her struggles became blind and desperate. The bat wouldn't relent. He eased his hold but kept her down. Daire forced herself back to reality. Gritting her teeth, she brought up her leg, making Batman roll over in pain. He wore a cup, so he'd get over the pain quicker Daire darted forward, reaching for his neck. If she couldn't slice his throat, she'd snap his neck. Not a painful death, but her brother's murder would be avenged. Suddenly, a leg swung out, forcing her back. Daire let out a grunt, rolling onto her hand and pushing herself up. She landed gracefully on her feet, her gaze catching the knife she lost. Robin let out a yell, lunging for her. She flipped over him, but he expected it and yanked her down. Her hand flew to the part of her mask around her mouth, struggling to keep her face hidden. Daire hit the floor, her head bouncing. Before she could blink away the dots, she swiped Robin's legs out from under him. She rolled onto of him, pressing harshly onto a pressure points. In seconds, Robin was unconscious. Or he should have been. Moments before he went out, she was yanked back. A mad bat threw her back, no longer caring for her age. \"Where'd you learn that?\" he growled. Daire blinked, wondering if he recognized the move. It hadn't been a part of her training with the League. It was something she learned before their mother deemed Damian old enough to be sent away. Most of his training was done with the League. Daire had a few trainers outside the League. She ran over the list of places the Batman trained. According to the files the League had on him, he shouldn't have known. But, as powerful as the League was, they didn't know everything. And Batman was hard to keep track of at times. Robin let out a string of coughs, his masked eyes glancing up in almost disbelief. \"Batman-\" Before he could say anything else, Daire threw down a smoke bomb. She wasn't a fool. She had lost this battle. But she'd get another chance. And she'd win the war. oOoOoOoOoOoOo \"Where have you been? I've been worried sick!\" Clone proclaimed the moment Daire stepped into the safe house. He rushed to the door, yanking her inside. Daire smiled, remembering the time she taught him the phrase. \"I ran into the infamous dynamic duo,\" she casually answered. Clone's attention peaked, eyeing her for injuries. None were noticeable. \"Batman? Are you hurt? What happened?\" Daire gave him a reassuring touch, resting her hand on his arm before shrugging off her gear. \"I'm fine. Almost got him, too, but his pesky little sidekick got in the way.\" \"We'll get him,\" she was assured. She stiffened. \"I know. I'll avenge my little brother if it's the last thing I do.\" Clone's heart clenched at the thought of her dying. She was unbeatable. He couldn't believe she'd lose a battle, let alone die in one. It just wasn't something he could imagine. Not something he wanted to imagine, either. While he loved his biological mother, this blood sister of his had taught him kindness, love, care, and how to smile. Daire is the one who taught him gentleness and tenderness. He remembered, at first he thought the girl was foolish. Thought the way she stop to watch a butterfly or a bird was a waste of time. Thought the way she didn't hit to kill was weak. But now he knew better. Killing doesn't mean you are strong. Knowing when and when not to kill is intelligence. Acting on that knowledge is patience. And not killing when provided the chance is strength. Talia Al Ghul didn't believe that, though. It was where mother and daughter butt heads the most. Talia wasn't for killing all willy nilly (as Daire once put it) but neither does she go out of her way to protect civilians. She'd sooner kill everyone to get to her target, regardless of innocence. To Talia, the end justify the means. \"Have you ever thought about a name?\" \"Hmm?\" he hummed, pulled out of his thoughts. \"A name. Ever thought of getting one?\" \"My name is Clone.\" Daire sighed, \"No, it's not. It's what you are.\" \"Isn't that a name?\" \"I'm human. It doesn't make my name Human. Damian is the original, doesn't make his name Original.\" He nodded, understanding. \"A name? For me?\" \"Yeah, surely you don't want to be called Clone forever.\" Daire nonchalantly made her way to the kitchen. She made a quick stop at the freezer, pulling out an ice pack and pressing it to the back of her head. She flung the pantry open, frowning at the lack of nutritious food. She settled for a package of Pop Tarts, muttering about going to the store later. Clone didn't know of many names. To be honest, it wasn't something he thought about. He was known as Clone. Being the only surviving clone, he thought the name was of honor. \"Any ideas?\" Daire plopped down on the used couch, popping a piece of her snack into her mouth. \"Not really,\" he admitted. He glanced at the ice pack she held. \"What happened?\" She shrugged, nonchalantly. \"Like I said, ran into the infamous dynamic duo.\" \"Did they hurt you?\" \"It's nothing I can't handle.\" Clone shook his head, remembering when he had said that to her. \"That's not what I asked.\" She must have remembered too, for she gave a small smirk. She flipped on the television, quietly warning, \"Emotional attachment is dangerous, you know.\" And that worried Clone. That shoulders a lot like her mother and not at all like Daire. But he didn't say a word.[Chapter 8] ~ The Joker ~ The night was long. Daire spent hours typing on her laptop, going over the previous night's events. Learning from her mistakes. She went over the fight at least fifty times, breaking down every move made and thinking over what she could have done differently. She let out a ticked grunt, slamming her fist against the table. Clone didn't comment, simply asked if she had slept. Yeah, a few hours, but that was all she claimed to need. She had more important things to spend her time on. According to her, sleep wasn't one of them. For a moment, Clone worried. This was the same girl who forced him to sleep just two weeks ago, rattling on about the importance of it. This was the same girl who two weeks ago, wouldn't have killed to ruthlessly. Was Gotham changing her or the League of Assassins? He didn't know. When she was done with her laptop, she went to the television. She turned on a mindless show, but Clone was sure she wasn't really paying attention to the screen. Knowing her determination and hate for the Batman, she was planning how to take him down. \"I'm going to shower,\" Clone informed when he finished his breakfast. He dumped his bowl in the sink, making his way to the bathroom. Daire made no response, and Clone wasn't sure if she heard him- she had the dreadful habit of tuning out the world- but he knew better than to bother Daire in the mood she was in. He hadn't done it before, but he had seen what happened to the poor soul who did. And that wrath was not something he wanted aimed at him. At least he knew why people at the temple called her \"Demon Spawn,\" a title so unlike the sweet, kind girl he first met. oOoOoOoOoOoOo Daire had heard of the clown before. As Batman's greatest foe, he was researched along with him. Well, a lot of Batman's main villains were studied. But the clown was at the top of the list. His laughter was annoying, it being the only sound as he took over the broadcasting services. \"Hello, ladies and gentlemen! It is I, your dear friend Joker.\" \"And I'm Harley!\" an upbeat girl caked in makeup popped in. Joker pushed her out of the shot, annoyed. \"Yes. Anyways, don't bother changing-\" Daire didn't care for this. She just wanted to rest after the beating she took from the dynamic duo. The bump on her head was very tender, though she hid it well. She returned to the last channel she had watched. \"- because I'm on all of them!\" Daire glared at the clown, flipping through a few more. He wasn't wrong. He was on every channel. \"Now, we're gonna play a little game. Oh, doesn't that sound fun?\" \"It sure does, puddin',\" Harley answered from off screen. \"Harley, we talked about this,\" he growled, his eyes looking away from the camera. \"Right. Sorry, puddin'.\" He was quick to return to his cheery self. \"But what game are we playing? A little game I like to call, 'Can Batsy save them all?' The rules: every thirty minutes, a contestant will be exposed to my intoxicating Joker Gas.\" The screen flickered to different hostages in chains in various places. \"At the same time, a bomb will blow up somewhere in the city.\" A clip of an explosion played. Then Joker returned, leaning close to the lense. \"Sound like a blast, eh?\" He erupted in a fit of laughter. \"Now, Batsy, you have have a choice. Prevent someone from having the funniest day of their life or stop a bomb. I have seven of each.\" \"Uh, each of what, boss?\" a deep voice behind camera asked. Daire heard the shower shut off. Clone would be getting out soon. Good. It looked like they were going to have a busy day. Joker sighed. Daire didn't blame him. The answer was obvious. Still, Daire listened intently to his grumbled response. \"Contestants and bombs. I have seven contestants and seven bombs spread throughout the city.\" He quickly perked back up. \"Can you and your little Boy Wonder do it, Batsy? Oh! Before I forget, the bombs or people- whichever you choose to save, or defuse- must be done so in order. If not, they will all go off at once, and no one will be safe. What order? Now where's the fun in telling you that? He he he he he!\" Daire gritted her teeth, reaching for her katana. Once again, he leaned close to the lense. \"Every thirty minutes, Batsy. Can you do it?\" The camera shut off in the middle of his laughter. The scheduled show played as it should have all along, but Daire shut it off. She got to her feet as the bathroom door opened. Clone walked out, a towel over his sopping hair and pants hanging snugly on his waist. He didn't bother wearing a shirt. Clone instantly sensed the mood. \"What's-?\" \"Get dressed. We leave in three. I'll explain on the way.\" Without another word, Clone did as told. Daire put her gear on as well, contacting the other League members in Gotham. To keep a low profile, they where spread over six safe houses throughout the city. She demanded a meet up and told the reason. The teams were ready to help until one contacted Talia. Talia denied the Leaguers from helping. They were supposed to be killing Batman, not helping him. But Daire wasn't going to sit on the sidelines and watch innocent people die. It wasn't the way of the League, and it wasn't the way she did things. Clone stepped out of his room, ready. Without a glance, Daire walked briskly to the door. \"Let's go.\" She pulled on her mask, her katana at her waist. oOoOoOoOoOoOo \"You expect us to trust you?\" a snide voice questioned. Clone narrowed his eyes. \"I expect you to save lives, but as of right now, you can't do that alone. You'll need our help.\" \"Our?\" \"My protege will be here any minute.\" Robin went to protest, but Batman stopped him. In his deep voice, he asked, \"How do we know you're on our side?\" \"You don't.\" A slender figure landed on the outskirts of the roof, gliding to Clone's side. The duo didn't comment, but Daire felt their glares. They recognized her. \"Did you find the first set?\" Clone asked. She shook her head and murmured, \"No, but I think I found the fifth. Either way, it's not far from the end. I told the hostage to stay calm.\" \"Did it work?\" \"No.\" Batman cleared his throat, unable to hear the hushed conversation over the distance. \"She found a set- a hostage and a bomb- and believes it to be the fifth one.\" \"She?\" \"My assistant , Thorne.\" \"How?\" \"The signals are synced. Thorne discovered the band width Joker is using can reach a set distance. Each hostage and bomb can be no more than five hundred meters apart.\" Batman nodded, and Robin asked him something, in disbelief. Batman responded, his voice silent in the wind. Batman's orders were bold, commanding. \"Robin, you and Thorne find the third set.\" \"What about you?\" \"I'll go with Vidar to the second set.\" \"What about the first?\" Clone, going by Vidar, questioned. \"Already taken care of.\" No more explanation was given. \"No, thanks.\" Batman hummed. \"Excuse me?\" Clone repeated, \"No, thanks. Thorne is staying by my side. We'll go after the third set. Remember the frequency I gave you?\" He earned a nod. \"Good, we'll be on that. Contact us when it's time to take care of the third set.\" \"No killing,\" Batman ordered, nodding at Daire's katana. \"We don't kill the innocent. It's why we're here.\" \"No killing,\" he repeated. Clone eyed Daire, and she gave a slight nod. Though they chose to hide it, she was technically the boss. If she said to go along with it, he would. \"Fine.\" oOoOoOoOoOoOo A dozen or so of Joker's goons guarded every bomb and every hostage. But they were easy to disarm. Daire had grown so use to killing again, that she found avoiding it a nuisance, which frightened her. What had she become? What was she becoming? But these were horrible people. They were willing to kill others. And those who kill should be prepared to be killed. Clone found the no kill rule more of a suggestion. He didn't think much about taking her sword and plunging it through the chest of one make up caked man. Daire called him out, her tone scornful, but she didn't tell him to stop. The went on, freeing the hostages and disabling the bombs. When Batman gave them the clear, they'd simultaneously take their set down, signaling their success back to the Bat. The seventh set, however, was no where to be found. They all split up, each masked figure searching their section of the city. But no such luck. Batman and Clone rattled theories and idea. Sometimes Robin joined. Daire kept silent, purposely only speaking to Clone. She used the second line they had up, using Clone as a messenger. \" Found the hostage, \" Batman reported, giving the address. \" Search for the bomb! \" Daire was on the edge of her district, bordering Batman's. It didn't take long to make her way there, and only took an additional five minutes to find the bomb. Still, they were running out of time. Every time they disarmed a set, it started the next set. They had wasted fifteen minutes just finding the hostage. Daire didn't bother to glance at her watch. She clicked her com twice, signaling she found the bomb. At the same time, Robin swung in. He was reporting to Batman, but wasn't close enough for her to hear him. When he landed, he passed her an unimpressed glance \" Good. Report back when you're ready, \" Batman ordered. Without a word, Daire popped the panel of the bomb off, offering Robin the chance to disarm it. He gave a stubborn nod and went to work. The bombs had been wired the same, so he didn't have to waste time figuring out which wire to cut. Blade in hand, leaning against the wire, he said, \" Ready .\" \" Good. Three. Two. One! \" A quick flick of the wrist and the bomb was deactivated, Robin stood up straight, brushing imaginary dust off his gloves. He passed Daire a stern look. \"Tt.\" Suddenly, a slow clapping echoed through the warehouse.[Chapter 9] ~ The Trap ~ Suddenly, a slow clapping echoed through the warehouse. Daire and Robin spun on their heels to face the clapper. The once dark screen switched on, lighting the dim room. The young bodies tensed, surprised. Neither were used to being snuck up on, and both silently scolded themselves for not paying attention to their surroundings. They had been taught better than that. Daire narrowed her masked eyes. How shamed would her grandfather be, if life still be upon him? How disappointed would her mother be? How pitiful would she look in her brother's eyes, if life still graced him? Robin balled his hands into tight fists. Even his father, as kind and forgiving he tended to be, would be disappointed. And his sister, wherever she was, what would she say? During training, she'd giggle and console him: it's okay to make mistakes. But this was a mission: pay attention, stay alert, never let your guard down. He didn't dare dwell on the punishment his mother and grandfather would have given him, should they have seen his foolish mistake. \"Hello, kiddies!\" the mad man greeted. He smiled brightly for the camera, looking straight at them. Or, more accurately, straight into the camera. A few dozen of his men appeared, each easily two to three times bigger than one of the small bodies. In sync, the young duo readied for the fight that was sure to come. Both of the skilled warriors were sure they'd win; the grown men before them were sure they'd win, but didn't make a move. They hadn't received the order yet, and you'd have to be a fool with a death wish to upset Joker. But Joker tisked from the screen, waving his finger. \"Now, now, we wouldn't want the game to end early, would we?\" He paused, as if expecting a reaction from the two. Maybe he hoped for some form of agreement, though he knew they wouldn't deliver. \"Did Batsy take on another sidekick?\" Hopefully this one would be more fun than the current Robin. The current Robin was a lot like his mentor: boring and rigid. He didn't smile like the past Robins, didn't shout with joy swinging between buildings, or beam after winning a fight. Boring! Neither child answered, something that took Joker longer than necessary to realize. Hmm, maybe this was a bad time to let his thoughts run wild. Oh well! It wasn't like he was sane. Besides, he always did have the best conversations with himself, always did come up with the best, most disturbing, chaotic plans by himself. And there he was, his thoughts running wild again. \"Nothing? No \"where's Batsy?\" No \"oh, Joker, what are you going to do to us?\" \" Despite raising the pitch of his voice to sound more feminine, the young duo didn't react. This was another thing about the new Robin he despised: he was no fun. He couldn't take a joke to save his life. At least Batman would sometimes come up with a witty- dare he say funny- response. But this Robin? Nothing. He sighed, a little irritated. Looks like this new sidekick was as boring as Robin. \"Another grumpy pants, eh? Whatever. I've got Batsy and some other hero- guy locked up somewhere.\" Both of the children made a mental remark on the new guy's status- not good/ a criminal- but let Joker continue. \"I'll give you- let say- two hours before I dose them in Joker Gas! And this is a new formula-\" he leaned forward as if to tell a secret, though there was too much distance to be able to whisper, \"-so no antidote, bird brat and whatever you are.\" He paused. \"Eh, so what is your name?\" He was answered with silence. He appeared disgruntled with the- or rather lack of a- response, but shrugged nonchalantly. He could always ask Batman. He turned, looking off camera. \"Hey, Batsy! Who's the new kid?\" When there was no answer, Joker lifted a remote and pressed the big red button. Electricity could be heard, along with a blend of two masculine grunts of pain. The person handling the camera turned it, showing both men chained up. Ankles and wrists trapped in metal cuffs, metal domes surrounding their hands and feet. Batman's tricked gloves wouldn't be able to save him this time. \"Thorne!\" Robin shouted, and the zapping stopped. Both men panted, and the camera turned back to Joker. \"Thorne? Hmm, kind of dull don't ya think? Oh well. Well, bird boy and rose girl- you are a girl, right?\" He received two nods. \"Good- well, as I said before, you have two hours to find Batsy and random hero- guy before I make them just like me!\" He spiraled off into a fit of laughter, holding his stomach after running out of air. Still, he kept laughing. It was well over a minute before he paused, glaring at the people behind the camera. \"Laugh.\" And obviously forced laughter erupted. Even the men with Robin and Daire obeyed, sending Joker into another laughing spell. \"Oh,\" he added, as if he had forgotten, \"and you have one hour to find the Nightwing before he goes drop!\" The screen split, showing Harley and Nightwing, who was hanging by his ankles above a cauldron of bubbling green acid. Daire frowned, what kind of acid was that? Seriously, it seemed only Joker used such a vibrant colored acid. Man, Batman had the weirdest villains. For a reason other than Batman's planned assassination, Daire was glad she wasn't part of the infamous dynamic duo. \"Nightwing!\" Batman called. Robin perked at the sound of his mentor. \"Yes, that's what you get for cheating, Batman!\" He turned, as if he could actually see Harley across the screens. \"How ya doin' there, Harls?\" Maybe he had a screen with the same image of Harley wherever he was. \"Doin' good, Mistah J!\" she reported. \"Got him all tied up and ready!\" \"Good, very good.\" Harley and Nightwing's camera shut off, and Joker filled the screen again. \"So, kid duo, who are you going to save? Batman or Nightwing?\" \"Robin! Save Nightwing!\" Batman ordered. Joker turned to someone. \"Shut him up, will ya?\" And some shuffling was heard behind the camera. Without someone keeping it steady, the camera tilted, showing them the bland cement floor. Joker stepped forward, arms reaching out to angle it back at him. \"Nightwing is far enough away from us. Over an hour's drive, even by Batman's standards,\" he ended up grumbling, giving a nasty eye to the Bat off screen. \"You can either save Batman (and random hero-guy) or Nightwing. Who's it gonna be, kiddies?\" Mid laugh, the camera cut off, leaving the screen black. It flickered back on- \"Oh, men, get them-\" and back off again. Daire sighed; Robin tutted. They simultaneously dashed forward, gifting their enemies with a series of skilled punch and kicks. Despite being outsized and outnumbered, the two petite beings had fought worse, more trained opponents. They quickly neutralized the threat. They stood a foot apart, looking around in satisfaction. A man between them groaned, pushing himself up. His movements were groggy, but neither hesitated to kick the side of the head closest to him. The man fell back down, unconscious once again. \"Not bad,\" they seemed to silently compliment the other. But for whatever reason, the two didn't feel the need to speak. It was as if they were telepathically linked on some level. They didn't need words to communicate. Without words, Robin motioned for Daire to follow him. They made their way to the roof, hopping across rooftops until Robin slid down a fire escape. Daire followed, cautiously. They walked up to the warehouse door, Daire wondering what they were doing here. Everything in the area seemed run down, rusted, and there was a foul smell a few buildings over. \"What are we doing here?\" she asked, disguising her voice some. \"Tt,\" Robin tutted, punching the key to open the locked metal door. The warehouse looked much nicer on the inside. Rows of bright florescent lights flickered on, showing the place for what is was: a safe house. The question answered, the youngsters remained silent, not needing to speak. They simply made eyes contact and nodded. They didn't need words. Simultaneously, they loaded themselves with weapons. Daire made her way to the gun rack, which seemed useless to have since Batman refused to use such a tool. She reached for a small gun, ready to use it to save Clone. He was her brother, even though he was a clone. Daire wasn't about to lose another brother. Suddenly, a bat-a-rang whisped by her hand, making her jerk back. Batman was strictly against killing, it was only logical he fed the same morals to his protege. Still, Daire found it slightly annoying. She turned to glare at Robin who tossed her a utility belt. It was small, needed to be adjust some, and was definitely one of Robin's, but it would do. And this was not her, she knew. She used to be like Batman. She disliked killing, and would go out of her way to avoid if she could. And though she eventually gave in, she always protested murder enough to get punishment after punishment. And here she was. Wanting to kill. She was the one being stopped. She felt like a stranger in her own skin. She was being the same monster she had run from in the first place. Sure, she was being the perfect daughter, perfect grandchild, even the perfect big sister- but at what cost? Was revenge really worth her soul? Her baby brother was dead- there's nothing she could do to fix that. His body was mutilated like their grandfather's, destroyed past even the pit's ability to revive. But she was alive. She was still here. While having different views of their upbringing, Damian adored Daire, flaws and all. Would he want this? Would he want Daire to follow in their mother's and grandfather's footsteps? Would he want her to seek revenge? To spill blood on his behalf? Daire shook her head, sneaking a gun when Robin wasn't looking. How many times had she fought this internal battle? How many times would her thoughts race before calming? She knew the answer to all of her questions. It was silly to doubt herself, her mother, and especially her brother. What was she thinking? Of course Damian would want this. As much as he adored Daire, he idolized their grandfather and mother. He spent every free second striving to please them, to be the king he was bred to be. Daire didn't think he necessary enjoyed killing (maybe the praise he got from it, but not the action itself), but didn't despise it the way she did. The boy she loved had absolutely no quarrels with murder. He wasn't one to hesitate, unlike herself, and would kill without a second thought. Yes. Damian would want this. He would want her to avenge him, to take his place, to carry on his legacy. And she would honor him. She would honor the one person who loved her unconditionally. Even after death, Daire would do anything for Damian. They finished collecting everything they deemed necessary, Robin lead them to the vehicles. With a smirk, Robin took the keys to the Batmobile and hopped in. Daire had a feeling Batman wouldn't be pleased with this, but that would teach him for being careless. Maybe next time he wouldn't let himself get captured. Besides, this was Robin's terf. She wasn't going to tell him how to deal with Joker. Batman and Robin knew each other, their villains, and their city. Daire had enough trust in Robin to do everything in his power to save Batman, Nightwing and Clone along with. oOoOoOoOoOoOo An obvious first, they made their way to the chemical warehouse where Robin thought Nightwing was being kept. They settled into a comfortable silence, Robin behind the wheel. Robin seemed comfortable enough driving, and he was decent at it. From the pictures of wrecks Daire had seen, in her opinion, he was better than Batman. The people of Gotham automatically made way for the speeding Batmobile, parting as if it were an emergency vehicle. It loud engine could be heard down the block, and people just knew when to stop (even at a green light) to let Robin speed past. It was uncanny. Daire had never seen anything like it. The city was so in sync. It kind of unnerved her. But, with the way traffic parted for them, they were making great time. Daire couldn't deny that.[Chapter 10] ~ The Rescue ~ \"This is your fault,\" he accused, voice muffled by the face mask. \"Is not!\" Daire denied, kicking him in the leg. \"It's yours.\" The kick was returned. \"No, it's not!\" \"Is too!\" \"Is not!\" \"Is too!\" \"Is not!\" \"Is-!\" \"Would you two lovebirds shut up?\" an annoyed Nightwing complained. \"We're not lovebirds!\" the young duo shouted simultaneously, ceasing their exchange of petty kicks. They glared at each other, daring the other to say something else. \"Look, we need to find a way out of this,\" Nightwing reasoned. \"Any ideas?\" Robin was the first to relent. He ended the staring contest to squirm his hand around his utility belt, bumping into Daire. \"Stay on your side!\" \"I am!\" \"No, you're not! You came on my side!\" \"No, I didn't.\" \"Yes, you did!\" \"No, I didn't.\" \"Did too!\" \"Did not!\" \"Did too!\" \"Did not!\" Seeing the wooden crate shake uneasily beside him, Nightwing sighed. If he didn't know any better, he'd swear these two were siblings. Grunts, shouts, and thus could be heard, all coming from the swinging box. And of all the times he wished Robin would act more his age, why did his childish side come out now? Now of all bloody times? \"Guys,\" he tried. The fighting and arguing continued. \"Guys!\" And they still did not stop. \"GUYS!\" Finally. \"You can settle your lovers quarrel later. Right now-\" \"We're not lovers!\" \"-we need to focus on getting out of this trap before we become human smoothies.\" He really didn't have a better phrase for what the acid would do to them. They really needed to get out of here. . . Batman could handle himself, but he did sometimes need help. And if he wasn't here yet, he's probably still trapped and they are his only hope. Yeah, with the two bickering children, he had a bad feeling about this. Why hadn't he paid more attention in the fight with Harley? If had noticed the goons sneaking up behind him, he wouldn't be in this mess. He thought it was just Harley, so he didn't focus on his surroundings as much as he should have. \"Yeah, that doesn't sound gusting.\" \"What?\" Robin's muffled voice questioned. \"Gusting,\" the muffled, feminine voice repeated. \"The opposite of disgusting. As in, good. Meaning: we wouldn't taste good, ばか (baka) (Idiot)!\" Robin scoffed, trying to play cool at the reminder of someone he missed dearly. Nightwing raised an eyebrow, remembering his days of butchering the English language. Not afraid of Robin, tried to save him, and points out flaws in English: if she were fifteen or so years older, she'd be just his type. \"Now that we've decided we wouldn't be a delicious treat,\" Nightwing joked, \"how about some ideas on getting us out of here?\" \"You fucking idiot! Don't do that!\" he heard the girl shout. What was an obvious slap echoed out of the box, and Robin's distinctive growl rumbled. \"It'll get us out of here.\" \"It'll get us dead!\" \"What's going on?\" Nightwing questioned, but he was ignored. \"You're going to blow us up,\" the girl complained. Well, there was his answer. \"I know what I'm doing.\" He wasn't serious, right? \"Yeah, I know what you're doing, too: blowing us up!\" \"Shut up.\" \"Make me.\" \"Tt, keep talking and I will.\" \"Yeah, right. I'd like to see you try.\" \"I wouldn't try; I would succeed.\" \"Says you.\" The chains holding them above the acid dropped a foot lower, jerking all of them around. Another kick. \"Ouch! That wasn't me, dipshit!\" The kick was returned. \"It was an accident,\" Robin defended. \"Yeah, a happy one, I bet.\" Nightwing could hear the smirk through the box and gas mask. \"You wouldn't be wrong.\" He sighed at the sound of another kick. \"Tt.\" \"Come on, guys,\" Nightwing complained. \"I have an idea.\" \"Is it a good one?\" Robin asked, doubtful. \"I have an idea. And yes, I'm sure that just fills you with the utmost confidence in me.\" Honestly, her sarcasm was a welcome to Robin's barren humor. But it wasn't helping them get out of this mess. Nightwing let out a little yell as they lowered closer to the acid. \"Um, I'm all ears.\" Being upside down, it wasn't difficult to crane his head to stare dead ahead at the bubbling acid. He knew the two youngsters couldn't see (they had been dumb enough to get trapped in their little wooden box and had no way of knowing how close they were to death). \"Move over.\" \"Tt, where?\" Shuffling could be heard, accompanied with a few insults and more kicks. \"When did you free your hands?\" Robin exclaimed. There was a pause before the answer came. \"Within ten minutes of getting trapped in this thing.\" \"And you didn't-?\" \"I slapped you six minutes ago. Did it not occur to you then that my hands were free?\" A moment of silence. \"Tt, shut up.\" Oh, Red Hood was going to love this. Nightwing couldn't help his growing smirk. For the \"perfect\" blood son, the kid finally made a mistake. The chains lowered again, cutting off anymore distractions. It didn't take long for Robin and the girl to get out of the box. Together, they had kicked a side out. The side dropped into the acid, splashing some it up towards Nightwing. He cringed, trying to get away. Luckily, none hit him. \"Guys, can we be a little more careful?\" \"Tt, you're one to talk, Grayson.\" And if looks could kill, Robin would be in the bubbling acid, never to be seen again. But if the girl had caught on to the slip, she didn't comment or act upon it. But through their gas masks, it was hard to tell. They climbed on the box reaching over for Nightwing. They unlocked his chains and used grappling hooks to get on the ground, to safety. It had taken longer than Nightwing would have liked to get free, but they finally did. They made their way outside, and Nightwing went over a quick plan on what to do next. Get to their transportation, go to Batman, save him, capture Joker. Not very elaborate or original, but it would have to do. \"So, where did you park.\" \"The alley beside you.\" \"Which direction?\" Nightwing asked, mostly to himself as his brain searched for the answer. \"North,\" they said in unison but pointed in slightly different directions. Both were wrong. Not completely, but still wrong. \"That way is north. No, this way!\" They continued bickering, raising their voices to be heard over the other. \"Yelling doesn't make either of you right,\" Nightwing pointed out. \"It makes me not have to hear him be wrong,\" the girl immediately retorted, and Nightwing could stop the snicker. These two. . . Under different circumstances, he would be enjoying this, but now was not the time and this was not the place and they were in a rush and couldn't they get along to two freaking seconds? \"I'm not wrong. You're wrong.\" \"You're both wrong,\" Nightwing cut in before another fight could start. Robin had pointed northwest while the girl pointed northeast. Nightwing walked in between the two, showing them their mistake. \"Mine was closer,\" Robin muttered under his breath, just loud enough for Nightwing and Thorne to hear. Nightwing sighed. This was going to be a long hour. Well, it was going feel like an incredibly long hour. \"No, mine was.\" \"No, it wasn't.\" \"Yes, it was.\" \"No, it-\" \"You were both wrong; I was right. Suck it up; shut up!\" Nightwing finally bellowed. His usual go-lucky manner was a complete contrast to this, and the two bickering brats quickly obeyed. He lead the way to where they knew Batman and Thorne's mentor was at. He heard the occasional shuffle, whispered insult, and pointed cough, but the two were otherwise quiet. He couldn't be more thankful. At least for these few minutes, he could get some quiet. Not peace or silence, but quiet. He found his cycle and hopped on. Robin and Thorne took off to the next alley, saying they were parked there. And Nightwing groaned when he say which vehicle they drove. \"Batman's going to kill me.\" oOoOoOoOoOoOo Despite his protests, Nightwing drove his cycle to Batman's coordinates, leaving Robin and Daire in the Batmobile. Daire was smiling smugly from the driver's seat. When it came out that she was older and had been driving longer than Robin, Nightwing ordered Robin to stand down and let her take the wheel. \"I could've drove,\" he complained. \"After that stunt you pulled earlier? You're lucky you're even in this car.\" Robin rolled his eyes but didn't ask for clarification. \"You're overreacting.\" Daire glanced at the passenger side mirror. Or- more appropriately- where it should be. In his rush to get to Nightwing, Robin had driven them down an alley, through a fence, through a randomly placed stack of cardboard boxes, and up a ramp, over a pickup truck, and over the street. The alley on the other side of the street was large enough to fit the car, but Robin had been off a bit. The passenger side of the car had scraped against the wall. \"Oops,\" was all he had said. \"I'm pretty sure I'm not.\" The drive didn't take long. \"It would've been quicker if I drove,\" Robin pointed out when they jumped out. \"A quicker trip to heaven, yeah.\" In a hushed but clearly audible voice, Nightwing shushed them. \"Stop fighting. We have to save Batman. And your mentor.\" \"Vidar,\" Robin supplied. \"Okay, Vidar. We have to work together and be quiet.\" For emphasis, he put his finger to his lips. He received silent nods. \"Good. Now take of the gas masks and follow me.\" Robin and Thorne blinked, pulling off their masks as if they had forgotten they were there. Thorne handed hers to Robin, who tucked them into his utility belt. They refused to even glance at each other. But they were silent. They made their way inside, sneaking around Joker and his men. Robin had wanted to dive right in but was stopped. Nightwing insisted on finding Batman and Vidar before revealing themselves. He preferred to slip in, free them, and slip out without being noticed. But when do things go according to plan? Especially with the Batclan? It wasn't long before they were discovered and fighting. \"Robin, free Batman and Vidar! We've got this!\" Nightwing ordered at the start of the fight. Robin was not pleased at missing a fight but went along. A few guys tried to stop them, but they were weak and untrained. They were easy to take down. Sometimes Robin wished for a more challenging fight. He missed sparing with someone equal or close to his skill set. He eventually reached the control panel that controlled Batman's and Vidar's trap. He pushed a few buttons, getting a feel for the machine. When he found out a code was needed to unlock them, he settled for smashing it. He opened the side panel, slipped in a small bomb, and back off. The control panel blew up, but the chains didn't unlock. Well, that didn't work. \"Robin!\" Batman shouted. It was enough time to alert him. He dodged the coward attacking from behind, quickly darting forward to gift him a series of powerful punches. With every battle cry he let out, his opponent let out grunts and gasps of pain as he stumbled back. \"Tt, too easy,\" he said to himself. He made his way to the actual trap, pulling out the lock picking tools Batman made him carry. It was a skill his mother had taught him when he was three, so it didn't take long. \"Good job,\" Batman complimented, something he was still getting used to. \"Free Vidar.\" Batman ran off to join the fight, leaving Robin. He huffed in annoyance but complied. The last thing he wanted was to get grounded again. Within thirty seconds, Vidar was also free. Finally, Robin could join the fight. oOoOoOoOoOoOo The fight hadn't lasted long. With the police on their way and Joker and his crew tied up, they made their way to a roof across the street. The remained silent until the flashing light appeared. \"Hey, thanks for the help,\" Nightwing beamed. He was just a bag of sunshine. Honestly, it reminded Daire of herself before he mother found her. She saw the bright side of everything and refused to let anything get her down. Until her baby brother was slain. At the thought, she turned to glare at Batman, nodded once, and spun on her heels, walking off without a word. \"Next time, Batman, she will kill you,\" Clone promised, following her at a slower pace. It was then Nightwing noticed, he hadn't heard the girl speak since she took off her mask.[Chapter 11] ~ The Time ~ \"What was that whole killing thing about?\" Nightwing questioned back at the cave. \"The kid is an assassin. Her mission is to kill me,\" Batman answered. He was going over what little he had on them, adding new information gained from the night's events. \"Do you know who hired them?\" \"No.\" \"Where they're from?\" \"No.\" \"Where they're staying?\" \"No.\" \"You mean you haven't followed them?\" \"I have. Every time I try, they lose me.\" \"You mean you lose them,\" Nightwing corrected, a smug grin plastered across his face. Whoever this girl was, he was liking her more and more. \"They are very skilled, especially the kid.\" And it hit him. A kid. The girl was just a kid. Robin's age. She was what Robin once was, who he could still be if he hadn't been handed to Batman. \"What are we going to do to help her?\" \"Help her? She's a killer, Nightwing.\" \"Technically, so is your kid.\" \"He doesn't kill.\" \"Anymore,\" scoffed Nightwing. \"He doesn't kill.\" Batman really didn't want to have this conversation. Couldn't Nightwing just go away? He could go bother Robin for all he cared. \"He lived with Talia and Ra's for ten years. You really think he's never killed before?\" \"Go away, Dick.\" Though he couldn't see it, he knew his past ward was rolling his eyes. \"So, I'll repeat, what are we going to do to help her?\" \"She's a criminal, Nightwing.\" \"She doesn't know any better! That's probably all she's ever known or she's being forced to! More than likely, both! And don't try telling me she's a criminal. Bruce Wayne helps rehabilitate criminals all the time!\" \"I don't think this is about the way she was raised or this being a hit. I think it's something else.\" Nightwing sighed when there was no elaboration and prodded for more. Luckily, Batman was in a talking mood. \"She only targets me. She uses nonlethal moves with Robin; she holds back. If it was a hit, Robin would be a target, too.\" \"Unless they wanted him alive,\" Nightwing pointed out. He shrugged when Batman stared at him. \"Robin has been a target before. Many people want the Boy Wonder.\" Batman didn't want to admit it, but Nightwing had a point. oOoOoOoOoOoOo \"Ugh!\" Daire sighed, pacing in their safe house. \"That Robin kid is so annoying!\" Clone glanced up from cleaning his knifes but didn't say anything. \"I mean, he's such a narcissistic brat! He thinks he knows everything, and does his own thing, regardless of the consequences!\" \"Um,\" Clone frowned. While Daire wasn't a brat, nor entirely narcissistic, she had a decent ego. The mission they had finished was a direct violation of what they had been told to do, and they were both surely to be punished for the insubordination. Daire continued, \"And he has a smart little mouth that makes people want to punch it!\" Daire was known for her sharp tongue at times. Clone had seen Daire's snide comments get her into messes and fights (she always won, but that's beside the point). \"He thinks just because he's Batman's sidekick, it automatically puts him above everyone else!\" At this point, Clone wasn't sure if Daire was talking about Robin, herself, or both. While it was uncommon, Clone could name multiple occasions where Daire used her family name to get what she wanted. The commands weren't of any extreme, but she had been known to point out her \"birth rights\" put her above others. It wasn't something she hadn't started doing until she started killing. Clone noticed that much. But in most cases Talia encouraged her to take control of others (with the exclusion of herself) and to repeatedly prove her rank and superior skills, so the habit wasn't going away. Her watched beeped, cutting off her rant. She sighed, going to the safe house laptop and starting up the video chat features. \"Mother,\" she greeted, as formal as ever. \"Daire, I heard about your little side project.\" Daire remained silent, waiting for her punishment. \"But I'll deal with that when you return. Right now, I need you and the clone to-\" \"Heretic.\" \"What?\" \"His name is Heretic,\" Daire repeated, the first time she used his newly chosen name. Talia glared. \"Whatever. I need you to check on one of the set of assassins. They have failed to check in. I'm sending you the coordinates now.\" She glanced down, pushing something Daire couldn't see. It took a few moments, but the message finally arrived. It was just a few cities over. Daire recognized the place. It was a mission she helped planned. \"I want you to kill them.\" Daire jerked her head up, shocked. \"What?\" \"Kill them,\" her mother repeated, no empathy in her tone. \"But they're our men.\" \"They've either failed or are not following orders. There's no place for failures or insubordination in the League. Kill them. Every last one of them.\" \"But we planned to get the Batman tonight,\" Clone- Heretic informed. \"I can handle him myself. You can go,\" Daire decided. Talia didn't seem to care. \"Just get the job done. I don't care who does it.\" Without a farewell, she ended the call. Heretic went straight to packing. Talia was already upset with them. Making her wait- even just a few hours- to start the newly assigned mission would not help their case. Daire went over plans for a robbery they had come across. She knew the perfect place to wait for the bat and his little bird. When the robbers were caught and the vigilantes guard was down, she'd strike. oOoOoOoOoOo The amateur thieves were late. They were also inebriated. Daire let out a frustrated sigh. They weren't even trying at this point. Who the hell pulls a heist while drunk? What could they possibly be thinking? It was clear the Batman wouldn't need to be here. The police could take care of these imbeciles on their own. Still, she waited. Maybe he'd come. And Robin did. His short silhouette bounced along the rooftops. He was quick and graceful, pausing and lifting his hand to his ear before going in. A com. He must have a com on him. And while Batman hadn't yet come, she knew a way to change that. Robin could easily handle the situation on his own. Going in would only annoy and antagonize him. So, naturally, that's exactly what Daire did. \"Tt, you're late.\" Robin hadn't even looked in her direction, taking one of the intoxicated men down with ease. She didn't respond. She had learned last time- near the end- that not responding quickly aggravated him. She would need his full attention. \"The silent treatment?\" he guessed, still receiving no response. He turned in a mid-air kick, finally glancing at her. She suddenly leapt over the boy, using his shoulder as leverage. He body swerved at the momentum, and her leg made contact with another robber's face. Robin, too stubborn and prideful to say his thanks, grunted it. In an bored silence, they tied the attempted criminals up and waited for the police. Robin always found this part boring, but maybe this wouldn't be so bad. While the girl irritated him like his so-called brothers, there was something about her that intrigued him. Something he couldn't name but knew was familiar. The flashing lights took his attention off the roof they had been waiting on. The police arrived quickly, to his satisfaction. When the inebriated men were dragged into the cop cars, Robin finally turned. \"You aren't-\" he paused his- forced- compliment, seeing he was alone. Alert, his eyes scanned his surroundings, his peripheral vision catching a quick jerk in the shadows of the building next to the store he was on. He could see Daire jumping onto the next roof, as she meant. She could hear Robin's quiet put quick footsteps follow her, landing rather heavily on the sturdy roof. She lead him further away, giving him time to contact Batman. She made sure to stay within eye sight, staying just close enough to keep his interest while being far enough away to have the advantage. She flipped off the roof, landing loudly on the rattling fire escape halfway down before jumping the rest of the way. The girl was being careless in her escape, leaving an easy trail for Robin to follow. He jumped the entire way, going into a roll at the end of the three story drop. \"Batman,\" she heard Robin report. \"Thorne has returned.\" He easily did a somersault over the six foot fence Daire flipped over. \"No, those idiots weren't even a warm up.\" A pause. \"Grandfather made sure I fought tougher, more skilled warriors when I was a toddler.\" He lost sight of Thorne looking up to see her at the top of a different fire escape. How had she climbed it so fast? Didn't matter. He grabbed a grappling hook from his utility belt, quickly catching up. \"I'm following her now. Yes. No. No, I can-. Fine.\" She lead him to an abandoned warehouse that turned out not to be as abandoned as the city believed. Crates lined the walls and created mini walls around the place. There was a big open area which could be seen from the small walkway along the walls of the second floor. Robin took action, roundhouse kicking her through a taped window. The window shattered, and Daire fell though. None of the shards pierced her skin, and she brushed the remaining shards off. Their fight wasn't quite, but there wasn't anyone around for their racket to bother. The children fought in the narrow space, using the rail and wall to bounce around in feeble attempts to gain the upper hand. Another of Robin's attacks hit its mark, knocking Daire down. He paused, standing smugly above her. She didn't hesitate to swing her leg, his legs forced out from under him. As he hit the ground, she grabbed his cape, forcing him back up and flipping him over the railing, onto the concrete first floor below. She jumped over the railing, landing beside him. She leaned forward, ready to end the fight. Then Batman showed up. He stopped her from knocking Robin unconscious, tackling her away. They rolled, giving her the chance to escape, a chance she took advantage of. She knew the match was no longer in her favor. She was losing. Outnumbered, overpowered, and out maneuvered. Robin was a ball of energy, which was no surprise for his age. And he did a good job taking over the fight. He stayed close, refusing to let Batman get a clear shot. While that worked in her favor, he was also close enough to strike, fast enough to do so repeatedly, and strong enough to do some damage. The guard on her forearms softened most of his blows, but the force behind his punches were starting to hurt. She blocked his next punch to the side, flipping him towards Batman, who had attempted to sneak up behind her. The boy only pushed the Dark Knight a couple steps back, but he reached out to soften the fall for his little bird. Daire turned around, trying to get away. The night was lost. She'd try again. But Batman stopped her. Batman knew how to be on overbearing opponent. He was definitely a worthy one. Daire had trouble keeping up with him and took many blows. Daire had managed to get the grappling hook wrapped around Batman's ankles, shooting the end to the ceiling. Batman was pulled away and left to- literally- hang around. But Daire knew that wouldn't keep him for long. Less than a minute. Her attention now on Robin, she dove forward, going into a roll when he dodged aside. She stretched out her leg, knocking his out from under him. He fell with a grunt, landing heavily on his forearms. Daire was first to rise to her feet, pointing her katana at Robin's neck. He glared at her, knowing when not to fight back. \"Surren-\" Daire started, but was cut off when a bat-a-rang batted her hand. She let out an embarrassing yelp from the surprise, dropping her katana. Robin hopped to his feet, ready. She felt pressure around her wrist and neck. His hand shifted as her feet left the floor, moving to her hip. A steadfast hand forced her up, rolling over Robin's shoulder. She landed flat on the ground, frozen in shock. Not of the impact. But of the move. Daire recognized it. It was a lover her grandfather taught her and her brother. The next set of moves would end her life, as the young assassins were taught. It was a move not even her mother knew. And the only other person (beside her grandfather and herself) who knew it was her beloved brother. But Robin just started it. Robin, who had the same skin tone and midnight hair as her brother. Before she could say anything, Robin was quickly pinning her to the cold concrete floor. Firmly against her neck- but not hard enough to cut skin- was a bat-a-rang. Could it be? Could it really be?[Chapter 12] ~ The Kill ~ Robin had pinned her down, a bat-a-rang to her throat. She gritted her teeth, feeling the blade dig into her soft flesh. A low hiss escaped her lips. \"Justice not vengeance. Justice not vengeance,\" a familiar voice chanted. The whites of his mask gone since his eyes were closed. \"Justice not vengeance.\" Could it be? Daire dared to wondered. Was it him? But that was not something her brother would say. Her determined little brother wouldn't hesitate to kill. Not like her. \"Justice not vengeance.\" He backed off, the bat-a-rang still in his hand. Batman stood behind him. \"Good job, Robin.\" \"Dami?\" the assassin whispered, catching the duo's attention. \"Is it really you?\" Robin froze, recognizing the gentleness of the voice. His mind raced, taking longer than he would have like to place the voice. It had been far too long since he'd seen her, heard her, felt her love. She was always so kind to him, so gentle. And what had he done? Betrayed her. Would she be happy to see him? Angry? Sad? Disappointed? Or maybe proud of the change in him. He had worked so hard to be like his Father for her. \"Dami? Please, is it really you.\" Without thinking, the girl tore her mask off, revealing deep green eyes. \"Dai? Sister?\" Robin murmured. After a moment of silence, the two crashed into each other, holding onto their sibling for dear life. \"It's really you!\" the assassin wept, squeezing the boy to her. \"I thought- I thought-\" the boy struggled for words. \"How are you alive?\" his sister questioned, scanning him for any injuries. She took off his mask, staring into his eyes. This confused the boy. \"Alive? Of course I'm alive.\" \"Mother told me the Batman killed you. She told me you were dead.\" He blinked. \"Sister, Father didn't kill me. Father would never-\" \"But Mother told me he helped Deathstroke kill Grandfather. When you went after them to honor him, Batman killed you.\" \"I don't kill,\" the bat himself stated. The girl ignored him, her hand cupping her brother's check. Having missed the warmth, the boy leaned into the loving touch. \"I missed you,\" he whispered, eyes closed. \"I've missed you, too, Dami.\" Once again, they hugged, clinging to the other. \"I thought you left,\" he murmured in her shoulder. \"I did, but Mother came to me. She said you asked her to find me, to give me a second chance. She said you wanted me to take your place as heir. She said to avenge you, I would have to kill the Batman.\" The boy shook his head, pulling back. \"Father didn't kill me. He's never hurt me. The ways of the League are wrong; Mother is wrong. You were right, Dai. You were right.\" Batman stood awkwardly to the side. He had never seen his son so emotional, so attached. He wondered who the girl was. She wasn't his, was she? She was slightly taller than Robin, but they were still children. Talia never mentioned Damian having a sister, let alone a twin. Were they twins? They looked alike, but they were siblings, so that didn't say much. Looking closer, he doubt she was his. Though she looked a lot like Damian, she had none of his features. Similar nose and cheekbones, sure, but not exact. They weren't Talia's either. She obviously inherited her mother's hair and had the same eyes as Damian. Stepping back, the two siblings clasped hands, the boy turning to face his father. \"Father,\" the boy started, back to his formal manner, \"this is my sister, Daire. Dai, this is my father.\" She nodded, \"I know all about the infamous Batman.\" Just to make sure. . . \"Who is your father?\" he asked. Both children's eyes hardened. They stiffened, and Batman knew the story behind that was a bad one. \"He's dead. I killed him,\" his son answered. Though he knew the boy had killed before, Batman still felt his muscles lock. \"Why?\" \"Because I wouldn't. I was weak,\" the girl answered, her voice a soft whisper. Damian's head snapped to his sister, instinctively consoling her. \"You are not weak, Dai. Vengeance is weak. It is easy, but that doesn't make it right.\" Though an inch or so shorter, he enveloped her into a hug. Batman felt a wave of pride flood at his son's words. He was doing good, teaching him well. And it was good to know the boy kept his father's words to heart. \"I should have killed him, though. Especially after what he did.\" Batman frowned. What did her father do? \"No, you are not a killer,\" Robin soothed, something Batman thought was impossible for the egotistical boy. \"Not letting revenge drive you, that's strong not weak.\" \"Revenge,\" the girl repeated, blinking herself to the present. Her eyes darted to Batman, who waited for an attack. She turned away. \"We need to go.\" \"What?\" Robin struggled against her hold, unwilling to leave. \"Hurry, Dami. I'm not alone. Soon the League will know I failed, that I didn't kill the Batman.\" Frowning, he yanked his arm away. \"I'm not going back.\" \"I didn't say we were going back. Mother has changed. She thinks only of power. Surely, she knew you were alive and Robin.\" He nodded, \"She left me with Father.\" \"So going back will get us both killed. Or worse. No, we're running.\" She took his arm again, pulling him to the exit. \"Running? From the League of Assassins?\" \"It'll be hard, but I know we can do it. We can do anything, Dami, as long as we're together. Remember?\" His eyes glazed over, his mind going back in time. \"But Father-\" He cut himself off, glancing at him. \"You know what fathers do.\" \"But he doesn't do that. He would never.\" \"Mine did it.\" \"And he was killed for his wrongdoings.\" \"Come on, Dami,\" she pleaded, seeing as he was resisting again. \"Please, I can't live without you. Not again. Not anymore. We can do it. Together. But we have to hurry.\" \"Dai, Father can protect us. He's beat Grandfather; he can beat Mother. And he won't ever do that to you.\" \"Do what? What did your father do to you, Dai?\" the man asked, setting his hand on his son's shoulder. He didn't miss the way the girl cringed away at his presence, dropping Robin's hand. \"Don't call her that!\" Robin scolded. \"Her name is Daire. Only I can call her Dai!\" He nodded. \"Daire. What did your father do to you?\" She wouldn't even meet his masked gaze. She slipped her mask back on. The thin fabric gave her confidence, her back straightening. She pushed her shoulders back but kept her gaze dead ahead. Knowing he wasn't going to get an answer, he let it drop. \"Come with us. I won't let Talia touch you or Robin.\" \"Please, Dai,\" Robin begged, putting his mask back on, too. From her silence, Batman was sure she was going to decline the offer. His mind listed everything he could do. He didn't want to resort to kidnapping, but neither did he want a child to be forced to kill. His own son had been so close to becoming Ra's Al Gaul. Then she whispered, \"Will you be there?\" Robin stepped forward, gently taking her hands. \"I'll always be with you. I won't leave you again.\" There was also the soft side of his son, the one he knew only she could bring out. His love for animals was promising, but this? This was gold. A genuine human connection. Someone who grew up with him, learned with him, laughed with him. She giggled. \"I think I was the one who left, Dami.\" Laughing. Was it horrible that he couldn't picture his own son laughing? His son was always so formal, strict, and blunt. He couldn't imagine his child smiling, playing, or even bonding with another. He couldn't imagine his child being normal. Robin shook his head. \"I left you. I didn't go with you.\" \"Grandfather would never have allowed it. You know that.\" Robin didn't respond to that. Instead, he led her towards the Batmobile. \"Father will protect us. I will protect you. You don't have to worry. Father can even get adoption papers for you like he did for me. Though I don't know why he needed them; I am his blood son.\" Batman ignored that jab, following the kids. \"Sweet ride! Are you driving, Dami?\" Robin opened his mouth to speak, but he was cut off. \"No.\" \"He knows how.\" Yup. They are definitely related. \"No.\" \"He never lets anyone drive,\" Robin said. \"And call me Robin.\" She frowned but nodded. The two skinny children squeezed into the passenger seat easily. Batman half hoped he'd hear the chatter like Dick had with Barbara (those two could talk for hours) but the ride was as eerily silent as always. From the corner of his eyes, though, he did see their hands entwined. They held onto the other like it would keep them from disappearing. Neither Batman nor Bruce Wayne knew what it was like to have a sibling. His adopted kids kind of did; they treated each other like brothers from what he could tell. They annoyed, teased, and pranked the crap out of each other. But, his son had a sister. Not a full blooded sister, but a sister nonetheless. For someone who was so technical about blood relatives, he wondered how Damian treated his sister. From what he had seen so far, the boy really cared for her. On the way home, the bat signal lit the night sky. Batman made a quick detour, heading towards the police station. oOoOoOoOoOoOo Gordon was surprised. He usually waited quite a while before the Dark Knight showed up. He was also surprised at the newcomer. \"Another one? Don't you stick to one at a time?\" he couldn't help but ask. Though the sidekicks did a lot to help Gotham, Gordon hated the idea of putting kids in danger. Those kids fought the worst Gotham had to offer. They fought people who he, himself, feared ever facing. How did a child go through with that? Every Robin has disappeared before, kidnapped by some madman (especially the Joker). He knew Batman didn't rest until Robin was safe, but there was always a time lapse. What horrors did those children go through? What nightmares haunted them at night? But Gordon also knew every Robin, every partner/ sidekick was out there of his/ her own free will. No matter what happened, no matter how many times they got injured or kidnapped or tortured, they got back up. They continued fighting. Gordon had seen times when Batman was without a partner. One time when he asked about the bird's absence, he got the answer, \"Robin is grounded.\" What for? There was no answer to that. But if being off the streets is a punishment for these kids, they would be out there regardless of Batman. At least they had someone watching over them, protecting them, caring for them. What kind of parents let their kids fight crime? Who wouldn't notice their kid sneaking out most nights? How could a parent be so ignorant? Gordon had long since come to the conclusion that (though Batman and Robin were close) that they weren't father and son. They sure did act like it many times, but no one had that many kids. Well, Bruce Wayne came close, but no way that rich playboy could be Batman. Just the thought was crazy. \"What do you need?\" the gruff voice asked. \"Two Face escaped. We're trying to keep it away from the media, but I'm not sure how long that will last.\" \"Anything else?\" He turned to look at the door. \"No, that's it. If you can-\" he turned back. \"And they're gone. Of course.\" He shut off the light, ready for his shift to end. Then he could go home. His daughter was visiting for the weekend. She might be up studying for some college test, but maybe he'd convince her to spend some time with her old man.[Chapter 13] ~ The Manor ~ Upon arriving at the Batcave, the trio exited the car. Daire looked around, much like Damian had. \"So this is the fabled Batcave. Grandfather told us all about it.\" She took a few more seconds to take it all in. \"It's smaller than I expected.\" Batman sighed. This girl was so much like his son. He didn't want to go through this process again. He just finished with Damian. \"Another one, sir?\" a formal voice called from the staircase. \"This is my sister, Pennyworth,\" Damian introduced. The butler raised a curious eyebrow. \"Sister?\" \"Not mine,\" the Dark Knight added. \"So half-sister?\" \"Technically, yes, but we don't use the 'half' part.\" \"For someone who's a stickler about being 'the blood son' I'm surprised you don't pin that detail down,\" another voice said. \"Shut it, Grayson.\" Dick, in his Nightwing outfit, walked up to the duo. The girl cringed back, hiding behind Damian. Dick frowned but stopped. \"Hi, I'm Dick, also known as Nightwing.\" \"She doesn't talk to men she's unfamiliar with,\" Damian informed, standing proudly in front of the timid girl. Though his mother and grandfather hated the way she cringed, he felt a surge of pride protecting his sister. He was brave and strong enough to protect them both. Of course, Daire could protect herself. She just tried not to resort to violence. \"Just men?\" Batman questioned, his cowl still covering his face. \"Adult men,\" the boy clarified. \"Why is that?\" Dick inquired. Batman thought over his time with the girl, and he realized his son was right. She never once said a word to him before that night. She either ignored, fought, or cringed away from him. And when she had spoken, it was timid and soft. \"Dami!\" the girl hushed, horrified as Damian started to answer. \"Don't.\" \"Father is going to find out. He knows everything.\" \"He didn't know about you for ten years,\" the girl pointed out. \"Besides, this is my past. I don't want people to know. If people know, they might make it happen again.\" \"Father isn't like that-\" Damian tried. \"Mine was.\" What happened to this girl? Batman was already forming theories, theories that didn't make him happy. How could Talia let that happen to her own daughter? I mean, she is a cold, heartless bitch, but still. Her own child? How could any mother let that happen to their child? And Damian? With how protective he was over the girl, he couldn't imagine Damian knowing about it and not stopping it. But, if his theory was correct, it would help explain Damian's protective nature with other children. \"Mine isn't. They won't,\" the boy insisted. Batman shook his head. There was a chance he was wrong. For once, he hoped he was wrong. \"I'll kill anyone who tries.\" \"Damian!\" \"I mean it.\" Bruce wanted to protest further, but if his theory was correct, he'd have a hard time not killing the offender, too. He let the subject drop. \"Alfred, please settle Daire in the room next to Damian's.\" \"Alone?\" the girl squeaked. \"In a room? My own room?\" \"I'll be in the next room,\" the youngest soothed. \"And the doors have locks. You'll be safe. I won't let anyone hurt you again.\" Both Dick and Alfred were surprised at Damian's unusual soft tone. He wasn't as gentle as a normal person, but there was emotion they hadn't thought the little devil was capable of. A type of bond they believed Talia forbid. \"Yes, Master Bruce. This way, please.\" He walked dutifully up the stairs. Daire didn't follow until Damian made the first step. Bruce thought about having Damian stay, to talk to him about the situation, but decided against it. Daire didn't plan on going anywhere without the boy. Hand-in-hand, the pair of siblings made their way up the steps. Batman and Nightwing watched silently until they left, closing the grandfather clock behind them. \"Damian has a sister?\" Dick asked. \"Apparently.\" Batman turned back to his computer, ready to spend the next few hours learning everything he could about the girl. \"Would Talia really let something like that happen to her own child?\" Dick wondered. \"I'm not sure, but I'm going to find out.\" \"That sucks. And by her own father? Man, I really hope we're wrong. Can't we be wrong for once?\" \"I hope so, too, Dick. I hope so, too.\" oOoOoOoOoOoOo Alfred led the duo up the stairs. He strained his ears but couldn't hear the whispered conversation between the two. Master Damian's change in character had surprised him. He had come accustomed to the stoic boy. Their conversation came to an end, and Damian's confident voice could be heard halfway down the hall. He wasn't as loud as he usually was, and his tone held a gentler note. He listened as Damian rattled off the layout of the hall, telling the girl more than necessary. He heard the softness in the young lad's tone, the smile he was fighting. Alfred smiled to himself at the sound of the girl's giggle. As they walked past a few portraits, the topic changed again. \"He looked just like you,\" she noted, looking up at a picture of young Bruce and his parents. \"Actually, Miss Daire, Master Damian looks like Master Bruce.\" The young duo faced him, startled as if they had forgotten his presence. Strangely, the thought made him happy. Damian needed to relax and get out more. Maybe this sister of his would help. Wordlessly, the girl nodded, letting him know she was acknowledging her mistake. After the wave of cheer, the sorrow that flooded his heart nearly had him double over in pain. The fear and calculating look in the girl's eye was familiar. He had seen it once before, long before he came to work at the manner. And it was haunting. His heart clenched as Damian whispered something to her. She nodded and somewhat relaxed. She trusted the boy but still kept up most of her guard. A comforting gesture, Damian took her hand in his, squeezing in reassurance. They continued the walk to the bedrooms. Alfred offered to give a tour of the mansion, but Damian declined. He would show her around the place. At the doors, Damian took the time to point out everyone's rooms. He then showed her his room, and the empty room beside his, now hers. \"I'll have Father buy you whatever you want,\" he promised. \"For now, settle in. We can train this evening, if you'd like.\" At the mention of something familiar to the both of them, she smiled and agreed. Yeah, it'd be nice. Alfred could see it would take some patience and time to get through her walls, but he was more than sure all the work would be worth it. \"Is there anything I can get you two?\" he offered. \"Camille Tea for Daire and my usual for me, Pennyworth. That is all.\" He bowed at the waist. \"As you wish.\" oOoOoOoOoOoOo They stood in the hall for a minute, Damian waiting patiently for Daire to muster up the courage to open her door. Finally, she twisted the knob and pushed. She let the door swing open, slowly revealing the luxurious room. Damian remained silent, letting his sister look around her new room. The bed was large, and he knew it was soft. Very different from the stiff cots or mats they grew up using. A walk in closet and adjacent bathroom were the other two doors in the room. A medium sized desk propped itself against the wall with the door, a few feet away. The dresser had a huge flat screen hanging above it, attached high on the wall. The walls were a bare, cream color. Damian had a nagging suspicion Daire would want to change that but wouldn't say anything. Their mother and grandfather had been strictly against personalization and other sentimental nonsense. He made a mental note to join Daire when she went out shopping for her room. He'd be able to read her and get her what she really wanted, even if she denied wanting it. Gray curtains were tied open, not that there was much to see. The gardens and lawn around the manor weren't lit up. It was still dark out, and it reminded Damian of the late hour. Daire walked over to the desk, trailing her fingers over the smooth top. The desk was clear of any mess, but Damian had peeped in this room before. He knew the drawers had paper, notebooks, pens, and a few other office supplies. \"Brazilian Ebony,\" she commented, and Damian knew what she meant. The dresser was made of the strong wood. \"Yes, Father spares no expense on anything. Whatever you wish, he will provide. Money is no obstacle.\" \"It wasn't with Grandfather.\" \"Father doesn't mind blowing money on the little things. Whatever you want, Dai, all you need is ask. I will make sure you get it.\" \"You've changed,\" she whispered, not facing her brother. His voice was full, confident. \"So have you, Dai.\" Turning her head back to spare him a glance, she smiled. \"I think I like the new Dami.\" A wave of stress he didn't know he had washed away. He found himself gifting her a soft smile. \"I think you will, too.\" There was another period of silence as Daire walked over to the dresser, gliding her fingers along the surface of that, too. \"Dalbergia melanoxylon,\" she named. \"What?\" a voice behind them asked. Damian, having been focused on his sister, hadn't noticed Drake walk up on them. He didn't show it, but he was surprised. Without turning to even look at him, Damian answered, \"It's an expensive wood. It's what the dresser is carved from.\" \"Oh, okay. So, who's she?\" \"My sister.\" \"Sister? Since when did you have a sister?\" \"I've always had a sister, Drake. She's two years older than me.\" \"Wait, Bruce slept with Talia twice?\" \"No, we have different fathers.\" \"Oh. What's she doing here?\" \"What are you doing here?\" \"I live here.\" \"Tt. Last I checked, you were in Europe.\" \"I finished the case early. Now, what's she doing here?\" \"This is her room, Drake. She'll be living here from now on.\" \"Thanks for the heads up. Anyways, nice to meet you,\" he stepped forward, holding out his hand. He stopped halfway, waiting for Daire to meet him. \"So, Damian's sister, what's your name?\" \"Her name is Daire.\" He sent Damian a quick glare, but the lad ignored it. \"So, Daire, how are you holding up?\" \"She just got here, Drake.\" \"I wasn't talking to you.\" \"Well she won't talk to you.\" \"Why don't you let her decide?\" he growled. He was tired and so not in the mood to deal with the devil's spawn. Daire glanced at his hand but looked away, continuing her exploration of the room. \"So, how are you liking it here?\" He waited, receiving no response. \"Like I said, she doesn't talk to males.\" \"That's not what you said,\" Tim shot back, his mind showing theories and possibilities to make the girl that way. People reacted to abuse in different ways. While Damian grew heartless, Daire could have become skittish. Alfred returned with the requested tea, surprised to see the third body. \"Welcome home, Master Timothy.\" \"Thanks, Alfred.\" \"I see you've met our newest member of the family, Daire.\" \"Yes.\" Handing the tea to Damian and Daire, Alfred went to make his leave. \"Is there anything else I can get you?\" Tim requested some tea be brought up to his room, for he was retiring for the night. Alfred was glad Tim was actually sleeping. He'd probably add a slight sedative to help, in case the insomniac teen changed his mind though. Damian and Daire shook their heads. Daire was ready to be alone. This had been a long night, and she was exhausted. \"Well, it was nice meeting you, Daire. I guess we'll be seeing quite a bit of each other from now on.\" Daire nodded, watching Tim make his exit. \"Can I see your room?\" a soft voice asked Damian. Sipping his tea, he lead the way. \"Tt, of course.\" His room was functional and the most personalized Daire had ever seen him to be. It wasn't much, but the room was tinted in his favorite color, and he had a stuffed cat on his dresser. His desk held a few text books and notebooks. A bland backpack slung on the back of the chair. Everything was neat and organized, the way they had been raised. Damian walked over to the dresser, slipping two items from the top drawer. He set them neatly on top. The same pictures Daire clung to were in picture frames. The beaming children looked into the camera, tiny teeth shining. There were marks from the many times they had been folded, but Daire was in awe that he actually kept them. \"Of course I kept them,\" he retorted when she voiced her amazement. \"Mother destroyed everything else of you.\" \"She told you to give her everything of mine,\" Daire assumed. \"She wanted to be rid of me entirely.\" \"But I kept these. I don't know why,\" he began to ramble, a slight blush on his cheeks. Daire leaned forward, kissing his cheek. \"I kept them, too.\" As proof, she pulled out the pictures. \"I knew you would.\"[Chapter 14] ~ The Pair ~ Damian was seldom away from Daire. They trained together, studied together, ate together, and often ended up sharing a bed. Everyone assumed that was Daire's doing. She disliked having her brother out of sight. But Tim overheard Damian asking Daire if they could stay together, even at night. Now, maybe it was because he knew Daire would have asked anyways, but it wasn't like Damian to ask such a thing. Damian was still stuck up, egotistical, and a know-it-all. Daire had her moments when she was similar, but she was also kind and patient. She was quick to open up to Dick, something that was of no surprise to anyone. They spared together regularly, and Daire often waited near the front door for when he would make the drive over. He was thrilled to have a sister. Alfred was always around, letting Daire get used to his presence rather quickly. She quickly deemed him not a threat but typically kept her distance. Tim and Jason were in and out of the manor. Jason quickly took on the role of annoying big brother, picking on the duo every chance he got. He would visit for a few days then stay away for a few days. He was mad at Bruce, that much Daire could tell, but had a soft spot for Alfred. His attitude towards Damian was iffy. He loved to pick on him. He could be patient, though. During training he was tough but not overbearing. He had a temper, much like Damian, and got angered easily. Tim was difficult. Sometimes he was exactly like Bruce- making her weary- and other times he was a combination of Dick and Jason: friendly and teasing. Much like Jason, Tim was away from the manor a lot. When he was around, he made some intellectual and decent conversations for someone his age. Overall, Daire decided she didn't mind his presence. It was Bruce who took the longest to get on her good side. Despite knowing what her mother told her was a lie and having her brother beside her as proof, she acted as though she couldn't trust him. Bruce didn't trust her much, either (though that was typical), so he didn't have much room to complain. Little was known about Daire. Just like Damian and the League of Assassins, there was hardly any info about her. All Bruce knew was what Damian had revealed. She was Talia's daughter, Damian's half sister, had morals similar to his own (which explained why Damian was so compliant with the sudden change in teachings), and was kicked out of the League for refusing to kill. Bruce could find little about her time away from the League. City cameras caught a few glimpses of her in various places throughout the world. She spent a while under a false identity, where she worked as a waitress and lived an honest life. She had a few acquaintances, maybe some she considered friends. But one day, she disappeared. Day Ivan was still on the missing persons' list, but no one was looking for the loner. oOoOoOoOoOoOo Bruce watched them spar. Her tactics were much like Damian's, but she waited. It would have been hard to tell with unskilled eye, but he had been training for many years. Yes, he had noticed it before. Her pattern. Junk forward; dart aside; go in for the real attack; pull back. Damian knew it, too. But he wasn't as patient. He was too confident in his abilities. He forced his way forward, making Daire step back. She focused on blocking and deflecting his series of attacks, taking mindful steps. At first, it just looked like she was dodging whenever she could or backing up to avoid a hit, the Bruce noticed it. While her path made zigzag, she was heading for towards something. She pushed forward every time Damian let her an opening, taking a few steps forward for every dozen or so back. She circled the giant penny twice and the dinosaur skeleton once. This made predicting exactly where she was headed difficult. But he was the Batman. He could do anything. And he waited. Waited for his son to lose, and this girl to win. He'd learn something in the process. He knew from personal experiences that Damian was a sore loser. But how would he fare this time? Against the girl he grew up with? Damian had gotten use to their rhythm, not expecting Daire to change anything. Daire suddenly sprinted the final few feet to her destination and back flipped onto the Batmobile. Damian followed in pursuit, blind to any possible plan she had up her sleeve. Damian jumped up, ready to fight, but Daire dropped her staff, grabbed his forearm, and swung him on the other side before he ever landed. Damian flipped back onto his feet, now on the other side of the Batmobile. Daire picked up her staff, maintaining the high ground. Damian let out a battle cry as he raced forward. Without warning, Daire dived into him, throwing them both to the ground. There was a thud. There was a grunt. There was a moment of silence. Bruce couldn't see Damian. He couldn't see Daire. But he could hear their heavy breathes as the result of their fight settled in. As predicted, Daire won. \"Tt. You've improved.\" \"As have you.\" There was rustling and two young heads popped up above the hood of the Batmobile. Neither seemed angered. Damian was content, a light frown adorn his features. Daire dared a small smile. It wasn't smug about her victory, instead it was her version of content. She was happy here, with Damian and away from the League. Daire's lips moved, but Bruce was too far to hear the murmur. \"Enjoy the show, father?\" Damian translated. \"Yes.\" He left his answer blunt, turning back to face the Bat computer. He still had work to do. The echo of the clock opening and closing bounced. \"Cookies and milk, as requested,\" Alfred reported, stopping near Bruce. Bruce heard two sets of footsteps. One was quick but light, eager for a treat. The other walked, though he, too, quickened his pace. \"Thank you,\" came the quiet words. Bruce looked up to see Daire bit into the soft chocolate chip cookie in her hands. He reach up, taking one, too. Daire's eyes widened in alert for a moment then forced herself to calm. \"Yes, thank you, Alfred.\" Having Daire around wasn't going to be as bad as he originally thought. oOoOoOoOoOoOo Bruce hadn't tried to dissuade them much, so it was no surprise when Daire joined them on patrol. For now, she was dressed as Thorne, but she would need a new name and outfit soon. \"Sparrow?\" she quietly offered over the com's. \"Like Robin, a bird.\" \"Tt, you can do better.\" Their conversation came to an abrupt end when a bank alarm sounded. \"It'll do,\" Batman settled. \"Head over to-\" \"On our way,\" Robin cut off. Though relatively new to Gotham, both younglings studied maps and landmarks for hours and knew their way around Gotham. They were only a few blocks away from the bank and arrived in the middle of the fight. There was one person, many times larger than Batman and swinging a safe that surely weighed a ton. \"Bane,\" Thorne recognized. Uses a drug called Venom to make himself nearly unbeatable. Weakness: cut off his supply to Venom. Batman released a loud grunt of pain as the safe collided with him. It slipped from Bane's grasp, sending both Batman and the safe to the other side of the bank. With his light weight (in comparison) Batman slammed against the wall, while the safe fell and slid several feet, almost crushing the vigilante. The security guard made his way around the corner, raising his gun and firing. Robin and Thorne hopped out of the way of stray bullets, and the others did next to nothing to Bane. With a roar of fury, Bane charged at the poor guard, wrapping a beefy hand around his waist and squeezing. The man let out a yelp of pain as Robin swung in- using a grappling hook and beams on the ceiling- and surprised Bane. The blow did little more than make him stumble, but it did grasp his attention. He tossed the security guard to the side, earning another grunt of pain. \"Dad!\" a young voice called, seeing her father on the ground. Bane had finally gotten a hold on Robin's cape and threw him through the front windows. \"Robin!\" Thorne and Batman shouted. Neither had the chance to check on their teammate. Bane was stomping towards the little girl, who was frozen with fear at the loud monster before her. Thorne was quick to respond, tossing smoke bombs around Bane. Thorne ignored Bane, running through and snatching the girl around the waist and taking off. Bane stepped back with a cough then charged forwards, knowing his prisoner was being rescued. The small yelp of shock didn't help either girl. But Batman had recovered from the earlier blow, throwing Bat-a-rangs and distracting Bane long enough for Thorne to get the girl away. Batman got in close, attempting to pull out the tubes feeding him Venom. But Bane wasn't having it. His plan was foiled, he wasn't going to get his money even if he could escape the Bat, and his hostage plan was not a possibility. He was mad. He swung blindly at Batman, making the smaller and weaker man focus on dodging. Thorne brought the child outside, using the chance to check on Robin. Said bird was already up, ready to charge back into the fight. Thorne went to go with him, but the child held her back. \"Dad! What about Daddy? No! Please don't leave me!\" \"Robin!\" she growled. \"On it.\" Within a minute, the security guard was running out of the building: hurt but not broken. \"Daddy!\" the girl cried, finally freeing Thorne to run into her father's arms. \"Get her out of here,\" Thorne demanded, running back into the bank. She arrived just in time to watch Bane wrap Batman to one of the columns with a metal pole (one of the poles that once connected support beams/ columns). Batman was stuck, slowly melting the bar while watching his partner and new teammate take on his strongest (physically) villain. His fears proved to be for nothing. The young duo worked well as a team. It was pleasant surprise for the Dark Knight. They had each other's backs and easily made up what the other lacked. Ruthlessness and compassion; quick and planned; attack and trap. Both the children were skilled and had years of experience together. They reminded Batman of the first Robin and himself. Robin was quick and demanded attention, becoming the target of most of Bane's attacks. Thorne was more calculated but just as quick. She fit well into the background, blocking and delivering blows as needed. They moved in time and never got in the other's way. Their upbringing showed in their fighting style, matching and most strikes meant to be deadly. But both swayed their blows a little, avoiding the kill. Every now and then one caught a punch, but the other kept Bane occupied until they recovered. One of Bane's blows knocked Thorne up in the ceiling. She flew up around the triangular structure, barely catching a beam before her trip down. She pulled herself up, needing a breather. Though it took a minute, she caught her breath and followed the fight from above. She pulled out a borrowed bat-a-rang, waiting. Robin noticed, subtly guiding Bane to the perfect spot then holding him there. It was the perfect balance between dodging and attacking. Thorne let herself fall, easily slicing the tubes filled of Venom open and leaking the chemical all over. Without his fix, Bane quickly shrunk to normal size and was handcuffed just as Batman freed himself. He kept his praise simple and short. \"Good job.\" Having Thorne around might not be so bad, after all.[Chapter 15] ~ The Family Business ~ \"So?\" Bruce prompted, watching the girl test the movement in her new uniform. It was mostly black with highlights of brown and deep blue on her chest, outer arms and legs. She had a surprisingly heavy, bright yellow utility belt around her waist. A domino mask covered her eyes, and she had a black cloak that fell to her mid-calves. Her hair was tied into a low ponytail, sloppily pulled into a baggy bun. Her boots were an old pair from the original Robin's. They looked relatively new, and it turns out Grayson hit a growth spurt soon after getting them. All in all, the outfit fit her. \"It suits you well, Miss Daire.\" \"Uh, thank you.\" \"Yes, you don't look bad,\" complimented Damian. It wasn't the best, but Bruce let it slide. He was trying. \"Thanks, Dami.\" She glanced in the mirror for a split second, but otherwise fought to keep her gaze away from the reflection. Bruce didn't fail to notice this. \"It fits.\" She swung her torso side to side, her feet planted firmly on the ground, then did a back hand spring. \"It's flexible.\" She pulled out her katana, swinging it through the air with a shout. \"It doesn't hinder my attacks.\" She sheathed her blade, turning to Bruce. \"It works.\" \"Do you like it?\" \"It works.\" \"But do you like it?\" \"Yes.\" His hand went to the com in his ear. \"You hear that, Nightwing? You did a good job on the suit.\" \"Tt,\" the siblings sighed in unison. \"We still have a few hours before dark. Want to train?\" \"Best two out three?\" \"You're on!\" oOoOoOoOoOoOo It was Daire's first patrol as Sparrow. Like she did as Thorne, she kept up with the Dark Knight and his partner with ease. The night was rather slow. They stopped a break in, ended a few muggings, prevented an assault, and helped people escape a small building fire. As the final victim was brought to safety, the Bat signal followed the sky. Batman glared up at the sky, stalking toward the police station without warning. His partners followed wordlessly. They jumped from rooftop to rooftop, making a beeline to meet Commissioner Gordon. Until they were cut off. A figure landed in front of the trio, a knife in hand. The figure didn't say a word, going straight for the attack. Batman easily deflected the blade. The man was trained, however, and stepped straight into his next attack. Robin jumped in, letting out his battle roar and attempting to overwhelm his opponent. But the man matched him strike for strike. \"Die, child.\" Finally getting a one-up on Robin, he went for the kill. \"No!\" Sparrow shrieked, blocking the swipe with a bat-a-rang. She stepped between the fighters, grabbing his wrist and twisting. He dropped the blade and fell when Sparrow hit the back of his knee. He kicked out his other leg, knocking the children over. Before he could kill them, Batman returned. Batman pushed the man back. Robin helped Sparrow to her feet, then went to join the fight. Sparrow shot out her arm, holding him back. Robin glanced up in confusion; Sparrow narrowed her eyes at the duel. She recognized the style. It was hers. Not exact, but close. She recognized the lapse. Heretic. But he wasn't supposed to be back for another week. He got sidetracked with another mission while he was out of town. The mission was planned to be a week long, but plans do change. Could he have finished early? Is this Heretic? The man fought with rage, making him sloppy but not sloppy enough. \"Die, you bastard!\" he bellowed. He pulled out a knife from his sleeve, close enough to do damage. Batman threw a bat-a-rang, knocking the knife out of his hand. Batman pushed him back, retreating to his two young partners. It was a stand off. Everyone was tense, ready to fight, hands in fists, eyes trained on the enemy. Every move attracted attention, and fingers twitched for weapons. But it was still. \"You'll pay for what you did, you coward!\" Sparrow recognized the voice and asked, \"Heretic?\" His stance faltered. \"D- Daire, is that- is that you?\" \"Yes.\" She dropped her fighting stance, as did their opponent. The dynamic duo stayed tense, ready for a fight. \"You're alive?\" \"Yes.\" And with- with him?\" \"Yes.\" Eyes darted to the Batman and back to her. \"But- But why?\" Batman's gaze went to the signal in the sky. Gordon needed him; they didn't have time for this. He was already behind schedule. \"Go,\" Sparrow relieved. \"He won't hurt me. I got this.\" Without a word, Batman nodded, firing a grappling hook and taking off. \"You, too,\" she said to Robin. Robin didn't want to leave Sparrow, but something told him this was personal. While he usually a nosy person, he'd let his sister have this moment. He planned on bombarding her with questions later, anyways. What's a few more? He, too, left. When they were alone, Heretic repeated, \"Why?\" \"Because of Damian.\" \"But Batman killed-\" \"No, he didn't. My brother is alive.\" Heretic's gaze fell upon Robin's retreating form, glaring. \"That traitor is not your brother.\" And it hit Daire all at once. \"You knew,\" she breathed, shocked. \"The Damian you knew is dead, buried by the Batman and forced to take a different road. The Damian you knew wouldn't hesitate to kill, remember? He was ruthless, cunning, and always went straight for the kill. That boy is not your brother. Not anymore.\" \"You knew Dami was alive. You knew and you didn't tell me! You knew and you tried to convince me to kill him!\" she accused, remembering the one discussion where Heretic said killing Robin would make it easier to kill the Bat. \"He's not your brother. I am, remember? He betrayed you; he betrayed the League. It's our job to kill traitors. It's what we do.\" \"No! Dami didn't betray me! I betrayed him! I betrayed him by joining the League, by killing again, and by almost killing his father. He may have betrayed your precious League, but remember I betrayed it first. If you should kill anyone- any traitor- it should be me.\" \"What about the League? Talia? You're to rule the world. It's your bloodline.\" \"No! It's not. Not anymore. I'm not going back to the League of Assassins. I'm staying with my brother. I'm officially out of the family business, and so is Damian. We've made our choice, and this is it.\" Heretic frowned as Sparrow took out her katana. He placed a heavy hand on his sword, swallowing. \"It doesn't have to be this way, sister. I am your brother, too.\" \"YOU ARE NOT MY BROTHER! My brother is strong, resilient, and cunning, but he is not a liar. He doesn't bend the truth and manipulate others to get his way. He is straightforward and honest.\" Heretic narrowed his eyes. \"He's killed far more people than you have.\" \"Maybe he's a little cruel; a bit rough around the edges. So what? It's what he was taught. It's how he grew up. When I left the League, I was the same way. He did what he had to in order to survive. All he needs is love, patience, and time. He will learn. If there's nothing else he can do, he can learn. He's a fast learner.\" \"What about me?\" Heretic questioned, his grip on his weapon tightening. \"What about you?\" Sparrow spat. \"We didn't grow up together. We don't share any memories, we didn't train and learn together like Dami and I did. You may have the same DNA, but you are not him. You have no memories- no important ones, anyways. You have no soul. You're just an empty shell doing whatever Mother asks, desperately trying to get her approval.\" Heretic stiffened at her words, realizing the truth in them but wanting to deny them all the same. \"She's not the only person I tried to get approval from.\" Heretic dashed forward, his sword out and aimed for Sparrow's chest. But Sparrow had years of training on him, despite appearances. Sparrow had learned from her mistakes and had the time and training to correct them, to make her reflexes perfect. She pulled out her katana, leaving the tip in the sheath as the blade knocked Heretic's off course. He stumbled forward, not expecting the trick of few movements. He thought Daire had showed him everything when she trained him. He thought he could one- up her, even with all her experience. He was wrong. Sparrow released her hold on the katana, using his own momentum to flip him over. He landed painfully on his back, his weapon falling out of his hand. \" Your weapon is your life,\" he remembered Daire telling him. \" If you lose it, you're dead. No matter what happens, never. Let go. Of your. Weapon. \" So, was this it? Was he to be killed by the one person who ever showed him kindness? The one person who treated him like a human, rather than a tool? The person who taught him what compassion and love and patience? \"You. Are. Not. My brother.\" He felt the tip of a blade press against his chest, and he closed his eyes. He wished things had turned out different. He wished he could have had the chance to know the original. He wished Daire could love him the she so obviously loved her real brother. He wished he knew why Damian meant so much to Daire. He wished he could mean just as much. And the blade was gone. \"Goodbye, Heretic.\" He opened his eyes, seeing a dark figure take off after the long since faded figures of the infamous dynamic duo. Daire hadn't killed him. But why? Maybe he still had a chance. Maybe he could find a way to get Daire to come back to him, to be his sister. She could show him the art of gift giving, kindness, and cuddling. She had told him stories of her teaching the original all of those things. Maybe they could sneak into the kitchen for a snack or a rare but delicious sweet. Maybe Daire would forget about Damian, and it would be just the two of them. Daire could teach him what being a brother meant, what having a sister was really like. The bond she described between her and her real brother- Heretic craved it. He wanted to mean something to someone. He wanted to be cared for. He wasn't just a tool. He'd show her that. He'd show everyone. One day. oOoOoOoOoOoOo He wasn't looking forward to it, but he knew it'd be better to get the video conference over with. Sooner was better than later. He set up the laptop, listening to the song like ringing as he waited. He didn't wait long. \"What is it?\" Talia snapped. No greetings, no pleasantries. Straight to business. And lucky him (sarcasm), it appeared he caught her in a bad mood. Heretic reported, \"Daire is alive. She knows Damian is Robin and has teamed up with the Batman.\" She raised an eyebrow, noticing his stoic expression. But she didn't comment. He continued, \"I tried to finish the mission, but the Batman got away. I spoke with Daire and tried to convince her to come back, but she refused. She is also wearing a new suit.\" Talia gave a slow, calculating nod. \"I see. The mission has failed. Return at once. We'll capture the Bat some other day.\" \"That's it?\" he asked, surprised. \"We're giving up. Talia glared into the camera. \"Absolutely not! He will join me, so will my son and daughter. But it's not the right time to attack. That opportunity was missed. But there will be another.\" Her features softened, her voice taking on a kinder note. \"Return home, Heretic. I have a plan, but I'll need your help.\" \"Yes, ma'am.\" ","Summary":" Summary: Two years older but no where near as talented as Damian, Daire was kicked out of the Leagu"},{"Movie":"Cloud 9","Title":"First Kiss","Author":"Nayeli13","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10620239","Passage":"[Chapter 1] AN- PLEASE READ THIS. I KNOW IT'S LONG. So I haven't been posting any stories recently and this movie really stuck with me for some reason so I'm gonna try and get back into the swing of things. I realize that most likely none of you ever read any of my previous works and I have no need to encourage that. I was pretty naïve and had some bad habits. Most fandoms I've been in have had a story like this one so I'm just kind of going with it. This fandom is quite small and I figure it might be less stressful for me because of that. It will be a series of one shots and likely none will be in the same universe as all of these are essentially AU's because I am changing the way Wayla/Willayla are getting together. I make no promises for updates because I have a perfectionist complex sometimes and I'm a college freshman and I don't know what to expect for workload. General Disclaimer: I don't own Disney's movie Cloud 9 or anything of the character's unless otherwise stated. So by the way. Something I do own is Daisy. She's a little bit of a head canon of mine. I will not be going back to directly quote character's where chapters are inspired by parts of the movie. So I apologize if that's what you prefer. My final warning is that this felt very forced to me when I was writing it because I originally wrote something quite depressing and this is me going three quarters of the way back and altering the entire rest of the story to not be an absolute sad, day ruiner. Without further ado I present to you the first chapter of… First Kiss Jaw \"I'm letting the dogs out to meet you. You wouldn't want them to attack,\" Will smirks at her discomfort. He's enjoying this girl letting down her snarky attitude and acting like a normal person for once. Even if it's to be afraid of some dogs that will in no way attack her no matter what he says. It's the favorite experience he's ever had with her. There may not have been many, but the others were all distinctly angry or irritated banter. He unlatches the gates for each dog. \"I have a dog allergy!\" Kayla squeaks as the dogs rush her at her spot on the ottoman letting out a few short barks out of excitement. Will raises an eyebrow at her false claim. \"Somehow I don't believe that you're allergic to dogs when your mother was the one to force you to work here.\" \"Okay so that may have been a little bit of a lie… It's just that I haven't had a dog or been around one in a long time and I don't know. The idea of that kind of made me nervous,\" Kayla says aloud her voice obviously flustered. The dogs are all hopping up and down around her knees except Buford, who has taken up post by resting his face in her lap and soon she begins stroking her hands across his nose, head, and ears. She looks at Buford the whole time and quiets her voice some as a little smile graces her face. \"I had a puppy just like you when I was little. Her name was Daisy. She was the sweetest.\" A shocked expression holds on Will's face. \"You had a dog?\" Kayla nods quickly and turns to face Will. \"Yeah. I had her until I was ten. She was my best friend until I switched schools and met Pia and Lindsey.\" Will answers her still bewildered. \"Sorry I just can't picture you as a dog person.\" \"This is the first time you've ever seen me with a dog,\" She quickly remarks. \"Exactly,\" Will exclaims. Kayla replies with a smirk \"So never having seen me with a dog you can't know whether or not I like them,\" Kayla begins to talk to Buford \"and obviously I do.\" Her hands rub the sides of Buford's neck and he lifts his paws up to her lap and stands on her thighs. She giggles loudly when Buford nuzzles into her chest and neck. She wraps her arms around the big dog and hugs him tight with a big, nose crinkling smile on her face, \"I missed this.\" Will blinks a few times at the sight. He may have to take his statement about liking her quiet and unsassy back. He's pretty sure that he prefers her this way much more. He takes a few steps to the ottoman and sits down next to her. She turns her head to face him with a look of mild confusion on her face. \"What?\" He asks her. She pauses for a moment before replying \"Nothing,\" She turns her attention back to the dog and kisses him on the forehead. \"You're such a sweetie.\" \"Huh?\" Will replies. Kayla turns to Will once more. \"The dog.\" He blinks rapidly a few times. \"Right… That makes sense…\" She nods slowly and then awkwardly returns her attention to Buford, her cheeks have a slight glow. Whether it's from the makeup she's wearing, the chill in the air, or the awkward situation is something Will isn't going to learn. At least not anytime soon. \"Well I guess I'm glad that you actually like dogs. That will make this a lot better than I expected it to be,\" Will offers. \"Me too. Honestly it's already going considerably better than I thought it would. I figured we would've fought a ton until my mom allowed me to go back home. Granted that could still happen, but…\" Her voice trails off teasingly. Will responds interested, leaning towards her. \"But what?\" \"It doesn't appear to be happening. You seem a lot nicer than previous encounters,\" She remarks offhandedly. \"I was a little irritated about my sled at the time. I had reason to be less than pleasant,\" He defends himself. Kayla nods. \"I get that. It was just the first interaction I'd ever really had with you. Not exactly a fond memory of mine.\" He agrees with a smirk. \"This is true, but this seems to be a much better impression. At least to me.\" Buford jerks to the side at the sound of a car passing the front of the store and his nose smacks Kayla in the jaw with a loud popas he leaps from her lap to the front door. A gasp of pain passes between her lips and she reaches to grasp her jaw. Will asks hurriedly, \"Are you alright? Do you need anything? Some ice maybe? Let me look at it.\" She shakes her head with her eyes squeezed tightly shut. She really doesn't want to cry in front of him. They were just deciding how well this was going too. The world just loved to prove her wrong. \"C'mon just let me see how bad it is,\" Will requests, tugging gently on the hands that are grasping her face. She lets her hands be removed in defeat deciding it was better to not fight him on it. She did need to know the condition of it as well. \"How is it?\" She manages to utter by moving her jaw as little as possible. \"I'm surprised it's still attached!\" He exclaims a teasing tone to his voice. \"No though, really it looks fine. It's pretty red right now and I think there may be a bruise forming. That's not going to be enjoyable, but I don't think it's deadly,\" His smile is reassuring. \"This hurts!\" She whimpers. Will turns his body to face hers a little more. \"C'mere.\" She twists towards him, a little confused, but compliant nonetheless. Will reaches out a hand to hold under the good side of her jaw and tips her head up a bit. He moves over and looks at the now obviously forming bruise. \"It's a good thing your little party already happened because this isn't going to be covered by makeup very easily.\" She grimaces and looks downtrodden at Will's diagnosis. She lets out a sad sigh. Will leans back towards her and gently presses his lips to the blemish. Her eyebrows draw together and her face depicts the picture of curiosity and confusion. He scans her face for any sign of anger or rejection. When he finds none he leans towards her again. This time scanning her eyes for any readable emotions. He figures if she really wanted him to stop she would say something even if her jaw is sore. When they are millimeters apart he pauses for a moment and almost backs off. After all if she doesn't want this won't it be awkward later on? Except him backing away now would cause awkwardness of it's own and that thought pushes him to bridge the small gap between their lips. Both pairs of eyes fall shut for the tender and simple kiss. It was more a kiss of confirmation. A silent question between the pair. Do you like me as much as I like you? Kayla reaches out a hand for Will's when they part and holds it with a slight squeeze. Yes. He smiles at her and her small smile in return was all the response that he ever needed. AN- I realized in this scene that Kayla and Nick were technically still a thing if we follow movie-verse. So I decided that I would give you options on how to imagine this. Option A: That Kayla and Nick broke up before she ever worked at the kennel or Option B: That after this Kayla breaks up with Nick. Obviously whatever you think up can be what you want to imagine. Those were just the first two that I came up with.[Chapter 2] AN- Thank you to my reviewer LoveShipper , I really appreciate it. Reviews do inspire me significantly. Cramps are awful… I don't know if I mentioned this, but YOU CAN REQUEST IDEAS FOR THEIR FIRST KISS. That being said I don't guarantee I'll write them immediately or at all depending on if I can connect with your idea. Like if you were to request something about Christmas I may delay that until at least the first snowfall because I'll feel more Christmas-y then. YOUR IDEAS WILL ALL BE WRITTEN DOWN AND CONSIDERED BEFORE I BEGIN WRITING A NEW CHAPTER. I have 31 ideas of my own currently for this story as well as another I am considering for a standalone fic. I'm not writing any of mine in order either. My first idea was the standalone fic and I haven't started that. I modified my first oneshot idea yesterday while writing that first chapter and this chapter was my fourth idea. The reason I have so many ideas is I went through the movie and considered every scene where I could foresee a situation that would cause them to kiss. So in my notebook the ideas are in order by how the movie goes along except for ones that are completely different AUs. Thanks for reading my rambles… Rescue I'm soaking wet, out of breath, and all of a sudden I'm approached by Nick. Great. This is just perfect because the one person I would never want seeing me this disheveled is here. Why is this happening to me? \"Hey Kayla I need to talk to you!\" Nick calls as he walks over to me. I grin and try to push the horridness of this situation off. \"I need to talk to you too actually. Why haven't you been answering my calls?\" \"Well I actually have an explanation for that,\" Nick explains. Will approaches me with a quick question to interrupt my conversation. The look on his face is pleading with me to play along. \"Hey, have you told him yet?\" He says quietly enough for it to seem to be just for my ear's, but loud enough to perk Nick's interest. \"Told me what?\" Nick asks aggressively. Will's body blocks Nick from my view. He mouths the words 'Just go with it. Please trust me.' I look at him curiously, but agree to go along with it by giving him a small nod. This has to be serious if he's helping me out. \"Well no… I haven't told him,\" I say hesitantly. Will slides back to my side and slips his arm around my shoulder. He looks me in the eye to ask me \"Do you want me to tell him?\" \"I suppose,\" I allow him to tell Nick my apparent news. I swear that if Will is messing with me on this I will cause him some intense pain. \"What is it?\" Nick asks with intensity. His eyes are locked on the arm wrapped around my shoulder and the heat of his gaze is powerful. Will looks back to me once more and gives me one last chance to back out. I nod and allow him his chance. Will turns his head back to Nick and says \"Kayla and I are kind of a thing now so she actually needed to tell you. Sorry dude.\" Will gives an apologetic shrug with a 'what can you do?' type expression on his face. I try to hide the surprise on my face. Will better have a really good reason for this. If he doesn't I will make good on my promise. \"Sorry,\" I add gently to make Will's lie stand a little stronger. \"You two? Together?\" Nick asks bewildered and almost offended sounding. \"Um… Yeah… Is it really that shocking?\" I ask nervous for his response. I don't really know what's going on for Will to be doing this, but I really have to trust him now. I let it get this far so I might as well figure out his motivation when I force him to explain this later. The condescending look Nick gives me makes me want to punch him. I don't want to be looked upon as dumb. \"You don't have to believe it for it to be true. C'mon Kayla let's go.\" Will's arm tugs on my shoulder and we begin to turn away from Nick. \"So we're just done here?\" Nick shouts after us. \"Why wouldn't we be Nick?\" I look over my shoulder to shout back. He yells once more. \"Because that is one of the most unbelievable lies I've ever heard. No one else here believes it either.\" \"Go throw your pity party somewhere else, Swift,\" Will calls without even turning around. He then quickly mutters to me \"We've got to talk.\" \"You're telling me. You just broke up with my boyfriend for me!\" I whisper back. \"Why don't you two prove it?\" I hear yelled once more. \"What are we gonna do? People are starting to stare,\" I mumble nervously after peeking over my shoulder. Will purses his mouth and appears to contemplate something quickly before whispering once more \"Trust me.\" I again give him a slight nod and suddenly his mouth has covered mine. My eyes pop open wide before sliding closed and going along with Will's plan. He evidently knew something I did not and I had to trust that. Besides whether I would admit it later or not I was enjoying this. I could feel the arm around my should grab some of my wet hair and I let one of my hands travel to his neck in response. I was shivering from the chill of the air against my soaked body or at least that was what I would claim. I wasn't about to admit the sparks I was feeling with Will. We parted as we heard a loud whistle from the café. A blush stained my cheeks and I looked straight to the ground. \"We better get you inside. You're gonna get sick from being out in the cold all drenched,\" Nick comments quickly pulling me along with him. I nod my head, still staring at the ground. Once he's pulled me all the way into the shop I immediately ask \"So what was all of that? What was going on? Why did you just break up with my boyfriend for me?\" \"C'mon sit down and I'll explain,\" he reassures. I listen to him once more because I have nothing to lose. Once we're sat down I give him an expectant look. He sits there for a moment looking back at me before he speaks up. \"Alright. Intense much?\" I simply give him an exasperated look. \"I need to know what just happened!\" I exclaim. He just smirks at me a little before finally giving me even the tiniest answer. \"I just saved you. That's what happened,\" he states this as though it is fact. \"Saved me from what?\" My voice rises with my stress. \"The common cold?\" He rolls his eyes at me and places a hand on each of my shoulders in an attempt to calm me down. It doesn't give quite that effect, but I settle slightly under his gaze anyway. When I appear to have relaxed enough for Will's taste he adds \"Nick was going to break up with you out there. I don't know why before you ask. All I know is that Dink and Sam overheard his two buddies talking on the pipe and no one deserves that kind of humiliation.\" He rises from his seat and heads over to the towel rack before grabbing one and tossing it to me. I catch it and pull it around my body as I process this information. Nick was going to break up with me. Why would he do that? I thought everything was going fine. Oddly enough I wasn't terribly upset. Maybe it hadn't actually fully sunk in because of the odd way everything had gone down. \"Whoa,\" I whisper in shock. I blink rapidly as though I might wake up and all of this was a crazy dream. I, of course, don't and I continue soft spoken \"Thanks though. That would've been very embarrassing. Looking like this was bad enough.\" I grumble. \"It wasn't that big of a deal. I didn't really think about the repercussions though… So I apologize on that front. Also I don't think you look that bad. You're just a little wet. Besides I think you look pretty nice in that jacket,\" Will teases as he walks back over and sits down next to me once more. \"Oh yeah… We did just tell them that we were together now. What are we gonna do at school?\" I ask him my anxiety quickly returning as my cheeks brightened all over again. He gives me an amused look before replying \"Didn't I just get you calmed down? Relax. Everything will be fine. We can fake it for a few weeks and then breakup. It shouldn't be too hard.\" I blush even more at the thought of fake dating Will the next few weeks. I don't know about that working out. I felt a little too much with him earlier and I have a feeling our inevitable fake breakup would hurt me more than Nick and I's real one. Senior year had been going so great. Prom was turning out to truly be one of the best experiences of my life. It had been over two years since the day Will and I had begun fake dating and about two weeks after that we had realized that the way we were acting wasn't all that fake and agreed to actually try it out. Let's just say that things were going great and no one, but us, Dink, and Sam were aware that it was ever a lie at all. Slow dancing to one of my favorite songs with my favorite boy was truly one of my best memories. I wouldn't trade it for the world. Especially when he placed his lips to mine once more. AN- I hope this isn't too bad. Reviews make me update faster. Just saying.[Chapter 3] AN- So I'm back once again. I'm trying to write somewhat ahead so this was written immediately after the posting of chapter 2. Rescue would've been a good title for this one as well… I may change the titles… Opinions? Thanks again to LoveShipper for reviewing.:) I leave for college in a week so I am trying to write some ahead of time because this is going to be a big transition for me. Just give me a little slack okay?:) I really appreciate it all! Nothing really to say this time around except this one is a little shorter than the others… Or a lot shorter. I don't care. I thought it was cute and different. Avalanche Kayla didn't truly have very many intentions of being careful when she promised the helicopter pilot. There was a reason she picked the most dangerous thing she could think of to do today. She was going to prove Will wrong because nothing was impossible and she was most definitely not afraid. Not even a little bit and she would do this and then she would do the Cloud 9. She was going to prove everybody wrong because Kayla Morgan doesn't give up and she most certainly doesn't give up without a fight. She stood on the edge to look at the amazing view from the top of the mountain for one more moment before she propelled herself forward and began her descent down Tyson's Peak. The first little bit of the mountain was quite simple. The landscape wasn't too complicated and she only had to dodge and weave around some rocks and such, but not a big deal so far. The first problem she faced was a particularly steep section of hill where her board slipped from out from underneath her and she had to pop back up to her feet quickly. Thankfully she performed the task with ease and was off her back and on her feet sliding down the mountain face in a matter of seconds once again. After another short ride down to an outcropping on the front of the mountain she stops to think about her next move because jumping from this ledge doesn't seem to be the right answer, but before she can even think much about her options the ledge has broken away from the cliffside and thrown her down the mountain itself. She's soon riding down the mountain again trying to outrun the snow. She now has to beat the avalanche if she wants to survive. She keeps a good speed and maneuvers well through the ride, but she can soon feel the cool powder surrounding her and it causes her to flip and turn through the air before she actually lands on her back and begins to be weighed down by the heavy snow as it falls down to cover her quickly. The weight of it soon paralyzes her limbs and she can't breathe through the thick layer of frozen water and it seems she's stuck in her icy grave. After spending some of the scariest moments of her life contemplating all she'd done in the world and all she hadn't had the chance to she can feel the snow being displaced from on top of her and the weight that had been compressing her lungs is alleviated. She begins to take in breaths only savoring the feeling of sweet oxygen filling her body. She finally hears Will's voice pleading with her worriedly to answer him and with all the strength and sass she can muster she utters \"Nothing… Is… Impossible…\" \"You risked your life just to prove a point!\" He exclaims in a soft voice. \"Dumb.\" Kayla giggles even though her lungs still feel heavy and her brain a little scattered from her near death experience. She realizes that taking things for granted isn't something that someone who almost just died should do. Especially when a really cute boy saves your life. She responds to him gratefully, \"At least you were here to save me.\" She takes all her strength and leans up and kisses him swiftly and chastely nearly shocking him to death once again. He hugs her tight and wraps his arms around her to support her and keep her upright in the snow. Keeping her sitting straight would allow for easier function of the lungs and he frankly couldn't stand the thought of seeing her pretty face lay in the snow like it had been when he had found her. She didn't have much strength after being buried alive even though it had only been for a short time and him propping her up was helping her immensely. \"You are crazy,\" he says slowly and deliberately as he holds onto her so tightly she almost squeaks. Kayla gathers up enough strength to smirk at him and reply with \"And you love it.\" Will can only shake his head with a little laugh at her comment and press his lips back to hers. He was sure this girl would really be the death of him. Unbeknownst to the happy couple, the café was filled with people that were all celebrating the adorable pair. AN- I figured Kayla could make the first move this time. After all GIRL POWER. That and I thought it would be different. I may do another of this scene where Will kisses Kayla, but for now I will enjoy this. So this is it. I request reviews! Mostly because they make me happy, but partly because everyone will enjoy this more if you do. I promise.:)[Chapter 4] AN- I want to reiterate that I'm leaving for college on August 25th so this is a second warning if this story begins to slow down that's why. I've been trying to write chapters ahead of time so hopefully that will help! Did you know I actually get anxious having these prewritten wanting to post them for you? Because it's true. Fanfiction won't allow me to look at the reviews that were posted to my story and I got two last chapter! So whoever you are if you would inbox me what you said I would really appreciate it because I love hearing from you all! I now present Chapter 4 of First Kiss … Daring It had been a long and productive practice session. Kayla's last trip down the half pipe had her psyched for all the progress she had made training with Will. The feeling she had gotten on that last jump was invigorating. She felt so elated about landing that trick as she sped past Will she stuck her hand out for a quick high five. She wanted to get one more set in before they quit. She dismounted her board and grabbed it to begin the trek back to the start of the pipe. Once she's made it back to the top she straps her board back on over her boots and prepares for the next round. She hops forward and her board takes a dive down the snowy slope before her speed propels her back up the other side. She floats in the air for a moment and she spins her board around quickly and lands perfectly. While she slides back across the snow she plans her next move and once at the top executes it to perfection. She is on a roll today. Her timing is impeccable and it has given her an absolutely sunny disposition. She aims high on the next edge performing an extra turn and when she sticks it she can't help, but celebrate in her mind. She speeds over to Will who is looking at her with an almost stern expression as she stops flawlessly in front of him. Her expectant grin portrays nothing, but the pride of how great a day she's been having on the slopes. When he shrugs as though she had only had minimal success she can't help it when she reaches out and shoves him in the shoulder just hard enough to knock him down. When he grins up at her from his place in the snow she offers him a hand unaware that she'd gained an audience. Nick had meandered his way to the half pipe to get some practice for Fire and Ice. That was his excuse at least. He simply didn't want to admit it was because he was avoiding his father and all the stress that he caused Nick. Nick used to genuinely enjoy snowboarding and even practicing, but nowadays it was seeming to be more of an obligation or a job. He was no longer boarding for the love of it. That used to be the only reason he would pick up a board. It was simply out of love. When it was him and his board and a clear hillside of shimmering snow he felt invincible. Yet if you put him on this pipe with his father's watchful eye on his every move he tensed in discomfort and stress. Snowboarding was both Heaven and Hell for the young snowboarder. He looked out on the pipe as he drew nearer and saw Kayla with Will Cloud. Her grin was so wide her face may very well have split in two. Nick hadn't ever seen her that happy. When Nick sees the smile on her face turn to a smirk and her shove the boy he almost thinks that it's out of malice. Once he hears her loud, harmonious, and cheerful laughter echo across the snow he knows the there is no way the push was meant to do any harm to Will at all. When he sees the easy going grin appear across the other boy's face he can feel a burst of jealousy. He had truly liked Kayla, but there was no way things could ever return to the same as they were before. Not even if he told her everything about his dad. All his hope of ever getting that girl back was lost. It may just be for the better though, he decides. After all she looks extremely happy there with her hand held out in peace for Will sat in the snow. Looking up at Kayla, her face bright red from her large smiles and hearty laughter had to have been the best part of Will's day. This girl was the epitome of cheerful because today had happened to be the best day of her training as of yet. He was certain that if everyday could be as good as today he would be incredibly happy all the time. It wasn't even because that would help her towards her goal of winning Fire and Ice. No, his happiness was far more selfish. He simply enjoyed being a core part of her happiness and in turn the receiver of her affection. She was most definitely the receiver of all of his attention. If Kayla was around Will had a hard time keeping his eyes off of her. It only seemed to get worse as time went on. Dink and Sam had started making jokes to him and had almost allowed Kayla to catch them on several occasions. Will had considered murdering them to keep Kayla from finding out. His heart would flip every time her board left the ground each practice. He was terrified that she would crash like him and lose the happiness she derived from the snow. If there was one thing he could prevent that would be it. Seeing her in the snow, so alive and daring made him want to try again, but he just knows he can't. Will is broken and his walls are slowly rebuilding. Except this time these walls aren't trying to keep everyone out of his heart. These walls are there to protect him from himself because every time she shows him something new or exciting that makes him realize how amazing life, and she, really are, a little piece of his fear is locked away. Too many more days like this with her and Will might be on a board himself. An idea that if it had even been mentioned a year ago or even a month ago would've gotten a sarcastic laugh and pointed jab. Now as he sits on the snow staring at the outstretched hand of a beautiful girl he begins to consider that it could be a possibility. Kayla had came into his life with a crash and knocked all of his walls down. Before he even had a chance to reassemble them fully she was persuading him to coach her and his best friends to win Fire and Ice. There's no telling what this girl could convince him to do. When he's with her he feels a little less scared and a little more daring. He grabs the hand she's offered with a grin and instead of using it as leverage to rise to his feet he gives a quick tug and she falling into his arms with a little yelp. It's his turn to laugh at her as she struggles to gain her balance. When she's finally steady she looks over to him with a faux scowl on her face and he takes one hand to cup her cheek and pull her face towards his own. Once their lips have collided the pair release their doubts of each other and embrace their moment fully. They were finding contentment in each other and the moment that they were sharing because both teens had been on edge about the other's feelings for weeks. Will brings his other hand up to cup her face as well and both of her arms are resting on his shoulders. He can't believe that he actually summoned up the courage to kiss her. Kayla had a way of making him do crazy things. Kayla hadn't been expecting this result to her day at all, but she can very well admit that if her day were cake this would be the icing, which was her very favorite part of cake. She leans into Will a little more because he's making her knees go weak and her stomach flip. When she feels as though she needs to breathe she pulls away for a moment and takes a quiet breath while the blood floods her cheeks. Her already rosy red cheeks from the cold turned crimson as she thought about what just happened. Nick is a little too irritated over the tenderness he just witnessed Kayla and Will share. He knows that he'll never get her back but, that doesn't mean he wants it to be confirmed in front of his eyes. He backs away from what he considers a bittersweet situation to go clear his head of this new stress elsewhere. His problems with his father will just have to take the back burner for now. Will took a deep breath and looked into the face of, what he was sure was, the most perfect girl on the planet and gave her a small smile. She giggles cutely and he can feel her shove his arm once more in retaliation for pulling her down. He's pretty sure it was worth it. AN- Thank you very much for reading. Let me know if you have any ideas or suggestions.[Chapter 5] AN- I haven't seen anyone do this one if I'm correct… I may just be forgetting. This one is the longest chapter yet! Over double the length of the previous longest chapter and it took me two days to write. Let me know if you guys prefer shorter or longer chapters. I can write them with a minimum or maximum word count in mind. On one of my previous stories I wouldn't post until the chapter was over 5,000 words. Thank you to LoveShipper and Clato 27 for their lovely reviews. Fake Seeing the looks on Dink and Sam's faces as they saw Will strap on his board had to be one of the best things I've ever seen in my whole life! Their dumbstruck faces were absolutely priceless and when I informed them that Will was going to be joining our team they were ecstatic. I was equally excited for Will to join the team, but I couldn't let him go with out a little teasing. \"We don't just accept anyone. So show us what you got,\" I say with a playful smile and then add \"and hey, no fear.\" I was thrilled that Will hard agreed to join the team and I couldn't wait for Will to finally take off! He held a serious expression before he dove off the top of the pipe and went straight to the other side performing a pretty good jump for someone that had been off his board for over a year. On the outside I was all smiles, but on the inside I was a bundle of nerves for a separate reason. If Will falls again it is all my fault and I just can't help, but worry about him. I've grown a little more than fond of him and it's gotten to the point where I can't deny that I really do like him. This whole past week for me I've been so awkward that Dink and Sam have been sending me knowing glances. It's really stressing me out and I need something that is going to calm me down from all the anxiety I've had. I refocus on Will as he makes another jump and I hold my breath for the landing. He sticks it and continues to do so with his next trick as well. Jump after jump Will heads down the pipe and he lands every one he tries. I let my fears slip away because Will is performing beautifully and I just can't help, but be elated at this turn of events. Will is doing amazing and when I let the stress and worry fall away my fears come true. He is falling and it's all my fault. I shouldn't have pushed him to join the team. I slide down the side of the pipe and rush towards him with Sam and Dink on my tail. When we finally reach the spot where he's laying I worriedly call out to him and hope that he'll respond and everything will be okay. As his body lays there motionless and silent I begin to panic. I tell Dink and Sam to go get help and as soon as they're on the move Will bursts up with a shout and scares all three of us. He laughs and I feel like I may cry from the shock on top of all the stress and I've been experiencing. I have put myself through so much internal guilt in the past minute that I feel sick and I can't stand to even be there anymore. Will has barely said three words and I couldn't tell you what they were because I am up and running. I run and run and run as far away as I can get from those three boys in the pipe. I just want to be alone and I know exactly where to go. I know the boys are shouting something, but my mind doesn't register what words they were. All I know is that they are getting quieter and that means that I'm not being followed. I'm thrilled with that turn of the events because I need this. I need to be alone for a while. Maybe forever. I'm finally out of the trail and into the trees and I know just where to look.I take a right and push past three large Blue Spruce before I reach my destination. There's a little cave nestled under the branches of the third tree. I pull a bough to the side, duck into the small opening feet first, and slide down the smooth walls into the cave's small room. I tuck into the side of the space just large enough to easily accommodate me. I'm breathing heavily from my run and I wrap my arms around my knees so I can just let go and cry. I release my angst and fears as I lie here blubbering against the cave wall. I can't believe that just happened. What if it was real? He could've been seriously hurt and I would've been the cause of it. I can't do this anymore. I don't think I can see him anymore. It's too much anxiety and I am going to give myself an ulcer before I'm even eighteen. I let out a large sob at the thought of not getting to see him. I like him so much, but it just hurts me to even consider continuing hanging out with him and the boys. He may have been fine, but there are a few things I am right now and fine isn't one of them. In fact I would even venture a guess that I am the exact opposite of fine. While I'm trying to catch my breath and calm down I close my eyes. Before I even realize it, the whole world around me fades to black. I hear the sounds of high pitched whistles and then a deep voice bellows, \"Kayla!\" into the winter air. I can hear the strong winds blowing up on the surface and I have no urge to answer their call. I came out here to be by myself and I plan on staying that way. Besides there is no room for someone else to fit in here. Well at least not comfortably. Th cave is a oblong oval shape that is around 6 feet long and maybe three feet wide at it's widest point. Luckily it has a ceiling high enough that I don't have to worry about bopping my head on anything. I check my phone to see what time it is and realize that I had slept quite a while because it was eight o'clock at night. That explains why they're searching for me. I hear the voice shout again much closer, \"Kayla! Where are you?\" I recognize the voice immediately now that it's close enough for me to truly hear over the wind. Will. Why on Earth is he out here? Does he not understand that I ran as fast as I could away from him today? You'd think he would understand. He shouts for me again. \"Kayla!\" He sounds like he's right next to my cavern, but who knows with all the wind. I just hope he wanders off and goes back home so I can leave. Spending the night here was most definitely not my plan. Will yells, \"A storm is kicking up. Your dad called me and said you weren't home yet. You need to get home. Kayla!\" He whistles once more and pauses in hope of hearing an answer in return. I stay as silent as I can and wish with all my might that he moves on. There is no way I'm leaving this spot until Will has left the immediate area and I hope he gives up his search soon. I don't want him stuck out here looking for me in a storm either. When I hear the sound of his voice distance with his next shout I release a big breath. My moment of peace doesn't last long because in the next instant I hear the sound of rushing wind and a crack. I pop up quickly from my spot in the corner and pull the goggles still wrapped over my head to cover my eyes. I have to make sure Will is alright. This storm progressed quicker than I thought it would. I move to the short tunnel and climb out of the cave. I scan my surroundings trying to see any colors in this flurry of white. I reach into my pocket and tie a pink headband into the pine tree so I can find my way back easier and set towards a patch of orange in the distance. \"WILL!\" I shout after him as loud as I can. \"Come back this way. It's too dangerous out here!\" The orange patch moves some and I hope Will is turning around in response to my request. \"Kayla?\" He yells, confusion evident in his tone. \"Yes, it's me. Now come back here it's not safe!\" I plead with him as I move closer to him and further from shelter. I can see him making progress towards me and notice the felled tree to my right. This must've been the crash I heard while I was still in my cave. When Will is close enough that I can almost reach him I speak loudly, \"Follow me. We have to get inside.\" I can hear his befuddled response of \"Inside? Where?\" and choose to ignore it. I need to trek back through the rising snow. Now isn't the time to play twenty questions with him. I push through the deep snow and lead Will towards the tiny pink speck that is my headband. We can't be more than fifty feet away, but the snow is dropping in sheets and I can barely see it. I trudge forward with Will just stops behind me. It only takes us a minute to reach the tree and I brush some snow away from the bottom branch of the tree before lifting it and gesturing for Will to enter. He slowly sits on the edge of the hole and slides in the cave. I check to make sure he's moved and follow. The branch covers the cave entrance once more and I turn to face Will. \"Are you insane?\" I ask him, mildly irritated at his irrational behavior. \"You could've gotten yourself killed!\" \"Me?\" He responds defensive and angry. \"You're the one that just ran off today into the woods never to be seen again! I had no idea what to think! What did you expect me to do? Just sit at home and wonder if you were gonna be alright!\" I pull my goggles off my face and can see him more clearly. The cave has darkened since earlier today, but there is still enough light that I can make out the offended expression on his face. I'm sure he can see the scowl gracing my face as well. \"That's exactly what you should've done,\" I state simply. \"I can take care of myself. Obviously.\" I gesture to the excellent shelter round us. \"What was your plan? To wander around in a blizzard until you got pneumonia? What on Earth were you thinking, Will?\" I mask my concern with anger and refuse to meet his gaze. His voices rises with his temper as we both sit on opposite sides of the small cave. I've drawn my knees back up to my chest and he's leaning against the wall with his legs sprawled in front of him. \"My plan was to find you and make sure you were safe. Especially after that stunt you pulled today. What is wrong with you Kayla?\" My eyes flash in offense. \"What's wrong with me?\" I shout. \"What is wrong with me? Whatever Will. Just don't talk to me. I'm done. I quit.\" I send him a harsh glare before returning to look at my knees. I swivel my body so my back is pressed against the cave wall and my feet are touching the other side. There is a long silence between us. I think he may have taken what I said to heart and I could make it out of this storm without somehow embarrassing myself. I feel like we sit in silence listening to the storm for almost an hour before Will speaks up quietly with, \"Why did you run?\" \"I don't want to talk about it Will. Just leave me be,\" I blow him off, hoping that he'll just drop the topic completely and we can go back to our peaceful, yet awkward silence. I can hear him shifting across the now pitch black cave and I would guess it's out of discomfort. I don't think he'd budged from his spot the whole time we had been here. I was lucky to be used to this cave and sitting in one of my preferred spots. He didn't have that luxury and I did feel a little bit bad about that, however he could be stuck in the blizzard and a slightly uncomfortable cave was much better than freezing to death. This cave had been growing colder as well so I couldn't imagine the temperatures outside. \"I'm gonna check the surface and make sure the tree isn't so packed with snow that we're trapped in here.\" I say aloud before turning out of my cubby and sliding my hand along the upper wall to find the exit. I shove my boot into one of the foot holds and stand upright so I can reach ground level. I stare up at the bough that covers the cave's only entrance and exit point before giving it a rough shove. It jumps up some, but it doesn't move far enough for me to get out. The weight on the branch keeps me from holding it up to high or too long. I jump when Will's voice sounds from underneath me. \"Do you need any help?\" I'm torn between stubbornly declining and struggling with this branch, all the while putting our lives in danger as it will only gather more snow, and just accepting his help and facing an absolutely painfully awkward situation. With a deep breath I answer, \"I think I am going to because this branch is really heavy. Getting trapped inside this cave is not on my to do list.\" In my head I silently add, 'Especially with you because this is the most awkward experience of my life.' \"Alright. So how about I push the branch up and you slide out to sweep off as much snow as you can. That sound good?\" He asks tentatively, as if he's afraid I'll burst. \"Sure, but it's gonna be a tight squeeze in this little entrance. I'll try to squeeze up at the very top so that you can stand where I have my foot alright?\" I reply calmly. \"Just feel around for my foot and it's in a little divot on the cave wall.\" I can feel one of Will's hands grab the bottom of my pant leg before traveling down to my foot and finally the cave wall. While he's busy I pull my goggles back down over my eyes. Once I'm sure he's found the foot cubby I pull my foot out of the ridge and climb to the very top of the tunnel and try to keep my balance by bracing my feet to the wall and sticking my gloved hands around the edge of the exit underneath the branch. \"Alright. I'm coming up,\" Will warns me before I hear shifting and he's pressed up against my back. \"When you push up on the branch I'm going to slip out okay?\" I confirm with Will. My fingers are beginning to ache from grasping the lip of the cave entrance and I hope this gets done soon. \"Yeah,\" Will answers quickly. His breath tickles my ear and I stiffen slightly. \"In three, two, one!\" He counts down for me before he gives the limb a rough shove getting it about a foot off the ground. I push myself up and out of the cavern and twist to sit on the edge. I set to work immediately brushing the large accumulation of snow off of the tree. It feels like I'm fighting a losing battle, but the snow appears to have settled down from earlier. I move as quickly as possible because it really is much colder up here. I lift the branch and drop back into the safety of the cave. When I hit another body I land with an oomf on top of Will. \"Sorry!\" I apologize vehemently. I should've checked where he was before I hopped back inside, but I probably wouldn't have seen him anyway. I fumble to stand up and get away when Will bursts into laughter. I finally manage to get my footing and get away from him when he settles down. \"C'mon! That was funny. Any other time you would've laughed at that. What's up?\" Will asks concerned. \"I'm fine,\" I answer plainly. I don't want to do this. I just want to make it out of this storm alive. I can hear the sarcasm in Will's voice during his response. \"Yeah. So that was a lie. What's the real answer?\" I sigh to convey my irritation and tell him, \"I don't want to talk.\" I hear him move over to me and I back even closer to the wall. \"Well that sucks for you because we're talking,\" He demands. I stay silent and Will takes another step towards me. \"Fine. We'll talk, but just back up some okay?\" I allow. \"Why?\" Will asks with genuine concern. \"Will you just do it?\" I plead. He stands there silent for a moment before saying with a firmness. \"No. I won't. You've been acting weird for over a week now and I'm done just ignoring it. You're gonna explain and I can stand right here while you do because I deserve to know. It's worrisome Kayla.\" I twist my hands together and look at my now visible breath in discomfort. At least he can't see my face. That would only make this more difficult for me. I stutter slightly as I begin speaking, \"I-I'm sorry.\" It's all I can manage to say before I've broken down again and I'm shaking. I lean back into the wall and wish with all my might it would just swallow me whole. \"Kayla? Are you okay?\" Will's concern is clear and he reaches out and grabs my wrist. I'm choking back my sobs with as much effort as I have. I don't want to do this. This is far too embarrassing and all the stress that I have put on myself these past weeks has clearly made me crack. I'm broken and helpless and I have no way of holding it back any more. When Will figures out I'm not going to answer him he pulls my wrist and I limply go with the tug. He says, \"C'mere,\" while he pulls me into a tight hug. I continue to cry into his chest for a few minutes, all the while trying to figure out how I'm going to explain all of this to him. I stammer out, \"S-s-sorry Will.\" I sniff loudly and tears are still rolling down my cheeks. He releases his grasp on me, but grabs me by my shoulders. \"Why?\" \"It's a long story, but the abridged version is I've just been putting a lot of stress on myself and kind of snapped. I really am sorry,\" I'm starting to calm some and my voice has lost it's quiver. \"Let's sit down okay?\" Will suggests gently and he pulls me down to the cave floor by my hand. I sit crisscross, but I can feel his legs on either side of me. \"What exactly were you stressing about? Maybe I can alleviate some of that. I did cause some of it when I scared you before and we are stuck in here. So we might as well work together to get you unstressed.\" He replies logically. I breathe deeply for a moment and decide that resistance is futile. \"I had all my average stress going on about school and stuff like that.\" \"Okay. Do you need any help with any certain class? I'm pretty good at math and science type courses and could help you out if you are struggling,\" Will offers. I shrug even though he probably can't see me. \"It's nothing really. I do fine, but I worry to much.\" Will answers back, \"Alright. So that's been settled somewhat, but that's not all of it. What else is there?\" \"Umm… Well. I've been stressing about Fire and Ice…\" I admit quietly. I'm hoping I can push this episode off on Fire and Ice and not have to explain all my feelings. \"Kayla, you honestly shouldn't stress about it. Sam, Dink, and I will be proud of you, however you do. That much you can be certain of. I can also guarantee you will give Sky a run for her money and that much is certainly something to be proud of,\" Will reassures me. My cheeks burn at the fact that Will is gonna be proud of me. He goes on to ask in a skeptical tone, \"Is that everything?\" I swallow and answer honestly. \"It's the last of it that I want to talk about.\" \"Okay… Well can I know why you don't want to talk about the rest of it?\" Will asks politely. I don't want to begrudge him an answer because he's being far kinder to me than I deserve. \"It's just awkward and I don't really want to make this anymore awkward than it has to be.\" I tell him sincerely, yet vague. Will pushes for a little more information. \"Awkward in general or is it awkward because of me? I promise I won't judge you. I know we haven't been friends for very long, but you can tell me.\" \"It's awkward because it's you…\" I admit quietly. Will attempts to put me at ease, \"You can tell me. Really I just want to help. No judgement. I promise.\" I sit quietly for around a minute before I finally tell him, \"I really can't Will. I'm sorry.\" \"So it's about me then,\" Will states. My eyes widen and I'm thankful for the darkness. \"Ummm…\" \"Well I'll admit something to you first. Then we'll talk about how I'm causing you stress,\" Will tells me. He pauses for a moment before continuing, \"Thank you so much. You have pushed me harder than anyone ever has. You encouraged to get me back on the pipe and then today on my board… It was amazing. I forgot how fantastic it feels to ride and I have you to thank for that. So just… Thanks.\" I blink a few times before stumbling through my words somewhat, \"Um. It was no big deal. So, uh, yeah. No thanks required.\" Will exclaims quickly. \"That's it!\" \"What?\" I ask. \"Were you seriously stressed about that? About my fall?\" he asks me seriously. I'm baffled that he's figured me out, for the most part, in less than half a minute. \"Kayla?\" He pulls me back out of my own world. \"Well a little bit…\" I admit to him. I'm a complete sucker and by the time we get home I might as well move because he'll be completely creeped out. \"I'm the one that convinced you to do it! So now if you get hurt it's my fault!\" I exclaim. Will scoots forward slightly and puts his hands on my arms to get my attention. When he gets this close I can make out his features and I'm afraid because that means he can see me. \"Hey,\" He says softly to get my attention. \"It isn't your fault at all. It's my choice and I would never blame you so you shouldn't blame you either.\" Just because I shouldn't doesn't mean I won't. I don't respond to him because I've given too much away already. My eyes stray from Will and to the dark walls of the cave. I think that this boy is trying to kill me. \"Why do you keep doing that?\" he asks. \"Why can't you just look at me?\" My eyes flash up to his and he's looking at me with such intensity my eyes flick away again. \"See! That!\" He exclaims. \"Why do you do that?\" I gather up my courage and look him straight in the face. \"I just do. Alright.\" Will rolls his eyes at me and calls me out. \"So you're lying again. Which by the way you aren't very convincing.\" \"I don't have to be convincing.\" I say monotonous as I again avert my gaze from the boy in front of me. He grimaces. \"What aren't you telling me? I know it has to be something big. You wouldn't hide so much. Plus this has to be the thing that has had you acting so odd the past week.\" I sit quietly and fidget a little bit. I really want to pull my knees up to me and hide. \"C'mon Kayla. Don't you trust me?\" Will moves into my line of vision and the look on his face almost breaks my resolve. He looks hurt by the fact that I won't tell him, but it would change so much. Even if it was for the better. \"Yes,\" I sigh. I won't lie to him because I really do trust him. I see him blink several times out of the corner of my eye, as though he wasn't expecting that response. When I wait a few moments I seem to have stunned him into silence and decide that if he wants to know so bad I should tell him. He's brought any consequences on himself. \"Do you trust me?\" I ask him deliberately. Will is still stunned, but answers me, \"Of course.\" \"Are you willing to take responsibility for any changes after you learn this? We might not be able to be friends because you won't want to be friends anymore.\" I ask him dead serious as I look him straight in the eye. I want him to know that what he's going to learn is actually serious and will seriously effect our dynamic. \"I don't foresee that happening.\" Will answers, his voice having a sort of finality in it's tone. \"Whatever you say.\" I whisper before rising to my knees and leaning in to Will. I grab the collar of his shirt and press my lips to his, figuring this will get my point across much better than any words I could come up with to awkwardly spew while my face turned into a tomato. When I move to pull back Will's arms grab my waist and hold me there. He begins kissing me back and I melt because every part of my being was prepared for rejection and this doesn't seem to be what I got. I bring my hands to his shoulders and we part soon after. I lean back awkwardly and stare at the ceiling unsure of what to do or where to go now. Will breaks the silence with, \"You were right about one thing Kayla. We most definitely can't be friends now.\" As he moves closer I can see his sly smirk and he's begun kissing me again. I simply enjoy the effortless feeling for now because by the time we're out of the storm we're going to have to discuss 'us', but for now I'm just content right where I am. AN- So I hope there aren't too many mistakes I was writing this while extremely tired. My headcanon for this one is that Will is pretty known for randomly popping up and kissing Kayla randomly (including very public places like school, the mall, out boarding) and then stating \"Wouldn't want you to get stressed.\" The whole town knows he does it, but the pair refuse to explain what it means and no one has ever been told the story of how they got together. It frustrates Pia and Lindsey greatly because they feel they should get the story as Kayla's best friends. Dink and Sam just want to know why Will smiles when anyone mentions they're stressed out.[Chapter 6] AN- Welcome back guys. This one will be much fluffier than yesterday's chapter. Thankfully. I honestly don't know what happened and I'm quite sure if I liked it… This is for Clato 27 because she requested it and inspired me to write it the way I have. I'd also like to state that I am a teenage girl and writing from Will's POV was a bit of a challenge. I hope I didn't botch it up too much. The movie dialogue here was actually exactly copied because I had the movie going in the background and this scene came on. Also I blushed furiously the whole time I was writing this and whenever this scene of the movie comes on because I'm not a big flirty person and I get second hand embarrassment from the thought of that ever occurring. On with the story! Hallway \"Hey!\" I approach Kayla in the hall to ask her about later today, but before I can she's already spoken. \"Hi! Uh, do you think that my hands are small?\" She lifts her hand up and I reach out and take it. \"They look fairly regular sized to me, \" I say slightly confused by her question, but grateful for the excuse to hold her hand. She looks back up to my face and says, \"Uh, well, why don't you hold it a bit more normal?\" She requests. I slide my hand around hers to grasp it as if I were actually holding her hand and with a small smirk ask, \"Is this better?\" Her eyes have flicked from our hands to my face again. She replies quietly, almost shy, \"Yeah, much.\" I suddenly register that our exchange is being shamelessly watched by her two best friends and begin to feel slightly awkward about the situation. Kayla turns away from me to look over into the cafeteria. My eyes follow her gaze and I see Nick leaning at a table with Skye. He's looking our way as well and I realize that, that's what this is all about. I'm disappointed that for Kayla I'm just a little revenge. I thought she was actually being genuine. The smile has fallen from my face at this understanding. I've always been told that there's always a little grain of truth to every lie. So if Kayla using me was the lie… What was the truth? Maybe she did like me somewhat, but not enough to pursue seriously yet or she was simply not quite through the woods with her problems with Nick. Whatever it was I had chosen not to care. I determine that I get to make the decisions in my life and that if I really do want Kayla, and I'm pretty sure I do, I should just go for it. Anyways, if she wants to use me to make Nick jealous I'm pretty positive this will. As soon as she turns to look back at me I place my free hand under her chin and tip her head back slightly to kiss her. The kiss is quick and a little rough, but it got my point across. When I release her from my grasp I simply turn on my heel and head off to my next block. I had caught a glimpse of her surprised expression before I had turned away from her and it was pretty adorable. While I was walking away I stole a glance over to where Nick had previously been and see him standing there with smoke practically rolling out of his ears. He's seething and it's absolutely hilarious for me. I was never one to play mind games for a competition, but for me this isn't about Fire and Ice. I genuinely like Kayla and angering Nick is only an additional benefit for me. After sending a smug grin his way I head off to class. I'm running a bit early for practice with Kayla, Dink, and Sam today. We didn't have to work in the shop until later today and I was going to get at least one run in before those three made it here. I had reached the top of the hill and when I took off I felt like today was gonna be pretty great. I landed all my moves and was prepared to trek all the way back up to the top of the pipe when Sam and Dink showed up. \"Hey Will!\" Sam shouts from about forty yards away. \"What's up?\" Dink pitches in. I smile at my best friends and make a slow jog over to the pair. I set my board down at my feet while I reply. \"Hey. Just got my first run in. Today is gonna be great,\" I grin widely at them. Sam's eyes widen and he looks as if someone may have shot him. \"Are you alright bro?\" I ask him curious. He rubs at his eyes a few times and then nods. \"Yeah. I must've been seeing things.\" \"Did you wipeout again?\" Dink asks concerned. \"You've gotta be more careful dude. You're gonna do some serious damage one day.\" I'm still a little worried for Sam's mental stability when I feel a yank on my arm. I turn around to see who it is and I'm being kissed. I immediately freeze out of shock and when it's over, I see Kayla standing in front of me. \"Consider that payback,\" she laughs with a proud grin on her face for surprising me. I blink a few times and when I look behind her I can once again see an extremely livid Nick Swift. I laugh loudly at the look on his face and this causes Kayla to turn around. She spots Nick soon and then begins laughing just as loud as I am. I comment, \"For someone with a girlfriend he looks awfully jealous.\" Kayla nods, \"He sure does.\" She giggles and I just grin back at her. \"What just happened?\" Dink exclaims from behind me. I turn back to face him and side step so that I don't block Kayla from our circle. \"Kayla and I have been messing with Nick's head all day. For some reason it really irritates him when I do things like this.\" I sling an arm over Kayla's shoulders and I'm sure that Nick is not pleased. Sam says slightly bemused, \"I didn't even know someone's face could get that red…\" Kayla and I both crack up at his comment and the boys join soon after. It's the hardest I've laughed in my whole life. AN- My headcanon for this one is that during the weeks leading up to the competition Dink and Sam both point out to the pair that it didn't seem like playing around. There was a little bit of dancing around each other for a day or so before the consensus is that they had been acting couply for weeks to make Nick angry. Now they just had to do it to make themselves happy. Also there will more than likely be another oneshot from this scene. I came up with several ideas for it. I'm not quite sure if I like how I ended this one… I feel like my endings haven't been very strong the past few chapters.[Chapter 7] AN- Kayla in this fic is a little bit based off of me. When I played sports in high school I was referred to as the team mom. When someone was hurt I was the first one to help in most situations. I also tend to use a lot of terms of endearment when I'm helping someone that is injured or sick. The tonsils thing is based on me as well. Also the cheap date lingo is used in the hospital where I stayed. Thanks to LoveShipper and Clato 27 for their lovely reviews. They make me oh so happy!:) New longest chapter alert. This is going to sound absolutely insane, but this is actually inspired by The Little Mermaid to a degree. Just stay with me alright. I hope it'll make sense at the end. Also there are no mermaids. Here. Have a story. Remember Watching all these amazing boarders was a phenomenal experience for me. I couldn't believe that out of all these boarders one of the guys I went to school with was a shoe in for the win. He literally just had to complete this run to win Fire and Ice's mens' category. I swell with pride for him. It's kind of cool to think about it. We have a math class together and he's about to win one of the biggest snowboarding competitions there are. I watch him ride down from my place on the edge of the crowd. I was lucky enough to be close to the action, but the angle I was at made it hard for me to see to the very back of the pipe. I could hear the hoots and hollers from the crowd around me and I knew that Will must be doing well. He rides into my view and I cheer loudly at his next trick. He heads up the pipe for the last time and it seems like the whole world is in slow motion. Will didn't make his trick and as he fell through the air the crowd let out a gasp and quieted to an almost dead silence. I was the first one to react to his still form lying on the ground. \"Will!\" I shout as I rush over to him. I kneel next to his body and pull his goggles from his eyes. \"Are you alright?\" I ask him quietly. He lets out a groan and I look down at his leg. It's lying crooked at his ankle on the ground. It's most definitely going to warrant a ride to the hospital, so I turn to shout over my shoulder. \"He's going to need some help! Call a medic!\" I look back to Will and see him blinking his eyes slowly. I say softly to him, \"No, no, no. You need to keep your eyes open, okay? C'mon Will. Stay awake for me.\" He appears to push his eyes open with great effort and squints a little at me. I grab one of his hands and give it a slight squeeze. \"Staying awake is important, okay? You need to be awake. Can you talk? My name is Kayla. I go to school with you.\" He mumbles something I can't make out over the murmurs of the audience. I don't push him to repeat it, but his eyes are fluttering again. \"Nu-uh. Keep your eyes open,\" I squeeze his hand again with a little more pressure. When his eyes are open once more I begin to speak again. \"We have math class together. Did you know that? In fact I'll let you borrow my notes because you will be in the hospital for at least a few days I'm sure. Sound good?\" Will is muttering something again. It sounds like a denial of staying in the hospital, but I can't be positive. \"So where is most of your pain at?\" I ask him. It will be important information to know for the medics. He groans a bit and I lean closer so that I can hear him better. \"Chest and leg,\" his reply is breathy, but I can make out his answers. I squeeze his hand again and answer with, \"Well the ambulance shouldn't take too much longer. It just has to pull through the crowd. Alright?\" I can hear feet crunching on snow and can spot a brunette woman running this way with a terrified look on her face. \"Is Will alright?\" She asks worriedly. The tone of her voice carries in a way only a mother's would. I'm positive that this woman is Will's mom. \"I'm pretty positive either his leg or his ankle is broken. I can't be quite sure because of the placement. He also mentioned his chest hurt though. I'm not sure what issue he's having there because there aren't any real visual cues,\" I inform the woman swiftly and professionally, as if I was ripping off a bandaid. Coddling her right now wouldn't help her or more importantly Will. \"I'm Kayla by the way.\" I give my rudimentary introduction as I turn back to Will. He's closed his eyes once more. \"Will open up your eyes. You have to stay awake. It's the only way things will get better, hon,\" I squeeze his hand tightly and can hear the ambulance rolling through the snow to get Will. He's forcing his eyes open again per my request. \"The ambulance is almost here. You're gonna be fine,\" I reassure him. I squeeze his hand once more then release it and stand back up. I'm practically tackled by the woman I still haven't confirmed to be Will's mom, as soon as I'm upright. She's crying and almost hysterical. I wrap my arms around her in an attempt at comforting her. \"He's gonna be okay ma'am. I'm sure of it.\" I peek from where I'm standing to make sure Will is still awake and see that he appears to be struggling. The ambulance is seconds away and I pull away from the hug. I crouch back down and grab onto Will's hand. \"The ambulance is here. You'll have help in just a few seconds, alright?\" I squeeze his hand one last time and stand back up. \"I better go miss.\" \"I know this is pretty big to ask, but could you please come with me? I don't think I can do this alone,\" she requests. Her eyes are red and puffy and her features show copious amounts of stress. I think for a moment and finally decide on a response, \"I'll call my father. Just give me a minute.\" The paramedics are already looking over Will somewhat. They're being quite ginger with his leg and while I dial my phone I can hear the paramedics being informed of Will's chest and leg pain. My dad picks up and I explain to him the situation quickly. I don't want to hold up any progress. My dad gives me his blessing and I give a thumbs up to let the woman know I'm okay to go with her. Once I'm done on the phone they're loading Will up into the ambulance. The paramedics offer both of us a hand up into the vehicle before it speeds to the hospital. \"I'm sorry. I don't believe I ever told you, but I'm Will's mom,\" she confirms my earlier suspicion. I smile at her in a soothing manner. \"I figured you were. I could tell by how worried you were.\" She nods and casts a worried look over to her son. The paramedics are working over him by removing some of his gear, preparing an IV, and such. \"Ms. Cloud, I'm sure that he's going to be fine.\" \"I hope so,\" she states simply. \"I'm sure of it. I know he's going to be a fighter for you,\" I answer back truthfully. Being nice is never a bad thing to do and Will's mom needs a little kindness right now. We've reached the hospital and I hop out of the back of the ambulance to clear the way. I offer a hand up for Ms. Cloud and she takes it to step out of the vehicle. We both slide to the side and the paramedics bring Will out on the gurney. We follow them as they push him into the hospital. Once inside I'm overwhelmed by the volume of the space and can't make out what is being said for the most part. I hear them say that Will isn't breathing well, but can't hear the reason why. We're told to stay in a small waiting room while Will is pushed back for surgery. As soon as the word surgery leaves the doctor's mouth Will's mom is in tears. I strain to hear him say that one of Will's lungs has collapsed and they have to go in to fix it. I nod numbly to dismiss the doctor and I turn to face Ms. Cloud. \"He's gonna be okay,\" I give her words of comfort and she takes my hand. \"Thank you for coming,\" she whispers with tears in her eyes. I give her a soft smile. \"Anytime.\" We sit in the waiting room for close to an hour, chatting away about nothing. I attempt to distract her with the conversations. I'm sure her thoughts would only stray to her son's condition and she would assume the worst. I tell her that I go to school with her son, that we're in the same grade, and even the same math class. She seems elated at that development. \"It's great to hear that Will has such excellent friends,\" she smiles widely. I hate to burst her bubble, but I have to let her know. \"Actually I don't believe that we've ever spoken,\" I tell her. \"Excluding today of course.\" She responds shocked. \"Oh. I thought you were close friends the way you were helping him.\" \"No,\" I give her a small smile. \"I was just doing the right thing. I'm not opposed to being his friend, I just don't believe him and I have ever talked.\" \"Well I'm glad you helped him. I'm sure it made a load of difference,\" Ms. Cloud says with a firmness that I wouldn't argue with. We sit quietly for a minute and a doctor comes out the doors that they had pushed Will through the last we saw him. \"You're Will Cloud's mother?\" the doctor addresses Ms. Cloud. \"Yes,\" she says and all of the stress that I had worked to fade from her features was back. \"He's all fine. He's stable and should be waking any minute. Would you like to come and see him? I can explain more on the way to his room.\" The doctor offers. \"What kind of a question is that?\" she laughs. \"Of course!\" Her face has relaxed since she heard of Will's improved condition. She immediately stands and walks over to the doors that the doctor is standing by. She turns back to me and asks, \"Well aren't you coming?\" I reply quickly, \"I just thought you may want some time alone with your son.\" She raises an eyebrow at me and says, \"You essentially saved my son's life. You get to come.\" I stand quickly and walk over to her and the doctor. He instructs us to follow him and while we walk down to the elevator begins to explain Will's injuries. His ankle shattered in the crash and he broke a rib that then punctured his lung. It caused him to have trouble breathing and he was lucky to be alive. The doctor informs us that he also tore a tendon in his knee and they had gone in to repair that as well. He was going to have to be on crutches for at least eight weeks. I grimace at that because that means he's not boarding for at least then if not even longer. I know that I love boarding because I feel so free and happy. We reach Will's room and the doctor escorts us inside. He lets us know a nurse should be in to check on him any minute. I take a seat by the wall away from the bed and Will's mom approaches him immediately. She drops her purse in the floor by the head of his bed and begins speaking to him. \"Will…\" She speaks softly and grabs for his hand. \"Will sweetie it's your mom. Can you wake up for me?\" I look into my lap because I don't want to intrude on a mother, son moment. I twist my fingers around and hear Ms. Cloud speak again. \"It's so nice to see you awake again.\" \"Hmm,\" I hear Will's deeper voice groan. I'm sure he's just waking up and is most likely still under some affects of the anesthetic. \"Feel a little sore?\" Will's mom asks him. I hear a deeper breath before Will answers her, \"Yeah.\" The door swings open and a nurse walks in. \"Nice to see you awake. I'm Eloise and I'll be your nurse for the time being,\" she approaches the hospital bed and I watch their interaction. \"How are you feeling?\" \"A little sore and tired,\" Will replies. \"That's normal and to be expected,\" Eloise tells him. \"Are you experiencing any pain, headaches, or sensitivity to light or sound?\" Will sits quiet for a moment before he answers her, \"I don't think so. I'm pretty sure I've got everything going well.\" The nurse smiles and lets him know that she's available at the press of a button. \"Your mom and girlfriend need to leave by nine o'clock because that's when visiting hours are over in pediatrics.\" She heads out the door and I can feel my face flush. Will appears very confused and I return my gaze to my lap. \"What was she talking about?\" Will asks confused to his mom. The chair I'm sitting in isn't very visible from where Will's bed is located. My phone goes off and draws his eyes over to me. I answer my phone still red faced, \"Hi daddy.\" I stand and step out of the room to speak with my father he wants to know when I'll be coming home and I let him know, but continue to eavesdrop on Will and Ms. Cloud's conversation. \"Mom, who was that?\" I hear Will ask. With a small pause I hear his mom tell him, \"That's Kayla. She goes to school with you. She kind of saved your life today.\" My face burns once more at the credit that I'm given by Will's mom. I didn't do much of anything. \"She's not really my girlfriend then?\" Will asks curiously. His mom laughs and replies, \"No. She said that today was the first time she had ever talked to you. Even if it was to just keep you awake while the ambulance came.\" I take a few deep breaths and can feel the heat drain from my face. I walk back into the room as nonchalant as possible. \"My dad just wanted to know when I would be home,\" I let them know. \"Does he want you home any earlier sweetie? I can take you and drop you off,\" Ms. Cloud offers. I shake my head quickly. \"No ma'am, but if you'd like me to go my father is willing to pick me up. I wouldn't want to intrude on your time.\" \"You aren't an intrusion at all Kayla. I promise,\" her smile is one of comfort and reminds me of my mom's. \"Alright.\" I give her a small smile back and return to my chair, prepared to sit quietly for around the next forty five minutes. Ms. Cloud gives me a funny look. \"You aren't going to talk to us?\" She asks me. \"I just don't want to be a bother,\" I shrug. No matter what happened today it doesn't mean I know these two. Will and I haven't been friends for years or known each other for even a month. \"You aren't,\" Will volunteers. \"Thanks by the way. My mom says you saved my life. I don't remember a whole ton of that part of my day.\" I roll my eyes. \"She's overstating things. I just kept you awake for the paramedics. I didn't do anything amazing.\" \"I'm sure that it made a difference. I'm Will by the way. That way we have a sort of formal introduction,\" Will responds. I smile and introduce myself, \"I'm Kayla.\" \"Nice to meet you while I'm mostly in my right mind. I'm feeling a little drowsy actually,\" Will admits. I giggle some, \"It's called being a cheap date.\" When both Will and his mom are giving me confused looks I laugh some more. \"The sedatives from your surgery probably haven't worn off all the way. I won't be surprised if you don't remember meeting me tomorrow. It's commonly referred to as being a cheap date by lots of hospital workers. When I got my tonsils removed I apparently kept asking where I was and why I was in a bubble. I don't remember any of it.\" \"Really?\" Ms. Cloud asks me seriously. I nod. \"Absolutely.\" She frowns. \"Well that's disappointing.\" \"Or it could be fun. You could tell him a bunch of stuff that he isn't gonna remember in the morning,\" I chuckle. \"Don't do that! It's not fair,\" Will forbids. I laugh at the pouty face he makes and his mom does as well. For around the next half hour there is some general chatting and then Eloise drops by to tell us we need to head out. \"Thank you very much for coming and staying with me a while. Also for saving my life. Whether you believe that you did or not,\" Will grins. I smile back at him. \"It was truly no big deal. I just did what any normal, good person would do.\" Will's mom goes to the side of his bed and gives him a little hug. She says, \"Goodnight sweetie.\" I wave goodbye to Will and his face is the color of a tomato. At least I'm not the only one that got embarrassed tonight. The ride home with Will's mom was uneventful until the very end. When I had her take me down my driveway. \"You live here?\" She asks with disbelief. \"Yeah… My dad owns the resort,\" I answer timidly. I don't really want to brag about the benefits of having my father own the place. \"I had no idea,\" she replies still with a shocked tone. I give her an awkward smile and tell her, \"I try not to throw it around too much. I don't want that reputation or to be used.\" She nods appreciatively. \"That makes sense,\" She pauses for a moment before continuing. \"Thank you again for everything. For going with me and saving Will. I really do appreciate it.\" \"I honestly don't believe that I saved him. If anything it was the paramedics. They deserve your thanks so much more,\" I disagree. \"Thank you for the ride home though I really appreciate it.\" She sighs at my dismissal of her thanks, but responds, \"It was no problem. Have a nice night.\" I hop out of the car, \"Goodbye Ms. Cloud! I'll drop of Will's work at your shop tomorrow!\" \"Thank you sweetie,\" She rolls the window up and backs out of the driveway. I wave one last time before heading into my house. It's been months and I haven't spoken to Will since that day in the hospital. I'm positive that he doesn't remember me, but every now and then I catch him giving me an odd look. I shake it off and try not to fuss about it. Snowboarding appears to be the only thing we have in common and he's never gotten back on a board since his accident. He's off his crutches and no more cast, but he still has physical therapy for his knee. Maybe the looks are completely unrelated to that day. I've become more popular than ever before now that Nick has decided to flirt with me. I'm not quite sure how I feel about him, but he seems very sweet and he's a boarder too. We would be able to practice together and that's something. Nick and I have become an item and a few more months have passed since the accident. I ran into Will in the hallway. Literally, ran into him and about knocked him down. For a second I was sure that I'd jogged his memory, but he shook his head and we parted ways. I guess I was right about one thing from that day. He really doesn't remember me. I sometimes run into Ms. Cloud and we'll chat for a few moments. Every conversation with her ends with a thank you. I keep dismissing her sentiments of gratitude, but she doesn't give up on it. I don't know why I still care about this boy that I've never really spoken to, but I do. Today was absolutely horrible. The dogs at the kennel had been horrible. I'd been soaked in bath water before having to chase them all around the mountain for Ms. Cloud. I'd offered to help her in the shop on days that her son was busy before, but now it was awkward because it was supposed to be a punishment. Then I'd been publicly dumped by my boyfriend right after I was kicked off of my snowboarding team. I burst into the shop with the dogs finally under my control and on their leashes. I'm soaked from head to toe and shivering from the mountain air. \"What happened to the sweet little dogs from last year? Do people not train their dogs anymore?\" I vent frustrated. \"What happened?\" Ms. Cloud exclaims. \"Donald. Donald happened,\" I repeat for emphasis. \"I'll admit my day had already been going horribly, but thanks to Donald I was shoved into a bath tub and then forced to chase a whole pack of dogs around the mountain. Whilst doing that I was humiliated by my now ex-boyfriend and kicked off of my team.\" I drop the leashes at my feet and the dogs take off to a corner of the shop. Ms. Cloud comes over to me and envelopes me in a hug. \"It sounds like a rough day. Let's get you over to the fire and get you something warm to drink. You're freezing.\" I'm lead to the left hand side of the shop where there is a small fireplace and an ottoman. Once I'm sat down Ms. Cloud wanders off. \"Here,\" I hear a deeper voice from over my shoulder and a towel is placed next to me. \"Oh thanks,\" I turn and smile at my helper. I don't know why the fact that it was Will shocked me so much, but it did. His smile seems forced, \"It's no problem.\" I take the towel and drape it over my shoulders to hold in a little warmth. Ms. Cloud walks back with a warm mug and makes a small noise of surprise. \"Oh! It's nice to see you two talk.\" She meanders over to me and hands over the mug. \"Why? We've never met,\" Will responds slightly confused. \"Maybe it's because she has always wanted me to meet you. She always talks about you,\" I cover quickly. I really don't want his mom to tell him that I was there at the crash. I just feel like it would be awkward and cause discomfort for both of us. The look Ms. Cloud gives me is a little awkward, but I smile at her and hope she just backs me up. \"Really mom?\" Will complains. \"I've always wanted you to meet Kayla. She's a really great person. She's really helped me out this past year,\" she compliments me and I look into my mug with rosy cheeks. \"It was nothing,\" I mutter still looking down before taking a sip of the hot cocoa she provided me. Will looks between us confused. \"What did she do?\" \"I just ran errands for her while you were busy. I don't know why she makes such a big deal of it,\" I sigh. She gives me a disapproving look, but drops the topic. \"I'm sorry your day was so horrible, sweetie.\" She sits down next to me and wraps an arm around my now toweled shoulders. \"It's all good. None of it was your fault. I blame Nick. I'll probably go home and go for a ride later to calm down,\" I inform her. \"I need the distraction.\" She squeezes my shoulders and quickly asks. \"How about Will takes you home and you can go together?\" I can see her smirk, but Will has already traveled back to the kennels and is out of sight. There's a small crash and an exclamation of, \"Ow!\" followed soon after by, \"What?\" from Will. \"You don't need to do that,\" I reject Ms. Cloud's idea and tell her, \"I'm fine. I can walk home. In fact I think I'll go home now because I have plans with my dad.\" I excuse myself and take one more sip of my cocoa before I set it down. I stand up, pull the towel from over my shoulders, and toss it into the laundry bin. \"You shouldn't walk home like that Kayla. You're going to get sick,\" Ms. Cloud scolds as any mother would. I shrug at her. \"I already trekked practically the entire mountain. What's a little ways down the road?\" She shakes her head and Will asks, \"You live down the road from here?\" I nod awkwardly. \"My father owns the resort. He built our house where the very center of this place was when it first started. Obviously we've expanded and that's not true anymore, but yeah. That's my house.\" I shrug once more and begin to head to the door. \"I'll see you tomorrow!\" I call out and the door closes behind me. I can hear Ms. Cloud call out my name, scolding me for choosing to walk in the cold, but I keep moving. She was just trying to cause trouble. A few weeks have passed and I haven't been running into Will at all. It almost seemed as though he was avoiding me. I don't understand why, but that was how it appeared. \"Hey!\" I hear a guy's voice yell from behind me. Another one shouts, \"Wait up Blondie!\" I freeze in my tracks. I'm one of the only blondes in school and scanning the crowd I don't see anyone else that fits that description. \"It's nice to finally meet you.\" I turn to see the boy's that were addressing me. \"What do you mean?\" I ask them perplexed by their statement. The pair consisted of a shorter African American boy and a bulkier, blond white guy. Both were dressed like any of the other boarders I'd met. \"We finally figured it out. Will hasn't even figured it out, but we have,\" the bigger guy tells me. My eyes widen in shock before I choose to play it cool. \"Figure what out?\" I ask them pretty convincingly. The African American boy gives me look before responding with, \"Don't play, Little Miss Hero.\" \"Shh!\" I quiet him. \"How do you know about that? Did his mom tell you?\" \"No, but you did just confirm our suspicions. So thanks,\" He responds with a little laugh. I sigh. \"What do you want? You obviously know that I haven't told him. Also I have a reason so if that's why you're hear you're not gonna convince me to spill it to him.\" \"We could just tell him…\" The blond boy suggests. \"No!\" I practically shout. Thankfully in the relatively crowded hall it doesn't make a big fuss. I continue in a more normal tone, \"Please don't\" The boys blink at my outburst, \"We won't, but can you meet with us after school at the pipe?\" the shorter boy asks. I let out another frustrated sigh. \"Yeah I suppose.\" \"Good. See you then,\" He tells me before the pair head off to their class, as I do with mine. \"So what is this about?\" I ask the boys. \"I'm going to assume you know that I'm Kayla.\" The blond speaks, \"I'm Sam and this is Dink.\" He gestures to his friend. \"We're Will's best friends,\" Dink pitches in. I nod at them, \"Alright. So why does that matter?\" \"He has dreams about you.\" Dink tells me. I sit there dumbstruck for a moment. \"Excuse me? What?\" Sam shakes his head a little. \"You make it sound creepy, Dink. They're not about you per say, but about the crash and the girl that kept him alive until the medics came.\" I look at them both in disbelief. \"You're lying.\" \"No. We're not I promise. He wants to meet that girl. The doctor told him that her keeping him awake saved him from his lungs giving out sooner,\" Sam tells me. Dink pitches in, \"You really did save his life Kayla. Thank you.\" I can't think of a response to these two boys right now. They both have just given me a lot of information to process. \"It's kind of a lot of information, isn't it?\" Sam says to Dink. Dink nods and I finally have mustered up some words. \"I can't tell him,\" I say blatantly. \"He has to remember on his own. I won't deny it if he figures it out, but I'm not going to tell him.\" The boys' eyes light up. \"Seriously?\" Sam asks sounding like he had heard he won a huge prize. I nod and the boys glance nervously at each other. \"Are we allowed to try and jog his memory?\" Dink asks cautiously. I answer hesitantly. \"I'm gonna say yes, but there have to be boundaries and I get every right to just leave and quit this whole venture with you two.\" In sync they both are celebrating with high fives and hollers. \"Whoa,\" I respond quietly, still feeling a little overwhelmed. The calm down soon and Sam asks me a question. \"Also we heard about what happened with Team Swift and we were wondering if you'd like to board with us…\" He seems almost afraid of my response. Dink jumps in with, \"We would've offered whether you agreed to help with Will or not!\" \"It's fine. It sounds good,\" I smile at the pair. \"I've missed riding with a team.\" \"Seriously?\" Sam asks me again. I nod in reply for a second time and they both grin. \"This is going to be epic,\" Sam states. I sure hope so. It has been over two weeks of the boys trying to get Will to remember that it was me that helped him at his last Fire and Ice. They'd tried having me help patch up small injuries for them, commenting on my hair, and even had me convince Will to be our coach for this Fire and Ice. None of it had worked. Not to say that I'd had faith in any of their methods. They were all pretty lame in my opinion, but I went along with their antics to keep them happy. I had promised them after all. Though I have to admit having Will as a coach was a benefit of those antics. I had improved loads by working with him and we still had a few weeks until the competition. Today we were heading out to the more rural part of the mountain to get a little more stability training. The trek up to the spot had been full of jokes and laughs and two compliments on my hair. I don't see why they haven't given that up yet. Once we've reached our destination we're going to be riding down a piece of the mountain that has a few jumps, but they aren't as well maintained as the rest of the resort. After both Dink and Sam go down I start to make my way down. I manage the first jump relatively fine, the next one almost perfectly, but the one after that I completely bomb it. Next thing I know I'm sprawled like a starfish in the loose powdery snow. The boys have all approached me, but Sam and Dink stay a ways back. They both have small glints of hope in their eyes. \"I'm fine,\" I groan. \"After all it's the only way things will get better .\" Will looks shocked at my response. \"It was you,\" he whispers. I push myself out of the snow and onto my feet. The back of my mind barely registers a pair of shocked faces behind Will. \"What do you mean?\" \"You were the one that helped me at Fire and Ice last year,\" He states. \"You were the one that saved my life.\" Every part of me is screaming to laugh it off and deny it, but I can't. Especially not in front of Dink and Sam. So I simply say, \"Yes?\" \"Why on Earth didn't you tell me?\" He grabs both of my shoulders and gives me a slight shake. I shrug a little and answer him. \"You needed to remember on your own.\" He looks at me as though I've grown a second head. \"That's stupid!\" \"Well you know now,\" I tell him. \"Almost a year later!\" He practically shouts. I widen my eyes in an unamused manner. \"I'm sorry? What do you want from me?\" \"I have always felt this debt towards some girl that I thought I never knew and it's been you and you never told me!\" He exclaims I nod. \"Pretty much sums it up.\" He looks bewildered. \"Why not?\" \"Because I didn't help you that day in the hopes that I would get something out of it. I helped you because it was what was right. I don't want someone in my debt or for you to feel like you are because in my eyes you aren't,\" I explain. His voice has calmed down considerably and may even now be quieter than a traditional speaking tone. \"I had these dreams about the girl that saved me and they scared me away. I have liked you for quite sometime, but those dreams made me feel like I couldn't have a girlfriend and they've been about you! It's seriously irritating.\" Now it's my turn to be shocked. I stand there completely still and silent for a moment before Will has kissed me quickly. It was enough to set Dink and Sam into a practically hysterical celebration, that effectively cut the kiss short. \"Thank you for saving my life, Kayla,\" Will whispers. \"I'd do it again. Any time. Any place,\" I answer. I lean up to kiss him again. If the pair of idiots are going to shout anyway then I'm at least going to enjoy my time. AN- This chapter I actually cut short. I was going to make it longer, but I wanted to update today. Maybe one day I'll come back to it and add the rest in because while drafting it in my head it was much longer. This has not been edited. It is three in the morning. So deal with it. Also what Kayla says that is italicized was something she said to Will when she saved him. So that's why it triggered his memory.[Chapter 8] AN- Thanks once more to LoveShipper! She's reviewed every single chapter and is an amazing person!:) This one will be much shorter than others. It's the way things worked out. I already have three assignments and the first day of class isn't for several days. Consolation Will had taken the lead in Fire and Ice for the first run. The tension was high between the Hot Doggers and Team Swift. There were some dirty looks being exchanged as well as nervous glances. Kayla was wringing her hands in anticipation. Will is about to take his final run and he does it beautifully. She screams and cheers with the boys and hugs Will tightly when he returns to his team. They whole team stands in anticipation just waiting to watch the last run for the men's competition. It's Nick's run and he has to score quite well to beat Will. Once Nick begins his run the quartet falls into an intense hush. They're all standing a bundle of nerves just waiting for it to be over and to learn the winner. When Nick receives his score from the judges the audience cheers and all of Team Swift start hollering. Will and his team stand a little numb before he breaks the silence. \"That was pretty impressive. I've got some work to do.\" \"Hey. Not bad for taking a year off,\" Kayla grins at Will, nudging him in the side. He grins back at her, \"Just wait until you see me next year.\" \"You're gonna be great, but as of this year I'm pretty sure I've got a decent consolation prize for you,\" she tells him. Will smiled at her compliment, but his face transformed into one of uncertainty when she mentioned a consolation prize. \"What do you mean by that?\" \"C'mere,\" She says softly and motions with her finger. He gives her a slightly weary look, just waiting for the punch line. After the stunt she'd pulled with Sebastian earlier can you blame him for being slightly suspicious of the girl's behavior? Who knows what she was actually planning? When she just sits there expectantly he leans down to her level. \"Is it some sort of secret?\" He inquires. \"Not at all,\" She giggles. \"Well it won't be at least…\" His confusion only grows. \"What does that mean?\" He asks her. When her only response is more laughter he continues. \"Alright. Well are you going to tell me?\" He asks even more baffled. Kayla grins at him for a moment. She's becoming quite amused with his impatience and worry. \"Maybe I'll just wait until after my run…\" She teases. \"Now that isn't fair and you know it!\" He exclaims as he straightens back up. \"This is practically torture! Just tell me!\" She shrugs. \"It may be, but you're just being impatient now.\" Will frowns at her. \"Of course I'm being impatient! You are not being very nice today!\" Her grin has grown in amusement and she laughs. \"Fine, fine. Now come back here,\" Kayla commands. Once Will has come back down to her level she leans in and kisses him. When she pulls away her smile is more nervous, \"Congratulations?\" Her statement sounds more like a question in this case. \"That was my consolation prize?\" He asks her. She frowns at his seemingly negative response. \"Well yeah…\" Her voice trails off in insecurity. \"I'm sorry, but for some reason I feel like the real winner now,\" He laughs. Kayla punches him in the shoulder. \"Don't do that! You scared me,\" she scolds him. \"You started it!\" He exclaims still laughing. Kayla opens her mouth to protest, but realizes that he is actually right. \"Well! Um… So!\" She stutters out. Will raises his eyebrows, it's his turn to be amused. \"Nice comeback.\" Kayla punches him in the shoulder again and sticks her tongue out childishly. \"Oh. I'm so scared,\" Will says in mock fear. He puts his hands up as though to surrender. \"You should be,\" she says attempting to sound threatening. He makes a face before inquiring, \"Shouldn't you be preparing for your first run? It should be coming up soon.\" She sighs, almost not wanting to leave due to the fun she's having. \"I suppose I should go and do that.\" She collects her board and goes to head back up to the top of the pipe. \"What do you think you're doing?\" He asks her incredulously. It's her turn to stare at him befuddled while he laughs. \"Going to get ready for my run like you just mentioned…\" He laughs some more and says, \"C'mere.\" She rolls her eyes and walks back to him. He leans in and kisses her quick. \"Good luck. You're gonna do amazing.\" She smiles and replies, \"I'm feeling pretty lucky.\" Kayla takes off to the top of the mountain before Will hears a chorus of, \"Dude! Did that just happen?\" Will just nods and grins. That was one heck of a consolation prize. AN- I tried to make this one as long as I could manage, but it just seemed like this was the length that fit it best. Originally it didn't have most of the beginning and I added that in. I could've lengthened it to the end of the competition, but it is entitled Consolation and Kayla has no need for a consolation prize. I hope you all have a wonderful day.[Chapter 9] AN- I had a few days where I was unable to write ahead of time and I am now posting chapters immediately after they are completed. This story may slow down some. I have to be honest. I use plenty of foul language in my everyday life. Does anyone have an opinion on it in this story? The rating would go up to T if I were to begin to put any into the story. Thanks to LoveShipper for reviewing! Pool It had been a long day for Kayla and Will. Kayla had almost killed herself in an avalanche and Will had just about worried himself to death over it. By the time Kayla had convinced Will to come over for a swim and 'make sure she didn't drown' his inner turmoil had almost settled. He was coming and he would do just that. He was going to make sure that Kayla didn't drown. It didn't keep him from never taking his eyes off of her though. He was definitely not going to be caught off guard this time. She had already scared him out of his wits once today and he was making absolutely sure that she was floating above water. \"You don't have to watch me like a hawk you know?\" She laughs at him. Kayla had attempted to ignore his intense stares all night, but it was getting almost unbearable, even if it was almost flattering that he was worried about her so much. \"I promise I'm not gonna slip under the water and drown. Only one near death experience per day thanks.\" Her smile is easy and genuine while she's with Will. Eve if he is blatantly staring at her all day long. Will coughs and looks away from her in a way that was most definitely not obvious at all. Kayla laughs again. \"Smooth,\" She remarks at his completely non discreet way of averting his eyes. He grins at her allowing himself to look back to her once more. \"You said it earlier that I had to make sure you didn't drown. I thought that's why I was here.\" He makes a silly face at her to diffuse any tension there could have been. \"Absolutely,\" she rolls her eyes. \"There's no way it's just because you're my friend and I enjoy your company.\" Will makes a face of mock offense at her comment. \"Of course not! We all know I'm simply a glorified life guard. I save damsels from all situations,\" he fights down a laugh and begins to gesticulate wildly. \"Drowning, falling from heights, stuck in a tree,\" he lowers his voice and emphasizes the next words \"even avalanches .\" \"It was one time!\" Kayla retorts a little loud. \"It was today!\" Will responds and matches her volume. Kayla answers back much calmer, but still with a large teasing smile, \"Touché…\" Will shakes his head at her goofy, free spirited personality. \"There's no way to fight that point. It was today. In fact no more than twelve hours ago!\" He exclaims. \"This is why you need the life guard. The last time there was an endangerment of your life was within twenty-four hours! You could die and that's just no good Kayla!\" The pair are chuckling again and have drifted closer together in the pool. \"So Mr. Rescue Guy… Do you have any idea what you should do when someone is drowning?\" Kayla asks slyly. Maybe, just maybe he will take the hint. \"Well, you should perform CPR and mouth to mouth on them,\" he answers her, not quite picking up on her tone and what she's really hoping for. The couple have floated even closer to each other and are now within touching distance. \"Oh really?\" Kayla asks lightly. \"Mm hmm,\" Will murmurs. Both of them are only inches away from the other, staring into each other's eyes with an intensity neither of them had seen from the other person before. \"Will?\" Kayla asks without breaking eye contact. Will answers back promptly, almost as though he was in a trance, \"Yeah?\" \"I think I might be drowning,\" She states ridiculously. He blinks at her as she is clearly not drowning, nor anywhere close to drowning before he realizes what she actually means. \"Well we can't have that now can we?\" His question is left hanging in the air between them, but it was meant to be rhetorical anyway. The pair couldn't tell you who initiates their first kiss or even their second or third, but they could tell you that the feeling is like nothing they imagined. Not the fireworks Kayla has always pictured in her mind from when she was a little girl or the burning sensation Will's mom always mentions. The couple only senses a feeling of total completeness. As if the pair of them are never truly whole before they have that moment. The duo are feeling pure bliss until the minute they break away with foggy minds. They were breathing heavy when Kayla's mom brought them towels and when asked Kayla laughs her questions off and tells her that they were racing laps for training for Fire and Ice. Their hearts are certainly beating fast enough for their bodies to confirm Kayla's small fib. Kayla feels like she ran an entire marathon today and supposes that she had, had a pretty productive day. When Kayla bids Will goodbye for the night she knows that she is the one to lean in for that kiss and it feels just as magical as all the others had. She has infinite hopes for the next morning when she sees him because he really does complete her. She's sure now that Will and her won't be some fluke or fling. Her and Will are going to go the distance as long as she has something to say about it. AN- This chapter isn't too long or edited. I hope you enjoy it. Review.[Chapter 10] AN- Ten chapters wow… Tomorrow is the day of my move in to university… I have no chapters written in advance because I was so busy this past week. I hope I manage an update for y'all… Also I'm legitimately running out of new ideas and even though I still have over a dozen to write it makes me nervous not to have options. Fire The icy snowboarding competition brought in most of the attraction at the resort, but they didn't call it Fire and Ice for no reason. The boarders had another six months to train themselves for the other half of the competition. It was a simple swimming competition, but a lot of boarders struggled with it. This was a blanket statement for almost the entire Hot Doggers team. Swimming was not their strong suit and from what they heard, Team Swift had been working hard on their techniques and were surely going to put up a strong fight for the win. \"Now why do we have to do this again?\" Sam complained loudly. He was not a fan of swimming at all and typically ignored this portion of the competition completely, much less participated in it. He didn't want to be here at all. Dink's groan showed his distaste as well as the pair stood outside of the pool. \"Seriously. This is not cool man.\" Will rolls his eyes from within the pool. \"Because we're doing this right guys. Especially now that we actually qualify for team titles since Kayla joined us. You've got to be willing to try.\" \"Yeah! Don't be such wimps!\" Kayla is heard shouting from the changing room. Dink raises an eyebrow at her comment. \"if we're the ones being wimps then why are we the ones actually ready to get this over with!\" He huffs at her. \"It takes a little more time for me to get ready,\" Kayla remarks casually as she bumps the door open with her hip and steps out. Both of her hands are over to one side braiding her hair to keep it out of the way. For casual fun swimming she would have left it down, but when she's training she needs to have some semblance of control over the mop on her head. \"I've got this thing called hair and it tends to get in the way when you do things like swim competitively.\" Her hands move swiftly to the end of her hair and she wraps a hair band around it to secure the braid. She tosses it behind her and looks up to the boys all gawking. \"How do you do that?\" Will asks. \"Do what?\" She repeats the question mildly confused. Sam speaks this time, \"Your hair. Your hands moved so quick it was almost like magic.\" She gives them disbelieving looks. \"That?\" She pulls at the braid unconsciously for a moment. \"It's easy. I guess I just have a lot of practice, but it's not hard at all. I could teach you, but I'm not sure why you'd want to learn.\" She shrugs at the end of her spiel and the boys fall out of their trance. \"Girl stuff is weird,\" Dink concludes before his shoved into the water. \"Why?\" He yells once he's above water again. He's sputtering and rubbing his eyes. Kayla laughs. \"I figured it was the easiest way to get you in the water!\" \"Now you have to get in so we can practice,\" Will tells her. She grins and takes a short running start before cannonballing into the warm pool. \"Done,\" Her smile just as large as previously even while wiping the water from her eyes. \"Alright. Let's get to it.\" Practicing for three hours in Kayla's heated pool everyday wasn't the worst part of everyone's day. Especially because they had lengthened the practices to three hours because they were goofing off too much and needed the extra time. For two of the members of Hot Doggers it was their favorite part. Sam and Dink enjoyed their time, but not nearly as much as Will and Kayla. The pair were always the last to leave though Kayla never really did because it was her home, but it hadn't gone unnoticed by Will's best friends that Will was there alone with Kayla everyday for at least five minutes. They had yet to figure out when Will was actually leaving Kayla's house. After somehow getting sidetracked for weeks and never actually learning what was happening between the other half of their team the competition was upon them. Fire and Ice's swimming competition was much more casual than other swim meets. The main focus was on the Ice portion after all so essentially the Fire element was brought in to make the snowboarders a little uncomfortable and get a good laugh. Though the more competitive teams really did try to win. This year everyone's top two were Team Swift and Hot Doggers. Support for both groups had brought in a much bigger audience than the event had gained in many years. Just walking through the door you could see there were even some fangirls and boys there. Kayla had been dragged off by seven different boys by the end of the first hour and had been proposed to twice in the first three hours. Dink and Sam were incredibly amused by the attention she was receiving. Mostly because Will's reaction was bordering on rage, but he was clearly trying to suppress his feelings and doing a poor job of it. It didn't help that Kayla blooms under praise and even though she left the marriage proposals with an embarrassed blush on her face, Will was still pretty jealous. Kayla had also noticed Will's reactions all day. The races weren't starting for another three hours, but check in and coach's meetings had been taking place throughout the whole day. She grabbed Will by the wrist and excused them from the group. Needless to say he was confused, but went along with only a befuddled, \"What's happening?\" She doesn't answer him and pulls him down a hallway and around a corner to an empty corridor. \"Look. I'm not stupid and I'm kind of offended that you expect me to believe this façade you've been putting up all day.\" He stands there shocked at her accusation before answering her, \"I don't think you're stupid at all.\" \"Then why on Earth have you been letting those guys hang all over me today?\" She asks angrily before going on to rant, \"I know that you like me. Even if I couldn't be sure before, and believe that I had a pretty strong suspicion, but today just confirmed it because you haven't genuinely smiled once. You've glared at every guy that's even glanced at me and I'm surprised that you haven't drowned the two boys that proposed to me. So stop questioning my intelligence by acting as though I can't notice it.\" She lets out a deep breath at her confession and Will can't help, but stare. \"How long did you know? I was pretty sure today that you would figure it out, but before I honestly thought I had everyone fooled…\" He trails off a little embarrassed. She sighs at the boy she's had a crush on for months. \"I've known since before the Cloud 9. I've just been waiting. I don't know why I've been waiting, but I have.\" Will's head is reeling. The Cloud 9 was over half a year ago and she had been waiting. Waiting for him to get his act together, but he never thought she'd ever reciprocate his feelings so he tried to hide them. Unsuccessfully, but he really had tried. \"I'm sorry,\" he apologizes honestly. \"Is that it?\" Kayla asks bluntly. Will is feeling a little overwhelmed by everything that is happening and so when Kayla gets tired of waiting for an answer he doesn't protest. After all the kiss they share was something he doesn't regret. It was probably the best part of his day. Though beating Nick wasn't half bad either. AN- I hope this wasn't too bad. As always I hope you enjoyed and this wasn't edited.[Chapter 11] AN- Alright. First night in the new dorm… Not too bad. I hope my roommate doesn't think I'm crazy. Zach and Jake are my OCs. Also Kayla's cousin that is mentioned. So there. MINE. Jealous He didn't want to admit it at all. He was being unreasonable and unrealistic. He had no rights to what she did or who she spoke to. No matter how often he thought about the possibility of becoming more of a permanent fixture in her life with a stronger opinion. He still hadn't done anything about it and it was all his fault. This jealousy is completely his fault and nothing was going to change that fact. She hadn't done anything to solve the problem that she was very much aware of. She could have made it easier on him and told him that he was pretty safe to make his move, but she didn't. She thought both his insecurity and mild jealousy were adorable and was wondering how long he would allow it to go on for. She wasn't even that much of a flirty person, but when it came to instilling this reaction in Will she could go a little more out of her way. After all it was kind of fun for her and it was harmless overall. Kayla wasn't the only one that was amused with Will's reactions to her flirtatious behavior. His two best friends had both told him time and time again to make his move. Will had never took their well informed advice and now he was suffering through Kayla's little bit of revenge. Sam and Dink both had placed bets on when Will would finally snap over Kayla's mind games. Sam was sure that it would be at least another two weeks, but Dink was confident that Kayla could get him to break before that. The pair had twenty dollars on the table, but it was mostly for fun. Kayla's latest episode was going down currently. She didn't actually know that Will was there yet, but her relationship with Zach had always been a touch more than friendly. They had known each other for many years and knew that dating was not in their cards. Zach had actually been dating one of her cousins for the past few years and she was extremely comfortable with the friendship between Kayla and Zach. As the pair laughed loudly at an old story Zach wrapped an arm over Kayla's shoulder to guide her to her next class. Will had walked up behind Zach and Kayla's loud laughter and watched them together for a minute. It sparked a heat in his chest that was becoming much too familiar as of late. He wasn't proud of his jealousy, but it was his reality for the time being. When Zach put his arm around Kayla's shoulders Will took a deep calming breath. He really needed to learn to get used to this or finally take a chance. It was funny how he would rather risk his life on a snowboard everyday than even think about asking this wonderful girl out. He was sure that they had at least some chemistry. He had almost kissed her in her pool before Fire and Ice, but her mom had came in and interrupted his moment of bravery. For some reason he had never seemed to be able to gather the courage to try again. Courage was the perfect way to describe it because Will was absolutely being a coward, and that he wasn't proud of. Dink and Sam had sworn that they would have no part in swaying Will's choice either way, but Dink didn't promise that he wouldn't ask Kayla to step it up for him. When he spoke to her about it she took it on as a challenge. This was going to be one crazy week for Will Cloud because Kayla was going to be pulling out all the tricks for one last final shot. Kayla wasn't sure if this would work, but Zach had agreed to help her for her last attempt at getting Will to make his move. Zach had brought up an excellent point of why she couldn't make the first move, but Kayla had already accepted the challenge from Dink and she wasn't going to back down. She was pretty confident that this performance by her and Zach would shove Will over the proverbial edge and he would finally just act on his feelings for her. It wasn't like Sam and Dink hadn't already told her that he was incredibly into her. She had no doubts in her mind about that. The simple problem was getting Will to choose to admit his fondness for her. Will had been feeling on edge all day at school. He felt like he was buzzing all over as if he had ten cups of coffee, but he hadn't had a single sip of the beverage. He didn't know what to think about his nerves. They were all over the place and he was very nearly close to calling home from the oddness of it all. Something was holding him back from walking down to the office to call his mom for a ride home though. He wasn't sure how he knew that today was going to be special, but his body could sense it as though the air was charged with a warning of what was to come for him later. Kayla was nervous about the stunt she was pulling today, but it was time to really try hard to get Will to realize that he needed to make a move. She wasn't going to be young forever and though she would wait for him to an extent she'd rather not have to wait honestly. It was ten minutes until the bell and then the plan would begin. At lunch Kayla was standing in the direct view of Will with Lindsey and Pia. Her back was facing Zach's older cousin Jake whom she hadn't seen in almost a year. He had gone to college and they hadn't had time to catch up. Zach and Kayla figured that this killed two birds with one stone and Jake was up for a little mischief ninety percent of the time. Jake shouts to Kayla across the cafeteria. She spins on her heel and with a short running start jumps into his outstretched arms. He spins her around a few times and they both laugh loudly in complete joy at seeing each other again. They're being stared at, but they ignore it. It doesn't matter how many eyes are on them as long as Will's are. They begin talking when Jake puts Kayla back down on the ground. Both of them proclaiming how much they missed each other over the year and general chitchat. Jake grabs Kayla's hand and they walk back to her friends to hang out for the rest of the lunch period. Will is extremely frustrated about lunch. Kayla seems to have an endless supply of guys that are all over her and it isn't making his life any easier. When he's waiting for her at the mountain he begins to psych himself up for trying to finally tell her everything. Maybe her can finally do it. When she's finally in his view he loses his breath at how flawless she looks, but stands as firm as possible. He can't let it intimidate him. He's going to get through this. She waves at him and he raises a hand back in a half hearted attempt to respond. Once she reaches him Will simply leans down and presses their lips together. If they listened close enough the pair could've heard Dink's cheers and Sam's sigh of disappointment before admitting that he was glad it was finally over. AN- Another chapter down… I can't believe I'm keeping up with this…[Chapter 12] AN- Welcome to chapter twelve. Thanks to LoveShipper for her lovely reviews. She reviews every time and I appreciate it a lot. Survive I feel exhilarated. It is such a rush to race down the face of Tyson's Peak on my board on this lovely day. I am the first person to ever do it and if I can outrun this avalanche then I can live to tell the tale. My adrenaline is racing and I am pushing through as hard as I can. I need to make it out of this. I have too much life left to live because after all I am only in high school. Boarding down the mountain may not have been the wisest idea of mine, but I am starting to feel like I'm pulling away from the mounds of snow that are barreling towards me. I lean lower to the ground to increase my speed more because I really want to beat this. My speed gives me even more distance and I can see a snow mobile coming towards us. I wave my arms to the best of my ability telling the rider to turn around. I don't want them to die because of me. When they turn the vehicle around, but don't leave I pray that they will save them-self before they let the barrage of falling snow kill them. I feel like the roar of the sliding snow quiets and I pass the snow mobile. It's silent as quickly as the emergency had began and I stop my board swiftly. I immediately release my feet and turn around to check on the snowmobiler. When I see both vehicle and operator unscathed I release a deep breath. \"Are you alright?\" I call out to them. I pull my goggles off of my face and stand in my spot for a moment. They get off of the snowmobile and I notice Donald is with them before their helmet is being removed to reveal Will. \"Am I alright?\" He shouts back incredulously. \"Am I alright?\" He repeats himself for emphasis sounding almost in disbelief. \"I was just being nice…\" I say loudly enough for him to hear from our distance. Donald is running over to me and I welcome the pooch to me with open arms. \"Hey buddy!\" Will is stomping his way through the snow towards me and Donald. \"Are you okay?\" He asks me with a twinge of concern in his voice. He's calmed down significantly from those moments ago. \"I'm absolutely fine Will. I was barely touched by even a single flake,\" I tell him with a bit of exaggeration. He looks me over once as though to confirm I was telling him the truth. \"Alright,\" He speaks as though that's the end of the conversation. Then he reaches out and smacks me in the arm. \"Um. What was that for?\" I ask him truthfully wondering. He didn't hit me to cause pain because I could've been lying in the snow in agony if that was his goal. \"If you ever do anything that stupid again I will hurt you. You could've died Kayla!\" He exclaims. \"I'm sorry?\" My reply comes out more like a question. He gives me a half hearted glare. \"I'm serious Kayla. That was incredibly dangerous and stupid and irresponsible. It's not okay,\" He scolds gently. \"Yes sir,\" I mock salute him and he grimaces. I give him a laugh and then say, \"I promise not to die or severely injury myself doing something that could be deemed stupid by others around me.\" Will raises an eyebrow at me and responds, \"It doesn't really work like that.\" I shake my head. \"Sure it does.\" He rolls his eyes before looking at me softly. \"Please don't ever do anything that crazy ever again. I don't think I could handle it.\" \"Hmm?\" I hum quietly in confusion. \"I can't afford to lose you Kayla. It's only been a few weeks of knowing each other and I already feel attached to you. I don't know why or how we got so close so fast, but losing you isn't an option anymore. You don't understand how much you mean to me already. Just trust me when I say it's a lot,\" He explains gently and slowly. I'm almost in shock of his beautiful words. The way he's describing it all makes me feel phenomenal and I decide to push my luck. \"Well how much do I mean to you? What's the difference between now and a few weeks ago?\" These are genuine questions, but I'm hoping that Will's answers are leaning towards the option of us becoming more than what we are now. I really do like Will and it did come on fast like what he described to me. \"Well it would be pretty easy for me to show you what I mean instead of tell you,\" He suggests. \"I'm having a little trouble with the words right now.\" I nod in response to his question. \"Sure. Actions do speak louder than words so if you feel like showing me will have more of an impact then go for it!\" I encourage him. He nods quick and then he takes a step towards me and we're pressed together. He places his lips to mine and I'm content with the world. I have been hoping for something like this for a few days now and I'm really glad that I managed to beat the avalanche today. I have a feeling that my life would be a lot different. Even had I survived another way. I had beaten Mother Nature and that made me feel unbreakable. Our kiss really could have only lasted a few seconds, but it was enough for me. I was ecstatic about this development and made a silly remark, \"Maybe I should almost die more often.\" I suggest to Will with a shrug. He shakes his head at me and in a stern voice answers. \"Please no.\" AN- Another day another chapter.[Chapter 13] AN- Chapter 13! I start classes tomorrow morning so I'm super nervous, but I have faith everything will go well. After We have just won Fire and Ice and the after party is just about kicking up. We're later than most guests because we had to change out of our gear and in my case fix myself up to look much better than the sweaty mess I was after the competition. I hadn't wanted to take too much time so I just straightened my hair after a shower and applied my make up quickly with great skill. I had slipped into the blue shimmery loose dress I was wearing and dashed out the door to meet the boys here. Will and I hadn't seen each other except for a few moments across the room. He was being bombarded by a big crowd. Most of which were girls that seemed to realize that Will wasn't a weird guy that could've been something, but was actually an amazing person that deserved everything in the whole world. It bothered me slightly that they wanted him now because of his success at Fire and Ice, but I refused to let it get to me. Will wasn't stupid and he had to have realized that, that was what was happening. I tried to focus on having a good time myself. I was dancing with Sam for a fun dance song, but even the infectious beat couldn't distract me from the topic for very long. I was worrying way too much about Will. He can take care of himself. As though he could sense where my thoughts had drifted from across the room Will brushed the girls off and set out towards me. He tapped Sam on the shoulder and shooed him away from me. Sam gave him a thumbs up and danced away. \"It seems like we haven't talked all night!\" Will shouts over the music. I shout back, \"We haven't! Not since we won to be accurate!\" I agree with him. He agrees with me with a nod. \"True. Are you alright?\" He asks concerned. \"I'm fine,\" I tell him with a fake smile and a nod. He shakes his head at me, but takes one of my hands and drags me towards the balcony. \"Honesty time. What's wrong?\" I sigh when he pushes me. I don't want to have to talk to him about it because he'll think that it is stupid of me. \"I don't want to talk about it Will. That's honest.\" \"That answer is irrelevant so there's that. Let's try that again. What's wrong Kayla?\" He asks me again. I drop my shoulders in resignation. I suppose I should just tell him and get it over with. He won't leave it be if I don't anyway. \"I was just being dumb and worrying about you falling for those girls and their tricks. I didn't want you to forget that they were all rude to you when it was your hardest time and were only wanting to be around you for the fame.\" Will gives me a soft smile. \"I appreciate your concern and I would never let that happen. Besides I kind of have a girl I that I have my eye on.\" His look is one of absolute bliss. My heart breaks at his statement, but I'm sure I hid it well. \"Oh? Who?\" I ask curious about the girl that has made Will so lovestruck. \"You know? I never really liked these, but maybe things will be different this time,\" Will changes the subject. I give him a perplexed look. \"So she's here?\" I wonder why that's the statement he chose to respond with to my question. He nods. \"I hang out with her a lot actually, but she's kind of oblivious and we definitely have our differences.\" My mind is reeling and I'm fumbling through my memories of Will trying to find a girl that I see him with regularly. I realize quickly that I can't think of one and I ask, \"She sounds a little dumb, but who is she?\" Will bursts into laughter. It's loud and carefree. \"Kayla Morgan you have made my day,\" He speaks between laughs. \"How so?\" I ask him confused again. \"What girl am I always spending time with?\" He asks me seriously after he's calmed down. The grin on his face stretches to both of his ears in amused joy. I shrug at him. \"I can't think of one.\" His smile disappears and is replaced with a look that is absolutely unamused with my apparent ignorance. \"Not a single one? At all?\" \"Well… No,\" I tell him once more wondering why he keeps asking me a question I clearly don't have the answer to. He shakes his head at me. \"Kayla Morgan you are an absolute idiot sometimes,\" He takes my face in his hands and brings our lips together. My eyes pop open in shock, but slip shut soon after. I wasn't even considering myself as the girl Will was speaking of. It was apparently something I should've done. When he pulls away I open my eyes back up and I am met with the biggest smile I think Will has ever had. It rivals even the smile that was on his face earlier when he was laughing so hard he was almost in tears. \"So do you understand now?\" \"Yeah,\" I shrug. \"Do you like these parties more?\" I ask him both curious and joking. He nods. \"This one has turned out much better for me than any of the others,\" He smiles at me again, \"So do you want to go dance?\" He holds out a hand for me and I immediately reach out and take it. \"I would like nothing more,\" I grin and he pulls me back inside to the dance floor. AN- This one is decent I guess. Thirteen's my favorite number I just have no time to make this special.[Chapter 14] AN- Chapter 14 is finally here! My first day of classes wasn't too horrible… I couldn't think of the name of their high school so I avoided using it. Whoops. Thanks to LoveShipper (as always!) and ellie111lee for their reviews! Court It was the beginning of Senior year for the Hot Doggers and winning at Fire and Ice last year had brought the team into the spotlight at school. Kayla had already had experience as a popular girl, but the guys were having a little trouble adjusting to the not so subtle stares from underclassmen girls. \"It's making me uncomfortable,\" Sam admits to Kayla as they walk down to lunch. She laughs at the complete honesty on his face. \"Sam it's fine. Just ignore them because they won't go away.\" \"Are you serious dude?\" Dink asks him looking offended. \"This is great! I'm definitely going to get a date for Homecoming this year!\" \"Is that really your main concern?\" Kayla scoffs at Dink's reasoning. Dink shrugs. \"Well it'll be nice to not get turned down by every girl in the school for once. What about you Will? How are you doing with all of this?\" Will shrugs as well. \"I'm mostly just ignoring it. I'm not too concerned with it all. They might stare at me, but they don't really know me or care about me. I definitely don't want a girl that just wants me for the attention. It would be a waste of time.\" \"Preach!\" Sam pitches in to agree with Will's statement. He was most definitely looking for a girl that actually cared for him and not the guy that won Fire and Ice. \"That's good sense Will,\" Kayla compliments. She misses the nudges from Sam and Dink to Will. The quartet have entered the cafeteria and head through the line to receive their meals. Once they've completed that task they head to a table and sit down. There are a few minutes of peaceful small talk before the PA system dings alerting the students to an announcement. The speaker crackles a moment and then the sound of the peppy head cheerleader comes on overhead. \"Hello everyone! It is now time to announce our 2015 Homecoming Court!\" The girl babbles out the names of the underclassmen candidates and small shrieks of delight are heard around the room. Once she moves on to seniors the room falls to a hush, but Kayla, unconcerned, pays more attention to her salad than the voice from above. Homecoming didn't seem like something that was her thing. Every year five cheerleaders were on court and the most popular of the bunch was named Queen and Kayla simply didn't care enough to tune into the broadcast. Odds are the girl that was speaking was the Queen anyway. There are loud celebrations after each name is called except for the last. When the last girl's name is called there are only two sole shrieks from two tables over as the entire school is in amazement at what has happened. The clicking of heels on tile can be heard and Linds and Pia are behind Kayla hugging her tightly. \"What?\" She asks them oblivious to her candidacy. \"You weren't listening?\" Pia blurts angrily at one of her best friends. Kayla answers, \"No. It's always cheerleaders. Why would I bother?\" \"Because you've been nominated for Homecoming Queen!\" Pia replies excited. Kayla's face transforms to one of shock. She's so absorbed in her own thoughts as the male nominees are announced that she doesn't notice Sam's celebration at the sound of his name from the speaker. Dink fist bumps him and Will gives him a side hug in a small celebration of his achievement while the next boy is recognized. The school falls silent for the announcement of the final name and the cheerleader says with finality, \"and lastly, the final nominee for Homecoming King, William Cloud.\" Dink and Sam jump from their seats and shout for joy. The football team is chanting and there is uproar in the cafeteria. \"What?\" is the first thing to fall from Will's lips at the announcement. Sam throws an arm around him. \"Congratulations man!\" \"This is insane,\" Will mumbles as the buzz from the room settles. The cheerleader has long since finished talking about what the members of Homecoming Court were required to do and most tables had returned to old conversation. Pia and Lindsey have returned to their lunches as well. The Hot Doggers were simply amazed at the fact that three of them had made it onto court at all. \"I'm so proud of you guys!\" Dink exclaims. \"My three best friends are royalty!\" \"What I don't get is why I'm on court and you aren't dude. You have way more friends then me. You are far more outgoing!\" Sam reasons. Dink shakes his head, \"You've gotten much better and girls can really dig the kinda shy thing, but that's just what I would think.\" A cheerleader approaches the table due to the baffled expression gracing the faces of three of their court members. \"It was a really close vote this year. I think that Dink only lost by maybe ten votes,\" She explains to them. The foursome nod to her and she returns to her table. The dance was a big stressor for all four boarders, but they had varying reasons. Sam was afraid of hurting the cheerleader he had to dance with, Dink was nervous about finding a date to the dance, and Will and Kayla were nervous about each other. At first when they discovered when they'd been paired up they were excited and slowly they realized what that entailed. They had to slow dance together and that was something that had both of them in a tizzy. Just an hour before the dance Pia and Lindsey were giving Kayla the same lecture Will was receiving from Dink and Sam. \"It's going to be fine. After all you guys are best friends. There's no way you'll let anything get between you.\" Once the dance was in full swing it was time for the Royalty to be crowned and it made the butterflies in Kayla and Will's stomachs flutter harshly. The pair had avoided each other all night, but now they would finally have to see each other. \"Ladies and Gentlemen, your Homecoming King is William Cloud!\" The DJ announces with endless energy and places the large crown upon Will's head. \"And joining him for a special dance will be his Homecoming Queen… Miss Kayla Morgan!\" The cheering was deafening, but the shock on Kayla's face was all Will could even begin to focus on. He wasn't sure how she couldn't see it, but he'd known she would win since she had been nominated for court. She needed a little nudge before she finally approached him and her crown was placed on top of her head. \"Whoa,\" Kayla says breathless. Making it on court had seemed like an unreal idea to her so winning Queen was like an alternate reality. Will smirks. \"You deserve it.\" \"Not more than you,\" She remarks. The slow song they are supposed to dance to begins to play, Kayla takes Will's proffered hand, and they begin to dance. The pair are feeling a strong intensity between them, but they moved closer. Will smiles at Kayla and whispers, \"You look gorgeous by the way.\" She blushes at the kind words and responds in kind. \"You look handsome as well.\" Before they can register what they're doing they move even closer and are kissing in front of everyone. They don't register the whoops and hollers from their peers because all that matters to them is right in their arms. AN- A much better chapter in my opinion. I really like this one. If I didn't have to sleep I would've written it slightly different.[Chapter 15] AN- Chapter 15. Wow… It's so weird… Seriously though guys! Make requests and be as creative as possible! Every little bit helps and if I tell you I already had that idea don't be offended! I just want you to know that so if you want something that is your idea and yours alone you can have it! Injured When I planned this whole thing out there was something that I never really considered and now sitting here in my hospital bed I was regretting some of my choices. Definitely the more reckless ones. ***FLASHBACK*** I am going to convince him I'm sure of it. Will has been stubborn about the idea of me attempting the Cloud 9. Even after I went racing down Tyson's peak he was skeptical about teaching me. I am giving it one last effort to earn his trust and get him to teach me. He had already told me the components of the move about a week ago. I really just needed his guidance and maybe a few examples. \"You ready for practice?\" Will asks me with a grin as he approaches me on the pipe. I nod. \"I'm ready for anything,\" I tell him with intensity to show how serious I am about it all. He acts as if I'd said any normal statement and nods as well. \"Alright. Then lets get started!\" He claps his hands together and tells me what he'd like me to do on my first run through. I perform it flawlessly and I'm sure that it's one of the most important runs I've ever had. If my skill doesn't impress him this time then I know he will never believe that I am ready. \"How was that?\" I ask him while removing my goggles. I have an answer in mind and if he said it was anything less than amazing heads were going to roll. Namely his head for attempting to downplay my success. \"That was magnificent Kayla!\" Will exclaims once I'm in front of him. \"It's the best run I've seen you have all month! I think you might be ready to move on to something a little harder.\" I give him a curious look simply because I don't have the courage to ask him what I really want to know. He just nods at me and grins. \"You're going to want to watch this next trick. It is the first part on the way to mastering the Cloud 9.\" I clap my hands a few times and let out an excited squeal. I throw my arms around his shoulders in thanks. \"Thank you!\" He pats my back for a moment with a laugh, \"You have to let me go so I can show you the first part of the trick,\" He warns me. I immediately pull away from and mock salute him with a light hearted, \"Yes sir!\" Will rolls his eyes at me and begins to strap his board to his feet. The more time that passes the more keyed up I become, but soon Will is standing on the edge of the pipe and falling in to perform an impressive trick. I follow him down and copy him to a T. I don't know how I've been so lucky today, but my jumps have all been on point and I can't wait to get to try the entire Cloud 9. Will moves me through the motions on the trick quickly as I speed through the steps with amazing accuracy. \"I'm ready,\" I state plainly to Will after another excellent run. \"I want to try it.\" \"Are you sure?\" Will asks cautiously. I know he has a bit of a fear regarding the trick and I nod once more enthusiastically. \"I'm positive,\" I tell him my previous intensity returning. He nods his head a small bit. \"Alright. Then you better go for it.\" \"I better,\" I reply before I push my goggles down and slide into the pipe. ***PRESENT*** I suppose it's needless to say that my lucky streak had apparently run out and the Cloud 9 had taken it's next victim. I was in no way injured as badly as Will had been and I was a little fuzzy, but from what I understood I got out of the crash with some bad bruising and a concussion. I was going to be released from the hospital soon. My test results just had to come back clean and I would be free to go and cleared to ride in three days minimum to let my head get a break from the trauma. I sat in the bed and guessed I should have been a little more suspicious of the too good to be true luck I was having. It lasted me until just when I really needed it and I wish it would've stuck around for about another ten seconds just to make sure I would've hit everything safely. \"How are you?\" Will asks me with his head peaked in the curtain. I gesture for him to come in and I speak softly. Loud noises, including my own, hurt my head viciously. \"I'm fine. I get to ride in three days, provided I feel up to it.\" I smile at the news. I have about a weak to recover before Fire and Ice. I hope I'll be able to get everything under control by then. \"Are you insane Kayla? That soon?\" He asks concerned. He's lowered his voice and is now sitting in the chair next to my bed. I shrug and give him a 'What can you do?' type look. Even talking is painful and avoiding it makes my life much simpler. \"You could've been injured much worse! Or killed!\" He whisper shouts. I smirk, \"But I wasn't.\" \"I hate you sometimes…\" He grumbles. I shake my head with a huge smile on my face at his lie. He sighs. \"You really did scare me though. Please don't ever do that again.\" I wiggle my eyebrows and don't agree to anything. \"I don't know what I would've done if anything worse had happened…\" Will mumbles and looks down. I grab under his chin and shake my head at him. \"No worries,\" I push out. He looks me in the eye and I stare back at him. When neither of us avert our gazes we begin to drift towards each other and our lips meet in a short kiss. \"Never scare me like that again,\" Will whispers. I smirk slightly, \"No promises.\" AN- Headcanon that the Cloud 9 later that week that Kayla actually achieves scares the absolute crap out of Will and he about has a panic attack.[Chapter 16] AN- My wifi wouldn't work last night and wouldn't allow me to post. Sorry guys. I'll try and make this one extra special. Thanks to LoveShipper for reviewing. This story is based off of a concept that was very popular in the Glee fandom when I spent my time there. I've seen it elsewhere, but never as often. I also added my little twist to it. There will be an explanation of it at the end. So it's an AU. Pretty big one too. There will be altering POV and it will not be labeled. It will be fairly obvious who it is though. I promise. Written Being one of the youngest students in the senior class I still hadn't learned who I would be with forever. As birthdays passed I would see girls excitedly tell their friends and guys casually stop flirting with the underclassmen. They had learned the name of their soulmate and knew the name of the one they would spend their life with. By far one of the most dramatic days at school had been due to a pair of soulmates were discovered within the student body. Just several months ago, at the end of last year, a boy had approached Lindsey at lunch with her name written on his thumb in her swirling signature. It had been the first time she'd spoken in almost a year. Her soulmate Jeremy was four months older than her, but only discovered her existence within the school days before. They were an incredibly cute couple now and I was so happy for her, but that didn't stop me from being jealous that I wouldn't turn seventeen for another month and everybody was falling into their relationships or learning about their one and only as much as they could. Pia had turned seventeen in June and the boy she was destined to be with had worked at a summer camp she dropped her sister off at. They had met for a moment and were inseparable on the weekends. To be honest I just felt very lonely and this had caused me to throw myself into my school and snowboarding. I had met a couple of guys named Dink and Sam that were allowing me to practice with them and they'd helped me out quite a bit. I'd improved definitely and they treated me like they'd treat anyone else. I honestly don't think that they even realized that I was a so called 'popular girl' at their school and I was pretty glad for it. I show up at the pipe and wait in the normal waiting spot before my phone chirps in my pocket. I pull it out and check the message. It has the simple statement of 'Watch this!' on the screen and I turn to face the pipe and see a boarder flying through the air. I don't know who it is because I can see Dink and Sam standing and shouting at the top of the pipe. I watch the boarder out of the corner of my eye and start to make my way towards them. Once I get to the bottom of the pipe the boarder has completed their run and they practically hit me as the skid to a stop. \"Whoa. Sorry,\" a male's voice apologizes at the near collision. \"It's fine. You just nearly gave me a heart attack is all,\" I laugh it off. I wave a bit and head towards Sam and Dink. Once I've reached them I ask, \"Who was that and why did you want me to watch him?\" Dink explains, \"That's our friend Will. He's pretty good. He had an accident last year and we've just now convinced him to join our team for Fire and Ice!\" His voice is tinged with excitement and the broad grin across Sam's face shows his enthusiasm as well. \"I'm so happy for you guys!\" I exclaim and I wrap them both up in a hug. \"That's amazing!\" When I pull away Sam is still smiling, but he's giving me a slightly confused look. \"You aren't gonna join?\" \"Huh?\" I ask him. \"I didn't know I was invited.\" I give them both a shrug. Dink's face drops into one that is clearly not amused. \"Kayla, are you real? Why on Earth would we practice with you for weeks and then not want you on the team?\" I shrug again. \"I don't know…\" \"You're ridiculous,\" Sam laughs at me. He looks at something over my shoulder and gives a shout. \"Hey Will! This is her!\" I spin around to see the boy that almost crashed into me before. \"We met sort of already actually,\" I tell the guys. \"He kind of almost bowled me over a minute ago.\" Will removes his goggles and gives a bit of a sheepish grin. \"I really am sorry about that.\" \"It's cool,\" I wave him off again. I'm not concerned at all. Dink walks next to me and gestures to me while he says, \"Will this is Kayla and she's the girl that we've been telling you about.\" The look on Will's face could be compared to someone being given a small electric shock. His eyes are huge and almost worried. \"Oh,\" He mutters after a second. He continues with a much more normal, \"It's nice to meet you.\" \"Likewise,\" I grin at him. \"What is wrong with you two?\" I exclaim at the boys I call my best friends. \"You can't just throw every girl named Kayla at me!\" Dink gives me a slightly irritated look. \"We're sure that she's the one. We've been hanging out with her for a few months now and she's only sixteen. It would explain why you only have half a signature as of now. Your soulmate isn't seventeen yet… And neither is Kayla.\" \"All her friends have found their soulmates and she's lonely. That's actually how we found her. We didn't go looking for Kaylas for you. She kind of just fell into our lives and now that you've decided to join the team, which by the way there is no backing out now, she's part of your life too,\" Sam tells me. I know these two mean well, but I can't help and feel a little betrayed. I never should've shared I only have half a name on my shoulder blade to them. It's been over six months and I will admit it's kind of a bummer not to know, but time will tell. I sigh before replying, \"There will be no antics and attempting to get us together. You will let Kayla and I have a normal friendship because odds are that is all there will ever be. When she has her birthday everything will be normal and then I don't have to worry about her thinking I'm crazy because of you two.\" They look at each other and nod. \"Deal,\" Dink confirms. \"Thanks guys.\" \"We should have some sort of team bonding thing,\" I blurt awkwardly at practice. I don't know what possessed me, but I continue my statement. \"I don't feel like I know you guys at all and that's just weird.\" Dink and Sam look over at Will and shrug. His stare is suspicious of them and I'm completely lost. \"Guys?\" I ask tentatively. Sam shrugs at me, \"Sounds good to me.\" Dink nods and looks back over to Will. He nods too, but it seems a bit reluctant. \"How does in like an hour at my house sound? I have a pool and stuff,\" I offer. A dip in the pool sounds amazing after this long practice. Dink jumps at the chance, \"That sounds great.\" \"Alright then…\" I laugh. \"I'll see you guys then.\" I slide my board down into the pipe for my last ride of the day. I walk to the door when I hear the bell ring. My hair is wet in a towel and I'm wearing a t-shirt and track shorts from after my shower. \"Hey guys!\" I grin widely at the three boys on my doorstep. \"This is where you live?\" Sam asks me flabbergasted. I nod. \"Yeah for about seventeen years now…\" \"You're seventeen too?\" Will asks curiously. \"Well no…\" I admit. \"I turn seventeen in a few weeks. I'm super excited to not be a loner anymore. I'm like one of the youngest people in our class. You are a junior correct?\" I step to the side to let the guys in while I wait for Will's answer. \"Yeah. I am. Ms. Wines' class is killer. I nod, but add, \"I'm actually pretty good in that class. If you need any help feel free to ask.\" \"Really? That would like save me and my grade point average!\" Will explains with a hint of excitement. \"Yeah. Of course!\" I smile at him and lead the boys to the pool area. \"So I figured even if we don't swim it's a pretty nice place to just hang out.\" Dink rolls his eyes and comments sarcastically, \"Yeah it's 'pretty nice'.\" \"You know what Dink? I don't appreciate your sass!\" I tease. \"Ladies calm down,\" Sam jokes putting a hand out to each as though he was holding them back. \"Put the claws away.\" Will's face is one of extreme amusement at Dink and I's playful demeanor. \"Are they always like this?\" He asks. I nod and Dink shakes his head. \"He always starts it too,\" I tell him. \"I do not!\" Dink replies indignantly. Sam laughs and takes my side. \"He really does.\" \"Dude!\" Dink exclaims. His face portrays feelings of betrayal and I laugh. I'm practically doubled over as Dink begins ranting about the rules of friendship and the 'bro code' to Sam. \"Is this normal?\" I ask Will through my laughter this time. He nods, \"It's pretty normal.\" I pull a face. \"I'm sorry.\" He raises an eyebrow. \"It's not your fault.\" \"No, but this is getting boring,\" I explain. He nods and I contemplate something for a moment. Both boys are standing quite close to the water and I give Will a slight smirk as Dink and Sam are still yelling at each other. I raise myself to my tiptoes and whisper in Will's ear. \"Wanna push them in?\" He lets out a small chuckle, we both take a small step towards the boys, and in perfect synchronization we reach out and shove them each into the pool. We're both laughing so hard it's hard to hear the shocked gasps and angry shouts of the now soaked snowboarders. \"I hate you two,\" I state plainly as I watch Kayla walk past in the hall. I can tell that she isn't truly happy by the look in her eyes as she's with Pia and Lindsey. It's probably some sort of soulmate talk. It really seems to get to her. \"Um, why?\" Sam asks genuinely confused I sigh still irritated. \"Because the longer I spend time with her the more I want to. I want it to be her and it's not fair. This is torture.\" Twin expressions of disbelief grace their faces. \"You're admitting to it?\" Dink asks. \"It's only been a week. We were for sure that you wouldn't admit to it until after her birthday at least. You do know that it's only like two weeks from now right? You'll know soon.\" I grimace. \"I'm almost scared to know…\" I admit. \"What if it isn't? That's going to be frustrating. Or what if she's mine, but I'm not hers?\" Their disbelief soon turns to absolute elation. \"You have no idea how excited we are about this!\" Sam tells me. \"This is a good sign…\" \"If you feel like this she could very well be the one. I'm so happy for you bro,\" Dink grins. \"I can only hope,\" I look wistfully in the direction I last saw her. It's been a long time waiting for her and I can only dream that she's right here. I'm so excited to be alive and awake. It's finally the day and I'll learn the name of my soulmate. I'm awake an hour earlier than normal because I'm so anxious. As soon as my eyes are open I look to my hands. They're the most common for you to find your mark located. When I see that it isn't there I scan up my arms and find nothing there either. I flip the blankets off my legs and scan them as well. When I don't find it there I hop out of bed and into the bathroom where I can see the dark mark across my left collarbone in the mirror. I approach the mirror to get a closer look and begin trying to decipher it in the reflection. I can make out the first letter as a W and when I see that the first name is simply Will I gasp aloud. I look away from the mark and compose myself. I shouldn't get any ideas before I finish reading it. When I look down again and see that the last name begins with C I feel a spark of hope before quashing it down to focus. I sit there dumbfounded once I discover my hopes were true. Will is my soulmate. Now I just have to tell him. I don't have the courage to check my back today. I'm too scared to even consider the possibility of Kayla really being my soulmate. I suppose I'll be happy for her no matter who it is. I just hope she's happy in the end. I haven't seen Will all day and I'm worried. I normally at least pass him in the hallway, but it seems as though he's been avoiding me. It makes sense though because I am a little irritated that he knew that I could've been his soulmate and he didn't even tell me. I'm mostly excited though. I wore a pull over hoodie today and no one suspected a thing as it was getting chillier out this Fall. It was incredibly casual for me, but no one gave me a second glance. When I finally catch a glimpse of Will across the hall I practically storm over to him. I yank him by his collar and kiss him right in the hallway. It's intense and I can't imagine feeling this way with anyone else. There are sparks and I can't quite get enough, but I pull away before stating seriously. \"I am so mad at you.\" I walk away leaving him bewildered and I hear a few whistles at the display. It's time for practice and I almost am too afraid to go. I'm pretty sure Kayla's my soulmate and she's mine, but I've still never really checked. I don't think kissing anyone else could feel the way it did with Kayla. Today in the hallway felt like magic and I can't even believe it could get better than that. When I see Kayla walking up to me I take a deep breath. \"How long have you known?\" She asks her voice laced with irritation. \"Well I wasn't completely sure, but it didn't help that Sam and Dink introduced me to every Kayla they ever met.\" She gives me an irritated look and I wince a bit and give her a fuller explanation. \"I've suspected for a couple weeks, but I didn't want to be wrong.\" I shrug at the end and she glares. \"That's stupid,\" She states plainly. I correct her, \"It's stupid now, but what if you woke up this morning with a different name? Then it wouldn't have been.\" She rolls her eyes. \"I wouldn't have though.\" \"You don't know that,\" I tell her. \"Well that's not really something I'm worried about right now,\" she allows. I ask her curiously. \"So where is it?\" I peer down to her gloved hands because that's where it's most typical to have your mark. She begins to unzip the top of her jacket and pulls it to the side to show me the inky, black looking mark across her collarbone. I can read my own sloppy signature there and I feel my face flush slightly. She pulls it back over and I can see she's blushing as well. Once her jacket is zipped back up she asks me, \"Where's yours?\" \"Umm. Mine is actually on the back of my shoulder so it's a little difficult to show you,\" I shrug. \"I could I'd just have to take my jacket off and pull the whole back of my shirt up.\" She shakes her head. \"No. It's a little cold for that.\" I agree with her. \"Yeah. It is.\" We both give each other easy smiles and have one of the best days for boarding since I've met Sam and Dink. The next day we walk in to school together and everyone can see the mark across the front of my shoulder. AN- Lame ending is lame. So essentially when you turn seventeen you get the name of your soulmate written in their handwriting somewhere on your body. If your soulmate is younger than you then you only get their first name until they turn seventeen and then you would both have the complete name to search for each other. So that's the concept.[Chapter 17] AN- I'm getting a little paranoid about running out of ideas… SO PLEASE SEND IN REQUESTS! I love prompts guys! Really! In this 'verse Sebastian offered her a spot back on Team Swift the night before he originally did, but the story takes place the next day and the competition is the next day after that. If that makes sense… Walk I crash again and it has to have been at least the hundredth time. \"Ugh,\" I growl out in frustration. I merely flop down on the cold ground and cover my face with my gloved hands after removing my goggles. \"You're not tucking in enough,\" Will shouts at me as he approaches where I lie on my back in the snow. I pull my hands from my eyes and send Will a harsh glare. \"You know what? I'm trying alright. You don't have to be such a jerk about it.\" Will's face transform from one of mild disappointment and strong intensity to one of absolute shock. \"I'm a person with feelings and I shouldn't have to be yelled at every time I fall down out here. It's not like I haven't shown you that I'm trying and that I want this,\" I shout back at him as I rise to my feet. \"If I didn't want to be here I would leave and guess what? That time has come.\" I reach down and angrily rip the straps on my board to free myself. I step out and around Will leaving my board behind as I stomp away from the still shocked boy. \"Are you being serious right now?\" I hear him shout from behind me. I pivot on my heel and in an instant have replied. \"Will, do I look like I'm kidding? I'm a person, but you know what else I am? I'm a girl. Just to let you know most girls don't like to be yelled at aggressively. If I wanted to be treated like dirt I would've just taken Sebastian's offer!\" He stands there for a moment as though he's processing what I've said. \"What?\" He asks with a tone of disbelief. \"You heard me,\" I tell him straight. \"Sebastian offered me my spot back and I said no because I thought that I would be treated better here…\" We stand together in silence before I turn around once more and am on my way home. It takes me almost half an hour to reach my house and I'm still feeling mad at Will. I get that he means well, but it's not always about what you say, it's about how you say it and Will was saying it very loud and aggressively. I strip off my boots and jacket at the door before heading directly to my room and removing my other snow gear. Once I'm free of it's confines I change into some comfortable pajamas and fall back onto my bed. The further from the conversation I get the worse I feel. Was I really right to react so angrily or was my stress just getting to me? Sebastian's attempt at getting me to return to Team Swift yesterday had been weighing heavily on me and the competition tomorrow was stressing me out. I sure picked a great time to have a meltdown. My door swings open and a panicked voice asks, \"You quit?\" A disheveled Sam and Dink come into view and I stare at them before commenting, \"Come on in,\" with a roll of my eyes. \"Seriously? This is like panic level seven!\" Sam adds. I grimace. \"I didn't quit.\" When the boys give me a shared look of confusion I merely continue with, \"I took a walk and it happened to end here in my pajamas. I'll probably go out later. I just need to be not around Will right now.\" They both let out loud sighs and I can't help the urge to roll my eyes again. \"Well there you go. Crisis over,\" I dismiss them with a wave of my hand. \"Are you mad at Will?\" Dink asks. I give him a blank stare. \"I'm not going to dignify that question with a response. Go home guys.\" Sam shakes his head. \"No way. We need both of you to be back to normal by tomorrow so we're gonna solve this.\" I finally sit up to address them. \"What I need from you two is to trust me. Everything will be fine tomorrow. I just need some time to cool off. Then later I'll head out and get some practice in before the competition tomorrow. I promise,\" I give them an honest stare and they finally give in and consent with a nod. I give them another wave and they leave quietly. I lay back on my bed and turn to check the time. It's already seven o'clock so I'll probably get something to eat really quick before I head back to do some more boarding. Right now I just want to sit for a moment and detox from this afternoon and all it's stresses. After roughly five minutes of staring at the ceiling I stand back up and head down to my kitchen to make something really quick to eat. My parents had a business dinner tonight and I make myself some pasta to eat. Once I've done that I eat it quickly over the sink and run back to my room. It's already been almost half an hour and I grab my snow gear to put it back on. Once I'm prepared for the elements I head to the door where I let my boots and jacket. When I see my board leaning against the wall I realize that Sam and Dink must've dropped it off and I'm glad that they did. When I arrive at the pipe it's deserted and that makes sense. It's past eight o'clock and mostly dark except for the few overhead lamps that are still operating. I start up to the top of the pipe and begin making runs. I crash every time just as before, but with a determined huff I stand once again. Then I hear a voice comment softly through the peacefulness. \"If you grab your board a little further from yourself you should be able to get enough tuck to finish.\" I turn to see Will standing with an apologetic look on his face. In perfect tandem we both speak, \"I'm sorry!\" Then look confused, \"Wait, what?\" I speak first with, \"You shouldn't be sorry. I really shouldn't have snapped at you. I was just frustrated with myself mostly.\" Will shakes his head. \"What you said was true though. I was speaking harshly and I was being no better of a coach than Sebastian.\" He shivers at the statement and I laugh at the dramatic reaction. \"You were just trying to help,\" I tell him. \"I was still being a bit of a jerk to you. I promise not to though anymore. You are practicing for our team though right?\" He asks jokingly, but I have a feeling that there's a little doubt in his mind. I nod. \"There's no way I'd ever go back to Team Swift Will. It's not where I belong.\" He raises an eyebrow. \"And where do you belong?\" I smirk. \"It's not obvious?\" I hold my arms out and gesture to the surroundings. \"Here!\" \"In an empty pipe?\" He asks skeptical. I laugh. \"It's not empty now is it?\" He agrees. \"That is true…\" He takes a few tentative steps towards me and I stand my ground on my board. He takes more and then we're standing face to face. \"We're good now right?\" \"Definitely. We both had our problems and now it's all good right?\" I ask to confirm. He laughs. \"Definitely.\" Then he looks down at his watch. \"You do know it's almost midnight right?\" \"I didn't, but that's good because midnight is a new beginning. Are you ready for a new beginning?\" I ask seriously. He looks me in the eyes and answers with a smirk. \"Definitely.\" \"You know I believe in you right?\" He asks after a moment. \"Definitely.\" The word has barely left my mouth before his is pressed firmly to mine. It's hard to believe the circumstances, but I'm pretty glad that so far we've beaten the odds. AN- Not wowed by this…[Chapter 18] AN- If you haven't caught on by now I like to use titles that are relevant, but not completely obvious to the nature of the story. Thanks for the reviews from LoveShipper and ellie111lee! Thanks for the requests also LoveShipper! They're much appreciated! I'm pretty sure I'll do one of those next chapter I just need to get my head together on one of them because I don't want to do the first one so close to chapter 14. I started this one with a completely different idea in mind. Feeling The day I became friends with Kayla was so long ago and even though we've grown closer there's always been something that's stopped me from making the move I'd like to. I have a sour feeling in my stomach and I'm sure today won't be the day either. I'm incredibly proud of the progress that she's made as a boarder and I'm glad we've bonded the way we have, but if only we could have a moment alone to talk. I'm pretty sure that she likes me too. I just have to talk to her. I can see her complete another perfect jump and give her a thumbs up. She rides the short distance to me and speaks, \"Pretty good day out here. I don't see why you're taking the day off.\" \"I don't know. I'm just not feeling good about today. It clearly doesn't apply to you though!\" I explain. She really has been on fire all afternoon. My stomach turns and it worries me. I've been feeling like something bad is gonna happen and I hope desperately that it's not about Kayla. I voice my concern by saying, \"I feel like it's almost too good to be true. Maybe you should take the rest of the day off.\" She grimaces. \"I'm doing so well today though…\" I shrug. \"It's up to you, but I just don't feel right about today and we could do something else.\" \"Like what?\" She asks curiously. \"Um. I don't know… Anything I guess,\" I answer unprepared for her to agree with me. Is fate messing with my head? She laughs. \"I'm down for pretty much anything.\" \"Well I honestly wasn't expecting to get this far. I figured you would just disagree and keep boarding,\" I admit. She pulls her helmet and goggles off and laughs once more. \"I have no reason to not believe you or your instincts so I'll go along with it.\" I'm honestly shocked that she's going along with this and I'm psyched that it was this easy although that is a little suspicious… \"Well what sounds good to you?\" She has a thoughtful expression for a moment and answers. \"A smoothie sounds pretty good right now.\" \"That sounds like a plan to me!\" I agree with her. \"Where do you normally go for one?\" \"I usually go to this place by my house, but it's a bit of a walk from here,\" she elaborates. \"Let's go!\" I encourage. \"A walk sounds pretty nice.\" She begins to unstrap her board and I take it from her. \"I'll take that.\" She shakes her head at me amused. \"I'm not gonna fight you on it. That thing is heavy and if you want to carry it then so be it!\" I nod. \"Good choice.\" I tuck the board under my arm and ask, \"Lead the way?\" \"Well if you're feeling adventurous there's a slightly shorter path through the woods, but it's a little hilly and stuff,\" she suggests. \"Otherwise we can just take the streets. It would cut about ten minutes off of our time.\" If I take the path in the woods I'll have less time with her, but it will be actual alone time… \"Let's go the quicker way. Then I don't have to carry this through all the people on the streets,\" I move the board to show that I was referring to it. She nods. \"That makes sense.\" \"Lead me to smoothies!\" I say playfully. \"You got it! Follow me!\" She laughs at the face I've made and I smile mostly to myself. I really do wish it was this easy all the time. I take her right side so the board isn't in-between us and begin chatting casually with her as we walk. \"So you and Pia actually pantsed all the mannequins in the mall in one day?\" I gasp out through fits of laughter. \"It sounds like something that Dink, Sam, and I would do. Not you two!\" \"We seriously did! We were so bored and Lindsey was sick with the flu. It's one of my favorite memories!\" She tells me. We've approached an area in the woods where I feel as though we aren't anywhere near the town. \"Um. Kayla where are we?\" \"The woods,\" she answers plainly. \"We've been walking for almost twenty minutes. Are we close to getting out at all?\" I ask her. She shrugs. \"I don't know. I was just wondering how long it would take you to realize we were walking away from the city before you said anything. Apparently my answer is twenty minutes.\" I look at her bewildered. \"Are you serious? Kayla that's insane.\" \"No it's not. We took an almost straight path to get here and there were no obstacles. If there had been any I would've told you what I was actually doing. Anyways this isn't so bad,\" She sits down in the thinner snow. It's only a couple of inches here which is quite thin for the mountain. \"You are crazy…\" I shake my head and sit across from her, laying her board down next to me. \"Why on Earth do I believe anything that comes out of your mouth?\" She fakes a posh voice and replies, \"Because I'm amazing.\" I roll my eyes. \"So not it.\" She smirks. \"Then give me the reason.\" \"I don't have one. I honestly shouldn't,\" my voice shakes a little during the lie. Now that I'm here alone with her I'm too nervous to think about telling her. Her eyebrows shoot up on her forehead, \"Liar.\" \"So?\" I respond. She sighs. \"Look so we're finally alone for once and if you aren't going to say it then I will,\" she takes a deep breath. \"I like you. A lot. I never get the chance to talk to you about it because we're never alone so there it is.\" I don't know why I considered the thought that Kayla would just let it go. I've known her for almost a year and I should've realized that she goes for whatever she wants. At least this time what she wants is me. \"Um. Okay,\" I mumble some before raising my voice, \"I like you a lot as well and I've actually tried to tell you a few times, but things never work out. Usually it's somehow related to Dink or Sam and then I feel really discouraged and give up for a while. So here it is,\" I lay everything out for her and then awkwardly state \"I want us to be together…\" She has a small smile on her face and answers with, \"That sounds great.\" I take whatever little piece of courage I have to lean forward and bring our faces together for a short kiss. \"So will you, Kayla Morgan, be my girlfriend?\" \"Yes,\" she answers quietly before leaning back in for another kiss. The nervous feeling in my stomach is gone and I don't think anything could cause this to be ruined. AN- Seriously not what was gonna happen in the beginning at all. I'll save that plot for another time then.[Chapter 19] AN- 19 chapters… Whoa. That just seems so crazy to me! Remember to make requests and I will do them. It might not be immediate, but it will be as soon as I get ideas and inspiration. Next chapter will feature one of LoveShipper's requests. I wanted to provide a slight gap and then it will be my twentieth chapter! Some of my personal opinions are expressed in this for certain terminology. You'll understand when you read it. It's not Nick by the way. You'll get it. Taken \"Dude, you know all of this pining after her is doing you no good right?\" Dink asks his lovestruck friend concerned. \"She's taken.\" Will lets out a frustrated sigh. \"I know. It's killing me bro,\" he turns to face his friends. \"She hasn't even met this guy before. He's from Georgia or something.\" \"That's rough. The fact that the guy she's with doesn't even really know her is just dumb,\" Sam pitches in. Will nods. \"I might as well let it go. It's not like they're not serious about it. This has been planned since she was a baby!\" He leans into the wall out of irritation before ranting. \"I just don't know how you can promise your daughter off to marry some boy before either of them have even developed a personality!\" Dink grimaces. \"It's technically traditional and you're only really frustrated because you don't have a chance with her.\" \"I would if she wasn't engaged to that guy…\" Will mutters angrily. \"That's not what I meant and you know it,\" Dink disagrees. Sam nods to back Dink up. \"You totally would if it weren't for the whole betrothed thing.\" \"I should just move on I guess. After all she is spoken for,\" Will releases a deep breath resigned to the fact that he would never get the girl he truly wanted. \"Dad?\" Kayla asks tentatively. She pokes her head into her father's office hoping to find him in a break. Her father looks up from the laptop he was most likely typing out emails on. \"Yes sweetie?\" She speaks up a bit and steps into the room. \"I was wanting to talk to you about my engagement.\" Her father's eyebrows raise at the statement. Kayla had never shown much interest in discussing the boy she was promised to. \"What about it?\" \"Well…\" She starts off unsure before clearing her throat. \"I don't feel very confident in it. I don't love him at all. We don't have anything in common and we lead two very different lives. I don't feel a connection with this boy and I don't think I'll be happy marrying him.\" \"Wow. You've put thought into this,\" he gives her a knowing look. \"Any other factors? I really do think that you two would be better together than you think. He's very nice and charming from all his father's told me. As well as hardworking, intelligent, and from what I've seen he is quite handsome.\" She sighs. \"I don't like the idea of leaving the mountains at all. I love snowboarding so much as well as all my friends and family.\" \"Mm hmm…\" he hums. Then proceeds to fish for the answer he's sure is there. \"Anything else?\" \"Honestly, there may be another boy that I feel a strong connection with and I'd really like to get to explore that. I want to be happy here with him,\" she admits. Mr. Morgan looks her dead in the eyes. \"Kayla I will never force you to marry anyone you don't want to. You are my only daughter and I want you to be happy more than anything. Your mother and I picked out a boy for you to marry because we thought that you could be happy together. It would be foolish of me to force you into it when you believe you've found someone to be happy with. You're free to do whatever you'd please regarding the matter as long as it is handled with grace and respect.\" Kayla's eyes are slightly glassy from the tears she's holding back and her voice expresses every ounce of gratitude she has. \"Thank you so much dad. I love you so much.\" \"I love you too,\" he smiles as his daughter excitedly exits his office. \" I should just move on I guess. After all she is spoken for,\" Will releases a deep breath resigned to the fact that he would never get the girl he truly wanted. \"I never really liked that term,\" they hear a feminine voice from their side say. \"Spoken for, taken, off the market,\" she lists, \"They all sound so possessive. Like I'm an object as opposed to a person. No one has taken me, there is no 'market', and I can most definitely speak for myself.\" The boys look at Kayla with shocked faces at her sudden appearance. \"Are you guys really that oblivious? I've been standing over there for like five minutes.\" She gestures to a spot several feet away. \"Hi,\" Will manages to stutter out. She smiles amused at his reaction. \"Hi,\" She waves at him and her bare ring finger doesn't go unnoticed by two of her best friends. They're eyes are locked on it the whole time as it returns to holding her binder. \"Wait you aren't?\" Sam doesn't dare finish his question. She shakes her head and shrugs. \"There were some complications. It was pretty though,\" she muses. \"It really was,\" Dink agrees. When Sam gives him a weird look he replies defensive, \"A man can respect that kind of craftsmanship and effort!\" \"What?\" Will asks flummoxed by the whole exchange. Kayla laughs at his bewildered expression and can't bring herself to answer his question. Dink took the duty upon himself to clarify things for Will, \"Basically our whole conversation a bit ago was inaccurate. You'll see.\" He taps Sam on the arm and the two vacated the area. Will's eyes are still extremely wide and lost at the thought that Dink has put in his head. In a moment of clarity his eyes dart down to Kayla's hands and he realizes that they're bare of any jewelry, including the engagement ring that she'd been sporting for almost five months now. \"You're not engaged?\" He finally manages to utter. She shakes her head with a smile on her face. \"Why not?\" Will is completely befuddled by this change. She shrugs at him. \"There were several reasons. I couldn't picture ever leaving here, I'd miss my family, and of course there's the fact that I don't love him. It just wasn't fair for either of us.\" \"So you just called everything off even though you have been betrothed since practically birth?\" Will asks her to confirm. \"Absolutely. There are certain things that aren't worth doing and sacrificing love is not one of those things. I love my family, I love snowboarding, I love my friends, and I'm pretty sure I might love you,\" her response is blunt and if Will thought that math was the most confused he'd ever be, he was wrong because he'd never foreseen this. He points to himself. \"Me?\" She laughs at the question and when his face turns anxious at the lack of an answer she laughs harder. She rolls her eyes and pulls him close. \"Don't be daft,\" she mumbles into his ear. She leans up and kisses him hard. Things appear to have finally kicked in for Will and he's responding almost immediately. His arms wrap around her waist and hers travel to his shoulders. The hallway has fallen into a hush at their display. It's well known that Kayla has been engaged to a boy from Georgia and this has shocked them into silence as they witness the couple's display of affection. When the pair have pulled away the hallway seems to be in shock. \"Well that solves that problem…\" Kayla jokes. She raises her left hand and wiggles her fingers at the audience they've gained before taking Will by the hand to take him somewhere more private. They had things to discuss and… Other things to do… AN- I only really have experience kissing my boyfriend and we have a very different height difference than Will and Kayla. I'm 5'2 and my boyfriend is 6'4 so he usually picks me up. Not a problem for this pair, but not something I'm familiar with. I was too lazy to give Georgia guy a name. Can you tell? Though in my head his name was Jared…[Chapter 20] AN- We're at twenty chapters! I honestly never expected this… I was pretty sure I would get one or two in and then quit, but here we are… I've reached, as of the beginning this chapter, 33,727 words, 988 views, 23 reviews (19 from the ever so lovely LoveShipper and then two each from the equally fabulous Clato27 and ellie111lee!), 2 faves, and 3 alerts! That's amazing and I'd like to thank everyone for their contribution! Remember to submit ideas! Believe it or not I will run out eventually! This chapter was suggested by LoveShipper! Ask \"I'm so excited Kayla! Jenna actually said yes! I've got a date to prom!\" Dink practically bounces towards me while I exchange books at my locker. He babbles excitedly about the girl for a moment. All of a sudden the signs were everywhere. Prom was quite literally around the corner. It hadn't hit most of the boys to even be concerned until now, just two weeks before the event, but girls all across the school had been searching for their dresses since Christmastime. I wasn't one of those girls at all. I hadn't even really thought about the dance and didn't feel the desire to go by myself anyways. The only reason prom had crossed my mind was because Dink had actually managed to get himself a date. I know it sounds bad, but he wasn't as smooth as he wanted to be and it had turned into a bit of a joke on the team. One that he even played along with from time to time. I look at him amused for a moment. \"Is she the one that we dared you to propose to at the mall?\" I ask honestly curious. He gives me a sheepish look. \"Yeah… But she's really cool actually. We have third period together and we've been talking some.\" \"That's excellent! I'm happy for you! Now go tell Sam,\" I order him off so I can get along to my class. \"Well I just have to ask you something first,\" He explains. \"Have you got your dress yet? I was hoping that you'd be there to help buffer with Jenna in case it gets awkward.\" I shut my locker and give him an apologetic look. \"I'm sorry Dink. I'm not going to prom. I don't feel like going without a date. Maybe you could use Sam to help out?\" He looks down. \"It's not the same… But alright. You really should come though. It's going to be amazing.\" \"I'm sure it will be for everyone with dates, but I'm perfectly content to save the money and stay home,\" I explain. Dink looks at me unamused. \"Your father owns the resort Kayla. It's not like you couldn't get a dress from around here for a discount.\" \"Go find Sam, Dink,\" I dismiss him. He looks at me sternly. \"You better go buy a dress Kayla!\" I roll my eyes and turn to walk away. \"Whatever Dink,\" I turn my head as I walk to stick my tongue out at him and he makes a ridiculous face back at me. I walk into something solid before turning back around with a quick \"Sorry!\" I can hear Dink's laughter from down the hallway. I peer up to see Will. \"Hi,\" he responds clearly amused by the interaction. \"Hi,\" I laugh. \"What's up?\" \"I've got geography,\" Will grimaces. \"We're covering Europe right now and all the countries are so little and squished together!\" I nod. \"That's true, but it's so pretty over there.\" He shrugs. \"I guess. I better get moving though. I can't afford to be late.\" \"Me neither,\" I agree. \"Bye Will!\" I sidestep him and head on down to my class. I can hear his goodbye called down after me. I raise a hand in a little wave to indicate that I heard him. The next day I walk to Dink with purpose. \"You called my mother and told her that I wasn't going to prom because of money,\" I practically shout. \"Well you should go!\" He defends. I glare at him. \"I should go because I want to go, but now I have to. It's like a punishment and I don't think you understood me yesterday. I don't want to go alone, saving money was simply a benefit of that.\" He shrugs. \"Now you have to go and you'll have a great time. I doubt that you'll go alone anyway. I bet someone asks you by the end of the week.\" \"I hate you,\" I deadpan. He shakes his head nonchalant. \"No, you don't.\" I give Dink a knowing look. \"So it's fifteen minutes until school gets out on Friday. Your week is up and I am still dateless.\" He glares over to the left side of the classroom where the door is. \"I've got the rest of the night Missy.\" \"Sure,\" I reply skeptical. Soon enough the bell rings and I'm heading home from school as quick as possible. I just feel like laying down and relaxing for the night. I reach the top of my porch and in front of the door is a little pile of what appear to be rose petals with a small card folded next to them. The card has my name in slightly sloppy writing on the outer cover. I bend down to pick the card up and examine it some. I flip it open and it reads: Kayla, I'm sorry that I haven't done this sooner, but I have a question for you. Would you go to prom with me? I glance around and hope that the boy that came up with such a cute note is around. He didn't sign it so I have no way of answering him. \"Um yes?\" I say aloud to the area incase he's hiding from me. \"You don't sound very sure,\" I hear Will's voice from behind me. I jump startled at his sudden appearance. \"Goodness gracious Will you nearly gave me a heart attack. Why do you sneak up on people?\" \"I don't. You're just really oblivious,\" he retorts. I frown. \"No, I'm not.\" \"No, but seriously are you sure?\" Will changes the subject. \"About prom?\" I ask, when he nods I continue, \"Well yeah. Why not?\" He puts his hands up in mock surrender. \"Just making sure.\" I give him a suspicious look. \"This is from you, correct?\" He nods once more. \"Yeah.\" \"Then yeah. Absolutely,\" I confirm. I reach out and pull him into a hug. \"I guess I better actually go buy a dress. I talked my mom out of making me on Wednesday.\" \"That's a good idea,\" he concurs. \"Well I think I'm all ready,\" I tell my mom. The dress we had bought last weekend was truly beautiful. It was emerald green and very slimming. It was strapless and the top featured some sparkly pattern detailing. I had fallen in love with it quickly. My mom gives me a teary eyed smile and holds out her arms for a hug. \"You look perfect, sweetie.\" We hold each other tight for a moment before I thank her and head out the door. Will is waiting for me and he escorts me to his car where we take off to prom. He reaches out for one of my hands while he drives and remarks, \"You look stunning by the way. I didn't want to make you late by hanging around at your house, but you really look amazing.\" I feel the heat rush to my face. \"Thanks,\" I mumble out. He squeezes my hand once and we carry on to prom, my face burning the whole ride. \"Kayla!\" I hear a few exclamations. Within moments of arriving at the dance all of my best friends and their dates are surrounding me and showering me with compliments. \"Thanks guys, but can we just relax for a moment. You're all talking at the same time,\" I request politely. The nod awkwardly at their overwhelming experience. \"So are you wanting to dance?\" Will asks awkwardly. Kayla giggles quietly. \"I thought you'd never ask.\" He offers her a hand out to me and we both rise while he replies back, \"Oh haha! It's hard alright!\" \"Mm hmm. Next time could you give a girl a warning that isn't in the form of Dink,\" I quip. We're on the dance floor and the dancing is incredibly casual for a good twenty minutes. I'm having the best time and I'm so glad Will is with me. Then a slower song flips on and we both stand there awkwardly for a moment. We look at each other and burst into laughter before shaking off the weirdness and just dancing. We've been spinning in circles for around a minute when I look up to see Will looking at me intently. \"Can I try something?\" he whispers. I'm feeling brave at the moment and I answer. \"Yes.\" He leans in to me and kisses me gently for a moment. I smile and jokingly comment. \"Care to try again?\" AN- I typed this with my glasses off so any errors were caused by the fact that I can't read my screen unless I'm less than a foot away from it. Thank you all so much.[Chapter 21] AN- I had no idea that my page breaks weren't going through so I have reformatted chapters that I had written them in, but they didn't appear on fanfiction. This includes chapters 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 14, 16, 19, and 20. It should make them easier to read and I'll try and be more vigilant checking that now… Thanks to LoveShipper and ADayWithNoLaughterIsADayWasted for their reviews and requests.:) Return Practicing the night before Fire and Ice couldn't have gone any worse. I lashed out at Kayla even though it wasn't about her. We awkwardly walk towards her home for the night and I feel horrible for being the cause of this. I pat my pockets to check for my phone so I can tell my mom I'm on the way home. When I come up empty I sigh. \"I forgot my phone at the pipe. I'll catch up with you in a minute,\" I break the awkward silence. She nods and I turn back the short distance to go grab my phone. Once I've retrieved my phone from the table I'd sat it on I do a short jog back to where Kayla has made it and I overhear a conversation. \"C'mon Kayla, I saw what just happened out there and I know you aren't happy on that team. You should join us tomorrow. I'll have a uniform ready for you,\" Sebastian says. Kayla gives him a hard glare and I slow to a stop so I can watch her reaction. \"I don't think you heard me right. I will not ever be coming back to Team Swift. I may be irritated with Will right now, but he stopped me because he cares about me and doesn't want me hurt. You threw me off the team because you didn't want to put forth the effort to help me improve. So you know what you can do with the uniform you have for me?\" She takes a step towards him and says venomously, \"Burn it.\" Sebastian's face is the dictionary definition of stunned. He stands there moving his lips, but unable to produce words and soon Kayla storms off in the direction of her home. I return to my quickened pace and childishly stick my tongue out at the older man when I pass him. Within moments I'm back to Kayla's side and she glances at me before returning her eyes to the ground. Her eyes are hard and angry and I'm feeling incredibly guilty that I'm part of the cause. I speak quietly. \"I'm sorry. You're right. I'm just really worried that you're going to get hurt like me somehow.\" \"I won't,\" she says with determination in her voice. I give her a crooked smile. \"I'm sure you won't. It doesn't keep me from being a big bundle of nerves about it,\" I admit. She looks over and rolls her eyes. \"Trust that I won't Will. I've got a great coach looking out for me.\" She nudges me with her shoulder and my face burns. We fall into another lengthy silence before I offer. \"Do you want to go back?\" \"No way!\" She protests. I look at her confused. \"You don't want to try again?\" She looks to me as though I'm crazy. \"Not with him. He's insane and I never want to go back.\" I burst into laughter. \"I meant do you want to go back to the pipe? Not to Team Swift!\" I clarify and once the distinction is made she joins me in giggles. \"Oh. Well that sounds fine,\" she remarks much calmer. I chuckle. \"Are you sure?\" I ask in a teasing tone. She makes a face at me before turning around and heading back the other way. I turn on my heel and follow her. \"When am I ever gonna say no to that?\" \"Well I didn't know if you were tired or something! It is getting pretty late,\" I tell her. She shrugs. \"It's the night before Fire and Ice and I need the practice. I want at least a few more runs whether or not I actually land it.\" I nod. \"Sounds like a plan. Besides, from the way Sebastian makes it sound you're already a real threat without the Cloud 9.\" \"I still really want to make it! It's a challenge now,\" she states. I grin. \"You will. You just haven't needed to yet.\" \"Thanks for coming back with me,\" Kayla says. I shrug nonchalant about it all. \"It's honestly not a big deal. I'm feeling antsy as well and this is just how you handle stress,\" I grab her by the shoulders since we've reached our destination. \"You've got everything going for you and I'm on your side every step of the way.\" \"Thanks Will. It means a lot,\" she leans into me for a hug and I'm surprised at the affection, but wrap my arms around her regardless. When she loosens her grip I do as well, but she's looking into my eyes and I'm struck by how stunning she really looks right now. I'm not an idiot and I've realized that Kayla is incredibly attractive, but this moment right now it all just falls into place for me. I swear I'm on auto pilot and when our lips meet I know that I'm lost to my instincts because everything is a blissful blur moments after. Kayla doesn't get her run through, but we do sit under the lights for the next hour talking about nothing and everything. It's incredibly peaceful and it feels like one of the happiest moments of my life. AN- If you guys notice any mistakes feel free to tell me. I don't edit these because I pretty much always post in the wee hours of the morning my time. I probably won't come back to change something unless the number of errors in the chapter is large or the error in particular makes it harder to read. That's why I went back and added line breaks to all the chapters in need. This one didn't have any so I don't have to worry this time. Remember to review! I've had over a thousand views and only 25 reviews! I'm not greedy, but it just seems like I could have a few more!:)[Chapter 22] AN- I am so sorry for punking out on you guys this weekend, but I didn't have anytime to myself that didn't involve sleep or homework so I apologize. I didn't get to watch the movie and refresh my memory either so that sucks as well. Thank you very much for the reviews last chapter LoveShipper, ellie111lee, and ADayWithNoLaughterIsADayWasted! This is a request from ADayWithNoLaughterIsADayWasted. I aspire to be a vet and therefore have to recognize the dangers. #vaguecommentmakessenselater Scare I walk into work and am met with copious barks of enthusiasm from the kennel regulars. \"Hi guys,\" I say in a higher pitch. \"Hi Kayla!\" Sam answers from his spot in the corner. \"Hey Sam,\" I grin. \"Your turn today?\" He explains quickly. \"Just for a while. Will had to meet about something after school.\" I nod. \"Alright,\" I peer over to the cages. \"Who's the new dog?\" I ask curious about the fluffy Akita breed. Sam grimaces. \"That's Missy,\" He shoots the dog a dirty look. \"I don't recommend any contact with her. She snapped at me when I tried to feed her.\" \"Well alright. I'll be avoiding her then,\" I reply. I glance back over to the beautiful tan dog and give a disappointed frown. \"It's too bad. She's really pretty.\" \"She is, but she's meaner than any dog I've ever met!\" Sam comments. The door bell rings and we both turn to see Will walking inside and stopping his boots off on the rug. The dogs are stirred up into a flurry once more and I look back to watch Missy sit silent, but her eyes intent on Will. \"Hi,\" Will greets us and I turn back to him. I smile brightly at him. \"Hey!\" \"Hi Will. I have to head out and meet Dink, but you two are gonna be done at like four right?\" Sam asks. I look to Will to confirm. He knows the schedule better than I do still. \"Yeah. We get out then so provided there are no delays,\" he looks at me pointedly and I glance to the ceiling acting innocent, \"We should be able to meet with you guys at like four thirty.\" I may or may not take a little more time than Will thinks is necessary, but he doesn't have as much to do. That's my excuse and I'm sticking to it! \"Sounds good, bro!\" Sam nods and waves goodbye to us as he heads out the door. The ringing of the doorbell causes a few residual barks, but the shop quiets quickly. If I'm here by myself I would sing and that causes all of the dogs to quiet except Donald. He howls and sings with me. It's a lot of fun. \"Alright. We don't have much to do today so we might even be able to get out even earlier then four today,\" Will informs me. I reach over and knock on the countertop before responding. \"Okay. What do we need to do then?\" I inquire. \"Well we need to feed everyone and then I think Donald is the only one due for a bath. So that's all there is really besides regular store cleaning up and such,\" Will answers before asking, \"Who's the new guy?\" I scowl. \"That's Missy. Apparently she tried to bite Sam when he went to feed her.\" Will raises his eyebrows. \"Well then. That's no good. Stay away from her.\" I nod. \"I plan on it. You should as well.\" He makes a noncommittal noise before remarking. \"I washed Donald last time so guess what?\" I stick my tongue out at him and he tosses me a leash and I catch it. Donald is not allowed out of his kennel without it because he tried to run the last time he was without it. I reach into Donald's kennel and snap the leash onto his collar before opening the gate and leading the dog to the bath tub. \"Up we go Donald,\" I say aloud as I lift him into the tub. \"Enjoy that!\" Will quips from across the shop. \"Maybe I will. Donald and I have bonded haven't we?\" I ask the dog in a silly voice. The dog barks twice and I laugh at Will's surprised \"What? Did he just answer you?\" from across the shop. As I fill the tub with a small amount of warm water I speak quietly to Donald and he occasionally yaps back at me. My amusement only grows as Will grows more confused by the apparent bond that Donald and I formed on the few shifts I didn't share with Will. \"What did you do to him?\" Will asks from over by the dogs once again. I giggle. \"I didn't do anything!\" I begin rinsing the soap off of Donald. I hear Will pouring food into bowls and he argues. \"Donald is never that good for me in the bath! Did you brainwash him?\" I shake my head at Will's ridiculous accusation. \"No Will.\" Donald shakes and I hear a few happy barks from other dogs that have received their bowls. I pick Donald back up and grab a towel. I sit down in the floor with Donald and begin drying him off with the towel. I hear an aggressive sounding growl and my head spins over to where Will is standing over by Missy. It feels like I see it in slow motion. Before I can even try to say the words the dog has pounced towards Will's outstretched arm containing the food bowl. I see the dog bite down on his arm and he lets out a shocked noise. \"Will!\" I finally exclaim jumping to my feet when he's pulled his arm from the dog's mouth. There is dog food scattered across the floor and he's holding his arm tightly. He walks tensely over to sit down and I rush to his side. \"What do you need?\" I ask panicked. \"That was so stupid.\" He nods. \"I think I need my mom.\" His eyes are shut tight and his face shows that he's in pain. I look down at his arm and can see a trickle of blood not covered by his hand. I grab my cell phone and start dialing the number before I quickly jog over to get a fresh towel for Will's arm. The phone is still ringing when I return to him and in the end it sends me to her voicemail. I leave a message before asking what Will would like me to do next. He breathes deeply. \"Maybe some ice for now…\" I'm shaking out of nervousness. I grab the ice and with a shaky voice ask, \"Stupid question time, but are you okay?\" \"I'm sure I'm going to survive,\" He replies as he places the ice over the towel. I sit down next to him and grab onto the towel and apply pressure. He makes a hissing noise with the intake of breath. \"You have to keep pressure on it to stop the bleeding. You might need stitches. Where is your mom at?\" \"She has a meeting thing until like three thirty,\" His eyes are squeezed tightly shut once more and I look up to the clock. \"It's five minutes until the end of her meeting. She'll get the message I left then. Anything else I can do for you?\" I ask once again. He takes another deep breath. \"Distract me.\" Without even thinking I lean over and kiss him. Surprisingly to me he kisses back and we fall in sync without ever releasing pressure on Will's arm. I pull away and look to the towel to see it he's bled through it. When I see it's not true I take a deep breath myself. \"Don't ever scare me like this again,\" I state seriously. AN- Hopefully this is satisfactory. Sorry for going missing for two days…[Chapter 23] AN- Sorry for going AWOL with no earlier explanation. I would've posted a note, but I figured you'd rather I spent my spare time on this and not comprising a list of my excuses. College is definitely a busy time. I go on break in a few weeks though. Thank you for reviews from LoveShipper and ADayWithNoLaughterIsADayWasted. Now for your reading enjoyment (finally)… Chapter 23 Noble. Noble It was weird seeing Nick the next day at the pipe. I was meeting Will there to hang out for a bit and board. Sam and Dink were going to be a bit late, but that was okay. When Nick gave a small wave and raced off in his generic snowsuit I knew something more was going on now that he'd confronted his father. I lift a hand a wave back in a show of peace before he's out of sight. \"I still can't really believe that you kept it a secret,\" Will admits arriving behind me. I give him a confused look. \"Why not? Do I strike you as the type to try and ruin someone's reputation?\" I tease him. He grimaces, \"Well no. I just mean that it's awfully noble of you. You could've had the team disqualified if you just told them that Nick had been involved in the sign breaking as well.\" I shrug. \"I doubt disqualified, but in trouble a bit sure.\" \"So why didn't you?\" Will asks curious. I sit quietly and think for a moment before answering. \"Well at first it was to protect him, but when I figured out he didn't really care about me anymore I wanted to prove myself instead of just showing them to be the cheaters they are.\" \"You really are the bigger person. I always admired that about you,\" Will admits. \"The whole time. Even when I was busy trying to keep you away from me. I always thought that it was very strong of you to take the blame for your team and still not throw them under the bus when it would benefit you.\" I shrug. \"I knew that I could do better than him even if no one believed it. Then you, Dink, and Sam were thrown into my life and you believed in me. I could tell at the beginning it was tentative, but you have to admit that you did even just a little bit.\" He nods. \"I was assured of that by how stubborn you were. You were going to do it no matter what. I was shocked that you were as, please don't be offended, average as you were. You had the dedication any coach would dream of. You did as you were told and all it took was some mild attention to allow you to flourish,\" he explains. \"I didn't have to do a whole lot, Kayla. I just had to guide you in the direction you wanted to go with some advice. You just needed a coach that would pay attention to you.\" \"And for that I am extremely grateful. You were absolutely right when you said I needed a coach that would pay attention to me more, but you have taught me tons. Trust me when I say that it wasn't just guidance. It was more than that,\" I smile at the boy that I've grown fond of quite recently. He has really changed me for the better. Will's eye roll is unmistakable, but I let it slide as we sit there in a companionable silence. Will breaks our peace with a murmur. \"Yesterday honestly terrified me.\" I give him an incredulous look. \"Why on Earth would it have terrified you? We all did amazing.\" He turns to look me in the eye. \"It wasn't about how well we were doing. It was about everyone's well being. Every jump performed I could see a crash. Small ones, big ones… deadly ones. It was unconscious and I couldn't get it to stop. My first run I was sure that I was going to go down and hurt myself again. When I didn't I almost hyperventilated for a moment before I was better. The worst ones were Dink, Sam, and your runs though. I was more afraid for the three of you then I have ever been in my entire life. I'm surprised I didn't give myself a heart attack.\" I sigh. \"Will… You shouldn't have worried about us. I know that Dink and Sam would say the same when I tell you that you just need to focus on the moment and not everyone else. It's dangerous for you to dwell on anything else. Certainly while you're in the middle of a run!\" I scold him before adding softer, \"I appreciate the concern, but if I was going to crash and hurt myself you would've seen it by now.\" My statement is followed by a small laugh from each of us. I had crashed too many times to count in front of him. \"I don't know. I think the whole event just gives me anxiety!\" He shrugs at me. \"I just couldn't help it. I don't know how I'll handle it next year.\" I grin. \"I'm sure you'll do fine. I'll make sure of it,\" I promise him. He gives me a challenging look. \"And how do you propose you'll do that?\" \"Magic,\" I wink at him and he chuckles and shakes his head at me. \"No really. I promise.\" \"Whatever you say.\" \"Of course,\" I grin at him. He rolls his eyes at me once more and I can't help, but laugh. \"C'mere,\" He mutters. I give him a look, but scoot a little bit closer to him. \"Okay.\" We're nearly touching now as we sit there and I turn my attention back to the boarders on the pipe. \"I just wanna say thanks… For everything,\" Will speaks quietly once more. I sit silent for a few moments. \"You don't need to thank me for anything.\" \"Oh shut up,\" He argues. We're sat there for a few moments of peaceful silence until I feel Will's hand turning my face to him. \"What?\" I ask him curious. \"Sometimes you just shock me and I'm pretty sure I'd like you to keep it up forever,\" he admits. I smirk and quip back with, \"I think I can handle that.\" He grins and responds quickly. \"This time it's my turn though.\" I raise an eyebrow and in moments my unasked question was answered. Will pressed his lips to mine and I pressed right back. I could definitely get used to this kind of surprise myself. AN- I really am sorry for the wait, but I've got this for you now. As normal it hasn't been edited. If there are any obnoxious issues leave me a review to let me know. I make no promises for a next update.[Chapter 24] AN- I'm back once more and I'm on winter break from Uni so I have some time to myself to write. I'm not guaranteeing a chapter a day or anything, but I'm definitely going to try and not leave you guys hanging for months again. I want to thank LoveShipper for her continued support and new (re)viewers Sarcasm-is-life, Alas De Fuego, CartoonGurl201m, TinkStar87, and goncalves. danieli. 88 (without the spaces). This chapter was per CartoonGurl201m's request and I hope you guys enjoy it. I haven't seen the movie since I went to college so I hope that I don't get anything too wrong. This is AU of course so it won't be exactly the same as the movie anyway. I did youtube the scene to get a feel for it so the initial dialogue should be right! Now we can finally return to (hopefully semi-) regular posting's of First Kiss! Peak Is this a date? I'm not sure because it's not like any date I've ever been on, but it feels kinda like a date… Maybe it's me just projecting my desire for it to be a date onto what is simply two friends getting ice cream. I get ice cream with the girls all the time and with them I know it's not a date. I guess that's the most realistic possibility and I just need to get my head together and stop being such a dork about this. I walk out of the little shop's warmth with my ice cream and wait at the steps for Will to join me. I look at the top of the mountain with it's intimidating silhouette standing tall in the night. I hear the door swing open behind me and say aloud, \"Have you ever noticed how sometimes that mountain looks really…\" I feel Will's presence behind me and he finishes my thought, \"Scary.\" \"Yeah,\" I agree with him quickly, still gazing intently at the mountain in the dull light. Does he feel awkward about this at all? I know I do a tiny bit, but does he? We start to walk towards home and Will keeps speaking,\"Tyson's peak is scary. Ice, wind, jagged rocks, seventy five foot drop off the vertical face,\" He lists off before commenting. \"It's intense.\" You know what else is intense? The awkwardness I'm feeling. I really need to let this go because Will probably just thinks that I'm some silly little girl and that I don't matter at all any way. He further explains \"Some people want to snowboard down it, but you can't get up there without a helicopter.\" This statement perks my interest because a challenge like that seems like something I could do to impress not only the other boarders, but maybe even Will. I'm obviously not really letting this go at all. \"Has anyone ever tried?\" I ask out of curiosity. Will responds bluntly, \"Yeah, Tyson. They never found his body.\" I can feel my eyes widen at the thought, but then Will begins to smirk and I know he's been playing me. Was that flirting? We both start laughing and I shove him playfully. I might as well flirt a little bit. \"No, but seriously there's no way down Tyson's 's… It's impossible,\" he explains seriously. I roll my eyes and blow his final comment off with a small laugh. \"Nothing's impossible.\" We walk a ways more and I change the subject from the foreboding peak in the distance to how the team has been shaping up. \"So tell me, honestly, what do you think our chances are at Fire and Ice?\" \"I'll admit at first it was shaky, but you guys are starting to look like a real threat out there,\" Will compliments the progress that we've made. I can feel the heat rising to my cheeks. I smile at his comment and respond before I lose my nerve. \"Because I've been thinking about something that could make our team an even bigger threat.\" Will doesn't so much as glance at me when he answers with an, \"Oh yeah? What's that?\" \"You,\" I answer firmly. He turns to face me and we stop walking. He gives me a look and asks, \"Me?\" with genuine confusion on his face. I give a hopeful smile and take one last leap of faith. \"I think you should compete with us.\" He gives me a stern look. \"That wasn't a part of our deal.\" \"I know, but Will I've seen you out in the snow. You look like you belong there. I've never seen anyone who loves it like you do. You need to get back out there.\" I push. Will shakes his head at me. \"I don't think so Kayla.\" \"C'mon!\" I try to coerce him. \"I mean you heard your mom! We make a great team. So let's make it official and take down the Swifts together.\" I give a him a hopeful smile and he shows no sign of changing his mind. He stands there and doesn't answer so I make one last request even though I'm feeling thoroughly discouraged at his response. \"Just promise me that you're going to think about it. Okay?\" When he maintains his silence I begin to feel even more dejected and say, \"Goodnight.\" Before I walk away to avoid any further disappointment I hear Will wish me a goodnight quietly as I leave him on the corner. I toss my ice cream out in the nearest trash can and stuff my hands in my pockets. I can't believe that I thought that would work… I was so foolish to think that Will would want to join the team because of me. If he wanted to board Dink or Sam would've convinced him by now. I deluded myself into thinking that I could change his mind. That he liked me and that I would ask him and he would agree and we'd go riding off into the sunset. How could I be so stupid? I can only hear the sound of my boots hitting the concrete as I work my way down the block and when I'm halfway there I can hear another set of footsteps approaching me from behind. \"Kayla. Hey wait up,\" I hear Will's voice from behind me. I can feel my eyebrows pull together as I turn on my heels to see Will approach me at a quicker pace. \"Yeah?\" I ask him. He finally catches up to me and replies with, \"I'm sorry.\" \"It's okay?\" My statement comes out as more of a question. He shakes his head at me. \"No. I've been shutting you out and pushing you away because I'm not being completely honest with you,\" he admits. I'm surprised at what he shares with me, but I tell him. \"That's alright Will. Really. We haven't know each other that long so I don't blame you. You don't have to tell me your life story or anything.\" I give him a reassuring smile. He frowns and is quiet for a moment. \"The thing is that isn't what this is about. There's nothing to do with my background and this has everything to do with the past few weeks.\" \"Well then feel free to tell me if you'd like,\" I encourage him gently. I don't want to push too hard. Will takes a deep breath and says, \"I'm really not good with words at all so I'll probably sound like a huge dork here, but I have been pretty stupid these past weeks and I owe you an explanation.\" I shrug at him and allow him to continue. \"I have avoided you as much as I could and given you the cold shoulder and done some rude things because you terrify me,\" he begins. \"You are charismatic and kind and you draw people to you and I just never thought of you as someone like that. It came out of the blue and it hit me hard. I thought of you as this pretentious girl that had everything given to her and then I met you, like really met you, and you're not even close to that. You helped my mom with her shop and you're good with the dogs, you're friends with Dink and Sam even though they're bumbling idiots sometimes and they hit on your friends. Mind you they're bad at it, but they try.\" We both laugh at his statement before he sobers and returns with great seriousness. \"Kayla, I am so sorry for the way that I've treated you. You deserve so much better than that from not only me, but everyone. You're an amazing, talented, beautiful girl and I can't apologize enough.\" I smile at him and pull him in for a hug without a word. Once we let go I begin to answer. \"It's totally fine and I'm in no way mad at you. I am glad that I've changed your opinion of me though.\" \"There's one more thing…\" Will adds. I give him a puzzled look. \"Okay…\" He pulls me in again and I think it's for another hug, but I was wrong. He kisses me gently and I feel like every part of me is hypersensitive. I can feel the snowflakes still falling on my exposed cheeks and Will's hands holding my waist and neck. It feels like magic and it ends too soon for my liking if I'm honest. \"Was that okay?\" He asks me unsure. I can only let out a giggle and smile as an answer before I pull him in for a hug. I'm nodding and smiling hugely into his jacket. Maybe I wasn't so deluded after all. AN- Here's another chapter for you guys. Sorry that it took so long. I just haven't had the time to write recently.[Chapter 25] AN- It's so nice to be back and updating for you guys! I'm really glad to see more activity in this community now that winter has come around again.:) I definitely feel like that is a big reason why. Thank you for your reviews LoveShipper, goncalves. danieli. 88, TinkStar87, CartoonGurl201m, Alas De Fuego, DanihhH, MyBookLife, calypso. hermione. tris, and a guest. We've broken 50 reviews and I can't begin to thank you all enough! I will not be replying to every review which was my standard previously. I just need you all to know that they are appreciated and that if you really want to talk to me you can PM me or inbox me on tumblr. I am nayeli13 there as well.:) This one is an AU that I think is pretty cute. I hope you all enjoy it! I present Chapter 25 (oh my gosh 25….) of First Kiss … Circle I'm running late for History because my gym class ran over schedule last period. I run through the hallway and people give me odd looks as I pass them. When I reach my class room I step in with just a few moments to spare. \"You barely made it Mr. Cloud. I suggest you make better time management skills,\" my english teacher Mr. Smith scolds. I simply nod, not in the mood to explain to my already cranky teacher. I walk to my desk and set my book and folders down before I notice a folded note already setting on my desk. There are no indications that the note is for me, but it sits on my desk and no one else has paid it any mind so I unfold it as class begins. Will, We've been dancing around each other for over a year now and I really like you. This might be childish, but I have a simple question. Do you like me? Circle yes or no. -Kayla I blink several times and reread the note. I can barely comprehend the words on the paper. Kayla and I have been dancing around each other. That's true. I've hesitated to ask her out too many times to count now. I don't have to think twice before I circle the option on the left and fold the note back up and put it in the pocket of my folder. I try to tune into the lecture. Really I do, but the note in my folder keeps drawing my attention back and a smile forms on my face as it finally sinks in. Kayla likes me. I never thought that we would ever come together this way. It's so juvenile. She asked me in a note. We're seniors in high school and it's kind of silly, but I have to admit that it's oddly charming. Kayla and I have never been conventional. We didn't come together in a normal way as friends and I think it's only fitting that we don't come together conventionally as a couple. I'm fidgety all class period and I relocate the note from my English folder to my back pocket. I walk past Kayla's locker on the way to my next period and debate about slipping the note into her locker. I stand awkwardly in the corridor for a few moments before I walk away in fear of being caught. I'll give it to her another way. I turn the corner and enter my English class. I focus on the class period and when it slows down at the end I let my mind wander. Kayla has this class next period and it's her last class of the day so I can leave the note for her and drop by after… I ponder the thought. It would be reminiscent of how she left the note for me and that's fair. The bell rings and I am forced to decide. I stand briskly and leave the room without a second thought. At practice after school I'm pretending like nothing happened and I never allow Kayla to get me alone. After I make some slight changes to the note I sneak it into one of her textbooks for her to inevitably find sometime tomorrow or even tonight. It'll be better if she finds it when I'm not around because that's how I received her note. My nerves are on fire and I'm impatiently waiting for tomorrow to come. I'm setting at lunch waiting for the group to catch up and I hear a tray hit the table next to me. I look up to see Kayla smile at me as she sits down. I turn my attention back to my food when I hear the sound of unfolding paper and she slides the note over to me. I can see her original writing and my messy, but bold circles around the yes , but under in my handwriting it reads. Kayla, I can't believe you actually asked me that. I thought that I was being obvious. Now I have a question for you. Will you be my girlfriend? Circle yes or no. -Will She had clearly bolded the yes in my note before circling it. It takes me a few moments to realize that I'm grinning stupidly at this note while she's picking at her plate. After that realization it takes me about half a second to act. I turn to her and pull her in for a kiss. It's only momentary, but it feels incredible and I can't wait for more to come. Her soft smile and my easy grin after are the best part. This girl makes me feel comfortable and safe and I don't know what I'd do without her. AN- Not quite sure how I feel about this one. I like the concept, but I feel that my execution isn't right. Sorry to leave y'all hanging for months again. I just have a busy life. I just keep telling myself that at least there's no real plot and that I'm not leaving you with any cliffhangers. Also I didn't edit this because I'm lazy and I wanted to post. SO there. ","Summary":" AN- PLEASE READ THIS. I KNOW IT'S LONG. So I haven't been posting any stories recently and this mov"},{"Movie":"Son of Batman","Title":"Not What It Seems","Author":"MoonfireHikari","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11478978","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Hello, everyone! :) I just have to make an introduction. I adore Damian, because of the movies, so I just had the urge to write a story about him. I hope you enjoy this as far as it gets. Do leave a review and tell me what you think. ;) Chapter 1: \"Please, don't hurt my family…\" a man, around his thirties, begged. \"Should've thought of that before you decided to turn your back on us!\" the killer shouted. The slash of the sword and the man's last grunt were heard. Blood splashed all over the floor of the living room. Two dead bodies laid there, a man and a woman. The killers did not know of another presence which was inside the chimney. After a few hours of hiding there, she crawled out. Her legs and arms were worn out from holding herself up inside the chimney far too long. \"Mom…Dad…\" she bit her lower lip, \"I'll find whoever is responsible for this…\" Her eyes were indeed swollen and the upper part of her blouse were soaked with her tears. She heard the front door creaked opened. She hid behind the sofa. The sound of footsteps were getting louder and louder until it stopped. \"Hmm…? You don't need to hide…\" a somewhat unfamiliar voice said to her. \"How did you know I was hiding?\" the girl said, popping her head from behind the sofa. She gulped at the person she was talking too. A person, respected by millions of people, roams the city at night, the Batman. She stood up straight but didn't look at him. Staring at the dead bodies, he asked, \"Care to tell me what happened?\" She bit her lower lip before staring at the dead bodies of her parents. She held her hands together, refusing to talk. \"How did you survive?\" he asked another question. She glanced up at him, before pointing at the chimney. That explained why she was covered in soot. \"I see… I will find the ones who killed your parents,\" Batman promised. She nodded, holding in her tears. Batman stared at her for mere seconds. She had orange knee-length hair and brown eyes. A very good body figure for her age, which explains how she managed to hide so well inside the chimney and how they didn't notice her. She blinked as he stared at her. \"Hmmm…\" he hummed. \"Welcome back, Sir,\" Alfred, his friend, as referred by Batman, greeted him as usual. Batman got out of his Batmobile with Daphne, the girl from before. She opened up enough to tell Batman her name, but that was all. The girl bowed to Alfred. \"And who is this, Sir?\" the man asked. \"Daphne, she'll be staying with us,\" Batman explained. \"Clearly, you're not going to make her the next Batgirl, are you, Sir?\" Alfred asked, observing Daphne. \"No, I couldn't leave her in the mansion with two dead bodies. Those killers will search for her once they found out…\" Batman explained. \"And you…took her in?\" Alfred asked, raising his brow at the man in front of him. Daphne didn't say anything. She looked away, avoiding their eyes when they looked at her. Batman nodded to Alfred's question. \"Prepare a room for her. I'll need her to stay with us for a while. I promised I'd find her parents' killers,\" Batman requested. \"As you wish, Sir. This way, Miss Daphne…\" Alfred said. Daphne bowed to the Batman, who had taken his mask off. She rushed to follow Alfred. They exited the Batcave and into the mansion. Alfred only explained the places they were passing by. She saw the living room, the dining room, a place which looked like a library to her and soon, they reached the bedroom prepared for her. \"I hope this is comfortable enough for you,\" Alfred said. Daphne nodded. \"Thank you,\" was all she replied. \"Would you like anything to eat?\" he asked. Shaking her head, she replied, \"I want to sleep. Please, leave me alone. Thank you again.\" In another part of the city, a twelve-year-old girl slammed her room door, anger filled her. She flipped her hair and huffed. She made her way to a certain room where her so-called Boss resides. \"So, you killed all of her family members?\" a voice from the darkness asked his underlings. \"Yes…as she had asked,\" one, out of five of them, answered. \"They didn't kill all…\" the girl's voice was heard from across the corridor. She stepped into the room where they were discussing. The underlings kneeled as she was a respected guest. The man turned around to face her. He smirked at her. She crossed her arms and smirked too. Her expression changed when she saw his face. \"You look a bit wounded. What happened? Did the infiltration fail?\" the twelve-year-old girl asked. \"It is not an infiltration…and no, we managed to kill Ra's as I had expected from me,\" he replied, rather proud of himself. \"Well, I congratulate you for that, but they failed to kill all of my family members as I wanted them. My sister is still out there,\" the girl replied, angry. \"B-But, there were only a man and a woman when we ambushed the mansion! There was no other girl!\" \"Hush!\" the man behind the desk shouted at them. \"Punish them the way you want. We will find your precious little sister, Delphinium.\" Delphinium glared at the men before turning back to her Boss. \"We can start with the school she and I go to. I'm sure she would be there.\" \"Are you certain? Her parents were just killed. What makes you think she'd be there right after her parents' death?\" the man asked her. \"Oh,…she's my sister. I know her,\" Delphinium muttered, exiting the room.[Chapter 2] For this chapter, we will enter the first movie, Son of Batman. Enjoy! :) Chapter 2: \"Good morning, Miss Daphne,\" Alfred greeted the girl as always. \"Good morning, Alfred. Has Master Bruce gone to work?\" Daphne replied, smiling happily. \"Yes. He had just left,\" Alfred replied. Daphne made some toast and fried two pieces of bacon for her breakfast. She chewed on them as she poured some coffee. Alfred was busy wiping the cup he had just washed. \"Are you taking your bike today?\" he asked. She nodded. \"Yes. I have to stay in shape. Oh! Give this to Master Bruce. I'll be back before dinner.\" \"As you wish, Miss Daphne,\" Alfred replied, sighing. The girl rushed out, got her bike and started her way to school. It had been a month since she stayed with Bruce. She had told Bruce about her parents' death in her point of view. Bruce found her somewhat useful because she is really sneaky and good at collecting information. Apparently, she had found out who was behind her parents' death and who kidnapped her sister. Sadly, her sister was still missing. Batman had been trying to find her, but he had a lot of other matters to settle, too. Even Daphne herself had no leads whatsoever regarding her sister. \"Good morning, Daphne,\" the guard at the front gate of school smiled to her. \"Morning, Sir! Another great day today!\" Daphne replied, setting her bike at its usual place. The first bell rang. The girl rushed to her class as usual, hoping that it would be another same boring day: getting ignored, getting hit on and getting bullied because she is an orphan. Bruce came home by lunch time. He had gotten a text from Alfred regarding the note from Daphne. \"Master Bruce, welcome back. Would you like some lunch?\" Alfred greeted. \"I'd like that. Where's the girl?\" Bruce asked. \"At school, Sir. She left you a note I mentioned…about a man named Waylon Jones,\" Alfred explained. \"When will she be back?\" Bruce asked again. \"She said she'll be back by dinner, Sir. Would you like me to call her?\" \"No, I know where I can find her. Let's get lunch first.\" Meanwhile, Daphne was just about done with school. Some girls were whispering about her, but she ignored them as always. She paced up her walk to where her bike was parked. Her phone vibrated. Guessing it was her caretaker, she rejected the incoming call. She took a right turn on the road to head to her old home, the place where it all started to change. \"What better place to search for clues than my old home. I need to find my sister…\" Daphne muttered, determined. She reached her old mansion in no time. As usual, there would be two guards guarding the front gate. Daphne hid behind some bushes. She listened in to their conversation. \"I wonder why we're guarding this place. Clearly, there's no one at all here,\" one of them complained. \"Yeah, but we can't beat our own boss. I heard someone tried to break in a few nights ago, so we had to tighten our security,\" the other replied, sighing. \"Are there still any valuables in there? They took'em out after the parents' death, didn't they?\" \"Yeah…apparently, a lunatic claiming to be the heir to this family stopped them from doing so. But, hey! That lunatic's paying us to guard this place.\" \"A lunatic? The heir?\" Daphne muttered. She stepped closer to the gate, hiding in the bushes. When the guards weren't looking, she slipped in. They didn't even notice her. When she was inside the lawn, she started to hurry her pace towards the front door. She was lucky she still had her spare key. Once the door was unlocked, she entered her old home. The security was still not tight as there was no one inside the mansion. The place where her parents' had died were marked. She roamed the mansion, excluding the living room, freely. \"I should start by reading father's documents. I only knew we had a company by our family's name and it is worldwide…\" she muttered to herself, making her way to her father's study. She started choosing random documents from one of the shelves and started reading them. Nothing seemed all that important, but she kept on skimming through. She smiled when she saw some pictures of her sister when she was her age. They look exactly the same. She read some more. Some pages of the documents were missing as if someone was trying to hide something from her. \"There's nothing much here…\" she sighed, laying down on the floor. She took hold of a picture of a quite old man. \"Slade Wilson…\" she muttered. \"I thought so you'd be here. It was weird when Alfred told me you wanted to go out today, so I had to look it up. You promised you'd leave Batman the case of your parents' death,\" Bruce said sternly. Daphne got up. She looked away from his eyes. \"I just wanted to help. You're always busy fighting crimes that you hardly had time to look into my sister's kidnapping.\" Bruce took her hand, pulling her to follow him. The guards were shocked to see her as they exited the place she once called home. She didn't look at them. Her expression was bitter as she was put in the backseat of his car. He started to drive towards his mansion. \"How did you get in?\" Daphne asked him again. \"Unlike you who like sneaking around, I am a respected man. I was an acquaintance of your father's once…\" Bruce said. \"I knew that. I knew everything about Bruce Wayne, except the fact that he is Batman,\" Daphne replied, looking a bit down. \"Look, I will find your sister,\" Bruce sighed. \"I just thought I could be of help…\" the girl bit her lower lip. \"I will call you if I need you…\" he replied. They were soon back at the mansion. It was almost dinner time and Alfred was busy preparing them. Daphne decided to help. Bruce didn't stay to join them because Batman had work to do. \"The lead you gave about Waylon Jones is quite useful. I'll be sure to capture him tonight…\" he said to Daphne. The girl took a deep breath and said, \"Good luck.\" He started his Batmobile and drove off. Daphne sighed and went back to the kitchen. Alfred had already served all of the food they had cooked. He flashed a smile at her before sitting down at his usual spot. She sat down with him and they started to eat. Daphne tossed and turned in bed, thinking about her sister. She finally decided to take a bath when Alfred knocked on her door. \"What is it, Alfred?\" she asked. \"We have a guest coming by. Will you prepare a room? I will go greet him. He'll be here with Master Bruce,\" Alfred explained. \"Him? … Okay…\" she sighed as she got out of her bed. She fixed her maid uniform. Then, she got to a room next to hers with a broom and some other cleaning kit. She started cleaning up the place, trying to guess who the guest would be. She hummed a tune as she did her work. \"I hope this isn't too cramped for you,\" she heard Alfred said, opening the door. Daphne stood up as she was wiping the floor by the bed. \"Alfred, it's not ready!\" she half screamed. Alfred raised a brow at the girl. Daphne turned to observe the boy who was with him. He was wearing a very odd attire in her view. As she had seen pictures, she could see that he looked exactly like the young Bruce Wayne. She wondered who he was. \"Is this her?\" the boy asked. \"Yes, Master Damian. She will be taking care of all of your needs. Daphne, please make him feel…\" he glanced up at the two of them and continued, \"…comfortable…\" Daphne nodded. She fixed her maid uniform and approached Damian to introduce herself. \"W-Well, that door leads to the bathroom and the other one leads to the game room. Y-You also have the tv to keep you entertained…\" Daphne started after telling him her name. \"Your name is just Daphne?\" he asked, furrowing his brows at her. \"Y-Yes. Is there a p-problem?\" she asked, looking down from his glare. \"Prepare some tea. Brown sugar instead of white, fresh cut lemon, a China cup,\" Damian said. Daphne glanced up at Alfred who was wearing his usual expression. The butler rolled his eyes as he exited the room. Daphne bowed to Damian before running to catch up with Alfred. Alfred didn't say anything when they were in the kitchen. He helped Daphne to prepare Damian's tea while preparing some tea for Bruce. Then, he went to the Batcave. Daphne brought the tea for Damian. \"How long have you been here?\" he asked her. \"Umm…about a month or so,\" she replied. \"Anything else I can help you with?\" \"Draw me a bath. I'd like to take one after this tea,\" he ordered. Daphne nodded. She was dismissed after that order. She went to the Batcave to see Bruce discussing something with Alfred. When she got there, they stopped their discussion. She looked at the screen to see Ra's face. She sweat dropped but she didn't ask anything. \"Daphne, fetch your uniform. I need you to do some digging tonight. I need you to go and ask Killer Croc some questions,\" Bruce spoke up. \"I have school tomorrow and that man scares me,\" she replied. \"Skip school. I'll inform your teacher that you're sick or something. I've told Gordon to accompany you,\" her caretaker replied calmly. She sighed and abided by his order. She went to change into her uniform.[Chapter 3] Chapter 3: \"I've got to get down to the office. How's Damian?\" Bruce asked as he took a bite of his toast. \"See for yourself,\" Alfred said, gesturing towards the windows. \"Good morning, Master Bruce, Alfred. I'll head to school. I can still make it for the second period if I hurry. I'll eat on the way,\" Daphne said, walking up to the toaster with two pieces of bread. She didn't bother to see what they were looking at. Once the toasts were done, she was on her way out of the manor. She strolled down to get her bike. She suddenly heard footsteps coming from the garden on her left. She turned to see who it was when slash went the sword. Before she could react properly, the skin of her arm was cut. She dropped her toasts. Staring at the blood gushing out, \"Ahhh!\" she screamed. Bruce and Alfred rushed to see what had happened. Damian sheathed the sword and stared at the girl who was already on her knees. He raised a brow towards her. \"How did you walk without making any sounds at all?\" he asked. \"Sword…blood…mother…father…\" she muttered over and over again as if it was a chant. \"What's wrong with her?\" Damian asked the two men who were standing there. \"Miss Daphne, you need medical help. Let's go back inside…\" Alfred said, taking the girl with him. \"What's up with her? It is just a cut…\" the young boy huffed. Bruce stared for mere seconds before proceeding to his car. Damian furrowed his brows. Meanwhile, Alfred was patching up Daphne's arm. Just like Damian had said, it was just a cut. Daphne was still chanting the words over and over again. \"All done, Miss Daphne,\" the butler said. \"T-Thank you, Alfred…\" she sighed, staring at the bandage. \"Are you okay now, Miss?\" the butler was concerned. Daphne forced a smile before replying, \"Yes, I'm fine. I just…I think I should really skip school today…\" Alfred nodded to her words. Damian came in and Daphne was a bit nervous. Alfred glanced up at the boy and then, continued staring at the girl. She didn't look at him because she knew he still had that sword with him. Damian didn't care much about the girl, considering she was already treated. He turned to the butler. \"Pennyworth, I would like two pieces of French toasts and a glass of milk for my breakfast. Send it to my room once it's done.\" \"As you wish, Master Damian,\" Alfred bowed. The boy took one more glance of Daphne before making his way back to his bedroom. Daphne stared into spaces as Alfred prepared Damian's breakfast. She was still not in the mood to be moving around. She was surprised that the boy possesses such good skills. \"I will go send his breakfast. What will you be doing, Miss Daphne?\" the butler asked her. Daphne turned to him, somewhat stunned. \"O-Oh! I-I'll send it to h-his room. It is my job after all…\" \"You don't have to force yourself, Miss,\" Alfred refused to give her the tray he was holding. \"I'll do it…\" she tried to sound firm but failed. Alfred blinked once and nodded. She took the tray and went right up to Damian's room. She knocked and opened the door after he told so. He was sitting on his bed, wiping the sword that had cut her. She gulped, trying to ignore the sharp object. She placed the tray on the table beside her. \"W-Would you like anything else?\" she asked. \"Look at me when you're talking to me, servant,\" he demanded. Daphne glanced up at him. The sword was next to him. It still seemed eerie to her. She hugged herself, biting her lower lip. Damian sighed. He got out of bed and went closer to her. \"Now, talk,\" he ordered. The girl looked up at him and asked again, \"Would you…like anything else?\" \"No. I'm going out. Don't bother following me…and DON'T tell Pennyworth,\" he replied rather coldly. Daphne nodded. She exited the room. She went to her room and put on her uniform. Damian was to be her responsibility and she had to watch him at all cost. That was what Bruce had asked her to do if she was not sent on missions. She had to what was right, even if it meant sneaking out in broad daylight in a black suit. \"You shouldn't wear that, Miss,\" Alfred startled her. \"Alfred!\" she sighed. \"What should I wear then?\" \"Just a nice dress. Are you heading out?\" the butler asked, going to her cupboard. She nodded. \"I had to do it. He's gone out, right?\" she asked the butler. Alfred laid a piece of plain pink dress. He nodded to her question. She sighed, taking the dress. The butler walked away. She changed into the dress. Tying her hair into pigtails, she went on her way. Damian was taking it easy, walking down the road which would lead to Wayne Tower where Bruce's office was. How did he even know that? Daphne, of course, kept her distance from him. She knew that he couldn't sense her, so she was quite safe. Damian had to sneak his way into the office while Daphne simply walked in from the entrance. People knew her to be one of Bruce's relative of the sort. Bruce brought her to the office once in a while. \"I wonder why he's here?\" she muttered. \"Good morning, Daphne. Why are you here today?\" a young woman asked her. \"Oh, good morning! I'm here to see Ma- I mean, Uncle Bruce…\" she replied, grinning. She rushed to his office before Bruce could reach it. Damian was already there, skimming through some things on the computer. He sighed again when he saw her. Bruce came in a few seconds after the girl. \"What the hell?\" an old man said. \"Your profit margin is down in Argentina. Someone is skimming revenue,\" the black haired boy said confidently. \"Argentina? That's my division. Bruce,\" the woman beside Bruce said. \"It's okay, it's alright. I'll deal with this,\" Bruce said calmly, closing the door on the four people that had come in with him. Daphne backed away as Bruce approached him. \"What are you doing?\" the man asked. \"Reviewing my birth rights. This will be mine someday,\" Damian replied. Bruce looked up at the orange haired girl. \"I'm here because he is my responsibility,\" she explained. \"She's good at tracking me down. Is she a spy?\" Damian asked. Bruce ignored his question. \"How did you get in here?\" \"A bird's nest has better security,\" Damian stood up and stared out through the glass windows. \"We need to talk.\" Daphne and Bruce looked at each other before turning to him. Damian started, \"Deathstroke has a contact stationed here.\" \"In Gotham?\" Bruce asked, glancing up at the girl who shook her head rapidly. \"We find him, we find Deathstroke. We could take Deathstroke out…permanently.\" \"We don't kill,\" Bruce said sternly. Daphne didn't say anything. She didn't like the idea of killing someone, but she knew something about Deathstroke: he killed her parents. \"I was taught to destroy your enemy,\" Damian argued. \"That makes you like them,\" Bruce replied. \"It makes me better than them! Deathstroke killed my grandfather! He has to pay!\" Damian said, clenching both of his fists. \"Ra's was a mad man,\" Bruce stated. \"He was a hero. He died a hero,\" Damian replied. Bruce looked into the boy's eyes while he glared back. Daphne was told to call Alfred the very moment. Damian took out a rectangular device. He pressed it, popping out a hologram of a man. \"Ubu's Deathstroke's right-hand man. He used to work for my grandfather. He stays in Gotham City between missions to indulge his…vices, according to mother. I looked up the rest,\" Damian explained. \"This is classified mate- wait, you downloaded this from the computer in the Batcave, didn't you?\" \"I hacked into NORAD when I was six. It was easy…\" Damian replied calmly. Bruce looked sternly at his son. Daphne pulled at his shirt before he could say anything. She told him that Alfred was arriving. He sighed, patting the girl's head to calm himself. They went outside just as Alfred arrived. Bruce opened the car's door for the two kids. Daphne went in first and then, Damian. \"Alfred's to take you directly home, no stops. You will not go off on your own for any reasons, you will stay away from the Batcave computer and you will stay out of sight. Do you understand?\" Bruce lectured him. \"I owe my grandfather a death,\" was Damian's reply and he closed the door. Damian grunted as Alfred started to drive. Daphne stared at the boy. He somehow reminded her of her older sister. They have the same stubborn, but determined attitude. Damian, knowing she was staring at him, glanced up at her. She stopped what she was doing and looked away immediately. \"If you have something to say, say it, servant,\" he demanded. Daphne sighed. \"I was just wondering… Have you ever killed someone?\" \"I was trained to do so,\" he crossed his arms. \"Was it fun? Training all the time?\" Daphne suddenly said. She covered her mouth with both of her hands after that, shaking her head. She didn't mean to ask the question. Damian raised a brow. \"Fun? Why would it be fun? I am Ra's al Ghul's grandson. I am expected to succeed in every training I undergo,\" he said proudly. \"I see. I'm sorry I asked…\" she drawled. \"Why are you apologizing…?\" he asked. \"It didn't sound fun at all. I mean, I have my own share of suffering, but it's just sad… Don't you have free time? When you can go and play with your friends?\" Daphne asked. Damian, astounded by the question, didn't reply a single word. Alfred, of course, heard every part of the conversation. He couldn't help but smile at the last question Daphne asked. That night, Daphne was going to sleep when Damian suddenly barged into her room. She was stunned but she wasn't that surprised. He pierced his glares at her. \"Where is Ubu?\" he asked. \"Why are you asking me?\" she asked back. \"I hacked into every part of his computer but found nothing. I did find out that you were his information gatherer. So you must know. Where is he?\" \"Even if I do know, I won't tell you, Master Damian. Master Bruce told you not to go anywhere, right?\" Daphne replied, pulling on her quilt. Damian pulled the quilt off of her and onto the floor. Daphne gasped at what he had just done. She sat up in bed, avoiding his piercing gaze. \"W-What are you going to do when you find out?\" she asked. \"Just tell me where he is!\" Damian half shouted.[Chapter 4] Chapter 4: Daphne stood behind a large building, eyeing Damian who was atop the building next to hers. He had stormed off right after she told him where Ubu resides. She had to follow him because she was worried about what Bruce would do to him if he ever finds out what his son was up to. She jumped onto the roof as Damian broke the glass ceiling and ambushed Ubu's penthouse. She could hear gunshots and some women screaming. She took that as a sign to go and stop Damian. She peeked through the broken glasses and could see Damian, thrown down from the bar counter. Ubu took out a pair of steel claws. Daphne watched as Damian's sword clashed with Ubu's claws. She wondered what she could do. \"Where is Deathstroke?\" Damian demanded. Smirking, Ubu replied, \"Did you think it would be that easy? Just ask and I would talk?\" Damian smirked, throwing away his sword. \"I don't want it to be easy,\" he charged at Ubu. He kicked the man out of the penthouse, crashing onto the glass doors. He ran out to catch Ubu. Ubu jumped off onto the nearest rooftop. He tried to speed up in order to escape from Damian, but the boy was fast. Daphne watched from afar. She mentally groaned at the boy's actions. Delphinium walked along the corridor of the stronghold in Interlaken. Deathstroke was there, planning his next move to take over the League of Assassins. He was holding Dr. Langstrom's family and Talia as hostages. She was assigned to torture Talia into telling where her son was. She didn't do much, though. \"You really love your son…\" Delphinium said, putting away the whip she was using just now. \"What mother doesn't?\" Talia replied, looking up at her. Delphinium mumbled something that Talia didn't hear. The girl glared at Talia. The woman gazed into the girl's eyes. She wasn't wearing any mask to cover any part of her face as if she wanted people to know who she is. \"What is your name?\" Talia suddenly asked. Turning her back to Talia, the girl replied, \"I'm not allowed to engage in conversations with you unless it's about your son…\" She exited the torture room after that. Delphinium had already known where Damian, Talia's son was taken. She didn't want to reveal it to Deathstroke because she had her own agenda. \"Miss Delphinium, Deathstroke has summoned you to his room,\" an underling said to her. She nodded, heading straight to his room. Deathstroke was sitting in his chair, resting both of his arms on the desk in front of him. He shot a death glare towards the girl. \"Do you need something?\" she asked. \"I'm sending you on an errand to Gotham City. You can find your sister while you're there. Stay close to Langstrom,\" Deathstroke ordered. \"Hmmm? Fine, I'll do it. Anything else you want?\" she replied. \"I need you to report to me the first batch of our own man-bats. Whether it is a success or not,\" the old man continued. \"Affirmative,\" Delphinium replied. She took her leave to head to her room to prepare. All she needed was her gloves and a mask. She wouldn't want anyone to recognize her there because it held a lot of her past. Damian was tied up by Nightwing, Batman's trusted partner. He had chased Ubu out into the street and was almost about to stab him when Nightwing gave him a kick in the gut to stop him. Daphne was on her knees again, because she had just witnessed a fight between Nightwing and Damian. In her opinion, it was a fight to the death. Damian was not afraid of killing at all. Her breathing was ragged again. Nightwing was just about done calling Batman. When he saw her state, he volunteered a hand for her to stand up, even though he was in a worse condition. \"You okay?\" Nightwing asked. \"Y-Yeah…but, you're not! Look at you!\" Daphne's voice cracked. She was about to cry. \"I'll ask Alfred to patch me up once we get back to the Batcave. Batman is on his way to fetch us all. Ubu needs medical help too, so I asked him to call Gordon,\" the young man explained. The Batmobile stopped right in front of them, along with a police car. Gordon came out of the police car to get Ubu. The Batmobile's window slid opened for the two to get in. Nightwing dragged the tied up Damian with him. Daphne sat beside Batman and they were off. Daphne took off her mask. She sighed, fixing her hair. \"It was you all along?!\" Damian exclaimed. \"Who else would fall on their knees when they see a sword?\" Nightwing replied. \"Daphne, I'm gonna need you with me after this,\" Batman spoke. \"O-Okay…\" Daphne sighed. They soon arrived at the Batcave. Alfred was waiting like always. Damian jumped out of the mobile, watching Daphne helping Nightwing out. He was put in a chair and Alfred started to tend to his wounds at once. Batman went to his computer to contact Gordon. \"It really ticks me off after all those lectures he gave me about using protection,\" Nightwing muttered. \"Indeed…\" Alfred replied. Hearing Nightwing cringed, he asked, \"Master Dick, are you alright?\" \"I took the cut, I can take the stitch,\" Dick replied, smiling. Daphne went beside him. She didn't look that high-spirited like she used to be. \"I'm fine, Daphne,\" Dick reassured her, patting her head. The girl smiled at him. Dick was like a brother to her. When she first came here, Dick Grayson had always been there for her. Bruce was always busy fighting crime and so was Dick, but he could still make time for her. Daphne started to talk after Dick shared his past with her. She started sticking with him and training again, learning most of his moves in no time. The one thing she couldn't bring herself to do was killing people. \"Maybe you need more anesthetic,\" Damian suddenly said with a sly smile. The three looked up at him. \"And maybe you need to go f-\" \"Master Dick!\" Alfred interrupted his words. Damian turned away after saying, \"Maybe you should remember who the blood son is.\" \"Bloodthirsty is more like it,\" Dick replied. Daphne was called by Batman. She rushed to his side. Gordon was on the line and he wanted her to listen with him. She put on her mask. \"How's Ubu?\" Batman asked Gordon. \"He's got more monitors connected to him than Arkham has on Lunatic,\" Gordon replied. \"Can he talk?\" Batman asked. \"Talk? It's a wonder he could breathe…\" Gordon replied, staring at Ubu. \"I'll stay in touch. Might even send her out again,\" Batman muttered, glancing up at the girl on his right. Batman sighed while Daphne touched his arm as comfort. Damian came up to his father. Daphne backed away a bit, getting the vibe that she should not interfere. Damian spoke up, \"He doesn't deserve to breathe.\" His father stood up, pushed his chair and pierced his gaze at Damian. Daphne gulped as Dick sweat dropped. \"Do you know what you were tonight? You weren't a warrior, you weren't a soldier…you were a child,\" Batman said sternly. \"If it hadn't been for him, I-\" he pointed an accusing finger on Dick. Batman cut him off, \"If it hadn't been for Dick, you'd have gotten too far. Daphne didn't even know how to explain your actions.\" \"It's easier my way!\" Damian replied. \"It has nothing to do with easy. It's about doing what's right because it's right and that's the only reason you need.\" \"It seemed right to me,\" the boy replied. \"That's the problem,\" Batman replied, walking up to his mobile. He took something out and threw it at Damian, \"Heads up!\" Damian caught it in his hand. He stared. Daphne peered her head to see what it was. It was a shuriken. She recognized the symbol. \"Good reflexes,\" the father praised. \"What if I had missed?\" Damian asked. \"It would have hurt,\" Batman replied. \"That's the star representing the League of Assassin,\" Daphne spoke up. Damian turned to her. \"How did you know that?\" She looked down. \"My sister had a necklace with that symbol as a locket. Also, a similar shuriken was left when she went missing. I looked into it.\" \"I found it in a warehouse, belonging to a man named Langstrom. Ring a bell?\" Batman asked his son. \"No,\" Damian replied short. Batman turned to Daphne. \"What about you, Phoenix?\" \"Hmm… I did what you asked. Apparently, Deathstroke paid a visit to Dr. Langstrom before taking him away. He mentioned something about a deal Ra's made with the professor, but I don't know what it is. They took him away after that…and they took his family too,\" Daphne explained. \"You went to his house?\" Damian asked. \"I did what I was told to. That's my job,\" the girl shrugged. She didn't mind doing anything for Bruce since he took her into custody. He even taught her about business so that she can manage her family's business in the future. \"It seems there is a deeper connection to Ra's and Deathstroke,\" Batman muttered. \"Umm…\" Daphne interrupted. \"What is it, Daphne?\" Batman asked. \"Deathstroke is Slade Wilson… He was my father's friend once. He was very kind and he never showed his bloodlust. My sister looks up to him. He always mentioned about a new successor for a business he was supposed to take over. He kept on saying that he was the one who deserve the business,\" the girl explained. \"How did you know that?\" Damian demanded. Daphne gave out a small smile to Batman. He knew what she meant. That was all they could get from her that night. She wasn't ready to tell the rest. Gordon had summoned Batman the very same night. He was about to head out when Damian stopped him. \"I wanna help, like he used to,\" the boy said, pointing the shuriken towards Dick. \"It's bad enough you've given yourself away and let them know we're onto them. But you're letting vengeance guide your actions,\" Batman said. \"You've never felt vengeful?\" Damian asked. \"Every day,\" Batman replied, walking passed him. \"You have to keep your center, Damian. You can't fight crime by becoming a criminal.\" He turned to his son. Damian looked up at him. \"From now on, stay close. That's an order.\" Damian tilted his head a bit. \"I can do that.\" \"Wait…I'm not gonna like this, am I?\" Dick asked. \"Nope,\" was Bruce's answer. In five minutes, Damian got out of his bathroom, donning the Robin uniform. He looked at himself. Daphne was on his bed, waiting for him. She stood up. \"You look great!\" she said, smiling happily. \"Tell me something…\" Damian said. \"Hmm?\" Daphne titled her head to the right. The boy was quiet for a few seconds. \"Never mind…\" he muttered, walking passed her and exiting the room. Daphne sighed. Alfred came in with a smile plastered on his face. \"What's so funny, Alfred?\" Daphne demanded, standing up from the bed. \"It seems like the young master has taken a liking to you,\" Alfred explained. \"He calls me 'servant'. That's not really liking, is it?\" Daphne replied, sighing. Alfred chuckled. They exited the room and walked to the kitchen together. Alfred made her a warm milk before telling her to go to sleep. She abided because she needed rest anyways. She didn't know that a guest was waiting for her in her own room.[Chapter 5] Just a note, the Italic words are flashbacks. I skipped a few parts of each scene to make this story evolve around the two sisters. It's hard to keep track of both of them. Don't forget to leave a review. Suggestions are welcome as well. :) Chapter 5: Delphinium strolled around the underground of the Gotham Coliseum. Deathstroke's men bowed as she passed them. She rolled her eyes at them. She soon reached the professor's room. Her communicator which she wore on her left ear started beeping, signing an incoming call. She tapped it once with her finger. \"Hello? Yes…I sent her there already. The boys should be taking her back. No, not my room. Put her in the same room as Talia,\" Delphinium said to the caller. After hanging up, she pulled up her mask and entered the room. Dr. Langstrom was a bit shocked to see her. She smiled at him, walking around the room and observing it. \"The first batch looks good, professor,\" she started. \"H-How's my family?\" Dr. Langstrom asked. \"Don't worry. I make sure they're comfortable…\" the girl sneered. \"P-Please…let them-\" he didn't get to finish his words. Delphinium shot a death glare towards the door. She muttered, \"He's coming for you…\" She backed away and faded into the darkness. Batman and Robin entered the room, startling Dr. Langstrom. Batman told him that he needed to come with them, but he refused. Delphinium stood at her hiding spot, listening. \"Deathstroke has my family. He says he'll kill them if I don't do what he wants,\" the professor explained, scared. \"Where is Deathstroke?\" Batman asked. \"I-I don't know… You have to believe me,\" he muttered. Robin charged at him. \"I'll make you talk!\" he shouted. \"Robin, no!\" Batman shouted as the boy flipped Dr. Langstrom and threw him onto a table. The professor hit some lab equipment on the table and crashed into the door. The door was destroyed, causing the professor to crash hard into the wall outside. Delphinium shook her head at Damian's actions. Some guards saw him collapsed and rushed into the room. Damian kicked both of the guards charging towards him. Batman hit one with a chair. Damian took the sword that was sticking on the table, smirking. \"No swords!\" Batman said sternly. \"Fine!\" Damian replied, kicking another guard. Delphinium stepped into the dimmed light. She was smirking. \"Miss!\" one of the guards called her before getting a clean kick in the stomach from Damian. \"Miss?\" the wonder boy muttered. During the commotion, Langstrom made his escape. Most of the men in the room were already knocked out, which was why Delphinium made an appearance. She knew it was safe to speak to them. She stood in front of Batman and Robin. They were both ready to attack her. She flipped her hair once and the two watched as it laid back on her shoulders. \"Hello, Batman, Robin…or should I say, Bruce Wayne, Damian, Ra's grandson…\" she said confidently. \"How did you?!\" Damian demanded, but Batman restrained him from doing anything rash. Delphinium scoffed, \"I'll let you escape. Deathstroke wanted to deal with you personally. I'd figured… He has a complex over you. Oh, and I already blocked the cameras, so it's not taping our conversation.\" \"What are you?\" Batman muttered. \"I'm just a girl…just like little Phoenix,\" Delphinium said. She ran out of the room after that. Some more men charged into the room a few seconds after she left. They were ready to attack. \"Time to retreat!\" Batman stated. \"I'm no coward,\" Damian said. \"Don't be stupid,\" his father replied before throwing some tear bombs to create camouflage. Meanwhile, Daphne opened her eyes to find herself in a dark room. Well, she was used to that. However, the room was not so familiar to her. It wasn't her bedroom and it wasn't the room she would use to train with Dick either. She looked around, there was not much light. She tried to stand up but her whole body ached. \"Urgh…what happened? The last thing I remember was…entering my room to go to sleep…\" she muttered, holding her head. Daphne shook her head to reduce her dizziness. She could make a figure of a brown haired woman on a bed, held up by shackles around her wrists. She looked wounded, far more than Daphne. The door suddenly creaked opened. Daphne dragged herself to go and hide somewhere. \"I know where you took the boy,\" a familiar voice said. Daphne peeped from her hiding spot. She could see Deathstroke, holding out a tab for the woman to look at. \"He fights like an assassin, like you. Your romance with the Dark Knight wasn't merely rumored. Who is he? Who is Batman?\" the man demanded. \"Do what you must, I won't talk,\" the woman glared at Deathstroke. \"I believe you,\" the man turned his back to her. \"Besides, you won't need to look for them. They'll find you first,\" the woman said. \"Works for me,\" Deathstroke muttered, \"I have my own plan up my sleeves.\" He glanced up towards Daphne's hiding spot, giving her the chill. When he closed the door behind him, Daphne pulled all of her strength together and rushed to the woman's side. She looked at both of the shackles holding her and fished for something inside her pocket. She tried fidgeting it with a hairpin but failed. \"Child, are you alright?\" the woman asked. \"I guess… You're more wounded than me. I must help you!\" Daphne replied, gazing into the woman's eyes. The woman shook her head, saying, \"No need. They will come for me.\" There was a pause before she continued, \"You look exactly like her, orange hair, brown eyes, but, you're smaller…\" Daphne looked away for mere seconds. \"Are you…really…Damian's mother?\" \"Yes… My name is Talia. How do you know my son?\" she asked. \"I was assigned to be his maid, by Batman… I'm Daphne,\" Daphne replied, smiling ever so sweetly. Talia nodded to her. \"You really look like Deathstroke's child. I don't know if they are related, but she always hesitates to hurt me.\" \"She…?\" Daphne muttered. Suddenly, the memories of what happened before she was brought into the very room flashed in front of her. Daphne stepped into her bedroom. \"Hello, sister,\" she was surprised by the voice. \" D-Delphinium?\" Daphne stared at the girl on her bed. \" Lucky you, taken in by Batman,\" Delphinium said, jumping off the bed and standing up on her two feet. \" How did you know I was here?\" she asked. Delphinium smiled and replied, \"It wasn't easy, but it was to be expected that Batman would arrive at our home by the time he heard of our parents' death. I've known Batman's identity since I was eight…\" \" Why are you here now? Where were you? You left me all alone…\" Daphne muttered, her voice shaky. \" I have my own agenda. I'm gonna need you to cooperate,\" Delphinium said, charging in at her sister. Daphne jumped out of the way. Delphinium smirked, impressed at her sister's reaction time. She turned to look at the younger girl. \" You've been training?\" she asked, charging in with a kick. Daphne blocked it with her arm, gasping. \"I had to…in order to find you…and Deathstroke…\" Delphinium punched the girl in the face. Daphne held the punch with her hand. Her sister was strong, far stronger than Daphne thought the girl could ever be. \" I know one thing you won't do,\" her sister said. \" What?\" Daphne demanded. \" Killing me,\" Delphinium said, disappearing from Daphne's sight. Daphne didn't react on time. Her sister was right behind her. With one chop on the neck, she blacked out. Batman, Robin, and Nightwing stood in front of Langstrom who was brought to the Batcave. He told them everything about what Ra's wanted, the fact that he would provide volunteers for Langstrom to work on which was to Langstrom's delight. \"He wanted you to make the ultimate warrior…\" Nightwing muttered. \"Yes. Ra's called it Operation Air Strike. No military could withstand an army of flying super-powered ninjas,\" Langstrom continued. \"But, Deathstroke took over,\" Nightwing interrupted. He told them that he only spoke to his family once. Batman asked him to make the antidote while he and Robin went to rescue his family. \"Where's Phoenix?\" Batman asked Nightwing. \"Haven't seen her. I supposed it's her bedtime by now…\" the young man shrugged. Batman pondered for a while. He wouldn't want to bother her bedtime. He and Robin boarded the Batwing and took off to Interlaken, where Robin was sure Langstrom's family was held as hostages. Batman glanced up at his son. \"I hope you're right about this.\" Damian looked out through the window, saying, \"I know these mountains well. I've been climbing them since I was four. It was a part of my training\" \"That's some training for a four-year-old,\" the father muttered. \"The first time I climbed, I fell, broke a wrist, but I made it to the top anyway. It was to be expected. I was Ra's al Ghul's grandson…\" Robin said. Batman was a bit surprised, so he asked, \"Was it all like that, Damian?\" \"I was being groomed to lead humanity, by my grandfather. We were going to create a whole new world,\" he explained. \"By killing?\" Batman asked. \"If that's what it took…\" Robin replied short. \"How do you hope to lead humanity when you've never been a part of it?\" Batman talked some senses into him. Robin didn't say anything. He changed the topic, \"What about you? From what I've heard, your childhood wasn't a lot of fun either.\" \"I had my traumas, but I also had people around me to help: Alfred, Dick, others…and then, Daphne. I've had friends. As far as I can tell, all you had are trainers. There's a difference, Damian,\" Batman explained to him. \"What about her? My servant?\" the boy suddenly asked. \"She came a month before you came. She is a great gymnast and she was willing to help me. Her parents were killed…by Deathstroke,\" he sighed. \"And she never felt vengeful?\" Robin asked. \"All she did was cry, but she was traumatized. Remember the time you accidentally cut her arm?\" \"Yeah, she was chanting some words.\" \"Her parents were killed with a sword, almost similar to the one you used. She has been scared of it ever since.\" \"That girl we saw at the coliseum… She looks just like my servant…\" Robin muttered. \"Yeah. I bet Phoenix knew something, but it's hard to make her talk. We have to wait until she's ready,\" Batman replied, understanding Daphne's feelings more than ever. Robin didn't say anything after that. He really wanted to ask Daphne, but still hadn't got the chance to. He caught a glimpse of the peaks that looked like cat ears. Forming a small smile, he said, \"There's the stronghold, beyond those peaks.\" Once they landed, they began their search for Langstrom's family and clues of Deathstroke's whereabouts. \"If Phoenix were here, it might have been easier...\" Batman mumbled to himself. As the two were searching for clues and the missing family members, Daphne and Talia were being dragged to a new whole place. Daphne wasn't sure if she was going to like the new prison. It was above the sea and boy does she hate the sea. Daphne helped Talia up her feet as they got down from the airplane they boarded. \"Well, we're gonna have to separate you,\" Delphinium said to the two prisoners. \"Don't hurt her! Please, sister!\" Daphne screamed as she watched Deathstroke scooped Talia up. \"Don't call me that!\" Delphinium shouted, hitting Daphne's back. \"Daphne! Do not hurt her, you!\" Talia gasped. Delphinium pulled Daphne to follow her. Talia took one last look at the girl before she was pulled by Deathstroke to follow him. Daphne was taken to an underground cave. She was pushed into a small opening Delphinium had created for the two of them to hide until Damian would show up. They knew Damian would be coming. Daphne saw the Lazarus Pit not far from her. Delphinium stabbed her sister's right leg. She screamed in pain and broke into tears again. \"W-Why…?\" she asked her sister. \"Because you would try to help him when he comes. Deathstroke is planning to kill Damian and Talia to take over the League of Assassin. I'm going to help,\" Delphinium said with a smirk. \"Why?\" she asked again. \"I have my reasons. You don't need to know, you're going to die either way,\" the older girl replied. Daphne looked away, gasping as she was in pain. \"I'm of no importance to Master Damian. I won't serve as a benefit to the two of you,\" she sobbed. \"Oh…you will,\" Delphinium replied, standing up from her squatting position, \"You see…Batman cares for you so much. I'm sure he will hesitate to stop us when he knows his precious Phoenix has been captured. Not so invincible anymore, are you?\" Daphne's vision was getting blurry because of all the blood loss. She still had a lot of questions in her mind. Delphinium stabbed her other leg. She screamed again, before falling unconscious. Confirming that the girl had fainted, Delphinium contacted Deathstroke. \"The bait will soon be here,\" she muttered, \"I want my end of the deal.\"[Chapter 6] And here comes the end of the first movie. Yay! I love this chapter so much. I love you guys too, alright? Enjoy! :D Chapter 6: \"Wake up!\" Daphne gasped when a kick landed right in her stomach. She opened her eyes and sat up immediately. It was Deathstroke, with Talia in his grasp. The girl widened her eyes at her state. \"Please, let her go…\" Daphne begged. \"Why would I? Besides, I'm expecting a guest. I would want you to come with me but seeing your legs, I changed my mind.\" Daphne bit her lower lip, looking away. Suddenly, they both heard footsteps. They were faint but were still clear enough to be heard by the two. Deathstroke left Daphne there as he walked into the open, standing close to the Lazarus pit. He said, \"I wouldn't make any threatening moves. They'll stay put as long as I tell them to.\" He took one step closer. \"Urgh…my legs still hurt…\" Daphne muttered, feeling the sting due to the stabs she had gotten. \"The Lazarus Pit,\" she widened her eyes when she heard Damian's voice. \"That's right, boy. The only thing this rig pumps is life, everlasting…to the highest bidder,\" Deathstroke replied. \"Master Damian…? Delphinium was right. He would come for his mother,\" Daphne sighed. \"Your mother could use a dip,\" the man said, pulling off the hood from Talia. \"Let her go, monster!\" Damian shouted, taking out a gun, \"Now!\" Daphne dragged herself closer to listen to the conversation. Her eyes widened when she heard a clicking sound of Deathstroke's gun. Deathstroke said, \"Now this is what they call a standoff. Not even the pit can bring back mommy if her head's blown off. Your play, Damian.\" Damian lowered his head. He threw away his gun. \"I should congratulate you for getting this far, but that would be like applauding suicide. You are such an arrogant little brat…so entitled, so bloodthirsty, so easy to manipulate. I brought you here for one simple reason: to kill you. Goodbye, boy.\" He fired his first shot but Talia blocked it. \"Run, Damian!\" she shouted, before falling unconscious. Damian inhaled and froze for mere seconds. He started running away, dodging the gunshots. He hid behind a large rock. Deathstroke kept on shooting it. The man-bats screeched. Daphne covered her ears. She saw that Talia was still breathing, but it was very faint. Damian stood up, facing Deathstroke. \"We are done,\" the man said. Daphne summoned all of her strength to run into the scene. She was able to jump in between them before Deathstroke could shoot Damian. \"Master Damian, look out!\" she shouted, startling both of them. She charged at Deathstroke, trying to grab his gun. He did little effort to push her away because she was still weak. She gasped as her back hit the hard ground. He aimed the gun towards her. \"You little!\" he shouted angrily before shooting her two times in the stomach. \"I was going to use her if Batman ever comes to help you… What a worthless girl…\" Damian was stunned. Daphne controlled her breathing, holding onto her stomach. Slade Wilson aimed the gun back at Damian. Batman did enter the scene. He threw his batarang at the assassin's hand. The gun fell. Damian turned to his father. Turning back to Deathstroke, he smirked. Deathstroke ordered his man-bats to kill the two. Batman threw some devices onto the rocks which created a screeching sound. The man-bats couldn't stand the sound, so they flew off into the elevator out of the oil rig. One of them hit Damian, causing him to zone out for a few minutes while his father was busy engaging in a fist fight with Deathstroke. Batman gave out the final blow. Batman rushed to Talia, scooping her into his arms. \"Mother!\" Damian ran to his parents. \"I've got her…\" Batman muttered. Damian turned to look at the girl. She was sitting up. She managed to get herself close to a rock to lean on. She forced a smile to him. He went up to her. He held her in his arms, gazing at her pale face. He noticed the bloodstain on her socks. She was tortured beforehand. Then he remembered the other girl that looked almost exactly as her. \"You did that for me?\" he asked her. \"You're my…\" she breathed, \"…responsibility after all…\" Deathstroke got up and made an attempt to flee. Damian fueled with a new type of rage, grabbed the sword on the ground and rushed towards where the killer headed. \"Damian!\" Batman called. \"I'll end him! I swear!\" the boy shouted back. Batman stared at the limped body in his arms. Delphinium made an entrance. She stared at Batman. Her eyes were empty. Batman recognized her. \"You could save her…and Daphne…\" she muttered, turning to look at the Lazarus Pit. \"I know…\" Batman replied. He stepped into the pit and laid Talia, floating in the pit. He waited for a few minutes. Suddenly, Talia stood up, almost in rage, gasped and fell unconscious again. Batman grabbed her, hugging her. He pulled her out of the pit, still holding her in his arms. Delphinium went up to her sister. \"It's a wonder you can still breathe…\" she said. \"Kill me now if you want…\" Daphne said, gasping. Delphinium placed her right palm on Daphne's cheek. She was tearing up to see her sister in such a state. Daphne stared into her sister's empty eyes. She wished she could help Delphinium and be a better sister to her. \"This is not what I had in mind… I'm sorry…\" Delphinium said, stood up and walked away. She cringed in pain again. Talia had woken up and the two adults were sharing some intimate moment together. Suddenly, the ground started to shake. \"Beloved?\" Talia muttered. \"The whole place is collapsing,\" Batman said, rushing to Daphne. He picked her up and she smiled. \"I guess I have to depend on Alfred to treat me…\" she sighed. \"Sorry, there's no time,\" Batman replied. They rushed to the exit. Water started to gush out, into the underground cave. Batman, with Daphne in his arms, and Talia ran to the where the escape pod was. On their way, they saw Damian and a defeated Deathstroke. Daphne only stared at the boy. She was too tired to speak. Damian hugged his mother, after deciding not to kill Deathstroke, claiming that he is Batman's 'son'. \"You're ok?\" Damian asked Daphne. She smiled and nodded. Talia glanced up at the girl before looking back at her son. She smiled, somewhat satisfied. \"Thanks for pulling us away on time, Nightwing,\" Batman said. They were already at the shore. Damian was staring into spaces, feeling the cool breeze running through him. Batman handed Daphne to Nightwing. \"Make sure she's treated…\" he said, \"I have a few things to discuss with Damian's mother. \"Alright,\" Nightwing said, taking the girl who cringed again before falling back to sleep. He took off back to the Batcave. When he got there, Alfred was already waiting for them. He got off with Daphne in his arms, still sound asleep. \"Let's take her to her room and you can start treating her. She got shot and stab… How did you not realize someone broke into the manor that night?\" Nightwing blurted. \"She is exactly like Daphne, sneaky, I would say…\" Alfred muttered calmly. They settled her in her room. Alfred started to clean her legs before putting some ointment on the scars and wrapping them up. He turned to Nightwing and discussed how to remove the bullets out of her stomach. Alfred waited for the Batmobile to enter the cave. Once it was parked, the man and his son came out. \"Welcome back, Sir, Master Damian,\" Alfred greeted them. \"Alfred, where is she?\" Damian asked, not wasting any time. \"In her room,\" Alfred replied and Damian rushed out of their sight. \"He was so anxious in the car…\" Batman muttered, taking off his mask. Alfred sighed. \"I suppose I should treat his right arm. It looked broken,\" he remarked. \"It is, but I'm sure it'll heal in no time. Let him be for now. He needs his time,\" Batman replied, smiling. Back with Damian, he was standing in front of the door to Daphne's room. His mask was off and he was holding it in his hand. He turned the knob, stepping into the room. Across the room was Daphne, sitting up in bed. She smiled at him ever so sweetly. Delphinium was walking back to her old home, satisfied with Deathstroke's death. She went inside with her head held high. The guards knew her because she would always check up on them twice a week. \"Miss Aldrin, welcome home!\" one of the two maids she hired greeted her. She smiled and nodded. \"Hello, Mana. It's good to be back. Has anyone called?\" \"Yes, a person claiming to be an investor and a friend of your father's called two days ago,\" the other maid replied. \"Did you get his name, Tiara?\" the child asked. \"Yes, I did and his phone number too,\" Tiara replied calmly. Nodding, Delphinium muttered, \"Good. Let's begin our next strategy.\"[Chapter 7] Hello, world! I decided to add a time interval before going into the second movie to develop their relationship...and to develop Delphinium, too. She has a role in this fanfiction too. Enjoy as always. Tell me what you think, 'kay? Chapter 7: Daphne was cutting some tuna sandwiches she had made. Alfred was with her at the time, making sure she didn't strain herself too much. Besides, she hadn't fully recovered from the events last four days. Daphne insisted that Alfred, Bruce, and Dick were too worried about her. \"I'm fine, Alfred,\" she sighed, placing the sandwiches onto a plate. She got everything ready on a tray and was about to head to Damian's room when she bumped into him. She looked up at him, giving out a smile. His brows were furrowed as usual. He took the tray from her, walking up to the counter where Alfred was. He sat down and turned to the girl, saying, \"From now onwards, I'll be having my meal here. You don't need to go all the way to my room.\" \"It's my first day after not doing anything…\" Daphne muttered. \"You haven't fully recovered yet. I don't want him to worry about you,\" Damian explained. Daphne knew he meant Dick and not Bruce. Damian had become a rival of the sort to Nightwing. They had been glaring at each other ever since Deathstroke's death. Daphne couldn't really find the reason of those glares. \"Okay…\" Daphne replied, saying. She excused herself after that to go back to her room. Once she was there, she stared at her reflection in the mirror. A scar on her right cheek was clearly seen. It was a scar she got out of protecting Talia from getting stabbed by her sister. \"Delphinium… Are you still alive? If so, where are you?\" she sighed, touching the long scar which starts from her temple all the way down to her chin. \"That scar won't go away by just looking at it,\" Dick startled her. \"Master Dick! How long have you been standing at my door?\" she asked. \"Half a minute maybe?\" Dick replied, walking up to her, \"Here. I bought this ointment for you. It can help with the scar…\" Daphne took the small bottle he gave her. She read the label. Suddenly, she widened her eyes. Dick wondered why. She muttered, \"There's my family name on this…\" \"What?\" Dick asked, making sure he didn't hear her wrong. Delphinium put on a black blouse and a matching black skirt. Then, she put on a denim jacket. She combed her hair, tied it up and smiled at herself. She nodded a few times before walking to the kitchen. \"Good morning, Miss Aldrin!\" Tiara greeted her. \"Good morning, Tiara. I have to head down to the office again today. Seriously, that man I hired to take over before me is so not good at this,\" Delphinium sighed. \"Well, just eat your breakfast first,\" Mana said, serving her a bowl of her favorite cereal. Delphinium smiled. She started to eat, thinking about her family's business. As much as she was satisfied with what they already had, she decided to expand the business. Being with Deathstroke made her realize her real potential. Her family owns one of the largest medical companies around the globe. She decided to make it better than ever, adding a little diversity. When she was done, she headed straight to the office. \"Ah, Miss Delphinium! So good of you to come!\" the man she hired, which goes by the name Arnold, said. \"Arnold…you're messing around again?\" she asked him. \"N-No! There's someone here that wants to meet the real boss of this company…,\" there was a pause before he continued, \"…personally…\" \"Who's that person? How did he know who I am?\" Delphinium asked. She heard footsteps. It was uncanny because these footsteps can only be made if the person is wearing a pair high heels. Delphinium turned around to find a blonde woman in a black suit. She smiled sweetly at the girl. \"Hello, my name is Samantha Vanaver,\" she introduced herself. \"Oh…I heard of you,\" Delphinium blinked, asking, \"So, What brings you here?\" \"I have a proposal for you…\" Samantha said, her smile turning into a smirk. Delphinium was getting more interested in the offer as minutes went by. Samantha explained why she was here. She would like to form a partnership with the Aldrin. As much as Delphinium liked the idea, she knew what she had to do first. She told the woman that she wanted to reschedule their meeting after that brief explanation. \"I have a sister which deserves to know this as much as I do. So, I need to inform her first,\" she lied. \"Oh, I see. I would like to meet her too then. Well, until the next time,\" Samantha said, smiling again. Delphinium nodded. Once the woman was out of her sight, Arnold came back from his coffee break. He was told by Delphinium to go and have one. She told him to take his post back. She headed back home. It was time for her old self to make an appearance. She had decided to crack some information on Samantha, information that even the internet doesn't know. Daphne watched Damian training with Bruce, in the Batcave, as Robin and Batman. They were fighting barehanded. Even with one arm broken, Damian was winning…or maybe, Bruce was letting him win? Daphne was in no shape to train. After those stabs and gunshots, she was told to not strain her body too much. They had to make sure she fully recovered before she could do anything. She sighed. \"That's all for today,\" Bruce said, after getting one last kick from Damian. \"I haven't had enough yet,\" Damian complained. \"I think you did pretty well,\" Bruce said, smiling. He turned to Daphne. She smiled at him, walking up to them. \"Can I go to school tomorrow?\" she asked. \"If you want…but Alfred would have to drive you,\" Bruce replied. Daphne nodded, looking down and playing with her hair. Bruce knew what those acts meant. It was her way of saying that she had more to say. He waited for one minute before asking her. \"Well… It's almost the end of this schoolyear and my school's going to have a Father & Daughter Dance. Since I don't have a father anymore, I thought you'd go with me,\" she explained, staring into his eyes, \"Will you?\" \"When is this dance?\" Bruce asked. \"What will the boys be doing?\" Daphne explained, \"Oh, they'll be running the event. We'll be returning the favor during the Mother & Son Dance. I don't even know why the school would do this…but, it's this coming Saturday…\" \"Hmm… I may not make it. I need to patrol the city that night,\" Bruce muttered. \"Maybe Dick can take my place. Is that acceptable?\" \"So, you'd let me go if Master Dick agrees?\" Daphne asked. Bruce nodded. Damian suddenly blurted, \"Why Grayson? Why can't it be Pennyworth?\" Bruce and Daphne stared. Daphne giggled. As much as she knew Alfred was in shape to dance, she didn't want to trouble him. To top that, he rarely gets out of the manor. Even to do the groceries, Daphne would volunteer to do every two weeks after school. Bruce shook his head. Daphne excused herself to go and call Dick to tell him the news. \"What's the matter?\" Bruce asked, noticing that Damian was scowling. \"Nothing. I just don't like the idea of letting my servant go off with Grayson,\" Damian muttered, exhaling angrily. Bruce smiled at his son. He rubbed his head, ruining his hair and earning a groan from Damian. They both went up to the manor after that. The next day, Daphne was all ready to go to school. When she got to the car, Damian was leaning on it with his arms crossed. It seemed his arm had healed. She stared, confused. \"I want to see this so called school,\" he said. \"Sure. I don't have anything against that, but you know that Master Bruce forbids you from going out,\" she replied. \"I'll just stay in the car then,\" Damian replied, opening the door of the car. Shrugging, Daphne got into the car after he did. Alfred was smiling happily at the two children. Daphne was uneasy as to why he wanted to come with her, but she tried to ignore it. \"Miss Daphne, would you like to go shopping after school? I am sure you would need a dress for the occasion tomorrow,\" Alfred spoke. \"Yeah, sure. Will Master Bruce come with us?\" she asked. \"I'm sure he will. Master Dick will be tagging along,\" Alfred replied. \"I'm the only one who can't go out!\" Damian complained. Daphne smiled guiltily while Alfred muffled a laugh. For once, Damian was acting like a real child. They soon arrived. Daphne said goodbye and then, headed straight to her classroom, ignoring the stares she was getting. Damian wondered why. Afternoon came at last and the school had ended. Bruce's car was already waiting for her. She got in with a smile, excited for the dance tomorrow. Dick was in the seat next to Bruce's. He smiled at the girl. Bruce told her that Alfred had to babysit Damian and she nodded. He drove them to Daphne's favorite shopping complex. Well, they had only been there once or twice because Bruce couldn't supply Daphne with appropriate clothing for a girl. \"So, what kind of a dress are we looking for?\" Dick asked. \"I want a strapless dress,\" Daphne said. \"It's too revealing for a girl like you. No,\" Bruce replied sternly. Daphne puffed her cheeks. \"What if I wear a denim jacket outside?\" she negotiated. \"Okay, but the dress must be covering all of your thighs,\" the man replied. Dick chuckled. \"Okay then… Let's go to that boutique,\" he pointed randomly at one of the three boutiques he had caught sight of. They ended up spending four hours searching for a dress for Daphne. Bruce kept on refusing to buy the ones the other two had chosen because they were revealing, the fabric's too thin, the color's too bright and many more excuses. In the end, Daphne chose a dress with a color quite similar to the wings decoration on her Phoenix uniform. Bruce approved. She told him she already had a denim jacket to wear, and Dick was free for the day. Only Bruce and Daphne returned to the manor. \"Welcome back, Master Bruce, Miss Daphne,\" Alfred greeted them. \"Where's Damian?\" Bruce asked. \"In his room…\" Alfred replied, rolling his eyes once. Daphne rushed to her room to try on the dress again. She was too excited for the dance. The dress was really simple. It was a mix of red and orange in color with white butterflies coming from the hem up to the chest part of the dress. \"That's too revealing,\" Damian said, startling the girl. She turned to him who was leaning against the door of her room. She looked blankly at him. \"Master Dick likes it. Besides, I'm going to wear a denim jacket outside. Your father approved,\" she replied, turning her back to him. She was back to looking at her reflection. She smiled happily. \"Why do you adore him so much?\" Damian suddenly asked. \"Because he's kind to me…\" Daphne answered bluntly. Damian made his way to the kitchen, ignoring her statement. Daphne smiled, satisfied that he left her alone. She wondered why he was concerned but she actually didn't care at all. She hummed a tune as she changed into her maid uniform before going downstairs to prepare dinner. In the middle of the night, Delphinium, back in her old uniform, the one she wore when she was working under Deathstroke, was spying on a group of people which had a connection to Vanaver. \"What are they up to? Why are they meeting in secret here?\" she mumbled to herself and kept on watching. Soon, Vanaver made an appearance. They opened up a secret door and entered the place. Delphinium sneaked in before it was closed. She saw them putting on masks of sorts. She tried to listen to what they were discussing. She was aware that there were surveillance cameras around and she was careful. Her pursuit came to a stop when more cameras were spotted. She couldn't go any further, so she made her escape. It was a good thing she decided to wear a hoodie that night to cover her hair. \"White bird-like mask… Hmm…I should look into this more. I'll ask Tiara and Mana to help me,\" Delphinium muttered, climbing up a building so that no one could trace her easily. As she jumped from one roof to another, she thought of her sister. What would she do if she ever had to see her again? She knew she would be the one who has to make the decision because Daphne would think that she had died in the crash. \"I should explain to her soon...\" she muttered.[Chapter 8] Chapter 8: Daphne got down the stairs. Dick was waiting for her. It was time for the dance. She was wearing the dress Bruce had bought for her with her denim jacket. Her hair was in curls, going down to her elbow. She smiled at her 'date'. Dick flashed a smile back, amazed at what a beauty she was. \"Where's Master Bruce and Master Damian?\" she asked. \"They're on patrol tonight. Bruce is after all training Damian,\" Dick replied. \"Oh… If only Phoenix could help,\" Daphne sighed. \"Well, you're still in no shape to do any of that work, so please don't. I don't want Master Bruce to be throwing a fit because of you,\" Alfred remarked. Dick agreed. Daphne nodded. They set off to Daphne's school with Dick's motorbike. She prayed that no one would take notice of her at the dance. She just wanted to enjoy her one night away from being Damian's maid. When they entered the hall where the dance was held, all eyes were on her. Daphne gulped because she knew what was coming. \"Who is he?\" she heard someone whispered. \"How did she get hold of someone?\" another whisper came. \"M-Master Dick, maybe we should just go home…\" Daphne muttered. \"Hmm? No. Since we're already here, let's have fun. Forget about them. They're not the ones who decide your life. Ignore them,\" Dick replied, pulling Daphne to the dancefloor, \"Let's dance.\" He extended his right hand to her, after bowing. It was a slow dance. Most of the girls were dancing with their fathers and some were with their older brothers. Daphne was pulled to dance with Dick. She opened her mouth and said, \"Thanks for coming with me…\" \"Anything for my little sister,\" Dick joked. \"Don't call me that,\" she smiled. Dick was relieved that she could form a smile. She had been depressed ever since they got back from the oil rig. There was no trace of Delphinium and she was devastated. As evil as Delphinium was, she is still Daphne's flesh and blood. Daphne loves her no matter what. After the slow dance, they had some people coming up the stage to perform a play. Dick had to make a trip to the toilet, so Daphne was left alone. The girl decided to get some air outside because some of her classmates were glancing up at her. She exited the hall. \"Hey,\" a familiar voice said. \"Hmmm?\" she looked up to see Damian in front of her. He was wearing a tuxedo…and a mask to hide his identity. Of course, Daphne knew who he was. She went up to him. \"What are you doing here, Master Damian?\" she asked him, muffling a giggle with her right hand. Damian was frowning. \"Pennyworth told me where you were. I thought I should observe this so-called dance. Where is Grayson?\" \"I'm right here. Just had to make a short trip to the toilet. Why are you here, kid?\" Dick said, standing beside Daphne. Daphne stared at the young man. Then, she turned to Damian. She could feel his glares under the mask. \"Just observing…\" Damian replied. A girl came out and caught sight of Damian. Since he was wearing his Robin mask, the girl screamed in excitement. \"Oh my God! It's Robin in a tuxedo!\" she screamed, grabbing some attention from inside the hall. The girl rushed to pull him into the hall. Some girls were at the entrance, getting all excited over Robin. Daphne muffled her giggles as she looked at Robin's surprised and awkward expression. Dick smirked at the boy. He turned to Daphne. \"One more for the road and then, we can head home,\" he said. She nodded. \"Alright!\" They both entered the hall again. The girls were pulling on Robin to dance with them. Daphne and Dick laughed at the sight. Robin didn't know what to do. Amidst the dance with Daphne, Dick's phone vibrated so suddenly. It was a call from Alfred, informing him that Batman was fuming up because Robin went missing. Scratching his head, the guy sighed. \"Well, that's my cue to leave and assist him,\" he said to the girl. Daphne shrugged. \"Sure, why not. I'll get Master Damian. We'll walk home together. You can go ahead,\" she replied calmly. Dick nodded. He patted the girl's head before leaving. Robin noticed she was left alone. The boy just stared at her as another girl pulled him to dance with her. Daphne sat down on a chair after getting something to drink and eat. She ignored the crowd and the excitement in front of her. As she was drinking her juice, Robin came up to her. She stared. He extended his right hand to her. \"One last dance…and then we go home…\" he whispered, avoiding eye contact with her. She tilted her head, confused. Robin slapped his forehead. He was embarrassed. He inched his face closer to her. He whispered, \"I want to dance with you, Daphne.\" Daphne faintly blushed. She felt like she could see right through his eyes. She stuttered her answer, \"O-Okay…\" He grabbed her left hand, pulling her to the dancefloor. She blushed when he held her waist. He pulled her closer to him. They started to dance. Nobody said anything and even if they do, Daphne paid no attention to them. She felt safe and warm, even though she knew that this boy in front of her is her young master, not more than that. Delphinium lied in bed, sighing. She was still wondering about Vanaver's proposal. She was tempted, but she was also worried about the consequences. The offer seemed to have something to do with eliminating some people from Gotham City. She didn't like the idea at all because Phoenix may be one of the people Vanaver would want dead, and Phoenix is her sister. \"Miss Aldrin,\" Tiara said from outside her room, after knocking, \"I'm heading out now. Anything you want in particular?\" \"Yeah…get my uniform ready. I need to go see Phoenix tonight…\" Delphinium said without a second thought. \"Mana has already done that. She'll be tending to your needs for the time being. I'll be back tomorrow afternoon,\" Tiara replied. Delphinium walked up to her door and opened it. She nodded to her maid. Tiara nodded once before heading to her room. The girl walked to her changing room. She changed into her uniform. She didn't want to make a scene at her old school after all. It was better for her to hide her identity. Once she was ready, she took off to her school. \"I wonder how she's doing…\" she muttered to herself. She got there just as the dance had ended. She hid on top of a tree close to the hall where the dance was held. She observed the entrance, waiting for a certain redhead. Meanwhile, Robin was waiting for Daphne who was apologizing to the headmaster about the commotion that he had caused. The headmaster was the only one who could understand her relation to Robin. She didn't mention anything important. Once that was done, Daphne rushed to Robin. He was crossing his arms. She sighed at his behavior. It was all his fault that she had to apologize. \"That was problematic…\" he muttered. \"I guess…\" she replied, not wanting to explain any further. They exited the building. Most of the children had already left. Robin jumped onto a tree, close to the one Delphinium was hiding on. Daphne stared before she slowly climbed the tree too. \"Still haven't fully recovered?\" he asked. Daphne smiled, holding her stomach. \"Yes. I'm sorry…\" she replied. Damian stared. \"Why apologize? It's not your fault.\" He jumped onto another tree in front of them. Daphne bit her lower lip before jumping and landing beside him. She cringed a bit. Robin jumped onto the next tree. Daphne rubbed her stomach. She attempted to jump again but slipped. Damian didn't react on time. She fell onto the hard ground. \"Daphne!\" he called out, jumping to her side. Delphinium gasped. She jumped down, close to where the two kids were. Damian held the girl in his arm. She was unconscious. His stomach felt uneasy, imagining how enraged his father would be when he finds out about this. He sensed someone was spying on them. His head snapped towards Delphinium in the shadows. He shouted, \"Who's there?!\" \"It's me…\" Delphinium said, stepping forward. Robin held Daphne closer to him. \"What do you want?\" he asked the girl in front of him. \"Robin…no… Damian. I need to speak with my sister, but since she...\" the girl turned to her sister. \"What is it?\" Robin demanded, cutting her off. \"I want to apologize for what I did. I have a reason for that, but you don't need to know. I will see her some other time,\" Delphinium continued. She stepped closer. Damian hissed, \"Don't come any closer!\" The girl smiled. \"I won't. Damian, one of these days, she may get into trouble again. I hope you will protect her. I know Phoenix is strong, but Daphne isn't,\" she said, before backing away into the darkness. Damian stared into the darkness before gazing at the girl in his arms. \"Why do you have to take the tree when there is a normal road?!\" Daphne woke up from the shout. She observed her surroundings. She was in the Batcave. She saw Robin, scolded by Batman. Nightwing was beside the man, looking as if he was holding his anger. Daphne got up from the chair she was put in. She felt a little woozy and cringed at a sting from her stomach. She walked up to the three. \"Daphne, you're awake!\" Nightwing said, noticing her first. She smiled. \"What happened? The last thing I remembered was falling from a tree…\" \"It was this kid's fault, right?\" the young man asked. Daphne shook her head and explained, \"I chose to do it. I could just ask him to walk with me, but I didn't want to trouble him.\" She pulled at Batman's hand. He turned to her. Her eyes were pleading that he should not punish Damian. Batman's anger caved in. He walked away. Alfred made an appearance after he was called. \"Miss Daphne, would you like anything?\" Alfred asked. \"No, thank you. I need to change and go to sleep…\" she replied, walking towards the exit. Alfred turned to Robin. \"Perhaps you need a little education on being a gentleman…\" he remarked. \"I don't think he needs it,\" Nightwing scoffed. Robin didn't say anything. He just stared at the girl. She was still having a hard time dealing with her dizziness. Daphne made her way to the kitchen, looking around for a certain black-haired boy. It had been a month since the dance and the incident. It was finally Winter Break. The girl was glad that she didn't have to worry about school. Bruce had been trying to be more affectionate towards his son which Damian took it hard to believe. He was not used to such attention. \"Good morning, Miss,\" Alfred greeted he, smiling, \"Off for a little brisk walk?\" \"Morning, Alfred…\" she replied and sighed. Noticing that Daphne was looking around, he said, \"If you're looking for Master Damian, he is with Master Bruce, in the Batcave.\" Daphne munched on a sandwich that Alfred had prepared for her. She turned to him and swallowed. \"What are they up to?\" she asked. Alfred sighed, hoping that Daphne wouldn't want to know. However, he knew that Phoenix is always the curious type. He poured some warm tea into a cup for her. Then, he took a seat opposite of her at the counter. \"They have been receiving a few reports on missing children, but they have no clues about them whatsoever,\" Alfred explained. \"Oh…\" Daphne muttered, staring at her cup of tea. Before she could say anything, Damian made an appearance. She flashed a small smile towards him. He caught sight of the girl and approached her. Daphne bit her lower lip as she saw how serious his expression was. \"Is something wrong?\" she asked, a bit concern in her tone. \"Train with me,\" he suddenly said. \"Excuse me?\" Daphne blinked, confused about his request. \"Father said I should be trying to control my bloodlust and anger,\" he started, blinking once, \"So he suggests that I train with you.\" \"But you're already better than me! I don't think I can teach you anything!\" she blurted, waving her hands up and down. Damian looked into her eyes, freezing her on the spot. She sighed and before she knew it, she was in her Phoenix uniform, facing Robin, inside the cave. She wasn't holding anything, though. Damian explained that all she had to do was parry and defend from his attacks. He was barehanded because he knew how much a sword scares her. \"Ready?\" he asked. \"Y-Yes…\" she sputtered. Damian charged in to punch her. Daphne back flipped, dodging his attack. He swiped her feet but she jumped as he tried. Damian told her to defend with her arms as he kicked her. She did as told. As they were training, Alfred and Nightwing entered the base. The butler had brought lunch for the two children. Dick decided to stay and watch them train. \"It is good that he is trying to bond with her,\" Alfred spoke. \"Yeah,\" Dick said, crossing his arms, \"Just don't hurt her or I'll never forgive him…\"[Chapter 9] Hi, guys. This one is a bit short but it's all about our Delphinium! You can understand teh girl better after reading this, I promise. :) Chapter 9: Delphinium stayed inside her study and opened all of the surveillance cameras she had her two maids to put around the city. She was planning to spy on Batman, Nightwing, Robin, Phoenix and Samantha Vanaver who had caught her eyes recently. She had Tiara researching on the white owl mask she had seen Samantha wore. \"Miss, is there anything you need me to do?\" Mana asked the girl. \"Yes. I need you to cut my hair. I need it to be short so that these people will not recognize me so easily,\" Delphinium said. \"How about some highlights too?\" the maid suggested. \"That'll be good. Make it silver. It's my favorite color,\" the girl replied. She stared at the picture on her desk. It was a picture of a nine-year-old Delphinium and her seven-year-old sister, Daphne. They were happy, celebrating Delphinium's award as being one of the smartest in her grade. In the picture, Daphne didn't look that happy. \"Do you miss her, Miss?\" Mana asked, combing her young mistress' hair. \"A little bit. She's happy tagging along with Robin, I mean, Damian all the time. I don't want to take that away from her,\" Delphinium replied. \"She needs to come back sooner or later for the family's business sake…\" Mana remarked. The girl nodded once and replied, \"Yeah…\" Delphinium watched Robin, from one of the screens. She couldn't see Phoenix in the shadows. She knew that Daphne was held from being Phoenix due to her injuries, injuries that her older sister had caused. \" Sister! Come back!\" a six-year-old Daphne called out to her older sister. Delphinium was up on a tree, with a book in her hand. It was Daphne's favorite storybook. \" You're gonna have to climb up here and get me!\" the sister called back. Daphne puffed her cheeks, angry. She marched towards the tree. Delphinium was smiling happily as she watched her little sister trying her best to climb up the tree. An old man got out through the back door and into their little garden. He approached both of them with a broad smile. \" My, my, you two never change,\" he said, picking Daphne up. \" Delphinium is being mean again, Grandpa Slade!\" the little girl complained. \" I wasn't! I was teaching you how to climb the tree!\" Delphinium insisted. \" Ah, Delphy! You always have your own way of teaching your sister,\" Slade remarked. Delphinium frowned at the nickname Slade had given her. She jumped down onto the soft grass and started to walk towards the house. Daphne jumped off from Slade and followed her sister. Slade shook his head at their behavior. Delphinium dodged her sister every time the girl tried to snatch away the book from her. Then, she would laugh when Daphne made her sulking face. \" Those girls are something, aren't they?\" their father approached Slade. \" They sure are. I would be honored if you'd let me teach them a thing or two about combats,\" Slade offered. Daphne fell down again, trying to dodge Delphinium's punch. She was hating the training. She got up without her sister's help and brushed off the dirt on her clothes. That day, Slade introduced five men for them to train with. The men will act as their opponents. Delphinium was first to have a go. \" Bring it on!\" the nine-year-old said. The men charged at her. Having a small body, she swiftly slipped herself in between their hits, causing them to hit each other. She was great at dodging most of the attacks. She even knocked out three out of five of them, in less than ten minutes. Slade and Mr. Aldrin were impressed. Delphinium jumped away from a kick and landed behind the man. She jumped again and gave a blow on the neck to knock him out too. There was only one left. He admitted defeat before she could charge in. \" Bravo, my dear,\" Slade clapped his hand. Delphinium walked back to where her sister was standing. Daphne looked amazed. \" You were great, sis!\" she exclaimed, hugging Delphinium. \" You have to do better than me,\" she whispered, rubbing Daphne's head. After the training, Slade had given Delphinium a necklace as a reward for her accomplishment. She was proud but she didn't like that Daphne didn't earn any. Daphne, on the other hand, was happy for her sister. Delphinium wondered what the girl was thinking. Twelve-year-old Delphinium sat by the stairs, listening to Slade and her parents. They were discussing her and Daphne. \" I want the girl. She is better off with me,\" Slade insisted. \" But she is our daughter,\" Mrs. Aldrin refused to let her go. \" You have problems with your business, right? I can help. Just give me the girl. I will train her to be the ultimate warrior and protector. In return, I'll give you money,\" Slade negotiated. Mr. Aldrin pondered for a while. \"I don't know, Slade. She is just a girl. We want the best for her.\" \" The best for her is to be with me!\" Slade shouted angrily. Delphinium backed away, her back meeting the wall behind her. She was surprised by Slade's voice. She knew that something was up. She heard her mother crying after that. She peeped again and saw that Slade had left. Delphinium fidgeted her locket. She knew what she had to do in order to save her family. \" I have to go with Slade. Something is really amidst,\" she muttered. She rushed to her room and started creating a mess. She wanted it to be seen like she was kidnapped. After that, she placed her locket on her study desk. She exited through the window and disappeared without a trace. \" Grandpa Slade!\" she called out when she caught sight of him in a car. Slade asked the driver to stop the car. He let the girl in. She faked a happy smile, but no one could tell that. She was good at faking. \" So you decided to come with me?\" he asked her. Nodding, she replied, \"Yes. I hated how my parents kept me inside the mansion. It's annoying.\" \" I see…\" the old man said. \" I want to go on adventures with you!\" Delphinium faked a spoilt voice. \" I know you're more intelligent than that,\" Slade said, getting a sense that she was lying. Delphinium's smile turned into a frown. \"Well, you said you would help with my family's business. I'd take the offer, but my parents are still alive. They are the ones that can decide for the good of the company,\" she explained calmly. Slade was stunned by how intelligent she was. He smirked. \"We can arrange that.\" Delphinium glanced up at Slade, before smirking herself. \"I like the way you think, Grandpa Slade.\" \" And I like your brains, Delphy…\" Delphinium woke up from her dreams. She looked at her digital clock and sighed. It was already 10 in the morning. She fixed her new hair, made her bed and took a bath. Tiara came in after that with her breakfast. \"Anything to report?\" she asked. \"Well, I researched about the owl mask. I think it links to the Court of Owls. It seems like it's not just a legend,\" Tiara explained. \"Hmm…? That's interesting… Fill me in,\" Delphinium said, munching on her cereal. Tiara nodded. She showed Delphinium some pictures of owl masked people around the city. They kept themselves hidden very well because Delphinium hardly saw them from her surveillance cameras. \"Beware of the Court of Owls, that watches all the time, Ruling Gotham from shadowed perch, behind granite and lime. They watch you at your hearth, they watch you in your bed, Speak not a whispered word about them, or they'll send a Talon for your head…\" Tiara chanted. \"Talon? That's worth researching. I'll get Mana to do that. I have a new job for you…\" Delphinium replied. Tiara interrupted. \"I'm not done yet. This Court may be aiming to put a stop to Batman. They may target Miss Daphne too.\" \"Hmm. I see. I need to know more… I think I need to meet up with Samantha…\" the girl muttered. \"Are you sure, Miss? You don't have the details yet…\" Tiara remarked. Delphinium nodded. \"I'll be fine. I need to protect my sister,\" she muttered, getting out of bed. \"Have ever wondered what she's doing right now?\" Tiara asked. The twelve-year-old girl chuckled. \"I do…all the time. I seriously can't live without her…but, it's been more than a month since I escaped from the oil rig…\" \"But, you tried to kill her, didn't you?\" the young maid asked. Smiling, the young mistress replied, \"Nope. I wasn't planning on killing anyone. I had to be the mean one and let Deathstroke have his way. I knew my sister well. She's really good at hiding her presence. Which is why I know she'd hide very well that night, and be the only one to survive.\" \"And Batman?\" Tiara asked, curious. \"I told him about the murder through one of my messengers,\" Delphinium said, turning to look out through the window, \"I know he'd take her in…and now, she's happy enough. I'm really glad.\"[Chapter 10] Chapter 10: \"Good morning…\" Daphne sighed, rubbing her eyes. She had just woken up and had reached the kitchen as Bruce was all ready to head out. She looked around in search for Damian but he was nowhere to be found. Alfred was preparing some breakfast for her, knowing that she would be waking up at the time. \"How are you feeling, Daphne?\" Bruce asked. \"Still a little dizzy. Master Damian really outdid himself yesterday,\" Daphne replied. Bruce nodded. \"I'm sorry for leaving him to you.\" Daphne smiled and shook her head. She replied, \"That's okay…\" Bruce suddenly remembered something. \"I got a call from the school board yesterday. They said your sister quit.\" \"Yeah…she did. The teacher said she had to take over the family business. I'm glad she's alive…\" the girl smiled. Damian made an appearance with a sword in his hand. \"Why would you be glad? She tried to kill you,\" he interrupted. Daphne jumped at his voice. She rushed behind Bruce when she noticed what he was holding in his hand. She was trembling. Bruce shook his head at her reaction. She was still afraid of swords even after all the days she spent with Damian. Damian sheathed the sword, acting as if he didn't notice how scared she was. He took the sandwich that was prepared for her before walking away. Alfred rolled his eyes at the boy's behavior. Bruce patted her head once and headed out after that. \"What will you be doing today, Miss?\" Alfred asked, preparing another tuna sandwich for her. She took a seat close to where Alfred was and replied, \"I'll do my revision today. School is in a month's time and I still have a lot to cover.\" \"That is a good idea,\" Alfred agreed. He handed her the new sandwich. She munched on it slowly, smiling happily. Alfred patted her head before exiting the kitchen. Daphne's smile turned upside down immediately. She was thinking of going out to find her sister. She wanted to know her whereabouts. She made her way to her room to change her clothes, but she bumped into Damian before she could reach it. \"I'm sorry!\" she apologized. \"Going somewhere?\" Damian asked her. Daphne stared into his eyes. The boy raised a brow. She looked away immediately. \"Umm…I'm heading out. I w-want to find Delphinium…\" the girl drawled. \"Why? Your sister wants nothing to do with you,\" Damian replied coldly. \"How did you know that?\" Daphne asked. \"She would have tried to contact you if she wanted to, but she didn't,\" the boy replied. The girl looked down sadly. She entered her room and closed the door. Damian stared at the door for mere seconds, confused. Then, he took the path towards the library. Meanwhile, Daphne lied in bed, thinking hard of what Damian had said. Was it true? Delphinium tied her hair into a bun. She was in her office, scheming some new clients while waiting for Samantha Vanaver. The blonde had made an appointment with the girl to discuss their future partnership. \"Miss Aldrin, your guest is here,\" Arnold announced. \"Good, bring her in. I'm ready to see her,\" Delphinium replied, standing up from her chair. Samantha came in after Arnold exited the office. Delphinium smiled to her and she smiled back. \"I thought I could meet your sister today,\" Samantha said. \"I have decided to not get her involve. She's happy with her life, living as Mr. Wayne's maid,\" Delphinium replied calmly. \"Oh? She's with Bruce?\" the blonde asked in disbelief. The girl nodded. \"Well, I'd like to offer you something…\" she smirked. \"Hmm? I like the way you think, little girl,\" Samantha remarked. \"Let's just say I'm always underestimated by people. They don't know my true potential…\" Delphinium replied confidently. Samantha sat with her on the sofa. The girl revealed that she knew about Samantha's secret and would like to keep it a secret. She had her condition, which was she wanted to join in the research department. Samantha agreed, considering that Aldrin is one of the wealthiest companies around the globe. \"I'm glad you'd take my offer. We'd need lots of your intelligence for our research,\" Samantha said. \"I know. I looked it up, no offense,\" the girl replied. \"None was taken, because you're one of us…and for a thirteen-year-old, you are one of our greatest assets now,\" the blonde smirked. Delphinium nodded. Samantha explained to her what she had to do. The girl listened attentively. Daphne watched Robin and Batman training together again. Batman was giving him some tips and insights about how to tackle the enemy, while Robin kept on repeating that he already knew. She just watched those two tongue-fighting and fist-fighting at the same time. It was an entertainment to her. \"That's enough for today. You never listen to me,\" Batman said, exhaling heavily. Robin wiped his sweats and replied, \"I told you I already know that!\" \"You still think that vengeance is better than justice!\" Batman said sternly. \"I do not!\" Robin shouted. \"Prove it!\" Batman stared at the boy, piercing his gaze on him, \"Every time we went on patrol, you hurt the criminals as if you wanted to kill them. Daphne couldn't stop you at all.\" Robin turned his back to his father and walked away. He passed by Daphne. The girl gave out a small smile. He exited the cave. The young maid turned to Batman. \"Go look after him… He needs you more,\" he muttered. Daphne nodded. She rushed to catch up with Robin. Robin slammed himself onto his bed, groaning. He took off his mask and stared at the ceiling. Daphne stood at his door. \"Why can't he just leave me alone?! I've been following his rules all this time!\" he grunted. \"He's just worried that you might make another mistake. That's what fathers do…\" Daphne muttered. \"Yeah, right. The way I see it, he just wants me to play by his rule,\" the boy said, standing up. He took off his cape, glancing up at the girl. Daphne bit her lower lip. She closed the door and turned her back to him. Damian took the time to change into his usual turtleneck shirt and black pants. \"I don't get why he wants me to be like him. What if I want to decide my own life?\" Damian muttered putting on his shirt. \"I know…he doesn't have the right to decide for you, but he means well. He just wants the best for you,\" Daphne muttered, pulling at the hem of her dress. She suddenly felt someone breathing behind her. She instantly turned around. She was facing Damian's chest. She bit her lips, faintly blushing. \"You really think so? Was your father like that?\" he asked. Daphne took a step back. \"Umm…well, I guess. I'm not as smart as my sister, so he didn't really take notice of me… So did Deathstroke…\" Damian raised a brow. He didn't say anything after that. He exited his room and the girl followed him. They went to the kitchen. Daphne stared and yawned. It was almost her bedtime and she would get sleepy so easily ever since she started to be Phoenix again. Damian took his time, making himself a cup of tea. \"Are you sleepy?\" he asked, handing her a cup. \"Yeah…I'm sorry I can't stay up with you. Master Bruce had asked me a favor for tomorrow,\" she muttered, rubbing her eyes. Damian stared into his tea. \"Yeah…you should go to sleep. I want to read some books first.\" Daphne nodded. She washed her cup. \"Good night,\" she said before walking away. Damian was trying his best to be the son Bruce wanted him to be. They have been doing well at reducing crimes around town. Delphinium was always spying on them, being as sneaky as all the time. Daphne was told by Bruce to research about the missing children around Gotham. The first night of March, she was waiting for Bruce to come back from his office to give her reports on the missing children. She was progressing very well and was proud of it. She decided to wait for him in the Batcave, but on her way she caught sight of Damian in his uniform. He glanced up at her. Feeling the urge to follow, she rushed to his side. \"Where are you going?\" she asked. \"Change into your uniform. We're going out,\" he replied. Daphne followed him to the Batcave. It took her not more than two minutes to change into her uniform. When she was ready, Robin started the Batmobile. Damian caught the panic in her face. \"Are you coming?\" he asked her calmly. \"I g-guess…\" she replied. He was headed towards a town called Ichabod. Daphne sat beside him, wondering whether he was going to contact Batman or not. He sent Batman a quick message. Sensing something was off, \"How did you know about this?\" she asked. \"I've been sneaking into your room and hacking into your laptop over the past few days,\" Robin calmly replied without a second thought. She didn't ask any further. She stared into the distance. They had just passed the welcome sign for the abandoned town. Batman was on the line. Robin spoke to him privately since Phoenix forgot her communicator. The boy stopped the car. They both got out of it. \"I'd like to hear that,\" Robin suddenly said, \"Hello, officer, my son stole the Batmobile…\" Phoenix found that not amusing. She kept on listening. They soon came to a toy factory. Robin mentioned that all of the missing children owned toys made from the factory. Daphne puffed her cheeks, angry that he took all of the information she had about the missing children. He replied to Batman saying that he won't do anything. The girl assumed Batman told him to stay put. Being as reluctant as always, the boy sneaked into the factory anyway. Phoenix shook her head once, before following him. It was dark inside. She could live with that. Robin handed her a torch. She started to scheme around with him. Some faceless dolls were hung up on the ceilings. \"That's scarier than the pictures I've picked up…\" she muttered. \"Stay close…\" Robin said to her and then, replied to Batman, \"Yes, she's with me, like always… No, I'm not gonna let her do anything dangerous.\" They stepped forward, between the shelves. They saw more faceless dolls on the floor. Phoenix held Robin's hand, stopping him for a while. \"Scared?\" he asked her. \"A little…\" she said bluntly. She hates dolls, not to mention the ones in front of them were faceless. Sighing, he held her right hand in his left one. She started to walk again with him. They went down some stairs. Robin started another conversation with Batman, saying that the factory was once belonging to a man named Winslow Schott. Phoenix blocked out the conversation because she knew he stole the information from her laptop. She kept on looking around. They spotted a desk with a white cloth, stained with blood, covering something. Phoenix held his hand tighter. \"Just…calm down,\" Robin sighed, not expecting it would turn out this way. They soon came to some cages, where children were held captives. Robin was a bit surprised. He squatted down to look at all of them. \"Victimized…children,\" he muttered. \"Oh, my…\" Phoenix breathed. \"You're worried about the little ones?\" a voice spoke. Robin stood up and looked around. They searched for the owner of the voice. A light lit up in another room, right across the one they were in. All of the children hid deeper into their cages. A man stood at the entrance, with a bucket in his hand. Phoenix couldn't bear to see him. \"Don't be. You see, I love them more than you could ever know,\" the man said. \"Schott?\" Robin asked. The man stepped forward. \"Anton Schott died when he was a little boy when the monster took away his innocence. I'm not Anton. I am the Dollmaker,\" he said. \"Go hide…\" the boy whispered to Phoenix. \"But…these children,\" the girl replied. \"Batman is on his way. They're safe as long as they're in the cages. I can fight all I want…\" \"But, you're fighting children too...\" she replied, as children were released from their hiding spots and were now standing between the two and the Dollmaker. \"Just go hide,\" Robin slightly raised his voice. Phoenix let go of his hand. She backed away, before rushing into the darkness. \"Robin…remember, justice, not vengeance…\" she whispered. \"Oh…there's no use in hiding. These children knew every inch of this place,\" the Dollmaker said. He ordered the children to attack Robin. Phoenix tried her best to hide but was with no luck. One of the children did spot her. Some of them rushed in to attack her. She jumped away on time and knocked the children unconscious one by one. Batman made an appearance from above. \"I can take care of myself,\" Robin said. \"An alternate response would be, 'Thanks, Batman'. I guess I expected too much,\" Batman muttered. Amidst the fight, the Dollmaker made his escape. Robin noticed and followed him. \"Robin, no!\" Batman called out, turning to Phoenix, \"Stop him from doing anything rash.\" The girl nodded and rushed outside too. When she got there, she saw the Dollmaker with a sharp tree branch, ready to stab Robin. Before she could warn him, a man, dressed in a brown suit, wearing an owl mask, stepped in. He ripped out the Dollmaker's heart with his talon glove. Phoenix covered her mouth to muffle her scream. She immediately hid, so that the man would think that he was alone with Robin. \"Don't doubt your instincts,\" he said before leaving. Batman came just after he left. \"What have you done?\" he asked his son. \"You think that I…?\" Robin was speechless. \"All these months together, all that I've taught you, you revert to the assassin your grandfather wanted you to be,\" Batman said. Phoenix came into the picture to stop him from lecturing Robin any further. \"I could've done it easily, but I didn't…out of respect for you,\" Robin replied. Hearing sirens not far from where they were, Batman asked Robin who killed the Dollmaker. He replied coldly that Batman should figure it out himself. Then, he ran away to escape. Phoenix wanted to follow him. \"I'll give you a detailed report after this, I promise!\" she said to Batman before following Robin. Robin ran deeper into the forest behind the factory. Phoenix was right behind him, or it should be Daphne since she had taken off her mask. \"Robin! …Master Damian, wait up!\" she called, catching her breath. Robin stopped. He clenched his fists angrily. \"He never trusted me!\" he shouted, letting out all his anger on her. She stood there, listening. \"I never break the rules! I've been constraining myself from killing anyone…! All for nothing!\" He fell to his knees, inhaling and exhaling angrily. He was trying to calm himself down. Daphne looked at the boy. She approached him, intending to place her hand on his shoulder as comfort. She hesitated. She decided t comfort him with words instead. \"He was just worried about you. He was worried that you didn't change at all…\" the girl spoke up. \"I'm trying! I'm trying my hardest damn it!\" Robin turned to her. \"I know. I've been watching over you, remember…?\" she replied. Robin's anger died down when she suddenly sneezed. He stood up and faced her. She gave out a warm smile to him but she was trembling. \"L-Let's just go back to the manor for now, okay? Take a nice long bath and calm yourself,\" she stuttered. Robin nodded. He didn't know why, but he wanted to take care of her well-being, so he would do whatever it takes to make sure she is fine. And thus, we enter the second movie with a distant Damian and a very concerned Daphne. Don't forget to review! If you want that is... :)[Chapter 11] Chapter 11: Daphne woke up with a cold the next day, but she refused to stay in bed. Bruce had forbidden her from doing any chores. Since it was still Winter Break, she didn't have to worry about school. She dragged herself to every corner of the manor to keep her mind busy. Damian was occupied with some books he was reading and she didn't want to bother him. Finally, she got bored. \"Alfred, let me cook!\" she complained after tea. \"You mustn't, Miss Daphne. The Master is expecting a guest tonight at dinner,\" Alfred replied. \"Who?\" the girl asked. \"Miss Vanaver…\" Alfred replied. He was already preparing to cook dinner. The girl sighed. She took an ice-cream, receiving a scold from Alfred. She grinned sheepishly before running away. She made her way back to her room to watch cartoons. Damian was sitting on her bed with a book in his hand. She didn't say anything. She sat beside him and turned on her television. She glanced up at him once in a while. \"Is there something on my face?\" he asked her. \"Oh,…no…it's just that, I was wondering why you're here…\" she replied. \"No reason…I thought I'd come see how my servant is doing…\" Damian replied calmly. Daphne jumped when she saw what was beside Damian the whole time, his sword. She got out of her bed and backed away in an instant. The boy knew why but he didn't hide the sword. He asked, \"Still scared of this?\" She nodded once and explained, \"It scares me at how quick it could cut anything…\" \"Hah…I see…\" Damian muttered, observing his sword. Daphne bit her lower lip. The boy opened his mouth to say something but had second thoughts. He took his leave instead. Daphne blinked a few times before proceeding to lie on her bed. She smiled to herself even though she was actually still scared of what had happened just now. She fell asleep in an instant. When she woke up, she heard some voices outside her room. She peeped through her door and saw a blonde woman in a white dress with Bruce. She assumed that the woman was the Vanaver Alfred mentioned earlier. They walked passed her room to another part of the manor. Daphne took her leave to head to the kitchen. Her stomach was grumbling. Alfred was busy washing the dishes. \"So you fell asleep?\" he asked the girl. \"Yes. I feel a lot better now…\" she replied, stretching her arms. When she was busy munching on her favorite vanilla chips cookie Alfred had baked for her, Bruce called for Alfred to prepare some popcorns. He also told the butler to open up the screening room. \"They're watching a movie?\" Daphne asked. \"It would seem so…\" Alfred replied, looking at the excited girl. \"I'll send them the popcorns!\" the girl said happily. She took the two big bowls of popcorns that Alfred had prepared and headed straight to the screening room. Bruce called for her to join them. She sat between the two males, smiling happily. The two talked about Charles Dickens all through the movie. Daphne only listened and watched since she had never read any of the books. When it was close to the end of the movie, she had fallen asleep again due to her cold. \"I'm gonna put her to bed,\" Bruce said to his son. \" You're putting her to bed?\" Damian asked. Bruce picked her up into his arms. \"It's not like I've never done it before. That one month before you came by, she was always by my side, waiting for me to return from my patrol. She ended up most of the nights asleep on one of the chairs in the Batcave,\" the man replied. Damian stared at the sleeping girl. She cuddled herself closer to Bruce's chest, smiling. For some reason, the boy felt his stomach coiled. He ran away to get to his room. Bruce smiled at his reaction. Alfred came in to get the bowls. \"I sense someone is jealous, Sir,\" he remarked. \"I don't know whether he's jealous of me tucking her in bed, or of me cuddling her like this…\" Bruce replied, chuckling. \"He is just a boy, Sir…\" the butler replied, smiling. In the middle of the night, Daphne woke up from some rustling noise. She got out of bed to see what was happening. She saw a figure passed by her bedroom door. \"Robin?\" she called. \"Shhhh…I'm going out,\" the boy said. \"Wait!\" she called but was too late to stop him. He climbed out of the veranda and started running up to the gate. Daphne jumped down too. She started to follow him. She got to the gate but noticed that Bruce was there. She hid behind a tree. Robin was electrocuted by the gate's alarm system. He fell onto the ground hard. \"That's a lot better,\" he sighed. \"You didn't really think I'd let you sneak out again?\" Bruce asked him. Robin got up and turned to Bruce. \"You've got me under surveillance? It's not enough to make her spy on me?\" he asked. \"I thought we were making some progress,\" Bruce replied. \"You showed me a movie… and that gives you permission to keep me a prisoner in my own house?\" the boy demanded. Bruce squatted down to his height. \"It's for your own protection,\" he put his hand on the boy's shoulder. Robin pushed his hand away. \"Bad enough you won't let me out in public as Damian. The least you could do is let Robin have a life,\" the boy complained. Bruce grabbed the hand that Robin was pointing at him. He looked sternly at his son, signing that he didn't want to continue the argument. Robin pulled away. \"If you were a little more trustworthy, I would,\" the man remarked. \"You've never trusted me,\" Robin replied. \"Trust has to be earned, Damian,\" Bruce said. \"That works both ways,\" Robin replied and walked away. Daphne came out of her hiding. Bruce looked at her. She bit her lower lip before running after Robin. Knowing that she was behind him, the boy remarked, \"At least he trusts you to spy on me.\" Daphne looked away, saying, \"I wanted to do it. Before you came here, there were just adults here. I didn't have a friend of my age. Now that you're here…\" Robin cut her off, \"I don't want to hear it! I never consider you as a friend. Who would want to have a weak girl like you as a friend?\" Stunned by his words, the girl stopped. She stared straight ahead before muttering, \"I'm sorry.\" Then, she walked away. Damian thought of what he had said. He was angry at himself for bursting out like that. He dragged himself to his room, thinking that he could just apologize to her some other time. Delphinium was working with the Court of Owls. They had been working on some kind of project to resurrect the dead. They had been showing progress since before she started working under them. Her main reason was to help bring them down, using her own method, without involving Batman. It seemed that the Court's main goal was to eliminate Batman as he was the only one that was dragging them down. Delphinium was trying to find out their weaknesses so that she could stop them. As far as she concerns, her sister may be a target too because she bears the Phoenix name. \"Delphinium, Batman is on the move and so is the boy,\" a man in an owl mask said to her as she was busy observing one of the dead body. \"Hmmm…are they together, Talon?\" she asked. \"No, Batman has taken the bait to the museum. The boy, he sneaked out a few minutes ago. It seems the orange haired girl didn't follow him this time,\" Talon explained. Delphinium raised a brow and nodded. She fixed her mask and asked, \"You're going to approach him tonight?\" \"Yes. I would need to keep Batman busy. Send out some talons after him,\" the man replied calmly. The girl nodded. As she looked away, she sighed. She was actually really worried about Damian and Daphne. She looked up at the casket in front of her. She walked around the underground facility, observing each of the caskets to find the best talons to send out. \"I'll send them out soon. Three would be enough, right?\" she asked. \"That would be more than enough… Make sure you record the hours they could survive,\" the Talon replied. Delphinium could feel his smirk through his mask. She sighed and resumed her work. A man in a white suit came by, the Grandmaster. \"How is progress?\" the Grandmaster asked Delphinium. \"Good enough. We're sending out three tonight to see how long they would last,\" the girl replied. The Grandmaster nodded. \"Keep up the good work.\" \"Hmm,\" the girl muttered. Daphne waited patiently for Nightwing to bring back Batman. He had called for help after an ambush at the museum. They came back in his Batmobile. \"Master Bruce!\" the girl called as she rushed to his side. He forced a smile to the girl. \"Dick, I need to discuss something with you. Where's Damian?\" \"See for yourself, Bruce…\" Nightwing replied. Daphne stood there. The two male ignored her. Bruce didn't want her to know about the new threat. She blocked out their conversation. She didn't feel guilty at all for not looking after Damian that night. She was still hurt by his statement, but somehow, she felt something was missing without him around. She dragged herself back to her room. Bruce was in his son's room, waiting for the boy to return. Dick was getting some medical equipment to fix the man up. \"Care to join? I think Bruce is going to need you,\" Dick said when he saw the girl passed by. Daphne forced a smile. \"I don't want to see Master Damian yet…\" \"Come on,\" the young man insisted. He shrugged and smiled at her. Sighing, Daphne forced herself into Damian's room. It was dark. As Dick started to stitch Bruce's wounds up, Damian slipped into his room through the window. Daphne switched the lights on as Bruce ordered. \"Where were you?\" he asked the boy. \"What happened to you? Are you okay?\" Robin changed the topic. Daphne stood beside Bruce. The boy took one glance at her before turning back to his father. \"You don't get to ask questions. Now, where the hell were you?\" Bruce asked again. \"Out,\" Robin answered short. \"Where?\" he asked again. The boy insisted, \"Just out.\" \"'Out' has suddenly become a more dangerous place,\" Bruce said, noticing a sai slipped in his belt, he snatched it. \"What's this?\" \"That's mine,\" Robin said. \"I don't think so,\" Bruce replied. \"So, what are you going to do now, build a dungeon and lock me up in it?\" the boy asked, angry. Bruce looked sternly at his child. \"Despite what you may think, I'm your father, Damian, not your jailer,\" he muttered. \"A biological accident does not make you my father, and it's sure as hell doesn't make me your son!\" he shouted. Daphne widened her eyes at his statement, glancing up at the father. Bruce sighed. He mentioned about a school in Switzerland that is run by a retired general who knows far better about discipline than he does. He warned Damian that it was the place where the boy would be if he ever pulled out another stunt like this. Then, he exited the room. Dick walked away after him and closed the door. The maid was left alone with the wonder boy. \"Are you okay?\" Daphne asked the boy. \"None of your business,\" he replied coldly. \"Master Bruce was worried about you. He thought that you were in a situation like him just now,\" the girl explained. Damian ignored the girl and went to eavesdrop Bruce's conversation with Dick. Daphne didn't know what he had heard, but she was sure it wasn't something he wanted to hear. \"What's after the Batman?\" he asked the girl. She shook her head. \"I don't know. He didn't tell me anything. He just told Master Dick…\" she muttered sadly. Robin didn't say anything after that. He took off his mask. The girl took that as a sign to exit the room, but before she could, Damian stopped her. \"What I said the other day…\" he drawled. \"Hmm?\" Daphne turned to him. \"It's nothing…\" he muttered, putting his cape on the bed. Daphne nodded. She exited his room. Bruce and Dick were still outside of the boy's room. She forced a smile to them and excused herself to head to her room. \"What happened to her?\" Dick asked. \"Something about what Damian had said to her. He can't even take care of one girl…\" Bruce sighed. \"He's just a kid, Bruce. You can't expect too much from him…\" Dick suggested.[Chapter 12] Chapter 12: The Grandmaster came to the facility again. He was looking for Delphinium. The girl was busy fidgeting over the new dead bodies they had gotten in. She was humming a tune as she did to hide the fact that she was not enjoying her work. \"Delphinium, I need you by my side tonight,\" the Grandmaster said. \"Why?\" the girl asked. \"We're going to welcome Bruce Wayne tonight,\" he replied. The girl raised a brow before smirking. \"Fine…I'll be there,\" she said. She went to change her clothes and fixed her mask. She got out to the conference room in a purple wrap dress. She was not really interested in what was going to happen. Bruce was already there. He was still unconscious. When he woke up, he looked around. \"Welcome, Mr. Wayne,\" the Grandmaster started. \"Not exactly a warm welcome,\" Bruce replied. \"If we wanted you dead, you wouldn't be here now,\" the leader said. \"Who are you?\" he asked. \"The Grandmaster of the Court of Owls,\" the Grandmaster introduced himself. Bruce muttered, \"I would say the Court of Owls is merely a legend.\" Delphinium exited the conference room, into another room. She ignored what the Grandmaster was about to discuss with Bruce Wayne. She knew it was not of importance to her. She called her trusted maids, Tiara, and Mana. \"Yes, Miss?\" Tiara answered. \"Send a message to my sister. Tell her where to find Damian…\" Delphinium ordered. \"As you wish, Miss. Shall we use the pigeon?\" the maid asked. \"Use a different one, not the one that recognizes Damian,\" the girl replied. \"We don't have any more pigeons,\" Tiara replied, \"So we will be sending one of your other pets.\" \"I'll allow it,\" Delphinium replied. She sighed. Knowing her sister, the girl would be moping around by now. She knew about Damian's disappearance because Talon had been reporting about the boy to the Grandmaster. Daphne was not used to be alone too long when she is attached to someone. In this case, that someone is Damian. The orange-haired girl stood in front of one of the windows in Damian's room. Four days ago, Damian had left the manor and never returned. It was like she was alone again, with Bruce investigating a new case and all. She refused to become Phoenix because she had lost her motivation after what Damian had said. However, she couldn't help her feelings of wanting to find the boy. \"Still waiting for him to return?\" Dick came by. \"Yes…\" Daphne replied, turning to look at him who was standing by the door. \"You know he won't be returning any sooner…\" the man said. Daphne nodded. \"I do know…I just thought he might. It has been a while. It's not like him,\" the girl sighed. Dick pulled the girl into a hug. \"It's not your fault…you're just a kid. He's a kid too. Maybe he just needs some time to think by himself…\" he calmed her. \"We've been together for almost half a year now. He's my responsibility and all…\" the girl muttered. They suddenly heard a purr when Dick was about to say something. Daphne and Dick turned towards the window. A white and gray cat was there. Daphne approached it. It was a bit cautious but it didn't run away. A note was tied around its neck. She held the cat in her arms and it purred lovingly to her. Dick took the time to untie the note. \"Hmm..? It directs to you,\" Dick said. Daphne put the cat down. It immediately ran away through the same window. \"It's a message…about Master Damian. It says that he will be at the pub called The Garden,\" she muttered. \"You're not going there, are you? Bruce put me in charge of you,\" Dick asked the girl. \"I need to see him…\" Daphne replied, shaking her head, \"I want to see him…\" \"Alright…I'll send you there,\" the young man complied. Smiling, the girl nodded. She got ready to head out. They took his motorbike. He parked it far from the pub. Daphne saw two goons out in front of the entrance. \"Are you sure you'll be alright?\" he asked the girl. \"I'll be fine. I'm good at this, you know that,\" the girl replied. She got off the motorbike and casually strolled up to the two goons. They stopped her from entering. Dick watched her negotiate with them. They were smirking and nodding at what she was saying. They let her into the pub. He left her there, wishing her luck. Daphne got to the kitchen. The chefs and waiters were confused. They wondered how she got in. \"I'm the dancer he hired to entertain him tonight. Where do I change my clothes?\" she asked which was an obvious lie. Nobody saw through it. One of the waiters pointed her to the changing room. She nodded and rushed to lock herself in there. The changing room was actually the janitor's closet. She could live with that like always. She is the sneakiest person she knew after Delphinium. She heard some men laughing on the other side of the room. She listened to what they were talking about. \"I'm the evening's entertainment,\" Daphne widened her eyes at the sudden familiar voice. She took that as a sign to enter the dining room. She ran out only to see the same assassin that had killed the Dollmaker, killing the men who were in the room. She caught sight of Damian, in his uniform, hiding in the smokescreen he made to dodge the gunshots. After getting rid of all the obstacles, they cornered the last man standing. \"I can pay you. More money than you've ever seen,\" the man, who went by the name Draco, said. Robin kicked his stomach. \"I don't give a damn about money,\" he said. He punched the man's head, saying, \"What I care about is payback for the lives your drugs have ruined.\" \"Robin, no!\" Daphne shouted, charging in at him before he could kick the man again. \"What the? You?\" he stared at the girl on top of him. \"Yes, me!\" the orange-haired replied. \"Robin, you have to finish him,\" the man in the owl mask said. The boy pushed the weight on top of him to the side. He jumped onto the Draco's stomach. Given a knife by the man ordering him, Robin placed it at Draco's throat. He was hesitating. Daphne backed away, widening her eyes. She didn't realize that the man ordering Damian's every move, was observing her. \"We've found enough evidence to put him away for the rest of his life,\" Robin stated. \"Finish him,\" the masked man ordered again. \"He's already finished,\" the boy replied calmly. \"Hey.\" Draco turned to look at Robin, \"Ain't you the Batman's brat?\" Robin stepped on his face. \"Not anymore,\" he replied angrily. Daphne stood there in disbelief. Why did the message lead her to Damian? She suddenly stepped in and grabbed his arm before he could go. \"This isn't like you…\" she muttered, trying her best to look into his eyes through the mask. \"Then, you don't know me at all…\" he replied coldly, pushing her hand away, \"Leave me be.\" \"Have you forgotten about me? Was that one time that you were kind to me…a lie?\" Daphne's voice cracked. That moment at the dance flashed into the boy's mind. He gritted his teeth, glancing up at the crying girl. He remembered what Delphinium had told him on the same night. \"I'm going. Don't search for me,\" he muttered and left her there. Daphne fell to her knees. She was shocked. Her phone started to ring, it was Dick. She rejected the call. She sent a text to Batman about where Robin had been. Then, she exited the building after reporting it to the State Police. Dick was waiting for her outside. \"You reported the place?\" he asked her. She nodded. \"Yes. Thank you for coming to get me. Let's go back…\" she muttered. Not wanting to pressure her with more questions, Dick obeyed. They got back to the manor. Daphne locked herself in her room, changing into her uniform. She knew she was going against Bruce's rules but she wanted to convince Damian to come back. Once she was ready, she rushed out of the manor through her window. The girl started to roam the city, searching for the trails Robin and the Talon had left. It wasn't easy for her, but she finally found them. They were on the roof, discussing the man that Robin was supposed to kill. Phoenix tried her best to hide her presence to keep on eavesdropping but Talon spotted her easily. He grabbed her arm and pulled her out to stand beside him. He ripped off her mask. She cringed as the talon glove scratched her face. \"Is this girl making you hesitate to kill too?\" he asked Robin, gripping her right arm tighter with his talon glove. Robin didn't answer but instead, he shouted, \"Don't hurt her!\" \"Oh, so she is…\" the man muttered. He put his other hand on her throat. She gulped. Robin didn't reply, staring at the girl. Batman made an appearance before Talon could strangle the girl. The owl masked man backed away, loosening his grip on the girl. Daphne flipped and kicked his chin. Then, she went straight to Batman. Talon fixed his jaw. Robin was still shocked to see Batman. \"How did you…?\" he muttered. \"Not too hard to track, considering the bloody trail you two have left,\" Batman replied. Robin turned to the orange haired girl. \"You told him?!\" he shouted angrily. \"This is where you choose sides once and for all,\" Talon said to Robin and then fled. Batman rushed to follow him. Robin blocked his way. They started another tongue fight before Robin went out of the line and really did tick his father off. Daphne witnessed the fight between them. She was glad when Batman was able to constrain his son, but Robin freed himself. He was angry that he couldn't really give a hard blow, so he kept on fighting. They started to fall. Batman noticed a statue underneath them that they would probably hit. He covered for Robin. Daphne jumped down into the building too. She was going to stop the boy from stabbing his father, but he was actually hesitating too. Batman stood up after that. Daphne rushed to Robin to check his injury like she would always do. \"Now, let's go home,\" Batman said to him. \"My home isn't with you. It never was,\" the young boy muttered. \"Master Damian…\" Daphne gasped at his words. He pushed her hands away, took one glance at her and ran away. Daphne's motivation died again. Batman held her shoulder. \"Are you okay?\" he asked her. \"I should be, shouldn't I?\" Daphne asked, sadly looking up at him. \"You should go home. Dick is probably worried about you,\" he told the girl and patted her head once. Daphne nodded. She dragged herself out of the old building they were in. Delphinium sent out a pigeon to Dick. She had just witnessed Batman, entering the sewers towards where the hideout of the Court of Owls was. She wanted Nightwing to come get Batman for his own safety. The ritual would be beginning soon. She knew who Talon had chosen for his replacement, Robin. She wanted to make sure of Robin's choice, so she stood with everyone else in the court like always. \"Talon, introduce your protégé,\" the Grandmaster said. Talon stepped forward. \"It is an honor to present this boy to the Court. I've seen first-hand that he has greatness within him and grand destiny ahead,\" he said. \"What a speech…I hope Batman's alright…\" Delphinium mumbled to herself. She fixed her short hair and kept on listening. Her eyes were fixed on Robin, reading his every thought as if she could. \"But we must be certain of his loyalty,\" the leader of the Owls said. Robin stepped forward and said, \"You have my word.\" \"We are the Court of Owls and we require more than words. Your mask,\" the Grandmaster stated. Delphinium saw the change in Robin's expression. She knew he didn't want to give his identity away. She, too, had to do so, in order to join the Court. After coaxing him over and over again, Robin gave in. He took off his mask. \"Idiot…\" Delphinium sighed, shaking her head. She exited the conference room because she could expect what would happen next. The Grandmaster of the Court of Owls is Samantha Vanaver and she knows Bruce as well as his soon-to-be ward, Damian. When she found out that Robin is actually Damian, of course, she would kill the boy, to bring Batman a.k.a Bruce Wayne down. Delphinium dialed a number on her phone. \"Hello?\" the person on the other line said. \"I have a proposal for you. I'm going to need you to cooperate,\" she said. \"Who is this?\" the person on the other line asked. \"I'm the person you thought you had killed along with Deathstroke,\" the girl replied confidently. \"Delphinium? What do you want?\" the person on the line demanded. After negotiating with the person she had called, she hid as she watched Talon killed each and every one of the members of the Court, including Samantha. Being as sneaky as always, the girl went back to where the caskets were held. She waited there a few minutes, sending texts to her two loyal maids. Soon, Talon made an entrance with an unconscious Robin. He placed the boy in one of the empty caskets. Delphinium entered another room to keep herself well-hidden. A few minutes after that, Robin woke up. She listened to his conversation with Talon. \"You'll be safe here until I'm done,\" Talon said to the captive boy. \"You think you can stop him alone?\" Robin replied. \"Who says I'm alone?\" the man replied. He freed all of the inhuman armies from the caskets and got them ready to ambush the manor. He left Robin, with the water running. Delphinium saw him leave. She huffed angrily because Talon had taken her experiments along with him. \"Is he trying to kill Damian?\" she grunted. \"Miss, we've received your orders. Are you sure?\" Tiara asked. \"Yes, you two are my trusted companions. Disguise yourself as the talons and protect my sister,\" Delphinium ordered the two maids of hers. She heard Damian grunting. She watched as he tried to free himself from the casket. \"Get to the manor, NOW!\" she ordered her maids. \"Understood,\" Tiara replied. Daphne was still in Damian's room, staring at the sword on his bed. She was about to take it when Alfred came in with his usual expression, but she knew something was up. She followed the butler to where Bruce and Dick were. Alfred started to fidget on the screen in front of them. Talons had started to invade the manor. \"Red security grid up and active?\" Dick asked the butler. \"Unless someone shut it down and didn't bother to tell us,\" Bruce said, glancing up at Alfred. \"Most unkind, sir…\" Alfred muttered. Daphne pulled on Dick's arm. She looked at him, confused. He held her hand before pushing it away and then, he patted her head. \"Take care of her, Alfred,\" Dick requested. \"I don't know if it's Bruce Wayne or Batman the Court's come for,\" Bruce said, pulling on his mask, \"But either way, they're about to get a welcome they'll never forget.\" \"Please be careful,\" Daphne spoke up. Batman placed his right hand on her head and said, \"Stay safe.\" Daphne stared as they exited the place. Alfred took the girl's hand to pull her to follow him. She pulled away and told him that she wanted to go get something in Damian's room. The butler nodded and reminded her to get to the Batcave as soon as she got what she wanted. \"Where are you…Master Damian…?\" Daphne muttered.[Chapter 13] Whoa, we've reach the ending of the second movie, which I altered to my liking. Hehe. Anyways, please enjoy like always! :) Chapter 13: Delphinium heard a casket fell onto the floor below and crashed into pieces. She knew Damian managed to free himself. She walked out into the open to go see him. She saw him observing something on the floor. \"Took you long enough,\" she spoke up, jumping down and landed right beside him. \"Shut up,\" Damian said, still coughing. Delphinium smiled to him. Damian stared at her. He was surprised to see her hair. The older girl explained that she changed her looks so that the Court didn't know about her sister. \"So, why did you join them?\" Damian asked. \"To put a stop to this ridiculous idea of using dead bodies to make armies,\" Delphinium replied calmly. \"You are so twisted,\" the boy said. \"I know. I could live with that. I don't want to drag her with me, though…\" the girl sighed. \"How come you two are sisters?\" Damian remarked. A bit ticked off, Delphinium asked, \"Why?\" \"She's a crybaby, you're a daredevil,\" he said calmly. \"That's why I am her sister, not her twin or the exact mirror of her,\" the girl replied angrily. \"I see. She is a wonder, though…\" he muttered. Delphinium was curious and so she asked, \"Why is that so?\" \"She never stops looking after me,\" Damian whispered. The girl could hear him. She whispered as well, \"Don't take her for granted, Damian…\" Damian chose to ignore her and made a call to Alfred. \"Pennyworth, this is Damian.\" Delphinium raised a brow. She glanced up at what he was staring just now. \"Master Damian? Where are you? How..?\" Alfred's questions were cut off. \"No questions, just listen. The talons can't function in subzero cold,\" Damian stated. \"Where are you, Master Damian?\" Alfred asked again. \"I'll be back soon,\" the boy replied, cutting the line off. \"Going back already?\" Delphinium asked. \"Batman needs his Robin right now…\" the boy replied, stretching his arms. Delphinium observed him from head to toe. She kind of understood why her sister would fall for such a guy. Damian is unique in more than one way. \"She's crying Damian…\" she muttered. \"Why do I have to care?\" he shot a question. Delphinium sighed. \"Because you promised me. Damian, you can't always be like this.\" \"I choose my own path. Don't interfere,\" the boy said. \"Well then, don't come to me if you ever lose her,\" the older girl muttered, showed him the escape route that will lead to the manor fastest and left him there to think. Damian scoffed and muttered, \"Why would I worry about losing her? She's my servant…\" While that was happening, Daphne was in Damian's room, the sword in her hands. For some reason, she wanted to keep the sword safe. She wasn't able to escape on time. The talons had invaded the mansion. She put on her Phoenix uniform, slipped the sword onto her back and jumped out of the windows. She hid behind some bushes when she saw talons climbing up the roof of the mansion. She took a deep breath, hoping that their leader didn't spot her. Then, she rushed to the courtyard where one of the escape pods to get to the Batcave was. \"Daphne, where have you been?\" Dick's voice was heard. \"Master Dick! What happened?!\" she exclaimed when she saw his condition. She rushed to help him patch himself up. Batman soon made an appearance. \"There're too many of those things to fight without help,\" Batman said, approaching the two, \"Progress report, Alfred.\" \"Soon, I hope,\" Alfred replied from the screen behind Daphne and Dick. \"Soon may not be good enough,\" Batman replied sternly. A bomb was heard and the ground above them fell. Dick held the girl in his arms. Talons jumped down into the cave. Daphne widened her eyes. Batman handed her a small pouch full of bombs. He told her to aim and throw towards the Talons as many as she could. She obeyed, rushing to hide. Batman and Nightwing started to fight the hoard of talons again. Daphne hid behind a giant screen. She aimed at the talons behind the ones that the two were fighting. She threw a bomb to each one of them. Most of them hit the talons' head and some missed. When she was out of bombs, she had to change her hiding spot so that the talons couldn't find her. Batman and Nightwing split up. Nightwing rushed up the stairs while Batman rushed towards a giant door. \"Alfred,\" he called. \"A few more adjustments, sir,\" the butler replied, \"You see, I've received some pertinent information from Master…\" Batman interrupted him, \"Just open the damn doors.\" Meanwhile, Daphne backed away when three talons approached her. Her mind was blanked because she was panicking. She remembered Damian's sword. She bit her lower lip and grab onto the hilt. She shut her eyes and screamed as she rushed in to cut the obstacles in front of her. Her breath was frantic. She looked around but Batman was nowhere to be found. She caught sight of Nightwing fighting a man who had his mask off. Nightwing was having a hard time. She saw the man stabbed Nightwing on both of his shoulders. \"Master Dick!\" she screamed, catching the man's attention. He turned to her with a smirk. Daphne panicked when he jumped right in front of her. \"Daphne, run!\" Nightwing called out. Two talons suddenly kicked the man away from Daphne. The girl stared. The talons took off their masks to reveal who they were: Tiara and Mana. \"Miss Daphne, we've come for you,\" Tiara said. \"You are?\" Daphne asked. \"Now's not the time for introduction,\" Mana warned, as some talons started to surround them. The two started to fight as Daphne stood in shock behind them. The brown haired man came again and snatched the girl away. She screamed in agony as the talon glove on his right hand ripped her skin. Batman made an appearance in his Bat Armor. With Alfred on his back, they went down to the utility core. Alfred reduced the temperature of the Batcave, freezing all of the talons, except for the brown haired man and Delphinium's maids. Tiara and Mana decided to hide first. Daphne struggled to stand up as she saw the man, ready to strangle her to death. He stopped when he noticed his talons were all frozen. Driven by anger, he took the Batmobile and aimed at Batman. They started to fight. \"Batman…\" Daphne muttered. Batman had fallen and the last talon was ready to eliminate him. \"I've taken your boy…\" he started, kicking Batman. Daphne summoned all of her strength to stand up. She saw the talon stomping onto Batman's back. He took out his talons, ready to stab him. She jumped onto him. \"Like I would let you kill him!\" she shouted, angry and scared. The man grabbed her and slammed her onto the floor. She cringed in pain but that didn't stop her. She got back up, trying to kick him. He easily grabbed her left foot and swung her around before slamming her again. she coughed out blood. \"You should die first!\" he exclaimed. \"No!\" a voice came. Robin jumped down with the sai in his hand. Daphne smiled when she saw him. \"Master D-Damian…\" she muttered. Robin rushed to his father's side, checking up on him. \"Damian, listen to me, he's not worth it. Let him go. Let him die,\" he said to the boy. \"Like you let you father die?\" Robin remarked. \"Stupid boy,\" Talon said, charging in. Damian jumped away from his attack but got kicked instead. He punched the boy and smashed him onto the floor. Damian almost passed out from the hit. \"Damian he'll never let you go,\" the man said, strangling Bruce, \"For us to be free, he has to die. The Wayne fortune will be ours. The Owls, they'll never find us. Tell him goodbye, Damian.\" Damian grunted. He stood up and rushed to the man holding his father by his throat. Damian pointed his sai towards him. \"You filthy ingrate! Everything I've done for you and this is how you repay me?! Then so be it,\" he said, taking out a sai too. Daphne dragged herself to Bruce's side to check his wounds. There was no more blood gushing out and she was glad. Her back started to ache. She was losing her conscious. \"You could never replace Batman,\" she heard Damian said, \"He's my father.\" Bruce suddenly stood up. He heard every word that his son had uttered. Daphne backed away. The talon grabbed his hand and stabbed the sai into right through his throat. \"Don't doubt your instinct,\" were his last words. Daphne closed her eyes in disgust. Bruce went up to his son. \"Are you all right?\" he asked and helped him stand up. Damian stared down. Bruce placed his hand on his shoulder. \"I'm proud of you. Welcome home, Damian,\" he muttered. Damian backed away. \"No. I could have killed him. Maybe I should have,\" he said, staring at the sai, \"But you were in my head. You won't let me.\" \"Master Damian?\" Daphne whispered. \"You, Talia, Ra's, that girl, you're all in here. But where am I?\" he groaned, staring at Bruce. Bruce looked at him tenderly and kept on listening. \"How can I be the son you need me to be when I don't even know who I am?\" Damian muttered, glancing at Bruce, \"I have to go.\" \"Damian,\" Bruce called, stopping him, \"There's a school…\" \"In Switzerland… Yeah, you told me about it,\" Damian replied. \"No. No, this is a monastery in the Himalayas. I stayed there years ago when I was lost, troubled. The monks helped me in ways that proved to be very…\" his words were cut off. \"I don't need any help,\" he raised his voice. Seeing how Bruce reacted, he said, \"But maybe I will later on.\" For the first time in all of the months, Damian hugged his father. Bruce hugged his son tight. Daphne smiled at the scene. Pulling away, Damian muttered, \"I've got some packing to do.\" Daphne watched as he left his father there. She staggered up to Bruce. \"You need medical help,\" she stated. Bruce held her as she was falling. \"So do you,\" he said, smiling at her. She smiled back before collapsing. They went up to help Nightwing. Alfred came and treated the three of them. Alfred decided to send her back to her room. Bruce and Dick were visited by Tiara and Mana. Meanwhile, Damian had snuck into Daphne's room. He was looking for something without her consent. He saw what he was looking for – her hairpin. It was a matching hairpin with Delphinium's hairband. He slipped it into his pocket. Then, he went back to his room to get his travel bag. Alfred reached her room. He was about to open it when Damian pulled it open instead. The boy looked a bit surprised when he saw her condition. \"L-Leaving already?\" the butler asked. \"Yeah…\" he replied, looking away. \"You're…not going to say goodbye to Miss Daphne?\" Alfred asked, raising a brow. Damian glanced up at the girl. He took a deep breath and shook his head. Damian walked passed them. He said goodbye and was on his way. Alfred sighed. He went into Daphne's room. As he tucked her into bed, she cringed a bit. The pain from her back was stabbing her like a million needles. \"Miss Daphne…\" Alfred muttered sadly. \"Daphne…\" Dick appeared by the door. Daphne suddenly woke up upon hearing him said her name. She stared at Dick and then, at Alfred. The young man gestured at the two girls standing behind him. Tiara and Mana smiled to her. Bruce and Dick explained that Delphinium had called a few hours before the talons invaded the manor. \"She wants to have you back,\" Bruce said, glancing up at the two maids, \"They came here to get you. Delphinium is expecting you to be by her side.\" \"The company is on the verge of bankruptcy. Miss Aldrin, uh…I mean, Miss Delphinium can't make it on her own,\" Tiara explained, turning to Mana. \"She needs you by her side since you have learnt a lot of new business knowledge from Mr. Wayne here…\" Mana continued. \"I know you may need time to think…\" Bruce muttered. \"I'll go…\" Daphne spoke up. Everyone was surprised. Dick asked, \"Are you sure?\" Nodding once, the girl replied, \"Just…let me pack my things…\" She staggered out of the bed. Tiara, Mana, Dick, Bruce and Alfred looked at each other. Bruce told the two girls that Daphne has always been like this whenever Damian makes her sad. Bruce excused himself to go to Damian's room. Daphne came out after thirty minutes. Tiara carried her bag for her. \"Let's go,\" she said. \"Wait…Daphne,\" Bruce called. Daphne froze when Bruce placed a hoodie onto her back. The smell reminded her of Damian. She started to cry again, falling to her knees. Dick hugged the girl, being the brother he should be. She pulled at his shirt, sobbing hard. \"I'll come visit. I promise,\" he whispered to her. \"Hmm…\" she muttered, hiccupping. Mana picked the girl up. They bid farewell to the three men and left the manor. They sent a text to Delphinium to tell her the news. Daphne Aldrin is coming back. Delphinium received the text. A smirk formed on her face. She turned around to look at the hologram screen in front of her. She was doing some online shopping for her sister. She scrolled a few more things before closing the screen. \"I can't wait to see you, Phoenix…\" she sighed.[Chapter 14] I added a part about Delphinium training Daphne so that it makes a little sense in the next movie. The time skip is long because I need to develop these two girls' relationship with each other. Chapter 14: Daphne got down to the kitchen in her casual clothes. She decided to head to the office that day but didn't want to stand out too much. \"Good morning, Miss Daphne. Your sister had already left a few minutes ago,\" Tiara explained. Daphne flashed a smile and said, \"Morning. It's okay. I'll go there by myself. She did say she has an important meeting to attend to.\" \"I see. Would you like some toasts?\" the maid replied and offered. The girl nodded. She looked around. Not much has changed since she left. It was almost two years since her parents' death. Delphinium hadn't explained anything yet to her but Daphne was being patient. All she knew that the family's business is on the verge of bankruptcy and her sister is trying her best to prevent that. She knew she has to help in any way she can…but, what can she do? Her older sister has always been better at her in everything. A sigh escaped her lips. Upon hearing it, Tiara asked, \"Is something the matter?\" Daphne gave out a small smile, taking a toast and spreading butter on it. \"I don't know what I can do to help the business. Delphinium has always been better than me at everything…\" she muttered sadly. \"I'm sure you can do as much as she can. You're sisters…and I know that you haven't noticed, but you've been catching up to her,\" the maid said to comfort the girl. \"I hope you're right. I'll head there for now and see what I can do to help out…\" the orange haired replied with a somewhat uncertain face. After breakfast, she dragged herself to the office. It was located near some other tall buildings which Daphne could hardly recognize, but one of them belongs to Wayne Enterprise. She was amazed at how much fortune the Wayne family actually carries. She entered the Aldrin building for the first time, after five months leaving Wayne Manor. All eyes were on her. Since she was wearing a black A-line skirt and a maroon blouse, most people didn't think of her as someone important. She had never stepped foot in the building after all. That was her first time. Delphinium made an appearance down the escalator. She caught sight of her sister. \"Daphne!\" she called out happily, welcoming the girl with a hug. \"Hello, Sis. I came by to see what I can do to help…\" Daphne said rather awkwardly. She heard some whispers. Delphinium nodded approvingly towards her. She took her by the hand and pulled the girl to follow her. Daphne obliged without even saying anything. She bit her lower lip as some clerks were giving her glares. They took the elevator up to the fifth floor. \"Well, for now, I just want you to sort some paperwork for me. I mean, I am good at it, but I am not as observant as you. I want you to choose some companies that we can form partnerships with…\" the older orange haired explained. They stopped in front of a glass door. Daphne could see what was inside. There was a desk with a hologram computer on it and beside the desk was a shredder. There were shelves on the wall and on it were papers, sorted out by alphabetical order. \"Those orders are sorted by me. I just need you to find the ones that have potential and can be trusted,\" she continued her explanation. \"So…this is like my office?\" Daphne asked. \"Yes. Since you decided to quit elementary school, you can work… But I want you to go to school once the next Spring rolls by,\" Delphinium said to her sister, patting her head once, \"Well, I have another meeting to attend to. See ya and good luck!\" Delphinium sighed as she listened to the demands of the partners that were involved in the late morning meeting. She flipped through some of the papers in front of her as she listened. \"So, you're saying that you're going to withdraw your sponsors for our Japan branch? May I know why?\" she asked. \"Well, the Japanese have their own beliefs. They hardly need your pharmaceutical knowledge over there. Your company's growth seems to be stunted there,\" the woman, a representative from a company in Japan, explained to her. \"Miss Delphinium…\" her assistant called and whispered some things to her. Delphinium nodded to her assistant. She turned back to the woman who was waiting for her reply. She flashed a smirk. She said, \"I guess we can work on the papers of your withdrawal from being one of our sponsors. You have a point about the country.\" \"I see. Then, my assistant will contact you to work out the details,\" the woman said. She stood up, bowed and took her leave with two of her colonies who accompanied her. Delphinium sighed and turned to the next person waiting for her, a representative from a cosmetic company in Malaysia. The man smiled and nodded as a greeting. \"What are your demands?\" she asked. \"Well, we thought you should expand our partnership. Your knowledge and guidance are very well accepted in our company. It has been a great help,\" the man explained, showing her the company's profit margin over the years. \"Expand? We have nothing to offer much anymore. We haven't been getting any profits from our side… I know I shouldn't be saying that…and this, but our company is low on income right now,\" she explained. \"That is why I am here, with an offering…\" the man flashed a smirk at her. Delphinium furrowed a brow. She listened to the man's offer with her assistant jotting down notes for her. Meanwhile, Daphne sank in her chair as she searched for information about a company she was reading. It was a cosmetic company around Gotham City which was still crawling its way to gain more profit. She thought that they could help the company and share the profits with them. Someone was at her door, chuckling at the reactions she was making as she scrolled the net. \"First time I saw you this messed up,\" a familiar voice said. Looking up, she was surprised to see her visitor, \"Master Dick! What are you doing here?\" \"I thought I should visit you. It has been five months since you left Wayne Manor and we haven't heard from you. Alfred sends his regards,\" Dick explained his visit. \"Would you like some coffee?\" she asked. Shaking his head, he replied, \"I thought we could grab lunch. There is something I'd like to talk about…\" Daphne furrowed a brow and muttered, \"With me? That's unusual…\" She stood up and walked up to him. Dick kept the smile on his face. Delphinium suddenly came in with a groan, ready to complain to Daphne about the meeting she had just had. She stopped and stared at the unusual visitor. \"How did you get in here?\" was what she said first. \"I just told them that I am a friend of their boss,\" he replied calmly. Delphinium turned to her sister. Daphne shrugged. She turned to stare at Dick again. She made a dissatisfied face at him. \"Taking my sister on a date or something?\" she muttered. He chuckled and replied, \"Yeah…something like that. May I?\" Daphne stepped up, \"He came all the way here after all… Can I go?\" Her sister sighed. \"Okay…but be back for dinner. Mana and Tiara are cooking your favorite,\" she gave in. The younger Aldrin nodded. She smiled at Dick and followed him out of the office. Delphinium sighed again. She decided to eat lunch by herself. Daphne took the extra helmet Dick had brought. They rode his motorbike to a small café. They sat down and ordered some snacks. \"So, care to explain?\" Daphne asked. Dick nodded. \"You still keep yourself in shape?\" he asked. \"Yes. I played around with my sister. She told me I have to be ready in case there will be another 'kidnapping'… She said it sarcastically,\" the girl replied, smiling at the waitress who had brought their food. She started to eat her cake, waiting for Dick to react. Dick sipped on his coffee. \"I see. That's good then. I thought of training you…\" he muttered. \"Why?\" she asked, rather surprised. Dick smiled and explained, \"This is just a thought, though, maybe making you stronger would not drag him down too much…\" \"He's in the Himalayas…\" she said, looking down at her tea, \"I…do not need to care about him anymore.\" Dick chuckled at her reply. \"I hope you're right…\" he muttered, munching on his donut. \"Besides…I will never be Phoenix anymore. I'm just training for fun now since Delphinium won't stop bugging me to be her sparring partner,\" she replied coldly. The young man nodded to her explanation. He finished his donut and looked at her face. He noticed something was different on her hair. \"Why are you wearing the Phoenix hairpin…?\" he suddenly asked. Daphne looked at him and touched the hairpin. \"I couldn't find the one I used to wear. That was actually a matching one with my sister's hairband. We had it since we were three…and I lost it,\" she sighed. \"What was her reaction?\" Dick asked. \"Hmm? She said it was okay…she'd buy me a new one but it'll be hard to find the exact same one…\" Daphne explained. Furrowing his brow, he suggested, \"Don't you think Damian may have taken it?\" The girl gave out a frown. \"Why would he? It's not like he can wear it…\" she scoffed. \"As a memento maybe…like how Bruce gave you that hoodie,\" he teased. \"Haha…very funny…\" she replied, a bit anger in her tone. They finished their food and Daphne paid for it. Dick insisted that she should visit Bruce and Alfred. She nodded to his words, saying that she would think about it. \"How are they, by the way?\" she asked. \"They're doing fine. They just missed the squeaky voice a certain girl would always make…\" he teased her again. \"I will get you for that…\" she said, gritting her teeth to hide her anger. It was true. She had a sort of squeaky voice. It shows how spoilt and carefree she used to be. She couldn't change the voice at all. Her sister, on the other hand, has a deep and far more mature voice. She sighed again. Dick sent her back to the Aldrin building after their discussion. \"Thanks for the food,\" she said to him. \"I should be thanking you. You paid for it after all,\" he replied. He patted her head once and then, left the place. Daphne looked down sadly. It was a lie if she had admitted that she didn't care about Damian. Damian had never left her thought. She just didn't want to think about it. He was the first boy to have caught her attention. \"How are you doing there, Master Damian…?\" she uttered, touching the Phoenix hairpin. \"Hmmm…\" Delphinium hummed, looking at the folders that her sister had brought for her. It had been a week since Dick came to visit her. Daphne was progressing with her search for business partners for the Aldrin Pharmaceuticals. Delphinium was retracting any partners who are no use to them and also who they thought they cannot help. It was late at night and they were still at the office, sorting out some more details. \"I'm getting good at being evil…\" Delphinium joked, staring at another paper her sister showed her. \"Aren't you always good at that…\" Daphne laughed. Delphinium started laughing too. \"Well, let's get going home. Tomorrow is Saturday. We can do some light sparring,\" she said to her sister. \"Fine…\" the sister sighed. They packed their things and headed straight home. Once they had arrived, they went to the kitchen to have their supper prepared by Tiara. After that, they went straight to bed. Daphne tossed and turned in her bed, thinking about Damian. She soon drifted off to sleep. The next day, it was Delphinium's turn to make breakfast. She only made some toasts and fried bacon strips. She didn't want her sister to eat too much because she would be training her afterwards. \"Seriously, I don't get why you wanted me to stay in shape…\" the younger Aldrin complained. \"I just want you to show Damian that you can fight too,\" Delphinium hummed happily. She was busy preparing some things she wanted Daphne to try out. After breakfast, they went straight to the lawn or what Daphne would call the training grounds. It was full of obstacles and dummies that Delphinium and her two maids use to stay fit. \"Here,\" Delphinium handed her a small bag. \"Hmm? What's in here?\" Daphne said, checking it. She took out a stun gun. She frowned at her sister. Delphinium smiled, satisfied of what she had chosen for her sister. \"Since you're not the type to kill people, I thought stunning them is the most appropriate thing for you to do,\" she explained, pulling a dummy in front of her sister. \"So, should I just aim at it?\" Daphne asked, confused. \"Nope…\" her sister started, jumping up onto a tree and getting a target board ready on the branch. \"Then?\" Daphne asked, playing around with the gun. \"Today,\" Tiara made an appearance beside the younger Aldrin, \"We're going to teach you how to throw the gun towards your enemy…\" Daphne blinked, disbelieved that her maids were onboard with the idea. Delphinium jumped back to her sister's side. She nodded to what Tiara had said. Daphne shook her head and blurted, \"Why would I throw this? It is not for throwing!\" Tiara and Delphinium turned to look at each other. \"Mana is working on a design to make it easier to throw. For now, we have to use this one,\" Delphinium explained. Daphne sighed. There was no arguing with her sister. She knew that she could never win. Delphinium smiled happily. She explained to Daphne what the girl had to do. Tiara stood by and watched the two. She was happy that the sisters were back together.[Chapter 15] Here is the beginning of the third movie for my Daphne and Delphinium. :) I can't believe they already have a fourth movie for this! xD Anyways, enjoy like always. Have a day! C hapter 15: A call came for her from their home. She glanced up at her sister. Daphne nodded to her. Delphinium put it on loud speaker mode. \"Miss Delphinium? We have a situation…\" Tiara said from the other side. \"What is it?\" she asked. Daphne listened too, of course. \"One of your surveillance cameras was busted. We can't get anything from it,\" Tiara explained. \"Can you point out its location?\" Daphne was the one who asked. She knew about her sister placing surveillance cameras all over town to spy on Phoenix, Batman, and Robin. She didn't have any use for them anymore but Daphne wanted them to remain so she could keep track of Batman. \"Well…not really. You should come back soon and see for yourself…\" the maid replied rather nervously. The sisters noticed the different tone she was using. They knew it was something important. Delphinium hung up after that. \"Ever thought of changing our company into a tech business?\" Daphne teased. \"My cameras are only for me and you to work on. They are heat tolerant, cool tolerant, waterproof, fireproof…\" Delphinium said proudly. Daphne nodded and finished her sentence, \"But have two weaknesses.\" \"Yeah…I should fix that soon, or all of my cameras will be shot or bombed…\" the older one groaned. Daphne nodded. They both decided to go home for the day. Once they got there, the first thing they did was going into Delphinium's study. She searched for the one screen that was not showing any footage. \"Hmm…\" Delphinium hummed. \"Where is that located?\" Daphne asked. \"It's a factory, a dock or something…I forgot,\" the older sister replied. \"Mana is already there to check it,\" Tiara butted in. Delphinium nodded to her maid's words. She said, \"Let's wait for her to come back…\" Tiara nodded. She prepared some tea for them. Mana came back an hour after that, in her spy uniform. She explained to them that the camera was caught it an explosion. She took out a small memory card that she thought came from the camera. \"It is one of the cards I planted in that camera. Damn…\" Delphinium groaned. She placed it into her computer to see what was in it. What they saw shocked them, especially Daphne. They saw a masked woman, dressed almost similar to Batman, fighting some masked villains. Daphne could only recognize half of them. \"Who is that?\" Delphinium's first question came out. \"Hmmm…I'm not sure, but I've seen her before in one of Batman's database in his cave… She is called Batwoman,\" Daphne muttered, trying to recall what she had memorized when she was with Bruce. \"I wonder why she was there. Her bomb was what caused my camera to be destroyed…\" the older Aldrin said, anger filled her mind. \"I'm not concerned much about that. Your footage worries me…\" Daphne muttered, thinking hard, \"I hope nothing happens to her or Batman…\" \"Well…this footage came from three days ago…\" Delphinium muttered, checking the date. She caught the worries in her sister's tone. She guessed that Daphne would be leaving soon to be Phoenix once again. The girl could never move on from that life. She created Phoenix and was the first to ever bear the name. She interrupted her sister's thinking by telling her to get some sleep for the day. Daphne obliged. Daphne played the news that was spread widely across Gotham City. It was her tenth time watching it. She was in her office, sorting out the papers for the next partnership which Delphinium would be signing and performing in the near future. The video showed Commissioner Tim Gordon giving a speech. \"It's not like he punches the time clock, but I can assure you that Gotham police force is more than capable of keeping the city safe, even without a masked hero to back us up…\" he said. \"I left you for just one second and you're watching that again,\" Delphinium sighed. Daphne looked guiltily towards where her sister was standing. She closed the video and sighed. \"I'm sorry...I just...\" she mumbled. Delphinium went up to her sister. She hugged the girl to comfort her. Gazing at her sister, she asked, \"Do you want to go there? I think they would need you...\" Daphne stared down at the papers. She muttered, \"I don't know. I mean, I can't leave you here doing all the work alone. I am your sister...\" Delphinium smiled to her younger sister and said, \"I know that, but you're also Phoenix... The first and maybe the last too…\" Daphne looked sadly away from her sister. She pulled at the string of the orange hoodie she was wearing. She thought of how Damian would feel about his father going missing. Her sister patted her head a few times before exiting her office. She knew that Daphne needed to be alone. \"Master Damian...\" she muttered. Damian threw the bucket and brush into his room. He shut the door and slammed himself onto his bed. He stared at the bag he had brought with him to the monastery. He opened it and reached out for two things: his tablet and Daphne's hairpin. He placed the tablet on his chest and gazed at the hairpin first. Daphne's crying face flashed into his mind. He shook his head rapidly, putting it back into his bag. He started to fidget on his tablet. Then a message popped up, \"Where is Batman?\" The boy pressed on the logo of the bat and watched the footage of Gordon, giving a speech. \"It's not like he punches the time clock, but I can assure you that Gotham police force is more than capable of keeping the city safe, even without a masked hero to back us up…\" he said. \"You're a bad liar, Gordon...\" he muttered, getting ready to leave. He took one last glance at the bucket and brush that he had thrown before shutting the door behind him. It was time for him to resume his role as Robin. He sighed as he thought of Daphne. Daphne stood at the front gate of Wayne Manor. She stared up at it, hesitating whether to go inside or not. Suddenly, the gate opened as if it was expecting her. She stepped into the lawn, looking around. Alfred exited from the manor. He flashed a smile at her. \"Welcome back, Miss Daphne...\" he said. Daphne ran and hugged the butler. \"Thank you, Alfred...\" she muttered. \"I wasn't expecting a hug...\" he chuckled. She laughed. They went inside. Alfred brought her to her old room. She placed her duffel bag on the bed. Then, she followed Alfred. He told her that he had to stand in for Bruce to cover up about his absence from Wayne Enterprise. They went straight to the Batcave because Nightwing would be meeting Alfred there. Daphne stood beside Alfred as he put on his headset to attend a meeting in Bruce's place. \"Your trip to the rainforest seems ill-timed, Mr. Wayne,\" Bannister said after listening to the lie that Alfred had come up with, \"With the world tech summit coming up…\" Alfred interrupted, \"It's not for another week, Ms. Bannister. We're down here studying rare herbs that could prove revolutionary for medical research.\" \"That's a good one…\" Daphne whispered. \"And earn millions for our pharmaceutical interests,\" Lucius Fox, Bruce's assistant cut in. Ms. Bannister replied, \"All well and good, but why did you have to lead the team?\" Alfred replied, \"Because it's my company…and I can do whatever the bloody hell I want to.\" \"You still have to answer to this board, Mr. Wayne,\" Bannister insisted. Daphne hummed as she walked around the Batcave, ignoring the rest of the conversation between Alfred and Bannister. Nightwing made an appearance. He didn't seem happy, but he was glad to see her. She rushed to hug him. \"How long has he been gone?\" he asked Alfred, patting Daphne's head as he did. \"Two weeks, one day, fifteen hours…\" Alfred muttered. \"Wouldn't be the first time,\" Nightwing replied. The butler muttered, \"But he's never been gone this long without notifying me in some way. Last night, the signal was up for an hour, third time this week.\" Daphne went up to her uniform. She stared at it as she listened to Alfred. \"And if the police are aware of his absence, then you can be certain the criminal class is as well. There's already been a sharp uptick in underworld activities,\" the butler continued. \"My sister was invited to attend one of their gatherings a few times. They didn't really know that she's moved on…\" Daphne interrupted. \"If Batman doesn't return soon…\" Alfred muttered. Nightwing said, \"I know…all bloody hell's gonna break loose.\" He walked up to Batman's old uniform and said, \"Even when you've disappeared I can't get away from you.\" Daphne took out her uniform, earning the attention of Alfred and Nightwing. The young man asked, \"Are you going to take your role as Phoenix again?\" The girl gave out a small smile and nodded. She went to change into her uniform. She came back with two new pouches on her belt. \"What's in there?\" Dick asked. \"Oh…some things…\" the girl hummed. \"Are you going to head out?\" Alfred asked. Nodding, the girl explained, \"I need to gather some information on someone…as well as on Batman's disappearing. I'll be back by night time.\" She did come back after dinner time and saw Dick, as Batman, ready to go out, starting the Batmobile. She sighed as she thought of taking a rest. He turned to her. \"Hop on. We're going to answer their call this time,\" he muttered. \"Good luck, Master Dick, Miss Daphne,\" Alfred said. Daphne took the seat beside Dick. He started the mobile. Daphne was busy with her phone as Dick drove. \"What's up?\" he asked her. Daphne put it away and replied, \"It's my sister. She's checking up on me. It is my first time as Phoenix again after so long.\" \"You did train with her. I'm sure you'll be fine…\" he remarked and she smiled. They soon arrived at the port where Mask was getting his new weapons shipments. It was quiet when they arrived. \"I'll be sneaking in now...\" Daphne muttered. \"Be careful. You may be stronger than before but you're still a girl...\" Dick reminded her. Daphne nodded. She got out of the mobile and rushed out of sight. Dick did the same thing. He had to make a little bit of a grand entrance as Batman had been missing for quite some time. Daphne kept herself hidden as good as always. She listened in. \"New guy thinks he can move in. I'm gonna show those punks who's top dog around here,\" she heard a clicking of a gun and, \"Gotham's my bitch.\" \"Which makes you mine, Mask,\" Batman said. \"You're supposed to be dead. Let me fix that for you,\" Mask said. Gunshots were heard. Then, she heard men's grunting. One by one was punched and kicked by Batman. She saw some more, standing by to shoot him. Daphne jumped in and attacked one of the gunners atop a container. Another one tried to shoot her but Batman kicked him before he could. Daphne shocked the one right beside her with her stun gun. She suddenly heard Mask's voice, shouting, \"Somebody kill this freaking kid!\" She watched as Robin ran towards the moving truck. \"Master Damian…?\" she mumbled to herself. She glanced up at her weapon, a stun gun redesigned by her maid. It was in a shape of a butterfly with a small button for a switch on its body, very thin like a Batarang, and could easily stick anywhere. Her sister's excuse was that it was 'cuter' to carry around. She threw her it towards Mask, silencing him. She went down and tied him up immediately. Batman and Robin busied themselves chasing down the loaded truck. Daphne took her time tying up the other men that were unconscious as well. After a while, she heard an explosion and then, police sirens. \"Well, time to make my move…\" she muttered. \"Who are you?\" Mask demanded. She looked down at him and smiled, but she didn't answer his question. She hid as the police came in. She sent a quick message to Dick that she would head to the manor first. She didn't want to see Damian just yet. She wasn't ready at all. Batman and Robin made their escape with the Batmobile. \"There's no way you're gonna pull this off without my help,\" Damian said. \"Modest as ever, I see,\" Dick said. Damian smirked and replied, \"I'm more Batman than you'll ever be. Just follow my lead.\" Dick received the message from Daphne right about the time an alarm came, alerting them that they were being tailed. He sighed as he had forgotten all about Daphne. \"We're being tailed…\" he muttered, looking at the screen in front of them. \"So she's around too?\" Damian asked. Knowing who the boy meant, he replied, \"Yeah...she went ahead. She has things to take care of...\" The next morning, Daphne made herself a toast. Alfred didn't bother her as he wiped one of the washed cups. She quickly ate the toast, rushing to head to her room. Unfortunately, she bumped into Damian. He stared, raising a brow at her because she was wearing his hoodie. She swallowed her food and looked away from him. He walked passed her without a word. She glanced up at him. He was discussing some things with Alfred. She walked away. \"How long is she staying here?\" Damian asked the butler. \"Until Master Bruce is found I presume. She didn't spare me any details...\" Alfred replied, preparing some food for Damian. The boy took out the hairpin from his pocket. He stared at it for several minutes. Alfred could not help but smile at the boy. He knew he cares deeply about Daphne but he didn't know how to express it. Daphne lied down on her bed. She received a few texts. One of them was from Dick, telling her what happened after she left the port. The other texts were from Delphinium and her two maids. It was regarding their company. She checked each one. The last one was from Delphinium reminding her that she shouldn't worry about them. She felt guilty and somewhat selfish for choosing to find Batman over saving her company. \"It is only until Master Bruce is found...\" she muttered, rubbing her forehead. \"I thought so…\" Damian muttered. Startled, the girl sat up on her bed and turned to look at her door. Damian was leaning against the wall inside her room. She bit her lower lip, looking away. Damian stared down. \"I heard from Grayson…\" he started, but she wasn't really listening, \"You've gotten stronger.\" Daphne glanced up at him. She didn't reply. Her phone rang and she quickly answered it, thanking the person who had called her. Damian left when he saw her picked the phone up. He scratched the back of his neck, groaning and walking to his room. \"Sis? Are you busy?\" Delphinium asked. \"Why?\" Daphne asked. There was silence for a few seconds before Delphinium said, \"I need to discuss something with you.\" \"I can spare some time… I mean, Batman is only active at night…\" the girl joked. \"Cool. I'll meet you at the manor. Is that okay?\" her sister asked. \"I think so…\" Daphne replied, \"I'll tell Alfred.\" She hung up. She got off the bed to find Alfred. The butler was busy, getting the ingredients for lunch. She sat at the counter, watching him. He asked, \"Is something the matter, Miss Daphne?\" Daphne hummed. \"My sister wants to come for lunch. Can she?\" \"If it doesn't bother Master Damian, then I do not see why not…\" he replied. \"Alright! Thanks, Alfred. We'll be having lunch in my room then. I'll help you cook,\" the girl said, rushing to Alfred's side. The butler laughed at her behavior. She didn't mind. She helped him out where she can with lunch. The two didn't notice that Damian was watching them. It had been a while since he last saw that innocent smile of hers. \"How is Miss Delphinium holding up?\" Alfred asked. \"She's been doing fine. The business is kind of dragging her down but she seems well. Why do you ask?\" Daphne was confused. \"No reason. I am just concerned,\" he replied calmly. Once lunch was ready, Daphne served them for Damian. Then, she took her half and Delphinium's. She headed straight to her room before Damian come downstairs. Delphinium was at the front door. Alfred welcomed her. He told her that Daphne was waiting. She caught sight of Damian. She smirked at him. \"Decided to come home?\" she scoffed. Damian glared. \"Why is she here?\" he asked Alfred. \"I've come to see my sister, not that you care. She didn't mention about you coming back,\" Delphinium replied before Alfred could say anything. \"The one who is missing is my father, not yours. So, mind your own business,\" the boy replied coldly. Delphinium huffed. \"I don't understand why my sister cares for you…\" she mumbled loud enough for him to hear. Damian widened his eyes at her words. He glanced up at Delphinium as she followed Alfred to Daphne's room. He went to the dining table to eat his lunch. \"So…he asked what?!\" Daphne exclaimed. She had listened to her sister's complaints and explanations about a certain partnership. She knew that Daphne will never accept the offer. \"Yeah… Do you think we should go on ahead with it?\" her sister asked for her opinion. Daphne blinked a few times before replying, \"I'm only 12 years old! School is starting soon too…\" \"I know. I don't even know how he knew you're still alive. I've been keeping you as a secret up until now…\" the older Aldrin explained. Daphne sighed. She didn't want to expand the partnership with such a condition. Delphinium didn't wait for her to answer. They got a call from Arnold, saying that another sponsor wished to withdraw from the company. \"Think about it…but not too much. Find Bruce Wayne first. He said he'll give you time until you're ready…\" Delphinium said, holding her sister's hand, \"So, tell us when you're ready…\" \"Hmm…\" Daphne muttered a reply. Alfred came in to take the dishes for them. Delphinium took her leave. She noticed Damian entering his room when she exited Daphne's. She decided to go see him. \"What do you want?\" he asked, anger in his tone. Delphinium smiled. \"Don't you have a better way to greet your guest?\" she asked. \"You're not my guest, you're her guest…so go back already,\" he was ticked off. The orange haired gazed towards him. He looked away, ignoring her. She spoke, \"I know you're ticked off and all about Batman's disappearance. I know he's alive. I just…want to ask a favor of you.\" \"What?\" he demanded. \"Please watch over my sister just like how she watches over you…\" she requested. Then, she left. Damian grunted, lying down in bed. Night came too soon. Robin and Batman went on patrol like any other night. Daphne decided to search for clues on her own because she was still avoiding Damian at all cost.[Chapter 16] Chapter 16: As Batman and Robin patrolled the city, Phoenix was out on her own. She had been following Batwoman. Damian was having a hard time dealing with his feelings towards Daphne. He was sighing the whole time in the Batmobile. Dick chuckled, earning his attention. \"What's so funny?\" Damian demanded. \"Can't a man laugh?\" Dick shot back. Damian scowled and looked away. \"You think she'd be staying long?\" he asked. Before Dick could answer, an alert went up. The security of Wayne Tech had been breached. Dick and Damian turned to look at each other. He sent a quick message to Daphne even though Damian said it was not a good idea. It was lucky that Daphne was close to the Wayne Enterprises at the time. She took one last glance at where Batwoman was headed before rushing to the vault. She swiftly made her way through most of the surveillance cameras. When she got to the vault, she saw the Heretic, as mentioned by Batwoman's 'dad' just now. She took out her stun gun, silently walking in the shadows. She listened to the conversation as they moved. They stopped at a wall. The one named Kuttler started to fidget with his glove, accessing what was beneath the wall. Daphne observed her surroundings to decide what was best to do. \"Dad!\" she heard a shout. She peeked and saw Lucius Fox in his son's arms. Heretic spotted her. \"Looks like we've got company,\" he muttered, glaring daggers at her. Daphne backed away, but Tusk was fast. He jumped behind her, quickly grabbing her hand that was holding the butterfly-shaped gun. She cringed in pain. Daphne swung herself, kicking Tusk in the jaw. She jumped away. The light went off. She quickly hid as the Batmobile entered, restraining Tusk in the process. Robin and Batman made an appearance. Batman started to fight Heretic and Onyx. Kuttler got the components, ready to shoot Dick but Damian stopped him. Daphne jumped in before Tusk could attack Damian. \"You okay?\" she asked. \"I can handle them myself, but thanks anyway,\" he replied, dodging another hit from Kuttler. Daphne nodded. She jumped away when Tusk tried to hit her. Damian kicked Tusk to grab his attention. Daphne turned to Dick who seemed to have difficulty fighting both Heretic and Onyx. She saw that Onyx was using a katana, a weapon that had killed her parents. She pushed away her thoughts, rushing in and kicking Onyx in the stomach before she could stab Dick. She glared at Daphne, charging in towards her. Daphne, having a uniform with little protection, got cut by the katana most of the times. The least she could do was minimize Dick's trouble of having to fight both of them at the same time. \"She's too fast for me…\" the girl mumbled to herself. She took out another stun gun. She was aiming at Onyx's throat but got cut yet again. Onyx was about to finish her when she heard Heretic's order. She stared down at Daphne one last time before running towards where her associates were. Daphne turned to Damian. She widened her eyes at what Electrocutioner was doing. \"Master Damian!\" she shouted, ignoring her surroundings. She kicked the man, stopping him for mere seconds. He was about to continue but Heretic threw a knife right into his heart, killing him. He escaped after that. Daphne helped Damian up to his feet, only to make him go chasing after them. Dick was right behind him. Daphne was about to do the same when she saw Lucius and his son. She decided to help them first. \"I'll call an ambulance…\" she said to the man who was with Lucius Fox. \"Please, my Dad needs help,\" the man said. Daphne nodded, replying, \"I know…\" Dick came back with Damian in his arms. Daphne quickly stood up, as worried as always. \"Don't worry, he's fine…\" Dick reassured her. Luke carried his father out of the building. It was lucky that the ambulance had already arrived. Dick, Damian, and Daphne went back in the Batmobile. \"Where have you been?\" Dick asked the girl. Touching Damian's cheek, she explained, \"I tailed Batwoman. I found out about those guys and stuff. I had a little conversation with her as well…\" She wiped the blood on the boy's face. Biting her lower lip, she held in her tears. She was angry because she couldn't do anything to help him at all. She was still weak . It was the night after the fight. Daphne leaned against the wall, right beside the door to Damian's room. Her bruises were mostly healed. She was glad that she took the time to train with her sister. She stared at the folded hoodie in her hands as she listened to Alfred and Damian's conversation. She only heard a few words. \"He's not my father! And neither are you,\" she heard Damian complained. \"And for that, young man, you should be profoundly grateful,\" Alfred said as he walked to the door. Daphne stood up. Alfred raised his a brow when he saw her. She gave a small smile. He saw that her wounds were mostly healed. \"You may want to keep him company, Miss,\" he said before walking away. She peeked and saw Damian lying down on his bed. She stood at his door with her hands behind her, wondering whether she should enter the room or not. \"Hey…\" she heard Damian called. She turned to look at him. He was staring at her. She came up to him but kept her mouth shut. \"Aren't you going to cry or say things you shouldn't?\" he asked. She sat down on a chair that was beside the bed. He raised a brow at her again. \"Any reaction at all?\" he muttered. Daphne looked down at her hands on her lap. She said, \"I couldn't protect you from getting hurt at all. I'm sorry…\" \"An apology is not necessary…\" Damian interrupted. She nodded and replied, \"You are my responsibility, Master Damian.\" Silence filled the room for a few minutes. Damian didn't know what to say. Daphne placed the hoodie at the edge of his bed. \"I'm sorry for holding onto this too long. It is your favorite one so I'll return it now. It was a big help, gave me a little closure…\" she muttered, gazing at the hoodie. She stood up and walked straight to the door. She turned back and said to him, \"I won't stop you from going out though I would still be following you.\" \"Then, just come with me already,\" Damian suddenly heard himself said. \"Huh?\" Daphne stood at the door, surprised. Damian stood up and stepped closer to her. He held her hand, looked into her eyes and repeated, \"Come with me.\" She looked away from his gaze, nodding. A few minutes later, Robin and Phoenix got down to the Batcave. There was only Dick's motorbike there. The two looked at each other. Daphne smiled. \"Lead the way…\" she said, sighing. Damian nodded. He got down the stairs as she followed. He took the helmet and was about to hand it over to her when someone shot him. Daphne turned and saw the Heretic. Damian groaned, spinning around. Daphne held his arms to keep him still and he pulled the needle out from the back of his neck. He pushed Daphne away to stand beside him. \"You made a big mistake coming here,\" Damian said, rushing to attack Heretic. Daphne stood watch. She knew that Heretic was out of her league but she had to do something. Damian aimed his fist towards Heretic's face but he caught it. \"I was trained to never make mistakes. Just like you,\" he said, going to punch Damian. Damian jumped away on time. Daphne wanted to say something but his expression showed that she should just stand back. She knew Damian's vision was getting even more blurry because the drug from the needle was kicking in and he soon collapsed. \"Master Damian!\" Daphne called, rushing up to him. Heretic stared down at her. Daphne growled. She took out her ordinary size stun gun and charged at Heretic. He swiftly pushed aside her hand, sending the gun away. She tried to kick him, but he swiftly dodged it. The girl took out a knife, trying to stab him next. Stepping aside and pulling at her arm, he hit her back. She gasped, but that didn't stop her. She held his foot to still his movements, trying to get up. He kicked her stomach. She tried to catch her breath. He held her head, threatening to crush her. Daphne kicked around as he lifted her up. \"I should probably leave you here…but you could be useful to tame the boy,\" he muttered. \"You'll pay for this!\" Daphne growled, trying to kick him. Heretic's sidekick, Onyx came to view. He threw Daphne to her and she held the girl still. Daphne watched as he picked up Damian. \"Don't touch him!\" she shouted. \"Shut the girl up,\" Heretic ordered. Onyx landed a chop to the back of Daphne's neck. She watched her own vision fade to black. Damian opened his eyes, trying to make up where he was. \"Where am I?\" he muttered. He saw Kuttler plugging a hard drive. Tetch, a man with the mad hat, placed another electrode bud on his forehead. His vision cleared and he could see his father. \"What the hell are you doing?\" he demanded, looking around. He caught sight of Daphne, her hands tied up to the walls in the corner of the room. Her feet were tied too and she was conscious. She looked bruised and injured. Her uniforms were in tatters. She must've put up a good fight before getting restrained. \"Unfortunately, I have no more choice in this than you do,\" the man in the hat replied. Heretic and Onyx made an appearance. When Damian asked who he was, he pulled off his mask. He turned to look at Damian. \"I'm you, Damian…all grown up,\" Heretic replied. \"You're not me. You can't be,\" Damian glared. Daphne widened her eyes. She listened further. \"I'm the product of a program that your, our grandfather initiated. He wanted to create the perfect soldier. They used your DNA and put it through a process of accelerated growth. Most of the prototypes died quickly, but I survived. I was the strongest of them all…\" he said, approaching Damian, \"Still…I was an empty shell, till Mr. Tetch here brought me to full consciousness. As a good a job as he did, there's always been something missing. A void.\" Daphne stared up at the restraints that were holding her off. It was just a simple rope. She watched Heretic kneeled down beside Damian. \"And I'm going to fill that void…with you,\" he pulled Damian closer to him, \"Everything in there…\" he tapped at Damian's forehead, \"…is going in here…\" he tapped at his own. \"You, brother…will provide me with a soul.\" Damian glared like always. Daphne kept quiet to listen. \"The hell, I am,\" Damian spat. Heretic stood up and said, \"It's not like you have a choice, but if you rebel, I may have to kill her.\" \"Like he cares…\" Daphne mumbled when Heretic pointed at her. \"I don't understand why she just doesn't grow another one of you. She's got a freezer full of…\" Tetch's words were interrupted when Talia barged in. \"Are you insane?\" she said angrily. \"Mother,\" Damian said. \"Miss Talia…\" Daphne muttered, disbelieved. She stepped into the room. She slapped Heretic and glared at Tetch. \"How dare you!\" she uttered. Tetch shrugged and replied, \"It wasn't my idea. This lunatic said he'd kill me if I…\" Talia shouted, \"Shut up!\" and turned to Heretic, \"You'll suffer for this.\" Heretic glared. \"My entire life I've been suffering! Tell me, what is a man without memories? I want to know you, and love you, as he does,\" he gestured at Damian. \"I want to feel you in my heart, in my blood.\" Daphne suddenly pitied Heretic. He kneeled down in front of Talia, begging her to let it happen. He hugged her. She caressed his hair. Daphne turned to Damian who was watching all the time. \"You poor tormented creature, how could I not have felt the depths of your pain? How could a mother have left her child so alone…in the dark,\" Talia muttered and shot Heretic, bringing him to his death. Daphne widened her eyes, shocked. Damian turned to Talia. \"How could you just kill him like that?\" he demanded. \"He's flawed…\" his mother replied. \"What about me? Am I a flawed too?\" the boy asked. Talia put away her gun and instructed Tetch to alter Damian's memories and make some necessaries 'adjustments'. She said that she can't have Damian the way he is: recalcitrant and emotional. She turned to Daphne. The girl immediately looked away. Talia didn't do anything to her. She ordered Onyx to dispose of Heretic's body. \"We will kill the girl when it is necessary,\" was all she said regarding Daphne. They kept working on Bruce after that. Damian was left that way for the time being. He didn't make any movements to try and free himself. He glanced up at Daphne at times. She was watching them too. She didn't know exactly what they were doing, but she knew it was not good. She stayed as quiet as possible. Tusk came in after half an hour. \"It's the bats. Three of them,\" he warned. \"Three?\" Talia was surprised, thinking for a few seconds before deciding, \"We retreat.\" \"Why?\" Tusk asked. \"The compound is expandable. We have more urgent matters to attend to,\" she explained, turning to Tetch and Kuttler, \"Come.\" They exited the basement. Damian started to free himself and so did Daphne. She cut the ropes with her hairpin. It was made for cutting and for picking locks. She untied the ones around her feet. She stood up. She rushed to help Damian after putting on her mask. \"I'm fine…\" he muttered to her, putting on his mask. She nodded. They freed his father from the hold. They heard explosions from outside. Damian rushed to his father's side. Bruce's eyes were open for a few minutes. \"It's me! It's your son,\" Damian said, trying to help Bruce to stand up, \"Come on, father.\" He fell right after he stood up. Damian slapped him once, calling him Batman and saying that they need Batman. He slapped the man again. Daphne wanted to stop him but it was the only way to try and wake him up. Bruce held Damian's hand before he could slap again. He was conscious. He stood up with Damian's help. \"I'll help,\" Daphne insisted. Damian turned to her. \"No. I'll manage. Find the exit,\" he ordered. Daphne nodded. She rushed out of the basement before Damian and Bruce. She took the first stairs she saw and it was the right way. She heaved a sigh of relief. She rushed back down to call for Damian. Then, she went back up. Damian followed her voice and guided Bruce as he did. She caught sight of Dick. \"Master Dick!\" she called. Dick turned around and saw her. Damian and Bruce were right behind. He rushed to help the two. He told Daphne to go ahead. She obliged. She rushed out of the building. Before the three could do the same, the building collapsed, sending them off of the cliff. Batwoman rushed to help but was too late. \"No!\" she exclaimed. \"Master Damian!\" Daphne called tears in her eyes. Batwoman suddenly smiled. A man in another batsuit flew up with the three of them. He is Batwing. He placed them on the ground. Daphne abruptly went up to Damian, wrapping her arms around his torso. He wrapped one arm around her, hiding his surprise at her reaction. He was looking at his father, glad that he was safe. \"Thanks for saving our butts there, Luke,\" Dick said to the man that Daphne knew nothing of. \"Yeah. Too bad they got away,\" Luke replied and continued, \"Well, Dad always wanted me to work with Bruce Wayne. I'm proud to be a part of your team.\" Bruce spoke, \"We can handle this on our own. Nightwing, Robin, back to Gotham.\" \"You're welcome,\" Dick muttered. Damian stared at Daphne. She forced a smile to him. She knew that she wasn't important to Bruce anymore after she left him that one time. It was harsh but it is the truth. She pulled away from Robin. \"Can I ride with Batwing?\" she suddenly asked. \"Girl, I can't even navigate this very well yet. How do you expect me to hold you while I fly?\" Luke asked the girl. \"Any way you like…\" she hummed. Damian twitched at her words and clenched his fists. Batwoman smirked at his reaction. Daphne turned to her, smiling. \"Tell your sister I'm sorry for breaking her camera,\" she muttered, looking at Daphne. \"I will. Thanks for sharing the information about Heretic with me,\" the girl said, holding out her right hand. She shook hands with Batwoman. Since she came with Dick, she had to hitch a ride in the Batmobile as well. Daphne insisted on flying with Batwing. Luke gave in. He wrapped his left arm around her waist and she held on to it. He suddenly felt a cold stab on his back. It was Damian's jealousy. \"I'm flying!\" she cried happily as Batwing flew. \"Just don't let go,\" Luke reminded her. \"Okay…\" she replied, widening her eyes at the view. They soon arrived in Gotham City. Luke sent her to Wayne Manor as she had requested. She thanked him with a hug. She immediately went to her room after that. She assumed Alfred was checking up Bruce's condition. Damian and Dick would be beside him of course. As she walked to her room, she called her sister. \"Hey, Sis. Something wrong?\" Delphinium answered on the other line. \"We found Master Bruce…\" Daphne said and paused. \"And?\" her sister demanded. She rubbed her hair and replied, \"He seems fine but I think something is off.\" There was a pause before Delphinium asked, \"Are you extending you stay?\" \"Can I please? At least until the summit…\" Daphne begged. \"Oh, yeah. I was actually invited to go there. Wanna meet up there?\" \"I can't… Master Bruce doesn't seem to want me here, so I should keep my distance from him…\" \"Oh, I see. Well, if you get the chance to, say hello to him for me. I'll gladly go. It's a chance to see more techs,\" Delphinium laughed. Daphne chuckled and said, \"That is so you…\" She hung up after that. She reached her room and opened the door. She was surprised to see Damian, still in his uniform. He was sitting on her bed, legs crossed and arms crossed as well. He was staring at her. Was he angry? She wondered. \"Where have you been?\" he asked sternly. \"Sightseeing with Batwing,\" the girl replied calmly and happily. She went to her closet to get a nightgown. Damian went up to her. He grabbed her shoulders and forced her to face him. She was somewhat confused. \"I don't like you being around Grayson,\" he stated. \"I kind of know that…\" she replied, dumbfounded. \"So I don't like you around other guys as well,\" he continued. Daphne tilted her head to the side and asked, \"Like who? Alfred?\" Damian slapped his forehead. \"No… Fox! I don't like you being around Fox!\" he groaned, turning his back to her. \"Why? He is just an acquaintance…\" Daphne replied, taking off her mask and boots. Damian slammed himself onto her bed, grunting and groaning. Daphne was confused. Luke and Dick were like brothers to her. Nothing more. Why was Damian so furious? \"Hey…\" he suddenly called. \"Yes?\" she replied, going up to him. He sat up, suddenly pulling her into a hug. She stood still. \"Thanks…for calling my name…\" he said.[Chapter 17] C hapter 17: Daphne dragged herself to the kitchen the next day. Even though she didn't do much, she was still tired. Bruce, Damian, and Alfred were there, discussing things. They stopped when they saw her. She forced a smile and greeted them. \"Would you like something to eat, Miss?\" Alfred asked. Daphne nodded, replying, \"I'll get some myself. Thank you for asking.\" Bruce stood up from his chair. He exited the kitchen, not even taking a glimpse at the girl. Daphne sighed, turning to Damian. He didn't say anything and kept on munching on his pancake. Daphne poured some tea into her cup, taking a seat beside him. Alfred was facing his back towards them, busying himself with the dishes. \"How is he?\" she asked Damian. \"He is still recovering...\" Damian replied calmly, muttering, \"Don't take his reactions towards you too seriously...\" Daphne smiled. \"I never do. I am indebted to him for taking care of me after all.\" She went to the cabinet to get her cookie jar. She stood on her toes, struggling to reach for the jar. Her blouse was slightly flipped as she did. Damian faintly blushed when he saw a bit of her skin. Alfred finally grabbed it for her. A common problem for girls her height. She sat back down. She started to eat, pretending not to care about how Bruce had treated her. Damian glanced up at her every minute, wondering what to say. He wanted to give her the hairpin he had stolen but then again, he would like to keep it with him. Daphne didn't have the slightest idea that the boy took her hairpin after all. \"By the way, where is Master Dick?\" she asked. \"Grayson had some business to take care of with Kane and Fox,\" Damian replied. Daphne nodded, munching on her cookie. She decided to do some light stretches after that. Damian stayed in the kitchen with Alfred. Looking around the manor, Daphne found that no one was there, so she went to the Batcave with some drinks for everyone. Even though Bruce didn't acknowledge her presence at all, he didn't give any mean remarks of her. She seemed to be making Damian calm at some point. She assumed that she could stay. \"You really should be resting. The summit's tomorrow,\" she heard Dick said. \"It's been a week, I'm fine,\" Bruce replied. The girl went down the stairs to them. She handed a glass of juice for Dick and Damian. She stood beside Damian after that. Bruce was using his barbell. \"Like father, like son,\" Alfred remarked. Daphne giggled. Damian turned to Alfred. \"All things considered, Master Bruce, you're in surprisingly good condition,\" the butler said, looking at him. \"She treated you…treated us like we were machines that she could just program. That's all we were to her,\" Damian said, looking away sadly. Daphne held his arm. She gave out a small smile to him. He gazed into her eyes for mere seconds. \"After Bruce Wayne completes his hosting duty at the summit, we'll gather any leads we can to find her,\" Bruce spoke. \"Why wait? I'll call Kate and Luke and we'll…\" Dick's words were interrupted by the sound of the barbell being put in its place. Bruce stood up. \"No. You shouldn't have involved them in the first place.\" \"Batwing pretty much involved himself,\" Dick explained. \"And Batwoman? Did she force you to reveal our secrets?\" Bruce demanded, pointing at Daphne, \"Did you ask her to come back too?\" Damian reacted a bit from his father's words about Daphne. He glanced up at her. Daphne refrained from showing any reaction to not worry the boy. Deep down, she was scared of the sternness in Bruce's voice. To her, it suddenly sounded a little off than the usual Bruce Wayne. She really had doubts that he was fine. Dick glared but he didn't say a word. Alfred stood up for him, \"You weren't here, sir. Master Dick made a judgment call, and I think it was the right one.\" \"Maybe so, but from here on, it's only family,\" Bruce said, going to the stairs. \"Kate's going through the hard drive we pulled from the convent,\" Dick spoke up. \"Fine, but when she's done, that's it…\" he replied. \"But we have to…\" Dick was again cut off. \"You're not Batman anymore, Dick!\" Bruce shouted, glaring, \"I call the shots around here.\" He walked up the stairs and to the manor after that. Daphne pulled at Dick's arm. She was worried and he could see that. Damian finished his drinks and sighed. \"He's been through an extraordinary ordeal, Master Dick,\" Alfred said. \"Yeah? So have we,\" Dick replied. \"I'm really worried about him…\" Daphne spoke up. Damian turned to her. \"He's fine,\" he insisted and she nodded to his words. \"I'm going to bed...\" she announced, taking the two empty glasses with her. Delphinium sat on a chair that has her name labeled at the back. She sighed, observing the earpiece in her hand. The man in front of her said that she should put it on, but she ignored him. Bannister came up the stage and gave a little speech. Delphinium observed her surroundings. Something was off in the atmosphere. She excused herself, saying that she needed to go to the bathroom. She took the earpiece with her. She tried calling her sister. At that time, Daphne was out as Phoenix, along with Nightwing and Robin. They were meeting up with Batwoman and Batwing. Batwoman was telling them how her father attacked her just now. \"Dad doesn't even remember doing it. He was programmed,\" she stressed out. Damian and Dick turned to look at each other. Daphne glanced up at Damian. \"But why?\" the boy demanded. \"Somehow, they knew I had that drive,\" Batwoman explained. \"Just like how they knew about the vault at Wayne Enterprises. Bruce told them,\" Dick muttered. \"Not my father,\" Damian said sternly. Batwoman said, \"Talia had him in there for weeks, and he suddenly snaps out of it just because we show up?\" Damian stood up and replied, \"No, you're wrong. He's fine.\" Daphne pulled at his arm. \"He's not actually fine. Please, listen to them first, Master Damian…\" He gazed at her, thinking. Daphne bit her lower lip, tightening her hold on his arm. \"She got to him…\" Dick said, looking at Damian. Damian locked his gaze with Dick's. \"She's not finished, is she?\" \"She's just getting started,\" Batwing appeared. He opened up a screen with a list of names, saying \"Found this on the hard drive.\" Dick and Daphne ran through the names. Dick said, \"There are vice-presidents on this list. Military and corporate leaders…\" Daphne pointed to a name or two, saying, \"They're the vice-chancellors from some country… Delphinium's name is on it too!\" She jumped a bit, panic was in her tone. Damian held her shoulder to calm her. They kept on discussing. \"So why would Talia have this?\" Batwing asked. \"What if Talia got to the men and women on that list, brainwashed them?\" Dick suggested. Batwing answered, \"Then, that would place the League of Shadows' influence in every country.\" \"She'd control the world,\" Batwoman said, turning to Damian, \"Oh my God, kid. Your mom's got game.\" \"The leaders are all at the summit, right?\" Daphne asked Dick. \"Yes…along with Bruce Wayne…\" Dick muttered. Daphne's phone vibrated. All eyes were on her. She gave out a guilty grin and answered the call. Dick stood up for her, explaining that she would take her phone anywhere she goes in case Delphinium has an emergency. \"Hello…\" she muttered. \"Daphne! This place is a mess. Everyone is like hypnotized or something,\" Delphinium whispered. \"Where are you?\" Daphne asked, worried. \"In the toilet. Everyone who wears the earpiece is like in some kind of their own zone or something. The blue light on it suddenly turned red. I didn't wear it because I was fidgeting with it,\" the older sister explained. \"We're on our way there. See if you could find anyone who's not wearing it too…\" the Phoenix said. \"Hey, can I use that ?\" Delphinium requested. Daphne sighed. \"Fine…but don't kill anybody. Find the source of the hypnotizing…that should be in the control room…\" She hung up. She turned back to them. \"My sister is there and she told me that anyone who wears the earpiece given would be brainwashed. They're just about to start. Ummm…so, can I come too?\" All eyes turned to Damian, telling him that he should be the one calling the shots on her. Daphne turned to Damian too. The sight of her in the basement with him a week ago flashed into his mind. He put his hands on her shoulders. \"I want you to stay here…\" he said to her. \"But, my sister is there!\" Daphne insisted on going. \"She's Delphinium, she'll be fine,\" Damian said. The girl asked, \"Why won't you let me come?\" \"Because I don't want anything to happen to you,\" the boy half shouted. Daphne was stunned. She tried to look at Damian in his eyes. She could see that he was worried about Bruce. She didn't want to cause him trouble, so she backed away from them. She slowly nodded to his words. Dick decided that they should take the Batwing. Damian and Batwoman nodded. Daphne held the boy's hand. \"Please, be careful,\" she said, looking at him. Damian turned to her. \"I will,\" he replied. They left her on the roof. She stared up at the sky, thinking hard. Suddenly, her phone rang. Mana had called her to inform that she and Tiara had readied a transportation for her to head to the summit. \"We're on our way to pick you up, Miss,\" the maid continued. \"Miss Delphinium had asked us to do this…\" Tiara explained. Soon, a helicopter came by the building she was on. She smiled to her two maids, waving towards them. They got the ladder for her to climb up. She boarded the helicopter. \"Thank you very much. Let's get going. The others are on their way,\" Daphne answered. Delphinium hummed as she roamed the corridor at the summit alone. All of the guards were also wearing the earpiece, so they cannot notice her presence at all. She was liking it. She went back to her seat to see the large screen behind the stage showing a man wearing a hat. She caught sight of Alfred not far from the stage. She rushed up to him. \"Alfred, you're alright!\" she exclaimed. \"Miss Delphinium? You're here?\" Alfred muttered, getting up. \"Yes. I was invited by Mr. Wayne,\" Delphinium explained. Alfred observed his surroundings. \"Come, Miss. Let us go to the control room,\" he said to Delphinium. The girl nodded. She flipped her hair before tying it up with her hairband. Then, she followed Alfred. She told him that they had to move quietly and cautiously because surveillance cameras were put everywhere. Alfred was amazed at her intelligence. Meanwhile, Robin, Nightwing, Batwoman and Batwing had successfully entered the place. They were on their way to find the people but Batwing was taken by surprise by the enemy. Talia and Tusk made an appearance. \"We don't have time for this, Damian,\" Talia said, \"Join us or die.\" As she said that, Batman appeared beside her. \"Father,\" Damian muttered. Talia smirked as Batman jumped to attack them. Nightwing dodged. Batman kicked Batwoman. She fell into Tusk's holds. Damian targeted Tusk. Nightwing decided to fight Batman which leaves Talia with Batwoman. Daphne soon arrived at the scene. She told Mana and Tiara to find the dignitaries and see if they were okay. The two nodded. The orange haired started running around, searching for Damian. She got to the fighting scene. \"Master Damian…\" she gasped, widening her eyes when she saw him fighting Tusk. As that was happening, Delphinium was busying herself searching for the best route to get to the control room with Alfred. They got there in less than ten minutes. It was almost the end of the brainwashing. \"About time you get back,\" Kuttler muttered, thinking that it was Tusk or maybe Talia. Alfred clicked at his gun and said, \"Indeed.\" He approached Kuttler. Delphinium looked around for something she could do to shut the system down. Alfred threatened to shoot Kuttler. The man punched him and the gun fell to the floor. Delphinium butted in and kicked his chin. \"Allow me, Miss...\" Alfred said and got into position to punch Kuttler. The twelve-year-old was amazed. Kuttler took out a knife but Alfred was good at dodging his stab. The butler punched him a few times. He landed on the controls behind him. His hands caused the system to explode…along with Tecth's head. \"Bloody hell…\" he muttered, turning to Delphinium. \"That ought to put an end to this for good. Let's go see the dignitaries…\" the girl said calmly. \"You are nothing like your sister…\" Alfred remarked. Looking down, she replied, \"I didn't ask for it… I just... It doesn't matter. Let's just go!\" She clenched her fists. At the same time, Damian was again smashed onto the floor by Tusk. Daphne gritted her teeth angrily. She charged in to help. Damian shocked that she was in front of him, froze. She kicked Tusk in his jaw. He toppled backward. She swiped his legs to make him fall. He reacted fast and got up immediately. He grabbed her face, just like how he grabbed Damian's just now. He threw her towards the boy. Damian caught her. She was a bit dizzy. Tusk ran up to them. Damian and Daphne jumped out of the way. He slipped, causing him to fall. \"No!\" Damian said, throwing a batarang attached with a rope. The batarang wrapped around his leg. Daphne helped him pull the man up. She heard him muttered, \"Justice, not vengeance.\" She glanced up at him and smiled. They failed to save Tusk. \"Damn,\" he said, snapping at Daphne, \"Why are you here?\" \"My maids got me here,\" she replied. Batwing called Robin through their communicator. Daphne tilted her head in confusion as he stared. \"Follow me,\" he said, pulling at her hand and urging her to go with him. They came to one of the thrusters' fuel room. Daphne watched as Damian fiddled on it to transfer its powers to the other two thrusters. After that, he turned to her. \"Stay here and stay out of trouble,\" he said. \"But, I have to find…\" her words were interrupted. Damian said sternly, \"No. Stay here.\" Daphne sighed. She nodded. She stood there and watched him disappear out of her sight. She looked at the hand he had just held. She knew he cared for her. \"Please, be safe…\" she muttered. \"He really has his way with you,\" a familiar voice was heard. Daphne turned around to see her sister. She rushed to hug her. Delphinium rubbed her head. Daphne was trembling as she hugged her. Her sister held her shoulders and forced her to face her. \"Listen, you have to follow Damian,\" she said. \"Why?\" Daphne asked. \"You just have to,\" the sister said. Daphne gazed into her sister's eyes. She obliged. She got out of the control room and headed straight to where she thought she could find him. She did find him, but when she got there, they were cornering Talia. Batman, Nightwing, Robin, Batwoman and Batwing. She stopped by the stairs to watch. \"It's over, mother,\" Damian said. \"Your grand plan has ended,\" Bruce stood up. \"How is it that I ever loved either of you?\" Talia questioned. Bruce replied, \"I don't think you ever did.\" \"Oh, beloved, you have no idea,\" she scowled, \"I have thought of little else for the last twelve years, but nothing. Not my passion, not the death of my father, not even our child could bring you to my side.\" Daphne walked up to Damian. She slipped her right hand in his left one. He glanced up at her. Talia continued, \"I know now, I will never have you in this life. Perhaps in death.\" She took out a bomb. \"Get her!\" Batwoman shouted. They rushed up to her. She ran towards the glass window, threw her bomb and jumped off. An airship was already waiting for her underneath. \"She played us again,\" Dick said. They stared at the airship. It suddenly fell into the ocean and blew up. Daphne widened her eyes. She looked away. Damian placed left hand on her head as comfort. Bruce placed his hand on his son's right shoulder. The girl glanced up at Damian. Daphne placed the clothes and things she had brought into the bag. Staring down at it, she zipped it once she was ready. She sat on her bed, looking around. \"I will definitely miss this place,\" she muttered, sighing. She took her bag and went to find Alfred. She found him in a room full of books. He was staring at something towards the glass window. Dick was there too. \"One can't help feeling bad. Despite her madness, she was his mother,\" she heard Alfred said. She went up to them to look too. Dick was the first to notice the bag she was holding. He asked, \"Going back so soon?\" Daphne turned to him, forcing a smile. \"Yes…I have some things to settle before going back to school.\" \"At least, stay for another night, Miss. I'm sure Master Damian and Master Bruce would like that,\" Alfred persuaded her. The girl held the bag tighter, saying, \"Thank you, Alfred, but I have to go home. I might feel attached to this place again.\" \"You should be. It used to be your home once,\" Dick remarked. She forced a small smile and shook her head. \"I have to go. Send my regards to them,\" she sighed. She left the two, frozen at their places. She exited the manor and found that Delphinium was already waiting for her at the front gate. Tiara and Mana were there too. She smiled at her little sister. \"You didn't say goodbye to him?\" she asked Daphne. \"I don't think I should…\" Daphne sighed. She got into the car. Tiara drove it away. Daphne touched her Phoenix hairpin. She looked out at the sky, thinking about Damian. Back at the manor, Damian was still devastated by his mother's death. He didn't feel like eating at all the whole day. He was at the counter in the kitchen, staring down at his food. \"Where's she?\" he asked Alfred. Alfred stopped doing the dishes. \"She…went back home, Master Damian,\" he muttered. \"Without saying goodbye to me?\" Damian questioned. \"Yes. She thinks that it is unnecessary, but I think she is just not ready to tell you anything,\" the butler explained. Damian nodded, staring back at his food. He started eating his dinner, thinking hard about what he could do to see her again. He was a bit angry at her attitude, but also, a bit sad that she just left him that way. He had been a little too affectionate towards her. Did that scare her or something? Though, he still has a lot to say to her but didn't get the chance to. And thatis how I end the third movie. Off to anotehr time interval. :)[Chapter 18] So I decided to use my country's education system for Daphne's school. Sad that she quit elementary school, but here's her high school. :) I added a little part about Delphinium at the end. A start of a new mystery~~ Enjoy! and have a day! Chapter 18: Daphne combed her hair and tied it into pigtails. Her choice of clothing was a t-shirt and a pair of skinny jeans. She put on her favorite sweater. She got everything ready inside her sling bag. Once she was certain, she got down to have her breakfast. Tiara, Mana, and her sister smiled at her. \"Your first day of high school…\" Delphinium uttered as the girl sat down beside her. \"Yeah… I actually can't wait to learn simple stuff. Learning about other companies is hard…\" Daphne replied, laughing. The three laughed too. They ate their food. Delphinium looked through the mails that Mana had gotten for her. One of them caught her attention. \"Hmmm?\" she hummed. \"What's up?\" her sister asked. \"I've got an invitation…\" Delphinium replied, looking at the invitation, \"From Bruce Wayne…\" \"What about?\" Daphne asked, munching on her pancake. Delphinium read it out loud, \"It's a Welcome Home Party for Damian. It says that they are happy to announce the new addition to the family and also, it is to express their deepest apologies about the World Tech summit…\" Daphne muttered, \"I see…\" \"I think I should go, but if you don't want to go, I'll go alone,\" Delphinium said to her sister. \"I'll think about it,\" her younger sister smiled. Delphinium nodded. She placed the invitation into her handbag. After breakfast, Daphne took her bike to school like always. Delphinium would take the cab to the office. She was in class 1-B that year. She greeted the guard. She noticed some familiar faces but ignored them. She headed straight to her class. Sitting down on her chosen seat, she sighed. The blonde girl who sat in front of her turned around, smiling at her. \"Can I help you?\" she asked. \"I've been meaning to talk to you! My name's Shirley. We were in the same class before you quit school,\" she explained to Daphne. Daphne gave out a nervous grin. \"Shouldn't you be talking to the other girls? I mean, I'm not even popular…\" she asked. Shirley shook her head, explaining, \"Nope. I've been watching you all this time and really want to be your friend. You seem easier to be approached than them. They judge people too much.\" \"I see that…\" Daphne replied. The teacher for the first period came in before they could continue their conversation. Shirley flashed out a smile at Daphne before proceeding to turn around. \"Hello, girls and boys. I will be your class teacher for the whole year. My name is Miss Briana,\" the scarlet haired woman said, smiling, \"Well, we have a new student joining us at the very last minute.\" She turned towards the door. All of the kids did the same thing, except Daphne who was not really interested in such occasion. It would be a great opportunity for her bullies to create stories about her and make the new kid hate her before she could even talk to him or her. The new student stepped into the class. The girls and boys started to whisper. \"Well, this is Damian Wayne,\" Miss Briana said. Upon hearing the name, the orange haired girl quickly looked up. It was truly him, with his black turtleneck shirt and dark blue pants. The scowl was real at the very least. Daphne rubbed her eyes a few times to make sure it was Damian. Damian spoke, \"My name is Damian Wayne and as the name states, I am Bruce Wayne's son. I come from another country and father decided to take me in after getting to know me.\" \"That is nice, Damian,\" Miss Briana nodded to him, she schemed through the classroom, \"Hmm…There are two empty seats.\" \"I'm sorry I'm late!\" a voice was heard. All eyes turned to the door. A brown haired boy stood there, catching his breath. He smiled guiltily towards the teacher. \"It is okay. You may take a seat,\" the teacher smiled to him, turning to Damian, \"You too, Damian.\" Damian stared straight at Daphne. The brown haired took the seat beside Daphne. She heaved a sigh of relief, glad that it wasn't Damian. As he walked, some girls and boys whispered bad things about Daphne. He ignored them. He raised a brow towards Daphne who flashed a small smile at him. She looked away after that. Damian sat down beside Shirley. \"Now, why don't we start with an introduction? I would like each and every one of you to stand up, tell us your name and which elementary school did come from before. You may add any other detail. Let's start with you,\" Miss Briana gestured towards the student who were sitting at the front and the far most corner. Each student stood up and told what she asked. Some students added about what their parents do for a living. There was a total of 30 students. The brown haired boy stood up when it was his turn. \"Hi, everyone! The name's Max Jefferson. I was from Gotham Elementary. My family runs a restaurant around this part of town. Feel free to go and try out finest steak,\" he said. He sat down after that. Since Daphne picked the last seat, she would be the last to introduce herself. When she stood up, all eyes were stabbing her. Max smiled at the girl, ensuring that it was going to be fine and Shirley did the same. \"Umm…hi. My name is Daphne. I won't mention my elementary school because I quit before I could finish up,\" Daphne explained. \"What do your parents do, Daphne?\" Miss Briana asked, smiling sweetly. \"Umm…they died two years ago, but my sister is taking over our company. We own a pharmaceutical company…\" the girl replied, playing with her hand. \"I see. Thank you, Daphne,\" the teacher said. After that, most of the teachers that came in only asked them to do the same thing. They had most of the time free since it was only the first day. Daphne busied herself with a book and Max was writing something. Damian was surrounded by girls and boys who wanted to get to know him. Shirley was irritated by it. \"So, what is it like living with Bruce Wayne?\" a boy asked. \"Have you ever gone to his office?\" a girl asked. \"What do you like to do during your free time?\" another girl asked. \"Do you like video games?\" a boy asked. \"He doesn't look like that type, Tom,\" a girl said and laughed at Tom's question. \"I guess…he looks smart,\" Tom, the one asking about video games, replied and scratched his head. Damian raised a brow. \"Excuse me for a second,\" he muttered. Everyone paused. He stood up and turned to Daphne who was busy reading a story book. Max glanced up at the girl and then, stared at Damian. The boy practically ignored him, waiting for Daphne to respond. She could feel people glaring. She glanced up at Damian. He was looking at her. She closed her book and sighed. \"Do you…need something?\" she asked him. \"Show me around the school. I assume it's almost recessed time,\" Damian requested. \"I can show you around school!\" a different girl exclaimed. \"Me too!\" the one beside her, also a girl, said. Damian titled his head a bit. Max and Shirley stared at the two back and forth. They turned to each other. Daphne blinked a few times before giving in. She stood up and grabbed some books. \"What are those for?\" Damian asked. \"Since I'm showing you around, I can stop by at the library. I want to donate these books,\" Daphne explained. Damian counted the books: five. He said, \"Let me carry them.\" The orange haired turned to him, shook her head and replied, \"I'll carry them myself, but thanks anyway, Mas…I mean, thanks. Just thanks…\" She gestured to the door. Damian went ahead and waited for her there. Some girls were glaring at her and some were whispering. There were 18 girls in her class, excluding her and only one was not glaring at her. Max and Shirley started talking to each other. They had mischievous smirks on their faces. \"Are they always like that?\" Damian asked as they walked. \"Maybe…I don't really know. This is my first day here. Maybe you're just too good looking,\" Daphne said bluntly. \"You think I'm good looking?\" the black haired asked. The girl turned to look at him. \"Good figure, strong arms, an exact same face as the young Bruce Wayne… Who wouldn't?\" she replied calmly. Damian stopped and blurted, \"You don't see anything wrong about what you just said?\" \"Not really…\" the girl said. She gestured to her right and said, \"This hall has three Science Labs and a Computer Lab. Across the hall are other classes.\" They kept on walking. Daphne didn't do her job half-heartedly but it just seemed that way because she was still shocked to see him. \"Well, we're at the library now. Do you want to look inside?\" she asked him. Damian nodded. He walked in with her. The librarian recognized Daphne because she visited the school a week before. The girl placed the books she would like to donate. She introduced Damian to the librarian as well. Then, she went to put the books on their shelves. \"So, how did you convince Master Bruce to let you enroll here?\" she asked as she placed the first book. They went further into the library. Damian handed Daphne the second book. He held on to the other three. \"Well…I only said I need to talk to you. It was Pennyworth's idea…\" Damian said, thinking for a moment before shaking his head. Curious, Daphne raised a brow. \"Is there more to the story?\" The boy shook his head. He helped her with the third book since she couldn't reach the shelf. Some girls in the library were watching them, but they didn't care as much as her classmates did. Daphne led Damian to a section of the shelf that she thought he would love. \"So, they just let you enroll here? Did you choose that class because you know I am in it?\" she asked as they exited the library. The boy rapidly shook his head. \"It was just a coincidence.\" She brought him to the cafeteria and outside of it which was the yard where the kids hang out with their friends. She stared. \"I don't like coming out here. It's an exception today. I have to show every part of the school to you,\" she explained, wrapping her arms around herself. \"Are you…\" before Damian could ask anything, Daphne's phone rang. She answered as it was her sister. \"Yo, Sis? Can you come over to the office after this?\" \"Sure. What's up?\" Daphne asked. \"Well, some of these people from a company wanted to speak to you instead… Can you at least convince them that we mean well?\" Delphinium requested. \"I will…as soon as I'm done showing Master Damian around…\" the girl muttered. There was a pause before her sister asked, \"Damian is there? Can I talk to him?\" Daphne handed the phone to him. \"My sister,\" was all she said. He took it without asking anything. As he spoke, Daphne waited beside him. He told her that it would take a while. She decided to go to the toilet. She told him to stay in the yard and he nodded. \"So why is it important that she doesn't hear us?\" he asked Delphinium. \"Why are you at her school?\" Delphinium asked. \"I'm a student here as of today. It was Pennyworth's idea,\" Damian sighed. \"Hmm…tell me more,\" the girl demanded. \"He said I could keep an eye on her while I'm at it. Is she always bullied?\" Damian asked. \"Yes, most of the time…even at our old school…\" he heard her sigh. Damian suddenly heard a loud thud. He hung up and followed the sound. He caught sight of Daphne, cornered to the lockers and surrounded by three girls. He identified them and knew that they were from the same class as him and Daphne. \"Why is he sticking to you?\" the one in the middle asked. \"You're not even welcomed here,\" the one to her right said. Standing up, the girl brushed off the dust on her clothes. She turned to them and said, \"It just happens because I was sitting behind him. I'm just showing him around as a fellow classmate.\" \"I see… Then, I'm expecting to see you far away from him starting tomorrow or you know what'll happen…\" the middle one said. They left her there. Daphne sighed, looking down. Damian came up to her to give her phone back. She placed them inside her pocket. They went back to class without a word. Damian took his seat. In an instant, he was again surrounded by the people who wished to get to know him. Shirley turned around to speak with Daphne. \"Did you show him the whole school?\" Shirley asked. \"No. I haven't shown him the fields yet and also the court…\" Daphne sighed. \"I'll take it from here. The girls seem to hate you,\" Max spoke up. Daphne turned to him and then, to Shirley. \"Why are you guys being nice to me?\" she asked \"Well, I've been meaning to be your friend…and Max here is my best friend,\" the blonde explained. \"I see…\" Daphne muttered, smiling, \"Thanks, you two.\" They started talking about their family's business after that. Shirley is the daughter of a tech company that is globally successful. She showed them her cell phone which came from her own company. Max said that if they ever come to his restaurant, he would give them some discounts. They started to laugh at Max's jokes after that. Meanwhile, Damian's ears were twitching as he heard Daphne's innocent laugh. He was jealous. School ended early that day, and Daphne was glad. She picked up her books. Then, she hurried to her bike to get to the office. Once she was there, the workers greeted her and told her where to find Delphinium. Her sister was having her lunch in Daphne's office. She jumped at her little sister when she saw her. \"Thank goodness you're here!\" she screamed happily. \"Where are the people exactly?\" Daphne asked. \"They'll be back soon. Have you eaten?\" Delphinium asked. \"No…I couldn't eat. Too much on my mind,\" the younger Aldrin replied. Delphinium nodded. She went back to eating her food. Daphne sat on the chair in front of her desk. She stared at her phone as she waited for her sister to finish her lunch. Delphinium knew something was up. \"What's wrong? Anything happened at school?\" she asked. Sighing, Daphne replied, \"Yeah… The girls hate me because Master Damian keeps on bugging me…\" \"He must be the most popular boy in your grade now,\" Delphinium remarked. \"Yes, he is,\" Daphne groaned. The people they were waiting for had gathered in the meeting room. Delphinium accompanied her sister. She left her there. Meanwhile, back at the Wayne Manor, Damian was having lunch with his father. Silence filled their surroundings. Bruce knew that Damian had something to say, but he didn't want to ask. He could guess that it was about Daphne. He did take a few glances at his son as he ate, though. Alfred came to refill their drinks. \"How was school, Master Damian?\" he asked the boy. Damian swallowed his food and stared. \"It was okay. I'm in her class.\" Bruce looked up at him. The boy didn't say anything else. \"Was she okay with it?\" he decided to ask. \"We didn't get to talk much…\" Damian replied. \"How is she, young sir?\" Alfred asked, concerned. The boy replied, \"Still bullied…but she has friends, two at the very least. They seem to make her laugh.\" \"That's good then. Did you tell her about the party?\" Bruce asked, chewing on his food. He shook his head. \"She didn't expect to see me, so I didn't ask much.\" \"I hope she and her sister could make it. I have some things to discuss with Delphinium,\" Bruce muttered. \"Indeed, sir. I miss the little girl a lot,\" Alfred spoke up. Delphinium didn't go home until it was late that night. She wasn't scared because she was used to it. After all, she was trained by Deathstroke. However, that night, she felt like someone was watching her. \"Show yourself!\" she demanded, but now reply came. She hurried her pace to a bus stop, hoping a cab would stop by. After a few minutes of waiting, she could feel eyes were one her. She called Tiara to pick her up in the family car. Once she was back, she rushed to her study. She switched on all of her screens, eyeing the ones that were place around her office building. Nothing. She couldn't get anything. She was expecting at least a shadow of the person watching her, but nothing. She sighed, sinking into her chair. \"What is going on…?\" she muttered.[Chapter 19] Chapter 19: \"Alright, today we're going to play dodgeball,\" the coach said. \"Oh, boy…\" Daphne groaned. \"Cool! I love dodgeball!\" Shirley exclaimed. Most of the students were not motivated to play but it was their coach's request. Damian was confused because he was not exposed to such sport. \"What's a dodgeball?\" he asked Max. \"It's easier to play than to explain. You'll get it in an instant,\" the brown haired replied. \"Hmm…\" the coach hummed as he looked at the students. The students looked at each other. The coach chose Damian and Tom as the leaders of different teams. He told them to pick their team members. \"Alright… I pick Cynthia,\" Tom started. Damian glanced up at Tom before saying, \"Daphne.\" Daphne mentally groaned. She went to his side. Tom picked his next member. Max and Shirley were picked by Damian. They explained to him what they know about dodgeball. The boy listened and nodded to each explanation. The game started and Daphne was to run and get the ball. Tom's team started to throw the balls. Damian swiftly caught the one Tom threw. \"He's cool,\" Max muttered. \"He has good reflexes and sharp eyes,\" Daphne explained, understanding Damian, \"…and is a real hardhead.\" The orange haired jumped away from a ball which almost hit her. Shirley caught one but gave it to Damian to throw. Soon, only Daphne's three bullies remained. Daphne gave out a small smirk. She was going to enjoy throwing balls at them. Damian was holding a ball. He pondered before handing it to her. \"Do you want to finish them?\" he asked. \"Sure,\" Daphne said, taking the ball with a smile. She calmly threw at one of the girls. All three screamed and one was out. Shirley and Max stifled their laughs. In the end, Damian's team came out victorious. They do have Damian and Daphne on their team after all. Shirley was quite an athletic type too. \"That was a good game. Break!\" the coach said. Shirley and Max cornered Damian. \"That was awesome!\" they shouted. Damian took a glimpse at a shrugging Daphne. He turned back to her two friends. Shirley excused herself to catch up with Daphne who was walking up to a bench. Damian heaved a sigh. Max decided to ask, \"So, what's your deal with Daphne?\" The boy furrowed his brows. \"What do you mean?\" he asked. The brown haired laughed and shook his head. \"Never mind…\" Daphne packed her things as the bell rang. It was the end of school. She sighed, glad that she was able to get through another day with Damian as a classmate. He didn't get a chance to talk to her much since the other girls would bug him most of the time. \"Why are they so persistent…?\" Damian sighed angrily. Shirley chuckled. \"Because you're a Wayne I guess…\" she replied. He turned around to speak to Daphne but she was already heading to her bike. He didn't give up that day, so he rushed to catch up with her. \"I wonder why he is so into her…\" Max muttered. \"I don't know. Whenever I asked, he'd dodge the question,\" Shirley replied. \"She did the same thing. They have that in common,\" the brown haired said and they both laughed. Damian caught her figure at the front gate. He rushed to get her. He pulled at her arm before she could paddle away. She turned to him. \"I need to talk to you,\" he said. Daphne gave out a small smile. \"Okay… What is it?\" she asked. He was about to say something but Alfred had suddenly arrived. He mentally groaned, wishing that Alfred was a little bit late that day. Daphne smiled when Alfred lowered the window. \"Hello, Miss Daphne,\" he greeted her. \"Hello, Alfred. It has been a while,\" she replied. Alfred turned to Damian who was still standing beside the girl. He smiled at his action. \"Would you care to join us for dinner, Miss?\" he invited the girl. \"Hmmm? I guess I could, but I'll have to inform Delphinium first,\" Daphne gave in, oblivious that Alfred was actually helping Damian. \"That would be good. I miss cooking with you, Miss,\" Alfred muttered calmly. Daphne nodded and replied, \"I'll follow you two with my bike, okay?\" Alfred nodded. Damian got into the car. Daphne sent a text to her sister and a text to her maids. She started to paddle towards Wayne Manor. It was one more day before the party. Daphne hadn't decided whether to attend it or not. Having to paddle towards the manor made her think about the party. She abruptly sighed. They soon arrived at the manor. Daphne parked her bike beside the car. Alfred showed her to the kitchen. She happily followed him. Of course, Damian was watching. \"I will give you a chance to speak to her, Master Damian. Have dinner with her,\" he remembered what Alfred had said in the car. He sighed as he entered the manor. Daphne didn't have a change of clothing and the only one that she left at the manor was her maid uniform. She put that on since she didn't want to dirty her casual clothing. Alfred enjoyed her company. They cooked dinner together while Damian lied in his bed, thinking of the best way to tell Daphne how he feels. \"How is the company holding up?\" Alfred asked. \"Oh, it's actually pretty good. We have lots of shareholders and partners helping us out and teaching us. My sister is doing great,\" Daphne replied with a smile. Alfred nodded. \"I am glad then. Master Bruce has been wondering about the two of you after you left. He mentioned about visiting you,\" he said. Daphne wiped her hands after washing them. She said, \"He hasn't though…\" \"Soon I hope,\" the butler said. Daphne rushed to get the soup out of the pot and into the bowl. Alfred scooped up rice onto the plate. Damian entered the kitchen. The food was already on the counter but was not yet served at the dining table. He told them that his father would be on his way home. Alfred raised a brow at him. Damian sighed. \"Eat with us?\" he asked Daphne. Daphne blinked before giving a small nod. She went to serve everything on the dining table. They suddenly heard a car's lock and assumed it was Bruce Wayne. \"He has become a little bit obedient at times…\" Alfred made a remark about Damian. \"But is still a hardhead,\" Daphne complained, turning to Alfred, \"One time, he got into a fight with another boy from our class just because the boy caused his team to lose in a basketball match.\" Alfred chuckled. \"Sounded like him indeed.\" Daphne laughed. Bruce made an appearance to the kitchen. He smiled when he saw the girl. \"I thought I heard a familiar voice around here,\" he muttered. Daphne washed her hands, wiped them dry and rushed to hug her former caretaker. She jumped up to wrap her arms around Bruce's neck. Bruce patted her head lovingly and held her waist. She tightened her hug because she missed him so much. \"How have you been, Daphne?\" he asked. \"Good…\" was all she answered. \"Did you help Alfred cook?\" he asked, walking to the dining room with her. Daphne gave a nod. Damian rushed down the stairs to the dining room. He stopped when he saw Daphne talking with his father. He walked up to them. Bruce looked at him as he took a seat beside the man. \"We've been waiting for you,\" he said. \"Welcome back, father,\" Damian replied. Bruce patted his head, earning a scowl from him. They started to eat quietly after that. Damian did glance up at Daphne once in a while but that was all. He decided not to tell her anything yet, seeing how happy she was to have seen his father and Alfred that day. It was enough to satisfy him. After dinner, Daphne stayed to do the dishes and to help Damian with the homework. Bruce and Alfred listened in as they argue about calculations and science facts. Damian didn't want to listen to her at all, causing her to feel useless at some point. It was late when she decided to go home. \"Why don't you just stay here? I'll send you home first thing in the morning,\" Bruce offered. Daphne shook her head. \"Thank you for the offer, but I'd rather go home now. It's not midnight yet, even though it is way past my bedtime,\" she replied. \"If you say so. I'll follow you with my car,\" he insisted. \"That would be nice,\" she smiled. Delphinium, Tiara, and Mana watched as Daphne ran around the kitchen to make breakfast. Even though they have two maids, they decided to take turns cooking and doing chores. Their maids are more of companions than servants. It was Daphne's turn that day and she had forgotten all about it. Adding the fact that she got home late the night before, she overslept that day. Still, they like teasing her. \"It's okay, Sis. We'll cook,\" Delphinium suddenly spoke up. \"No. It's my turn. I'm almost done anyway. Eggs and bacon are good, right?\" she replied. \"Sure, Miss,\" Mana replied, getting nods from the other two. \"I'll go get my stuff ready for school now,\" she sighed, rushing up the stairs. \"She is so messed up today,\" Delphinium remarked. Tiara nodded. \"Regarding the party, has she decided yet?\" she asked. The older Aldrin sighed and shook her head. \"She didn't say a word about it. Mr. Wayne contacted two days ago, saying that he has something to discuss with us. So, I'm certain I'm going,\" she explained. \"I see. Shall we prepare your attire?\" Mana asked. \"Yeah, that'll be good. It is tonight after all… I have to come home early,\" Delphinium replied. \"Okay. Are you wearing a dress?\" Tiara asked. They caught sight of Daphne dashing out of the house. A smirk suddenly formed on Delphinium's face. She suddenly had an idea to tease Damian. \"On second thought, get my sister a dress instead. Bring them over to the office after lunch,\" she decided. Tiara and Mana looked at each other. They could definitely read the young Aldrin's smirk so they didn't ask any questions. Delphinium told them where to get Daphne a dress and some hair accessories. She told them to bring her makeup kit as well. The two nodded. Meanwhile, Daphne arrived at the school in the nick of time. The bell rang exactly when she parked her bike. Before she could reach her classroom, she bumped into Damian who happened to be reading the Science textbook. She stopped and he looked up at her. \"The bell just rang,\" she said. \"I know. I'm heading to class,\" Damian replied. Daphne nodded. They walked side by side but didn't say a word. When they got to the classroom, all eyes were on them. Damian and Daphne glanced up at each other before walking up to their seats. The teacher came in just as they were about to sit down. Daphne heaved a sigh. Max chuckled at her behavior. \"What's so funny?\" she asked. \"It's nothing. Did you talk to him?\" he changed the subject. \"No, he didn't say anything and I have nothing to say to him,\" she replied, taking out her textbook. The Math teacher started her class. Damian's mind wandered off like most of the time. He thought about what to say to Daphne at the party that night. Alfred had told him to invite her to come to the manor with them because there were some things to discuss beforehand. Meanwhile, despite being spied on a few days ago, Delphinium was having a nice day at work because her mind was filled with joy about the party. She had a lot planned for her sister and Damian. A visitor she was expecting suddenly came to her view. She told Arnold to let him in. \"Hello, Grayson,\" she flashed a smile. \"What's up?\" Dick asked, feeling awkward as he was talking to Daphne's sister. \"Are you going to the party tonight?\" she asked. \"Yeah, Bruce told me to come. Kate and Luke will be patrolling the city in our place,\" he explained. Delphinium nodded. \"I see…I need your help with something,\" she started to explain her plan. Daphne jotted down some notes from her Science teacher right after class. Shirley was already out of the classroom to wait for her driver. Max and Damian were discussing some things about their Science project. Daphne knew that the black-haired boy actually wanted to wait for her. The party would be held that night and Alfred had texted her that he wanted her to come. Dick and Bruce did the same thing. She was forced to agree to come. She had informed Delphinium that she would meet up with her at the manor. \"Hey,\" Damian suddenly called for her. \"Yes?\" she looked up at him. \"Alfred will be coming to pick us up,\" he stated. \"Thanks, but I'll take my bike. I'll meet you there,\" she replied politely. Damian gazed towards her before complying. Max exited the school before they did. Daphne waited for Alfred to come pick Damian up. Once the young Wayne got into the car, she started to paddle towards Wayne Manor. When they arrived, Damian got out of the car and went straight to his room. \"Why is he acting like that?\" Daphne asked Alfred. \"He must be nervous for tonight, Miss,\" Alfred remarked. Daphne nodded. They went to the kitchen together. She was surprised to see Delphinium and their two maids there. Her sister smiled at her. \"What are you doing here so early?\" she asked. Grinning, Delphinium replied, \"To get you ready for tonight.\" \"Uh, I'm going to be a maid tonight. Alfred said so,\" Daphne replied, confused. \"Yeah, I told him to tell you that,\" the older sister said, chuckling. Tiara and Mana urged Daphne to a room they had prepared to get her ready. Delphinium smiled at her sister. Alfred chuckled as he watched Daphne protesting the idea. \"You are very devious, Miss Delphinium,\" Alfred muttered. \"I like to call myself the matchmaker,\" Delphinium joked, chuckling, \"So, where is her maid uniform?\" Alfred gestured the girl towards the stairs. Delphinium understood. She made her way to her sister's room which was beside Damian's. The uniform was already neatly set on the bed. She put it on because she would be taking Daphne's place as the maid of the manor. She looked at her reflection in the mirror. She is only three inches taller than Damian while her sister is two feet shorter than Damian. The skirt was too revealing for her to wear. She smirked. \"It's not like anyone would be looking at me,\" she mumbled, exiting the room. As she was closing the door, Damian got out of his room. What she was wearing caught his attention. \"What are you wearing?\" he asked. Delphinium turned to him with her hands on her hip. \"What are you wearing? You're supposed to be ready by now.\" \"I want to have my tea first,\" he replied calmly, walking away. \"Then, I'll serve you,\" she said, catching up with him. \"Where's your sister?\" he asked. \"Busy. She has other tasks to take care of,\" Delphinium replied. Damian furrowed his brows. He kept on walking towards the kitchen with Delphinium by his side. She whistled as they walked. Alfred had already prepared some tea for the two of them. He briefed Delphinium about what she would be doing at the party. She nodded to every instruction. Damian just sat there, munching on some biscuits and listening too. Tiara made an appearance with a smile on her face. \"How is she?\" Delphinium asked. \"Still sulking, Miss,\" Tiara giggled. \"I'll go talk to her,\" she sighed, getting up from her seat. Mana bowed to her as she passed by. She entered the room where Daphne was told to stay in. The girl was sitting at the make-up mirror, staring at herself. \"Hey,\" she called. Daphne turned with a dissatisfied expression. \"Why?\" she asked, knowing that it was Delphinium's idea. \"I just thought it'll be fun,\" she joked, pulling on a stool. She settled it behind Daphne's chair and sat on it. She reached for the comb to start combing her sister's hair. Daphne sighed, shoulders slumped, lacking motivation. \"What's wrong?\" Delphinium asked. \"I just…I don't think I should be around him,\" Daphne confessed. Raising a brow, her sister asked, \"Why not?\" \"Sometimes he's angry, sometimes he's too affectionate and sometimes he is too full of himself! I don't get him…!\" she burst. Delphinium smiled, putting the comb away and working on Daphne's hair. \"Well, sometimes I'm irrational, sometimes I'm reckless, sometimes I get angry for no reason… You're still here with me,\" she said calmly. Daphne's hair was combed and tied into a crown braid. She looked a bit mature than her age. Delphinium worked on her face next, putting some faint blush and pink lipstick. Daphne played with her fingers. \"Will he notice me?\" she muttered. Delphinium placed a hand on her cheek and smiled. She nodded. Her sister forced a smile. \"You should take it off,\" she said, pointing at the hairpin. Daphne touched it and shook her head. \"No… It's a part of me. I want to wear it…\" she muttered. Her sister shrugged. \"Okay. Just come out when I come get you, okay?\" The younger Aldrin nodded. She sighed, looking at her reflection once again.[Chapter 20] Chapter 20: The party had just begun and Delphinium was happily serving what was on the tray she was holding. She was confident with her body, so she had no problem donning her sister's maid uniform. She went up to Alfred who was busy checking on the food. Turning towards where Damian was standing, she said, \"Well, he's being really quiet.\" \"Yes. It is Master Bruce's order after all,\" Alfred replied with a smile. \"I'm going to get my sister now. It's been fifteen minutes since the party started,\" Delphinium announced, handing her tray to Tiara who was with Alfred at the time. \"She is very unique,\" the butler remarked. \"Quite so. We took care of her since she was a baby, and yes, she is very odd…\" Tiara replied. Meanwhile, Damian was standing beside his father, greeting the guests. He was wearing a tuxedo, just like Bruce and he didn't like it one bit. For all he cared, the tuxedo is too warm, tight and constricted. He hated it but had to remain neutral. \"So, you are Damian Wayne. My, my, you look very similar to your father here,\" a man remarked. \"Yes, it is one of the reasons why he took me in,\" Damian explained. The man nodded. He went up to the buffet table after that. Damian gave out a scowl. \"What's wrong?\" Bruce asked. \"Nothing,\" Damian replied coldly. He took a deep breath and tried to remain calm. Bruce greeted some more important guests. Damian was interviewed yet again. \"Master Damian,\" he suddenly heard a familiar voice. He turned around to see Daphne in a dress. She looked nervous and embarrassed. Dick was beside her, a smiled plastered on his face. \"Let me guess…you switched places with your sister?\" he asked. \"It that a way to treat your guest?\" Dick joked. Damian shot a glare towards Dick who found it amusing. He stared back at Daphne who shrugged and smiled awkwardly. Her dress was a maroon slip dress and she wore a matching pair of maroon ankle-strap platforms. The dress went all the way down to her ankles. It made her look taller than usual. \"Delphinium has gone too far,\" Damian said. \"What? I approved it,\" Dick protested. \"I don't…\" the boy replied, sighing, \"But you look nice.\" Daphne brightened up a bit. \"T-Thanks…\" she muttered. Bruce was watching the whole time. \"Well, I'll excuse myself to go talk to Delphinium,\" he suddenly said. He pulled Dick to follow him. Dick went straight to Delphinium while Bruce talked with a couple of guests who were enjoying drinks and appetizers. Damian turned to Daphne. She raised her brows and smiled. \"I'm sorry. I think they planned this…\" she muttered, sighing, \"My sister can be…very weird at times.\" \"You mean all the time?\" he asked. \"Oh, my! You do look like the young Bruce Wayne!\" a woman exclaimed, smiling to Damian. They both quickly turned to look at the woman. \"Hello, Ma'am, Sir,\" Damian greeted with a bow, just how Bruce had thought him. Daphne nodded to her when she turned to look at the girl. She was with her husband. They turned back to Damian. \"What are you up to now?\" her husband asked. \"I've enrolled in a school. I must learn the basics before I could learn from father,\" he replied calmly. \"And who is this beautiful young lady beside you?\" the woman asked with a warm smile. \"I'm Daphne, he's…\" the girl glanced up at Damian. \"She's my acquaintance from school,\" he finished her sentence for her. \"My, she is one fine girl,\" the husband remarked. \"Thank you very much,\" Daphne bowed to them. They excused themselves when they caught sight of Bruce Wayne. Daphne stood beside Damian as more guests started to recognize Damian. He glanced up at her once in a while but she was never bothered whenever people ask who she was. \"You're wearing the hairpin?\" he suddenly asked, grabbing her attention. \"Oh, this?\" she touched it again, smiling, \"Yeah. It is a part of me after all. I want to hang on to it for the time being.\" \"You're not Phoenix anymore,\" he said coldly. Daphne sighed and nodded. \"I know…\" she replied. Another couple came to introduce themselves to Damian. Daphne slipped away when he was busy answering their questions. She went back to the room she was in before. She loosened her hair, sitting in bed. \"Why am I even trying to be a part of this…\" she muttered. The party ended late that night. Delphinium told her two maids to help Alfred with the cleanup. She went up to Damian who was already in his comfortable attire. \"Where's my sister?\" she asked. \"I don't know. Must've left already,\" Damian replied coldly. Delphinium groaned. \"I don't know why she even tries to be beside you!\" she half screamed. All eyes turned to her. She extended her right palm. Damian was confused. \"Hand over her hairpin. I know you took it,\" she said confidently. \"How do you even know that?\" he demanded. \"Just hand it over before I kick your butt,\" Delphinium huffed. Damian refused to do it. She was about to burst when Daphne suddenly came by in a nightdress. \"What's going on?\" she asked, rubbing her eyes. \"Sis, where have you been?\" Delphinium asked. \"Sleeping…\" the girl muttered. \"You should stay for the night,\" Bruce suddenly broke the silence. \"Sure, we'd love to,\" Delphinium replied, staring at her sleepy sister. A few hours later, Damian broke out to clear his mind. He went to the garden to do some light exercise. Daphne was taking a walk in the garden when he got there. They shared an awkward silence for ten minutes. \"Exercising again?\" Daphne asked. \"I can't sleep. I'm usually still out patrolling at times like this,\" Damian replied. \"I guess so. Can I watch?\" she asked. Staring blankly at her, he asked, \"You're not afraid of swords anymore?\" Daphne bit her lower lip. \"I can't say for sure. I did use a sword to help beat up those talons,\" she shrugged. \"Hah…I guess you can watch,\" he replied with a smirk. She watched him train. So much for light exercise. He was at it for thirty minutes before he decided to stop. \"It's still early,\" Daphne remarked. \"Tell me something…\" he suddenly spoke up. Daphne blinked and asked, \"What?\" \"What is Grayson to you?\" Damian asked. The girl laughed. \"That's a funny question. I guess I would say he is a loving brother,\" she replied calmly. \"What about Jefferson…?\" he asked. \"You mean, Max? He's a friend and he's your friend too,\" Daphne replied, sighing, \"I need to go back to bed. You're confusing me.\" \"Wait,\" Damian called. Daphne turned to look at him. He looked away for a brief moment before turning back to her. \"Take off that hairpin,\" he said. \"Why?\" she asked. He fished for something in his pocket and took it out. Daphne widened her eyes at what was in his hand. \"My hairpin,\" she muttered. \"I've been holding on to it for some time…\" he explained, shutting his eyes and opening it, \"As a closure…\" Snatching it from his hand, she ran away. Damian stood there. He sighed. Months went by after that encounter. Daphne refused to speak with Damian even at school. Shirley and Max were confused, but the other girls were happy about it. On Damian's birthday, his table was full of presents from the girls in their grade and from their seniors as well. He didn't like it but he took anyway. He was worried that they might blame Daphne if he didn't take it. The day went by as usual. \"Okay, I will now divide you into pairs for your Science presentation. Girls will be picking a card from this jar. Call out that name and the person will be your partner,\" the Science teacher explained. Shirley shrugged to Damian when it was her turn. She strolled to the front and picked a card. So squealed at the name. \"Max!\" she called out and then ran back to her seat. Daphne was the fifth person to pick a card. As luck would have it, her partner is Damian. She sighed. \"Damian…\" she muttered and people started to whisper again. She went back to her seat. Max patted her back as comfort. She flashed a small smile. It was the fall season already. Time went by so fast when you have a lot on your mind. She thought to herself. \"You'll be fine,\" Max reassured her. The school bell rang, signing the end of school for that day. Shirley and Max walked out of the class, discussing their presentation topic. A girl approached Daphne. \"Here we go…\" she mumbled. \"Switch with me. Damian would be better off with me than you,\" she demanded. Before Daphne could answer, Damian slammed his hand on her desk, shocking the two girls. The girl blinked innocently towards Damian while Daphne stared. \"I'm not switching. I'm her partner and I have a say in this,\" he said, grabbed Daphne's hand and pulled her out of the classroom. He stopped when they reached the school gate. Daphne stood and wait for Alfred with Damian. She wasn't planning anything. She just thought she should keep him company. \"Umm… Thanks for saving me just now,\" she muttered. Damian nodded. \"Hmmm…\" \"Do you…\" she hesitated, \"…want to do a discussion about our topic today?\" The boy glanced up at her. She was wearing her hairpin, not the Phoenix hairpin. Her hair had gotten longer, going down to her knees. She didn't tie it that day. He was captivated by her sudden beauty. \"If you want,\" he replied. \"I'll follow you with my bike then,\" Daphne said. They arrived at Wayne Manor. Damian invited her to his room, but she insisted on working with him in the library. Alfred brought them some tea and a plate of cookies. After a few hours of their discussion, they decided to take a rest. They decided to watch a movie. Alfred let them. \"So, what do you want to watch?\" Damian asked. \"Anything to get my mind off of cells and tissues,\" she joked. The boy didn't say anything. He was not used to jokes at all. Daphne sighed. He took a seat beside her on the sofa after plugging in a movie of his choice. It was a horror movie and boy, does Daphne hated it. She kept on jumping in her seat. Damian didn't do anything to comfort her. She wrapped her arms around her legs, bringing her knees to her chest. She hid her face in them. \"Are you scared?\" he suddenly asked. \"It's okay…just keep watching,\" she assured him. Damian bit his lower lip, feeling somewhat guilty for choosing such a movie. He snaked a hand around her shoulder, pulling her to him closer. Her head was rested on his chest. Daphne glanced up at Damian who was failing at hiding his blush. Confusion filled her mind. She didn't know how to respond to his sudden affection. They just froze in their seats. A little bit relationship development for my little Daphne. :) We'll be entering the fourth movie like this. Have a day![Chapter 21] I altered this one to fit the chronology of my story. This chapter has a little bit of explanation for Daphne's next weapons. Also, it has a cute DaphneXDamian moment in it. Read to find out. :) Have a day! Chapter 21: It was school day again and Damian was absent. Daphne didn't want to care but she pitied Shirley. She had to answer the questions shot at her from the other girls. Max was itching to ask too, but he didn't want to bother Daphne about it. \"Uh oh…\" Max suddenly muttered, tapping the girl's shoulder. Daphne turned to him. Her bullies were standing right in front of him. She sighed. \"Know where he is?\" they asked. \"The last time I saw him was last Friday, after the presentation,\" she replied calmly. Damian suddenly entered the class and strolled to his table. Silence filled the classroom as the audience focused on him. He was collecting his belongings. The students were all confused, even Daphne. The class teacher came in. Damian went up to her. \"Do you have everything?\" she asked. \"Yes,\" he replied, not even looking at her. \"Your father called me…and the Principal. He informed that you two are going away for a few days?\" she said. Damian turned to look at Daphne before replying, \"Yes. A family trip…\" Daphne was shocked to hear the news. Just as he had said that, her phone vibrated. Dick was calling her. She excused herself to answer the phone call. Miss Briana explained to the class why Damian was leaving. \"What did he do this time?\" Daphne asked Dick. \"Whoa…he didn't do anything. Batman was called…\" Dick replied, chuckling at her question. \"Called?\" the girl was confused. \"By the Justice League,\" he continued. Daphne hung up because the mentioned boy was right in front of her. She blinked and tilted her head a bit. Damian sighed. \"Father would love for you to come,\" he explained, glancing up at the students who were peering through the door and the windows, \"Come by after school. We're leaving tonight.\" \"I'll think about it…\" Daphne replied. Damian nodded. He walked away after that. Daphne looked down, sighed and then, entered the classroom. Miss Briana flashed a smile to her. \"What did he say?\" Max asked. \"He invited me to come with him. I need to discuss with my sister first,\" she explained. She did just that. Delphinium was not happy with the invitation but she knew her sister wanted to stick with Damian. \"It's just that Justice League is another news for me. I don't have much information about them. Who can I count on to watch over you?\" Delphinium groaned. \"I can take care of myself,\" she insisted. \"You barely know how to fight and you don't carry any weapons,\" the older sister reasoned. \"You've been teaching me a lot…and if it'll make you feel better, I'll take along a weapon of your choice,\" Daphne negotiated. Her sister was still in doubt. \"Are you sure?\" she asked. Daphne smiled and said, \"Yes. Pick me a weapon and I will take it with me.\" Stepping closer to her sister, Delphinium grinned, \"You're going to regret ever saying that.\" Daphne gulped. Delphinium stood in front of her wardrobe, she opened it and took out a large blue box. She opened it. Daphne widened her eyes at what was inside. Daphne took out the two kukris inside. She was sent to the Batcave when they were about to leave after that. \"How'd you know your way around?\" Dick asked Delphinium. Smirking, she replied, \"Intelligence.\" Daphne sighed and said, \"Just roll with it.\" Alfred came up to her with her uniform. \"We added a few upgrades based on Master Bruce's and Master Dick's ideas…and Miss Delphinium's insights,\" he explained. \"Oh…I'll put it on then,\" she replied, taking it from Alfred. She went to put it on. Delphinium discussed with Bruce about business while Damian listened in. Dick and Alfred just stood there to wait for the girl. She came back after a few minutes with a frown and busy fixing her shoulder holsters for her kukris. \"A cape? Really?\" she asked. Dick chuckled and explained, \"That cape is bullet-proof and it has a hoodie, almost like Robin's cape.\" \"We made it in red and orange to match your symbol,\" Bruce pitched in, \"I also added dark red metal gauntlets for you so you can protect yourself better.\" \"The utility belt is also the same as Robin's,\" Dick continued. \"At least, the outfit is still my design…\" she sighed. \"We added kneepads so that you'd have more protections,\" Alfred interrupted. \"Nice work, guys,\" Delphinium applauded. \"Wait…what about your insights?\" Daphne asked. Delphinium smiled and replied, \"I pitched in the design for the cape and the add-ons… Don't forget to check the belt.\" \"Well, let's get going,\" Bruce said, pulling on his mask. Damian put his mask on and so did Daphne. She jumped into the Batwing, squeezing herself at the back. \"Are you comfortable?\" Bruce asked her. \"I'll manage,\" she replied calmly. \"Are you sure? You can squeeze in with Damian,\" Bruce insisted. \"No thank you,\" she muttered. Damian crossed his arms in disagreement to Bruce's offer. He didn't like the idea of sharing his seat with her. She is a girl after all. \"So…\" Daphne started, \"Justice League?\" \"Yes. We're unveiling our new headquarters tonight,\" Bruce replied. \"We missed the information about you being in the Justice League,\" Daphne said. \"Did you know the other members?\" Bruce asked. \"Not really… We know Cyborg, but that's all…\" she muttered. \"Seems like you should do more studying,\" Damian remarked. Daphne rolled her eyes. She sighed at his behavior towards her. He was being mean again. They soon arrived at their destination. The other members were waiting for them: Superman, Wonder woman, Cyborg and the Flash. Shazam and Green Lantern couldn't make it. Daphne was nervous because she was standing in front of great heroes. Damian was acting almighty like always. \"Thanks for waiting. We have a late addition on my side,\" Bruce muttered, glancing up at Daphne. \"So, this is your son?\" Superman asked, looking at Damian. \"Yes. He's name is Damian,\" the Dark Knight replied. Wonder woman turned to look at Daphne with a smile. \"And who is this precious child?\" she asked. \"She's Daphne, Phoenix. She's a great information gatherer. She's been helping me a lot,\" Bruce explained, smiling proudly at Daphne. Daphne shook hands with all of the Justice League members. After that, they got ready for what was coming next. People soon started to gather around them as they stood in front of a building which happened to be the new headquarters for the Justice League. Every one of them stood there proudly as the audience clapped after the announcement was made. The head of the police department shook hands with Superman and Batman. Then, the heroes lined up for their pictures to be taken by the reporters. Daphne stood beside Bruce like how she would always do. Damian did the same, but he looked frustrated. Suddenly, an explosion was heard from behind them. The walls of their headquarters were torn opened. The Legion of Doom made their appearance. \"What are they doing here?\" Superman groaned. \"It's been a long time,\" one of the members of the villains said. \"Uh…I don't like this…\" Daphne muttered. They started to attack. The people were screaming as they ran away from the battlefield. A monstrous being with gray skin and torn black clothing charged at Batman. Damian pulled Daphne out of the way as Bruce defended himself. \"Robin, you're on crowd control!\" Bruce ordered. \"What? I want to fight!\" Damian protested. Bruce kicked the grey-skinned monster and turned to his son. \"You don't know these guys and their capabilities. Just listen to me!\" he said sternly. There was a pause before Damian replied, \"Fine.\" He rushed up a building nearby. Bruce turned to Daphne. She forced a smile and nodded. \"I'll watch over him,\" she muttered. \"Just make sure he's not doing anything reckless,\" Bruce reminded her. Daphne nodded. She rushed to catch up with Damian. He was atop a building close by, already making sure that the people escaped safety. However, his methods were not to her liking. She grunted and jumped up to his side. \"You shouldn't be throwing bombs at them!\" she said angrily. \"I make sure it didn't explode close to them. My timing is right,\" Damian replied coldly. \"Your approach is wrong!\" Daphne complained. She caught sight of a couple of people running. She jumped onto the ground before Damian could throw another bomb. She showed them the way. The boy just leaned onto the windows behind him, arms crossed, watching the girl as she urged them towards where she was pointing. After what seemed like forever, Damian landed beside her. \"I don't get it why I'm stuck watching over these people,\" he muttered. Daphne sighed. \"It is a part our job to make sure they're safe,\" she reminded him. He didn't get to reply because a loud explosion was heard from a building that was a few feet away from them. Superman crashed out of it and onto the streets. Damian pulled Daphne and rolled over, away from the crash. It ended up with her being awkwardly on top of Damian. He was looking away from her face. Her face was red in an instant. Superman stared. \"What the hell did he hit me with?\" Superman asked. \"Who?\" Daphne asked. \"Wizard. Apparently, he got strongly in less than ten minutes,\" the man replied, getting up. He turned to Daphne and Robin. They stared at each other. He flew off after that. Damian went off, leaving Daphne alone. \"Hey!\" she called. She turned to the sky to see a red circle forming, with someone in the middle, somewhat charging it. She assumed that was Wizard, but the magic was undefined to her as well. She knew she had to find Damian. Bruce contacted her as she searched for the said boy. \"Stop him from what he is about to do!\" he ordered. \"I can't seem to find him!\" she replied, jumping onto another roof. She caught sight of the Batwing. She gulped as she rushed over. Before she could get there, Damian took off. \"He can be so…!\" Daphne growled angrily. As she ran back to the ruined headquarters, an explosion was seen in the ocean. As smoke started to rise as the aftermath of the explosion, Wonder woman caught wizard with her lasso. Daphne got there just in time with Damian's parachute landing. She could see that Bruce didn't look happy. He glared at Damian. \"What? We got him, didn't we?\" the boy asked. Daphne stood beside Wonder woman as she tried to catch her breath. The woman saw a few bruises on the girl's skin. \"What we have is an empty shell with no answers,\" he gestured towards the Wizard and continued, \"If you would follow orders and done what you're told, we'd know more.\" Damian crossed his arms and looked away from his father. Superman backed him up. \"Come on, cut him some slack. At least, he was trying to…\" his words were cut off when he saw Bruce's glare. \"Not that I disagree…\" he muttered. \"Master Bruce…\" Daphne stepped in. \"It may have been my fault. I should've stopped him when I had the chance,\" she explained. Damian spoke up, \"You buried me into a worthless position to keep me out of the way…and you had her babysit me as well. Still, I solved the entire problem.\" \"This isn't about you. It's about teamwork,\" Bruce sternly replied. \"All I see is a lot of ineffectual grandstanding, which is why I prefer to work alone,\" Damian replied calmly. Cyborg scoffed. \"And my dad thinks I'm difficult,\" he muttered, getting a glare from Bruce. Flash asked, \"Have you ever considered boarding school?\" He got a glared from Bruce too. Cyborg and Flash turned to look at each other. Daphne sighed and shook her head. Bruce looked at his son. Damian gave out a scowl. \"He'd have a harder time in boarding school,\" she remarked. \"Daphne,\" Bruce called. She rushed up to him. \"Yes?\" \"I'm going to need you to handle some paperwork,\" he muttered. The girl sighed. \"I don't like where this is going…\" she replied, getting a stern look from Bruce.[Chapter 22] A one month and two weeks time skip here to make these two 14 years old for the fourth movie. Lame, but it's my story. hehe. Anyways, enjoy like always! :) Chapter 22: The first day of a new year, the first day of school. A knock on the Principal's door was heard early in the morning. Miss Briana was standing beside the Principal's table as a certain orange haired girl entered the room. She sat down in front of the Principal. \"I have received a call from Mr. Wayne…\" the Principal started. \"Yes. Umm…did he tells you the news?\" Daphne asked. The Principal nodded, glancing up at Miss Briana. The teacher spoke up, \"He mentioned about Damian's transfer.\" Daphne nodded. She took out two folders out of her bag: one was regarding Damian and the other was about her. The Principal and Miss Briana schemed through both. \"He'll be transferring to a boarding school in Kansas City? How did a family trip turn into this? It is already the start of a new school year,\" Miss Briana asked. \"He's Bruce Wayne…\" Daphne sighed, explaining, \"I was once Mr. Wayne's maid. I can understand why he's doing this. He did entrust to me anything that is related to Master Damian. Mr. Wayne thought that letting his son go off to a boarding school would help him be more dependent?\" \"More independent I would say…\" Miss Briana muttered. \"Hmmm…I guess we can't say no. What about you? Off to a business trip with your sister on the same date?\" the Principal asked. Daphne bit her lower lip, deciding to tell the truth. \"Well, only on paper. I'm going with Master Damian for a few weeks, one month for the most. Mr. Wayne's request.\" \"I see…so if anyone were to ask about you, we would say that you went on a business trip?\" Miss Briana asked, knowing Daphne's full situation. If they were to say that Daphne went off with Damian for a month, lots of people would be questioning why and saying that she is Damian's maid won't do any good. \"Yes, please…\"she pleaded. The Principal and Miss Briana nodded. She was dismissed after that. Daphne stepped into her classroom, looking down as ever. Shirley and Max watched as she sat down. She groaned, slamming her head on the desk. They both chuckled at her behavior. \"Tough night?\" Shirley asked. \"You look messed up,\" Max remarked. \"I am…\" Daphne sighed, sitting up and fixing her hair. The purple-haired stood up. \"I'll go get you something to drink.\" Daphne smiled. \"Thanks,\" she said. Shirley turned to her and asked, \"What happened last night?' The orange haired stared at the blonde. \"Can you keep a secret?\" she asked. \"If it's from you, I definitely can,\" Shirley replied confidently. \"Okay. I used to be…umm…Damian's maid,\" she started. Her friend was really shocked by the news. Daphne sighed. Max came back with a canned orange juice. Daphne smiled and took it from him. She kept on telling her stories to them, leaving the fact that Bruce Wayne is Batman and Damian Wayne is Robin. When she was about done, the two were gaping at her. \"So, now you're saying you have to move away for a while because he threw a tantrum last night?\" Shirley reconfirmed. \"Yes, something like that. I had to help Master Bruce sort out the paperwork for Master Damian,\" Daphne explained. \"So, he's dropping out of school?\" Max was next to ask. \"Yes. He's dropping out and transferring to a boarding school I guess… But, I think I'll just take a few weeks off,\" the girl explained. \"A few weeks? School has just started,\" Shirley reminded her. Daphne sighed. \"I know…but…\" she said, \"Master Bruce had been nice to me when I lost my parents. He paid my school fees and tuition fees. He even gave me allowance money before my sister took over the business and we started earning money again.\" Miss Briana entered the class with a sad face, taking a glimpse at Daphne. She placed her books on her table. Turning to the students, she flashed out a smile. \"Kids, I have breaking news,\" she started, \"Damian is dropping out of school to be enrolled in a boarding school of his father's choice.\" The class started talking and complaining. Daphne, Shirley and Max kept quiet because they already found out the news. \"And…Daphne will be going away for a few months for a business trip with her sister,\" Miss Briana continued. Then, she started class like usual. Daphne couldn't focus at all. She was still occupied with the fact that Damian would be sent away. Once school was over, Daphne was picked up by Bruce and Damian. Glares were shot towards her as she got into the car. She waved to Max and Shirley because she saw them walking home together. \"So, have the Titans replied yet?\" she asked, glancing up at a scowling Damian beside her. \"Yes, finally. They're happy to be receiving a new member,\" Bruce replied. \"Nightwing will be sending him there tomorrow morning.\" \"Are you coming?\" Damian spoke up. Daphne turned to him. \"Do you...\" she raised her brows, \"…want me to come along?\" \"I don't see why not. You've been following me all around the whole time,\" he mocked. Daphne took that a bit harsh. She took a deep breath before replying, \"If Master Bruce agrees, then I can go…\" \"Well, you did tell the school that you're going on a business trip. Might as well go, meet new friends,\" Bruce said to her. \"Are you sure?\" Daphne asked, in doubt. \"Ask Nightwing,\" the man replied. When they arrived at the manor, they were greeted by Alfred like always. He was happy to see Daphne. They all went inside. Daphne, like always, would hang around the kitchen. Damian would be in his room. \"Yes, Master Bruce was quite upset with his behavior. He didn't take Master Damian on patrols since then,\" Alfred sighed. \"Well, he is a kid, so sometimes he just acted like one,\" Daphne sighed. \"Are you…perhaps heading to Titan Tower with him?\" Alfred asked. \"I was asked to, but I need Master Dick's approval,\" the girl replied. After lunch, Damian packed his things to head to Titan Tower. Daphne did the same thing. The two of them didn't bring many clothes. Daphne wouldn't leave her phone, though. She was afraid that she needed her sister's assistance at times. After they were done, they went down to the Bat cave in their respective uniforms. \"I still don't like this cape…\" Daphne complained. \"You look fine,\" Dick said, smiling at her. They started to train. Daphne took out her kukris, swinging them around. She was used to them by that time. She had been training with Delphinium every day after receiving the weapons. They were actually created by Delphinium when she was under Deathstroke's care. The kukris were her finest work. She was glad that she got to give it to Daphne. \"Well, that's all for tonight,\" Dick said once the clock struck midnight. Daphne and Damian sheathed their weapons. She smiled at Dick as he patted her head. Damian was jealous of Dick's affection towards Daphne. She was approving them. Whenever he tried to do so, she would always reply with freezing herself in place or running away. After breakfast the next day, the three hopped into the Batmobile in their respective uniforms. Dick drove them to the tower since Bruce was with the Justice League, solving things out. As they drove off, Damian kept on staring out the window. Daphne hummed a tune while playing a game on her phone. Dick was just enjoying the view. \"So, how long have you not seen Miss Kori?\" Daphne suddenly asked. \"A while…\" Dick replied, sighing. \"I could've driven myself,\" Damian suddenly interrupted. Dick smirked. \"After the stunt you pulled?\" he asked, chuckling, \"You're lucky to be allowed within 10 feet of a steering wheel.\" \"So this is my punishment? Enduring a bunch of school children?\" Damian asked. \"This is not punishment. Hopefully, you'll learn to be a part of the team, or you'll just going to give Daphne a hard time,\" Dick replied. Daphne butted in. \"They're teenagers, Master Damian. Why would they call it Teen Titans, if not…\" she muttered. \"Worse…\" he replied. \"Don't tell me Damian Wayne is afraid of a little socializing,\" Dick muttered, giving out a teasing smile. \"I'm not afraid of anything. Teammates are liability…could be bigger than her,\" Damian explained, glancing up at Daphne. \"What's that supposed to mean?\" she mumbled angrily. \"Then what am I to you?\" Dick asked, turning to look at Damian. \"An unavoidable irritation,\" the boy replied harshly. \"Hah…and Daphne?\" the young man asked, taking a glimpse at the girl at the back. Daphne blinked at Dick's question. Damian didn't reply to his question, making her wondered what she is to Damian. The tower where the Teen Titans reside came to view. Damian was somewhat amazed at how beautifully built it was. Daphne knew about the tower because Dick used to tell her stories about it. Her phone suddenly vibrated and it was a text from her sister. She decided to read it once she had settled down in her room at the tower. The members of the Titans were waiting for them upfront. Damian stared and observed each one of them. \"Try not to behead anyone,\" Dick said to him. \"We're here!\" Daphne heaved a sigh. They got out of the car. Dick and Starfire, the leader of the team, greeted each other rather awkwardly. Damian was confused at their actions while Daphne giggled. She turned to look at the other members of the team: a hooded girl who looked mysterious, a green skinned boy and a boy in a blue armor of sort with a scarab on his back. \"This is Damian, the new Robin,\" Dick introduced him. \"Welcome, Damian,\" Starfire said. \"I'll be in my room,\" Damian replied, walking up to the tower. \"Would you like to…\" Starfire's words were interrupted. Damian cut her off, \"I think I can manage.\" \"That is one creepy mocoso,\" the boy in the blue armor said. \"No, more like sad…\" the hooded girl replied. Daphne came up to them and said, \"I'm really sorry he's like that.\" \"And you are?\" the boy in blue asked. \"She's Daphne, codename Phoenix. She'll be watching over Damian,\" Dick explained, walking to the girl's side. \"Nightwing's told me all about you,\" Starfire said. \"I know,\" she replied, turning to Dick, \"You're leaving?\" \"I guess… Watch over him,\" Dick said to her. Daphne nodded and replied, \"Sure, I will. It is my job.\" Dick got into the Batmobile and went on his way. Daphne turned to the four who was staring at her. She flashed out a smile, holding her duffel bag. \"Jaime, Blue Beetle,\" the boy in blue armor introduced himself. \"Garfield, Beast Boy,\" the other boy said. \"Raven, just Raven,\" the hooded girl said next. \"Nice to meet all of you. Again, I'm really sorry for Master Damian's behavior,\" Daphne apologized once again. \"You call him 'master'?\" Garfield asked, raising his brows. The orange haired nodded. \"Yes. I am his maid in real life,\" she explained. \"He is lucky to have a maid like you ,\" Garfield said, winking to Daphne. \"Yeah…whatever. Let me show you to your room,\" Jaime volunteered. Garfield butted in, \"I want to show her to her room!\" They suddenly started a tongue fight with Kori trying to calm them both down. Raven approached the confused Daphne. The orange haired gave a small smile to her. Raven was a bit intimidating in Daphne's opinion. The hooded girl looked at her. \"They're already hogging over you,\" she said. \"Yeah…I guess…\" Daphne drawled nervously. \"Your room is next to mine. Come on,\" Raven said, walking up to the door. Daphne deemed it as a sign to follow her. Kori shrugged at the boys and went inside as well. Jaime and Garfield glared at each other before entering the tower. Daphne was brought to her room by Raven. She also took the obligation of showing her where the kitchen and the living room are. When they arrived at her room, Raven left immediately to go and meditate. Daphne entered her room. It was a simple room with a bed, a study desk and a small wardrobe for clothes. Her phone vibrated. She answered it, \"Hello?\" \"Sis! What is taking you so long to reply my text?\" Delphinium shot once she heard Daphne's voice. \"Sorry, I was caught up with Master Damian and such…\" Daphne apologized, taking a seat on the bed, \"How's everything at the office?\" \"It's great, great, great…just great. Umm… How are you holding up? How did Damian react at the Titans?\" \"You know him. He went straight to his room after taking a look at everyone,\" Daphne sighed. \"So him. Well, my text asked about that. I just had to call, but we can talk later. Get settled in and…good luck,\" Delphinium said and quickly hung up. Daphne was confused at her sister's behavior but she ignored it. She put on a dress and a hoodie. After that, she arranged the clothes she had bought into the wardrobe. Kori came up to her room. \"Hi, Miss Kori,\" Daphne greeted her. \"There is no need for honorary. Just call me Kori. Would you like to join us for dinner?\" Kori invited. \"Sure, I'll call Master Damian,\" the girl replied. Kori nodded. She went on ahead. Daphne walked around the corridors to find Damian's room. It was located a little far from hers but she was fine with that. He was cleaning his sword when she got there. She knocked on the wall to grab his attention. He stopped and looked at her. \"Would you like to eat with them?\" Daphne asked. \"Send it to my room,\" Damian replied coldly. Daphne went up to him, biting her lower lip. She said, \"This is a good time to get to know them.\" \"I told you, teammates are a liability,\" he replied without even looking at her. \"Please…\" she begged. Damian gazed into her eyes. She faintly blushed at his actions. He sheathed his sword, got out of bed and walked away. Daphne smiled, rushing to follow him. Everyone was waiting for them in the living room. Daphne smiled at them. She sat beside Raven. Damian took a seat beside Garfield. \"So, what are we eating?\" Daphne asked. \"I thought we should just order some pizza. What toppings do you like, Daphne?\" Jaime replied. \"Pizza? Really?\" Damian muttered. \"Pizzas are great, okay!\" Garfield replied angrily. Daphne looked at Garfield who looked pissed off at what Damian had just said. Damian didn't reply to Garfield. He took a glimpse at his servant, sighing. Daphne spoke up, \"Ummm…do we have anything in the fridge?\" \"I think we have some veggies and a packet of meatballs,\" Kori replied. \"Any wheat?\" the girl asked again. \"We have some in the cabinet,\" Raven replied. The orange haired smiled with satisfaction. \"Okay, Miss Kori and Raven, please cook some rice. I'll think of something with the ingredients we have,\" she explained. \"You can cook?\" Jaime asked, a bit amazed. \"We usually just throw everything into the pot.\" \"Sure she can. She's my servant,\" Damian replied before Daphne could say anything. \"Yeah…I can. And maybe after dinner, I'll head out to do some shopping,\" the young girl replied. Jaime and Garfield looked at each other. They shrugged. While waiting for Daphne, Garfield went to play some video games and Jaime read a book. Damian just sat at the table, watching Daphne teaching Kori and Raven how to dice the carrots and some other vegetables. \"You are good at this,\" Kori muttered. \"I had to be. When I was taking care of Master Damian, he is a bit demanding when it comes to food,\" Daphne explained. She made roasted meatballs soup. Once the rice was cooked, they ate their food. Garfield couldn't get enough of Daphne's cooking. The girl just laughed at how he gobbled up his food because he wanted more of it. When they were done, the boys, excluding Damian, did the dishes. Daphne wanted to go out and buy some ingredients for tomorrow's menu. \"I'll drive you there,\" Kori volunteered. \"Umm…well…\" the girl drawled, \"Alright.\" Mana and Tiara made their way to where Delphinium was. She was in her study room, watching some of the cameras around Gotham. Batman was nowhere, so she assumed he was still with the Justice League. \"Miss, we've been looking all over for you…\" Tiara greeted her. \"Oh, hey, guys. Sorry, I didn't join for dinner…\" she replied, turning to look at them. \"You don't look so high spirited like always…\" Mana said. The two took their seats in front of Delphinium. The young teen sighed. She didn't know how to tell her two best companions about what she had found out that day in the office. \"Simply put, somebody is trying to buy our company…\" Delphinium started. \"Are you selling it?\" Tiara asked, concerned. She shook her head and said, \"Of course not. That company is the only connection I have with my parents.\" Mana and Tiara exchanged a look. Mana was next to ask, \"Who is this person?\" \"He said he was a friend of father's…and he had had an agreement with him that he can have the company if father dies…\" Delphinium explained, sighing, \"He had papers and stuff to show that he was right.\" \"Did you tell Miss Daphne about this?\" Mana asked. Delphinium sighed, looking at the picture on her desk, a picture of a six-year-old Delphinium and a four-year-old Daphne. She shook her head. \"I don't want her to worry about the company. As far as I know, she's not ready. Apparently, he doesn't know about our existence. So, I didn't tell him about Daphne…\" Delphinium explained. \"Oh…then, the papers he showed you are invalid! It was made before you two were born!\" Tiara insisted. \"Yeah… He said he'll come back to talk me into letting him have the company…\" Delphinium sighed again. Tiara and Mana looked at each other. They stood up, going up to their mistress. For the first time in their life, they saw her trembled. Who wouldn't? If the two sisters lost the company, they would officially go bankrupt and stripped off from their titles. Tiara and Mana hugged Delphinium to calm her. \"Just…don't tell my sister about this…\" she whispered. Thus begin a new conflict in the Aldrin's family which I will not write about just yet. Let's focus on teh fourth movie. ;)[Chapter 23] Chapter 23: The next morning, Daphne set out to cook them some pancakes. Damian was the first to wake up after her. He was wearing his uniform. He didn't eat anything but went off to train. Daphne followed him. He started the training facility. Daphne watched him. \"Are you sure you don't want to eat first?\" she asked. \"I'll puke if I do before I train,\" he replied coldly. Daphne sighed. He took out his sword. After a while, Raven, Garfield, and Jaime came by. \"Thanks for breakfast,\" Raven said. \"How long has he been training?\" Garfield asked. \"An hour or so…\" Daphne replied. They stood to watch as well, thinking that Damian would take turns. Half an hour of waiting, Kori showed up as Starfire. She stood by them. \"He hasn't stopped for an hour and a half,\" Jaime sighed. \"Damian, it's time to let others have their turn,\" Starfire said. Damian slashed another projected enemy. \"I'm not,\" he slashed another, \"Finished.\" Jaime shut down the system, earning a glare from Damian. He gave out a smug. \"Gee, how'd that happen…?\" he sneered. Daphne, sensing what was going to happen next, took out her kukri. Damian pulled out a batarang and threw it at Jaime, but before it could reach him, the girl cut it off. It exploded in front of her. She shook her head at Damian who frowned in return. \"What was that for?\" Jaime asked. Damian chuckled and replied, \"I heard your tech was fast, but she got to it before I could know how fast it is.\" \"Master Damian, stop this nonsense,\" Daphne said to him. Damian went up to her. Jaime stood in between them before he could say anything. \"Don't mess with us, little man,\" he warned. Starfire cut them off. \"Okay, that's enough. I can see we're getting off,\" turning to Damian, \"…on the wrong foot.\" \"Master Damian, calm down…\" Daphne whispered to him. \"Damian, this is a team effort. We need to learn to accommodate others,\" Starfire said. Damian sheathed his sword. \"Nightwing said you were a princess. Exiled, no doubt.\" Daphne disagreed with what he was saying. She turned to Starfire. The young woman replied, \"Technically, it was a coup. Like it or not, I am the leader of this group.\" Damian replied, \"As I see it, you're an alien with nowhere else to go.\" Raven stepped in, arms crossed. \"Everyone needs a home, Damian. You, included.\" \"Thank you for chiming in, witch girl,\" Damian muttered rudely. \"We are only here to help you realize your potential,\" Starfire reasoned. \"You've been here long enough,\" Damian crossed his arms, \"When do you think you'll realize yours?\" He started walking after that. Daphne sighed. \"I'll talk to him…\" she said to Starfire. Before she could, Jaime held the boy's shoulder. \"Dude, you need to show some respect.\" He twisted Jaime's arm, elbowed him in the stomach. He kicked him, sending him towards the wall. Raven gasped at the scene. \"Oh, no…\" she muttered. \"Master Damian, that was…\" Daphne's words were cut off. \"Out of the way,\" Damian said, pushing her away. Daphne was stunned at his behavior. Jaime stood up, his armor covering him. Damian unsheathed his sword, getting ready for a spar. They both rushed in and the clashing of blades started. \"No, stop this!\" Starfire spoke, but they both ignored her. \"Who's fighting me? You or the bug?\" Damian asked. \"You'd better hope it's me!\" Jaime replied. \"This is not going to end so well,\" Daphne sighed. The scarab tried to stab Damian but the boy flipped away on time. Jaime took a longer time to respond after that, giving Damian the win. He threw some bombs towards Blue Beetle, sending him again towards the wall. Damian stood up straight, proud of himself. He approached Jaime, saying, \"That's the difference between you and me. You wear a weapon. I am a weapon.\" The scarab started to take control of Jaime's body, charging up. It turned over and shoot Damian with its light beam. Damian collapsed in the middle of the training ground. The scarab was about to shoot again, but Starfire stopped him with one of her green bolts. \"Enough!\" she shouted in a stern tone. \"I tried to stop him…\" Jaime explained. Daphne went up to Damian, almost tearing up to see his face. She rested his head on her lap. She could still hear him cringed as she took off his mask. \"Dios mio. Is he dead?\" Jaime asked, concerned. \"He's okay…I think…\" Daphne said in a low voice. Garfield scratched his head, saying, \"This is going to be an awkward call to Batman.\" Daphne shot a glare towards him before turning back to look at Damian. Raven told everyone to get back. Daphne stood up, backing away just as everyone else did. Raven rested the boy's head on her lap and started unleashing her power. \"By the powers of Azarath, I beseech you…\" she said, cupping Damian's face, \"Azarath, Metrion, Zinthos.\" Damian's face started to slowly heal. Once it was complete, Raven gasped and fainted. Starfire caught her before she met the ground. Daphne sat beside Damian as she waited for him to come back to senses. \"We need to get her back to her room,\" Starfire said, looking at Beast Boy, \"Garfield?\" He transformed into a gorilla, taking Raven into his hands, \"I've got her.\" Damian woke up, asking, \"What happened?\" \"Raven healed you. We have to tend to her,\" Starfire explained. Jaime said, \"Sorry,\" before following Starfire. The three started walking, leaving Daphne and Damian alone. Damian sat up, cringing in pain. His head was still aching from the healing process. Daphne sat there, staring at him. \"Why are you crying?\" he suddenly asked. \"I-I'm not!\" Daphne replied, wiping away a single tear that trickled down her cheek, \"A-Anyway… What you did was unacceptable!\" \"You're scolding me now?\" Damian asked, getting up. Daphne sighed. She got up too, gazing into Damian's eyes. The boy froze for a second when he caught her gaze in his. She looked away, muttering, \"I don't know why I even bother about you…\" She walked away after that, leaving him to his thoughts. Dinner came and Damian never got out of his room after the incident, not that anyone cared. They seemed to be more distant and quiet. They ate the food Daphne cooked silently, not even maintaining eye contact with each other. After she was done with the dishes, the orange haired decided to go see Damian. She was about to knock on the door when it swiped opened. She was a bit startled. \"What do you want?\" Damian asked. \"I…thought you might be hungry…\" she replied, looking at the tray she brought. The boy sighed. \"Put it on my table. I'll eat it afterward. I have somewhere I need to go…\" he replied. \"O-Okay… Should I come with you?\" she asked. Damian shot a glare, freezing the girl in the place. She looked away and nodded because she knew what he meant. She placed the tray on the table, looking around. She shook her head at the sword sticking on the wall. She pulled it out and neatly placed it on his bed. Then, she went on her way back to her room. She checked her phone but no new messages or missed calls. She went out to see what the other members were doing. \"Hmm? Something wrong Daphne?\" Starfire asked when she saw the girl poking her head at her room. \"Oh,…it's nothing. It's still early so I thought of seeing what everyone was up to…\" Daphne replied, smiling. Starfire flashed a smile to the girl. She patted Daphne's head before going back to her table. The girl took it as a sign not to bother her. She went to the lounge to see Jaime eyeing the screen of his laptop and Garfield playing with blocks. The boys turned to look at her and she crooked a smile. \"Something wrong?\" Jaime asked, raising a brow. \"You wanna play?\" Garfield suddenly asked. \"Uhhh…\" before she could say anything, the boy pulled her to sit with him. He started to arrange the blocks again. Jaime ignored them as Garfield started asking about her. Daphne wasn't really listening because her mind was still occupied with Damian. \"Jaime?\" Damian's voice was heard. All eyes turned towards the door. \"Yeah?\" Jaime asked. \"Perhaps it was a mistake to challenge you this morning without knowing the full capacity of your…alien attachment. I promise you, it won't happen again…\" he said. His last sentence sounded like a little kid apologizing for his mistakes. Daphne muffled a giggle. She earned a raised brow from Damian and a stare from Garfield. Then, Damian walked away. \"Did he just say he's sorry?\" Jaime asked Daphne. Daphne shrugged and replied, \"I think so. He's not really good at expressing his real feelings.\" \"Awww, see. He likes you,\" Garfield cooed. \"Master Damian isn't really good with people. My first time with him as his maid was rough…but I managed,\" Daphne sighed. \"Did he ever yelled at you?\" Jaime asked, interested. Smiling, she replied, \"Listening to him yell and complain is one of my jobs.\" \"Must be tough, huh?\" Garfield asked. Daphne nodded. \"I guess…\" she muttered. Daphne was walking to her room. She had just finished another video game with Garfield who as always forced her to play with him. It was a good way to turn her mind off of her sister who hadn't contact her for a while. She suddenly caught sight of Damian exiting Starfire's room. \"Master Damian?\" she muttered. Starfire came out, flashing a smile to her although she looked angry. The young woman approached her. \"Would you like to go shopping for dinner?\" she asked. \"S-Sure…\" Daphne stammered, confused. They got into the car and went off to buy ingredients even though Garfield insisted that they order pizza. As the girl was reading the label of a canned sardine, Starfire couldn't help but wonder why Daphne was here. \"How long have you been with Damian?\" she asked. Daphne put the can back on its shelf, replying, \"Hmmm…4 years, but I went to stay with my sister in between.\" \"I see. Is he always like that?\" she needed to know. \"Like what? The detective type?\" Daphne chuckled, \"He will never stop until he gets his answer.\" Starfire nodded, taking a bundle of long beans and putting it into the basket she was holding. Daphne chose a few more ingredients, thinking of what to make. They went to pay after the girl was satisfied with what she had chosen. \"He was snooping around in my room today,\" Starfire started, disappointment in her tone. \"What for?\" Daphne asked, curious and confused as to why Damian would invade another person's privacy. \"He was searching for information about Raven,\" the woman replied. Hearing that, Daphne bit her lower lip. She didn't know why but there was an ache in her heart. She flashed a small smile to the confuse Starfire. \"Maybe he just wanted to get to know her better. Raven gives out a mysterious vibe, in my opinion,\" the orange-haired explained. \"She's the quiet type,\" Starfire replied. They got to the car. Daphne's phone rang. It was her sister. She flashed a smile to Starfire. The woman started to drive them back to the tower. \"Hello?\" \"Hey, Daphne. How are you?\" \"Never better… What's wrong?\" There was a pause before Delphinium asked, \"Is there a chance you would be coming back soon?\" \"Not really. He seems to be interested with another girl now. I think we'll be staying a little longer,\" Daphne sighed. \"Are you jealous?\" her sister chuckled. \"No. I'm glad he's making more friends now. Anyway, why'd you ask?\" There was another pause. \"No reason. I'll call you again soon.\" Delphinium quickly hung up. Daphne stared at her phone, blinking in surprise at her sister's actions. Usually, she would be asking for more information from her, but not that day. Daphne was worried. They soon arrived at the tower. \"I'm going to take a shower,\" Starfire said after placing the groceries bags on the kitchen counter. \"Okay. I'll get started on lunch,\" Daphne replied. Garfield caught sight of her. He smiled, approaching her. \"Hey,\" he greeted her. \"Can I help?\" \"Yes, please. Umm, put these into the refrigerator,\" Daphne replied. The boy did as ask. As he did, he stole glances towards the girl. She was busy washing some vegetables, humming a tune as she did. \"So, what's up with you and Damian?\" he suddenly asked. Daphne placed the bowl full of veggies on the kitchen counter. She turned to him with a confused expression. She didn't really understand what he meant. \"What do you mean?\" she asked. \"You never leave his side. You guys always train together. When he refused to eat, you'd be worried. You've been apologizing to us because he didn't want to mingle with us,\" Garfield explained. Daphne flashed a smile. She started to dice the carrots and onions. The boy waited for her to reply. She didn't know the right answer to give him. Damian suddenly made an appearance. \"Is lunch ready yet?\" he asked. \"I was just about to make it,\" the girl replied. Damian blinked and nodded. \"Send mine to my room.\" \"I thought we could eat with them today. It's been two days since we come here. You hardly talk to them,\" she drawled nervously. The black haired boy stared into her eyes. She bit her lower lip and looked away. She started the stove, turning her back to him. Garfield studied her reaction and then, studies Damian's. Something was off. He thought. \"Hey, Damian. Wanna play a game?\" he suddenly said, breaking the silence in the atmosphere. \"I'm not the type to indulge myself in such an activity,\" he replied coldly. Garfield turned to Daphne to see if she would say anything to convince the black-haired. She bit her lower lip and shook her head slightly. She started tossing the ingredients into the heating water in the pot. \"What are you making?\" Damian asked. \"Soup,\" was all she replied. He sighed. \"I'll eat with them,\" he muttered before walking up to the sofa to watch tv. Daphne flashed a small smiled, satisfied.[Chapter 24] Chapter 24: Delphinium hung up her phone. She gazed at the name of the recipient. Sinking into her chair, she sighed. Tiara and Mana had been keeping her company at the office that day. \"How is she, Miss?\" Mana asked. \"She has a rival to win Damian's heart now,\" Delphinium laughed. Tiara chuckled. \"Oh, my! That is something,\" she remarked. The sixteen-year-old nodded. \"It'll be good to keep her busy.\" \"He's coming again today. He never gives up,\" Mana reported. Delphinium sighed, scheming through the contact list in her phone. Tiara and Mana glanced up at each other. \"I know,\" the girl started, sighing again, \"I need you two to go see someone for me. I don't want that man to know about the two of you as well.\" \"But, Miss…he could do anything to you,\" Tiara reminded. \"Don't worry. I have Arnold by my side whenever I meet him, so I'm fine,\" Delphinium replied, taking out a binder from her drawer. She handed it to her maids. She wrote an address on a piece of paper and handed it to them as well. She explained what they had to do. The maids widened their eyes in disbelief at her request. \"I feel like…my time has come,\" she muttered. Tiara and Mana turned to look at each other. They nodded to Delphinium and went on their way. Tiara drove the car as Mana started to scheme through the binder. \"I can't believe she's doing this,\" she sighed. \"It's best for Miss Daphne this way,\" Tiara remarked. Mana sighed and replied, \"Yes, but Miss Delphinium never thinks about her own needs. All she ever thinks about is Miss Daphne.\" \"We've been with them since they were babies. You know why she's doing this,\" her partner reminded her. She looked out through the window. \"I guess so. I hope Miss Daphne will be okay with this.\" They soon arrived at the written address. As they got off the car, they noticed a young man getting off his motorbike. It was Dick Grayson, the person they were told to meet. \"Grayson!\" Tiara called. Dick looked around in surprise. He saw the two approaching him. \"Please, we're about the same age. Call me, Dick,\" he said, chuckling. \"Okay…\" Tiara muttered, turning to look at Mana. \"We have something to discuss with you,\" Mana started. Dick looked at the two maids simultaneously. Mana bit her lower lip as she handed the binder to him. He took it. After reading some of the papers, he widened his eyes in disbelief. A knock on the door was heard. Daphne was busy giving her weapon a maintenance at the time. She jumped off her bed and rushed to greet her guest. She was surprised to see Garfield at her door. \"Hey, wanna hang?\" he asked, giving her a cool look. \"Uhhh…why?\" she asked, grinning nervously. \"There's a carnival nearby. I thought we could go there and you know, get to know each other better,\" he explained, winking. Daphne bit her lips, thinking of what to reply. Damian came by and she was relieved. \"Kori wanted us to meet her in the garage where her car is. She said it's important for everyone to be there,\" he said, shooting a glare to Garfield. \"Oh…okay,\" Daphne said. Raising a brow, Damian continued, \"But first, change into a more appropriate attire. Why did you even bring a nightdress?\" \"It's easier to wear this to sleep,\" Daphne puffed her cheeks angrily. Damian shook his head. He took his leave. Garfield flashed a smile to Daphne before following the boy. Daphne shut her door and went to her closet. She put on her tights and a dress over it. She picked up her Phoenix boots and grabbed her denim jacket. After that, she went to the garage. \"We're going out,\" was all Starfire said. She urged everyone to get in the car. Raven and Daphne squeezed together in the front passenger seat. The orange haired was glad that she is somewhat small for her age. They arrived at the carnival Garfield mentioned earlier. Damian was told to leave his sword in the car. \"Tonight, we are to enjoy some mandatory fun ,\" Starfire explained. She waited for them outside the car. Daphne sadly looked at the ground. Raven noticed her change of mood. All of them followed Starfire to the entrance. Daphne gave out a long stare at the happy people enjoying themselves at the carnival. She shook her head rapidly and followed the others. As one by one of them entered the area, Starfire explained why they were here. \"This is an opportunity for us to become more familiar with each other,\" she said. \"How much more familiar can we get? We already saw Garfield licked himself,\" Jaime muttered. \"As a dog?\" Damian asked. \"I wish,\" Raven replied. Daphne was last to walk in. She didn't really mind that they paid no attention to her, but coming to a carnival ? She sighed to herself. Starfire walked up to her. \"Is something wrong?\" she asked with concerns. \"I…honestly don't really like carnivals. They remind me a lot of my parents,\" she explained. Starfire was shocked. \"I'm so sorry…\" she said, holding the girl's shoulder. Daphne smiled. \"It's okay. It's a great idea. Master Damian doesn't have a childhood so this is good. He can understand what having fun is,\" she replied. Starfire smiled and nodded. They went to where the others were standing to wait for them. \"You're gonna love it here. Maybe I'll win something for you,\" Garfield whispered to Daphne. \"Thanks, but I don't think it's worth your time,\" Daphne faked a smile. They started off with the Ferris wheel which Daphne didn't want to ride. The other four of them did. The said girl stood with Starfire to wait for them. \"Are you sure you're okay? I can send you back to the tower if you want,\" she said to the girl. \"It's okay. I'll stick around,\" Daphne insisted. They went to another stand after that. Garfield and Jaime competed to see who could earn more tickets. Damian stood watch with Raven. Of course, Daphne was watching him like she would always do. Seeing him trying to enjoy himself made her feel happy. Starfire patted her should once in a while to make sure she was okay. She would always give out a smile whenever the team leader did that. After a while, Damian decided to have a drink. He told Daphne to come with her. Raven tagged along. \"What's with you?\" Damian suddenly asked Daphne. \"I have a lot on my mind. That's all,\" she lied. \"You're my servant. I know when you're lying,\" he suddenly said. Daphne was a bit surprised at his words. Raven interrupted them. She told Damian to have a taste of the cotton candy she had bought. \"That tastes like pure sugar,\" he exclaimed. \"Boy were you up in those mountains a long time,\" Raven joked. Damian looked away. Daphne excused herself to go buy some snack. As she walked away from the two, she turned back to look at them. Her master was progressing well in accepting company. After buying some sushi, she saw Starfire, standing to watch Garfield and Jaime having a dance off. \"Hmmm, Garfield's pretty good,\" she remarked. Raven and Damian stood beside her. She handed them a sushi which Raven declined and Damian took a bite. He spat it out after that. Daphne giggled at his reaction. Jaime came, defeated. \"Free popcorn to anyone who could slay the beast,\" he said. \"I can do it,\" Damian suddenly said. All eyes were on him. \"I've never seen you dance before,\" Daphne muttered. \"You know how to dance?\" Raven asked him. \"I'm a quick study,\" Damian replied, walking up to the stage. The four of them went closer to the stage to get a better view. Daphne was amazed at how quick Damian got the hang of the game. She started jumping and clapping her hands. \"You sure are excited,\" Jaime remarked. \"It's not every day you see him like that,\" she replied, smiling. Once the game ended, Damian casually walked down the stage to where they were watching. Garfield came after. \"Awesome, dude,\" Jaime said to Damian. \"Yes, quite impressive,\" Starfire was next. \"You were great!\" Daphne exclaimed. \"You were very good too, Garfield,\" Starfire said to him. \"Yeah,\" he said, catching his breath, \"Whatever.\" Suddenly, screams were heard. Daphne noticed the red electric flashing about. It was the same as the one with the incident involving Wizard. Raven was thrown onto the grown. Three demons surrounded them. People started to scatter away. \"Raven!\" Starfire shouted. \"Titans, go!\" Daphne watched as each of them transform. Damian took her hand and rushed to the car to get his sword. \"Did you bring your weapon?\" he asked. \"No…it was under maintenance, but I did bring something else,\" she replied. \"Don't worry about me. Go help them.\" Damian nodded. After retrieving his sword and changing into his uniform, he ran back in to help the others. Daphne sighed. She took off her denim jacket and dress. She slipped in her uniform and buckled her utility belt. Then, she ran back in. She looked around to see who she could help. \"Raven! Starfire!\" she called out when she saw them fallen. She rushed in and threw a bomb towards the demon attacking the two. Its head exploded. She knelt down in front of Raven, checking her wounds. \"Are you okay?\" she asked. \"Ugh…look out!\" Raven shouted, creating a force field to protect them. The demon shot red light beams out of its two pairs of eyes. Daphne took out another bomb and her stun gun. She kicked the demon and threw the stun gun. The demon roared and she threw the bomb next. Then, she took out a grenade but before she could throw it the demon punched her. \"Damn!\" she cringed. \"Get back,\" Raven said to her. Seeing that the others were about down with the other two demons, she used her power to defeat the last one. Her dark energy turned into a bird, exterminating the last one. Daphne was the only one who saw her demon face at the time – red skin and four fiery red eyes. She shook her head, running towards Starfire who was still on the ground. \"Are you okay?\" she asked, checking her body. Starfire nodded to her. Damian, Jaime, and Garfield came up to them. Daphne and Starfire stood up. \"You're bleeding,\" Robin pointed to her jaw. \"Yeah, it got me good,\" she replied, wiping away the dried blood. All of them turned to Raven after that. She glanced up at Daphne who bit her lower lip at her. Starfire paced up to the girl who was floating back onto the ground. She looked away from her comrades. \"Robin said I didn't know enough about you. I think he was right,\" she said. \"You told me you didn't have a father.\" \"What I said is that he's gone,\" Raven replied coldly. \"That's not the same as dead,\" Damian said. \"He's dead to me!\" she shouted, turning her back to them. Garfield crossed his arms and raised a brow. \"So…why's he trying to kill you?\" \"He's not trying to kill me. It's much worse,\" she muttered, extending her hand forward. The whole team was engulfed in darkness and was teleported somewhere else. Daphne unconsciously held Damian's arm, surprised by the sudden change in the area. They were in a ruined world. Buildings were torn down and broken. Stillness filled the air. \"Safe to say we're not in Kansas anymore,\" Garfield remarked. \"It's no star field I recognized,\" Starfire spoke, looking around. \"Mind letting my arm go?\" Damian whispered to Daphne. Daphne released her hold on his arm. She looked down, blushing. It was a fair reaction since she wasn't aware that she was holding onto it, after all. \"Where are we?\" Starfire asked Raven. \"Somewhere my father can't see us,\" Raven started. \"All right, let's hear it,\" Damian demanded. She turned to look at them. \"There's so much,\" she muttered. \"I guess it starts with my mom. She was young, rebellious and gullible. Of course, she wound up in a cult. Anyway, they decided to do the classic bride of Satan rite…and guess who got to be the lucky bride? I doubt anyone would expect it to work but the ancient ceremony turned out to be the real thing. So, Mom, with her great powers and judgment, didn't hesitate to hook up with the guy who emerged from the smoke.\" Garfield interrupted. \"Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait. So, your mom did it with Satan?\" Raven turned to him and replied, \"His name is Trigon, but basically, yes.\" \"But they totally did it,\" Garfield muttered in surprise. \"Garfield, that was inappropriate,\" Starfire sternly said to the boy and turned back to Raven. \"Go on.\" \"It gets weirder…\" she continued, looking down on the ground. \"Mom fled the cult and was on the run with nowhere to go when she was saved by these people from another dimension. The people of Azarath, a realm with beauty, peace and tranquility…where, needless to say, I did not fit in and I must've inherited my mom's terrible judgment because I thought that if I found out more about the monster who made me, I'd be able to make sense of myself.\" Daphne, guessing what would happen next, went to hug Raven as she continued. \"Poor mother, poor Azarath. I became its Trojan horse,\" she muttered, holding the girl in her arm and continuing, \"He took me to his hellish universe. I could hardly bear the horrors I saw there.\" Daphne pushed away. \"Why'd he want you?\" she asked. \"My thoughts exactly. Why?\" Starfire asked. \"He wanted Earth. He's the conqueror of the worlds, but he needs a powerful conduit to open Earth to his control,\" she explained. \"And you're half human. His way in,\" Damian remarked. Raven continued, \"But my magic was stronger than he realized. Before he could use me, I was able to trap him inside a crystal. It should have held him. Perhaps if I had stayed there, it would have, but I wanted a home.\" \"Why didn't you go back to Azarath?\" Jaime asked. \"This is Azarath,\" Raven said. \"Oh, Raven!\" Daphne sighed, hugging her again. She teleported them back but told them that she wasn't going to stay. She explained that she had put a protective spell on each of them, in case Trigon tried to harm them. When she was about to leave, Damian stopped her. \"Leave now and you'll always be running,\" he said. \"You've never met a monster like Trigon, Damian,\" Raven said. \"You beat him once,\" Jaime said. \"I was lucky,\" Raven replied. \"Now you'll be five times as lucky. If we can't save one of our own, who can we save?\" he muttered. \"I thought you hated us,\" Blue Beetle said. \"I'm not wishing you dead anymore,\" he gave out a smug smile. \"Robin's right. We are your best hope,\" Starfire said. \"It'll be best if you stay with us anyway…\" Daphne mumbled. A loud blast was heard and a portal tore open in front of them. It was the Justice League, without Superman. \"We heard about the attack. Were she at the center?\" Bruce asked. \"Her father is an inter-dimensional demon. He was after her,\" Starfire explained. \"She's coming with us,\" Bruce stepped up. Damian stepped forward in disagreement. \"No, we can handle this.\" \"If she's part of this, we need to know,\" Bruce replied sternly. \"So much like him…\" Daphne mumbled to herself again, mentally groaning. \"We can protect her,\" Damian insisted. Wonder Woman stepped in. \"I'm sorry, Raven. We've had two magic attacks and Superman is still missing,\" she explained. Raven gasped. \"No!\" \"What's the matter?\" Starfire asked the girl. \"He knows they're here. He wants them here,\" the girl burst. \"Who?\" Bruce asked. \"If they stay, everything will be lost,\" Raven blurted in panic. \"This is our job, father. You have to leave,\" Damian said. Jaime and Garfield were surprised. \"Father?!\" \"She's coming with us,\" Bruce said. \"She has to stay here!\" Daphne spoke up, rushing to Damian's side. Jaime and Garfield did the same. They were all in their battle stance. \"Maybe we should all take a breath,\" Starfire suggested. \"Too late, they're here,\" Raven muttered. Daphne saw the shadows creeping up to the Justice League members. She widened her eyes as they started to possess them. She glanced up at Damian before proceeding to cover for Bruce. She pushed him away with all her strength before the shadow could engulf him. \"Daphne!\" Bruce shouted. \"I messed up again,\" she gave out a sheepish smile. Wonder Woman, Cyborg, and Flash started to bear demonic features. Daphne was still trying hard to fight it off but failed. \"The Kryptonian has unearthed the infernal shrine, Raven,\" Wonder Woman muttered. \"The who did the what?\" Jaime blurted in confusion. \"An ancient shrine built by Satanists. It has magical properties,\" Raven explained. Flash was next to say something. \"You are the shrine's final piece.\" Damian stressed out, \"She stays here.\" Wonder Woman took her sword. \"You dare challenge us?\" Flash rushed in and they started to fight. Daphne raised her right hand. One of the glass windows from the tower shattered. She raised her other hand. Both of her kukris fell into it. She smirked and rushed in to attack them as well. \"Daphne…\" Damian muttered under his breath. \"Time to behave, Damian,\" she snickered, charging at him. He gripped his sword tighter, reading her every move like he would always do. She rushed in with her weapon. \"I'll get you back to your senses…\" he sighed.[Chapter 25] Chapter 25: Tiara and Mana went up to Delphinium's study to report about their encounter with Dick Grayson. She was busy with another paperwork. \"Good timing!\" she said to the two. \"Miss, we've come to report about the task you've given us,\" Tiara said. \"Oh, okay! Tell me what he said,\" Delphinium gestured them to sit down. They did as told. Mana started to explain, \"He said that Mr. Wayne has been away, settling some matters with the Justice League. He, too, thinks that this is weird of you.\" \"My choice, but go on…\" she replied. \"He said that he will give it to Mr. Wayne once he comes back. He asked us to give this letter to you,\" Tiara said, handing her an envelope. Delphinium stared at the handwriting and sighed. \"I have some matters to attend to,\" she started. \" Alone. \" \"We'll be going back first then. When do you want us to come back?\" Tiara asked. \"In three days. Go see if the place is still functioning well,\" Delphinium ordered. \"As you wish, Miss,\" Mana obliged and Tiara nodded. Damian stared out through the window in the tower. They were waiting for Cyborg to wake up. Bruce came up to him. He could see the scar on Damian's face and around his throat. Daphne almost slit his throat. Placing a hand on his shoulder, he smiled at his son. Damian stared. \"She'll be fine,\" he reassured him. \"I'm more worried about Raven,\" he replied coldly. \"You don't care about Daphne?\" Garfield suddenly asked. \"If we can save Raven, then we will automatically save her as well,\" he explained. \"I think his back online,\" Jaime suddenly announced. All of them went to Cyborg. Damian checked Raven's location. He told them his plan to take out Superman. Bruce was amazed at how absurd he could be. Once they were ready, Cyborg boomed them there. As the portal opened, Jaime, Cyborg, and Starfire were the first to appear. Superman rushed in to eliminate them. They shot some beams before Damian jumped onto him when he was in range. He stabbed the hero with a Krypton. He was soon back to his senses. \"Starfire, you okayed this?\" he asked the young woman. Starfire took a deep breath before replying, \"Yes.\" \"Good call,\" Superman smiled. Bruce came up to his comrade. He gave out a smirk. Screams were heard a few times, catching their attention. All of them went to see what was happening. Raven was connected to a circular device which they deduced at the shrine mentioned before. Flash was coming up to them. Bruce suddenly said, \"I'll stop Flash. You handle Wonder Woman,\" he said to Superman. \"I wouldn't have it any other way,\" Superman flashed a smile. \"What about Daphne?\" Starfire asked, worried. \"What about me?\" her voice was heard. They turned around to see the girl, standing with one hand on her hip and the other holding a kukri. She smirked at them. Damian stepped forward, unsheathing his sword. All eyes were on him. \"She's mine ,\" he muttered. The other Titans rushed to save Raven. Bruce patted his son's back once. Then, he busied himself with Flash while Superman was saving Wonder Woman. Damian stood still, looking at his servant. She looked different, more confident and had a way with her words. \"You think you can stop me?\" she said proudly, taking out her other kukri as well, \"I should've just killed you.\" \"But you hesitated,\" he smirked. She growled and charged at him, aiming to slice his head. Damian did well in blocking most of her attacks. He could read them after their encounter at the tower. He swiped her legs but she jumped away and landed behind him. He kicked her right hand, loosening her grip on her weapon. He quickly pushed her before she could grab it. She fell onto the ground. \"You can't separate my babies from me,\" she said, calling back her kukri which swiftly fell back into her right palm. \"What kind of a device did Delphinium give you this time…?\" Damian muttered a complaint. She stood up. He rushed in as she was about to rush into him. They accidentally banged their head together. Daphne groaned in pain. Damian shook his head rapidly to reduce his dizziness. She was about to grab her kukris again. He pinned her down before she could. She glared angrily. Damian gazed into her eyes through his mask. \"Get off of me!\" she screamed angrily. \"Wake up!\" he shouted to her. \"You don't even care about her! She's better off with us!\" she shouted and laughed. Damian gritted his teeth. Of course, he cared. He just didn't know how to properly express it. He cares so deeply for her that it hurts when she's not around, it hurts when she's laughing at other people's joke, it hurts when she didn't care to look after him. It hurts whenever he saw that smile of hers, that innocent smile she gave out to others, but not to him. It hurts too much! He screamed in his head. He inched his face closer to her. \"What are you doing?!\" she shouted as his lips crashed onto hers. Soft. He thought, shutting his eyes. I don't want to lose you… He pulled away and got up immediately. The spirit fled out of her body through her mouth. Daphne cringed before sitting up. She looked up at him, confused. \"Master Damian?\" she muttered. \"Let's get going. Raven needs us,\" he said, glancing up at her. She nodded, collecting her kukris and sheathing them. Seeing how slow she was reacting, Damian pulled her to run to the others. The grounds were rumbling and cracking as they grouped up with the rest of the team. \"You sure took your time,\" Bruce whispered to his son. \"I had some difficulties…\" he replied, glancing up at Daphne. Trigon pierced from underground. All of them stared in shock and awe. Thunders could be heard and clouds were darkening in seconds. They watched as Trigon's horns grew longer and the flames around his body were put out. \"Well, this sucks,\" Jaime remarked. As he landed onto the earth, wind gushed out. Trigon ignored them, walking up to the first city he saw. \"He'll bring hell on Earth,\" Raven said. \"How do we stop him?\" Cyborg asked. \"There's only one way,\" she muttered. \"You're going to put him back in the crystal,\" Damian turned to Raven. Raven sighed. \"In the likely that I can make it there,\" she muttered. Cyborg contacted Superman to tell them Raven's plan. He told him that he would be helping the Titans. Damian was busy staring at his servant who was having a hard time dissolving all of this. \"Where's your cape?\" he suddenly asked, catching her attention. \"I didn't bring it with me. I don't like that addition to my uniform,\" she replied. Raven opened up a portal to hell. They hoped through it one by one. \"I don't feel so good,\" Garfield groaned. \"The crystal can only be touched by me. He may have escaped it but he can't destroy it,\" Raven explained. Jaime looked around. \"I just hope he left a trail of breadcrumbs,\" he said. They started to walk up to a path. Right in front of them was the place where Raven had placed the sealed crystal. She told them that the place was shielded so she couldn't teleport them instantly inside. They started their walk. Shrieks can be heard from a distant. Hordes of monsters were charging towards them. \"I don't like where this is going…\" Daphne sighed, taking out her kukris. Garfield was experiencing a trance, adapting to the new environment and creating a new beast out of it. Blue Beetle covered him as he growled and groaned in pain. Starfire and Cyborg were fighting as well. Damian, Daphne, and Raven slowly moved forward, killing any wyrms in their way. Damian kept on glancing at both of them back and forth. Daphne was doing fine even though she had just been possessed a few minutes ago. He heaved a sigh of relief seeing her condition. \"Welcome home, sister,\" a hoarse voice said. \"That's the three demons we fought before!\" Daphne exclaimed. They suddenly merged together, turning into a three-headed beast. It started to unleash a fire beam. The three jumped away. Daphne started to attack it. Damian tried to slash one of its pincers. His servant held his shoulder, earning his attention. \"You should get going with Raven. They're on their way here. I'll be fine,\" she said, glancing up at Raven. The hooded girl was busy staring at the building in front of them. Damian turned to look at Daphne. The girl flashed a small smile, nodding to him. He looked down before running to get Raven. Daphne watched them enter the building after Raven released the seal. She sighed. She jumped onto the monster's body, climbing onto the first head she could and attempting to stab it. The monster swung its head around. Daphne gripped onto it for dear life. \"Phoenix!\" Starfire called, shooting her green beam at the monster. Daphne let go of her grip. Cyborg caught her in his arm. She forced a smile at the man. Starfire tended to her. \"Where are Robin and Raven?\" she asked. \"They managed to get in,\" Daphne replied, pointing towards the building. Starfire nodded. The girl sat up, watching the others fight the monster in front of her. She summoned her kukris into her hands, refusing to back down. I don't want to be weak anymore. \"Whoa! Are you okay to be moving around?\" Cyborg asked the girl. She nodded, throwing her kukri. It hit the monster's right eye. She summoned it back. She rushed in and threw her bombs. Beetle and Cyborg turned to look at each other. The girl jumped up and stabbed the monster's back. It shrieked in pain. It threw her off course with its left head. Daphne's back hit one of the rocks. She fell onto the ground. She looked up to see her friends struggling to defeat it. \"Master Damian…\" she whispered. She stood up again, rushing in again. All eyes were on her. They wondered what motivates her so much. She succeeded in slicing the monster's middle head. \"That is one crazy girl!\" Cyborg exclaimed. Daphne jumped onto the right head. The monster shrieked as she stabbed its eyes. She jumped away, dodging its pincers. \"You okay, Phoenix?\" Jaime asked her. She gave out a thumb up, forcing a smile. \"I'm okay, don't worry,\" she muttered. \"Why are you acting like this?\" he asked, concerned. Daphne looked away. Shrieks could be heard across the realm. A dark shadow started to engulf all of the monsters around them. \"What's happening?\" she asked. \"I think Raven did it!\" Beetle exclaimed, delighted. He helped the girl to her feet. Starfire took her hand. She started flying towards where Raven and Damian were. The others did the same. \"Raven,\" Starfire approached the two. \"Is it over?\" \"It'll never be over,\" Raven started, looking up to Starfire, \"Trigon will spend every single minute trying to get out of here, so he needs to be watched every single minute.\" \"Are you staying here?\" Daphne asked. Raven didn't answer the girl's question. She opened up a portal for them to go back. She backed away after that, telling them that she won't be coming back. \"This is my home,\" she muttered, hugging herself, \"I have to watch him.\" She turned her back to them, walking away. Damian stopped her. \"It's not your home,\" he started, stopping her. Raven turned to him, waiting for his next comforting words. \"Home is the place where…when you have to go there, they have to take you in,\" he said, glancing up at the rest of his team. \"Robert Frost,\" Starfire smiled. \"You are full of surprises, Damian.\" \"You're coming with us,\" Damian said with a smile. \"We won't let you stay here,\" Daphne said. Raven stared at the crystal in her palm. She thought of what to do with it. She turned to them with the sweetest smile. Damian nodded to her. They went back to the tower. Cyborg bid them goodbye and boomed himself back to Justice League's hideout. \"Let's get inside,\" Starfire said. \"Yeah, there's a lot of fixing up to do,\" Jaime muttered, chuckling. \"Do you want me to patch you up?\" Daphne asked Damian. \"No thanks, I'm good,\" Damian replied, looking away from her. Daphne blinked towards him. All of them headed back to their rooms to rest. Jaime updated the tower's defense system. He turned to Daphne who looked as if she was waiting for him. \"I've already restarted the tower's functions and systems. It'll start fixing itself up,\" he told her. Daphne nodded. She went to the kitchen. Jaime followed her. She opened the refrigerator and turned back to him. \"Do you want anything?\" she asked. \"Grab me a bottle of water, thanks,\" Jaime replied, smiling towards her. He was back in his black shirt and blue jeans. Daphne only took off her mask. She wasn't wearing anything except tights under her dress. She couldn't possibly take it off. She handed the bottle of plain water to Jaime. She sat opposite of Jaime, drinking her bottle of milk. \"Are you okay?\" Jaime asked. \"Yeah, I'm good…\" she muttered and sighed after that. Jaime looked away, replying, \"If you say so.\" \"I'll cook something up in case they're hungry once they wake up,\" she announced. \"I'm going to take a nap too then,\" he muttered, excusing himself. Daphne nodded. She started to cook some simple dishes after that. It was midnight when everyone woke up. They went to the living room to find Daphne sleeping at the kitchen counter. Her face was full of soot which who knows came from where. Starfire and Raven looked around the kitchen. Daphne had cooked chicken soup, fried meatballs, and stir fries. \"No wonder she's sleeping,\" Starfire muttered, gazing at the girl, \"I'll put her to bed.\" \"We should just wake her up to eat with us,\" Damian spoke up. \"Who knows what time she slept,\" Jaime said. Damian turned to him with a stern look. He shut his eyes and sighed. \"Fine,\" he replied. He went closer to the girl. All of them watched as he shook her. Her eyes fluttered open. She looked around to see them. She blinked before grinning sheepishly. \"Was I sleeping?\" she asked, scratching her head. \"Go change your clothes,\" he said. \"Damian, let her sleep,\" Garfield protested. Daphne flashed a smile at the boy. \"It's okay. I'll sleep after I eat with you guys.\" She went on her way. Raven and Starfire started serving the dish. Garfield looked angrily at Damian. \"You should let her sleep!\" he protested again. \"Too bad for you, she listens to my orders,\" Damian replied coldly, taking a seat. \"She has her rights too, you know?\" Jaime muttered. A loud thud was suddenly heard. All of them widened their eyes. Jaime was the first out of the living room to go see what was happening. Daphne had fallen unconscious before she could enter her room. Starfire collected her into her arms. \"Is she okay?\" Garfield asked. Starfire brushed Daphne's bangs. Her face flushed, her breathing ragged. The leader of the team placed her right hand on the girl's forehead. She looked towards them, shocked. \"She has a fever,\" Starfire muttered. \"I'll go get some medicine,\" Raven announced. \"Dude! This is all your fault!\" Garfield shouted at Damian. \"My fault? How is this my fault? The girl has been weak since the first time I met her!\" Damian shot back. Garfield turned to Starfire. He was angry. Starfire shook her head sternly. She didn't want them to fight. Damian excused himself before Garfield could start anything. Starfire picked Daphne up and tucked her in bed. \"Is she going to be okay?\" Jaime asked. \"She will. We'll call a doctor tomorrow morning,\" she replied. \"Why does Damian have to act that way…?\" Garfield huffed angrily. They didn't reply. Raven wiped the sweat off of Daphne's forehead. Her fever was getting higher by minutes. There was nothing they could do at the time. \"Let's just eat and wait for morning to come,\" Jaime broke the silence.[Chapter 26] Soo, this is chapter 26! We have come to the end of the fourth movie and following my own writings from now. At the very least, Damian realized his feelings for Daphne. Anyways, there is more to come so stay tuned! ^^/ - ( July 22, 2016 ) Chapter 26: Daphne woke up to find herself in bed. She looked around and suddenly caught a soft snoring to her left. When she turned, she was surprised to see Jaime, sleeping. She smiled weakly at him. She sat up, flinching when a stab hit her head. As if knowing that she had woken up, Jaime stirred and sat up. He rubbed his eyes. \"Good, you're finally awake,\" he started. \"How long was I asleep?\" she asked. \"Today makes 4 days. You had a fever and it was getting higher by day,\" he explained. \"I guess you're right. My head still stings,\" Daphne muttered weakly. \"Kori said that if you still have a fever, you should keep resting. We take turns to look after you...\" he said. \"Master Damian too?\" she asked. Jaime nodded slowly after a brief pause. She knew that he was lying. She didn't want him to worry, so she nodded at his reply. She knew that Damian would never do such a thing for her sake. It is not like him at all if he did. Jaime told her that he would bring her lunch. She thanked him with another fake smile. The boy patted her head once before leaving her. Daphne looked sadly at her lap. Her tears abruptly started trickling down her cheeks. Why? After half an hour, Garfield barged into the room with Jaime behind him. Daphne wiped her tears and looked up to them. Garfield noticed her swollen eyes. He turned to Jaime who was busy placing the tray on her table. Garfield helped her to the table. \"I'll leave you with Gar. He was delighted to hear that you've awakened,\" Jaime excused himself. \"Where's Master Damian?\" she asked Garfield. \"He went on a patrol with Raven. Apparently, there were heists going about when we were busy saving the world from Trigon, so they're investigating it,\" he explained. \"I see...\" Daphne muttered. \"A package arrived for you this morning, from Delphinium Aldrin,\" Garfield changed the topic. The girl looked confusedly at him. He smiled before rushing out of the room to get it for her. Daphne started to eat her soup. She read the prescriptions of her medicines as she did. Someone must have gotten it for her because her name was written on it. Maybe they even called a doctor or something? She shook her head to get it out of her mind. She was thankful that they cared for her as much. She wasn't even supposed to join Teen Titans but she just did in order to watch over Damian. Garfield came back with a box in his hands. He placed it on the table. He handed her a card attached to the box. \"Finish your food first,\" he insisted. \"I can at least read this...\" she replied, smiling. \"Umm...can I ask?\" Garfield spoke. \"Is today, your birthday?\" \"It's supposed to be tomorrow. Sis sent me a present? It's good to hear from her,\" Daphne muttered a reply, reading the card. \"Happy birthday, little sister! Hope you and Damian have a blast – your loving sister, Delphinium.\" She chuckled to herself as she read the card. Garfield gazed at the girl. He faintly blushed seeing how happy she was. He started to ask about her sister. She told him some of their stories of growing up together. Once she was done with lunch, he excused himself. He took the tray with him. He thanked her for sharing her stories with him. \"I've got to do something,\" he whispered, full of determination. Evening came and Damian and Raven were back. The girl decided to go see how Daphne was doing. Starfire went with her. Garfield and Jaime were left with Damian. There was a long silence in the air. Jaime coughed, earning the two's attention. \"So how'd it go?\" he asked Damian. \"We have no lead whatsoever. All we know is that most of the heist happened between midnight to 6 in the morning,\" Damian explained, sighing. \"That is bad...\" Jaime muttered. \"Damian,\" Garfield spoke. Jaime and Damian turned to him. His expression was all serious. The two were confused. They glanced up at each other before turning back to him. Garfield pierced his stern looks at Damian. \"I challenge you to a duel,\" he said. \"What? Dude, you gotta be kidding me,\" Jaime interrupted. \"Tomorrow's Daphne's birthday,\" Garfield started. \"How did you know that?\" Damian asked. \"She told me. Her sister sent her a gift. I want to take her out tomorrow,\" the boy explained. \"She'll never say yes if I told her not to,\" Damian stated. Garfield shot a glare. Damian blinked before turning his gaze away from the boy. He went to his room after that. Garfield fumed. \"Dude that is wrong ,\" Jaime said to him. \"She deserves better...\" Garfield muttered. Starfire and Raven came in. Jaime and Garfield stopped their discussion. Starfire dialled a number on the phone. \"How is she?\" Jaime asked. \"She was staring at her sister's gift,\" Starfire replied. \"She's still a little warm. One more long rest and she'll be back on her feet,\" Raven replied, looking around, \"Where's Damian?\" \"In his room I guess...\" Jaime muttered. Raven nodded. She went to Damian's room. The boy was busy scheming something on his laptop. Raven stood at his door. She waited for him to turn around. He was surprised to see her. \"How long have you been standing there?\" he asked. \"Daphne wished to see you,\" she said. \"Wait,\" he called before she could leave. Raven turned her gaze to him. He looked somewhat troubled in her opinion. She crossed her arms, waiting for him to say something. \"You've…\" he paused, looking at the floor, \"You've seen my past, present, and future that one time.\" \"It was an empath,\" she corrected him. \"But, go on.\" \"I need your opinion on something,\" he started. Raven raised her brows, surprised to hear that. She kept her mouth shut as Damian started to tell her what was bothering him and the reasons why he was avoiding Daphne. The girl flashed out a smile when he was done. \"So, what do you think I should do?\" he asked her. Smiling even broader, she said, \"If that is how you really feel, tell her.\" She walked away after that. Damian sighed. He went back to his laptop. Garfield suddenly appeared at his door. He was smiling. Damian rolled his eyes. He turned to look at the boy. \"What?\" he asked. \"Still up for the duel?\" Garfield asked. \"No,\" Damian replied coldly. \"I have work to do.\" \"She deserves better,\" the boy insisted. \"I know her better than you do,\" the black-haired replied. As Garfield was about to reply, they heard footsteps. They turned to see Daphne. She was leaning on the wall as support. Garfield rushed up to help her out of concerns. Damian continued his work, ignoring them. \"I wanted to see you, Master Damian...\" she muttered, turning to the busy boy. \"Your fever's back. You have to rest!\" Garfield interrupted. She shook her head, staring at the young master who had his back turned to them. \"Can I go home?\" she asked. \"What?\" Damian exclaimed. \"No.\" \"B-But…\" before she could finish, she fell to her knees. \"See? You're in no shape to be walking!\" the green-skinned boy said. Daphne smiled weakly. Damian took a glimpse of the girl before continuing to search the net. Garfield tried to hide his anger. He helped her up and sent her back to her room. \"I told you I want this company!\" a man in a suit shouted at Delphinium. \"Miss Delphinium, your phone…\" Arnold interrupted. Delphinium turned her head to her assistant and shook her head slowly. She turned back to the man in front of her. He had barged in that day with two bodyguards to attack her. Delphinium didn't like it at all, but she had anticipated something like this would happen. She made eye contact with Arnold. He nodded and exited the room with her phone in his hand. \"I told you I've already promised the company to someone else. Why do you want it anyway?\" she asked. \"Wait? You sold the company?\" the man asked angrily. \"I should just kill you this instant!\" The bodyguards took out their guns. Delphinium growled. She took out her very own stun gun, swiftly throwing it at the two before they could shoot. She glared at the man in front of her. \"Get out!\" she glowered. \"I'll be back,\" he replied and retreated for the time being. Delphinium fell to her knees. She bit her lips to kill the tears that were threatening to come out. She stood up immediately when Arnold came back with her phone. He told her that Tiara and Mana had sent her a text. She took her phone from him. \"Thank you for today,\" she said to Arnold. \"If you'll excuse me…\" Arnold bowed before exiting the office. Delphinium sat in her chair and swivelled around. Her phone rang again but she didn't bother to pick it up. \"I have to see him and explain everything,\" she sighed. Daphne stared at her sister's name in her phone. She had been trying to call her more than ten times already. She wondered why Delphinium didn't pick up that day. Was she that busy? She shook her head and tried to get some sleep. Raven had sent her dinner and she had taken her medicines. She was told to rest. Meanwhile, everyone else was busy minding their own business. Since Daphne had awakened, they didn't have to watch over her as much. Garfield was still pestering Damian to a duel. Jaime kept on telling him that it was a bad idea. Damian wasn't even finished with his dinner yet. What Daphne had requested got him thinking. Raven noticed his quietness. \"Is something wrong?\" she asked. \"She asked me if she could go home,\" Damian muttered. \"What? Why?\" Garfield asked, disbelieved. Damian shrugged. Starfire and Jaime heard it too. The room fell into another dead silence. Raven excused herself. She intended to head to her room but stopped in front of Daphne's door. She could faintly hear Daphne sobbing and muttering Damian's name. She sighed. I wish he knew how much you care for him. Daphne sat up in bed, wiping her tears. She couldn't sleep and the effect of her medicines was wearing off. She rubbed her eyes, searching for her kukris. They were neatly hung on the wall. She bit her lower lip. A knock on her door was heard before it swiped open. \"Daphne!\" Starfire called before she could reach for her kukris. Daphne turned to look at the floor. She clenched her hands together. Starfire stormed up to her. She held her shoulders and stared into her eyes. Daphne's eyes were tearing up. She didn't want Starfire to see her like that. \"Why are you…?\" she asked. \"I…\" Daphne muttered. Starfire pulled her into a hug. She rubbed her back lovingly, reassuring her that everything was okay. Daphne started to cry again. They didn't notice that the boys were watching by the door. Garfield turned to Damian. \"You don't deserve her!\" he said. \"Dude, now's not the time,\" Jaime muttered. \"You're not the one to decide my life,\" Damian said coldly before walking away. Daphne cried her eyes out. They were swollen once her cries subsided. Starfire tucked her into her bed. Garfield and Jaime gazed at the girl. They were concerned about her health. They decided to call Nightwing and Starfire agreed. As they were calling him, Damian was in his room. He was thinking hard about Daphne and the kiss. He was actually glad that she didn't remember it but he was somewhat sad too. She was the first girl he had ever kissed on the lips. She was the first girl he knew, the first girl to have ever caught his attention. \"Damn it…\" he muttered angrily. The next day, Dick came in his Nightwing uniform. All of the members, excluding Daphne, waited for him at the entrance. He looked very worried. It was typical of him to feel that way. \"How is she?\" he asked. \"What is that?\" Damian pointed at the box he was holding. Smiling, he replied, \"Today's her birthday. I thought we could at least celebrate.\" \"I didn't know that…\" Starfire muttered. In a few minutes, they were all gathered inside Daphne's room. Starfire gently shook her to wake her up. She was surprised to see Dick with a cake. \"Thank you…\" Daphne faintly smiled. They ate the cake and did a little catching up with each other. The others listened to their stories as well. Damian was obviously not enjoying this. He kept on staring at his cake. Raven approached him. \"You know, when I caught a glimpse of your future…\" she started, sighing, \"I saw Daphne.\" Damian snapped his head to her, shocked. \"Are you sure?\" he asked. Raven nodded. \"Yes.\" Damian stared at the girl. She was wearing a happy smile because her 'big brother' was with her. She really enjoyed his company. The boy looked away, starting to eat his cake. Raven shrugged, going back to the others. \"How is Delphinium?\" Daphne suddenly asked. \"She's as weird as always. She sends her regards. I asked her to come with me but she refused,\" he explained. \"Oh…\" Daphne sighed. The Teen Titans stood in front of their monitor. Justice League was about to contact them about the aftermath of Trigon's destruction. \"I've sifted through all the data and found no signs of the corruptors 10 days since our encounter with Trigon,\" Bruce explained. \"In other words, great work, Titans.\" Damian turned to Raven. The two of them smiled at each other. Daphne bit her lower lip when she saw Damian's expression. \"Your determination and teamwork saved the world, and us,\" Wonder Woman said, smiling, \"You should be very proud of them, Kori.\" \"As are we,\" Bruce continued. Daphne smiled and glanced up at Damian. She was glad everything worked out. Cyborg appeared from the door via his boom tube. In his hands were boxes of pizzas. The Justice League let them carry on with their agenda. They ran up to Cyborg. Daphne sat down on the sofa. She took off her mask. Jaime handed her a slice of pizza. She took it, eating it up. \"Raven and Damian have become closer by day,\" Jaime muttered. \"I'm happy for them…\" Daphne said, munching on her pizza. \"Have you packed everything up?\" the boy whispered to her. Daphne nodded. \"Master Dick will be picking me up tomorrow night,\" she whispered. Jaime nodded. He was the only one who knew that Daphne was going back. She didn't want Damian to know about it, so she didn't tell anyone else. Garfield came up to them. The girl excused herself to go to her room. Damian caught a glimpse of her sad face. \"Don't you think you should talk to her?\" Raven asked. \"No, I don't want to concern myself about her for now,\" Damian replied, huffing angrily. \"Don't regret it if you lose her,\" the hooded girl muttered. Meanwhile, Daphne was busying herself. She double checked her belongings. She turned to look at the gift her sister had given her. It was a pair of rings. She didn't understand the meaning behind them but she knew that Delphinium wanted her to give one to Damian. She sighed to herself. She lied down on her bed, staring at the ceiling. Meanwhile, Garfield was still pressuring Damian for a duel. He had already started a video game to challenge Damian. The boy ignored him like always. Jaime shook his head at the two. He didn't like the idea of Daphne as the prize. Raven, Starfire, and Cyborg were happily chatting at the kitchen side of the room. They weren't even paying attention to the boys. \"Why do you even want to keep her? It's not like you like her or anything, right?\" Garfield suddenly asked. All eyes turned to him and Damian. Garfield was wearing his usual smug while Damian was having a hard time hiding his confusion. \"Come on, Damian. Do you like Daphne? It's just a simple question…\" he pressured him again. \"Dude, you should stop,\" Jaime interrupted. \"Yes. It's not nice to ask such question,\" Raven agreed with Jaime. \"Oh? Are you jealous, Raven?\" Garfield snickered. \"Why would I be?\" the hooded girl asked. Damian shut his eyes, ignoring their tongue fight. He was hoping that Daphne would show up to stop this nonsensical situation. He wanted her by his side. He stood up and walked away. Garfield stared as he exited the living room. He huffed angrily at Damian's reaction. I love her. Delphinium busied herself in her office that night. She had some things to settle before her meeting with Bruce Wayne the next day. As she was busy sorting out the papers, she caught a glimpse of a shadow passing by behind her. She thought it was Batman so she ignored it. However, she was being extra careful. The papers to be given to Bruce and her sister was done. She placed them inside a box and hid it in an invisible vault. She texted Tiara and Mana to inform them. When she turned to the glass window, she saw the man, pointing a gun towards her. \"You think I'd just quit like that?\" he smirked, shooting her. Delphinium rolled away on time. She shot a glare at the man. His two bodyguards appeared, attempting to capture her. She kicked their jaws. Then, she ran away to hide. She was about to call Tiara but the man shot her phone away. She stomped on it so that he would not know about Daphne. \"You can't run away forever,\" the man said. \"Really, Rick? This is how you're going to obtain my company?\" she asked. \"You're just a sixteen-year-old girl! What do you know about running a company?\" he chuckled, mocking her. \"I know enough to not sell illegal drugs!\" she shouted, throwing a smoke bomb at the bodyguards. Rick laughed. He could guess what she was going to do. He had prepared everything to kill her that night and rob her building. Delphinium was determined to escape. She found the exit to her office. She made a sudden stop when she heard beeping sounds around her. \"What?\" she muttered, shocked. \"You think I'd let you escape that easily?\" Rick chuckled again. A window broke and she could see a helicopter. Rick jumped into it with his two bodyguards. He was holding a remote. Delphinium widened her eyes. She started running down the stairs. \"How did he implant the bombs without me knowing?!\" she shouted angrily. She kept on running as he activated each of the bombs he had planted on the walls of her office. She prayed that the documents she had kept hidden would be saved. Delphinium almost reached the exit when out of nowhere, a shot came. It hit her right leg. \"Damn!\" she flinched at the pain. Rick laughed before activating his last bomb which was right beside Delphinium. She forced a weak smile, embracing her doom instead of trying to flee. I'm sorry, Daphne. I trust you… Tiara, Mana, Bruce, and Dick looked around in the debris of the Aldrin building that morning. Bruce uses Batman's name to refuse any investigation from the police. They were searching for the box Delphinium had left for them. \"Someone who's able to kill Delphinium must be really smart,\" Dick remarked, turning to Tiara. \"Yeah. She's been running away for quite some time already…\" Tiara sighed. \"When we arrived here, we found her burnt body,\" Mana explained. \"He bombed the building but he will try to claim this area. He really is smarter than Miss Delphinium,\" Tiara sighed. \"We have to put him behind bars before he finds out about Daphne,\" Dick suggested. \"Indeed, you are right,\" a voice was heard. Dick turned around to see a woman, about his age, wearing a teal blouse and a black A-line skirt. She flashed a smile at the surprised faces. She nodded to them once. \"Who…are you?\" Dick asked, blinking in disbelief. Tiara and Mana turned to look at each other. They nodded as a signal. They went up to the woman and stood by her side. The woman turned to look at them simultaneously. Then, she turned back to Dick and Bruce. \"Well, I guess I should explain who I am,\" she sighed.[Chapter 27] Okay, so we finished the fourth movie. For this chapter, we're going to get a little hint about who the woman could be and what Delphinium had planned for her sister, Daphne. Oh! and about the ring as well. So, anyway, we're going to skip a year in the next chapter and see how everyone's doing again. Then, I will go in depth about who the woman that Bruce and Dick met in the last chapter. At the very least, Daphne would know about her. Anyways, enjoy and if you have questions, you can always ask me directly or leave it in the review. :) - ( 7/27/2016 ) C hapter 27: Daphne leaned against the wall of the path to Damian's room. She was waiting for him. Damian had just gotten back from his evening walk with Jaime. When he saw her, he turned to look away immediately. The girl smiled and rushed up to him. \"What do you want?\" he asked coldly. \"Raven told me you were the one who saved me when I was possessed…\" she started. \"So?\" he asked, accidentally meeting her eyes. \"I wanted to know how you saved me. You've started avoiding me ever since we got back…\" she requested. Damian shut his eyes, remembering the kiss. He muttered, \"I don't think you need to know that.\" They reached the door to his room. Daphne puffed her cheeks, dissatisfied with his reply. Damian found that to be adorable. He turned away from her gaze, faintly blushing. The girl blinked at his reaction. \"Please?\" she suddenly drawled. He turned to gaze into her eyes. He pulled at her arm, reducing the distance between where they were standing. \"Do you really want to know?\" he asked with a stern tone. \"Yes…\" she muttered, looking away from his eyes. Damian inched his face closer to Daphne, his gaze piercing her eyes. She bit her lower lip because she was nervous at how close his face was. Before his lips could touch hers, Garfield suddenly opened his door to head out. The boy pushed Daphne away and stood up straight. Garfield turned to the two back and forth. Damian was shutting his eyes and acting calm while Daphne was blinking confusedly and touching her lips with her right hand. He wondered what happened between them. He turned back to Daphne. \"Hey, Daphne! Let's go out for a bit,\" he said, earning a glare from Damian. \"Huh? Why?\" she asked, still a bit dazed. \"I found out a new bakery is in town…\" he said. He placed a hand on her shoulder, forcibly trying to make her walk with him. He flashed a smirk to Damian before walking away with Daphne. Damian stared into spaces. Entering his room, he sighed. Daphne waited for Nightwing at the entrance of the tower. Jaime and Starfire were with her. He flashed a smile whenever the orange haired girl turned to look at him. Starfire had sent off Damian, Raven and Garfield to stop a robbery. Jaime went closer to Daphne. \"Are you sure about this?\" he asked the girl. \"Yes. My work here is done. He has learnt everything his father wanted him to learn,\" she muttered and sighed. Jaime held her shoulder as comfort. The Batmobile had arrived. They weren't expecting Batman. He nodded to the two before turning to Daphne. She looked confusedly at him. \"Where's Master Dick?\" she asked. \"I have news,\" was his reply. \"I wonder why we're the only ones who have to go on this mission,\" Garfield thought out loud. \"Maybe Kori has other business to take care of,\" Damian remarked. They tied the last robber with his two mates. They waited for the police to come after that. Raven explained everything to the police and they thanked the three superheroes. Then, she teleported them all back to the tower. Starfire and Jaime were waiting for them in the living room. The two turned to them when they appeared through the door. \"How was it?' Starfire asked them. \"It was a cinch,\" Garfield said proudly. \"It was nothing,\" Damian said, shooting a glare towards Garfield. \"They beat them up without second thoughts,\" Raven reported. \"Hey!\" the two shouted in unison. Starfire nodded. She started to fix them up something to eat. Raven announced that she would be meditating in her room. Jaime excused himself too because he wanted to escape Damian's questions about Daphne. The said boy looked around for his servant. Jaime and Starfire exchanged a look before Blue Beetle took his leave. \"Where is she?\" Damian asked Starfire. \"She went back…\" the woman replied. \"Without a goodbye?\" Garfield asked sadly. \"It's not the first time. She did this to me once,\" the wonder boy explained. Starfire nodded while Garfield stared in disbelief. He was angry that Damian didn't care about the fact that Daphne had left them. The leader of the team excused herself to go to her room. She was expecting a video call from Dick about Daphne and her sister. \"You really don't deserve her,\" Garfield muttered. \"I thought I already shut you up about this,\" Damian replied. \"I like her, okay? Is it too much to ask you to leave her be?\" the boy raised his voice. \"I can't let you have her,\" the wonder boy muttered. \"Why?\" Garfield demanded. There was no reply. Damian ate his food quietly. Garfield shot a glare before ignoring him. Beast Boy finished his food and went to his room before Damian. The black-haired boy turned his gaze away from his food. He sighed. Because I love her. The next day, it was Delphinium's funeral and the Aldrin house was full of guests. Daphne stared out of the window in the music room. She was wearing a black dress. She couldn't care less about the visitors. Tiara and Mana had busied themselves welcoming the people who claimed to have known Delphinium. Arnold was helping out where he could. He felt responsible for her death even though Tiara had insisted that it wasn't his fault. \"Dick! Mr. Wayne!\" Mana greeted them. \"Alfred's here too,\" Bruce said with a small smile. Alfred nodded to Mana and Tiara. \"How is she?\" he asked. \"She's in the music room. She hasn't spoken a word after hearing the news,\" Tiara said. \"I'll go see her…\" Dick decided, walking up to the music room. \"The coffin is in the living room. Food is served in the dining room,\" Mana explained. \"It sure helps if you could entertain some of the guests. We've had our hands full since morning,\" Tiara said. Bruce nodded. He went to look around. Alfred decided to help with the food. Tiara went back to the living room after that. Mana stood at the front door to greet more friends of Delphinium's. Meanwhile, Dick peered through the door of the music room. He saw Daphne, sitting by the piano. She noticed him. He was surprised to see her in such a state. Her eyes were empty and swollen, her body looked weaker than usual. She didn't say anything as he approached her. She stared down on the piano keys. Dick pulled her into a hug. She didn't react but her tears started to trickle down her cheeks. She started to come back to her senses. She slowly wrapped her arms around him, gripping onto his strong arms. \"I'm sorry…\" he whispered. \"Everything's going to be okay… I promise.\" Bruce came in with Shirley and Max. The man squatted in front of her. He flashed out a smile. Daphne wrapped her arms around his neck. He wrapped his arms around her waist as he stood up. He made sure that she was comfortable in his embrace. \"I'll never let you go, Daphne,\" Bruce assured her. \"She's dead… I have no sister anymore…\" she sobbed. \"I have no sister…\" Bruce rubbed her back as comfort. Dick patted her head to comfort her. Max and Shirley turned to each other before looking at the girl in Bruce's arms. They didn't know what to say to comfort her. Dick and Bruce looked at each other. Dick sighed. Daphne gripped onto Bruce's suit tighter. She was still sobbing. Tiara came in. \"Lunch is served. Most of the people have gone back,\" she reported. Daphne glanced up at her. She gave a small nod. Tiara smiled before exiting the room. Bruce put Daphne down. She looked at all of the people in front of her. Shirley pulled her into a hug. Daphne returned it. She turned to Max who flashed an apologetic smile. She nodded again with a faint smile. Dick and Bruce were glad that she was able to smile again. They decided to have lunch with her. Dick scooped the girl into his arms as they walked to the dining room. \"My, my, you sure are spoilt, Miss Daphne,\" Alfred remarked. \"He's my big brother after all,\" she replied. Alfred nodded. They all sat down to eat. Mana and Tiara were still entertaining the guests. Shirley and Max started to tell Daphne about school while she was away. \"Most of the bullies lost their purpose when you went away,\" Shirley said, chuckling. \"Yeah, they don't have anyone to pick on,\" Max agreed. Daphne flashed a smile and nodded. \"I appreciate your company everyone…but I want to be alone for a while…\" she muttered so suddenly. The others turned to look at each other. They thought that they had made progress in cheering her up. Daphne's body trembled for mere seconds. She excused herself after that, with another smile on her face. Shirley sighed, sad that she wasn't able to cheer her up. Max comforted her by placing a hand on her shoulder. Alfred could feel the tension in the room. \"Don't worry. We should just give her time,\" he spoke up. \"Yeah, but how long?\" Dick muttered, sighing. All of them ate quietly after that. All they could think about was how to cheer Daphne up because her sister and her company were no more. Raven and Damian waited for their turn to train. Damian was staring at something in his hand. It was a ring left beside his sword. He knew it was from Daphne but he wondered what it was for. Raven kept on stealing glances at the boy. \"You didn't tell her,\" she abruptly spoke up. \"I told you I don't know how to tell her,\" Damian replied, putting the ring away. \"She deserves to know, Damian,\" Raven said. \"Raven, come on up!\" Garfield called. Raven held Damian's hands in hers. \"Go…see her,\" she muttered. Damian blinked. Raven started to train with the rest of the team. Starfire decided to take a break. She caught a glimpse of Damian's confused face. Her lips curved into a smile. \"I let you go if you want,\" she said, catching his attention. He turned to her and shook his head. \"No. I want to stay. I'm a titan.\" \"If you say so...\" the young woman said, walking away. Jaime called Damian to join their training. He unsheathed his sword and ran up to them with a smile. They started to train together with Raven and Garfield. After three hours of gruesome training, they decided to take a rest. All of them went back to their rooms. Damian changed into his casual clothes and lied down in his bed, staring at the ring yet again. It was his size but he was still confused why Daphne had left it. Was it really for him? \"Daphne...\" he muttered. \"You missed her, huh?\" Jaime startled him. \"Can't you knock first?\" he shot a glare. \"Yeah, whatever,\" Jaime chuckled. Damian looked away. He was not in the mood to deal with anything at. Jaime smiled at the boy. It was his first time seeing Damian so troubled. He is always the calm type. Even when Raven was taken away during Trigon incident, he didn't panic. When Daphne felt ill, Jaime caught him once in a while, standing in front of the girl's door and hesitating whether to go in or not but his calm expression never leaves his face. When Daphne was almost hit by a car when chasing off a burglar, he looked as if he would kill the driver but he didn't show it at all. He knows how to keep his composure and calm himself. \"I've never seen you like this before...\" he muttered. \"You knew...that she was planning to leave?\" the boy asked. \"Yeah. Starfire let her. I'm just her loyal listener. She's not the type to open up to people...like you, I guess?\" Jaime shrugged. Damian shot another glare and then, sighed. He showed the ring to Jaime. Jaime recognized it because Daphne was wearing a matching one. He told Damian that it was from her sister. \"I see... That sister of hers is up to something again. It's good that she went back,\" Damian remarked. \"Oh...are they always like this? Daphne did tell me that her sister is quite intelligent,\" Jaime asked. Damian nodded and said, \"One time that sister of hers made her put on a dress to impress me.\" \"She's good...\" Jaime muttered, smiling. Garfield interrupted their conversation. \"We're going out for dinner. Get ready,\" he said. Damian and Jaime nodded. Garfield raised a brow at the ring Damian was holding. He shrugged and then, went back to his room. Jaime excused himself too. Damian blinked a few times, thinking of what to do with the ring. He went to change his clothes. Once he was done, he went down to the garage where everyone was waiting for him. Raven was the first to notice what was on his finger. \"Is that a ring?\" she asked. He shut his eyes and replied, \"It was a gift.\" \"Who knew you're the type to accessorize?\" Garfield joked. Damian shot a glare. Starfire came in her casual clothes. She shook her head at Damian and Garfield's behaviour. She started the car as they got in. \"Where are we going?\" Damian asked. \"We thought of eating pizza tonight,\" Garfield said. \"We ate pizza yesterday…\" Jaime complained. \"We're going to eat properly and healthily as requested by Daphne,\" Starfire explained. \"But, she's not here to lecture us about food anymore,\" Gar complained. \"Yes, but she's still in our heart,\" Raven muttered. The others were taken aback by her words. They put on a dejected look after that. Garfield looked away and so did Jaime. Damian stared at his palms because he was sitting between the two boys and didn't know where else to look. Raven looked out through the window from her seat. Starfire focused on driving. Deep down, all of them actually missed the orange haired girl. Daphne woke up one morning with another headache. She didn't like it one bit. Mana came in to inform that Dick, Bruce, and Arnold were here to discuss some things with her. She nodded to her. She got out of bed and got ready to meet them. Mana made her bed as Daphne exited the room in a t-shirt and sweatpants. She went to the living room where they were waiting for her. \"Daphne, so good to see you again,\" Dick said to the girl. She flashed a smile, turning to Arnold, \"Is something wrong?\" Arnold turned to Bruce. The man took out the envelope addressed to Daphne. The girl took it with a confused expression. She opened it to read the contents. \"Your sister handed the company over to me,\" Bruce started. \"She told me to take you in as my sister,\" Dick said. \"The man that killed Miss Delphinium...he doesn't know about you. It's better for you to keep yourself hidden, so I suggested to her to keep you under Grayson's care,\" Arnold explained. \"She kept me a secret?\" Daphne muttered. Arnold nodded and said, \"Yes. If he had known about you, you would be killed as well. She wanted you to keep living.\" Daphne shook her head. She kept on reading her sister's final letter. The letter was full of explanation of what was happening while she was away and before she went away. Her sister told her about a man named Rick who was their father's best friend after Slade. She added about her wish for Wayne Enterprise to take over the company because the Aldrin family was declared bankrupt when Daphne was away. She explained that Rick had been bribing their partners and shareholders to withdraw from the contract. Daphne's eyes widened in disbelief. Shaking her head, she turned to Bruce and asked, \"My sister handed over the company to you?\" \"Yes. You can have it once you turn 18,\" he explained. \"That is if you fulfil her request...\" Dick said. \"Her request?\" Daphne turned to look at Dick. \"She wanted me to take you under my wing,\" Bruce explained. \"Yes, you will be working with Mr. Wayne, that is if you agreed,\" Arnold explained. \"Miss Delphinium only wished for your safety.\" \"You mean I have to live with Master Bruce and work as his maid again?\" she asked, confused. Arnold nodded. He showed her the explanation in Delphinium's letter. She read it out. It was understandable why her sister would do such a thing. The man that killed her was smarter than her. Sooner or later, he would find out about Daphne. Their only hope was to delay the time when he would kill her. Plus, she is Phoenix and that could give her away as well. She closed the letter and put it back into the envelope. \"Very well, I will do as she asked. I will leave this house and live with you again, Master Bruce,\" she said with a smile. \"It has been two weeks since she died. I will only return to this house on the date that she died.\" Smiling, Bruce and Dick nodded to her declaration. That very same day, Tiara and Mana went away after dropping Daphne off at Wayne Manor. The woman who they met that one day, wanted to see them. They bowed to the woman when they saw her. She was chilling out on her balcony, looking at the ocean. Tiara had reported to her about Delphinium's letter to Daphne and the rest of them. Mana was busy cleaning up her room. The woman smiled and nodded to Tiara's stories. \"I see she's up on her feet again…\" she muttered. \"Yes, Miss… What would you like us to do?\" Tiara asked. \"Tiara, I would like you to search for this man. Hunt him down and bring him to me,\" the woman ordered. \"But, that's just too dangerous!\" Mana exclaimed. The woman turned to Mana. \"Don't worry. I'm asking her because I trust her, Mana.\" Mana looked away, mumbling, \"But still…\" The woman looked at them back and forth, saying, \"You two are my best of the best friends. We grew up together, we know each other's weaknesses and we support each other till now. If it weren't for the two of you, I might be dead.\" Mana and Tiara smiled to the woman. She heaved a sigh of relief. Then, she turned to Mana. \"I would like you to keep an eye on Daphne and Daphne's home. Make sure no one knows about the place and her, of course,\" the woman said. \"Understood,\" Mana nodded. \"I will need your progress report every week. Inform me if there is any trouble regarding her…\" the woman said. Mana and Tiara nodded. \"As you wish, Miss…\" Daphne stared at her reflection in the mirror. She was wearing a black suit and a matching black flare A-line skirt. Inside was a simple white blouse. Her hair was cut into a classic bob. It was a new look for her. Alfred came in to check up on her. She spun around in front of him. \"Well? How do I look?\" she asked. \"Exquisite, Miss Daphne. Come along now, Master Bruce is waiting to have breakfast with you,\" Alfred replied. \"I'm nervous…\" she muttered. Alfred flashed a smile as he approached her. \"You'll be fine,\" he whispered in her ears. After breakfast, Bruce and Daphne headed straight to his main office. The reconstruction of the Aldrin building had already begun under Bruce's request. The person in charge was Luke Fox, also known as Batwing. \"I wanted to make you my secretary but the boards didn't approve of that,\" Bruce started. \"Oh, I'm okay with anything you and the boards want me to do. I'm only here because my sister asked me to be,\" she said. \"Don't say that. I love having you around here,\" he reassured her. Daphne smiled sweetly at her boss. Bruce told her that she would be a clerk on his floor. Her job is to run errands for people of the floor. Daphne was more than happy to be doing it. It would help her to stay in shape as well. \"So, your job officially starts today. This is your desk, quite near to my office,\" Bruce explained, glancing up at the door a few feet behind him. Daphne nodded. \"I will do my best, Mr. Wayne…\" she bowed to him. Bruce patted her head with a smile. The girl was back to her old self and he was glad. He wondered how his son was doing with the Teen Titans. Daphne took a sit on her chair. She suddenly decided to look around and introduce herself. \"What plans do you have in stored for me, Delphinium…\" she muttered to herself.[Chapter 28] Here you are, Chapter 28! In the next chapter, Daphne will know who the woman is. Stay tuned! Do leave a review! - ( 8/8/2016 ) Chapter 28: Tiara snuck into one of Rick's subordinates' office. She was searching for information about Rick and Daphne's father. She found an envelope with Rick's name on it in a handwriting she recognized. Before she could open it, she heard footsteps and people talking so she rushed to hide in the darkness. Two men came in. \"Are you sure you don't want to report this to the boss?\" the first man asked. \"Not yet. I want to see how she handles this situation,\" the second one said. \"Huh…? I know this voice…\" Tiara whispered to herself. \"Why are you trying your best to ruin the Aldrin family?\" the first one asked. \"I am simply trying to help boss. That is all,\" the second one replied. Tiara silently growled. They started telling each other their plans to get rid of Daphne and shockingly, Rick as well. She slipped out of the locker after they had left. She had recorded the whole conversation. \"I have to warn Mana and Miss…\" she said, running into the forest nearby. She made her way back to the mansion. The woman was waiting for her, playing with her cats. She had seven of them. Tiara watched as they backed away when she approached the woman. \"Any leads?\" she asked Tiara. \"Yes. I found out Arnold is one of Rick's men,\" Tiara explained, handing the woman the recording. \"Hmmm…do not speak about me to Arnold. Tell Mana this as well. I want to see how far he will go in helping Rick and lying to Daphne. Bring him to me if he ever tries to harm her,\" the woman ordered. \"As you wish, Miss…\" Tiara nodded. \"I wish to meet Daphne soon as well,\" the woman muttered. \"You should attend Delphinium's death anniversary,\" Tiara suggested. The woman hummed and replied, \"I shall think about it.\" Tiara went back to Aldrin manor after that. Mana was busy watering the plants in the lawn. She smiled at Tiara as a greeting. Tiara started telling her what she had found. \"I can't believe Arnold is one of them!\" Mana exclaimed angrily. \"Yes. He's very good at hiding it. No wonder Miss Delphinium knew nothing about the bombs,\" Tiara remarked. \"I feel kind of bad because I was the one who introduced him to her…\" Mana said sadly. Tiara hugged her best friend. \"It's not your fault. It was hard to see through that innocent eyes of him,\" she said. Mana nodded. Silence filled the air for a few minutes. Mana suddenly remembered something to inform Tiara. \"Miss Daphne came by and asked if the preparations for Miss Delphinium's death anniversary are done,\" she said. \"Are they?\" Tiara asked. Mana nodded. \"Yes. One thing is left on the list…inviting the Teen Titans.\" \"That's going to be a little hard since Miss Daphne only wants Starfire and Blue Beetle to come…\" Tiara remarked. Mana nodded, agreeing with her partner. Silent filled the atmosphere. The breeze gently brushed against the two. Mana fixed her hair. Tiara looked up to the sky. Both of them were wearing a smile. \"It has been a year…\" Tiara muttered, sighing. \"Yes…one year she had left us…\" Mana replied, sighing too. Tiara excused herself to head to her room to change her clothes. Doing a spy work in broad daylight was not her style but it was what asked by her best friend. Mana went in to prepare something to eat. Daphne was busy sorting out some papers when Bruce's secretary smashed her hand at her desk. She was surprised, suddenly letting go her hold on the papers in her hands. It scattered onto the floor. She widened her eyes. \"I need you to type this out and send it to Mr. Wayne immediately!\" she ordered. Daphne glanced up at the secretary's gleaming eyes. Sighing, she replied, \"Yes…okay…\" The secretary huffed and chuckled to herself. She walked away, looking satisfied. Daphne sighed. She collected the papers scattered on the floor, placed it on the side of her desk and went on to do what the secretary had asked her. Some of Bruce's workers didn't like looking at her relationship with him, so they would bully her and push her to do works beyond her limits. Daphne didn't mind as she knew her place all too well. She didn't want to create problems for Bruce, so she never reported any problems to him. Whenever he asked, she would flash a smile and say that everything was okay. Shirley and Max paid a visit to Daphne at the office that day. Bruce didn't mind at all. They were waiting for her to finish up her work. They wanted to invite her to hang out with them. \"I'm not dressed for such an occasion,\" Daphne said. \"Oh, come on! It's just dinner!\" Shirley complained. \"Yeah, we made a reservation for you!\" Max added. Daphne sighed at her two best friends. She smiled and gave in to their pleas. The two cheered. Shirley pulled Daphne into a hug. The girl knew why they were doing this. It was her birthday that day. Bruce knew and he had gotten her a necklace with a kitten locket. She put it on the moment she got it. Alfred had baked her favorite cake for her to devour for the rest of the week. \"Let's get going then,\" Max said. \"I'll drive you there,\" Bruce said. The three nodded to him. Bruce was glad that Daphne was having a good time with her friends. He suddenly wondered how his son was doing with the Teen Titans. It had been three weeks since his last contact with Damian. He wondered how the boy was doing. Daphne was staring at the ring Delphinium had given her. \"Master Damian…\" Bruce heard her muttered. The man flashed a smile at her words. Daphne kissed the ring and held it close to her chest. Bruce rubbed the girl's shoulder to comfort her. Shirley and Max exchanged a look. She shrugged while Max looked down at his hands. They missed him too. \"I got your back!\" Raven assured Damian as she blocked an attack from Garfield. They were doing an evening sparring together and against each other one day. Damian jumped away when Garfield attempted to charge at him in his rhinoceros form. Raven backed away, deciding to watch them spar instead of joining in. Damian was already sweating but Garfield wasn't having a hard time at all. She secretly smiled at the two boys. Coincidently at the time, a letter came for Jaime. It was an invitation from Daphne. He scratched his head and decided to consult Starfire about it. \"Kori…we have a situation,\" he started when he popped his head by her door. \"What is it?\" Starfire asked. He showed her the invitation. She widened her eyes at it. Jaime asked whether he should go or not. The woman smiled, handing him back the invitation. \"Why not? I'll send you there,\" Starfire said. \"But…what about Gar, Raven, and Damian?\" Jaime asked, worried. \"I'll handle them,\" she muttered, glancing up at the confused Jaime, \"I'll drive you up first thing in the morning.\" Jaime obliged. He went back to his room after that. He bumped into Damian and Raven who was busy discussing some things. They saw the sad look on his face. \"What's with him?\" Damian asked. \"I don't know. Something's happened maybe?\" Raven shrugged. Starfire exited her room looking as happy as always. She saw the two and smiled. She went up to them. They immediately stopped their discussion and turned to look at her. \"I need the two of you to run an errand for me tomorrow,\" she started. \"What errand?\" Damian asked. \"It's nothing hard. I just need you to buy some groceries and pick some things up,\" she explained. Raven and Damian turned to look at each other before turning back to Starfire. Shrugging, the hooded girl said, \"Sure I guess…\" \"Great! Thank you very much!\" Starfire said, delighted. Damian and Raven were confused as to why they were the ones who had to do it. They didn't ask many questions, though. They started walking to the kitchen. \"Are you going to visit her anytime soon?\" Raven asked Damian. \"I'm sure she's fine,\" Damian muttered. \"You're still wearing the ring,\" the girl said to him. \"It's a gift from her and the only memento, after all…\" he replied. \"Do you…really like her?\" she suddenly asked. Damian stopped walking. He turned to look at Raven who was avoiding his eyes. She didn't want him to think she was jealous. She was just concerned about him and Daphne. Damian pondered for two minutes, trying to get his thoughts straight. \"I do...I guess…\" he muttered, scrunching his face angrily, \"I don't know!\" Raven was surprised at his outburst. He took a deep breath and regained his composure. He apologized and left her after that. She was still surprised at how messed up the boy was. Her lips curved into a smile. She was glad that Damian's feelings for Daphne never died even though they had been separated for a year. Daphne was wearing a black halter dress and black high heels. She greeted another guest which claimed to have known her sister. She had asked Tiara and Mana to distribute the invitations secretly with the help of everyone around her. She didn't want this occasion to reach Rick's ears. Tiara made sure that Arnold didn't know as well because there was a chance that the woman would show up. She and Mana were busying themselves with the food. Daphne had organized a dinner to thank the people who had come. \"So, what did you tell Miss Daphne?\" Mana asked. \"I told her Arnold couldn't make it...\" Tiara replied, grinning sheepishly. Tiara had taken the obligation to inform Bruce and Dick about the new threat. The two made sure that Arnold would have a hard time contacting Daphne, but not too hard because they didn't want him to know that they were onto him. Daphne came by to the kitchen to help them out. \"Master Bruce are entertaining the guests. They're asking what will become of the new Aldrin building,\" she sighed. Tiara and Mana nodded. They let her help them. They knew that the building made her remember her precious sister. Delphinium may have given her some bad times but she is her sister and no matter what, Daphne would love her. Daphne started to wash the vegetables that were going to be made into salads. \"Miss Daphne,\" Alfred called when she was busy. She turned around to see Alfred with two other people. She widened her eyes in disbelief. She was touched that they could make it. Starfire and Jaime stood at the door to the kitchen. Daphne rushed to hug them. Kori hugged her back but Jaime found it to be awkward. He was never hugged by a girl before. \"I missed you guys...\" she sobbed. She pulled away, looking at the two. Jaime smiled at her. Starfire patted her head a few times. \"I'm only here to drop off Jaime. I'll pick him up tomorrow,\" Starfire explained. \"Yeah. Or else Gar would be asking questions again,\" Jaime continued the explanation. Daphne nodded. \"I understand. Take care, Kori...\" Starfire nodded. Tiara handed her a goodie bag full of souvenirs. The woman took it and went on her way again. Daphne showed Jaime to the living room. All eyes were on them as they approached Bruce. The man was surprised to see Blue Beetle, dressed formally for an occasion with his usually visible scarab on his back. \"So glad you could make it. Daphne did mention that she invited you,\" Bruce said. \"Yeah. I used to be her loyal listener back at the tower,\" the boy explained. \"She must love having you here then,\" the man remarked. Daphne pulled Jaime to meet her two best friends, Shirley and Max. The boy was nervous to see more people of his age. \"These two are my best companions in school,\" Daphne explained. \"Glad to finally meet her best listener,\" Max said to him. \"Always a pleasure to meet new people...\" Jaime muttered. \"Well, how do you find Daphne to be?\" Shirley asked. \"She's a very caring and kind girl...always thinks about others' needs before hers,\" Jaime replied. \"Sounded just like our Daphne,\" Dick interrupted. All four turned to him. Daphne hugged him lovingly. He replied with a pat on the head. Shirley and Max decided to have some snacks and left the three to chat. \"Nightwing, right?\" Jaime asked. \"It's so hard to hide my identity now that I have a sister...\" Dick remarked. \"I just figured...the way she acts around you...\" Jaime said, smiling at Daphne. Daphne flashed a smiled too. Dick started telling Jaime about how Daphne ended up under Bruce's wing. Jaime told him about how Daphne was at the tower. The girl decided to excuse herself and head to the music room to be alone. She sat down by the piano. She started playing a melody. It was the first one that Delphinium has taught her. \"I miss you...\" she whispered and bit her lower lip. \"That is a nice melody...\" a voice said. Daphne's eyes widened. She froze on the spot. The woman smiled at her reaction. She sat down by the window, waiting for Daphne to turn around. Daphne did, slowly. When she saw the woman, she was even more shocked. \"Huh?\" she muttered. \"I should introduce myself...\" she smiled at the girl.[Chapter 29] Hey, guys! Sorry for the long wait! I have good news and bad news. The good news is that we are going to find out who the woman is! The bad news is that this story is coming to an end. Sooooooooonnnnnnnn. Hehe Anyway, no need to worry and just keep reading! Thank you! - ( 8/13/2016 ) Chapter 29: Daphne stared at the woman in front of her. The woman had the same orange hair and brown eyes as her. Daphne saw her as the adult version of herself. The woman suddenly pulled her into a hug. She rested her chin on Daphne's head. The girl was still stunned and surprised that she didn't react at all. \"Miss Daphne…\" Tiara called, popping her head at the door. Daphne turned to her with a confused look. The woman smiled at Tiara as she bowed to her as a greeting. She went up to the woman. \"I didn't know you've arrived,\" she said. \"I wanted to surprise little Daphne,\" the woman explained. \"Tiara, who is this?\" Daphne asked. Tiara turned to her young mistress, glancing up at the woman at times. The woman rested her right hand on her hip, still smiling. She took out a card for Daphne. \"When you're ready to hear everything, Tiara and Mana will send you to meet me,\" she explained, handing her the card. Daphne looked at the name written on the card. She widened her eyes in disbelief. The woman's surname was the same as hers. Who is she? \"I'll be heading back now. Say hello to Mr. Wayne and Grayson for me,\" the woman said to Tiara. \"As you wish, Miss,\" Tiara replied. She patted Daphne's head before exiting the manor. Daphne turned to Tiara in disbelief. Her eyes were not even blinking. \"Who…is she?\" she asked. \"All will be answered soon, Miss Daphne. Right now, you have a dinner to attend,\" Tiara reminded her. \"R-Right…\" Daphne muttered, following her maid to the dining room. The guests were already seated. They stood up when Daphne entered. The girl flashed a sweet and nodded to all of her guests. She gave a small speech. They started to eat after that. Tiara, Mana, and Alfred ran around the dining room, making sure all of the guests were well-served. Jaime sat beside Daphne. He felt awkward being in such an occasion, but Daphne and her friends made him feel welcomed. \"Where are you staying tonight?\" Daphne asked. \"Well, Grayson is supposed to send me back tomorrow, so maybe at his place?\" Jaime replied, shrugging. \"Why don't you stay here? I have a day off tomorrow. We can hang around and then, I'll tag along when Master Dick wants to send you back,\" Daphne suggested. \"That would be great!\" Jaime replied, excited. Damian and Raven came back from their errand just as Starfire parked the car. Raven was holding three paper bags while Damian was holding four paper bags full of groceries and kitchenware. She flashed a smile when she saw them. The two blinked in confusion at their leader. \"How's everything?\" she asked, grabbing a paper bag from Raven to ease her burden. \"Well…this is a lot of shopping you made us do,\" Damian complained. \"Garfield went to investigate a new case while we were away. I don't think he's back yet…\" Raven explained. \"I see…\" Starfire muttered. They got to the kitchen. Raven and Starfire started to arrange the groceries and ingredients that the two had bought. Damian decided to rest in his room. When she is sure Damian had exited the place, she stared at Starfire. \"What?\" the woman asked. \"You're wearing a black dress. Where were you?\" she asked. Starfire smiled and sighed. She whispered, \"To be honest, I went to visit Daphne with Jaime. I left him there…\" Raven blinked in confusion. She asked, \"Why?\" \"Her sister died last year…\" Starfire replied, sadly looking down at the floor. \"Why didn't you tell him?\" Raven demanded. \"Daphne asked us to keep it a secret…\" the leader of the team said. \" There were a few explosions at the Aldrin building. Your sister was there when it happened…\" Bruce explained. \" Did she make it out?\" Daphne asked. Bruce looked away from the girl. He slowly shook his head. Daphne fell to her knees. Starfire rushed up to her. She wrapped her arms around the girl as comfort. Daphne bit her lip as tears started to fall down her cheeks. \" I'm really sorry, Daphne…but you need to get back fast. Mana and Tiara are planning her funeral,\" Bruce said softly to the girl. Daphne nodded. She stood up and turned to her two friends. Jaime and Starfire gazed at her face. \" Please, don't tell the others about this. Master Damian has been doing great. I don't want him to shift his attention back to me…\" she requested. \" Okay, we promise…\" Starfire said as Jaime nodded. Daphne forced a smile. She hugged Starfire and shook hands with Jaime. Then, she hopped into the Batmobile. Bruce nodded to the two before they started off to head back. Jaime and Starfire looked at each other. They sighed. \" I wonder... How would Damian react if he knows?\" Jaime muttered. \" Over the past few days, he hadn't been nice to her. I don't think he would care…unlike Garfield,\" Starfire remarked. \" I guess…\" the boy sighed, staring at the sky. \"So…why are you telling me now?\" Raven asked. Starfire handed her an envelope. \"It was in the goodie bag she gave to me,\" she explained. Raven stared at the envelope. She opened it. It was a simple note addressed to her. There was an email address. \"She wants to keep in touch with me…\" the girl muttered. \"That's great! You are her age, so you two can be great friends,\" Starfire exclaimed. Raven gave out a small smile, muttering, \"I guess so…\" Meanwhile, Damian was tossing and turning in bed, trying to shake off his thoughts about Daphne. His was happy with the Titans. He wanted to stop thinking about her for the time being. He was sure that he wasn't ready to face his true feelings even though every time Garfield brought her up as a topic, Damian would shot a death glare. He stared at the ring he was wearing. He groaned. \"Yo, Damian!\" Garfield called out from his room. \"What?\" Damian asked in irritation. \"Let's have a little sparing,\" the boy invited. \"I'm not in the mood…\" Damian sighed. \"Aww…come on!\" Gar barged into his room. Damian shot a glare and asked, \"Can't you knock first?\" \"Heh…as if you don't know me,\" he replied casually. Damian huffed angrily. He stood up, scratching the back of his head. Garfield smirked. They went to the training grounds. Daphne kept on thinking about the woman and staring at the card. Tiara and Mana were busy cleaning up the manor after the event. Jaime was helping them. The two maids took a glimpse at their young mistress. Tiara turned to Mana who shook her head. Daphne had to make the decision on her own. \"I'm going to take a bath,\" Jaime announced. \"Oh! I'll show you where the guest room is,\" Mana volunteered. She gestured Jaime to follow her. The boy took a glance at Daphne before following the maid. Daphne stood up, approaching Tiara. \"Hmm? Is something wrong, Miss?\" Tiara asked. \"I…I want to meet this woman,\" Daphne spoke up. Tiara smiled and nodded. \"Okay. After we send Master Jaime back, we'll go meet her.\" Daphne nodded. She excused herself to take a rest. Tiara went to her room once the dishes were done. She put on her uniform to continue her spying job that night. Her communicator started to ring. \"How is she?\" the woman's voice came. \"Mana and I will send her to meet you tomorrow night,\" Tiara explained. \"I can't wait…\" the woman chuckled. Tiara sighed. She exited the manor once she was sure Jaime and Daphne were fast asleep. Mana busied herself, getting things ready for tomorrow night. Morning came and Jaime woke up a little late. Daphne was waiting to have breakfast with him. Tiara was still sleeping, exhausted from last night. Mana served the food and took her seat beside Daphne. \"It has been a while since I ate your cooking,\" Jaime said. Smiling, Daphne replied, \"Which is why I cooked a lot, so eat up all you want!\" Jaime gobbled up the food in front of him: pancakes, scrambled eggs, bacon strips, bean sauce and much more. Daphne knew that he would manage to eat a lot considering he is a superhero as well. \"I've been meaning to ask…\" she started. \"Hmm? What is it? This scrambled egg is great by the way,\" Jaime replied. Daphne smiled and nodded. \"Does your scarab make you twice as hungry?\" The scarab made an unpleasant sound. Jaime laughed. He stopped gobbling up his food. He took a sip of his hot milk. \"Well, sort of, I guess. I've been working as a superhero for quite some time already, so I've always been hungrier than usual,\" he explained. \"Hmmm…I see. I'm just curious,\" Daphne shrugged. After breakfast, Daphne showed Jaime around town with Shirley and Max's help. They took him to their favourite café, bookstore, souvenir shop and the park. Jaime enjoyed his time with them. Max helped take photographs as gifts for Jaime as well. \"Your friends are really nice,\" Jaime remarked. \"Thanks!\" Max and Shirley said in unison. \"Yeah, they are my best of the best friends after all,\" Daphne beamed. Jaime smiled. He patted the girl's head. Shirley and Max smiled at the two. It was time to send him back. Shirley and Max dropped them off at the Aldrin manor. Dick was already waiting for him. They went inside to change into their uniform. \"Put on your cape,\" Dick said to Daphne. \"Not gonna happen,\" Daphne puffed her cheeks. Dick chuckled, patting her head. Jaime came out in his uniform. \"I've already parked the Batmobile at the back,\" Dick explained. The two nodded. They boarded the Batmobile and off they went to the Titan Tower. Daphne was quiet during the whole journey. Jaime and Dick knew why. \"Are you nervous?\" Jaime asked. \"I think so… I mean, it has been a year since I left,\" Daphne muttered. They arrived at the tower. Raven and Starfire were waiting at the entrance. Starfire waved when she saw Daphne. The girl jumped out of the mobile, running up to the two. She hugged Raven who felt awkward. She replied with a pat on the back. \"How have you been?\" she asked the shorter girl. \"Good, I guess…\" Daphne replied. \"She's been moping around in the car, thinking about Damian,\" Dick spoke up and laughed. \"Master Dick!\" Daphne pouted. All of them laughed. Starfire invited them to have tea and take a rest before heading back to Gotham City. They took the offer. Jaime announced that he was going to take an afternoon nap. Daphne took off her mask as she sat down at the kitchen counter. Raven served her and Dick a cup of tea each. Dick took a sip of his tea now and then. He started to talk with Starfire, ignoring Raven and Daphne. \"So, how have you been?\" Daphne asked. \"Better,\" Raven replied, serving a plate of cookies next, \"I think I've become better at healing people as well.\" \"Really?\" the orange haired girl asked, eyes sparkling with excitement. Garfield and Damian came back from their morning training. Gar was delighted to see his crush again. \"Daphne!\" he said, running up to her. He attempted to hug her but Raven blocked him with her magic. The boy shot a glare at the smirking young witch. Damian went to the refrigerator to get a bottle of plain water. He was trying to ignore Daphne. The said girl was staring at him, hoping that he would take to her. \"Damian, don't you want to say something to her?\" Gar asked. Damian glanced up at the three before proceeding to the door. Garfield grew impatient of Damian's attitude towards Daphne. He ran up to the boy, stopping his action. \"What?\" Damian asked him, irritated. \"She's right in front of you! Say something!\" Garfield shouted angrily. \"It's okay, Garfield… It's my fault for coming here,\" Daphne stammered, earning everyone's attention. Dick disagreed. \"What are you saying, Daphne? It's not your fault you're here!\" \"Yeah!\" Garfield said, pointing and accusing finger at Damian, \"If it's anyone's fault, it should be his for not caring about you!\" \"Hey! I never asked her here!\" Damian shouted angrily. He stormed off out of the living room. Daphne looked sadly at the floor. She didn't how to react to what Damian had just said. All attention turned to her again. Dick reached out for her. She hid her face in his arms. \"I'll talk to him,\" Raven volunteered, rushing to Damian's room. \"M-Master Dick…I wanna go home…\" Daphne whispered. \"Yeah, okay,\" Dick said, turning to Starfire, \"I'm sorry I can't stay long.\" \"It's okay. I'm really sorry about Damian. I never thought he would act that way,\" Starfire replied. Dick nodded. He picked the girl up into his arms and exited the tower. Daphne fell asleep on the way back. When Dick got back to the manor, he carried her to her room. He informed Mana about what had happened. \"Thank you for bringing her home,\" Mana bowed to Dick. \"Yeah. Tell her I'm sorry,\" Dick replied. Mana nodded. When he went off, Daphne woke up. She took off her uniform. She changed into one of her dresses. She was getting ready to head out. \"Are you sure you're ready Miss? After all, Master Damian,\" Mana's words were cut off. \"I'll be fine. I'll forget him soon enough…\" Daphne muttered. Mana nodded to her words. Tiara came to fetch them in a car. Daphne was hesitant at first. Who was the woman? Why did she look like her? I have to find out! The orange haired woman waited for her three guests at the entrance of her manor. She smiled as Daphne stepped out of the car. \"Welcome, my dear,\" she greeted her. Mana and Tiara got out of the car as well. The stood behind Daphne and bowed to the woman. The woman nodded to them. She invited them into her home. Daphne refused to go inside. \"Explain to me now…please…\" the girl muttered. The woman smiled again. She went up to Daphne and squatted in front of her. Daphne noticed the locket of her necklace. \"I'll explain everything inside. I promised you that, remember?\" she said in a soft voice. Daphne nodded slowly. Tiara and Mana showed the girl to the living room. The woman was already waiting. Mana excused herself to go prepare some snacks for the two. \"Tiara will be taking care of you, Miss,\" she said to Daphne. \"I guess I should start…\" the woman said, sitting down on a sofa. \"Please do…\" Daphne muttered. The woman nodded. \"My name is Dahlia Aldrin and I am your eldest sister.\" \"My sister?\" the younger Aldrin was surprised. \"I was the one who sent you and Delphinium out. The parents that took care of you were paid by me. I told them to give you two a nurturing environment to live in. You were just a baby when they took you,\" Dahlia explained. \"Why? Why would you do that? Is the company a lie as well?\" Daphne asked. \"No. The company is rightfully ours. I let them borrow it until you turn 18. I didn't know that they had made another contract with Rick beforehand,\" the woman continued. Mana served a cup of tea for the two of them. She placed a plate of cookies and two slices of cake on the coffee table. \"Mana and Tiara are my best friends. They decided to help me after I found out about Rick. I sent them there after your 'parents' died. The rest of the event were planned by Delphinium by herself. She knew nothing about me and I told my friends to play along and give me progress reports once a month,\" Dahlia continued. \"Are you saying that we're your puppets?!\" Daphne shouted angrily. \"Of course, not. You two are my sisters, my flesh, and blood!\" Dahlia exclaimed, taking a deep breath to calm herself, \"I knew about Rick two years after I let you two go. By that time, I asked them to hand you two back to me, but they refused because our contract said that once your turn 18, then I can you and Delphinium back…\" Daphne was surprised. Tiara and Mana nodded to Dahlia's words. \"We tried everything as well, to help Miss Dahlia…\" Mana explained. \"We stayed there because we didn't want any harm to come to you two,\" Tiara was next to speak. \"When I found out that you move in with the Bat and Delphinium turned against you, I refrained from thinking about you. I believe you two can work it out…\" Dahlia continued. \"But, Delphinium died…\" Daphne sighed. \"Yes, but she left us with a very thorough plan to save the company. I am proud of her…and of you, for becoming a superhero and assisting Batman,\" Dahlia said. Daphne looked away from her gaze. Dahlia stood up, approaching the girl. She knelt down beside her, trying to meet her gaze. Daphne shut her eyes. Tiara and Mana glanced up at each other. They turned to watch the two siblings. \"Will you…ever forgive me for abandoning you and letting Delphinium die?\" Dahlia's voice cracked. Daphne bit her lower lip. She could see her sister's eyes welling up. She knew that Dahlia meant well. There must be a reason why she sent them away instead of taking care of them by herself. Everything happens for a reason after all. \"Yes…\" Daphne said. Dahlia pulled the girl into a hug. Daphne hid her face. She was crying again. She lost Delphinium but gained another sister. Fate had it worked out for her in the end. She hoped that Dahlia could stay with Dahlia from now on.[Chapter 30] Hey, guys! I'm uploading this chapter now since it's in my schedule. Yes, I have to have a schedule because of having too many stories. My plots are all jumbled up. Anyway, for this chapter, I put an exceptionally good number of DamianXDaphne moments. Enjoy! - ( 8/17/2016 ) Chapter 30: Damian was busy minding his own business when a knock on his door was heard. It was Jaime. \"Uh…you have to come to the living room…\" he said. The boy was confused but did as told. When he got there the monitor was on and Batman was on the other line. Starfire, Raven, and Garfield were there too. They turned to him as he walked up to them. He looked at all of them and then, at Batman. \"What seems to be the problem?\" he asked. \"I need you to come back,\" Batman started. \"Why? I'm a member of the Teen Titans. I'm not going back yet,\" Damian replied. \"Damian, listen to what he has to say,\" Starfire persuaded him. \"Yeah, Damian. Something has happened,\" Raven agreed with the leader. Damian sighed. He stared at the monitor. Batman nodded to him. \"You're seventeen now. I need you to come work with me,\" he explained. \"Why now?\" his son asked. \"There's someone you have to meet. It's important to me that you meet this person. I'll send Nightwing to pick you up tomorrow evening,\" Batman said. Damian could sense the dejection in his father's tone. He nodded. Batman nodded and ended the call. Starfire went up to him. \"I'm really sorry I didn't do anything to protest,\" she said to him. \"It's fine. I have an idea of what father's planning,\" Damian replied. \"You do?\" Jaime asked, surprised. Damian nodded. He looked at each of them before excusing himself to start packing. Starfire turned to Jaime. The boy shrugged. Only the two of them and Raven knew what happened to Daphne because they were the ones who sent her off that day while Raven was told by Starfire. \"Say, we haven't heard from Daphne at all…after that one time…\" Garfield suddenly spoke up. \"She must have her hands full now that she's working with Bruce Wayne,\" Jaime remarked. \"Yes. The last picture she sent was of her as his secretary,\" Raven said, showing the picture again. She smiled at it because, in the picture, Daphne looked happy and safe. Honestly speaking, Daphne had been secretly sending her emails about what she was doing over the past three years. Raven had been telling her about everyone at the tower in return. Since they shared the same interest, which is Damian's wellbeing, they maintained a good relationship with each other. While they were talking about Daphne, Damian busied himself packing up his belonging into his duffel bag. The ring he now wore as a locket sparkled, catching his attention. He gazed at it, thinking of the girl who had left him. He remembered the last time he had seen her which was two years ago when he suddenly shouted some words he never meant to. \"Two years…\" he muttered, remembering the scolding that Raven had given him after that. Raven stepped into Damian's room without his permission. Damian didn't look at her. He was staring at the ceiling. \" What do you want?\" he asked. \" She's here and that's how you greet her!\" Raven raised her voice. Damian turned his back to her, muttering, \"None of your business…\" Raven took a deep breath to calm herself before saying, \"It is my business. Daphne's my friend and if you want to treat her that way, I don't think I should be your friend anymore.\" The boy suddenly sat up. His eyes glimmered with anger. Raven was not intimidated by his glares. She was used to it. \" Why do you care?\" he asked. \" I don't like seeing her sad. I know you're confused but at least appreciate her presence. Who knows when you'll see her again,\" Raven explained, sighing. She exited the room before Damian could reply with more insulting words. Damian looked at his ring again. Did she notice he was wearing it? He heaved a sigh, lying down again. Daphne stared at what was at the foot of her bed. It was a near pair of black pump heels with little snowflakes decorating it. Bruce had gotten them for her. She groaned and sighed. \"Miss,\" Alfred came by. \"I have ironed your clothes.\" \"Thank you Alfred…\" she said, taking the white blouse and black skirt from him. Alfred nodded to her. He went to her wardrobe to grab her blazer. She went to the bathroom to change her clothes. Then, she took the blazer and put it on. She put on a red lipstick and a faint pink blush. She combed her shoulder length hair. The butler nodded, satisfied with her look that day. She put on the new heels with puffed cheeks because she didn't like heels. \"Today is a special day, Miss…\" Alfred said to her. \"I wonder what he's planning…\" the girl muttered. She rushed downstairs because Bruce was already honking. She got into the car with her handbag and briefcase. The man smiled at her. She flashed a smile too. He drove them to the office like always. \"Mr. Wayne, you have a visitor,\" the receptionist said. \"Is he in my office?\" he asked. The receptionist nodded. Daphne was confused when Bruce's lips curved into a broader smile. She shrugged it off and went straight to her office. She sat down and started her work like always. Suddenly, an intern barged into her office. \"Daphne! There's a really cute guy in Mr. Wayne's office!\" she exclaimed. \"Cute guy? Really?\" Daphne chuckled. \"Will you ask him who he is for me? I'll buy you a strawberry shortcake!\" the intern said. \"You know I can't say no to shortcakes, Faye,\" Daphne growled. The intern laughed. Faye is as old as Daphne but Daphne was taken in personally by Bruce and Faye was an approved intern who would be doing her internship for four months. Faye wanted to say something but Bruce suddenly asked for Daphne. Faye blinked cutely at Daphne to bribe her into doing what she had asked. The orange-haired girl shook her head at her actions. The intern giggled. Daphne excused herself to head to Bruce's room. Meanwhile, Bruce was smiling at his visitor who was looking around as if he hadn't stepped into the office before. \"Damian, welcome back,\" he welcomed his son. \"So...am I to work here?\" Damian asked coldly because he still disagreed with Bruce's decision. Before Bruce could answer, the door was knocked. A seventeen-year-old orange-haired girl came in. Bruce nodded to the girl. The girl took a glance at Damian before turning back to Bruce. \"You wanted to see me, Mr. Wayne?\" she asked. Upon hearing the voice, Damian turned to see who it was. His eyes widened in surprise. Bruce chuckled at his reaction. He stood up from his chair. \"Daphne, you remember my son?\" he turned to the girl. \"Daphne?\" Damian kept on staring at the girl in front of him. \"How can I ever forget...\" she flashed the sweetest smile Damian had ever seen. \" She's my servant?\" the boy asked, pointing an accusing finger towards her. Daphne was still smiling. She was happy to see him despite having the worst last encounter with him two years ago. She was glad that he had grown into a fine young man. Damian turned back to his father who nodded at his question. \"Miss Aldrin here will be your secretary from now on,\" Bruce explained. \"What?\" Damian and Daphne exclaimed in unison. Their eyes met for an instant before Daphne turned to look away. Bruce chuckled to himself. He didn't know what had happened between them, but he wanted them to be together again. Dahlia had explained everything to him and what she wanted her sister to become. \"Yes. Miss Aldrin will show you to your office,\" Bruce said. Daphne bit her lower lip. The man gestured her to come up to his desk. She did as told. She took the file her told her to. She found a note telling her where to escort Damian. Damian waited patiently for her. She turned to look at him. She tried to crack the best smile she could. \"Umm…please, follow me, sir,\" she said politely. Damian took one last look at his father. Daphne waited by the door. They went on their way once he was ready to go. Bruce smiled to himself. \"This will be interesting,\" he said. \"You think so?\" a familiar voice asked. Dahlia came out of her hiding spot. She crossed her arms in front of her chest and smirked. Bruce turned to her. \"I kind of do,\" the man said. Dahlia sighed. \"Still…she looked as if she couldn't accept the job,\" she remarked. \"We'll just see about that…\" the man muttered. Daphne and Damian stepped into the elevator. Daphne flipped through the file that Bruce had given to her. Damian didn't say anything, but he kept on stealing glances at Daphne. When the elevator and the doors slid open, Faye popped in front of them. \"Hey!\" she shouted excitedly. \"Wahh!\" Daphne was startled, losing her stance. She toppled backward. Damian unconsciously caught her before she met the ground. Their eyes met yet again but this time, it was Damian who looked away. Daphne stood back up. \"T-Thanks…\" she muttered, faintly blushing. \"Daphne! He's the cute guy!\" Faye exclaimed. \"Cute guy?\" Damian was confused. Daphne turned to Damian and sighed. \"Yes, well, he's Mr. Wayne's ward…\" \"Ooooh!\" Faye cooed. She circled Damian, eyes sparkling with excitement. Damian's eyes followed her every movement. Daphne slapped herself on the forehead, sighing. Faye followed them as they walked up to Damian's office. She was eager to get to know the newcomer. Daphne smiled at her actions. \"Can you watch her for a while? I need to go get my stuff,\" Daphne said, before exiting the office. \"I'm Faye, by the way,\" the intern introduce herself. \"Hmm…Damian Wayne,\" Damian muttered. \"So, so, are you going to work here from now on? I'm just an intern but I'd be glad to assist you,\" Faye chirped. Damian raised a brow at the girl in front of him. She is a little taller than Daphne. Her eagerness was annoying him, but he kept it cool. Daphne came back after a few minutes. Faye rushed to help her out. Her hands were full of binders and files she had picked up from her old office. They placed them all onto a large desk on the right of Damian's office. \"So, what are we doing?\" Faye asked. \"You're going to take my old job from now on,\" Daphne said to the girl. Faye brightened up, asking, \"Really?\" Daphne smiled and nodded. \"Apparently, that's what Mr. Wayne informed me. I have a new job…\" she muttered. \"A new job?\" the intern blinked in confusion. \"Yes…as Master Damian's secretary,\" Daphne sighed. \"Awww…you're so lucky,\" Faye sighed, dragging herself to the door, \"Well, I'll be redecorating your old office then…\" \"Okay…\" the orange haired replied with a smile. Faye exited the office and went back to their floor. Daphne turned to Damian who was just staring at her. She flashed a smile. \"So…you're basically my servant again?\" he asked. \"Sort of…I'll be helping you out with your work here. I am your secretary and your personal assistant. Well, at least that's what Master Bruce's note said, she explained, sighing. She gestured him to his desk which had a computer and a keyboard on it. She switched it on and three hologram screens popped up as well. Damian went to sit on his chair. She started clicking on some icons. Turning back to him, she explained, \"Basically, you'll be monitoring our pharmaceutical branch from here. You'll be visiting the other office once a month, following Mr. Wayne's schedule.\" \"Where's the real office?\" Damian asked. \"Aldrin building is the real office,\" Daphne muttered. \"Aldrin?\" the boy sounded surprised. Daphne nodded as she walked back to her desk. She started to rearrange her things. Damian ignored her and started to do some research on his father's company. The girl took a glimpse of him and exited the office. She came back after a few minutes. Damian was taken by surprised when she placed a cup of warm coffee onto his desk. He stared at her face. Smiling, she said, \"I thought you'd like some. If you have any question, feel free to ask me.\" She went back to her desk and switched her laptop on. She started typing some things on it. She was dissolved in her work within seconds. Damian kept on stealing glances at her. She wasn't that different. She still had her sweet innocent face and large eyes. Her body was taller and a little bit more daring in his opinion. Men would fall for her in one look. She was still short, only at his shoulders' height. Damian had grown quite a bit as well. He maintained his slim body but it was a bit toned around the arms and chests. He didn't want to look exactly like his father…just yet. He is only seventeen at the time, the same age as Daphne. On the other hand, Daphne knew that he was staring a few times, but she ignored him. She was still hurt by what he had said two years ago. He never apologized and suddenly, here he was right in front of her, acting all cool like always. She didn't like it one bit. \"Why did Master Bruce put me under him…? Did Sis Dahlia asked him to?\" she mumbled to herself. Evening came at last. Daphne had promised Shirley and Max to hang out with them. She changed her high heels with her favorite sneakers. Bruce was waiting for her at the entrance. Her two best friends were already there as well. Damian followed her from behind. \"Sorry to keep you guys waiting,\" Daphne apologized. \"That's okay,\" Shirley said, turning her gaze to Damian, \"It has been a while, Damian.\" \"Yeah, it's been long!\" Max said, punching Damian's arm playfully. Bruce smiled at all of them. \"So, where's your briefcase and the high heels? I'll take it back with me,\" he said to Daphne. She nodded. She ran up to his car to put her belongings in there. Bruce turned to Damian who was staring at Max and Shirley. He couldn't believe his eyes that they still keep in contact with Daphne all this time. \"Why don't you go with them, Damian?\" Bruce suggested. \"No thanks, I don't have anything to wear…\" Damian replied coldly. \"I brought a spare t-shirt if you want to come with us,\" Max suddenly said. \"We already knew that you'd be coming back today,\" Shirley explained. Daphne rushed up to her two best friends. She stopped when she saw what Damian was wearing. It was a black t-shirt and an orange hoodie. He was wearing a pair of jeans instead of his slack. He didn't look happy. Max and Shirley stifled their giggles. \"Well, since we're all ready now, let's get going,\" Max said, pushing Damian from behind. Shirley and Daphne got in the car too. Shirley looked at the two, smiling teasingly as they were sitting at the back. Max winked at his fiancée. Shirley stifled another giggle. Damian grunted which Daphne took as a sign to ignore him. She looked out through the window instead. \"So…where are we going tonight?\" Daphne asked. \"Karaoke!\" Shirley and Max exclaimed. \"Karaoke?\" Damian muttered in confusion. Daphne smiled at the boy. They soon reached a karaoke box where the couple would always drag Daphne to. Daphne and Shirley walked in, discussing what songs to sing. Damian was pulled in by Max. \"Do you always come here?\" Damian asked, looking around. \"Once a month with Daphne, all the time with Shirley,\" Max replied casually. \"Well, today is a special occasion,\" Shirley added, winking at her fiancé. They rented a room for two hours. Shirley and Max would always start with their favorite duet song. Daphne was usually the spectator. Damian sipped on his tea as he watched them. \"Your turn, girlfriend,\" Shirley said, handing Daphne the mike. Daphne took it and stood up. She started to sing the song that the couple had chosen for her. It was a love song she loves to hum and sing. A blush crept onto her face at the thought of Damian hearing her singing voice. Shirley and Max grinned as they watched Daphne danced to the song. Damian was amazed at her voice and dance move, but he acted cool and calm to hide his feelings. He knew her reason for putting on a pair of sneakers. Her face lit up with relief as she danced. Shirley stood up to join her. Max sat closer to Damian who was eating the chips they ordered. \"So, what do you think of Daphne?\" he asked Damian. The boy almost choked at the question. \"What do you mean?\" he asked. Max chuckled. \"Nothing at all…\" he replied. The next song was his song, so he stood up to sing. Shirley was the one sitting next to Damian. \"So, are you going to sing?\" Shirley asked him. \"No, I don't sing,\" Damian replied coldly. \"Awww…come on! Just one song!\" she half begged. Daphne blinked a few times as Damian ignored Shirley's request. The girl sipped on her orange juice as she stared at the boy. Shirley smiled. She decided to eat the chips instead. The next song was a song they had chosen for Damian. Max forcefully pulled Damian to sing with him. \"Come on!\" he said to the boy. Damian stared at his microphone and the screen simultaneously. Max beamed at his reaction. He sang the first verse. \"I've been looking under rocks and breaking locks, just trying to find you. I've been like a maniac, insomniac, five steps behind you.\" Damian awkwardly sang the next one as his friend elbowed him. \"Tell the other girls, they can…hit the exit. Check please? Cause I finally found the girl of my dreams. Much more than the Grammy awards, that's how much you mean to me?\" he stuttered. Daphne and Shirley stifled a giggle. Max laughed out loud, hurting his stomach. He couldn't continue singing after listening to Damian. Shirley burst out laughing too when she saw her fiancé's state. The both rolled on the floor, laughing hard. Damian grunted. He went to sit down after that. He read the lyrics on the screen, sipping on his tea again. The next song started to play. Daphne stood up to sing since her two best friends hadn't stopped laughing yet. \"You and I…we're like fireworks and symphonies exploding in the sky. With you, I'm alive, like all the missing pieces in my heart, they finally collide…\" she sang, taking a deep breath. Shirley continued where she left off, \"So stop time right here in the moonlight, cause I don't ever want to close my eyes.\" Daphne smiled. \"Without you, I feel broke like I'm half of a whole. Without you, I've got no hand to hold. Without you, I feel torn like a sail in the storm… Without you, I'm just a sad song…\" she sang. After that song, there was a list of other songs Daphne was forced to sing. By the time they had ended their two hours, Daphne barely had her voice. Shirley told Damian that this would always happen. Damian raised a brow at his secretary. Daphne's lips curved into a small smile. Max and Shirley sent them back to Wayne Manor after having some light snack at their favorite bistro. \"Would you like me to clean up your room first?\" she asked Damian. \"No need. I'll ask Pennyworth to do it…\" he said, looking away from her. \"Okay…\" she replied sadly. She walked passed him to head to her room. Damian watched as her figure went out of his sight.[Chapter 31] Chapter 31: Daphne woke up early the next day. She took her bath and put on her maid uniform. When she exited her room, Damian was about to leave his room as well. Their eyes met. She beamed and bowed to him as a greeting. He shut his eyes, walking away. Daphne made her way to the kitchen to help Alfred to prepare breakfast. \"Miss Daphne, you don't need to help,\" Alfred said to her. \"It's okay,\" she replied. She served what Alfred had prepared on the plate. Bruce came into the dining room. He caught sight of her in her maid uniform. Damian came down a few minutes after his father. He was wearing a suit and a tie that Daphne had prepared. \"Daphne, go and change your clothes,\" Bruce said to her. \"You're going to make us late to work...\" Damian muttered. Daphne sighed. She went back to her room. Her choice of clothing that day was a suit with a pair of slacks instead of a skirt. She tied her hair into a tight ponytail. She put on the heels that Bruce had bought for her. She went back to the dining room. Damian was done with his breakfast. Bruce decided to wait for Daphne. She took a toast and swallowed it in an instant. The man shook his head at her behaviour. She flashed a sheepish grin before following him to the car. Damian was inside, taking a quick nap. They reached the office. Faye greeted Damian happily. Daphne and Bruce went ahead. \"Hey,\" Damian called for the orange haired girl. \"Hmm?\" she turned back to him. He handed her his briefcase. Taking it from his hand, she walked away. Damian turned to Faye who was blinking at him, trying to act cute. \"So have you eaten?\" she asked him. \"I have work to do,\" Damian replied, going up to the elevator. Faye groaned as her attempt to flirt with Damian failed. She stomped back to her office. Damian got to his office when Daphne was busy answering a phone call. She ignored him entirely because she was too occupied with the person on the phone. Damian kept on staring at her. Once she hung up, she looked at him with a smile. \"Something wrong?\" she asked. He shook his head. \"No, I'm good. Where's our drug storeroom?\" Daphne went up to him. He studied her figure again. She went up to his computer and clicked on something. She started her explanation on the storeroom. Damian listened, eyes fixed on hers. She tried to avoid his gaze but it was a little bit hard. She felt uneasy with him, piercing his gaze at her. After she was done, she quickly went back to her desk. Her cheeks were heating up out of embarrassment. Her mobile phone rang. She picked it up, trying to get Damian out of her mind. \"Daphne? Are you busy today?\" Dahlia asked. \"Not really... What's wrong?\" Daphne replied. \"Let's have dinner together,\" her sister said. \"Okay, I'll inform Mr. Wayne,\" the girl replied. She hung up after that. Daphne continued her work. She didn't realize that Damian was watching her. He suddenly appeared beside her, surprising the girl. Damian inched his face closer to her, making the girl uneasy. She looked away but his gaze was on her eyes. Their lips were a breath away and their noses were about to touch. \"Uhh… M-Master Damian?\" she muttered. Damian backed away, realizing what he was doing. He exited his office to go to the toilet. Daphne blushed furiously, touching her lips. Meanwhile, Damian was punching the walls, angry at himself for making such a move. He wanted to scream but no voice came out. What has gotten into me? She will always think of me as her master, nothing more! Dahlia picked her sister up in the evening. Damian stared at the person inside the car. She winked at him and laughed. The boy found it weird that Daphne's sister would do that. Daphne got in, ignoring the boy. Dahlia called for Bruce. \"Mr. Wayne, can I take him as well?\" she asked. Bruce smiled and nodded. \"Why not?\" Damian walked away before Daphne could call for him. The girl looked at her hands sadly, sighing. Dahlia drove away. Her little sister looked out through the window. \"So, still thinking of sticking around with him?\" she suddenly asked. Daphne, stunned by her question, was flustered. \"I don't know. He doesn't seem to care about me,\" she sighed again. \"You can come live with me,\" Dahlia offered. Shaking her head, she said, \"No. For some reason...I think Master Bruce would still need me. Besides, Master Dick always visits as he promised me.\" \"Of course. After all, he is your brother on paper,\" her sister replied, smiling. Daphne Aldrin Grayson was the girl's new name as requested by Delphinium in her will. She wanted Dick to hide her but the little sister decided to stay with Bruce even after all the persuasion Dick tried. She wanted to be Bruce's maid and work under him as her dead sister had requested. Now that Damian came back, she had a stronger excuse to stay...and to walk away. \"I don't really like him...\" Dahlia remarked. \"I know, most people don't anyway. I'm still confused...\" Daphne replied. \"Do you like him?\" her sister asked, concerned. Daphne bit her lower lip. She didn't reply. Dahlia smiled at her reaction. The girl sighed again. She thought of Damian. Most of the things that come out of his mouth, the way he treats her and how he sees her...everything hurts. She didn't know why she stayed. Damian challenged her to become stronger, but that was all. She cared for him as a maid to a master, nothing more. Why should I stay when he treats me so? They arrived at the restaurant that Dahlia had booked for the two. They didn't notice that Arnold was spying on them. Arnold knew about Dahlia a year ago when Daphne accidentally mentioned her in a conversation. He started his research then and found out that Dahlia is the eldest sister. She had lived a harsh life which was why she sent Delphinium and Daphne to live with foster parents. Arnold watched as the two sisters sat down. He could not disagree about Dahlia being an adult version of Daphne. If they were the same age, they were practically twins! \"I've ordered your favourite but you can order anything else,\" her sister said. Daphne nodded, reading the menu. \"I think I'll have a shortcake for desert...\" Dahlia smiled and said, \"You really love shortcakes.\" \"The ones you make are the best!\" her younger sister exclaimed. They ate their food. Daphne talked about her new assigned work. Dahlia knew everything but she was interested to know the story from her sister's point of view. Damian sneaked into Daphne's room after dinner. He wasn't looking for anything in particular. He saw her kukris decorating the wall near her window. He saw her Phoenix uniform in a display there so he assumed she is still Phoenix. He sat on her bed, staring at her maid uniform which she laid there. He suddenly remembered the first time they met. He was a jerk and a brat. \"I wonder what you thought of me back then...\" he muttered. He remembered the time he suddenly cut her arm with his sword and the time she cried to stop him from following Talon. Daphne's smiling face appeared in his mind a few times. He laid down beside the maid uniform and slowly drifted off to sleep. Daphne came back right before her bed time. She was shocked to find a sleeping Damian on her bed, clutching onto her maid uniform. She giggled at how childish he was. She changed into her nightdress in the bathroom. Then, she went to sleep in the guest room. \"Where are you going?\" Bruce asked when he saw her passed by. \"Going to sleep in the guest room. Master Damian fell asleep on my bed,\" Daphne explained. \"What was he doing in your room?\" the man asked. Shrugging, the girl replied, \"I have no idea...\" Bruce told her to sleep in Damian's room instead. She obliged without a second thought. She entered his room. Everything was in place. His sword was hung on the wall. She noticed something shining on his bed. It was the ring she had left for him, now as a locket with a chain. \"Was he wearing this today...?\" she muttered to herself. \"I was…\" a voice answered, startling her. She turned around to see Damian, leaning against the wall beside his room door. He furrowed his brows at her, making her nervous. Damian stepped closer and she backed away. She suddenly fell onto the bed. Damian hovered over her. His eyes were fixed on hers. Her eyes sparkled in the moonlight. Damian was good at keeping his cool even though he knew what he was doing. Daphne was frightened by his sudden boldness. She didn't like this side of her Master Damian. With all her strength, she pushed him away. He fell onto the floor. She ran out when she had the chance to. Damian sat up, groaning. Why did I do that?! Daphne was crying in her bed. She was scared. What Damian was about to do...or at least what she thought he was about to, sent shivers down her spine. She was trembling. She forced herself to sleep. The next day, Daphne woke up late. Bruce had gone ahead to the office and had told Damian to go with Daphne once she has awakened. She decided to take the day off because she was still traumatized by last night. Damian acted calm and went off to the office. \"What happened, Miss?\" Alfred asked out of concern. \"Master Damian did something weird last night. He tried to...you know...\" she muttered before biting her lips to hold in the tears. \"Now, now...it just means he loves you...\" Alfred remarked. \"Does he? He was about to...do something despicable...\" Daphne cried. Alfred hugged her. She kept on crying, confused about Damian's feelings and her own. She was tired when her cries subsided. She decided to take a nap. As she was about to head to her room, she bumped into someone. It was Dick. She brightened up when she saw him. He patted her head lovingly. They decided to talk in her room. Alfred made them some snacks. \"How did you know I'm at home?\" she asked. \"Bruce told me,\" Dick replied, kissing her forehead, \"What happened?\" The scene from last night flashed into her mind. She shook her and lied that she was not feeling well. Dick raised a brow, unconvinced. He sighed and gave in to what she had said. He didn't want to pressure her into telling the truth. Daphne avoided Damian for one whole week. He ignored her as well. He didn't know what to say after that. He knew that he had hurt her feelings. \"Master Damian...\" she called so suddenly one day. \"What?\" he asked, turning his head to her. She handed him a small box. \"Happy Valentine's Day...\" she muttered before walking away. Damian opened the box to find a wing shaped chocolate cake with vanilla whipped cream. He stared confusedly at the gift. Daphne went to do the laundry. Alfred saw what he was holding and smiled. \"She made that last night, Master Damian,\" he said, surprising the boy. He turned to Alfred and asked, \"Really?\" Nodding once, the butler replied, \"Yes. She was really fired up to give it to you…for some reason.\" Damian shook his head and meandered away. Alfred chuckled at his reaction. When she was busy hanging the laundries, Damian came by. She acted cool and calm. Damian grabbed her wrist and pulled her closer. Their lips met. The girl widened her eyes. He pulled away after that. Daphne touched her lips, blushing madly. \"That's how I saved you from the demons,\" was what he said. He walked away after that. Daphne fell to her knees, freezing on the spot.[Chapter 32] Chapter 32: Daphne avoided Damian the whole week. Even though she carried out her duties as his maid, she didn't speak to him at all. After serving him food, she rushed back to the kitchen. When it was his bath time, she'd draw him one and got his clothes ready but she didn't reply to anything he said. When Bruce asked her to train with him, she refused, saying that she was not in shape to do so. Bruce noticed her change of mood. He decided to consult Dick and Dahlia about it so one night, he called the two kids out to the Batcave. \"I need you to patrol the city in my place tonight,\" he said. \"What?\" the girl exclaimed. Damian looked over to her. Daphne refused to look at the boy. She didn't seem pleased with the order. She shook her head rapidly. \"I have some things to discuss with Dick and your sister,\" Bruce explained. \"But, Master Bruce!\" she shouted, disagreeing with him. The man shut his eyes and sighed. \"My words are final,\" he said. He stood up from his chair and walked up to Damian. He held his son's shoulder, confusing the boy. He nodded to him, but Damian still didn't understand. Daphne was still shocked at his orders. She watched as the man exited the Batcave. She sighed, looking down at the floor. She clenched her fists. Damian glanced up at the girl. \"I'll go and get change…\" he said, walking up to his uniform. Daphne went back to her room to change too. Her uniform was neatly laid on the bed by Alfred. A memory of Delphinium flashed into her mind. It was when her sister had created a lot of weapons for her. After a few minutes, Daphne was staring at her reflection. There was a knock on her door. \"Yes?\" she called out. \"Are you…ready to go?\" a hesitant voice was heard. She sighed, fastening her shoulder holsters for her kukris. She fixed her gloves. She opened the door and was surprised to be facing Damian's chest. She could see how toned his body was in his Robin uniform. \"Let's go. We'll be taking the Batmobile,\" he said to her and she nodded. They hopped in and Damian drove it. Daphne brought her knees to her chest and hugged them. She looked out through the window as Damian kept his eyes on the road. There was not much crime going about but still duty is duty after all. The boy took a glance at her every five minutes. He couldn't help but noticed how much she was trying to avoid him. He didn't mind it because he knew she was still confused, but it still bothered him since they live together and work at the same office. \"Hey…\" he spoke up. \"Robin! Something's happening over there!\" she interrupted him, pointing towards a building which was on fire. Damian turned the mobile and rushed towards the direction immediately. Bruce meet up with Dick and Dahlia at a restaurant. They sat down and ordered some drinks. \"So, what are we here to discuss about?\" Dahlia asked. \"Daphne and Damian,\" Bruce replied in a stern tone. Dick and Daphne looked at each other. They turned to look at Bruce. He was staring at his warm coffee. \"She's been avoiding him the whole week. I just thought you might know why,\" Bruce explained. \"I never thought that those two kids would be the topic of the day,\" Dick joked. \"What did he do to my baby sister?\" Dahlia asked with a soft growl. Bruce shook his head. \"I don't really know. Suddenly, she was all quiet,\" he explained. Dahlia sighed. Dick shrugged, not knowing what to say. They sipped their drinks. All of them thought hard for a while. \"Maybe Damian made a move on her?\" Dick shrugged. Dahlia disagreed, asking, \"Like what?\" \"I don't know…maybe he kissed her or touched her somewhere he shouldn't? I mean, this is Damian we're talking about,\" the man chuckled. The woman punched his shoulder angrily. Bruce shook his head, disagreeing as well. His son is a quieter. It is always hard for the boy to speak his mind. Bruce was convinced that he would never lay a finger on any girl, especially Daphne. \"You shouldn't be making such remarks,\" Dahlia warned Dick. \"It was just a friendly guess,\" Dick replied, rubbing where she had punched him. \"I don't think he would do anything like that,\" Bruce spoke up, grabbing their attention. Dahlia sighed. \"Then, what do you think happened?\" \"He must've offended Daphne in some way. She's always like that when he did,\" the father explained. The woman pondered for a while, thinking hard. Daphne hardly talked about Damian with her, so she didn't know what her sister had been through with the young Wayne. \"Should we do something about it?\" Dick asked Dahlia. \"I don't really know…but I have an idea,\" the orange-haired smiled. She started to tell them her plan. Damian and Daphne jumped out of the Batmobile and rushed inside the building without second thoughts. It was a jewelry store. Most of the merchandises were already stolen. There was a man with a bag and he was busy throwing the jewels into it. He didn't realize that the two kids were right behind him. \"Drop the things you stole,\" Damian growled. The man stood up with a calm expression. He had a scar across his face which frightened Daphne. She hid it very well, though. He pointed a gun towards them. \"Don't come any closer or I'll shoot you,\" he growled back. Damian frowned. He charged in and punched the man in his stomach. The man choked and pulled the trigger. A shot was heard. Daphne bit her lower lip. Her arm was hit so easily. When Damian was occupied with her injury, two more men appeared. One of them hit Damian on the head with a baseball bat. He blacked out a few minutes. The other one tried to stab Daphne with a butterfly knife, but the kicked his hand before he could. She swiped his leg. He fell down onto the ground. Daphne took the opportunity to stun him with her stun gun. When she was done with that one, the one with the baseball bat hit her on her back. She gasped, trying to catch her breath. The two remaining men started to kick and stomp on her. Damian's eyes widened at the scene. The man with the bag shot his left leg before he could react. The building was going to collapse soon so they made their leave. \"Not so fast!\" a familiar voice was heard. \"Good timing, Batwing,\" Damian smirked, limping up to the unconscious Daphne. Blood was pouring from her forehead and some were dripping out of her mouth. He picked her up. She coughed out blood. Her face was pale. Damian gritted his teeth. He was angry at himself at how easily they were defeated. \"I've called the cops. They'll be here soon,\" Luke said after tying the three men up and putting off the fire. \"Thanks for the help,\" Damian sighed. \"I can't believe you convinced her to become Phoenix,\" the tanned man said. \"Convinced? What do you mean?\" the wonder boy was confused. Luke was even more confused. \"You didn't know? She quit right after they got back from Titan Tower that one time.\" Upon hearing that, Damian's heart was torn. He now knew that he was the reason why she was in such a bad shape. He finally understood why it was so easy to beat her in training. She always seemed like she was struggling not to lose to him, but still did. \"She…quit?\" he muttered. \"Yeah. She said she has no reason to be one anymore,\" the man explained to him. Daphne cringed and stirred. She woke up to see a quiet Damian and Luke next to him. She flashed a smile. He nodded to her. When the cops came to take the burglars away, Luke went on his way. Daphne saw the bandage around Damian's leg. \"I'm sorry! I was supposed to be covering you…\" she apologized. \"Why are you…\" he muttered, looking at her. He shut his mouth. He got into the Batmobile and they drove away. Daphne touched the bandage on her forehead. She stared at the ones around her right arm. Did he patch me up? She glanced up at the boy who was in deep thoughts. His right hand gripped the steering wheel tight. Daphne wondered why he was so tensed. She reached up to tap his shoulder. \"Don't bother…\" he suddenly said, surprising her. She bit her lower lip and then, asked, \"Are you okay? Were you badly injured?\" He stopped the mobile. Daphne almost hit the dashboard. She blinked at him as he took off his mask. He snapped his head towards her. He ripped her mask off. Their eyes met for mere seconds before he attacked her lips. She tried to push him away, but he was far stronger than her. A single tear dropped from her right eye as she tried to endure the kiss. Damian pulled away after five minutes. Daphne's cheeks were beat red. She kept her gaze on his eyes. \"Why?\" he asked. \"H-Huh?\" she stuttered. \"Why…after all that I've done to you, why are you still here?\" he shouted angrily. \"Master Damian, I don't understand…\" she muttered, blinking confusedly at him. \"I said I didn't need you, I pushed you away when you tried to help, and I was always so selfish! But! You're still here…\" he shouted, looking away from her, \"Why?!\" \"Because…I'm your maid,\" she replied, still confused. \"My maid? Is that why you stayed even after I failed to protect you the second time?\" he asked. \"It's my job to protect you . You don't have to concern yourself about me,\" she assured him, smiling weakly, \"I'll be fine.\" Grabbing her shoulders, he shook her angrily. \"But I won't!\" \"Why…not?\" she asked, gazing into his eyes. \"Because I…\" he hesitated. The communicator beeped, interrupting them. It was Bruce. He asked them to return to the Batcave. Damian and Daphne put on their respective masks. They did as told by their leader. Daphne stared at the sky. It was cloudy, a sign that it would rain the whole night. Bruce welcomed them with a surprised expression. \"What happened?\" he asked. \"We had a little trouble with some jewel thieves,\" Damian reported. \"I think I'll go and sleep now…\" Daphne spoke up. \"Have Alfred check your injuries,\" Bruce suggested. She shook her head. \"I'm fine.\" Bruce turned to his son. Damian was staring at the floor. The father sighed. He told his son to get some rest as well. The boy did as told. He dragged himself back to his room. As he was lying down on his bed, he could hear rustling noise coming from Daphne's room. He didn't bother to check. \"Miss Daphne, are you sure you should be up and about?\" Alfred asked, concerned. \"I'm fine, Alfred,\" she smiled sweetly. The butler sighed and shook his head. He helped her with lunch. She started to tell some stories about her work and Dahlia as they cook. Damian was spying on her. It had become a habit whenever he thought he had done something wrong to Daphne. \"Damian,\" his father called. \"What is it?\" he asked, turning to look at Bruce. \"Did something happened between the two of you?\" Bruce asked. \"It's not your concern,\" he replied, walking away. Daphne served lunch for the two Wayne and then, she rushed up to her room. \"Daphne,\" Bruce called. \"Yes, Master Bruce?\" she stopped, turning to look at him. \"The Mayor is holding a Charity Ball this Friday night. Will you be coming with us?\" he asked. Daphne glanced up at Damian. He was eating, ignoring the discussion. She nodded once. Bruce nodded to her answer. She ran up to her room. She was going to meet up with her sister that afternoon.[Chapter 33] Hey, guys! Sorry for the long wait! Thank you all for supporting this story. I really appreciate it! xD Anyways, this story will still come to and end a wee bit sooner...if I feel like updating fast. hehehe. Well, enjoy~ - ( 10/9/2016 ) Chapter 33: \"Miss Daphne, are you all ready?\" Alfred called out from the door. \"Just a moment,\" the girl replied. She wore a strapless dress and her favourite denim jacket. She put on a knee high boots. She looked at her reflection and nodded to herself a few times. Then, she exited the room. Alfred smiled at the girl. She replied with a smile as well. Bruce called for her. \"I'll be going now,\" she said to the butler. She ran down to where the car was parked. Bruce and his son were there. Damian's choice of clothing was a blue t-shirt, a hoodie and a pair of tracksuits. His shoes were a pair of sneakers. They got into the car, in the back seat. Daphne kept her distance from him like she would always do. \"Daphne,\" Bruce called. \"Yes?\" the girl replied. \"Are you okay with going to the carnival?\" he asked. \"Sure, I'm fine. Master Dick said he'll meet us there. Besides, it is my sister's request,\" she explained. \"You can never say no to her, huh…?\" the man joked. Damian turned to look at the smiling girl. She was nodding to what Bruce was saying. He wondered why she wouldn't be okay with going to the carnival. They arrived and the two adults were waiting for them. Daphne hugged them both lovingly. Dick patted her head a few times like always. She pulled them to follow her. Bruce came up to Damian who was watching the whole time. He wasn't sure whether his son liked what he saw or not. Dick is always affectionate towards Daphne. Damian thought of him as a rival to win her heart even though Daphne only sees Dick as a big brother. \"If you're not careful, you're going to lose her...\" he remarked. \"Who would dare steal Damian Wayne's servant from him?\" Damian replied. \"Anybody I guess. People like having her around, Damian. She's very fun and pleasant to be with. Even with that height, she has a very good figure. Anybody would fall for her,\" his father said, walking into the carnival. D amian frowned at his father's words. He entered the carnival. He caught sight of Dick with the orange-haired woman whom Daphne referred to as her sister. Damian searched for his father and his servant. Daphne was alone, standing in front of a booth. She was waiting for her turn at the shooting game. Damian went up to her. \"Hey,\" he called. \"Oh, hi...\" she drawled. She looked towards the booth again. Damian stood beside her. It was soon her turn. She paid for the game. \"Why don't you let your boyfriend win something for you?\" the person in charge said. \"Oh, he's not my boyfriend,\" Daphne replied, waving her hands in denial. The boy looked a bit sad from her statement. She took the gun and aimed for the prize she wanted. She only had three chances. What she wanted were a pair of armbands and a brooch. When she got what she aimed for, she hummed happily and ran back to where her sister was. She showed her prize to her sister. Dahlia caressed her head and nodded to her. Damian turned to the person in charge of the booth. He paid for one game. He aimed for a stuffed penguin doll. It was a medium size stuffed animal so it would be perfect for Daphne. Growling angrily at himself, he shot the doll and won it. Bruce came by and chuckled. The boy glared at his father. He was about to protest when Dick interrupted, saying that Daphne wanted to ride the Ferris wheel. Bruce suggested that Damian should accompany her. The boy put a pout, looking away from everyone. Dahlia giggled. She pulled Daphne to follow her. Daphne took one look at the doll he was holding before walking away. She rode the Ferris wheel with her sister. \"So, what happened between the two of you?\" Dahlia asked. \"When we went on patrol yesterday, he…kissed me,\" Daphne replied. \"That's very bold of him,\" her sister remarked. Sighing, the girl explained, \"It wasn't the first time. He kissed me when I was possessed just for the sake of saving me and he kissed me a week before we had to go on a patrol together.\" \"Hah…he's good,\" Dahlia nodded approvingly. Daphne looked up at the sky. \"I don't know what I should do now...\" The eldest Aldrin took her sister's hands in hers. She gave out a reassuring smile. Daphne sighed, resting her head on her shoulder. Dahlia played with her sister's hair, braiding it on one side. \"Listen to your heart,\" she whispered to Daphne. It was midnight when they decided to head back. Daphne was exhausted from having fun with her sister. Damian sat in the passenger seat beside his father. He glanced up at the sleeping girl. Then, he stared at the doll in his hands. Bruce handed him a pair of armband which he recognized. \"Dahlia asked me to give it to you,\" he said. \"Wait? Who's Dahlia?\" the boy asked. \"That woman with Dick. She's Daphne's eldest sister,\" Bruce explained. Damian took another glimpse at the girl. He took the armbands and put them on. Bruce smiled, satisfied. When they arrived, Bruce shook Daphne softly to wake her up. She stirred but fell asleep again. The man shook his head. He picked the girl up and asked Damian to lock the car. \"Let me...\" he said, taking Daphne into his arms. Bruce stared in disbelief. Damian gazed upon her sleeping face. Her mouth was slightly opened and he could hear soft snoring. He went straight to her room. Alfred came to welcome them back but stopped when he saw the boy walking passed him. Damian tucked her in bed, placing the penguin stuffed doll right beside her. She grabbed onto its hand, snoring softly again. He whispered into her left ear, \"I love you, Daphne...\" He exited her room after that. Daphne sat up in bed. She was awake the whole time when he was tucking her in. She stared at the penguin. It has squinted eyes, much like Damian's personality. She blushed when Damian's face appeared in her mind. She forced herself to sleep. \"He...loves me?\" she muttered. The next day, they went to the office like always. Damian would be visiting the Aldrin building that day. He would be driving and Daphne, as his assistant, had to follow him. She got ready by the car. The boy glanced up at her as he drove off. Daphne was not wearing any makeup but she still looked beautiful in his eyes. Her hair was loose that day. She didn't have the mood to go to work for some reason. Could she have heard what I said last night? They arrived at the building. Dahlia waited for the two by the entrance. She shook hands with them to show professionalism. She gestured them into the building. Damian looked around. The ground floor consisted of a cafeteria, the reception counter, and a spa. They went up to the first floor which has a Pharmacy and a Therapy Room. The second floor is where the office lies. The third floor holds most of the laboratories to test new drugs and the fourth floor is where Damian's office stood. The eighth floor is a penthouse for their boss, either Damian or Bruce, whenever they decide to stay for the night. \"The fifth floor, sixth floor, and seventh floor are still under development,\" Dahlia explained. \"We thought of making them into a healthcare centre,\" Daphne muttered. Damian turned his gaze towards her. She looked away immediately. The boy suddenly chuckled. Dahlia looked at her sister who shrugged. They followed Damian to the elevator. He decided to look at the fifth floor. \"I need to make a stop at my office. You two go ahead first, okay?\" Dahlia suddenly announced. She exited the elevator, waved to her sister and walked away. Daphne kept her distance from Damian. She kept on thinking about what he had said to her. Was I dreaming? The boy kept his mouth shut because he was afraid that he would hurt her again. They reached the floor. Damian observed the surrounding. There is quite a number of room. \"This looks like a good place for a sick bay,\" he remarked. \"A sick bay? For who?\" Daphne asked. \"For anyone who is interested in renting this floor,\" Damian suggested, turning around to look at her as he spoke. Their eyes suddenly met. Damian was suddenly mesmerized at how her eyes sparkled. She blinked a few times, feeling somewhat nervous. He inched his face closer to her. Daphne backed away, scared. He was about to kiss her but Dahlia interrupted them. The boy turned around instantly and the girl stood there, frozen. Her sister giggled at the sight. \"So, have you given him the tour around here?\" she asked Daphne. \"He was thinking of making this place a sick bay,\" Daphne replied, glancing up at Damian. \"That is quite a good idea. Maybe we can turn it into a resting area for our clients and guests,\" Dahlia improvised the boy's idea. \"That sounds nice. I'll approve it,\" Damian spoke up. \"We'll be starting on the paperwork for this floor then,\" the older Aldrin nodded to him. \"Do you want to see the other two floors?\" Daphne asked. \"No. We have a ball tonight. I don't want us to be late,\" Damian replied, staring straight at Daphne. The girl nodded. Dahlia whispered something into her ear. They left after having lunch together. Bruce summoned Damian to his office as he arrived at Wayne Enterprise. The boy growled and groaned. He was exhausted from driving. He dragged himself to his father's office with Daphne behind him. Faye greeted the two. She was ignored by Damian. Daphne smiled apologetically at the girl. Faye pouted at Damian's reaction towards her greeting. \"How was the visit?\" Bruce asked. Daphne explained to Bruce in Damian's place. The boy lied down on the sofa to get some rest before the ball tonight. Bruce shook his head at his son's behaviour. He apologized to Daphne who shook her head. \"It's my job after all,\" she reminded him. \"Have you chosen what to wear tonight?\" Bruce asked. \"My sister said she has a surprise for me. Tiara and Mana will be picking up right after work,\" she explained. The man nodded. He let her off early to head back to her sister's place. Damian and Bruce left after tea. \"Why did you let her leave?\" he protested. \"She never gets to spend a lot of time with her sister, so let's just let her off this time,\" Bruce said to his son. Damian crossed his arms, angry at his father's decision. He wanted her to be his escort for the night. When they got back, Alfred told them that he had readied their suits for the ball. Damian rushed to take a bath. Rick banged his hands on his desk, angry. Arnold and his partner stood there, listening to him grunting and growling. Their boss pushed everything off of his desk. He was fuming up. \"How did I not see this?! How did she hide her sister so easily?!\" he shouted angrily. \"Uh…we just found out yesterday, sir. We saw a girl entered the Aldrin household. She didn't look any older than seventeen years old,\" Arnold lied. \"Y-yeah, what he said!\" his partner said, pointing a finger towards Arnold. \"I see…\" Rick muttered, sinking into his chair. Arnold and his partner exchanged a look. Rick took a deep breath to calm himself down. The two companions were confused. A few minutes later, their boss started to laugh. \"Arnold!\" Rick called. \"Yes?\" the man replied in a stutter. \"You say that they are going to a Charity Ball tonight?\" he asked. \"Yes, that's right, but I didn't get any invitation, sir. They're onto me…I think…\" Arnold explained. Rick smirked and replied, \"Never mind, we just have to surprise them…\" \"Surprise them?\" Arnold's partner muttered confusedly. He started to laugh again. He told them to prepare some things for him. The two ran out of the room after listing down what to be done. \"You made a wrong move, Delphinium Aldrin,\" Rick smirked. Dahlia combed her sister's hair. Daphne was standing in front of a large mirror. She couldn't believe how beautiful she looked. She was wearing an eggshell floor-length strapless column dress which was chosen by her sister. She wore a rosy red lipstick and a faint pink blush on her cheeks. Her sister had managed to force her into putting some mascara and eyeliners around her eyes to bring them out even more. Dahlia had braided her hair to the left. She added some pearl decorations onto it. Daphne clipped her Phoenix hairpin. \"You're wearing that?\" her sister asked. \"It reminds me of who I used to be. I don't want to forget that,\" Daphne remarked. Dahlia sighed and nodded. She whispered, \"You look beautiful.\" The girl nodded, staring at her reflection. She hoped that Damian liked what she had turned into. Dick fixed Damian's tie for him. Bruce was watching them. The boy kept on insisting that he could do it himself. Luke came up to them, smiling as a greeting. Damian didn't look pleased at all to see all of them. He was waiting for his servant. Dick checked his watch. \"She's a little late,\" he muttered. \"A little?\" Damian raised a brow. \"It's only been five minutes since the ball started,\" Bruce remarked. His son crossed his arms. Voices and whispers were heard at the entrance of the City Hall. The four peered over to see what the ruckus was about. The crowds of people created a path for a girl to pass. Damian widened his eyes at the sight. Daphne looked magnificent. She gracefully made her way to them. A couple of men approached her, trying to flirt with her. Dick whistled. \"Dahlia did a great job,\" he remarked, shaking his head at how beautiful his sister was. \"Yeah. She's a beauty,\" Luke agreed. \"I never knew until now,\" Bruce muttered, smiling at the girl. A boy about her age asked her to dance with him. She hesitated, glancing up at her family. Damian let out a growl. He stomped his way to them. The other three chuckled at the sight. Damian stepped in between them, acting all protective. Daphne blinked, surprised at his actions. The boy who was flirting with her looked angry. Damian let out a smug. \"Sorry, but she's with me,\" the young Wayne said. \"What? She came into this hall alone,\" the boy replied. \"Umm…\" Daphne was about to say something but Damian interrupted her. \"She took a different cab and arrived later than me, so can you bug off?\" he said sternly to the boy. Grabbing her hand, he pulled her to follow him. She bowed to the boy who had asked her for a dance. The boy glared at Damian before walking away. Damian let go of her hand when they reached Bruce and the others. Dick and Luke giggled at the sight. The boy shot a glare and let out a soft groan. \"You look beautiful, Daphne,\" Bruce praised her. \"T-Thank you, Master Bruce…\" she muttered, looking all flustered. \"Dahlia did a great job on your hair,\" Dick remarked, staring at the pearls intact on her braid. Nudging Damian, Luke whispered, \"Don't you want to say something to her?\" Damian took a glimpse of the girl. She was waiting for him to say something. He shut his eyes, refusing to acknowledge how beautiful she was. \"Ladies and gentleman, thank you all for coming!\" the Mayor started his speech, explaining why the ball was held. The group went their separate ways, leaving Damian with his servant. Daphne clenched her hands together, faintly blushing. The boy was still observing her from head to toe. She looked like a very fine young lady that night. He was amazed at how well Dahlia gave her youngest sister a makeover. He extended his right hand to her. She stared at it confusedly. \"Let's dance,\" he said calmly. It came out more like an order than a request. Smiling, the girl placed her left hand on his right one. \"Sure,\" she replied. Damian huffed and guided her to the middle of the hall. Dick and Bruce were watching them. The boy and the girl started to dance. Daphne felt awkward when he touched her waist. She was a bit embarrassed. Damian kept his gaze on her face. Daphne was looking away. She didn't want him to see how nervous she was. He chuckled to himself. He abruptly pulled her closer to him. \"M-Master Damian?\" she muttered, looking up at his face. \"I'll admit, you look beautiful tonight,\" he whispered in her ear. \"T-Thank you…\" she blushed. Daphne rested her head on Damian's chest, freezing him on the spot. After ten minutes on the dance floor, they decided to get something to eat. The girl took a seat on a chair, sighing. She was wearing a pair of high heels and they were killing her feet. She rubbed her ankle a few times. Damian came back, shoving a glass of orange juice in her face. She took it from his hand. \"Thank you,\" she muttered. Damian nodded once. He sat down beside her, taking a glimpse at her right ankle. She smiled, staring at her ankle as well. \"I love flats better than heels, but it was my sister's request,\" she explained. \"Thank you for dancing with me,\" Daphne said to Damian. Damian didn't look at her but he nodded to her words. Daphne sipped on her drinks. Some people came up to them to greet the young Wayne. The boy kept his composure, addressing them as formally as possible. A couple from one of Wayne Enterprise's partners approached them. \"We've been dying to meet the young Wayne,\" the woman said. \"I am pleased by your eagerness, Ma'am,\" Damian replied with a small smile. The man noticed Daphne who was standing beside the boy. He flashed a smile at her. She nodded as a greeting. He went up to the girl and kissed the back of her right hand. Daphne was a bit flustered by his act. Damian gave out a pout. \"And who is this fine young lady?\" he asked. \"Daphne Grayson...\" before she could properly introduce herself, Damian interrupted. He said, \"She's my fiancée.\" The couple was taken by surprised at the declaration. Daphne's cheeks were red in an instant. The boy acted as if he didn't do anything wrong. The couple took their leave after that. The girl took a glimpse of Damian. He had his face turned away from her. She wondered whether he was embarrassed or not. It was so sudden of him to declare her as his fiancée. The boy suddenly grabbed her hand, pulling her to follow him. They went out of the hall. \"I need some fresh air,\" he said to her. \"Okay. I'll...umm...stay with you then,\" she stuttered. His hand was still holding hers and his grip was a little tighter than before. Daphne was confused by his act. Damian suddenly turned to face her. She blinked in surprised at his sudden move. \"Are you okay, Master Damian?\" she asked out of concern. \"Close your eyes,\" he ordered. Daphne hesitated but seeing how serious he was, she was scared to disobey. Damian kept his gaze on her eyes as she shut them tight. His right hand reached for her cheek, caressing them dearly. She relaxed a bit. His left thumb touched her soft lower lip. She shivered at the touched, but her eyes were still shut tight. Damian's left hand abruptly pulled at her waist, earning a gasp from her. His lips were on her forehead. Daphne's eyes fluttered open. She was shocked at the sudden attack. \"Are you okay?\" she asked again. He didn't reply. He pulled away to look at her face. Her wide eyes sparkled in the moonlight. He loved that about her. Her eyes showed how innocent she is. Daphne kept her hands on his chest. She blinked at him a few times. He attacked her lips. Daphne froze. He pulled away after a few minutes, refusing to look at her after that. \"Sorry about that...\" he said, turning his back to her. Daphne sighed and smiled weakly. She sort of understood what was going on in his mind. She placed a hand on his shoulder without second thoughts. \"Thank you for always being with me...\" she whispered. The boy raised a brow. A man came up to them. He was smiling to the young lady. He looked suspicious, so the boy was a bit cautious. He kept his glare on the smiling man.[Chapter 34] Hello, everyone! Thanks for waiting patiently for the next chapter. You're gonna love this one. xD - ( 10/28/2016 ) Chapter 34: The man kept on staring at Daphne from head to toe. She bit her lower lip, glancing up at Damian. She felt uneasy with the stare. \"Hello…can I help you?\" she asked nervously. \"Ah, yes! Well, can I have the honor of dancing with you?\" the man asked. \"Umm…\" Daphne turned to Damian. The boy stepped in between them. He kept his sharp glare on the man. The man raised a brow but still kept on smiling. \"She's a little tired, so I think you should find another woman to entertain you,\" he said coldly. The man frowned. \"I seem to have upset your date. I'm very sorry. Excuse me,\" he replied, walking away. \"That was rude, Master Damian,\" the girl sighed. \"Good, you still know who your master is,\" Damian muttered, smirking. The girl groaned again. She decided to go back inside, leaving Damian behind. As Damian was entertaining another guest who was excited to meet him, Dick approached him. Tiara was with him. The boy was confused. The older male nodded to the young woman. \"We have a bit of a problem,\" Tiara started. \"What?\" Damian asked. \"We need your help to get Daphne to safety,\" Dick said. \"That man who had talked to the two of you a few minutes ago, his name is Rick. He's after Miss Daphne,\" Tiara explained. Bruce and Luke made an appearance as well. Tension filled the air in mere seconds. Damian was even more confused. \"He's not alone,\" Luke said. \"He has Arnold with him,\" Bruce said, showing a picture of Arnold he caught sight of. Before they could formulate a plan, Daphne's scream was heard. The four males and Tiara rushed back into the hall. Daphne was seen running away from a man. Most people just stared at the scene, ignoring the fact that she was being harassed. The girl caught sight of Damian and the others. She shook her head rapidly, refusing to acknowledge them. She exited the City Hall and disappeared out of sight in an instant. Damian stared at the exit for a few minutes. Bruce suddenly heard an alarming sound. \"Everyone, get down!\" he warned. An explosion came and some part of the walls crashed onto the floor. A helicopter could be seen outside. Aboard it was Rick and his two trusted men. He was smirking. Damian stared in shock. Dick went to help Bruce and Luke. They were trying to get the people to safety. The young Wayne wasted no time. Dahlia confronted Rick and his men. She wasn't afraid at all. At the same time, Damian had rushed out of the building to pursue Daphne. I don't want to lose you… Daphne ran into the forest to hide her presence. She knew that the man was Rick from the beginning but she didn't know how to explain to Damian. She never wanted him to worry about her. She ripped her dress so that it would be easier to run. She kept the ripped fabric in her hands, not wanting to leave any trace for anyone to track her. However, she had forgotten about her Phoenix hairpin which was still on her hair. Daphne stopped after she deemed that it was safe. She climbed onto a tree to keep herself well-hidden. \"I'm so sorry…\" she sobbed alone. The City Hall was in ruin. Rick and his two men had fled after finding out that Daphne was not in the building anymore. Bruce, Dick, and Luke had gone back to change into their respective uniforms. Gordon had contacted Batman immediately after he found out about the incident. The explosion had caught Dahlia. Her head was wounded and her two best friends were tending to her wound. She ordered them to tend to the other victims first but they refused to do so. Dahlia sighed, exhausted from helping out as well. She realized her right arm was broken half an hour later. \"I failed her…\" she mumbled. Tiara and Mana glanced up at each other. Mana shook her head. They continued treating her wounds. Dahlia was biting her lips. She was about to cry. She didn't like letting people see her cry. Batman and Nightwing arrived at the scene. Batwing was a bit late. \"Where is he?\" Bruce asked Dick. \"I can't get through him at all,\" the man replied. \"He ran after her. I saw him,\" Luke stated. Bruce raised a brow, confused at his son's behavior. Dick and Luke turned to each other. They both shrugged. \"Have him contact me if he did find her,\" Bruce ordered. Meanwhile, Damian was still wearing his suit, running around in the forest in search of his beloved. He could feel that she was still in there. He was sure of it. She is good at hiding after all. After hours of searching, he almost gave up when suddenly, he heard a muffled sob. He looked around but couldn't spot the owner. He leaned against the tree behind him. \"Daphne…\" he sighed, looking up at the sky, \"If you're still here, please come out…\" Of course, Daphne heard him. She was right above him, but the leaves were so thick that he couldn't spot her so easily. She bit her lips, holding her tears. She didn't want him to see her this way. \"I don't want to hurt you…\" she whispered to herself. They both froze at their spots, thinking about each other. Rain started to pour down. It was getting cold. Daphne's phone suddenly vibrated. It was a call from her sister. Damian suddenly heard the slight vibration coming from the phone. He looked up. The girl took a deep breath, but she panicked and abruptly dropped her phone. \"Daphne?\" he called. Daphne shook her head, covering her mouth with both of her hands. She brought her legs closer to her chest. She tried to hide. Damian climbed onto the tree without a second thought. He immediately met her widened eyes. He instantly pulled her into his arms. Daphne froze. \"I'm sorry…\" he whispered. It took a few seconds for her to process what he was doing. She bit her lower lip. Grabbing his arms, she sobbed hard. She didn't want to say anything. The sound of the pouring rain and the feeling of Damian's strong arms around her were more than enough to comfort her. The boy didn't say anything as well. All he knew was that he wanted her to feel safe. It was Damian's phone that rang after that. He kept his right arm around the girl as he took out the phone. \"Hello?\" he answered. \"Damian, did you find her?\" Dick's voice was heard. The boy kept his eyes on hers. She didn't respond. He sighed, pulling her closer to him. \"Yeah. I'll bring her back,\" he replied. \"Okay. Stay with her. Luke is on the lookout along with Bruce. Tiara will be joining them,\" Dick explained. \"Understood,\" was the boy's reply. Daphne tightened her grip, earning Damian's attention. \"Don't leave me…\" she whispered. \"I won't…\" he replied. Rick kept on hitting his punching bag, angry that his plan failed. He couldn't even track Daphne down. Arnold and his partner stood there, enduring their boss' tantrum and rage. \"Damn it!\" Rick shouted angrily. \"I'm really sorry, Boss,\" Arnold apologized. \"But, we can devise anther plan! She's going to go back to Wayne Manor anyway! She has nowhere to hide!\" Arnold's partner spoke up. Rick stopped his tantrum and thought for a while. He smirked, suddenly getting an idea. Arnold and his partner heaved a sigh of relief. The smiled at each other. \"You're the best spy I've ever had, Arnold. If it weren't for you, I will never get the building at all…\" Rick muttered. \"Thank you for your kind words, boss!\" Arnold stammered. He was indeed afraid of Rick, but he never showed it. On the other hand, his partner's expression was showing his true fear. He was afraid of going any further with the two's plan. Ruining the City Hall was more than enough for him. He didn't want to get involve anymore. Rick shot a look at him, making him tremble. \"Well then, let's pay them a visit, shall we?\" he asked Arnold's partner. Then, he burst out laughing. The two started to follow him afterward. Before they could happily celebrate their next plan, a blast occurred on the walls on their right. A woman and two other stood there. They dressed in black with only their gleaming hatred seen through their eyes. Their hair flew in the wind. The woman in the middle was holding a machine gun. \"Think twice before you deduce a plan,\" she growled. Damian carried Daphne on his back. They went back to the manor. Alfred quickly tended to her as asked by Bruce. Dick was there as well. He wanted to comfort his baby sister. The girl refused to let go of her grip on Damian's suit. The boy made a decision to bring her to her room. He placed her on the bed and sat at the edge. The butler came back with two cups of hot chocolate. Dick sat at the side of the bed. Daphne didn't say anything. She looked away from all of them. Damian drank his hot chocolate quietly. \"Miss, let's get you into a warmer clothe, alright?\" Alfred persuaded her. \"Yeah, you'll catch a cold,\" her brother said. \"I'll go get change myself,\" Damian announced. Daphne reached out for his arm. She shook her head rapidly. \"I'll come back once I've changed,\" he promised. She slowly loosened her hold. She gave a nod and then, looked to the other side again. Daphne was left alone after she finished her drink. She hugged the stuffed penguin that Damian had given to her. She was scared. A knock was heard and the door opened. Damian stood there in his black pants, a blue jacket, and a white undershirt. He approached her without a word. She gave out a small smile to him. \"You should change your clothes,\" he said softly. \"Alfred had prepared me one…\" she muttered, pointing towards it. \"I'll wait outside,\" he replied. \"No,\" she whispered. \"But…\" Damian stopped what he was about to say when he saw her trembling. He sighed. He shut his eyes. She got out of bed, took off her wet clothes and grabbed the dry ones. She put on the nightdress. Then, she approached Damian. Feeling a presence in front of him, the boy involuntarily opened his eyes. His gaze fell onto her bare legs. He kept his composure and gazed at her eyes instead, but he couldn't really keep his cool. Daphne was beautiful in his eyes no matter what she did. At the moment, it looked as if she was submitting herself to him. \"Are you okay?\" she suddenly asked. \"I should ask you. Your body's still cold,\" he replied. \"I'm okay as long as I'm with you…\" she whispered. \"Close your eyes…\" he said. She blinked confusedly at him. Even though she didn't quite respond, Damian didn't waste any second. He stood up, pulled her hand and slammed her onto the bed. Daphne was surprised at his sudden attack. He hovered over her, grabbing both of her arms and locking them above her. His eyes were on her lips, her soft, pink lips. I never want to lose you… You're MINE! Damian could hear his mind screaming for her. His right hand cupped her cheek. Then, his thumb traced her lower lip. Her hair was scattered on the pillow, a big mess, her eyes were swollen, and her skin was paler than usual, yet she still looked magnificent in his eyes. \"Master Damian?\" she asked. \"I love you, Daphne,\" he confessed. Daphne was surprised at the unexpected confession. They kept their gaze on each other's eyes. Damian played with her hair, patiently waiting for her response. The girl held her tears. Biting her lower lip, she asked, \"Are you sure?\" He attacked her lips before answering, \"Yes.\" \"I'm weak…unlike Raven,\" Daphne's voice crack. \"I love you ,\" Damian repeated. His right hand grabbed her waist. She shuddered at the touch. Damian didn't mind. He kept his hand there, while his left hand brushed away the bangs hiding her eyes. \"Are you really sure...that you love me ?\" the girl asked, tearing up. \"Your worries, your fears, your sadness, your weaknesses…I'll accept all of them,\" he vowed. He planted a kiss on her forehead. She bit her lower lip, avoiding eye contact with him. She started to cry. I love you too… Bruce came back from his patrol. Three women were waiting for him in the Batcave. Bruce knew who they were. They took off their masks when he got out of his Batmobile. \"What's up?\" he asked. \"We found their base,\" Dahlia explained. The man stared at her broken arm. She noticed and took a look at it too. She brought it up, moving it back and forth and smirked. \"It's perfectly fine,\" she muttered. \"We turned Arnold and his partner to Gordon,\" Mana continued. \"What about Rick?\" Bruce asked, confused. Tiara and Mana turned to look at each other. Dahlia's smirk turned into an evil smug. She took out her gun as an explanation. The man shook his head. \"The body?\" he asked. \"Handed to Gordon as well,\" the Aldrin muttered coolly. \"You're a demon,\" Bruce mumbled. \"Don't tell Daphne about this. She'll cry her eyes out,\" Dahlia sighed. \"We'll be going back tonight,\" Tiara announced. \"So soon?\" Alfred suddenly made an appearance. Nodding once, Dahlia said, \"I leave Daphne in Damian's capable hands. They're made for each other, but they just don't see it.\" Bruce chuckled. \"You have no idea…\" he replied. \"We won't be monitoring her anymore. The company is as good as hers in three months,\" Dahlia explained. \"If she was to get married?\" the man asked. \"Don't invite us,\" the oldest Aldrin muttered, clenching her fists, \"I've tarnished the Aldrin name.\" Bruce patted her shoulder once before taking off his mask. Alfred gave out a sad sigh. Damian entered the cave. He could feel the tension in the air. He acted cool. Bruce and the others noticed a sudden change in him. Damian was smiling.[Chapter 35] Second-last chapter, people! Wait for the grand finale of this story~! Thanks for supporting it! - ( 12/7/2016 ) Chapter 35: \"Mommy!\" a five-year-old boy called as he ran up to a woman in front of him. The woman was wearing a purple wrap dress and a pair of ankle strap heels. She had light make up on. Her orange short hair was tied into a ponytail. That night, she looked younger than twenty-five years old. She picked the boy up and fixed his black hair. \"Dylan, have you been good?\" she asked. \"Of course! Uncle Dick took good care of me!\" the boy replied, chuckling. The woman kissed her son's forehead. Dick came out, looking as muscular as ever. He was with Starfire that day, babysitting the little Wayne. The orange-haired flashed a smile to them. A man stood beside her, a lot like Bruce in that age. He ruffled the boy's hair. The boy muttered a complaint. \"He's a handful,\" Dick remarked. \"Just like me when I was this age,\" the young man replied. \"How was your dinner, Daphne?\" Starfire asked. \"It was memorable. He gave me another gift,\" Daphne replied, smiling at her husband. \"What can I say? I love my wife,\" her husband said, turning to the couple, \"Thanks again for taking care of Dylan for us.\" \"It was our pleasure. It is your anniversary after all,\" Dick replied, patting Daphne's head. \"Take good care of her, Damian,\" Starfire reminded the man. Damian nodded. \"I won't let you down.\" They exited the apartment. Dylan was happily telling his mother his adventures with Dick and Starfire. \"Uncle Dick took me to a carnival! Then, we played video games!\" the boy chirped. \"My, my, he spoils you a lot,\" Daphne giggled. Dylan grinned and giggled happily. She glanced up at Damian who was busy thinking hard about something. They were married for seven years and he still had that straight face on him. She gazed at their son. Dylan was exactly like Damian when he was that age, but he had Daphne's innocent brown eyes. It was a mix combination of the two because the boy could be a handful at one time and an innocent, obedient boy the next. She kissed her son's forehead. \"Mommy!\" the boy groaned. \"Oh, I forgot you didn't like that…\" she chuckled. Dylan puffed his cheeks angrily. \"Daddy, look what Mommy did!\" he complained. \"Hmm?\" Damian replied, startled. His wife blinked at him, confused about his behavior. She turned to Dylan and rubbed her nose with his to distract him from what he just saw. She put Dylan in the back seat. The boy lied down and immediately fell asleep. Damian looked a bit tensed and she was worried. She placed her left hand on his right one. The man glanced up at her with his sharp eyes. She smiled gently at him. \"Are you okay?\" she asked. The man nodded. \"Yeah, I'm good,\" he replied rather coldly. Daphne intertwined her hand with his and said, \"You look a bit troubled.\" He sighed. He pulled her head to rest on his shoulder. He planted a kiss on her forehead to ease her worries. He knew how much she doesn't like seeing him troubled. He, of course, doesn't like seeing his wife that way. \"I'll be fine…\" he soothed her. \"Okay,\" she whispered. They arrived at the manor. Bruce was in his study, reading a book he had just bought from his favorite store. It was Damian's turn to tuck Dylan into bed. He greeted his father with a nod when he passed by. Daphne entered the study and took a seat opposite of her father-in-law. \"How was dinner?\" he asked her. \"It was great. Thank you for making a reservation for us,\" she replied with a smile. \"It was an anniversary gift from me,\" Bruce said. She stared at her wedding ring, a simple ring with a princess cut emerald on it. The emerald matched Damian's eyes and she loved it. Her lips formed a small smile as she remembered how he had proposed to her. It was awkward and sweet at the same time. She knew that Dick, Bruce, Alfred, Shirley, Max, Luke, and Katherine were spying on them. It was one of the reasons why Damian was so nervous. She remembered what he had said. The cold autumn breeze hit Daphne and she shivered. They were right outside of the Batcave. She was only wearing her maid uniform, so she didn't look that happy. She turned to look at Damian. He was busy scratching the back of his head. He paced around for a while, looking more troubled than usual. \" What's the matter, Master Damian?\" she asked, concerned. Damian turned to look at her. He flinched and blushed when he saw her wide eyes staring at him. He almost toppled backward. The two could hear stifled laughter coming from the entrance of the Batcave. They knew that they were being spied on. \" Are you okay?\" she asked again. \" Y-Yeah. Just be quiet for a while,\" he said, shoving his palm in front of her. She blinked in confusion, but then, nodded to his request. He paced around again. She waited patiently for what he wanted to say. His back was facing her. She noticed how toned his body was. She didn't realize that he had gotten stronger. He suddenly spun around to face her, startling her. \" Will you legally be mine?\" he suddenly blurted. \" What?\" she drawled, confused. Damian slapped his forehead. He felt stupid, as if he was blubbering things he couldn't understand too. The girl blinked again. Her eyes sparkled in the moonlight. He was mesmerized again. \" Daphne…\" he started. \" Yes, Master Damian?\" she tilted her head to the side. \" Will you be mine forever?\" he said in one breath. Daphne backed away as he stepped closer to her. His eyes were fixed on hers. \" M-Master Damian?\" her voice cracked, looking away, \"I don't think I deserve you. You should find someone suitable of your status.\" \" I don't care about that. I love you and only you. You're my life, my happiness, my sadness, my strength. Daphne, you're my everything,\" he vowed, kissing her on the forehead, \"Will you marry me?\" Daphne burst into tears, touched by what he had said. \"Yes…\" she whispered. The others came out and cheered for the couple. They clapped their hands and sang happy songs. Daphne smiled at her fiancé. He wasn't looking at her, but his face was beat red. He was embarrassed when everyone started to tease him. She chuckled to herself. Daphne took a deep breath. Bruce gazed at his daughter-in-law's face. He knew something was troubling her. \"I know that face…\" he muttered. Daphne chuckled. \"I know you do…\" she replied in the same tone as him. \"What's wrong?\" he asked, concerned. \"Same old, same old. You son is depressed. It almost affected Dylan tonight…\" she replied, sighing. \"Did he tell you why?\" Bruce asked in a serious tone. Shaking her head, she replied, \"No. He said I shouldn't worry… Please, don't ever mention this to him.\" Bruce nodded. He patted her head and kissed her cheek as comfort. Daphne forced a weak smile. She couldn't bear seeing her father-in-law worrying about their marriage. She excused herself to change her clothes. Damian was already in bed, reading a book. It was his routine before going to bed. Daphne changed into a nightdress. She lied down beside him, observing his face. \"Do you want to talk about what happened?\" she asked. He shook his head. \"I'll handle it myself,\" he replied. \"Are you sure?\" she muttered. Damian threw his book and glared at his wife. \"Look, I said I'll handle it myself! So, could you please just stop meddling into my business?!\" he shouted. Daphne was taken aback by his words. She bit her lower lip, holding in her tears. She slowly nodded, turned around and went to bed. Damian took a deep breath. He was disappointed at himself for shouting at her. It has been a while since he did that to her. Daphne didn't see Damian off at the door that day. Alfred noticed her change of mood. After sending Dylan to his preschool, Alfred served her a cup of tea and a plate of biscuits. She ate them quietly. \"You don't look well, Madam,\" he remarked. \"Yeah. I don't feel so good,\" she muttered weakly. \"Would you like me to call the doctor?\" Bruce asked. She nodded slowly, saying, \"That would be nice.\" The two men noticed her swollen eyes. Alfred went ahead to call the family doctor. Daphne rested her head on the sofa. Her stomach felt weird and her head was spinning. She felt nauseous. \"You should get some rest…\" Meanwhile, Damian was greeted by Max and Shirley at the office. They had something to discuss with him. They entered his office. He sat down, switching his computer on. \"Are you sure it's okay to let us handle the Aldrin building?\" Shirley asked. \"You two are my trusted friends and Daphne co-signed the contract after all…\" Damian explained. \"So she's okay with it?\" Max asked. \"Yes. She wanted you two to have a strong connection with us. I guess being best friends is not enough,\" the young Wayne replied. \"We don't mind if she's okay with it. We'll settle the debts and the companies' withdrawal. You don't have to worry about it,\" Shirley said professionally. Max nodded, agreeing with his wife. Damian sank in his chair, sighing. He hoped that his wife would be okay with his decision. He wanted her to focus on her health. She may not notice it but her body was frail and weak. She was getting thinner by day. Damian couldn't really find the reason behind it all. \"You're worried about your wife, huh?\" Max asked. \"Yeah… She looks weak these few days. I'm worried about her…\" he muttered and sighed. \"Is she okay?\" Shirley asked. He shook his head. \"I can't say for sure.\" \"Congratulations, Mrs. Wayne! The baby is already two months old,\" the doctor said. \"Really?\" Daphne asked. \"Yes. Now remember, you have to watch diet and do not stress yourself out, okay?\" the doctor reminded her. She nodded. \"Thank you very much.\" She couldn't wait to tell Damian. When afternoon came, Damian would always come back to eat his wife's cooking instead of the cafeteria's cooking. As he entered the manor, he was greeted by a smiling Daphne. \"How was your day?\" she asked like she would always do. \"A bit bad…\" he muttered, sighing. Her smile turned into a frown when she heard him. His tone was cold. She hid what she was holding into her pocket: a letter from the doctor. Bruce was waiting to eat with his son. He was expecting that Daphne had told Damian the good news, but when he saw his son's serious face, he knew something was off. He glanced up at Daphne. The young woman shook her head slowly. Alfred helped Daphne serve lunch. She would take a seat beside her husband and eat with them, but that day, she didn't feel like doing so. She excused herself to head to rest. \"Is she alright, father?\" Damian asked. \"You should check up on her before going back to the office,\" Bruce replied. Damian nodded. After lunch, he went upstairs to check up on his wife. He even brought her lunch with him. Daphne was sleeping. He entered the room quietly. He saw a folded paper on the desk. He read it, surprised by the news. \"Honey…is that you?\" Daphne stirred and woke up. \"I didn't mean to wake you up…\" he muttered. \"You've read the letter?\" she asked, smiling weakly. \"Y-Yeah. I didn't know you're pregnant,\" he replied, smiling. He sat beside his wife. She nodded to his words. He kissed her forehead, pulling her into a hug. She wondered what was written in the letter. His hands were holding onto it so tightly. His expression wasn't giving any clue to her as well. Daphne kissed his cheek before saying that she wanted to rest. \"I'll come home early tonight. You don't have to cook. I'll do that with Pennyworth's help,\" he said. \"Thanks…\" she replied. Damian nodded. He ripped the piece of paper and threw it away before heading back to the office. \"Madam, please sit down. Let me do the work,\" Alfred insisted when he saw Daphne taking out the ingredients for dinner. \"But, I missed cooking…\" she complained, frowning. \"Mommy, listen to Alfred,\" Dylan muttered, pulling at her dress. She flashed a smile at her son. Alfred urged her to sit down at the counter as he started on dinner. Dylan helped by washing some vegetables and chicken. Alfred told him to sit with his mother. Daphne caressed the boy's head. He rubbed his mother's belly lovingly. \"I can't wait!\" he cooed. \"I can't wait too, Master Dylan,\" Alfred remarked, chuckling, \"After all, there are only two weeks left before the due.\" \"Yes, I'm to be admitted this Monday. I hope he didn't forget,\" Daphne sighed. \"He won't, Madam,\" the butler reassured her. Damian had been busy with work. Whenever he comes home, there was a look on his face that made Daphne not to bother him. She went on her weekly check up with Alfred or Bruce. He never asked about the baby and she never said a word. She wasn't stressed out by it because she knows her husband all too well. \"I heard Master Dick is coming for dinner tonight,\" Alfred changed the subject. \"Oh…yeah. He texted me about it,\" Daphne replied. Dylan was humming a tune to the belly, hoping that the baby would hear it. He wasn't listening to what his mother and Alfred were talking about. Bruce entered the kitchen. He nodded to Daphne and she nodded back. \"Dylan seems so excited,\" he remarked. \"He just can't wait to be a brother,\" Daphne smiled. Bruce nodded, sitting down beside her, \"Did you remind him?\" The woman looked away, shaking her head. \"No. He's too occupied with work. I don't want to bother him.\" The father-in-law took her hands into his. He caressed it so lovingly. She gave out a gentle smile. Dylan tilted his head to the side at what his grandfather was doing. He suddenly slapped his hands away from his mother's. \"Dylan, that's not nice,\" she said sternly. \"Mommy's hands only for Daddy!\" Dylan shouted angrily. Bruce laughed. \"He has a point.\" \"I'm really sorry,\" the mother apologized. Shaking his head, he replied, \"No need. He's very protective of you…just like a certain someone who admit it at all…\" Daphne smiled. She knew he was talking about Damian. As they were happily talking about the old days, Daphne felt nauseous. She rushed to the toilet. When she came back, she didn't speak at all. Alfred and Bruce noticed that her lips were pale. They were worried, but she kept on wearing a smile and trying to ensure them that she was okay.[Chapter 36] Here you are! El grand finale, everyone. This chapter consists of flashback after flashback so bear with me, okay? I can't believe it's the end! I enjoy writing this! I promise you it is still worth your time. Enjoy :) aanddd I think it is not that late to say, \"HAPPY 2017!\" - ( 1/8/2017 ) Chapter 36: Damian gazed into the sky through his windows. He was in his office, having some free time before another big meeting. He didn't want anyone to bother him so he had asked his personal assistant to be on guard at his door. He caught sight of two sparrows flying together. His lips formed a smile. \"Oh, right! Today is Dylan's birthday,\" he suddenly exclaimed. He called for his assistant. She came in and told him that his next meeting was in 10 minutes. He nodded to her. She nodded back. \"Clear my schedule after this meeting, please,\" he requested. \"Yes, sir,\" she replied and left. He took a seat at his table and reviewed his presentation for the upcoming meeting. There was a frame with his wife's photo right beside his computer. It was a picture of her in her maid uniform. Her smiling face flashed into his mind. He bit his lower lip. \" Good morning,\" Damian said as he entered the kitchen. \" Good...morning...\" there was a hesitation in Daphne's reply. \" What's for breakfast?\" he asked her. \" I made some pancakes and bacon strips, sir,\" Alfred replied in her place. Damian nodded. He sat down beside his wife, still fixing his tie. She bit her lower lip. Alfred sighed at his denseness. He served the food and stood in front of the young man. Daphne glanced up at the butler. The butler stared at Damian. He asked, \"Are you heading to the office today?\" Damian stopped his munching, stared at the butler and asked, \"What kind of question is that? Today is Monday after all...\" \" Madam Daphne is to be admitted today,\" Alfred replied, glancing up at the young woman. Damian swallowed his food in an instant. He slapped himself on the forehead, grunting. Daphne felt troubled. She knew that he was very busy. \" It's okay...I'll ask father to drive me,\" she stuttered. Damian shook his head. \"No, I'll call my assistant and tell her I'll be taking a half day today,\" he replied. Daphne nodded once. \"Okay.\" \" Have you packed everything?\" he asked her. She nodded. Alfred formed a smile. He went ahead to send some food for Bruce in his studies. Damian pulled Daphne to rest her head on his shoulder. She heaved a sigh, enjoying the comfort. \" I've been too occupied with work. I'm sorry...\" he whispered. \" It's okay... I'm okay as long as you're within my reach...\" she replied. \"Within your reach, huh...\" Damian sighed. \"Sir, the meeting is about to start,\" his assistant called. Damian nodded. He grabbed everything he needed and strolled to the meeting room. That day was a meeting between Wayne Enterprise, a few renowned supply companies and two architectural companies. The meeting ended with another meeting scheduled in a week. He sank into his chair and sighed. His assistant served him a cup of coffee. \"Thanks,\" he said. \"I've cleared your schedule for this evening,\" she explained. \"Okay,\" he replied. He went straight home. Alfred greeted him like always and told him that his son was still in his room. Damian sighed. He went straight to his son's room. That night, his father had organized a piano recital for Dylan. Bruce did his best to get the Mayor's approval to use the City Hall. Everything had already been set up. When he got to the room, Damian saw Dylan looking at himself in the mirror. He gave out a gentle smile. \"Dad...\" Dylan said when he caught sight of him. \"What's up, kiddo?\" he asked, approaching the twelve-year-old boy. \"Am I going to be okay?\" Dylan asked, trembling. Damian smiled, placing a hand on his shoulder. He said, \"You're going to be fine. You've practiced a lot and you love the piano.\" The boy nodded. He straightened his tie, took a deep breath and went downstairs. A sigh escaped Damian's lips. He took a step out of his son's bedroom. A squeaky voice came from his right. A seven-year-old orange haired girl rushed up to him. She was wearing a purple gown and her long hair was beautifully combed by Alfred. Her wide green eyes sparkled beneath the corridor lights. She called, \"Daddy!\" Smiling, he caught hold of his daughter and said, \"Felicia, you can't run in a gown like that...\" \"Do I look beautiful?\" she asked. Damian nodded. \"As your mother did...\" Felicia giggled. She took her father's hand, pulling him to follow her. As he watched his daughter's back, he was reminded of his wife. Were you happy having me as your husband? Damian drove the car with Dylan in the passenger seat. Felicia sat at the back with her grandfather and Alfred. \"Dad,\" Dylan suddenly called. \"What's up?\" Damian asked, glancing up at the boy. He was looking out through the window. \"Do you…miss Mom?\" he suddenly asked. Forming a smile, the father replied, \"There is not a second that I don't miss her. She is my life, my everything…\" \"Hmm…\" the son replied. They got to the City Hall. Most of Dylan's friends from school had already arrived and some came with their parents. Damian's job was to entertain the adults. Max and Shirley made an appearance. They searched for Damian and found him near the stage. The man stared and gave out a small smile to his friends. \"Nice party,\" Max said. \"Thank you for coming,\" Damian said to them. \"Well, Stella was looking forward to it. She's looking for Dylan by the way,\" Shirley replied. \"Dylan's getting ready to play the piano. We'll cut the cake after that,\" the man explained. \"Daddy!\" Felicia's voice was heard. Her father picked her up into his arms. Shirley and Max smiled to the little girl. She blinked at the couple. A boy, about two years older than Dylan came to view. He bowed as a greeting to Damian. Felicia chuckled at the boy and waved. The young teen smiled back at her. \"Do you know him, Felicia?\" Damian asked, confused at his daughter's behavior. \"Yes. Big Bro Rex. He gave me candy just now,\" the little girl replied. Rex nodded. Max patted his son's head. Alfred was about to make an announcement. Damian turned to look at the stage. He caught sight of Dylan. The boy was trembling because he was nervous. Damian sighed and smiled to himself. Shirley and Max knew why. Daphne held Damian's hand tighter. He knew she was nervous, so he pulled her to rest her head on his shoulder. He kissed her head, making her smile. \" Thanks for making my wish come true,\" she whispered. \" He's going to do great,\" he reassured her. \" I know,\" she sighed. Applause was heard as a four-year-old Dylan stepped onto the stage. Damian kissed his wife's forehead and wished her luck. She smiled before getting up to the stage as well. Dylan bowed and she curtsied. Then, they both took a seat on the chair. In front of them was a big piano. Daphne was going to assist Dylan as he played a song. They started to play. It was a cheery song and the audience were moved at how well the little boy played. \" What a cute beat,\" one of the judges said. \" Yes, it is as if you want to get up and dance to it,\" the one beside her said. Damian smiled to himself. He imagined a happy Daphne running up to him in her maid uniform and telling him all her stories. Damian was awoken by a shake on his shoulder. Max gestured towards Dylan who was just about to play the piano. The sheet he had chosen was his mother's favorite. As he started to play, Damian was again reminded of Daphne. He could imagine Daphne sitting beside her son, assisting him. She would always do that. It was one the ways for her to connect with him. \"He's become as good as Daphne,\" Shirley remarked. \"Yeah...\" Damian replied, looking away. Felicia pulled at the hem of his coat, grabbing his attention. She smiled sweetly at her father. He picked her up and kissed her forehead. She hugged him dearly. Shirley smiled at the two. She gazed back to Dylan. I wish you were here, Daphne... Dylan bowed, accepting the applauses from his audience. He was sweating but he was happy. He got down the stage and rushed up to his father. Damian held his shoulder and nodded. Felicia wanted him to hold her. He held his baby sister in his arms. She cooed happily. \"You were great,\" Damian said to his son. \"Is she...proud of me?\" he asked hesitantly. Smiling, the father replied, \"I'm sure, she is.\" Dylan smiled happily. After that, he had to cut the cake. Everyone enjoyed the party. As Damian was busy talking to one of his strongest stockholders, Bruce came up to him with a glass of wine. He turned to his father. Bruce gestured towards the entrance of the hall. He nodded to his father and followed him outside. Bruce sipped his wine, looking at the sky. \"Is something wrong, father?\" Damian asked. \"This year...marks seven years since she died,\" he started. Staring at the sky too, Damian muttered, \"Yeah.\" Dick punched the twenty-five-year-old Damian in rage. Bruce did nothing to stop him. The man held his brother's collar, piercing his glares at him. Damian didn't say anything. He met Dick's eyes, confused about his anger. \" Your wife was in labor and you're worried about work?!\" Dick shouted. \" I had an important meeting with someone from Dubai,\" Damian explaining. Dick shouted again, \"Stop making excuses! Don't you care?! Don't you love her?!\" Damian pushed his hands away. He fixed his tie, glancing up at his father who couldn't hide the fact that he was crying a few minutes ago. A nurse came by with her gaze on the floor. She greeted Damian and escorted him to the room where they kept the newborn babies. She showed him his baby and he took her into his arms. \" Mrs. Wayne told me that she would like to name this baby, Felicia,\" the nurse said. \" Yeah. She told me that once...\" he nodded, gazing at the baby, \"Can I...see my wife?\" There was a pause before the nurse nodded. He followed her to an exclusive ward. Damian froze when he saw his wife, pale and frail, sleeping in bed. Her breathing was ragged and she was coughing every minute. He ran up to her after asking the nurse to hold little Felicia. He held her hands in his and she smiled sweetly at him. \" Why didn't you let them call me?\" he asked her. She smiled and replied, \"I know you were busy with work, so I didn't want to bother you.\" \" My work is not my top priority, you know? What happened to you?\" his voice cracked. \" My body was weak since I was pregnant with this little one... She may be our last,\" she explained. Dick came in with a dejected face. \"She coughed out blood when she was in labor. The doctor said she doesn't have much time.\" \" W-What?\" the husband's voice cracked. Daphne caressed his cheek. \"Don't be sad. You have Dylan and Felicia now. Take good care of them,\" she said to him. She coughed again, covering it with a cloth. He pulled her into his arms, kissing her forehead. Daphne heaved a sigh. Dick and the nurse left them alone. Damian held in his sobs as his tears poured down his cheeks. He hid his face in her hair. Daphne's holds on his arms were getting weaker and weaker. \" Damian…thank you…\" she whispered. Within ten minutes, her hands fell to her side, lifeless. Damian shook her a few times. He screamed her name at the top of his lungs, hugging her tight. The doctor and his nurses came in to check her. The husband was told to wait outside. Dick was pacing around the walkway while Damian sat down on a chair. The doctor came out to give the bad news. Dick fell to his knees, Bruce froze as shocked enveloped him. Damian was, of course, surprised to hear the news. He cried and screamed, running into the room and watching his wife's lifeless body. He fell onto his knees right beside the bed, crying out loud. His family had to calm him down. \" Daphne, I'm sorry…\" he whimpered. Damian wiped away a tear from his right eye. He took a deep breath before looking at his father. Bruce had finished his wine and was now staring at the empty glass. Alfred made an appearance with the Raven of the Titans. She was wearing a purple dress with a coat. She kept her hair long, just like how Daphne used to. Damian was surprised to see her. She vaguely smiled with a straight face. Bruce and Alfred left the two alone. \"It has been a long time, Damian,\" she said to him. \"Raven? You look...beautiful,\" Damian choked. Chuckling, she muttered, \"And here I thought you would never praise any other woman than your wife.\" The man laughed awkwardly. Raven took out a shoe box with Damian's name written on it. He recognized the handwriting. \"I promised to hold on to it for her. She said whenever I feel like you're ready, I should hand it over to you,\" Raven explained. \"What is in it?\" he asked. \"The box has your name on it, not mine, so I don't know what's inside...\" the woman replied. Damian took it. Raven excused herself to go meet Dylan and Felicia. The two children were busy eating and talking with Rex and Stella. Damian opened the box immediately. Inside were Daphne's Phoenix mask, her original hairpin, the matching rings that Delphinium had given on her fourteenth birthday and a folded piece of paper. When he took it, a photo slipped out of the paper. It was a picture of when Damian first moved here. Daphne was looking at him with her head tilted and a smile on her face while Damian was looking away with an annoyed face. He was reluctant to take a picture at the time but she managed to coax him. To remember this day: the day Bruce Wayne had a son! Daphne's voice echoed in his mind. Tears started to trail down his cheeks as he read the paper. 'I will always love you, Damian Wayne – Daphne Aldrin Grayson' He covered his mouth as a loud sniff was coming. He had found the answer her was looking for. Dylan and Felicia ran up to him when they caught him crying alone. He gazed at his two children, resembling a lot more of his wife than him. They smiled at their crying father. Were you happy having me as your husband? - Yes... \"Daphne, rest in peace...\" he whispered. I think I like the ending. How about you? So! I was thinking of doing an art for Felicia, Dylan and their father. I will update it in my dA or deviantArt once I'm done. Stay tuned~! Thank you all who have enjoyed this story.

As the students rushed out some stopped to meet up with friends, some looking for others, couples meeting up hugging and kissing, some on their cellphone either calling, texting or taking pictures. Doing the typical things most kids or teens do. But you on the other hand, pay no mind to others, though greet them with a friendly wave if they did acknowledge you. Looking you scan, the crub of parked cars for one in particular, spotting it, along with Alfred, you jestly make your way down the stairs in your uniform, which was nothing more then a dark navy skirt with white dress shirt cast over it a dark navy jacket with a red tie that everyone had to wear, followed by black baby doll slip ons. Your hair was in two low pig tails with ribbons tied at the end of each. Reaching the bottom of the stairs make a small right, you reach Alfred and the car who are just three cars down, Alfred greets you while opening the door. You climb inside, as he shuts its, going around to the driver's side getting in he starts up the car, and drives off. You pack rested next to you, you look out the window like you've been doing for the past three years. \"Ms. Violet, how was school today?\"Alfred asks you coming to a stop at the light. \"It's was nice, my history teacher passed back our test.\"you tell him as you take it out. \"I was given an A-, I'm really surprised.\" You smile at him, as he looks at you in the driver's mirror \"Very good Miss Violet., you did study hard for it. You shouldn't be so suprised.\" The car starts to move \"Thank you, I remember studying. But still, it was pretty hard. I was hopeing for a cruve. Emily wasn't in class today, she and family went to the Swiss Mountians. And our swim team almost made it to the finals. The studen counicl elections are starting up soon. I am not a fan of politics.\" you stick out your tounge\" Miss Steamer gave the class a recipe folder, we have at least ten. Sorry, I mean 25. I have homework in art, drawing a landscape with volume. John's family bought a new ranch in Ohio, he told me that he was going there this summer. That's all today from school.\" \"Seems like a very prosper day\"Alfred tells you. You had started to let your hair down.\"Yes, it really was. Is fat- I mean Mr. Wayne going to join us for dinner? There is a new recipe I want to try with him.\" \"Not tonight, Miss.\"Alfred \"Another lead?\"you asked knowing full well why Bruce has not been having dinner these pass two weeks with you and Alfred. \"Yes, but I am sure the Master would like to have it when he comes.\" Alfred comes to a stop parking the car. He gets out and goes over to your side, opening the door, he lets you out. Grabbing hold of your bag, you look up at the Wayne Manor. It was very huge, you remember the first day you had been brought here by your cousin. Three years ago. You where only eight, he had brought you here to live a much better life. Though unlike most kids who would have been frighten, you took a much more happier apporch, easily warming up to the place as if it was your own. Much to the surprise of Alfred, your cousin and the owner of the place Bruce Wanye. This has now been your home, though not the most normal of families you still enjoyed. Walking up the stairs with Alfred behind you, reaching the top and opening the door, you both go inside. Inside was huge as well, it seem like a castle in some way. You had manged to get lost a few times when you first started here, but soon learned your way around. Bruce wasn't home, he was at the company he owned. Leaving you and Alfred here. \"Will you be starting your homework, Miss?\"Alfred inquires. \"Yes, can I do it with you in the kitchen?\"you asks him. \"I don't see why not, I could use a taste tester\"he gives you a small warm smile. \"Ok, just let me go grab my laptop\"you tell him as you run down the hall up the grand stairs, and straight to your room. Opening the door to your room, which you've had for three years, it was grand room, the size of a deluxe apartment. You had decorated it to your liking, your walls violet like your name and sky blue. You had california king size bed, a enomourmos walk in closet, filled to the brim with your clothes and shoes. An oak wood desk which was hand carved just for you, your room had very good lighting, a balcony which right next to it was your bathroom, though not as big as you room, it was big, you had a shower and jazzucci jet tube, a nice Itailain bay window. A few other things where added to your room that you had put in, like pictures or drawings or paintings. You had a large bookcase filled with books which you've read just a few. Even though you clean your room, Alfred still comes behind and makes it better, you could tell from your bed, through your covers. Seeing your laptop, on your desk you grab it and go back downstairs to the kitchen where Alfred was. You spent a bit of time with Alfred as he prepared dinner for you, while you snacked and did your homework. It was always the samething, you and him at home. Bruce was at the office or on \"vaction\" sometimes he would be here, though it was rare. Even so he would call the manor to make sure things where fine with you and Alfred. Inquire about your day for a bit, tell you if he would be coming home or not or not till later. The same routine. Though your cousin Dick would pop by for a visit, just not today. With you and Alfred he would make a snack while you worked on your homework, as he prepared dinner. It never took you long to finish just around two and half hours. Now down with your homework, you went to the gym dressed in your outfit for gymnasitics which was nothing more then dark green leotard with a skirt you kept your hair tied back in a simple messy low ponytail, Bruce had started to teach you, it's been around one year, though you where still new at this. Even when he was not here, you would still pratice, Bruce had all the equiment that was need, the top of line in the gym. It was large enough to hold everything, but he had another a much smaller one. Upside down in a handstand on the balancing beam, you did your best to slowly let yourself down. Trying hard not to fall, just a few more inches away. As your foot was just about to touch the beam, when you sneezed and lost balance. Falling down off the beam. Right onto the mat, rubbing the back of your neck from the bit of pain. You huff, it was much eaiser if Bruce was here, he would correct you in what you need to do or if your cousin was he would make is funny. \"Miss\"Alfred calls to you by the door, you look over at him\"Dinner is ready.\" \"Ok\"you get up and walk over to him. \"Don't worry Miss, you will get it.\"Alfred encourges you. Shutting the door to the gym as you both walk to the kitchen. \"I hope so. Mr. Wayne and Dick make it look so easy\"as you rub your neck again. \"Pratice is all it takes.\"he pats your head affectionitly. \"True, Alfred after dinner would it be alright if I make Mr. Wayne some cookies?\" \"I would not mind.\" Making it to the kitchen, you never ate at the dinning table with just you and Alfred it felt way to lonely and empty you just ate in the kitche with him. Tonight for dinner was pot roast, with lobster mash potatoes, steamed greens, garlic bread, and something new you didn't know but it tasted good. Helping yourself to seconds, you finished dinner. As you finished your last bite, Alfred who would leave you to make your bath came back with your towel and pjs. Putting your dish away, you thank him as you go to your bathroom. While he stayed behind to clean. Soaking in the tub, really helped the pain in your neck. You smile to yourself, Alfred was always ontop things. Holding your breath you go under the water for a few seconds then come up for air. Taking a few more minutes in your bath, you get out, dry off and get dressed into your pjs, nothing more then silk reddish orange pants bottoms with a red tank top reading sweet with a cupcake in the middle. Coming out, your covers where pulled back Alfred was just tidying up your room. \"Ah, did you have a good bath?\"he asked \"Yes\"you tell him, as you crawl into bed, he comes to cover you. Like he always did, tucking you in. \"Thank you Alfred.\" \"You are quite welcome.\"he tells you. \"Sleep well Miss Violet.\" \"Thank you, good night\"you tell him, he nods his head leaving your room while turning off the lights. Time went by, till you woke up feeling something. Rubbing your eyes, you get out of bed opening the door to your room and leave. Walking down the hall, down the stairs. A bit more up, you make your way to the kitchen, you don't see what you're looking for, so you go a study in the manor that has the picture of Bruce's parents. Making your way over to the bookcase, pulling on one of the books. As a secert door opens, you walk down the dark lite stairs. Hearing voices, two whom you knew though one you did not. Your bare feet feel the shock of the cold concerte floor waking you up completly. You look and see who here. Batman. \"Mr. Wayne!\"your voice echos in the batcave, which catches the others attention. You waste no time making your way down over to him. He turns towards you, as you hastly make your way down the stairs almost tripping over the last one. But you regain yourself. You embrace in a hug, which returns. Before you could say anything, someone else does\"And who is female?\" Catching your attention you turn and look to see a boy a year younger then you, he looked almost like Bruce though a kid verision he had jet black hair with green eyes. He had on a serious yet demanding facial expression. He scowled for someone his age. His eyes seem like hawks, they never left you. You let go of Batman, who then introduces you to the boy. \"Violet, this is Damian my son. Damian this Violet my ward.\"Batman introduces you both. \"Hello Damian, it's nice to meet you. And welcome to the family\"you hold out a hand to him to shake, with a smile. He looks at it, then back at you\"Family you say?\"he looks at you up and down then at his father and back to you\"We are the only two who are family here.\" You where taken back by his harsh words to you \"I... ummm\"you think about then look at him, he just stares. You then smile\"I guess you could say that. So how long will you be staying here?\" \"...This is my home, so as long as I need to.\"Damain scoffs \"That's great, it will be nice to have a another child in the manor. It does get pretty lonely.\" \"Child? I might be one, but do not put me in such a area that you, yourself are in. I far beyond my years. Though from the look of it.\"He looks at you. \"How old are you? I'm eleven.\"you tell him. \"10.\"he tells, realzing you blocked out all he just said. \"I figured that, you a bit shorter then me.\" You where right he stood an inch shorter than you.\"Yes, so I see.\"He looks at you again, with a slight puzzling expression.\"You smile too much.\" Batman then steps in\"Alfred see to it that Damian is settled in.\" \"Yes sir, right this way Master Damian.\"Alfred leds the young boy away. You wave to him, as he leaves once he was gone. \"Violet\"Batman gets your attention. You turn to him\"He seems...nice\" \"...I need you to help him get settled in.\" \"Yes, Mr. Wanye I will.\" \"Thank you, something tells me he is going to need a friend.\" Nodding your head, you bid him goodnight\"Violet\"Batman calls after you before you leave. You turn to him.\"Thank you for the snack.\" You smile as you hurry up the dark lite stairs. Making back into the manor. You go back to your room. Just as you where about to enter. \"Violet.\"Damian calls to you. You stop before you enter\"You're only a few doors down from mine.\" He walks over to you\"Yes, I am.\"he stops infront of you. \"Yes?\" He looks at you up and down again, then stops looking right in your eyes.\"...Yes, well...evening\"he tells you turning around with nothing else to say. \"Oh, good night too. Damian and welcome home.\"you tell him, he didn't respond. He just goes into his room, and you do the same.[Chapter 3] Opening the door to his room Damain slides out not making a sound at all, just as he had been taught. It was quiet in the manor, being the time it was early morning it had to at least be 4:15 or 4:30 am. It didn't bother him at all, use to this time. Looking down the halls no one was awake, he wasn't sure if his father was out as Batman or not. Either way it didn't matter, walking down the hall he comes to a stop infront of a door to a room. His green eyes slide over to it. Opening the door with ease and no noise, he slides in. There he saw you sleeping like everything was fine. He kept looking down at you, the scowl on his face didn't change at all, he looks closer and noticed you where smiling. Smiling in your sleep? This puzzled the young ninja boy. Who would smile in their sleep? For what reason would they do so? This was something he was not use to seeing. Though he knew what a smile was, and why people would smile, he just didn't understand why they would in their sleep. Next thing a small laugh escaped you. As you turn over towards him still sleeping, you smile seem to had gotten bigger. Amazed by this though he tried not to show it, but it showed as he stepped backward. But regains himself, looking around you room. To him this was not fitting, though for someone like you it would be. Walknig around he remembered in his training that one can learn a lot from another through their living quarters. So that is what he did, you smiled more then he though an human was possible. So he would find out why this way or get to know you this way. Going through your things being careful not to make any noise, he checked over at you a few times. You hadn't woken up yet, which he was thankful for. Not much could really find execpt you where normal. Yet even though your room showed much, there was something that just didn't seem so with him. Making his search much more thorugh search. A sometime in your room and with the search he leaves you, coming out your room with no noise. As he shuts the door. He just looks at it. \"Strange.\"he tells himself. \"What is Master Damain?\"Alfred asks the young boy. Though suprised the boy did not show it, he calmly turns around the butler, as he quickly puts something in his pocket. \"Alfred, good your up. I need a blade. One that is well edge, the precession a master. Do have one of those in this...\"he looks around the manor then back at the butler\"Manor?\" \"Yes\"Alfred looks at your door then back the young boy. Who waited.\"This way, sir.\"he turns and leds him away. You finally wake up, lucky for you it was Friday, you didn't have school. Though some other students did, you didn't Bruce made it to where would have it only four days a week. You knew why, and you didn't mind. Done with your shower, you where now getting dress, in simple jean shorts, with off-white blouse and sandles. With your outfit done, you just needed a but to finish up though noticed something. Bruce had just woken up he had to hurry up and get to the office and asked Alfred how his son was doing which he saw he was training in the backyard with his grandfather's katana. Which Bruce was amazed and proud of seeing his son's form and skills. \"Good morning, and Alfred\"you greet them your hair laid on your back., the two men turn around to you. You smile at them, then look around. \"Good morning.\"Alfred greets you, Bruce follows after. \"Where is Damain?\"you asked looking around for the ten year old boy. \"Outside.\"Bruce tells you, he uses his hand to show you, you follow it and see him. His back was turned to you, looking around in the backyard you see the damage he had done. You rush outside. With his back turned was looking at something he was holding, when heard your running footsteps. He quickly puts away what he had. He turns around to you face you, though you run right pass him, which surprised him. Inside Bruce and Alfred saw this. They see you over to the head of girrafle the boy had cut off, you pick it up in your arms. Distrout was written all over your face\"Oh dear\"Alfred remembered. You had done animals in the back, you did them the second you lived with them, and you would trim them every two months. Bruce remembered, they both hurry outside. Damain looks at you not understanding why you where upset at this. He goes over to you looking over you as you stayed kneed on the ground. \"I do not see this what the fuse is about. It is nothing more then bush carved into a animal.\"he tells you\"It was not the best, I did this garden a favor.\" Hearing those words your head drops, he realized this. Before he could say anythings he hears two more sets of footsteps. His father and Alfred come to his side. Alfred goes to you, just as he was about to touch you. You stand up shaking your head, though you where really shaking your tears away. Turning around, you where still holding the head, you smile at the young Wayne. \"It's alright. It did need a trimming.\"you tell him, with your smile still on your face. Placing the head down, patting it, you look back at Damain\"You have some pretty good moves, just like your father. Right Mr. Bruce?\"you look at Bruce. Damain stares at you with wide eyes, he couldn't believe it. Placing your hand on the head\"Guess you really do loss your head.\"you laugh at your pun. You soon stop \"Well, have a good day at the office.\"you tell Bruce. With that you hurry up and leave. Alfred hurries and follows you. Damain looks at the head. His Father breaks his train of thought, he could tell his son was not able to understand. \"Damain.\"he calls to his son in a stern tone.\"Don't let Violet's smiles fool you. You need to understand this is not just your home.\" Back with you inside, you and Alfred had started making somethings for breakfast, Damain came in a few minutes later. \"My father has left for the office.\"he tells you and Alfred\"I shall be up in my room Alfred w-\" You grab hold of him, much to his surprise. You tug on him\"Stay with us Damain and lets all make breakfast together. Come on it will be fun.\" \"Fun? Fun you say?\"he takes back his arm from you\"I do not a servents work. Now I shall be up in my room. When it is done, bring it to me.\"was all he said coldly and left. Making his way up to his room, he shuts the door. Throwing his sword to the side sits down in one of the chairs, he takes out white lace ribbion. It was not cheap, no this coast money and he knew it. And it belonged to you. He took out one more thing it was a silver locket with the initiels VG on them. It belonged to you as well. Out of all the items he took from your room, these two stood out. He didn't know why, they just did. Opening the locket he finds a picture of you with a dolce expression on your face and next to you a young man at least in his early 20's with black hair and blue eyes. He was handsome for his age. The man was smiling tenderly like a brother. For some reason Damain narrowed his eyes at him. Though he quickly put it away as someone came in. It was you, you pop your head in and see him. You smile as you come into his room carrying a tray with two plates of equal food and two cups of orange juice with a pitcher. You place the tray on the desk. Damain watched you carefully as you take a plate off and hand it to him. You then get his cup which he takes both you then get your food and drink as you take a sip, and sit on the floor. \"Where is Alfred, is this not his job?\"he asked you You had food in your mouth, so you swallow before you say anything.\"I asked him if I could bring it up here. To you, I hope you don't mind.\" \"...\"he didn't know what to say. You just ate your food like it was nothing, humming to yourself, while Damain remained quiet. He ate his food, he would take glances at you. Though you never noticed. He wasn't sure what to do, with you mainly. He was use to being around his mother a female just like you as well other females from the league. His tounge was not tied like this. It felt like lead. For some reason his heart was racing, yet it did not do that with the other females from the league nor with his mother. He watched you dap your mouth, then laugh quietly to yourself. Finally feeling eyes on you, you look at him. \"Yes?\"you asks him. He regains his normal look. \"Nothing\" he takes a bit of his melon. Outside the room Alfred, was watching the two of you. He couldn't help but smile at Damain and you though mainly Damain. How this highly trained iron ninja who knew everyone man known martial arts, weapons skills anyone could think of. Use to being the predator, was now becoming the prey of these new found feelings and affections towards you. Which you did not seem to see. He saw the items he tried to hide, and when he went into your room. He knew from last night the young master flushed at the sight of you. It sparked a fire in him, that he was trying to understand. Alfred knew Bruce saw it too, he knew Bruce told you to be his son's first friend. Though he read between the lines, Damain needed someone to keep him grounded, and you needed someone keep you grounded as well and safe. He could see it with the two of you, though on the outside you two had different personalities yet under it was same. Smiling to himself Alfred leaves the two you alone.[Chapter 4] After having breakfast with Damain, you went to your greenhouse garden that Bruce had built just for you, after you had shown intrest in gardening as well it helped you greatly. It was a large compound that was made, on the west side of the manor. There was an original one here that belonged to his mother, which you stumbled upon. Once, you had slowly started to care for everything, Bruce gave it to you and added more to it. It bloomed well, you took great care of everything in here, birds even came to live in here which you didn't mind. A few times when your cousin Dick came, he would help you or you both would spend your time in here. You where watering some of the flowers as a little robin rested on your shoulders. You where greatful that the birds where not afraid of you, you enjoyed their company as well their sweet sound that filled your garden. As you tended to your planets you felt eyes on you, but you didn't take full notice. Once you finished watering, you go and pick up your clippers and a go down your many different rows of flowers picking out a few to put as a center piece for the dinning room table. \"What do you think?\"you ask the little robin. It just chreeped, you smile gathering the flowers you had getting up you turn only to be startled by Damain. But you regain yourself, and just smile at the ninja boy. \"Hi Damain. I didn't know you liked to garden.\" \"I don't\"he tells you \"Oh, well it's really quiet a fun thing to do. This is my little friend, his name is Richie, he's a robin\"you introduce your little friend to him. Damain arches an eyebrow to you\"I am quite aware on what it is. Though its scientific name is Turdus migratorius\" \"...Wow you're just as smart as your father. I shouldn't be surprised though.\"you just kept your friendly smile on, when you noticed he was not in his normal attire, instead he was dressed in tight black turtle neck shirt with tight black pants and shoes to match.\"Why are you dressed? Are you going out?\" \"Yes, and you are coming with me.\"he tells you, before you could say anything, he quickly grabs hold of wrist and pulls you with him. You stumble dropping your flowers out of your arms. \"My flowers\"you say quietly to yourself, Richie flew off of you in fright. Damain was being very forceful with you. You wanted to say something but you thought back to what Bruce wanted you to do. So you just followed him. Damain took you to Bruce's company building, you've been here before many times. Everyone knew you here at times when you came you would bring everyone some cookies, which Bruce didn't mind, you would even bring Bruce some, though on his birthday you would bring a cake so everyone could celebrate with him. One time he had your birthday here with everyone. Damain kept his hold on you the whole time, you did your best to keep up with him. As he dragged you up the steps, you trip and hurt yourself. Damain felt the extra weight, he turns and looks at you. You grab hold ankle, you try to stand up but it was still in pain. \"...I do not have time for this.\"Damain tells you, lucky for him he has had the top training and was more physically fit then anyone his age of above, so he goes and hosts on his back. To him you where pretty light. You where surprised he did this, it didn't stop him he just kept going to reach the top of the building where his father's office was. Even with you on his back he was able to avoid being undected by the others, makinghis way to Bruce's office. Once you both got inside, he sets you down gently, then takes hold of your injured ankle as he looks over it\"It's not damged badly, just slightly sprained. Does it still bother you?\"he asks you look right at you, you didn't realize this as you where still in shock at how he just started to examine your injury. He asks you again, and you snap out of it, looking at him. You shake your no\"Not as much, no. But thank you.\"you give him a soft bashful smile\"Ninja boy.\" Damain arches an eyebrow\"Are you mocking me?\" \"...\"you shake your head no\"No, just a nickname. Ninjaboy\"you tell him with your friendly smile. Damain sighs to himself, he places your ankle down carefully\"...Whatever suits you\"he helps you up, you wobble a bit, he quickly reacts as he helps you regain your balance. You both go over to Bruce's desk, Damain turns on the computer, as he was able to hack it and go through the files. \"Should you be doing that?\"you asks him. \"I will one day run this company, it is rightfully mine. So I need to know the workings of my future company. Such poor secuirty here. When I come to claim this company I will my sure it is much better. As well ride the front of those high stairs.\" \"Stairs?\"you look at him. He realized what he said as he covers it up\"It seems somethings are missing.\"you watch him, you knew you both shouldn't be in here, as well you left without telling Alfred. You could only imagine how he must be worried on where the two of you are, as well what Bruce might do to you the two of you. You had never broken the rules ever before with Bruce, your cousin or Alfred. But with Damain he just didn't seem to care, you where afraid of what might follow if Bruce caught you both in here. That thought became real as you heard voices at the doors, you look up as Bruce comes in with those over certian departments behind him. Your eyes wide in fear, Bruce though wasn't that surprised to see you both here. Though the others where, they knew who you where but Damain. You focused on Bruce that you blocked out what Damain had said. Bruce tells his group he would deal with it, as he closes the doors to his office. He walks over to you two. \"What are you two doing in here?\"he asks. Before you could say anything Damain does\"Reviewing my birth right this will be mines someday\"Damain tells his father. \"How did you get in here?\"Bruce demands. \"A bird's nest has better securtiy\"Damain insults his father question. Bruce then looks at you\"Why is Violet here?\" \"I brought with me.\"Damain tells his father as he gets up out his chair\"By the way your steps could injure someone...anyway we need to talk. Deathstroke has a contact station here.\" \"In Gotham?\"Bruce walks over to his son. Who was staring out the window over looking the city \"We find him, we find Deathstroke. We can take Deathstroke out...permently.\"Damain tells his father in a icy voice. That is sent chills down your spine. \"We don't kill\"Bruce tells his son. \"I was taught you destory your enemy.\" \"That makes you like them\" \"It makes me better then them\"Damain says in his defense\"Deathstroke killed my grandfather! He has to pay\" \"Ra's was a madman\"Bruce tells him. \"He was a hero. He died a hero.\"Damain, he digs into his pocket and takes out something, pressing a button a holographic figure with information comes up\"Ubb use to work for my grandfather, he stays in Gotham city...to indulge his vices according to mother. I looked up the rest.\" \"This is classified materi-you downloaded this from the batcave , didn't you?\"Bruce \"I hacked an inora when I was six. It was easy\"Damain tells his father. Bruce looks at his son, you feel the displeasure he had towards his son's actions. But you blocked that out and look at Damain, you didn't know any of this about his grandfather being killed. You sat quietly as you where starting to understand Damain. Bruce calls Alfred to come and get you two, and take you back home. The three of you stand outside of the company building, you say sorry to Bruce, as Alfred pulls up to pick you two of. Bruce opens the door, you get in first with Damain following \"Alfred is take you home, no stops nothing, you are not to go anywhere, you will stay away from the bat computer and you will stay out of sight? Do you understand?\" Damain crosses his arms\"I owe my grandfather a death\"was all he said and shuts the door. Alfred drives off. It was quiet in the car, you kept looking over Damain, you could feel his anger, his saddness, his pain. He wanted vengence badly for his grandfather, whom you could tell he was very close too and loved greatly. You wanted to find a way to comfort him, you knew those emotions he was feeling very well, due to your powers having used them in ways you do not want to remember. Alfred took you two home, Damain gets out of the car before you or Alfred could to anything, he angerly makes his way up the steps and into the manor. Alfred helps you get out, you just watch the way Damain went. Damain goes to his room, and slams his door shut, that it echoed all through out the manor. After sometime you go to Damain's room, knock on the door. You didn't wait for him to say come in, you go anyway, and find him practicing with the katana. \"Damain.\"you call to him. He hears you and gives you a look that could scare death, you regain yourself. You walk over to him\"What? I am not in the mood for y-\" You hug him, tightly. He was stun by this\"Damain...I'm so sorry about what happen to your grandfather. I know you're upset and filled with rage. As well hurt. I know what it's like, I would miss those I cared for greatly.\"you let him go, he saw smiling even though it looked like you wanted to cry. \"I...when I was younger...\"you look at your hands as they shake\"Darkness was all I knew...it is a curse I can't stand. I knew the feeling of vengence, I felt it all my life before I came here...those I was forced to...I could feel it coming from them. Damain...please...\"you grasp his hands\"Don't...it's ok...I'll take it away.\"you close your eyes, Damain watches you when a glowing light catches his attention, he looks and sees it coming from your hand. He then saw as dark vains started to come on you, he felt as if you where sucking something from him. It was causing you pain, he could tell, but you kept it going. He didn't know what you where doing, but felt it. As if the anger he was holding onto was being taken away. As you used your powers, you saw the images of Damain and his life, those with his family, you where in wonder at this. You saw how he was trained since he was little, it reminded you of yourself, you then find the soruce of his anger, the death of his grandfather. You gasp as you saw the scene. You then let go of him, opening your eyes, as gasp for air. You then fall out, Damain catches you just before you hit the floor, he picks you up. Placing you in his bed to rest. He looks at you. You still had the dark vains surrounding you. He then noticed something you had in his hand. It was a yellow flower, you must have slipped in his grasp while you held his hand. He looks at it, then at you. He places the flower in your hair behind your ear. \"...\"he just looks at you\"...Darkness shall no longer be a concern to you, I will cut it down.\"he tells you as you rested. He picks up his katana\"But first I must do my own.\"[Chapter 5] The scene kept playing over and over in mind as you rested of pain of Damian's grandfather's death, till you couldn't take it anymore. You shoot up gasping for air in a cold sweat as you stumble out of bed, becoming tangled up in the covers as you try to fight them off. Your heart racing as you try to get untangled standing up only to fall, but you manage to get out. Once free, you waste no time and dart out of the room, your body was flight mode. The sameone it was three years ago. Hastly you make your way down stairs, tripping over the last step. That didn't stop you at all, you felt around the manor, as if blind, you where able to sense where to go. Down in the Batcave, your cousin Dick Greyson also known as Nightwing a crime fighter like Batman, he was the very first Robin and sidekick of Batman. He was there to get his injuries fixed by Alfred which were inflected by Damian who went out on his own to take on Uub. Though Dick had stopped him from beating Uub any futher. After Alfred had fixed him up, Batman chaised his son for his childish behavior. Dick was amaused by this, though not at the thought of Damian taking on his mantle of Robin, he watched as Batman and Damian now Robin left to follow their lead.\"Well, I'm going to go say hi to Violet. I'm sure her living here with the demon son is enough. Seeing me might give her ease.\"Dick tells Alfred as he makes his way upstairs. \"Oh, Miss Violet has become Damian's friend.\"Alfred inform him. \"Friend?\"Dick stops looking at the butler\"You're joking right?\" \"I do not joke Master Dick. Violet has spent much time with the young master. Whom greatly enjoys her company.\"Alfred tells him. Dick's eyes narrow\"Her company?\" \"Yes, it was Master Bruce's idea that she spend time with him, get to know him. I must say the young master has taken a fancy to her. Though I doubt the miss is aware of it. They do make the most wonderful pair\"Alfred looks at Dick. Dick's anger showed on his face, just the thought of the little demon boy liking his sweet cousin. He was starting to have a second thoughts of you living here now, as he made his way up out of the batcave to you. Alfred stayed down in the cave to clean it up, only for Dick to come rushing back in a panic, which did starlted the butler a bit. He turns and looks at the young hero, who's face caused the butler himself to panic. \"Alfred, Violet isn't in her room, she' nowhere in the manor!\"Dick alarms him, as he rushes over to the bat computer, he turns it on as he starts to look for the footage of you, Bruce had it surveillance installed due to powers and behavior. It was only for the first year, soon you didn't need it, but he had it anyway incased your powers went out of controll. Dick searches when he finds what he was looking for, his eyes widen when sees the footage of you and Damian, Alfred sees it as well. He knew what just happened. And what you sort of trance you where in right now\"...Violet...\" It was now raining, using the emotions you had taken from Damian though you didn't take as much as you thought, but you had some. You made your to where felt you needed to go, flashes of the mind of Damian's grandfather came into your mind. It was hurting you inside, but you had to go. The rain soaked straight through you, your hair was over your face. Your eyes black, fully black. You where getting closer to where you needed to be. With Batman and Robin, they had made it to an abandon stadium when Batman had gotten the call from Alfred about you. Batman was in panic as well but he hide it. Though Damian was able to see it, as well hear the conversation. He knew it was about you, as his father looked right at him. \"Keep your eyes out for her.\"Batman tells him, with that he and Damian go. You inhaled and exhaled heavily, holding these emotions inside where starting to take their toll on you. Your body was starting to become effected by it, the black veins started to protude on you, your skin started to turn greyish. It was just to painfully, but you where not done. You go into the abandon place, not away for eyes watching you. As you walked down the hall, a dark figure comes behind you, as they get ready to strike you, you felt their presence and turn around, and project onto them what you had been holding in. The engery went onto them, they where overcome by what you had inside you. The transfer was painful as well. They scream in pain, as you scream as well. Which caught others attention. They make their way over to the sound. And come across you, they go to attack you but you do the samething, as you releashed energy, your apperence started to return back to normal. \"This is for Damian, all his pain!\"you tell them through your teeth, falling onto one knee, exshauted from the transfer. You now had a headache. Never had you held so much inside you and transfered it to others. You slowly come to, as you look and see what you did. You gasp in horror, as you see the bodies under your feet. You eyes well up, flashes of other people's bodies flooded your mind. You never wanted to do this again. You slowly step back, only to trip ove a motionless body. You scream as you get up and run, not sure where you had taken yourself. Your outbrust echoed through the this abandon place. As the other guards hurried to your location. It also echoed through to reaching the ears of Batman and Robin. \"Violet.\"Damian heard your screams as he fights off some of the guards from the League of Assiassins. Back with you, you hurry and run out onto a what was an abandon field only to trip hard. Lighting crackled in the back, you look up as you gasp and cover your mouth. Clinging to the metal bars above hanging upside down where humaniod man-bats. You look back the way you ran, getting up you go back that way only for the guards to come out. You stop as they draw their weapons. They come at you, so you run the other way. Scared for your life, the guards where well trained as one throw something at your legs, which wrapped around it, causing you fall down. Just as one comes with their sword raised, they jump as they come to land their blow. Another blade blocks their attack, as the owner aggressivly kicks them back away from you, they get infront of you with their sword drawn ready to defend you. You look and see Robin, but that wasn't Robin,you look closer and see it was Damian. Your eyes wide suprirsed by this. \"Damian?!\"you call to him. He hears you, as he looks at you quickly then back to your attacker. Before you could say anything, someone comes and scoops you up. You scream, as you start to hit them. Only to hear Batman's voice, you look and see him. You couldn't be more happy to see your dark Knight. You hug him tightly, he holds you protectivly, he calls for Robin. Only for man-bats to awaken and start to attack you three. Batman does his best to keep you safe as Robin follows him, with the man-bats attacking one of them knock you out of Batman's grasp. You hit the ground hard, one of the manbats comes and takes hold of you, you scream. Batman and Robin see this, Robin takes quick action. In hot pursit he follows you, using his sword he throws it at the beast, hitting it. It screechs in pain, as it drops you. You scream as you fall to your death. Robin hurries to get to you, using the manbats, though you fall faster, he jumps off one and dives to you. You had your hand out, he could tell you where terrorifed, he falls faster to get to you. As Robin focused more on you, he did not pay attention to what was going on around him. That one of the manbats comes and knocks him away just as he reached out his hand for you and brushed up against your fingertips. The manbat tackles Robin. You scream for him, only for one of the guards there also tackle you. Once they had you, they covered your mouth as they landed on the ground, and made a break for it. The guard ran with you, whatever they had used to cover your mouth, you inhaled and started to fall asleep. Everything went back. Only to be awaken by coldness you felt, you wake up slowly your eyes lids just a bit heavy. You tired to remember what happened.\"Child, are you alright?\"a soft female voice asked you. You lazly look around to find a beauitful woman with smooth brown skin, sharp green eyes and lushes brown hair. Though she had injuries on her, she looked beauiful something out of a story. Her eyes though reminded you of Damian. She saw the look where giving her. She smiles at you softly. She repeats what she asked you earlier. \"...Y-yes\"you tell her with a nod. \"That is good.\"she tells you with a faint soft smile. You just kept looking at her, when it started to click the memories you saw from Damian.\"You're Damian's mother!\" She looks at you surprised that you knew of her son, as well her connection to him.\"So, you are my beloved's new ward.\" \"Mr. Bruce?\"you question, she nods her head. \"Yes, my beloved. Bruce Wayne. I am Talia, mother of Damian. It is a pleasure to meet you, child.\"she introduces herself to you. \"My name is Violet.\"you tell her as you stand. You then rush over to her chains you see her in\"I'm a friend of your son.\"you tell her as try to get the chains off her\"Damian's been worried about you. I-I'll get you out of here.\"you tell her. She smiles softly at your kindness, as you worked to try and free her. The door the prison you two where in opens, you turn around to find a man standing there he had a strong structure he wore armored ninja style clothing, with a black and orange back mask though with only one eyes hole. His presence was imitating, you froze in fear. He walks over to you and Talia, she saw the fear you had, with what little strength she had, she tells you get behind her. As she lays more infront of you to protect you. The man comes to a stop showing Talia footage of Damian taking out some of his men. \"So the rumors of you and the dark knights romance was true.\"the man tells Talia\"Who is Batman?\"he demands from her. \"I will not tell you.\"Talia tells him with feriocity in her eyes. \"I believe you\"he tells her, he then looks at you. You grip onto Talia as small gasp escapes your lips, in a quick movement he grabs hold of you and pulls you to him. \"Leave her be Deathstroke!\"Talia yells at him, she jerks forward only to be held back by her chains. Deathstroke holds you by your hair in his hand, he pulls on it. He looks at you ignoring your pain.\"Apparently your son, Talia has grown an attachment. Apparently just like you, your son has a weak spot.\"he then throws you to her hard, you hit your gut. You hold it, you hold the tears back. \"They will come for you.\"Talia tells Deathstroke, who's back was now turned as he walked out the prison. \"I'm couting on it.\"he tells her, as the door shuts.[Chapter 6] \"This is all your fault!\"Nightwing charges at Damian once he and father returned back to the batcave with Dr. Langstrom. NIghtwing towers over the boy, his frustration emiting from him. Everyone could feel it.\"You lost, you got her taken away. If it wasn't for your little vendetta, she would still be here safe! Now she's out there, God knows where. And you have the nerve to come back here wi-\" \"Enough\"Batman steps infront of Nightwing and his son\"I know you're upset.\"he places a hand on his shoulder. Nightwing shakes it off\"Upset!? Upset doesn't even cover it. If you didn't bring that thing here!\"he points to Damian\"Violet was doing just fine, she was fine. Then he came along, you know how she reacts, you should have had her stay with me! At least she would have be-argh!\" Batman looks at his former sidekick, he understood well how upset he was over the lost of you. After all you had been through since the start of your life, you finally found a safe place to call home. And Dick wanted to make sure you had it and stayed safe even with their crimefighting. Bruce himself has seen the progress you had made the last three years being here. The place they both found you he couldn't imagine anyone growing up that way, yet you some how where able to retain the small bit of inoccence even if you where beaten and broken. To Dick he was your Dark Knight that came and saved you, you where his little princess. The bit of hope he had in this world. He worked so hard to help you through your transition. Bruce helped as well, though not as much Dick. You where his only family he had left to his name, even if you where his 1st cousin. Batman watches Nightwing, he looked down at your silver locket he had open, he had bought it for you, on your first birthday here with them. It was a very important gift to him as well you. Batman was also torn up about losing you as well. He knew the risk of having Damian here with you. But he knew that Damian need some humanity and who better to help him learn then you. He took full responiblity for everything that happen to you. When he first learned of your powers knowing full well how your powers where, and what you could do with them. You never asked for them, your powers made you very valueable to pretty much anyone. Yet you still manged to hold some sort of peace, when he first had you here to his manor he was watching you for your powers but grew to care for you like a daughter. Damian looks at his father and to Nightwing, he underestand they where both equally upset at the lost of you. Though his expression was not an outbrust like Nightwing nor the use of words his father used he could sense his anger through it. Behind Damian plaster expression boiled something much more, Deathstroke had taken his grandfather from him, someone whom he cared for deeply, and now he had you. For some reason how he felt about his grandfather, you where up there as well. He played if of you falling down, just as he was about to get you. He was taken away, he was able to read you how you felt. The fear you had as well the happiness of seeing him that was hiden behind your fear. But when he was tackled, it was all washed away. And when one of the guards took you into the shadows, he thought of what he said to you. That evening when you used your powers on him, it was not longer there anymore. His words ment nothing now. He didn't know where you had been taken, but he was going to find out some way. With you, Deathstroke had taken you and Talia Damian's mother from the place he held you both. Putting a black sack over your head, he tied you up throwing you in the back of something taking off your cover over your face. It was dark, but you felt yourself moving. You where frighten, you didn't like places like this, spending most of your life in the dark. You wanted to go back home, you wanted your cousin to come and get you. Your heart was beating fast, Talia could hear it. It was wild. She knew the fear you had, yet at the sametime you try to remain strong\"Violet, come towards my voice.\"she calls to you. You hear her calling to you, you look around for her as you feel around the place you where. Until you felt her. \"I'm here child.\"she tells you calmly\"Do not be frighten. Relax. Shhhhh...\"she shooths you in a motherly way. Something you had never have heard before nor happen to you. Her shoothing started to calm you. To which you reacted, rest your head on her like a mother to a child who just wanted to feel safe and comfort. She was taken back by this, she had just meet you. And you attached yourself to her, as your head rested on her grew a bit heavier, as if you had never done this to your own mother. Yes you had Dick whom you had rested your head on him tenderly as well Bruce and Alfred. But you had never to a woman, a mother. It was different for you. Having been deinied this in your life. You rested yourself head on her. Talia, looks down at you in dark, she was use to her son's doing this though he stopped as he got older. You where different, from this she was able to deduce much from you. Though her arms where bound due to the chains, she would not mind placing her hand on your head for further comfort. \"You have choosen well my son\"she says to herself in a whipser to where she only heard. Deathstroke makes it to base, he has his men take hold of you and Talia. He brings you two out as he looks at you both. Talia moves slightly infront of you for protection. Deathstroke saw this, he turns to you, as he goes over towering over you.\"I've just learned some valueable information on you\"he grabs you by your bounded hands. He looks at them, then at you. He just stroke fear in you.\"...\"he lets you go, as he takes off one of his gloves. In a lighting fast move he had his hand around your throat. \"No!\"Talia screams at him, as she tries to go to you, only to be held down, all she could do was watch. You try to breathe, his grip on you was tight. You where starting to see him slightly blurry.\"...\"Deathstroke, you then felt it, as you body started to respond, you scream at the pain of his negative emotions being absorbed into you. You started to kick him to make him stop. But it did not phase him, he just kept his grip on you. Your veins started to turn black as they purded from your skin, your skin started to much darker grey, and your eyes turned black. Talia watched in horror. Your screams soon stopped, you couldn't take anymore and passout. Your body went limp. Deathstroke sees this, he lets you drop onto the floor. You didn't move at all, Deathstroke calmly puts his glove back on. \"So, it's true.\" \"You monster!\"Talia snarls at him\"She is just a chi-\"Deathstroke slaps her across the face hard, blood dribbled down from her mouth. \"Set them both up\"he tells his men, as they take you and Talia away. Damian and his father had found some information about the whereabouts of you and Talia. Though Damian now Robin took it upon himself to go after Deathstroke to get his mother and you back himseld as well end Deathstroke, he was able to find Deathstroke's base an oil rig off the United Kindom Coast. So Damian made his way there, he was able to take out a few of the guards as well loose some of them. Only to come to a stand off with Deathstroke who had his mother in his grasp. Both of them had a gun pointing to the other, having a standing off. Damian demanded his mother as well the whereabouts of you from Deathstroke. Deathstroke instead, aimed his gun at Robin and fired. Only for Talia to get out of Deathstroke's grasp and intercept the bullet meant from her son. Damian stood there frozen at his mother's actions. Though that did not stop Deathstroke, he started to shoot at the ninja boy, who ran. With you, you wake up but hunch over from the pain inside you. You look at your hands, you had not changed back to your normal form, you had Deathstroke's emotions in you, and they where strong. You grab your sides in pain, as you scream, you needed to let it out. You kept screaming, as you just let out what you where holding in. The emotions where strong, you slam your hand, only for the emotions to emit to that spot where your hand was, as it started to burn through, the ground beneth you soon melted away, and you fall out. You scream only hitting the ground hard. Opening you eyes, you find yourself what seem like a bridge a metal wired one. You stand up quickly only to fall from the pain you still felt. Tried to contain it, but it was just to much. You knew what would happen if you let it all out at once. And with no one else to be the receiver. What could you do, you did your best to hold it in, when you heard the sound of metal clashing against one another, you look over the edge and see it was Damian fighting against Deathstroke. \"D-Damian...\"you barely say his name, you needed to get to him. As Deathstroke overpowered, with your weaken state you get up on your feet and hurry to his aid. As Deathstroke and Damian exchanged blows with their blades and fist, Deathstroke taunts him about you. What he did to you, as well what he will do to you. Angering the young ninja, giving Deathstroke an adventage, he beats Damian back hard. As he does, he noticed you out of the corner of his eye, he quickly kicks the boy in his face. And then goes after you, you stumble as you ran. Trying to focus on both things at the sametime. Only to bump into Deathstroke, he grabs hold of you as he holds you over by your hair. Calling to Damian, who looks up at you dangling over the railing. His eyes widen, then shift to anger. \"Well..boy?\"Deathstroke then holds his blade up to your throat. Damian growls as he hurries and gets up to you, he goes and ingages Deathstroke, tried his best to block the angered boy. Damian came at him one strike after the other. Deathstroke felt the fury from the boy even if he his moves flowed. You yourself grip onto Deathstroke's hand with your own, so you would not fall as well the pain you felt. But the pain you felt inside was much more, as Damian saw you hold it in. He goes and kicks Deathstroke who lets you go, you fall down, Damian goes after you, jumping down to get you. This time, he catches you in his arms, and turns his back to the ground, becoming your cusion, as he took the impact. He looks at you, you where stiill in pain, but you where safe for now. You slowly look at him, and give him a happly yet in pain smile. \"N-ninja boy...\"you faintly smile at him, but grip him as from the pain. Damian gets up with you carefully, he looks over you there where a few marks on you. Your breathing was starting to become hard,he could tell, you lost your balance. But he catches you, he brings you back up looking at you. You look back at him straight into his eyes, that was hidden behind the damino mask, for the first time Damian gives you a small smile. A warm jubliant smile. Through your pain, you return it, though your's was more. He takes hold of your hands. Only for blood to be spattlered onto his face, though it wasn't his, his looks on to you, in horror. \"Argh...\"your eyes shot wide open, as you felt your warm blood ooze out of your now fresh wound, your eyes look down at the blade that was exited out of your chest, right where your heart was. Deathstroke was behind you, as he pushes his blade more, all the pain you where feeling from him emotions, went away as you turned back to normal. Damian felt your hands fall from his, you go limp. With his strenght Deathstroke yanks you back with you still on his blade, he looks at you, your eyes still open. He looks at the ninja. \"They say love hurts...appertently it's true.\"Deathstroke says coldly to him, as he unstealths you from his sword flinging you off of it. Over the railing, your body falls down into the now flooding base, as you hit the water and sink. Damian watches in distraught as you sink, he grips the handle of his blade as he lunges to Deathstroke a whirlwind untold fury. Deathstroke was able to match him, Damian did not bother about the injuries he was reciving, he could care less. Compared to one he had felt when his grandfather had died, and now with you. As he fought the man, he was able to out smart him. Bringing him to his feet, Damian was ready to strike but choose against it. As the base started to fall apart, he sees his parents coming, they see their son and meet up with him. But he goes and dives into the your watery grave. He swam down, holding his breath it didn't matter how long he was under for, he looks around for you, he knew the spot you were tossed in like trash. If he could he would call your name, to hear him, but he had to use his eyes. Though it had only a been sometime that he had spent with you, the impression where left in his mind. He noticed a shark swimming towards something, he realized it was you. He knew what was on the sharks mind, as he sped up with his sword drawn, just as shark had its' mouth open to take you, he accucry throws his blade at it stabbing it on his side, killing it. He goes for you, and grabs hold of you, tucking you close to him, he takes his sword back, and swam back to his parents. Talia and Batman wait for their son. Talia looks around frantic for any sign of her son, Damian comes up for air. Relifed at the sight of her, Batman sees your unmoving body in his son's arms. He waste no time helping him with you. \"...\"Damian lets his father hold you, but takes you back from him, and follows his mother. With Batman entering the escape pod, Talia takes off. Damian with the help of Batman apply pressure onto your wound. Damian started to give you CPR to revive you. But you did not respond at all. Batman watched in despair as his son did his best to help you. But with the amount of blood you had lost and being underwater. Batman knew there was no way you would survive, he could only imagine how Dick would take the news. Batman did the only thing he could think of, placing a comforting hand on his son's shoulder. Who stopped and looked at his father, his eyes told Batman the upseting pain he felt. He was angry, upset and grief-strunken. Damian looks back at you, Talia looks at her son. She understood his emotions greatly. Though she had little time with you, Talia felt a connection with you. With the help of Nightwing who was able to save them, after they had came to the surface. Talia looks over at Batman who reads her signals. Talia stands up, once the escape pod had come a stop. She looks at her son as he sat over your body. She walks over to you, Damian looks up at his mother, he was fighting back everything he felt inside. She reaches into her breast part of her suit, and take out a tube filled with some sort of green substance. Damian sees this, his eyes widen. He knew what it was. Talia smiles at her\"...\"placing it in his hand, Damian waste no time, as he uncaps it and pours it into your mouth. Everyone just waited. Damian stayed over you, waiting. He waited and waited, when your eyes shot open, as you scream in agony from the side effects what was given to you. You lashed out if not for Damian who held you down, you slowly started to come to. Your vision became focused as you looked on, and see Damian. You give him a weak smile\"D-Damian.\"you mange to say his name. He just looked at you, never letting his eyes leave. You turn and see Batman, you smile at him, he gives you one back. You then close your eyes. \"...Thank you, mother\"Damian tells her. \"...That's not going to be enough is it?\"Batman asks Talia. Talia remained quiet giving the Dark Knight the anwser. Batman looks at you, knowing full well what was to happen. Damian knew as well, as he grips onto your hand. You finally come to and wake up, for some reason you felt much more refreashed all the pain you felt seemed to be cleased from you. You sit up slowly, holding your head. As you look around, noticing you where not in your room. \"...\"you became stratled at your surroundings, this was not room at all. But you heard a familier sound, you to find... Over at the Manor, it was quiet with the four males. Dick was told about what happend to you, and where you where taken. He didn't like it as it was the only way. He felt like he failed you, all that happened to you. He sat in the chair in the one of the studies that had the piano you played, he looks down at your locket. This was the room where you both took the picture it was for Christmas. Dick sighs to himself, though he didn't like the choice, he knew it was best for you. He looks up out towards your green house garden, then back at the locket. Alfred was in the kitchen, making chocolate chip cookies, something you had loved to make. He had good memories of you in here. He would miss your assistance now that you where gone. Bruce was looking in the gym, where you had started to your training, he would help you a great deal. Until you showed him you could do it yourself. Now you where not in here, there was no need for him to help you in here. He remember you asking him to teach you, a few times he would watch you pratice ballet, he even hired you a teacher. Your first recitall, he was there. Now you weren't. In the green house, Damian just looked at your flowers, you had done a lot in here. The birds still chirpped as they went about their merry way. Damian had a few times watched you in here, you seem so peaceful in. He stops and see the same yellow flower you had given him. He plucks it as he looks at it. He saw your smile in it. He looks at it with deep affection, until he realized someone was in here, he turns and sees Dick. Damian regains himself\"Yes\"he asks, your cousin. Dick looks at him, he walks over to him. As he opens his fist, holding your locket in it. Much to Damian's surprised, Damian looks at him, Dick gives him a warm smile. He gestures for Damian to take it, which he does. \"...You knew flowers where always her favorite. She always found beauty in them no matter what kind.\"Dick starts to tell Damian about you. \"Yes, I know\"Damian tells him\"But, please go on.\" Dick smiles to himself he then gives Damian a half smile look\"...\" Back with you\"Richie?\"you look at your little Robin in its' silver cage. You take him out as he hops onto your shoulder you smile at him, when you look down and see your are not wearing your normal clothes. It was much more exquisite, it was a long chinses kimono, something a of higer rank would wear. Yours though was a beauitful deep rich purple with golden petals emborded into it. As well gold trimmings on the end. You stand up and look at yourself, when you realized the room you where in was also of anicent Chinese with a mix Japanese style. Your room was bigger then the one at the manor. It was fit for a Empress or someone. You find a mirror and look at yourself, you where dressed just as suck with golden hair piece. As you touched, someone came into you room. You turn and see it was Talia. She dressed in a lovely chinese dress, though her's much more formal and tighter, she looked like a goddess. She smiles at you warmly, you smile at her and go over to her. \"Talia, you're alright.\"you tell her happy to see her well. \"As you too child\"she smiles back at you, you look around, then back at her. \"What about Damian?! Is he alright\"you asks her worried. \"He is well, with his father\"she tells you. You relax hearing that\"Good, so Mr. Bruce is here too?\" She didn't say anything, but you where able to read it\"...Child\"she puts her hands on your shoulder\"...Come with me\"she tells\"There is much I must tell you.\"she guides you out of your room. She explained everything to you, from your capture, Damian coming to free you and your death. As well how you where brought back to life, and why you where here. It was Damian's wish as he knew the amount he had from the Lazarus Pit, so you had to be given to his mother so she could take you and heal you the right way. Also, Damian felt you would be best protected away from those whom would hurt you. Away from the darkness he told his mother, Bruce had also agreed to it as well. Your cousin was well infromed. Talia told you, that you would be staying here with her. You where in shock from all you heard, as you both sit outside over looking those training. She watched as you took in everything, you wished you had a say in this, sadden by this news. Talia comforts you, just as she touches you. You bring your head up, with tears in your eyes but a smile on your face. You look at her. \"My beloved ninja boy is always trying to protect me...\"you tell her, the wind gently blows your hair. Talia was amazed at how you handled this. She smiles to herself. When she felt you resting your head on her, she looks down at you, she tenderly motherly hug. Something you had always wanted all your life, you hug her back as mother does a child. You look up at her, as she looks down at you tenderly, brushing your hair back. She then looks over at those training, you do the same. She brings you infront of her, with her hands on shoulder, you look at Richie, you knew Damian had his mother bring him back with you. As you smile at the little Robin, as it perched firmly on your shoulder. End.[Chapter 7] Ok so there is a new Batman animated movie coming out, the squeal to Son of Batman, so I am bring Violet back. Here is my prequel to the story showing you how she comes into the movie hope you like it. The movie does not come out till next month on the 14th In the glorious headquarters of League of Assassins a well hidden place, where the best of the best train. To serve under the might Ra's al Ghul, who no longer apart of the this world, the responsibility would have fallen upon his grandson. Damian Wayne, who was not present either. The leader now, mother of Damian as well daughter of the late Ra's al Ghul. Talia al Ghul, a striking lovely woman who like her father held an air of superiority. She was now incharge of her father's empire, though many expected her to have a feminine touch compared to her father, that was not the case. The apple did not fall far from the tree. She like her father had iron fist when running the compound, expected nothing but the best from those who survived her family. Beauty, brains and deadly a perfect combination, making her a worthy foe not to be under minded, if so. There was a price to pay. Even so, that did not mean she didn't have a heart, having a son, with the dark knight himself, Batman aka Bruce Wayne. Slightly soften her, but at the sametime made her even more deadly. There was nothing she would not do for her child, but it was not just her son that gained her motherly love. No, it was another. A young girl whom, her son had grown a immense high level of attraction which of course he being raised as a assisan did not fully understand. All he knew was that this fragile meek girl caught his uncanny eye. Though Talia along with his father and others could see it much more. But to Damian, he still try to figure it out, with all his observation skills and training to pinpoint and kill. He could not see it. He had fallen in love, he was hard and she was not. To polar opposites, yet both the same. For the girl who took hold of young Damian's affection, Violet Grayson was her name. First cousin of Batman's old ward Nightwing aka Richard Grayson. Found on a mission that he and his mentor teamed up to do. Finding a young girl in a such hellish harsh environment, to still mange to hold on to the bit of hope she barely had. She was taken out, and became part of Bruce's home out of request of Dick. To have a better life, there she thrived, despite her unnatural talent. Her dark power, that made her live in such hellish place. Darkness was all she grew to know, and was forced to inflict and enjoy the same darkness she had onto others. It was sick, but she did it anyway. Still even so, she manged to turn into a lovely girl. Though not much of a socialist, she preferred more intimate relationships, ones she shared with Alfred and her cousin. Not afraid to offer her hand to help. Her 'normal' as it could world turned when Damian came in, she was thrilled to have meet him, and from Batman's request took it upon herself to help him settle in. It was hard road, but she didn't mind. Of course this came to a intriguing confusion to the young assassin who was not very familiar with her approach grew to tolerate it, and soon grew to only for himself enjoy it. Violet did her best to keep Damian away from the path of vengeance, even exposing her powers to help heal him. Only for it to back fire upon her, capture and taken by Deathstroke aka Slade Wilson. Held captive, Damian already having to save his mother needed to save Violet. Which he manged to do, but only for it to be in vain, for her to die by the hands of same man who killed his grandfather. Killed right infront of him, the one thing, the one precious thing to him. Out of impulse something he was not use too, he manged to save her. Bring her back, through broken heart and tough decision he asked his mother to care for her, and keep her safe. Not wanting her to experience nor get hurt on his behalf, he sent her to be with his mother. His own personal need for her to stay with him, did not out way his desire to not lose her. Knowing well he would not see her for who knows how many years. He let it happen, and away she went. Thousands of miles apart each living in the home of the other. Damian held onto the locket, a keep sake. While she held to the name she began to call him. Ninjaboy. Talia was more than willing to allow the girl to stay with her, having grown found of her during their short unfortunate circumstance time together. She approved of Violet for her son, without the girls knowledge. Taking her in as her own daughter, to be protected and groomed to become the perfect partner when the time was ready for Violet and Damian's union. The fabric of fate had started to began to weave. Now, months have passed the sun brightly shone in the sky above the headquarters Talia dressed in a elaborate tight fitted emerald green mandarin outfit with gold trimming. Stood on the large balcony as she watched her men training the large training grounds, her hard green eyes did not take one second off, looking for any sort of imperfection, to for now find none. Her backed turned but that did not mean her awareness was not sharp, hearing light footsteps approach. They stop by her side, addressing her properly by her title, and whisper in her ear. Informing her, Talia nods her head, when she hears familiar graceful foot steps approach, along with a familiar tweet sound. Her stone face, turns to warm turning around to her ward, you Violet Grayson. Her soon to be future daughter, dressed in short light powder sky blue with silver vines designs woven in with a few leaves Cheongsam sleeveless dress and flats to match. Your frame was still meek but not as much, there was a small bit of muscle from your rigorous training, your black was now much healthier looking with a glossiness added to it. Your bangs swept to your left, while the rest of your hair laid in two pigtails upon your shoulder. With your little robin resting upon your shoulder diligently. Looking to Talia, she smiles warmly at you. Gesturing for you to come closer which you do, standing right by her. She turns around giving you her full attention but still making sure her members performed well. \"Yes, mother.\"you properly greet her. Talia places a loving hand upon your shoulder.\"Are you well my child?\" You look at her, there was nothing you could not get passed her in anyway, she was pretty preservative just like Damian. By the troubled look in your eyes she could see it.\"Come, let us talk.\"she dismiss the member who came to inform her so the two of you could talk. She turns back to those below you, look at them too but not so much like Talia.\"Speak my dear.\" Inhaling softly, you began.\"Mother, I asks for your permission to go back to Gotham. I must return only for a little while.\" Talia remained quiet.\"My sweet daughter, you very well why you must not return. I promised my son, you would stay here.\" \"I am aware of that. But...that's just it...\" There something in the tone of your voice was that was different from the previous times the two of you have had this talk.\"What is it?\" Your eyes drop.\"Something is amiss, I can feel it. I don't know what but it is.\" Talia turns fully to you, her eyes widen, she knew you where not lying infact she could tell.\"You can feel it?\" You nod your head head\"I can, I keep having this same dream, and it's getting stronger. It's about Damian and Mr. Wayne...I'm scared something will happen. Something is not right with Damian. I can sense him even from here.\" Seeing the pleading and worried look in your eyes, she could see just how much this was taking effect on you. The slight bags under your eyes. Knowing your powers have grown and you have learned to get a better handle upon them, this was different. She didn't expect you to be able to sense from this far away. But whatever you where was now starting to turn itself into something that has been hunting your dreams. You waited for her to say something, her face was unreadable to you. You where about to plead again, but she stops you holding up a hand.\"I give you my blessing daughter.\" Hearing that you sigh happily in relief.\"Thank you.\" \"You are welcome, but you must not go to where they can recognize you. No, you must change yourself, conceal your very presence. Do not make Violet Grayson known.\" Nodding your head, though you didn't want to do so. You had too. In your room, you look at yourself in the mirror holding scissors up to your pigtails. Closing your eyes tightly and cut each pig tail. Talia stood at your door unseen as she watched you conceal yourself, your identity for the sake of her son. She couldn't he more prouder. Your handmaids came to help you with the rest, they blocked her view but she didn't mind, and leaves. Night set upon the dark city of Gotham, crime in its very core. You looking out from your massive size window on the top floor of your temporary residence for the time being, until things became settled. Talia made sure you had the best of the best when you arrived back in Gotham. She had a two of the members accompany you to pose as your 'parents'. It was hard to believe you had been gone for some time, a huge part of you wanted to so badly reach out to your cousin, but you couldn't promising Talia you would keep yourself hidden and wrap up what you needed here. Still it itched for you to go by the manor and see everyone's faces once again. To see your garden, to make cookies with Alfred. Those memories made your happy yet sad. Sighing, you look at yourself in the mirror, you didn't look like you. Not at all, your hair was much shorter now in a pixie style though you still kept you bangs, your hair you had dyed into a winter white, and with the help of contacts you changed your eyes color from violet-blue to soft hazel color. Lifting up your mask to conceal your lower part of your face, looking at yourself full body now. Dressed in tight flexible yet still breathable dark maroon shorts with a tight meridian halter sleeveless top, you had long tight gloves to match reaching just under your armpit, with dark flexible metal Jika-tabi to you, two tonfa on either side of your legs strapped closely to you. Giving yourself one last look, you where ready.[Chapter 8] Alright here is the first chapter of the sequel for the movie, Batman vs Robin, which you can see now. Hope you like it, sorry there really isn't much talking going on. The night was dark, foggy and cold, the environment of snow suited the climate, even though in your attire you barely felt the chill, luckily you had packed for this or better yet Talia made sure you had everything you needed depending weather. In the shadows you watched from up above an old abandoned toy factory with one of members from the league who came with you, dressed in their attire waited with you. Looking down from the roof the factory down below. Your eyes stayed upon the only figure down below using a flashlight to see. Damian. Damian Wayne. Who now owned the mantle Robin, like your cousin had done many years ago. You felt your heart flutter happily at the sight of your dear friend. Though only knowing him for such a short time, it was nice. You never really bonded with others your age well, it wasn't that they didn't like you or you them. Due to your powers and history you even with your sweet smile and personality you still build up walls around others. But with Bruce, Alfred Dick and Damian you didn't. Mainly around Damian. He was a hard boy, you could tell right off the back. Reminding you so much of how you felt a lot inside, a mirror image of you. Which scared you just a bit, and also prompted you to turn his life around and soften him up just a bit, so he could see the good things. Despite the hardness. After what happen with you, and living with Talia for months and he with Bruce. What an interesting trade off, Talia cared and loved you, which you returned, but there was something. That made you feel... Hearing a dark high pitch scream, you focus your attention back to him. He was fighting off or fighting with what looked like children. Disfigured children like dolls. It was a horrific sight, that made you gag inside. But the again, you remember the Intel you had received about the current case Batman and Damian both where investigating. Thanks to your own personal skills and tech. Hacking into the Batcomputer, something you knew Batman would never approve of with you. But you did it anyway. Something wasn't settling right with Damian and you needed to watch over him to see what it was. It set you uneasy just feeling it from him. Tempted to help him, the member saw this. Placing a hand upon your shoulder, stopping you. Looking to them they gesture upward. You look and hear it to, something was coming. Quickly like the wind, you both move and hide, just as Batman comes crashing through the sky-window Unsure if he saw the two of you, hearing the sound of someone ramming the door open and hard heavy running footsteps on the snow, followed by deep scared breathing. Looking over the edge, you see a giant muscular man who looked like those deformed children running through the snow, followed by in hot pursuit by Damian who disappears through the trees. Your eyes follow him, just as your feet did, running you jump from the top down. The member follows your movements. Quickly, taking out a cable you shoot it and pull yourself up just before even touching the snow. Flipping up, like an circus performer, just like Dick, you make the landing on the branch just fine. Looking for any sign of Damian, you trace him through his dark emotion felt his anguish. You easily absorb it into you, but then again you had to keep an low profile. Knowing where to go, using the trees flip your way to him, the member behind you. Coming just a few feet away from Damian, staying hidden so he would not sense your presence. Still remembering you are still new at this. So you had to be careful. Squinting down, your eyes on Damian who had the man pinned down with his batrang at this throat. Your eyes widen in fear, out of impulse wanting to stop him only to be reminded not act. Feeling a hand upon your shoulder, you calm yourself outside, but inside you where not. Looking to Damian, he doesn't kill the man instead let's him leave. Sighing happily that he made the right choice, praising him for his choice. Standing up, looking to other with you giving a nod that you where ready to leave. Turning your back to ready to go, when you hear gurgling sound of someone chocking, turning around quickly. There stood a person, with a body frame of a man dressed in stealth like armor outfit. That seem to resemble an owl. Holding in his talon gloved hand a human heart. You gasp slightly, which the member quickly covers your mouth. To silence you, and leave just as the owl dressed man turns to look in the direction of where you once were. Making it back to the penthouse. Being greeted by the other member of the League, a woman around at least 25 with fair skin, chestnut hair with eyes to match going by the name Saia. Seeing your return she respectfully greets you. \"My lady, you've returned.\" You nod to her, though before you could say anything. Richie your little Robin comes fluttering over to you. Perching upon your shoulder. He came, Talia had sent him, after you requested having his presence with you. Happily using a delicate finger and pet him. He chirps from your touch. \"How is the young Master?\"Saia inquires. Looking to her, she awaited. You knew why, she was to report to Talia to inform her of your findings.\"He is...fine. Working with the Batman.\" Turning your back to them making your way to your room.\"Please excuse me, I would like to rest. Please inform my mother.\"Wishing them a good night, you shut the doors and lock them. Richie looks at you, then flies off your shoulder over to window. Tapping it with his beck, smiling at him, he knew you well. Going over to the balcony, opening the door, stepping out. Richie chirps to you, fluttering his way he lands on your shoulder, looking over the railing with you. Carefully, picking him up you place him back inside. He looks at you, his small beady eyes questions your reason. Smiling at him, planting a small soft kiss on him.\"I will be back.\" Turning from, and running for the balcony jumping off over the side, taking your cable to use and swing you safely to the next building room top. You land tumbling just a bit, but it was alright. Keeping up your speed and scale the next the roof top. Thankful it was night, which help conceal you greatly. Focused on where you needed to go, your heart pounded just like your feet on the ground. And with every leap, your heart was in sync with it. Finally reaching the place, you look up at the walls. The walls you grew to feel protection and warmth. So many things happened behind these walls, that made you smile under your mask, placing a hand recalling the memories you could think of. The first day you came to live here, how the gates opened for you allowing you a home and family. Feeling your hand trembling with sadness. Quickly you take it off. Looking for a way to scale the walls, remembering how you use to walk around learning the nicks and crannies. Thinking back and remembering. It then clicked, taking off the left towards the back. Flip down landing carefully on the wall, your foot barely there for a second before you flipped off into the lushes gardens. Looking around, at everything the bush animals where still here, they kept them. Walking through them steadily, you remember making these a hobby that Alfred had thought would be good for you. To express yourself. Which surprised him, at how well you manged to detail the bush animals. That you did more, making a zoo admitting that you had never seen animals like this or been to a circus. Which of course reached Bruce. And that same year for your birthday with the help of Dick made that dream come true. Rented out the whole Gotham Zoo as well rented some performers so you could experience what you missed out. Dick even preformed for you. It was one of the best things to happen. Bruce cancelled everything that day, even came back early from his night as Batman to blow out your candles with you with a single cupcake you made since he missed the actually blowing of the candles. Smiling to yourself, at the memories. You had to admit, you missed it here. Though you knew you shouldn't be here, remembering what Talia had told you. To stay away from this place and only watch and look after Damian and keep yourself hidden. Feeling a bit guilty for disobeying her, but should know you would do it. This was a part of you, this was your home. Plus you needed to be here, to keep a closer eye upon Damian. Thinking back to the emotions you felt after the Dollmaker was murdered. Something in him seem to slip, not sure what it was. But whatever it was, was causing your ninjaboy turmoil inside slowly. But you could feel it rise. Needed to see for yourself if he was alright, you such for him feeling his emotions. Taking hold of it, you to him. Scaling the Wayne Manor. Finding a window, you crack it open carefully, and slip inside. Doing your best to make sure you carefully shut the window. Keeping your senses up, sensing anyone who was coming. Grateful for the training which you received with your powers. To help you better control them, you manged to use them as sensors encase anyone try to come up from behind you. Seeing no was here or around. You stand in the middle of the hall, looking around. Memories of laughter echoed in the halls, with Dick chasing you for fun or when you helped Alfred clean up in a fun manor. You felt so free, no care in the world, something you the others wanted to give you, in a sense a normal childhood, to heal those wounds inflicted up on you during your dark life from before. Itching to run down the halls, but held yourself against it. Now was not the time. Staying within the shadows,hurry to find Damian. Passing room after room, when you come to a stop. Infront your room door, you often wondered if the room was kept the same, after you left. Doing your best to stay strong and not have your own emotions overflow. Still, did not stop you from opening the door. With your hand on the door knob ready to turn it. But stop, letting go of it. This wasn't your home anymore. A honest, yet heartbreaking truth. This was not your home, so you had no right to go into that room. Turning your back to it, and continue towards Damian. Finally, you find him. In the library, sleeping on the couch with a Charles Dickens, book in his arms. He looked peaceful, which made you smile. But it was not because of his peaceful slumber no. Squatting down, closer to his face it was the fact you had missed him. So badly you wanted to hug him, and cry happily. That you had your friend back, all those months away and not staying in contact. It felt weird, it was like the Wayne Manor all over again at the League of Assassins Monastery, all adults. No one your age, but when Damian came when you use to live here. Everything changed. Wishing you had a choice to choose whether to live with Talia or Bruce. You would have chosen here in a heartbeat. You had so many ideas of how the friendship between the two would blossom into things \"normal\" kids your age would do. But that was taken away, by the choice he made for you, which you learned to understand that he did because he just wanted you safe. As his mother put it, he didn't want to lose anyone else like he lost his grandfather. Often, you wondered if he missed you just as much as you did with him. Reaching out hand but stopping yourself, when you noticed something silver, like a thin silver wire bracelet around his wrist, your eyes trailing to his clutched fist. Your eyes gasp, you couldn't believe it, it was your locket. The one you had thought you lost, he had in his possession this whole time. The way he held it, was tight and secure. Tears well up, wiping them away. Leaning over him, just inches from him. Your open eyes over his closed ones. Remembering what Dick use to do with you, you get ready to do Damian. Only to stop, hearing voice quickly you melt into the shadows and leave. Making it back to the penthouse, Richie was sleeping but awoke when he heard you coming in. He perks up chirping to greet you. Taking off your mask and breath normally. Opening your hand, the little robin comes and lands in it. Walking to your bed, you sit down on the large California King size bed. Thinking of what just happen. A satisfied warm happy smile comes to your lips. Back at the Manor, after Damian dressed as Robin tired to leave only to be foiled by his father who stopped him, due to the security measures he placed around the Manor. Upset, the unruly boy makes his way to his room. Which was still in the same place just not to far from Violet's old room. He stops for a second before going into his room, sliding his green eyes to her room. Thinking back when he first found out their rooms where not to far, ever since she left he never had his room moved to any other room. His eyes stayed on that spot, balling up his fist. He takes out the locket he had taken from her that Dick allowed him to have. Looking at it longingly, his hard green eyes soften just ever so slightly. Thinking back to when he was sleeping, he felt the presence of another over him. Like some sort of protector. It was something about their presence, that calmed his ranging mind. He was sure, it was her. But then again, she was safe with his mother. Placing a hand on his forehead, where he felt their light breathing. Looking back at the locket, he was sure he felt her. Turning the knob to his door, opening it. And went inside.[Chapter 9] Another night, and you where ready. Wishing Richie a good night, you leave with Saia this time accompanying you on your observance this time. Focusing hard, locking onto Damian. You follow it, scaling the rooftops with ease and grace. Saia stayed close by your side. Tracing Damian's boiling yet settled rage to the slums of Gotham. Hearing the others being beaten, you knew it was Damian, letting his own anger out upon those he was delivering punishment to. Stopping in the shadows staying hidden, but also with a view on Damian who took down two muggers. Ready to deal the final blow holding a pocket knife in hand. Standing up again praying he would not cross that line. \"What are you waiting for Robin?\"a deep calming voice from the shadows. Looking around for owner of the voice, silently you move closer to get a good look at owner of the voice. Who still kept talking to Damian.\"Men like this don't deserve to live. I won't finish it for you this time, the decision has to be yours.\" Realizing what he said, it then clicked in your mind who this person was. The same one from the toy factory who took out the Dollmaker's heart. Hearing the urging in his voice for Damian to finish them. Scared you, keeping your hope up that Damian would not cross the line, looking back to the boy. Who looks at the knife then to the muggers unsure what to do. Your heart went out to him, seeing him feeling slightly conflicted the man leaves, though Damian follows him. Asking his name, which he tells him. \"Talon.\"Then takes his leave, and Robin follows him. \"My Lady, it would be wise t-\"Saia speaks only for you put up a hand to stop her. \"I mu-we must follow him. To get a better understanding of Talon.\"you tell her.\"Something does not seem settled with that man, and I fear he might be plague on...Damian.\" Following your order, the two of you follow Damian from behind. Doing your best to stay out of sight and hidden. From both Damian and this Talon character. Coming to a stop at what seem like a loft of some sort. Hidden from sight, watching the two go inside. Saia wanted to so bad to protest this, but she was under oath to follow your orders. So she remained quiet. \"Stay here.\"you tell her, before she could say anything you leave to move in closer to get a better look. Laying on the ground of the rooftop, you carefully lift your head to look in down into the skylight at both Talon and Damian. Though you could not hear them, your eyes where able to piece them together. Sensing Damian's emotions in a way sync with Talon's like some sort of kinder spirit between the two, though there was some sort of slight difference. You could tell Damian seem pleased with something. That worried you greatly, this Talon person you felt was corrupting Damian, like a fly to honey. Making you feel sick to your stomach. Placing a hand on the glass, not realizing you had made it move. Which caused Talon and Damian to look, only to find nothing but a pigeon there. Saia holds onto you, with your mouth covered hidden well in the shadows. Her heart rate lowered along with her breathing, which you follow behind her, slowing your breathing and heart rate. Feeling Damian leaving, Saia still kept her guard up, until she felt it was ready to leave. Still holding onto you, she quickly takes her leave with you back to the penthouse. Jin, the other member from the league a well toned man with short black hair and brown eyes he was Asian descent. Hearing you and Saia coming in he respectfully greets you. \"My Lady, welcome home. How was your outing?\" Saia places you down. Before you could say anything, she does.\"Forgive me my Lady.\"She looks to Jin.\"My Lady almost was caught, her actions or impulses upon Master Damian almost blew her presence.\" Jin looks at you sharply.\"Is this true?\" \"...Yes.\"you admit.\"I'm sorry...for my action. But Da-\" Jin holds up his hand to stop you from telling any sort of reasoning why.\"Whether your actions where noble, the Mistress rules where for you strictly observe Master Damian. You are not to make yourself know, now I am sorry but I must still report this to the Mistress. She will not be pleased by your actions.\" Feeling like bounded chains upon you, seeing there was no way for you argue your case, you remain quiet and nod your head understanding. Jin turns to report to Talia. Saia felt compelled to offer you a sense of comfort. Seeing it was her who informed Jin of your reckless action. She reaches out to you.\"My Lady, please understand...\"her words became tender.\"Though your deed was noble, you cannot be seen by Master Damian. No matter how much it compels you.\" Hearing her words did not ease you inside, thanking her though you take your leave and retire to your room. Only to be called by Jin, who required your presence. Making your way to his room, he stood up over a chair for you to sit down in. Which you do, he twirls the chair to face forward pushing you in. \"Hello, my daughter.\"Talia speaks, your eyes widen turning around to find her on the screen of the laptop. She looks at you with a disapproval and stern look. You knew right off the back she knew about what happen tonight. Your eyes drop submissively.\"Mother, please forgive me for my actions...I-I..\"you try to think of what to say. But nothing came to mind. \"Jin, informed me of your outing tonight.\"she calmly states.\"You where almost caught? My daughter, you asked for my blessing to see what is causing my child is distressed emotion, which I granted you. But you must remained concealed from his very presence. Was that not part of the deal we agreed upon?\"Without a word back, you nod your head.\"You must learn to better control yourself, concerning my son. They almost relived your presence.\" \"I tired to mother, I did...but...Damian's...his emotions cloud my own...\"you tell her, she could hear the deep concern in your voice that pained you.\"I wa-\" Talia holds up a hand, quieting you.\"Whether it is so, you must learn to block them out. Yes I am fully aware of your deep attachment to him, which is also your downfall...if you wish to stay out there to oversee Damian then I suggest you learn better control over your deep level bond with him. Do not let it cloud your judgement in anyway. You are to be confined to your room tonight and for the next three evening as well.\" Your head shoots up in protest, but you declined to speak. Instead accept her decision.\"Yes...mother.\" Talia though her eyes where firm, they soften. She dismisses you. Talia's words kept echoing in your mind, though you understood her concerns and she was just being like a mother. It was just that, though you did your best to stay out of sight from Damian and the others. Didn't stop you from wanting to revel yourself to him, you had the strangest feeling that if you did, it would calm him. In some way, and calm you too. There was a torrent inside of you that would not be settled. Following her rules, because after all you where now her ward. But the way she was starting to confine you, almost felt like your much older life. How those people would control your every step, force you to do things you never wanted to do. But where forced none the less, never giving you a mind of your own. Like a rivers current you went the way they told you. This feeling of being confine never settled well with you, but growing up with learning to be submissive and obeying without any questions was embedded into you, into your psyche and stayed there. The chains of restrain never left, even when you had lived with Bruce and the others. Nothing but being told what to do, but remembering when Damian came, he helped to break you out of those binds allowing you sense the sweet taste of freedom of free will. Starting a small fire inside you that still burned despite it being covered. Wanting to follow your very own mind, you had to be there for Damian and pull him out of his darkness out of the wild ranging storm within him. That you felt was reaching its point. He was lost and didn't know what to do, though of course he would never say such things. He didn't have too, you could feel it that it became your ever thought. Yes, his emotions overpowered your own, and you didn't care. There was a reason why they did, still Talia's words came down on you, chaining you down. Blocking you from any sort of reckless action you felt compelled to do. Torn between two, be obedient and follow Talia or act upon your own desire and go to Damian. Looking at yourself in the mirror you pull up your mask, Richie comes and lands upon your shoulder. The door to your room was open, walking to it looking out to the living room, Saia and Jin both knocked out cold. No, you didn't kill them, just slipped something in their drink. Going over to Saia placing a letter right by her. Apologizing to them both. Thanking them both for their protection, turning back running to your room. Grabbing what you needed, your weapons attached to you. Richie perched on your shoulder. Racing to the balcony, jumping onto the railing, giving one last look to your room. Your mind made up, for the first time in your life. Turning your back, looking out over the city. Richie flies off just as you jump off. Focusing hard, you pick up Damian's signature emotion. Using that you go to him, this time you would be able there for him.[Chapter 10] Landing hard on flat surface of the roof top to a building, not stopping you kept it up running. Richie flew at his speed keeping up with you the best his little wings could. He was by your side, not leaving. Jumping to the next one, feeling Damian becoming closer. He hadn't move but you knew something went down, because what you felt from him the guilt mixed with pride and satisfaction. Not sure why, but whatever the reason it didn't sit well with you. Flipping down, landing in an ally way. Right by a manhole, looking around to make sure no one had seen you. Richie comes and perches on your shoulder. Looking around you find a steel pipe and use it, to help you lift up the manhole. Struggling at first, but you manged to get it off. Richie chirps nervously. Looking to him. \"You don't have to come.\"you tell him, holding a finger out for him. He looks at it, then to you. Puffing out his little chest, his way of saying no. Smiling at him, for his noble character. Still, picking him gently you set him down looking at him.\"I can't have you hurt.\"putting your nose to his beak, he chirps sadly knowing what you where doing. Lifting your head back with a sad smile, you wave by to him and jump doing into the manhole. Leaving the sad little bird. Who chirps for you to return. Dropping down into the sewers. Which smelled pretty bad, but luckily you've had your fair share of disgusting smells. Running through the low water towards Damian who was now closer than ever. Telling yourself, you where coming for him. Making a quick left, coming to a dead end. This was strange, felling Damian's presence behind here. Slowly scanning the wall, remembering one time what Bruce had told you. Nothing is at it seems. Placing your hand on the brick wall, slowly gliding it across. Feeling anything that seem out of place. Anxious you had to calm yourself otherwise you might miss it. Closing your eyes, to get a much better feel. When your finger felt something out of place, opening your eyes. Gliding your hand back, feeling the misplaced brick. Pressing it, next thing a secret door opens. Moving back with your guard up, you find a tunnel leading to...Damian. Without hesitation you proceed down the dark barely lite tunnel. Feeling Damian getting closer, when something spiked in him. It was anger, this time this anger was different then his other ones. It was scared anger, something you never thought he would release. Fear came over you, not wanting to think the worse of what might happen to him. Pushing yourself harder, you felt other emotions mixed in with his. Others running in fear for their lives. As if something was hunting them down, soon you didn't feel them am more. Only death. Then Talon. Something in him twisted and snapped to the brink of psychosis. That seem to bring a sort of thrill from others fear. Yet at the sametime he remained calm. Feeling his twisted emotion, felt like sludge hammer. Stopping, you felt your body starting to react to these dark emotions. Feeding on them, doing your best to block them out despite the agony your body was starting to feel. Damian needed you, pushing through the pain like before. Remembering what your sensei that Talia had hired for you. To remain calm and not allow these emotions to take hold of you. Even if they wanted to swallow you whole, find a way to redirect them, expel or keep them back till you needed them. Holding it in, Talon's emotion where to strong. Falling down, your body started to transform. To its darker state, feeling your body jerk from the feeling. Wanting to scream, but you chose against it. Using your willpower, that you had. Trying to focus on only one person at this moment. Damian. It was hard to sense his emotions now that everything was becoming clouded. Thinking back to what Talia said, you couldn't help but agree that she was right. You where not ready. Your submissive side was starting to take over, which allowed Talon's emotions to easily take hold of you. Clawing at the ground, gasping for air. Reaching out for nothing for no one. Vision starting to become blurry, calling for anyone to come and save you. Eyes becoming heavy, giving into the waves of emotions. Your body finally reaching its limits. Apologizing to Damian for not being able to be there for him. To rescue him. Submerging to the feelings. Your body laying there, unmoved. Curled up in the fetal position. When you felt a sharp spike of energy or emotion. Not sure what it was, but you felt it. It jerked you up, sharply gasping for air. Inhaling hard and exhaling just the same. Coughing hard, your body starts to gag, ready to throw up. Holding your mouth, as you gag. Holding down whatever wanted to come up. But your body wouldn't let you keep it down. Throwing black muck twice. Looking at it, it disgusted you. It soon started to evaporate, when you realized what it was. Talon's emotions. Your body expelled them out of you. Standing up staggering, wiping your mouth. Holding your head just a bit, remembering why you where here. For Damian, picking up his spiked distress emotions. \"Damian!\"you become alarmed, forgetting to recover you hurry and run to him. In just a few seconds you come and find yourself in some elaborate like Colosseum arena of some sort. It was pretty nicely designed. With very exquisite taste, not for the dead bodies wearing white owl masks you saw in the seats and around you. Now scared of might have befallen Damian. Leaving the bloodily arena, pushing open double doors, gasping at more dead bodies wearing the same mask. Seeing the way they where executed no doubt was done by an elite. This was not Damian's work, no it was someone else. Swallowing hard, but regaining your true priority. Running away from the bodies, tracking Damian you come to a white room, with what looked like red coffins of some sort. The tops where open, looking in each one, not see anyone inside the large holding tubes. Grabbing the edge you fling yourself down the hole. Landing hard, but that didn't matter. Running through, calling out for Damian even though you could feeling him. Stopping when you hear something drop and glass break. Not to far ahead of you, seeing the water and particles of glass shatter. Knowing right off the back who it was. Damian now Robin, was able to get himself out the his 'cell' Talon put him in. Thankful for his early training since a young age, managing to break the tube that connected to the tube, spilling out the water. Reaching out his arm grabbing hold of a lever, which dropped the tube breaking it upon impact. Coughing up the liquid he almost ingested. Regaining his senses, he was sure he heard a familiar voice calling to him happily. A voice he hadn't heard in months, but that didn't mean he forgot about it. Hearing that voice call out to him, made the boy feel serene and joy. Even with his stoic look. \"Damian!\"extra weight came on him, almost knocking him down if he didn't catch himself and the person who hugged him tightly. This hug he remembered it well. This important embrace he grew to cherish even if never would say it. Feeling their arms around him, he wasn't sure if this was a dream. But in a dream you couldn't smell someones scent. It was when he heard them say.\"Ninjaboy.\"He knew right away who it was. Grabbing their arms, prying himself out of their arms, looking at them with wide eyes. Only for them to turn into confused one. A girl at least a year older than him, who sounded just like the person dear to him. But instead of black long hair he knew, it was instead white and cut in a pixie style. And instead of those sweet blue-violet eyes that held such deep compassion where hazel ones. A snarl look forms on the boy. Seeing this, remembering how your appearance. Seeming a bit hurt by his reaction but you couldn't blame him. Calling his name softly, you take out your contacts revealing your normal eye color and bringing your masked around your mouth down. Damian looks harder taking off his mask, he realizes it was you. \"...Violet.\"he looks at you with his usual scowl, but you could see passed it. He was just as happy to see you, just as you where him. Everything seem to stand still for a few seconds, during this reunion. When he remembered Talon. Getting up quickly.\"Come on.\"he tells you, nodding your head getting up. Damian grabs hold of your wrist pulling you with him. This time you didn't stumble, which surprised him. Taking out his communicator he calls Alfred and informs him of how to stop Talon's army, by making sure the temp is subzero.\"We have to hurry to the Manor!\" Nodding your head agreeing. Lifting your masked back up to cover your mouth. Taking your wrist back from Damian, you run next to him. Surprising him, something changed in you since those months apart. You still looked the same besides the hair, but something about your personality changed. Normally you would be meek and back down, this time there was something else. Just like with him, something changed with his time away from you, yet it still remained the same. Hustling quickly to the Manor, you felt Batman, Alfred and Nightwing's hostile emotions. Worried about them, you and Damian scale the walls of the Manor racing across the lawn. Finding a broken window, the two of you slip in. Damian helps you inside, running down the hall. Damian stops and turns to you.\"Go and help the others!\"he tells you, knowing your mind was mainly on Dick. He then runs off leaving you. Nodding your head, you focus on Dick and make your way down to the Batcave. A place you had not been in sometime. Though you wanted to start and reminisce now was not the time. Looking you see a army of Talons fighting the others. Looking for you cousin, you spot him fighting another man with dark either red or maroon hair the same length as your cousin. Who was putting the beating on Nightwing. Your heart skipped, taking out your tonfas. Jumping down into the fight. Landing on one of the Talons using them to push yourself off, while knocking them back in the process. It the other Talons to realize you fighting for Batman, and started to attack you. But you didn't go down easy, jumping from to another. To reach your cousin. Barely dodging them sharp claw gloves. With the last one, pushing off them coming to where the leader was with Nightwing by the case of Robin costumes. A surprise attack, that took Talon by surprise. Coming up hitting him in the face with one of your tonfu, which took him off balance. You then go and drop down kicking him hard in the chest but at the sametime you transferred some of the negative energy you held in, powering up your kick that transferred it to him. Blasting him back, standing protectively infront of Nightwing, who was baffled by your sudden appearance, mentally tell himself not say anything about being saved by a kid. Twirling your weapons, waiting for Talon to come. Nightwing was about to say something when he got a closer look at you. His eyes widen when he realized who it was. \"Violet!?\"you hear your cousin call to you. Pulling down your mask, showing he was right. He overwhelmed with joy to see you, if circumstance could present themselves much better. He would embrace you in a hug. But instead, he gets his guard up as Talon comes back with lashing yet refined focused attacks on the two of you. Nightwing quickly throws you out of the way, taking the blows. Getting up quickly, the temperature drops in the cave, stopping the other Talons. Batman was able to do it, sighing happily. Only for that moment to end, when you hear Nightwing's agnostic grunts.\"Violet!Run!\"he yells in pain. Looking your eyes widen in horror seeing Nightwing pinned by two blades in shoulder on the costume case. Talon turns his attention to you, holding his claws up ready to come at you. No an ounce of sympathy in his eyes, that burned deeply with bloodlust. The fact you where a minor was of no concern to him. Thinking quickly, he saw it blocking the tonfu you throw at him, breaking it with his own strength. Seeing the fear in your eyes, pleased him. His agility was faster than you, before you could even leap over the railing he manages to hit you back hard with his knee. Then come down and elbow you in the spine. Slamming you hard down, you yelp in pain. Which alerted the others, Nightwing screams your name. Standing over your body, Talon makes sure you didn't move. Seeing you didn't even move an inch. He goes off to finish what he came here to start. Pain surged through you body, mainly through you spine. Hearing Nightwing call to you, waiting you to respond. Pushing yourself up, stumbling at first but you manage to get up. Hearing a fight happening, along with grunts you knew to well. Looking the best you could, using the railing to help you up. Your vision a bit blurry, but you still made it out. Squinting your eyes, looking to see that it was Damian fighting Talon. Who now had the upper hand, Damian falls down.\"NO!\"you gasp, with the strength you had forgetting about your pain. Limping turned into running, jumping off the side of the rail right where Talon who held up Batman. Ready to give the final blow. Your eyes glow as your skin turns dark. Your hands out.\"DON\"T YOU DARE!\" Talon looks up, you land right on him around his neck. And slam your hands on either side of his temple. He screams as you send a wave of the corrupted emotions you held in you, unleashing it onto him. He screams in pain, trying to get you off him. But you didn't let go, holding on with all your might. Your skin starting to return back to normal, knowing that everything you held was gone, you give one last good wave and jump off, kicking him back. Stumbling just a bit. Talon, still screamed in agony. That took you a great deal from you, falling to your knees but catch yourself. Smoke coming from you, breathing heavily. Looking you see Batman was fine and so was Damian. \"V-Violet?!\"Batman surprised by your presence. With a exhausted smile to him.\"H-Hi Mr...Bruce...I mean...Papa.\"he smiles softly back at you. He looks at your hair, noticing the color. Getting up you go over to Damian, and help him up.\"A-are you ok?\" He nods his head, about to say something when his eyes widen. But it was to late before he could alert you, and the second you turn around. Talon had his grip around your throat. Lifting you up with great ease. His grip became tighter, you began to claw at him. But it made no difference. Damian snarls at him.\"Let her GO!\"he yells along with Batman. Talon looks at you then to the boy. A sadistic smile appears.\"She means that much to you, doesn't she?\"Damian narrows his eyes threatening to the man, who was able to the answer. His grip tightens on you, that the others could hear what sounded like neck bone and spin crushing. Digging his claws into your skin, blood started to drip from it. Damian saw it, his eyes widen. \"STOP IT!\"he demands. \"She's just like Batman, both of them are holding you back. I'll just eradicate them both.\"his grip tightens more, your body unable to handle it and with lack of oxygen, Damian and Batman watches as your arm goes lip. Talon then goes and picks up Batman.\"Now...say goodbye to them both.\" Growling, Damian on pure adrenaline fury attacks Talon who drops the two of you. Batman manages to catch you, before you hit the ground. He looks down at you, seeing the marks from Talon's glove. Looking he watches his son fight off the man, to protect not just him. But also you, stating that Talon would never be able to replace Batman because he was his father. And that would die before allowing you too. Seeing the it in his eyes. Talon prompts Damian to finish him with the sai he had pointed at the man. But Damian refused to so. So Talon did it for him, he steps into the pointed blade impaling himself on it. Startling and leaving Damian tainted. Before he died. Filled with anger and frustration over what just happen. Confused not sure what to do. His father saw it. Getting up, with you in his arms. He goes to console his son, who looks down at you. Confessing to his father how he felt he should have killed Talon, along with how he hears Talia, Talon and Batman's voice in his head, and not his own. Not knowing who he was, being troubled. Batman sympathizes with his son, knowing his son was right, that he needed to leave. Telling him about a Monastery in the Himalayas that went there when he was troubled years ago. How the monks there helped him. Damian at first denied the help but thought it over. His eyes still on you. Bruce saw the deep concern in his sons eyes for you. The same look he had months ago with you, when he sent you off to live with Talia. Feeling unworthy and wanting to keep you safe. Damian places a hand ontop of yours. Without words, Batman hands you over to his son. Who holds up his hand denying you. \"No...I don't deserve to.\"he tells him. Looking away.\"I need to go pack.\"looking at you one last time he leaves. Batman watches his son, then looks down at you he knew his son wanted him to watch over you. While he went away to gather himself and find himself. And when he did he would be worthy of you. If you want to, listen A Thousand Miles when you read this part. Waking up, finally. Your vision a bit hazy but it was still alright. Feeling something soft under you. Realizing it was a bed, sitting up in a familiar large bed. In a room you knew all to well. It was your old room in the Manor. A jolt of remembrance came, Damian. Jolting up, the pain caught up with you, you stumble out of bed. Pushing your pain behind you call for Damian. Flinging your door open, dressed in satin nightgown. You go to his room door, knocking on it over and over again. Calling for him. But he didn't open his door. You repetitive knocking echoed through the Manor. Alfred, Dick and Bruce come rushing to you. They find you, knocking your last knock on his door. Your head upon his door. They remain quiet, hearing your whimpers figuring out for yourself that he left. Sliding down, onto your knees mouthing his name. Feeling the presence of the others, you look to them. Your eyes land upon Bruce, who gives you a sympathetic look. His look did not help you, your tears came more with crying sounds echoing through the manor. Burying your eyes in your hands. Shaking your head no, wishing he was hear. Without saying a word. Dick hurries over to you, embracing you tightly. Letting you cry on him, again he chose for you. To keep you safe, far away from him. You came back to see him again, and though the reunion was short, you hoped that this time it would be better. You would be able to stay, and continue the friendship. The many ideas you had for the two of you, going to the movies, doing school activities together, enjoying the holidays together. So much you had planned that you wanted to do with him. But now, that would not happen. Instead of sadness it became replaced with anger. Dick could sense it, he held you tighter. But you get up and push him away running back to your room. Shutting the door hard. Wanting to go after his cousin to comfort her. Feeling a hand upon his shoulder, it was Bruce who looks at your door. Dick looks back too, understanding to give you space. Getting up, Dick leaves with the two men. To give you time alone. Sitting in your room, with your back to the door to prevent anyone from coming. Crying angry tears. When you hear familiar chirping sound. Looking at your open window. Richie comes flying in. He lands on your hand you had open for him. He ruffles his feathers looking at you, happily. Surprised that he found you, you left to go free. So he wouldn't get hurt, but yet he came back. Ignoring your order for him to go. Wiping the tears from your eyes, Richie chirps again. Standing up, you smile down at the little bird. Thanking him. In the cold Himalayas Damian covered in mountain attire, with a thermal jacket looks as the snow blows aside giving him a clear vision of the Monastery his father told him about. Where he needed to be, to help him figure out about himself. Just as he lifts his masks up, he hears footsteps approaching in the distance behind. Turning around, he looks waiting to see who it was. The footsteps became closer, with his guard up, that is until he saw who it was that came. His eyes widen, surprised to find you. You stood there right infront of him. He was speechless. You look at him with hurtfully eyes. He never felt so guilty from the look you gave him, he knew why you gave him that look. For leaving you behind, so he could deal with what he needed to on his own. So you would not be caught up in it. Behind your hurt eyes he saw anger, tired of others telling you want to do. Your eyes spoke demand. Demanding that you choose not anyone else. But through all that, he saw how happy you where to be with him. How important he as to you. Damian kept his scowl up rolling his eyes in irritation at your presence.\"You are a very stubborn, girl.\"he tells you. Hearing a chirping sound, he looks, seeing this you unbutton your thermal jacket as well, showing him a bundled up Richie. Which baffled the boy. That you brought him all the way out here.\"You do realize, his kind is not meant to be in the cold?\" He looks at you, you smile behind your mask at him.\"Yes, but...he would still follow me. Either way. So...I couldn't live him behind. I care for him way to much.\" Hearing your words that paralleled with the current situation right now. Looking to the little bird, then to you. A small smirk appears on his lips. He digs into this pocket, your attention on Richie, making sure he was alright. That you didn't see Damian coming over, until you felt him place something around your neck. Looking realizing how close he was to you. Looking passed you, when he felt your eyes on him. Finished with what needed to do, he looks right into yours. Locked, both eyes locked on eachother. Damian arches an eyebrow at you.\"What?\" You couldn't help but giggle sweetly at his denseness. Which of course he assumed you where mocking him. But left it alone. Looking to your hair.\"Tell me, that will grow out?\" You touch your hair.\"Yes...it will.\" \"Good. Because it...\"he turns his back to you.\"Doesn't suit you.\"he slightly mumbles the last part, covering his mouth with his mask. He looks to the Monastery.\"I have a lot to deal with. To find myself.\" You stand next to him looking at the place as well. Shaking your head no.\"No.\"you tell him. He looks at you, but you kept your eyes straight at the place. Grabbing hold of his hand, tightly. He looks at it, then to you. Which you finally look at him with your smile.\"We have a lot to deal with. Together.\"your grip became tighter. He scuffs nodding his head.\"Yes...that we do.\"he looks at what he put around your neck, you do as well and see it was your locket. Your eyes light up, looking at him. He gives you a half smile, but a smile none the less. Feeling his grip tighten with yours.\"Let's go.\"he tells you. Nodding your head agreeing. The both of you walk off towards Monastery, hand in hand. Ready to find yourselves and become stronger, and would return back when ready. But right, you both had eachother and nothing was more important. Hope you enjoy the ending. :) sorry if there was only three chapters for the story. But again thank you to everyone who has read it. I am glad you enjoyed it :). If you have any questions let me know. :) plus I have a feeling some of you might ask if there will stories of their life at the Monastery.[Chapter 11] So here is the new chapter of Batman Bad Blood. Hope you enjoy it. I will be taking away the Epilogue chapters. You sat in center of the room, away from others in the monastery in the half lotus position, eyes closed, legs crossed one foot is placed on top of the opposite thigh with its sole facing upward and heel close to the abdomen. The other foot is then lifted up slowly and placed on the opposite thigh in a symmetrical way. Richie upon your left shoulder. Your hands in Anjali mudra or Prayer mudra position, pressing the palms of the hands together. The fingers are together with fingertips pointing up. The hands are pressed together firmly and evenly. In the center of your chest. Your body remained calm, still and upright, your breathing slow and just as calm. The look on your face was bleak and focus, it had to be. You had to be, to find your center when utilizing your powers. Sensing and absorbing the negative emotions not just here, but expanding it to further reach. Being a conduct for these emotions that seem to just drawn to you like some sort of unquenchable thirst, since coming to this holy sacred place it seem to just increase. Remembering how it hit you like a sledge hammer, the impact from these emotions almost over took you. It was strange, because when you use to live out there in real world it was never like this, sure you could sense them, but you where able to choose when to take them in. Now that didn't seem the case, well now it was bit better. The Head of the Monastery, the Ganden Tripa decided it would be best for you to stick to mediation when you came here. Telling you, that you must find your center. To keep it burning, with it burning you would be able to control this new sensation of your powers, that felt like a wild fire, always felt like it was burning. Even in your dreams and in meditation at times, the emotions didn't seem to stop. Like some sort of outside of force was behind this, it was hard for you tell but you could feel their overwhelming dark power towering over you. It frighten you, while also made you curious on why this was all happening. There was never an answer, instead you would hear this small faint voice telling you, no. Followed by a gentle touch that took a hold of your hand pulling you back. Which made you find your center again and expel this new darkness. And by expelling it, you realized you could transfer them into or onto something else. It amazed and frighten you, but the Ganden Tripa worked with you. Guiding and telling you to not fear it, instead to see it as a gift and learn to utilize it. Listening to his teachings and words, you did just that though it was hard. Because the first time you unleashed these emotions upon the target, you where filled with such guilt. But soon realized that you had to be calm and throw out all your fear. By doing so, you managed to take control of who or whomever you unleashed the emotions on, taming the beast before you. This new way of using your powers was much different than before, when you would unleash these build up negative emotion to cause harm to others. Or when you had trained under Talia, she teaching you how to amplify it more and put people in a near coma state. This time with your abilities, from the training you received here broaden them. Just as long as you remembered to keep your center. A center that, left a yearning in you whenever you thought of it. And because of this, it caused you to struggle. Stopping you from pushing forward, you tired to search your center to find out what it was. But it was either you came up empty or you refused to acknowledge it, blocking you. As the Ganden Tripa would tell you. His words rang truth, but he never told you what it that kept you blocked, only it must be important for it to prevent you. Mediating on his words, begin to frustrate you but you kept yourself focused upon your center. When you felt that dark malevolent presence creeping up on you. Like a hand was reaching out to you wrapping, their hot strong hand slowly wrapped around your throat. Cutting off your breathing, suffocating you. This presence began to break your focus upon your center, Richie noticed your face twist into a struggle. He begins to ruffle his feathers and chirping madly. They echoed throughout the halls, his noise didn't really help you. Becoming a bit annoyed by it, trying your hardest to remain calm and not give into your fear. While a hand reaches out to you, it lands on back. Their touch jolted your eyes open and your body. Causing Richie to flutter off startled, just like you. Catching your breath from being startled, the hand still remained upon your shoulder and turns you around. Your eyes lock onto Damian's hard green ones, that focused on your condition. His way of checking to make sure you where alright and apologizing seeing the gleam of softness in them. Besides that, you saw something urgent too. Not to mention the fact he wasn't dressed in his orange robe like everyone was suppose to be here, instead he was dressed in the clothes he wore when the two of you first came here awhile back not to mention he had on his hiking pack. And he was holding yours too along with your clothes. \"What's going on?\"you stand up, he hands you your things without a word. Instead takes out his electronic device, while you get dress. He kept his eyes down on his device swiping through till he located what he needed to show you. Changing in front of Damian was never uncomfortable now, at the beginning sure. But since the two of ended up living with each other and shared the same room and bed, it wasn't an issue anymore. He never actually watched you dress or change, keeping his eyes away. Being respectful or in his words: \"My eyes have more important things to look at.\" Saying that with a straight face while his back was turned, even when it came to bathing. He would keep his eyes away, though when it came to you. It didn't bother you, having seen more than you needed to from your old life. But those bodies where not moving and alive. It still wasn't much a bother, though you keep your eyes adverted only if you needed to help Damian when it came to him putting on his orange robe that he seem to have trouble with. Zipping up your jacket you where ready to go, and Damian found what needed to show you. Handing your the device you look at the screen and gasp in shock at what you saw. Playing the news report of Commissioner Gordon talking about how Batman was missing and that GCPD would do just fine without him. It wasn't what Gordon said, it was the fact Batman was missing. Understanding now why Damian was dressed and ready, the two of you where going back to Gotham. \"Can you handle it?\"Damian asks you, his eyes slide over to Richie then back to you. Understanding his concern, you simply give him a reassuring smile.\"Yeah.\" You and Damian make it outside, where you unzip your jacket and take out Richie and place him on the snowy ground, and put your hands back into the Anjali mudra form. Calming yourself and pushing your fear away, your begins to turn black. Like always, every time you used your powers, your eyes glowed the same color. Everything in you just be filled with negative emotions. Once you had them, you unleash them upon Richie. You and Damian stand back and watch the little bird. \"Forgive me.\"you apologize to him. Once it was done, you turn to Damian.\"Let's go.\" Without Batman around anymore in the city of Gotham, it was harder to keep track of crime. Especially with crime leaders. Down at the docks in one of the warehouses, the crime lord Black Mask with his men unload a crate of illegal guns. The man goes over his merchandise. \"New guy thinks he can move in?\"Black Mask.\"I'm going to show them who's top dog around here.\"He takes out one of the guns, holding it. \"Gotham's MY Bitch.\"He cocking the weapon. Unaware of someone watching from the shadows. \"Which makes you mine, Mask.\" A dark deep voice rang through the warehouse, surprising everyone. They look up and see on one of the beams overhead, Batman. \"You're suppose to be dead.\"Black Mask snarls.\"Let me fix that for you.\" Aiming his weapon along with his men at cape crusader and fire their bullets. To which Batman evades them going into the shadows, leaving the gang on their toes looking around to where he might be. Being cautious and ready, but ready enough Batman comes and takes out one of the men. Then another one and another, Black Mask shot at him, but missed him every time. Batman goes in and takes out the crime lord, kicking him back into a car, standing over the man. Not aware the crime lord's men surrounding him and start to shoot. Quickly thinking, Batman takes out his grappling hook and manages to avoid the bullets. The men still kept their guns locked on Batman, while Black Mask grabbed his and gets ready to join, when a sai gets thrown at the weapon and it explodes on him. He begins to scream in agony and pain, the aslant makes themselves known. Standing over the man now, Damian now dressed as Robin. Angered by this, Black Mask orders his men kill the boy. The get away driver of the big rig starts up the vehicle and starts to drive off, while the man in the back of the trailer open fires with the machine gun at Robin, who moves out the way and begins to purse. Meanwhile Batman was still dealing with the rest of Black Mask's men, when someone else drops down and lands a pretty good round house kick on the henchmen, knocking them out. Surprising the Dark Knight, he watches them swiftly take out another person. Before rushing off to help Damian. Knocking out the last of the men, Batman looks to see the figure no taller than Damian or maybe an inch shorter than him. Dressed in dark maroon tight shorts, with a tight meridian halter top sleeveless top, long tight gloves to match reaching under their armpit, and knee high metal jika-tabi. With two tonfa attached to either side of their waist. Only able to see their back side, he had a feeling on who it might be. He knew that meek body frame, that started to develop. He knew that smooth cream color skin, and that dark black hair which had grown since the last he saw and it was no longer white. \"Violet!?\"he watches the figure chase after the truck and jump on the top of the trailer.\"VIOLET!\"Knocking out the last guy, Batman rushes after the girl. With you, you land on the top of the trailer to the moving big rig. Almost losing your balance, but you manged to stable yourself looking up ahead where the driver was. You hurry and race on the top, while the shooter in the trailer heard you and aims at the ceiling and starts to shoot at you. You manage to dodge the bullets, but it made it difficult for you to balance. That you tripped back, and rolled off the top and off the truck. Flying back to the ground, push from the high speeds of the wind made it hard for you grab onto something, flinging off the top a hand grabs your wrist quickly and pulls you into the trailer with them. Holding onto you protectively, telling you to hold on as they take out the gunman, while the truck began to swerving violently. Rocking you and the person who held onto you. Allowing you to wiggle out of their hold, which was not a good idea, because you stumbled back. But managed to use this and flip yourself up just fine before you flew out of the back. Feeling the trailer starting to lean sideways, your body followed. Batman manages to knock out the gunman and turns his attention to you. Assuming you where in danger he reacts and grabs hold of you. Tucking you under protectively and jumps out watching the big rig crash along the large crates on the dock to explode down at the end. \"Argh...\"Batman groans. When he remembered you.\"Violet!\"he looks back down at you, scanning you over with his eyes seeing there was no injuries. He did notice your new hair style a Asian inverted bob. He sighs in relief and embraces you in a hug. The second he put you down. This hug came out of nowhere from Batman, which was unusual of him. Because he would normally never show affection like this, only back at home he would with you. Which made you come to the conclusion this wasn't Batman at all, but someone else. There was only one person you knew who would give you hugs like this. This tight and secure. There was only one person who always felt worried about you know matter what, you always felt it. Dick. This was your cousin Dick or aka Nightwing, dressed like Batman hugging you tightly. The same hug he gave you when he first found you, filled with happiness, protection and promise. Even though it felt the same there was more to it, relief, anguish a bit and above all joy. He was happy to see you, to have you back again. It was nice, very nice to see him again. Something inside you though pained you, it felt tight. Guilt. Remembering how you just left him, when you went to follow Damian. Though this reunion was to be happy, you couldn't help but feel a bit guilty right now. Even after leaving, your cousin still held his love for you. Something you had to admit to yourself, missed greatly. You wanted to hug him, but something inside you stopped you. And Dick realized this, this was not the reaction he was hoping for from you. Before he could say anything, Damian drops down, breaking up the little family time. Dick stares at the boy with a disapproving look and a hostile one at that, and Damian stares right back hard and the scowl on his face. \"Damian.\"you go over to him and hug him. Almost knocking the boy over, but he manged to hold his balance.\"You're okay.\" \"Yes. Why wouldn't I be?\"he replies, trying to dismiss your concern over him.\"...Please release me.\" You smile under your mask that covered half your face, you still held onto Damian. Which made him groan silently, he knew the only way you would let him go is if he said it. He was trying to be stubborn about it, refusing to say it. Just like you were with letting him go. But one of you had to cave, and he did. Sighing annoyed, he raises his arm and in one quick motion hugs you. If one could call it a hug. \"There.\"he mumbles. Content you let him go, and smile at him though he looks away from you to your cousin. \"..What?\" Dick narrows his eyes at him.\"...I could have handle this.\"Dick tells him. Then looks at you.\"Alone.\" His personality just shifted all of a sudden, from warm to upset and annoyed. Which you took a bit offensively. \"We where just trying to help.\"you tell him. Though Damian's words didn't help much.\"If that's your best Batman impression, your not going to fool anyone. Greyson.\"he gives him a smug smirk. Which annoyed Dick, who smirks back annoyed at the boy.\"Maybe you'd like a megaphone to announce that.\" Feeling the tension between the two you step in-between them both.\"It wasn't very hard.\"You tell your cousin, siding with Damian on this one.\"You're method and skills, were...a bit sloppy.\" Which only added more to the tension already. Dick looks down at you about to object but decided against it. The big rig explodes once again, the three of you look at the huge mess that was made. With that the three leave the scene and head to the Batmobile.[Chapter 12] Damian looks down at you in his lap, in the Batmobile. He kept his arms securely around you nothing really new. He was more focused on ou condition right now, the side effects from your powers when you over extended them or pushed them too far. The strain and exhaustion it caused you, no matter what. He knew the two of you should have stopped for a rest, seeing the toil you had put on yourself to get back here to the city faster. Behind his mask and eyes his concern grew, normally when you over extended yourself it took just a few minutes of resting and meditation. Now that wasn't the case, you sort of looked a bit sick but nothing to server, just paler than before. He just reminded himself it would pass, that didn't stop him from tighten his hold on you more. No doubt if you this was your side effect that Richie also felt this way, looking at the dashboard to the little bird nestling there. Just as tired as its owner. Damian mumbles to himself about the two. Dick who was driving slide his eyes from the road to Damian's hold on you. He grunts irritated by what he saw, enough for Damian to hear him. And to not care really. \"Take a picture, it'll last longer.\"Damian tells him. \"...Hands where I can see them.\"Dick said in a threaten subtle tone. Laced with hidden warnings to the boy. Who couldn't help but smirk quickly before Dick could see, you adjust your position in Damian's lap resting your head more on his shoulder. He didn't mind at all, but Dick did. He kept eyes upon the two. \"Shouldn't you keep your eyes on the road?\"Damian tells him. \"I am.\" \"Sure. She's not sick.\"Damian tells him, to ease his mind.\"It's just a side effect, that's all she'll be out of it in no time.\" Dick looks down at his cousin, her condition didn't seem to reflect what Damian said or could have been the way he said. He was about to say something when Damian does. \"There's no way your going to pull this off.\"Damian chaste Dick.\"Without my help.\" \"Modest as ever I see.\" \"I'm more Batman, then you'll ever be.\" You moan softly moving again in Damian's arm, then again a few more times. Like you where having a nightmare, you started to cough hard as if you had lack of air. It was back again, that strange feeling from before creeping up on you. Their hand wrapping around your throat, the smell of fire, brimstone and darkness or was it something else. Whatever it was started to feed off your fear, you begin to feel these burning eyes looking down at you with superiority and dominance. Demanding your submission, these malevolent eyes seem to look straight into your soul seeing and sensing your fear. It was like they had their hand in very soul and began to pull at something. Your center. Their grip on it began to crush it, trying to break it. The pain was mild at first but started to become excruciating, you get ready to scream when something. So other sort of essence came to push back this evil force away from you. Their presence was mysterious, yet familiar too. They seem to push the evil presence back, telling you not give in and to wake up. Saying your name, which surprised you, before you could to them they some how managed to push you back. Waking you up or was it the words from Dick who became alert someone was following the Batmobile. Whatever it was, that strange presence was gone and you felt better for now. Damian realized you had started to come back, which was good if he could say that. He noticed the look in your eyes, the same one you've had before when it first happen. Pinching your brow you for a second to focus and come to your senses. \"What's happening?\"you question the two. \"We're being tailed.\"Damian fills you in.\"Hang on, your cousin is new to this.\" Earning a grunt from Dick. Looking at the screen to the back camera on the Batmobile you see who was following all of you, a lady dressed in batsuit with a red Bat symbol just like Batman's on center of her chest, red long hair on a motorcycle. \"Who is she?\"you question out loud. \"We'll find that out soon.\"Dick tells you. He does some pretty sharp maneuvers to try and lose her, but she stayed on tightly. Which was pretty impressive, though not enough Dick was able to put some distance between himself and her, it was enough he turns into the alley and parks. Telling you and Damian to get out, which you do though your speed was not on their level since you where still coming back. But it was enough to hide from the woman who came just a few seconds after. Parking her bike she gets off, and scoops out the car. Carefully. \"You've been following me all night, I want to know why?\"Dick steps out with Damian and you. She was a bit startled but hid it pretty well. She kept a straight, stern face on. \"First tell me why you're running around playing Batman?\"She demands more so than question, she turns her attention to Damian and yourself. Then back to Dick.\"I'm guessing Nightwing?\" She guessed right, you couldn't help but not to laugh.\"Hm, busted.\"Damian quips to Dick. Making you snicker a bit more, your cousin slides his eyes to you shushing you. Which you quickly try to conceal your laughter.\"S-sorry.\"you clear your throat. And turn your attention upon her bike. Stroking it \"Natural, I think he's more than cable of fooling most people.\"she comes to his defense. Then quips to Damian.\"And you're certainly not going to pass as Batman, short stack.\" You tired to hold in your laughter on that too, Damian turns around to you trying to climb onto the motorcycle with his scowl. Making you stop.\"What?\" \"Just who's side are you on?\"he snips. Turning back to the woman.\"Who the Hell are you?!\" \"Damian, don't be rude.\"you tell him. The woman didn't seem to take what Damian said to her offensive.\"Easy Robin. And can you get off that please.\"Dick calms him down and tells you. Which you climb off the motorcycle, slightly pouting the woman smirks at you. Dick turns back to the woman.\"Tell me what you want and why you've been following me?\" \"I just want to make sure.\"She tells him.\"You see I was there the night Batman died.\" Her news stun the three of you, though you showed it more. The thought of what she said hit you like a sledge hammer, you couldn't believe it or didn't want too. She saw you express it more, clearly telling her you had some close relation with Batman. The look you gave her reminded her of herself when she was younger, from that tragic experience. She gives you a sympathetic look, but pushed that aside telling Dick to follow to the area. She lead everyone to the blown up facility, you walk by Damian look around. You could feel the no sense something that was once here, like an empty shell but in pain and yearning. Along with hate. It was weird, almost mirroring Damian's old emotion, almost besides the emptiness you felt. This detachment, whoever left this imprint scared you no it worried you. Stopping to look out at the water of Gotham sea, this presence just lingered. It was strong and intense. Against your better judgement, you touch the rotting handle of the railing. Something you regretted doing. Because what you felt and saw was to much. A large bulking man wearing some sort of full face bat mask in way. It was just a quick flash, way to much than you could bare. That you semi changed, releasing your grip stumbling back almost losing your balance and would have fallen over the other side if not Damian who quickly saves you. The others rush over to you, you look down at your hand now seemingly burnt for some reason. This was new, this never happened to you before. Feeling those emotions start to over take you, you quickly start to calm yourself down. Controlling your. \"Is she alright?\"the woman became concern. Damian kind of blocked the others from coming to help you. Refusing their assistance. He looks you over.\"Are you okay?\" Rubbing your temple you nod your head.\"Yeah...I'm fine. Just fine.\"you assure him and stand back up. He guides you until you stood up.\"So what about Batman?\" You return back to the matter at hand. \"Aren't you a tough cookie.\"the woman compliments you.\"Come on.\"she leads the three of you to edge of the blown off platform.\"He threw me clear and saved my life. Before I could get back up here, it blew apart.\" \"And where suppose to believe that?\"Damian unconvinced about her story. \"...\"You stand there looking over the area. A part of you just couldn't believe he was dead. Not Batman, not someone like him he couldn't be killed that easily. There just had to be more at work here. Wishing you could just single out his emotions, but that never happened unless you where in a close proximity of that person.\"...Father...\"you mumble silently to yourself. Shutting your eyes tightly, thinking of the memories with him. He came to rescue you along with Dick years ago, he took you out of Hell and brought you place called home. Though he was stand offish at times and distant, he was still kind and loving. That look in his eye, told you he would do whatever he could to protect you. Telling you he was strong. He was one of the strongest people you knew. With him you always felt safe, remember that one night you couldn't sleep when he was out on patrol and because of that you stayed up until in the Batcave, till he came back. That's how you found out, and when he came back you ran to him, hugging him, welcoming him back just as you feel asleep on him. So what this woman was saying, just couldn't be true. Not at all, he couldn't be dead, he wasn't gone. No he wasn't, not by a long shot...well a least you hoped. Feeling a reassuring hand upon your shoulder, snapping you out of it, you turn around to find the woman. She smiles at you quickly. \"Stay strong.\"she tells you. With that she jumps off, using her cape she forms it into a glider and leaves. You couldn't help but be amazed by her, her Independence, her boldness, just everything about her. Still though the idea of Batman... \"Come on, let's go.\"Dick tells you. Doing as he said, you follow him and Damian back to the Batmobile. During the ride it was quiet between the three of you. You still sat in Damian's lap and he kept his arms around you, while you held onto Richie who was doing better. You stroke the little guy for comfort. The three of you no doubt thinking about Batman. \"Do you really think he's dead?\"Damian speaks the question you and Dick had. \"...I don't know.\"was Dick's response. Looking straight ahead in deep thought and reflection. \"He can't be dead...someone like Mr. Bruce would-Go down like this.\"you think about it.\"He just wouldn't...Right?\" You felt Damian's grip on you tighten, no doubt for comfort and assurance.\"He's not gone.\"Dick does his best to assure you. \"You'd like it wouldn't you? If he never came back!\"Damian's words came out hostile, spiteful and cruel. Coating his actual feelings.\"Then you get to keep that suit.\" Quickly Dick steps on the breaks hard, stopping the vehicle. You almost jerked forward, but he quickly puts his arm out stopping you from lunging forward, he looks pass you at Damian hard. \"I've struggled for years to get out of Bruce's shadow. To build a life for myself, as far away from his world as possible. And the last thing I want is to be wearing this DAMN thing.\"he points to the emblem. You kept quiet wishing you could sink into the shadows. But you understood Dick's feelings, towards Batman/Bruce. Always feeling overshadowed or not able to live up to his expectation. He did struggle trying to separate himself from the man, moving out on his own starting a life of his own. Often feeling his mixed feelings of love and hate for the man, that use to make you sick. Damian, didn't seem to understand or he was just hurt and said what came to his mind, or maybe just jealousy towards Dick. Whatever it was between the two, it connected back to Batman. The tension between the two was enough to suffocate you. Luckily though it was interrupted by Alfred, who found the information that Dick had asked him. You sigh in relief on Alfred's prefect timing, greeting pleasantly, he does back to you. He brings up the information about the mystery woman, Batwoman aka Katherine Kane. Whom Dick knew and you through pictures Dick showed you of his younger days in the Academy. You remember meeting her once at a Charity Ball, Bruce was hosting. She was kind and funny. She often looked at you sort of affectionate, like you reminded her of someone. This was surprise that she was Batwoman and about her background from what Alfred informed everyone. It was dark, how her, her mother and twin sister where taken hostage. Kate was the only one who survived, and because of that traumatic experience she wasn't the same. Being kicked out of the military, going down a dark path. Making her dangerous from what Batman had on her. This didn't sound the Kate you knew, this one was cold and ruthless, not kind and funny. But then again it was understandable, living through something dark can change a person, you would know that more than anyone. With that information from Alfred on Batwoman, Dick though it best to call it a night. Which at this point wasn't a bad idea.[Chapter 13] Their presence you could feel it closer now, more than ever. That sense of protection that cloaked around you, it was dark but not evil. They couldn't be, right? Looking at straight at them, some how they managed to get into your mind. It was hard to make out their face, as it was concealed by the cloak they wore, that seem to merge with the darkness. They stood over you broodingly, staring at you. It was hard for you read what it from them, like spirit they floated off the ground, only at least a foot between the two of you. You could feel your fear beginning to creep up over you, doing your best to keep it at bay, if not than it would over take you. They seem to sense it as well, their hand reached out towards you and rest upon your shoulder. \"Don't give into it.\"they tell you.\"Don't give into your fear, don't do it. It will only make it easier for them.\" Their words were comforting and serious yet sympathetic and full of concern. It made you wonder why this mysterious figure cared so much about you and the fact they seem to be connected to that looming dark and evil feeling. Like there was some sort of tie between the two. Seeing the skepticism in your eyes, they seem to understand. You were weary of them and curious as to they could be. This was the actual first time they made them selves in a sense physically present before you. Times before it was just their quick presence, coming and going now it was here. Even if you could not see their face nor body. There had to be a reason why they concealed themselves, another question they saw in your eyes. Their own eyes yearned so badly to tell you everything, but it was their own fear or protection they felt, that made them resist to such a thing. Knowing if you knew what they knew, why you were starting to be visited by the malicious presence, that haunted them all their live would only make it worse. So this was what they could do right now with you. Come and fend off that presence that clearly you could not control or keep at bay for very long. Unlike them, you where an easy target that could be consumed by that evil presence. A presence they knew laid dormant or was held back by something else. To be unchained the second you left Gotham City, to travel with Damian. The presence knew it could not sink its claws into you, there was no doubt you what you were going through was painful and strenuous, your abilities seem to be going haywire at times. Meditation seem to be the only thing to work, for a short period of time before the urge over took you. And once it did, they became aware and came to your aid, they had more experience than you, dealing with this. This power was never seen a gift, more so as a curse. And the type of person you are told them, it was unfair and not right. But what could you or they do? These powers were forced upon the both of you. And looking at you, they saw you knew at least that part. The other question was, why? One in due time they would be able to tell you, just not now. Lifting their hand off you, sliding it back into their cloak. \"Never forget your center. Do not give in. Do not. Never let them win.\"they tell you, their voice sounded young yet mature. Almost like a sage.\"I will be here.\" With their last words, they faded away. Your eyes shoot open, awaking from that strange dream or place? You weren't sure really what it was, all you knew was that it felt so real and haunting. Giving you the chills, that it caused you to shiver. Tossing the covers off you, swinging your legs over the bed and stand. Looking around the large room, that you where given returning back to the city, back in the manor. The same room you had once lived in here with Bruce awhile back, it hadn't changed. Nothing had, everything remained in tact which was nice to see. It still remained clean no doubt from Alfred. Even in a darken room with only the light from the moon, the room still remained the same. Your bed was still here, your desk, even your laptop remained in its same spot. Such fond memories, made you smile with a bit of bliss. But it faded as soon as you felt a chill, shivering again which as unlike you having lived in the Himalayas for some time, you had grown in a sense use to the cold, temperature wise. Wrapping your arms around you not just for comfort but to stay warm. Standing there in your pj's, silk teal colored shorts and t-shirt and barefooted. Shivering a bit more, turning around to your empty bed sadly. Damian wasn't in there, no, he was sleeping in his room courtesy of your cousin, Dick. Who made sure the two of you slept in different rooms definitely. Because of Damian who was about to accompany you in the bed, when Dick caught him. He became highly upset, which Damian took no such quarrel about it. Bluntly telling him that the two of you shared a room and bed together back in the mountains. His choice of words to the adult did not help at all, especially when Damian told him that he had sleep in the bed with you. For certain purpose, words Dick took the wrong way. So you slept on either side of the Manor. And knowing Dick he most likely put up some sort of surveillance should Damian try anything. Which you felt he was over doing it, and it did irritate you, because you actually needed Damian here. When you woke up in middle of the night or late nights. His presence always allowed you to go back to sleep, once you finished talking about it even if you didn't want to say anything. He knew, but without him by you, you now where awake. Walking towards the window, you stare out at the moon into clear sky. Wondering about the whereabouts of Bruce and that hooded figure in your dreams. One perplexed you, while the other made you shuttered. You started to wonder if coming back here was such a good idea? Life back in the mountains was deary, but calming. Then again you couldn't run away forever, thinking about you cousin upon seeing him. It was nice to reunite with Dick after such a long time, yet there seem some sense of distance between. It was mainly on your part, then you felt it from him too. In his eyes, you don't know why but you felt like you didn't grow, you felt his anger and hurt whenever he looked at you or spoke. While you wanted him to stop looking at you like such, but a part of you seem to fear it. Fear the unknown response of your cousin's real feelings or the idea his hurt was stronger than his feelings for you, fear he would not understand why you did what you did. Which upset you about a scenario that had yet to happen. This whole thing felt like a mess, that you tired to figure out who put the blame upon. Your mind wavered back and forth, only to add to your anger, that it started to effect you personally. The dark veins started to creep upon you, your eyes started to turn black. Your fear and anger began to merge together in an unhealthy way. You skin started to change color, that Richie who slept in his bird cage woke up, sensing it he looks at you watching as the negative emotions began to consume you. Filling you with something dark, realizing this you start to panic. Thinking quickly, before you lost all senses of yourself you try to search to find your center. Digging deeply, that malicious dark feeling began to make itself know. Using your fear against you, fueling it more. Getting ready to scream, when the touch of someone's hand snapped you back. But at a cost, you unleash your energy upon them. Slamming them back across your room into the wall. A stone look came across your face, your eyes quickly turned back to themselves when you realized who it was you shoot across the room. Dick. Dark energy crackled around him from your assault, gasping seeing this. You stood there wide eyes, unsure what to do. Normally you would run to his side to help him up, but you just stood there frozen like a deer in headlights. Dick quickly came to, rubbing his back he looks at you surprised and stun. It was hard for you see what it was he was shocked by, either what you just did or the fact you did go over to him nor say anything. The two of you stare at each other. Fear. He saw it in your eyes along with something, and you saw something in his eyes as well. One that caused you to have more fear and shame. \"Violet.\" Damian's voice breaks your lock on Dick, you turn to your door and see him come rushing in along with Alfred. Seeing Damian was a sign of relief, he looks from you to Dick. Quickly putting it together, he folds his arms keeping his gaze upon Dick. \"I told you.\" He tells the man, who grunts at his comment. Alfred waste no time and goes to Dick up.\"Are you alright, Master Dick?\" \"Yeah. I'm fine.\"Dick assures him. He cast his eyes over to you, which you quickly advert them away. Quickly excusing yourself before and run to the bathroom. Dick's eyes follow you even as the door closed. He signs to himself, he turns to Damian who too kept his eyes locked upon the door. Feeling Dick's eye on him, pre-teen turns to him with a slight irritated scowl. \"What?\"Damian tone was harsh. But not to harsh, he gives Dick a dismissal look before going after you. Watching Damian do the job he was to do, angered Dick to no end while at the same time he envied the boy. A fact he did not want to believe, his cousin clearly didn't need him and he seem to be okay with that. Even though his mind was telling him, despite the pain he felt in his heart from the distance he felt grow between himself and Violet. The day came, which quickly turned into night and it was back on the streets again to do the patrol for Batman. With Dick dressed as the Dark Knight and Damian as Robin, with you accompanying them again. The three of you in the Batmobile, with you like before sitting in Damian's lap. Everything seem quiet on the streets, which was good. Though you actually where hoping to run back into Kate or Alias: Batwoman. The thought excited you, thinking about her made you sway in admiration. But with a quiet night like this, there was no way she would be out and about. Plus the fact that Damian and Dick told you she preferred to work alone. A bummer really. In the ride, it was also quiet. Making it uncomfortable. Wishing for something to come soon, because this silence was really starting to bother you. Lo and behold what you wanted to happened did. A security breach was happening at Wayne Tech, Dick puts up the map and blueprints of company. To pinpoint the where the silent alarm came from. The sub division of the building. The vault. From what you knew about the building, it held a great deal of high tech devices and equipment, and only a few knew of it. With that Dick puts the Batmobile into high gear and speeds off. The thrust of the vehicle, took you by surprise just bit. Luckily though Damian held onto you prevent you from suffering any injuries. It didn't take long upon arriving to building, Dick used a secret entrance, a tunnel that allowed him to enter undetected and surprised the enemy. Coming shutting off the lights, he managed to hit one of them into the wall. Then releases flares from the vehicle to blind the enemy and provide cover for surprise attack on them. Dick jumps out first and attacks two of them, Damian was next followed by you. Using your tonfa, you throw at one of them. This strange looking man that shoot out electricity, knocking him over. \"What the?\"he growls, getting up he turns around to meet with your fist in face. Hitting him square in the jaw, adding some of the negative emotions into that punch was enough to send him back and stun him a bit. Picking up your tonfa, you turn around and see Dick having trouble with two of the assailants. One a brooding man, who felt so familiar and a bald head well toned dark skin woman of African lineage no doubt. She held a katana as she and the man wearing what looked like a full masked Batman helmet. He was bulking and well toned. Giving Dick no doubt a run for his money. Looking quickly over your shoulder, seeing Damian seem to be alright with his fight, you go to help Dick. The woman noticed you out the corner of her eye, she turns her blade to you. You narrowly missed her swipe, dipping under just in time, within that split second you followed up with a upward kick to her face. She moves back just in time, and comes right at you. Her movement and skills where far beyond yours. Luckily you had height and swiftness on your side. Not to mention your abilities. Which you felt rising from the rush of this fight. The adrenaline pumped through you, no doubt from the fear of you not wanting to be killed and fear of this much more experienced person. That fear began to consume you, so you had to figure out a way quickly to subdue it before it did over take you. Finding your center, you the best you could while mixing it with fury. Without Richie being here to transfer this feeling to, you had utilize it yourself. Again you focus, focus on your center keeping calm for as long as you body would allow it. It gave just enough to dodge her deadly strikes, looking for an opening to try and attack her partner. Because there was no way you could match her or beat her, seeing the opening. You take it, trying for an upper cut, she moves back which was what you need. Pushing off you rush her, jump up and flip over her. Using her back you push of towards her partner, hand charged up ready to land the hit. When he swiftly grabs hold of your wrist without looking and with ease. It sent chills down your spine, he kept you dangled in the air for a second and turns around to you. His other hand shoot out like an arrow and wrapped itself around your throat tightly. Holding you up in the air, he was strong. Very strong. His iron grip started to tighten around you, cutting of your air that you started to panic. Looking straight at him, his eyes behind those red lens in his mask scared you. They where empty, cold, ruthless and, and filled with confusion mixed with yearning. This deep yearning and desire for something. Like a child, but filled with hate. The man seem to notice you had seen what he had inside. Pissing him off no doubt, his grip became tighter. You kept clawing at him to let him go. But he did not let up, his eyes study you carefully. Realizing something, that made his grip on you tighten more. Having enough of this, and for a split second fear came over you. Allowing it to over take you, clasping your hands on his thick arm, your eyes glow as if they were possessed. Your look changed, your eyes turned to their black color with deep dark red slit pupils, your skin began to turn like always but this time instead of its dark gray it became red a deep bloody gray red. You send the energy you felt into him, it was enough juice and shock for him to let you go. Which he did, he drops you. Setting you free, though not before he took his payment for what you did to him. Rising his hand he slaps you back strong and hard, you flew across a couple of feet. Skipping across the ground like rock across a pond. Normally you would have gotten knocked out by something like that, but since you learned how to make yourself numb from the pain, it didn't bother you. Still you staggered to get back up, the look you had of deadly fury went away when you saw before you eyes. Damian. getting knocked back and down by his assailants, and then the one whom you fought before that shoot out electricity started to electrocute him. Damian tires not to scream from the pain, but does so anyway. \"R-Robin.\" You force yourself to get, angered now push off rushing to Damian's aid.\"Stop it! Leave him alone!\"you scream at them. But the man didn't stop, he kept electrocuting Damian no doubt he would fry his insides the longer he went. Having enough, you jump to lad a blow but he heard you coming and turns around taking a break from Damian, with his attention on you and fires a blast of electricity right at you. Causing you scream from pain, he adds a bit more juice to his blast which shoot you back away. Your body hits the ground rolling for a bit, before coming to a stop. Your body jolted a bit from the minor electricity that surged through your body. The man chuckles at this \"Awww, look at the two love birds.\"he mocks and turns back to Damian to finish what he started, only to be stopped and killed by the man in the Batman mask, throwing a knife right at his back. Saving Damian. Who was surprised by what the man did, but that did stop him from trying to purse him. He as still the enemy. Damian gets up and rushes after him and his crew who fled the scene. Too injured from the previous attack Damian falls down, luckily though Dick manages to catch him before he does. \"D-Damian...\"he hears exhausted and scratchy voice. He turns to see you slowly dragging yourself to the hole he and Damian where in. Your half open eyes look around, with your vision barely focused you managed to see Dick holding Damian. Relived he was well, with the bit of strength you had smile before passing out.[Chapter 14] \"I told you not to it over take you!\"the concealed figure in your mind snaps you. Making you flinch just a bit. Their frustration over what you had done, prior to your fight at Wayne Tech. Unleashing your fears making them surface, empowering with power far beyond anything you had ever manage to do on your own. The rush was just so great and overwhelming, how could you not give into it. Something just seem to inginte in you once you allowed yourself to be over taken just for those few precious moments. It was enough to shock your attacker, that man. But, at the same time you felt as if someone else was in control of you. Something dark and powerful, like that presence that seem to be looming around you, waiting patiently. And the second you gave in, it was like it pounced upon you and replaced yourself with them. Like a puppeteer it controlled your body. Like it knew how to use this new power, and you let them. It was so alluring, if not for the intervention of your mystery guardian who came in just in time to sever the connection in second you lost it. Who knows what would have happened. They brought you back to your senses, which you were thankful for. Though felt like you disappointed them and yourself, and Ganden Tripa, seeing the look upon your face, the figure realized you felt bad over what you did, yet confused too. They calm themselves down, expelling their frustration towards you. \"...Listen, there is a reason why you cannot let yourself be overtaken by such a fear.\"They said.\"To give in, to loose control is what they want. I- I mean we can't take that risk. If it that is to happen, then all Hell will break lose. No matter how alluring it might be or how much power it offers. You're young, you don't know. I understand that, and though you've had some training with your powers. It's not enough, your still naive which is another factor. Because you still don't know the full depths of power, your abilities, your heritage.\"They mumble the last part sadly. \"...Then why won't you tell me anything?\"you finally question.\"I don't even know who you are? One thing is for sure, you seem to be tied to that other presence. That dark, evil presence. I don't understand? Please tell me?\" They remained silent, it was hard for you see if they were deciding whether or not to tell you. This sense of sudden protection guard they had with you, mirrored your cousin's. He was just like this with you. Treating you as if you were fragile and delicate. Not allowing you to make your own choice. Even if it was out care and love from him. Remembering how you had inquired about things, about your life and your powers before. Not to mention his secret life, he felt it was best to keep you at arms length. Which was understandable to a certain degree, you two were the only family either of you had left by blood that the two of you knew of. Still though... Looking at the cloak figure awaiting their answer or response, but instead of a the response you wanted. They said something that was true and shocked you. \"There's something wrong, isn't there? Is it with your cousin?\" You didn't know what to say, your eyes drop to what seem to be the ground. They observe your reaction a part of them wanted to console you, but distant was the best comfort they could give you. If it could be called comfort, they hadn't come to you to be your consular, they came to you for their own reasons. Able to put two and two together it was clear to them, your cousin had some factor in your powers becoming a bit unmanageable, that and the other reason. But for right now, it was your cousin. \"Look, whatever it is you have to take control of it soon. And I mean soon.\"they said to you.\"If you don't then, that other force will. And that won't be good you nor anyone you care for. I won- I mean I can't have that happened. So you have to get it under control.\" Their words sounded more like a demand than a request. But also worried about it, even if they tired to mask it. Their gaze upon you told you, that you had better or else. The else part was what scared you, sensing this they realized what they said and how they said it, was doing the exact opposite. So they just readjust the tone of their voice to a calmer one the best they could, even if it was monotone. \"Just...remember to keep focus upon your center. Keep it guarded, do not loose control in anyway. We have a curse of having to battle everything about ourselves no matter what. Just one slip up and it's all over, we can become taken by the evil that lurks around us both. Our existence well...\"they stop speaking. Getting off topic, they look back at you.\"...Just keep your center. I will be around to keep that force at bay.\" With those last words they left and you woke up. You turn on the water to the sink in the bathroom, fill your cupped hands with water and splash it upon your face then grab a towel and wipe your face dry. Slowly putting the towel down, you think about what the conversation you had. But stood out was the part about your cousin, there was that same feeling again. The feeling you felt whenever you would meditate and Dick would come into your mind. Blocking you from unblocking the rest of your chakra in meditation. It always held you back, locking you down. Feeling you guilt and fear. You had a reason why, but you just refused to acknowledge it any way. Pushing it down, and because of it... Shaking your head, you didn't have time to think about that. You and Damian came back to find Bruce, that was all. Nothing else. Even if you did feel conflicted. Speaking of Damian you wondered how he was doing after the fight at Wayne Tech. He recivied some injuries. Throwing the towel down, you rush off to him only to stop from the sharp pain in your arm. Slowing you down, forgetting almost about your own injuries. Looking at them bandage, no doubt done by Alfred. Your left shoulder and right leg. He also changed you, into your pj's. Using your powers, you delude the pain the best you could and hurry to Damian's room. It took you a bit longer, he wasn't next door like before, all the way across the other side thanks to Dick. Finally reaching it just as Alfred comes out shutting the door to his room. He spots you looking like he was going to say something but doesn't. Instead he smiles at you with a nod. Then looks back at the door, you follow his eyes. \"I don't know how you do it, Miss Violet.\"he tells you, subtly praising you. You couldn't help but smirk at what he said.\"I wonder too.\"you said, looking around for someone he could tell. \"If you are wondering about Master Dick, he went out to have a talk with Batwoman. Miss Kane. He has instructed that Master Damian has 24 hour rest, while you have 48 hours of rest. Now, then I won't hold you up.\"he steps aside and pushes the dining cart down the hall. You stood there for a few seconds watching before you went into Damian's room. Hearing his door open, Damian slides his eyes over to the person. When he saw who it was, his frustrated scowl slowly eased up, but not all the way. \"Why aren't you resting?\"he demands from you, trying to mask his actual concern. You paid no mind to how he said it, and walk over to him. He was sitting in his bed with his head bandaged and arm, your eyes look over his injuries they didn't seem that bad. You were just glad he was alright, still that didn't stop you. You climb into his bed and sit behind him, placing your hands on his back you began to focus upon where his pain was, even if he wouldn't tell you. Locating it you start to absorb the pain from his body into your own. Your skin reacting to it, turning first a low grey color meaning, the pain wasn't that bad until it started to become darker but not to dark. Your eyes remained the same, which was good. Through the whole time Damian didn't move nor say anything. It was always like this when you did this. When trying to just single out a certain negative emotion you need full concentration and the slightest movement or distraction was never good. Damian would just wait for you to finish, it didn't take very long. Just a few more seconds and you finished. Taking your hands back, you had to now put what you took away and keep it locked up until you needed to use it. Good thing for you it was consider the norm and your body did the rest.\"There, done.\"you tell him. \"Finally.\"he groans, as he started to take off his bandages.\"So, what's going on with you Greyson?\" His questions did catch you off guard, and what you did next did to him wasn't a surprise. But made him stop, you hug him from behind tightly. Like you had some sort of nightmare, the same thing you use to do back in the mountains when you would have nightmares. Just out of reaction grab hold him in your sleep or if you awoke and grab him in order to go back to sleep. But this was different, he could tell by way you held onto him. It was clear his question hit something in you, that you just would not talk about. And being the type of person he was, just directly asked you. Having noticed the interaction and strain between you and Dick. Even if he wasn't much a fan of him, he was still someone important to you and you to him. From the first day he came to live with his father he noticed and saw the strong bond between you both. Even after you left to live with his mother, how distraught he was. How empty he looked, like a part of him was missing. And when you came back to help them, Dick was overjoyed but no doubt became sadden when you left him again. And no doubt the guilt of leaving him haunted you. Even if you wouldn't say it, which was why you kept your distance from him. And even now you didn't say anything about it. Your head resting up on Damian's back, you inhale deeply and let go. Damian looks at you. While you stood there in silence.\"You're going to leave aren't you?\"you question. Turning back around looking at him. He gets off his bed and walks towards his clothes pulling out his Robin attire and gets dressed. Giving you the answer, you sigh but understood.\"Give me a second.\"you tell him and leave his room. It took you some time to get to your room and to get dressed. Once you had your outfit on you hurry back to Damian's room to find it empty. Grumbling upset at his refusal to wait for you, you hurry down the Batcave where he no doubt would be. Carefully you make your way there, avoid any sort of detection from Alfred. Quickly you hurry down to underground base, calling for Damian upset that he didn't wait for you. While mumbling to yourself he was going to get it later. Reaching the last step,\"Damian! Damian!\"you call for him. Excepting a response, you didn't expect...\"Violet MOVE!\"Damian warns you. No second had he warned you were kicked square across the face, by something fast and heavy. It came out of nowhere, with a force that felt like sledge hammer, sending you flying across the room. Crashing into the Batcomputer, it was enough for you spit up. Your body drops down, but you managed to catch yourself just barely. That surprised attack took a bit out of you. Your body was aching again from the pain and you started to stagger as you stood up. Your vision was a bit impaired, slowly you start to push yourself back up. Looking in the direction you heard Damian fighting against the intruder. Barely able to focus, but you saw who it was. That man from Wayne Tech, who saved Damian. What was he doing here? How did he know where her was? So many questions came to your mind, but they would have to wait. Right now you had to help Damian, focusing on your pain. You suppress it to become numb, and go to help him. The man saw you coming and before you could even jump or land a blow. He turns around quickly to you, grabs you by the throat and flings you hard across the other side of the room. But that didn't stop you, you pick yourself back up. Without feeling any sort of pain you could keep going but it would cost you later. Seeing this the man gets ready to attack you again, before it could happen Damian goes to attack the guy. Due to being drugged prior to, his strikes and movements where slow. But it didn't matter, he tires to strike the man who steps aside letting Damian fall to his knees and began to slowly crawl till the drug took its affects on him. He stood over him triumph, reaching to pick him up when you became enraged and raced at the man like a hellbat. And again it happened, the fear took over but you didn't care and charged. Hearing your yells he turns around in your direction the second you jump up, you changed again like before. Your skin becoming that reddish color, eyes becoming black with yellow iris that this time slit, your teeth started to becoming sharper and this burning feeling over your eyes started to happened, like something was extra was forming. Your fingernails became sharper almost like claws, your appearance almost looked demonic in a sense. A roar escapes you, a ferious roar as you go to strike the man. But he steps aside, and you missed him. But with this power your physical attributes increased, your speed was much faster and you go turn back around to strike. But he managed to dodge, it didn't matter you kept up the attacks and strikes left and right pushing him. He just blocked you, not at all afraid of you. Which only added more, throwing a punch followed by a kick. He grabs your ankle and pulls you forward palm thrusting you hard in the chest. His strike was enough to snap you of it and knock you out. With you out, he stands over you with a thought in mind about what he was going to do to you but changed his mind. Leaving you he turns around and takes Damian. Your mind was a drift, the pain you still had suppressed kept you from moving. It leaked a bit from your hold, leaving you in this state. Unable to move until you could grab hold of it again. While at the same time you cursed yourself from giving in, but the fear of Damian being attacked. That man there...fear just over took you and you had fight back. But at what cost? Losing control of yourself? Everything you worked for just seem to shattered and no doubt a certain someone would be upset after they just had this conversation with you. If only they could tell you why? What it was they kept hidden from you? Why giving in was such a threat and taboo? The power was just so nice to have, you didn't have to fear anything anymore. Except to lose yourself... \"Violet. Violet!\"a familiar voice calls to you. Searching around for the voice, you look towards the light you saw shinning in your mind. That was were the voice was coming from, you reach for it and take hold. Your eyes shoot open and you gasp deeply for air. Your body would go in this stasis whenever that happened. Slowly sit up with the help of another. Rubbing your head trying to recall what just happened. When it clicked, Damian! Where was Damian? Looking around frantic for him, there was no sign of him at all. All you saw was the knocked over Batbike, trickles of Damian's blood where his body had been and nothing else. \"Damian!\"you get up to race over, only to stagger just a bit. You almost collapsed but someone grabs you and keeps you steady. Looking you find Batwoman much to your surprise, she looks at you understanding and sympathetic eyes. She saw the guilt and failure you felt for not being able to do anything. Feeling helpless, becoming angry because you couldn't do anything. She gets down to your level and embraces you in a comforting hug tightly. \"Violet, are you okay?\"Dick comes over dressed as Batman. Your eyes follow his voice, you look right at him then away. Refusing his comfort, getting out of Batwoman's grasp and straighten yourself. There was no time to have self pity right now, Damian was taken and you needed to find him and Bruce. Regaining yourself and focusing back on the mission at hand. It was a 360 that shocked Dick and worried him too.\"What is the next move?\"you ask.\"Where are we going?\" Dick holds up his hand in objection.\"Hold on Violet, you can't come. Look I know you want to get Damian back but you're in no condition to do so.\"he sternly tells you. Though you brush it off.\"I understand, but I have to help out.\"you tell him.\"My injuries are nothing. I know how to suppress them or just rid them from myself.\" \"That's good and all, still though you need to stay here. I can't risk you getting inju-\" Having enough you snap back.\"Just stop it! Stop already alright, I'm coming! I'm just as part of this as anyone else, so STOP treating me otherwise!\" The tone you took with Dick was not something he expected, this was a whole different side of you he'd never seen before. Baffled by this he didn't know what to say, seeing the hurt you caused you silently regretted how you just said what you said. You didn't mean for yourself to get like that or to snap at him. Batwoman and Alfred look at the two of you. She was about to interject but Alfred stops her.\"...\"Dick face turned cold at you, just like the words that came out his mouth.\"Fine. Get ready.\"he tells you turning around and runs to the Batmoblie jumping in, he calls to Batwoman to join him.\"Hopefully you have a ride.\" Again with the harsh and cold words, even though it stung you let it be. The sound of the engine starting up caught your attention. Dick presses on the gas pedal and leaves the cave and you. Knowing he did that on purpose didn't bother you much, you had your own transportation. Holding out your hand your eyes in a flash glow black and you race down the direction Dick drove off. Alfred watches you wondering what it was you had in mind and what you were doing. He was sure that you wouldn't couldn't run all the way there. \"Miss Violet don't!\"he panics, watching you jump off the side of the driveway. He races to the side looking for you, when something huge and large comes up with such speed that it almost knocked him back. He stares up wide eyes amazed and surprised at what he saw you riding on. Gasping. A loud screech erupts throughout the cave, with you on top of the winged creature you direct to follow in the direction Dick drove off in. Doing as you command the creature dives down and tucks in its wings through the tunnel of the driveway, exiting the cave with force. Spreading its wings letting the wind push it upward, it lets out one last screech into the cold night.[Chapter 15] The night skies remain clear and clean with a just a few cirrostratus clouds scattered in the skies, the air crisp and cool. Nothing out of place, over the Monastery for the Nuns of Perpetual Grace, from the outside and unseen eyes many would believe this place to be just that. Nothing more. But to the focused and trained eyes, they knew there was more hidden behind their false practice of religion. Beneath its benevolence, hide their actual ways. And beneath that, those needed resuced where kept. Dick and Batwoman aka Katie Kane took the Batmoblie, leaving you to get your own ride. As Dick put it. Assuming that you didn't have a ride to acquire, but he was dead wrong. Your had one that was better, badder not to mention deadlier if you allowed it to be. Upon the giant monstrous winged creature's back, gripping their thick dark brown feathers to keep hold from the strong air pressure you felt from the speed it flew through the skies and gust from its wings produced. You didn't need a ride, so your cousin's words about that didn't bother you. Though what did was how he felt, it was branded in you for some reason, and you couldn't seem to shake it. While you remained focused, feeding your ride who was your conduit for what you stored. The more you stored and released the stronger and ferocious it became. Having practiced many times with this, you pretty much knew how much to give that still left you with some for yourself, apparent by your physical change characteristic, dark grey skin and black pupil-less eyes with dark markings/ symbols etched on your body. Because you wanted to get there faster, you poured more in causing a bit more change in your physical form, elongated nails and your skin became a bit darker. Your eyes looking straight ahead, seeing a different trail than others, you never really needed a tracker like the others. No. You had your way of tracking people or others, everyone had a their emotional signature, and your eyes allowed to see such. Like fingerprints, each different and unique. Their negative emotion, which ever was the strongest in them, and you sense it like a hound dog. Seeing the trail that lead you to your target. And you found them. Damian. Bruce. Adding a bit more, your ride screeches in the night sky. Piercing its silence, increases its speed. You hold on tighter as you stand up, remaining squat position. Ready to spring to contribute to the fight with the others. No more side lines. No more watching. You where part of this family just as the others. No matter how Dick felt...a feeling you still couldn't shake. With your eyes focused and mind on the mission, your heart was still on Dick. Your cousin, how he felt made a tight knot form in your stomach. Ever since you came back, you felt the knot forming, and it became tighter. After your outburst to him. Asserting yourself to him, the shock and hurt look in eyes. Made you regret your actions, but the way he responded caused you become upset at him, instead of remorseful. Which you where right now. You didn't mean for it get like that, but what words could you saw. You already felt a certain way already, how would he understand. Hearing the sounds of gun fire and blades crashing, explosions brought your focus back. Look straight ahead seeing smoke and flickers of lights no doubt from the firing in the walls of the Monastery. Yep. This was the place, ironic really, your about to help attack a holy place, bringing violence to it. When you where taught not to. You asks for the Ganden Tripa forgiveness, now with that out the way. You jump off your ride to join the fry. \"No fear. Don't give in\" Down with the others, Dick, Batwoman and a new addition Batwing, dressed and geared in a high tech batsuit. Held their own against the army of corrupted nunjas and hired help Firefly and Killer Moth. They kept the heroes on their toes, but Dick needed to get to the door and with the nunjas firing MK's at them from the roofs while others wield katanas, it delayed their progression. Batwing decided to take to the skies to advert Firefire and Killer Moth. One of the nunjas takes aim from the roof at Dick, she gets ready to pull the trigger...something came and struck her square in the face with force knocking her back and out. Those on the roof saw their sister's fate, they advert their attention to rushing figure and begin to fire. But the figure managed to duck and avoid the flying bullets and with their height on their side, it made rather easy for them and harder for the nunjas. Gripping their Tonfas, they charge it up and fling it at first nun in their line of sight, hitting them knocking them back and out. Retrieving their weapon, their feet move quickly out of the way of the bullets, halting their progression. Looking quickly for another way, because being hit by a bullet was not something they wanted. One of the nunjas manage to take fire at where they anticipated the area the attacker was going to go. Firing almost hitting their foot, the figure manages to avoid it narrowly. Flipping back, they could feel their heart racing rapidly. They could feel the fear starting to take hold, calming themselves, push it back down. They couldn't give in, as was told. Despite the urging too. Gripping their two tonfas they forsake their fear and rush the woman. This time unleashing their skills, with their powers and mixed in with their hand to hand combat gave them an edge, just had to remain focus and release when contact was made. Down below with Dick as Batman and Batwoman, they beat back a few more nuns when the woman noticed the figure on the roof. \"Hey. Isn't that your cousin?\"she notices, getting Dick's attention. He turns around after punching back one of the nuns, shocked to see that it was his cousin on the roof kicking back one of the nunjas ruthlessly and effortless it seem. Taken back by this, he knew she had training when she left to live with Talia and in the Monastery. He had seen her fight once when she came back during the Court of Owls, putting up a good fight against Talon. But, nothing like this. He stood there looking in awe and pride...pride. Yeah, pride. The sight before his eyes opened them, though proud he felt something else. The realization of this feeling was something he feared and dread. Watching his cousin and her little meek self strike down woman twice her size, it shouldn't be something new having seen Damian the pint size do it, the difference he was trained since day one. His skills groomed well. His cousin wasn't nothing like that, that he knew of. Not the cousin he knew, not the Violet he rescued those years back. This couldn't be the same one who seem to embrace her powers she was frighten and weary of. Now seem to have better control over them. The girl who would never harm a living soul in his eyes, now didn't think twice on landing a punch or kick. Knocking down everything in front of their line of sight, doing dangerous and life harming stunts and movements, with some what ease. Though of course many couldn't tell, but he could having had years of doing it. Her skills needed to be polished, still though it was good. But that wasn't what made feel...inferior...no. It was what she did next that did, that made him realize she didn't need him anymore. A few of the nuns manage to knock Violet back, which Dick was about to react seeing her body flung across the roof and hitting the large metal cross. About to rush to her aid, when she got up and raises her hand as if summoning something. Summon she did, a piercing ear hurting screech filled the skies. Making a everyone stop for a second to see what it was that cast such a large ominous shadow rose up from behind the little girl. Was this the extent of her powers? Dick thought as his eyes stare wide with both shock and horror. The creature was monstrous looking that was for sure, something straight out of myth or folklore at the command of his cousin. Who appearance changed, her skin was wavering between both black and red, he notice something demonic looking about her, the wicked grin she had. Her eyes remained black and pupil-less with a hint of yellow forming into a pupil. \"Whoa!\"Batwoman looks on impressed.\"...\" \"...Violet...\"Dick looks on now more concerned.\"...What's happened?\" Batwoman looked closer at the winged monstrous bird.\"Is that...the little bird?\" \"Richie?!\"Dick looks to the creature, quickly studying it's features and realizes it was the little bird. The little robin, Violet's pet. No longer little but a force to be recon with. The nuns before you look at the creature fearfully, from pure shock. But quickly throw it away and aim their guns at it taking fire. The bullets had little effect, and with wave of your hand, you sic him upon them. He lets out another screech before attacking them. Zipping passed you his beak open, attacks. Leaving devastation behind it. You though run after him as the building began to fall apart and jump on the back of him, grip the feathers you command without words to continue his attack. Batwing saw the killer creature was shocked. And when he saw who was riding it, a little girl who looked vaguely familiar. He looks to Dick and by the way he was looking at the girl. Batwing was able to piece together who it was riding that thing and commanding it.\"Whoa...Violet!?\" You rode Richie like it was nothing, feeding him as he laid waste to the compound and those who attacked. Grabbing them with his talons and flinging them or crushing them. Even using his beak to get a few in his mouth, injuring them just enough to stop their movement. All this with little regard, in fact you weren't in the driver's seat. It was like something else was, or some one. Your features started to change more, the markings on your body became more prominent and darker, your skin became a mixture of red and black fused. Your nails became a bit longer, your eyes, one was black and pupil-less the other one black with yellow pupil. Your grip on Richie's feathers began to tremble. Inside your mind, you where struggling for dominance, trying to regain some sense of control. You let it take over again. Assuming you stopped it, but didn't. It just manifested into something different. That you took hold of, and that was it. You scream and fight back at what took hold of you, but your efforts where nothing. It paid no mind to you, only to hit you back. Calling your weak and feeble, saying you didn't know the power you held. It was that same dark, powerful and evil voice. Their words soon took hold of you. Their power was overwhelming, they demand you to yield to them as you should. Feeling crushed beneath their power, was more than you could take. Which they took pleasure in, calling you a obedient child. Next thing, you felt something grip around your throat tightly, dangling you up. Their grip began to crush throat, you couldn't breath. Your fear spiked. You try to pry their hand off but it only became tighter. Seeing you starting to give up,\"Don't touch her!\"a voice booms, a blast came out of nowhere harming and pushing whatever that evil presence was away and out of your mind. It was your protector, they land down in front of you protectively. Their defense up, waiting to see if the other presence was going to come back. Sensing nothing, they let their guard down and turn to you.\"...\" Without a word, they leave. Opening your eyes, half, your mind trying make sense if it was a dream or not. From the throbbing headache, it sure didn't seem like one. Still feeling the bits and pieces of whatever presence was in your mind still there. Yeah, it wasn't a dream. It was real. Pinching your brow, recalling everything before things went out. The last thing you recalled, was being kicked back by the nuns and next thing...Richie came after that a total lost. No recalculation after that. But from this headache, it was telling you something. Your mind felt like it was on fire, and it still hadn't been put out. Rubbing your temples to ease the pain, it didn't help. Moving your hand around to feel, it brushes up against something cold and almost knocks it over. You react catching the glass of water, though manage to spill a few drops. A glass of water? Next to it, two white circular tablets no doubt medicine for your headache courtesy of Alfred no doubt. It had his name written all over it, though the only problem...this wasn't your room. Well not your room back at the Manor, but a different room for you somewhere else. It was the extra room Dick had for you back at his place, in his pad. He set it up whenever you spent the night. The times he would spend days or the weekends with you. Taking you from the Manor to enjoy quality family time. It wasn't as big as your room back at the manor, but still a good size. You had a nice size queen bed, yes he had a queen bed for you. The room was decorated and filled up with the normal things, dresser, closet, book shelves, etc...on the side of your bed where the glass of water was placed a little table. Next to it, just a few inches away a picture of you and Dick. Taken about a year after you had been saved. It was at Haley Circus, the place your family was from. Taken by one of the members. The two of you stood under the sign, you remember. Dick had you in a tight, loving hug with a proud smile on, while you stood there clung next to him with the same smile and embrace. This was one of your favorite memories and pictures. Dick had it framed and kept it in room, he also had the same picture in his room, right next to his bed. It always made his day. He would tell you. There so much emotions that came from that one picture. It beamed and radiated endless love. Something you had never experienced during your dark years. Or torment. Hell. Loneliness. Detachment. Your world then was cold, damp, lifeless and cruel. Something you considered normal, a twisted way of normal. All to be changed by the arrival of Dick. The day he came to save you, he and Batman had been following a lead about the people you where forced to do their dirty work for. When they found you, when Dick found it shocked them to know it was a kid, a little girl doing all of it. A small fragile little girl. Who's eyes told the two men the horrible experience you had to live through. Not understanding right and or wrong. A lost. Confused, child who's innocents seem twist. Yet, a smile of relief came to her face. Her eyes looked onto them as saviors a role Dick took very serious. He came in and picked you up, while singing the song you had heard before. You are my Sunshine. A song you found out from Dick, had been a song sung to you, by the family. He told you, you where everyone's sunshine and no one wanted you to be taken away. It was right then a connection was formed. You remember the tears that came out from behind his mask, you've seen grown men cry before you, pleading for you to reconsider. But, never the way Dick cried. Those tears where something new to you. Tears you like and made you curios. The way he scooped you up in his strong arms, holding onto you like treasure. Never letting go, even on the way back to Gotham. Even when you slept, to find him sleeping off your bed holding your hand. He never let go, and held onto you through your transitions and ordeal. His hold seem to become tighter and tighter with each step. Always behind you as your protector. Taking extra measures to ensure everything was good for you. You knew he was just so happy to have found his only relative, having been the only Grayson for so long. You where very precious to him. Something you grew to realize. Which started to become suffocating. Or so you thought, once you began to make your own choices in life since upon meeting Damian. Never realizing how much was hurting your cousin. To him you where delicate and fragile, someone in need of protection. Which you thought, until your world began to start with Damian. Upon being revived from death, and taken away from Dick. It gave you a sense of reflection, with the relationship between you and your cousin. The very first day you awoke with Taila, you wanted your cousin. To realize he wasn't anywhere close. Though you got word he was doing fine and understood why you had to be taken away. You knew he was hurting. But there was nothing you could do, you had to learn how to walk on your own. And with each step, you became your own. Realizing there where things you couldn't rely on Dick for. When you came back, you expected praises from Dick. But he seem to revert back to himself. Even after you helped with the fight against Talon. He tired to get you to stay, comforting you when you found Damian left and wanted you to stay back. Which Dick couldn't be happier about, but not you. You loved cousin but, you wanted your own choices for once and still had more to do. You followed Damian. Not thinking twice on how much it bothered and hurt him. You trained to find your center and with your powers. Which seem to grow, faster than you could grasp. You didn't really know what to do. The one thing that came to your mind, was Dick. For some reason you wanted him there. But, when you realized what put him through. You became scared, afraid to face him. A fear you had to get over, as you and Damian came back to help find Batman. You tired to act like you had everything together. So Dick would not see it. But with each lie, your fear only grew, and because of how your powers where starting to act, added more fear. Fear that turned into anger that you lashed out at Dick, who you now realized was just happy to have you back. You didn't want him to see you still needed him. You where confused about what was happening to you. Afraid. Was this the block that held you back from continuing with your chakras? Your eyes still look at the picture a few more seconds, reflecting upon everything. Trying to figure out what conclusion you should come to. Throwing your covers back, something falls off, that you noticed. Looking down to find on the floor a piece of folded paper. Sliding off the bed, you feet planted on the floor you pick up the paper that had your name on it. In Dick's hand writing. It had to be important otherwise he wouldn't leave you a note, unfolding it, you start to read. Eyes trailing over each word, and formulating your own understanding of each sentence. Coming down the last sentence, made you come up with your conclusion. This here made it easier. Placing the note down, you make your way to Dick's room. Entering it. He never mind. Spotting his Laptop, you go over to it hacking into his account. He taught a few things, you bring up Word and began to type. You flew through the night on Richie, you weren't consumed by your powers. No. Your skin was just gray so nothing to fear. Just a calm, relaxing ride. You can't believe you where doing this. You just hope it was the right thing to do, and hope Damian would understand and your cousin. You felt bad for leaving like this, without a word to any of them. But, Dick seem to understand, even when you thought he didn't. You smile fondly at the thought. Richie screeches to tell you, your destination was coming up. Peering from behind him, you look and see it. Standing tall in all its glory. Something inside you, told you this was where you needed to be. It felt right, and there was something else...you couldn't put your finger on it. It didn't matter at this point. Patting Richie he descends down to land, he lands shaking the ground just a bit from his weight. Looking around you don't see anyone, you wondered if they received your message. This was the right location. Right? The building itself pretty much told you it was, but there seem to be no one around. Throwing your two bags down, and slide off Richie's wing, down the appearance returning back to normal. Standing there, in casual attire. A off white tunic top with long bell sleeves, with maroon patterns on them, deep blue leggings and leather moccasins laced boots. \"H-Hello.\"you call nervous. There was nothing, so you call again only to hear a voice. \"Well hello, to you too.\"a friendly voice response. You look around not seeing anything or anyone. But you heard a laughter. \"Who's there?\"you demand slightly. Still looking around, you hear snickering this time followed by a buzzing around your ear. And the same voice. \"Heaven must have answered my call,\"they say.\"Because they sent me an angel.\"Next thing that buzzing sound stopped and before you something transformed, something small green transformed into a green teen boy a year older than you, and taller than you. Dressed in red and white body suit. With messy green hair and small canines. He was rather close, a bit to close. Smiling at you with a wink and laugh. \"...Hello? Hi...\"you speak.\"I'm Violet Grayson, and you are?\" Before the boy could say anything.\"Annoying.\"A deadpan,sarcastic voice quips.\"Leave her alone.\"Next thing black energy with a purple outline forms between you and the boy pushing him back. You look at the person who did it, a teenage girl at least 14 dressed in a deep blue leotard with gray tights, deep blue boots, arm warmers, and a hood cloak that covered her face a bit, but you could see her violet-blue eyes along with her grey pigmentation. Her face was stoic and emotionless it seem. The opposite of the boy she pushed away from you. For some reason she seem familiar, you just couldn't pin it. Her eyes stare right back at you. The two of you stayed like that until someone else came. A kind voice broke the lock hold between you and the girl.\"Violet! You made it.\"you turn to the voice to see flying over to you, a young woman, an orange skin very attractive and curvaceous woman with full on green eyes. Dressed in purple short of short dress that exposed the top of her breast and sides, with matching boots and gauntlets it seem, red flowing hair with a kind and warm face, with another person in black and blue armor looking like a beetle. They both land next to you, the boy in the beetle costume looks at Richie and whistles at his massive size, causing Richie to look at him. The woman embraces you, delighted to see you.\"I'm so happy you decided to join. Sorry for the long wait, we where training. My you've grown.\"she compliments you. Looking you over.\"And those eyes of yours. As lovely as ever. Hmmm...\"she looks closer.\"Almost your same color Raven.\"she turns to the brooding girl. Then back to you.\"Don't be nervous, you'll fit in well here.\"She assures you, calming your nerves.\"I know for a fact Dick is very proud of you doing this.\" The others watch you and woman interact.\"So who is the new girl?\"The one dressed in blue and black asks, while petting Richie. Who didn't seem to mind. \"Mine.\"The one in green elbows his friend who just groans annoyed. By his comment. \"Seriously?\"he rolls his eyes. The girl blocked out them both, and kept her eyes on you.\"...Good, she finally came.\" Back with you and woman,\"Well, why don't we do some introductions.\"She turns to the other teens.\"Everyone this is Violet Grayson, she's going to be our newest member. Violet meet Garfield or Gar aka Beastboy, Raven and Jamie Reyes aka Blue Beetle.\"You wave to them.\"Now, why don't we get you settled inside.\"She tells you picking up your bags, stopping when she remembered Richie.\"What about your friend?\" Looking to him, you hold out your hand and reabsorb everything back into you and he transforms back into his normal small self, flying over to you perching on your shoulder. The guys look on shocked at what they just saw.\"...\"They just point. You turn around to the woman.\"Okay, I'm ready.\" She was a bit taken back by what you just did but shakes it off with a smile.\"Alright then. Let's go.\"She starts to lead you towards the tower.\"Welcome to the Teen Titans.\" And that is the end of this, now to start the Justice League vs Teen Titans. :) Thank you to all who have been reading the story.[Chapter 16] Okay this is just an intro chapter pretty much with the story, sorry for the lack of dialogue. It was clear and warm skies, with a gentle breeze. A good day to go outside or to the beach, even for a stroll. A good day indeed, that you spent inside, in your room. In Titan's Tower. Home of the Teen Titans, a group of heroes in a manner of speaking more like a place for those who needed a place to belong. Who had strange and unique powers and abilities. A place someone could call home. A place that has become your most current residence for the past few months. It was nice, living here. Moving in was rather easy, Starfire the leader and alien princess with orange skin and green eyes was rather thrilled to have you join. Even though you saw it differently, it was nice place. She helped you settle in, giving you a room out of the many. It was plain, something you didn't mind, meaning you could make it into your own. Compared your previous rooms you've lived in. This one was rather simple yet spacious, you loved the large window it came with it. Allowing you to look over the coast, seeing the sun rise and set. The decor of your room was a bed, desk, the basic necessities really until you added your own touch. You had a bookshelf filled with books, a laptop on your desk a gift from Dick, and the rest of your room was rather tranquil and peaceful. Your walls where painted in a cool blue-green with warm subtle red-orange mehndi designs. With hints of gold color shown in the right light. A large rounded straw rug right in the center, khadi tufted floor cushions, to sit or lounge. Most times in the tower you would come to your room to just be at peace and mediate something you kept up after leaving the Monastery, having on soothing and rhythmic music to block out everything or you wouldn't play it. You would stand and stare out your window in deep thought. Your mind no doubt plagued by something. Mostly it was from the strange dreams. Dreams you couldn't really understand, you knew the surrounding in the dreams. A room in darkness, filled with misery and despair. A place you were force to grow up in, chained like a animal. The cold metal shackle around your throat, attached to the semi medium length chain that contacted to the wall. Only allowing you certain freedom to explore. A horrible place. That still made you shutter, even on warm nights. That place was the worst part of your life, what you where made to do, what you saw. The fact..the fact during those years...you never had name. Never had a place to belong. Your \"family\" didn't bother to give you one, you felt so lost. Disconnected. Alone. Hurt. Unimportant. All you had for comfort, the darkness and shadows. Which you greatly believed would be your salvation. Having such feelings, still seem to haunt you to this day. But that wasn't jest of it, no. There was something else with the dreams, some sound of chanting it seem and this burning feeling. Along with baby cries. Flames all around. Along with evil eyes looking and a dark manically. A laugh that scared you, awake in a cold sweat. You couldn't really go back to sleep after that at times, so you would just mediate or stare out the window to fall asleep if lucky. A few times you left your room to just take a walk around, it did you some good to get fresh air. Those dreams always left you feeling lost and uncertain. Not to mention frighten. Confused. One thing was sure, with living here, you've noticed that evil presence hadn't been around compared to when you lived back in the Himalayas. It almost felt like someone or something was protecting you. Which was good, it allowed you to have better control in a sense over your powers. Though without unlocking the rest of your chakra it was still a bit of a struggle. But you managed. Still absorbed negative emotions, which transformed your physical appearance. You never went beyond your skin turning a dark gray. Making sure you didn't feed into plunging more into your powers. Meaning you still had sense and control. Since Richie was your conduit to release any extra on or just to transfer he would join you. You came realize the amount you feed to him, he would grown. Since the two of you pretty much where already contacted, it was easy to do on a whim. But from what Starfire told you, you had figure out how use your powers without Richie. What if he isn't around and you had transfer your powers elsewhere. Since you didn't really like to use people, unless needed. And keeping it inside could only work for so long before it took you over. No matter how much you stored. If you became overloaded, you would just release it in one huge burst that wouldn't be good for those around. So you tired to think of many other ways, but none really came to mind. Struggling, always seem to be a strain for you. You had to figure out the answer yourself. Dick wasn't around, nor was Damian. Whom you could at least talk with or knew when something was bothering you. You still felt guilty having left, left him. You often wondered about how he took it. What his attitude might have been. Through mediation you managed to feel a just a bit of his emotions, sensing his anger and confusion. Which pained you, you tired to send an email or message but couldn't get pass the first part. Dear Damian... What could you actually say really? Did you even have the courage to explain it all? What would his response be? Damian wasn't really the type who things very well, even if he seemed like it. It was his...bratty side. He liked order and no confusion a trait no doubt inherited from his father, but to a greater extent. From all the two of you had been together, you would tell him pretty much everything. And he would with you, when he felt like it. Neither really hid anything, but your unexpected move no doubt surprised him. With no explanation really. Did he go to Dick to wonder why? Your cousin was really the only one who pretty much knew why you went, a suggestion you where grateful for. Still didn't ease the guilt you felt about leaving Damian. Though it lingered on your mind, you had to look forward. Ahead now. This place was to help you or so you hoped. Everyone here was rather...interesting. Starfire was very kind to everyone, like a mother/ big sister in a sense. Patient, a trait you notice and became fond of, also encouraging but would point out things one should work on, to help not to discourage. A pretty good mentor and teacher. She had everyone train everyday to develop and polish their skills and get better control. You could see why Dick fancied her, a few times you remember catching him talking with her either through phone call or video chat. Which he became embarrassed by, especially when you asked simple innocent questions. Whether he would marry her or if he loved her. Things a noisy sister would want to know, but you just wanted to know. Never seeing any harm about it. Maybe once she came over to Dick's place when you where there, she was nice back then too. You felt rather comfortable around her, even when you seem nervous and reclusive. Which she understood and gave you all the time you needed. Because she did, it made easing into this new life better. The others on the team where fine. Blue Beetle aka Jaime Reyes, a teenage with some sort of alien tech that bonded to his whole body. A small blue little scarab, it was seem to be a separate entity. It seem pretty hostile or as Jaime put it crazy at times. What he could do with the scarab was in many words pretty cool. He explained to you, that it allowed him to suit up in the armor you first met him in. Which increased his physical stamina, strength, durability and so forth. Also giving him a wide range of endless weapons and arsenal. You saw a few, blades, canon gun, pincers, a sonic gun. Whenever you saw them, it was just amazing. He seem rather in-sync with his...little friend. A few times when you had to spare against him just for practice you had to stay on your toes, because you never really knew what would be coming out of his bag of tricks. And since it was practice he never went far to hurt anyone. Having to restrain his little friend from doing so. Besides that he was rather friendly and relaxing person. Welcoming you and tried to give you a quick run down. He found you quite impressive with your skills, for someone of your stature and you powers cool. He seem to like Richie, who shared the same affection. Because of Jaime's personality, the two of you hit it off rather well. He often gave you space or would include you. Telling you relax and be less tense. Jaime was the exact opposite of Garfield or Beastboy, the joker or funny guy on the team. A green skin 14 year old, every part of him was green. His appearance was apparent, but he didn't seem to let it bother him. His powers, able to transform into any animal. He and Jaime had a very close friendship, both of them buddies. Garfield managed to keep light note with pretty much anything. He like Jaime with his skills and powers was a bit unpredictable consider how he could change into anything at whim. You didn't mind him, he was okay. Just wished he would try not to be so up in your face or being very friendly. He had a habit of turning into cute animals in hopes of getting your attention. Once he almost fooled you, turning into Richie who and you almost took him with you into your room. Because you didn't seem to pay attention, luckily though someone pointed him out, Raven. And of course he got in trouble, Jaime told him to ease up on you and leave you alone. He felt Gar a nickname he didn't mind going by, was going to scare you off. A few times Gar would catch you talking with your cousin or over hear you talking yourself about Damian. A few times he asked who he was, but you didn't tell him. Unsure really how describe Damian to Gar. Gar did become a bit suspicious questioning if Damian was a boyfriend or something. Pressuring to answer, which wasn't good and caused you to unleash a burst of your powers, never on purpose. Even when he would just pop out of no where and scare you, you unleash it. Starfire told Gar he needed to stop scaring you. You already damaged windows and furniture. At times Gar could give you a headache, but besides that he was a really great guy. He made you laugh, which was good. He got you to do things you never thought of doing. Introducing to you DDR, which you didn't understand at first but became better. A few times you and would join him and Jaime. When Gar found out you where a whiz in the kitchen mainly with baking, he beg you to make something and a few times asks you teach him. Which would end up with an explosion as he wouldn't take it serious. Besides that, Gar was fun to hangout with. You became comfortable with him around, and enjoyed playing games. He along with Starfire was very encouraging. And had a habit of hugging you any chance he got. To which Jaime would have to tell him \"Down dog.\" Gar was pretty straightforward with things, and had a strange habit of trying to track you down. And find anyway to hangout, even when you wanted you alone time. Doing yoga or meditation around him was rather hard, but he did bring something new to your life. The one of the team, Raven. A sort of mysterious girl, who kept her distant and to herself. Rather mystical for one thing, seeing her use her powers. She always remained calm and collected, remind you of a certain someone. She was rather sarcastic, when needed of course. For some reason you always felt her eyes on you, your room was rather close to her's. An arrangement Starfire thought to be a good idea. She was alright with you, and would at times give you pointers with your powers. For some reason you got a feeling she seem overly concerned about them. Telling you to relax and focus. To keep your center. She even offered to mediate with you, all while still remaining rather cryptic. You assumed this was her way of extending a hand of friendship of some sort. Whatever the reason, you seem drawn to it. To her. It felt right and okay. It seem like she was trying to tell you something while wanting to keep it a secret. There seem also, if not mistaken some sense of worry and sorrow in her eyes whenever your gazes met. Another thing, for some reason with your powers they seem to work a bit better with Raven around, not to mention you could sense things explainable even to yourself about her, not to mention her negative emotions seem to feed into you. They where rather strong, that you would become overwhelmed faster than you thought. She also seem to be aware of your sleepless nights. Bringing them up whenever she caught you alone. This surprised you, though you where reluctant to tell her. And she seem to be able to sense it. Just telling you to not give in. Eventually you did take her up on meditating together. She would take you to a secluded place so the two of you could focus. Telling you the simple things, to clear your mind and just relax. Focus on your center. Which you did. Meditation with her felt different than with those at the Monastery. With Raven, it just felt...different. You felt you felt yourself becoming closer. As if in-sync in a sense. A feeling of bliss, until your dreams became present. That you would break it. Scared to go back, Raven remained patient with you, telling you to not let fear over take you. To just stay calm. But, because of your little drawback, it was hard. You tired many times to get over that hump, but nothing seem to work. All and everything from your past and past actions piled up. Fueling your already fear, which began to twist into something else. And those eyes. Those eyes that looked down at you with power, scared you too. It was like a horrible daymare. Raven told you just to push passed it, and when you tired you saw some other sort of vision befell your eyes, in your mind. It was just horrible and scary. That it caused you to just explode and become for a second unstable. Luckily though Raven managed to help you control. Because of that, you never bother to push pass and limited your meditation preferring to focus on something else. To distract yourself from it. Bringing your smile back, and acting like everything was fine. Which seem to work rather well. And you would kept it that way. Living with this new team, was becoming very enjoyable and fun. Despite the dark, malevolence presence that haunted your dreams and soul. That kept you up at night. Things where pretty good. And you wouldn't want it to change. In a dark evil place, two pairs of eyes open burning with fire.\"...Find them.\"[Chapter 17] A baby's cry, where was it coming from? Who was it coming from? Why was everything so dark? This pain, this burning pain where was it coming from? Why was everything hurting? Hello? Was anyone there? Where was everyone? Who where these hooded people standing over you, what where saying? Those eyes, why where looking at you like that? The fear you could feel it rising, it was rising fast. Dick. Anyone. You began to struggle, what was restraining you back? Dick. Everyone. Damian. You call out for anyone to hear you. Why couldn't anyone hear you? Was that chanting? Who was chanting? Those figures, who where they? Why where looming over you? You demand them to stop. Not to touch you. You try to scream but nothing came out. This wasn't right, none of this was. What was happening to you? Why was this happening? Your body felt like it was on fire, the agony was to much. Just too much, you wanted cry but your tears didn't come. Your forehead started to burn, this feeling was overwhelming. Such power, it starting to consume you. The baby's cries, they became louder and louder. Why did they sound so familiar? Wait, what was that other sound? That whimpering sound. No that lullaby. Those words...it couldn't be. It just couldn't. Everything stopped, the burning stopped. Replaced with darkness, cold and mold. Such a rank place, so disgusting. So numb. So lifeless. So...dead. Not even a flicker of light, but the whimpers continued. Those sad whimpers of despair and loneliness, rotten walls? Old wallpaper falling off, the smell of vomit and body fluids such a sickening smell. Just so repulsive, it could make anyone gag. This just wasn't real!? None of it was, there was no way. To your horror, your worst fear. A place, a dark place you wish to never return to. Staring right back at you, that filled you with horror, you shut your eyes refusing to look. Turning heel you try to run, only to fall instead. You scream for life, but no one heard you, no sound came. What was this? Why was this happening? Falling into the darkness, deeper and deeper. Those eyes showed themselves those demonic eyes watched you fall. You scream for Dick. Damian. Batman. Anyone, but no one came...no one. You shoot up in a cold sweat, that dream, it felt so real. A cold shiver ran down your spine, your heart raced rapidly. Everything else was quiet and still, just what the heck was that? Touching your forehead to quickly move your hand away, the top of your forehead seem like it was burning. Maybe it was just from the sweat, yeah. Throwing your covers back you leave your bed and head to the bathroom, splashing cold water on your face over and over again. It was just a dream, you kept telling yourself. Turning off the water, you reach for a towel and dry your face. Patting your face, exhaling. \"It was just a dream.\"you tell yourself, looking at the towel unsure.\"It was just a dream.\"Lifting your head up, you noticed something out the corner of your reflection, gasping in horror nearly shirking from what you saw. Dropping the towel you rush out. The sun rose like any normal day, bringing like to everyone. And just like every morning, it was practice time. Everyone was ready to go in the training room, except one person. Starfire noticed someone was missing well two people. \"Where's Gar and Violet?\"she looks to Raven and Blue Beetle. \"I knocked on Violet's door, to let her know. And Gar, no doubt is over sleeping. Again.\" Jaime tells her, thumbing over his shoulder.\"Do you want to me to go get her?\" He starts towards the direction.\"No.\"Raven tells him. He looks at the brooding girl, who's eyes looked completely pass him down the hall. Running footsteps echoed in the hall, approaching. All eyes stare down the hall and in just a few seconds, you come almost tumbling in, while trying to fixing the last of your costume. Since joining the Titans you went through a costume change, getting rid of your older one replacing it with something you felt suited you pretty well. Though it wasn't much different, you still kept the same color, maroon. The top no longer a mandarin top instead, long flared sleeve Choli off the shoulders midriff with deep orange design embroidered in , the bottoms you wore a deep orange sash belt and leather maroon pants that disappear seamlessly into boots. You no longer wore gloves, you also didn't use your tonfas that use to reside on your you switched them out for maniacal Bo, custom made for you by Dick, since you where able to conceal it and adjust its size you kept it strapped to your side. You where proficient with the weapon, having been trained in it by Taila, Damian a bit and mostly with Dick who introduced you to it. You also added a deep orange choker. You got rid of your mask, you felt you didn't need it anymore since your appearance changed. Your had was a bit longer having been six months since you joined. It reached just a few inches passed your shoulder, and you always put it in a ponytail when it was time to practice or on missions, though you let your bangs frame your face that had slightly maturing face. Your attire also worked with your developing body, as Garfield put it: \"All the right turns.\"Even if you still maintain your meek frame. You did develop some muscles, just a bit. Starfire commented that you had inherited your cousin's attractive features. Jokingly saying, you two where related and Dick would have to start beating off the guys with a stick. Better yet his Escrima Sticks. Finally adjusting yourself and ready for training.\"Sorry, I was up late...\"you think of what to add to the rest of that. \"You where reading again, weren't you?\"Jaime said.\"Hermana, I told you to ease up on your reading.\" \"Yes. Well, you know how I am with my books.\"you laugh nervously. Looking away quickly. Raven was the only one who caught you distant glance.\"Anyway, I'm ready, sorry Starfire.\" \"That't alright, let's just get started.\"she tells you, walking to the controls. Starting up the training with solid hologram robotic fighters. She gives the go to start, you and the others spring into action. You manage to dodge the robots attack, reaching for your Bo, you get ready to use it. But decide against it, go for bare hand to hand combat. Using palm thrust to attack, unleashing your energy upon contact which strong enough to inflict damage. Which they would just disappear. Keeping your powers steady you attack a few more. Normally you would have Richie with you, but because he would grow to a massive size you had to stop with him, until you could control the amount of energy you fed him. Which was a bit difficult, as you needed something to release the stored up energy you absorbed. Starfire told you to be creative, think outside the box. And with mediation with Raven who pretty much in her own words told you the same thing, you in a sense managed to do just that. Taking control of your powers the best you could and managed to manifest them stun palm blast, or convert it into a sort of defense around you, and with enough focus you could sharpen visible energy to cut through things. Doing so though was a bit a strain, or you would transfer your energy to your Bo unleashing it each time you struck your enemy. Though for a last resort if needed you could just unleash it in one major blast. But only for a last resort. Though if you really focused as Raven has told you, you could do so much more with your powers. More than you knew, which felt like she was implying she knew more about your powers than you. Another thing was she seem to be concerned about your sleeping recently. At times you would feel her eyes upon you, watching you carefully. It felt kind of uncomfortable and ominous. A few times you felt her outside your room, to open your door and find no one there. This feeling in your gut, told you she just knew something, but would not tell you. Because she seem to start stressing with you, to come back and meditate with her. But you never really did, because of what you saw. The same thing you would see in your dream. A part of you Raven told you needed to get over, if not...was all she would say, just end it like that. Nothing else every to be said. Striking down one more, Gar came in to join. Transformed as a goat, he had overslept no doubt. Which was true, because when he transformed back into his human form he was naked. He hurries and scurries off to change, at the same time you finished your last robot and turn around to everyone else, he rams right into and falls right on you. He stares in shock just as you stare at him. Both of you in this awkward position, you right under him and him on top with no clothes. Both of you blushing heavily. Gar smiles and laughs embarrassed.\"Hehe...Opps...Sorry.\"he gets off you quickly. Apologizing again and hurries to change. Jaime comes over to you and helps you up. He couldn't help but feel a bit sorry for you, seeing the complete look of shock on your face. He snaps his fingers to bring you back.\"Hey, Violet. Yo, you in there?\"he snaps again.\"Dude, I think you broke her.\"He tells Gar, Starfire comes over to you and looks down at you. \"Violet, are you alright?\"she calls to you. \"Yep, you broke her.\" Your eyes finally move and blink. Trying to recall what just happened. You sit up pinching your brows.\"Please tell me, you have some clothes on now?\"You direct the question to Gar. \"Yep.\"he assures you.\"Sorry again.\" \"...Just remember clothes next time, please.\"you tell him. Mumbling under your breath how you might be able to sleep well for the next few days. Earning a smirk from Raven who over heard your comment. \"But, to be fair animals sleep in the naked. I'm who entire Animal Kingdom crammed on magnificent specimen.\"He gloats. Raven cast him a deadpan look.\"Well there's something crammed into something.\"she snarks. Which made the Scarab laugh.\"What did that thing just say?\"Gar demands, glaring at Jaime's back. \"It's noting, he's just laugh at you.\"Jaime assures him, letting out a few chuckles of his own. Though Gar didn't take it so lightly. He flicks the Scarab.\"Yeah, well but out bug.\" Which the retaliates and tries to attack the shapeshifter who just barely dodged it, buy turning into a fly.\"Whoa!Keep that thing on a leash man!\"Gar freaks out. Though Jaime call tells him to leave it alone.\"I told you, not to annoy it.\"You go over to it and pet it. Which it responds with a sort of cooing sound. \"Seriously?\"Gar snips while hiding behind Raven. \"Jaime's right.\"Starfire comes over.\"That Scarab is not a pet. It maybe fused with his spine, but it's not exactly under his control.\" Raven clarifies it for Gar.\"It's like you and your pants.\"Earning a scowl from him. Though a chuckle for you. \"That's why Jaime is here. That's why all of you are here.\"Starfire said.\"To help each other control your gifts. In order to become your be selves.\" Jaime though slightly disagrees with her words.\"Where else are we going to go? I mean, we're a bunch of freaks, right?\" \"Ah, come on Jaime.\"Gar makes light of it.\"We're all family.\" \"Yes, like family.\"You agree with him. They look towards you.\"We're all here for reason, like Starfire says. A place...\"you begin to trail off. Thinking back to that horrible dream. Terror filled your eyes for a second. \"Yeah, see Violet's got the idea.\"Gar slings his arm around your shoulders. Bringing you back. You look to him, with his huge grin on winking at you.\"And some more than family.\"He flashes you a smile.\"We're like the five amigos.\" \"Six.\"Starfire corrects him, everyone turns to her.\"We're getting a visitor. Someone whom I'm sure you'll be happy to see Violet.\"She looks right at you. \"Visitor?\"you look at her confused. You and the others stood outside the Titans's Tower waiting for the newest member who would be joining. You had Richie perched on your shoulder. Standing in-between Jaime and Raven, out of everyone you where the most eager to know who it was. You where the last newest member six months ago, and now someone new was coming. You wondered what their skills would be? Or if they had powers too? Or...wait a minute, you knew those dark emotions. You knew them very well, to well actually. Gasping to yourself upon realizing who it was, that was being added to the team. And knowing that car that drove towards the Tower. Stopping. There as only one person you knew that had such a vehicle like this...Batman. But instead of Batman, out came Nightwing aka Dick Grayson. Your cousin in his hero persona and with him, with a longest scowl on his face. Damian. You where just as shocked as he was when he saw you, standing there with the others. Both of you locking eyes, you felt your stomach knot causing you to cringe. Your shift away form Damian's gaze. You didn't have to look at him to know how he felt, and he wasn't holding anything back from you. His emotions hit you like sledge hammer of guilt. Anger. Upset. Hurt. Confused. Came your way, no doubt his unspoken questions he had for you. You kept your eyes looking in the other direction, unable to face him. The guilt was stopping you, you apologize to him silently. \"Violet. Hey Violet. Earth to Violet.\"Nightwing waves his hand in front of you. Trying to get your attention, which worked once he playfully pushed your head down. He got your attention. You look up to your cousin who smiles down at you with his arms wide open, waiting for a hug.\"Well?\" It took you a second to realize what he wanted, your frown turned into a smile and you embrace him.\"Hi Dick.\"you chime.\"This is really a surprise.\" You hear your cousin chuckle.\"I'm sure it was, no doubt you sensed me coming.\"he tells you, which you nod that he was right.\"You've grown since the last time I saw you.\"he steps back just a bit to get a better look. He whistles playfully.\"Look at you, aren't you turning into gem. Am I going to have to start beating back some guys? I hope you're not doing anything naughty?\" Gar just started to laugh nervously out loud, making everyone turn to him.\"Why would she do something like that? Hahaha.\" Dick looks at him puzzled.\"Okay. Anyway.\"he turns back to you.\"I've got to go. Boy wonder in there is going to need some adjusting. Why don't you go and help him.\"He kisses the top of your head, giving you a tight hug.\"Love you.\"You hug him back, and say the same thing to him.\"I love you too.\" He releases, says his good byes to the others, hopes back in the car and drives off. You race after him a bit waving bye. It was nice to see your cousin again, it always left you feeling warm. But that feeling went away, and became replaced with heavy guilt. Turning back to the Tower, you swallow hard and enter with the rest.[Chapter 18] So he was here now. Damian. Was now living in the Titans Tower, with Starfire, Raven, Jaime, Gar and you. You. It's not like you didn't want him here, it was nice he was going to be staying here. Yeah. It was going to be great. Then why didn't you feel that way? Was the guilt? The way he looked at you when he came, those green eyes behind his domino mask, masking the betray and hurt festering inside him. From what you did. The question in his eyes, demanding why, why you did what you did. You wanted to tell him, but the way he shot his eyes at you coldly and indifferent, told you to leave him alone. That looked pierced like daggers. That was just Damian, if looks could kill, his sure would. The first day with him here felt like you where walking on egg shells, like you couldn't breath at all. For a place this big you sure felt suffocated. The fact your body absorbed negative emotions, you could feels his intensely. He had to be doing this on purpose, while he was brooding about his current circumstance. So you had to do things to keep yourself and mind away from that. You distance yourself from the others, went to take a Richie for a flight, which only lasted just a few hours because Starfire called you on your com, asking you to return back to the Tower. Which you had to, when you returned you tired to find other things to do. To avoid Damian. Playing some card games with Jaime or sparing with him. You wanted to keep going, but Gar came in asking what was going to be dinner. He drags you off to make himself something. Which you didn't mind, in fact you encouraged him to tell you what more to make. Giving him all the attention he was clearly craving. And of course he basked in, but some times having more of what you want wasn't always good and you kind of over did with Gar. So you had to find something else, you managed to make your way to the library. And decided to just read, burying yourself in book after book. Time went by, but Gar managed to sniff you out and drag you again to play DDR. Which you of course accepted the invite. You did a few rounds with him, until you called it a night. Feeling you had actually accomplished avoiding him, you could sleep peacefully in manner of speaking. Entering your room, to find lounging there on your bed so casually and calm. Yet cold like steel. Damian. You could easily leave, but you knew he was aware of your presence. Stepping into your room, shutting your door doing your best to keep yourself together and greet him. Which he returned with nothing. He was still sulking and brooding. \"Damian. That's my bed.\"You said.\"I would like to go to sleep.\" No response from him, he kept his eyes closed. He was ignoring you on purpose, what a childish game. You almost forgot how infuriating he could be when he got like this. But you remained level-headed and calm. Thinking of an alternative.\"Alright, you can sleep on the bed. I don't mind, I'll just go bunk with Starfi-\" \"Six months and you still haven't developed a backbone.\"he said cruel and harsh. His words meant to cut. So much anger behind them. But you where to shock to see it, caught off guard by the tone he used towards you. Venomous. Snide.\"How is this team suppose to help me?\"He gets up off the bed, not even bothering to look at you, walking right by but stops on your side.\"When it hasn't made you any better.\" He leaves your room, nothing in his tone of voice told you that he sorry for what he just said to you. He meant everyone hurtful word. He knew how to pull at someone's emotions very well. Twisting them to his advantage, and with you, he hit it. You never felt this miserable before, tears of pain began to well up, but you do your best to hold them back. Standing in the middle of your room, your head hung low. If the first day wasn't bad enough with Damian the next day sure was. Doing your best to recover from weaponized use of words, you still had training to do with the others. Which was suppose to happen, but Damian wouldn't allow it. He hogged the training room, doing his own training routine. Fighting against hologram ninjas. You along with the rest, Jaime, Gar and Raven stood on the side watching the Boy wonder train non-stop. Normally this would amaze you, but after what he said to you last night. You found annoying. \"I've had enough of this.\"you grumble irritated. So you take the the bold move to get him stop.\"Damian! We need a turn too you know. We all need to train.\" Damian cuts down two more ninjas, before responding back.\"Why? It's not like its done you any improvement.\"Again with weaponized words.\"Now, if you'll excuse me, some of actually are utilizing their time here.\" Well that just burned and you weren't the only one who felt it. The others did too, they look towards. While you remained stun and hurt by his words, doing your best to suppress your own rising anger. \"Dude!\"Gar sneers back at Damian.\"That was sooo not cool.\" Damian stops for a second and looks at the green teen.\"...Hm...\"Coldly responds and continues to train. \"Why I-\"Gar growls. \"Just leave it alone.\"you stop him.\"...I'm leaving.\"You walk out the room to cool off, while the others watch. Once outside the room and the door closes you went a few feet away, stopping you rethink back to what Damian said. His words so spiteful they burned. How could he say something like that? Okay, you understand he's upset and sadden about being here, still though it gave him no right. Last night you took his backlash and again this morning. He was acting more inconsiderate than normal. If you just got your hands around his...No. No, you had to remain calm. They where just words, what can they really do? Besides, you know you've improved better. You made your choice to come. You had backbone. Still, the stinging still hurt. And his words did make some sense... After cooling off for some time you return back inside with the others, to find Damian in dispute with Jaime. Who looked a bit ticked off, if not for Starfire who came in to prevent it. Though it didn't help. Damian shot his rude mouth and cruel words to her. Even when asserted herself as leader of the team. \"As I state you're an alien, with nowhere else to go.\"he said to her rudely. Raven comes to back up Starfire and to comment upon what Damian said.\"Everyone needs a home, Damian. You included.\" He glares her.\"Thank you for chiming in witch girl.\" Starfire still manages to remain calm and keep the situation calm.\"We're only here to help you realize your potential.\" She tries to get him to understand. Only to have it backfire against her.\"You've been here long enough, when do think you'll realize yours?\" He snide. \"Damian. That's was uncalled for.\"you speak, he stops and looks at you. You stand firm and look back.\"What Starfire says is true and Raven. This is a home. A place we can all belong and understand ourselves.\"You said.\"There's no need to be so hostile and rude. What's wrong?\"You genuinely ask concerned. He saw the look in your eyes to tell you. \"Why are you asking me what's wrong?\"he retorts coldly.\"When clearly there's something wrong with you. Hmm, talking about a home.\"He scuffs.\"What you would actually know about one anyway? The many times you've hoped around, than again it's not like you had one to begin with in your life.\" Hurt and shocked from his words, you knew what and where he was getting at.\"Damian, don't!\" He didn't stop and kept digging the knife deeper. Taking no consideration on how his words affected you, looking pass your anger and hurtful tears.\"And you want to speak to me about bettering myself? It's obvious who needs it, because clearly you have yet to do that. Unlike you, I wasn't found in some rat hole, I'm not some lost puppy searching for a home, then again I guess you are, considering that cousin of yours. He finally named you after what eight, nine years of your life? So you have no right to try and make a claim about a home and bettering yourself, when you haven't done neither. Wonder if they know about it? It's not like you have a purpose here anyway, besides taking up space.\" It was like he cut you with his blade so fast you didn't feel the pain, only the feeling, pure shock. Then came the pain, that cut so deep the bleeding wouldn't stop. You felt so miserable and hurt. Everyone couldn't believe what he just said to you, just in disbelief. Even Raven. They didn't know what to say, or what to do. They watch your thick tears you tired so hard to hold back roll down your cheek. That feeling came over you, that cloak of nothingness. Fear. It was too much, Starfire tires to comfort and console you, but you didn't want it. Pushing her back, turning a cold shoulder to her and the others, to prevent them from seeing you cry like this. \"Vio-\"Jaime tries to call to you, but you shake your head and walk out calmly, leaving a air of pain and stillness. Your face remain like stone, all the way to your room. Once you entered and the door shut behind you, the tears began to come despite you trying to prevent them, they feel from your grey broken eyes. How could he bring up your life just like that? Use it against you so cruelly? Make you feel inferior and cutting you off. Casting you away with such anger. The part of you, of your life that was a touchy subject. Everything around you became cold. Empty. Lonely. Lost. You felt as if you where floating back into arms of the abyss as before. Into nothingness. Consumed by it. Having fallen to your knees, you began to hear that melancholy song being sung. You would sing as a child, to yourself in those dark and fearful days. No one was around, you where all alone. Isolated. Detached. Unloved. Hollow. Even with singing the words, they never meant much to you. To be lost in the darkness. To have nothing. No light. No life. No name. No, nothing. Nothing but confinement and fear. The sadness you felt began to turn into anger towards Damian. But quickly went away and back to grief. Where was Dick, when you needed him? A puppy, a lost puppy. Was that how he saw you? It was hard to tell if he was just venting his actual frustration or meant every word. They say when someone is angry they say what they really feel. You remained in the center of your room, crying your eyes out. Shutting them tightly, you felt that dark presence again, you paid it no mind. Even with the flattering horrified images you saw. The frightful cries of an infant in pain. You began to curl up to comfort yourself. Burrowing your head deep and shut yourself off into the darkness. You remained in your room for hours, not coming out. The others minus Damian and Raven came to check up on you, Starfire was mostly concerned. But you didn't respond to their attempts. You just wanted to remain in solitude, in your own comfort. You had a feeling they might asks about what Damian said. They didn't need to know, know about the kind of life you had before all this. How you really felt, now that Damian exposed it to everyone. This feeling you couldn't shake off, it haunted you and would keep haunting you. Was it guilt? Fear? Absence? You didn't know. One thing was sure, you felt shattered. Incomplete.[Chapter 19] Damian's words still haunted and bothered you, your shattered eyes stare at the picture of you and Dick. In your locket, a gift he had given you for Christmas. The picture you with Dick who had his cheek close to you, flashing a tender smile. While you had on a dolce smile. The picture was more a selfie, he had taken when the two of you went out to the park. You where still getting use to having a life and exploring. That day was really nice and warm, you where very timid back then. Dick spent the whole day with you, it was really nice, he was introducing you to pretty much everything. Letting you explore. You remember that day well, very well. One of your favorite memories. Favorite places to go. But it wasn't the reason why your eyes where grey. No. Still hearing Damian's cold words in your mind, made you think deeply. Very deeply. Back to your life before all this, that horrible place called home. That Rat Hole. The place where you darkness, cold and loneliness was all there was to life. Death. Misery. Despair. Nothing but four walls surrounded you. Dark, moldy, crusted, infected, and no doubt diseased. The floors where covered in God knows what, the cold always found solace in your room. You had thought for long there was no door, until that day...they opened it. You remember silence, nothing but silence. You weren't sure if back then you where deaf or not. Maybe from all the screaming from your countless victims, or your mind just decided to block out the sound so you would not hear it. Push it to the back of your mind, deep into your subconscious so you would not have think of such horrors. But that didn't mean their faces where etched in your mind. Nightmares, which you thought as dreams. Never did you scream about them when you had them, as they where normal to you. And surprisingly you seem to feel at peace about it. It's not like you knew right or wrong back then. So it didn't matter, you where alive yet lifeless than. But it wasn't your life that made you think deeply, it was just a bit of it. Those dreams, those dreams with those burning eyes staring you. The sound of an infant's cry, the hooded figures that loomed over the infant. The fire that erupted all around, you could almost feel the burning upon your flesh in those dreams, it felt like something was pulling you down, trying to take control. Those eyes though, that powerful locked gaze. They seem to burn your very soul. It frighten you, yet you seem drawn to it. The way they looked at you, sympathetically. There seem to be something in those eyes that made you feel everything was alright. They would offer what you wanted. It was all that mashed up, that made you second guess so much. All about your life to this very point. And Damian's words that rang so much truth, more than you wanted to admit. Hoping from place to place. Running felt more like it. Dick had told you before that Haley Circus was your family's home, where you were born and loved so much. He told you so much about your parents and yourself, which was nice. But, there was always something lingering inside you from what he told you, this strange feeling that made you wonder if it was actually true? It was nice to hear, though what could it really do? Besides fill your head with assuming thoughts and feelings. The soon became something else inside. That Damian pointed out and made it clear. That day you stayed in your room, you could have easily ran to contact Dick. But you didn't you choose not too. Not that time, because for some reason you where angry at him. Very angry. You had tried to mediate to clear your mind, but it didn't help. No doubt Starfire had mention this to Dick, because not an hour after it happened did he try to call you. You just ignored it. No longer looking at the locket, your eyes read through the information on your the screen of your computer rather quickly, while your fingers just as fast typed away. Your eyes darted from bit of information to the other, trying to find something, anything. Though you never where part of the Batman crime fighting family, you where taught a few of their tricks, having helped Alfred a couple of times during your breaks from school. Though the others skills where no doubt better than yours, due to your own morals you had. Refusal really to pry into others business, having done anyway for a good portion of your life, always left a uncomfortable taste in your mouth. But right now, that was out the door. This dang encryption where starting to become an bothersome, it would be so much easier if computers had emotions, than you could just take it, but they didn't. Feeling your frustrations rising mixing with your concerns, with the little bit of data you had managed to recover and read left a knot in your stomach. You just needed something valid right now... A knock came to your door.\"Hey Vi, it's Gar.\"Garfield calls to you behind your door. His presence did startle you, making you quickly delete what you had on your screen. \"Y-Yes?\"you stammer. \"You okay in there? You've been in your room for awhile, anyway I was wondering if you would like to come with me to the carnival?\"he said in his most charming voice he.\"Come on what do you say? Seems like you need some sort of cheering up? And what better way then to have, me the most magnificent specimen take you? We can ride the Ferris Wheel? Share a corndog or two, maybe something to drink? I could win you something, and the last ride we can take is tun-oww hey!? \" He was pushed aside by Jaime who gives his friend a rather annoyed look.\"Seriously?\"he knocks on your door.\"Hey Hermana, we're all going to the carnival. Starfire's orders, a way to ease the tension on this team. Anyway, we're leaving in about half an hour, so Starfire wanted us to come and get you. Look I know you don't want to go because of wh-\" The slides open and you come out dressed in casual embroidered print lace-up blouse bohemian style slash neck midriff-baring flare sleeve chiffon shirt white crop top, with deep blue demi shorts and knee high leather mossican laced boots. You had your hair back and clipped up and a smile on.\"Well, let's go.\"you tell them walking pass them humming merrily, they stood there a bit at a lost. You stop and look back at them.\"Well, come on, we can't keep everyone waiting.\"And start back up. Starfire drove everyone there, it was a rather quiet ride on the way there, except for you starting a conversation with the princess. You had to share with Raven in the front, making it a rather tight squeeze if that wasn't enough, with heavy tension coming from the back. If not for you and Starfire's light hearted talk the ride could have gone worse. Parking the car, everyone gets out Damian was about to bring his katana, which Starfire told him to leave it. He was the last one to leave, and follow the others. He presents his ticket to to person at the front, before entering he stops for a second and looks in your direction. A bit puzzled by your behavior, you had such a pleasant and merry smile, not to mention you leaning into Gar who whispered something in your ear making you giggle and playfully place a hand on him. He clenches the ticket stub, but remains calm and joins the others. Listening to Starfire's speech about everyone is going to have a good time and get to know each other a bit better. Which Jaime retorts about seeing Gar lick himself. After she was done, everyone went to explore and have a good time. There was so much to do here, all the lights, smells rides, not to mention good feelings and laughter. The first thing everyone did together was go on the Ferris Wheel, you decided not to join and stood with Starfire watching the others. While sipping on some pop.\"I'm glad you decided to come.\"she tells you. You look at her.\"Are you okay?\" You see the concern in her eyes, sipping the last of your drink you smile.\"Yeah. Just had to clear my head. That's all.\" \"I understand, but you know Violet yo-\" \"I'm out, excuse me.\"you tell her. Thumbing over your shoulder.\"I'm going to get some more.\"Running off, dodging that bullet, no doubt those where Dick's words, you didn't need some sentimental lecture right now. Reaching the concession stand, you buy yourself another drink along with some cotton candy. You choose the red one, a strange color for the candy, but you didn't care. It was a carefree night, finding a place to sit and eat to watch everyone. And be away from the rest, ripping off a piece of cotton it taste so bitter sweet as it went down. Your eyes watch everyone around you having a good time, with their significant other, friends, family. Kids with their parents, having a good time. Your eyes remained on them, watching them carefully and with a hint of jealousy that turned into loneliness. Damian's words began echo in your mind, there you sat alone in a wave of loved ones all around. So you shut your eyes to make it all go away, nothing but darkness. No sound. Nothing. Or so you thought, that presence came. The same as before, their voice this time you heard better, it was dark and powerful, yet comforting. Which wasn't strange, what was strange was what they called you. Child. Your eyes shoot open looking around for the owner of the voice. Child? Why would they call you that? Eyes darting to every single face none of their voice matched the one you heard nor did their emotions. It was malevolent. Dark. Powerful. Familiar. Where was it? Something inside, seemingly instinctive knew where to go. This strange hold over you, calling to you like a snake charmer. And you followed without hesitation. Leaving your food and drink. This voice, was telling you to come home. Promising to tell you everything. Everything you wanted to know. Provide you with what you wanted the most, to relieve you of the pain you held inside you. Show you everything. Such sweet hypnotic melody you follow the glowing eyes in the shadows, leading you away. A incorporeal spirit hand lays out for you take. \"Come child.\"they courses you.\"Come back home. And I will tell you everything, set your tormented soul free after all these years. You no longer feel void inside. No longer care. I have missed you dearly, my child. Come home and all will be well.\" Back at the carnival were your uneaten cotton candy and half drunk soda remained, Starfire picks up drink her eyes full of worry. \"Where is she?\" The others looked around for any sign of their teammate, who not where she said she would be. The Ferris Wheel took a bit longer than expected, now that it was over everyone came to meet up with Violet who was nowhere in sight. Yet all her things where here, even her side purse, which lucky no one took anything. Jaime comes back with Gar from the food stand, the green hero stuffing his face with popcorn. \"Well?\"Starfire said waiting for their answer. \"The guys said she was here, next thing she wasn't.\"Jaime said folding his arms, thinking.\"He doesn't know where she went.\" \"Maybe she went on a ride?\"Gar throws out.\"I mean this a carnival. Oh no!\"Panics. Everyone looks at him.\"What?! What is it?!\"Starfire demands. Gar looks at everyone deeply concerned and worried.\"I hope she didn't go on the Tunnel of Love without me?!\" Everyone gives him a annoyed look, Jaime smacks him in the back of the head.\"Dude not the time.\" \"What? What? It is important if you think about it.\"Gar defends himself.\"I'm just one step away from making her mine.\" Having enough Damian shoots at him with steel anger.\"I would suggest you keep it in your pants. Unless you want to get nurturer. \" Gar looks at him, Damian gives him a hard scowl. Who does the same back though with a rather cocky half smile.\"Okay you two.\"Starfire steps in-between them.\"Let's just focus on finding Violet, she has to be around here somewhere.\" Raven turns back to table where the girl's things rested. Her eyes remain on the red cotton candy. A cold sweat came over her, fear began to fill her eyes. Damn it. She hisses to herself, did they get her? There was no way they could? No way at all, she made sure of that, reminding her to keep her center. Raven took every single step to ensure her safety, the girl didn't know. She didn't need to, if they got their claws on her- it was bad enough they tired to reach her through dreams. The only way they could sink their unholy presence in the girl. Why did she leave her alone? If left alone, than it was much easier to...she didn't sense their presence so there was nothing to worry about. Right? Then why was she? If they had managed to find another way to get to her, Raven would have to...they both would be in trouble. The girl didn't know, she didn't know what was in her, like Raven did. Both of them grew up in Hellish places, taken from their loving homes, to be brought to different versions of Hell itself. The only difference, one knew of their heritage while the other didn't, making it easy to be preyed upon. To be corrupted than what they already where, just needed a bit of a push. She couldn't take the bait, she couldn't... Raven didn't want to fail, she couldn't let them win and take them away. She couldn't know the truth, she just couldn't. Clearing her mind, she starts to search for Violet quickly, trying to sense her. \"Violet!\"Starfire's voice breaks Raven's search bringing her back. The dark teen looks to see Starfire embrace you, who seem a bit confused why Starfire was worried. Nearly giving you a born crushing hug.\"I can't breath.\"you try to say. \"Where did you go?\"Starfire questions you. You look at Jaime and Gar who wanted to know too.\"You scared us Hermana.\"Jaime tells.\"You okay?\" \"...Yeah.\"you smile at them. Walking over to your things, and throw it away.\"Couldn't be better. Sorry to worry everyone. So, what's next?\"[Chapter 20] \"Raven, a photo booth come on.\"you grab hold of her and drag her off to the photo booth. The others watch you push her inside and you jump after her pulling the curtain back.\"Well she jumps right back.\"Jaime said.\"And who would have thought she could Raven to take pictures.\" \"Wonder if we can take some?\"Gar thinks about it. Jaime shakes his head at him, Starfire just smiles turning back the photo booth, five flashes went off and you and Raven step out. You wait eagerly for the photos to be printed, all the while Raven's eyes studied you,worried and suspicious. The others meet up with you both, Damian noticed the way she was looking at you, prompting him to look at you. There seem nothing out of the ordinary, you had you smile on which he no doubt felt it was a ruse to mask your displeasure for being here, yet then again, it didn't seem like it. Your smile was genuine. The pictures finish, grabbing the strip you look at each one, a total of five. You though smiled the most out of you and Raven, though on the last one there seem to be a rather faint smile. But one none the less. \"Here.\"you give her the strip.\"You can have it.\" Raven was a bit surprise.\"...Are you sure?\" You nod assuring her it was.\"Yeah, we're practically like sisters.\" Her hand stops an inch before taking the strip, looking at you shocked for a second by what you just said.\"...\" You smile at her, putting the strip in her hand.\"Right? I mean we're family right? All of us. Keep it, you never know moments like this, don't last forever.\" The way you said sounded a bit eerie and cryptic, her eyes never left you nor did your smile. Something didn't seem right, or maybe she was just reading too much into this, because next thing you just started to giggle for no reason, turning back to everyone. \"Shall we keep having fun?\"Starfire said heartily. The night went rather well, you enjoyed it well. Going to different game booths to play, Gar played a shooting game which he won a few tickets. Flashing it in Jaime's face, who then showed him up by doing the Ring the Bell. Which he used the Scarab that gave him extra strength and he broke the bell off, luckily the man didn't question he was way to stun at what Jaime did. Then came the ring toss which Raven did along with Damian who was hesitant at first but won the mots tickets out of everyone. When it came to you to do your game, Gar insisted you play Whack a Mole, but you choose: Basketball. It was just going to be you, until someone else showed a rather muscular athletic build man, with a cocky look. He was a lot taller than you, when he saw he was facing you, he just laughed. Which bother the others, mainly Jaime and Gar. Once the bell rang balls went flying, swishing, swooshing in the nets. The timer buzzed and the winner: You. Having gotten all your balls in, unlike the other guy who only managed to get two out of the five. You pick your prize a stuff wolf plushie. You gave it to Raven instead, which she took. A few more games where played, you played with Jaime the most out of everyone. And most of your time with Gar, even linking your arm with his, laughing with him or at what he said. Much to Gar joy, but not another's. Starfire was just happy to see everyone bonding and getting alone, a few times you pull Raven with you to go do something or try to get her. Had her a partner on a few rides, then would switch between Jaime and Gar, who tired to get you to go on the Tunnel of Love. Hinting at it heavily, to be foiled a few times by Damian inconspicuous about it. You did another photo booth with Jaime and Gar, than with Starfire, then Starfire and Raven. The only time you actually mingled with Damian was if you needed to say excuse me or needed to go around him. He remained rather stale towards you, which you didn't seem to notice. Being wrapped up with all the fun going on around you, the best part though doing DDR in the center of everything. When you saw it, you put things down go to the game. Waiting for your turn, when it came you went up against a few people fairly well. Thanks to all the practice you had with Jaime and Gar in doing this, matching your footwork with the symbols and beat to the music was rather easy, that is until Jaime came to challenge you. It started off easy at first, until Jaime flashed you a arrogant smirk and you knew right then he was just going easy on you. This time he leveled up. The crowd for you both, you do your best keep up with him, but, that didn't happen. He smoked you winning by a few hundred points. \"Maybe next time, Hermana.\"he playful says with pity. While turning around enjoying the crowds cheering. It didn't bother you, you accept your honorable defeat. Getting off the stage, Gar comes behind you.\"Don't worry Vi, I'll avenge you.\"he tells you with a chivalrous smile, turning to Jaime with a cocky look.\"Ready whenever you are.\" You hear the game start behind you as you make your way back to Starfire, Raven and Damian. Taking a seat at the table, you pick up you half eaten nachos and watch the two of them go at it, cheering them on along with the rest of the crowd. Turning around to find Raven looking at you weary. You just smile at her and offer her nachos but she declines. Instead walks over to you. \"Hey, can we talk?\"she whisper to you. Unsure why she wanted to, you agree placing your food tray down and follow her. Just a few feet away from Starfire. Feeling there was a enough distance to have the private conversation with you, she starts talking.\"Violet, did something happen to you?\" \"Happ-No, I don't think so, why?\"you give her a puzzled look.\"Is this about when everyone couldn't find me?\" \"Yes.\"she says directly.\"Was there...by any chance-Look, there are somethings you-\"she kept pausing trying to figure out how word what wanted to say carefully. You just stood there waiting for her to tell you, even if you seem a bit lost. Which it was clear to her you had no idea what she was trying to tell you. Maybe, it's just my imagination. She thought. Still, why do I get this feeling... \"Raven, are you alright?\"you start to become worried noticing how she looked. Something seem to spook her, you get ready to repeat the question, her arm shoots out in front of you protectively.\"Go back with Starfire.\"She orders you. \"Raven, what's wro-\" \"Now.\"she demands this time. And without another word melts into the crowd. \"Raven...\" Looking back over at the others, you disobey Raven and trail after her. Raven was able to leave the other undetected without anyone noticing. Making her way to the outskirts of the carnival, on the hill beyond the tent, away from everyone else. Into a more disclosed area, she carefully scans her surroundings, being cautious and ready. \"Sister!\"raspy dark voices call to her. She turns around to find a red skin demon with four red glowing eyes.\"He wants you.\" Feeling more presence, Raven finds herself surrounded by more of the creatures, manifesting themselves.\"We've missed you sister.\" Realizing who the emissaries where she is stun and in disbelief.\"It can't be him, it's a trick.\" To be proven wrong.\"It is me, child.\" their was only who had a voice so deep, dark and powerful, she knew of. One in which she was sure to never hear again. A voice that she couldn't believe was here. But her eyes saw it to be true, there coming towards her without a physical form but a in his incorporeal spirit form, still shook the earth and emitted nothing but evil and power. Trigon. Her father. \"How?!\"Raven in utter shock to see his presence. \"Never leave unfinished, what you start.\"he said.\"You fled.\" To which Raven refused to believe.\"I left. I had you.\" \"Yet, here I am.\" \"If you where really here, I'd smell your stink.\" Raven said with little fear and more so proving her point.\"All you could send where these losers.\" \"I will there. It's our destiny to be together, Raven. Always.\"the demon in some twisted way tries to sound sentimental.\"You can make that happen. Don't you want to be a family? I know she does.\"He lifts his head looking pass his daughter.\"Would you really deny, her that?\"Realizing who he was talking about, Raven turns around quickly to find you standing there confused and frighten. \"R-Raven?\"you look at her petrified at what was before you eyes. Demon looking creatures and some sort of dark, powerful spiritual form of either some sort of demon, with four eyes looking straight at you with such a powerful gaze. Straight into your soul, you felt his eyes burning it. It hurt, clenching your heart you drop to your knees. \"STOP IT!\"Raven tires to get to you, but the emissaries stood in her way, blocking her. Biting her anger she turns back around to Trigon.\"Let her go! Leave her alone! I won't let you hurt her.\" \"I'm not the one hurting her.\"Trigon claims. Pointing an accusing finger at his daughter.\"You're the one who tired to keep her hidden from me. You wouldn't let her come home. Back to her family, her father.\" \"You're not her father, nor mine. You cause nothing but pain and suffering.\" Raven throws back.\"You've given us nothing but a Hellish life, I had to protect her from you. I won't you sink your influence into her and corrupt beyond what you have already done.\" A malice giggle came behind her.\"Oh no!\"Raven turns around to meet with a back hand to the face, that sent her flying a few feet to the ground. Receiving minimal damage, she gets up and to her horror to find standing before what had tired to prevent since day one. All those times she came to visit you in your dreams, doing meditation, putting any charm on you to keep you protected from...this. Locking away Trigon in hopes to stop this. But it didn't matter, all of it was just futile. Trigon watches with glee and pride. As his child attacks Raven mercilessly with joy. Down with the others, Damian had decided to take on Gar with DDR and ultimately beat him a victory that was short lived, frighten and panic screams caused those around to quickly disperse, but, Starfire and the others they look to see what the threat was, and see Raven crash down surrounded by the demonic emissaries. \"Raven!\"Starfire yells.\"Titans GO!\"She tells the others, each of them transform into their attire except for Damian who had to run back to the car to get his gear. Suited and ready, the Titans hurry to Raven's assistance. Starfire catches her, which Raven tells her what the creatures are.\"Their demonic emissaries. My father sent them.\" \"You're father?\"Starfire was shocked to hear.\"Wait? Where's Viol-\" Before Starfire could even finish Raven pushes her away, separating away the two of them just in time while dodging the incoming attack on her. Taking the higher grounds Raven looks down at the dust that conceal her attacker. \"You need to snap out of this!\" Four red eyes flash towards her through the dust, paying no mind to what she had to say and instead leap straight up at her. They try to strike her, but Raven manages to put a shield and deflect it just in time. Throwing them into one of the booths. She knew that didn't stop them, they rush her knocking her back into a booth as well. They take this chance to over power Raven, with their dark hand drawn back, nails now sharp as claws charged with dark energy with dark grey outline thrust it at Raven. \"I don't think so!\"Jaime now as Blue Beetle, fires a shot blasting them away from Raven. He gets down and helps Raven up.\"You okay?\" \"Yeah.\"Raven tells him. Looking in the direction he blasted her attacker.\"She's not going to stay down.\" Raven gets ready taking the higher ground again leaving a confused Jaime. \"She?\" The others kept going, all the while Starfire was trying to Violet. She hadn't seen any sign of the girl since this all happened, come to think of she didn't even noticed she wondered off again. The idea of something dreadfully happening to the girl, Starfire wouldn't know how to break the news to Dick, even if she knew the girl could take care of herself well. The others hadn't seen any sign of Violet either. There was the possibility she got swept up in the crowd when they fled the place, but she was Titan and she would come to assist the others. Right now they could use her negative emotion absorbing powers with these creatures. Getting knocked down by one of the creatures Raven quickly shields her and Starfire, next came Jaime who was struggling too, Raven shields him, lastly Gar came flying over, so Raven just shields everyone in one of her domes. To hold off the creatures that came on all three sides, corner everyone, if not for Damian who came just in the nix of time taking out the creatures that easily regenerated, but thankfully they could not maintain their form once their energy became depleted. Everyone was to engage them until they wore out, easier said than done. Robin and Blue Beetle handled one, Starfire and Raven had another and Beast Boy took one by himself, though he would have had a partner if Violet was here. That didn't stop any of them, they gave the creatures everything. Over where Jaime managed to knock back Raven's attacker, their hand shoots up and begins to pull themselves up, quickly feeding off the negative energy to heal themselves, their eyes look around for one person, Rave. Locking their four eyes on her, go to take her out. Snarling at the sight of her, burning desire and hate flashed in their eyes on the girl. Feeling their presence, Raven having just finished destroying the demon turns around seconds to late to be tackled down hard and ruthlessly. Shocking and surprising everyone. \"What the heck!\"Gar freaks. They hear Raven struggling against something or someone. It was hard to tell who or what it was that had attacked Raven this time, it didn't matter, their teammate was in trouble. They race to help her, when a backlash of energy fires at them. It hits three of the four, Damian managed to avoid getting his, with his blade drawn he swings it forward at the creature jumping at with a spinning kick. Hitting them back while striking them with his blade, dropping down in front of Raven ready to go. \"I would advise you t-\"His eyes widen stun at who it was before his eyes, healing the gash wound from his blade. Just in complete shock his grip on the hilt loosens. Though their back was turn to him, he knew that body frame well enough, despite the changes it had. They began to turn around, having dark grey reddish skin, sharpened nails, black markings on their skin, from their hands to their elbows ebony black, attached to their tail bone swinging back and fourth a demon's tail with ruffle of fur at the end, four red burning eyes, sharper canines smiling maliciously at everyone , their hair was no longer black instead it changed to white. They weren't human looking anymore, taking on a more demonic appearance. The cold and uncaring looking they gave to everyone who just didn't know what to make of this. Trying to wrap their head around what was in front of their eyes. This couldn't be the same teammate they just spent a good time with, the same one who came to them six months ago to be apart of their team. The one who would be dragged into things despite not wanting too, spar with Jaime and share laughs with Gar. The tender girl who Starfire grew to adore and watched for Dick, the girl who was under care, now to be this. But for Damian, he understood about her transformation, but this...this was much more. They almost mirrored that strange entity he saw in Raven's mind when she healed him. This couldn't be, be... \"Violet?\"Damian finally speaks. Hearing him say your name, you look his way annoyed and angry. Sensing his emotions, you smile with joy.\"Violet, Violet what happened to you?\"Starfire looks you up and down still trying to wrap her mind around it, assuming one those things might have... Raven finally stands up.\"Violet. Don't let him. Whatever he said to you, is nothing but a lie. All of it. You don't understand what kind of creature he is! He will cause nothing but death and Hell for everyone. You have to resist him. That's wh-\" You stomp your foot silencing her.\"Shut UP!\"you hiss at her. Seeing the fear and shock on their faces made you smile.\"I don't give a damn what he does. You where trying to prevent him from getting to me. You where being selfish, Raven.\"you accuse her.\"We could have been a family. All three of us, but you wouldn't let it happen. You tired to prevent that, he understands what I want. My own cousin was nothing but a lie. A LIE! Nothing hurts anymore..\"you look at yourself simply with relief.\"The pain...all of it...it's gone now. It just all gone and he made it happen. That's what a father's suppose to do, make it all go away. He set me free from everything, I never understood before why...why I was this way. But now I do. And you, Raven.\"You step to her.\"You will help our father, even if I have to kill you myself...which I might as well!\"you lung at her, before Damian could react and the others. Your hands wrap around her throat tightly, you began to squeeze the life out of her.\"VIOLET! STOP!\"Starfire yells at you, she and the others had no choice but to attack you. Each of their attacks hit you off Raven. The princess gets down to check up on Raven who was fine. Seeing this disgusted you. Picking yourself up, you glare at them.\"They can't save you forever, Raven. You will release him. You'll have no choice, then...then...I'll have...\"you stop yourself with final look of hate and locking eyes with Damian, snapping your fingers your energy surrounds, and you vanish. \"...Okay what the Hell is going on?\"Gar freaks a bit.\"I mean, why is Violet..What is going on?! Father? Are you and Violet?\" All eyes fall on Raven, who guilt and shame was clearly visible.\"Raven,\"Starfire approaches her calmer.\"What's going on.\" Staring down at object in her hand, Raven lifts her head to everyone. Holding out the pictures from the photo booth of you and her.\"Violet as you all know her, is more than Nightwing's cousin, she is my sister. My younger sister. \"[Chapter 21] In the center of Hell, you stand before Trigon's prison, a giant red crystal thanks to Raven. You could feel his trapped presence demanding to be let out, while at the same time biding hid patience. Holding your hands out, black flames ignite around them and you shoot it at the crystal. Giving it everything you had, hoping to break it this way. But it was futile, the spell was stronger than your demonic powers. Tapping deeper into your newly discovered powers, absorbing ever dark emotion, and being in Hell it amplified it more beyond anything you could imagine. The power you conjured overflowed, why didn't know years before you could do all this. All this time, you barely scratched the surface of it, having to remain careful and cautious whenever you used them. Here, Trigon came you full access, sure you physical form changed to a more demonic look. But, it was part of your genes which you fully embraced. Your desire to be reunited with Trigon, all the he showed you and told you. Every single word hid no lies, nothing but truth came from him. You would show him how much you cared for him, he would see how grateful you were of him being your father. And be proud of you. Putting more into it, it still did not break. Cursing Raven under your breath. Sensing your anguish.\"Why have you stopped?\"he demands. \"I'm sorry father, but that witch...\"you sneer.\"The charm she put is more powerful than I thought. I don't have powers in the mystical arts, but I will find a way to get you out of your imprisonment, Father. Than we can be together, forever.\"You get down and kneel.\"There is no need for, my sister.\"you say with detest. \"Apparently there is.\"Trigon berates.\"If I didn't than you would have freed me by now. But it appears you do not have the power like, Raven. Your's is nothing but mediocre compared to her's. If you cannot break a simple charm.\" \"Father I am doing all that I can.\"you explain.\"I have just barely tapped fully in the power that has been laying dormant inside. In time I will have the necessary power, needed to release you. I don't understand why you wish for her assistance, when she has done nothing but shun you and dishonor you. You are nothing but consider dead to her, I on the other hand, am grateful for your very existence. Knowing that little witch she'll just flee and be selfish. With no consideration for her family. Unlike myself. If you would just allow me to of-\" \"Enough!\"his voice boom, silencing you instantly.\"As I have said before, though you are of my blood, my essence, the girl must release me. You are to be used as I see fit. Do not forget your place.\" Cowering in front of him, you nod your head obediently.\"Yes. Father.\" \"You will not harm her. Now go, you are my conduit, you are nothing but something to amplify my powers, nothing but a vessel of my power, until I require them. Once I am released from this forsaken prison. When I am free, do not worry we will be together. This world will burn and become my own. I will rule it.\" \"...Yes father.\"you bow your head.\"I will do all that I can to make sure it happens. Thank you, father. It will be nice to have a home. A real home.\" With the Teen Titans, Raven had transported everyone to her home, the ruins of Azarath a once peaceful place. Destroyed by Trigon, due to Raven having summoned him. Here she regelled them of her origins, how she came to be. Her mother becoming the wife of Trigon himself, and was taken in my the monks of Azarath, were Raven was born and raised. Only to be taken away by her father to live with him, until she escaped after imprisoning him. A backstory the others where shocked to find out, Raven explained to them how she had been on the run, until she came to the Titans. But that wasn't all she had to tell them. The question in everyone's mind, was how she and Violet where actually sisters. \"So is Violet, from Azarath too?\"Starfire inquires.\"Was another woman give to your father, like your mother?\" \"No.\"Raven said flatly.\"That's not how she was born.\" \"Then how?\"Damian demands.\"How is she related to you?\" \"Because not trying to be mean,\"Gar quips in.\"She is, I mean was less moody than you.\" Jaime elbows him.\"Dude really?\" Starfire looks to Raven waiting for her to explain.\"Raven, you have to tell us. Violet is, well she's not well now. She's completely changed and Trigon clearly has his claws in her. You have to tell us. So we can help her.\" Raven refused at first, it was her protective nature no doubt for the girl. But she realized it wouldn't do any good at all.\"You know that saying, be careful for what you want. It can dire consequences.\" She waves her hand, their surroundings change, the sound of an infant's cries rang around them. Coming into view a couple holding their new born baby.\"Who are they?\" Gar points at the couple, of the man with Black hair and deep blue eyes, and of the woman with the same color hair and brown eyes. Their bundle of joy in their arms, with rather pale skin who had a good amount of hair on its head, but blueish violet eyes. With the happiest smile. The others realized who they where. \"Whoa, is that heremana's parents?\"Jaime points. \"Yes. And no.\"Raven tells everyone.\"Violet was never truly their's to start. They where nothing but incubators for my father. She was born to them, but not really theirs. Born on a night of an eclipse and found the same day, this couple just happen to be walking by and heard her cries. They didn't know where she came from, all they knew was it was nothing but a lone baby. She was quickly taken in by them, into their family. Circus family. \" Haley Circus came into view.\"She lived a rather happy life for a short amount of time, before those of my father's followers found her and my father's work began.\" They watch as the infant was stolen from the trailer, and taken to a dark hidden place. Set down on what seem to be some sort of alter, hooded figures surround the infant and chant began. The words sounded Latin. Raven moves them along.\"For years she was kept hidden and being used as nothing but a mere tool for my father. Her powers to detect, absorb, release dark and negative emotions. Which wasn't actually true, she was actually extracting the souls of another, the darker the soul the more she feed off them. Harboring as power source for Trigon. A lovely gift from our loving father. Of course Violet wasn't aware of what she was doing. Which at that I had discovered her, before locking my father away, about her presence. I had to do something. So I did just that.\" \"You brought my father, and Greyson to her, didn't you?\"Damian puts it together. Raven looks at him.\"Yes. I did. I brought them to her. I had too, after which I knew she was safe and out of reach from my father. I locked him into away. I wanted her to stay there, well protected. She well shielded, or so I thought. When she left, I didn't expect his influence to find their way to her. It was slow as he searched for her, but became stronger. He began to manifest himself as dreams. Haunting her, doing anything he could to take hold of her. To course her to his side.\" \"You called her to come to the Titans, didn't you?\"Starfire figures it out.\"You brought her to the tower, to protect her. You wanted her close. So she would be..\" \"Be far away from, his influence.\"Raven finishes.\"But I failed. He has her now.\" \"Can she bring him back?\"Jaime asks. \"No. She can't. She's doesn't have the necessary skills to do so.\" Raven tells them, a sense a relief came from all of them.\"Unlike me, who was taught how to channel my powers and demonic side. Violet was not given such a tutelage. Even with the minor ones she has received on how to utilize them better. Only allowed her to embrace them more.\" \"You said, Violet's parents were nothing but incubators for your father.\" Damian questions.\"Why is that? Are you saying, they're not her real parents?\" \"Yes. You're correct.\" Raven confirms with a heavy heart.\"Violet was never of them, I am not sure of who her mother actually is. All that mattered was Trigon was given a powerful offspring. She is a hybrid like myself, but of the other half I don't know. I have no doubt, Trigon corrupted her by twisting her fears and desires. He has a way of doing that. Which allowed him to take control over her, and because of that the power inside her like my own is now coming forward.\" \"So, is she lost?\"Gar said sadly.\"Is Violet gone? What's going to happen to her?\" \"She will continue to be corrupted. And embrace every inch of Trigon's power, its giving her what she wants.\"Raven tells them.\"Trigon's already put us both through Hell, in different ways, if he is released he will bring more Hell than anything Violet can handle.\" \"Damian? Are you okay?\"Starfire notices the boy rather quieter than usual. The others look at him, noticing it too. The guilt and grief he masked. Starfire knew what it was.\"Damian, it's not your fault. Your words didn't cause this to happen. I-\"she reaches out a hand to him, but he moves away regaining himself. \"So what are we going to do?\"he steps up.\"How do we prevent anything else from happening?\"[Chapter 22] Impatiently and frustrated you pace back and forth awaiting the release of Trigon. Having given the location where Raven was hiding, sending some of your \"brothers\" more so your father's demonic emissaries to get her, by any means necessary. Should they come across the others, which they no doubt would, take them down. It didn't matter to you, they didn't matter anymore at all. That so called false family and friends. Those who you nothing but liars, heartbreakers, traitors, just everything. You would gladly enjoy watching burn and suffer, for everything they put you through. Their smiles and laughs became nothing but lost feelings and memories. Replacing with burning pain of anger. Your patience reaching its limits, you lash out with your black fire, killing few jut cause. No remorse in your eyes. Those still alive watch you pacing back and forth. Looking up at the crystal that kept Trigon at bay, kept him separated from you. From reuniting with him. Every time you looked at it, it just angered you, you didn't have the power to break him free no matter what you tired. Cursing yourself for not being trained in such arts, if you had been, your father would focus his attention on you, more so than that traitor of a sister, Raven. He would see you are the one he needs, who cherishes him beyond anything. More than happy to lay your life down, appreciate him for giving you life and powers. You would shower him with so much love, be by his side. Never to leave him. Supply him with whatever he needs. He would recognize you, he would give you what you craved most of all. He promised he would. If you just had the strength to do what he really wanted, than he would see you... Why did that witch have to do this? Why did she have to try and split up the family? Make your life horrible? If she just would have accepted and be a good daughter like you, than none of this would happen. The three of you would have been living together along your all powerful father. Why was she more powerful than you? It upset you, thinking about it. You're the one who embraced this side, felt your powers grow. You could take down a city if you wanted too, it would be easy. Why did you have to be born after her? Why did you have to get sloppy seconds? Why where you always in the shadow? Behind those stronger than you? Nightwing. Damian. Starfire. Everyone you knew, you where just second best, never the best. Always overshadowed by them. Yelling, you set a blaze those around you killing them. Corruption buried deeply in you, you could feel its powers taking hold, gripping you. The more it did, the more deeper and darker you sank. The more demonic you started to look. Damn it! What was taking them so long? They should have gotten Raven by now. How much longer must you have to wait for her? When this is all over, you would make sure to be the favorite child. She would serve her purpose as Trigon wanted her too, than you would go in and end her existence yourself. Claiming Trigon's love all for yourself. \"Sister.\"one of your brothers get your attention. You turn around to him. Snarling.\"We have her.\" Hearing that you both upset and happy. Finally something good.\"Good. Father!\"you turn around to the crystal.\"Did you hear? Father? They have her. They finally have her. Soon you will be free from your imprisonment.\"You rest a hand on the object. Stroking it.\"Then you will be free. Free to take control. This world will be yours, Father. I cannot wait to meet you.\" \"Yes, my child neither can I.\"he said.\"Now. Go and see greet you sister.\" Bowing to him, you comply and with your Hellfire teleport to her whereabouts. With no other choice and to spare the others, Raven allowed herself to be taken by Trigon's emissaries who possessed Wonder Woman, Flash and Superman. Who awaited the girl to fulfill her father's desire. There she stood before the large pyramid mystical shrine waiting for her. Angry and hopeless makes her way up. Stopping when a swirl of black flames with greyish outline appears and you appear before her. Your appearance more demonic than before, not to mention the attire you sported. Rather exposing, dark gray nearly black. You looked like a dominatrix. The sadistic glee smile you had on told her, just how far you had fallen. Even so, it didn't mean Trigon had his claws in you all the way. You welcome Raven with open arms. \"Sister. I'm so glad you've come.\"you tell her. Raven glares at you hard. Which you took rather hurtful.\"Oh. Sister, you hurt me. Why such angry eyes?\"you pout only to laugh vexing.\"Do like this?\"You spin around.\"I think its befitting don't you? I feel so free! Who would have thought I had this much power! Father truly is amazing! Do know what I've been doing? Hmmm? Come on take a guess?\"You lean in closer to her, she doesn't say anything. Annoyed by her insolence and your detest of her, you lash out your hand, grabbing roughly by the hair. Hissing at her.\"I've been trying to free our father from your DAMN IMPRISONMENT! You STUPID WITCH!\" Wonder Woman grabs your wrist, you calm down and let Raven go holding your hands up.\"I'm calm. I'm calm.\"you relax, smiling.\"Excuse me.\"You dust yourself off, fixing yourself.\"That was rather rude of me. Anyway, you are the eldest, I should learn to show you more respect. Now then, you Raven. Are going to be good and do as you where meant too.\"You turn around looking up at the steps.\"Father will be free, make waste of this rotten world. And I'll finally be reunited with him. We will be a family.\" \"Violet.\"Raven tries to talk some sense in you.\"Whatever Trigon, promise. It's all nothing but a lie. Trust me. It's nothing but a lie. He doesn't care for you. He isn't your family. Listen to me. Don't let him corrupt you.\" You look at your claws rather board.\"You know...\"your voice went cold.\"That's what someone would say, to keep things for themselves. I don't care. What that stupid mouth of yours is saying. It means nothing to me. All I care about it one thing...I will and have been showing father who his favorite is. I will lay waste to everything to see him happy. He showed me everything. Everything all of you have been trying to hide from me. You tell me his words are nothing but lies. All my life has been nothing but lies. All of it. And everyone will pay for it.\"The look you gave made her blood freeze. You meant every single word you said.\"Now then. Let's go. Father has been very impatient.\" You start to walk up the stairs, with her following. Each step taken Trigon's freedom became closer and you would have your father. The two of you reach the top, you step aside for her to go. She looks at you which you return a smile. Raven takes her position in the center of the two large rings. Winds and clouds began to come, you didn't mind the little chill. You just wanted the whole thing to start. About to lean, you felt his presence coming and quickly stand respectfully. Trigon's eyes appeared before you both. \"There had better be no trickery this time.\"His said to Raven.\"Girl. If you want me have mercy for your friends.\" \"No tricks.\"Raven assures him. While pleading for him to leave this world alone.\"Please I beg of you, leave this world alone.\" \"And fort destine!\"He roars.\"We were meant to be together. Always. And we shall.\" Hearing that made you angry. You glare at Raven with detest, it would be so easy to just take her out. Why? You wondered. Why was she more important than you? What made her so special? You submitted yourself to Trigon, not lock him away. Accepted him as your family. Unlike this ungrateful winch. Was it because she had more power than you? You had power too! In fact you had to have more than her. You embraced your demonic heritage than she did. Forming a flame blade, Trigon sensed your murderous intent and shot energy beams from his eyes at you. You scream in pain, cowering under his power. It hurt. Your skin felt like it was on fire. Falling to your knees, you dare to stand up against him.\"F-Forgive me!\"you scream your apology. Hearing it, Trigon kept it going for a few more seconds. Seeing you in pain, Raven steps in front. Making Trigon stop.\"...\"She looks at him. That was a surprise. You didn't expect Raven to come in and put herself in harms way. It didn't make any sense. Was she showing off how stronger she was compared to you. As you pick yourself up, the ritual began. Forcing her to use her powers, the shrine began to force her to bring Trigon to Earth. The floor under you started to deteriorate from its power. To save yourself you hurry down, forcing yourself to ignore Raven's screams of pain. All that was on your mind right now was seeing Trigon. With your Hellfire surrounding you, you teleport back to Hell. Making it back just in time to see Trigon break free. He was so monstrous, you could his power emitting off him. You felt weak compared to him, instead of fearing you where overjoyed to see him. Your father was here. In the flesh. Your family. Quickly you bow deeply to him. Welcoming him back. \"Welcome. Father.\"you look up at him. Realizing your presence he looks down at you. There you kneel before him, his other offspring. Another pawn. This was what his union made, a meek child. Who completely devoted herself to him. He could feel his own blood and power surging through her very being. Such power in something so small, her mother's powers he could feel in her. Both his and her's mixing together. That treacherous and devious winch, then again he wasn't surprise. At least he got to his second daughter first. He could use her, having shown her already shown her, her \"history\". He cast his hand over her.\"Show me child. Show me you are my own.\"With that he unleashes a strange energy on you. You didn't know what it was that came over you, but all you knew was that your blood began to burn. Everything burned. Paying no mind to your screaming, he leaves to take what his. This Earthly plane. He would leave nothing in his wake. All will be crushed under him. You watch him turn his back to coldly, leaving you to suffer this excruciating pain. This wasn't what you expected from him. Was this some sort of punishment? What had you done wrong now? Recalling his words he said a few seconds ago. This was some sort of test? This had to be. Telling yourself to get it together. This was nothing. This pain was nothing. You. A Daughter of Trigon. Would not submit to the likes of this. Your brothers, his emissaries, creatures, surround you to see what would happen. A mistake on their part, accepting it, you unleash a huge wave of demonic energy obliterating all around you. Rising above everything. This power. Was unbelievable. Giving into it, you let out a roar.\"I AM THE DAUGHTER OF HELL. TRIGON'S TRUE HEIR!\"The creatures and emissaries below bow submissively to you. Afraid of your power. Feeling their fear, a devious smirk spreads on you. You come back down, the second your foot touches the ground, you could feel all of Hell's power rush through you. And what a rush. This was your domain. This was your home. Looking at your many reflection, in the crystal prison. Pleased by your new appearance. A screech of terrifying joy emits from you. A screech that the Titans and Cyborg heard having now entered Hell thanks to Raven, who came to re-imprison Trigon again, while the Justice League try to prevent Trigon from reaching innocent civilians. They look in the direction in which it came. Fear plastered on Gar's face. \"W-What was that?\"he stammers. Raven slightly weaken, knew exactly who it was. She couldn't believe he did that to her.\"Was that...Hermona?\"Blue in shock. \"Dude!\"Gar alerts the others, everyone looks to see a flock of winged creatures headed their way. Starfire gets ready and tells the others.\"Get ready.\"her eyes light up. With his blade drawn Damian was ready to take on the horde, though his mind was elsewhere. Looking in the direction were the creatures flew from. No doubt in his mind who it was that sent them. The amount of creatures told him this, they truly were trying to eliminate them. After what he and the others learned about Violet through Raven, her older sister. He wondered if it was too late. Your eyes cast down on them, watching them fight against your horde, your pets. You had domain over this realm, Trigon's powers followed through you. You could reshape everything in here. The joy of watching them struggle was amusement. Their lives in your hand, they would suffer for their lies and selfish ways. They meant nothing to you. None of them. Realizing you actually wanted to end them yourself, with your hands. Get ready to include yourself in their demise when you sensed the presence of Raven. That crafty little witch. You thought. Looking behind you at the crystal. Putting two and two together, a coy grin appears. She wanted to reseal Trigon again. This was perfect. Devising a plan to end her, you would let her get close and when she did...slowly you dematerialize away to hide your presence, while summoning another to aid you. Their soul trapped here, offering anything to your father at another chance at life. This would play out nicely. What joy you felt. What pure joy. Giving her an opening, Raven makes her way to the crystal in attempt to imprison Trigon again. Reaching the top of the tower, she lands finding it where she left it and makes her way over to it. Getting ready to use it, but another was there to prevent her. The undead Ra al Ghul, Damian's grandfather, threw his sword at the crystal. Shattering it into pieces, the attacks her, kicking her back. With his blade high he plunges it down upon the girl to end her, only to be foiled by Damian who come in the nix of time to her aid. Blocking his grandfather's attack, whom he was shocked to see. Ra's was glad to see his grandson and tries to course Damian over to his side and forsake his now righteous path. Torn between his love for his grandfather and duty to his new path in life. Damian admits with a heavy heart how badly he wanted and would do anything for his grandfather, but he was a Titan now. And those old way were now gone. The two engage in spare. Damian over came his grandfather who's chance at living again vanished. Turning around to Raven who overcame her father's attempts to prevent her from imprisoning, takes a shard of the crystal and begins. With you leaving the defense to Ra's decided to toy with the others. Reshaping the area and sending more hordes at them. Cackling with delight, their struggles and suffering was music to your ears. You though made sure to keep your distance from them, sending Hellfire sprouting up like geysers. You nearly got Gar, this was fun. Controlling everything. When you finished up with them here, you would go after your unappreciative sister. Make her pay for everything. Kill her. Once she was out the way, it would be just you and Trigon. You would show him, you were the favorite child. You would not turn on him, ever. He would so proud, he wou-Something wasn't right. Whipping around at the tower, to your horror Raven had cast the spell to imprison Trigon again. No! Damn it! No! She couldn't do again, not again. Forgetting about the others, you teleport back over quickly to prevent it. But, you where to late, she did it. It was a struggle but, she did. Looking at the shard now her father's prison. His power would not and no longer harm this world. Damian helps her to her feet, the others make their way over to the two. Starfire hurries over when Raven felt a dark presence. Quickly she covers everyone in a protective shield as a Hellfire blast came down on them. \"YOU WITCH! YOU WITCH!\"they hear you yell in anger outside.\"I'M GOING TO KILL YOU! ALL OF YOU!\" You unleash more Hellfire upon them. Raven already slightly weaken from imprisoning Trigon kept it up the best she could. But the heat was beginning to leak through. Seeing this, Starfire tells everyone to separate. On her mark they do, Raven puts down her shield and everyone moves out the way, just barely avoiding the stream of Hellfire. \"Whoa!\"Gar couldn't believe what he saw.\"That was WAY to close. We could have been roasted! Who the He-\"he turns around speechless and in shock at who he saw. His eyes widen in disbelief, rubbing them a few times to make sure this was what he was seeing. Hoovering in front of everyone dressed in dark grey almost black dominatrix mini dress, with a deep V stopping just to their stomach, quite reveling attire, with matching gloves and thigh high boots. Hellfire like wings coming from their back, their white hair now wild, four glowing red eyes and deep dark grey red skin. Sharper nails looking like claws, encased in the flames of Hell. Sharper canines. Their appearance was more demonic than human, snarling at all of them, but their eyes locking onto Raven. They could see and feel their intense hatred and murderous intentions towards her. The others where just there as extras. They just couldn't believe it. This was not the Violet they knew, who came to them months ago. Her appearance completely changed. It was like everything she had inside now manifested itself outside. What did Trigon do to her? What did he turn into? And more importantly, was she lost forever? Because the way she looked made it seem like she was. \"Violet.\"Starfire tires call to you.\"Violet. It's me. Starfire. And everyone else. You're frie-\"You shoot a blast of fire at her, shutting her up, she dodges just in time. Shocked by your hostile attack. You take a more poised stance. Running your fingers through your white hair seductively. A turn on for a certain green boy, if not for his life being in danger. Your merciless look at each one of them with little interest. But they knew it was nothing but a ploy. They kept their guards up. Seeing them on edge you take this time look at yourself in the broken shards. They didn't really know what to make of this, just a second ago you nearly offed Starfire. And now you seem to not care. Gar had to tug on his collar to try and cool himself off and avoid his eyes from looking below your neckline. The position of you bending over gave him more of a show than he imagined. Sweating now, and not because of being in Hell. To control himself he shuts his eyes, and forces his mind to think of something to ease his...animalistic urges from taking over. Yet, he felt trying to fight against them pointless. Damian shakes his head in sadly at him.\"Useless.\"he grumbles and turns back to you. You had finished admiring yourself in the shards, and moved to sitting a throne you created with flames. Lounging in it, looking at each of them rather boarded and irritated. \"...Well...\"you stretch looking at them.\"Friends, you say? Friends? You use that word so loosely and intimate. Yet, from what I see. I don't have any.\"You adjust yourself in the throne, sitting upright. \"Violet. That's not true.\"Blue carefully treads.\"You do have friends. We're all here for you. We came to take you back.\" Your eyes shoot over to him.\"Back? Back you say? To where?\"Tilting your head.\"Oh! You mean back to that wretch place called \"home\" How cute and pitiful.\"You snarl lightly.\"I am home. Or at least home in a sense.\"You shoot your eyes towards Raven. Locking with hers for a few seconds. Breaking when Damian spoke.\"This isn't your home. You're home is back with everyone else. Back with the Titans. With Greyson, your cousin.\" You eyes narrow at him.\"He isn't my family.\"Your tone harsh and cruel.\"He never was. He lied to me. Like all of you. Well, maybe not you Damian...No not you. You seem to be the most brutally honest out of everyone. So I should thank you.\" Unsure what you meant, he questions it.\"What are you talking about?\" \"Now. Now. Don't be modest. Because of you, I've come to inherit this marvelous power. Like you said...\"you stand.\" \"I haven't changed.\" \"Still no backbone.\" Need I quote more? Oh, my favorite: \"You're nothing but a lost puppy. Lost.\" \" Remembering those exact words, those bitter and spiteful words he told you when he arrived. Seeing the consequences of them. This wasn't what he wanted. Cursing himself for even having those words exit his lips. Only saying them to hide his own pain. If he had known he wounded you this badly than, he would withdrawn the words. But in life you cannot take back what one says. Gripping the hilt of his sword. \"I-I...\"he tries to find the right words to say. But nothing came out. Just like you expected. He couldn't say it. Only making you more disgusted, that turned into anger. Which turned into joy.\"No need to beat yourself up, Damian. Be happy. I'm not longer a lost PUP,\"you emphasize the word.\"I've found my home. I've changed. And now I have backbone. The power my father has given me, has awaken in me will give me all the backbone I need.\"You turn your full attention on Raven, the burning fury you had for returns in a flash. \"Violet! NO!\"Starfire and Blue yell, racing to Raven, only to be slow. You lunge at her ferociously, your hands coated in flames. Tackling her down, the two of you tumble off the side. The others quickly race to the edge, Gar opens his eyes again asking what was going. Seeing the others looking over the edge, he goes and sees you and Raven struggling against the other. It was clear you wanted her dead. Both of you plummet down towards the fire. You didn't care, getting your revenge was more important.\"You took him away from me! YOU took everything! You'll PAY!\" Able to keep you at bay, Raven manages to release herself from you. And fires back, you manage to dodge her attack. Quickly you fire back with a blast of Hellfire. She evades it and comes at you, using her energy to try and hold you down, while trying to knock some sense in you. \"Violet. You have to listen to me.\"she tells you.\"Trigon. He's not your real family. He doesn't care about you. About anything.\"She dodges a blast and shoots back.\"Trust me. He doesn't. You can't let it control you. Remember? You can't.\" You dodge her blast and fire back.\"I don't care if just using me! At least...IT doesn't matter! You've done nothing but strip everything away from me. Everyone single one of you has. I will belong somewhere! I will know who I am! He said I would! Give him back to me! Give me back my life!\"You scream unleashing a huge blast at her, she had to put up a shield to protect herself. But gets knocked back. You land down a few feet away from her, your hand out ready to blast her.\"Look at you. On your knees. Pathetic. I don't see why he considers you a daughter. You're nothing but a disgrace. I on the other hand won't be.\"The fire starts to build up and you get ready to blast her, when something shoots pass you and lodges itself between you and Raven. It was Damian's sword. Looking at it for a second left you open, by the time you realized it. It was too late. Damian comes down throwing smoke pellets at you obstructing your view. Followed by frozen ones, freezing your feet in place. Gar comes behind changing into serpent and wraps around you. Blue comes apologizing quickly before he fires at you with Cyborg and Starfire. Gar releases you just in time, their attack combine and hit you together. Sending you crashing back. Leaving you in a daze for a bit, Raven gets back up focusing solely on you. Clearing her mind, she sends out her soul self right at you. Just as you get up, end up hit by it. It engulfs you, the watching as Raven struggles to bring you back. Trigon's essence and hold on you was strong. You where fighting back against her. Refusing to relinquish it. You weren't going to let go of what made you whole. Gave you purpose. This was your power. You didn't want to be afraid. Lost again. \"What's wrong?\"Starfire notices Raven struggling.\"Why isn't it working?\" \"S-She doesn't want to give it up.\"Raven tells her and everyone.\"She's...She's afraid. She's scared.\" \"What? Why?\"Gar didn't understand.\"Isn't that power bad for her?\" \"She d-doesn't care.\"Raven grunts.\"Trigon really got...his claws in her. I'm trying to tell her...to fight back. Sh-She's scared. Just scared.\" \"There has to be something we can do?\"Blue looks at you worried.\"Maybe if we knock her ou-\" \"Damian!\"Raven calls to him, he looks at her nodding knowing what to do. Looking at what was in his hand, he rushes to you. Avoiding the backlash of energy coming from you. He had to get this just right. He just had too. Otherwise... Clenching his fist tightly. If this would bring you back, the Violet he knew. Not this, whatever this was before him. The very first friend he made when coming to live with his father and his world. The transition in life the two of you have been through together. Conflicted with the harsh words he said to you. Led you down a dark path, a path you he admitted helped him avoid. Now you took that path. And it was because of him. If this didn't work, he wouldn't be able to forgive himself. \"You have a home.\"he said.\"With Greyson. My father. Alfred. The Titans. Your sister Raven. Richie.\"he pauses for a second.\"And with me.\"He jumps up and thrust what he had in his hand on you. Pushing hard to get it through. Disrupting the energy. He could feel you trying to fight back against Raven and himself. So he pushed harder. Ignoring the pain and minor injuries he was receiving.\"Damn it! You're not leaving me. Violet!\" A bright light began to emerge much to his surprise, blasted him Blue catches him.\"Everyone! Down!\"Starfire tells them. Raven sensing it worked covers the others. Just as the energy from you erupts in a beam of bright light for a second. Quickly she puts her shield down and hurries over to you, Damian right on her tail. Starfire and the others follow after them. They reach you, finding you unconscious, but alive. Sighing in relief, it worked. \"Oh Dios mio.\"Blue sighs.\"She's okay. She's okay.\" Everything felt light. Your body wasn't heavy anymore. It was strange, that bright light you felt pushed way that dark essence forced upon you. Your mind was spinning, trying to recall everything. The last thing you remembered, was...you weren't sure really. You didn't know. Feeling lost and unsure. That feeling came back again, the same one as before. The one you had years ago when you were just a child. Alone. Unnoticed. Empty. Fragmented. Nothing felt together. Where was everyone? Did anyone even exist? Those cries? Listening carefully to those distance lonely infant cries, they reached you. It started to become clear. The cries became closer and closer. They sounded so alone. So very alone. Opening your eyes, you find yourself in dark, in the night during an eclipse on a cold winter evening. And there on the ground all alone a lonesome baby. All alone. By herself. This was you. This was always you no matter what. Always alone. Never wanted. \"Never wanted.\"Trigon's voice rang through your mind. His constant reminder of your misplacement. The part you feared about yourself. The horrors of what you did in steed flooded your mind. All he made you do, left you...left you empty. Again. Just like those thugs back then, who forced you to do horrible things to others, for their benefit. Why? Why did you think Trigon was any different than them? They gave you nothing, nothing at all. Except pain and misery. They didn't give what you desired the most. Left you broken and lost. Like a leaf in the wind, unable to find a place. You've been here and there. Never to stay in spot. Nowhere to call your own. Nothing...nothing but a lost puppy. A lost puppy you have always been. It hurt. It hurt so bad. Falling to your knees, you began to cry. And cry. In the infirmary you rested, having yet to wake up. Yet tears came down your eyes. The battle against Trigon and the others did a number on you. Your mind from what Raven told them and soul was in bad shape right now. You had received heavy damage. Leaving you a comatose sort of state. You had to heal, unlike herself who knew how to fight back against Trigon. You were not, having not been properly trained. Left you open for him. He took control of you. Taking hold of what broke you. Corrupting you, till your soul was no more. Or at least he thought. There was still a bit of you in there he had yet to take. Without the aid of the others, she was sure they would have lost you. Right away when they came from Hell, they rushed to tend to you. There as no need really for anything medical. This was all Raven's area, she had to do this. Using her training she learned from Azarath. Your soul needed to be cleansed, though after all that she highly doubt it ever would be. Just like herself, Trigon's influence was now inside. She would have to teach you now, to keep him forever at bay. Unlike before, were she was trying to teach you not to give into him. To ignore him. This was different. But that wasn't all. As you stated before, being the daughter of Trigon. It showed. Though your human appearance was in a sense in tact, except for the fact your hair no longer black instead it remained white, you kept your canines and Trigon's ceremonial markings on your body. You did keep your two eyes and eye color nearly matching her own. Skin color remained the same. Which was good. Nightwing was told about your condition by Starfire. He came over so fast and never left your bed side. He was told everything, even about Raven being your sister and admitted that you where not really related to him. But that didn't mean you were not his family. Everyday he would talk to you, waiting for you to open your eyes up. The others came to visit. Jaime telling you to come back out so you and him could finish the card came. Starfire reminding you this was your home. Gar tired to joke with you. And lastly Damian. There was much he said, except sit by your bed side, listening to Nightwing talk with you. Reminiscing about your life. Apologizing that he hadn't told you sooner. All Damian did was look at you, reflecting. Like he was right now, Dick was out of the room to go and do something. Raven came in to check up on you, to help guide you back. Damian didn't look her way. She places a hand on your forehead. Like before, to quickly take it off. Damian looks at her, the stun and surprised look she had told him there was something new. \"What is it? What is it?\"he demands from her. She looks at him with unreadable look. That made him upset, which she didn't pay attention too. Instead leaves quickly. He wanted to know what it was she knew, in order to that he would have to follow her and leave you here. That he didn't want to do. Just as quickly as Raven left, she came back with the rest of the team and Nightwing. All of them surround your bed. \"How is she doing?\"Starfire ask deeply worried. The tone of her voice told Damian this wasn't good news. Not wanting to go there, he waits for Raven to speak. The anticipation of silence was too much. Raven looks down at you, holding out a hand.\"...\"Her hand starts to glow. She starts to chant, and in a few seconds your eyes slowly start to open. It was a struggle at first. In fact it took you quite awhile. Opening them up half way, you couldn't really see those looking at you. Which was okay, you close your eyes back to rest. Everyone was overjoyed to see you had come back. Relieved you hadn't left them. A small smile comes to Raven as she looks down at you. She then notices out the corner of her eye, Damian. Looking pass his front, she could he was just a happy as the others, the only difference. The guilt in his eyes that wouldn't allow him to full enjoy this merriment. Not even allowing him to fake it. The detest look he had for himself over the guilt, he just left the room.[Chapter 23] Everything seem to change, just everything. Even your appearance, which you had to accept against your will. This was nothing but a reminder of the sins you committed and the choice you made. Sure at first glance you might appear to look human. But with another look eyes would see you were far from it. Staring your reflecting in window. The markings of Trigon engraved no branded permanently on your body from head to toe. Markings on your face. Your black hair no longer your own, now changed to his color. Your eyes thankfully remained the same, your ears slightly but fully pointy the tips black. Your teeth nearly matching Gar's. There was nothing you could do to change it. You had to accept it, this cruse. Even your powers, Trigon so kindly unlocked in which was nothing but a sin and disgrace. Your original powers still remained, though it seem less controllable than before. Which caused you to unleash your Hellfire. A part of you was still connected to that realm, its presence haunted you. Unsure how to deal with it, it felt like your soul was being ripped apart. It hurt. It hurt. Raven, she was right all along. But, you didn't listen to her. Being blinded by falsity of hopeless lies. Promises that were nothing. You felt so ashamed and disgusted with yourself. Even after it all she still helped you through it all. In your semi-coma you could feel presence in your mind and soul. She was just trying to protect you, just like before, when she would visit you, though kept herself concealed so you would not know who she was. Everything was for you, even when you became corrupted by Trigon, she kept trying to bring you back. Never did she try to strike you down, minus of course the small fight between the two of you in Hell. Never did you think your raw emotions could be so amplified so much. They blinded you from thinking clearly. You saw her as enemy and nothing else. Wanting to end her life and the others. Just thinking about it made you sick. Nothing but weighed guilt remained in you. Which turned into something, something else. It wouldn't allow you to appreciate the others company, nor see their joy of you being well. Guilt wouldn't allow you. Not when what you did to them, what you've done in the past. The skeletons in your closest began to become crowded. You saw nothing else. There was no light at then end of any tunnel for you. You became somber and lost. Empty and dead. Pain seem to be all you knew. Darkness was all you knew. It was your source anyway. That cold winter night. You didn't belong anywhere. At least Raven had a home for a bit when she was younger. She knew who and what she was, but you...you didn't. Since day one, from what you gathered from your past. You had no identity. None at all. Was that the reason you followed Trigon? He was going to give you a purpose? An identity? A name? Sure, Violet was the name Dick gave you, but was that your real name? Where you real? The only way you felt real was, was when you felt empty. Back there...back in that damp, dark place. That was your home. It just had to be. Making the most sense. Here with the Titans, sure didn't fee like it. It didn't feel like it at all. Nothing seem to. And with the way you looked now, why should it be. No longer were you human, if you could call yourself that. What where you exactly? You didn't know. Besides, something that didn't exist, it was alright to disappear. No one would miss you. You could fade into obscurity. Jaime and Gar walk down the hall, towards the infirmary. Jaime with a deck of playing cards and Gar with well, with video game console and stuff kitten. Ready to spend some time with their friend and teammate. Jaime couldn't wait to began a game of cards, whatever card game they wanted to play was fine with him. He knew how she enjoyed playing them with him. It was there little thing. Something to get her back to her old self. She hasn't been the same since she came out of her semi-coma. Raven told them, she was just tired. Her mind, body and soul had to reconnect back together. The lost look in her eyes, worried all of them. Despite all that happened and what she did, no one held it against her. They couldn't even try to imagine what she's been through. Since day one in life, from what Raven told them. All they knew was, their friend was consumed by darkness and pain. They had to save her. Her and Raven, both sisters and children of a demon. Talk about a Hellish life. Both of them suffered at and by the hands of their father. In different and yet same ways. One knew how their father was, while the other was forced to learn and be branded with a forever reminder. A part of them broken and lost. It would be a lie to say things would go back to normal. Because it didn't seem like it. That empty and bleak look lingering heavily in her eyes. The fear and darkness that consumed her. The subtle anger that turned into internal pain. The force suffering they wanted on themselves. The lost and confusion behind every blink they took. They just had to do everything they could to bring back a part of them, even if it was just a little. They had to at least try. Nightwing stood by her bedside while she laid in her semi-coma, rarely moving. And when she awoke he couldn't be more relieved like the others. It showed he loved despite her history and everything that transpired. To him, she was the only family he had left. He would come by every now and then to check up on her condition or would call about it. And it was always the same. Nothing. Nightwing wasn't the only who worried and remained by her bedside. Raven pretty much tied with him. She was the one who worked tirelessly to ensure her sister would heal in some way. It seem she took her role as a sister rather seriously. Yet at the same time felt responsible for the condition, Violet was in. Raven had informed everyone, she would have to teach her sister how to control her powers and new additional powers. She was going to need it. At least her demonic side, as the other side of her sister Raven didn't know fully. At least she could help her sister in some sense. Everyone put their best foot forward in Violet's recovery, except for one. Who rarely came into visit the tormented heroine, for reasons no one seem to really understand. Damian. He seem to be absent or put all his energy into training or missions. It seem like anyway he could avoid going. A few times he would be seen at the door, staring at her. It was rather hard to read his face, Gar took it rather insensitive and cold. A few times he expressed his feelings about Damian's behavior to him. Which Damian just didn't care. Though if he did come in, it was when she slept, never when she was awake. And he would just look at her for a few seconds then leave, he had uncanny ability it seem to know when someone was about to come and leave. It didn't matter. Those who came and cared where there. Jaime and Gar reach room, with smiles on ready to enjoy some fun games. To have their assumed chill time destroyed. Starfire seeming baffled and worried, Cyborg scanning, Raven in mediation and Damian who looks at the two of them just as they enter. And to the shock of the two heroes, Violet's bed...empty. There was no one or anyone in it. There was no sign of struggle or anything. The two of them had to do a double take, and rush over dropping everything they had to the floor. Questions in their eyes, wondering what? How? Where? Questions that lingered in Starfire's eyes as well. Gar anger about to transfer to Damian, to be stopped by Raven who opens her eyes, informing everyone she located her missing sister. No sooner had she said that, Nightwing comes rushing in. Demanding any sort of information of his cousin's whereabouts. Starfire quickly apologizes to him, while consoling him too. And informs him Raven has managed to lock onto Violet, Raven tells everyone through a cryptic message the whereabouts of Violet. It made no sense to anyone. Even Raven seem at a lost. Everyone looking to Nightwing in hopes he might know, it took a minute to figure it out. By that time, Damian had already figured it out and left the group. Though not before taking something with him. The others follow after him. Slums, always remain slums no matter what. In damp and dark, a place in society forgotten by others. A very few actually survive and leave this place. This retched and depression place. Where nothing seem to grow or even show any sort of sign of life. The ground full of cracks and rotten trash. The smell of urine and feces was the aroma. Toxic fumes mixed in. Soulless and mindless bodies laid about or lingered around. Death in its physical form many would see it as. Hopelessness and lost in the eyes of those who lived in this life style. Crime and murder merged into one. If one where to blink, their blood would be spilled out. Death's playground. Of the wondering live souls. Rotten and broken down buildings and homes. Eyes of those who have lost in a sense their sight of light. A perfect place for those who society no longer cared for or care to bother with. Letting them fester and die. Lay waste to the space they took away from another. The perfect place for one who has lost their way. To travel back to the only place they knew as their home for most of their life. A place that gave them an identity, even if they had none. Their broken soul would be lost here. The pain they felt could be unleashed. This place would be their home, their realm. Their new Hell home. Being here seem to silence those voices. Block out their connection to Hell itself. Make them forget about their horrors. But, still left them feeling empty and lost. Wondering down the streets paved with broken glass and whatever else God forsaken things. They didn't care what cut their bare feet. The pain was nothing. Physical pain like that, was just nothing. Concealing themselves and appearance with their cloak. They no longer being human or having human features. Nothing but their right eye showing, looking back at them from their reflection. That reflected all the horrors they had done. Fear made them take flight and run away. Keeping their head down, ashamed of it all. There was solace for them. Tears they felt build up in their eyes, which they refuse to let fall. Causing it to fester into anger, anger turn into fearful anger. Bringing forth the power they so desperately wanted to keep at bay. But the flames of anger and fear, was more powerful than anything. Either they give into it or keep running from it. Tripping over their own feet, they scurry to get up trying hard not to set ablaze anything. For the flames, their eyes could see those demonic four eyes looking at them. Haunting them. Coursing them to give in. Calling for them, demanding they help. The voices wouldn't stop. They couldn't. Voice of others haunted them. The poor tormented souls they ruined. Hurt. Came. And they being like a magnet of such things, attached themselves. Clawing and screeching their voice, they just didn't stop. Was this the price for power? For wanting more than one could handled? The sins one must have to pay and endure? Unable to take anymore, they unleash. Unleash it all. The Hellish inferno inside them. Fire spewed up and expelled everywhere around their vicinity. Unable to control it any longer. They became lost in it all. All of it. The voices, hide their own. The emptiness and lost in their souls, drowned them into the depths of the abyss. Where did they go wrong? Where? Trying to recap their life? Was when they were found by their two knights? When that boy came into their life? Trying to stand on their own? What was it? They didn't know? Their mind and soul like a endless foggy maze. Their pain, becoming more unbearable, their tears burned coming down their face. The vortex of Hellfire surrounded them like a prison. Growing by the second. They didn't know what to do, except fall to their knees and curl up. Wishing to no exist anymore. Mumbling and babbling incoherent words. Their violet eyes remained wide, as their tears came down. The markings upon their body started to light up and began to change their appearance against their will. There was no light their eyes could see. None at all. The high winds vortex began to lift up their fetal position body off the ground. Afraid, they shut their eyes. Outside just a few buildings away, Damian stood there dressed as Robin. His hood up, he looks at the massive size black flame vortex, that roared through the night. Setting ablaze and obliterating all around it. It was wild and raging. Violent and confused. No doubt in pain, lasing out in anger. This, this was what he...looking at what hid in his hood. He wasn't sure if this would actually work. Then again, he had to at least try. No he had to give his all. Forsaking his doubts and getting serious he carefully calculates how to get in the center. To get to her, just as she did with him. With his blade out, he tucks away his little passenger in his hood and charges. It seem as if the flames knew of his presence, and shot out at him. He narrowly dodges them. Slicing them with his blade, which seem to do little effect. If not for his training than he surely would have been gone. For a quick second he catches his breath, before dodging another stream of Hellfire. Though he was quick, he wasn't quick enough and another came at him from his blind side. Knocking him back violently. Crashing into building. He takes a few seconds to pick himself back up. The smell of sizzling of his cape being a bit on fire, which he puts out. Getting back up, he wasn't going to give up that easily. If having learned anything with being with the Teen Titans, is you don't leave a member behind or let them suffer. One does all they can to ensure their teammate safety. Yes, that's what he learned. But this was different. This was than just a teammate, to him. To him, it went much more deeper. Something he couldn't explain really, but he knew he couldn't lose. Looking at his blade, then back to the flames, realizing his hostile nature just seconds to late. Another stream of fire shoots at him. There was no time to dodge this time, he had to brace for impact and maybe even death. A stream of green light shoots out stopping the flames from reaching, the two explode, at the same time something comes and gets him out the way just in time. Feeling someone carrying him for a second. They stop and place him down, he turns around to find to his surprise the team and Nightwing there. Starfire drops down.\"Robin? Are you alright?\" His well being wasn't on his mind, he turns back around at the vortex. The others look too, Gar and Jaime mouths just drop at the sight of it.\"D-Dude...\"Gar said in shock. Pointing at it. \"She's lost.\"Raven steps forward, with her hand out. Feeling the emotions emitting from her sister's wild flames.\"She's confused. She's in pain. I knew it.\" \"Knew it?\"Nightwing looks at her.\"I thought you said, you fixed her? Why is she in pain? I thought his influ-\" \"I know what I said.\"she cuts him off, concealing her own frustration.\"No matter what, his influence will always remain.\"she touches the red crystal shard in the center of her forehead.\"...\" \"Is there a way to get to her? To snap her back?\"Starfire fires at a stream of fire headed their way, with Blue Beetles help. To buy them more time, Raven covers everyone in a large dome shield. Which managed to keep the fire back.\"We reached her before.\"Blue states.\"We can do it again, right?\" \"Back in Hell it was different.\"Raven tells him.\"She's losing all sense of reality. Her own fears themselves are being turned against her. She doesn't know what to do. When someone's lost they don't know what to do. Violet's life has been one of unknowing and being used. To fill the emptiness that's been in her since the start. Trigon used that against her. Twisted her and now that the damage has been done...She's been calling out for help. She needs reassurance. A lost soul is a dangerous soul.\" \"So...\"Cyborg says.\"What do we do? Because...\"he looks back at the wild flames.\"It's not getting any better, and from my scanners her body can't take much of this anymore. She's going to burn herself out.\" \"Ahhh!\"Gar screams, looking frightful at what seem to be dark spirits being drawn to the vortex. Pointing a confused and trembling finger.\"What the heck?!\" \"Whoa!\"Blue.\"What are those?\" Raven studies the dark ghostly spirits.\"Remember what I said before, about her powers? She can feel negative emotions deeper than anyone, which in turn draws them to her. And this place is filled with them. She's like their magnet or lighting rod. She can already absorb them. But, she can only take so much.\" Having enough of this going around talk, Nightwing demands she gets to the bottom of it.\"I'm not hearing any sort of ideas on how to get her back.\" Hearing the sound of a blade being sheathed, everyone looks to Robin who told them with his eyes he knew what to do. Stepping forward, his eyes focused on the growing vortex.\"Robin?\"Starfire looks at him, trying figure out his plan. Raven figured it out. She puts down her shield.\"You've got one shot at this.\"she tells him. Their hidden plan left the others out. Though Jaime seem to catch on, getting his shield ready.\"You better say, your sorry.\"he tells Robin sternly. And charges straight to be struck with a wave of fire, he stands his ground pushing back. The flames where strong, very strong. But he didn't cave in. He wasn't going to. With Blue taking some of the attention of the flames, Robin sprints off with Raven following. The others stood there lost, watching the three charge head first. Wishing they would have told them their plan, they rush into the provide them with back up. Attack the flames. Raven and Robin dodge a few of the flames. Using her powers, she outline Damian in her energy protectively. And launches him forward, at the same time he calms down and clears his mind. The walls of the flames, sensing nothing hostile opens up allowing him in. He lands down fine, still remaining outlined in Raven's energy. Even as the updrift winds pick him up. Catching himself, he manages to remain somewhat steady. Taking a ride on chuck of concrete, his eyes look desperately for any sign of her. Memories of her, Violet flash in his mind. When she first meet him, greeting him. Their shared breakfast. Her attempt to take away his pain. The adventure to Wayne Enterprise. Their life in the Himalayas. Everything. Nearly loosing his balance, he refocuses. Dodging debris coming his way. Climbing upward to the center. Reaching for something precious, never felt so hard. Whimpers. Whimpers he could hear them. Sad and lost whimpers. They belonged to her. Something glisten out the corner of his eye, looking he noticed floating there...a tear. \"Damian. Damian!\" \"Damian? Come on Damian.\" He heard his name being said by her voice, all around him. He knew it well. Each time she said his name, there was a meaning behind it. Which he at first detest, but it did grow on him. And soon became, now realizing it, special. Pushing off the concrete he was on, to the next large object a lid of a car. So focused on the task at hand, he didn't see the stop sign flung his way until to late. Dodging it quickly, to lose his balance. Damn. He looks up watching them become further away. Thinking quickly he reaches for his grappling hook, when someone or something comes behind him and launches him back up. Turning and looking down he sees Nightwing. Coated in Raven's energy too, locking eyes with Damian. Understanding. Giving a promising and gratitude nod, Robin focus back. This time making sure nothing would stop him from going. Flipping and dodging. Twisting and ducking. Deflecting. Itching to draw out his blade, but resist. He's done enough damage to her already. Those words he said still left a bitter taste in his mouth. Needing to get closer, he reaches into his hood and takes out... \"Get me close.\"he tells Richie. The little robin stretches its wings looking at the pre-teen. Seemingly understand. With its wingspan out, the little one began to grow from the amount of negative energy it absorbed. Pushing off the item he was on and onto Richie. Gripping tightly onto the feathers on its back. The small robin now large, lets out a screech and tucks its wings flying upward. Robin held on tightly. Refusing to let go. Getting closer, he slowly starts to stand. Richie flies straight out of the vortex, turning around with Robin standing on its back. Looking into the eye of the storm. At what hoovered in the center, afraid. Getting a running start, he jumps off Richie's head and down back into the vortex. His hand outreached towards, what he wished not lose. Stretching it far, not caring he was over extending his arm. It was just like before, back with the Man-Bats. He had tired to get her, when she fell. He jumped after her, just the same as he was doing now. Back then, he couldn't get her. And lost her. This time though. This time would be different. All the times she came after him, offering him something, he was too blind to see. Until he lost to the clutches of her father. To the darkness. A darkness she tired so hard to bring out of. He was wrong. He was very wrong. With everything he said about her. Those words he wish to take back. She wasn't weak. She wasn't a lost puppy. She wasn't any of those things. If anything, he was. The decisions she made, to better herself. It took courage to do that. To step out on faith and land on your feet. Faith. Her faith was stronger than her fear. Had she not realized that? She had to have faith, she was wanted. Faith she belonged. Because he did, he had faith. With him at least. Mustering up that emotion he yells for you.\"Violet!\" \"Violet!\" Your eyes shoot open, upon hearing that voice. That called you by a name. It broke through everything, even as it became fainter, reaching you. You heard it. Your hand shoots up in the direction of the voice, dangling there for it to be grabbed. Nothing came. You felt nothing. Was this another lie? Bringing your hand back down, something strong and unbreakable grabs it tightly. With every ounce of their strength, squeezing it securely. You felt this strange surge shoot through you. It felt strange yet familiar. Who was it? Your mind and soul began to search for any sort of relocation of it. Unable to find it, which was okay, because you knew it wasn't here to hurt you. It was pulling you back. Back to your senses. Out of the dark. Reminding you of everything. Helping you push through your struggling lost and wondering mind and soul. Outside the vortex with the others, they stop fighting against it. Noticing a change in it. It started to settle. And die down. Still, that didn't mean they could let their guard down. Quickly Raven puts up a shield covering everyone just as the vortex explodes. Everyone covered their eyes from it. Opening them, they find the vortex gone, but the surrounding area badly damage. \"Violet!\"Gar remembers, taking off. But Raven beats him to it. Hurrying to the center of it all, she finds Nightwing there, with just a few injuries but nothing major. Moving some of the debris out the way with powers, she and others find buried... In the darkness yet again, but this time you didn't feel yourself falling down. And this time when you open your eyes, you saw light. The sun. The blue skies. White clouds, crystal water of the coast. The smell of the sea water. The sound of the seagulls. Everything. No longer nothingness. Actual life before you. A pleasant sight, one who lost in darkness would be thrilled to see. Yet, you still could not be. No matter how hard you tired. Your sins forced your guilt to remind you. To keep you prisoner. Always your eyes lamented over and over about it all. You felt less human still. Was anything cured in you? It was hard for you to know. Even after all they had done to bring you out of that darken state. The thought of you belonging here with the Teen Titans. To call this place a home. A family. Can or could one call a place a home? And others a family? When they themselves didn't have one themselves? These questions lingered in your mind and influenced you, it would be best to leave. Yeah, it would be. You needed to find something to fill up this gaping void. Fixing and straightening your bed, in your room. You look around at it. The place that was your temporary home for the time being. Just like the Greyson family, Haley Circus. Wayne Manor. League of Assassins mansion. Himalayas. Gotham. The park. Hell. Double checking your bag, making sure you had everything. After you recovery, after everyone saved you and brought you back here. Allowed you to see again. You just decided it was best for you leave. You didn't belong here, no matter how much you enjoyed it. This place wasn't your home. They weren't your family. You didn't even know you family. Not even your parents. Well, just one. Trigon. Leaving you half complete. You where nothing but a danger to the others. Now that you knew what your powers could do. It would be best for you to leave. Zipping up your pack, you look out the window, the sun was setting. The others left you alone so you could just relax. Starfire telling you whenever you felt ready to come back. Throwing your hood over you, to conceal yourself, you leave your room. Checking down the hall, to make sure the others weren't around. And slip out. All those years of training with Dick and Bruce, as well with Damian. Stealth became your best friend right now. Carefully you made sure to keep your senses up and alert. You hadn't sense any of their emotions, negative ones yet. Meaning it was all clear. Taking the elevator was way to easy and would give you away. So it was either going out the front door or using the roof. The latter which you choose. Making it to the top of the Tower, you look and see no one. Good. It was clear. With your pack secured, you walk towards the edge and look down at the long drop. The coastal winds blew through your hair and hood. It felt so nice and refreshing. You were going to miss it here. Calming yourself, you've only done this once. But seeing it shouldn't be so hard, except to fully focus. No doubt it was going to be painful. The burning feeling between your shoulder blades began to take form. Flamed Hellfire wings spring from your back, you do your best to hold in your pain. Sucking it up. Blocking out the pain, you take off when something quick and fast flies up nearly hitting you. Scaring you and nearly taking you by surprise. Causes you to crash back to the ground. Flying was something you really needed to work on. Once you hit the ground, some sort of dark energy wraps itself around you. Luckily you move out the way just in time before it completely had its hold. That was just strange. Getting up, you look at the energy and realize who it belongs too.\"Violet.\"Starfire gets your attention, you look up surprised to find her there a few feet from you. She was the one who nearly hit you. She looks at you sternly, yet sympathetic. Feeling she wasn't the only one, which you where right. Coming behind you using their jetpack to suspend them. Cyborg. And using a portal, Raven appears a few feet in front of you. Noticing the reflection in her eyes, you turn around to find Blue, Gar, Nightwing and Damian. All of them cornering you. Looking at you rather hurt and confused. \"Hermona...\"Blue starts.\"What do you think you're doing?\" You remain silent. Giving him the cold shoulder.\"Vi? Say something?\"Gar tries to plead with you to speak. But you wouldn't budge.\"Why are you leaving? This is your home.\" \"Yeah.\"Cyborg lands down but still remained ready to take off should you try to leave.\"Why you leaving your hom-\" \"This isn't my HOME!\"you lash out at him, turning around to him with burning anger. Baring your fangs.\"This isn't my home. None of it is. None never...I'm leaving.\"You suddenly become hard. Glaring at each of them. Your eyes lock with Dick the longest. Who was visible hurt behind his mask. Making you look away in shame.\"What do you mean this isn't your home?\"Starfire questions, with a tone of a explanation.\"Violet? Why would you say that? You're apart of this team. This family.\" \"I have no family.\"you turn away from her, giving everyone the cold shoulder. Trying so hard to shut them out. To shut out the horrible things you caused to them. Trying to suppress your guilt. Struggling only made it worse. Hellfire started to surround your clench fist. Which you hold close to you in fear.\"I-I don't belong here...with one...None of you.\"you force yourself to say coldly.\"I-I just want to leave. Get away from here. Live alone. So allow me to leave. I won't cause anymore trouble. Or issues...things will be better.\" \"That makes no sense.\"Nightwing finally speaks up, moving closer. Stopping when you warn him too.\"Violet. Violet Greyson.\"he calls you by your full name.\"...You are my sunshine, my only make me happy when skies are grey. You never know, dear, how much I love you. Please don't take my sunshine away. That was the very first song I sung to you, when you were little. It always made you smile. Even after all those years, when I found you again. Violet,\"he takes off his mask. Looking at you softly.\"I can't stand here and say I don't understand what you're going through. But, for you say you want to leave. Not to be a bother. That's not true at all. You're the only sunshine I have left of our family. What you went through...\" Raven takes over from him. Stepping towards you. She takes her hood down, looking you sympathetically.\"No one holds you responsible for what you did. At least I don't. Wanting that feeling of being complete, I know that all too well. You're whole life you've been used and left to wonder. You don't know who you are. Trigon plays on our insecurities. No matter what he promises, it always ends with pain. It feels hopeless to escape. You want that part of you gone after finding out about it. You want to run away from it, in hopes it would fade in the back. But, in truth...it doesn't. Running away only makes it worse.\"You look at her meekly and broken.\"Being broken is easy. What makes it hard is trying to fix it. Those thoughts of what you did won't go away. You don't need to feel alone, because you feel incomplete. You claim you don't have a family. But, that's far from the truth. You and I may feel we don't belong. Isolated. All of this is new and confusing to you. I might not know much about your other half, but I know about the half we share.\"she steps closer, holding out a hand.\"Separate we're not strong. But together we are. We can't let his influence control us. No matter how much it wants too. You're my little sister. If I can make this my new home and family. You can too. I'll do whatever it takes to make this our home. We're the only family either of us has in this world. On this Earth. Besides the others.\"She looks at the team. Her eyes fall back to you.\"I'm offering to teach you. To help guide you.\" \"...\"you look at her hand unsure. Thinking of everything you've done. Guilt began to blind you. When you felt Nightwing's hand on your shoulder, you turn around to him shocked and unsure. Doubtful. Contemplating. He gives you a assuring smile. Feeling another hand on your shoulder, you find Starfire. Smiling at you, nodding her head. Cyborg comes in after, with Blue and Gar. Who tires to be flirty with you. \"Did I ever tell you, I have a thing for girls with pointy ears?\"he winks at you, earning an elbow from Blue who gives him a scolding hush. \"We're all misfits in a manner of speaking.\"Blue tells you.\"It won't be the same without you Hermona.\" Nightwing gets down to your level. Looking you directly in your eyes. Smiling.\"...\" Looking at everyone around you, supporting you. Tears started to form, you shut your eyes to stop them. But they came. All the anguish. All the guilt. Everything. Your hurt. Pain. Confusion. But through it all, you managed a small smile. Turning back to Raven, she still had her hand extended for you. Looking at it, then her. You reach for it.[Chapter 24] Dang. You where late. Hoping they wouldn't be upset, you were up pretty late last night. Not because of any missions, no. You just where very indulge in the book you were reading. Well in a sense assigned. Given to you by someone very important now in your life. Who understood your pain well. In shadows protected you, before making themselves known. Assured you things would be alright, the two of you where in this together. Taking you under their wing, no pun intended, to help you with your newly arise demonic powers. That where inherited and unlocked by the one who fathered you. Powers and abilities you feared. Which was something you had to get under control. Fear had a way of manifesting itself into something else. Which caused you become reclusive and hesitant to using them, but with their help you started to overcome it. Still, you where a long way from mastering complete control. As they told you, \"We are beings split between two worlds. We have to find peace a sort of balance if we can.\" Those words etched in your mind, all time. It was true, being what you are the luxury to experience anything normal seem gone. In so many ways. Control was always the key, letting a little out here and there was still dangerous. Which was meditation was very important, to clear the mind, keep the balance and control. Morning, noon and night. You would meditate, most of the time with them. Though sometimes just by yourself. These powers, what a curse. A curse that can be used for good and help others. It would just take time to accept it was part of you, the same with your appearance too. Which you still seem to have issues with. You did miss your black hair, the white was just working for you. Having tired to dye it before, which failed. The markings on your body, there was just no way for you to hide or conceal them. Nor your ears and teeth. Which caused you most of the time to rarely talk or do a full smile. You felt rather insecure about your appearance. Especially when you went outside, in the world. You kept yourself covered up, but it still didn't seem to work. If by accident you where exposed, stares came and mumbles. What made it worse was the fact, you could feel their rising negative emotions. Giving you and insight deeper than you would like. That you would take off and leave. You then just preferred to stay at home, at least you weren't looked at differently. Sure you would still go on missions, but when it came to outings you, stayed home. The only time you would leave, was to watch the waves by the rocks or sit on the roof watching the water. Even to just fly around, which you at times didn't like to do. Having Hellfire wings sprout from your shoulder blades always left a rather painful aftermath. Which you slightly became use too. The pain only lasted for a few seconds whenever you sprouted them or made them vanish. Staying back at the Tower, you didn't seem to mind, even if you became rather withdrawn. You still enjoyed your time with them back at the Tower. It was just going to take time. The others knew you still where rather fragile and getting things back to \"normal\". Just trying to find yourself, that's all. Searching your mind, soul and heart every day. If they others could not find in your room, most of the time you would be sitting on the roof of the Tower. Just in deep thought, or in another quiet place. Raven sat waiting for someone. The one she's been waiting for was late. She could sense them hurrying to up. No doubt, they over slept because they stayed up late again reading. Which was alright, she never was bothered by it, all this was new to them. All of it. So it was only natural they would want to learn everything they could about this new chapter in their life. And Raven having taken them as her student, though of course it was their choice. And she was happy they took it. In fact decided to stay. Raven understood them more than they knew, the feeling of wanting to be alone because of what one was. Fear of themselves. A feeling that took a strong hold, should one allow it. Angry and confused about their existence. \"Raven. Raven!\" Hearing her name along with running footstep approaching closer. Getting Raven turns around to see her student and younger half sister. You. Violet Greyson. The other daughter and child of demon Trigon. Who just like Raven inherited some of his demonic powers. The main both she and you shared, was empathy. Though unlike her's in which she can sense emotions across the spectrum, her younger sister only had one side of the spectrum. Negative emotions. Which never turned off, she was always feeling them, and when or if she made physical contact. Since what happened to her, it was more amplified. Her sister managed to learn some control over it. With Raven's teaching and guidance her sister slowly began to take better hold of her demonic powers and nature. Which was good. The only downside was her sister had started to become less social. Withdrawn. Isolated. Though not so much among the team, but with the world. Something Raven felt and knew needed to change. Her eyes follow her sister approaching closer, dressed in her hero attire. Which she changed up a bit: Bell sleeve long gypsy gothic fitted maroon tunic mid-thigh dress with a dark corset lacing in the front. The back cut out for her wings, she traded out her leather pants no longer wearing them. Her footwear dark corset flat knee high boots. Under sleeves she wore dark laced glovelettes with her attire, even outside her hero outfit. You inhale deeply apologizing to Raven.\"I'm so sorry.\"you tell her, catching your breath.\"I d-didn't mean to keep you waiting.\"Raven just waited for you catch your breath. She wasn't bothered. It took you about a minute before you breathing return back to normal. It was then you realized something, she wasn't in her hero attire, instead more so in casual clothes. This was rather confusing. \"Umm...Raven? Why aren't you in your...\"you point to yourself then to her. She didn't answer, instead forms a portal and walks through.\"This is part of your training. Come.\" Not sure what this training was leading to, you follow her through the portal. To find two things. One, your attire had changed to your casual wear. A gypsy tribal style dark purple bohemia skirt with deep red patterns, dark blue chiffon long sleeve blouse off shoulder smocked stretch waist top and simple brown flats. With a tribal scarf you wore to try and conceal your lower part of your face. This was what you wore mainly when off duty. Back in the Tower and use to when you had gone outside. Which was the second thing, Raven had made a portal to take you outside in the center of the city. A place you would rather not be, fear and anxiety started to take hold. Raven of course sensing it, tells you to calm down. Not understanding her reasoning. You ask for to explain.\"Raven? Why did you...You know I don't being out in the public. Unless-Unless needed. I want to go ba-\"you turn heal ready to go but she stops you. Grabbing you by the wrist. \"Like I said.\"she repeats.\"This is part of your training.\" \"My training?\"you where a bit lost.\"My training consist of learning how to control my powers. Hours on meditation and tranquility. Finding a balance. Suppress my...This isn't training!\"You snipe upset.\"I want to go back. I-You know I can't be out here.\"Looking around the people around, moving away from them if they got to close. Even with you moving, you could feel the negative emotions from them starting to find their way to you. Seeing them coming at you like haunting spirits. Ready to fight back, if not for Raven she takes hold of your wrist, bring your attention to her. The look she had told you, to calm down and she wasn't going to rethink what she did. Either you snap out of it or else. Trying hard to relax yourself, it was just hard. The emotions just came at you. You could feel them crawling on your skin, making you shiver. Trying hard to keep your fire under control. It was ready to burst out and if that happened...Just knowing what would or will happen should you stay any longer, you try to get your wrist back from Raven. Which surprisingly her grip was rather strong. You and her stare at one another. \"You've have to learn how to keep your cool, and control in everyday situations.\"she said.\"This will help. Hiding away doesn't do anything. I've told you before, you can't let fear take hold of you, find a balance.\" Understanding her words, you still wanted to go back to the Tower. At least, there you would be safe. Away from all of this. But Raven wasn't going to let you go. Despite your pleas. Back at the Tower, the others where relaxing. Gar and Jaime going at it again with playing DDR, Damian watching rather board awaiting his turn. They clearly had not skills compared his own, yet he still didn't mind joining their little attempts of trying to best the other. A rather trivial effort, he would often say. Neither of them could beat his high score. Still it was entertaining to watch. Especially Gar, watching him fail was quite a delight. Still, he was rather surprise Gar was actually doing fairly well. He was better than Jaime, but this time Damian noticed a bit more pep in his footwork. Adding a bit more flare as it was called. Looking at the score board, he was clearly leaving Jaime in the dust more than usual. This caught Damian's attention just a bit. Just a few more seconds to go and...The winner Gar, again. \"YES!\"Gar enthusiastically yells.\"And victor...ME.\"he points to himself with the hugest smile on. He started to do a victory dance.\"Who's bad? Me. That's who!\" Jaime rolls his eyes at his over thrilled friend.\"Okay. So you beat me. Nothing new. I was rather close...\"he turns to look at the score board, to be wrong. The gap in points was rather huge. He had to do a double take.\"Dude!\"he points it out, then thumbs over to Damian.\"You're close to Boy Wonder over there.\" Gar looks at his score reading it, he turns around to Damian flashing him a cocky smile.\"Guess I am. I mean why wouldn't I be?\"He shrugs his shoulders like it was nothing.\"I'm feeling real good. About time that bird gets knocked off his perch.\" Reading the challenge behind his words. Damian accepts and steps up to the plate. Taking Jaime spot, who takes Damian on the coach. Looking at the two give the other one a competitive stares. \"Before we start.\"Gar said with a sly smile.\"Why don't we make this interesting.\" This peaked Damian's interest though he hid it well.\"I don't believe you losing will make it interesting.\" Earning an \"Oh Snap.\" From Jaime, who didn't hide his laughter. Gar growls lowly at the snide remark from Damian who clearly took delight in what he said. Smiling cockily at the green teen, for it to drop seeing something in his eyes. Which ignited a flame behind his stale green eyes. Allowing Gar to take back control again. \"See I've been practicing night and day for the past two months and well...\"he winks at Damian.\"I think I can beat you. So about that deal, I beat you I call dibs on Violet. Yeah. Thought you'd be interested. I get to take her out for a week, no make that two weeks. And you can't intervene, and have to leave us alone. But if you win, than it's a free for all. I think that's rather fair. Don't you?\" Jaime nearly spits out his drink upon hearing what Gar just said.\"Gar!? Seriously? Your beating on, Vi? What's wrong with you? You and I know, no, we all know she's...NO. No this is stupid. What you're saying is just...Seriously?\" Gar though paid no mind to his friend's protest.\"It's just a little beat, that's all.\"Gar defends himself.\"I mean, the two of you are just friends right? If you are, we can totally call this off. And you won't mind me taking her out anyway.\" He pressures Damian. Putting him on the spot, awaiting his answer. All with a smug grin on his face, to which Damian clearly wanted to smack away, but kept his cool. But his eyes furrowed at Gar. This was the only way he could keep his cool. Even if his fist was itching to rip that grin off his face. Jaime could feel the heated tension building between the two, mainly when it came to Raven's sister. It was clear as day Gar had a liking to her, even before finding out she was related to Raven and a half demon too. The day she came to the Tower, he didn't hide it. Though of course Violet never seem to notice or just choose not too. Gar often tired to make as moves as he could on her, only for them rise when Damian came into the picture. He felt an instant threat with the boy being there. It was clear he and Violet shared a close relationship, well at least back then. Now it was uncertain. It was hard to read Damian, except for that one night, when they all went after her, after her powers went haywire. He was the only besides Nightwing who managed to get to her and allowed inside her Hellish Hellfire vortex, and not forget how the others found them. After that, there wasn't really that much interaction between them. Jaime assumed that Damian must still be feeling guilty that he might have been the one cause all of what happened to Violet. He often acted cordial with her, which she didn't mind. Her mind was more focus on her new training. And getting better control of her powers, but mainly on trying to figure herself out still. The way the two acted, caused distance between them. Just seeing the other as a teammate. A few times during training, Jaime would see her struggle and once he caught Damian looking concerned. Tempted to help her, but refused to offer it. And once caught him either watching or spying on her walking down the hall alone. Which of course he had some idiotic reason behind it. If not for his fancy words and wording many would believe him. But Jaime in a way began to figure them out. He didn't though overstep his boundaries unless it was necessary. Like right now, with Gar's stupid beat. Did this green idiot not realize what he was doing? By the look on his face, he didn't seem to care one bit. Waiting for Damian to respond at least, which all he said was... \"You run mouth to much.\"he starts the game.\"Let's hope it's as quick as your feet.\" No clear answer came from Damian leaving not just Gar puzzled but Jaime as well. He couldn't really understand what boy just said. All he knew was that Damian meant business. With the game starting, Gar and Damian begin. With you and Raven, you had no choice but to give in. Expecting her to just throw you in, for either sink of swim. Instead she took you to a rather quiet and humble coffee shop. Without the hustle and bustle. It was rather mellow, with very little negative emotions floating about and trying to attach themselves to you. Giving you in a sense, some peace. Sitting across the small circular table with Raven on the other end. With you cup of, Earl Gray tea. A favorite of yours, the same with Alfred. He had introduced it to you when you use to live at Wayne Manor. It was a strange tea, but you grew to enjoy it. It was very relaxing for you. Raven had herbal tea. The setting of the place was rather nice and calm. With slight dim lights and rustic look about it. Clearly some would think this was a place for either Hippies or Goths, even Tree Huggers. But it seem far from it. You actually felt yourself enjoying the place. It felt harmonic and serene, almost heavenly. Befitting for the name of the place: Heaven's Cup. You could get use to a place like this. Everyone just seem to relaxed and at peace. Maybe coming back outside, to places like this wasn't so bad. Still you where rather shy and withdrawn. \"Relax.\"Raven tells you, you look up from your cup at her. She was reading a book casually.\"...Oh...Sorry.\"you apologize.\"This place, it seems so nice.\" Raven turns a page on the book she had.\"Yes. It is. This is perfect for you to ease yourself back into the world. I know because of what we are and our powers it seems easy to just hide away. But what good would that do? We always have to push pass whatever it is that holding us back. Otherwise we give into it. So just relax and focus on your center.\" She wasn't kidding, this was really part of your training. Looking around, there was just so little negativity you felt no need. But then again...Closing your eyes you do your best to keep your center. Over at the counter a pair a slightly light violet colored matured eyes focus on you, you and Raven. Rather delighted.\"Hello...\" In case any of you want to know I just though of doing a few chapters about May's well background a bit more. Seeing how only half of her lineage is known and past. Thought you would like to know the rest. Hope that is okay.[Chapter 25] It was a cold winter night, the coldest in many years. It was also the day of Eclipse, a man and woman decided to take a stroll through the park that very evening. Bundled up to keep warm, enjoying their stroll when sound of an a infant's cries pierced the chill air. It nearly startled them, until they realized what the noise was. Rather close. The cries drew them to the infant. A small little one, hidden or placed under a park bench. Bundled up. The poor little thing kept crying and crying, from the look of it the infant had to at least a few days old. Who in the world would leave a little one like this? All alone with no one around? What a cruel thing, quickly thinking the pick up it up and cradle them. Keeping them close to stay warm. Their poor little fingertips a bit blue from the cold. And its nose a bit blue too. Looking around for any sign of anyone. They saw no one. The little thing couldn't be left here, it would surely die. Thinking nothing of it, the couple bundle the little one a bit more and at that moment make decision to keep the infant. All the while, hidden in the shadows observing eyes watch the couple walk off with the infant. Unaware. \"Together.\"Raven tells you, her palms pressed with yours.\"Relax.\"She tells you. You though who was nervous nod and focus to calm your jitters. You had to keep your mind focus in order to do this. Raven hadn't started, she could sense how nervous and scared you were. So she waited patiently. The two of you sitting in the center of the training room. The other members weren't present. Starfire had given Raven permission to have time with you when it came to practice with your powers. Though that didn't mean you weren't excluded from group practice. Just with Raven teaching you to understand you demon side more, there needed to be concentration. Slowing your breathing, you search for something to focus on. Finding it.\"Okay. I'm ready.\"you tell her. \"Alright then. Visualize. Visualize.\"she said. Stressing it to you, yet remain calm. \"...Right.\"you said. Slowly your fire began to surround you as Raven's energy did the same. The two of you begin to levitate a few inches off the floor. This part wasn't hard. You open your eyes and Raven does the same, neither of you had pupils. Eyes glowing pure white. Remembering your training back in the mountains. \"Keep your mind clear.\"Raven tells you.\"Find my voice. Visualize me, find my voice.\" \"Raven?\" \"Hm? What is it?\" \"...\" She sighs.\"If you complete this, we'll go to the cafe again. Focus though.\" You smile.\"Okay. Thank you, Raven.\" Jaime strolled down the hall, minding his own business heading towards the training room. When Gar jumps out in front of him, nearly startling him, his scarab reacted almost shooting the green teen. Luckily Gar transformed into a fly to avoid the blast. \"Ga-Dude! What's you problem jumping out like that?!\"Jaime yells at him. Putting his blaster away.\"I could have-\" \"Okay. Yeah. Sorry.\"Gar discards his friend.\"Look I need your help in getting Violet to go out with me.\" Jaime arches an eyebrow, shaking his head.\"I'm not going to help you. You know as well I do, she's more focused on her powers. Plus, Raven will kill you.\"He walks around him. Gar joins him back in his human form. \"Which is where you come in. I need you to pry Raven away from Violet for a bit,\"Gar begins to plan, trying to wrap Jaime into it.\"That way I can make my move with Violet. She and Raven are always going off, every time I try to get to her. So, I thought you could just you know...\"He elbows Jaime who wanted no part in it. \"No.\"He flatly tells him. \"Aw! Come on man!\"Gar whines a bit.\"Help a brother out.\" \"I am.\" The scarab covers Jaime in his armor.\"Just leave her alone and let her be.\"He slightly warns Gar who over looked it. \"Okay, look I get it.\"He begins to admit.\"She's learning to control her demon powers, which she had being doing for sometime. It's a good thing. But do we seriously need another Raven?\"Realizing what he said and how it came out. Jaime shoots him a sharp look.\"I didn't mean it like that. I mean just because their sisters. What I meant was...I mean Violet is clearly different from Raven. In some aspects. I mean they both are demons. Well half demons. Their father really doesn't wa-AH!\" He freaks jumping out the way of blade by his throat. Turning into a cat, looking up to find Damian in his Robin attire. Ready for practice. The two of them glare hard at the other one. Gar hisses at him, to give a half smirk. \"Oh boy.\"Jaime groans looking at the two. He could feel their heated glares making him rather uncomfortable. Gar transform back into his human form, still carrying his cocky smirk.\"...\" \"I'd advise you to watch how you formulate your words.\"Damian said with a threatening undertone.\"Or is that a trick you still need to learn?\" Knowing he was insulting him. Gar gets ready for a combat when Starfire comes over.\"Wonderful.\"She greets them, stopping their feud.\"You're here. We can get started. Raven and Violet should be nearly done. Um? Is everything okay?\"she notices the tension between Gar and Damian, looking to Jaime who gives her a rather annoyed look. She eventually understood and was about to say something, when the doors open.\"I did it Raven. Let's go to the ca-\"you dash out nearly running into the others.\"Excuse me.\"You calm down and apologize. Squeezing by them. Raven comes out a few seconds after you.\"I'm assuming it went well?\"Starfire said to her. The teen looks at her nodding her head.\"Are the two of you heading to the cafe?\" \"Yes.\"Raven said.\"I promised her. Her progress is growing well.\"Raven praises you, making you smiling bashfully. \"Alright Hermana.\"Jaime praises you too. Ruffling your hair.\"You're getting better.\" \"T-Thank you.\"you smile sheepishly looking away.\"Anyway, Raven can we hurry up now and go to the cafe?\" Normally, Raven was known for sticking to herself, but with you in the picture her ice exterior seem to melt. And she was more like to bend when it came to you of course. She gets ready to answer, only for Starfire to.\"Oh, Violet I forgot to mention, Dick is waiting for you. Remember today?\" Nearly you almost forgot. You and Dick's day to webcam each other, since you first came to live here with the Titans. You and Dick set time out to webcam with one another a couple of times out of the month. Though since what happened with you and your training with Raven you hadn't been able to webcam as much as you use to. Starfire was the one who set it up this time, she had mention it to you last week and the other day. How could you forget? Normally you were really good with things like this. Feeling bad about it, Starfire assures you it was alright. \"He's on right now.\"She tells you, pointing down the hall.\"Afterwards you and Raven can go to the cafe.\" \"Thank you.\"you nod your head and sprint off. The others watch you. Little by little it seem like a bit of your old self was slowly resurfacing. Which was a good thing. \"Gar.\"Raven calls to him. He turns to her, her focus was still on the way her sister ran.\"Leave her alone.\"She warns him with slight snarl, flashing a threatening look in his direction. Nearly scaring him out of his skin.\"I mean it.\" Her eyes then quickly slide to Damian, sending him the same message in a sense. Which he slightly took rather offensive. Warning the two of them, she leaves. \"See.\"Jaime pats his friend solemnly.\"Leave it alone.\" Arriving to Starfire's room, her laptop was up and Dick was on the screen waiting for you. Greeting him the second you came in and took your seat. \"Cousin!\"you smile to him. He smiles back.\"Hey Violet. I was starting to wonder if you had time for me?\"He jokes. \"Sorry, I didn't mean to make you wait.\"you apologize.\"This session with Raven went a bit longer than I assumed.\" \"That's fine. How is going by the way? Are you gaining better control?\" Nodding your head yes.\"Yes. Well sort of...kind of really. I'm setting things on fire, so I guess that is considered progress.\" \"That is good. Have been able to do anything new yet?\" Thinking about it, you kind of nod.\"Well, in some sense really. I can control the size of my fire wings. Umm...Hurl fireballs. Absorb it back inside. Infuse it with something, like a weapon if I choose. Raven is helping me learn mystic properties with the flames. I can kind of block out feeding, I mean absorbing others negative emotions. It is a strain really, but, it's worth it. I just have to remain focus, very focus. Oh a plus side Raven wants me to learn about her way. Her teachings she learned through Azarath. She even gave me this,\"you point the dark maroon chocker that had a piece of the crystal in which Trigon was now imprisoned, in the center of the choker.\"Of course she has the task to watch over our father...But not to worry, this is to help me focus with me demonic side.\" Dick leans in closer, his eyes carefully observing your jewelry.\"It's rather nice. So my necklace has been replaced?\" \"What?! No..I haven't replaced it.\"you shriek. He just laughs. \"I'm joking. It's alright.\"he tells you.\"I'm glad things are getting better for you and you're gaining better control over you powers. It seems like this is the right fit for you. Anyway I was wondering something? Well a couple of things, actually.\" You give him your full attention ready to hear.\"What is it?\" \"Well one, it's been sometime since we've hung out. How about we spend a day together?\"he asked.\"Also Bruce is throwing a special fundraiser, and I wanted to know if you would like to come? As my special lady?\"You couldn't help but giggle at him trying to playfully flirtatious with you. He shares the chuckles with you.\"Also would you like to do a night patrol with me?\" Your tail begin to wag happily.\"Sure. All of that sounds really great. I would love to spend time with you!\"you exclaim.\"Is going to be at the manor?\" He shakes his head.\"No. Somewhere much more special.\" \"Where?\" \"It's a surprise. But great, I should be there in a few minutes.\" Figuring what he meant, he was on his way.\"You're driving aren't you?\"He flashes you a smile. \"Yep.\"He noticed the long face you had.\"What is it?\" \"Oh. It's just well...Raven and I where going to go our favorite cafe. Today. And well...\" Hearing you and understanding.\"Why don't you see if she wants to come? I don't mind.\" \"Seriously!? Yeah, I'll ask he-\" \"It's fine.\"Raven suddenly appears behind you through a portal. You use to get surprised when she did this but not anymore.\"You should spend time with your cousin.\"She tells you.\"We can go together another time.\" Bummed a bit, but she gives you assuring smirk.\"Alright. I'll make sure to bring back your favorite drink. Okay?\" \"You don't have too. But fine.\"Using her powers she changes attire into your normal wear.\"Come on, he's here.\"Next thing the two of you where outside in the front of the tower, the second your cousin pulls up. He steps out dressed in his civilian attire. You waste no time and run over to him, throwing yourself in his arms. He catches you.\"Dick!\" \"Hahaha. Hey Violet.\"he greets you. Then sets you down.\"Alright. Ready to go?\" \"Yes.\"He goes and opens the passenger door for you. Before you enter you run back to Raven about to hug her, but instead bow your head respectfully. She gives you a quick nod. \"Have a good time.\"she tells you. \"...\"smiling at her, you hurry and get in. Dick shuts the door and gets in the driver seat. He gives Raven a two finger salute and drives off. The dark teen stayed until she couldn't see the car anymore and goes back inside. Stopping looking down at a white feather. Looking up noticing a flock of birds flying over head. Sorry for not making any new chapters, and sorry if this chapter isn't as fun. I apologize.[Chapter 26] In a hidden disclose location... \"You IDIOT!\"a angry voice lashes out.\"You nearly got your cover blown!\" \"Thou did not notice my presence, nor did thou sense me in any way. I was concealed. Tis' nothing.\" \"Tis' nothing? Tis' nothing? Are you not mindful?...Of thou isn't.\" \"...Regardless...The witch did not feel nothing. Nothing but. As of the matter of the spawn? Has it been long enough now? Surely the spawn has become ripe now?\" \"...Do not speak such ill words of my blood! You would be mindful to withhold thou tongue! Less it be ripped out.\" \"...Pardon my cruel words...\" \"Your sin is forgiven...I am well aware of my blood's ripeness. It is not time to. For we must wait till the fort of the moon. That wretched sinful demon spawn has their talons buried deeply in my blood. With eyes as demon himself, yet quick of notice. Thy demon spawn is would surely make sure nothing shall befall my blood. That I shall be grateful. Tis' all though.\" \"What is thou move?\" \"That demon spawn is strong. A good breed came from such union.\" \"Aye. It did. It did.\" \"...The moment has not yet to present itself. Patience must be a virtue. When it is time. My blood will be mine. Until, we must present purity and holiness. I did not lay with the lower level for my own accord.\"A shadow figure slowly rises and overlook the life before them. A hand reaches out over and clenches into a fist of power.\"...\" \"Are we there yet?\"you ask Dick, with your blindfold. He told you wear.\"Are we?\" Hearing him chuckle, made you smile.\"We're almost there.\" \"...\"noticing the car slowly beginning to slow down and come to a stop. Hearing Dick open his door and the weight shift on his side. Carefully following his footsteps to your side. Your nose picked up some interesting and familiar scents. It was dirt...wet dirt. No...not wet but it was dirt. There was a burnt...burnt peanut smell...sweet sugary smell. Of cinnamon and sugar mixed together. And the smell of animals...then there came a elephant sound. Rather loud and close, along with a mild roar...a tiger's roar. Squawking of birds...no...a honking noise...jingling sound. Was this...this a... Dick takes off your blindfold.\"Surprise!\"he steps aside helping you out. Your eyes focus and look all around...he took you to a circus. Not just any circus but... Haley's Circus. Your first family. Where his family adopted you into. You stood there shocked and astonished. Overcome with so much, you just didn't know what to say or what to do. Dick smiles seeing your reaction, he notices the small tears beginning to form. Tears that told so much. Looking to cousin still shocked. He simply smiles at you. Resting a hand on your shoulder. \"...Told you it was a surprise.\" \"...I wasn't expecting this...it really is a surprise.\"you admit tearfully.\"Why did you bring me here? Wait?! Are you going to sell me?\" \"What?! No.\"he said, shocked by what you just said. Then realizes you where just joking, the two of you share a good laugh.\"Funny. But no, I didn't bring you here for that. I brought you here because this was our family. Were we use to live. Me, my parents, your parents, and you.\"he lightly pokes your nose.\"I know you don't remember much or anything from here. You didn't get to have the memories I had, so when I saw they where coming back I came by and asked if you could be given that. So many are going to be happy to see you.\"Placing a hand on your back he leads you.\"Come on.\" Back at the Tower Damian was doing his own thing, with Gar and Jaime in the same room. The brooding pre-teen tired his best to block out Gar, as he read. But that didn't happen. It wasn't his annoying voice that broke Damian's concentration, but what came out his mouth that did. Made him pay attention. \"How did you find out? When Violet's birthday was?\"Jaime asked his green friend rather surprised.\"She never said anything.\" \"I have my ways.\"Gar gloats proudly. But, Jaime was able to see straight through it. \"You overheard Starfire didn't you? Dude, I told you to stop list-\" \"Okay fine whatever! I heard...so what's the big deal?\"Gar throws up his hands.\"The main thing is we know and that's good. Because it gives us sometime, to think of what to get her. I mean I know what I'm going to get her.\" \"Being fixed?\"Damian quips. Gar turns around to him. Glaring. Jaime does his best not to laugh, but felt the tension rise with the two. \"No..\"Gar growls lowly. Standing up Damian walks slowly over to him.\"Sad. It would be the best gift. She could use a well trained pet.\" His growl getting deeper, realizing Damian was trying to get to him. Gar calms down and smirks back. Standing up towering over Damian by at least one to two inches. The two glaring at one another.\"And she could use a bird that could fly.\" Damian sneers about to react, if not for Jaime who comes in and breaks them up.\"Okay. Okay. Leave it alone. This is about Violet, not some dominance contest. You guys are taking this out of line.\" \"We''re just joking.\"Gar passively says, smiling.\"...But you're right, it's about Violet. Right Damian?\" Not in the mood for this, Damian turns and leaves.\"Birthdays have no actually meaning. It is only a way for one to feel special and entitled for selfish reasoning.\" \"Dude, rather harsh.\"Jaime said. Shaking his head. \"I wasn't being harsh. I was being real.\"Damian explains.\"But, if you wish to celebrate such an occasion then you are clearly not doing it correctly.\"He turns around to them. \"From what I have researched, my father has thrown ever single of her birthday's with finesse. Far beyond anything either of you will think of. Each of her birthday's have been better than the last. To put it simple for you, for those unable to follow such complex and simple words...\"he quickly looks at Gar.\"Extravagant. Lavishing. You know that means? Right?\"He looks to Gar. Who huffs.\"Yeah. I do.\"Damian waits for him to tell him. Jaime shakes his head sadly.\"Okay. So I don't know what it means! Sue me.\" \"Don't tempt me.\"Damian said with a bit a joy.\"It means rich. High. Maybe for the holidays I might get you a dictionary.\" Jaime comes in again breaking them up.\"Alright. Let's bring it back. So you're saying that she likes big parties?\" \"Yes. From what I've researched.\"Damian says.\"So whatever you have plan for her, I hope it is up to her taste.\"Noticing the nerves look in Gar's eyes, pleased him. Enjoying the power and slight fear in the green teen's eyes. Watching him ponder helplessly on what to do. Smirking to himself Damian leaves. The elephant's trunk tickled, making you laugh. Such a large creature was so gentle. You stroke its trunk tenderly, thanking it for its affection. So this was were you had once lived, your original home. Dick said. Your family, with himself, his parents, your parents, just pretty much everyone apart of Haley's Circus. This was your family, your home. Being here felt,it felt so nostalgic. At first you where rather hesitant to enter, but everyone was so welcoming and greeted Dick with open arms happy to see him. More to your surprise, you found out he owed the circus. Yet, he treated everyone the same. When he introduced you and them who you where. So many faces dropped in shock, a couple of them teared up. Overcome with joy, they welcomed you right away happy to have you back. To return. Hugs and tears came your way, that you where nearly swallowed up by them. You didn't know who everyone was, but it was clear they knew who you where. Despite your outward appearance. They simply said by your eyes, they could tell. The Ring Master allowed you to explore your home as you pleased. Dick stayed with you the whole time, allow you enjoy yourself. Your curiosity did get the better of you. Wowing over what you saw, all the different acts and talents they could do, despite you being able to most of them. It was still amazing, you felt like a five year old clapping with delight seeing it. This experience was much different then that time Bruce had rented a whole circus for you, for your birthday. Sure it was nice and it was the best, you appreciated it a lot. It was just this feeling was different. More emotional. Even the cotton candy tasted different. Your laughter and smile had a different feeling to it. A few of them allowed you try out their talents and act. Which some you did rather easy. Some you messed up, which was alright. When you asked Dick to remind you of the act your 'family' did, he showed you. The Flying Trapeze. It was so high off the ground and was amazing. Even though you've flown higher than that. It was still amazing. Just imagining yourself as part of the act, you would preform with Dick. Your mind conjured up what your life would have been like, Dick would be the one to help you learn how to do the Trapeze, along with the rest of the Flying Greysons. And when you where ready, they would present you with the family uniform. That you would wear so proudly. Your very first night, you would be nervous. Afraid to preform, but with encouragement from Dick and everyone you would go out there to the applauds and cheers from the audience. The safety net of course would be out, just to be safe. Your cousin as your partner, the second you let go of your bar, he would catch you. Not allowing you to fall, telling you to open your eyes. And the two of you standing together smiling, indulged in the applause of everyone and the proud smiles of the family. Yeah, that's what life would have been like. It was so happy and warm. You wouldn't know about anything dark. Things would be normal. Yeah, normal. But, that was just a desire a fantasy. This was reality. Now. It wasn't pretty, but it still had its good moments. And you had to accept it, even if it was hard too. Dick takes you around to see the tiger. The creature was beautiful and strong. Most people would be afraid to be up close to something like this. But, you didn't and excitedly pet it. Nuzzling your face against it. \"You're very cute.\"you coo, scratching under its chin.\"Can I have one for Christmas?\"You joke to Dick. Who shakes his head no.\"I don't think so.\"He scuffs. Coming over petting the big cat.\"I use to take you around all the time during our down time. Even when were an infant, you loved being with the tiger. It always made you smile. Weird. We use to joke saying you would be the next Beast Tamer of the Circus. Breaking our family tradition.\"He laughs. You laugh with him.\"I would never. This place is really magical.\"Turning around looking at everything.\"...This was once my home...I wished it would have lasted. I wonder what life would have been like...\"Sighing. Understanding and sympathizing with you. Dick pulls you in for a side ways hug.\"I know...And I'm sorry.\" It hurt, but you didn't let it effect you much. Accepting there was nothing that could have been done.\"It's alright. It's good to dream though. Thank you, cousin.\"Looking to him, with a soft smile. Leaning your head on him. The two of you spend about another hour there, before leaving. The whole group was sad to see you leave, some even suggesting you come with them so you could have the experience. Which you declined, though promised to visit them next time they came through. After heartfelt good-byes, you and Dick leave. He takes you to get something to eat. Allowing you to choose, so you do. Ending up at Heaven's Cup. The cafe. So happy to be here, you quickly pull him in with you and the two of you pick a spot to sit. Looking around, Dick pretty much was able to figure out this had to be the place Raven and you went to a great deal it seem. By the big smile you had on.\"It's so...\" \"Relaxing and calm.\"a serene sigh escapes you. As you stretch out on the table\"I love it. If they would allow me to sleep here, I seriously would.\" Confused by what was on the menu, Dick places it aside.\"So it seems. This place does seem like something would like. I'm glad you feel at home here.\" \"Yeah, a home away from home.\"you said.\"Raven first brought me, so I could learn to channel others emotions. Well the negative ones, not become overwhelmed. Just to sit and be still.\"Closing your eyes, you could feel everyone in here, and it didn't bother you. Smiling to yourself. Opening your eyes.\"See? I didn't even change.\" He applauds.\"Bravo. Bravo. That is very impressive, you have improved. Raven really is helping you.\" You gush looking sheepishly.\"Yes, she's really is. Who would have thought having a sister would be this much fun. I know, she's doing all she can to prevent me from succumbing to Trigon's influence. Again. This other side of me, it's so scary. She tells me I can't fear it, otherwise it will consume me.\"Shaking your ashamed.\"I don't want that to happen. That place is so dark and cruel. The power is wonderful, I would be lying if I said it wasn't. But, that power is dangerous and destructive. Learning to keep it at bay and turn around using it for good is a struggle. A day to day struggle. I know Raven suffers more to keep it in control, she's very good at it. I'm trying my best to master everything she's teaching me, so she doesn't have to worry. That way I can...I can help her too. We both can keep Trigon back, show him we're much stronger than him.\" Dick reaches out a hand onto yours. You look to him, he gives you proud smile.\"You're doing a great job. All your effort. I'm so proud of you, so happy you have Raven to be there to help you. I wish it could be me, but I know this isn't my time. It's yours and Raven's.\" Noticing his eyes starting to tear up, you realize what he was saying. Before you could say it, one of the employees come.\"Hello there.\"A young man at least nineteen with short platinum hair, the left side of his face covered by a long bang. Concealing one of purple eyes. He had a cheerful demeanor. He was rather lean built.\"My name is Jai! Welco-Oh well look who's here.\"he notices you.\"Where is your other half?\"He asked referring to Raven.\"Normally the two of you sit together. You have Earl Gray, while she would just have herb. So? want the usual?\" \"No thank you, Jai.\"you tell him.\"And my sister isn't here with me today, but my cousin is.\" Jai turns to Dick, finally realizing he was there.\"OH! Well, excuse me I didn't see you there. Welcome! Welcome! Hmm...\"he leans close to Dick. Smirking.\"Well aren't you just delicious looking.\"He jokes, though it made Dick rather uncomfortable.\"I'm just teasing, besides you wouldn't be my type.\"He turns to you, pinching your cheek lightly. Making you laugh.\"This is what I prefer.\" Dick didn't know what to make of this for a second, but saw the fun humor and relaxed.\"I'm too young.\"you say, still laughing. \"I know.\"Jai lets go.\"So what will it be?\"He takes out pen and pad ready. At the tower, Raven took to her meditation in her room. All was silent, and still. Not a single presence around. Until she felt something, it was faint. Still, it was enough for her to grasp it, this energy felt strange...very strange. Then again rather familiar for some reason. It was a strange mix between warmth and death. No...danger...a threat? She wasn't sure, but it was strong. For some reason, it was unnerving. Against her better judgement she pushes further to see. Something she shouldn't have done, that presence some how felt her and lashed back. Forcefully. She flew across the room. Slamming into the wall. Her eyes snap wide open, fear rushed to her face. Looking at her sudden burnt hands, that she begin to heal. That wasn't her father's presence. No. He was locked away. \"...Violet...\"[Chapter 27] Hello everyone, first thank you to all who have been reading and following the story. Do not worry this message is not about me canceling the story. I am not going to do that nor restart it. What this message is about it, is that I was wondering if I where to make a story or two with Violet in the DC Comics fanfiction. I am not sure if some of you have heard or read about how DC comics has done a Rebirth of their series. Mainly with Teen Titans and with Jon son of Superman and Damian. I just wanted to know let you know that I might start up a new separate story with Violet in the new DC Comics Universe. Since because of Flash Point. I will keep going with this story I have out now. The new stories is based off the comics either following them or my own twist. Let me know what you think. If you have any comments.[Chapter 28] \"Alright. Everyone here?\"Cyborg said commanding attention. Looking at everyone on the team. You, Raven, Damian, Jaime, and Gar. Dressed and ready. Starfire stood next to Cy by the controls.\"Guess we're all here.\"Gar tells him. \"Good.\"Cy smirks.\"Listen up, I managed to improve the simulator for your training. The holograms have been collaborated to be more efficient then before. The A.I. will study your moves and constantly change to evolve. In stead of just fighting holograms, the whole area has been modified to change the surroundings and terrain to a setting most fitting through searching your neurological functions to pick what is consider best for your powers. While also for your weakness.\" Gar raises his hand. Cy gestures for him to speak.\"So, just what you saying?\" Damian couldn't help but smirk to himself at Gar's stupidity in his mind. About to school and make him look a bigger idiot, you explain it to him.\"What Victor means is that, our new simulator has been greatly improved. Think of it like a video game, how each level becomes harder. That's what he's saying. It will change according to our powers in a both a good way and not so good way. Our surroundings can change. Say to a jungle for you, where we must get through. Fight our way through. Any villain can really be our enemy. They are nearly realistic in a sense.\"You look to Cyborg hoping what you said was right. He smiles amazed and surprised.\"Very good. Yeah, that's pretty much it. I've incorporated the tech from myself to be apart of your system. This baby is the highest. Anyway, why don't we give it a test drive. Who wants to go first?\" Everyone looks at the other rather weary and unsure. No one was ready to step up first, so Starfire picked.\"...Jaime, you can go first.\"she volunteers him. Much to his dismay, but he obliges and suits up completely stepping to the center. Cyborg gets the new program up and running. Next thing the whole room transformed into the city. Buildings, skies, everything. Everyone was impressed. \"Whoa.\"Jaime said looking around, making sure his mind still remembered he was still at the tower.\"Hello?\" \"Don't worry.\"Cy speaks to him over the speaker.\"You're still here. Ready?\" Before Jaime could even respond, out of nowhere wave of robotic creatures, shooting lasers.\"HEY! I wasn't ready!\"Jaime draws his blaster and begins firing and fighting back. Becoming swarmed he takes to the sky. Focusing solely on the attack before him, left him open from the back. All eyes watch him get hit by a powerful blast sending him crashing through a building. Cyborg wasn't kidding about the improvements he did. These holograms clearly acted like as the adversary. Having no mercy or qualm. Down to their powers, especially with Atomic Skull. Who fires another blast at Jaime. Who managed to narrowly move just in time, forming a shield. From the controls Starfire and Cyborg watch the teen. \"Think quickly.\"Starfire instructs him.\"You must think quickly, Jaime.\" \"Dude, he's so getting beaten.\"Gar said, watching Jaime be knocked back into the ground. Making Gar flinch.\"Ouch.\" Atomic Skull stands over Jaime hand out about to blast him, when the simulator ends.\"...\"Jaime falls back exhausted and worn out.\"That was loco! Seriously!? I thought I was going to die!\"He said struggling to pick himself up.\"I think my bruises have bruises.\" \"Here.\"you go and help him. He takes your hand as he stands up. \"Thanks.\"he thanks you. Rubbing his shoulder.\"Those are suppose to be holograms.\"He scuffs walking off to allow the next person to go. Starfire calls for Raven. All eyes fall to her, Cyborgs sets her up in the slums of ruins. The sun was setting, it was sort of an eerie setting. Without a word, Cy sends her the same wave he did for Jaime. She manages to remain calm and destroy quite a few, her adversary was Dr. Light. Who didn't let up. Raven remained calm through it all, that it was hard to see she was sort of struggling. You watch amazed at the amount of control she had over herself and powers. It was just awe inspiring. That you couldn't help but feel proud yet insecure. Not a single ounce of the demon side came out. This was what control was. Your eyes watch and study her. Her fight with Dr. Light soon came to an end, with her narrowly being victorious. Cy was impressed and proud. The fight was good and taxing, though Raven did her best not to show it. Looking to you, seeing the pride made her smile to herself. You get ready to go and congratulate her, when your name was called. Up next, Gar cheers for you the loudest. You didn't want to go next, you actually wanted to go last or second to last. How could you top that? What Raven just did, nervous, you remember what Raven said. Swallowing your fear and step forward. Hearing your heart racing, that you barely heard Cyborg tell you to get ready. Calming your breathing, in a flash your surroundings changed to sort of a London Fog area. The place was dark and gray. By the docks, you could hear the boats and waves. Even the seagulls. Not to mention the actually chill of the place. Even Big Ben's dong. Slowly and carefully, you start walking. Looking around, keeping yourself in-check. Reminding yourself to do. While at the same time getting yourself ready. Your mind begin to try and see what sort of approach you should take when the enemy came. Combat? Powers? Both? Yeah, both sounded good. Eyes still looking, seeing nothing in this dense fog. Not a single sound. You stop for a second to look in the grey water at your reflection when something caught your eye. It ran. Quickly you purse it, running at first. Until it something else went by you and you changed to your wings. This had to be your enemy. Who would you get? Landing in the deserted streets, no one around. Everything from the shops to the corners. Empty. Wings disappear, slowly you walk keeping your guard up. When you hear a strange yet familiar noise. It sounded like something from a musical box. The sound and melody...where did you know it from? Walking in the direction of it, as if in a trance. Slowly you begin to hum it, knowing it all of sudden. Yet your memories couldn't find any images. Closing your eyes slowly becoming submerged by it entanglement of sound. Your soul felt all of sudden light and free. Separating itself. This sound called out to you. So gentle. So calming. So safe. Warm. \"My child.\" A soothing and loving voice speaks to you. Making you stop suddenly and look at the form before you slowly take form of female. You couldn't make them out, but you could feel their presence. It was both familiar and right. Yet at the same time confusing and lost. Their hand reaches out and gently brushes the side of your cheek. Their sudden touch, brought forth a memory you kept buried. Hell. The flames of Hell surrounded you, you in your corrupted form. Trigon behind you, you embracing your side with glee and satisfaction. Bodies before you. Bodies of so many, bodies of everyone...everyone you loved. Bloody and defeated. Death in their eyes. Piled upon the other. Horrified and terrorized by this before you. You panic and flip out. Crying.\"No! No!\"you plead, turning tail and run. To be followed by this haunting scene. There was no way out. Not even shutting your eyes blocked it out. The images came flooding in, crashing on you like a heavy storm.\"Stay back! Stay back!\"You lash out, shooting a blast of Hell Fire, but it did nothing.\"I don't want to be there anymore! That's not me! That's not me!\" Your wings form and you shoot up, blasting a hole to get out of the underworld. The creatures and everything follows in hot pursuit. Noticing them, you fire back. Unleashing your power, yelling for them to stay back. While trying to get out of this Hellish place. Reaching for the voice calling for you. \"These are you SINS! These are SINS!\"your mind kept playing over and over again.\"Repent. Repent!\" A large creature comes out of nowhere and nearly tackles you, you mange to dodge just in time. While blasting it from behind. Sending it down. The rest where enclosing around you, even Trigon. His hand reaching out for you, an evil smirk upon his face. Fear shot through you. Struggling to keep it down, feeling yourself beginning to burning. Again. The pain. Pain, all the pain. You felt it. More than ever now. You didn't want this. Not this, not all that you have fought for. This was not what you wanted. This had to stop, you had to make this stop. A voice inside you told you so, you could make this all stop. Giving into the voice, raising your hands above your head. Something else took over, words came out of your mouth you didn't quite understand or know. All you knew, you weren't in control. This was nothing Raven told you. Next thing you knew everything went white and you couldn't see anything. No one was there. No voices from the others. Your voice didn't work. Calling for them did nothing. Unable to see them, left you blind and scared. Feeling out in front of you, finding nothing. But emptiness. Gripping for something solid. Finding air. All around you. What was happening?! Where were you?! Why couldn't you find anyone!? Yes, you escaped that place. But...But... Not understanding what was happening right now. Trying to run somewhere, when you couldn't. Your legs had nothing to run on. Floating aimlessly in nothing but the white abyss. Being taking any direction. Everything felt light and free. No more pain. Suffering. No more sins. No more darkness. Just white darkness. Desperate to find a way out, feeling a unfamiliar presence. It was small, trying to remain hidden and concealed. But you felt it, at least you did. Looking around still not seeing, feeling for it. Stopping and look in one area for a couple of seconds. Opening your mouth to speak, no words again came out. Screaming your mind to be released. To be found. Slowly you begin to curl up in the fetal position. Bottling everything up, a hand enters and grabs hold of you. Bring you back, your eyes open. All the white vanished, vision came back. Feeling. All your senses came. Feeling gentle breeze upon your skin, made you smile weakly. Tiredly looking to the sun, reaching for the light, your body some how felt heavy and taxed, all your energy gone you black out. Falling out of the sky. \"VIOLET!\"Starfire and the others scream. Watching as you limp body plummets to down below. They scream for you to wake up, but you didn't. Raven waste no time and hurries after you with Starfire and the others who could fly. Speeding up, Raven hurries to catch her sister. While trying to figure out was what was wrong and what just happened. Just a few minutes ago, you like the rest where set up in the simulator to train. When all of sudden, it was like something possessed her. Raven sensed it too late. Whatever it was managed to get hold of Violet. This presence she didn't sense until they made themselves known. Took over Violet, causing her sister to unleash her demonic side without her triggering it. Attacking them all for unknown reasons. But, that wasn't what shocked and surprised them. What Violet did next did, what she conjured, nearly. Astound the dark teen. Was this apart of her sister's other half? It almost seem nearly identical to that of the magic used by her people back on Azrath. Yet, there was something different. It was strange mix of dark and malevolence with purity and life. And that strange light that emitted from her younger sister. Hurt her, it hurt Raven. Her sister possessed by this strange presence nearly untapped it, nearly consumed Violet. It seem they only wanted to see, what Violet could do. Was that their reasoning for burying her sister's presence inside her own body and mind? Her soul nearly lost. Luckily that did not happen. \"Gotcha!\"Starfire managed to catch her falling sister before she hit the water and would be lost forever. Flying the unconscious teen back to the top of the tower, where Damian waited by the gaping hole you had produced after blasting a hole through several floors. To escape. He too was puzzled and caught off guard by your sudden attack upon the team. He thought like the others, you where getting your new powers under control. Hearing you scream and yell about sins. Over and over again, like a crazed patient from Arkham. He saw the struggle of pain and agony all on you. Your flames went out of control, like wildfire. Something wasn't right. He knew it. Turning back to the hole quickly, studying it for a second to turn back once Starfire and the others came back. He hurries over to you, to beat by Gar turning back into his normal from a bird. \"Is she okay?\"Gar asked worried, taking the words from Damian. Who did not at all appreciate it. He nearly crowded around, for Jaime to pull Gar back.\"Give her some air. How is she?\"he asked Starfire. Raven hurries over to you, putting a hand upon your forehead. Everyone waits to hear what she found.\"...She's fine.\"she tells them, relieved herself.\"Her body is just...tired.\" Starfire sighs relieved to hear.\"Good. Let's take her to the infirmary just to be sure.\" Reaching the infirmary, Starfire lays you down and with Cyborg's help gets you hooked up. All your vitals where fine, from the test Cy preformed a few times. Starfire knowing it was right, went to inform Dick. As Cy worked on you, the others where still at lost on what happened. While Gar was more concerned about you. \"Hey, Raven.\"Jaime looks to her.\"What the heck happened? How did her powers go loco like that?\" \"I thought you said she was coming around with her powers?\"Damian interrogates more so than questions. Raven remains silent before responding.\"...I honestly don't know.\"Surprising them.\"All I know is that, something came. Some sort of strange presenc-\" \"Trigon?\"Jaime asked. \"No.\"Raven tells him.\"It's not. He can't get out.\"she quickly looks up at her jewel.\"Whatever it was, was waiting. They clearly know who my sister is. Their presence felt some what similar to those from Azarth.\" \"But, you said your whole home was gone.\"Gar joins them.\"So how can it be?\" \"I don't know.\"was all Raven could say. Becoming frustrated herself she didn't have the answer either.\"If I knew, I could tell you.\"She looks at her sister laying unconscious.\"...Something is causing her turmoil inside.\"Turning around she leaves. \"Where are you going?\"Jaime calls after. She stops about to answer, but chooses not to and forms a portal walking in and leaves.\"Something doesn't feel right.\"Gar said worried.\"I can feel it. Some sort of strange coldness. Hey? Where are you going?\"He sees Damian leave too.\"Aren't you going to stay?\" \"Clearly, there is nothing we can do.\"Damian said.\"Cyborg has this, I'm going to go and do something more stimulating.\"Without another word he leaves. \"Seriously?!\"Gar growls lowly.\"Doesn't he care? You know what, fine whatever. I'll stay until she wakes.\"He hollers down the hall as Damian turns the corner. In anger Damian punches the wall, nearly denting it from Gar's words. Taking his fist back, ignoring the pain he refocuses himself and goes back to the scene of the incident. Back to the training room. Which was nearly charred. Using his detective skills, he carefully eyes everything. Replaying what happened in his mind. From the start of the day. It was a like pretty much any normal day, everyone woke up and headed down for breakfast. Which like always Violet made or had ready. Today's breakfast omelets with fruit salad, toast, french toast and juice. Spread out for them to get. Damian remembered, everyone was there. Gar getting the most, turning into a animal to eat. Everyone was getting their plate, except one. You. He noticed the distant look you had. At first he didn't pay much attention to it at first. Until you excused yourself from breakfast, leaving quickly and quietly. He still did nothing. Preferring to keep his distance. Like he'd been doing for some time. Ever since you came back from Hell. He finished his food and went back to his room to clean up. Change from his nightwear. His mind focused on something else, that he didn't see the other, until he collided with them. Assuming it to be Gar, he got ready to say a crude remark. Finding it to be instead. Rubbing your temple, apologizing stopping realizing it was him. The two of you stared at the other, in silence. It was there he saw in your eyes something wasn't right. But you adverted your eyes so fast from him, he couldn't get a chance to ask. Quickly you gather everything, apologizing to him. Nearly stumbling with what your things. He was about to help, when you screamed for him not to. It was unlike you. Well to say the least. Watching you pick yourself up and sprint away, out of reflex he was about to grab your wrist. But hesitates. For some unknown reason. His eyes watch you hurry off down the hall. Reaching his room, gathering his casual clothes. Black turtle neck, with black pants and shoes. Simple and easy. Refined and collected. He makes his way to the showers, cleaning himself. His mind continued to remain on you. Yet, he did his best to block it out. Ending his shower short. Coming out dressed and clean. He stops for a second, looking in the direction towards your room. He felt something, he couldn't explain coming from that direction. \"It's not my concern.\"he tells himself and goes back to his room. Throwing his clothes in his hamper and his towel on his bed. He walks over to his desk and opens the top drawer taking out the lace tie for your hair he had taken when he first met you. He lays it down on the table, looking at it. For it to be interrupted by a knock upon his door. Quickly he puts it away and goes to answer. Finding you there. This was a surprise, because you hadn't come by his room since that day.\"Yes.\"he said, from all the other responses he wanted to use. \"I just wanted to tell you, we're having practice a bit earlier today.\"you tell him.\"I'm not sure if you knew. Starfire told me.\" \"Ah. Yes, well thank you.\" Silence again between you both. Your eyes fidget a bit.\"Alright then. Be there by 11:30.\" With that you turn and leave.\"...Violet.\"He calls to you, finding you had left. With a few hours to spend before practice, he had something more important to do. Turning on his laptop, he gets to work. Time went by rather fast, and before he knew it was 11:20. Nearing the time, he changes into his Robin persona. And makes it to the training room with five minutes to spare. The first like always, hearing laughter, coming from you. He turns seeing you walking with Raven and Gar, whom the latter was causing you laugh. Much to his disdain. Cyborg tells them about their new simulator with you further explaining it. Jaime went, then Raven and finally you. He watched you carefully, noticing the way you looked at Raven when she preformed. The awe sensation and admiration you had. While your insecurity rose. He was going to say something to you, but you had been called. It was then he noticed the way your eyes quickly shifted. Like you saw something. Right there, something was wrong. Running two fingers on the ground, looking at the residue. Smelling the burnt. Wiping his fingers. He stares up at the hole that lead all the way up, his eyes notice something. Nearly hidden. Looking around for something to use, remembering his grappling hook, he shoots up and pulls himself up. To where he spotted his first clue. Using tweezers, he pulls out a what looked like a bit a of fiber. He could be wrong. Tucking away it away, he looks for anything else. When something gentle brushes upon his cheek. He looks finding nothing, though looking down he finds a small white bird's feather. Dropping down, he picks up the dove's feather. Looking at it, as eyes from afar watch you.[Chapter 29] In the disclosed location three figure converse.\"You are nearly nothing but a mere mortal, yet thou reputation is know quite well. Including your finesse and manipulation in the mystic arts, is by far quite astounding for a mortal.\" Their guest bow humbly to them.\"Why thank you, for your kind words. I must say, this is quite a honor to be here in your presence. Honestly I never would have thought in a millennia to every meet your kind.\" \"Do not flatter yourself human. But your words have not fallen on deaf ears. To the matter at hand,\"they hold their hand out a mystical orb forms, showing them visual images of Violet.\"This here is my kin. My one and only. She is lost in this world of sin.\" \"I sense another presence about her, something dark.\" \"Yes. That would be her wretched demonic side. In order obtain power necessary one must at times lay with the devil. And behold my kin to be born. For years she has had to suffer the world of man's insatiable sins.\"They begin to weep.\"My kin subjected to such poison. Disgusting. Truly. Their soul becoming tainted by the evils of human...I regret the choice I had to make. Should time give me another chance I will save my kin's damned soul. And it shall be purified as her kin is. Our glory shall enlighten all. And a new day of peace and light shall rise higher than the sun.\" Their servant bows to them.\"Yes. M'Lady that day shall be most glorious and beyond the highest of the high.\" \"It seems to me, your child does not share the values.\"their guest speaks. Looking at the orb.\"Clearly.\" \"You are quite right. Do not worry, that is where you are to come in. My faithful servant has managed to make contact with my kin. She is at her peak, yet needs that finally push.\" \"Can you not just go an-\" In anger they expel a blast of energy.\"That demon's other wretched spawn has dug their claws into my beloved kin's soul! They are corrupting their mind beyond anything! Forcing them to embrace the impurities of their blood!\" \"M'Lady!\"their servant hurries over to them, calming them. Regaining themselves back.\"Forgive me. As for your question, I have made myself known to my kin in many forms. I have seen them. Within my reach, yet she does not yearn for me. I must get her to yearn for me. You must do as I say, bring my kin to the break of desperation. There she will come willing to seek a mother's love and warmth. I wish to hold her against my bossom. Feed her gentle and loving words she has been denied for years. She will know the love I have to offer her, is genuine and sincere. Together we shall be a family. And cleanse this world into a world she shall no longer know pain. Misery shall no longer hunt her nor any other soul. Sins will be washed away. And I shall reclaim...\"they stop themselves realizing what they nearly exposed. Clearing their throat. Holding out their palm towards their guest.\"With all your power, you shall need more. Consider this a temporal gift. Use your gifts to bring my kin back to their mother. Use any means to do so, BUT no harm shall come to them. No physical harm. Do you understand?! Mortal?\" Awing and please dark eyes stare at their new found trinket.\"Yes. I understand, M'Lady.\" \"Good.\" * A week later * \"The souls of the sin are tainted. The souls are unsettled.\" \"Sins.\" \"Cleanse the sins!\" \"Pain. Pain of the suffering.\" \"Pain of all. The souls of many screaming in agony.\" \"Agony. Agony.\" \"Cleanse the sins. Cleanse the darkness. Come. Rid thou of sins. Cleanse! Cleanse! CLEANSE!\" Your eyes shoot open, looking around your room. Everything was fine. Everything was alright. Pinching your brow, what a strange dream. Again. Those words, they echo in your mind. You didn't know why, maybe you should stop reading before dozing off. Looking down at the book under you. Voices of the Mystics. Yeah, you thought. Should probably stop with the reading. Closing the text, one of Raven's she lent to you. Yawning and stretching you get up from your desk and chair. Stopping for a second to look out your window over the water. It was so calm and soothing. Clear blue sky, white fluffy clouds. Water that sparkled so nicely. What a serene feeling, reminded you a bit back at the monastery. How isolated and calming it was. To be away from everything and anything. All distractions gone, nothing but inner focus and peace. Well before all this happened. Still, it would be nice to go back there, just to see how everyone was doing at least. Closing your eyes for a second, wishing you could like Raven produce a soul self, to see. But, you weren't there yet. Having not mastered full control over your powers. To completely concentrate, in order to do so. Still working on absorbing the negative emotions that would come and go. Learning to stifle your craving for it. To not consume and be overcome with them. Practice and patience was the key. Still, you often wondered if you could produce one yourself? Though your sister had said was plausible, as she learned it from Azarath. Which was the teachings she has been giving you. The best way to counter the demon side of you both. Still...you wanted to just see. Making sure you sensed no one and especially her, you sit in the center of the room. Richie was roosting on the bed. Straighten your self up and calming your breathing. Focusing the mind into one fine point, hands in position. Legs crossed and eyes shut. Everything was still. Everything needed to be still. Sensing nothing. You begin to concentrate, reaching for that part of you. That belonged to Trigon, what did Raven say... Turn it around into something. Shape it. Form it. Control it. Feel the connection and let it fly free. Slowing the fire outlines you and levitates you just a few inches off the floor. The flames begin to grow and grow. Still you kept your focus. Inhaling and exhaling slowly. Find in your mind, where you wanted to go or what you wanted to see. Reaching in your mind to find it. You reach out to the image, when something comes in a flash and breaks your concentration and focus. Your body suddenly gets thrown across the room into the wall. It startled you that you unleashed accidentally some of your flames. Quickly coming to your senses, to see the flames in your room. Quickly you reduce them, before setting off anything alarm. Messaging your temples, telling yourself not to try that again. Clearly not ready. Not ready. Your mind was felt clouded and your soul unease. You needed some clarity and you knew just the place to go, getting up off the floor you change quickly into your civilian wear. Normally wouldn't do this alone, it would be mainly with Raven. But for the some time now, she's been rather distant with you. Which was why she gave you books to read, to help with in your training. She wouldn't tell you why, just to keep practicing. No time to spend together, despite you wanting too. Respecting her as teacher and sister, leave her be. It shouldn't be that bad going by yourself there. You practically are a regular there anyway. Double checking with everything, you leave. When someone spots you.\"Hey Violet!\" A knock came to your door, but no answer. They knock again, still no answer. Normally they would irritated about this, but not this time. They knock again this time acknowledging themselves. \"Violet. It's me Damian.\"he said.\"Can you open the door, so I can come in? I need to talk with you? Just for a bit.\"Nothing. He knocks again.\"Violet?\" \"What are you doing?\"Raven suddenly appears, giving Damian a questionable look. He gives her one back.\"I thought I said for you to leave her alone.\" \"I just wanted to talk with her.\"he said. She could sense something else. Her eyes pierce his for the answer. But he wouldn't let her. Turning away from her gaze to the door.\"I just need to talk with her. That's all. We are friends and teammates.\" \"And I am her sister. Her OLDER sister.\"Raven emphasis.\"...What have you found? I can sense your concern and worry.\" \"It's nothing.\"Damian quickly says.\"And any concerns you believe I hav-\" \"Don't lie to me. Damian.\"Raven said calmly, with a threatening undertone.\"You as well I know, something isn't right. Is that why you sneak into her room? Dead of night. You can see the her small lack of concentration just as well I. Ever since a week ago. Now again, I will ask, what have you found? Tell me?\" The tension between them slowly begin to tighten. Until someone breaks it.\"Are you two looking for Violet?\"Jaime asked coming over.\"She left about an hour ago, with Gar. The two of them went out, she said she needed to ease her mind.\" Hearing what he said, Damian storms through him in a huff.\"Excuse me.\" Jaime and Raven watch him storm off.\"This doesn't seem like it's going to end well.\"Jaime sighs.\"I've told Gar to leave her alone.\" \"They both need to leave her alone.\"Raven said, looking back to the door. \"Here you go.\" The waitress places your's and Gar's order down. You thank her, she smiles nodding and leaves. Picking up your tea about to drink when you notice Gar looking around the cafe rather confused. \"Is something wrong?\"you asked. He looks across at you and smiles.\"Naw. Nothings wrong. I just didn't think a place like this would be so...so..\"he tries to find the words. \"Thank you.\"you tell him.\"Thank you for coming. You didn't have too.\" \"Naw.\"he brushes is it aside.\"I didn't mind. You talk so much about this place with Raven and come her a lot. Thought I might as well come too. You said their salads are pretty good. So yeah.\" You give a little smile.\"Yes, they are really good. This place is relaxing. It clears my mind a lot. Not to mention it's a place to come without feeling indifferent with those outside.\"Your eyes cast quickly to the window. Gar knew that insecurity look. He understood well. \"Yeah, looking different, like this.\"he looks at himself.\"It's does make you stand out. But at the same time it's a good thing. Makes those like us different. Which is a good thing. I mean we both have pointy teeth. So that's cool. We don't have to go through a medical procedure to get them. Not to mention we give the most awesome smirks.\"He flashes you one. You couldn't help but laugh a bit.\"That is true. I never thought about it like that. Still,\"your mood shifts.\"...\"Looking at your reflection in your tea.\"To be reminded everyday of the horrible acts.\" He reaches across placing a hand on yours.\"Hey, we don't blame you at all. You know that.\"he consoles you.\"It wasn't your fault. We didn't know about that side of you.\" \"Thank you, for your kind words.\"you said, still it did nothing to lift your feelings.\"Still, I can feel the souls of all tormented. Everything and everyday since day one...I'm trying to cleanse myself of all the horrible deeds I've done. By his name. Being used as merely nothing but a tool.\"A sigh escapes you. Gar listens and tries to make it better.\"Okay, so yeah. But Raven's been helping you with that and you're coming around more now. I mean not like before. So there's some progress right?\" \"Progress? Not after what happened last week with practice.\"you lament.\"I nearly scotched the room.\"Looking at your hands.\"...There something unsettling.\" \"So you had one bad day.\"Gar said.\"That's okay.\" You look at him.\"...I wish it was.\"you mumble. Thinking quickly he changes the topic.\"Hey, you birthday is coming up isn't?\" \"Oh. I nearly forgot.\" \"Do you have any ideas on what you want? Want to do? Cake flavors? Themes?\"he questions. \"...Honestly I-\" \"The sins of one must be cleanse.\" \"Purity of the weary soul.\" \"Cleanse. Cleanse! \" \"Make what was old, into new!\" \"Suffer the sins, thou has done!\" \"Repent! Repent!\" \"Violet? Vi?\"Gar calls to you, waving his hand in front of you. Just a second ago you where talking and all of sudden stop. He didn't know why.\"Vi?\"He reaches for you.\"Vi?\" Trigon's hand it came for you, back in Hell you found yourself. How did this happen? Frozen with fear, your father reaches for you, claiming you. Your markings begin to burn, his presence nearing, you did the only thing you could think of. Raising your hand ignite it with flames. \"Stay away!\"you scream and lash out at him. \"VI! DON'T!\"Gar panics. A dark portal appears, just as you unleash your fire.\"STOP!\"Raven comes out to be blasted point blank range. Hearing her, brought you back, but too late. You watch in horror and terror, as her body crashes through cafe. Others get up shocked and alarmed at what just happened. Petrified by what you just did. \"Raven...Raven!\"[Chapter 30] Lighting a cigarette in the cold night, cynical blue eyes study the crime scene before them. Lifting the police tape, they walk in. Yeah, this place was charred badly. Heaven's Cafe. News reporters still around trying to get more on what happened here a couple of hours ago. Such dogs, wanting a wet bone. They scuff. Of course they would be feed their treat on false information. Then again maybe false information is a good thing, Lord knows they couldn't handle the actual truth behind these fire. For one, it wasn't a stove left on or a gas leak. But those where the words used, by the police and reporters. Making their way into the charred building, being careful with each step. They stop in the center and could feel it. They could see what happened. The truth. Holding out a hand, a yellow magical ruin appears before them. Briefly waving their hand, they see the scene before them. It was in the afternoon, they where sitting right there, across from their green male friend. Both of them clearly not human appearance. The other body had long white wild hair. Strange black markings along their body, even though their clothes did conceal some of it. Their violet eyes, they knew those eyes anywhere. She had inherited her mother's eyes. Yes, she was the source. They could feel their parentage radiating off of them. Their demonic parentage, leaked and oozed out. And this girl didn't even know it. Watching her talking to her friend, when this interference came. Something took possession of her, the change in her eyes conformed it. Whatever it was, caused her to implode and unleash black of Hell, just as another comes through a portal to stop her. Trying to stop her, to be hit with the blast of fire point blank range. After that everything around burst into flames. These flames that held darkness in them, and power the tormented and vile. The flames of Hell itself. Their blue eyes could see the souls of dead, screaming and being unleashed. Their malicious hunger being fed, by all around the. It was shocking as it was amazing. The hollows of the screams, screeched everywhere. Of course those with normal eyes could not see this nor many others. But they could. That wasn't all they noticed. They noticed this girl was feeding off those around her. Like a vampire of some sort. She seem to be doing it unconsciously, he watched the energy of others fill her. She didn't seem to notice. Looking deeper, studying what he saw before their eyes. Taking a few smokes. Stop the scene before them, the girl in the center of her flames. Walking closer they see upon her forehead, what was caused her to erupt the flames. An enchantment. Twisting her mind and no doubt soul, to see what they wanted them too. They couldn't help but to pity her, while at the same time hold to obligation. It was her they sensed, that unbalance. It was sad, so young and already tainted by her linage. Knowing well the limited amount of time they had before all of this went down. Dismissing the scene before them, back to charred cafe, they take a closer look around. Finding some burnt menus and broken cups. Outlines of bodies. Heading behind the counter. Nothing really. Nothing so far. Reaching to the kitchen, heavily damaged and melted. To some extent. They walk down the aisle with the food. Stopping in front of one of the shelves. Reaching up, they take out a dark red cylinder canister of tea. Nearly destroyed but still could somewhat read the label. Opening the lid, to quickly close it. From the gagging smell. Wishing they didn't have to come across this substance, for its strong potency. Never would they imagine to find this in a centuries. This stuff was to be band or at least solid on the magical black market. How it made its way to humans, was shocking. They went to such great length to get this, opening the top again. Holding back their gag reflexes, pour a bit out into the palm of their hand. Grounded up into powder, quite cleaver and disusing the name too. Yes, this would really have a huge effect upon certain...people. There was no telling how much, she had of this. How much was in her system already. For them to do this to their own. It was sick. Then again, not surprised really. As holy as they would seem, they where just as dark. If not worse. Thinking they would not tangle with them again, was not going to happen. Clearly the seal wasn't strong enough. Or they just found other means. It didn't matter, all that mattered right now was the end game. Tucking the canister in their trench coat, finishing up their cigarette. Hearing others coming, they slip out in the back, stopping noticing a white feather in the ally. Picking it up, looking around. This wasn't good. Tucking the feather away, they form their ruin. \"Find me, find me the girl.\" An image of Violet Grayson came up. \"Raven?\"you call to her, looking up from your book. Across at her. Her eyes glance up from her reading to you. Giving you her attention. \"Yes?\" Turning the book around to show her what it was you where reading. Pointing to it, she looks at it.\"Right here. What Azar put, about control. I know its important. I just would like to know how banishing evil works?\" \"...It works when one doesn't give into it. I've told you this before.\"she sounded rather annoyed, but you knew she wasn't.\"The books on which Azar wrote that was able to recover. Help to find peace in ourselves. You know well enough, what it's about. What is really on your mind?\" She saw through you again.\"It's just well...These teachings...\"you sit back and look at the reading. Sensing your uncertainty.\"Violet, these teachings and lessons I am giving you are beneficial for us both. We can't afford to really have doubt. If you are wondering about your progress you're doing rather well.\" \"Thank you, but that's not it.\"you confess.\"What I mean is...though these teachings are about peace and sincerity. I feel, that I cannot connect to them. You know my soul is forever to be plagued with-\" \"What are you saying?\"She was confused from your words. \"...What if...What if well...\" Setting her book down, giving her full attention now. Sensing disturbance within you.\"What's been plaguing you?\"Quickly you put the book up covering your face. But she uses her power and removes it, giving you a rather stern and serious glare.\"What is it? What's been bothering you?\" Twiddling with your fingers, messaging your temples.\"I'm not quite sure, what it is...I can feel something inside me..creeping and festering inside. Screaming to be let out. I mediate and keep my mind clear. But...it doesn't seem to be working. I do my best to suppress, but it keeps fighting back.\" \"That's normal.\"she tells you.\"It's Trigon trying to influence you. Though he is imprisoned in the gem. His essence still flows through us and at any given moment. He use us to set him free. Don't worry, I went through the same thing. Back on Azarath I could feel his essence in me. Back then I didn't know what it was. Until well...you know. I called upon it, to see him. Even now his essence is trying to claim me. It is screaming at you, to weaken you. But we must not let it. We must be stronger and better than him. You will get there soon.\"She holds out her hands.\"Give me your hands.\" You do as she says, she sits down in front of you crisscross.\"Close your eyes.\"She tells you, you do.\"Clear your mind and relax.\"You grip her hands a bit.\"By the power of Azar, I beseech the dwelling of evil. Connect the our souls together and banish the darkness. Give us strength to preserver above the essence of Trigon.\"She then says something else in another language you couldn't understand. And after that she was done.\"There. How do you feel?\" Looking and feeling yourself, you felt a bit better.\"Better.\"You smile relieved.\"Thank you.\"She gives you a small nod and smile. \"Good. Now then, let's get back to studying. Because we will be instrumenting this in your training.\"She gives you back your book.\" It was all on the news, broadcast across no doubt the nation. People in fear and panic you could feel it spiking like crazy no matter what you did. Your body absorbed it like a sponge. Feeling their hate and skepticism. With their flamed negative emotions came insight on their true motives. But what was worse and followed you back to the Tower, haunting you like Death. The souls of those who lost their lives. Their unrest souls, lost and screaming in pain for their unfair death. Pulling at you, it was horrible. Feeling their presence and wicked thoughts clawing at you, for the sin you committed. You never meant to take their lives, you didn't mean too. You thought he was coming...you thought Trigon was there. You saw him. You where back in Hell again. He nearly had you in grasp. Everyone thing around you, part of his domain. Launching out to you, trying to drag you down. You didn't want to go back. Not to that soulless place. Fear overtook you, it gripped you. And now guilt took hold. It held you tightly, forcing you to see what you did. What you did, to everyone and most importantly. Raven. She took the blast full force, luckily she managed to just barely shield herself, with her soul self. Before sending it to you. Bringing you back to your senses. But, by that time it was all too late. It was already done. Your eyes saw their souls and all you had done. Rattled and horrified, with the last of her strength. Raven had her soul self teleport, herself, you and Gar out of there. Making it back to the Tower. Raven was quickly whisked away to the Emergency Room. You didn't know how to wrap your mind around this. What to say about it. Starfire wanted answers on what happened. But you where a state of shock. That you just didn't know what to say. Gar had to fill her in. Everything you broke, never would you have attacked Raven like that. Never did you want to her hurt her, that was far from it. You wanted to protect her, for it to back fire. Lost and ashamed, you retreat to your room away from everyone. Locking yourself in, afraid of you might do to them. Though not before going to Raven's and forming an enchanted circle around preventing anyone from entering. You could feel it, your powers something wasn't right. Richie nearly transformed so you put him out of your room too. Keeping to yourself, secluded. The flames, the flames wanted to come out. With your mind frazzled like this, you could barely keep them under control. Thankful for the circle, that kept them at bay. This was what you where trying to tell Raven. This was it right here, you knew it. You could feel it. And looked what happen. Feeling yourself slipping away, you cry tears of hate and fear. You hated yourself, you tired to find the goodness inside. But there was clearly none. None when you nothing but darkness was all you felt. All this was just too much, Raven had years of training to understand her powers and live in a way, peace with them. Control them. While you on the other hand didn't. Sure the two of you shared the same paternal parentage, but not the maternal. Which was where the gap was. How could the two of you share the same powers? Abilities? What she was teaching you, wasn't even working. You tired so hard, but in the end it was all for nothing. She didn't understand this sensation building up inside of you. She didn't have absorb and feed upon the negative emotions and their souls like you. Making a true demon on this Earthy plane. Looking at your hands, the hands of Trigon. Though he was locked up, you could feel yourself doing his bidding regardless. Why didn't you leave? You had a chance to leave the team, but chose to stay. Now thinking about it, you regret that choice. Your tears begin to burn with heated anger and confusion. The screaming souls of murders swarmed you. Crushing you in a sea of damnation. Barely able to breath. You try to search for something, anything to bring you out. Desperately trying. There was nothing around. No one around. Like before, years ago on that cold dark night. Your infant cries pierced the cold Winter night sky. No one came. Left in the darkness. Just like now. This world was evil and cruel as it was to you, years ago. Yes, you remember well. That night. The chill of the cold winds. Silence of the night. Cold blanket of solace. The welcoming of Death. Your lungs and throat cried and screamed. Just like your soul now. So diverged and submerged in somber thoughts, that you didn't hear someone knocking on your door. Their voice faded away, it didn't exist. Jaime kept knocking and calling for you. But there wasn't a response. He knew no doubt how scared you felt right now and horrible. When Gar came bursting in with Raven in his arms. Seeing the condition she was in was bad. Luckily she had her healing. Though when he saw you just standing there petrified. There was literally no words that could describe the fear and frighten look in your eyes. The shame and hate too. He had tired to go after you, but you ran away. He tired to follow, to be blocked by a wall of flames produced by you. So he decided to give you space and see on his teammate. With that taken care of, he came back to check up on you. But you hadn't respond to him. His knocking soon turned into a light banging. He tired to get the door open to find, you had melted the it shut. Clearly you where determine to yourself inside and away. There was another option. Busting down the door. Which his scrab was about to react too, but he stops them. \"Violet! Violet, it's alright. It's okay. No one's upset at with you.\"he tries to reach you, but received nothing. \"Violet. Come on let me in. If you worried about Raven, she's doing better. Her healing kicked in so, she's alright. Cyborg said she's doing better. So come on...come out.\" Still nothing. Except for a chirping from Richie. Who was outside, looking at the little robin, he noticed something. It was in pain, watching it fall over. Flopping back and forth. Now he begin to worry. Richie started to transition between his normal size to enlarging parts of himself. Now banging on the door. \"Violet! Violet! What's going on!?\"he demands. Richie's chirps became louder and louder. It sounded like something was trying to suffocate it. The poor little thing, its little body contorting. Still pounding on door, having enough. He evokes his armor and throws a punch. Breaking the door down, to be blasted back by your flames. Slamming him into the wall. Luckily he shielded himself. The fire alarms and emergency alarms went off. Quickly he gets up and rushes into your now charred and nearly destroyed room. With a gaping hole now there. The edges still lingered with your flames. He runs to the edge, looking around frantically. He didn't see any sign of his distraught teammate in the night sky.\"Violet! VIOLET!\" In the Batcave, Alfred came in carrying a tray of warm tea and some sweet crackers. Along with a sandwich. Setting it down by the Bat computer.\"Here you are, Master Damian.\"he hands the tea and sandwich to the focused boy. \"Thank Pennyworth.\"Damian said, reaching for the tea without looking away from the images on the computer. In one of the windows, was the small sample he had found from training a few days back. Still waiting for the analysis to finish. While matching the words he remembered escaping Violet's mouth when she was possessed. It was no doubt of ancient tongue. Some of the words though did sound familiar. That wasn't all he had, he images of the strange designs he collected from in his mind \"investigating\". Slipping into her room, for his own reasoning. Coming across these strange symbols/designs. In her opened book. She had sketched them, it was rather odd. When he flipped through the pages. After what happened, he went back to them and felt there was sort of connection between them and this piece he found. He had left to come back to the manor. To do his own investigation. His intuition kept telling him, something wasn't right. Noticing the troubled and tired look in Violet's eyes. Despite her trying to hide it. A few times he slipped into her room, for \"research\" purpose to conform this. Seeing her toss and turn in her sleep, vexed by something. Sweating and cringing. Speaking in unknown language. From what he remembered, back when the two of them spend time at the monastery. Violet never tossed in her sleep, like she did now. Nor did she speak in another language. He would know, they shared the same room and bed. If she had trouble sleeping, she would grip the covers and ball herself up tightly. It was rather annoying, she would take the covers. But he would always know how to ease it, which would require him to wake up and turn her around. To where she was facing him, he would bring her close to him. And hold her tight enough, till it stopped. It always worked. Now, though he couldn't do that. With the two of them in separate rooms. Even when he slipped into her room, seeing her plagued by her dreams. He couldn't do anything really. If he wanted to risk getting caught. All he could do was just watch. \"Any luck Master Damian?\"Alfred asked. Looking up at the screen. \"No nothing. This search is proving to be...quite formidable than I thought.\"Damian said calmly, to try and hide his impatience and frustration. Pinching his temples. Alfred looks to him. He could see the troubled frustration and deep concern. Even if the young one didn't want to admit it. It was clear to the old man, Damian's previous relationship with Violet had changed. From when they first met to now. The two of them the on either side of the same coin. Smiling to him, when a call in. Just as the analysis finished. It was from the Titans. Damian answers it rather reluctant and annoyed.\"Yes? What is it?\" \"Robin, you need to come back NOW!\"It was Starfire. Hearing the urgency in her voice. Something wasn't right.\"And PLEASE bring Batman.\" \"Why? What's wrong?\"Damian question. She wasn't telling him something.\"Starfire!? What is it?!\" There was silence for a couple of seconds.\"It's Violet. She's gone.\" Elsewhere, observing through their crystal sphere at the frantic and confused girl. Who had fled her home, flying alone with her flamed wings. Into the couldn't help but smile. Waving their hands over the sphere, wickedly. \"This easier than I thought.\"They said with a sinister smile.\"Come child. Come child of Belladonna.\"[Chapter 31] It was a cold, very cold and dark night. The moon a rare eclipse in the sky, the barriers between certain worlds thinned and could easily be broken. A day only a select few knew about. A day when life was brought into the world, through union as sinful as it was foul. A shadowy figure desperately ran, determine to put distance between themselves and the horde chasing them. They defended themselves against the evil coming after them. Who too where determine to get back what was their's. But, their thief would not allow them to have it. Not in the least. Using only one hand to shoot mystical blast and defend, while the other held close to their chest what the hordes where after. Summing up enough, they unleash a rather large mystical blast that was able to subdue their pursuers just a bit. While throwing right into a statue. Brushing off the plain, they look up finding themselves in the center of a public park. Under a single light. Looking around, they spot no one. It was empty. Good. They would hate to have to protect someone, while trying to prevent those hordes from getting their hands on what they held. That hadn't yet stopped crying. Casting their eyes down to what they held upon their chest, to be blasted in the back from their few second distraction. Luckily the blast didn't hit what they held. Still it hurt like a mother... Clinging the bundle closer to them, they quickly summon a portal and jump in just in time. Before any of the hordes could come and attack. Exiting the portal finding themselves in much further part of the park. With their shoulder injured, they suddenly felt it being healed and the pain felt slowly beginning to fade. The muffled cries begin to sooth from the bundle. Shocked by this, even when they shouldn't be. Still. Knowing those hordes would be coming soon and relentlessly. They would need both their hands for and would have to place the bundle down. Looking around, their eyes spot a single bench hidden it seemed. Quickly they put the bundle there and cast an enchantment. That would hopefully keep them hidden, while they handled their pursuers and afterwards they could finish what they started. \"...I'll be back.\"They tell the small bundle and quickly move away. Casting an illusion of the bundle back in their arms. Just as the hordes find them. Their glowing purple eyes hiss at their thief who just gives them a cocky smirk.\"Ya wankers want me? Come and get me.\" The hordes give in and leap with fury at the thief, with intent to kill. The thief managed to deflect them and turn tail. Giving chase again, the hordes follow. With everything silent, cold and still. Cries and screams echo in the dark cold night. Nothing but the solace of winter and the cruse of loneliness. They said they would be back, but they never returned. \"Cyborg? Anything?\" Back at the Tower looking up at the multiple screen before him, the mechanical man saw nothing. There was no sign of the girl. From every satellite he managed to access, there was nothing. From face recognition to thermal. Even down to finger prints. He came across nothing. She was completely off the grid. With all eyes of team out there looking, minus Raven who was still in her healing coma. Starfire took the skies for a birds eye view. Blue Beetle was sent to places she associated with. Gar was charged with finding a scent. Nightwing came right away after finding out what happened. He took to searching for his cousin in the darker areas, along with Batman. Who meticulously went over the videos in the Titans Tower that had Violet in them. Studying them. Even going to the scene, her room charred and nearly destroyed. \"...Do you sense her?\"Robin looks to his left, perched on his shoulder Richie. The poor little bird's pain had finally stopped once Violet left. With him, the little bird could sense her presence should they be near enough. But there was clearly no reaction. Nothing. Richie felt nothing. Walking through the slums of a city. Where no doubt would be considered a buffet for Violet. All the negative and depression emotions here. Death no doubt took residence here. People here where nothing but shells of them former selves. It was rather pathetic in his eyes. The streets reek with sicking smells all merged in one. Normally he would want to hurry up out of this place, but it didn't matter about what he wanted. Right now it was about finding Violet. Finding where she is. Where she could be. The second Starfire contacted him and told him the news, he felt something drop inside. No, he felt it shatter. And it hurt. He became angry, arriving back to the Tower. Demanding what happened and accusing Gar for causing Violet's sudden disappearance. When he was more upset at himself. When his eyes saw her destroyed room. Everything nearly melted. The flames, he could see the intensity of the flames used. Fear. rang nothing but fear. Something was unsettling Violet to have this much fear. Something was causing her pain. Something was at foul play here, ever since she started training under Raven. It wasn't that he blamed the demon girl, it was the fact he just hadn't done anything. He could see it in her eyes, even when she tired to hide it. During missions. The way she sat alone. The way she looked at everyone. And yet he just didn't do nothing. Kicking down a molded door, he quickly looks around. Nothing. He swings his staff in frustration, breaking the weak wall that stood. Realizing he was letting his personal feelings cloud him. He drew them back and composed himself. Being upset wasn't going to allow him to think clearly. It wasn't to help in finding her. Damian was scrubbing the floors of the monastery, the monks where in prayer now. And he was stuck with doing the floors. It would have been quite rigorous, if not for so someone humming not to far away. Violet. She too was tasked with cleaning the floor with him. She didn't seem to mind and was less focus than himself in their chore. While he had a scowl on, she managed to have a peaceful smile. Even while the two of them where on their hands and knees. Dressed in nothing but a simple orange robe and sandals. They had only been here for three weeks, since leaving Gotham. The two of them needed to get away and figure things out for themselves. Well at least he did, she just came along saying the same thing. It would have made no sense to force her to go back. He would rather spare himself from anguish tears and refusal. So it was best to allow her to stay. As he scrubbed away, he stops for a couple of seconds and listens closely. From Violet he heard her humming to herself. He scuffs at her attempt to provide a sense of joy to this manual labor. Turning his back, he moves further away. Grumbling to himself about how ridiculous she sounded. To hear her humming was closer. Looking up he finds her by his side. Scrubbing next to him. He was shocked. He didn't sense her coming. \"Must you hum as if this is enjoyable?\"he said irritated. She didn't say anything back and just kept humming, matching his motion with scrubbing. So the two of them would be in sync. Finding it rather annoying, he moves a bit and she follows. He moves a couple of feet away and she just follows. Her humming growing louder and louder. It was soon echoing in through the halls. Groaning to himself, he picks up the speed. Scrubbing harder and harder. Stopping when didn't hear her humming anymore. Looking up he found himself alone in one of the halls. Having been consumed by his irritation of her humming and joyful presence. He completely removed himself. Stopping, he looks down the hall to his left then to his right. It was so quiet. So empty. Not a single sound. With nothing else he picks up his washing brush and starts back up solemnly. Spending the whole day cleaning the floors and status in the temple. He hadn't come across Violet at all. Some of their chores where the same, some of them weren't. Still they would at a least see the other in passing. But he hadn't all day. As night came and dinner was being severed in the meal hall. He still hadn't seen her. He tired not to concern himself, leaving his food nearly uneaten. Making it back to the room, she and him shared. Finding it empty. Untouched. Only the two candles lite the room. Expecting to at least be greeted by her and Richie. Found only the bird nesting in the corner on bundled cloths. Not even the bird looked at him. Going to the single bed in the room, he lays down. Looking up. All day, he hadn't seen Violet. She wasn't here, then where could she be? Tossing and turning, with these thoughts plaguing his mind. Made him irritable and if not frustrated. Sitting up annoyed by his restless state. This girl was causing him more strife, than he needed. If he hurt her feelings, well she was being childish for being bothered by it. Caring less, this would all pass. With that thought he closes his eyes. To open the a few hours later, turning over finding the area next to him empty. Violet hadn't come back. Sitting up and awake now. \"This is ridiculous.\"he groans, pinching his brow. Getting out of bed, opening the door the room and is meet with Dalai Lama carrying in his arms fast asleep. Violet. Damian didn't really know what to say. All the Dalai Lama did was smile kindly at him and pass Violet over into his arms. Bidding the young boy good-night. \"I am glad your sleep will be peaceful now.\"The Dalai said.\"Good-night.\" Watching him walk down the hall and leave, Damian looks back down at Violet. Her sleep seem rather restless too, he could see it. And he felt guilt behind the stoic expression. Turning back around he goes inside and shuts the door. Laying her down on her side, pulling the single cover they share back. He puts her in bed. Going to the other side, he lays to rest too. Closing his eyes, for them to open up again. She was humming in her sleep, again. Silently sighing, he just gets comfortable, closes his eyes and smiles at ease. Whacking down another door, Damian found nothing. Nothing but rats and roaches. Nothing, just like before when found himself alone in the halls of the monastery. He was become more frustrated as time went by, coming up empty. Last time she was found and brought back. This time, this time it didn't seem that way. Though his father was carefully looking over all the videos and information, Damian still felt like he wasn't doing anything. All the research he started to do when he began to suspect something wasn't right. There was still pieces missing. What it was, he just didn't know. And not knowing sat bitterly within him. \"Robin? It's Batman.\"His father contacts him via comlink. Pressing his ear, Robin responds.\"Yes.?\" You where so tired, so very tired. Everything in you hurt and screamed with agony and pain from the sins you felt. Lost in void of endless abyss. Nothing but screeches of the souls. The souls of the tainted. The souls of unfair death. Souls of many, the emotions of it all. Buried you into what seem like a grave. All you could do and see was a void of nothing. Fires of sins and of Hell itself. Your reflection, reflected back nothing. Nothing. Everything hurt, then went numb. All yourself absorbed festered inside. All the evil and sins. Misery and lost. It had to stop. All of this just had to stop. As you laid upon the cold, dirty and filth infested ground. Completely absent, unaware of the approaching figure that managed to find you. They make their way over, reach out a hand... \"Finally..\"[Chapter 32] The smell and sizzle of bacon awoke you from your sleep. A smell that always woke you and brought a smile to you, it was morning. Getting out of bed and pulling back the curtains to let the sun in, bring light into the room and smile. The sky was crystal blue and clear. Even the breeze that came with it, after opening the window. So peaceful and serene. The sun bright in the sky, waking up everyone. You became lost in the scenery, when you heard a knock. You go an answer it, opening the door, finding Raven, dressed and ready.\"Raven. Good morning.\"You give her a morning smile. She smiles back.\"Morning. I came to get you. Breakfast is ready.\"She looks you over, still your pajamas.\"Let me guess..You where daydreaming again. Violet, you need to change. Breakfast is ready and we need to get ready for school.\" Looking down at yourself, still in your pajamas, she was right. You needed to get ready, the clock reading only 45 minutes until school started. You needed to get ready.\"Alright. I'll be done soon. See you at the table.\"Shutting the door. Raven shakes her head. Typical. Her sister with her head up in the clouds, it would take a good five minutes give or take to be ready. If and that was a big if she didn't get distracted. But knowing her sister, she most likely would. Hopefully her breakfast would still be warm by the time she was done. And just as Raven predicted, you came to breakfast a bit later. Dressed and ready for school, just as your plate was ready at the table. Taking your seat across from Raven. Sunny side up eggs, hashbrown, bacon, and waffles. With orange juice. The perfect breakfast, with your family. Raven and Dick. Who was cleaning up the dishes. He cocks his head towards you and flashes you a smile. You smile back. The perfect way to start the morning. Turning back to the food, pick up your fork and eat. \"Violet?.\"Dicks takes his seat next to you. You give him your attention.\"Do you like everything?\"You nod your head, since your mouth was full.\"Good. I'm glad.\" Swallowing the food, you look from Raven and Dick. Both smiling at you, made you happy. It wasn't just good. It was perfect. Perfect. Thick, dark ominous clouds began to cover the skies of red and orange. Blacking the skies. Whipping hollow winds began to spur, crashing waves arose. Thrashing. What seem like a normal natural phenomenon from nature. To the unseen eye was more. It was beautiful. Just pure beauty. Watching the scene of cleansing before them. Humans didn't know. They didn't know what was to befall them. All their sins would cleansed and plagued from this Earthy plane. \"M'Lady, forgive my unpleasant interruption.\"They bow. \"What is it?\"Irritated by their interruption. Despite their sincere apology.\"Can thee see I am enjoying the wonders?\" \"Aye. forgive me mine lady. I just cameth to giveth thee word of thy kin's condition.\" \"And what of mine kin? Clearly the state beest well. Mine kin is doing a grand job.\"She cast her eyes back to the sky.\"Soon. All wilt be darken by the sins of sir. A new day shalt cometh. A world mine kin can liveth in. So what is wrong?\" \"And reports are coming in, these strange weather conditions came out of know where unexpectedly.\" \"Winds and torrents among the seas and water. People are taking shelter. This quite a natural disaster.\" \"Abov-\" All around the global reports came pouring in about the wild winds, darken rain clouds. Typhoons and soon to be natural disasters striking or beginning. For those watching and quickly taking shelter saw this as nothing more than nature acting up. Just signs that was all. Some reports calling it the next El Nino or another Hurricane. It clearly looked like one, a rather great cover up for those not aware. For those who could not see and know what it actually was. Winds filled with spirits of malevolence. Dark clouds of mystery and death. Covering the skies. Lighting of spite and judgment. Striking with warning of the impending doom, soon to follow. Earthquakes, ready to swallow. Tides rising high, to cleanse the world of all its sins. It was coming. And coming fast. Back at the Titan's Tower, Batman having compiled information on what he was given managed to deduce his findings. To the team, including Nightwing. Though excluding Raven, who was still out. \"These symbols.\"Batman brings up strange ancient symbols and similar pictures for the team to see.\"Are symbols used centuries ago. Talked about it in texts. The dove. Olive branch. The most prominent two. It was in the Bible, The Great Flood. God wiped out of man kind to start new. Fresh. To wash away evil and corruption. The sins of man. Themselves. After the flood. God promised to never again do such a thing.\" \"So are you saying, just throwing this out here.\"Gar thinks for a second.\"The Flood is happening again? How is this caused by Vi?\" \"Batman, what does this have to do with my cousin? Violet?\"Nightwing looks to him.\"Well?\" Batman didn't answer them, instead someone else did. \"It as sure bloody hell does. It always has.\"A gruff and cynical voice with a thick Welsh accent. Along with a strong stench of cigarettes. Everyone turns behind them, seeing a small little light approaching. Footsteps approached.\"That's what to expect from Nephalems. Bastard offsprings really.\"From the hall steps a ridgy, gruff man. Wearing a long brown trench coat, dirty blonde hair, dark cynical blue eyes, a five o'clock shadow. Broad scowl, smoking a cigarette which he puts out. Flicking it to the floor and takes out another one lighting it. Not even caring. Eyes on his him, he stares right pass them at the Batman.\"Constantine.\" The man known as Constantine, takes a puff before answering.\"You know none of this is in your area. And yet you still put your head in what doesn't belong. I shouldn't be surprised really.\" \"Excuse,\"Starfire interrupts.\"You said something. About Violet. Nephalems.\" Constantine eyes light up, eyeing her with pleasure.\"That I did.\"He steps to her, she moves back uncomfortable. Nightwing steps in-between them, glaring hard at the man. Who clearly understood and backed up. \"Might want to enjoy that before every thing is washed away.\"he said.\"Never know when it might be the last you taste.\"He takes another puff, to quickly move out the way from Nightwing's punch.\"Careful, you almost made me drop it.\"He fixes his cigarette. Straightening out his coat.\"Better put a leash on your pup.\"Looking to Batman. \"Nightwing. Enough.\"Batman commands.\"Everyone, this is John Constantine. He dabbles in occults.\" \"Occults?\"Gar looks at the man.\"You sure don't look like someone mysterious. Are you a demon too?\" John slides his eyes over to the teen.\"Aren't you smart.\"Looking to the screen of images Batman had.\"You might be the World's Greatest Detective, but you as sure in hell didn't even scratch the surface. The Dove? The Olive branch? All those are nothing, you didn't even look further. What you found here is nothing. Nothing but rubbish. Nothing but what was long gone. While you dwindle on hopeless symbols of a life past.\" Tip of cold steel pressed upon his throat.\"You're blabbering is nothing but meaningless words.\"Damian said.\"What are you talking about?\" John looks at him. Unfazed by the glare the boy was giving. Looking over him to his father, while stepping away from the blade.\"As I was saying, this is just rubbish. God promising never to again bring another flood. He said it, but doesn't mean others won't. In all their beauty, they see nothing but sins and plagues. Hard to believe such holiness is tainted. If you think it's the Great Flood reappearing, you're dead wrong. It ain't anything of the such. It's a wee bit bigger than that.\" \"What are you talking about?\"Having enough of his cryptic words, Nightwing grabs him by the coat.\"You're not making any sense. Do you know something about Violet or not?\" John takes another puff and blows it right into his face.\"Yeah. I do. You want to know?\"Testing Nightwing's patience.\"Alright then, I'll tell you. It's really simple really. You're cousin, as you so say. You're teammate, friend, family...\"he looks to Damian.\"Affection. Since her birth, I've been trying to exorcise her damned plague from existence.\" I'm sorry if this chapter isn't that good.[Chapter 33] After well delicious breakfast made by Dick, you and Raven head to school. The sun was shinning perfectly, you both greet the neighbors as you walk.\"Violet, stay on the sidewalk.\"Raven tells you, moving you away and switching sides. \"Sorry.\"you apologize.\"I wonder what's going to happen today at school? Do you think the others will be there today? I know Jaime wasn't feel well. I hope they are, it's suppose to be the school's big game, coming up. So there's going to be a assemble in the quad.\" \"I'm sure he is. Isn't the dance tonight?\"she brings up. You knew where she was going with this. Your cheeks turn red before she could even say it.\"Are you still going with Damian?\" You look away bashfully and twiddle with your thumbs.\"Well...umm...yeah. Yes. I mean we're still going. What about you?\" She just shrugs her shoulders.\"I'm fine either way. So have you even picked out your dress yet?\"By your silence she knew you hadn't.\"I'm not surprised really. It's a good thing though, mom and I made sure to pick out a dress we think you will like.\" \"Really?\"You where rather surprise.\"When?\" Raven flips out her phone and quickly sends a text.\"About two weeks ago, when you where doing study over Damian's place. Mom asked if you had your dress, I told her no and well..we went shopping.\" \"Sorry, if I put you two through so much.\"you apologize. She just smiles at you and pats your head.\"That's fine. That's what older sisters are for anyway. You'd be lost without.\" That you had to agree on.\"I guess I would.\" \"Raven! Violet!\" Gar waves to you both at the doors of the school. Waiting with Jaime and Damian. You wave back estacticly.\"Hey!\"You and your sister meet up with them.\"Good morning.\" \"Morning.\"Jaime smiles.\"We thought you wouldn't make it in time.\" \"We did. I'm so happy you're well Jaime.\"you smile, then turn to Damian and throw your arms around him.\"Hello Damian!\" He just smirks and hugs you back.\"Morning Violet. Are you ready for the dance tonight?\" Nodding your head.\"Yes. I can't wait.\"You squeal, jump up and down.\"It's going to be so perfect.\" You hear him chuckle from your excitement, that he couldn't help but add more to it. And picks you up and spins you around quickly.\"Then it's going to be even more perfect. My dad was able to put in a special surprise. Well I asked him.\"He puts you down. This was a treat and you wanted to know.\"What is it?\" \"You'll have to wait till this evening. When everything comes.\"he said, just as the bell rang. \"Guess we better go.\"Gar thumbs over his shoulder.\"Can't believe late.\" Everyone agrees, Damian takes your hand in his and takes you to class. Nightwing punched John square in the jaw and would have done more if not for Cyborg keeping him back. The enraged hero did not take kindly to what the man said. To which John didn't care. There was a little bit of blood that trickled from the corner of his mouth, but he just wipes it away. \"That was a pissy hit.\"he scrutinizes Nightwing.\"I know old women who hit harder.\" Nightwing was about to give him another but Cyborg held him at bay.\"You son of a bitch!\"Nightwing hollers. Angry and disgusted. Straightening out his coat, John turns a ignoring shoulder to him and talks back to Batman. Who was shocked himself of what John said, though didn't show it like the others.\"What did you mean by that?\"he ask, tries to mask his own personal feelings.\"You've been trying to exorcise her? Since she was born?\" Lighting another cigarette and taking two puffs, John speaks.\"Honestly, I don't see why I need to explain myself. If what's happening needs to b stopped. This is a waste of my bloody time.\" Feeling Damain's blade again on his throat.\"Because you have less then a minute to explain.\"He threatens. Pressing harder.\"What do you know!?\"He demands.\"What does this have to do with Violet?! Where is she?!\" \"Damian. Calm down.\"His father tells him. Which was the last thing he should have done.\"Why should I? This idiot of a man, can't even give out simple information which I know is very crucial right now.\"He snaps back.\"So I ask again, what do you know?!\" John wasn't stupid, behind Robin's enraged demand, he saw where his anger was really steaming from. The way he held the hilt of his blade, it shook a bit. His clenched teeth tremble, his muscles tighten. His grip on the hilt was like a python. John knew those eyes, he knew well. He could almost sympathize with the boy. Almost. Starfire comes to make the piece.\"Damian. Call down.\"She tells him. Placing a hand upon his shoulder, carefully squeezing it. Telling him to calm down. Damian didn't want too. But...did. She thanks him, then turns to John, her eyes glowing fiercely.\"...\"Demanding him he tell what he knows. While at the same time angered from what he said. \"Touchy.\"John said, taking another puff.\"But fine, ya want to know about your friend? Fine then...It's really simple even a dodo can follow it.\"Moving the blade away.\"I've been trying to exorcise her since the beginning. Her union was a foul one. Offspring of a demon and even worse a fallen.\" \"Fallen?\"Jaime repeats not understanding. \"Fallen, a fallen angel.\"John explains.\"Well a descendants of one at least. Everyone's heard of Lucifer. The right hand of God. The most beautiful angel. Cast out by the Holy Man himself.\" Gar interrupts.\"Violet is Lucifer's daughter?\"Jaime hushes him. \"No.\"John tells him with a irritated look.\"There's more than one fallen angel in the world. In fact there are many. Though very few actually act. The one I'm talking about deems themselves as above the divine will. Lahashs. Nasty things. As beautiful and holy. They are most tainted of them all. They have come to believe they in their eyes, everything corrupt. And doing the Holy Man's bidding. You thought it was a flood they're trying to recreate?\"He scuffs at Batman, looking at the hero.\"Not even close, they want to bring the day of reckoning. Apocalypse. Not when the Holy Man wants. No, they've already given their judgement and in their terms. Want to cleanse the world of such impurities. Will be welcomed back into the Holy Lands. That's where the little offspring comes in.\" \"Are you saying that,\"Starfire speculates, gasping upon realizing.\"These Lahashs are like Trigon is with Raven?\" John chuckles rudely and sharply replies.\"We're ya not listening? They don't want to rule this world. Naw.\"He shakes his head.\"They want to end it. All of it. Cast every si single person and their soul away. No souls to Heaven. No souls to Hell. They will trap those souls in endless damnation.\" \"Complete annihilation.\"Batman says simply. He turns back to the compute and brings up the incoming reports of the strange natural phenomenal happening. Raging winds and thrashing waves. Heavy storms, that blew others away. \"Damn.\"John clicks his tongue.\"Their starting already. You want to know want to know why I need to exorcise your cousin?\"He shoots a sharp glare at Nigthtwing and points to the screen.\"That's why. This is why. When two evils come together, the sire something much worse. One able to feed off the vile emotions on this planet. And consume the souls in the processes. She's Pandora's Box, but reversed.\" \"She's the one...They're using Violet-\" John says it bluntly.\"To be their sacrifice. Once she's done for what she's been created for, a pure world. The sins of others will reside within her, sins that will bury her forever in damnation. And everyone else.\" A heavy silence fell in the room. No one knew what to say. What could they say, after what John told them. The way he made it sound, was there was literally no way to even prevent or save Violet. She would be exorcised by John meaning she would cast down to Hell. Or from her maternal side, she will lost forever. She was sired from two twisted dark visions. Tainted with their blood of sins and death. Neither of them good and produced an offspring just the same. Their union was nothing but their benefit only. It just didn't make sense, to any of them. The Violet they knew seem the complete opposite of what she was. And made from. Then again could all be a fake? Did she knew now? Was just nothing but a Judas? All these questions begin to pile up, but one thing that didn't make sense, someone had to say it. \"If she's what you say?\"Damian steps to John.\"Then how was she able to be born a human? What part of her history do you play in? Because it sounds to me, that you clearly know her and have known her from years. Yet you hadn't bothered to do as so claim to do. Exorcise her. You clearly had adamant amount of time. So why didn't you?\" Nightwing realizing he was right.\"Yeah. Why didn't you?\"Giving John a look to choose his next words carefully. But the man was unfazed. His eyes harden and become defensive.\"This ain't about me!\"He lashes and quickly regains himself.\"Right now, stopping what soon to come is more important.\"He takes out the cylinder container he took from the crime scene. Gar recognizes the name.\"Hey? That's from that cafe Raven and Violet would go to all the time...and that's Violet's favorite flavor.\" \"You are sharp.\"He said sarcastically.\"Nightshade, moonseed, black locust, powder Deadly nadder scales and a few drops just to sweeten it komodo dragon saliva. Yeah, her favorite drink. Everything I just named has been given to her. A combination like this can put one like herself twist the mind and soul. Bring her into a deep sleep, similar to Sleeping Beauty. The only problem with it, there ain't no happy ending. It's nothing but pure poison. And with the right help and enchantment she's by far long gone.\" He tosses the canister to Batman.\"Don't even bother.\"John read what he was thinking.\"There ain't know way she's coming back from. It's been given to her little by little for a long period of time. If she was full blooded then it would only have a minor effect, but since she's not. Well, better start making her eulogy.\" Cyborg quickly held Nightwing's enraged punch on John. Telling him to clam down.\"Don't you dare say that!\"Nightwing lashes at him.\"Violet's my cousin. She's my family. I will SAVE her.\" \"Then you're a much bigger idiot than I thought.\"John said coldly. Turning back to the screen. Looking at the natural disasters, his eyes saw what the others couldn't see and it tormented and pained him. There was no time to feel conflicted, with very little time to do what needed to be done. He had to make right what he couldn't, years ago. With Belladonna all these years, she's waited. He thought by removing her kin, he could stop it. Stealing from her to prevent it. Banishing them, but it was a weak one. This world needed to be cleansed. Smoothing she brushes your hair. \"My dear kin, thoust have done a deed more Holy than ever.\"she whisper gently.\"This world will be cleansed and all shall be right.\" \"Violet!?\"Raven's eyes shoot open in horror and fear.\"Violet.\"[Chapter 34] School ended and like always you meet up with the others in the front. This time you had something wonderful to show them, your perfect score on your Math test. Waving it in the air proud and eager. \"Look!\"You show them, thrusting the paper in Raven's face.\"I passed my Math test!\" Unable to read the score, your sister pushes it just a bit out of her face and looks at it. Smiling at what she saw.\"Good job. Perfect score.\" \"Alright.\"Jaime ruffles your hair playfully. Making you smile and push him off.\"There are some brains in behind that cute face.\" \"Very funny Jaime.\"you giggle. Fending off his hand.\"I just studied really hard.\" Damien looks at the test.\"You should feel proud of yourself.\"He praises, smiling handing back.\"I know I am.\"He leans in to give you a kiss on the cheek, when a horn honks. Everyone looks, Alfred was there ready to pick him up.\"Must he always interrupt.\"He groans. Shaking his head smiling to himself, casting his eyes back to you.\"I suppose I must go. I'll see you all tomorrow. Get home safely.\"Giving your hand a affectionate squeeze leaves. \"See you tomorrow Damien.\"you wave, watching him get in. He flashes you a smile with a wink.\"Tell your dad I said hello! And your mother too! Hello Alfred.\" The man nods and smiles before getting into the car and driving off. Once Damien left the rest of you begin to walk home. Four soon became two, just you and Raven. Your mouth was like a motor chattering away about everything, sharing a few laughs. Raven listen with love and kindness. A soft smile on her, becoming brighter with everywhere word that came out of your mouth. \"Raven? Could you help me with my Biology homework?\"you ask.\"Please?\" \"Sure.\"She agrees.\"I don't mind.\"Taking out the house key, walking up the stairs. She was the one given the key to the house, you'd get your's when you where a little older. Entering, Dick wasn't home. He must still be at work. Glancing at the clock, it read 3:24. He should be getting off in just a bit. Around four. Being a police officer. With him not home, you and Raven knew what to do. Take out homework and get started. Though there wasn't to be television, you would have it on in the back just for noise. Which would end up turning into watching it. Still, you would get your work done. Going to the family room, using the coffee table. Clearing everything off and taking out what you needed to do. Raven was in the kitchen getting some snacks, calling from there asking what you wanted. Which you would respond the a can of Strawberry soda and slice of pie. Dick always made the best blueberry pie. While you sister was busy getting everything together, you got up and went to the bathroom. Walking down the hall like always, something suddenly didn't feel right. No. That wasn't it. It was something else. A...A voice...It sounded like a weak and faint voice. Calling to you. Saying your name. Or at least you thought it was, looking around you found no one. There was no one around. Reaching for the door knob, stepping foot into it, it became distorted for a second. And you felt this painful and evil presence. For a split second it attacked your heart, that it nearly caused you to scream in agony. \"Violet.\"Raven suddenly appears behind you holding your plate of pie, smiling.\"I have your slice. Ready to get started?\" Her presence was refreshing and that pain just dispersed. Forgetting why you needed to go to the bathroom, take the plate and smile back.\"Yeah. I am.\"She begins to led you back to the family room.\"Hey, if we finish early, maybe we can surprise Dick with making dinner tonight.\" \"Sounds like a great idea.\" The winds swept nearly everything up, a man screaming for his life gets taken by the wind.\"Hold on!\"Wonder Woman uses her lasso on him, saving the man's life. It was nearly a struggle against nature. To keep him from flying off. Getting him the ground she manages to find a spot that would keep him some what grounded. To hurry and save another civilian. It just didn't stop. These winds just kept coming and coming. Becoming more powerful by the second, she could barely feel herself breath. It was like cold, death air. As if something was sucking the life away. The weather phenomenal weren't just happening where she was. It was all around the around from what the news had reported. And kept doing so. Mortals. The League had been spread out to deal with this. To help and save as many lives that they could, while trying to figure out what was happening. Not liking the fact she couldn't do anything. There was nothing she could fight against to put an end to it all. Made her frustrated. Still, she couldn't let her personal feelings get in the way. These people needed her. Quickly drawing her blade slashes flying debris, saving another.\"GO!\"she orders them and hurries to the next one. Having not gotten a page or call from anyone else, on their condition told her. They had their hands full as well, slashing another. She stands her ground strong and firmly. When to shock and surprise what was now falling down from the skies. Fire. Fire spewing, like meters. Flaming meters. They didn't seem big at first, but their power was triple their size. Leaving a crater in its wake. It seem like something out of a movie. No. Out of a text. Where was this raining fire coming from? All of this? Her mind trying to deuce it all, but she was no Batman. He would have answer to this. If only he where here or would pick up. But the brooding man hadn't at all. She wasn't sure if he had become a victim of this all, then again that was a very long shot. He was Batman. She believed he might have started saving others. Though knowing the man, coming to the most logical conclusion. He knew what was going on. That had to be the reason. Batman knew what was happening. And like because he knew and hadn't informed the League meant one thing. It was personal. Deflecting debris with her shield, to be knocked back by the gust of wind and slammed threw a building. Quickly she picks herself back up and charges to defend and protect. Back at the Tower, everyone was gone. Everyone except Raven, having awoke. Saw the destruction before her eyes. Her eyes saw what the norm could not. She saw humans and their souls being taken and consumed. This world being ravaged. The dark heavy clouds, dark as humanities sins. Covering all the sky and light. The crashing waters of distortion, ready to cleanse this world. She could feel the Earth shake with anger and vengeance. She could see it all and feel it. Feel the evil in this world become swallowed up. Their presence, she could sense much better. They weren't hiding anymore. This feeling. This power was strong, evil yet pure. It was just twisted. Purely twisted. \"Violet...\" With herself healed enough, she waste no time to prepare. Teleporting to her room, grabs what she needed. Drawing a magical circle to start. Sets down the necessary items. Stepping in the center she sits as if mediating. Murmuring to herself sends out her soul self. Sending across the vast world. Her eyes see everything, every horrific site. Though they where cause of her concern, it was not her full concern. Pushing herself harder and more. Keeping her mind clear and focus, reaches. Gasping at what she saw, though was not that surprise. Doing her best to keep her anger in control. Her sister before her eyes unconscious, no mystically being tampered with. This was an enchantment she could feel it. A strong one. She just hoped what she put on her sister would hold. Hold for a little longer, needing to wake her. She dives in, hopefully unseen. Undetected. Into Violet's psyche and it was just as she feared and knew. Everything was being fabricated. Her sister imprisoned in a mind of lies while unleashing her darkness. Raven sends her soul to alert the younger sister, to be blocked by psyche shield. Meant to keep her out and preventing her from interfering. It would be foolish try and over and over again without her giving herself away. Then, if she didn't present herself to break just a little bit of this hold upon Violet, she would before consumed and lost. While it gave her what she wanted, it was killing her, causing her to commit horrible acts. Damming her soul. \"Azar bring the the truth of light to the darkness. Show and break through the walls of lies, to relinquish the hold. Make myself known, known to her.\" Her soul self shots it self in one direct spot. With this few seconds open, she does the one thing she could do before being cast out.\"Violet! Lies! Violet!\" \"AH!\"Raven's soul violently returns back to her, throwing her hard across the room and out of the circle. Breaking her bookcase. A couple fall on her, but she pays them no mind. Catching her breath, slightly weaken from that attack. Holding her head, she felt a bit of blood from the attack. Attacking her both mentally and physically. There was spite and anger in their attack. It was not a warning. No. It was death. Death marked on her. If she hadn't reconnected herself, she surely would have lost. And so would her sister. Shaking her head, to regain her presence and sense. She saw them, the one doing this to her sister. Now it became clear, she remembered them. It made sense why they seem similar to those from Azarath. Why it left her rather confused. Recalling the information about them, from the elders and in the books. Now, there was a reason to worry. A reason to do all she could to save her sister. Angry more so at Trigon, who know doubt was smiling pleased. It sicken her, but she kept her composer. Walking back to the magical circle, focusing her mind. \"...I invoke the powers of Azar..\"she begins. A energy disc emerges and out steps John with the others. Gar nearly got taken away by the winds, Jaime held him down. The winds where the strongest here, meaning this was the right place. With winds whipping like this, made it rather hard to talk and hear. \"Where are we?!\"Starfire ask yelling. Looking around, barely able to see anything. Though John seem somewhat unaffected. \"Damn winds...\"he grumbles irritated.\"Can't even lite.\" The winds kick up more, in defense and anger. He knew right away, they where aware of their presence and knew he was here. He couldn't help but smile.\"Hell have no fury...\" \"John!\"Batman yells to get his attention, the man looks at the knight. Who by look alone demands he tell everyone. When something caught his eyes, along with another. Casting his eyes upward high above in the sky, lighting striking over and over again, in what seem to be some sort of dark swirl cocoon. Absorbing every thing while seeming the conduit no doubt. \"Violet!\"Nightwing yells, his emotions took over causing him to rush towards it. To be harshly smacked back by the wind. Starfire managed to catch him. All eyes look up.\"She's in there.\"John confirms.\"Looks like we're a bit late. MOVE!\"He alerts everyone quickly managing to cast a protective shield to deflect the sudden attack. Everyone nearly ended up separating, Damian knocked off the roof onto the ground below with Cyborg, the two of them manage to catch themselves. Batman with his guard up, while waiting to see who just attacked. John stood up dusting himself off while still maintain the shield. Greeting the one before him casually, with a mocking grin.\"Well, hello there love. Been along time.\" \"Who the heck is that?\"Jaime asked himself confused and in awe. While aiming his cannon at the male before him. They clearly weren't human, their pale white hair gave them away, along with their smooth porcelain skin. Their eyes, this guys eyes where the same color as Violet's. But what really separated them from being distinguish, the black ink wings upon their backs and golden markings along their body. They did look rather handsome, but that vile look in their eyes said otherwise. All eyes land upon the one in front of John glaring with murderous and unforgiving eyes. Ready to slaughter him. The calm fury upon her lovely face. Told them she was no one to be reckon with. Her wings flared out. Made her look bigger than her actual size. Draped in angelic linen dress. Elegantly wrapped around her. Leaving her back exposed and slit on her left showing her leg. Her long pale white hair smooth as silk blew in the violent wind. It was like the wind was speaking her anger and rage towards the man. \"John Constantine.\"she said spite in her words and voice. Raising a hand and strikes the shield he had up, shattering it. John stood there unfazed. Adding more to his arrogance, with the smirk he had. Only angered her more. Looking at her hand, John shakes his head.\"Ah, love you've gone and messed up that pretty hand of yours. Shame really, it was really good. Love that hand. Was my favorite. Now then,\"he steps to her.\"I've come to take back, what I didn't finish. Belladonna.\"[Chapter 35] Dinner was great, you and Raven managed to pull it off and finish homework. Before Dick came back, he was surprised from what the two of you did and grateful. Calling himself the luckiest person in the world. The three of you sat around the table laughing and talking about the day. Dick did bring up about the dance, which you where clearly excited about. Made him happy, Raven though did tease you a bit. Once dinner was over, you offered to do the dishes, Raven and Dick went to go and take their showers. Leaving you all alone, humming merrily to yourself. Washing and putting the dish on the disk rack. Everything was quiet except the running of the water and crickets outside in the dark. Putting a plate on the rack, some whispers your name. \"Hmmm...Hello?\"You stop and look around, finding no one. So you go back to cleaning, when you hear your name again. This time you felt the presence of someone. That you dropped the cup, it shattered snapping you back.\"Oh.\"Quickly you go and clean up, standing back to be startled. You nearly screamed, seeing the strange hood presence out the window staring at you. Was it a ghost? You weren't sure, it just stood there calling out to you. It's hand reaching for you. This just had to be some sort of dream. Slowly you step back, the presence phases through the window, sink still reaching for you. Calling to you. Saying you name over and over again. Like a warning it seem. There didn't seem to be anything threatening coming from it. In fact it felt rather familiar and comforting. That you stopped backing up, the figure stopped too. Swallowing hard, still holding the broken cup. Boldly speak to it. \"Y-Yes...?\" It didn't speak this time, instead just had its hand out towards you. Wanting you to take. Seemingly pleading and begging. Though you knew you shouldn't, something in the back of your mind told you to. It seem like the right thing, even if you refused. Reluctant at first, your hand slowly inches it way towards, when suddenly there came an Earthquake. It was rather violent, knocking you over to the floor. Rattling the house. The presence suddenly became alarmed and rushes to protect you. Though before they could get you, the ground splits open all of sudden and you fall down and scream. \"Violet! Wake up!\"You hear Raven call for you, she was shaking you awake. Your eyes shoot open in a panic, if not for Raven you would surely would have started attacking. But she restrains you, calming you down. Telling you to calm down and that everything was alright. \"Vi! Vi! It's alright.\"Dick said, coming over and taking your hand. Assuring you everything was alright. Slowly you come back to your senses and find yourself in a hospital. In a room, on the bed. With them around you. Holding your head, which you find was wrapped. What was going on? What just happened? What was happening, everything seem to feel dizzy and confusing. Raven slowly lays you back down, fluffing your pillow. Knowing they both where here was sort of a relief. Still, what happen to that...dark hooded presence? \"You hit your head.\"Dick tells you. You look at him to explain.\"There was an earthquake and you tripped hitting your head. Raven came out first and saw you. She tended to you and called me. We called 911, the ambulance came and brought you to the hospital. You've been out for a few hours. The doctors say there isn't much to worry about. But, they want to keep you for a few days to make sure.\"He gently lays a hand on your head. Tears formed in his eyes.\"We thought we lost you.\" He gives you a soft smile, if you didn't seem or feel so confused you would return it. Looking to Raven, she seem tired but, like Dick was happy you where alright.\"...\"That earthquake, when it came, you felt something. Something that seem to bother you. Was it just your eyes? Because you remember seeing fractions of strange things. Images really. Of another world...life...you couldn't really make it out. Before you blacked out. What was going on? You wondered. Closing your eyes, you hear your name again and they shoot open. Looking around finding your family gone and at the side of your bed. That presence again. They did this to you. \"GO AWAY!\"you lash out at them, if you weren't in your condition right now. You sure would have tired to hit them.\"LEAVE ME ALONE!\" They just stayed there, ignoring your anger and held their hand out once again for you to take. Urging you too. Calling your name, it sounded like crying. Yet, there where no tears. None at all. Why where all of sudden sad? Was this thing crying for you? What for? Looking at their hand, that awaited for you take it. Slowly you reach out towards it, about to hold it...\"Violet!\"Damian comes rushing in, causing the presence to disappear. You try to reach out, telling it to wait. But it faded. Damian hugs you tightly.\"Tell me you're alright?\" You heard his question. Which made you think, where you really alright? John managed to move out the way from Belladonna's vicious attack. He was lucky too, because that would have cut him in two. Staying on his toes, he narrowly dodges the other attacks. Keeping his cool, hiding behind a broken wall. \"Can't believe she's still upset.\"He mumbles to himself. His eyes shoot up to the black concentrated darkness. That was his real target. He just needed a way to get there. And all this could end, having what he needed to end it all. But, Belladonna made sure this time to make precaution.\"Crafty one...\" \"JOHN!\"he hears her screeching yell. There was death in words, he knew it. She was going to kill him, before her kin did.\"Show thy self? Constantine! South I may personally pass thy judgement! Your soul shall burnth in fires of Hell and thy soul ripped apart for such a sinful action!\" Keeping himself quiet, the ground shakes. She must have landed and wasn't that far. He had to remain calm, should she sense him. In all this chaos. Knowing what he knew about her, she wasn't one to play around with. She was sharp, calculating and ruthless. Despite her charming look. Trying to fool her wouldn't go well. Thinking quickly, he moves just in time. Just as her hand thrust through the wall and rips it down. She narrowly grabbed and ripped the end of his coat. John looks at it.\"Ah! Ya know how much that cost?\"He shouts. Giving her a smirk.\"But, that's alright, I forgive ya. It's what he'd want.\"Thumbing over his shoulder at picture of Jesus. Which only enraged the woman, expecting her to attack. She doesn't and quickly calms herself. Which surprised him.\"I know thy trickery.\"Pointing a finger at him. Her face was like steel.\"Thy silver tongue will do nothing. It might have worked in the past, given the pleasure. But, it shall be ripped out.\" Acting like he was hurt.\"Wound me why won't ya? Love? You want my tongue that bad? Ya missed it that much?\"He smirks seductively.\"Then all you had to do was ask. I wouldn't mind giving it to you again.\"Sending her an air kiss. Angered the woman, even if she kept a cold face. The debris began to levitate all around.\"Thou where nothing but a toy for my amusement. Thou did not even quench me.\"Smirking. \"Hey! That's was uncalled for!\"he snaps, genuinely angry by what she said.\"You truly are a bi-\" The levitating attacks him, he managed to put up a shield just in time. When he realized it was only meant for a distraction, and quickly had to switch up his plan. Just as she came, her nails cut through his side. If closer, she would have gutted him like a fish. Landing and holding his side, he felt the blood coming out. \"Damn.\"he hisses to himself. Looking at the wound. It was bad, but he's had worse. Standing up, forming fire in his hand so he cauterize it. When suddenly his body felt numb. Falling to his side, he managed to catch himself.\"Wha...?\" Hearing her approach him, she kicks him square under his chin, sending him crashing through the other side. In a flash, she was by him and picks the man up by his throat with ease. Enjoying his suffering. Her hand begin to crush his throat. Watching struggle like an insect. \"I've poisoned thou John.\"she gloats.\"Tis easy. Really.\"Holding up her sharp nails.\"You know how good I am with mystical herbs and herbs alike. Tis my special. The toxin I've given you John...has already seeped into your blood stream and attacked the nerves in your body. Shutting them down. Confusing your mind. Giving your body a stroke and heart attack. Surely, thou can feel their chest tighten.\" John coughs ups some blood and reacts to his heart tightening. His body not responding nor could he do anything to prevent it. He had to admit, it was rather crafty of her. He was rather impressed. Despite it all, he manages a smirk and scuffs. Right then she realized...when his body suddenly explodes. The place falls on top. \"That was too easy.\"John said, running up the stairs to the top of the church. The right church. He needed to reach the top. Tricking that woman was always too easy. Way to easy. A simple doppelganger did the trick. With the right incantation. It was pulled off with finesse. Reaching the latch that led to the roof, he pushes it open wasting no time. Taking from his coat, chains. Special kind of chains, he only had a little bit of time to do this. While the others battled Belladonna's kind, keeping them preoccupied. He could focus on this. Putting the chains in a circle, he takes out something else to make the right markings, signs and symbols. Though with these winds, it made it rather difficult. \"John?\"Batman contacts him, via ear piece. Hearing the man grunting.\"What's your status?\" \"I just finished the circle. I've got to do the incantation. So if you ya don't mind...\"John ends it and goes back to what he was doing. Though he felt himself rushing, he knew, he had everything. Looking up at the dark cocoon in the sky.\"Would have been much easier, when you ya were younger.\" Focusing back, hands out he starts. First binding the chains so they would not be moved. Branding the roof. It flashed and started to pulsate a glow.\"Alright then...\" \"Shrouds rejiciuntur, servus est malum, in lucem emittere. Da initium, do coram te.\"He speaks. Causing the circle to inflame and brighten. He was nearly done. When he hears Belladonna's raging scream through the winds. The whole place felt like it shook. She comes bursting out from the rubble, screeching filling the skies that it halted them for a second. Her eyes burning with rage and vengeance. Seeking out John for his trickery. And she finds him. Doing what he does best, pissing her off. Blinding by her rage she flies straight for him like a heat seeking missile. Gathering and forming energy around her, uncontrollable and dark. Like a wild fire, her speed was too great. Starfire who had managed to knock back her opponent goes to stop the woman, only to be quickly dealt with. Slashed badly on the side, the alien falls from sky. Luckily Cyborg managed to catch her, looking her over. Opening her mouth, Belladonna unleashes a thick, dark smoke that transforms into something hideous and vile. It was gross, that Gar squirmed at the sight. Blue Beetle nearly gagged. The creature, whatever it was lands on the roof just a few feet from John. Let's out a might roar and goes to attack the man. Raising its sludge arm, bringing it down like a hammer, for it to be deflected back. It screams in pain. He put up a shield. She saw, landing down, quickly deciphering what kind of spell he used against her creature. She knew for one, it wasn't strong as he was putting most of his energy in the incantation. Realizing this, was a good thing. Smirking to herself. She figures out what to use against it, chanting to herself her energy attacks the shield and breaks it. Leaving John wide open. And he knew it too. Forcing himself to rush, feeling her presence upon him. Death loomed over him, just as he finished. Opening his eyes activating it, just she was over him ready to strike him. When she was blinded by solid kick square in her jaw. It was strong, that it sent her back and over the side. The kick belonged to Robin. Dropping down, standing protectively before John. His katana out, stance firm and strong. Eyes focused where he kicked the woman. John was rather surprise, the boy was the last he'd expect to be here. Expecting more so Batman or Nightwing. Not Robin. \"Don't just stop.\"Robin snaps at him.\"Hurry the hell up and get Violet.\" Just as he said that, Belladonna comes back. Glaring hard the pint size hero, her fury and hatred now included Robin.\"Thou mere mortal struck me? How thee!\" Robin didn't care what she said.\"Get off your damn HIGH horse.\"Raising his blade.\"You won't get through me. I'll cut you down and make you a flightless bird.\" His insolence was disgusting and rude. She was not going to allow a mere child talk to her that way. Did the boy not realize whom he was dealing with? Searching his eyes and through him, to her surprise, he had no fear of her. Instead there was his passion. This passionate rage and anger. She could nearly taste it. It was delightful. Holding out her hand she conjures up a board sword and attacks him. She was quick, Robin just barely managed to defend himself. She pushes him back and switches to hurling magical energy blast. He dodges it, staying on his toes. Not letting his guard down, she comes and strikes him again with her blade. He blocks it. She twist and conjures in her another hand a long blade. He narrowly dodges, having only his cape ripped. Still, his defense remained strong. She comes at him, again and again at all angles. He wasn't stupid, he knew she was stronger than him and could easily kill him. But, she was toying with him. To her it was entertaining in a sick twisted way. While she smirk with each strike, his anger towards her deepen. Recalling all that John told them. This woman was just as vile as Violet's father. Neither of them cared, only cared for their selfish reasons and wants. Meaning, Violet's existence was...purposeless. Unlike her sister, who had at least one caring parent. Just like himself, Violet had neither. Despite, this woman being \"kind\" enough to prevent her child from feeling the pain and suffering as she died. This woman was going to have her child take blame for everything. In order...in order to be seen in a better light. He now saw why their kind was part of the Fallen. If he was God himself, he would have kicked them out too. Their misguided and vile divine judgement was nothing but twisted sight. It was because of their tainted union that produced...no. he refused to think that. Violet wasn't anything like those who spawned her. When they first meet, Robin remembered the two of them seem at odd. But, she welcomed him with kindness. He found her rather strange, the two of them started off distance but eventually grew close. Becoming each others first friends. He didn't realize what was stirring in those feelings. Until he thought he lost her. Stabbed right through the heart. He had to give her up, in order to save. Wanting her to remain safe. For her to find her way back to him and aid him again. To almost lose her again. Again by the hands he created, from the choices he made. Which made him come to is own conclusion, he didn't deserve her, and left her to be safe. And yet she followed him. He was against it, but at the same time it gave him joy. Even if he hide it. The two of them had much to work on. They truly did become closer friends. He knew the two of them both wanted to be free and figure out their own way. Improve themselves. Though when she left him, it hurt him deeply more than he dare to ever admit. He became angry at her and lashed out all of it. His confusion. Sorrow. Pain. Everything. Not seeing the reason why. Until it was too late. She dragged to Hell. Turned into someone...no something he didn't know. It wasn't the person he'd grown to... She was saved from Hell, like her sister. But, she all that happened, damaged her more. She begin to hate herself and he couldn't help but feel responsible for it. \"I'll take the darkness away.\" He remembers her words. Words she promised to do. And she had, he was grateful until he realized. The darkness she took, she kept inside. The changes she was going through, he noticed but could not bring himself to do anything. For his own guilt prevented him. It caused distance and friction between them. He was letting her walk by herself, to deal with it all alone. While he stood there watching it. And now. Now she was swallowed up by the darkness because he didn't act. Not this time. He wasn't going to stand by, he was going to act and everything in his power to get her back. He would figure out a way to save her from darkness, like she did for him. Even if it meant him dying. With ever sheer ounce of his strength, he was going to break her out and bring her back. The two of them would be together again. Just like before. This woman. She didn't deserve Violet. Not as mother. Not as kin. Not as anything. Violet was nothing like them. He wasn't going to allow her to use Violet. Something suddenly erupted in him, that gave him strength he didn't know he had. Becoming more focused than ever. He strikes back, shocking the woman. She skid back just a bit, surprised. He was nothing but a mere human. And he suddenly displayed such strength. She didn't have time to full grasp it, he came charging at her, jumping and coming down. She managed to block him, pushing him back. That didn't stop him, he kept coming and coming. This time putting her on the defense. He took to high grounds, switching suddenly to lower ground. His speed seem to increase too. He threw sharp objects at her, some meant to cut, others meant to conceal him behind smoke. He nearly slashed her chest open, with the strike he had. At first she was enjoying, toying with him. Now, now it was something else. Searching him again, there. That burning passion again. It was now blaze more so than ever. Robin brings his blade down hard, having enough she smacks him back hard. \"I tired of this.\"She tells him. Levitating her blades.\"Begone.\"Sends them straight at Robin, who gets ready when the blades split into more. Grinding his teeth.\"Damn...\"He gets ready to deflect and dodge, when a dark shield protects him and deflects the incoming projectiles. \"THOU WITCH!\"Belladonna hisses, conjuring another sword. Robin didn't know what was going on, for that second.\"Come on.\"John grabs him by the collar, just as he steps into the magical circle. That ignited around them.\"Your coming with me, ya brat.\"Before Robin could blink he felt his body become light and vanish. Everything went dark, then came light at the end of the tunnel. Opening his eyes, he finds startled him. He had to be brought back, by a slap in the head from John.\"Stay focused. We only get one shot at this and I need your full attention.\" Rubbing the back of his head, Robin demands where they are.\"Where did you take me?\"Looking around the open space. John didn't have time for an answer, he just grabs onto Robin.\"We're going to wake up Sleeping Beauty. That's what.\"[Chapter 36] You wanted to go home. Leave this place. Being in the hospital was really unsettling, but the doctors wanted you to stay as Dick told you. Just to make sure everything was alright. But, you just didn't want too and really wanted to go. Something inside told you to leave. You felt fine. Your head wasn't hurting anymore. Becoming restless, you get out of bed to walk around at least, when suddenly Raven appears grabbing you firmly by the wrist. She nearly startled you.\"Raven!? You scared me.\" \"Oh. Sorry.\"She apologizes and takes you back inside.\"Where do you think you're going? The doctor said for you stay in bed.\" \"I just wanted to walk around.\"You tell her, taking your wrist back.\"I'm just board. That's all. So can I just go walk around?\" Before she said anything, someone else comes in. Damian followed with Dick. It was odd, they suddenly where there. Though you didn't much of it, with Damian coming over and giving you a Get Well Teddy Bear. And a kiss on the cheek, distracted by his affection, that you notice Dick had shut the door. Locking it. \"Why are you up?\"He asked coming over ruffling your hair. Leading you back to the bed. Placing the bear down on the nightstand.\"I just wanted to go for a walk. That's all.\"You stress. Looking out the window for a second then turn around, just a that presence quickly appears and vanishes.\"I've been in here for some time. I just want to get out. When can I go home?\"Looking to Dick. \"I told you, when the doctors release you.\"He irritates, smiling. Though you weren't feeling the joy and he saw it.\"Vi, we just want to make sure you're alright. That hit on the head, really could be bad.\" \"Yeah.\"Raven agrees coming to your side. Putting a loving arm around you.\"You're very important to us. We just want to make sure you're alright.\"Pressing her cheek on your head. \"I understand that..\"you tell her, wiggling yourself out and proceed to the door.\"But, I still want to go. Hey? What if we just go as-\"Damian steps in front of you. Blocking your path, not sure why you get ready to go around when he just hugs you. You hug him back quickly.\"Okay...\"Releasing yourself to find he hadn't let you go.\"Damian...? Damian, let me go.\"You tell him trying to get out. But he wouldn't let you, in fact his hug seem to become tighter and tighter. The more you struggled to get out.\"Damian!?\"You raise your voice. Now becoming a bit angry at him. Something didn't seem right, you felt it.\"DICK! RAVEN!\"You call for them to help you with Damian to find them standing there allowing it to happen. Allowing you to be crushed, the empty look on their faces was eerie. You didn't understand what was going on, you where loosing air and slowly slipping. Your struggling stopped and your body became limp. Just as your eyes lids began to close Raven and Dick suddenly became feral and lunged towards the door to be hit with an explosion. Blasting them back. You couldn't scream for them, instead scream Damian's head suddenly falls off and he lets you go. Petrified and horrified. That you didn't realize there was no blood and the decapitated body was operating just fine. It turns around ready to attack to be blasted back like Raven and Dick. Everything was happening so fast, especially when someone comes and grabs your wrist. Pulling you with them. You tired to resist, worried about the others to find yourself not in the hall of the hospital. But floating aimlessly in void space, surrounded by windows that where memories of not just yourself but of others. Others you didn't know, but could feel them. You saw all their misdeeds. Both big and small. You didn't understand why, just a second ago you where in the hospital. Before that, you where at home with your family, before that at school with everyone. Your friends. It made no sense. None at all. Confused. You turn around to find the 'hospital' was surrounded by some sort of spherical energy field. There where strange ruin signs on them. \"...Damian...\"you said his name still in shock over what happened.\"Raven...Dick...\"A single tear rolls down and floats away. From behind a hand reaches out and holds your shoulder firmly. \"Violet. Violet.\" That voice...you knew it, turning around finding Robin. Solely focused on him that you didn't notice John behind him. How was Robin no, Damian here? You just saw him decapitated. None of made sense. It began to frustrate and confuse you. Robin wanted to explain everything, but now was not the time to become emotional or offer emotional comfort. It was time to be serious and get focus, he and John managed to get to you just in time. Though he didn't know much about the mystical arts, from what he observed through man, Belladonna put extreme measures in place to ensure you couldn't be and to bury you. She wasn't going to give up without a fight. All that they went through just to get to you, Robin became rather skeptical yet impressed. Focusing back to the reason coming, Robin grabs hold of your wrist. Pulling you with him.\"Violet, come on. We hav-\" \"LET GO!\"You sneer, snatching your wrist back, with an angry glare. Which shocked Robin. He tries to reach for you again, but you resist. Moving back.\"GO AWAY!\"Turning your back to him and John. And head back to the sphere. To suddenly be tackled and restrained by Robin. Whom you begin to struggle against. While he was trying to get through to you.\"Violet! Stop this! There isn't time!\" \"LET ME GO!\" \"NO! You need snap out of this premature illusion!\" \"LET ME GO!\" \"Violet! STOP THI-\"You manage to elbow him hard in the nose. With enough force he let you go, leaving stun for a second.\"...\" Moving back giving yourself distance from. Giving him a warning glare, not to try that again.\"You ruined everything!\"You lash out.\"You ruined my happiness!\" The words you used on him, Robin wasn't sure if it was really you saying these things or just your state of mind. John did say your mind would be rather frazzled. Being in such an enchantment for so long. Though the way your eyes consumed with anger, told him other wise. Pushing that aside, knowing it wasn't the time to dwell on that, with much more pressing matters at hand. Giving the amount of time they had in here, IF, the others could keep the delay longer. Wiping the blood that trickled from his nose he tries to grab you again. To nearly be viciously swiped by you. \"VIOLET!\"He yells, losing his patience.\"Stop this. We're going!\" \"I'm not going anywhere with you!\"Raising your hand, John quickly says something in ancient tongue. A strange blood symbol begin to burn into his right hand, just as it did with you. Upon your brow. And it hurt. Causing you scream in pain. \"Wha?!\"Robin didn't know what was happening, just that you where in pain. He turns to John about to order him to stop and explain. \"I told you and your people what my intentions where.\"He reminds Robin.\"I was going to go to any length needed.\" Robin didn't care and tries to stop him.\"You're hurting her!\"He lunges to the man, who quickly immobilizes the boy. While you scream and react in agonizing pain. Restrain wasn't going to stop Robin, magic or not and begins to fight against it. John knew he could fight all he wanted, it wouldn't work. Concentrating on you, blocking out the screams, the symbol upon the two of you still kept burning. He knew if he didn't do this, then...Using his hand to command and subdue you. Like a puppeteer and its puppet. Robin still trying to get out, yelling at John to leave you alone, but the man blocked him out. \"Just a little more...\"John tells himself, clenching his fist tightly. Causing black veins to suddenly appear on you as you gag from it. Foaming and drooling, your eyes rolled in the back of your head. Your extra set of eyes appeared over your normal ones. Like Trigon. The markings on your body etched more over your whole body.\"There!\"John just thrust his hand right into you forehead, where the marking reside. To Robin's horror and shock.\"...!\" You let out a blood piercing screech, that effect everything. Things begin to crack and break, shatter and split. Robin thought his own head was going too. Wishing he could cover his ears, instead of having go endure it. Cursing under his breath for the wretch noise to stop. Going deaf wasn't what he wanted. With one eye open, he saw what John was doing. No. What he was pulling out, he was pulling something out. Robin knew if he had a weak stomach he would had vomit by now from what he saw. It was thick, oozing, vile and foul. He wasn't sure what it was. Except this had to be what John meant by you being poisoned. The man just took it out like it was nothing, and burns it. A few drops of it fell onto your face. The pain and scream had stopped with you, leaving you void and weak. Teetering back and forth before falling down. To be caught by John. Grabbing your the color of your shirt. Before securing you under his arm. You just dangled in there like a rag doll. John releases Robin who goes over to you. And demands the man tell him what happened.\"What did you do? Why is she like this?\" John doesn't answer, instead tells him to they needed to go.\"Unless you want to be your final resting place to be here. We better go. Here.\"He hands to Robin to hold.\"I need two hands.\" He turns back around speaks in a ancient words, his yellow circular mystical ruin appears. Crossing his arms, the look in his eyes, Robin couldn't make out. They where focused, but there was something else. Raven manged to deflect Belladonna's blast, with her own while guarding the portal John made. She had come just in time before the woman did away with Robin, saving him. Her sudden presence surprised not just the wrathful Fallen, but also her team. Surprised to find her here, well and able. Her teammates weren't sure if she was fully up to her strength, considering how she looked the last time they saw her. But, it seem that she was. Fighting against the woman. Who clearly had Raven's death in her eyes. Her attacks filled with rage and hate. Conjuring another blade, Belladonna violently throws it at Raven, who deflects it. \"Geez. She really has it out for Raven. Doesn't she?\"Gar said, hurrying over to aid his teammate, stopping when he was almost struck by lighting.\"WHOA!\"Transforming into rabbit and dodges the strikes that suddenly targeted him.\"What the heck?\" Blue Beetle with his shield up protects himself from the lighting strike. Moving out the way just in time.\"It's following us. She's targeting us with the lighting.\"He points out.\"We've got to get to Raven.\"Dodging again. To be struck from behind by the lighting. Taking to the air, Raven gives herself some distance from the woman. Quickly she glances at where her sister reside. While her mind raced and worried, she kept herself focused and ready for the woman's assault and attacks. Maneuvering out the way just barely from being impaled by Belladonna's blade. \"Thee wilt beest crucify, demon! Thy sins and blood wilt runneth no more! I shalt end thy toxic and foul existence. Thou has't tainted mine kin for too long. Hell shalt not beest thy resting lodging. Nothing but oblivion. Thee soulless creature!\" \"You're one to talk.\"Raven spews back. Angering her.\"You're the one who's heartless.\" \"ENOUGH!\" Raising her hand, Belladonna clenches her fist commanding the lighting to strike Raven. Covering herself with a shield. Raven suffered no damage. That didn't stop the attacks, coming at her again with her swords and magic. Ruthlessly attacking the teen, giving Raven no room to counter attack or for that matter to flee. Keeping it at close quarter combat instead. Fiercely determine to break her strong defense. But, Raven wouldn't break. She'd keep this shield up for along as she could. Rising her blade high, Belladonna brings it down like explosive upon Raven's shielded defense. The force was enough to propel the girl through the air into the ground, while sending out a strong shockwave. That caused the weather to halt for a second. Her shield still up, but with cracks. Another blow like that it would shatter. \"RAVEN!\"Blue alerts her, flying to her. Raven quickly looks up finding the angered woman over.\"NO!\" \"Thee wilt vex me no more.\"She said so cold and cruel. Right before Blue's eyes and his horror watches the woman thrust her blade right through the shield and into Raven. A pleased smile etches on her lips, to quickly drop.\"What?!\" Even Blue was surprised and confused. What he thought was Raven was something else. No. Someone else. Smirking to himself, despite the impaling blade in his torso. Gripping the metal with his bloody marked hand. A mark that made Belladonna's eyes wide shocked and surprised. That hand latches out, grabbing her wrist. \"Hello luv.\" John smirks.[Chapter 37] \"Whoa!\"John narrowly dodges being impaled by Belladonna. He smirks with amusement at her frustration.\"Aww, come on luv? You use to love that little trick.\" \"Your tongue shall be mine!\"She hisses and throws her blade sharply at him. He managed to narrowly avoid it, though it did scathed just a bit. He just ignores the flesh wound. It wasn't as important as the rage of the woman. The dark clouds shook with it her fury for him, the winds whipped harsher and harsher. Her focus was on him, which was good. He narrowly made it before she delivered the ending blow upon Raven. Bringing back Violet, his quick thinking was faster than the thought. With Belladonna's focus on him, he could end it all. Just as he wanted to years ago. Though being on the defense was making it rather difficult right now. When he couldn't really get in a clean shot, especially with her Domain activated. From the corner of his eye, he sees her conjure up a another blade. \"Not good.\"He counters conjuring up a mystical shield and rolls out the way just as it shatters.\"Starting to think ya really trying to kill me.\"He quips, only adding to her anger. \"Thou soul shall burn in the pits of 9th level of Hell.\" \"Fine by me, I've already have reservations. Though I'm sure you've been there before, how is it like?\" \"DO NOT MOCK ME MORTAL!\"A violent flick of her wrist sends lighting striking where he stood. Putting up another shield, John kept it at bay. He could feel her unparalleled rage through each strike. It was stronger than last time. He would know. Thinking quickly he sends a counter spell, deflecting it back at her. Zapping her violently like a insect. Her painful screams screeched in the winds. Shattering glass and shaking the earth.\"Whoa!\"Gar stared shocked and frighten. Seeing the whole thing, watching the crazed woman fall out from the sky to the ground.\"...\" \"My ears!\"Blue Beetle covers them in pain. Everyone nearly does, if not for Raven's quick thinking. Expanding her shield silencing it.\"Thanks.\" he tells her. She pays him no mind, her focus on who laid before her. Whom she was trying to bring back, fix. With her hands on either side of their head. Their empty, soulless eyes stared back. It was a haunting sight. Their pulse was low, if not faint. Breathing too. John and Robin might have been able to bring them back, but they stayed in there for so long. Submerged in all that vile, they barely clung to the living world. Looking from the tip of their bare feet all the way to the head, corruption was still tainting them. They where still absorbing everything. Raven knew their body was deteriorating. All that was decayed and dark on them was gone. They where beginning to fade. Nothing anyone was saying broke through, brought them. Brought back her sister, brought back you. This was what Raven wanted to prevent, she wanted too so badly. To save her sister, save you from the clutches of Trigon, from her mother. Did she not teach you enough? Was her power not strong enough? Could she bring back what was spawned, birth and raised in dark, to light? Her sister was nothing meant for tool on either side, no care or love given to her by either. Tainted blood ran through her sister, thicker than her own. Her soul too. It begin to make sense why, why you couldn't really follow her teachings of her birth home. Evil was too deeply rooted in you. There was no light, many would see it as such. Raven, refused to believe that. She and the others managed to get you back before. They'd be able to do it again. With Nightwing and Robin sitting close by, on either side. Anxious and fearful of what was happening. Feeling hopeless unable to do nothing. Blue Beetle whispering a prayer in Spanish for her sister. Nightwing squeezes your cold hand desperately. No reaction of response. It just laid there. Robin saw his anguish and pain. His frustration and rage, behind Nightwing's mask. It strong. So very strong. It allowed Robin to understand Nightwing more. But what stood out the most, was the fear Nightwing had. The fear of lost, of being alone. No, the fear of the bond between himself and Violet being taken away from him. The only piece he had left of his old life, was slipping through his fingers. What brought a smile to his face. Recalling the pictures he'd seen of the two through the manor and looking them. There was so much love beaming from them. There was no one picture where Nightwing/Dick wasn't hugging or holding Violet close to him. Protectively. Pride and joy in his eyes, with a happy smile. She meant that much to him. And smile she had on too. Mirrored his. Together it manifested into love. Manifested into the perfect family. It amazed Robin, thinking about it. Though Violet wasn't blood related to Dick, his love and adoring for her was amazing. He just saw her as family and nothing more. Watching Nightwing keep pressing two fingers to you throat, searching for a pulse. Which was slowly fading. She was going to be gone soon, a fact that enraged Robin. This was his fault, all of it was. It was himself and no else. All that he said to her, led down to this road. Why did he have to be so...looking at you laying there slipping away. He shuts his eyes, seeing nothing at first, until a faint a glow emitted. It took form and he saw you standing there, not looking at him. No. Your back was to him. He reaches out for his hand to go straight through and you vanish. Opening his eyes, back to reality. What was that? He didn't know. What he did know was something inside him begin to fade. Fading that it hurt. Just like when Slade stabbed you through the heart, right before. Watching your lifeless body thrown over the side, that same feeling. That burning feeling, it was made him jump off the side without a second thought. It was the same feeling when he allowed his mother to take you away, when Talon beat you up. When you left to join the Titans. The only time that feeling went away, every time he knew your presence was awake and nearby. Always feeling relieved and calm. Always right there by his side. Where he could easily take hold of your hand and never it let go. Never let go. Never. There was never going to be that. Tightly gripping the hilt of his katana and stands.\"Robin? What are you doing?\"Blue notices. The hero didn't respond, he just lunges at the shield and slashes it with embedded rage. He didn't make any mark, yet still kept at it.\"DAMIAN!?\"Blue yells, yanking him back to nearly to be cut in the processes. Stepping back looking at completely, he understood Robin's action. It was written all over his face. Determination and anger mixed together. Released in each strike. Over and over again.\"Raven...\" Though she understand their feelings. She refused.\"No.\"She said. Shocking and surprising both her teammates.\"Why?!\"Robin demands.\"Her mother is killing her! I have to end this!\" Raven shoots him a ice stare, silencing him.\"I..said...no. This is more important right here. Violet.\"With that she ends the discussion and focus her energy back.\"By the monks of Azarath, great Azar hear my call, hear my pleads. Invoke the one blinded by darkness and gripped by death to-\" Back with John, he stands over Belladonna triumphantly, and summons through his own blood.\"The Binds of Issac. Ya remember it don't ya love? Let's not forget the Dagger either?\"He makes it appear as well.\"Found these lovely little trinkets along the way. Took me some time, but I did.\" \"Thee speaketh to me with such vile and sin. thee art the one who speaketh with cruelty.\"She spits back.\"At which hour twas thee who wished to spill the blood of an innocent.\" \"Like you're so Holy yourself.\"John lashes back.\"You're the one who is cruel.\" She mocks him laughing.\"Me? Cruel? This world is nothing but vile and a waste. Mine union wast out of love. Love for mine kin-\" \"That's right, you speaking about love. Ya sure you've never been a comedian?\"He smirks which drops.\"Enough talking.\"He levitates the chains.\"Time for you to go. You've caused enough suffering.\"Just as he was about to snap his fingers, she flashes him coy smile and he realized it was all ruse. He turns around where Raven kept her shield up.\"Bloody..HEY! MOVE!\"He yells, warning her. Racing back, stepping right on Belladonna, who turns into dust. It was a ruse, he should have figured it out. There was no way she would allow a capture that easy. She was playing him this whole time, getting him away from the others. Pressing his ear, to the communicator in it, alerts Batman, but it was too late. By the time he relayed the message, a powerful blast of lighting strikes the shield. The shockwave blasted and demolished everything around. He managed to put up a shield of his own just in time. Chunks of debris and rubble, shattered and broken glass flung through the air. His shield managed to hold, he tries to contact Batman, but only static responded. Unable to see from all the settling dust and debris, forced him to wait. Keeping his guard up, knowing she was a sneaky one. All his senses where, eyes shooting all around. For any sign of movement. The whistling wind was what he heard, still, he didn't want any surprises. Ready to attack, ready with a an ace up his sleeve. Gripping tightly to the binds, he just needed to get this on her and everything would end. Turning his back just for a second, something gets thrown roughly against it. He was sure he heard bones crack or break. Quickly he turns back around surprised at what laid in slight pain on the ground. Belladonna. Her wing looked twisted, which she quickly managed to heal and stands using his shield as support. Looking closely, John saw she was surprised which twisted into prideful glee. Unfolding her wings caused the dust to disburse, and he sees charging right at her with no mercy in their eyes. You. He was surprised to even see you up at all. Belladonna moves out the way, dodging your flamed punch that stopped thanks to John's shield. This allowed him to get a closer look at you. And it wasn't you. You converted to your demonic form. With dark fire coated around your hands, ankles and tail. Along with fire horns and wings, with Trigon's marks all over your body. He saw nothing in your empty eyes, no reaction. Nothing. This transformation, this fallen form. He could feel everything vile surrounding you. \"No...\"he whispers, just as you smacked back by Belladonna. Brought him back. Putting down his shield, the others reach him.\"WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?!\"He demands. Before anyone of them could answer John already frustrated had means to end it.\"Never mind. I'll just end this myself.\"He grips the dagger. And recites an incantation. Causing the binds and dagger to glow.\"There, that should do it.\"And rushes off, Nightwing pulls him back. \"What are you doing?\"He looks at the dagger knowing well, what John was going to do. And steps in his way.\"You can't.\" \"Get out my way pretty boy, otherwise I'll use some imps to mess it up.\"John threatens him. Staring him down.\"I don't got time your prissy whimpering. I said at the start, I've got to finish this. What was meant to be done years ago. And I intend to.\"Feeling metal pressed upon his throat finding Robin pressing it and Blue's cannon starting up from behind. Each of them standing off, Nightwing snatches the dagger away from John. When Belladonna gets thrown in their direction again. All of them blown back from the force. Shocked seeing her with crippled wings. She struggles to get up, they see part of her core missing. Blood coming, she does her best to begin healing. When something lighting fast comes and pins her down. A agonizing scream comes from the woman, the sound of someone ripping flesh off, along with burning flesh filled the air.\"Gross...\"Blue gags and nearly throws up from what was tossed his way. Charred wings. Not just any wings, angel wings, with a good chunk of burned flesh on them. Belladonna screams again, followed by a maniacal chuckle.\"Cometh mine issue, finish. Finish!\" You stand over the woman with your claws raised high, bring them down mercilessly on her.\"NO!\"John hollers, along with another. Shoving Nightwing away, taking the dagger back. Throws the binds and plunges the dagger. Your body went into shock, what was once a void. Became visible, it felt warm. And liquid. It trickled through your fingers, droplets fell down onto the ground. You stood there hollow, bring up your hands. Seeing nothing but red and peace. Confused you smile for a second before it all ends. Like a sack of potatoes, you fall. It was all over. All of it. No more. You could finally be free. \"New reports are still coming after that strange global phenomenon nearing a month now. Emergency assistance are arriving to assist with the damages. Even the Justice League is leading a hand. The Wayne Foundation has sent out a great donation helpings those get back on their feet. We may never know where that Hellish nightmare came from, but we are grateful to survive. Thank Go-\" Jamie turns off the T.V. having enough of cruel words. Though of course he knew they didn't know the words they used related to his teammate. It was true, it was a blessing they survived. Everyone really. The horrors where now over and things could return back to normal. That is as normal as it can get for heroes. Everyone was home, but it felt so empty. Tossing the remote. Enough for today. He stands up in the common room, looking around finding only himself. DDR hadn't been played in so long. It began to collect dust. Tension and anticipation was easily felt. No matter what he did or anyone did to try an distract themselves from constant waiting, their minds didn't wavier far. Sitting here anxiously waiting. For any news. He was still lost and shocked at what he saw. Right before he eyes, he saw innocence become corrupted, then again, weren't they always... That was her, her real form. Her parents truly sculpted darkness out of ebony. No empathy. No care. No..nothing. Everything was empty. They were nothing but an empty shell of pure sin. Anger the most. Followed closely by fear. Pride either. Getting off the coach, he walks to the window. It was a nice day. Perfect weather. Waves nice too. Yet, he couldn't enjoy it. No one could. Silence was the way everyone spoke now. Useless. He was useless now. What could he do? What could any of them do? Even Raven, she was strong. But could she really...it might have worked before. But that was with the mind, this now, was the soul included. She suffered too. Accidentally bring forth that monstrous thing. That he couldn't call his teammate. No matter what he thought. Lamenting on the passed events only upset and frustrated him. Looking at his reflection, reflecting old and happy memories. Their arrival to the Tower, he showed them around and helped them to get comfortable. He watched them improve over and over again. Coming into their own. At times they would stand by him right now looking at the water. Now, he wondered if that would ever happen again. Sensing someone else's presence, surprised to find there...Damian. He'd expect the young man to be up there, but he wasn't. The two just look at each other, Jamie could only imagine what he was thinking and feeling. But, Damian kept his emotions at bay. So it was hard to read. Still, Jamie knew he needed some sort of reassurance, about to give it to him, when they receive a page and rush out. It didn't take them long to reach the area. Gar was there already, Starfire, and Dick. On the other side of the door, Raven, John and Cyborg. Waiting and patience now was becoming an annoyance. The seconds that passed, felt like years. Eventually the doors open, before Jamie knocked it down. And everyone hurries in, just as John was cleaning up. Putting the dagger away. Just as the others surround the bed. He could hear them each holding their breaths, already knowing how this was going to play out and not one for emotional scenes, announces he's going for a smoke and leaves. Just as he hears gasps of joy and relief. Outside the Tower, John blows out a puff, then takes in a deep smoke.\"You know those things can kill you.\"He hears someone tell him. \"So I've been told.\"John responds not caring. Taking another puff.\"But what doesn't kill ya makes you stronger. Right? Bats?\"Looking to Batman.\"I am to assume you received the message?\" \"Yes. Nightwing told me.\"Batman looks up at the Tower.\"...You know...You're going to have explain-\" \"I know. I know.\"John cuts him off.\"Trust me...I know. You should go up.\" \"Tell me John, were you really going to do it?\"John didn't answer, he just takes another puff. \"...When all that emotional crap is gone. Send me a signal and I'll be up there. In the meantime, I'm going for more smokes.\"He throws his cigarette down and walks off. After a few hours, John comes back to the Tower and goes straight up to the room. Exiting the elevator, the hallway seem longer than before. He knew because he was dreading on doing this, but what choice did he have. No one really. Suddenly he was having second thoughts, it wasn't like him. He could easily turn around and go back down, no one would know. A thought that completely scrapped from his mind quickly. There was coning his way out of this. Pushing his hands down in his pocket he finds himself already at the doors which open automatically. All eyes on him, they didn't matter only one pair. Looking at them, he saw them as an infant. Hard to believe all this time passed. Keeping his composer makes is way over. Those eyes watch him and wait. They were ready for anything and everything he had to say. But he wasn't. Wishing the others would leave, but knew they wouldn't, because they wanted to hear. Even if they knew, they really where here for support. The atmosphere felt so tense a stiff, he had to make light of it.\"Mind if I sit?\"He asked. He got permission and sits lightly on the bed. Being careful. Sighing, running his fingers through his hair. His mind trying to formulate how to say this.. So he takes out the dagger and sets on the bed.\"I'll be honest, what I'm going to tell ya. It won't be roses and daises.\"You understand and let him continue.\"Alright then, you where born on the coldest and darkest day of the year. I took you from your mother, knowing what you where. You're mother and I were...we had history. I lost you when she sent her agents after me. I left you in the park to hide you from them, but when I cam back. You were gone. I did find you eventually. Having been taken in by a family. The best way to hide you from your mother, I put the seal of Gleipnir on you. One to hide you away from your mother and the other should that side of you arise it locks down. I didn't bother to finish what I started, because I knew eventually Belladonna would find you. So I set out to retrieve what would be necessary for her and...you. The binds Issac and Dagger of Abraham. Anyway enough about that, let's get to the important part...\"[Chapter 38] \"Am I dark being?\" \"Yes.\" \"So I've always been tainted since, birth?\" \"Yes.\" \"There is no such thing as innocence in me? Is there?\" \"...That depends.\" \"These souls...of those lost. Does this mean I have murdered?\" With hesitant nod, John acknowledges it.\"Yeah. You have. Though not of your own choice.\" \"I doesn't matter. Murder is murder. So. I am cruse upon this world...\"You cringe, clenching your fist in anger.\"What of...that..my birth mother? Did I...\"The room became tight and heavy. There was no need for words, from the others. Looking at your calm resting hands, though clean, you could see feel the red liquid. Smell it too. See it. No matter how clean. It was still there. You would have been applaud and frighten finding out. But, that was the along time ago. You just stare blankly. No emotion. Nothing. Grief and regret was nowhere on face or in your eyes. Not even a spark. Remorse was foreign. You didn't shutter. Just sat there and accepted it. \"What...what does it mean?\"You ask. Looking at him. John stares into the black pools, which now where eyes. After what happened. Just bleak and empty your eyes would seem by those who didn't know. But, the others, though with their pity knew behind them you cried. John lefts out a heavy sigh.\"It means...When someone kills an angel, even a Fallen One...Their damned to Hell. They get a one way ticket.\" You hear a few gasp, but you remained unfazed.\"Makes since, I never had a life nor soul to begin with.\"You say looking down.\"Everything about me was made for no reason...I was made for no reason. Born to be soulless. Since day one. It now makes since...my birth being on the coldest and darkest day. I've lived in the dark, that's my true home. Right?\"You look at John who kept quiet and let you keep going.\"Will I always be like this...now?\"Opening your mouth showing him you fangs.\"This too?\"Running your nails through your wild, thick white hair.\"This?\"Pointing to your beady black eyes. \"Yes.\" A amused scoff escapes you. Which slowly rises into small chuckle, a rather mental one.\"...\"Holding your sides as it ascends to a laughter. No one knew how to react. Not even Dick.\"...I...I don't know why? Why I'm laughing? Why...Why I find this hilarious?\"You confess confused. A twisted look in your eyes, flashing a bit of anger at John. That soon faded and tears came. Laughter and tears.\"Violet...\"Dick gets ready to comfort you, when you lash out at him. \"LEAVE ME ALONE!\"You hiss, shooting him a deadly glare. Your extra eyes appeared, burning with frustration, that quickly faded to confusion and pain. Tears rolled down them too. Through your tears everyone saw your broken twisted smile. Looking to John.\"...I can...I can still feel everyone...Inside me. Screaming out. And...I want...I want more...I need more..\"You confess in disgust.\"I HATE! But...Then I don't...Should...Should I?\" A question as innocent as a child.\"You're going to have those urges..yes.\"John admits.\"I don't know how they can go away.\"Apologizing. The weight of everything crushed you. Anger. Frustration. Rage. Sorrow. Confusion. Pain. All of it felt amplified. Ever bit of your life, you saw nothing. Nothing but misery, after misery. Like a flipbook. Repeating. Your life hadn't changed since day one. Nothing good came from it. Knowing you killed and why this death effected so much. Was beyond your understanding. Those men...they had you do horrible things. For years and years. Then Trigon. And now Belladonna. Everyone had you do something horrible. It only made sense outside reflected everything inside. Your soul was right to be damned to Hell. Forever. You never deserved one. You didn't even deserve life, a life not meant to be your own. John had every right to exorcise you. He should have done it when he had the chance. Looking at the dagger still before you and lunge for it. \"VIOLET! NO!\"The others shriek, Batman managed to snatch from your grasp, while the others held you back. You cry and plead for them to let you go. So you could just die. Smiling through it. Telling them, life would be much easier this way A shattered...no broken soul like yourself wasn't worth being alive after everything you've done. Dark and Endless, you've come to accept as your only home. They refused to release you. Angering you. Your fire begin to flare against them. The voices, you could hear their voices and words trying to snap you out of your delusional break down. But you refused to hear their lies. All of it was nothing but lies, they wanted to use you too. Dick to have what was left of his family. Starfire using you to spread her kindness. Raven, the same as Dick, having a bit of her family. The rest, you weren't sure, but there was something. And Damian... Those hot tears didn't stop, they just couldn't. Each one running down your cheek was acid. Fill with toxic pain. Deep pain. Why did your life had to be like this? Why couldn't at least one parent...person in your life. Just love you? Why couldn't your parents just make you out of love? Why did they have to them? Why did they have to hurt their child? For their own purpose. Everyone in this room, was made out of some sort of affection. Even if it was only half. It was something. You, weren't. Affection was denied in your life. A truth you had to accept. \"...My life...is...it's nothing but...meaningless...crap..\"You tell yourself, stopping with the struggle and drop your head.\"...\"The tears didn't stop. Empty eyes looking down. A heavy hand touches your head.\"...It...It all hurts...Why...did they hurt me? Why does everyone want to hurt me? I'm so...so very tired of being lost...Like a leaf in the wind. Where's my happy ending? My loving family? When will the pain stop? When?\"You cry into John, who had pulled you into his chest to comfort you. He didn't know what to say to those questions. Gripping onto him tightly, the room was silent.\"Ya know why I didn't kill you?\"He asked you.\"Because, you smiled.\"He whispers. Shocking you.\"If someone sired and born into darkness. Could make such a bright smile. Then they are NOT darkness's child.\"Using his magic he brings up that scene with you. Hearing a baby's cry, made you look and see what he meant. Your eyes watch John staring down at you in his arms, shocked, looking closer everyone looking. See upon your infant face, a smile. Right at John, with a small laughter escaping. On the coldest and darkest night. You look in awe and shock.\"...That...That's me?\"Reaching out, reluctant for a second. Touch the memory, though your hand went through the projection. The fact it was there. Looking at that smile. The sound of something unlocking brought you back. Looking at John, who was holding a small box. A plain one.\"I managed to save it.\"He tells you.\"Your very first innocence.\"He opens it, and it felt so warm. So gentle. He gives it to you and the light fades. \"Where did it go?\"Gar asked puzzled and confused. Jamie elbows him pointing and he sees where it went. Back to you. Dark eyes lite back up with color, long nails turned back into normal fingers. Tail vanished. And the smile returned. Everything did. Amazed. You where just amazed. Looking to John, speechless.\"Thank...Thank you...\"you cry, throwing yourself on him.\"Thank you, John.\" Thankful you where and wishing he could stay. John had to go. He stayed for a few more days making sure everything was alright. Your recovery went well. Standing with the others in front of the Tower, John looks down at you. Smirking. You stare up at him.\"Will...\"You stop yourself.\"No. Thank you. Again.\" \"You're welcome.\"He ruffles your hair rather hard. And gives you a push.\"Ya sure you don't want to come with me?\" Glancing over your shoulder quickly at everyone and smile.\"I...I think I will be alright. I feel safer here.\"He shrugs his shoulders. \"Alright. Fine. Just don't...burn anyone.\" \"I won't.\"You promise.\"...\"The two of you look at each other. \"Alright then, I'm off.\"He summons a portal and steps in. Without looking back. \"You know something...\"Gar brings up.\"He never did explain how your human? I mean...both your parents are well...so wouldn't there have to be...I don't know a host or vessel?\"He looks at the others seeing if they agreed.\"Didn't he say that? Well...at least implied it. Come on GUYS! Don't you want to know?\" \"No.\"You simple answer, shocking him.\"I know enough.\"Looking at your hands. You still had Trigon's marks and white hair. Your parents tainted blood running through your veins. But, what could you actually do about it? Gar had a point, about that part. But, you didn't want to know. Something telling you it was best you didn't. Turning around to the others and embrace Dick. \"...I love you.\"You tell him. \"I love you too.\"He response. Looking down at you affectionate. You give him a smile and let go. Turning to Raven and hold out a hand to her. She takes it, you hold it firmly. \"Here you go.\"You say to Richie, opening the cage and feed him. It was so nice to hear his happy chirps again. You missed them so much. You missed him. He missed you too. You could feel it. Watching your little robin eat his meal happily, a small smile breaks on your lips.\"You might be little. But, you make so very happy. Thank you my little robin.\"You stroke him gently and close the door to his cage.\"What a nice day.\"Taking notice of the serene view of the water from your window room. So relaxing. Hard to believe not to long ago life was horrible.\"I should get some fresh air.\" The view was nice, but the gentle waves outside was better. Smelling ocean air, the wind blew through your hair, making it look like dancing flames. You could feel it, all their sins and souls. Calling to you, starting up your hunger. You could still feel the others inside you. Screaming, in their lock torment. Yet, you kept calm despite the splitting headache. Remembering what Raven said and taught you. It was the only way to deal with this insanity. No matter how much you wanted to cry. Standing here alone, in nothing but lost serenity. Dick now moved into the Tower, which was great. It was nice to have here, closer. Raven and you have grown closer. Though haunted by past transgressions, left you alone and still isolated from the others. Your hands still tainted with the blood of your mother. The fear of knowing your soul was doomed. Through actions not of your own, made you wonder...wonder if you could fight to save it. To be separated from everyone, even in death. Scared you. Tears of your fear formed and fell. Through you smile. You had to fight for that not to happen. You wouldn't be alone in death. Shutting your eyes through your tears, opening them and look down finding someone hold your hand. It surprised and shocked you. That you try to take it back, for them to hold on tighter. \"Not this time.\"Damian said. Looking at you firm and serious. Squeezing your hand more. Holding it up.\"We've handle every obstacle together. We'll handle this one. Besides, who said you could anyway?\"He flashes you a smirk. Understanding you return the smirk.\"Yes. You're right. We do handle everything together.\"Squeezing his hand in return and look back at the ocean. The of you stood there in mutual silence watching the waves and water. \"You're still Violet, no matter what.\"Damian breaks the silence. \"I know.\" \"You could be more.\" You scoff.\"What more could I be?\"Turning to look at him, finding him staring at you rather intense, with his furrow. That softens behind those eyes green eyes, leaning in towards you. Your heart suddenly wanted to burst out its chest, looking at Damian confused and shocked.\"Da...Damian?\"You stammer. Up in the tower, Dick was walking in the hall when something caught his eye outside. That made him stop in his tracks.\"What...That little...\"He grumbles. Stopping mid-way through meditation Raven couldn't help but look outside and see it too. She smiles to herself, rolling her eyes and mumbles.\"...Finally.\"[Chapter 39] Hey! Hey! The agony! Oh the pain! I never got to finish...I never got to tell... \"Shhh...I can't hear.\" Hear? I wanted to hear that awesome concert. But because of you, I never will! I hope your soul rots! In HELL! This imprisonment...this endless tournament.. \"Shhh...please I cannot hear. Stop that..I said stop it. Calm my stormy mind and soul I beseech thee. Happy thoughts...Happy thoughts. Smile.\" \"The enemy is above us. You're going want channel your thoughts to that. Remember these opponents are different.\" Let me out you whore! I miss my mommy. \"There will be more..more souls. I can sense them..I crave them. My hunger shall be filled. More. I need more. This wait is unbearable.\" Snarling in frustration. With a wicked grin. Baring fangs.\"I must feed. Their souls will be condemned. I shall burn them all. The toxicity of their tainted souls, is like sweet honey and ambrosia. It will be most succulent.\" \"Sinner.\" \"Then again..those poor souls. Houst thy must suffer from all their wrong transgressions.\"Weeping, to twist into a psychotic pleasure.\"Thy shall burn by me. Their souls scream for mercy to get none. I shall enjoy suc-\" \"SINNER! VIOLET!\" Nightwing snaps his fingers in front of your face, managing to break you out of your disillusion. You come back seeing everyone looking at you. It happened again, you could see by the look in their eyes. Especially Raven and Nightwing. Rubbing your temples you apologize. \"Forgive thee, I mean me.\"You apologize.\"I-I just..It's just hard..Happy thoughts...Smiling.\"You mutter. \"Maybe bringing you on this mission wasn't a good idea.\"Starfire said glancing to Nightwing. Which you object. \"No. It's alright. I'm focused.\"You assure them. Twitching just a bit.\"Happy thoughts. Happy thoughts...\"Looking at everyone. For someone to snort with amusement.\"And deny us this?\"Terra said with a smirk.\"I kind of like the crazy schizophrenia.\"Chuckling. While still focusing on moving everyone up through the earth. Under the facility. She was mocking you, which some didn't appreciate, you just blocked it out. Sighing, there was no need to defend yourself or snip back from her crude words. Not when felt embarrassed and ashamed for having another one of your episodes. Even after full year, it still hadn't subsided yet. It made sense though, all those who's souls, sins, whatever else still haunted you. Their very thoughts screaming and screeching constantly over and over again. The same voices or some times new. You weren't sure. What made it better the fact you craved more. Despite in a sense you managed to get it under control. These episodes still came, you talking to those essence around you. Flaring up upon knowing how close you where to negative feelings. Your hunger aroused nearly uncontrollably. Blacking you out from your senses and all around you, causing the others to bring you back to your senses. Before you would have attacked them, try to incinerate them if you could. Such a struggle after the darkest episode of your life and you still where living it now. And Terra making fun you, made it worse. Sins upon sins still buried you and her teasing was nothing but a reminder. A verbal one, you already had the physical one. Starfire looks to Dick concerned. \"It's alright.\"Blue comforts you.\"Just focus. We're almost there.\" Though his words helped, you didn't want his pity. Then again it was soothing. Finding the bit of peace inside, regain control and come back. Cleanse yourself of the horde and get back in the game. It was a strain, but you had an excellent teacher. Quickly glancing to Raven, who nods. \"Sinner, can you sense how many are up there?\" Robin asked getting back to the mission and your attention away. Your eyes glow for a second. Controlling your urges tell them your best estimate.\"By thy presence of sin, I count quite a few. A baker's dozen with a few.\" \"Seems you're also a radar too.\"Terra quips. Causing Nightwing to step in. \"Okay. Enough. Focus.\"He ends it, shooting you a look to calm your rising tension. He quickly fills you in about everything you blocked out. \"We're six inches under the floor.\"Terra informs everyone, heaving.\"Who wants to knock?\" Above in the warehouse men in yellow armor some one forklifts where going gathering the materials they needed. Unaware of the presence below them, that is until a powerful green blast came from below and Starfire shoots straight out. Firing off her beams from her hands. Sending the men running for cover. \"Titans! GO!\"She orders everyone. That was all everyone needed to hear. Everyone comes out from the hole, Beastboy first changing into a rampaging rhino, Robin and Blue follow after. Raven comes flying out with Dick. You follow right after shooting a blast of fire, then manifest your flamed wings and take to higher grounds. Terra comes out after you. The men armed with their guns fire back. Through and thanks to training manage to dodge them, tempted to rely on your powers, don't and drop down with a straight kick in one of their face. Leaving your backside open, they fire, but you dip down avoiding being hit. Come up with an inflamed coated fist, hitting them square under their jaw. This was going rather well, to your surprise. Grabbing and yanking another, come down with your elbow and using the right amount of force break their arm. Proud of yourself, which was your distraction, one of them men come up from behind and puts you in a tight full nelson hold. While another takes aim. \"Violet!\"Raven spots you, finishing off her person hurries over. Sensing your rising tension. Using her powers throws the guy with the gun at you back, this gave you the opening you needed. While the one holding you was stun for a second, you wriggled out and blast him back with your fire. It didn't kill him, no, just he would be in pain for a very, very long time. Shooting Raven a thank you, jump back into the fight. Your fist and feet coated in your hell flames. Use it in sync with your fighting. Nightwing didn't train you to the brink of rawness for nothing. Nor Damian. And Starfire. If you couldn't punch them, you'd kick. You just couldn't hold them or else. Though you wanted to so badly, knowing it would be delicious, had to resist. \"Hey!\"Terra yells to you, you look at her. She flashes you a smirk.\"Up you go!\"Knowing what she thinking, stop for a second and she launches you upward with a pillar of earth.\"Lite em' up!\" Looking you see those shooting from higher grounds, you realized she was throwing to them. Your mind split on what to do and to land on the railing. One of the men spot you, take aim and fire. Railing a few others. Crossing your arms, conceal yourself in a sphere of your fire, before crash landing behind them. You manage to somewhat pick yourself up, when you hear the click and charge of a gun. Caused you freeze. Not from their guns, but when one of them suddenly grabbed you by the throat. They made physical contact with you, a deadly mistake.\"D...Don't Touch...ME!\"You holler and erupt a combustion of flames upon the men. Some drop their guns in fear. A few try to run, but you wouldn't allow it. With a thrust of your hand a geyser burst upward upon a few.\"You have seal thy fate! I shall encase thy souls into the darkest of abyss! You wrenched souls!\" Upon your mental command more flamed geyser erupted this time instead of burning them, trapped them in sphere. Your markings begin glow, the area around you started to shake. With your other hand send a blast of fire up taking off the ceiling. A mighty raging roar screeched through the night skies. From far away, you knew who was coming. Who was just as hungry and thirsty as yourself. Small in form, but large when empowered. And uncontrollable unless you say fit. Came to devour the souls and sins you marked. Blocking out men's agonizing screams, raise them higher in their spheres. Your eyes saw nothing, only their end. Their souls. Their sins would be yours and you could feast. \"Eat.\"You mutter, about to flick your wrist. \"VIOLET! NO!\" Someone tackles you down hard. Bringing you back to your sense. You wake up and realize what was happening and what you where doing. Going to do. Quickly cancel it before it could be finished. The men in their spheres drop down suffering deadly burns. From the smoke and melted armor. A bit of flames upon them. Horrified by the sight a smell, turn away. Angry with yourself. Shed a frustrated tear, get up and push yourself out of the arms of whomever had. \"Well. That's what I call well done.\"Terra said snarky. Kicking one just a bit with the tip of her foot.\"Should have brought marshmallows. And som-\" \"ENOUGH!\"Robin snaps glaring a warning at her. Terra stops. Blue trying to help you. \"I-I'm okay.\"You brush him off, regaining yourself back. Shedding that side. More so suppressing it. They could tell from your and smile.\"Let's..let's get keep going.\"Jumping over the side join the others back on the ground. Moving into the next room after taking out the three mech-suits. There was still more of the base to subdue. More henchmen to take out, you managed on your own just fine. Keeping your focus, straight and narrow. Only using your other side when needed. Though being careful not to cause damage. It was rather taxing, but you kept it up. Delivering a knee to the gut. The henchmen toppled over. \"Whew...\"You exhale, wiping your brow and turn around sending a concentrated fire blast at the henchmen. That had to be the last of them, hoping it was. Sensing a great majority of them out. \"We've taken the base.\" You hear Robin inform everyone through their ear piece. What a relief. Looking at the unconscious bodies around you, tap one with your foot to make sure. Yep all unconscious. Job here was done, now to meet up with the others. Heading to rendezvous with the team,your urges and instinct halt you. Feeling their tainted souls seeking you. To absorb. You know you want to. DO IT! Covering your ears to block out the voices that temptingly called to you. Ordering you to finish it.\"Happy...Happy thoughts...Find the light. Happy thoughts. Repent. Penitence.\"You repeat over and over.\"I shall not be tempted. Thou I walk through the valley of shadow of evil...I-I can do this...Be calm restless souls. Thou who art sinners, may you repent for your transgressions. My heart weeps for thee.\"Feeling tears forming, you let a few fall. And like always they hurt. Curse this heinous eternal burden. Searching your soul for a fondly memory, finding the right one. The very first moment you meet Dick. No. You're very first Merry Christmas with him. Calmed and settled the tormenting voices and urges. \"Sinner? Where are you?\"You hear Blue calling for you. \"C-Coming.\"You respond and hurry over to him. Stopping when you pass your reflection. Stopping and looking at yourself. A year really does change a person. Hearing Blue call for you again you tell him you would be there and to go up ahead. Looking back at yourself, it was hard to believe. How far you actually came. What you now are. Black hair now white, thick, long and unruly. Which you now kept in a low ponytail, Bangs covering your left eye. Dark demonic markings/ tattoos of Trigon all along you pale skin. Black fingernails, little fangs. Sharper looking eyes, than you old child like ones. No longer did you wear like you use to a long time ago. No. Donning off the shoulders jagged blouse dress, with jagged flared sleeves, with a dark waist cincher. You took to wearing Greek footwear all the way up to your knees. The ironic thing about your outfit, not the ghostly and witchy look it gave you. But the color scheme of it. Many would expect you to wear dark colors, to reflect your origins. No. You took to wearing snow white color. Even your foot wear. It was a contrast to everything. But was the only thing that made you feel you had some sort of innocence still. Some sort righteousness and goodness. It would help to wash away the sins you committed. Looking at yourself, standing there alone. Images of Belladonna and Trigon shadows behind haunting you. A malice and wicked smile on the woman's face. With Trigon's eyes displeased and hating burning you. The ground under you disappeared. Shutting your eyes, finding nothing but darkness. To feel and see a faint glow. It was so warm. Opening your eyes, finding in place of Trigon and Belladonna. The team. Everyone. Standing there, with you. A relief and joy to see them. Looking at everyone, stopping on Dick. Lingering on him the most. Smiling. Having him with the team for the past year was wonderful. It was the best. The best in your life. After what happened between the two of you, the ups and downs. How life became crazy and crazier. The separation the two of you had. Brought back. Just like before. This time as heroes. Together. As partners and equals. Every time you looked at him, you could see the pride in his eyes. He was here. With you. With everyone. And you knew it wouldn't change. You where the last to meet up with everyone, finding them in control room. Getting an urgent call from Raven, race down the hall wondering what it was. Coming in getting everyone's attention. All their eyes land on you, something was up. You could tell, by the way Dick and Starfire where embraced, while looking at you. A heartbroken look in the alien's eyes, looking to Dick. Whom your eyes wonder too. Questioning him what it was, a bit afraid of the answer. His eyes drop for a second from you. Before he could say anything, you noticed the small black box in Starfire's hand with a key sticking out of it. A house key. Gasping inside, putting two and two together. Life just crumbled, what was meant to be a a joyous and happy moment. Was one you could not share. Though you where some what happy, your pain and sadness wouldn't allow it. That or the voices that harassed you right now. Clenching your fist and teeth. \"Violet.\"Dick calls to you softly, stepping away from Starfire. Gets down to your level, takes off his mask wanting you to look at him. But you kept your eyes adverted away. Bitterly. Shuttering when he placed a gentle hand on your shoulder. Shutting your eyes tight to not cry. Open them directly at him and open your mouth. When he holds up a key, surprising you.\"I told you, along time ago, we'd make a family.\"He glances over at Starfire who nods and smiles at you. He places the key in your hand.\"Great right. Hello everyone sorry for the long wait. Hope you liked the chapter. I wanted to let you guys know after this there is a possibility I might make a Teen Titans story with Violet in it.[Chapter 40] It was so nice to be back at the Tower. Back home. Where there was peace and serenity. The only really sane place you could think of, away from in a people. Well, at least your mind could relaxed and some what clear. Distant was always good. In your garden on one of the floors of the tower, your own Green House. Taking up majority of a floor. Housing various plants and flowers. Nature and purity all around. The smell of earth of life relaxed you. The sun shone in perfectly warming up the place, a wonderful breeze that always put a smile on your face. Gentle and calming melody through the installed speakers, courtesy of Cyborg. A lovely water fountain in the center, that evenly distributed water to all, actually this place a wonderful watering system installed. Even so you enjoyed watering your planets yourself at times. Just like you did back when you lived in Wayne Manor. A koi pond with a small river running through and small moon bridge that was always directly under the moon whenever it was out. Coming through the bay window that was there. This whole area was remolded just for you. A gift from everyone, as a both a birthday and welcoming gift. Apparently it was being made while before all that history happened. Raven was tasked with keeping you away and it finished once you recovered, presented a week after John left. Who you where rather surprised he also contribute to it. It was small, he put in a charm in the room. It took you a while before you found it. No one told you who's idea it was, but you had a rather good idea who it was. The best part of this whole place, two things; one was that Richie could loved it. Always taking him with you, whenever you came here. Being small was his advantage. This place was large for him, he even stayed here over the nights if he wanted. Allowed to go in and out through the windows. Cyborg designed to read him. The second, you always wore smile. Even if it was small, it was there and it was your own. Positive and serene thoughts. Here you could let your hair down, like you had now. Able to be out of your other attire and into more...fitting clothing. Sleeveless maroon, high collared cheongsam shirt, with dark gray lining. Dark shorts, maroon unattached long sleeves like arm guards and same color oriental flats. It went well for you still developing body and age. Tucking some of your hair behind your ear, smelling a few flowers. This right here was your meditation. The lovely aroma was heavenly. A thought that was rather ironic. Yes. This would do. Using your clippers carefully cute the white flower, looking at it carefully. A few more and it would be perfect. Gathering a few more, making a lovely bouquet. Bouquets, you made quite a few. It was nice to have access to all these plants and flowers at your disposal all the time. ...All the time. Turning around looking at your garden of Eden. Realizing, you wouldn't anymore. With the move. Digging into your pocket, taking out the key Dick gave you. It was specially made with your name engraved. A key to a home. Putting it back you leave. Taking the elevator to the lower levels. Going to different floors to place a bouquet. Everyone knew you did at least once a week. Exiting the elevator to the common room, where Gar and Jaime where playing foosball against each other. Looking around you spot the vase with your bouquet from last week and go change it out. Humming to yourself merrily with a pleasant smile, catching someone's attention. Feeling their eyes on you, caused you to look up and see it was Terra. Over by the counter by the leftover pizza box. The way she looked at you, made you rather uncomfortable if not irritated and insecure. She wasn't really one had the most merry words. The hurt in your eyes, she saw it. Compelled her to go over. \"Umm...Hey.\"She tries to start small talk. Not wanting to be rude give a response. \"Hello.\" She looks at the flowers.\"Nice flowers. Looks really good.\" \"Thanks.\" Clearly she was only going to get small talk from you. It made since, you still being hurt and bothered by her words. Words she used in a joking and harmless teasing matter. Since she started, made since why you where indifferent and guarded against her. Though she found you rather humorous, you didn't. There was this barrier between the two of you. There was no doubt in her mind you wanted to hit her. She could feel it. And with the last mission, her choice of colorful words wasn't the best. \"So, what are those?\"She points to one of the flowers. Interested. \"Marigolds.\" \"Marigolds? Huh? I like them.\"She compliments.\"Seems you have a few more bouquets to change out, would you like...some help?\" This was a shock to you. She never asked this, looking at her shocked all over your face. While your eyes try to read between her words.\"...Why?\"You asked rather suspicious. She just shrugs her shoulders.\"I well...I mean...Look, I just wanted to say well umm...\"She was having trouble getting the words out. \"Terra.\"You get her attention. She looks at you finding you holding out a flower to her. Which you place in her hair.\"It's alright. Thank you. Sure, I would like some help.\"Picking up the last couple of bouquets. Handing a three, while you held two. With a smile walk out, she follows. \"Oh. Hey Hermona.\"Jaime notices you just before you leave and walks over.\"I wanted to thank you for making those awesome flower arrangements and bouquets for my sister's quinceanera. My family really loved them.\" \"You're welcome. I'm glad. Everyone should have something beautiful for their special day.\"You tell him.\"Your sister is very lucky to have you. Isn't her party today? Are you going to call them? Your family?\"Looking at his phone, reading the reminder on his screen. He glances at it.\"Yeah. Hey why don't you come and say hi with me. My mom has been dying to meet you since you that bouquet you made for her for Mother's Day. And my father's birthday.\" \"No. No, it's alright.\"You decline. Casting your eyes down. Afraid. He knew that look. \"Hey. Don't think like that.\"He tells you softly. Placing his hands on your shoulders. Trying to get you to look at him. Terra looks at the interaction between the you Jaime while waiting by the door. It amazed her how brotherly and comforting he was to you. Your fears and insecurities written in eyes. Jaime trying assure it was alright. Remembering what Jaime and the others told him about you. Only interacting with everyone here in the Tower, showing you true self in a way. Though afraid and scared of the outside. Especially mingling with others. Wanting to stay hidden and out of sight. It made sense from your appearance. Unlike Gar who embraced it and wasn't afraid, you where the opposite. Even after a year of being here. You truly did consider yourself a monster, which she could relate to. Watching Jaime who finally got you to look at him, say a few more words. Which made you respond with a nod and smile. He gives you a hug and ruffles your hair, followed by a dabs lets you go. \"Sorry.\"You apologize to Terra. \"It's alright. Let's just hurry up and get out of here...\"She glances at Gar annoyed, pushing you out the room. Going to a few more flowers, allowed you and Terra to actually have a pleasant and decent talk. Coming to the training room, where Starfire was combating holograms. When she spots you and Terra. Rather surprised the two of you together, but also glad. \"Terra and Violet. Would you two like to join me?\"She invited.\"The staff helps clear the mind.\" \"That's alright.\"You tell her.\"I just came to...you know.\"Holding up the flowers, when you spot Raven meditating in the corner and go over to her. \"No thanks.\"Terra declines.\"Trying to avoid green bean for awhile. I never cared much for the zoo.\" \"If he's bothering you..\"Starfire walks over. Which Terra dismisses.\"He's just a jerk. Though as you can you see, help flower girl.\"Looking at you with Raven. Who stopped with her meditation for you. Watching the two of you talk. She didn't know what was being said, but could see it was something, by the way Raven looked at you.\"Is it true what they say?About her? She has their father trapped in the jewel in her head?\" \"Yes. His name is Trigon.\"Starfire tells her.\"He's a demon. They have issues.\" \"Why doesn't Violet?\" \"Raven took on that responsibility. To spare them both. At least her sister.\" Terra looks from you to Raven.\"It's hard to believe their actually blood related. At least father wise. The only they have are matching eye colors, in away. What about Violet? I was told she killed her mother.\" \"Yes.\"Starfire sadly says.\"Against her wishes. Her mother tormented her and left her to still to be. You wouldn't know it.\" \"Honestly, you wouldn't. Not by the way she's always smiling. She has destructive powers, yet she came make something wonderful.\"Terra looks down at the flowers in her hands.\"If she wanted she could end it.\" \"Yes. But that what makes Violet very admirable and kind. Her life wasn't all flowers and roses. Excuse my choice of words. Rather grim and bleak. She never saw what life was except in darkness. Now, she enjoys every bit of beauty. I am glad to see the two of you together. Violet is rather approachable and can easily forgive.\" \"Still...\"Terra continues watching you and Raven finish up. You giving her a flower, which she takes.\"Her appearance really does contrast with her actual self.\" \"Appearances aren't everything. Violet proves that.\"Starfire said rather proud. \"Hmm...\" \"You talk to Raven more,\"She suggest to Terra.\"You can find that Raven be quite interesting.\"' \"No thanks. To creepy for me. I'd rather handle her sister. At least I'll get some sort of response.\"Terra said ending the talk the second you came over.\"Ready?\" \"Yes.\"You say, then turn to Starfire.\"Here.\"Giving her one of the last bouquet you had. She smells them.\"What a wonderful smell. It's going to be wonderful knowing I'll be seeing these all the time now. Thank you.\" \"...Yeah...Come one Terra.\"You hurry and leave. Down in the Tower's control room, Dick was at work adding and configuring data from the last mission to add to the data from the previous ones. On Brother Blood the leader of a cult group. Pulling up the most recent footage of Brother Blood. An interview with a news reporter: \"Lies. My church is a holy place and strive only to do good.\" \"Come now Brother Blood, it's your church just a glorified cult.\" \"Unlike you Bryce, I believe in a America where all beliefs should be treated with respect. It's a shame the press doesn't.\"Blood gets up ripping off his mic and leaves. \"I'm afraid that's all we're going to get from Brother Blood. I'm Bryce Peterson. Have a good night.\"The video ends. Just as Damian comes in, dressed in his Robin attire.\"Grandfather would have been impressed with Blood. A world wide cult as well as H.I.V.E.\" Dick turns around to him.\"They're the same thing. He just makes them look separate. Do you ever get out of that uniform?\"He gestures to Robin's costume. \"Only when I bathe.\"Robin tells him. \"Might be time.\" Prompting Damian to give himself a sniff.\"I'm good. Going out.\" \"I here you're gone a lot. Where do you go?\"Dick asked. \"You realize I'm not a child who needs permission to go outside.\"Damian said defensively.\"Correct?\" \"Damian I wasn't interrogation you.\"Dick tells him.\"Just taking an interest.\" Changing Damian's mood.\"Oh. I go on patrol. Anyway I should offer my congratulations on you co-habitation, Grayson. Starfire has proven herself to be a decent leader. I approve.\" \"Thank you. By the way, if you're wondering. 9:30.\"Dick cheerful demeanor became serious. \"9:30?\"Damian repeats, not following what Dick was talking about.\"What do you mean 9:30?\"Reading in-between the words, he caught.\"Oh. That won't happen, we're both professionals now. There isn't need for that. She'll be living with her new family. New life in a manner of speaking. We'll see each other on missions.\" Leading Dick to chuckle.\"Oh okay.\" \"She's more than welcome to come by the Tower anytime, to watch movies or play the games.\"Robin rants.\"It will be nice to have her company here. Even if for a little while. We spent a year living under one roof. That is sufficient enough. We're not children anymore.\" \"Damian.\" \"So, it's alright. Again there is no need for the 9:30 rule Grayson. When there clearly won't be one. She prefers to stay inside anyway. Again we had a year to do those things so it's alright. I don't know where you are assuming such a thing. We're just...just..\" \"Damian.\"Dick finally gets to him, calming the ranting boy down.\"You're thinking way out there. It's alright. It really is, you're more than welcome to come by anytime. I'm sure Violet would love for you too. If you want to know, every 1st and 4th Friday of each month they have a movie time in the park. I hear it's pretty good. You should try that.\" \"...\"Damian grunts a bit.\"Thank you, but that's alright.\" Dick scoffs shaking his head.\"It's been nearly a year and still you haven't bothered to as-\" \"If you are assuming that I am afraid, than you're mistaken.\"Damian defends himself, becoming defensive again. Seeing this Dick puts his hands up to settle his flames. \"Alright. Alright calm down.\"Dick tells him.\"No need to become flared. What I mean, is that...\"He pauses, leaving Damian wondering. \"That? That what?\"Damian presses.\"Grayson?\" Looking at him, Dick wasn't sure how to say it, by reading in-between Damian's words, Dick knew this change was bothering Damian. Though the young man wouldn't admit it. Even after all this time Dick still found it rather amazing how Damian still thought about it. He still carried that mind set with him about his cousin. Feeling unworthy. He couldn't let his guard down for a bit. Whether Damian would admit or not, Dick knew he didn't like his cousin moving. The best to not deal with it, pretend it wasn't there. Back with you and Terra, you just had one more stop to make. Dick. Figuring out he was in the control room head there.\"So? Tell me why you're not so stoke to move?\"Terra brought. \"...You can tell can't you.\"You admit.\"It's not that I'm not happy about it. Don't get me wrong, I've always did to live with my cousin. I just...\" \"Did?\"Terra points out.\"What do you mean did?\" \"It's nothing.\"You stop and take out the key. Solemnly looking at it.\"...\" \"Hey.\"Terra comes over placing her hand on your's.\"No one says have too. What's really holding you back?\" Sighing, you put the key away.\"It's nothing. Come on.\" The two of you make it to where Dick was, overhearing him telling Starfire he hadn't found anything in H.I.V.E. files just yet. But he was still checking.\"So you haven't found squat.\"Terra snarks.\"I love endangering my life for nothing.\" \"Which is why I added the newest files ones too damage to read from the previous ravings. I'm hoping the computer will find the connection we missed. It may take the program a day or two.\"Dick tells everyone. \"Not your worst idea.\"Robin quips at him.\"What?\"Your giggle in the background made them stop and look at you. Quickly you cover your mouth. Apologizing through chuckles.\"S-Sorry. Ahem, sorry. Damian? Where are you off to?\"You ask as he walks by. \"On patrol.\"He tells you, feeling eyes on him, finding Dick giving him a coaxing look. Nodding over to you. Now Damian realized what Dick meant. He flusters, while mumbling under his breath. \"Did you say something?\"You barely hear what he's saying.\"Damian?\" \"No.\"He snaps.\"I mean no. I was just..in deep thought. Anyway, excuse me.\"He looks at the flowers you had and picks one out.\"It seems your green thumb is getting better.\"Putting it in back into the bouquet, when he realized he actually put in your hair.\"Sorry...\"He mutters, looking away. Coughing. Scratching the back of his head. \"Thank you.\"You said rather surprised. Looking at him a bit confused. But smile. He kept his eyes adverted, trying to muster up what the words, to be seconds too late. You left him.\"I bought these for you,\"Dick.\"Going over to your cousin. Damian watches you give them to Grayson. Who takes them, thanking you then pulls you into a tight hug. Planting a kiss on your cheek. Starfire stood over you both smiling at it. Having enough, Damian leaves to have Gar transformed as a praying mantis fly right into his face. Asking about Jaime. Which Terra points out he was right there. All eyes turn to the screen seeing surveillance of Jaime going at, with his punching bag. Rather aggressively. No, not aggressive, it was more anger and frustration than anything. Something was bothering him. Something was wrong. This wasn't the Jaime you knew. \"Jaime...\"You whisper. Jaime's punches became more and more aggressive till he used enough force and punches the bag straight off. \"Somethings wrong.\"Starfire now worried. Turning to Gar and Terra.\"Maybe you should go. Might be good to have two of you down there.\" Rolling her eyes, Terra didn't want to. Unless for a price.\"Fine. Only if you come.\"She points to you. Walking over grabbing you by the wrist. Nearly yanking you away from Dick. \"It's alright.\"You tell her, taking your wrist back. But her grip wasn't going to give up.\"I-I rather stay...\"Withdrawing away. Earning a scoff from her.\"Oh. No you're coming. It's only fair.\" \"Fair?\"You look at her confused and upset. \"Yes. Fair. I went with you throughout the Tower to change the flowers.\"She brings up.\"So it's only fair you come with me, outside. I did something you needed to do. So you have to do something I have to do. It's actually a fair trade off.\" Her points where defiantly valid, but, it still angered you. Knowing she was doing this for her own purpose and nothing else. Slightly sicken you. She used you. Which you didn't take to kindly. And she saw it, everyone did. Your flames flare up, around you. Enraged. \"Thoust used me?! How DARE THEE!\"Your voice rises, your eyes begin turn black.\"Such a sinful and cruel thing thoust has done.\" \"Whoa...\"Terra steps back scared. You step to her. \"Violet.\"Dick gets up calling to you like the rest.\"Calm down. Calm down.\"You shoot him sharp look, baring your teeth. \"I shall not be used!\"Glaring back at Terra. They knew that snapped look. \"Violet. No!\"Damian hurries to stop you. Terra steps in front of him and stares you down. \"It's only fair because, I hung out with you. Now you hangout with me. I didn't mean to use you. I just...I just...\"She takes the flower from her hair and holds it out. It surprisingly calmed you down. Extinguishing your flames. Taking hold of the flower, see her true intentions. Giving her back the flower. She takes it looking right at you. She could see your flaring fear and reluctance.\"What's the worst that can happen?\"She said with a smirk. Elsewhere at Brother Blood's fortress, the man was bathing in a tub full of blood. As his most loyal follower, Mother Mayhem walked over. \"Ah, there you are Mayhem.\"He greets her.\"Punctual as always.\" \"How can you be so calm,\"She questions.\"That was the third base the Titans have destroyed.\" \"My plan is 9 centuries in the making, in every age there are always those who oppose. But, as you can see I am always victorious.\"Hanging behind by his wrist, with a slight across their throat, all their blood drained out. The reporter Bryce Peterson. Slightly shocking Mayhem.\"Is that the reporter?\" \"Yes. Our friend won't be asking impertinent questions anymore.\" \"His heresy does not compare to the Titans.\"She disagrees. Looking away as Blood emerges from his soaking. His two followers quickly clean him off.\"We barely escaped.\" \"But you did.\"Blood reminds and praises her.\"He warned you. Our guardian angel. Oh stop your fretting Mayhem. He'll keep the Titans at bay. I've foreseen it. Plus I pay the bastard enough.\" On the streets in the city, walking, pretty much following a heated and annoyed Jaime. Pretty much tagging along as Starfire wanted them to. Gar and Terra along with another. Who was kept their face half way covered with a scarf. Nervously trailing behind Gar and Terra, their eyes shifting from left to right, trying hard not to flip out in anyway. Deeply regretting on leaving the Tower. Wishing to return back. Slightly hyperventilating, while trying to hum to their fears away. You. Why did you decide to come out? This was just crazy, this was so stupid. It would be safer if you stayed back at the Tower. Cursing under your breath for allowing Terra to take you and you stupidly going along with it. She literally shoved you out the door. Of course you where for Jaime. concerned about him. He still had yet to tell anyone what was bothering him. What made it worse, you could feel it ten times more and was causing your other side to go crazy. Humming was what you could to do suppress it. For not at least. \"Could you slow down Jaime.\"Gar tells him. \"Go back to the Tower then.\"Jaime snaps back.\"No body asked you to come.\" \"Someone did.\"You mumble under your breath, causing Terra to look back at you.\"...\" \"I heard that.\"She glares at you. \"Aww come on,\"Gar hurries over to him.\"We're here to support you.\" \"I'm not.\"Terra bluntly admits. Throwing away her soda. Stunning Gar and Jaime who stop and look back at her. Realizing what she said, she re-words it.\"What I mean is, I respect Jaime not wanting to talk. In fact more people should learn to shut their mouths.\"She looks to Gar. Who just smiles. \"Well that's no fun.\"He said. \"I wanna go back home.\"You whine, noticing Jaime's focus and attention on something else.\"Jaime? What is it?\"Walking to his side. Looking in the same direction.\"Gabrielle's Horn.\"You read. Noticing homeless people lined up outside.\"How sad.\"You express.\"Their sorrow. Their sadness. It's like a river.\" \"What a way to be poetic.\"Terra quips. \"Okay I give.\"Gar at a lost, coming over with Terra. Not sure what Jaime was suddenly so interested. \"The center.\"Jaime points to it.\"My parents volunteer for the one in my town.\" \"And?\"Terra said not caring. \"Maybe I should volunteer.\"Jaime suggest. Making Terra scoff at the notation.\"Yeah. Right. We're Titans we don't severe soup.\" \"You don't have to move a mountain to help people Terra.\"Jaime tells her.\"Besides, I've got to find a way to make the bug more comfortable about humans.\" That was a good thought, you couldn't agree more with him. Looking back at the center, at all those people. Seeing them, brought back haunting memories for yourself. Those same people, yeah, you remember helping them. And by help, not the good kind Jaime wanted to do. Their lives already miserable as it was, you ended that misery. Permanently. Shuttering at the horrible thought, you turn heel and hurry to leave.\"I'm going back to the Tower.\"You tell them.\"I...I just can't be her-\" \"Hold it.\"Terra stops you.\"You're to spend the whole time like me with Jaime. Trade isn't done.\" Exhaling you kindly disagree.\"It is now.\"Quickly casting your eyes back.\"I'd rather not...Look it's complicated. You wouldn't understand. I'd rather not be around...around all of that. Too many and too much...I'd rather not be uncomfortable. It's best I stay away from things...like this.\"Gesturing to center.\"Like Jaime's bug, I'm not..well keen on being around others.\" \"Perfect then.\"Jaime grabs by the wrist.\"Then this is the perfect place for you. You need to get some social skills back Hermona. You've been lacking in that area for some time now.\"Before you could object he drags you off with him. Terra and Gar watch, following behind a few seconds after. Resisting wouldn't help, with Jaime using his strength to keep you with him. The two of you enter, now uncomfortable and tensed. Feeling...feeling...nothing. A surprise really. There was no malice. No depression. Nothing vile or drench in despair. It was the opposite. It was rather calm and content. It scared you, grabbing hold of Jaime's hand, squeezing it. Inching yourself closer to him, to stop and look around at everyone. It strangely awing. Made you wonder what you where scared about. Your hold on Jaime loosened, that you didn't know he slipped away. Leaving you standing there. The voices, you didn't hear them. They too where silent and tranquil. \"Well, seems like someone is enjoying themselves.\"Terra looks at you. Gar looks and smiles. \"That's good.\"He said.\"It's been a long time since, Vi been like that. Haven't seen that look on her face in a long time. Glad you made her come with us. That was really nice of you.\" \"Nice? She just owed me.\"Terra said rather harsh. Crossing her arms.\"It's only fair. I helped her, she came with me.\" \"Come on?\"Gar nudges her.\"That's not true.\"Terra glances at him, telling him otherwise. Which he demises.\"Look at her.\"He points, she quickly glances to fully stare. You where inching your way over to a table, reluctant at first. Watching the people eat. There was something in your eyes, she noticed. Filled with guilt and yet alienated. She didn't understand that look. It puzzled her. Hearing Jaime call you over, watching you go to him. He introduces you to some other girl.\"Those two are rather close. Aren't they?\" \"Yeah.\"Gar says.\"Jaime's always had a soft spot for Vi. Their both pretty much alike actually. It's rather funny and creepy. Both of their powers kind of make them rather distant from the world around them.\" \"And it's not because she's a demon and fallen angel.\"Terra said rather crude and sarcastic.\"That really won't make her that way. If you ask me it's because she's just weird.\"She looks at you. Watching you pull up your scarf.\"...Guess that's good.\" \"It's good all around.\"Gar cheers. Flashing her a toothy smile. \"Still it's creepy when she smiles. Then again, guess everyone has to hide their scars one way or another.\"She whispers the last part to herself. Watching you smile behind the scarf at the other girl. Jaime ruffling your hair. It made her smile, which left her with a strange feeling.[Chapter 41] \"Where do you want this?\"Terra asked holding up some of your things. You give them a quick glance. \"In that box.\"You tell her pointing to the one by your closet. She puts them in there. Though decides to browse through a few of the boxes, pulling out a couple of things. \"Occult of Sadism? Nine Levels of Hell? Crucifixion of the Soul?\"She reads rather eeried out.\"What the? Apostles of Lucifer? Scrolls of Etrigan? Okay...This is umm...interesting. Honestly I'm shocked.\" \"I like to collect different readings.\"You tell her. Closing up a box and sealing it.\"I have ancient one too. From King Arthur's time. From the sorceress Morgan Le Fey too. Their quite informative. Oh, my favorite. This is a good one.\"You take out the book and hand it to her. She reads it causing her eyes to nearly pop out.\"Satisfaction of Devouring Souls.\" \"One of my favorites. Especially chapter 4.\" \"Wh-What's chapter 4 about?\"Terra asked, though regretted the question. \"Damning souls.\"You said plainly, with a smile.\"I also have a copy of the Book of the Dead too. That one I'm still trying to get through.\" \"I-I'm just going to put this down.\"Terra tosses back, shivering.\"Do you have anything in here that isn't...isn't I don't know...Salem Witch Trial?\" \"Oh!\" \"Let me guess, you have a book on that too.\"She guess right.\"I shouldn't be surprised.\" Chuckling to yourself, you assure you did have normal books.\"I do have some on botany and baking. No potions for the baking. There should be one in there about Chemistry too. From school.\" Terra digs in the box, finding them rather buried. Taking out the books that covered them, she finds a couple of them. But what caught her eye, was you year book. She takes it out and flips through some the pages, stopping every now and then to read some of the messages. \"Wow..\"She with a tinge of sorrow. Her eyes read over every single word. Moving through the book, she finds some pictures of you. Back to what you looked like. It surprised her. Never had seen what you looked like before. So use to seeing what you looked now. Black hair instead of white. Normal skin, instead of this chalky pale. One though that hadn't changed, your smile. Well, if she could call it one. Studying it closer, there was a difference in the smiles. Here in the pictures your smile where small and timid. The smile you had on now, was still small but bright and content. If not merry. Did you not like your life back then? Looking at what the picture read under. \"Chemistry Club.\" \"Botany Queen.\" \"Gymnastic 3rd place.\" There where a good amount of titles that you had. So, this was your life before. A school girl. Looking at your rather prestigious uniform. The school you went to was no doubt a private one, high class it seemed. By the silver crest on the uniform. So you where loaded. Then again, maybe from whom ever housed you. Going through it, seeing other pictures of you and message written to you. When a couple of pictures fell out. Picking them up, gave her more a insight of you. What she saw surprised her. It was you jamming. Yes, jamming on a guitar. With Dick. Someone clearly took the picture of the two of you, looking rather punkish and rock starish. Make up and all. Tongues sticking out. This had to Dick's place, older place. There was another one of you two, still with your rock star grab on. A close this time. The two of you where so happy and goofy. Showed the love between the two. It amazed her still, how much Dick loved you, even though the two you weren't even remotely related. Pictures like this, she'd expect you'd have with Raven. Then again, it was only not to long ago you found out she was sisters. That still was baffled her. Going through a few more, one of Christmas with you and Dick. A couple of either you or him. These where old no doubt. Looking at the other boxes she didn't know why, but she begin to search through some of the boxes find a few other pictures. These more recent. It was with the others, before Damian. You where still human looking, she stops on one with Gar trying to kiss you. Going to the next one, to see him to being pushed out the way by Jaime. She couldn't help but find it funny. Going through a few more, stopping on one with you and Raven. Still in your normal look. This was taken in Photo Booth. Terra saw the tinge of happiness with the two of you, but it was most prompt in the next picture. This one was in your current appearance, it was of you and Raven reading back to back well, you had fallen asleep. Which by the way Raven's eyes slide back looking you, with a small smile that expressed more than Terra knew Raven could show. She was happy and proud. And caring. Going through a couple more, till she came back to the first one. Puts them away and digs for more, like she was trying to find something. Which she did, a couple of framed pictures with everyone. A few older ones. None she realized of you as baby. Which was completely understandable. Though there was one she was trying to find, that she hadn't been able to, which was rather strange. \"I never realized how many pictures I have.\"Your voice behind her, startled her a bit. That she accidentally drops one of the frames. \"Sorry.\"She apologizes picking it up. Dusting it off.\"You do have a great deal of pictures.\" Sitting next to her on the floor, look at the picture she had. You smile fondly remembering this moment.\"Yes. I like pictures, it's my way of persevering all that I've missed out. In life. Enjoy the best parts of life.\" \"I guess.\"Terra said, ravaging through the box again.\"I've noticed you have a great deal of pictures of you and everyone else. But, none of you and Boy Wonder.\" Knowing who she was talking about, you had a answer.\"He is in group pictures. See.\"You how her. She gives you a deadpan look.\"That's not what I mean.\"Taking out the photo of everyone with her in it.\"I mean just the two of you. You're both close right? Like close, close.\"Crossing her fingers. \"I know what you mean.\"You tell with a soft chuckle, looking back at the picture. Your eyes linger on him for a few moments and take a deep sigh.\"We've been through a lot. Damian and myself. He's...he's my best friend.\"Your do your best to keep your voice from cracking.\"It's funny, when we first met. Those years ago. Look at us now.\" \"...You really care for him don't you?\" You nod your head.\"Yeah. It seems though...whenever, whenever caring becomes too much..Life has a funny way of preventing it.\"Hugging the frame against your chest. The depressed and heart breaking look you had, left Terra speechless. She wasn't sure what to say.\"It's alright though.\"You come back and put it the frame back in the box.\"That's what pictures are for. I'm not moving that far. Thank you again for helping my pack.\"You turn to her.\"It's been really helpful.\" \"Sure. I had nothing better to do.\"She dismiss nonchalantly.\"Rather be in here, than around that zoo. So, you really want to move?\" \"I have my things packed, don't I.\" \"Yeah, ya do. But, packing and actually wanting to move are two different things. Not once have you even bothered to smile about the whole thing. It's like a funeral in here, seeing you with such a grim look. You're not even remotely happy. And not to mention, you're seriously dragging your feet in packing. Because, really you didn't need me.\"Looking around the room.\"Why don't you just tell your cousin you don't want to go.\" Her words where so simple and easy. Yet, they also where conflicting. It made you chuckle and cry. You didn't know which one you wanted to choose, so you did both. \"...\" Terra didn't know what to do, seeing you break like this. Cracked. Eventually you pull yourself together, wiping your eyes.\"Y-You okay?\"She was afraid to ask. You give her a nod.\"Yes. Sorry. To be honest, I don't know which to choose. I've always dreamed of living with my cousin, since day one. But, circumstance prevented it. So, I guess now I can. Yet,\"your voice trails off.\"I...\" Thinking quickly she changes the topic.\"Hey, I've been curious about your powers. I mean, not that much. Where do they come from? Your father? Trigon?\" The mention of his name flared your hated for a second, but you calmed down.\"You could say so.\"You said coldly.\"These, these powers of mine,\"Looking at your hands. Wrenched with a burning rage and shame.\"They weren't given out of love. None of me is. These are more a curse than a blessing. Ironic considering who my mother is.\"Igniting your hand with your fire just a little. \"So, is are you powers the same as your sister's?\"She inquires. \"Well, in some ways. We both can't give into our urges.\"You lament.\"If we do, well...it won't be pretty. You've seen what I can do. The difference between us though...she has to keep her self in check. While my powers must be unleashed. It burns..burns all the time keep them inside.\"She hears the pain and struggle in your words.\"I relish when they are free. I enjoy it. You see Terra, I want to burn everything. All the time.\"Your voice goes deeper, your eyes black and empty. A malice twisted smile stretched across your face. Followed by a cackle.\"It will be so much fun. To see those wretched souls burn! Wouldn't you agree?\"Looking at her, stopping sensing her rising fear. Even if she kept her cool. Doing your best not to enjoy such a treat. Apologize.\"Forgive me.\" \"N-No...\"she exhales.\"It's alright. All that is in you, can't imagine the burden you feel. Everyday.\" \"Every fiber in my body, but, it's alright.\"You tell her, back to normal self.\"Despite it all, I know things are good. My blood is tainted and so is my soul, but, I will keep believing in the good. It's the only thing I have really.\" \"That's why you enjoy see society from afar. You feel their cruelty.\"She speculates. \"...Yeah...I've caused enough harm already. These markings, my appearance will be reminder no matter what.\"You give her a broken smile.\"...I'll always be nothing but a walking sin. The embodiment of it. A-A..\" \"Witch. Demon.\"Terra whispers to herself. Finding you staring.\"What?\" \"Terra...thank you.\"You embrace her. Stunning her.\"Thank you. Why don't we put a few more things away,\"Standing up.\"You want to help me in the kitchen? Making chicken strips tonight. Spicy kinds.\"Holding your hand out.\"What do you say?\" She looks at you weird, shaking her head smirking. Taking your hand stands up with you.\"Sure.\" After about another hour, the two of you finish and head to the chicken. Just as she said, she helped you get dinner ready. She did burn some, but that was okay. Once it was done, she pages everyone about it. They come minus one, Damian. Whom you had a good idea where he was. Putting his plate aside, you go and find him. Knowing his emotion the best out of everyone, nearly imprinted on you. Find him going over some thing. \"Brought you some dinner.\"You try to get his attention. Which didn't work, so you go over to him. Setting it down next to him. He gives it a glance.\"Thanks.\"His tone pretty much telling you to leave. Sighing, you leave to stop and look back at him. Opening your mouth to shut it.\"Damian...\"You mutter under your breath just before leaving and just as he glances back.[Chapter 42] That shaking, no...trembling. Violet tremble, an earthquake? No. Your eyes shot open and you jolt out of bed just in time to catch Richie's cage before it feel. He was going wild in a frenzy. You manage to calm him down, opening up his door he flies straight out and out the window. Knowing he was safe you hurry out your room, stumbling just a bit from the violent shake. You knew who it was from, racing down the halls in your pajamas. A large shirt. Reaching the source of earthquake.\"Terra!\"You call to her, entering her room along with the others. See her convulsing in her sleepShe was suffering from a nightmare, which wasn't good. Calling upon her powers. She was going to bring the whole place down.\"Terra.\" \"Don't!\"Damian stops you.\"She's going to be bring the building down.\" \"I can help.\"Raven goes and attempts to calm Terra down. Easing her troubled mind and nightmares. \"*Gasp* What are you doing?!\"Terra wakes up startled finding Raven, shoving her away.\"Get off me!\"You go catch your sister. \"I got you.\"You host her up. She gives a nod thanking and assuring you. \"You where shaking everything.\"Starfire tells her.\"Terra, we came to see if you're alright.\" \"Are you alright?\"Dick asked. \"It was a freaky nightmare.\"Terra said rudely. \"Nightmare?\"You go over to her offering help.\"Do you, do you want to talk about it? I know nightmares, they...they can be-\" \"I'm fine. It's none of your concern.\"She snaps shooting you a glare turning away.\"So get going.\" \"Terra.\"You to get her to reconsider. But she didn't.\"You heard me. Get going! You too greenie!\"Referring to Gar. Everyone leaves, you where about to try again, but Damian stops you and leads you out. The door slides shut.\"Just leave it alone.\"Damian tells you. You couldn't.\"I can't. She carries such traumatic...\"Your voice tightens and weeps.\"..Nightmares never go away.\"Mutter relishing painfully at your own memories. Cringing from the screeching voices of your reminder.\"...Vexing voices.\"You snarl about to lose it. To be calmed and soothed by Raven.\"It's alright. Go to bed.\"Adhering you do as she says and bid her a good night. In the same night at a cemetery, Blood talks to the tombstones. To be unnerved by his contact by resurrected Deathstroke who calls out to stop being creepy. Which Blood tells him that he speaks wisps of life still in the corpses; sometimes there's enough life for resurrection. Referring to the mercenary. \"What do you want Blood?\"Slade sighs stepping out of from the shadows. \"I want you to move everything up by a week.\"Blood tells him.\"I've waited long enough Deathstroke.\" \"That wasn't the deal.\"He states, until Blood made him agree. \"I'll double your price.\"Blood adds.\"Is that acceptable? As before I want ALL the Titans. Can you do it?\" After last nights rocky evening, things did eventually mellow out. Everyone awoke like normal, today this morning, there was a group training session. Starfire's orders. To help the group, prepare everyone for any unexpected fights. Though first things first, breakfast for everyone. With help from Jaime and a goofing off Gar, you three made with a bit of a mess, pancakes for everyone. Covered in a little bit of batter. Even with the messy, breakfast still went well. \"Gonna miss doing this.\"Jaime tells you, putting his plate in the sink with you. Before you could say anything Gar, in perches on your shoulder in his parrot form. Squawking.\"Yep! We make some mean cakes! The three amigos in the baño.\" \"That's bathroom.\"Jaime corrects him.\"You mean cocina.\" \"Yeah.\"Gar re-corrects himself.\"The cocina. Gonna invite us over to make some mean slapjacks at your new place?\" \"...Ye-Yeah. Sure.\" \"Well don't sound too happy.\"Gar squawks, flapping his wings. Before flying off spotting Terra. \"He does have a point though.\"Jaime comes over dusting off one of Gar's feathers.\"You don't sound too thrilled. Don't you want to move?\" \"Come let us get ready.\"Starfire tells everyone, saving you from answering. Thanking your luck hurry to and get ready. Outside the Tower in the back on the training grounds, everyone was dressed and ready. You stood next Blue and Gar. Starfire and Nightwing stood before everyone, her with her bo staff and asserts herself to the team. Explain what everyone will be doing. To demonstrate, she and Nightwing pair off and spar. Though it looked more like a brawl than a spar. Ending with Starfire being the victor. Nightwing gets up off the ground.\"That was not a confidant booster.\" \"You did very well.\"Starfire commends him.\"You lasted far longer than this time.\"Terra finding what she said in dirty humor.\"I meant in training of course. He's very proficient when we have se-\" \"Korry!\"Nightwing stops her from saying anything embarrassing further. \"Blue Beetle. Raven.\"Starfire calls them up next to go. You watch them both walk out to the center confidently.\"So?\"Terra looks your way.\"Who do think is going to win?\" \"Their both strong.\"You tell her, looking back finding their fight had started. \"Yeah.\"Terra agrees.\"But, who's stronger? Who's gonna win? Bird or bug? Sister or brother?\"Now she teasing you.\"Demon or alien? Earth or fire?\" Doing your best not get agitated, Keep your cool.\"They're both strong.\"You reiterate with a grunt.\"It only matters they come out safe with little to injuries sustained.\" Sensing your attitude just a Terra kind of drops it.\"Well, their really going at it? Aren't they?\"You didn't say anything. Just preferred to remain focus on the fight. Blue took to higher grounds, having his shield and blaster out. Telling Raven his scarab didn't want to loose. And neither did Raven. It was rather suspenseful and nerve racking watching them both. Your mind felt split on them both, whom to worry about more and who you wanted to come out the victor. Yet watching them, a tight knot settled in your stomach. Recalling the few times you'd come out here to just fly. With Blue mostly and sometimes Raven. Though you and Raven would actually test each other in skill of power. Realizing you wouldn't able to just do that as you please. Glancing over at Starfire and Nightwing, whom the latter caught your glance and gives you a wink. A huge blast whipped your head back around to the fight.\"SISTER! RAVEN!\"You panic seeing her upon the ground defeated, rushing over to her. That you didn't notice Terra inching her way over Starfire. Reaching Raven, she was fine sitting up. \"I'm fine.\"She tells you and Blue. Listening for a moment to Trigon's voice in the gem. Which you heard pretty well.\"Though dad feel I disgraced myself.\"To her amusement. Looking to you.\"I'm sure you heard him, you'd better not disgrace yourself either.\" Rolling your eyes scoffing with a smile.\"Well, I guess he will have to be.\"Getting up, you help her too.\"I'm on the side.\" \"Not anymore.\"Terra smirks walking over standing, ready to face off.\"What? Didn't you catch on? Earth or fire? Besides might as well get in our last fight, before you know...move. Cause we can't have it all the time now.\"She stretches.\"Well? Let's go. You're mother said it was alright.\"Thumbing over to Starfire, who gives you a wave. Just like a mother. Nightwing didn't help with his thumbs up attitude. Cringing inside bothered.\"I'd rather not.\"You decline.\"Side lines is just fine with me.\"Turning to walk back by Gar. Still Terra keep trying to bait you on.\"Come on. You seriously told me that your powers always enjoy being unleashed. Because, right now I'm not seeing it.\" You stop counting down, whispering happy memories to yourself. As the voices screech around you, baiting and calling you out on being weak. For not accepting Terra's challenge. Managing to have some control decline again.\"No...It's alright.\" \"Come on? What's the worst that can happen?\" You don't how she did, but Terra roped you into taking part of the training session. Both of you stand across. You really didn't want to do this, but there was no turning back now. Taking your stance, just as she did her smirk hadn't left her yet. Which was actually bothering you. Gearing your powers to be ready, wait for the go from Starfire. The second she gives it, Terra waste no time and takes offense on you. Hurling a good chunk of earth. Which you manage to avoid, but had to blast the second that came. That wasn't all, feeling the ground beneath you sink and yourself sinking. Quickly manifest your wings and take to the sky. Up here you couldn't be harmed. Or so you thought, forgetting she too could in a sense simulate flight. By use of riding one of her boulders. \"Heads up!\"She laughs hurling another boulder at you, this time it hit. Knocking you out the sky like a fly to the light. Nightwing was about to act, to be restrained by Starfire. She looks at him disapproving.\"This is training. She has too.\" Though understanding, he didn't like it. Watching you drop down, you hadn't shown consciousness. The ground was approaching you fast, Terra who was lavishing in her easy win, didn't realize what she did until she saw it. \"Shit!\"She hisses and dives down to you. When your eyes shoot open and your wings sprout out. Catching her by surprise, like a rocket you blast up towards her. You where faking it this whole time. Impressive. Praises would have to wait. Thinking quickly she flips off the rock she rode just before your fire blast destroys. Calling for another one, landing on it. Turns around and hurls a few more large rocks at you, which you the aerial advantage. Dodging the rocks, using one to push off and transfer your flames to your fist. Going into hand to hand combat. Terra nearly forgot you switched it up. She gets ready to jump off, but you land in front of her before she could and throw a direct punch. That out of sheer luck dodges. So you throw another one, she had to bob and weave to avoid getting hit. Otherwise, she'd suffer a 1st degree burn. \"Well,\"She said through breaths.\"This is rather impressive, but you're still holding back.\"She splits the boulder and uses it to entangle you. Dropping you back to the ground, this time it wasn't a long drop. Your binds shattered hitting the ground. It hurt. In a daze for a second, you realize you're back on the ground. And just as the ground tried to swallow you up, you slam your hand down, causing your tattoos to flash. The ground shook and hellfire erupts in a straight line at her. She maneuvers out the way, then takes to higher ground. Jumping off, calling another boulder for that to be completely incinerated. \"Whoa. Look.\"Blue points taking notice. There plastered across your face a enthusiastic smirk. It was rather creepy with your eyes glowering.\"She's really enjoying it.\" Raven looks at you, ignoring Trigon's outrage screams of his dissatisfaction on your performance, while she lavishes happy to see it. Still jumping from boulder to boulder to get away, Terra manages to get some distance. Landing back on the ground. Causing an quake, knocking you balance just a bit. Breaking your attack, with you slightly distracted she throws some stones at you. Shooting them at you like bullets, your wings come out and shield. In fact it completely wrapped you in a blazing sphere. Even hurling a large rock just incinerated upon contact. She realized it wasn't going to work. So she came up with something else. Using both hands, brings up two walls of earth and squeezes them on you. Adding more earth and pressure, till you cracked. Your sphere. Terra struggled a bit, but kept it up.\"I'm going to pop you like a bubble wrap.\" Inside the sphere you could feel the pressure around you, on your wings and it hurt. The pain was excruciating, but you hold it in and keep up your sphere. You wouldn't break. You wouldn't. Thinking of a what to do and how to counter this, so many thoughts race through your mind. You could do that, then this would happen or could...no that wouldn't work. There was only one way, it left you with just a slitter of an opening. Your tattoos glow and let out a powerful burst. Sending a slight blast outward, breaking the pressing walls. You fix your wings and fly straight up. \"I don't think so!\"Terra shoots her hand up, along with a pillar of earth that transforms into a giant arm and hand. Grabbing you tightly and yanks you back down.\"You're not even trying. Come on, let loose like you said.\" Releasing another emission blast from you, destroy the hand. Setting yourself free, twisting around and fling what you formed from your fire right at her. If she didn't put up a earth wall that flame blade would have surely gotten her. She stares wide eyed, she hadn't seen this before. Before her mind could process, she quickly puts up another earth wall on her side before she was struck by one of your flamed punches. Thrusting her hand forward pushes the earth wall back on you. Rather violently. Hearing your body hit the ground, now was her chance. Commanding the earth to capture you, when you appear behind her.\"Whoa!\"She crosses her arms in front of her, to protect her. You accidentally grab her by the wrist in your hyped state. Which wasn't good. Horrible, just horrible and cruel imagines of screaming and screeching people yelling violently and prejudice at someone. Calling them witch and all other sorts of names. Their emotions spiked to their max and you absorbed them all. Scream in agony, everyone saw what looked like you had been electrocuted. \"AHHHHH!\"You scream and pull away to be blasted back from the affect. \"VIOLET!\" The others rush over to you, Raven was the first to reach you. Looking over you, she could see you where unresponsive and your markings heavily glowing . Your skin turned darker. Dark veins popping bulging out. Hearing you gasping, no struggling to breath. Trying to heal with her own powers wouldn't work. It just had to take it course. \"How is she?\" \"She's going to be fine.\"Raven tells them, looking over you remaining calm. Ignoring her Trigon's words.\"She just took in..a lot. It just has to run it's course, that's all. She'll be back. We should get her ins-\"She stops hearing you spewing out random words. No doubt from what you where experiencing. Your body began to convulse and jerk.\"She's going into shock!\" \"Wretched souls! Wretched souls!\"You hisses, while spitting up and choke. Starfire managed to hold you down with her strength.\"No. No please. Please...I'm just a little girl...No..\"You begin to weep, shaking your head.\"Why? What did I do to you?\"This wasn't your voice, but another's. It was kind of child like. \"Raven can you try to calm her down?\" \"I'll try.\"Raven wasn't sure she could but tries. Grabs your hand to be shocked. Pulling her hand back and tries a different way. Eventually she managed to calm you down. For now.\"She needs to be put inside.\" \"Here, I've got her.\"Nightwing takes the body of his cousin from Starfire, before someone could do it. Your body was like a limp noodle in his arms. Terra watches you be taken away. While everyone was concerned over you, her mind was somewhere else. Looking at her wrist where you grabbed and rubs the slight burn. A part of her, felt weird. Strange. It was like you took something, no...it was something. And it wasn't good. \"Damn..\"she mutters under her breath.[Chapter 43] \"Witch! Witch!\" \"Burn the Witch!\" \"Kill her! Kill her!\" A little girl, tied up, latched to the back of a truck and dragged through the ground over and over again in a circle before a hateful and prejudice. Spewing words of cruelty and bigotry. It was horrible. They wanted this girl, this young girl dead for being a \"witch\". Traumatizing and horrify, the girl was scared and confused beyond anything. She didn't understand what she did, while hate and anger boiled in her. Your eyes could see it forming inside, the pain of her sadness. To be relished by her own vengeance she wish to desperately take upon the crowd who ostracized them. Determine to kill them. Her hidden screams and pleas, along with the tears in her eyes, begging for an answer. To be set free. But in the crowds eyes, there was no mercy, none at all. Nothing but hate and detest. It was the click of a gun that brought your eyes back. Pointed at the girl, straight her temple with no ounce of kindness only dark and murderous intentions. Nearly mirroring a certain demon. The man who drove the truck, pointed the barrel of his right at the girl. Finger on the trigger ready to pull. \"NO!\"You scream. \"NO!\"You jolt up in a panic, screaming. In a cold sweat. Finding yourself no longer in the woods, no longer around that hate. But in your room, on your bed, scratch that. Dick's bed in the Tower. That...that dream..no memory felt so real. You could still feel its presence, made you shutter and sick. And angry. No, furious, yet sympathetic. So, that was it, that was why...Terra...You thought. That was a memory from her, upon making contact with her. No wonder it knocked you out, it was a strong and full of hate memory of emotions. Stronger than you ever thought, you could feel. Terra. She was the only thing on your mind. You had to find her. You needed to find her. Something was twisted in her and it centered her. It disillusioned her, casting her into something darker. It screamed out in rage and anger, that gave her a twisted joy. Throwing the covers off, jumping out of bed nearly stumbling but catch yourself, hurry to find Terra. Desperately worried. \"Terra?...Terra?\" You call for her down the halls, on each level of the Tower. But did not find her. Where was she? Stopping for a minute to try and locate her, but came up empty. She wasn't in the Tower at all. Not even in her room. There was another way to locate her...the computer room. Dick was down there, you could use the cameras and try see where she went. Hurrying there you nearly run into Jaime.\"Whoa! Violet? You're up.\"He said surprised.\"You doing okay?\" \"Yes.\"You said rather hastily.\"Excuse me, I have to...\" He stops you.\"Whoa. What's going on? You seem really...You're crying!\" Touching under your eyes finding it to be true. You where crying, these weren't you tears. Shocked and a bit confused, you felt not more than ever the need to find Terra. \"I have to find...The voices...The cruelty and inhumane... Excuse me.\"Stepping back you summoning your fire which screeched to engulf you and vanish. Leaving a burnt mark from where you stood and Jaime. \"She needs to be watched Grayson.\"Robin tells Nightwing rather distrustful of a certain member of the team. \"She needs understanding.\"Nightwing disagrees.\"Not surveillance. Terra has her rough edges, but Kori thinks she worth and I agree.\" \"Making decisions with our heart, will get people killed.\" Robin disagrees and in frustration leaves, with Raven following. When all of sudden you appear from your fire in a frantic and panic. Your sudden appearance surprised and alarmed everyone. The second your foot touched the ground, you rush past your cousin into the room and hastily press any button, like you where possessed or something. Because your normal eye color wasn't visible, they where black. And veins where beginning to protrude from the corner. Frustrated you hadn't found what you where do desperately looking, anger getting the best of you, started to raise the heat in the room and you hands began to coat themselves in your hellish fire. All while mutter over and over, Terra's name constantly. Like an obsession. That you didn't realize the effect your panic state was having, until someone yanks you back.\"Violet! What are you doing?!\"Nightwing whips you around, taking a firm hold of your wrist. To let them go from strong heat. Raven steps in before Starfire could and Robin.\"Violet. Calm down. Clear you mind.\"She tells you, using her powers to reach you. She slightly struggled but managed to get you back. Snapping out of it, a bit disoriented and stun for a few seconds.\"...Mmmm...What? Why...Why am I still...\"Touching your eyes, the tears still there. So you wipe them away. This time Starfire stepped in.\"Violet, are you alright?\" \"Huh?!\"You look at her confused, your head stung a bit.\"...Terra...Terra! Where is she?! I-I-I have to find her!\"You dart off, only to stumble and fall. The others gather around you, your eyes turn back to black and your hands move around as if blind.\"Terra?! Terra! Where are you!? No...No don't...Don't do IT!\"You scream, leaving the others confused. \"Violet? What's going on?\"Robin looks to Raven for an explanation. While you weep. \"She must still be affected when she touched Terra.\"Raven gave the best answer she could think of.\"It's just running its course. Violet. Calm your mind.\"She places a hand on your forehead.\"Calm. Calm yourself.\" You try your best to struggle against her, but eventfully settle. The tears stopped and so did everything else. Now at eased and relaxed, that episode took a good deal out of you. Coming back to your senses, apologize to everyone and stand to fall down. Robin managed to catch you. \"I-I...I'm okay...\"You stutter and get out of his hold. Denying anyone else's help and assistance. Shaking off everything.\"I'm okay...\"Your back to them, hiding your true feelings from them. Before Robin could even say something, fire devours you and you vanish. Later that same night, Robin followed Terra into the city. Being as stealthy as he could, scaling the roof tops while she walked down below. When she makes it known she knew he was following her, due to the seismic vibration of his footsteps. \"It's not like I can't sense the vibrations of someone following me.\"Terra said rather annoyed.\"Even if they are on the roof.\" With his cover blown, Damian drops his suspicions and offers his own help.\"I know what's like not to fit in with the group. What's wrong?\" \"Besides from monkey making me melt down.\"She begins to list. While while talking up on him.\"Or Raven staring all the time. Nightwing acting like a den mother. Jaime and his freak-o bug. Miss smiles a lot. And you my new stalker. Wait, let's not forget, you're freaky melancholy, psycho girlfriend. Huh. Nothing I guess.\" \"If you need to talk, let us help you.\" \"Such an observant and considerate boy.\"Slade mocks Robin, stepping out of the shadows.\"You would think he truly cares.\" Silence and solitude was what you needed. Even in the late night, watering your plants delicately. Richie not to far, roosting upon a branch. Your mind was somewhat settle besides the voices of others. They weren't nearly as loud and prominent as...bits and remnants of Terra's horrible nightmare. They still lingered. Feeling them seeping inside, yourself craving for such a delectable meal. It sicken and disgust you. You nearly broke the handle to your water can. Calming yourself, you go to the next couple of plants watering them. Focusing your mind on tending to its needs. You didn't notice someone had come in. Until you felt their hand on your shoulder, they nearly startled you. \"Sorry, didn't mean to scare you.\"Dick apologizes. \"It's alright.\"You tell him and go back to watering. Moving onto the next one. It remained quiet between you and him. \"So...\"He starts.\"Do you want to...do you want..\" \"I'm fine.\"You tell him, rather cold and quick.\"I mean,\"Softening your tone.\"I'm okay. Sorry, didn't mean to cause such a panic. Thoust mind was rattled. I mean my mind was jumbled.\" \"I kind of figured that out. That's not what I cam to talk with you about. I wan-\" \"Damian!\"You gasp sharply, dropping your water can. It woke woke Richie. You stood there shaking frozen and petrified. Something wasn't right, Robi-Damian...Something was wrong. It pierced you like a sharp blade in the heart. An old wound, clenching your hand over it, fall to your knees. Like a heart attack. \"Violet!\"Dick gets down to your level.\"What is it? What's wrong?\" You didn't answer, your heart felt like blood was pouring out. The pain was so real, it triggered that memory. That horrible memory. The blade thrust violently through your lungs and straight out your heart. The blade stuck out, the tip covered in your own blood. Dripping. Death behind you, taking your life. It was quick pain, but lingered with burning torment. Everything became lifeless and stopped. Your body weightless, as it was flung over the side into the dark and depths. The pain ached uncontrollably, you couldn't take it. Hunched over with Dick trying to help. He didn't know what was wrong, seeing his cousin in excruciating pain. In a cold sweat, breathing and gasping for their life. It was like you where fighting off some sort of disease or sickness. Cradled in his arms, only repeating Damian's name. The next morning, Jaime was up and ready to head to the Soup Kitchen. He just needed one more thing. You. Standing at your door he knocks. But got not response.\"Yo? Hermana, you up? You ready? We have a big day at the kitchen.\"Still not response, so he knocks again.\"Yo. Vi, come on. We have to go.\"Still nothing so he tries to get in by recognition, to be denied. Which was rather unusual.\"What in the world is going o-\" \"Violet's resting today.\"Dick approaches him.\"While Starfire and I move in everything.\" \"Oh.\"Jaime said a bit disappointed.\"We're suppose to give extra help down at the soup kitchen. Is..is everything okay?\" Dick didn't say anything for a second. He was unsure himself.\"Yeah. She just needs to rest. That's all.\" Accepting it, Jaime gets ready to leave.\"Well, alright the-\"When your door opens and you come out looking just fine. With slightly noticeable circles under your eyes. \"J-Jaime. Hey.\"You give him a smile.\"Sorry. I was just resting. Gi-Give me a second. We can go to the kitchen. I just..I just need to find...\"Your words trail off and stop for a second. \"You know. It'a alright.\"Jaime tells you looking at Dick.\"Why don't you go and rest. I'll let Traci know you're not feeling well. It's cool.\" But you insisted.\"No. I'm fine. Please.\"Pleading. Leaving Jaime in a rather awkward and uneasy. His eyes shift from Dick back to you. From look your cousin was giving him, pressuring him to make up his mind. He inhales scratching the back of his head.\"Why me...\"he sighs. Clearing his throat.\"Violet-\" \"How are you doing today?\"You kindly ask a homeless woman. By the name of Mary Blanche. Giving her a smile. She gives you a smile back of course she was missing a few teeth, but that didn't matter nor made you uncomfortable. Yes, you went with Jaime to the kitchen. He couldn't say no. Despite Dick pressuring him to, he just couldn't. He was with Traci in the kitchen helping bring out trays of food, while she severed. She looks over at you. \"Your friend, sorry I mean cousin, is really starting to become more comfortable here.\"She points out. Jaime looks over you talking to a few others, sharing a laugh. It made him smile. \"Yeah. She really is.\"He tells himself.\"Would you believe me if I told you that she is actually self consciences. You wouldn't know it.\" Traci looks back at you, rather surprised.\"Honestly, I wouldn't. Isn't she moving today?\" \"Yeah. But, her family..has that. She wanted to come and spend some time here.\" \"Why do you sound like that?\"She chuckles. He looks at her not following.\"You make it sound like you don't want her to.\" \"Oh, no I do. It's just..\"he looks over at you. Looking up in the distance, worried about something. Something was bothering you, making you uneasy. Which worried him. He watched you take out your cellphone, you'd been doing it quite frequently. Typing something, then send it. That problematic look in your eyes didn't vanish, even when you smiled and talked. Over at the new place, the new apartment. Dick and Kori where still unpacking, after making up from their little argument. Kori with her many weapons brought from the Tower, which Dick hung up on the wall. He was still going through some of her boxes, while Kori took to another important task. Violet's room. Which she delightedly and eagerly did. Putting Violet's name on the door in violet lettering. She went onto to doing the rearrangement of the furniture as well. She hadn't doing the painting of the room just yet. Still trying to figure out what color for the wall would best suit. Fluffing a few of the pillows for the bed. Nicely putting them on the already made bed. The room that was given to Violet, was one over looking the city. It allowed in a good deal of sunlight. A bright room. Kori picked it out herself. Believing this would be the best one. Though she was happy about the prospect of having the young hero living with her and Dick, she was also rather nervous. It wouldn't be leader and team member living together, like back the Tower. It would be more like...Setting the nice dark brown desk down, she goes to assemble the bookshelves, Violet like Raven had a collection of books. Some of them would be in her room, while the rest would be in the living room. Dick was taking care of that. \"Alright.\"Kori said, hosting the shelve up and beings filling it books.\"There, that's...\"She looks over her shoulder at three boxes of books still left.\"This won't be enough. I suppose I should have ordered a larger on.\"She said rather worried. \"It's a fine size.\"Dick comes in, she looks at her boyfriend.\"Well, seems like you've been rather busy.\"He said looking around.\"We might have to put up some curtains. Might have to go and buy some, Vi does like her silence and tranquility.\" \"That she does.\"Kori agrees. Making a mental note. Noticing her rising nervous, Dick couldn't help but find it rather amusing. \"Calm down, Kori.\"He tells her.\"Your about to go into a panic. I can see it. Violet's going to like what you've done.\" \"Thank you, but, this is different.\"Kori tells him.\"It is not back like how living was in the Tower. It's just the three of, like a...like a...family.\"She finally says. \"Yeah.\"He agrees with her with a nervous chuckle.\"It's exciting though. If you think about it.\" While he smiled, Kori couldn't really share in it.\"Dick...?\" \"Hmm?\" \"Do you think that, Violet...I don't know...\"She tries to find the right words. Searching for them.\"Violet might...\" Another successful day at the kitchen, you and Jaime leave waving bye to Traci and walk back to the Tower. It was quiet between the two of you, even when he bought you churro. A treat you enjoyed with him, since he would allow for the two of you to share it. You ate one half he ate the other. Though you weren't eating yours like normally would. That feeling...it came back again. You stop and look up in the distance. There was something in the wind, it was telling you something.\"Damian...Terra...\"That sharp pain in your heart came again. Clenching a hand over it. Whisper their names again. To see a flash image of Slade, nearly freaked you out. \"Whoa.\"Jaime brings you back.\"You okay?\" Shaking off the feeling nod your head.\"Y-Yes. Sorry, my mind is rather...\" \"Yeah. It's on another plane.\"He puts it together.\"I kind of figured that out. You okay? Hermana?\"The two of you continue walking.\"Because you haven't eaten your churro and by now you would have. So what's up?\" \"...It's nothing.\"You lie, refusing to say anything. He didn't stop and asked again. \"So..again what's up?\"This time he nudges you. \"Please stop.\" \"Alright, no nudging. Still though, something is bothering. You've been casting your eyes up for long periods of time. And looking at your phone, which you rarely do. Everything okay with you and Dami-\" \"Everything's fine.\"You quickly reply flatly. \"Okay. Well, you excited about moving?\" \"...Yeah. I am.\"Sounding not to thrilled. \"...\"He stops walking and halts you too by the shoulder.\"Violet, why don-\" \"I'm worried.\"You confess, though dwell into it.\"...That's all.\" \"Worried? About what?\" You kept your mouth shut.\"It's no reason. Just still feeling the effects, that's all. We should hurry back. I promised to make the cake remember.\"Glancing towards the Tower, which was still some distance away.\"Going at this pace, might take us some time. Hold on.\"Grabbing by the wrist and in an instant vanish in a pillar of fire. It took just a few seconds to make it back to the Tower. Actually inside, you release Jaime and hurry to the kitchen. There was still enough time, reading the clock. Stop of a second. Again with that feeling. Looking into the empty mixing bowl. \"Damian...\"Shut your eyes.\"Terra.\"[Chapter 44] \"What color? What color?\"You ask out loud to yourself, in the kitchen. Looking at the plain white frosting, eyes darting from each color of the specturm. You hadn't been able to figure out which color to make the frosting, nor the icing either for the cake. Which you where still baking, using some of your fire. One of the many good uses you got out of having it. Though of course you had to be extra careful not to put TOO much feeling into it. Otherwise, you'd burn down the room and burn the cake. So while you mind mentally kept the fire in control, you could focus on this more important matter. The color choice you had in mind most likely wouldn't be something Terra would like, blood red was the color you wanted to choose. With some yellow. Maybe a dark grey or a nice aquamarine would be a good one too. No. It just didn't feel right. Becoming stressed now, caused the flames to react and you nearly burnt the cake. Calming them down, when Raven entered. She looks quickly at the cake and rising flames.\"So, almost done?\"She asked walking over. \"Almost.\"You tell her still settling the flames.\"Just trying to figure out what color I should use.\" She peers at the frosting, icing and colors.\"Why not just do something simple. That's what I asked.\" \"I know. But, it also has to be special too.\"You add. With a stressful sigh.\"Colors mean something. So they have to correct. Besides that where you able to do the other stuff on your end?\" \"Yes. Everything been set up. Terra is in her room. She's been in there since she came back. I'm going to get her in a bit.\" Extinguishing your flames, the cake was now down. Raven levitates it over.\"Thanks. Now, it just needs to cool for a bi-\"You froze in fear for a second. That feeling came back again. His face flashed in your mind. And the pain came back. Raven noticed something was wrong.\"Violet? What's wrong?\" Her voice brought you back, taking in a quick deep breath, ease up.\"It's nothing.\"You say unsure yourself.\"I'm fine.\"Reaching for the two colors you finally decided to use. It became quiet with you and Raven. She watched you work on the cake, though there was really no passion and joy behind it. There was something troubling your mind. She didn't need sense it, when she could see it weighing in heavily in your eyes. And the way your eyes kept glancing over at your phone. She knew what it was, you didn't have to tell her. But she was going to speak about it.\"Done.\"You tell her.\"How does it look?\"You step back to marvel at the cake, she was amazed at what she saw and approves. \"It's good. Thank you.\"She said. Looking at the time.\"I'll go and get her. Do you want to come?\"She uses her powers to put everything away for you. So you wouldn't have an excuse to not come. While also answering for you. After delivering the cake to the others who had everything set up for the surprise. Gar compliments you on doing an awesome job with the cake. Thanking you over and over again. To where Dick had to pull him away. Handing the cake off to your cousin, you go with Raven to get Terra. It was still quiet with you both on the way to Terra's room. It wasn't eerie silence. Nor uncomfortable silence. It was just silence. With each step to her room, flashes and images of angry mob caused a split headache. Still hearing their yells and bantering words. Reminding yourself to calm down. Which worked, which was good, because you and Raven both arrived at Terra's door. She knocks, while you pull yourself together. In just a few seconds Terra opens up, surprised to see you both. Raven informs her about everyone wanting to meet with her, while also offering to teach her some meditation techniques. To which Terra said she would consider. \"What?\"She demands looking at you staring. Realizing this, you apologize. \"Sorry.\"You come back to your senses.\"I was just in a daze.\" \"Umm...okay..\"Terra scoffs, quickly shooting you a suspicious glare. Before looking back at Raven.\"I'll be there. Just give me a few minutes.\" \"Alright.\"Raven leaves.\"Let's go.\"She tells you. Walking back down the hall to the others, you just couldn't shake it. Why did...why did you see Slade? See him more clearly in her presence? You stop for a second and try to make sense of it. \"Violet. We have to hurry up.\"Raven tells you, turning around. Noticing you had stopped. The conflicted look you had, made her think it was something different. Like any sister she goes over to see and offer you words of comfort.\"Violet, if you don't want to move. Then you should tell them. If you're worried about leaving, don't can still have our sessions. I know you're strong enough to control yourself.\"You look at her confused, which she misread for something else.\"And...if it's about how Damian feels...\"She pauses.\"You'd be surprise. Now come on, let's go.\" Just like Terra said, in a few minutes she came as Raven said. Walking into the dark room, her guard down while still staying on her toes. Ready should anything arise, but she wasn't ready for what came when the lights turned on. \"SURPRISE!\"Everyone cheers. Shocking Terra who nearly attacked everyone.\"Shit! You guys scared me.\"She withdraws her attack. \"We can see that.\"Kori said. Taking a quick look at everything, Dick holding the cake, Jaime and Kori holding up a sign reading: \"Happy One Year Anniversary, Tara!\", Raven, Gar and yourself holding gifts. Terra wasn't sure what to make of it.\"Are those for me?\"She asked. Which Gar eagerly answered.\"Yes they are. For your one year anniversary as a member of the Titans. It was Raven's idea.\" Lost for words and touched. \"I-No one's every done anything like this for me before.\"Terra emotional begins to tear up.\"Th-Thanks. Thanks a lot.\" \"Dry those tears and let's get this party started Mama!\"Gar tells her, taking out his phone and snaps a selfie. And just as he said, the party did get started. Music played. Laughter and smiles exchanged, among everyone. Gar and yourself taking selfies and pictures of it all. Though Gar did it the most. One of everyone together, him and Jaime eating with Terra in the back laughing, Terra and you singing the song, Raven eating cake too, you playfully caking Jaime and laughing about it. Everyone dancing, though you stood back watching them. Dancing wasn't something you really enjoyed doing, even if you had a few ballet lessons. You never really got into it really, that didn't stop someone from noticing. \"Come on.\"Terra grabs and pulls you with her onto the floor with the others. But, you decline. \"No. It's fine. I don't mind watching.\"You tell her looking down with a nervous look.\"I umm...\"She wasn't going to take no for an answer and forces you anyway. \"Come on!\"She pulls you with her.\"What's the worst that can happen? Right?\"She chuckles.\"Just follow my lead.\" Hesitant for a second, give in and take her in trust. Following her lead, having a good time. Terra cheering for you, you had to admit it was rather enjoyable. Stopping when you caught a glimpse of Dick and Kori in an intimate embrace dancing. \"Damian...\"You whisper. \"Beast Boy's sending you pictures of Terra's party.\"Slade tells Damian who was trapped in the wall. Courtesy of Terra. Walking over to the teen, looking through his phone.\"It's a shame you're missing it.\" \"You should go. Playing teenagers is about your speed.\"Damian baits him. Which Slade doesn't fall for.\"I'm not going to let you bait me kid. Oh what the hell.\"Back slapping Robin across the face. Unfazed, Damian spits out some blood and mocks Slade.\"Big man. Why don't you let out of here so I can defend myself properly. Unless you're afraid?\" \"Really? You're dumb in hoping, I'll act like the biggest stooge in a B rated movie?\" \"You're outfit said give it a shot.\"Robin smirks. Hitting a nerve in Slade. Who beats him some more. \"Grandson of the Demon's Head you are not! You're an entitled brat. I rose from nothing, while you had everything handed to you. You cost me my rightful place.\" \"And the family you betrayed.\" \"They turned on me! By choosing you! You took my old family, Damian. So I'll take your new one.\"Slade promises, going through the teen's phone. Stopping with a dark, cruel smile.\"And I know just who to start with.\"He shows Robin, getting a reaction from him.\"Honestly, I was rather surprise to find out she actually lived. It will be a pleasure to kill her again. Well, I won't this time.\" \"Don't you touch her.\"Robin scowls. Slade paid him no mind swiping through the rest of the pictures. \"You know, I never actually figured out what the two of you are. But, now I know.\"He still swiped through, stopping.\"Well, it look at this, a video.\"He presses play, showing Robin. It was a video Gar had sent him from Terra's party. He was going around talking to everyone, spotting you by the cake. Cutting some of it and setting it to the side. Gar asking what you where doing, which you respond that you where saving it for Damian. Gar then jokes telling you to say hi as he was making the video for just that. You suddenly become bashfully and flustered. But say hi, with a big grin, waving to the camera. While telling Damian to be safe. It ends with Terra pouncing on you. \"Touching.\"Slade mocks.\"That has to be my favorite one.\" Back at the party, you had excused yourself no longer in the party mood. That feeling you just couldn't shake, no matter how much you wanted too. Your mind already screaming at you, made it worse. To clear it, you needed peace and headed to your garden. It helped just a bit, but not enough. Damian still lingered heavily, sensing him in pain. But from what? Looking at your cellphone, there was nothing. No responses from the texts you've sent. Though it was the norm with him not really responding, it was never this long. Even when he went out on his own. Walking along the flowers, trying to wrap your mind around it, while ignoring the voices. There was some sort of conspiracy, something rising. It was starting to make you paranoid. \"Somethings happening. What? What is it?\"You begin to talk to yourself.\"Why? What...Everyone. Huh? No don't go. What's going on?Dick. Raven. No. Hold on...Could it..No it couldn't.\" You where so focused on your words and voices, you didn't noticed when someone came in. Until they startled you and you nearly charred them.\"Whoa!\"Jaime in his Blue Beetle attire with his shield up.\"Hermana, it's just me. I came to get you, we've got a mission. You...you okay?\" Calming down, realizing who it was.\"Yes. Yes, I'm okay.\"Blue looks at you weary and cautious. He gets ready to retract what he said, but your flames engulf you changing you into your hero attire.\"Alright then. Let's go.\" Blue filled you in about the mission, it was about some scientist that was thought to have been dead. But wasn't, his lab still operational and being funded by Blood himself. Able to pinpoint and the find lab, the team heads there to deal with them. Arriving to a warehouse, Starfire taking the lead. Telling everyone to be careful with their spacing upon entering. Finding the scientist at his computer get the last bit of information, before deleting the files. Starfire shots a blast, startling and frighting him.\"Step away from the computer and you won't get hurt.\" Realizing and seeing he was compromised, the scientist quickly alerts his drones who come out in a multitude of numbers at the team. Giving the man the cover he needed,while making the computers self-destruct. You manage to avoid being hit by the drones. Sending out an emission of fire, disintegrating them into nothing but a melted sludge. Noticing the scientist making a run for it, you where about to go after him, Raven beats you to it. So you cover and take out a few more drones. \"Don't touch my sister!\"You growl, blocking them with a wall of fire. Slowly descend down, clenching your fist, baring your fangs with a wicked smirk and attack ruthlessly. Destroying the rest of the drones before you, ended your fight with them. The others finished too, you go and meet with them outside. Dropping down by Terra, whom you startled by your eerie look now and what you said. \"Thou metal and machine did not quench my thirst.\"You hiss, creeping her out, until you came back. Looking around finding her staring at you.\"What?\" \"Nothing.\"She said, looking away. Hearing the sound of someone approaching moved your attention to Raven who had scientist under her control. \"What do you want ask him first?\"She said. Before anyone could, one of the drones reactivated, shoots and kills him. Blue spots it and fires back destroying it.\"Bad luck for him. At least it wasn't one of us.\" \"Yes. Bad luck.\"Starfire agrees, noticing something on the ground. Picking it up.\"That we couldn't speak to him about these.\"Everyone crowds around to see what she had; pictures. Not just any pictures, it was pictures of everyone. \"Where did he get these?\"You said shocked. \"Maybe he was a fan?\"Beast Boy assumes. You look at him then back to the pictures. Something definitely wasn't right. There was something wrong. If the mission wasn't bad enough, the party mood was now dead and dull. After finding out that scientist had been watching everyone, left the team unsettled and tired. \"Nothing like speed laser drones to take you out of the party mood.\"Raven sarcastically said. Pushing a plate of cake away. \"I'm beat.\"Jaime up against the wall picking at the cake.\"Tomorrow I have to make lunch at the center.\" They both decide to call it a night. While Gar had more uplifting news.\"On other news, I've been invited to be on Kevin Smith's podcast. At Metro-Con tomorrow.\" \"...\"You had nothing to say and decide to leave too, heading to your garden. When Nightwing stops you, Raven and Jaime from leaving. \"Hold up.\"He said.\"Starfire has something to say.\" Giving her the floor.\"With what we discovered tonight. We need to be extra vigilant. And not take any chances.\" \"Are you kidding me! It's Kevin Smith!\"Gar protest. \"I didn't say don't have plans. But keep your eyes and com-link open at all times.\"She orders.\"I have a feeling whatever Blood is planning is just a prelude.\" With that everyone was dismissed. Though Nightwing reminds you about heading home.\"Hey, Violet we're going to wrap it up in just a bit. After Starfire and I go over some more things. Then we're heading home. Okay?\" \"Okay. Let me just finish watering my plants.\"You tell him hurrying off. Just as you told Nightwing, you went to water your plants. As you watered them, you didn't notice someone had come in, until Richie did.\"Hm? Oh, Terra. I didn't hear you come in.\"You welcome her.\"Do you want to help me water?\"Looking at the other water pail. \"Sure.\"She agrees and picks it up. Pouring the water rather heavily. \"Not too much.\"You tell her.\"Gently. Gently. See?\"Showing her. She does her best to try and follow you.\"This is a lot difficult, then I thought. It's really...frustrating.\" You couldn't help but find it funny and lightly chuckle.\"I never realized. Since I've been doing this for so long. I guess it can be, but it's calming for me.\" She was still struggling and eventually gives up.\"I'm done. I'll just watch you.\"Placing the water pail down and looks around.\"Honestly, I've never actually got a full look of this place. Being here a whole year. I'll admit, it's pretty amazing. There's so much life in here.\" You stop and look up.\"Yeah. Guess there is.\"Both you kept staring up for a few more seconds. Marveling at it all.\"Terra.\" Calling to her, she looks at you. Finding you staring right at her. Your eyes seem to be looking straight into her, made her rather nervous. Ready to react should need too.\"Y-Yeah?\"She stammers a bit defensive. Become more so when you stepped to her, your eyes hadn't left. Panicked now, slowly she and carefully she steps back. You put your hand out at to her.\"Wh-What are you doing?\" With no words coming from you, freaked her out more. It was no or never, she'd have to react. Blowing everything. Your hand raises and comes down on her shoulder.\"...I'm so sorry for what you went through in your life.\" Your words shocked her, she wasn't expecting that. Stun and lost for words, she saw your eyes drop, cringe and flare up in anger. To quickly vanish.\"Life has been rather unkind to us. The both of us, to be treated for being different.\"You lament on your own past.\"Terra? Do you hate yourself?\" That question came out of nowhere. Her silence gave you the answer. You scoff with a smirk.\"I thought so.\"You speak for her.\"I'll be honest. I hate myself too. Remember when you asked me what was the difference between me and my sister? Well, I never did tell you the actually truth. Which is, unlike her she has a soul. Can a make a soul. I don't have neither of those. Which is why, why I'm always craving, because I lack what was stolen from me. Actually...\"You look at your hands and form a small flame. Your eyes watch the dark flames closely.\"I never had one to begin with.\" \"But, you're so nice.\"Terra finally speaks. You give her a mocking chuckle.\"That's kind of you. But,\"Your voice drops and tears form.\"I know. All the horrible things I've done. Because of what I am. Sometimes, I wonder if this niceness is nothing but a false mask I wear so I do not have to deal with the pain tearing me up inside. Like you with with your cold and distant front. If anyone is nice and kind. It's really you.\"You express, surprising her. \"W-Why would you say that?\"She asked surprised. Trying hard to hold in her tears. \"Because,\"You begin to tear up. Turning to her with a small smile.\"You're the very first person I can call...my kinder. My kinder spirit. You helped me see, despite it all, my life, I can get through it. So thank you.\"You hug her.\"Thank you. I'm glad to call you my best friend.\" Terra stood there stun and conflicted. She didn't hug you back, your sincere words weighed on her. Her mind unable to process this, how you could call such, after all she's said to you. And what was soon to come. \"There.\"You pull away, relieved from what you said.\"I finally got to tell you. Terra, since I won't be living here anymore, I trust you to watch over my plants. I think you might like it here.\"Looking at your plants.\"To be honest, I still don't want to move. It worries and scares me...because well...\"You look up at your robin.\"I don't want to leave behind my sister and the others. Also, I feel...Every time...There's always separation...\"You trail off, mumbling under your breathe. To quickly come back what you where talking about.\"Terra, after I settle in, why don't we have a sleepover? I know it is rather juvenile, but, I've never had one.\"You admit to her bashfully.\"So...it would be great if we could. You, me and Raven. Maybe everyone.\" You look at her awaiting her answer. Hoping she would agree.\"...Yeah.\"She agrees. Bringing your smile back.\"Awesome. I can't wait.\"[Chapter 45] Damian. He was held captive in a wall of earth. Unresponsive and unconscious. Something wasn't right, what was wrong? Where was he? How did this happen? Damian. \"Damian!\"You scream out to him.\"Damian! Where are you!? Damian!\" Your eyes shoot open, it was only a dream. If you could call it such. Because it felt and seemed so real, Damian. Your mind wonders to him, where was he? What happened? It's been some time since anyone has heard from him, you hadn't been able to sense him. Yet this strange dream, about him was telling you something. You just didn't know what. Seeing him like, in a manner of speaking chained up. Restrained, the bruises and marks told you he'd been beaten during his capture. Question was who captured him? And why? Sulking in your worry and seeking answers, you didn't hear the door open to your room. Your back turned to whomever it was at there, not trying be rude, though they slightly took it as such. Clearing their throat get your attention. You turn around under your covers to the person. Kori. She stood there greeting you with a warm and bright smile. You could tell she was adding a lot, really trying to make an impression. It was actually rather uncomfortable. You just stare at her blankly, your mind still upon Damian and this strange feeling. Caused her misread your look and her smile to slightly drop. It took you a second to realize this.\"Sorry.\"You both apologize to each other. \"I'm sorry, if I woke you.\"She speaks first.\"If you're still sleeping that's fine. I was wondering if you'd be hungry?\" Slowly you sit up and stretch. It had been a long time since you actually slept in a bed like this and to be greeted in the morning like she was doing. Most important by another female. Glancing at the clock you read it the time. It was past 10:30 nearly going on 11. Wow, you slept in pretty late. It actually felt nice, instead of being called to go to training or hearing early morning noises. \"Where you comfortable in your pj's?\"Kori asked worried and waiting for your answer. You look down, nearly forgotten where actually wearing them. Dressed in matching light blue tank top and shorts with purple poke a dots on them. She had picked them out for you along with pretty much everything thing else in your room. From what you gathered and what Dick told you as well Kori. Doing her best to make it to your liking, while incorporating new things. The room was a okay mix of calming and vibrating colors. Nothing fancy or over the top. Nor anything pink, thank goodness. Last night was the very time you actually slept in here. Your own room, it felt strange. Nearly forgetting about Kori who was still waiting for your answer. \"Yes. Thank you.\"You tell her. Casting your eyes out the window, that over looked the city. Damian came back to your mind. Standing and walking over to the window, just stare out into the distance. It was unsettling, knowing something wasn't right. Which Kori mistook, again. Which you picked up on and quickly turn around to her.\"I'm not hungry right now,\"Her eyes drop.\"But a nice bowl of cereal would be nice before I head out.\" Her eyes light back up.\"Yes. Alright. I'll let you get dress and have it set up for you.\"She closes the door with a happy smile. You manage to keep yours up until you couldn't anymore. Turning back overlooking the city.\"What's going...?\" Just as Kori said, she had the cereal set up. Two bowls out and one box of cereal, a carton of milk and two spoons. At the breakfast bar, ready. She was jest waiting on you. Nervously waiting. Back at the Tower she was never like this with you, she knew why she was. Desperate to make a good impression with you and for you to feel welcomed into this new and interesting family. Knowing that moving into Dick's life, included you as well. Feeling herself at crossroads, either be like a mother or not. Dick had assured her many times for to relax and not to worry, you'd be alright. It wasn't helping. Eagerly waiting for you, looking at the door to your room. It still remained closed, her mind began to wonder what was taking so long. Did you not want to come? Was pushing too much? Oh God! She panics inside, about to go and check up on you when you come out. Dressed in none of the clothes she had for added to your closet. Instead it was one of your normal clothing. She was a bit disappointed, but quickly hides it and greets you yet again. \"Good morning or late morning. I have the cereal ready.\"She presents to you, taking a seat on one the stools.\"Come, why don't we eat together.\" Agreeing you go over and sit on the stool next to her. The bowl was already filled, so you pour the milk, pick up the spoon and eat. It stale between the two of you, your mind still on that thought. So silence was the only thing right now. Making Kori feel rather tense. Her mind thinking what to do, what to say. \"Did you like you bed?\"She asked. Looking up from your bowl at her, a rather ice breaker question. But you answer. Swallowing first of course.\"Yes. It was comfortable.\"And go right back to your deep thought, looking down at the cereal. \"That's good. That's good. Oh, Dick went out earlier before you woke up.\"She tells you.\"Violet? Are you alright?\"She notices. \"...I'm alright. It's nothing.\"You tell her, while finishing up your milk.\"I'm going to just be in my-\"Putting your bowl away, turning around finding her standing kind of blocking your path.\"Room.\" Looking down at you with biggest worry and concern eyes.\"If anything is bother you, please...feel free to tell me. Alright?\" Your eyes shift uncomfortably, but you give her sort of a smile.\"Yes. Of course. But, nothing's bothering me. Not that I can think of...at the moment. Thank you for my late breakfast.\" With that you go back to your room, feeling Kori's eyes watching you. It didn't even feel like it stopped when you shut the door. Once in your room, away from the eager and pleasing eyes of the princess. Take your meditation position in the center of the room. Normally this was Raven's thing, but you would adapt if needed. And right with these strange vibes and feelings. You needed it. Blocking out the screaming spirits and voices in your mind, search for something peaceful. It was small, but enough. Grabbing hold of it, whisper to yourself.\"...Damian...\"Opening your glowing eyes, see nothing but different wavelengths of a variety of colors. Each one unique to a person. But, these weren't the good ones, no. They where dark and bleak. Everyone's darkest emotions. Some twisted others dark. Searching through them for a certain one, you could sense it. It was always imprinted in you, since day one. There. Right there, reaching out for it when you suddenly stop. Crying, you hear crying. It distracted you for a few seconds. Turning towards it, you see her. Terra again, her past. Why where you seeing it again? This impulse emitted from it. Like some sort of warning. Something impending. But, you did not bother with it or you didn't have a chance. The ringing of your phone broke your trance and brought you back. Getting up, noticing Richie acting rather sporadic.\"Calm yourself, Richie.\"You tell him soothingly. Reaching for your phone, finding someone had texted you. It was rather a surprise, getting one for them. Still, it didn't stop you from reading it. Taking a few seconds reading the words, end your search and go to your closet to change. Outside your room, Kori was doing two things. One talking with Dick on the phone about what they had discovered and second making a mess in the kitchen, while trying to cook. If she could call it that or you could. Smelling the burning and overflamed cooking she had done. The kitchen looked rather bad. It was both humorous and shocking. You didn't really know what to make of it. Just standing there looking at it, debating if you should help her. Or interrupt her, to let her know you would be leaving. But, she noticed you. \"Oh. Violet, I didn't see you.\"She tells you trying not to panic nor freak out over what she was doing. \"Hey Vi.\"Dick on the speaker. Still stun at the scene before you didn't respond.\"Oh.\"Kori notices you looking at the mess behind her.\"...I have it.\"She tells you, just as lip pops off from the pressure. Which she ignores.\"A-Are you going out?\" You just nod. Before responding.\"Y-Yes. I'm meeting someone.\" \"Meeting someone?\"Dick said rather suspicious, though you could tell it was playful and teasing.\"Let me guess, their brooding and smart mouth?\" \"Dick leave her alone.\"Kori tells him, shaking her head.\"That's fine, just remember to leave your com-link on. Okay?\" Giving her a nod, you leave wrapping your scarf around you and arm bands all the way up to under your shoulders. Tackle being around others, quickly you hurry and weave in and out others. Carefully avoiding them, until you found an isolated and hidden alley. Looking around quickly, manifest your wings and take off. Luckily no one saw you. The second you shot up, you where with slightly unshakable feeling. Raven. Something wasn't right. It came as quick as it left, something was wrong. Landing on top of a building, looking the direction of the tower. Was she alright? Was she okay? Trying to sense it again, finding nothing. Maybe it had something to do with Trigon. It's happen a few times. Coming to that conclusion, you turn away and fly to meet at the message again. Unaware a scope pointed right at you. \"Gotcha.\"Pulling the trigger and with perfect aim. Hits their mark. Something sharp priced you in the neck. Slapping it, you feel something and pull it out. It was a small syringe, with some sort of strange liquid in it. Whatever it was effected you. Suddenly you just drop from the sky, crashing down. The substance, you could feel it taking effect in you. Your muscles became stiff and everything seem to feel like it was shutting down. Barely able to crawl, vision blurry and things incoherent. That you didn't notice until it was too late, another person standing over you with their rifle. They place a heavy foot upon your back, stopping you from moving. Like a bug beneath their boot. Tempted to end it, pointing the barrel of their rifle right at your temple. Restrain themselves. \"...Ah, what fun would that be.\"They reach out with their bare hand and wrap it around your throat. Slowly squeezing breath out of you. Watching you absorb their negative emotions in you. Just like before you, all those years ago. Watching as the dark veins throb painfully and you skin turning a dark gray.\"Love is a fool.\"They mock you. Watching you slip under. You become unconscious, though mutter just before it all blacked out.\"Deathstroke...\"[Chapter 46] Your body felt heavy, but it was moving. Someone or something held you. Things where rather incoherent and disoriented, you couldn't fight back. As you felt your body hosted up and restrained. The voices you could hear them more than ever. Clawing and screaming at you. It was unbearable, it made you mad, no drove you insane. Made you scream and lash around. To find you could not move. You try to block them out but nothing worked. You begin to panic from the torment swarming inside you. You try to look for that little light, but it was covered, no blocked by the vengeful inhabitants of your mind. All waiting to take their desired revenge, seeing it in their eyes. With nothing to defending yourself they exact it. Outside your mind, the others just like you strapped to a machine which inhibited their powers. Raven was unconscious. Robin knocked out cold. From Deathstroke beating him into such a submission. You position on the machine was right over Raven, restrained just like Beast Boy. \"Oh no! Guys, Sinner's acting mental again!\"Beast Boy panics, watching you thrashing around and screaming. The glass tube over you barely blocked out your screams. \"Everyone! Everyone, where are you?! Jaime!? Dick!?\"They hear you screaming for them. Your black eyes searching frantically for them. Unaware they where right there.\"Anyone!? Please!\" \"Sinner! Vi! Violet! Focus, focus on my voice!\"Gar does his best to reach you. To get you to return. But it seem in vain. \"You're tormenting her!\"Starfire sneers at Deathstroke who just gives a casual glance at you and shrugs his shoulders. \"I'm pretty sure she already was.\"He retorts back.\"If you ask me, she was already loony.\" Angering Blue who threatens the assassin.\"Once I get out, I'm going to break you into little bits.\" \"It's good to have goals ese.\"\"Me, I'm having waffles after your dead. By the way can I introduce you to my assistant. I think you've meet.\" Terra steps out from the shadows, her appearance changed. Sporting a dark and malice look. Black lipstick and the sides of her hair shaved off. Smirking at everyone.\"Hey team. How's things?\" Everyone was shocked and surprised. But not as much as Beast Boy.\"Terra?! What did he do to you?\" \"Nothing and I've asked a bunch of times.\"She looks over \"Terra was a key part of my plan. A true double agent.\" \"No.\"Starfire refuses to believe his words.\"That can't be true.\" But Terra proves it all to be just as Deathstroke said.\"What can I tell you Goldielocks, you win some you lose some.\" \"We took you in. Helped you.\"Blue. \"Yeah. Thanks. Now you gonna die.\"She said cold and ruthless. With nothing else to say she turns and leaves. \"T..Terra..\"Makes her stop, the others look up. One of your eyes seem normal and clear. It looked right at her, demanding some sort of understanding while struggling to remain conscience.\"Te...Terra...\"Your struggle with her name and the hurt of her betrayal. She kept her back to you out of defiance. \"Hey.\"She turns her head 3/4 around and looks directly at you.\"What's the worst that can happen? Right?\"With a smug smirk, to quickly fall.\"You're pathetic. Guess you got used again. To die.\" You couldn't believe what she just said. How cruel she looked, no concern in her eyes nor remorse. This shock was enough for you to lose your focus and you slip right back to being consumed by the endless torment. Going back to your screaming and thrashing around. Helplessly calling out for someone, anyone. Crying in pain for the pain you where enduring and what was inflicted upon you. Begging for it to stop like a whimpering pup. The strain and stress of it was so great, you gave yourself a seizure from the convulsions. To feel yourself suddenly become weak, it felt like someone was siphoning your very essence from you. The voices slowly began to fade away. Screaming in pain from it. It would be consider a good thing if you weren't fading away too. Your mind racing on what was going on and still pleading for someone to come. Calling for them in your mind, while thinking about Terra and her betrayal. Uttering her name over and over in your mind as you fade away. So, this was how you would be going out. It made sense, to fade back into nothingness. Being born into it after all, at least those you have wronged and hurt will be free and your soul will finally get its deserved punishment. Complete damnation. Accepting it with a grace, Death's arms open wide to embrace, folds them refusing you. It didn't make sense, you where to be Death's. You where to have your damnation. Why was Death refusing? The restraints on you became undone, the voices come back and you come back. It took you a couple of seconds to get yourself together and assess what was going on around you. People screaming and fleeing. No cult members. You and the others free and Terra was out. Seeing her you flare up with rage, but that wasn't the biggest thing. Hearing a roar and the ground shaking. It wasn't from Terra. Standing up still on the mechanic find Brother Blood, in a chimera for of everyone's powers. Surprised by this, you quickly free yourself and jump down to join the others. Growling and hissing at this mad man for what he had done, there was one who was more important. And he was trying to get away, feeling the others had this go to deliver a long deserve payback. Spread your wings and take off. Locking onto his signature emotion, locate him. Robin and Nightwing engaging Deathstroke for their own personal payback. While his attention on the two heroes, gave you the chance you needed. Diving down to deliver your attack. When he turns around just in time and grabs you by the wrist. Surprising you. \"Nice try, doll.\"He yanks you forward giving you a few hard jabs in the gut, followed by a powerful kick. Sending you back, your body skipped and skid on the ground like a meaningless rock. No pebble.\"I told you not to touch her!\"Robin charges at him. Deathstroke manages to dodge his attack along with Nightwing's.\"Not my fault, your girlfriend is still weak.\"He blocks Robin's rage fulled slash.\"You're grandfather would be disappointed. Having someone like her.\"He grabs the boy and punches him the stomach before throwing him. Robin flips, lands and charges the man. Nightwing comes from the other side. Both of them with matching anger against the assassin. It was hard to tell which one was more focused on their revenge the other. It was clear to Deathstroke he hit a nerve in them. By mocking Violet. So he kept it up, it took away from their focus. \"I think this time, I'll shoot her through the heart.\"He taunts. Taking out his gun.\"Shot through the heart. Right?\" \"Grrrrrr...I've had just about enough of your mouth!\"Robin sneers at, gripping the hilt of his katana. Swipes upward, missing the man who evades it. Realizing he was small open window, Deathstroke quickly puts up a defense just as Nightwing lands his hit. \"Why does it matter to you? She' not even related to you or anything.\"He taunts the young man.\"Heard she killed her mother. With bare hands. I can see now what she's called Sinner. Hmm...What's it like having a ticking bomb around?\" Seeing his ensnaring was slightly working on the two, Deathstroke kept it up. Blocking them both and pushing them back. He quickly draws his gun pointing it in the direction he threw you and fires a couple of rounds. Stunning Nightwing and Robin.\"Opps, finger slipped.\"He said. Turning the gun on them, dropping it from the rising temperature.\"What the-?!\"He turns around to see rising like an uncontrollable fire that blazed on and on. You. Glaring hard at him. With merciless and cruel intent eyes. That remained eerily calm. Contrast to your fire that welled around you, screams of the souls mixed in sounding like multiple Banshees. Your markings glowing, your twisted into more of a demonic one. And extra set of eyes appeared above your normal ones. Your hair whipping around, like fire. Baring your fangs at him. \"...\"You hold out a hand and manifest a demonic flamed sword and hurl it right at him. He narrowly misses the attack. Astounded. You weren't finish, recalling and replaying in your mind what he did to you. But, that wasn't what filled you rage. There was another reason, what he did to your friends and family was one, but there was another. Manifesting another one, igniting it even more. The blade grew from the energy you fed it. This time you slam into the ground, splitting it open, a wall of Hell's flames arise like a fiery wall. With a command of your hand turns into a wave and attacks Deathstroke. Who manages to just in time to save himself, by taking cover behind some rubble. That wouldn't stop you, manifesting two more blades, attack him head on. Bring the blades down, he blocks them with his twin katanas just in time. There was power in this strike, he could feel it and tell. Pushing you back, you flip back and land. And charge him again with Nightwing and Robin. All three of you coming at different sides, neither of you ran into the other. Everything was fluid in attacking him. Dropping the blades switch to melee combat. Incorporating it with your flames. \"Well, seems like someone isn't as week as I thought.\"He kind of praises you, though it sounded like mocking. You didn't care, your focus was on him. With each attack, you thought of his blade plunging your heart. Ending your life. Ending everything, which in an ironic way you actually where thankful for. Still, you still hated it. Unleashing your calming rage upon him. You'd have your justice one way or another. Kicked back by him, you get up. He was still standing showing very little sign of being fatigued and neither did you. Keeping up with Robin and Nightwing, all fear vanished from you against Deathstroke. With a running start, jump and deliver a flying kick. Which evades, you weren't done and the second your foot lands twist around with a spinning heel kick. This time you actually land. \"That all you got?\"He mocks you with a belittling chuckle.\"I'd honestly think you'd would have improved by now. What-\"He felt the ground rumbling under him, he moves back just as black flames erupt. Keeping his footing sharp, moves again just as another one erupts. Hearing the screeching and tormenting screams from each one. He looks at you standing there commanding each eruption. Your eyes locked dead on him, while the fires just sporadically sprouted. Nightwing and Robin stop their attack, after almost nearly being singed from one of the geysers. Deathstroke on the evasion for his life. Staying light on his toes and his eyes sharp. He was able to figure out the pattern and movement. Realizing he had, you switch it up and mentally command the fires to stop and take form into large spheres and launch them at him. They explode upon impact. The man could only evade your attacks, that rain down on him. Where ever he moved, the incoming projectiles changed course and went after him. \"Well, someone seems to have a temper.\"He said.\"Is it that time of the month?\" \"I've had just about enough of you.\"You voice grows darker and deeper. Taking one step forward, rage rising, your appearance less human. Slowly rise off the ground and begin to manifest your fire into figure. Neither Nightwing nor Robin would have ever expected you too. Nor expected to see again. It left them stun.\"Thou soul will burn in the Inferno of damnation of hell. I beseech thy as an infection upon this world. I shall enjoy the screams of your pain.\" \"Aren't you poetic.\"He remarks, when he wished he hadn't.\"Shit.\"Looking up with his eye, their behind you constructed in demonic flames. In their colossal form, surrounding you, from their four eyes all way to their flamed horns. Trigon. Well at least a manifestation of him, still the sight of him wasn't what anyone expected. Even if you where the one controlling it, swinging an arm at Deathstroke it comes down with great force and strength. Damaging the ground, shaking it. Causing someone to wake up and see the fight happening around them. Once their eyes locked upon Deathstroke let loose all their pent up anger against him. \"Slade!\"Terra hollers in blinding anger, jumps down and makes her way over. The assassin jumps back before being stomped on. To quickly defend himself from Nightwing and Robin's attacks. Moving again out the way before the enlarge hand slammed down. While the other one tried to scoop him up, the second he jumps back he was meet with a back hand from you. Enough force to send him crashing back. He gets up with little damage, now starting to get irritated. Stands his ground and waits for you to attack again. Jumps just as the hand comes down to smash him, runs up the flamed arm quickly, jumping to the arm that came to attack him and scales that arm. His blades drawn, jumps off and thrust them right into Trigon's chest, right into you. Pushing you out. \"VIOLET!\"Nightwing and Robin scream. Trigon lets out a massive roar as he disintegrates away, his roars turned into your screams. Deathstroke over you, plunges his blades deeper and presses his foot on you, using you to break his fall. Jumps off you and takes his blades back. Looking at the blood.\"Hmm...I was expecting it to be much deeper.\"In his blade he sees Nightwing and Robin rushing him. His blade clashes with Robin's, while the other clashes with Nightwing's sticks. Holding both of them back. Both of them putting the anger into it, with a deadly look burning in their eyes. Especially Damian's. The boy was out for than blood. \"You're a dead man, Slade!\" \"Been there.\"Deathstroke retorts back and knees Robin back. Then turns his attention to Nightwing who kept coming relentlessly. Still it wasn't enough, seeing an opening, in three quick strikes beats Nightwing back.\"Is that all?\" \"No.\"You get come from behind and send a massive blast at him. He surprised he turns around to be hit by it, though instead of it burning him. It traps him in a sphere of fire as a portal of fire opens up under him. The welling and agonizing moaning of the spirits could be heard. He looks at you. There was no mercy in your eyes, no qualms or second thoughts. The souls emerge and begin to attack him, you hear him trying to resist. But it was useless, they would devour him and drag him down to the lowest pits. He'd be in a endless world of suffering. Killing him would be too easy. \"Slade!\"Terra rage shakes the ground, breaking your hold on the man.\"I'm kill you!\"You look and see her enraged. No blood-lust in her eyes for the man. More than you'd ever see in someone. Two large slabs of rock and hurls them Deathstroke. He manages to dodge them, though finding Terra like was unexpected.\"I was being studied like the rest! Wasn't I? You planned this right from the start!\" \"Calm down.\"He tries to reason with her.\"This is all a bit misunderstanding love.\" \"Terra. No.\"Nightwing Seeing him there, ignores his words and puts up a wall of Earth to block them.\"Terra!\"You call out and hurry to her.\"Terra!\"Fly to the opening that was still there. You'd be able to reach her.\"Terra!\" Her attention on Deathstroke, hears your pleads and cries, seals off the opening. Shutting you out, though not before hurling a boulder at you. Knocking you back. Robin and Nightwing go over to help you. \"Terra...\"You grieve.\"Terra!\"Exploding push Nightwing and Robin away and charge back to her. Sensing her own tormented pain and shattered soul and mind. Feelings tears that no doubt belonged to fall from your eye. Hurry faster to her. Her uncontrollable rage was bringing down the whole place, you managed to dodge the falling and crumbling pieces of the temple. Everyone could hear her heart wrenching screams. Dipping down, avoiding from being crushed near closer. You had to reach her, you just had too. Something inside you, screamed for you not loose her. You couldn't. Thinking of the fond memories with her, despite her snarky and brash if not rude remarks and ways. There where good times, there was a bond. You didn't want to loose that. Because if you did...it'd leave you with nothing. Nothing at all. Landing down on the ledge, look around for her.\"Terra!\"You spot her standing there all alone, with everything falling all around, tears streaming down her. Jumping down, you hurry to reach her.\"Terra! Terra! I'm right here!\" Through her it all she, hears your voice and looks up. Seeing you with your hand out stretched to her, desperate to reach her. For a brief second she saw a tinge of salvation. The light that cast behind you, made her see something different. But, she realized it was you and instead of taking your hand, she throws a slab of earth, smacking you away. The force was enough to hurl you through the air and knock the wind out of you. \"I've got you!\" Someone manages to catch your body, realizing this, you try to release yourself from their grasp. But, they wouldn't let you go and held onto you tight until they landed. You push out their arms and like Beast Boy, try to run back to Terra. To be restrained. \"Let me go! Let me go!\"You demand. But, the wouldn't and pull you with them.\"No. No! Terra! Terra!\" It was another beautiful day, so nice you opened the curtains in your room to let in all the light. Richie was fed, you where sitting at your desk reading. A new book, nothing dark a new one by recommendation. While listening to Beast Boy's podcast with Kevin Smith. It was just amazing. It brought a solemn smile to your face, closing the book get up and change. Going through your clothes stumble upon something to wear. Outside in the living room. Kori and Dick where sitting watching T.V. when they hear you come out. You go over to them both and give them both a kiss on the cheek telling them you'd be heading out. Stepping back asking Kori if you looked alright, she gives a second glance surprised seeing you in one of the outfits she bought you. A halter top, sky blue sun dress with tan wedges, white arm guards. What was more impressive was the fact your skin was more exposed and your hair up in a nice pony tail. You looked like a breath of fresh air. Brought tears to her eyes, she gets up, to be hugged by you. Thanking her. Dick watches the tender moment between you both. Breaking the hug, you give her smile and leave. Stepping outside, nervous at first remember those famous words: \"What's the worst that can happen?\" With that step out, with a big smile and hurry along. Reaching the park, spotting Jaime at the fountain. Flag him down, he spots you a big smile on his face, welcomes you with a hug. Looking at him nervously, he pats your head and leads you to meet them. His family. Scared at first, when his family's eyes land upon you. Jaime introduces you to them, their eyes just stare at you, making you uncomfortable. His mother opens her arms wide and pulls you in delighted to finally meet you, thanks you. His sister too was accepting, around your age it seem. Commenting on your hair, how she loved it and was jealous. Last was his father who comes over giving you some flowers yourself. Expressing it was nice to meet you, his mother stating Jaime always talks about you. Which made you blush embarrassed, Jaime ruffles your hair playfully, giving you a kiss on the forehead. Before the five of you spend some time together. Still listening to the podcast,you finish your time with Jaime and his family. Head to meet up with Gar, there was a place the two of you had to go. Together. You rode on his back, as he took the form of a pterodactyl, find the area. He lands down and changes back, there was still rubble here. That was okay, being careful, he takes your hand so you wouldn't fall. Making it through, come to the spot. Placing the flowers down, both of you pay your respects to, Terra. Despite everything, everything that she did. She was nothing more than a torn soul. One you could relate too. She was lost and confused. Caught up in her own hurt, she drowned in it. Unable to seek any sort of light, reminded you of yourself. So blinded by all that transpired in her life, she couldn't see what was before her, until the very end. In you heart, she'd would be truly missed. The one person on this earth, that could understand you. She truly was your best friend. You and Gar hold each other for comfort, Terra was important to you both in own way. But one thing was sure, both of you loved her and would keep her close to your hearts.[Chapter 47] This was to be the hardest mission ever, despite his calm composure. He was tensed, his mind racing a mile per minute. Over the man possibilities on which to take. What he was doing could only be done solo. He was the only one. There was no task he could not do, especially if it was a challenge given. His teammates didn't really believe he could handle this, considering the amount of times he shot it down. Refused to partake in it. Refusing to allow their taunting to get to him, which it did eventually otherwise he wouldn't be here right now. Eyes straight and focus. New surroundings, made him keep his guard up. Hands still and resting. They weren't needed not now, who knows when they would be. Itching to fidget and move, kept it in. His impatience screaming inside for this stillness. What was only seconds felt like hours. The sound of mere ticking set him on edge. Made him tensed. Hearing Gar's laugh and ridiculing voice echo through his mind, aggravated him to no end. But, the thought defeated look upon his green comrade's face would be worth. With him being the the victorious one. Seeing it in Gar's eyes before leaving on this...solo mission. Solo mission that was taking far longer than he had anticipated. It should have started by now, telling the time by taking a quick glance outside. Yes, it should have started all ready. Things should have gotten on its way, but, it hadn't. Time was ticking away, suspense circled around him. Becoming antsy now. His eyes quickly dart to the side to come back and look straight ahead. This, this shouldn't be anything new. He's faced them before, many times. Face to face. But, for some reason it felt and seem different. Was the it way their eyes glared back? Their arms firmly folded across their slightly puffed up chest? The flare of their nostrils slowly rising and falling. The dead lock in their eyes? The deep scowl they had? Warning no threatening him. Eyes that locked on like a heat seeking missile? Was it that? There was no way of telling. He wasn't sure. Normally able to read body language rather easy, well at least them. This time, there nothing but stone before him. They weren't going to allow him read more than was given non-verbally. Time just seem at a stand still now. He had to be careful, very careful otherwise..any sort of slip up would most likely be the end. An end his...would it be right to consider them an advisory? Maybe now, just for the time being, would make sure to put to an end themselves. Despite all that filled their minds, they kept their calm. This was nothing but mere pressure, from all the excruciating and rigorous training he endure growing up since birth. Allowed him to handle all sorts of pressures, but none like this. Still, he couldn't crack. So staring back and remaining unmovable was the best tactic. The right thing to do. No weapons to defend himself, left him open for any sort of attack. He could feel himself at their mercy now. He was in their home, meaning they had an advantage over them, knowing where everything was. Anything in here they could use, against them. Calculating in their the distance how much it would take them to obtain one of the weapons that rested behind them upon the wall. If and only if they could get past them. Their movements had to swift and precised. Quicker than them. With their size against their stature. It should rather easy. Then again, they too have training as well. More experience. Scratching the plan, forming a new in their mind, one that would surely work. Just as they're about to finish the perfect, hear the sound they'd been waiting for, for so long. It wasn't the first voice, they ignored it. \"Sorry to keep you waiting. Dick!\" No, it wasn't that voice. That scolded their adversary. It was the voice and person that followed behind them.\"Hey, Damian. Ready?\"You asked walking over. Cutting the rather intense staring contest between him and Dick.\"You look nice.\"Complimenting him. On his attire, casual wear. Black tight long sleeve, turtle neck shirt, nice pants, and dark brown shoes. His normal casual wear, when not on missions. Nothing special. He was comfortable in it. You too wore something comfortable, with Kori's help on picking it out. A short tie dye strapless dress, of teal, white and maroon. The length reached to your knees, your arm bands, with maroon flats to finish it off. Your hair pulled back into a mid pony tail. Dick gives a deep cough and grunt, aimed at Damian. The boy looks at him, Kori standing by Dick flicks him in the back of head and hushes him. Damian kept his eyes on you, though feeling Dick's eyes on the back of his head forced him to speak.\"Yes. Thank you, you..look appropriate too. Shall we go?\"Holding his hand out towards the door.\"If we want to do this. I mean, if you want to do this. The time.\"He glances at DVD player clock. Taking a quick glance yourself see the time, he was right.\"We should go. Thank you Kori.\"You give her a hug. \"You're welcome, be safe. Have a good time.\"She said hugging you tightly. Then whispers something in your ear.\"Okay?\" Understanding, you nod. The two of you share a secretive giggle.\"Okay. Okay.\"Dick comes and breaks it up.\"What about me?\" Turning to him, you jump into his arms. He gives you a squeeze.\"...\"While shooting Damian daggers. \"Okay, I have to go.\"You tell him, getting out of his arms and take a step back. Dick fully looks at you, his eyes fill with acute nostalgia and joy. Kori saw it and holds his hand. Giving it a squeeze. Grateful she was by his side, because he needed her strength right now. Watching you walk out that door, signified so much. Especially when it closed. Damian gives a quick glance at his watch, seeing the time made him speed up his steps. Not realizing you had been calling his name countless times. Until he felt a hold and jerk upon his wrist. Stop him. Knowing it was you, he still looks at you.\"Damian, slow down. There's no need to rush.\" \"We're behind, if we want to execute this properly then we must make sure that it's done accordingly.\"He instructs more so than says.\"Now, please release my wrist. And let's continue.\" Turning back around, you watch him hurry down the side walk. You let out a sigh and look up, this wasn't really what you where expecting. Doing this with him. He was so tense, nervous and flustered. But, more so nervous. It was becoming a slight headache. He was stress if not straining himself out about it. Your eyes still on him, this felt more like a mission, well actually in a way, it kind of was. Huffing, follow him. Though for a second you hesitate. When you hear him call to you.\"Coming.\"Quickly hurry to him. \"Why where you lagging?\"He questions.\"We've got to keep going.\" \"I was just...never mind.\"You refuse to say and in a dry tone.\"Let's just keep going.\" Noticing the tone in your voice changed, left him puzzled. Wondering what it was, he wasn't sure. In his mind, this was the right thing to do. You should be smiling and excited, not the opposite. What was he doing wrong? This mission shouldn't be that different than any other. At least to him. Trying to grasp it, he just couldn't figure it out. His mind trying to make logic of it, when his eyes spotted something. \"Violet!\"He calls and hurries over to you. You stop and give him your attention. He thumbs over his shoulder.\"Do you want to get..get something to eat?\" Looking behind him, at the place he blindly choose. Or at least you thought, you actually could go for a bite.\"Yes.\"You agree, giving him a smile. He seem relieved and the two of you head over there. Entering the establishment, he holds the door open allowing you to go in first. He stops for a second and looks up, feeling eyes watching. Finding no one. Hearing you call him, he goes in. Both of you wait in line, those inside, you could feel a couple of eyes staring. You do your best to remain unaffected. Focusing on the menu over the register. Reading what you wanted. When it came for you and him to order, the clerk had to do a second glance at you. Even with your friendly smile, placing your order. It was the teeth, you knew it. Feeling their eyes on it, it was strenuous to keep up the smile. But, you do anyway. Damian places his order, the clerk gave him the number. \"Where do you want to sit?\"He asked you and waits for you to choose. While your eyes scan the room, Damian shoot glares at those who stared. The second you pick a spot where to sit, he takes hold and leads the way to the spot. You had chosen a the third booth from the corner. He sat on one side, you sat on the other. Your eyes remained down cast, while you twiddled with your thumbs under the table. \"How's your pup doing?\"You lift your eyes up and ask him. He gives you a slight annoyed look.\"Fine. His training is going well, a lot smarter than Garfield. And much more intellectual.\" What was to be insult you found rather humorous and let out a small laugh.\"That's good to hear, are you going to try and teach Gar too?\" He caught on and smirks.\"I suppose. But, that would take a miracle.\" This time your laugh became louder, you had to cover your mouth. It was wrong to make brutalize Gar this way. But at least it eased the mood. Lighten it a bit, that you didn't even pay attention to the stares. Not the best type of talk, but it made things better, gave you both something to focus on. It stopped when he went to go and get the order. He came back and places yours' down first before taking his off the tray. You ordered tomato soup, with a ham and avocado grilled cheese sandwich. It was one of your favorites, it was the very first thing you ate when you had been rescued and taken to Wayne Manor. Alfred made it, it was the first taste of real food. That you had. Soup that warmed your chilled bones, gooey cheese that dripped and stretched a mile long. It was heaven. And having it again, was the best. Those fond memories brought a smile to your face. Damian looked up from his food, giving you a rather weird look as you smiled eating. Enjoying your food. Feeling his eyes on you, you open them realizing what you where doing. You blush a bit, looking away. Expecting him to say something. He does.\"You have some cheese, right there.\"He points to the left corner of his mouth.\"Here.\"He hands you a napkin, but instead reaches over and wipes it off.\"There. By the way you're smiling it seems like it's good.\" \"Here.\"You hold out a piece for him.\"Try it.\"He was hesitant, but takes some and eats it. He didn't enjoy it as much as you did, finding it rather distasteful. You laugh at the face he made. \"It's not that funny.\"He tells you, but you kept laughing. His frown turns into a smile. The more you laughed. After the meal, you both continue. This time Damian wasn't rushing, instead the two of you walked side by side. Talking and talking. Sharing a smile or smirk in Damian's case. The whole world wasn't there anymore, it was just you two. He asked how things had been since living with Dick and Kori. Which you told him, you enjoy it actually. How you have been teaching Kori how to work around the kitchen better. There was a small bit of improvement, but you told him she was better at being a warrior princess. Recalling when she had nearly burnt down the kitchen. It was worse than your flames. You laughed at the memory and a few others you told him about. Talking, ate up time. You soon found yourself where the two of you where going. The park. You read the sign: Movie Night. So this was where you both where going. Others enter the park with their blankets, low lawn chairs and whatever else to sit on. Some even had picnic baskets, the spots where beginning to fill up. Your look for a place to sit. \"We're over here.\"Damian leads you to the spot. Which was under a tree. Not too far back, still it seem rather private. The screen wasn't too far either, it actually was in good view. The sun already setting, a slight chill in the air. It was good it didn't really phase you. While you stood looking everyone here, Damian left for a second and came back with what he hid. Unfolding it and laying out a blanket to sit on. You take your seat on one side, he takes his right next you. You felt him trying to comfortable, grumbling under his breath a little. He eventually settles, once the movie starts. All attention was upon the screen. Though your eyes did eventually stray away from screen and glance around at the others. Leaning forward, looking at each person. Blocking out the movie and just focus on nothing else but them. Their smiles. Their personal enjoyment. Happiness. In their own little world of bliss, you felt a bit of jealousy. Yet at the same time a strange yearning. Desire. You weren't sure what it was, but it was something. Because Damian noticed. Feeling your body pulling back, snapped you back and you find your head upon Damian's shoulder. His arm wrapped around your shoulder, keeping you close and it surprisingly relaxed you. Allowed you to focus upon the movie instead. Still feeling eyes on him, Damian does a quick scan. Seeing no one, but he was sure of those eyes. It was starting to become an annoyance. One he was about to deal with, when felt you get more comfortable. Especially when you moved closer, he felt you hair under his nose. Investigating would have to wait. For now. Turn his attention back to the movie, which was actually good. Even if it was rather juvenile the acting in his opinion poor. Doing his best not over analyze it. Only managed to when he heard you let out a few laughs. A couple of times he'd glance down at you. With each glance, his cheeks lite up. He could feel his heart start to race unexpectedly. And the palms of his hands become gammy a bit. Being careful when he glanced down, making sure his eyes avoided any contact when you' looked up. Luckily he was quick. Pretty sure you didn't catch him. Playing it off, keeping his control. What was suppose to be one movie, turned into a double feature. Something Damian wasn't expecting, he glances at his watch. It was late and pass the time. Meaning it was time to go back.\"We have go-\" You grab his arm and hold it firmly.\"It's just one more. Let's watch it.\" Hesitant for a moment, he needed to be respectful of the time. Then again, deny you of your clear enjoyment. Suck at a crossroad, he takes the road less likely to travel and gets himself comfortable to watch the second film. Which was a horror film, nothing really scared you nor Damian. Having faced this in actual real life, decide to pack up and leave. Helping him fold the blanket, he takes hold of it along with something else and leads you out and away. Walking with him side by side, turn around to the park.\"That was fun.\"You comment.\"Movie in a Park.\" \"Yes,\"he agrees.\"It was a nice change of pace. Are you okay?\" Knowing what he was talking about, your sudden distraction back there.\"Yes.\"You force yourself to say, knowing it wasn't true. You where still affected by it. Damian could tell and stop. Turns around looking straight in the eyes. He wasn't fooled.\"...I'm sorry.\"He apologizes, which wasn't something you expected to hear from him. It left you a bit at a lost.\"This wasn't what I expected to happen or wanted to happen. This evening, during our outing.\"Looking past you in the direction of the park.\"...\" \"There's nothing to be sorry about.\"You tell him. Shrugging your shoulders.\"There isn't much you can do about it, I'm always going to feel it. No matter what, I try to do. Ignoring it, only makes it worse. Still, it makes me rather happy. It was nice to be around that kind of environment for once. So thank you.\" Damian searches your eyes to see if you actually where telling the truth and sees no lies. It's what he wanted to see. He nearly accomplished this mission. There was just one more thing. One thing he wasn't sure if he could do. Or was just nervous.\"Do hear that?\"You look away and listen. There was music being played in the distance. It was faint, but you heard it. It was a lovely melody. Cheerful and serene. Like a sunrise. Smiling softly as you listen. Damian wasn't sure what was going on, looking around he didn't see anything. Nor hear it. But, it was clear you did. \"It's coming from over there.\"You pinpoint and hurry off. Damian had no choice but to follow you. Hearing the music becoming less faint and more clearer. Making a quick right, stop for a second. To listen. There. You take off again. This game of chase, this game of finding wasn't what Damian expected this evening to go and quite frankly he wasn't to keen on it. But followed anyway. Slowly he began to hear the music too, which surprised him. He takes the same right as you, his eyes kept track of you. Even as you moved through those walking. Making the same sharp left as you did up ahead, it took you both down a long stretch between two buildings. Kind of like an alley way. Scooting between the two buildings, being careful. He comes out, grumbling just a bit, while dusting himself off. It wasn't over yet, spotting you climbing a fire escape. Which he found rather particular. Letting out a heavy sigh, follows right behind. You where one flight above him. Racing up, he reaches the top. Where the music could be fully heard and but no one was around. Except a single light shinning down in the center. There had to be speakers around here, he just knew it. But, he couldn't see them. Finding this rather suspicious, he was about to search, when he hears you gasp surprised with a joyful smile. \"...It's lovely.\"You softly say, turning around to him.\"A bit over the top, with the light.\" \"I'll say.\" He mumbles under his breath, before making his way over to you. Standing by your side, he looks over at the lights of the city and takes hold of yours. You look at him, but he kept his eyes forward.\"...\"Without a word he pulls with him and slowly begins to dance. Or what he believed to be so. Trying to match his feet with music. Fumbling a bit from his nerves, while trying to keep his collected composer. Because of it, he stiffed up. Which you realized and would be lying if you too weren't trying to keep yourself together. From your nervous taking over. You both give quick glances, then look away. Blushing faintly. Your eyes remained to the side, while his looked upward. When he accidentally stepped on your foot. He was about to quickly apologize, but you instead just begin to laugh. Which started to ease the tension. He slowly began to relax, looking down at his feet. Counting the steps in his mind, that when he felt had it down looks up and locks gazes with you. Holding it. Right that very moment his mind recapped from day one when you both met. The two of you meeting, forming what had been growing inside. Slowly but had begun to speed up over time. Everything the two of you had been through together. Both good and bad, mainly bad. Both of you making a transformation. Your's actually physically. Feeling that feeling rising more and more inside. Ready to burst out. He remember denying you, and he still did. Feeling unworthy. After everything. Everything. Stops and squeezes your hands. His green eyes began to see it clearly now. Everything, the two of you. Yes, there where not so much good memories, but his mind pushed them aside and he saw all that was good. The secretive smiles you two shared. How happy he was with you by his side. His mind racing on what to do. He knew there was distance that had begun to form, no, it wasn't distance it was something else. Hearing Jaime's words in his mind, along with Dick. Dropping subtle advice and hints. Both encouraging and helpful. Mustering up all he had, opens his mouth and speaks what he has wanted over the last few years.\"Violet, tell me...tell me something.\"His voice low, you look at him wondering what he was talking about.\"No, let me.\"He switches it. \"..Okay.\"You wait for him to. Giving him your full attention. He opens his mouth, but no words come out. He looks at you unsure, unable to say it. Which had the opposite affect he wanted, the hurt that reflected in your eyes. Being hidden by confusion and understanding. \"It's okay, Damian.\"You whisper looking away. Then give him a small smirk. One that was forced.\"...Let's just head back.\"Slip your hand out of his and start to walk away. \"You idiot!\" Damian hears a buzzing voice yell in his ear. Jump start his reaction, he grabs your wrist quickly and pulls you back.\"Dami-?!\" \"You can't leave.\"He tells between his teeth. You didn't hear him. So he says it again. This time you heard it.\"You can't go. \" It still left you confused.\"What? I'm not going anywhere. What are you talking about? I'm just starting to walk back home.\" He didn't say anything, he wasn't sure how. The words in his mind all jumbled together. Anything that he wanted to say would come out wrong, so instead he showed you. His grip on you lightens up, just as he pulls closer and closer. Closing the space between the two of you. He head slightly tilts as he leans inward towards you. His eyelids lower, closing fully once he had his lips pressed upon your own. Pressed deeply and firm. Yet, gentle and passionate. Stun for a second, it went away and you melted in. His fingers intertwine and lock with the hand he held. Holding them. The world around vanished and only you two remained. That's what it felt like. A fire ignited inside your chest, it burned with such light and radiance. Blazing in you, it felt good. It felt right. He pushes a little bit more, before taking a second break and goes back. This time pulls you in, his mind wondering if he was doing this right. Because he knew how long he'd been wanting to do it. Holding you close, he stops to breath. Actually more like heaving, his green eyes look into yours'. Both of you holding deep gazes for the other. He closes his eyes and rest his forehead softly on your's. A proud and soft smile spread upon his face. You smile back too. The two of you still focused on the other, didn't notice the rather particular green furry friend looking at the two of you. \"We have lift OFF!\"They yell with enthusiastic cheer.\"Alright!\"And scurry away and repeat again what they said.\"We've got lift off you guys!\"[Chapter 48] Honestly, you never expected to hear from him for some time. Or least whenever he choose to, considering the kind of person he was. John Constantine. He suddenly wanted you, to help you. In his own words, felt it was time to do so. Or to keep tabs on you. Which ever way he put it or you saw it. From his unique way of calling upon you. During movie night at the Tower. During the good part of it it, a message suddenly appeared from the man. And it was a message that didn't really give you much a choice. Because he told the time and date he'd be there to pick you up. The others where just as surprised by it. With no other choice accepted. Dick and Kori where both aware of it. Dick wasn't to keen on it, but, what could he do. Considering the man left a bitter taste in Dick's mouth. Kori tired to make him understand, even she wasn't too keen either. She was just trying to see the bright side to it all. You'd be staying with John for a few months to under your inherit powers a bit more. And he promised to help you deal with those extra voices the melded around in your own thoughts. Which was why you where still packing. Tucking the socks away nicely, while making sure you had the right books to read for this. Seeing that you did, shut your suitcase, to find Damian standing there at the door of your room. He nearly startled you. His puppy by his side, goes over to you. \"Oh, Damian.\"You calm yourself. Bend down and greet the little one.\" scared me.\" \"That wasn't my intentions.\"He apologizes, in his own words. While his eyes look at your suitcase. Scowling just a bit.\"...\" He wasn't keen like Dick either with you going with John. \"It's just for a few months.\"You tell him.\"Nothing more, nothing less. Besides, it'll be good for me.\"Trying to make light of it. \"Whether it's good or not, he's more than capable of sending you the necessary knowledge in which you need.\"Damian said with a refusal attitude. Coming over.\"I don't understand why he didn't bother to take you with him? Back then.\" \"Because I didn't want to go.\"You remind him.\"Remember? He was alright with that, plus not to long ago I did write to him about how I would like more knowledge in this art. With my powers.\" \"Is that not why you have Raven?\" \"Yes.\"You agree.\"But, my sister can only teach me so much. Don't get me wrong. I'm grateful for it all.\"Reaching for your luggage, but he gets it first.\"Thanks. This is might be better. I kind of want to expand my mind on this. All of this.\" Damian though understood, wasn't going to accept it. His disapproving scowl only became deeper.\"Too much knowledge can be the downfall of a person.\" You roll your eyes.\"Says the one with the advance vocabulary list. Look, I've made up my mind. I want to go with John. Not because he didn't give me a choice, but because...well. It will be nice...To you know...\"Your eyes with soft joy. Which Damian now understood. This was really important to you and what you wanted too. Who was he from stopping you.\"...\"He hands you back your suitcase. With an understanding smirk.\"Fine.\" Your eyes thank him and you kiss him on the cheek.\"Thank you. I've got to go now.\"You tell him and open the window to your room. Right as you did a house suddenly appears out thin air and standing there on the porch with in all his bastard like self. John. He smirks at you.\"Hey kiddo. Ready?\"Holding out a hand. \"Yeah.\"You climb out your window and jump onto the steps of the house. You where so glad to see him again and even more so on being able to spend time with him. \"Great. Let's go then.\"He opens the door for you and takes your suitcase. You go inside, though not before waving to Damian. John follows after you and the house disappears. The house was wide and open inside. Filled with knowledge of so much, you could feel it running all through it. It delighted you. There as more knowledge in here than in Raven's room. You weren't sure which you would want to start with first. So focus on sight seeing, you didn't notice the mainfestation spirit of the house. Until you bumped into it. Her. \"Sorry. Oh.\"Looking at her. A purple and orchid color humanoid, with red eyes and what seem to be like a transparent vial on her back. The way she stared not look, but stared like she was reading every bit of you. While peaked with a bit of curiosity and interest.\"Hello, I'm V-\" \"You are the one.\"She spoke.\"You are consumed with vial and callous not of your own choosing. Pain and suffering you hate, yet need. Your spirit is...\"She holds out a hand to your face.\"It is clean, but tainted with past sins that have damned you.\" You step back a bit weird out. She continues her analysis. Looking from you to John.\"There is a strange, yet strong resembance betw-\" \"Alright. Alright!\"John quickly hushes her. Pushing you along.\"Hey, this here is Violet Greyson. She's going to be stay with me for some time. Just a couple of months. Vi, this here is the House.\"He introduces the two of you. You look at him not following.\"The House? What do you mean?\" He scratches the back of his head as if trying to figure out the right words.\"Well, let's just say. The House wanted to experience what life is like and mainfested its own body.\" \"Oh.\"You said astonished. Looking back at The House.\"Do you have a name?\"She coxes her slightly to the side.\"A name?\"She repeats. \"Yeah. A name. Don't you have one?\"It was clear by the absent look, she didn't.\"How about I give you one then. How does Black Orchid sound? I think it's a good name.\" She pondered it for a bit and nods accepting it.\"I shall take my name.\"Quickly looking to John, then back to you.\"Welcome, Violet Greyson. To The House of Mystery. Make yourself at home. Shall I show you to your room?\" \"Naw.\"John tells her.\"I've got that part. Come on then.\"He tells you gesturing for you to follow him. Which you do, while he gives you a quick and brief tour of the place.\"This place is filled with a lot of magical artifacts, spells, and anything you can really think of. It's like an archive of mystical knowledge. Anyway, feel free to read what you want. But, tell me what you're going to attempt before doing it. I don't like cleaning up messes. Though, be careful with the artifacts. They can be a bit more tricky.\"He climbs the stairs, you tail him closely taking a gander all around you. Your eyes wide with anticipation of knowledge to absorb. \"This place would be great to inherit.\"You say to yourself. Which John chuckles at, looking over his shoulder at you. With that smug smirk. \"And what makes you think you're going to inherit this?\"He said back, knocking on the railing.\"I think you're along ways away from that. Love.\" He was playing with you, so you play too.\"I could. I mean who's to say you'd be alive for every long?\" \"Keep it up with that mouth of yours and you'll be grounded.\"He jabs back.\"Anyway, here's your room.\"Opening the door, peering in and look around. It was a nice size room. Simple and descent. It had what any room had, a bed, desk, closet, dresser, the works. Bookcase filled with some books.\"So use to a fulfillment of books. Guess this is fine too.\"You set your things down. When your suitcase suddenly opens and your clothes fly out, to put themselves away. \"This here is a magical bookcase. Just think of what you want to learn and the book will come.\"John tells you lean on it.\"You've got everything you need in here. Learn as much as you can. Why don't you start with... The Mystics of Gales. \"A brown book with purple edges appear on the shelf, he takes it throwing it to you.\"It's a rather easy read. Really. Well, you've gotten the tour and all. You're settled in, if you need anything ask the house or me. Though I might be out, don't know when but...yeah.\"He shrugs his shoulders.\"You're a big girl to be left home by yourself right?\" You laugh inside, smiling.\"Yes. I am.\"You tell him.\"I'm a big girl, John. No need to worry.\" \"Good. Oh, another thing. Be careful if you decide to leave the house. It likes to appear and reappear when it wants, unless it likes you.\"He warns you.\"Well, there's nothing else really. I'm going to head out for a bit. See ya when I get back.\"Giving you a quick wave and leaves. You hear his footsteps become further and further till it completely vanished. With your book in hand, you sit on the bed and get comfortable. Opening up to the first chapter. \" The Start of a Beginning... \"You read. Thought of doing Justice League Dark and explore the relationship between Violet and John.[Chapter 49] This was not what you expected or consider 'learning'. Well, maybe from John's perspective. In his mind, this was considered 'teaching', yeah bringing a teen to Las Vegas is a good idea. Better yet, why bring a teen who is a fly trap for all sins, to Sin City. What could someone of your age do here? Everything that considered age appropriate, was closed for the most part. Nothing but casinos and other adults related fun open. Leaving you with very options to choose from. Meaning, you had to accompany John. And his umm...'meeting.' Meaning gambling. Should Dick find out, he wouldn't be happy at all. Nor would another dark crusader and certain brooding Robin. Two out of the three already held a certain distaste for the con-man. Finding out about this, would not go over with them. And their well, personal hate for him would just go soaring through the roof. So, mum's the word as John would tell you. And also, to be a good lad and just sit there and watch. You might just learn something. And what you were learning right now was that there was a whole lot of cheating in the game. Especially if it involved magic users. That and John seem to be getting a horrible hand. Not like luck was really on his side for the man who always had a way out. Licking your thumb you turn the page to the book you had. Glancing over to the poker game being played with John, the Demons Three and another. Jason Blood. A man who looked human on the outside, but, you could sense something demonic inside. When you first meet him before a couple of months back. Finding out he had a demon he shared a body with. The demon Etrigen. Maybe that's why you felt a bit comfortable here, with all the demons in one room.\"Can't believe you actually brought a child here?\"Abnegazar said chuckling a bit surprised.\"Then again she ain't no child is she now?\" Eyeing John. Who tells him to shut it.\"Shut it. And leave her alone.\" \"Isn't that consider bad parenting?\"Gasth chaste teasingly.\"You should be ashamed of yourself.\" Rath snickers amused.\"I'll say. I'm surprised though, you...out of everyone woul-\" \"Shut your bloody trap. And spare me the lectures.\" John sneers.\"You gonna play cards? Or keep talking?\" Why again did you get dragged into this? You thought. It would have been better if you'd stay in the house. They all talked with egoistic pride, yammering over ridiculous meaning. It made it rather difficult for you read. Hearing the blabbering. Glancing up from your reading, glaring at them. Watching them take pleasure in a sinful act of wasteful spending. Clearly, all of them cheating. Carefully you watch the magic both sides tried to secretly use. Except for Jason, who was actually playing honorably. Watching the cards being shuffled, accidentally, lock eyes with Rath. Who gives you a rather creepy smile. Cackling. Your eyes flash him a sneer. He took it non-threatening. What an annoyance. Rolling your eyes, go back to your reading. Turning the page. Unable to get pass the first paragraph. Hearing them in the back again. Shutting your book in frustration and a huff. Get up and proceed out the room.\"Hey? Where do you think you're going?\"John demands. You stop at the door, dropping your shoulders.\"I'd like a quiet place to read. If that's alright.\" Noticing that look in your eyes, he said no.\"No. Stay here.\" The Demons Three, couldn't help but chuckle.\"Aw? Come, on Papa? Let the little night bird fly about, while we grown-ups enjoy our time.\"Abnegazar teases. For a good laugh.\"Seems the little one doesn't want to be here. She's at that age, most teens don't want to listen to their Pap-\" John slams his hand down, furrowing at the demon.\"I'd mind you to shut it. And you!\"He turns to you.\"You're staying.\"You groan, mumbling under your breath.\"Ah! Don't you fuss and sassy me. Sit down.\"He points back to your seat, eyes watching. As you plop and lounge on the couch, giving John a rather nasty look. He shoots you a hard one. You turn your back to him, mumbling something under your breath.\"...Whatever.\" The demons just laugh.\"Teenagers? Right?\"Rath slapping the table. Abnegazar chuckles at that taunting teasing from his kin. While shuffling the cards.\"Alright, let's go again. Shall we?\" And again they went, which John lost again.\"In what bloody plane of existence does four of a kind lose?\" He throws his cards on the table, while Abnegazar collects the pile. \"To to bad Conestine.\" Rath cackles. \"Have you gained weight?\"Gasth comments in sort of ridicule way.\"It looks good. It looks good on you.\" \"What say you let your soulmate play a few hands, Jason? He maybe might change my luck.\"John ignores the demon, turning to Jason blood the man beside him. Who shoots a cynical and annoyed look back.\"He'd definitely be less mopper than you.\" \"John Constine, the man who perfected the bad idea.\"Jason response against John's character.\"The only reason I came to dark hep of a casino is to find a relic to keep that monster locked away forever.\" \"Boys. Boys,\"Abnegazar interrupts them. Shuffling the cards telekinetically.\"You're boring me. Let's play shall we?\" And passes out a hand to everyone. Turning another page of your book, this was just boring and stupid. Shifting in your position from irritation and frustration. What was the point of him playing if there was nothing John could even play? You knew that much about poker. \"I'm beating the house. The House of Mystery.\" You hear John offer, that you jolted up from your reading shocked by this. Looking straight out the window the house and your home materialize out of thin air. Just as John said it. Was he really this stupid? \"What are you doing?!\" You protest, John didn't answer and just ignores you. \"And since I'm including everything inside, it looks like you're the one who can't call Abnegazar.\"John turns it back on the demon. \"John!\"You shout again, he still pays you no mind. Now becoming frustrated with him for his ignorance get ready to chuck your book when someone grabs your wrist. Stopping you. Jason. \"As much as anyone would like to do that more than me,\" he tells you.\"It would be best if you don't. Knock him out, he can't play.\" Understanding, you drop your arm back down and wait for it play out. The Demon's Three seeing they needed to raise, pretty much match John's payment summon forth an ancient chest filled with magical items. John looks at its contents and accepts it. The game begins. He plays his hand which caused the demons to laugh at how pathic it was. Great, you were going sleep on the streets...again. Well, not really you could always go back to Dick and Kori. Maybe Damian was right. Sighing in defeat when you hear an angry roar. Looking quickly before Jason grabs you and hides behind a pillar, Abnegazar enraged breaks the table into pieces. What just happened? A second ago they were playing cards and now this? A brawl? What did John do? To anger them? Why would you even think of that question, what didn't' he do to upset someone? Still, he was...well...you just couldn't let him be killed by those three. Wriggling out of Jason's hold go and assist. \"No! Don't!\"He tries to stop you. But to no avail.\"...That girl..\" \"Back off!\"You rush Gasth and Rath with a blast of your flames. It caught them off guard. John who was dealing with Abnegazar saw you take on the other two and couldn't help but smile with pride, for it quickly fades as he avoided being sliced in two. Gasth and Rath were knocked down a bit from you, get up with their weapons drawn. Sneer at you, their wrath for John went to you as well. You didn't care. Nor did you fear it, you were fear. Remaining calm, your eyes told a different story. The charge at you and attack. You block them quickly with a wall of fire, kin or not you didn't like them. Keeping your own urges under control from running wild, take a bit of the atmosphere around you to fuel your power, increase the wall and push back, you could smell their burning flesh and attempts to resist and withstand the pain. How you craved to hear their agonizing screams. How you wanted to feed off them. Your hunger began to grow. You needed to redirect it and quickly. Feeling that presence creep over you, hold your hands out and dark gray seal appears. \"...\"Concentrate and expel such cravings for the time being. Turning it into something else, reaching into the seal pull out a board blade. It was on the smaller side, but it would have to do the trick. The two demons break through and deliver a powerful blow to you. Striking you down and back hard into one of the wall mirrors. The pieces and shards pierced you, ignoring the pain, reabsorb it back into you. Stand up with a bleeding forehead, stand your ground. Gritting your teeth and glowing eyes. Take a strong stance, your flamed wings sprout from your back threatening. They stop for a second, looking at you in your semi-transformation. Of your fallen form. Bearing your teeth. Warning. While looking at like a meal. \"Ye dare to touch me! Feel my flaring warth! Heathens!\"Shout at them like a mad person and lunge for them. Gasth moves out the way, Rath blocks you. He was slightly struggling with you. Focused on him, you did not see Gasth come behind and throw you off. This time at the window, to be caught by someone or something. That put in the two demons. Etrigen. He sets you down and deals with the two, your head still a bit fuzzy before it refocuses again to find the fight over and place trashed. \"...My head...\"You whince, rubbing it. \"Hey, get up,\" John tells you standing over you. With his hand out and helping you up. He had his prize chest box in the other hand. His eyes quickly look you over, no damage really done. He was relieved.\"Go on inside.\"He tells you as the house comes over and he opens the window for you. With the box following. When Jason comes over and punches him square in the face.\"For 500 years I've been bound to Etrigen. Fighting to keep him coming forth. And you force me to summon him!\" \"Everything got sorted,\"John said in his defense. \"He could have gone on a killing spree. You don't think. You don't consider the cost!\" \"I did. Weighted against me eaten alive and thought yeah totally worth it.\" With those last words and regret for what he did John leaves to the house. Along with you. After a night in Sin City you needed to rest and after what happened you seriously needed too. Settle that urging side, while Orchid tended to you. She found nothing really wrong which was good. Though her concerns for your mental state where debatable. Sickened by it all, you threw up a couple of times to expel the guck and cleanse yourself. The black ooze came up foul and decrypted. This was why you could not go to places like that. Holding the bag for you Orchid waited until you were done, she even had some herbal tea for you along with some medical herb soup. Watching as your eyes flashed between normal and demonic, it took a strain on you. Her eyes see the burn markings upon your shoulders blades where your wings sprouted. permit no doubt, your skin looked rather charred. After a couple of more times, you finished and lay down. \"T-Thank you...\" you weakly say. Resting an arm on your forehead. When John knocks on the door and comes in. Orchid ties up the bag and goes to dispose of it. Leaving you both. It silent he looks at you in slight agony and sickness. This was his fault and he knew it. It irritated him seeing you like this. He still could not bring himself to say the words. \"What...?\"You growl lowly. An eye peering at him. He smirks back shrugging his shoulder.\"Nothing.\"He looks to the tea and levitates it over.\"You need to drink this.\" Stubbornly you refuse but he was just as stubborn if not more and stands over you glaring down.\"...Drink it.\"This time sterner. \"If you don't then I'll make you..\"Following with a threat, which you knew he would follow through with. Sitting up you take it and drink the stuff. It was an interesting taste. Ease your stomach and everything else. He watched and waited for you drink it, every last drop and levitates the soup over. \"...Lavender root...\"You could smell it.\"Birchwood too? Mandrake root...I might as well become a plant myself.\"Sighing and ingest it. What choice did you have? John watches you take it, even if you didn't too. He had to make sure you did, adding an extra ingredient he told Orchid to put. Raising a hand he stops himself and sticks it back into his pocket. Finishing it set it down.\"I know the drill,\"You look at him.\"What stays in the house, stays in the house. Not a word to Batman.\" He couldn't help but smile and shake his head.\"Yep. Now, get some rest.\" \"No, I think I'm up for a new lesson.\"You said getting up out of bed, but he stops you. \"Naw, just rest.\"He said and leaves before you could even object.\"Night.\"[Chapter 50] Chamomile and lavender scented candle with a tinge of ivy in them lite around you, the calming aroma was good. Considering what you were going to do. Sitting criss-crossed in the middle of the pentagram. One you designed yourself open the book to the right page, looking at it mentally read the passage, that you again tinkered with yourself. Reading it a third time felt satisfied to attempt this. Calming yourself, inhaling deeply close your eyes and clear your mind. Focus internally, the flames around you flickered to suddenly spring with energy. You still kept yourself focused as your marking started to glow and your dark aura surrounds like a flame. Still, under your control hold out a hand in the air as a small fissure begins to crack in it. Slowly it begins to expand, pushing more a circle of fire forms giving you a window to the world outside. You could hear them, see and feel the emotions of others. And push pass them to something deeper, that it grabbed you and next thing you found yourself somewhere...somewhere else. Unfamiliar and oddly terrorizing. Nightmarish. Opening your eyes find yourself in absolute darkness, except for this faint red glow not too far ahead. Curiosity getting the better of you float over, drawing strangely to it. Cup your hands around the crimson glow, it was warm and delicious. Yet also macabre and ominous. There was a pulse...you felt it. It was alive? How? What was this thing? Lightly you touch it and felt an odd disturbance from it. That wasn't all either, you begin to hear and feel past agonizing and nightmarish screams, from all around. It felt like thousands of daggers piercing you from every angle. Your senses became overwhelmed. Flashes of horrific terrors and nightmares of others flushed into your mind. So much that all you got where flashes, you try to keep your control but it was too much that you had to pull back from this powerful darkness. To find you couldn't. This glow kept you. Trying not to be frighten refused to allow such a minor power to subdue. Release a huge amount of commanding energy back, that it threw it back twice as hard. You saw a vision that scared you, before coming back to your actual senses. Panting from the experience that you weren't what it was. Look around finding yourself back in your room, that was now scorched, no doubt from you. Looking at the candles melted into puddles, remember the glow and spring up in haste and rush your room. To stop when you catch a glimpse of yourself in the mirror. Shocked to find yourself in your corrupted form. Just how? Looking at yourself knowing you couldn't go out like this, cause if you did...John he'd. You had to calm down...find your center. Their influence would not overtake you. This nightmare wouldn't. Taking in a few deep breaths, your extra eyes began to slowly disappear, your ears less pointy and your canines reverted back to their normal length. Your wings where the last to stay. For some reason, you had trouble disbursing them and your glowing markings. That spread further along your body. Along with your hunger. Dying to be feed. The voice inside wanting to be let out clawed inside. In fear. Fear? Why fear? Struggling a bit push it all down, Black Orchid appeared behind you. \"Violet, we hav-are you alright?\" She startled you that you lashed out, which she evades and places her hands on the side of your temple. Emits a healing glow that calmed you and reverted you back. \"W...what?\"You said disillusioned. Turn around to the mirror seeing her still healing you. That you remember what happened. None of your parental extras on you. Cleansed in a certain way. Still, your blood felt on fire. \"Are you alright?\"Orchid breaks your thoughts. You turn to her, unsure give a nod. So she stops healing. Her eyes look you over. \"I'm fine.\"You move her hands away. When you did, a scene flashes in your mind of Orchid dead. On the floor. That spiked your heart. But you pushed it down. Deep. \"Where's John?\" She was about to give you an answer, but you were too impatient to answer, engulf yourself in your flames and disappear. In the center of the house, Batman stood there annoyed listening to both John and Zatanna arguing about monkeys. With Deadman. Who filled him in. Patience waring thing, the Dark Knight gets ready to say something when he and Deadman notice a swirl of black flames appears and you emerge. Surprising Deadman. \"Whoa! What's with the girl?\" You heard him through John's rising voice and turn around thrilled and a bit confused to see Batman. Go over to him.\"Batman,\"you greet him giving him a hug. Which he returns with a half one.\"What's going on?\"Turning back around to John who was still going at it with a woman. Who you've never seen before. Though it was clear there was some relation there between the two. \"They use to be a thing,\"Deadman informs you coming to your side, you look at the red-clad ghostly man. Who just couldn't stop staring. Even if he smiled. \"Names Boston Brand. And you?\" \"We're wasting time,\"Batman takes command. Ending the argument.\"He's dead and I accept the risk. So can we get to it or do you two need a time out?\" You couldn't help but laugh to yourself at John. Who finally noticed you along with the woman. Who like Boston was surprised by your presence.\"Who is that?\"Pointing to you. Wanting an explanation from John. Who sighs and groans, something the woman read a look of shock spread across her face when she turned back to you. \"Violet.\"You said crossing your arms, walking over to her. Extending your hand, she seem hesitant for a second but shakes it, right when she made contact you saw an image of her dead too. Making you retract your hand away. \"Sorry.\" She didn't seem bothered.\"It's fine. My name's Zatanna. It's nice to finally meet you. I mean meet you. So, you live with him?\"Thumbing to John. Which you nod.\"For the time being. I'd ask how you know him, then again many who hate John there isn't much to fill in.\"She knew what you meant and was impressed chuckling at your words. Much to John's cringe.\"No one asked for your honest answer.\"He snips coming over shoving your head down.\"Now, what do you want? I've got things to do.\" Reading in-between his words knew it was a mission and you quickly became excited.\"You're going after what's being the strange disturbance aren't you? Let me go? Please!\" \"No.\" \"What? Why?\" \"Because this is too much for you. And I don't feel like being your babysitter.\"He turns his back and walks to the door, stopping when you teleport in front of him. Staring him down. He sighs.\"You're not coming, Violet.\" You protest.\"But I have to come. You know as good as me that you'll need my sensory abilities to pinpoint the negativity that is spreading like wildfire.\" \"No.\" He walks around you to door opening it. If he wasn't going to listen, then it left you no choice. \"Batman,\"Turning around to him.\"I never did get a chance to tell you about how my training has been coming along here.\" John reacts quickly and using his magic binds your mouth shut. Grumbling to himself brings you over to his side, the others watch him give you what seem like a stern talk. You stood there with a victory in your eyes. After a few more minutes John releases your bind.\"Okay?\"His whispers. You nod agreeing.\"Let me change.\"Commanding the flames around you, conjured up the proper clothing. Something that made Batman scowl even deeper at John who was shocked. You rid yourself of that witch-like dress and took to wearing something a bit more mature for your age. A backless halter-top tunic dress. Laced up on the side and front. With an attachable hood and fingerless gloves. Instead of shoes or boots you had leather laced heels all the way up to your ankles. It was clear you were growing, considering your outfit choice. And refreshed smile. All disapproving eyes lay on John.\"What? She's a teenager what'd you expect?\"He defends himself.\"Coming team?\" This was thrilling or so you would have felt if not for your mind weighing on something else. Even so, it was nice to have the chance to be on the magical field this time. Even if you had to blackmail someone. You had your reason, walking with the others the house dropped everyone off where John needed to go. You kept pace with them through the streets. To an old friend of John's, Ritchie Simpson \"So, who are you to John?\"Boston appears beside you. \"I mean, John isn't the one to have a child around really. Umm...\" he looks at your appearance.\"You're human right?\" \"As close as one can be. He's my tutor in the mystic arts.\" \"Really?\"He was surprised by this. Then laughs.\"Sorry, it's just the idea of John being someone's tutor is well, ya know.\"You got it and understood, though still took it just a bit offensively.\"So, what's your magic?\" \"Demonic and fallen. Darkness. Sinful.\"You list to his surprise.\"What about you?\" He seem glad you turned the attention on him.\"Was once a great and famous trapeze performer. Till well...an unfortunate accident happens. Stuck in-between until otherwise. I can possess others. If need to.\" \"Interesting. So you performed at the circus? My family was from one. An-\"Not paying attention bump right into Zatanna and John. Rubbing your nose look to see why they stop, gasping seeing and finding shrouds of Death outside circling in front of the place. You remember the information about these creatures and you remember in another way. They came to collect the souls of those dying. Inching back didn't help, you had no choice but to follow the others. Doing so closely to John, who subtle put out an arm in front of you. The creatures noticed everyone presence, though particularly John's. \"John Constantine,\" One spoke, its voice made your stomach drop and everything became cold. Slowly you inch back trembling just a bit. \"Conver over the Dark Arts and lifeline of last resorts. No matter your friend's soul will be collected and there's nothing you can do to alter that.\" \"Why don't you go do something useful and go hunt a house.\"John refutes back. Batman unsure what was going on needed clarification.\"Who's he talking to?\" \"Shrouds,\" Boston and you said. Which Boston fills him in,\" they deliver souls to Hell.\" The shrouds come closer, moving back bump into Batman, just as you get ready to move the creatures come and surround you both. \"They're drawn to you.\"Zatanna points out rather surprised. The creatures made your skin crawl and flare. Your stomach started to sway. Making sure they wouldn't touch you, one accidentally does burning your skin upon touch. Grabbing your arm quickly move away. \"What is this?\" One notices you moving closer, Batman puts a protective hand on your shoulder and moves you closer. It felt like it was smelling you, death leaked from it. Your heartbeat was racing, your powers flickered on edge and your feet were ready to flee. The voices of the others roared in your mind and the shrouds heard them. \"A child of old sin,\" one reaches out cupping your face tightly. It burned, it looks closer. Noticing something, turning back to John then to you. \"You are marked for Hell, child. Born soulless, shall die soulless, the stench of Constantine surrounds you, it has doomed and tainted you. You sinner!\" It shrieks. Something horrifying flashes in your mind it jolted through your body physically. You lash out, \"No!\" John grabs you firmly by the wrist and yanks you to him, glares at the creatures. With a smug smirk.\"This has been lovely, but it's time for you lot to bugger off.\" They turn to him.\"When the time comes, I will be the one to collect your soul. Constantine.\" It quickly looks at you. \"Yeah, yeah,\" John brushes it off, pushing you to Zatanna and quickly banishes them with a spell. You could finally breath.\"Are you okay?\"Zatanna asked looking you over. You give a little nod and sigh when someone lifts up your chin to them. John's eyes look you over carefully. He tilts your head to the left and right. Checking for something. When he didn't see it a slow smile begins to appear. When the door opens. \"I thought I felt a disturbance in the force,\" a thin and fragile man with a cane comes out, his eyes kind and tired. Smiles at John.\" how you doing Jonny boy. Zatanna...and..Batman! What the hell?\" \"Tell you everything inside mate,\"John tells him, walking up leading you. His hand rested lightly on your back. Walking pass the man give a polite nod, the man nods back, stopping suddenly with wide eyes. The same as Zatanna. Once inside, the man joins leading everyone to a room. He kept his smile, staggering a bit to rest his hand on his cane. He was sick, really sick. You could feel it, the growing silence that was soon to come and something else, you couldn't quite pinpoint. Noticing your stare, he raises at hand gently places it on your shoulder, startling you.\"Sorry sweetie,\" he chuckles lightly. \"didn't mean to startle you. My names Ritchie, my what beautiful eyes you have. Heh, reminds me a field of violet flowers in the Spring.\" \"You're...you're gravely...\"you couldn't get the words out. Bitting your lips, look away. He understood.\"Now, don't feel that way. Always look on the bright side in dark times. What's your name? Hmm? Flower?\" Not wanting to be rude tell him. Mustering up a smile.\"V-Violet.\" He gashes with a wide smile.\"Why what a beautiful name.\"His words so warm and jovial. Made your smile actually become a real one. \"For a beautiful young lady.\" \"Thank you, Mr. Simpson.\" He chuckles, resting a hand lightly on your shoulder patting it.\"Call me Uncle Ritchie. Alright?\"You give a nod, settled with that he turns back to the others, looking the longest at John. \"You poor thing,\"Zatanna comes over putting a gentle hand on his cheek. Ritchieappreciated her concern.\"Yeah, I might have lied the last time we talked, about how fast I'm sliding downhill. Sorry about that.\" He turns to John, placing a hand on his shoulder. But, it means a lot you're here John. And hey, you don't have to say it, you're forgiven. Still, wondering what Batman is doing in my living room. And when is he going to shut-up, right?\" He laughs. Looking to John who averts his eyes. \"What? What's with the face?\" John's silence, Ritchie realized it was something else. \"You're not really sorry are you?\" \"Of course I am,\"John defends himself. \"But I was looking to borrow the Keshanti Key.\" \"Unbelievable.\" Zatanna steps in trying to settle the tension and rising anger.\"I tried to tell him on the way.\" \"Yeah, it's not your fault, Z. Just like everything, this is rockstar Jonny's fault.\" He lashes at John. \"I was with you when it happened Ritchie, we were side by side.\" \"Yeah, side by side. I got the weird magical cancer. While you added to your rep, ain't that right?\" \"Look, me not making proper amends, isn't related to the key. With truth be told, you're not going to need mate.\" You couldn't believe he said that, covering your mouth.\"John!\" You and Zatanna gasp. Taking a step Batman holds you back. What happened next shocked you, even more, Ritchie punches John square in the face. Batman rushes and catches the man before he fell over. Ritchie wriggles out of his hold. \"Been getting that a lot lately,\"John said rubbing his chin. His comment was not needed. \"I can't imagine why,\"you throw back, crossing your arms. John grunts at your words. Warning you. \"You can go and screw yourself!\"Ritchie points, \"I am not giving you crap.\" Batman steps in.\"Your anger is understandable, but, you need to reconsider the risk. Innocent lives are at stake.\" Ritchie's anger remained flared for a bit, before considering Batman words. Nodding he complies and gets the key. Handing it to Batman.\"Well, doctor's saying upbeat can help, so I focus on today, is that I met Batman. A force for good. It was also nice seeing you, Zatanna.\"He looks to Zatanna. Then turns to you, resting a hand on your head. Patting it. \"And you, Violet. You're a good soul. Don't take after, him. You're practically the only good, from him.\" Taking his hand back he walks away,\"Now if you excuse me, you all can show yourselves out.\" Taking a step to follow Ritchie, when a hand rests on your shoulder. Looking finding Zatanna, shaking her head. Reluctant to follow she ushers you to follow. Looking up at John could feel mountain weight twisting and knotting. To quickly be buried and hidden. Slowly your head and eyes drop.[Chapter 51] This would be considered transpassing, but, in this case, it's alright. At Metropolis General Hospital John lead you and others through the halls to a particular patient of interest. It was a good thing none of you got caught, even if it happened there were ways to...persuade their memory to see nothing. A thought you wondered if John would use. Reaching the patient's room slip in again unnoticed. The second you stepped foot what felt like a sledgehammer hitting you, became overflowed with hunger. Looking at the patient see a feast of sin before you just for the taking. The tingling sensation of innocent blood he spilled and misery in his heart for it was just...just...disgusting. Yet, so delicious. It called to you and you listened, walking over, reach out to your meal fingers twitching your fingernails began to grow slowly. Swallowing the saliva building and dripping in your mouth. You could take it all away, all away from this man. You could...you could...shutting your eyes draw your hand back. No, no... you scream. Trying to block out this feverish feeling. And throbbing your chest, open your eyes find before you at your feet...bodies...bodies of everyone. Zatanna, Boston, Batman, even your cousin, Raven, Damian too and...\"John!\" Shrieking run over to him, your hand stretched out. \"John! Joh-\" Something shoots out and pulls you back. You fight and struggle against it to be overpowered, try to resist reaching out to John about to scream to find your mouth gagged. Inky darkness covers and swallows you up. Still, you reached out for something...someone. I-I don't want...I don't want to.. sinking deeper and deeper into nothing. Hear two things, one the distant sound of a man's voice...a sad man. Whispering something, something you could not make out and the other a dark manic laughter. Their presence was strong and close, very close. It sent fire through your veins, something wasn't right, it wasn't. It wasn't right! \"Violet! Vi!? Hey!?\" A voice shatters the darkness and yanks you back. Opening your eyes feel a firm grip on your wrist restraining you, moving your eyes up find John, staring right back. \"What are you doing?\" Stunned yourself, all you could do was just mumble incoherently dropping your head cringing. \"S-Sorry...\"was all you could mutter taking your wrist back. Keeping your eyes away from John. He sighs heavily running his fingers through his hair grumbling. \"Just,\" he bits his lip holding back what he wanted to say. \"just stay with Batman. Alright? I've got some work to do. And,\" holding up a finger throws it out. \"never mind.\" Leaving he walks to the sedated man places the object Richie gave him, it creates a small vacuum hole on his forehead. A way into the mind, his dark and scrambled mind of poison and sweet deliciousness for your rising hunger once again. Bitting down on your lip hard draw blood to snap yourself out of becoming too intoxicated. Quickly licking your salty blood before it was noticed something spikes through your body sending trembles of fear. You lunged to John grabbing him firmly by the wrist yanking him back that you nearly ripped it off. \"No!\" you flare throwing and shoving him back. Stand before him and the man baring your canines at him. Your eyes spread with blacken darkness. Your markings being to glow. John was caught off guard. Zatanna held her gasp. \"What are ya doing?\" John steps to you, fixing his shoulder rubbing it. \"Nearly took off my shoulder.\" He received no answer from you but a deep snarl. This was happening right now, with you. \"Vi, ya need to mo-\" Your flames slowly simmered all around you. Giving your answer. Zatanna felt something grip her, no her soul from you staring into it. It shook every fiber in her body, this power coming from someone your age and size was...those eyes...your eyes. She's... her thoughts rise realizing. Her eyes shift to John who remained unfazed. A hard look on the man's face, but there was something else Zatanna noticed. It was the same look he had with the Shrouds when they came close to you. A look she hadn't seen and knew it was one he pushed down deeply. Buried it. Richie's last few words to you echoed in her mind from the look John had with you. Something about being the only good thing. Moving her eyes to you saw behind its darkness something shaking in you, pleading to John but came out transformed into defiance. A look John carried pretty well. You were ready to attack John if he paid no mind to your words. \"I said,\" he takes another step to you. \"move. I won't ask again.\" Your flames rose this time increasing the heat, all you produced was a threating growl. Your features seem to be changing becoming less human. Feeling her eyes on you shoot them over to the woman, just what John needed in one quick motion his hand presses against your temple. The second you realized it was too late, his incarnation was quicker than your reaction. A blinding light pulsated through your body causing you pain, just enough to subdue you. Zatanna watches as your body drops like a sack of potatoes. John catches you. \"John!\" she exclaims, horrified by the action. \"Why di-\" \"Oh, don't get your feathers ruffled,\" he quickly defends himself clarifying his action. \"she'll be fine. Just something to bring her back. Here Bats can you take her?\" He hands you over to the man. \"Now then,\" turning back to the task at hand. This mystical mystery needed to be solved. Ready to enter the man's mind, Zatanna holds him back refusing to let him go by himself unless she goes with him. Seeing she wasn't going to allow him to or allow him to say no allowed her to come. Leaving Batman alone with you. In just about five minutes after John and Zatanna entered, you come back. Rubbing your head winching from the minor pain it still caused. Grumbling under your breath. \"Damn it, John. W-Where...\" Pausing look around quickly remembering you were at the hospital...the reason was...seeing the comatose man with the small vacuum-like wormhole in the center of his temple. Oh yeah, John had to use what Richie gave him to open a fast portal to the man's mind. A part of you wished you had mind reading right now, that way you'd be able to know if everything was going well in there. Not knowing stung, John he needed to listen to you...he...otherwise...pressing the thought aside stood with Batman and waited. Inside the mind of the comatose man Zatanna and John look through the man's memories. With Zatanna managing to endure this dark kind of magic. Most of the man's memories weren't rather pleasant, his life seem to see more darkness that carried over to his adult life. It reminded Zatanna of another. Setting a memory aside speaks it to John. \"Violet, her eyes they hold darkness in them.\" The mention of you got John's attention. \"I've never seen such eyes like that before. It leaks from her. Why is that?\" John kept his attention on one of the memories he held. Moves to another when Zatanna came closer. She didn't stop despite his abrasiveness. Going deeper. Seeing his answer behind his eyes. \"Tell me John, is she...is after New Castle?\" No answer again. But she saw it. \"She's not your sins John. That darkness isn't from you.\" He just turns his shoulder a bit, blocking out her words focusing on another memory. \"Found it.\" This waiting game was taking to long. John hadn't returned nor had Zatanna. If they hadn't come out then...did it happen? Your mind flamed with the vision you saw, their bodies...all their bodies. Lifeless. It took him away..it took everyone away. Everything was gone, the world covered and painted in nothing but blood and flames. And darkness. You were alone with no one around. Everywhere you looked and turned bodies, bodies everywhere. It was taking them away, it had John already...it had him! \"John!\"You get ready to dive in, if not for Batman's quick reflect and pulls you back firmly. You try to get out of his grip. \"Let me go!\" \"Violet, calm down.\" Fighting to pry him off wasn't like you. He noticed. Your nostrils flared at his resistance to release you. Raising a hand ignite fist of dark flames when a darker presence was felt. It was powerful and coming this way. Noticing your frozen disposition, halted fear spread across your face. Your fire vanishes turning. \"T-That...\" Your head whips to the door, sensing the rising danger snap and your flames engulf you taking you away Batman. Emerging in the hall outside the room. Feel the presence stronger, your hunger rose. Igniting yourself in flames teleport yourself to its current location. Appearing seconds too late. Find burning skeletal remains on the floor and a ghastly smell of feces. What made it worse there were even traces of it. Holding your rising gagging, swallow it down take a few steps stopping nearly stepping in a pile. Covering your mouth feed off the bit of lingering. Not feeling but it would do. \"There is some powerful magic here...but...\" you gasp realizing the purpose. \"John! The others!\" Calling upon the flames again appear right outside the room. Feel the presence stronger, it felt like a blow by a sledgehammer. It was hard not to smile in sweet glee or throw-up when you saw what it was. A living feces beast being in some strange way held back by Batman. It looked so delicious more than anything. No! That wasn't important right now, this creature was here for a devious purpose. Its intentions clear, you could smell it a mile away. Flipping through your mind for the move to use, just pick the easiest and simplest one. Raising a hand the ground begins to rumble and a dark seal appears under the creature. Remain focus. Do not lose your sanity. \"Feed my flames of Hell and devour the creature made of sweet sin!\" From the ground spewed sharp tentacles of fire coiled around the creature. It screeches in pain. It resisted. It was strong, but you were stronger. Calling and dipping down more into locked up desire, it granted you the power you sought. This delicious morsel would be all yours. The thought enticed you, you wouldn't let it escape. It would be yours, all of it would. You needed to feed, this insatiable desire was stronger than before. It whispered sweet words in your ear. You couldn't agree more with. More. More was all you thought. Its hollering screeches was like angelic singing, the more it screamed the more pain you wanted it to feel. The more you indulged in desire. Blocking out everything else. Feeling heat suddenly rising and an eerie cold Batman turns around finding you with a sinister smile spread across your lips. Your markings glowing. \"Violet!\" He charges, tackling you. You hit the ground hard, knocking you back. Sitting up rub the back of your head. \"W-What happened?\" Hearing the creatures roar brought you back. Standing quickly you and Batman hurry after it after it threw Deadman. It entered the room where the patient was, locking you and Batman out. Pounding on the door, stop after a few seconds and get ready to blast. Stop realizing it was not the best idea. You could cause something horrible to happen. Teleporting in wouldn't work either unsure what the creature might do or that magic. Again you were left helpless, a decision needed to be made or...lifeless bodies. Coming a to one ignite your hands in flames point them at the door. \"Move.\" Growl to Batman and Deadman ready to fire. Speaking in Latin, stop when the door opens and that presence suddenly vanishes. John and Zatanna step out unharmed though the room was covered in feces. Turning your head nearly gagged again. Mumbling. \"To think I was going to eat that...bleh.\" \"Let's get the hell out of here.\" John orders everyone. Running down the hall with everyone following. \"Vi, get us out of here.\" Nodding you call upon the flames, the crept from the ground and corners all around. Deadman was caught off guard by the enclosing flames that swallowed everyone into Hellish darkness.[Chapter 52] Fleeing the hospital John and Zatanna got what they needed. Unable to make out the image they had John knew there was only one person who could. Disguarding the pity grudge Ritchie had with him, this was more important than that, hurries back to the man's place. To find a mass of shrouds outside the man's front door. You rush forward.\"Richie!\" John tried to snatch you back, but you were too quick. Forgetting about the effects and burning touch the creatures caused. Quickly reminded when one grabs you by the arm sending a surge of pain straight through you. \"The child of sin!\" It hisses deliciously. Tightening its grip. It was hard to hold back any tears, not a single drop of mercy in its black and hollowed face. Only death and cold. \"You shall be the ripest soul of all, the payment of all his transgressionshas done in sin shall be repaid through you. His vile and toxic plagues your very veins.\" It moves closer that you could feel its icy breath freeze your flaming skin. Your mind screamed of a magnitude of pain, you fell to your knees from it. Their words you barely heard but felt it all, every single sin cut you inside like a blade drawing blood. The spiking screams of those inside clawing and ripping away like vultures. These Shourds...they saw everything and so did you. It was flashes of images or was it memories...your infant cries on the coldest night...the loneliest night. This you knew...you knew well...but the others you didn't. What did register was a familiar voice...John's. It sounded younger and in loathing grief. Wait. There was something else too...another voice it sounded like... her ... Belladonna. Your mother. Her voice was heard, but...your surroundings they weren't familiar. This place you hadn't been here before, but could feel everything it offered. Terror. Horror...death...guilt. Overloading every nerve in your body. Screams upon screams screeched in your ears, like a banshee. What was going on? What were these images? These memories? Who were these people? What was going on? Where were the others? Where was John? Your cousin? Everyone? Grinding your teeth, tears of pain pour out into pools under you. Was this actually Hell? Was it? There was only way to know, whipping your head around find it to be. Before you drowning in nothing but in a crimson red pool of their own blood. Everyone. From Dick to Raven. To Batman even to John. Lifeless and hollow. A sight your eyes screamed. They were all gone, all of them...how could they...an eerie presence swept behind you. Frozen, you felt it reaching out to you, its fingers hovered over your shoulder, holding your breath shriek when it barely brushes on your shoulder expel a powerful blast from your body incinerating everything. Left you weak, fall completely to the floor. There was nothing now, nothing but silence. Even the pain was silenced. The voices too...everything. All but one...John's voice. You could hear it faintly...very faintly the words could barely be made out but you managed to hear just a bit. Enough that for some reason cut deep. Trying to muster up some form of energy to speak find no words. Nor energy. Blinking slowly to focus your vision, see nothing...but feel that presence once again. It came and went so quickly, it seem like a mistake, but you felt it rising...growing. Growing with patience and impatience wrath that even your hunger feared. With quivering lips and tears still running down try to speak. Tried to scream. Reach out to find nothing but silence. Except for John's voice. John stood over your unconscience body resting in your bed back at the house. Watching your chest slowly rise and fall, again and again. Slowly it was returning back to it normal rhythm. Which was good, but the rest of you...his eyes wonder carefully over you from top to bottom, he wasn't sure. Those shourds did a number on you, if he'd only been quicker in snatching you back or putting up some sort of spell to keep you back than...you wouldn't be in this condition. You wouldn't be in this condition at all. No. You'd be better off. If he hadn't...\"I can't have this turn out like...\" He bites his lip from uttering the word on his tongue that still haunted him and cursed him. Those things, they almost...almost nearly took you...the more he thought about it the more enraged he became. If you hadn't bothered to hurry to Ritchie's aid then...growling he couldn't blame you. It wasn't your fault. None of it was. At least you were safe, but, he takes hold of your wrapped wrist gently, examing it smoothly. There were some speckles of blood that came through the cotton white, but nothing more. Orchid managed to wrap it and put the proper onimate on it, the rest you'd have to do on your own. As her healing magic only worked so well. He sets it down when your door opens. Orchid steps in to check up on you, surprised to find John. So close to you and his face grim with anger and eyes clouded in guilt. Remaining quiet and observant watches John's actions. His hand hesitantly hovering over you, shaking slightly as if afraid. Pulls it back turning around muttering something under his breath stopping mid-sentence finding Orchid there. Her eyes leave him over to you. Opening her mouth about to say something he clears his throat and leaves. Something wasn't right, something was leaking...it was strong...closer than before. The same nightmarish feeling crawled all over your skin, just as it did before. Unsettled and unable to pinpoint its location just that it was upon you, stand and stare deep into the flickering flames of the fireplace. No one was here, besides Orchid and Ritchie whom she was tending too. John and the others had left, Orchid filled you in, they had gone to face Faust as he was the one who behind all this. Faust, you've heard about him, read up about him and for some odd reason you felt like you crossed paths too. How you weren't sure, you were sure your nerves trembled with fear. John and the others, their corpses at your feet. The horrific screams of many, the chaos and carnage that erupted from it all. It was a nightmare. Trying hard to remain calm and in control from the rising hungry and desire, was taxing enough for you. This source, it needed to be sniffed out and taken out. It was causing unbalance that crept closer and closer with each passing second. Its weight you felt pressing on you. Shutting your eyes open them quickly upon seeing a dark figure. A chill ran through your spine, despite the warmth the fire gave. That figure...thinking the best you could calm your breath slowly close your eyes again and take a step while remaining quiet manage to see the figure clearly. It was a man. A dark hooded man. With red eyes. That spoke and emitting fear, such a sweet and alluring scent. Your hunger triggered from his stare his hand outstretched offering you the feast you craved. You shouldn't take it, stepping back find your hand reaching back. This wasn't right, it wasn't. But, you needed to be fed. Every ounce of you trembled with succulence taste you yearned for. How could you pass up a meal? Like this? He waited patiently for you to offer your hand, a sinister curled on his lips. Unnoticed, until it was too late. Your eyes get a glance of it and pull your hand back, his hand strikes out grabbing you by the wrist, sending a powerful shock through you. Screaming you lash back with a blast enough to seperate the contact. Blowing you back you see his image flicker seeing another quickly, what you saw surprised you. Your body gets flung across the floor, red energy crackled around you. Collecting yourself force yourself to stand. It took a second for your vision to return, by the time it does you scream for Orchid. \"Black Orchid! Black Orchid!\" Staggering pick yourself only to stumble. \"John! I have to warn John!\" Falling when someone catches you. Believing it to be Orchid tell her what you saw. \"We have to get John back here, he needs to know tha-\" \"Needs to know what? Flower?\" Your body went cold, that voice made your body tremble. Your vision finally returned find Ritchie the one who caught you. A calm and wicked smile on his thin lips looking down at you. For someone who is ill, his grip on you was strong. That wasn't all either, that feeling...that spoke to your hunger leaked from him. Your mouth about to fall open if you didn't catch it. It was him. Your eyes darkened with anger. He clicks his tongue. Shaking a disappointed finger. \"Now, now flower that isn't polite. Why you done and make a face like his?\" His voice and grip tighten with anger. Sends a shock through your body. Causing a painful scream. \"Shhh...shhh..\"he hushes you. \"Don't scream, I don't mean to hurt you. But, that look has got to stop.\" Falling to your knees manage to lift your head with the irritated expression he disliked. \"I said...stop!\" This time it was double the juice through you. You tried to call upon your flames but the pain took all your attention away from it. Ritchie kept his hold on you, watching and waiting for any response. Still remaining on your knees, your head hadn't lifted up again. A part of him wanted you to, to lift that head with that... face. That loathing face he'd come to detest. For years and years. Now, he had the means to exact his own justice, but your head remained hung. Testing his patience he was about to send another shock through stopping when a voice told him no. \"Why not!?\" he shouts, the voice whispers to him again. \"It'll be so easy! Let me do this! He deserves this, he deserves this to be taken away from him, just as he took everything from me.\" He turns back to you a murderous intent flaring in his eyes. \"So I'll take the only good thing in his life.\" About to act, reconsiders. Listening to the voice, nods agreeing. Dropping your arm remembering he had more pressing matters. The rest of it had to be here. Once he found it, then he'd have the power he needed. Everything would be fixed. Stepping over you like a rug begins his search. His back to you, slowly you open your eyes observing him. You had to get up and move. But you needed to be careful. Body still aching with some pain, bite down and drag yourself across the floor. Ignoring the painful crackling of energy around your body still. You had to find a way to reach John. Inch by inch you move, while doing your best to remain aware of Ritchie. It was good he was more focused in finding whatever it was he needed too. You just needed to reach the stairs and you were sure you'd be able to something. Just a few more inches and you were there...you could reach John. You could at least fight back against Ritchie. Stretching out your shaky hand, something straight and dark stabs it down. Going straight through the skin, tissue, and muscles. The crimson liquid slowly rolled out from your new wound. Shocked first by the sight, before the pain came, do your best to hold in the scream ready to come. A shadow stands over you. Ritchie stares down triumphantly at you. Even kneeling down to your level patting the top of your head lightly. \"Now, where do you think you're crawling off to?\" This asshole was really starting to get under your skin. \"From the looks of it,\" his eyes look at the stairs. \"you were trying to get away. Trying to call Johnny Boy? As much as I would love that,\" he emphasized. \"I can't have you do that.\" He twists his cane deeper into your hand. Wanting to hear some scream, but nothing. Only that damn look again. \"I hate those damn eyes.\" He said coldly with a dark smile whispers. \"So, guess we're gonna have to change that. Now, I as I recall, you were born of sin. Right? Right.\" He pats your head lightly again. \"Johnny sure did work with you, trying to clean his own past sins. Well, guess that didn't work now did it? No, it didn't. But, it'll work for me just fine. You see this?\" He pulls the butt of his cane out from you, not even bothering to wipe the blood away. Shows you the top with a crimson dark stone on it. Your eyes remain fixated on it. Ritchie chuckles lightly. \"Yes. As I thought.\" Moving closer to you, just an inch apart. \"Hungry? I thought so.\" Watching you react to the energies of the stone, your physical appearance changing into more of a demonic form. Pleasing the man. \"Bloom, flower. Bloom.\" Faust wasn't it. It wasn't Faust at all, how could John be so stupid. How could he? Ritchie, it was that asshole all along. Sending him and the others on a wild goose chase. When all alone he just wanted access to the House. To the most important artifact of all he had stored there. That wasn't all either. There was something else, someone else... Violet. Rushing back with only one thing on his mind, John locates the house with others. Finding he had no access to it unless Ritchie gave it. Already on edge and furious, the man orders his old friend to open up. Which was granted. Entering with the others John finds Ritchie up and well. Standing before the fireplace. Calmly. Demanding an explanation from him sees Ritchie holding his hand the rest of the Dreamstone. That wasn't what shocked and angered John. No. It was who appeared in a swirl of hell-fire that did. Their eyes glowing red and no longer human looking. Sprouted fire wings from their back staring hard at John. \"You like?\" Ritchie mocks noticing John's attention on his newest assistance. \"Lovely isn't she?\" He places a light hand on your head. Patting it. \"Don't you touch her!\" John barks. \"Get your hands off her. Or so help me I'll-\" Ritchie throws his head back and laughs. \"Or you'll what? What are gonna do? Hmm?\" John said nothing. \"I thought so,\" Ritchie chuckles. \"you know something...I was rather shocked when I found out. Johnny Boy was able to find a way to save his own soul from damnation. It blew my mind. It pissed me off! All the shit you've done. You did! And you get away Scott-free, with your own personal sin-eater. To take it all away when the time comes, to damn their soul instead of your own...just like Astra.\" The name stung John, his eyes darken at the man. Watching him carefully as he continues. \"Always having someone else pay for what you did. Astra and now...you're own.\" He strokes your cheek gently. \"Oh, what a pity.\" \"I said,\" John repeats his words this time deadlier than before. \"don't touch her. Unless you want to keep your hands. Leave her alone, she has nothing to do with this.\" Ritchie stops and leaves you alone. \"No, you're very wrong. She has everything to do with it. Like I said,\" his words came out eerie and cruel. \"She's the best thing that's ever happened to you. Sweetheart,\" he whispers in your ear. \"Why don't you go and make your papa proud.\" Stepping back Ritchie kept his smirk on, the others wait to see what you would do. You remained still. \"Violet,\" John takes a few steps towards you. Holding his hands up. \"Vi, listen to me, d-don't...don't do this. Okay? Listen to my voice, you need to...Violet...Violet. Violet! No!\" With a loud shriek, unleash a powerful breath of fire at him. He just barely managed to protect himself from the heat of the flames. Pushing back screaming your name, you lunge at him narrowly hitting him. But manage to knock him back, engulf yourself in flames and disappear. I wanted to say thank you to everyone for reading the story. Also, I know the Justice Leauge Dark is coming to an end, meaning the story. I most likely might add a bit more by including the John Constantine City of Demons show in here as well. Another, most likely when I am done with this story, I might do Violet in DC Rebirth for a new storyline. Just giving you a heads up. Anyway, thank you again. :)[Chapter 53] Papa, he would be so proud. So proud of you. You had to make him proud. So very proud. The idea of him not being happy with you could not cross your mind, no, you would put everything you have into making it right. You would make everything better. Everything right. And when he saw what a glorious job you were doing, he would love you. Yes. He would. Landing on top of the highest building perch, gaze down with black eyes scouring all below. Like a predator on the hunt, your skin crawled, it burned from the corruption below. Darkening your skin even more, changing further from humanity into a huntress. Into a seeker. Into a Devour of Sins. Their sins filled the air like sweet honey, it enthralled you in its webs of poison. Growling lowly with bared fangs, your dark nails no longer nails, now sharp and pointed. Almost talon like, dig into the solid concreate like it was paper. Your wild and unruly white hair like a lions wild mane blew in the wind of the voices haunting you, their gleeful voices twisting everything inside. Nothing else but their voices, urging you to feed. To go and make your father proud. Make him so very proud. Standing now step out and walk, a small construct disc platform of dark fire appears under you. With each step you took, it remained even when you stopped. Your eyes still scouring deciding which to feed upon first. The longer you waited, the more your hunger became irresistible. It needed to fed, yet...there was something small inside that held you back from acting. Unsure what it was, there was this other voice...it was faint but strong. This wouldn't...it wouldn't make your father proud if you stayed. If you didn't feed. He needed to be proud, you had to make it better. If you didn't then...swallowing hard at the thought, jump off upon your first unexpected victim. Hunger was all your yes saw, all it could. Nothing but sin and nothing but food. Nothing more. Talons outstretched pierce the flesh of your chosen victim like butter before your weight pushed them down. Their painful screams were deaf on your ears, all of it was...all you saw was their immoral act of transgression. All you saw was food. Wrapping a hand around their throat hold them up like a feather, their feet dragged on the ground. Their terrified eyes gained no sympathy from you, you remained unhinged. Snarling instead of words tighten your grip as it starts to burn your victim. Their screams where silenced before it they could escape their mouth, they were completely silenced. The body you held drops and remains still. Licking your lips slowly, than your fangs step over the body and go to find another. The next couple of ones put up a fight, but you easily subdued them. With each flick of the wrist your fire ensnared, they burned...all of them. They burned from your touch, it wasn't enough. It wasn't to satisfy you, nor would it be to please your father. Bodies dropped, empty bodies, you left a trail of them behind. Moving to the sound of the voice...to the pleasure of your father. To see him, to hear him say he was proud. To make sure...it wouldn't happen. Running your talons along the brick wall, leaving a deep gashing trail behind. Pick up more...alert manifest your wings and fly to it. Your blood pumped through like rushing water, this would be it...all of this would be enough. Seeing each one, swoop down grabbing one throw them hard into car, their body, their bones crushed and shattered from the impact. Made them unable to attack or flee. Good. It would be easy, landing in the street feel a surge all around, they were so many...so many around. Everywhere...you could feed on them all. Every single one. They would be yours, you would clean it all...all of it! No. A voice boomed sharply, your legs locked and remained grounded. Every part of you. That voice spoke to you, it did. It was your resistance. Why? Searching through the other voices, through all...try to find it, but in this mess you saw nothing but a pool of ink. Of those you housed, but, not a voice of the one who called. But, their presence was there...you knew it had to be in order for it to be this strong and prevent you from feeding. Vi, don't do it. Hearing it a bit clearer, their words pleading grievingly. The care it carried, the sincere care...it was protective too. Their words soft and gentle. It reminded you of something..someone years ago...when everything was cold and alone. Trying yo fight against it, stepping to your crippled prey hear it again. \"Enough!\" you screech unleashing a blast of fire at the victim incinerating them. This time their screams reached you, realizing what you did disperse the flames but the damage was done. Their crisp body falls and smell charred flesh filled the air. Gasping a bit, step back shakily. This...what was going on? Grabbing your head, everything was pounding all over. Unsure what way to go, expel an inferno all around the flames decimated your current surroundings like a storm. What once stood burned to the ground, what was once strong crumbled into pebbles. Everything was gone...everything. You saw no one. Anyone. Where did they all go? The voices screamed painfully in your head like sharp daggers stabbing all around. Falling to your knees, unleash another inferno this time larger than the last and this time it stayed. Dark flames of hell moved with a mind of their own devouring all in their way. Acting up on your will. Upon your torment. Your screams screeched all through the city, it put a cruel smile upon Destiny's face. The dark wizard smiles absorbing the fears of girl, it powered him. He could feel her essence through his dreamstone. It was delicious. Fear could affect even the most powerful. She was no doubt cowering now, like a whimpering child from the horrors she was in. What made it better...his link. She decided to dive into a world unknown, came to seek him out. So he gave her the glimpse needed, seeped himself into her. Till he leashed her. A God needed their own pet. Remaining in his magical sphere of protection moved over to see his work at hand. Her flames danced in his eyes, Hell on Earth was coming faster than he anticipated. The ground shook from her raging fear screaming, he saw it...the glory before him. His rod, absorbing in everything. All. This was a Sin Eater. Watching sadistic joy decides to add further. Shooting a crimson energy beam strikes her, her screams erupt as her flames do the same. \"That is a good girl.\" Turning around heads back to continue his siege of fear and chaos. They were ripping you apart, pulling every part of you away. Ripping and clawing with vengeance, your mind was being torn. Your screams did nothing to help, your cries nothing...there was no one there. No one. No figures. No names. Nothing. Everything was just gone. Except this Hell, more and more voices came. They crowed everything inside. Trying to find a sense of peace...some light...to find nothing but darkness. Darkness dragging you down, you try to scream for someone..anyone...why did you come here? Why did you follow? Where was...those faces...those feelings you couldn't sense them. But, those eyes you could see...blue ones...green ones...light blue ones...violet ones...hazel...they stayed. They looked. They called. You tried to fight back, to reach them but couldn't. You didn't want to go back, you didn't want back to the abyss. You didn't want to feed anymore...you... Using a Latin incantation a golden shield surrounds them, pushing back the flames. Pushing them back, keeping them at bay. They had to be quick, they had to do this fast. Though the spell was strong, these flames were stronger. Now. Fueled and spreading, with a rushing run dive towards the middle. Their willpower had to be stronger to get through, it was...it needed to be. Destiny was a dead man. They'd make sure of it, right now though vengeance needed to stay out of the mind, less the flames feed on it. Dismissing the thoughts, plow forward. Repeating the spell again and again, their hand outstretched it was true they couldn't see what was in front of them...they never did. Not even day one, did they see. Wrapped up in their own sorrow and grief. Their selfish repentance. To right the wrongs they've done, not realizing what they had done. They just didn't see. They never saw...John, he didn't. The temperature rose the closer he got, the hairs on his skin began to burn. Tethers of his clothes too, it didn't matter. Stretching his arm further in front, a blast of fire whips fiercely at him. It nearly knocked him back, but he kept going. \"Vi, if you can 'ear me,\" he shouts into the darkness. \"I'm right here...'lright.\" Nothing but anguish lashing was returned. Grunting he kept going. Trying to reach you. \"Vi! Violet! Listen to me!\" His voice raises. \"You need to stop, okay? You're...\" A shoots out phasing through his protection and grips his throat. Straggling him. He knew who the dark hand belonged to. Between breaths he kept speaking. \"V-Vi...listen..listen to me. I know you're still in there...\"the grip tightens. He had to be fast. Ignoring the shorting of breath and life slipping away, kept it up. This wasn't the time to be guarded, no, with little strength he had his eyes softened. And the words the last words that came out he just hoped reached you. His daughter. A answer he didn't get to see, with his throat crushed air stopped reaching and everything black. Everything was black...for second, he heard something...whimpering...his name. It was a collaboration of the two. Someone was crying...for him? Opening his eyes slowly, it took a second for his vision to come back, looking around first saw no flames. But, the destruction was there, it was all around. Not a single soul in sight. The damage left behind was...sitting up rubbing his neck that still hurt a bit, remembered...\"Violet!\" He stands up fast, the whimpers steady his heart, his eyes find you there in the middle laid out on the ground, still in your demonic form. From head to toe, he walks over steadily. Swallowing hard the color drained from his face at the sight of you motionless, besides your mouth that utter his name over and over again. Crying, he saw the tears trickle down your eyes onto the burnt ground. You were alive, good, but alright..that was yet to be determined. Kneeling down he scoops you in his arm, his eyes scan you over making sure nothing was wrong physically. Pulls you close, his nose in your neck...anger trembled through him. If he wasn't holding you, he sure would have... Destiny...John's face darkened in the direction of the mad man. Standing up carefully with you cradled in his arms waves a hand before him, a magical portal appears, he steps in and mere seconds steps out back into the madness. Looking around he goes and places you next to Jason now split from Etrigon. \"Whoa!\" Boston gasp surprised at you, the saw the damage...on you...\"Is she...\" he stops himself, his eyes fall to John who had a look Boston hadn't seen before. There was something in the harden look he transfixed on Destiny that sent shivers through the ghost. The 'God' was getting more powerful by the second, which Boston pointed out to John. Turning to his friend John an idea flicked behind that dark look. \"I say we talk to a man about a horse.\" \"Did you hit your head or something?\" Boston wasn't following, rather confused. \"You're babbling.\" \"A Trojan Horse. Come on.\" John leads, Boston follows. To get Destiny's attention, John hurls fire balls, the man turns his attention to the annoyance. \"Over here you wanker!\" John baits. \"You are puny and disrespectful.\" Destiny comes over angered at the man. \"Let me see you madness.\" Grabs him with a mystical hand bringing John into the protective shield. John smirks. Retorting.\"Yeah, that's the trouble with me, been there done that.\" \"Then I shall make you beg, for death,\" Destiny shifts his eyes towards you down below. \"Just as I did your daughter.\" John still kept his smirk on. \"Can I beg you to stop talking?\" Destiny grabs and pulls him closer. \"I mean all wizards are touch, but you, your a full blown nutter.\" \"I will tear your soul apart.\" \"What happened to not frauduling with mortals eh? You chat like my grandmother at book club.\" Distracted by his insulted words gave John the perfect opening. \"Now, Boston!\" Boston leaps from John's body and straight into Destiny's surprising the wizard. Wounding him, they fall out the sky, his shield down. Boston jumps out, goes over to John they watch and wait. Destiny angered readies to attack them, Jason stabs his sword in him from behind through the chest. Knocking the dreamstone out. Onto the street. \"Is that a sword in your chest? Or you just glad to see me.\" John quips, smirking. Falling to knees with the sword lodged in his chest, Jason leans over with a few words to say. \"Merlin sends his regards, oh, and by the way..you lose.\" Taking over John recites a Latin incantation forming his golden seal, casting it under Destiny. The 'God' engulfs in flames screaming in agony as his body burns away. He tries to reach for the stone, Batman comes and destroys it. The spirit of Destiny disperse, Ritchie returns surprised himself. John and the others stand before him, John stared harder, his face darken. Ritchie saw the fury in his eyes burning with vengeance he wished to take, instead allowed something else to take have Ritchie. Feeling a cold presence Ritchie turns around in horror, the Shrouds circled him. Hissing deliciously. \"Johnny, I-I..\" Ritchie panics and pleads trying to get away. \"I was under a compulsion. You gotta save me! You owe! me. You owe!\" \"Sorry, mate can't take a chance Destiny is still pulling your strings.\" John said coldly. His eyes slide quickly to you in Batman's arms. He wasn't going to intervene, no, he wasn't kidding when he told Ritchie...not to touch you. He watched his former friend's soul be taken and dragged to Hell. Everything ended. It was over. Except for one...Jason. He topples over suddenly, John manages to catch him, sets him down gently. His former wound centuries before came back, succumbing to it. There was little time he had left, surrounded by everyone Jason dies away peacefully. Mourning his fallen friend John's eyes flicker back to you, still in your demonic form, you hadn't awoken. Where you dead? Reading his thoughts, Batman answers the question. \"She's fine. Faint, but she's fine.\" Relieved John sighs, turning back to Jason his last breath leaves and his soul now free. A few days after John, along with Zatanna, Etrigen, and Boston use the House of Mystery to go and bury Jason back near the town he was born. Leaving a tombstone in honor of him. They pay their respects once more, Etrigen even commenting Jason was more of a brother whom he would gladly go into battle with again. With his final words the demon takes his leaves though not before inquiring about you. Bringing you with him for further tutelage. John declined. Understanding the demon leaves. He and Zatanna remain a few moments longer at Jason's grave, head back to the house. Which Zatanna informs him that she has been given a membership to the League and that Batman had requested John to be apart too. To his surprise. About to say something when Boston comes rushing out. \"John!\" \"What? What is it?\" He asked his panicked friend. Who tries to get the words, but delayed them. John saw the answer, what Boston was trying to say. The door to the house opens and to his joy and surprise you walk out Black Orchid behind you, dressed in large white shirt. Rubbing your eyes, looking well. Tired. But well. Most importantly, you were you. No longer in your other form, there were still traces physically of your demon heritage you had. The white hair, markings, dark nails and tail had returned. But, your eyes...your eyes where your own. \"John...\"you mumble walking out, your steps a bit staggered. Nearly caused you to fall forward. \"Whoa, I got you luv.\" John catches you, his arms wrap around. Zatanna stood back watching the moment, smiling softly to herself. The way he held Violet in his arms. \"Here.\" She comes over helping too. \"You okay?\" She asked tenderly tucking hair behind your ear. You nod at them both, though your eyes looked past them at Jason's tombstone. Your eyes fall mournfully as you read his name. Your mind couldn't help but wonder...if you caused this...this to happen...if you did then maybe...your chest tightens. Your head drops, this was your fault. You knew it, you could feel it. If you hadn't...trying hard to hold your tears in, quickly wipe them away. Feel a hand on your shoulder, it pulled you close. Holding you tight. \"It's want's your fault.\" John whispers, assuring you. \"It never was.\" Zatanna comes to the other side placing a hand on your shoulder. Giving it a squeeze. Her eyes smile at you assuring you what John said to be true. It allowed your tears to fall freely. \"Come on, let's go.\" John said, turning you back around to the house. Nearly a week passed since what happened, you had your laptop opened and decided to call on Damian. He answered right away, you smile glad to see him. He returns it along with a question. \"How are you doing? My father told me what happened, I knew it wasn't good for you to be there...\"he stops noticing the effect it was having on you. Careful not with his words and tone. Speaks with more understanding and compassion. \"Violet, you know what happened it wasn't you. You're not a bad person,\" tears began to stream down. Times like this Damian wished to be there. To see you cry because of...of the horrible...it angered him as well. Hearing you being used, it hard enough on you with your powers, you've been working so hard with them. Your rooted insecurities you did your best to overcome, to have everything come falling down. He wasn't sure really what words he could say. All he knew was he needed to be by your side, he always was. Just as you were with him. It ached being unable to. Taking a deep breath he opens his mouth to speak when a knock came to your door. \"Hey, Vi, it's me.\" John said on the other side. Your head lifted, you and Damian stare at the door. \"I believe you should get that.\" He smiles a little. \"We'll talk later.\" You nod nervously. It was hard for him not to chuckle. \"You'll be fine.\" His words calmed you. A smile came, you look back finding him smiling back too. \"Okay.\" With a few more seconds, together you both sign off. \"Come in.\" You tell John, he opens the door. There was something heavy about him, you could feel it and see it on his face. He was nervous. His eyes kept looking and moving around. \"Vi, look...\"he starts. \"I think we need to talk. About..\" he gestures between you and him. \"Is your little boyfriend gone?\" Referring about Damian. You nod. \"Good. Well,\" he walks in and sits on your bed. His eyes remained to the floor, a heavy sigh fills the silence in the room. You wait patiently for him to collect himself. He ran his fingers through his hair, and rubbed his neck. The bottom of his lips trembled. This was hard...it was a struggle for him. Normally he'd have something to say, it came easy. He takes a deep breath a few more times before starting. \"Violet,\" his eyes move from the floor to you. Locking with them. \"I want you to know something, okay? About what Ritchie said, about you, you're not my Sin Eater. You never were.\" You weren't sure why your heart dropped. He clears it up. \"Look, when I was younger...after what happened at Newcastle, well...I was in a dark place. My guilt was heavier than I thought and well...I seeked a way out. Which is how I meet your mother, she sensed it in me. She offered me redemption. I took it, without giving it a second thought. She told me it would involve cleansing from a higher demon of Hell.\" You knew who he was talking about. \"So, I took it. Demons can take away sins, so I was told. I signed away and well, one thing led to another. I became the vessel, your convincement wasn't out of malice. I know that now. When I found out what deal I made, I was horrified.\" Your heart dropped again. \"I was horrified because..because..\"he bites his lip. \"I brought something so innocent into this world...to be tainted already. To bare my sins, to bare the sins of others. The mistakes I made, are not yours Violet. They aren't. They are mine and mine alone. I wanted you to live a life...better than my own.\" He shuts his eyes with a frustrated sigh, \"I'm soo sorry, for the life you were born into, because of me. I'm a crappy father, been one since day one. Selfish bastard I am. You never..you never asked for any of this...and I-I..\" \"Shhh...\"your arms wrap around him. \"Shhh...\" Burying your face into his hair. His body stiffens, then relaxes. His arms around their way around you. He was trying hard to hold back his tears, which was alright. You didn't mind. His words were enough. The two of you remained like that for what seem like hours. When it broke he stood up and placed a hand on your cheek. His eyes no longer filled with grief but with soften joy and pride. \"My baby girl,\" his thumb wipes away the single tear you shed. \"Ritchie was right, you are the best thing that has happened to me. You always have been. And...\" he sighs again. Sensing him about to say something you didn't want to hear beat him to it. \"John, I don't want to go yet.\" It surprised him and caught him off guard. \"I want to stay here with you, for a bit longer. If that's alright...\" He didn't know what to say, accept smile and nod. \"Yeah, of course you can.\" \"And...during our time together...I promise..I'll find away to were we both can be together despite our sins. You saved me, it's the least I can do for you...dad.\" John was speechless again, he leans down putting his forehead on yours. \"Alright. Luv.\" That is the end of Justice League Dark hope you liked it, I will end up doing Constantine City of Demons with Violet. Thank you all.[Chapter 54] So, this was London. Streets gray, skies gray or it could just be the weather. There seem to be fog everywhere really. The sides wet from the rain or the moisture in the air. People sure seem to wear a great deal of raincoats or that was just a thing. You weren't sure. This city was part of you, after all your father was born here. Lived here most of his life when he wasn't being a well...a jerk. But, that was him really. John Constantine. Man was always one really, a habit you wondered rubbed of on you. You wondered. Besides being a wet place, London sure seem rather smoggy. Or maybe it was just the part you were in, because it wasn't the most glamorous area really. Honestly, you wished to be back in the House. At least there it was warm, not saying you couldn't make it warm yourself. Then again it was best that you didn't. Because well, it just wouldn't be good. Hopping over a puddle mixed with something else, cling to the brown bag in your arms. You had to do a quick store run, some things you wanted. John allowed you to go, outside right? What was even stranger was the fact not many eyes were on you. It wasn't that you didn't have anything about you physically that made you stand out, like pointy ears. Chalk white skin, dark markings on your body, sharp teeth or tail. Or wild thick white hair. Yeah, you still had all that. It just wasn't shown, thanks to the glamor trick taught to you by Zatanna. A gift she gave you, so you could well..mingle. It was both a spell infused in an object. A silver bracelet with a single purple gem on it. It was enchanted, every time you wore, you had to speak the incantation. So it would work, which luckily you did and remembered. Managing to preform it on your first try a surprise to her. Considering the kind powers you had. Then again John had been trying to teach how to use magic, a different form of it so it wasn't that surprise. The glamor charm allowed you to look like well...a person. How you use to look before everything. It was great but some times you missed your real look. But, John told you it was best you do it when you go out so you would not bring attention. Physically, bring attention to yourself. Not just from humans, but others, which you attracted in other ways. But for the most part they stated away from you. Due to the blood that ran through your veins. Which you guessed was a good thing. Smiling at the thought, with pride. Those who came to challenge, knew better and feared you which was even better. Coming to a stop wait on the corner for the light to change. When your phone rang. Taking it out answer it, smiling. \"Damian. Hey.\" \"How's London?\" He asked. You cross the street. \"It's good, smoggy. But, good. Hard to believe this was where he grew up or maybe he grew up in a different part. I'm not sure. How are things with the-\" you hear him grunting and what sounded like blasting in the back. \"Damian? Where are you?\" Followed by a yell of fear and cracking of bone. Not to mention him panting. Hear a clean slice of metal. And another grunt from him. \"Out.\" He said nearly breathless. \"Just out, with the-\" \"Yo! Hey Vi!\" you hear Gar shout in the back with a howl. Right away you knew where he was and what he was doing. \"Damian? You're on a mission again aren't you?\" There was on answer just the sound of a struggle. He was on a mission and fighting. Why did he call you like this? It wasn't that you didn't mind, it was just well...not needed. But, that was Damian. Still nothing from his end, only the sound of engaging combat and shoots being fired. With hollering from Gar and cursing from Blue. You heard your sister, shouting at Gar. It made you smile hearing her voice. You missed her, you missed everyone greatly. And couldn't wait to see them again. But, right now you wanted to stay with John, with your father. After all he was in a way the only family you had and well...someone you had longed to meet. Despite his many...faults. Chuckling to yourself shaking your head, hang up. \"Damian...\" you softly say laughing again. Feel a ominous shift, it was distant but strong. Your tail stood on end and hissing snarl slipped between your lips. It drew you, and you were ready to respond. Stop when your phone vibrated. A text. Taking it out see it was two. One from Gar and the other from John. Opening Gar's see a selfie of everyone with their victory smiles. A text at the bottom: Miss you! Smiling reply back quickly and open John's. It was urgent. Looking around quickly see an alley way and slip in, double check making sure no one was around and call upon your flames vanish away. In a second you were standing before a pub. \"Why am I not, surprise.\" You mutter to yourself with an eye roll. This was the an urgency. \"He had better not have gotten himself...\" you groan at the mere thought. If he was drunk and hung over again, unable to pay the tab and needed you to bail him out, there was going to be Hell to pay! Both literally and figuratively. Calming your rising temper, mutter an incantation that caused your charm to glow, walk inside. The bartender look at the female red-head who entered, making sure they were of the right age. She looked about twenty dressed like an simple black shirt with shorts and heels, catching the eye of a few. What was more surprising was who she sat by. She headed straight to the booth that held two men and casually sat down. She sat by the scruffy looking blonde in the long trench coat, the one sitting across, the brunet and more kept one was stunned for a moment. He dribbled a bit when he talked. \"Well...umm...\" He stammers. A waitress comes over to take the woman's drink order, right away the blonde ushered her away. The red head just laughed earning a scowl from the blonde. Not sure what was going, leave them be. John waited till his daughter stopped laughing. \"Are you done?\" You give a few more chuckles and nod. \"Yeah, sorry. It's just funny.\" The man sitting across from John and you wasn't sure what was going on between his friend and this attractive red head that clearly knew John, how he had an idea. But, it was just the way she looked at him wasn't like any way his others would. It was different, almost child like a bit. Enjoy poking fun at John, who clearly wasn't thrilled. In fact he seem annoyed, sternly annoyed, like a father. And the way John spoke was with a scolding and warning tone. \"Um,\" the other man interrupts the two. Their heads turn to him. \"So, umm, John who is..who is this?\" John quickly glances back the red-head and casually answers. \"My daughter, Chas.\" Who nearly spit his drink out. \"What? What did you say?\" This red-head was his...calculating the years in his mind. They just didn't add up, no matter how much he tried. So John further explains. \"What you see isn't my actually daughter. No. She's just using a charm. A glamour charm, it's the only way she can come into places like this an-\" \"And bail him out when he's had too much to drink.\" You spit out with a cheeky smile hidden behind your hands, avert your eyes from the burning ones John had on you. Instead look to Chas and hold up your charm. \"See? This is my charm.\" Chas was still trying to follow, why you would need a charm, well he understood why you needed it here. But, why did you actually need one and better yet how you became John's daughter. Where you adopted. A question John saw in his friend's eyes. \"Nope. Flesh and bone. True and true.\" Chas looks to you, you nod conforming it. There was still more that Chas wanted to know, but it wasn't the time. Picking up on his distress, smelling it like honey. \"Something's wrong.\" you lock eyes with him. He was amazed for a minute, then frighten the next from what came out your mouth next. \"Your distress and worry would no doubt be delicious to eat, not the ripest of the berries if you ask me. But, none the less a sustainable meal.\" You lick your lips. Chas looks to John, who remained calm scratching the back of his head. \"Sorry about that, girl's got a nose for the good stuff. She doesn't mean anything by it. Now, about you.\" \"What weighs on your heart?\" you interject again ominously. With a tinge of hunger, some of your features slowly began to show. Like your fangs and claws. \"Come now! Tell me! I wish to know!\" Chas moves back from the ear to ear smile you had. \"Jo-John.\" There was something odd with you, this heavy presence that just seem to leak out and entangle him. He could feel whatever it was burrowing itself in, picking at it. \"Alright! Enough!\" John cuts in, cutting off the connection. Snapping both Chas and you out of it. \"W-What happened?\" you asked shaking your head. Realizing right away what happened, stare down ashamed. Cursing yourself. \"So-sorry.\" you mutter. John draws a sharp breath, raising a hand rest it upon your back patting it in a circular motion. \"It's alright, luv. It's alright.\" This was a side of John Chas hadn't seen, maybe...perhaps. The affection John held in his eyes to you and how soft his tone was, and the way he pulled you in to comfort you. The tighten squeeze was just like any father. It was squeeze that tried its best to prevent any tears from falling, the squeeze that was strong to hold up a child. He saw the tears misting in your eyes. That you tried to fight back. Seeing this, Chas thought of his own. After a few moments you stopped and seem to be fine. Sitting up straight look to Chas and smile give a nod. \"Hello, my name is Violet. Violet Emma Greyson-Constatine.\" Sorry for the long wait, hope you enjoyed it. :)[Chapter 55] LONDAN HOSPTIAL Out of all the many places to come and be, it was here. A place fully of sick, needy, and slipping people or souls at Death's door. Whichever, it had to be here. Then again it wasn't much a surprise really, considering what Chase said about his daughter on the ride over here (Dad wouldn't allow you fireport or hellport. Last thing he needed was for you to...well it didn't matter)….on his daughter Trish's condition. It made common sense to bring a...non magical (human) well not those who couldn't sense or see or really use magic. Some humans could like your gritty of a man...father. John. Anyway, it was here Chas's eight year old daughter laid or rested in a deep coma. Her mother (not a fan of John as you noticed by the dark look she gave him.) She was surprised for moment taking a break from her worry hearing about you. Gave you a double take, wondering how. Which was fine, though unneeded. She seem more stunned by your appearance...actual appearance. After you let the glamor down. Her eyes seem taken by your tail and pointed teeth. It oozed with the stench of foulness. You could see the disgusting and yet delicious elixir leaking out the cracks of Trish's room. Like a thick miasma. Crouching down take a whim, a long deep one. How delicious...a slight bit of drool slipped out from the corner of your lips. Quickly you wipe it away, but that didn't stop your thirst for it. So much revolting...repulse...where was it coming from? Because whoever it was...or this was well...wait...a chill. There was a chill...dark cold chill that even tingled your spine and finger tips. Withdrew your hand quickly. This was dark...very dark, minor in your mind. Well...sort of. A low growl rises from your throat, bare your teeth with a slight hiss. Chas talking to John noticed and pointed it out. \"Is she okay?\" John turns around and sighs. \"Yeah.\" He sighs and snaps his fingers. Muttering something in Latin. Instantly whatever it was with you, went away. \"There. Hey,\" he said to you, walking over. Turning around his hand comes down on your head. \"Ya can't just..control it, alright?\" \"I did!\" you snap back shoving his hand away. Turn back to the door, steadily looking. \"There's just something...\"Narrow your eyes. \"I don't know what it is...but..there's something, else here. They'd make a wonderful meal for me-\" Renee gasp. \"Meal?\" Realizing what you said and what slipped out quickly turn around to her and smile, though your pointy smile didn't help really. Not even your words. \"By meal...I mean...umm..you see. I kind of enjoy the taste of...\" John quickly covers your mouth. Hushing you. \"Ignore her. She should know better than to discuss her diet. We're still working on that. Now,\" he lets you go though gives you a warning look. Walks to the door. \"I'll go see what I can do. And you,\" he turns to you sternly. \"Stay out here. I mean it!\" \"Why? You need me.\" \"I need you to stay out here, that's what I need you to do.\" That wasn't fair, not at all. Grinding your teeth that bared at him. His eyes stared harder. Chas and Renee stood watching the battle between...father and daughter. From a certain angle the two had similar scowls and glares. Glares that masked their own worry. John wasn't going to go in without and he wasn't going to let you come. No matter how much your flames flared. Chas and Renee had to move back unless be come charred. Luckily the flames didn't. Lights started to flicker on and off. And a wailing sound started to arise. Neither Chas of Renee knew what was going on. But, it was quite clear who the conduit was. Stepping to John, he stepped back raising a hand. With a stern finger at you. \"I mean it. You're not coming.\" So this was Trish, you look down at her, hooked up medical equipment. She was young, at least eight maybe. Brown hair like her mum. Innocents...was there but...not really. There was something hollow and draining. A feeling of trap and fear. Waving a flamed hand over her, Chas nearly freaked but you assured him it was alright. Also that you wouldn't burn her, the flames only ate what you wanted and deliciously sinful. Trish had neither. Needing concretion John asked him to leave. You remained lingered over her, there was something...reaching out touch her hand. Pull it back. What was that...that you just. Why was..touching the corner of your eye feel something wet. A tear. What was this tear? What was..your eyes linger on the door feel them start to sting. Cast them back to Trish, though stop on John for a moment you thought you saw a pained expression cross his face. Maybe it was just your eyes. \"Well?\" He asked breaking the silence. You look to him then back to Trish. Unsure what to say really, cause no matter what you wanted to, your eyes just...kept stinging. Sighing John takes over and takes a look inside Trish's aura. You already knew it was tainted. So John tried another way, curious as to what it was tainted with or by tries to open it, backfires. There was a strong hold preventing it. If that wasn't enough, whatever it was that had its claws in Trish surfaces changing her appearance to a sort of demonic one. Speaking in a language that was not English, opens her mouth and swarm of insects fly out. Quickly you duck as they burn away instantly. John stood bewildered. It took him a second to gather himself seeing the severity. \"Renee, Chas,\" he said opening the door, pushing you out into the hall. \"I'm going to need more than five minutes.\" Shuts it before you could object. Hissing turn around and pound on the door. \"Hey! Hey! Come on, open up!\" You grab the door knob to be shocked back. Damn, he put a spell on it. What was he doing in there? Raising your fist to pound again this time with fire, stop when this presence, dark not malevolent presence swept over the hospital. It was cold, yet tonic. It was demonic, but not one that was worth your attention. It seem...neutral. Releasing the knob take a few steps back. There was something going on in that room, calming down hold out a hand. Clear your mind find the words, speak them. From the tips of your finger a spark and crackle came, the knob outlined in dark flames turned and unlocked. The spell was broken. Seeing this Chas and Renee rush in, nearly pushing you aside. Grunting pick yourself up and follow. Trish was fine, that was good. Just you wondered who this woman was..correction demon in human disguise was. Wearing a tight short purple dress, she had pale skin. Full lips, sharp dark eyes and red bob cut hair. With a small nurse hat. A board expression on her face. That clearly spoke, she didn't want to be here. Feeling your eyes, she meets them. For a moment they gasp. \"Who are you?\" you asked. \"Asa. I can't believe it.\" She said amused crossing her arms. With an arched brow. \"I thought it was...who would have thought it was true. The one and only daughter of John Constatine. \" She leans in closer cupping your face. Her eyes etching every bit of you. \"An actual Sin Eater. Well, it makes sense.\" That name...made your heart fall. \"My name isn't Sin Eater.\" You move her hand away. \"It's Violet.\" She smirked. \"Everyone has another name, for a reason.\" \"Yeah?\" Your eyes narrow. \"What's yours?\" \"Nightmare Nurse.\" Her eyes remained lingered on you. \"Yeah, I can see how your his kid alright.\" You where about to say something, stop when you over hear John talking and telling Chas he was going to Los Angles. Wanting to know why, noticing something engraved in flames outside. Walking over see an address. \"1247 Enstrom L.A.?\"[Chapter 56] You hated being here, in this..this...place...this... Hospitals. It wasn't the needles or surgical tools really, though a bit not much, it was the fact that the whole freaking place was buffet waiting for you to devour it. It was near agonizing not to react, the mummers and whispers of so many...dark and abyss thoughts and secrets many kept to themselves. Of all they had done. Especially those who neared death...the sercets they craved to speak but lacked the energy to do so, only rose the hunger inside. Licking your lips wasn't going to satisfy you at all...so you had to do the next best thing... Vending Machine. Well, the one that surived coffee at least. The rest of that..that junk food wasn't going to do it for you, you needed something strong and hard that could wipe the taste away from anyone or anything the mind set its desire on. A nice cup or two of dark, very dark roasted coffee the smell of it was strong enough to put hair a person's chest, for you it settled your cravings. Since their was no chamomile tea around, something Raven insisted you drink to help you, this would have to do. Or a remedy that Black Orchid would make, this stuff was fine. Cheap, but fine none the less. Staring into the dark liquid, make your way back to Trish's room. Where you had to be..had to stay. John ordered you too. Trying to exhort his...father power over you. With a threat behind it the look he gave and the words he said. Warning was more like it, to make matter's worse he charged Nightmare Nurse to be your handler or in your eyes babysitter. None of which you needed, considering you were teen and need none of that. Not to mention of the right age, that John described as 'Having a mouth and no mind'. Something you didn't see, sighing, take a sip of the dark roast liquid. Unfazed by its potent taste, in fact you couldn't help but smile from it a bit. Licking your lips just a bit to get a more of it. Those whom you passed in the hall, would cast their eyes towards you with a raised brow. It was natural really, as expected, your eyes would slide to them and wink back. They'd quickly turn their head, some would have prickles of pink powder their cheeks. It was hard not to laugh, this glamour charm Zatana gave you worked so well. Stopping for a moment look at your reflection in one of the corner round mirrors. A young woman with chocolate eyes stared back, instead of your normal long white thick, unruly at times hair flowing behind you, it was replaced by dark brown. Is what everyone saw and yourself included unless you put the glamour down. That was would happen only in the presence of John, yourself or back in the house. Oh and with the Titans and Dick, anyone you felt comfortable with. Well, okay most of the time you had it down, only put it up if John told you. So most of the time you didn't need it. But, you enjoyed the gift from Zatana, you wondered how she was doing. With another sip, you head back to Trish's room. Humming to yourself, reach the room and go in. Trish was still in her...deep coma, a magical barrier surrounded her body keeping it safe. While her soul...remained in the cold..dark and horrid place. Quietly you enter, Renee remained by her daughter's side, eyes tired from tears she's shed. The poor woman's face was heavy with exhaustion, the bags under her eyes must weigh a ton...or so you believed and felt. What really held your attention, the way Renee held Trish's hand in a way...that you could not really place it. It was tender...loving...warm...the way Renee stroked her daughter's cheek softly...lifted your hand to your own. And touched it lightly. It was not the same...was that a mother's touch? You wondered? What was a mother's touch? You question, what was a mother's love? To be touched in such away as Trish...to have such a feeling twist inside you...you couldn't really understand...this feeling...that ached inside...what was it? You weren't bleeding but it felt like it. From where she stood Nightmare Nurse's eyes studied the Sin Eater...correction Violet. It was hard to believe that girl...was the daughter of John. There seem to little resemblance. Well, she did seem to have his nose and that distant..long distant gaze held in her eyes that yearned for what was taken. Studying further, the girl did have his strong jaw. Other than that, there wasn't much that could make the two of them seem related, but there was no mistaking it, Violet's magical imprint was similar to her father's wavelength...in ways. Just more..demonic. To bring a Sin Eater into the world...was…\"Coffee?\" Nightmare Nurse said. Looking to the cup in your hand. Renee's attention lifted from her daughter to you, with whatever strength she had welcomed you back with a smile. A tired one, but it was there. \"Violet, did you have enough money?\" Her question surprised you, her tone was considerate and soft. Sifting your eyes all around, nod feebly. Filling your mouth with the drink. Walk over to Trish's bed, look down at the girl. Wave a hand over, Nightmare Nurse stood the moment you did it. Earned a grunt from you, seeing you weren't going to do anything. She sat back down. \"You know,\" Renee broke the silence,\"it's still a shock. John having a child.\" Your eyes lift to hers. Shrug. \"I suppose, umm, yeah. I mean I've gotten use to it.\" Trail off to the side, mumble something under your breath that rose Nightmare Nurse's attention. \"I was surprised, he actually had any friends really.\" Renee laughed a bit, you joined for a moment. \"Yes, I'm quite sure. John from what Chas told me isn't one to be, well, close to many if any. But, to see you with him, shows some sort of change. After New Castle...\" New Castle, you often wondered about that...a few times you heard it brought up. But John never told you about it, but you felt the heaviness within him...though as delicious as it was, you never acted upon it. Feeling you'd might get sick if you did (but you wanted to for his sake, so he could...be free..). Eventually...hopefully he'd tell you or something. From New Castel...whatever he did, you were created...born. That was it...despite he affirmation that it wasn't true...stare at your shaking hands. Swallow...whisper...his name...you promised...promised to be with him...to... To not really ask any questions, but Chas couldn't help it on the plane ride to L.A.. Knowing John told him not to bother, it was hard after finding out your closest friend after so many years tells you they have a child. Feeling Chas's prying eyes, John sighed. \"What?\" Feeling that was the okay, Chas asked. \"A daughter...huh?\" Damn it. John cursed. \"Yes..\"he dragged out. \"A daughter, I thought I told you not to talk about that. We've covered it already.\" \"Not really,\"Chas stated. \"After all these years, you've had a daughter. I'm just surprised is all, still is, but at the same time..\"His tone became lighter and tender, reached over and took out the folded picture of his daughter he placed in John's jacket pocket. Mooning over it. \"I'm glad.\" John turned with a dropped brow. Chas kept gazing at the picture of his child. \"Why?\" John asked. \"Because,\" Chas began, \"we both have something that changed our lives. Made them better.\" John scoffed to the side. Chas chuckled softly. \"Yeah, they can be a hand full and temperamental.\" \"You have no idea,\" John whispered to the side. With an eye roll. \"But, in the end, we'd do anything for them. I know I would.\" Strong words, that gave John a thought. \"...If you're trying to make this some sort of bonding moment..\"He turned to Chas. Who's smile didn't deny it. \"Just something else we share together, if you think about it. She's a chip off you, you know that right?\" Again John rolled his eyes. \"Don't flatter yourself, she's far from any of my list of sins and I plan to keep it that way. Despite her pig headiness. I don't bloody don't know where in the world she gets it.\" Throwing up a hand. Wanting to say something, Chas kept it to himself and laughed inside. The scowl John made was nearly identical to Violet, it was nearly uncanny. And the way he sounded was...despite her not having an English accent. More American, the wording was there. Despite it all, Chas saw the underlining of the words and John's reasoning for keeping Violet back in London. \"Once this is all over,\" Chas turned to the window. \"I'd love for Trish to meet Violet, I'd think they'd like each other.\"[Chapter 57] Of all the places to be, you didn't expect it to be in this city...which was quite ironic considering your, lineage. But, it was where the address took you and where you felt (located) John. Los Angles, California. City of dreams. If one could call it that, you didn't see it much walking its dark, dirty, and gloom streets. Not that you had a issue with it, having been raised in it at the first few years of your life. This kind of area...you stop for a moment cast your eyes at the homeless upon the street...was once considered home. Back when you didn't know what that definition actually meant, not that you actually had one to begin with you. Until well, years later. Still, being on these streets ached a little..not your normal hunger aching, no, that was still there yes. This kind of ache was deeper, one you couldn't really understand no matter how much you tried all you knew was that it, it brought tears to your eyes. Tears filled with a heaviness you couldn't understand but..that it hurt. It ached. What was this feeling? A curious thought that stalled you for a moment, only shook when you remembered John, you came here to find him. Taking a breath, hold out a hand and in the center of your palm a small blackish flame formed. Holding another hand over it, use an incantation you learned from reading, watch the flame change from black to deep grey then back to black again. The small flame turned into a small will-o-wisp, floated from your hand zipped all around before deciding to go straight. It picked up John, good, ordering it to find him. It shot into the sky, producing your flamed wings follow it. Not caring that others just saw you, follow your tracker to John's location. Soar over the night life of the city. It was beautiful from your aerial view, so beautiful you thought for a moment you heard a sweet whisper speak your name. Almost angelic like, it echoed all around. Most prominent down below..in the city itself. Correction the city itself was speaking your name, made your skin crawl yet at the same time its voice seem to have a strange and oddly calming effect on you. Not sure why..but your eye lids slowly began to drop. Blinking slowly, John...you manage to remember...push yourself to move. Even if sluggish, you had to find John, your father. Yeah..your mind slowly starts slip, reach out a hand into the cool cold night air. You had to...had to find him...he was..he was, you slowly look around find nothing but slight clouded skies. That little flame ball...was gone? Where was the light? Where did it go? It was just here...it..was…..dropped out. You dropped out of the sky and plummet to the ground the below. Last thought that your mind called, Father... before your eyes closed on their own and everything went black. The same could said with John, or he slightly wished it would. But he was awake and conscience standing before the demon he managed to track down or better the one who in so many words invited him. Beroul. An large, overweight and disgusting demon with rotten-blistered skin, looked like a sewn together doll, stiches running all over the demon's body, thankful he had the decency to keep a red robe tied around him. Otherwise John was sure he didn't want to have a permanent image of the demon's body in his already messed up mind. The demon, the one who held, correction took Trish's soul luring John to him with a sort of proposition. One that John had not choice really but to except. Glad to hear, Beroul told the con-man what it was. A Hell on earth, in the very city. \"I what you Brits call a brainwave,\" he explained standing around his indoor rooting corpse pool. \"right here a franchise operation like fast food. But with the added benefit of eternal damnation. So many souls just begging to be corrupted and consumed. So much poor for a demon to absorb. The skies the limit for the entrepreneur.\" Beroul cracked his back a bit. \"But,\" he sighed. \"I've got competition. Five other demons with similar asperations and I want that competition eliminated.\" John rose a brow. \"And that's where I come in?\" He guessed, knowing already. The demon leaned down and smiled. \"Precisely.\" John's eyes shifted to the side for a moment, then back to Beroul's yellow ones. \"I won't do anything until I see the girl.\" \"Which one?\" \"Chas's Trish.\" Beroul chuckled deeply. \"Ah,\" he sighed. Slipping out of his slippers. Took a seat on the edge of the pool. \"Nothing more my kind savors than innocent soul.\" That wasn't an answer. \"Were is she?\" John kept his voice steady as he could. But his pained gaze said otherwise. \"Safe,\" Beroul answered. Hugging himself. \"right here.\" Chuckling darkly. \"You could say she's a prisoner of love. Held quite literally. Within my heart.\" Not to far hiding out in the hall, Chas heard everything, lost it. Came charging right out with a sword. \"Let her go, you bastard! Let her go!\" \"Chas no!\" John said, stepping between, held his enraged friend back. \"If what Beroul is saying is true, an attack on him is an attack on your daughter.\" \"But we don't know if that's true,\" Chas snapped back. \"do we?\" Pushed John away and rushed the demon, thrusting the sword. With a simple wave of his hand Beroul made him disappear. Disappear to the top of Griffith Observatory, frighten Chas looked around his surroundings. Realized how high up he was. Tried to calm himself down. Upset about it, John was about to say something, but Beroul assured him his friend was..safe in so many way. And that Chas wouldn't have hurt him anyway. Went to the matter at hand. \"Now, will you take the job?\" It wasn't really much of a choice, John gave it a quick thought. \"If I'm working for you, I want a fat salary, and swanky hotel.\" \"Done.\" Beroul agreed, walking off. Stopped for a moment a smile curled on his lips. \"This salary wouldn't happen to be for a collage fund? Now would it?\" He chuckled. \"It can be rather expensive.\" John's eyes widen, then narrowed hard. \"What did you say?\" The demon zipped his lips on anything further. \"Now, get out.\" He ordered. \"time for The Young and the Restless and I never miss it.\" Blaring sounds of car horns and hard brakes faded into silence. Everything was quiet, not even a pin drop made a sound...the only sound you heard, a soft breathing that sounded like a hum. Followed by a soft light stroking on your brow. That stopped and rested. Tapped the area a bit. A figure leans down close your ear... Whispered. Softly. You suddenly awoke, everything, every sound came flooding in like a crash. It nearly split your head, but luckily it didn't. Taking a few deep breaths calm yourself...slowly...refocus. Look for the core, Raven taught you that, after a few more breaths you were alright. Minus the slight still lingering headache, other than that right as rain. Slowly sit yourself up, find yourself...in the dark. It smelled foul..it felt cold and you reach out your arms..boxed? No, metal? You were in something metal? But what? Feeling around a few more times...realized where you were. A trash bin. Wonderful. Gross. Holding down your retching, stand and push the lip off, inhale the sort of fresh air. Fan yourself, felt your stomach flip and tighten, throw yourself half way over the side and let it all out. At least three times, before you were finished. \"...N-Not..cool...God, that was gross.\" you groan. Wipe your mouth, stagger up and hope out. \"Now, why was I hear?\" Give it a thought, you where here for some reason...but for what? Dig deeper, find nothing...\"Come on, there was a reason that I came here..but for-\"Close your eyes for a moment, see the reason why. A voice whispered in your ear, shot your eyes open. \"John!\" You remembered. That's right you came here for John, how could you forget. Recalling you arrived via teleporting (which took some...extra energy) to the city, the moment you arrived felt this strange...calming and holy presence, mixed with...heaviness of corruption. No that wasn't it...it was something else, something darker...sinister. Hellish. A sort of infestation, weak one or ones at that, except for...it was older and quite immense. Who it was, you weren't sure, but knew its presence shook a slight nerve in you. One that caused you to bare your fangs just a bit, feel a wave of calmness cover you. Followed by that voice, that same one, that soft voice that whispered in your ear. Its presence eased you in a certain strangeness. You refocused. John. You needed to find him, holding your hands out recite an incantation. A small mirror size swirl of black flames appear before you, dark veins appeared etched themselves across your arms. The flames flickered with a small heartbeat...concentrating you found them! \"Reveal.\" you command. The flames do as commanded and show you where you needed to go. A surprise really, but what choice did you have. Give a snap of the fingers, flames swallow you. Transported you to where you needed to be, the top of Griffith Observatory. The sight from here was beautiful. \"Violet?\" Chas exclaimed. \"W-What are you doing here?\" The sound of his voice, made you turn away from the view, he jerked back for a moment at the sight of you. Unusual sight of you, you picked up on it right away. Nothing new, it was understandable his reaction. He hadn't seen you like this before. The dark markings now on your face, dark black beady eyes. A demonic form you had little control over. But at least you weren't fully in it. Clearing your throat, close your eyes for a second, the markings fade and eyes turn back to normal. Open them and smirk, one that made Chas give a doubletake. \"Sorry, didn't meant to frighten you. Um,\" you look around. \"why are you up here? Actually, how did you get up here? Where's my father?\" Chas had his own question, mainly the first one he asked on how you came. Though he had an idea...sort of. John did tell him his daughter was...special, it showed. Going in the order of the questions you asked, answered them. \"I was transported up here.\" He growled. \"By the demon who has my daughter's soul.\" That surprised you. \"What!\" He nodded. \"I was going to attack that bastard, excuse me language,\" he apologized, you gave a shrug not caring. Waited for him to finish he did continued. \"he waved his hand and here I am. On top of this bloody place! Away from my little girl,\" his words wept with sadness and anger. \"my little Trish.\" The few tears that fell from his eyes, they weren't like tears Dick, they were filled with love like Dick's. But, there was something more behind them, in them. That ached something inside, yearned something inside. You wanted to know what it was, slowly reach out, stop, pull back. Your action didn't go unnoticed. Wiping the few tears away, Chas chuckled softly. \"Sorry, didn't mean to make you see a father cry.\" He apologized. \"That's alright, I've never had father umm...cry tears for me.\" You tell him. \"My cousin though, he has, but well...yeah. They are interesting tears. So,\" you clap your hands together. \"ready to get down?\" Chas was stunned at what he heard. Just looked at you. A look you felt, made you turn back to him. With a brow raised. \"What? Is everything okay? If you don't want to get down, we stay up here and look at the view.\" \"No, no,\" he said, trying to figure out the right words to say. \"That's not it. Not at all, it's just...umm..how can I put this really?\" Tapping his chin. \"What you said just now, about tears and fathers. That was well...\" Understanding now, smile shaking your head. \"It's alright. Really, I didn't mean for it come out like that. I was just speaking the truth. If it offended you in any-\" \"No! I mean,\" he cleared his throat. \"no it didn't just surprised me is all. Then again it shouldn't, John isn't the crying kind really.\" You couldn't agree more. \"Yeah, I know. Mister serious-grumpy-face, all the time.\" Laugh a bit. Tuck a bit of hair behind your ear. \"But,\" your laughter settles. Gaze across the city. Voice faded with it. \"it's alright. I know I'll never see those tears ever. I'm okay with, if I saw those tears then...that means something wrong and quite frankly I'd rather him not sure it. Even if he doesn't show much of anything,\" cast a smirk to Chas. \"we'll get Trish back. Don't worry, Mr. Chas.\" Give him a smile. \"Now, let's get you off this bloody roof.\" With a snap of your fingers, black flames surround the two of you, within seconds you had him on the lawn of the observatory. At that very moment, a car pulled up. The driver got, slammed the door hard, pointed a finger at you. \"What did I tell you?\" John chided, walking over. \"I told you to stay back in London, didn't I? So,\" his voice shaken with anger. \"tell me why you're not in London?\" You opened your mouth to tell him, closed deciding not too. Gave a shrug. \"I just didn't want to stay there any more. I don't need a babysitter. So, where are we going next?\" You asked eager smile and all. John shot a hand and grabbed you by the collar. Dragged you to the car. \"You're going nowhere. Now, get in and stay there.\" He tossed you in the back seat. Slammed the door. Placed a hand on handle, muttered something under his breath, a purple glow flashed. Realizing what he just did try to open the door find it locked and it shocked you. He put a spell on. One you clearly didn't know, you could melt the door then again that might cause a backfire. Grunting fold your arms, there was noting you could do, not even teleport out. Because some how this spell stunned it. Outside John smirked to himself, took out a cigarette, lite it and waited for Chas to come. Took a few puffs by the time his buddy stomped over. The of them bantered for a moment. One Chas wasn't really much in the mood for. Shoved John aside, opened the driver's door and got it. Shutting the door behind him. His face fell for a moment, the sadness was you didn't have to smell, it showed itself clear and well. Normally, you'd be tempted to with hunger for it, right now...there was a pit in your stomach. Which was weird. Still with his cigarette John gets in on the passenger side, his eyes flash hard at you. You turn chin with an eye roll. Mutter under your breath. Chas started the car up and drove off. It was quite on the road, well at least for you, the other two talked. While you remained board in the back, what you wouldn't give for a book or phone. Something. So to entertain yourself, form a small fire ball and toss it lightly back and forth in your hands. Stop only when John nipped at you to put it away or else, groaning you do as he said. Mutter under your breath again, get a warning from him to watch what comes out that mouth of yours, or else. So you sat in silence...again. With only John and Chas talking. Find out John has accepted a job from the demon Beroul, the one who had Trish's soul, to go and take out the competition. It was stupid in your eyes, but then you understood why, board you lean back across the seats. Start to close your eyes, feel a presence. A dark presence, sit up look out the back window. Spot in the distance running towards the car, hounds. Not any kind of hounds. No, these hounds had fire, they were hellhounds. \"H-hey,\" you reach back tapping John, \"hey, hey.\" He rolled you off. \"I don't want to hear it.\" That didn't stop you, you kept tapping him. \"Hey! Hey, listen. Somethin-\" John swatted your hand away. \"Violet, I said, I don't want to hear it!\" You kept going, this time shaking him by the shoulder. \"Just listen, there's something following the car!\" Having enough, John shifted the rearview mirror towards you, noticed in the reflection, what you where trying to tell him. \"Shit!\" Hi everyone just a thought once the City of Demons is done, would you like Violet to be in The Regine of Superman? Let know.[Chapter 58] This was nice, so soft..so fluffy it was hard not to curl up and snuggle. On the bed that is, after what happened on the road coming to a luxury hotel and high-end room was worth it. Even if it was from John's..boss or employer. Who set up the accommodations, it was all good. You couldn't stop curling up no matter how hard you tried, it was just so...nice. With the hellhounds that attacked out of nowhere to nearly getting eaten by them, this was a nice change of pace. What was even better there was a mini-fridge, cable, and the works. You nearly forgot the reason for being here and the attack. But, you remembered it, on the highway in car. The backseat, locked in thanks to John, board and bummed out of your mind. Every so often listening to Chas and John talk, a few times it caught your attention, but other that not really. With nothing to do, it was decided by yourself you'd just...well wait it out. Laid down in the back, closed your eyes for just a moment, fell a cold demonic presence rushing towards the car. Instantly you sprang up, turned your head towards the back window and saw them..the hellhounds a pack racing towards you. Quickly you alerted John, he eventually saw them. Before he could even react the hounds jumped the car, a few broke through the back window where you sat, snapping their sharp jaws at you. One managed to snag you by the collar, nearly pulled you out if Chas hadn't swerved hard, flung the hound off you. That didn't stop the others from snapping and gnarling, you managed to duck and avoid them. That didn't stop them from swiping their claws at you, more came tore at the car. Trying to run if off the highway, you fought back incinerating a few. One you just punched with fire, the rush was...thrilling you lavished in it...for a moment. A moment something surged through you, you weren't sure what but it was like a river of wholesome and light. It whispered in your ear and next thing you knew...there came a blinding light. A blinding light that caused burned your hands. But, you managed to get rid of a few hounds, at least. Though left yourself unable to help with the remaining ones. John reached back and snatched you to the front with him, though it was crapped, he kept in his hold with one hand while the other held a pipe swung at the creatures. It did nothing. The hounds began climbing on the car, started to ripe at the roof. Chas was panicking while trying to keep an eye on the road, but it was pointless. There was only way out, John saw it, told Chas to hit the breaks, he did as he was told. Hit the breaks hard at turn, swerved to the edge, tilting it halfway off the side of the cliff. It tottered for a moment and within that moment, Chas and John with you still being held, quickly scrambled out of the car before it fell completely off the side with hounds down below. Killing them. Or so everyone thought, more came running moments after, twice more. John had grabbed and threw you on his back ran with Chas. You still were in no condition to do anything. Your hands still hurt, the sizzling had some what stopped. The hounds close on their heels, they could feel their flames. Despite your condition, you had held out a hand and tried to recite something...even tried to use your flames but..nothing came. Nothing at all. Even when you forced yourself, it some how backfired and pain shot up your arms like fire. You almost, let go of John. Who snapped at you to stop and let him handle it. Enough with the running, he stopped told Chas to take you, which he did. Standing his ground, John faced the heard of hounds while you weakly watched on...he recited a spell cast a wall of fire that formed into a holy angel guardian. Stopping the hounds from coming any further. It was only going to hold for so long, the flames started to settle after a seconds, John turned and started running. Chas followed with you still on his back. You lifted your head to see the flames lowering further and...something coming. It honked and drove up on the side of the wall, it was a car! A car? The driver came to the three of you and some how knew John or at least his name. It some sort of hipster driver, sunglasses and stripped tank top the works, he told everyone to get in. There was something odd about him...you weren't sure what it was but you felt it, as if you felt it before. Like that whisper. With no other choice as the wall of fire vanished, everyone piled in. Chas carefully put you in, hoped in the back with you, John took the front. With everyone in the driver stepped on the gas and speed off, not a second to late either. The hounds got through and charged, they didn't get close and stopped. That's pretty much what happened, despite the shitty driving the driver was doing while arguing with John who demanded to know how the driver knew his name. All of that wasn't important, at least not to you...what you where more concerned about was the moment the three of you arrived to this awesome hotel was what the driver did. He took your hands in his, something snapped John's brows up, the driver held your hands for a second and they...glowed for a moment or maybe it was your eyes, but you saw something. After that he let your hands go and you where snatched by the collar out the car by John, who had a hard deadly glare at the guy. Passed you on to Chas to take you inside, which he did. A few seconds after John came in and checked everyone in, headed to the room. Where you were now, snuggled on the bed and in the sheets. Tired, surprisingly, it had to be the bed. Whatever the reason you started to feel your eyes start to close when your phone vibrated with a familiar toon. One you knew well, sat up, took your phone out and read the name. A warm smile and flush on your cheeks, it was Damian, about to answer it for John to take the phone and ignore the call for you. You frown about to say something, he cut you taking your hands and observed them. \"How do they feel?\" he asked not looking at you. \"Fine.\" He nodded. \"Are you sure?\" He studied them more. You nodded. He didn't seem to be sold. \"Move your fingers,\" you do as he said. \"Make a fist, but, don't punch me.\" You do that too, everything he told you to do, you did. Everything was fine. Seeing that it was he gave you your hands back. It silent between you two, though you felt like John wanted to say something, the way the corner of his lips quivered and the frustrated sigh that slipped out. Chas who was on the phone walked over. \"Hey Vi, do you want something to eat?\" He asked in a chipper tone, pushing away the heavy silence. You to him and his smile. \"What do you like to eat? It's a hotel after all, can order anything you like, of course,\" he looked to John. \"if it's alright with your dad.\" John rolled his eyes and walked away, giving you back your phone. \"I'm going out, stay with Chas.\" He told you and Chas. \"I'll go with you,\" you jump up ready. John stopped. \"No.\" He said sharp and hard. \"You stay here with Chas,\" his voice returned back. \"order whatever you like.\" With those words he left, leaving you and Chas. It was like that for two days, John left you with Chas, he didn't take you with him and he wouldn't say why. But it was something, something deep...that left him edgy. It not prickly, it had to be you, because that was the only reason. If it was well, you some what apologized. Sighing, stare at your dark soda swirl the ice cubes around watching the carbonated bubbles pop a bit. Staying in this hotel for two days wasn't ideal, not that you had a problem with Chas, he was great it was just...well... \"Violet,\" Chas interrupted your thoughts, you look up he stood over you with a smile. A friendly one. You arched a brow. \"Yes?\" He sat down across from you on the floor. Looked behind him out the window. \"It's a nice day, do you want to go and do something?\" It was a nice day, you just weren't really in the mood for it, not when your mind still remained on John. Chas saw it, even if you tired to hide it. \"Naw, I'm okay.\" You respond. Take a sip of soda. \"Are you sure?\" He pushed leaning in a bit. \"You've been inside for nearly two days straight, we can go do something. Like,\" he gave it a thought. \"Go see a movie, take a nice stroll, eat some plac-\" You sigh. \"It's okay, you don't have to list off the things you and your daughter would do.\" The words accidently slip out. Realizing what you said, snap your head up at him. \"I'm so sorry, I didn't mean...I...\" Sadness rushed Chas's face, filled his eyes. Made your stomach fall. He chuckled softly to the side. Scratched the back of his neck, looked away from you. \"I-it's alright,\" he managed to force out. \"I know you didn't.\" Took a breath turned to you. With half smile and slight shrug. His eyes still held their sadness and worry. It only made your stomach knot further. \"It's true, those are things..\"he swallowed his cracking voice. \"I did with my Trish. We enjoyed doing them, every since she was little. Didn't mean to project that on you.\" You tuck some hair behind your ear. \"N-No, that's umm...okay. I'm..um..it..was..\"you fiddle with your straw. Clear your throat. Search for the right words. \"I just didn't want to..well..those are the things you and Trish do so, I just didn't want to...well impose on something special a father and daughter do.\" Chas chuckled a bit, looked to you. \"You're in no way imposing. I just thought I'd offer is all, you seem like you'd enjoy something like that. Doing fatherly daughterly things. Though I understand if you want to save that for John.\" Your mind shot up for someone reason. \"I don't think...well...\" you start to scratch the back of your neck, giving what he said a thought. A small smile appeared, then fell. \"I've done it before with my cousin, he would take me around and do things like that. So...\" Shrug your shoulders. \"it's alright.\" \"Well,\" Chas begins to counter. \"it's a bit different with a father and daughter. When they're done they become precious memories and times that are cherished and make the father see just how important and how much they love their daughter. They'd do anything for them, anything to see their beautiful smile that will forever be engraved in minds. See how their daughter's eyes lite up, that will just melt your heart and soul.\" He spoke beautifully, you almost became lost in his words. \"Oh, well, that sounds nice. Trish is very lucky to have experienced that.\" \"You make is sound like you'll never experience it.\" Chas rose a brow to you. You shrugged. Taking a sip of soda. \"Despite how John may seem, clearly you two are nearly the same,\" he muttered that part to the side. \"I have a feeling he'd enjoy doing those things with you an-\" \"Ice-cream.\" you said. \"What?\" You repeat. \"Ice-cream.\" Meet his eyes. \"I'd like to have...well...\" your voice drops to the side. \"I'd like to have ice-cream with..him. Sit on a park bench and have some. I've seen it in movies and television shows. The father and daughter would spend a day together end it with just sitting on a bench with ice-cream. That would be nice.\" Chas was taken by this, he saw the yearning in your eyes. For a moment. \"Well, that's sounds nice.\" Chas smiled. \"I'm sure you'll do it.\" \"I hope so,\" you smile to yourself. \"Even if...even if it was the last thing we did together. That would be nice. I can get some sort of understanding about my dad. Just us, nothing bad happening. Just the two of us.\" There was more in your words, Chas noticed. \"That's why you came isn't it?\" He guessed, you nodded. He smirked to himself. Leaned back a bit. \"You're like your ol'man in many ways. You both have such good hearts.\" \"Just no souls,\" you joke though it rang true. Chas's smile fell slightly. \"You're right on that.\" Another hush of silence filled the room. You needed to ask, you wanted to..felt it building up inside. \"Mr. Chas,\" your voice lowered a bit. The same with your eyes. \"could you...possibly tell me...about New Castle?\"[Chapter 59] This was going tobe tricky, just a bit, you hadn't done anything quite like this before. Read up about it, yes. Tried not..really, maybe once or twice with those lesser on the power poll. this one though...you now understood why you felt such a powerful demonic presence, this one was massive. Not enormous as Trigon, but it was powerful. Sitting quietly by yourself in your room, door closed and locked. You made sure, told Chas you just wanted to rest your head, set yourself up. Conjured up about six black candles circled around you, with a snap ignited the wicks of each of them. Take a deep breath, remember the training and readings you done so far. Doing something like this could really...really pull you under...to that side. It could take you over, so you needed to make sure you had some sort of anchor. Like Raven told you many times, over and over again. To help not give into that side despite how much you wanted too. Holding your breath, slowly let it out. You had to make sure you held no fear..no nothing. You couldn't be detected or be known by this...demon. This shackle that held John, you knew now. Chas told you all you needed to know. This was what tainted John's sin, what oozed out. You promised you'd free him and you would. But, first you needed to see who this Nergal was. Holding out a hand, sit lotus style, close your eyes, speak a chant...began to engulf yourself in your flames. Hold your hands out, the fire moves there and levitates before you. Swirling, markings of Trigon start to glow. You kept it up, pushed harder and harder. Recite the correct chant over and over again in a different tongue. The flames of the candles grew each time the chant left your mouth. Slowly started to levitate off the ground, just about an inch or two. The flames swirling before expand and create some what of a mirror, flamed mirror. Images of different faces both human and demonic alike appeared. Each one went by in a flash. None of them where whom you searched for, at first it was low level...then...came those on the next power level. You hadn't broken a sweat...yet, smirk to yourself how well you were doing. Focus back. Chanting harder than before, the harder you chanted the more ignited the flames of the candles became, the chiller the soft wailing winds became and deeper your markings glowed and more demonic you became in your appearance. Hunger slowly started to sweep its way in you, but you pushed it down. Hanging onto the anchor that kept you...sane. Casting those mild demons aside, their powers nothing compared to your own...if not controlled. On to the next level...how did John make doing this so easy? Pushing further through, come to where you needed to be. It surged through you like a fire, you had to hold back from screaming. Snap your eyes open just as Nergal's face appeared before you. A huge sinister smile on his lips. Red eyes of the demand and twisted so cold it made ice feel warm. Struck your blood cold...and this overwhelming...power from him sizzled your skin. As if he was here...and the way his eyes locked with your despite being nothing more than a image sunk to your very core...you shouldn't feel this way, having endured hell with Trigon...yet you did. Your body trembled in a cold shiver, you nearly lost the ability to breath. Scratching at throat as if Nergal himself was straggling you like some helpless kitten. Screaming wasn't an option if you couldn't do it. You had to cut it! You had to do it fast or...or risk...no! You refused, you couldn't, not until you fixed it! Fixed it all! So...so everything would be alright, you promised that you would, that's why you stayed with him. Cleanse it all, so he could be free. So...so things could be, okay. Be wonderful and...and...the grip tightened. You began to feel light headed...a dark throated chuckle echoed in your ears. It was Nergal! There was no doubt, it was that foul demon. His brimstone breath you could smell with the foul stench of rotten human flesh and remains soaked in it. Your stomach almost rolled over, but you held it down, more like swallowed it. You continued to hear his chuckles, that rose goosebumps on your skin, but you remained stoned and unfazed. Something he seem to find interesting, lifted you up and took a close look at you. There was nothing before you, but you knew he was staring at you. Into your eyes. even felt him get a good whiff of you. So, he mused chuckling. You're Constantine's abomination, I mean, brat. An actual Sin Eater. My, my, he purred moving you closer, aren't you rather interesting. Sickening to look at, I sense powerful ancient blood that's tainted running through you. Corruption runs through your like a river, it overflows in you like the damned souls of Hell itself. Nothing but malice and reckoning oozes from you. Yet, he paused for a moment, you refuse. Tamed you've become. How disappointing. Itching to say something, couldn't, only focused on your breathing that slipped further and further away. Chuckling, Nergal slammed you to the floor, it rattled your room just a bit. What? Nothing to say, child? He mocked. Outside in the living room, John and Chas sat concluding their plan on taking the competition. Hear the rattling from your room. They look in the direction of your room, John rose a brow. \"Vi, what's going on in there?\" He called. There was no answer, Chas tried. \"Violet, sweetie,\" a name that made John drop his eyes to his friend. \"everything alright in there?\" There was no answer, John rose from his seat, called for you again. This time taking a step forward. \"Vi, Violet, what's going on?\" Still no response, John's eyes narrowed, something wasn't right, he could feel it. Hurried to the room. Calling your name over and over again, with Chas right behind. Back inside, Nergal still had you pinned down, heard John's frantic calls. Chuckled amused. Seems like daddy dearest is worried, he mocked with a deepening grin, better respond back. Oh, it seems you can't. So let me! He raised you up and slammed your body back to the floor. Pain shot up your spin. You held it in, showing him any sort of sign...would just ruin it all. That didn't stop the demon from seeing the simmering pain in your eyes. He leaned closer. Listen closely Sin Eater, your father bastard of a father tried me and now you. You're motives both ridiculous as it was entertaining. You can't with me as he wasn't able too, you try coming at me again, I promise you, I'll take it all away. Understand? He whispered. John using his shoulder burst the door opened, nearly stumbled in, looked around found you on the floor. He saw the candles everything and knew what it was you did, upset he was. But, now wasn't the time, raced over and dropped to your side. Looked you over carefully, Chas walked over and rest a hand on John's shoulder. There was a dark red hand print around your throat, a large one. The sound of soft sizzle came from your skin, clearly something supernatural...demonic maybe. Whatever it, John bit down his rising anger. Slowly scooped your body in his arms, caused you to wince, he stopped. Watched you curl slightly in his arms from the pain and whimper softly. A single tear ran down your cheek, feel onto his hand. Something took hold of John's heart, gripped it tighter than a snake. He wanted to stay mad at you but...he couldn't. Even with his calm, stoic look Chas saw the fury in John's eyes that screamed. Yet remained soft at the same time, the eyes of a father. Opening to his mouth to say something, Chas didn't. Carefully, very carefully this time John lifted you apologizing softly to you for the extra pain he was causing. Walked slowly over to your bed and laid you on the mattress. Asking Chas to get extra pillows, to help ease you. Chas did that and came back with some. John set them around you. Covered you with the covers. Put a hand over you, recited something a faint golden glow outlined you. Not the best healing spell but it would. For now. \"Bloody girl,\" he grunted softly. Covered you more. Stayed over you for a few more minutes, when pain became less on your face he left with Chas. Who shut the door softly. It was quiet, not a single sound, but a visitor did emerge from the shadows of your room. They...she walked over to you and sat on your bed. Gently caressed your cheek. \"So,\" she whispered softly. \"you've come here. I'm surprised, now then,\" she leaned close rested her forehead to yours. \"let's talk.\" ","Summary":" Name:Violet Greyson Age:11 Height:4'8 Family:Bruce Wayne(ward), Alfred Pennysworth(caretaker), and "}]
