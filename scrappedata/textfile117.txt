In this universe the god Tooran ruled with great power but he wasn't alone, the goddess Kiara ruled over the light. Of course, these two were enemies and they began to fight .Over the millennia they suffered great injuries and from their blood the world of Neckria was born. The large chunks of flesh, cut from their bodies from the fight sunk to Neckria and formed the landmass. The tears of the gods formed the oceans. When the gods saw what they had done, they started a truce and began to populate the world. The god of darkness made humans and the goddess of light created the elves. The humans were strong and worshipped the moon. The elves were beautiful creatures who were both stronger and faster than humans, so Tooran made up a new form of his race, the wolves, who were both as strong and fast as the elves. The goddess didn't like that and so began the great war. This war has been going on for thousands of years and is still raging on. From the elf side Hunters were born to hunt down the wolves and kill them. From the human side the wolves grew larger, as big as horses. And in this war one called Gabriel is very important and that's why I'm telling you his story. Chapter 1 Gabriel was running like hell towards his house, at his right side he saw the river. He looked up towards the sky and again he saw the smoke, the moment he saw it he knew. It was his house that was burning. 'NO!', he thought, 'this can't be true. FATHER! Are you alright?' Only then he saw the two dark figures standing on the edge of the wood. 'Gabriel, run they are the hunters that I told you about!' With a flash Gabriel came back to reality. When he was fully awake he started to remember what happened. He was hunting in the woods. It was a beautiful day, nice and warm but not too sunny. He hoped that it would have rained that day, it would have stopped the fire from spreading in his house. But still he wondered why. In god's name, why? The Hunters killed his parents. He was very lucky to be alive because one hunter had chased him, but didn't kill him when he had the chance. Bowen was excited, finally he had the chance to end the war in this part of The Island, the heart of Neckria. The wolf was quick but he was one of the oldest hunters in the world. He had known thousands of wolves and he had killed almost all of them, following the orders of The Great King: Ragnall. And now he was chasing one of the last wolves. It was a beautiful creature though, it was almost completely black only with a white spot at the end of its tale. But that doesn't matter , he thought and he began running faster to catch up with his prey. The wolf was now resting, thinking he was safe. It wasn't safe though, Bowen was lurking behind a tree. It wasn't hard to loaded because the goddess Kiara had gifted him with super strength and speed as a hunter and he was very grateful for that. Otherwise he would've been instantly discovered by the wolf. 'Come to pappa', he said and then he shot his arrow but he had underestimated the wolf. With a great leap it disappeared into the woods. Bowen cursed, he didn't expect that move. 'This is going to be so much fun!', he shouted, then he jumped up and started to chase the creature but it wasn't easy. This wolf was faster than any wolf he had killed. Either that or I'm getting too old for this , he thought. But with a laugh he rejected that thought and then the wolf was gone! 'No way!', he shouted. His scent, his track, everything was gone. In all his career he'd never missed a prey and now only at the end of the hunt he'd lost his prey. 'Incredible', he muttered. This wasn't normal and how the hell was he going to explain this to his king! When Gabriel finally awoke fully, he realised he was still in the cave were he had been hiding from the hunter. He was very lucky and he realized that. 'What do I have to do now?', he wondered. He knew he had to go to the Dark Shade... He knew where The Dark Shade was, but still it was a dangerous journey. He had to pass through extremely dark land, the land of the hunters. 'Well, to the Shade it is then', he said with a sigh. And then with a blur he began to change into his wolf form. His perfect creature, as he liked to call it. And when he changed, his whole world changed with him. Everything began to sharpen, every sent, every glance. Even after a year it was still amazing to change, he could feel the power and speed build up in his legs, he could see every creature from the squirrel in that tree to the ant farm a 100 yards away. It's just amazing, he thought but he had no time for this and then he began to run. Normally, with this speed the forest around him turned into a blur. But not in this form , he thought happily. The still remembered the first time he'd changed, it was on his 16th birthday, at first he couldn't believe what his father had said. 'It cannot be father! The wolves are not here anymore..' 'Yes, it can be, Gabriel. We are the last family in this part of the Island.' 'But how is that possible? I thought that the wolves, ergh... we were expelled from this side of the Island!' 'Yes, we were except for our family, and now we're going to change...' My father was a hard man when it came to training our skills. But soon it became clear that I had a talent for speed, even my father who was one of the oldest wolves, couldn't catch me! My father was proud of me because I was serious while practising. But still, it didn't matter anymore now... his father and mother were dead and he couldn't do anything about it. He stopped when it was dark and climbed on a cliff. He had a beautiful view of the surroundings from up there. It was a nice place to rest and he could see no harm in making a fire. He'd gotten pretty far, he couldn't even see his village anymore. It was a relief to see the flames and feel the warmth of the fire, he had caught some nice fish in a river a mile up north and he began to clean them. When he was finally done with this disgusting job, he baked them and ate them quickly. He couldn't stand sitting still, He missed his parents so much. He turned his head to the full moon and he felt encouraged in the thought that his parents were with the Great God Tooran and finally he fell asleep. He had a bad dream, and everytime he woke and fell asleep again he saw the same dream. He saw a black figure standing in front of flames and realized with a flash that it was his home. The figure watched and began to laugh... It was the most evil laugh he had ever heard, it even gave him goosebumps. He felt the anger grow inside of him and with a growl he shouted at the figure: 'Why?', he shouted. The person laughed at Gabriel's attempt to attack him and bounced away. 'How dare you, you DEMON! I will tear you to pieces!', Gabriel shouted again. He laughed and returned the attack with incredible force. Even Gabriel himself could not resist. And in that moment he knew he was the most stupid wolf mankind had ever seen! His own father perished so what could a 1 year old wolf do... ? He was only seventeen. And in flash he lay down with a knife on his throat. 'NO!', he yelled and then he woke up. And only moments later he felt the tears flow. His own father had sacrificed his life to protect him and he just threw it away. 'No', he said, 'first I'm going to the Dark Shade and learn to fight and then, when I'm ready, I'll have my revenge!

Note/Warning: I don't like this movie. I really don't. I love the book, I love the lessons and messages, I adore it. The movie completely misses/negates all of that. Had it tried to be its own thing, I could have appreciated it better. As it was, the thing I liked most about it was what I hated in the book - Astrid. Hence, this little ficlet. For Life There was a time when he would drop everything just to chase her through the woods. All she had to do was beckon him and run; he would always follow. There was a wolf under that skin, not a politician, not a bureaucrat – and she could always draw it out into the open. Astrid missed those days. She missed the sweet air of the woods, the thrill of the chase, the rush of her capture; he was intense and wild, not so safely restrained. She could affect him then, and that knowledge had kept her tail high and proud. Those days were long gone though. Gone forever, no matter how she tried to win back his affections – to just get them back for a short while. Sometimes he would come to her. Middle of the night, while the young were out and chasing skirts like tails, when his newest wife was asleep and alone; he would come to her. He would stay until just before the dawn, and she could almost glimpse that wolf buried underneath his politics. Almost. Those nights were fewer now; so far between. He came later, left sooner. As if afraid to let himself go even the slightest. Astrid knew that one day those nights would end completely. She knew that the time when he would finally make himself move on from her was not far off. She could see it in his eyes, feel it in the way he stopped himself from holding too tightly, kissing too hungrily, burying too deeply. She had given him a son. She had given him her soul. She had given him more than any of the others. Yet she was not good enough. She would lose him soon, and she would lose him to her own flesh and blood. It hurt, and it sickened her, but she would defend him, ache for him, and never, ever betray him. To him, she was an ex-wife that he sometimes missed. An ex-fling that part of him was still hung up on. To her, he was her mate, and a she-wolf mated for life. ","Summary":" Disclaimer: I do not own Blood and Chocolate nor its characters.

We believe in myths and legends, and that destiny awaits. That is the world I remember... The gun was in my hands, poised for the shot. The one shot that would end it all. I still felt weak, even though the Anti-AG had been working in my system for some time now. But I couldn't blame him. How was he to know me as a wolf? He had never seen me that way before, and as the rest of us were hunting him...no, I didn't blame him for stabbing me with that silver knife in the least. Besides when he did realize that it was me, he didn't kill me like most men, but helped me get to the pharmacy so I could get the medicine that would save me. A homo sapien helping a loup garou. Never had I heard of this before, a human standing by a werewolf, especially after he knew what I was. A snarl jostled me from my thoughts. \" Shoot him,\" I heard his voice from the wall. His lovely, delicious, human voice. There was too much blood, my eyes had changed before the rest of me, but I refused to change completely. Aiden saw me as a wolf once, he didn't need to be scarred for life by actually seeing me change into my animal form. \" I can't,\" I said. I couldn't shoot one of my own: there were too few of us left and he was married to my aunt! \" Shoot him!\" he said, his voice becoming more determined. \" I can't!\" I said again, clutching the gun until my knuckles turned white. But the wolf snarled again, turned, and leapt for him, the one I loved. NO! A gun fired and the wolf fell, the silver bullet grazing his belly. At first I didn't know it had been me, but I felt my finger tight on the trigger and saw the bullet come from my direction. I dropped the horrid mechanical creature of man and ran to him. I had done it. I killed Gabriel, the alpha of our pack. Now who would lead us? It certainly wasn't going to be me! I brushed his dead cheek with my hand. \" I'm sorry,\" I whispered. \"So sorry,\" I whispered again. \"Sorry about what?\" I heard a voice interrupt. I opened my eyes to see Aiden. The one I killed my leader for. No regrets, I kept telling myself. \"Nothing, dream,\" I was napping in the back seat of Aiden's car as we were driving. We weren't sure where to, but he wanted to go to Paris and I had no problem with that. I got up and looked out of the window. The moon was high and full in the sky and the stars were sparkling brightly. I stretched my legs and growled with pleasure. It was the perfect time to run. Especially when I took in the fact that we were in the middle of a barren country landscape. No one would see me change. Except Aiden, but I wasn't sure he cared anymore. He heard me growl and stopped the car. \"Vivian?\" he asked hesitantly. He turned around in the driver's seat, looked at me, and flinched. \"Is it my eyes?\" I asked calmly. He nodded. I looked down at myself and realized I was halfway through the transformation already. How could I have not noticed? I shut my eyes and shook my head, trying to tell him that I was still me, and not some bloodthirsty creature that was going to kill him. How would this ever work? \"You can control it,\" he told me for the fifth time that day. Now he sounded more like he was trying to convince himself. I nodded, and concentrated on my human form. When I saw him relax, I knew I was back to normal. Or at least, normal for him. He turned around and faced the road, but didn't start the ignition. He just sat there. \"Aiden, I'm fine. Like you said, I can control it.\" \"Yeah, but for how long?\" \"Aiden, I told you, I change for the running. I've never killed anyone, I swear!\" He just sighed. \"Especially not you. I would never kill you. I killed my leader to save you, and you doubt me?\" I asked. He looked at me with those sad eyes and I melted. I climbed over into the passenger seat, took his face in my hands and made him look at me. \"Please don't fear me. I'm just your girlfriend that can turn into a pet dog. Think of it that way, if it helps you,\" I said. He took my left hand down from his face and put it around his neck. I followed suit with my other hand, and soon I was swallowing his face with my kiss. He came into me, and I was reborn. His tongue pushed its way through, and I let it. I moved around, licking his face and earlobes like a puppy. He began gnawing at my neck, and I pulled away. \"Aiden,\" I warned. He looked at me boldly, as if he wanted to see my wild eyes now. I smiled, and fell back into him, rolling my eyes into the back of my head as he gave me love bites. Puppy bites to me, who had seen Gabriel and Astrid bite much more fiercely. But he was only a man, and could never give me the passion of a wolf. He was passionate enough, however, for I loved him and that was enough. I felt my eyes change, but I couldn't let the wolf in me take over. I wouldn't! His hand moved underneath my shirt, bare hands on bare back, and I shuddered. I wrapped my arms around his bare waist beneath his jeans, and when we finished kissing, we just sat there like that, my head resting on his shoulder, his head on top of mine. We were now sitting precariously in the passenger seat, seeing as sitting in the driver's seat would have presented problems with the wheel getting in our way. I was sitting on his lap, and my legs had somehow wrapped themselves around his waist with my hands. He suddenly broke the silence. \"Do you think we should start driving again?\" \"Can I stretch my legs first? I can't stand being cramped up in this car all the time,\" I asked, batting my eyelashes. \"Go ahead,\" he said. I climbed off of him and out of the door, running as soon as my feet hit the ground. After about fifty yards, I changed and began running on all fours. Oh, the joy of it! To run, the wind blowing my fur in all directions! I couldn't stop. I didn't want to stop. After about ten minutes, I figured that I had run enough. Aiden might look for me soon. I turned around and out of the corner of my eye saw movement from the trees. I stopped and looked. An old man was approaching, a farmer from the look of it. He carried a rifle, and I wasn't about to stay to confirm that he didn't have silver bullets. I backed up slowly and froze when he looked over to me. I saw him acknowledge my glowing eyes. I turned around quickly and ran off. Bullets followed me. \"Damn wolves are going get to my sheep and ruin my farm,\" I heard him mutter with my exceptional audible range. He thought I was a stray wolf, nothing more. But now I couldn't change back, or he'd see. Aiden's POV I leaned against the car door, searching the night for Vivian's wolf shape. It wasn't hard to miss as it was creamy white, but I still worried. She was a werewolf. Even though she promised not to hurt me, I wasn't sure she wouldn't hurt anything else. Or something else might hurt her. There were people who believed in werewolves other than me. I began to close my eyes, tired from driving and waiting for her. A gunshot fired and I was immediately wide awake. I opened the car door and reached for a pistol under the seat before running off in the direction that she had gone. I didn't see her anywhere. I saw an old man in the trees with a rifle and my heart rate increased. Had he reached Vivian? I approached him slowly. His gun whirled around, but then he saw me. \"A wolf is loose; did you see where it went? Gotta protect my sheep,\" he said. I didn't know where Vivian was, but I figured she'd head back to the car. I pointed in the other direction. \"Probably that way, if it wants your sheep,\" I said. \"Thanks. I gotta be careful,\" he said and walked in the direction I had indicated. I exhaled slowly, hoping Vivian was at the car by now. I didn't know what bullets he had and I prayed I didn't have to find out. I headed back to the car, picking my way around the vines in the trees. A thorn scraped my leg and I winced. I looked back, but the man was gone. I began running, hoping that Vivian was safe. Vivian's POV I ran and couldn't stop. I had to get away. I saw the car and jumped into the open window. Where was Aiden? Probably out looking for me. Damn . I hoped he didn't get in any trouble. I curled up in the backseat and sighed. The car door opened and Aiden climbed in, grumbling. He didn't realize I was there. \"Where is she?\" he asked himself. I saw the pain in his eyes and I whimpered. He looked back at me and sighed. \"Next time, don't go so far Viv,\" he said. I started panting, even though I wasn't that tired. I climbed over to him and saw a cut on his leg. I looked up at him, perked my ears, and bent down and started licking it. \"Viv, stop that tickles,\" he said, laughing. I sat back and changed back into myself. \"You do know that a dog's saliva has antiseptic properties right? I was just trying to help. What happened?\" I asked. \"A thorn pricked me when I was looking for you,\" he said. I tore off the bottom of his shirt and wrapped it around the cut. It looked really deep. \"Why didn't I think of that?\" he asked. \"Because you're just a dumb guy,\" I said playfully, ruffling his hair. \"I'll excuse that insult because you helped me, but in the future...\" he stopped, giggling. I laughed. \"In the future, you'll what?\" \"Tickle you to death,\" he said. I laughed. \"I'll just outrun you like I always have!\" I said, adjusting myself in the passenger's seat, buckling my seatbelt. He buckled his and started the ignition. \"Drive,\" I said, daring him with my eyes. \"Next stop, Paris, France!\" he said, pressing on the accelerator, hard. We vanished into the sunrise, the moon at our backs, escaping our families to be together. It sounded like a romance novel when I thought of it, but it was just my life and I was content with it.

Nikki was followed closely by her brothers, sisters, and cousins, other young members of her pack. \"Guys what shall we do today?\" Nikki asked her family. \"Dad's getting us some meat\" one of her brothers said. \"For now I just want to run\" one of her sisters said. \"Alright you can run just stay where I can see you\" Nikki said \"you never know what's out here.\" \"Your not going to run with us?\" the sister asked. \"Nah\" Nikki said \"I don't feel like running right now.\" \"Your going into town again aren't you?\" Her cousin asked. \"Yes\" Nikki said \"but you can't tell anyone.\" \"We won't as long as your careful sister\" Her brother said. \"I will be\" Nikki said \"you can only tell if I don't come back.\" \"You are planning on coming back right?\" her smallest and youngest sister asked softly. \"Yes I will try to come back\" Nikki said \"but I might be there a while.\" \"Just come back\" the youngest said softly hugging her sister. \"I will\" Nikki said as she took off towards town. Her family watched her for a moment and then they went on to start running. Nikki had made it to town and she went to her spot that she loved so much. Her spot that she hid in was overlooking a castle where the prince lived that she liked. The path way was closed off but thanks to her athletic skills due to being a Lycan she was able to get in. Normally she was in this area alone but today something was different, Nikki could hear a clicking sound inside the building. Nikki followed the sound. \"Hello anyone in here?\" Nikki asked. When she called Nikki heard a small clattering crash \"I'm-I'm sorry\" A male voice called \"I didn't know anyone else was in here I'll leave\" As Nikki looked she found a young man about her age, he had camera equipment and he was rushing to leave. He had been taking pictures of the inside of the castle. \"You don't have to leave\" Nikki said \"also who are you?\" \"Just a young, hopefully upcoming, photographer and movie director\" The young man said he now saw Nikki \"I was just taking some shots to try and come up with a movie\" \"I am Nikki\" She said \"so what kind of movie are you making?\" The man was quiet for a moment \"I don't know if a girl like you would like it\" He said said \"It could be called a monster movie.\" \"Do you need a monster for the movie?\" Nikki asked. \"Sure you wouldn't happen to know one would you?\" The man said smiling a bit at her as if she had been joking. \"I can play a werewolf\" Nikki said \"that is if you need one.\" The man looked at her and smiled again \"Why would you want to be the monster of a monster movie?\" He asked \"It would make more since if you were the one being chased, I don't see how you could even come close to being monster-like. Of course their may be something to you that I am missing.\" \"Either way I don't mind\" Nikki said \"but I know I can do the monster but if you like I will be the one being chased.\" The man smiled \"You said your name was Nikki?\" He asked \"My name is Ryan\" He offered his hand to shake. \"Its nice to meet you Ryan\" Nikki said shaking his hand. \"So I have told you why I am here\" Ryan said \"Why are you here?\" \"This is my spot\" Nikki said \"I come here to see the prince.\" \"I don't blame you its a beautiful place\" Ryan said \"I can leave you to think if you will still let me take a few more pictures.\" \"I don't mind\" Nikki said \"this can be our spot.\" Ryan smiled again and then went back to where he had been before to allow Nikki to think and admire \"her\" prince. Nikki had went to her spot now and she looked at her prince. As she sat there she was also watching Ryan take his pictures. Ryan took a few more then got up to get ready to leave. Nikki smiled and she was getting ready to leave as well because it was getting late and she needed to get home. \"See you Ryan\" Nikki said as she left. \"Do you work anywhere around town?\" Ryan asked. \"Not right now\" Nikki said \"I will be back here tomorrow if you want to meet me here.\" \"I will see if I can come by\" Ryan said. \"Ok\" Nikki said as she ran towards her house. As she got there her dad was mad now. \"Just where were you?\" He asked sternly. \"I went to town\" Nikki said. \"And why did you go into town?\" He asked. \"Because I went to see the prince\" Nikki said \"because I like him.\" \"What would make you attracted to a human?\" her dad asked \"you know that your mate is already decided.\" \"The prince is handsome dad\" Nikki said \"and a mate that is decided is so not for me.\" \"Well thats too bad you know that the pack decides mates\" Her father said. \"I won't like him\" Nikki said. \"That's not the point\" Her father said \"You will marry him though.\" \"Whatever\" Nikki said as she was heading to her room. Soon after her littlest sister came up to her again \"Why are you always like that around daddy?\" She asked. \"Dad and I don't get along\" Nikki said. \"But why not?\" her little sister asked. \"We just don't\" Nikki said. \"Well I guess I am going to bed now\" Her little sister said leaving. \"Night\" Nikki said as she went over to her window to climb out. Her family had all gone to bed now and Nikki was outside alone. Nikki had run back to her hideout to where she could see the prince. She looked around for a while and thought about her father. Soon she saw something white on the floor of the castle. \"What is this?\" Nikki asked as she went over to the white stuff. It was a recently developed photograph one that showed her as she was leaving the castle. \"Ryan must have dropped it\" Nikki said picking it up. As she looked at it Nikki could easily smell Ryan's aftershave, almost as if he was there, with her hightened senses. \"Ryan\" Nikki called. She looked around but he didn't seem to be there at all. Maybe her sense of smell was better then she gave it credit for. Nikki had continued to look around but she couldn't find anything. As she was there she could feel someone watching her. Soon Nikki smelt a very familar smell near her and it wasn't anyone she liked. She knew it had to be Garrison the member of the pack that her dad wanted her to be with he was there somewhere. \"Garrison\" Nikki said \"what are you doing here?\" \"I heard about your fight with your dad\" He said coming out of the shadows now, his dark hair sleeked back the way he liked to keep it. \"I thought I would just come by to make sure that you were ok.\" \"I am fine\" Nikki said. \"You disagreed with him again didn't you?\" He asked. \"Yes\" Nikki said \"What's it to you?\" \"Don't get up in my face now\" Garrison said \"Remember what you are or will be to me.\" \"I know\" Nikki said \"you don't have to remind me.\" \"That's better now come on 'dear' let's go back home\" Garrison said. \"Fine\" Nikki said as she followed him home. Once there Garrison let her loose just below her window. \"You can climb back up I am sure right?\" He asked. \"Sure\" Nikki said as she climbed back up to her room. Nikki had to find a way to make the prince fall in love with her because she didn't want to marry Garrison. Garrison watched her climb admiring the view a little too much before he went back to his own room. Soon morning came and Nikki was awakened to both her mom calling that it was breakfast and by its smell. Nikki had went downstairs to eat breakfast. \"Morning everyone\" Nikki said as she sat down at the table. \"Did you sleep well last night honey?\" Her mother asked as she laid the bacon and eggs before her. \"Yes I did\" Nikki said. \"You going to go see Garrison today?\" Her mom asked \"He's been wanting to spend time with you you know.\" \"I don't know yet\" Nikki said \"I may go to my hideout and hang out there.\" \"You have been going there an awful lot lately\" Her mom said smiling \"anything about that place I should know about?\" \"I like the prince that is in the castle\" Nikki said \"also I met a friend that is a director and I might get to be in his movie.\" \"Just be careful around humans honey\" Her mom told her \"and remember you are going to be with Garrison just as I was told to be with your father\" Her mom looked as if she almost wished that wasn't the way things were but also that she couldn't do anything to change it. \"I will be mom\" Nikki said as she finished her food. \"When do we want everything to take place mom?\" She asked. \"Your father wants the wedding to be in the next few weeks if you guys can make it work long enough that is\" Her mom said softly \"I wish you two weren't always at odds with each other.\" \"I know but I guess its because I am the oldest\" Nikki said \"he just wants to look out for me.\" Nikki had put her plate up and she was going out the door. \"Mom I will be back later\" She said \"I want to take a walk.\" \"Alright\" She said \"Don't forget that we got a hunt tonight.\" \"Ok\" Nikki said as she took off towards town. Once in town she saw a small diner it didn't seem to have many people at the moment and she also saw a small art show going on at the time. Nikki had went to her spot now. \"Ryan you here?\" She called. \"Yup\" Ryan said \"How was your night?\" Ryan was getting his camera equipment set up for more pictures. \"It was good\" Nikki said \"So how do we want to do this movie me being chased or me being the monster?\" \"Sorry you could never be a monster to me so we got to have you chased\" Ryan said \"How fast can you run?\" \"Pretty fast\" Nikki said. \"Alright then\" Ryan said \"Where should we go for you to show me this?\" Nikki thought about this. \"The woods\" Nikki said \"but we have to be quick.\" \"Quick?\" Ryan asked \"why is that?\" \"You never know what can be in the woods\" Nikki said. \"If you say so\" Ryan said and they walked back into the woods. Ryan set up his camera over a thin area that was more or less clean of branches. \"Follow that path up and then come back\" he told her. Nikki did so and she ran the whole path real fast. \"How was that?\" She asked. \"Wow\" Ryan said \"you weren't kidding that was almost inhuman.\" \"So will that work?\" Nikki asked. \"Yup\" Ryan said \"I will handle the rest of that clip with my computer.\" \"Ok\" Nikki said \"I guess we will meet back at the spot when you get it ready.\" Nikki was fixing to leave before she stopped. \"I think you dropped this a while back\" She said pulling out the picture to give back to him. \"Oh that\" Ryan said \"That picture has nothing to do with my movie scenes, I just took it for fun, but thanks.\" \"No problem\" Nikki said as she left. She had made it back to her house. \"Good timing\" Her mother said as Nikki entered the house \"we were just about ready to go on the hunt.\" \"Ok\" Nikki said as she got prepared for the hunt. Once everyone was ready they went out to the middle of the woods. As always Nikki's father had chosen a well built male for the hunt. He had him tied up and on his knees in the middle of the group. Nikki's mother walked up to him as her father went behind him with a knife. \"You have until the lake and you go free\" Her dad said to the man from behind his blindfolded face. \"Good luck\" Her mom told the man as she helped him up and gave him a soft kiss as she removed the blindfold and her dad cut the ties and the man's wrist. \"Go\" The man went on through the woods and soon the whole family was ready to charge. \"Maybe you can redeeam yourself by catching the meat\" Her dad told her softly before running on. Nikki had took off and she followed the path that she knew all to well. Nikki was trailing the man real well. Soon she felt the urge for her to shift into a wolf as she ran the smell of blood on the hunt and the wind her hair was too much. Nikki had shifted into a wolf and her fur was white with lavender streaks and also Nikki had lavender colored eyes. The man was running as fast as he could to try and get away from the Lycans some had caught up to him now and were toying with him as Nikki came onto the scene. Nikki had come to toy with the guy as well. The man hadn't expected this when he signed up for the strange job interview that he did. He saw the three wolves before him, one with purple streaks, another with silver ones, and a smaller wolf almost a pup with brown patches of fur. He had to find a way to get out of this mess. He eyed a tree and climbed up it. From in the tree he saw the river, he had to make his way there. Nikki had tried to knock him out of the tree now to get this chase going again. Instead of simply falling out of the tree the man made a flying jump towards the lake but was caught in mid-air by the wolf with silver streaks, Nikki knew that wolf to be Garrison, who pulled him down and began to go to work preping him for the rest of the pack. The man was caught now and Garrison waited. Nikki had made her way over to the guy now. Soon everyone was around him and Nikki's father had shifted back into his human form. \"That's too bad you didn't make it meat\" He told the man. At that point Garrison knocked him out \"Let us go home\" Her mother told everyone as Nikki's younger sister the smallest pup, the one with brown patches, changed back into her normal form and took her mother's hand. Nikki had changed back to human form as well. \"Nice catch Garrison\" Nikki said as she took off towards the lake now. \"Where are you going?\" Her father called. \"I am going to the lake for a bit\" Nikki said. \"Would you like some company?\" Garrison asked calmly. \"Sure\" Nikki said \"also do you think the lake would be good to get married at?\" \"You actually want to marry me now?\" Garrison asked a little bit surprised. \"I was doing a fantasy idea\" Nikki said \"Sorry to get you confused Garrison.\" \"Um ok\" Garrison said \"You just be careful.\" \"I will be\" Nikki said as she made it to the lake. Once there Nikki looked around. She saw that the town was just nearby the lake and she almost thought she saw Ryan walk into the diner there. \"Garrison I am going into town\" Nikki said \"don't tell anyone please.\" \"I can go with you if you like\" Garrison said. \"No thanks\" Nikki said \"I will be back before nightfall.\" Nikki had taken off towards the diner hoping that Ryan was there. \"O....k\" Garrison said and he watched her leave. Nikki made it to the diner and saw that Ryan seemed to be getting a table. \"Ryan\" Nikki said coming into the diner. \"Oh hello\" Ryan said \"What are you doing here?\" \"I wanted to ask how the movie was going\" Nikki said. \"It's coming along nicely\" Ryan said \"just got done working with the monster part.\" \"That is cool\" Nikki said \"so when can I see it?\" \"Should be in the next couple days though you don't have a big part in it\" Ryan said \"and my photographs have been kind of preoccupied with a different image lately so its taking me longer.\" \"Ok\" Nikki said \"so do you want to meet in our spot when you get it done?\" \"We can\" Ryan said \"of course there is nothing stopping us from hanging out right now is there?\" \"No there is not\" Nikki said. \"Where then how about it?\" Ryan asked. \"That is fine with me\" Nikki said. \"The only problem is I don't have any money so all we will be able to do is go to my apartment\" Ryan said. \"That is fine\" Nikki said. \"I also don't have a lot to offer\" Ryan said \"I mean I can make you a meal and a movie but thats about it.\" \"Thats fine\" Nikki said \"lets go then.\" Ryan smiled softly and led the way to his apartment. Once there Ryan showed her around his small apartment. Nikki saw a desktop computer and what looked to be a pretty soft couch. \"This is a nice place\" Nikki said. \"If you want something to eat just have a seat and I will make something\" Ryan said moving towards the kitchen. \"Ok\" Nikki said as she sat down on the couch. Ryan made a quick pasta dish and brought to her and him to eat. Before he got to eating he looked to the movies he had. \"Any kind of movie you want to watch?\" He asked. \"No\" Nikki said \"you can put in what you like.\" Ryan then put in a soft romantic film, it was the first one he picked up. Then he sat down to eat. Nikki was watching it as she ate and she was liking it and she was also beginning to like Ryan as well. Nikki saw how Ryan was watching her as well, while she ate, he seemed to be looking at her moreso then the movie. Nikki was watching him now. Ryan blushed a bit and smiled at her. \"What?\" He asked \"Is there something on my face?\" \"Nothing\" Nikki said \"and there is nothing on your face.\" \"Nikki?\" Ryan asked softly \"Are you going out with anyone right now?\" \"Yes\" Nikki said \"a guy named Garrison he is my mate.\" \"I don't think I have heard anyone call their boyfriend their mate\" Ryan said \"but ok, I guess I can forget about it then.\" \"I don't like him as much as I do you\" Nikki said. \"You don't?\" Ryan asked \"then why are you with him?\" \"Does he hurt you?\" \"My family set him up for me\" Nikki said \"and no he hasn't hurt me yet.\" \"You say that like you think he might\" Ryan said. \"I just don't like him\" Nikki said \"I like the prince and you.\" \"Then forget what your family says\" Ryan said \"Be with who you want.\" \"I want to be with you\" Nikki said. Ryan was surprised \"The prince would be better then me\" He said \"Why me all of the sudden?\" \"The prince doesn't even know I exsist\" Nikki said \"your the only one that knows about me.\" \"He doesn't know yet but you never know what will happen if you meet\" Ryan said \"Would you rather give him a chance or just forget about him and go for me?\" \"I would like to meet the prince\" Nikki said \"but there is no way into the castle.\" \"That's true\" Ryan said. He was done eating and had put his dishes away and came back to her \"What now?\" \"I don't know\" Nikki said \"but I guess meeting the prince would be a fantasy.\" \"That's up to what you want to believe\" Ryan said. \"Sure but I know that its just a fantasy\" Nikki said \"It will be impossible to see the prince.\" \"It is for now anyway\" Ryan said looking to the clock. It was getting closer to 6:00pm. \"I guess you have to go home now huh?\" Ryan asked softly. \"Yes\" Nikki said as she got up to leave but before she left she gave Ryan a kiss. Ryan touched his cheek softly and was left speechless as she shut the door behind her. Soon Nikki was back at home and Garrison was there when she arrived. \"Did you have fun?\" He asked. \"Yes I did\" Nikki said \"also were you spying on me?\" \"Whatever gave you that idea?\" Garrison asked. \"Because you are usually the one that makes sure I don't do anything wrong\" Nikki said. \"Does that mean that you done something wrong?\" Garrison asked moving closer to her, \"Something that we wouldn't approve?\" \"No\" Nikki said \"I wouldn't do anything like that.\" \"So you would be willing to do what we say and follow orders without fail just like the rest of us right?\" He asked, he was close to her face now. \"No\" Nikki said \"I sometimes feel like everyone is holding me back that I need to do what I want sometimes.\" \"Don't let your dad hear that\" Garrison said, \"Following orders from the alpha is what you are supposed to do.\" \"So what does that make you if my dad is the Alpha?\" Nikki asked. \"If I get with you as we plan,\" Garrison started \"Then I will become the next in line when he dies.\" \"So are you saying that I have to listen to you right now?\" Nikki asked \"Because if you are I won't be with you long.\" Garrison grabbed the top of her shirt, \"Careful princess,\" He said \"Or I will keep us together without your consent.\" \"Understood\" Nikki said, she hated giving in to him. \"That's better\" Garrison said, letting her go, \"Now get some sleep.\" \"Fine\" Nikki said as she went to her room to go on to bed to get some sleep. Soon morning came and Nikki's little sister came up to greet her, \"You ok Nikki?\" She asked. \"Yes I am fine\" Nikki said \"I am going to leave for a bit don't tell anyone please especially not Garrison.\" \"But you need to go down and get breakfast first don't you?\" Her sister asked a little bit worried. \"No\" Nikki said \"not since it means being at the same table as Garrison.\" Her sister looked at her strangely for a moment, \"If you say so sissy\" She said. \"Sis please don't tell\" Nikki said as she climbed out her window and ran off. Her sister walked downstairs afterwards not mentioning anything to the family, she merely shruged when they asked about her. Soon Nikki was back close to town. Nikki had run to Ryan's place now because she needed a friend. Once at the door she found that it was locked she would have to knock. Nikki knocked on the door \"Ryan its Nikki\" She said \"I need a friend to talk to.\" \"Nikki?\" Ryan still sounded a little sleepy, \"Just a moment.\" Soon after Ryan opened the door for her. \"What's wrong?\" He asked as they sat on the couch. \"Garrison tried to hurt me\" Nikki said \"I came to you because I had no one else to turn to.\" \"Why not tell your dad?\" Ryan asked \"He would decide to split you up after that wouldn't he?\" \"He wouldn't want you hurt after all.\" \"My dad would take his word over mine\" Nikki said \"he would blame me for everything.\" Ryan thought about that for a moment, \"Sounds like your family doesn't even care what you think\" He said. \"No they don't\" Nikki said \"your the only one that cares and your the only one that knows that I don't like Garrison.\" \"So what are you going to do?\" Ryan asked. \"If you don't mind letting me stay here for a while\" Nikki said. \"For the moment you can\" Ryan said \"I don't care, that's for sure.\" \"Thank you\" Nikki said. \"Of course you would have to follow me around town\" Ryan said \"My place can be kind of lame if your alone here, trust me I know.\" \"That will be fine\" Nikki said \"I don't mind it.\" \"Well wait here while I get my equipment and then we can go on.\" Ryan said leaving the room for a moment. Once he was back Nikki saw that he had all of his camera stuff with him and what looked like a book of local legends. \"What is all this for?\" Nikki asked. \"What the book?\" Ryan asked \"I got it from the library, needed to know some stuff about the legends around here, some were quiet interesting.\" \"Cool\" Nikki said \"I am scared.\" \"Scared?\" Ryan asked \"Of what?\" \"That I will get found out\" Nikki said \"also how is your movie coming?\" \"So they find you with me big deal its not like they will try and kill me or something just because I am helping you break the 'rules'\" Ryan said, \"And as far as the movie that is what I was going to go test today.\" \"Ok\" Nikki said \"thanks again for taking me in like this.\" \"You act like your going to stay at my house or something\" Ryan said \"Not that I would care or anything but I don't know if that's such a good idea right now, I'm not the best at entertaining company.\" \"Ryan your my only friend\" Nikki said \"and who cares if its not a good idea I thought we were going to break the rules.\" \"Sure why not?\" Ryan said \"You did give me that kiss\" The two of them made their way into town to Ryan's photoshop. \"This place is nice\" Nikki said as she walked around and looked at all the photos. She saw that some of the photos showed her, mostly when she was at the castle. There were others that were of the forest she had ran in and out of, other people that she didn't know. \"All these photos are great\" Nikki said \"you would be a great photographer.\" \"I thought I was one already but thanks\" Ryan said \"Do you want to come with me to get a few more developed in the dark room?\" \"I am allergic to a dark room\" Nikki said. \"Must be the chemicals\" Ryan said \"That's too bad you can read this if you like\" Ryan handed her the legends book and went on inside. Nikki started reading the book. Nikki found that the legends book that she was reading told of many of the local legends around town, one of which included her race of Lycans. \"My family is a legend\" Nikki said. Nikki realized that could mean that Ryan may know about her race, but that didn't mean that he would accept her for what she was. \"If he knows then he may not even accept me as a friend\" Nikki said softly. Ryan came back out of the darkroom now and he felt that Nikki was worried about something. \"You ok?\" He asked. \"Yea I am fine just thinking\" Nikki said. \"I guess some of the legends interest you then huh?\" Ryan asked smiling. \"Yes especially the one about the Lycans\" Nikki said. \"Oh you like those too?\" Ryan asked \"I thought they sounded interesting too, there concept of a hunt was kind of creepy though.\" \"Yea that was creepy\" Nikki said \"but its cool.\" \"I guess you would like since you seem to like to run\" Ryan said. \"True\" Nikki said \"also how much of the movie do you have done?\" \"I am getting there\" Ryan said \"Should be the next couple days.\" \"That is good\" Nikki said \"at least you almost have it done.\" \"At any rate we should go get some lunch and then you decide what you want to do with the rest of your day\" Ryan said smiling. \"Ok\" Nikki said. \"Do you have any preference as to where we eat?\" Ryan asked. \"What about that Diner in town?\" Nikki asked. \"That should work\" Ryan said \"Let's go then.\" \"Cool\" Nikki said as the two of them left. They soon had made it to the diner, Ryan ordered some pasta for himself and the two of them set in a small booth. Nikki had ordered a corn dog and a soda and she went to sit with Ryan. \"I want to give you friendship gift\" Nikki said as she pulled out a crystal. \"Where and when did you get that?\" Ryan asked. \"I have had it\" Nikki said \"its a special crystal.\" Ryan picked up the crystal \"Special crystal huh? How is it special?\" he asked. \"It is a moonstone crystal\" Nikki said. \"What is it for?\" Ryan asked \"A family heirloom or something?\" \"Its something I have had put up in my jewelry box\" Nikki said. \"What made you decide to give it to me?\" Ryan asked. \"I thought with all the stuff you have done for me its the least I can do\" Nikki said. \"I having really done much more then be your friend and give you someone to talk to\" Ryan said softly. \"You have been there for me and so this crystal will be our sign of friendship\" Nikki said. \"That's cool\" Ryan said \"Thanks\" Soon they were done eating and Ryan was ready to head back to his studio to finish up the rest of the movie. \"No problem\" Nikki said. Ryan waited for Nikki to be done eating. Nikki had finished eating and she threw her wrapper and cup away. \"We can go now\" Nikki said. \"Alright then\" Ryan said they got up and made their way out of the diner. Ryan was soon back at his studio \"Hopefully this should finish it up completely\" He said. \"I want to see it if you do get it finished\" Nikki said. Ryan worked for a few more hours and soon he did in fact finish. \"We should be able to watch it at my apartment now\" Ryan said \"Then I guess we can have dinner together and you can head home right?\" \"Yes we can\" Nikki said. \"Ok\" Ryan said, somehow not surprised that she was going to head back home. They then made their way to his apartment and began to watch his movie. \"Yea I guess so\" Nikki said \"if I don't head home my parents will be mad.\" \"Of course its not like they treat you right anyway\" Ryan said \"It should be your choice.\" \"That is true but its hard for my dad to let me grow up\" Nikki said \"I am his oldest daughter.\" \"That makes sense\" Ryan said \"As long as you keep in mind that I care about you too that's all that matters, even if your family doesn't like it.\" \"I know\" Nikki said \"and thanks for everything.\" The two of them sat together watching the movie. Once it was done Ryan looked to Nikki to see what she thought, she had saw the clip that he had used of her running as if she was running from a monster that turned out not to be there. \"I loved the movie\" Nikki said \"it was the best.\" \"Well that's flattering\" Ryan said \"Considering its one of the first that I actually finished.\" \"It was great\" Nikki said. Nikki had gotten up and she got ready to leave. \"You can't forget dinner\" Ryan said smiling. \"Dinner and a movie it was all great\" Nikki said \"I loved it all.\" \"I guess I will see you some other time then?\" Ryan asked standing up and looking at her. \"Yes\" Nikki said \"I am sorry that I can't stay.\" \"At least not yet\" Ryan said \"Maybe it will be ok for you to stay one of these days.\" \"Maybe\" Nikki said as she left. Ryan just watched her leave. Nikki was soon back at her house. \"Where have you been all day dear?\" Her mom asked as she entered the house. \"I have been at a friend's house\" Nikki said. \"Was it a human friend?\" Her mom asked. \"Yes\" Nikki said \"he is a great guy.\" \"Just be careful honey\" Her mom said \"I wouldn't want you to get hurt because of him.\" \"I will be mom\" Nikki said \"also where is everyone?\" \"I can't be sure\" She said \"All I know is your father was going to get out some more 'meat' for the next hunt.\" \"Ok\" Nikki said as she went to her room. The night soon came and Nikki's mom called for it to be lights out and everyone got ready for bed. Nikki had turned out her light and went to sleep. The next day came and just as before Nikki came down to the kitchen for breakfast. \"You going to go out again today?\" Her mom asked. Nikki saw that her father, and Garrison seemed to be out, apparently preparing the hunt. \"Not today\" Nikki said \"I will stay home and spend time with my siblings and cousins.\" \"That's a good idea\" Her mom said \"They have missed you dear.\" \"I have missed them too\" Nikki said as she went to see her family. She found her two youngest cousins outside in the forest playing. \"Dana Dina\" Nikki said. \"Hey Nikki\" They both called to her. \"How is everything going you two?\" Nikki asked. \"We were just looking for berries\" Dina said. \"You two be careful which ones you pick because they may not all be fully ripe\" Nikki said. \"We were wondering about that\" Dana said \"Could you come with us and help us?\" Dina asked. \"Sure\" Nikki said as she went to help her cousins. Soon after they were done and making their way back to the house. Nikki had explain to them how to tell if they were ripe or not. She had fun spending time with her family and she loved every minute of it. Once home she found Garrison and her father waiting \"I see you didn't leave today\" Her father said. \"Yea I decided to spend time with my family\" Nikki said. \"That's good\" Her father said \"Because as we all know he is part of it\" Her father indicated Garrison. \"You should spend some quality time with him.\" \"I will daddy\" Nikki said. \"That's my girl\" Her dad said. Garrison then walked over closer to her. \"I am sorry for not spending as much time with you\" Nikki said as he came closer. \"That's ok\" Garrison said \"We can spend time together now, before the hunt.\" \"Alright\" Nikki said even though she didn't want to. \"Its good that you will come with me\" Garrison said taking her hand a little forcefully \"I don't think I have showed you where I hang at.\" \"Garrison please take it easy on me\" Nikki said \"and no you haven't.\" Garrison didn't seem to really notice much of what she said but he did lead her to his little lair as he called it. Inside Nikki saw the other members of the family that had joined with Garrison's 'pack'. Some of them she knew but others she didn't. \"This place is nice\" Nikki said. \"Do you want to see the 'prey' we will chase tonight?\" Garrison asked \"Or would you rather me introduce you to the others?\" \"The prey\" Nikki said \"and then introduce me later.\" \"Fair enough\" Garrison said and he led Nikki to a dark dungeon like room. Inside was a man about the size that most of the man around town were. He was blind folded, cuffed to the wall, had tight ear muffs over his ears, and a gag in his mouth. \"Wow he looks easy to catch\" Nikki said. \"Yeah and the best part is I found him alone\" Garrison said \"I don't know for sure, but I can't think of why anyone would want to hang out with this weak human. By the way he can't hear or see us in case you couldn't tell.\" \"So where did you find him?\" Nikki asked. \"An apartment complex\" Garrison said \"I guess he lived alone.\" Nikki also noticed that because of the hood she couldn't tell that much about the man's features. \"You didn't follow me when I would leave did you?\" Nikki asked. \"What brought that up?\" Garrison asked a little bit shocked at the pointed question, she still didn't trust or like him it seemed. \"Because I have a friend who lives in an apartment\" Nikki said. \"And what makes you think I would even be interested in a meatstack you hang out with?\" Garrison asked moving closer to her now a little angry. \"Because I am great friends with him and I like him like a brother\" Nikki said. \"Like a brother?\" Garrison asked \"You would kiss your brother?\" Nikki could see the anger in Garrison's now wolf eyes. \"Yes I would\" Nikki said. \"I don't think you would kiss your brother like you kissed the meatstack\" Garrison asked removing the hood to reveal the blindfolded and gagged Ryan. \"Let him go\" Nikki said \"or I will dump you.\" \"You can't do that\" Garrison said \"And neither can I.\" \"How could you do this to me?\" Nikki asked \"he is my friend and I like him better than I do you.\" Garrison shrugged \"Sorry it wasn't my idea\" He said \"The prey is never my idea, I just catch them and hold them.\" \"I am out of here\" Nikki said as she took off. Nikki didn't get too far. Something struck her from behind and she was knocked out. When she came to she found herself tied to a bed by her ankles and wrists. Most of her clothing was gone. \"Garrison why are you doing this?\" Nikki asked. \"You aren't giving me any other choice\" Garrison said, he was beside the bed she was tied too. \"I was only doing what I was told to do but you took it as my fault.\" \"I am sorry I am just upset\" Nikki said. \"And you won't run off again if I untie you?\" He asked. \"No\" Nikki said \"I promise.\" Garrison came over to untie her and Nikki saw that he himself was only in a thin pair of shorts. Nikki didn't know what to say now. \"I wish we didn't have to be together like this\" Garrison said \"Would you like some water?\" She was untied now. \"Yes please\" Nikki said. \"Remember you said you wouldn't leave\" Garrison said \"And as insurance I still have most of your clothes.\" \"I won't leave\" Nikki said. As Nikki sat there all she could think about was Ryan and how much trouble he is in. She wanted to free him but she knew she couldn't leave. Garrison smiled at her and then left to bring her water. \"Here you go\" He said coming back and sitting on the bed. Nikki drank her water now and she didn't speak for a while. Garrison walked towards the window and looked out to the afternoon sky. \"Why do you betray your heritage?\" Garrison asked. \"I am not sure\" Nikki said \"I guess I just wanted to have a normal life when I am human.\" \"But you like to run and shift forms just as much as the rest of us don't you?\" Garrison asked. As she looked at him Nikki couldn't help but notice how even though she didn't like his attitude he wasn't that bad looking of a guy. Dark hair, strong body, and intense eyes that seemed to suck you in. \"Yes I do\" Nikki said. \"Then why do you want to live as a human?\" Garrison asked. Nikki didn't know why, it could be because he wasn't being so pushy but for some reason she almost felt attracted to him now. \"I am not sure\" Nikki said \"I guess I just wanted to be normal.\" Garrison saw how she was looking at him now and smiled \"You ok?\" He asked. \"Yes I am fine\" Nikki said as she turned away and blushed. Garrison turned his head to the side confused \"If I didn't know better I would think that you are suddenly attracted to me\" He said. \"What would you do if I told you yes I am attracted to you?\" Nikki asked. \"First I would wonder why\" Garrison said \"And next I would be glad because I like you too.\" \"I guess I never really got to know the true you\" Nikki said. \"That's possible\" Garrison said \"You only hated me because of your dad\" Garrison shivered \"Are you as cold as I am?\" \"Yes I am\" Nikki said. \"We could climb under here if you like\" He said motioning for the blankets on the bed. \"Sure\" Nikki said \"also I am sorry about the way I have treated you.\" Garrison realized that he had forgotten that they were both more or less without clothes \"It's to be expected\" He said \"Too bad the 'pack' will pick on me and/or tell your father if I leave to get our clothes back.\" \"Garrison tell me something\" Nikki said \"Do you think having a mate is good or bad?\" \"Depends on the emotions involved\" Garrison said \"Above all else you need to do what your told, at least thats what I have been taught.\" \"True\" Nikki said \"What about being set up with a mate before you are born?\" \"Like I said, do what your told\" Garrison said \"Love can come out of anything if you let it.\" Nikki just laid there now wondering what else to talk about. \"How do you feel about being intimate with someone?\" Garrison asked leaning closer to her. And again a strange urge came over her, something telling her that she needed to kiss him. Nikki wasn't sure what to say and a few minutes later she kissed him which was her answer. \"Not that I am complaining but where did that come from?\" Garrison asked. \"I love you\" Nikki said \"and it felt like the right time to give it to you.\" \"I have something I could give you in return if you would be willing to get that close\" Garrison said \"We would just have to make sure not to fall asleep or we will miss the hunt.\" For some reason Nikki couldn't remember who they were going to be chasing now. \"What is it?\" Nikki asked. Garrison leaned close to her and was more or less on top of her now kissing her lips trying and hoping that she would invite him into a deeper kiss. Nikki's body seemed willing to comply weather or not her mind wanted to or not. Nikki continued to kiss him and she didn't seem to give a care now. Garrison seemed just as eager and soon they were doing a lot more then simply making out. Soon after Garrison's body relaxed and looked to the clock, \"I think I will be alright to back out there and get the rest of our clothes now we need to get ready.\" There was sharp pain in Nikki's head right now, like her mind was trying to tell her something that she had forgot. Nikki pushed everything out of her mind but the hunt. Garrison got up and got what clothes he had had on back on before giving the same to Nikki and leaving to get the rest \"I will be back with your clothes and we can go on\" He told her. \"Ok\" Nikki said as she sat there. He soon came back and handed her her clothes. \"There you go\" He said \"I guess I am taking to the location?\" Nikki had put her clothes on now. \"I guess\" Nikki said. \"The 'packs' got the prey and they will meet us there\" Garrison said and soon Nikki found herself in the same area as before with the man that was going to be their prey. He removed the hood, ear muffs but kept the blindfold and gag. \"This meat tried to invade our pack\" Her father said holding the man's hands behind him \"Should we even give him the chance at the lake?\" \"Yes\" Nikki said. Most of the pack seemed to agree they still wanted to run. \"Fine by me\" Her father said \"Nikki come here. \"Yes Father\" Nikki said as she made it to him. \"I think that this one should be the first prey that you send off\" He said \"Do you think you can do that?\" Nikki knew that sending the prey off meant that she would be the female to remove the blindfold and kiss him on the forehead to wish him luck. \"Yes I think I can\" Nikki said as she removed the blindfold and gave him a kiss. As she removed the blindfold and saw the man's eyes they grew wide with terror. Something about those eyes was familar to her. As the gag was removed so she could kiss him he spoke. \"Nikki?\" He whispered \"what is going on here?\" Nikki's mind flashed back to her time with Ryan, the man before her. He was her friend, she now realized that Garrison must have done something to her. Nikki didn't say anything. \"Nikki?\" Ryan said again but Nikki's father was up next to his ear \"You have until the lake to run\" He said \"Otherwise your dead for getting close to my daughter\" Her father cut the strings on Ryan's wrists \"Ahh\" Ryan hissed before he looked around as he began a stumbling run. \"Put her up where she can't cause any trouble\" Her dad said, as Garrison put Nikki into the car and started to lock the door. \"Garrison don't do this\" Nikki said as she cried. \"I can't help it Nikki\" Garrison said \"Its the rules\" Nikki had to find a way out. She saw that Garrison hadn't locked the door yet, maybe she could distract him somehow make him forget to lock it then she could get out. She knew he liked to run just as much as her maybe she could tempt to running. Nikki opened the door to see if she could make a run for it. \" Garrison why are you doing this?\" Nikki asked \"you know I can't cause trouble.\" \"You promise me you won't do anything?\" Garrison asked. \"Promise\" Nikki said \"even if I did I would most likely be killed by my own father.\" \"That's a good point\" Garrison said \"Alright then\" Garrison gave chase leaving the door unlocked. Nikki took off running even though she promised to stay. She had to go after the guy she loved and she took ways that none of her pack would even think of and she hoped that she could get to him first. Meanwhile Ryan was still limping and running. Garrison had hurt him when he grabbed him but not before Ryan was able to get away and get a secret weapon, he was glad he had got that book he knew this legend well, though what he didn't understand was Nikki's involvement in all this. Members of pack-family were beginning to shift in leaps as they ran. Nikki continued to run hoping that she could get ahead of the pack and get to him. Ryan began to mark the trees with the blood on his wrists hoping that it would distract them a bit. He would figure out what was going on with Nikki later right now he had to stay alive. Nikki began to shift to her wolf form now because she knew she would be a bit faster than as a human. Nikki thought that he would be easy to catch but he wasn 't. A wolf was getting too close to Ryan and he had to start using his secret weapon, silver dust from his film room. He threw it in the wolf's eyes and kept going. Nikki was nearby and smelt fur burning. She came upon one of her many cousins one she didn't know. His eyes were burned away. He was dead. Nikki was soon gaining on Ryan. Nikki made it to him. \"Another one?\" Ryan called \"Didn't you see what I did to your friend?\" Ryan held out the silver powder. Nikki had to do something to get him to know it was her but she wasn't sure how to do that. \"Something wrong wolfy?\" Ryan asked \"Come and get me\" Ryan still held the powder. Nikki just stood there staring at him and then she got in front of him hoping he would follow her if she ran. Garrison chose that time to come onto the scene. He made a jump for Ryan who threw the dust into him but it splashed out and hit Nikki in the leg. The sliver burned her skin and she knew that Garrison probably wouldn't survive and that she would soon begin to shift back. Nikki began changing back to human. Nikki was scared now because she knew that she would soon be in danger if her father found out she had disobeyed. Ryan saw that the wolf he had just hit was the man that took him before but the white one... \"Nikki?\" Ryan asked falling to her side \"You're one of them?\" He could see that she was getting weak now. \"I am sorry I didn't tell you\" Nikki said weakly. \"Its alright now\" Ryan said \"Come on lets get out of here\" He saw that the lake was in fact close by now. He went to pick her up. \"Ok\" Nikki said weakly and she even gave a weak smile. Ryan picked her up and barely made it across the river before another wolf started the attack. Nikki knew that one was her father, He looked at what had became of Garrison and sneered but began to weep and seemed to let them go for now. Nikki was glad to be with Ryan. \"We need to get rid of my father if we are to be together\" Nikki said weakly. \"Don't talk like that\" Ryan said \"First we need to find a way to get you safe.\" \"How can we do that?\" Nikki asked weakly. \"If we go to my film studio I don't think they will follow\" Ryan said \"At least not right now they seem to be mourning the ones I killed.\" \"True\" Nikki said \"also what can we do to keep me from getting weaker?\" \"We just need to mend that leg and then cover up your mouth so you don't breathe any of the silver in the studio\" Ryan said ripping his shirt to cover her leg. \"Ok\" Nikki said as she let him do what he needed. Ryan sat her on the bed he had in his studio when he couldn't make it home and then went to bard the windows. Nikki was feeling better now and she hoped that this would work. \"What will the silver that I got in the air now I doubt they will come in here\" Ryan said \"We should be safe for the moment.\" Nikki gave a nod to let him know she heard. Nikki was getting sleepy and so she laid down on the bed and fell asleep. Ryan smiled and just watched her as she slept. She was even more beautiful then before. He didn't want to disturb her so he just let her rest but he so badly wanted to be close to her, he didn't know why. Nikki just slept until the sun had gone down. Ryan was sitting in a chair next to the bed but was about to fall asleep himself. He nodded off and fell from the chair hitting some of the tape cases he had, they clattered on the floor. Ryan winced and looked to Nikki. Nikki looked at him and she had a smile on her face. \"I'm sorry to wake you\" Ryan said with a yawn \"I must have nodded off.\" \"I was already awake\" Nikki said. \"You feeling better?\" Ryan asked. \"Yes\" Nikki said. Ryan yawned again and still looked to Nikki in the bed. \"How far are we from the house?\" Nikki asked. \"Whose?\" Ryan asked \"Mine?\" \"Yes yours\" Nikki said. \"Not too far\" Ryan said \"But wouldn't they be looking for us there? Or do you think they would be mourning for the rest of the night?\" \"Ok\" Nikki said \"And yea they would look for us there especially my father.\" \"Do you still want to go there?\" Ryan asked \"I mean so you can be away from the silver?\" \"I should be fine here\" Nikki said \"because if I went to your house I know my father might find me there.\" Ryan shook his head to try and keep awake, he knew that the bed could hold them both but didn't know exactly what Nikki would think or what she would do. Nikki was wide awake now and she didn't know if she could go back to sleep. \"If you want to sleep you can because I will keep watch\" Nikki said. \"I guess your awake now huh?\" Ryan asked moving towards the bed. \"Yes I am\" Nikki said. Ryan got into the bed and laid down. For the moment Nikki was beside him on the bed and she saw just how tired he was. Nikki had moved from the bed now so she could walk around. She kept the cover that Ryan had gave her over her mouth so as not to breathe in the silver and she found some of his journals and old movies. Ryan had began snoring softly now. Nikki wanted to watch the movies but she didn't want to wake him. As she looked around she found that one of the players for the movies had a headset hook up. And nearby was in fact a headset. She could listen to them without him hearing. Nikki had went and watched some of the movies and she liked them all. \"Ryan has done a good job with these movies\" She whispered. Soon she came across a movie titled 'Ryan's continuing auto-biography.' Nikki had put it in and she watched it. It started off with Ryan's face and him narrating. It told of the disagreement he had with his father and when he ran away from home to pursue a film career that his dad didn't approve of. It told of his failed attempts of getting a good relationship with ladies and how much he wished that just one would care for him. And it told of his fascination with legends and wolves. Nikki cared for him now and she was grateful that he knew a lot about wolves and legends. Soon the movie was over and Ryan was beginning to stir just a little not to wake up, he seemed restless. Nikki couldn't really blame him after what he had been through. Nikki had went to sit on the bed now with him to make sure he would be ok. Ryan turned a little bit towards her when she sat down. She knew even as he slept that he wanted her to be as close to him as possible. Nikki stayed by him all night. When Ryan awoke he found Nikki sitting near him. He realized how close he had laid to her. \"Sorry about that\" He said quickly \"I don't know why you sat there but I tend to be restless at night.\" \"I came over here after I watched a few of your tapes\" Nikki said. \"You did huh?\" Ryan asked remembering what he had over there \"Which ones do you remember by name?\" \"Your autobiography and both of the underworlds\" Nikki said. Ryan sighed \"So you know alot about my lame life now huh?\" He turned over to sit on the bed and look at her. \"Yes\" Nikki said. \"I never even had a good relationship with a woman\" Ryan said. \"Now you do\" Nikki said. Ryan looked at her. Nikki could tell that he was a little surprised that she actually wanted to stay with him. \"You want to stay even after what I did your other pack members?\" Ryan asked. \"Yes I want to stay\" Nikki said \"you have been there for me when no one else was.\" Ryan sat up and looked into her eyes. He couldn't really stop himself anymore he hugged her tightly now. Nikki hugged him tightly now. Ryan wished that she didn't have to keep her mouth covered cause of the silver. He wished they had another safe place to go. Nikki wondered what else they could do because she knew that if she left she could be killed by her own family. \"Do you think they would look for you at your hideout?\" Ryan asked \"Did they know about it?\" \"I guess we could make it there\" Nikki said \"The only one that I think knew about it was Garrison.\" \"He was one of the ones I killed wasn't he?\" Ryan asked getting up to go. \"Yes he was\" Nikki said. \"Let's go then\" Ryan said now that he was ready to go there. Nikki got up and she was ready to go now. They headed out to the place where Nikki always went to see the prince. Once they were out of the photo studio Nikki pulled the mouth cover away. \"It feels good to breathe fresh air again\" Nikki said. Soon they made it to her place. Nikki was glad that they made it without any of the others after her. Ryan was looking into Nikki's eyes now. \"How many people did you ever go out with?\" Ryan said \"You probably had a lot better relationships then I did.\" \"Garrison was the only one that I was to go out with\" Nikki said. \"I guess they don't want you going out with the human kind huh?\" Ryan asked \"You are beautiful though.\" \"No they didn't if we were to date it had to be within the pack\" Nikki said \"and thank you.\" \"You don't think that matters now do you?\" Ryan asked \"You are going to be with me no matter what they say right?\" \"No it don't\" Nikki said \"I have already left them and they most likely will kill me if I go back.\" Ryan looked around now. He seemed quiet and peaceful here, at least for now. In this light Nikki was almost more beautiful then when he first saw her. And just as hard to resist. Nikki was looking around now and she was glad that she was safe with Ryan and in the light she could see how handsome he was. Ryan saw how she was looking at him now \"What?\" He asked simply. \"I never realized how handsome you were\" Nikki said. \"Whatever you say\" Ryan said \"But thanks\" Ryan could just kiss her right now but he didn't know what she would think. Nikki wanted to kiss him but she didn't know what to do. \"I care about you\" Ryan said suddenly \"Your the first girl that has seen that autobiography and not laughed.\" \"I care about you to\" Nikki said \"your the first human that has seen the true me.\" \"At least the first one that didn't go running away screaming\" Ryan said moving closer to her. \" \"So what do we do now?\" He asked softly close to her face. \"I don't know\" Nikki said \"What do you do with someone you love?\" Ryan blushed at that. He didn't expect her to admit to that so quickly. He moved closer to her almost getting lost in her eyes. \"I don't know\" He whispered softly \"What would you want to do?\" \"I don't know\" Nikki said. Ryan moved closer to Nikki and put his arms around her. \"Your going to leave your family behind right?\" Ryan asked softly locking eyes with her. At that moment Nikki's father was watching from the high balcony of the building. The two hadn't seen or heard him come in. \"Yes\" Nikki said \"I want to be with you since you know how to treat me.\" \"What's to know\" Ryan said with a smile \"I treat you how you want to be treated.\" \"True\" Nikki said \"you treat me more like a princess than my family does.\" \"I wouldn't treat you as a princess unless you wanted it\" Ryan said \"But I do love you.\" \"You already do\" Nikki said \"and I love you too.\" His keen sense of hearing allowed him to hear all that they were saying and it just made him madder. His voice boomed over them \"You would love the killer of your mate?\" He called to them. \"Father\" Nikki said \"Yes I would because I never liked Garrison.\" \"Love can grow from anything even hate\" Her father called \"I thought you had learned this lesson and if your going to fall in love with another it should at least be of your kind, not with a meatstack.\" \"This meatstack as you called him has been a lot nicer to me than the pack\" Nikki said. \"Not to mention this so called meatstack was able to beat two of that same pack without much trouble\" Ryan called up to him. \"You stay out of this human!\" Her father boomed jumping from the balcony and shifting as he went. He growled and then charged at Ryan knocking him to the wall. \"Father leave him alone\" Nikki said shifting as well. \"Back off Nikki\" Ryan called \"I'll handle him\" Ryan rolled across the wall knocking her father against one of covered candle lights. It shattered against the stone floor catching the carpet on fire. Nikki's dad recoiled from the flame and Ryan remembered that fire also weakened them. \"Nikki back off!\" Ryan called again not wanting to hurt her but knocking her back to where she had shifted. Ryan grabbed at a part of the tapestry wall and caught the end on fire and waved in Nikki's father's face. \"Come and get me\" Her father growled and watched the flame trying to get his opening. Nikki had shifted back to human now even though she couldn't help much. \"Ryan be careful\" Nikki said \"my father is powerful.\" He caught an opening in the flame and charged again knocking it from his hand to stone floor again. Ryan was knocked to the wall. Nikki knew the effect of fire on her kind and saw that if she took that flame and lit the right part of the tapestry the whole place would soon burn down. If she could find some way to trap her father and do that to building she would be set There was a large rug on the ground near them as well. Perhaps she could wrap him up in it. Nikki didn't know what else to do now so she tried everything she could do. She was able to trap her father in the rug and Ryan sat it ablaze. Nikki then was able to light the part of the tapestry that would destroy the whole building. Ryan ran to grab Nikki's hand as her father was trying to rid himself of his flaming rug screaming the whole time. \"Let's get out of here\" Ryan called as he grabbed her hand. \"Good Idea\" Nikki said as she ran. As soon as they were outside the building the flames burst through the windows and they turned to see that the palace had been decimated. Nikki could still hear her father's screams. \"That was close\" Nikki said \"but at least we can be together now.\" \"That is a great thing\" Ryan said. \"Yes it is\" Nikki said as she got to think about her family. Ryan saw the look that she had on her face \"You worried about them?\" He asked. \"Yea because they don't have a leader now\" Nikki said. \"Do you think you will make a good leader?\" Ryan asked \"Or do you want to lead them even?\" \"I don't think I will even be welcomed anymore not since we killed my father\" Nikki said. \"That's a good idea\" Ryan said. Nikki couldn't help to worry about her family even though she was with the person she loved. \"We will come back one day\" Ryan said \"For now we should go on our own.\" \"Where do we go?\" Nikki asked a little saddened. \"My dad had a cabin and because of how long I have been gone he won't expect me to go back there\" Ryan said \"Nor would he come by.\" \"Where is it?\" Nikki asked. \"In the mountains\" Ryan said \"About a three day hike or one and a half day drive.\" \"What about clothes and things?\" Nikki asked. \"First we go to my place and get them\" Ryan said \"I don't know about your clothes and stuff though.\" \"I don't have anything but this dress\" Nikki said. \"Don't you have nightgowns that you would want to keep?\" Ryan asked. \"No\" Nikki said. \"So you sleep in the dress too?\" Ryan asked. \"Yes\" Nikki said \"when we change this is the only thing we can wear and the guys only wear pants.\" \"Ok then we will have to get you some clothes then\" Ryan said. \"That would be good\" Nikki said \"I need new clothes.\" \"Of course I think you would probably choose the clothes for yourself\" Ryan said. \"I will\" Nikki said. \"I wouldn't want to get you something you didn't like\" Ryan said. \"True\" Nikki said \"So where is the best place to get clothes?\" \"I will show you once we get up there\" Ryan said softly. \"Ok\" Nikki said \"lets get going.\" With that the two headed for the mountains. They stopped at a hotel for a while as they had to hike the whole way. Once he had the room Ryan led her to the room. \"This is great\" Nikki said \"a place we will be safe.\" \"I think so\" Ryan said blushing a little \"Though it only has one room.\" \"Its ok\" Nikki said. \"Are you sure?\" Ryan asked. \"Yes I am sure\" Nikki said. Ryan blushed again, \"It is ok that you sleep with me then?\" Ryan asked. \"Yes it will be fine\" Nikki said \"besides if we stay together we will have to get used to it.\" \"That's true\" Ryan said. Nikki went over to the bed and she sat down on it. \"So what do you think of having a lycan as a girlfriend?\" Nikki asked. \"It's interesting to say the least\" Ryan said softly a little shy about getting ready for bed. Nikki laid down now and she went to sleep and as she slept she kept thinking about her family. Ryan sighed when she fell asleep as quickly as she did. He went ahead and laid down next to her taking off his shirt as he always did. It took him a moment to get used to it but he was soon asleep himself. Nikki slept but a few times she woke up because she was scared and worried and she tried everything to relax but it wasn't helping. Nikki had gotten up off the bed and she went over to the window to look out. Ryan stirred as she moved. \"You alright?\" He asked sleepily looking at her. \"No\" Nikki said \"I keep thinking about my family even as I sleep.\" \"What do you want to do?\" Ryan asked. \"I don't know\" Nikki said \"my wolf part wants to go back but my human part wants to stay with you.\" \"Your nerves might just be tense about it\" Ryan said \"If you could relax somehow perhaps that would help your human side get more control.\" \"I don't know\" Nikki said. Ryan sat up on the bed \"If you don't mind that we try I could see if I can massage your shoulders to relax you\" Ryan said. \"Sure\" Nikki said as she walked back over to the bed and sat down on it. Ryan smiled softly and moved to behind her to gently massage her shoulders. Nikki could feel the tension leave her as he massaged her shoulders. Ryan felt just how tense she was and hoped that he was appealing to her touch. \"You were tense honey, at least from what I could tell at this point\" He said softly. \"I don't think I have ever been this tense\" Nikki said \"not unless we were on a hunt.\" Ryan smiled \"Can you still feel my hands well?\" He asked \"Even through the dress you have on?\" \"Yes I can\" Nikki said \"and it feels good.\" \"That's good\" Ryan said \"I didn't want you to have to remove that dress, I didn't want to offend you.\" \"It is ok\" Nikki said. Ryan was unsure for a moment, not knowing if she meant that she would remove her gown but guessing that she would considering what she had said before. Though he was too shy to say so. Nikki was feeling a bit better now that she seemed to almost fall asleep as he kept massaging her. \"Your scared aren't you?\" Ryan asked suddenly. \"I don't know\" Nikki said \"I am scared but I am also happy.\" \"I mean I would be scared to open up to if I had been through what you were\" Ryan said \"Did Garrison hurt you?\" \"I will open up to you if you like\" Nikki said \"and Garrison hurt me but it was mostly his words but nothing physical. \"I would like for you to open up to me\" Ryan said \"I want to learn everything about you and your life.\" \"You pretty much know all about me from the legends and what you have witnessed\" Nikki said \"I think I need a shower.\" \"Alright thats fine\" Ryan said \"Go right ahead, I need one too but I will get it later. I won't even watch you if you don't want me to.\" \"If you like we can take it together\" Nikki said. Ryan was a little shocked. \"I wasn't going to ask for that but I wouldn't mind\" He said softly. \"Neither do I\" Nikki said \"besides we got to get used to things like this.\" But that's not the only reason is it?\" Ryan asked \"I mean you want to do it too right?\" \"Yes I do\" Nikki said. Ryan stood up, \"I guess we need to get ready for that then\" Ryan said as he waited for Nikki to follow him to the bathroom and get ready. Nikki followed him to the bathroom where she undressed. Ryan was kind of shocked again as to how quickly she went into undressing but he smiled \"You have as beautiful a body as I thought you would\" He said softly as he began to undress himself. \"Thank you\" Nikki said as she got the water running. Ryan was undressed now and waited to see weather or not Nikki wanted to get in first or not. Nikki had gotten in first and she waited on Ryan. Ryan climbed in after her and stood behind her to watch as the water fell around her body. Nikki had let the water run down her body. Ryan smiled at her and reached for the soap to start lathering her up. \"Thanks\" Nikki said as she was washed up. Ryan smiled \"No problem its what I am here for\" He said softly gently moving to get under the water himself as soon as she was done rinsing. Nikki had climbed out of the tub now and she dried off and changed into a nightgown that Ryan had bought her. Ryan washed up quickly not wanting to miss the chance to be close to her just before she got into the nightgown. Nikki was getting ready to lay down when Ryan came in. \"Your quick my little wolf girl\" Ryan said smiling. \"Thank you\" Nikki said laying down. \"You don't mind me calling you wolf girl?\" Ryan asked. \"No I don't\" Nikki said \"I actually like the sound of it.\" \"That's cool\" Ryan said smiling and moving closer. Nikki had laid down now. Ryan smiled and gently climbed into the bed to lay down beside her. Nikki was falling asleep now. As she slept she could feel something wasn't right. \"You ok?\" Ryan asked. Nikki had woke up now. \"I don't know I just feel something isn't right\" Nikki said. \"You think your family is coming for you again?\" Ryan asked. \"I don't know\" Nikki said. \"What do you think we should do?\" Ryan asked. \"I guess I need to go back even though I don't want to\" Nikki said \"I need to see what is going on.\" \"Go back?\" Ryan asked \"Back to the pack?\" \"It looks that way\" Nikki said. \"If that is what you want to do\" Ryan said softly \"But you know its not going to be safe.\" \"Come back with me\" Nikki said \"I just need to see what is going on with the pack.\" \"Of course I will\" Ryan said, knowing full well that he would be the most in danger \"But I don't know how much help I will be.\" \"You just being there will help me\" Nikki said as she got ready to leave. Ryan smiled \"If you say so but before we leave I want to do one thing\" He said \"I may not get another chance\" He brought her closer to him and gave her a deep kiss. \"That's for good luck\" He whispered moving her hair from her face. \"Thank you\" Nikki said as she gave him a deep kiss. Once that was done the two of them left and went back to Nikki's pack. It didn't take them long to get back to the pack. Nikki saw that something bad WAS going on. All of her family was gathered together but she didn't see her uncle the pack leader. \"Mom\" Nikki said upset. \"We will have a new leader now\" Her mother spoke up \"My husband has died and my daughter....my daughter is gone. Who will rise up with my brother to take the reins of the alpha female?\" No one in the pack said anything. \"Mom\" Nikki called again. At that moment everyone in the pack turned towards her. \"How DARE you come back\" Her mother growled \"What are you doing back? And with HIM?\" She indicated Ryan who seemed more then shook up by her growls. \"I came back because I was worried\" Nikki said \"and I brought him back because I could and I am sorry that I even worried.\" \"Why should you be worried about our pain?\" Her mother called \"YOU caused it, you and that so called love of yours.\" \"I am sorry if you like I will just leave him and come back\" Nikki said. \"No!\" Ryan said suddenly brave \"I won't let you do that \"I am not a so called love, I do love her\" \"I love Nikki\" Her mother was silent now though the pack was still growling. \"Mom I am sorry for all I did\" Nikki said \"and I love Ryan more than I did Garrison.\" \"He's not one of us\" Her mother said somehow softer now. \"Mom Garrison tried to hurt me\" Nikki said \"and Ryan hasn't.\" \"That doesn't mean he won't find a way to hurt you\" Her mother said \"He's human you know what kind of creatures they are.\" \"I trust him\" Nikki said \"and I am sorry about what I did to dad.\" \"Just leave us alone child\" Her mother said on the verge of tears \"Your not one of us anymore.\" \"I am sorry\" Nikki said as her and Ryan left. Ryan followed Nikki. \"At least they didn't attack us\" He said softly. \"Yes I know but I hate leaving them\" Nikki said \"I need to be the Alpha Female but I am no longer welcome.\" \"Don't be like that\" Ryan said \"You don't have to be a leader maybe that is not your destiny or maybe we are meant to make our own family, our own pack.\" \"True\" Nikki said still upset. \"Besides even if leading that pack or a pack is your destiny\" Ryan said moving closer to her to place his hand under her chin \"Destiny can be changed.\" \"True I didn't think of that\" Nikki said. \"Let's go back for now\" Ryan said \"We could use the rest.\" \"Ok\" Nikki said as the two of them headed home. They soon found themselves in the same room they had left a few hours ago. Nikki had gotten ready for bed again. She was tired so she laid down and went to sleep. Ryan followed and laid close to her. Nikki had slept through the night. She continued to worry the next morning about her family and she wanted some way to have her family and Ryan get along. As she woke up she realized that Ryan wouldn't be the one that needed to be changed. It was her family. \"Ryan I am going back to talk to my family\" Nikki said \"I need to have my family get along with you.\" \"Alright\" Ryan said \"What do you want me to do?\" \"Just stay here please\" Nikki said as she got up and left again to head back to the pack. \"Mom would you guys please get along with Ryan because he knows about our kind.\" \"That's all the more reason for us not to like him\" Her mother said \"You know how we feel about humans.\" \"I know but if you just get to like him you will trust him just like I do\" Nikki said. \"You know how we feel about humans\" Her mom said. \"I know mom but if you just trust me he can help us and if nothing else I can change him into one of us\" Nikki said. \"You know that is impossible child\" Her mom said \"You have been reading too many human werewolf stories, you know it doesn't work that way.\" \"Then how do humans become werewolves?\" Nikki asked. \"They don't you know that\" Her mom said \"Werewolves are werewolves and humans are humans.\" \"Fine\" Nikki said \"so what can I do to get you guys to like him even though he is human?\" \"You've always been like that my child\" Her mother said \"Looking for the easy way, you need to learn to look deeper, to try harder, there isn't always an easy way to do things.\" \"I figured that out\" Nikki said \"so do you guys still need an Alpha Female?\" \"We do\" Her mother said. \"If you wouldn't mind me bringing Ryan and I will take the place as the alpha female\" Nikki said \"That is if you and the pack would have me and Ryan here.\" \"Not possible\" Her uncle said coming into view. \"Hello Uncle\" Nikki said as she bowed before him. \"Yes hello\" Her uncle said \"What is this I hear about you being the alpha female and bringing that boy here?\" \"I would like to take my place back in the pack\" Nikki said \"also Ryan knows everything about us and I can't just leave him alone I love him but I also love my family.\" \"I am sorry but you know that can't happen\" Her uncle said \"I hate to tell you but you will have to choose between being the Alpha Female or being with Ryan, you can't have both. If you take up your spot as Alpha Female you will be my female, and I won't have my mate with a human. Or you could bring Ryan here and we could learn to accept maybe\" He rolled his eyes \"But if you bring him here and still love him you cannot take your place.\" \"I understand\" Nikki said \"I guess I will have to leave him but can I at least say good bye to him.\" \"Selfish to a fault\" Her uncle said \"I like that in a female\" \"I knew that the love you had for that man wasn't real\" Her mother said. \"I do love him and if you love something you have to let it go\" Nikki said. \"This isn't exactly the same thing but if you wish to say good bye go ahead\" Her mother said \"Yes get that over with\" Her uncle added. \"Thank you\" Nikki said as she went to say good bye to Ryan for the last time. When she went to see Ryan she found him asleep. She knew that if she just left with no word that he would worry. Nikki wrote a letter but she knew that it would hurt him just as it was hurting her to write it. \"I am sorry Ryan\" Nikki whispered as she left. She soon arrived back at her parents home. \"We will begin the packing and ceremony in the morning\" Her uncle said \"It's good to have a lovely female\" He moved his hand through Nikki's hair. \"Thank you\" Nikki said as she went to her room. \"Up up\" Her uncle said \"Where are you going?\" \"I was going to go into my room and get packed if that is ok\" Nikki said. \"Your stuff is where it should be\" Her uncle said \"My room, I moved it there once I realized that you were actually going to go through with your choice of the pack over that boy.\" \"Thank you\" Nikki said. That morning Ryan woke up and he seen the letter that Nikki had left him. \"Dear Ryan I know this is hard but I had to go back to my pack I love you and I am sorry\" Love Nikki \"PS don't worry about looking for me.\" \"Oh yeah sure like that's going to stop me from coming after her\" Ryan said to himself. The morning came for Nikki's family and everyone was getting ready to change lairs so no one could find them again. \"Do you got everything packed my mate?\" Her uncle asked Nikki. \"Yes I do\" Nikki said \"I packed it all last night.\" \"That's my girl\" Her uncle said moving her hair from her face and ignoring the fact that she cringed at the thought of being 'his girl.' \"So where are we moving too?\" Nikki asked. \"I have found a new place\" Her Uncle said \"A place perfect for us leaving us Alphas some where private.\" \"Ok\" Nikki said. \"Let us leave and make it there before your meat comes calling\" Her uncle said. \"Sure\" Nikki said as she followed her Uncle and the rest of her pack. As they prepared to leave Nikki saw that her uncle was blindfolding everyone of the pack. \"Uncle what are you doing?\" Nikki asked. \"New pack rules\" He said \"No one leaves without my consent and no one is going to know where our new home is other then me\" He came to her with a blindfold. \"Ok\" Nikki said as she let him blindfold her. Nikki was fully blindfolded now \"We will be there soon\" He said. \"Alright\" Nikki said \"also what should I call you now?\" \"My mate perhaps or any kind of thing that would show that we care about each other\" Her uncle said \"So that the pack sees it that way.\" \"Would honey work?\" Nikki asked. \"If that is what you want\" Her uncle said. \"That would be best for me\" Nikki said \"I love you.\" Her uncle waved his hands \"That is not needed\" He said \"You won't love me nor would it matter.\" \"Why do you say that Uncle?\" Nikki asked. \"That is something to be said privately and we do not and will not love each other\" Her uncle said \"We are together by technicallity. And we are here\" He took off her blindfold. \"Ok Uncle\" Nikki said. Nikki found herself in a cave like lair now there were many around a central cave. No windows and solid stone walls. \"Wow this place looks cozy\" Nikki said. \"Cozy maybe not but Private that's the main thing\" Her uncle said. \"So where is our room?\" Nikki asked. \"Ours is in the center of course\" her uncle said. \"Ok\" Nikki said as she followed him to the room. \"Unpack your things and I will go check on the rest of the pack\" He told her as he left the room. Nikki had unpacked like her Uncle told her too. Her uncle still had not returned but she was able to look around the room and saw that it had a closet and dresser and a bed. It was strangely homey for a cave. \"This is a nice room\" Nikki said \"I am just glad that the pack accepted me back.\" \"And I am just glad I was able to catch you before you left\" Said a familiar voice, Nikki also recognized the smell. It was Ryan. \"What are you doing here?\" Nikki asked. \"I followed you\" Ryan said \"From your old den. I couldn't let you leave.\" \"You will be so dead if my uncle comes back\" Nikki said \"and I am sorry I left but I didn't know what else to do.\" \"Nikki do you love me?\" Ryan asked. \"I love you but I also love my family\" Nikki said. \"I'm not asking about your family\" Ryan said moving closer to her \"I am asking about me, do you love me?\" \"I don't know\" Nikki said \"I am torn between two worlds.\" Ryan slammed his hand against the dresser then sighed \"This stinks why can't they accept me?\" Ryan asked \"Why won't they listen?\" \"They would accept you if I gave up my position of Alpha Female\" Nikki said. Ryan understood now \"That's fine\" He said \"If you care about your status in some wolf pack then me go right ahead. Maybe you are more wolf then girl, wolf girl.\" At that point one of the other pack members came in \"What are you doing here?\" It was one of Nikki's cousins \"Don't worry I was just leaving\" Ryan ran out of the cave and vanished with her wolf ears Nikki could hear his soft cries of pain as he went away. Nikki was upset now because she loved Ryan but he was right she was more wolf than girl. \"Should I tell uncle that a human found us madam?\" The cousin asked \"I am sure that is not information we need to keep from our new leader.\" \"Tell him\" Nikki said \"I know whats going to happen we are going to have to move again.\" \"I wouldn't think so\" The cousin said \"Just one meatsack he'd probably kill it knowing him, I am sure he could get the scent it does stink in here\" The cousin started to leave now. \"He most likely would\" Nikki said. \"And you still want him to go through with it?\" The cousin asked \"That meatstack's scent made it almost seem like it loved you or something.\" \"He does love me\" Nikki said. \"And you don't love him?\" The cousin asked \"Of course you don't that's stupid to ask its not like he is that meatstack you left behind before.\" \"Actually cus he is\" Nikki said. \"And your ok with him dying?\" The cousin asked \"Wow I heard love is rough but gee that's kind of harsh.\" \"No I don't want to see him die\" Nikki said \"I just don't know what to do I am torn between two worlds.\" \"I could get eaten for this but I sense your pain cousin\" The cousin said \"Perhaps it would be best if uncle didn't know he was here. At least for now.\" \"Thanks cousin just keep this between us please\" Nikki said. \"If you say so\" The cousin said taking his leave to leave Nikki alone in the room again. Nikki was in the room alone now and she laid down on the bed now. \"Is everything ok?\" Her mother came in now. \"I don't know\" Nikki said \"I am torn between love for a boyfriend and love for family.\" \"My child\" Her mother said \"You can have both, even your uncle told you that.\" \"If I do that then I can't be the Alpha Female\" Nikki said \"and we really need one.\" \"We do\" Her mother said \"But honey it doesn't have to be you.\" \"No one else will do it\" Nikki said. Her mother sighed \"You didn't give them a chance to even ask you don't know that and besides I think your uncle might want a female that he at least somewhat loves as a mate?\" \"I guess so\" Nikki said \"I guess I need to find Ryan and apologize to him.\" \"I don't think so\" Her uncle came in now \"Sorry my mate but he lost out, and I don't want to have to look for another.\" Nikki looked at her mom for help. \"You don't need to play games with this child's heart\" Her mother said standing up to face him \"Don't even try...\" Her uncle stopped her. \"I am the leader now, you all listen to me.\" \"You are so much like dad that I don't like it\" Nikki said as she attacked her uncle. \"Get off of me!\" Her uncle growled and knocked her against the wall hurting her shoulder and ankle \"I don't want to have to force you but I will have order. MATE!\" \"Fine\" Nikki said \"I am sorry.\" \"That's better\" Her uncle said \"Now\" He pointed to her mother \"You. Bed. I would like us all to get some rest we have a big hunt tomorrow.\" Her mother then got up and left making sure Nikki was alright as she walked out. \"I will be fine\" Nikki whispered to her mom. Nikki had laid down on the bed now and went to sleep. \"Up up wake\" her uncle called as soon as she laid her head down. \"Yes Uncle\" Nikki said \"What do you need?\" \"Perfect just what I wanted to hear\" Her uncle said \"Stand up and move to the front of the foot board.\" Nikki did what she was told. \"What do you want me to do now uncle?\" Nikki asked. \"Put this on\" He called to her, \"I won't have my mate wearing some pup's pajamas\" He handed her a more skin revealing and tight night attire. Nikki had took her other clothes off and put on the night attire that her uncle gave her. Her uncle watched with prying eyes. \"That's better\" He said laying down himself now. Nikki had went over and laid down now with him. He was asleep quickly and didn't do anything else. Nikki had fallen asleep now. As the night went on Nikki she woke up and couldn't go back to sleep so she got up and went to find her mom. Her mom was asleep in a nearby room though when Nikki entered she noticed that from here her room with her uncle was out of view completely. Her mom had just got ready to sleep. \"Mom\" Nikki said softly. \"Nikki?\" Her mom looked at her now \"Are you ok? What is that you have on?\" \"Its something Uncle made me wear\" Nikki said \"but the reason I came in here was to thank you for standing up for me.\" \"Your my daughter\" Her mother said \"And I love you, you should be able to risk everything for some one you love.\" \"But what do I do I need to apologize to Ryan\" Nikki said \"but I can't leave Uncle to go and apologize to him.\" \"Why can't you leave your uncle my daughter?\" Her mother asked moving closer now. \"I leave him now and he will flip out and most likely destroy you\" Nikki said. \"No he won't destroy me\" Her mother said \"He needs me. Child do you fear your uncle more then you love that boy?\" \"I don't know\" Nikki said \"I guess I am scared of him but I also love Ryan.\" \"Again I ask do you love him more then you fear your uncle?\" Her mother asked \"Remember what I said before about risking it all for love?\" \"Yes I love him more than I fear my uncle\" Nikki said. \"Then go to him\" Her mother said \"Don't worry about your uncle if you get back quick enough maybe he won't notice.\" \"Alright I will do it\" Nikki said \"and thanks mom.\" \"No problem\" Her mom said \"Go for it honey.\" Nikki had run out of the cave and went to find Ryan. It didn't take long for her to pick up his scent, he wasn't far away. \"Ryan\" Nikki said. She soon found him sitting on a rock in the woods not far from the caves he staggered when he saw her \"Stay away\" He said quickly \"What do you want now?\" \"I came here to apologize\" Nikki said. \"Really?\" Ryan asked still keeping his distance \"And why is that?\" \"Because I love you\" Nikki said \"and my mom told me to risk it all for love and that is what I am doing.\" \"You love your status more\" Ryan said \"Don't you?\" \"Then why Nikki?\" Ryan called to her \"Why did you leave me for the pack?\" \"Because I thought that is where I belonged\" Nikki said \"but I was wrong.\" \"Your saying you belong with me?\" Ryan asked. \"Yes\" Nikki said \"and I am sorry I left you I thought I could get the pack to like you but I don't know my mom seems to like you but the others don't.\" \"So why don't you give up your status?\" Ryan asked \"You said before that if you did that they would accept me right?\" \"The pack might but I don't think my uncle will\" Nikki said. \"Do you think we should just run ourselves?\" Ryan asked. \"No\" Nikki said as she was wondering if she should leave him and get back to her uncle or stay. Ryan moved closer to her \"I won't let you run again\" He said \"If you go back I will.\" \"If I don't go back my uncle will have a cow\" Nikki said \"you know I don't like to run but I have to.\" \"Actually you love to run\" Ryan said smiling. \"I mean I don't like to run from you but I have to\" Nikki said. \"No!\" Ryan said \"I won't let you do it again! I don't care what the risks are I won't lose you again.\" \"Alright I won't run again\" Nikki said. \"You don't know what your heart wants do you?\" Ryan asked. \"I guess not\" Nikki said \"but I know one thing I do love you.\" \"Then run with me\" Ryan said \"If something happens with your family it happens, we will be able to deal with it.\" \"Ok\" Nikki said \"I will run with you.\" Ryan moved closer to her and offered her his hand. Nikki took his hand. Ryan soon walked with her back to a new home that he had found. \"We can stay here for the night and run further tomorrow.\" Ryan said \"Your family is quick we will have to make ground.\" \"We will tomorrow\" Nikki said. As the two talked Nikki felt someone watching her. \"Are you ok?\" Ryan asked. \"I will be\" Nikki said \"I just had a feeling someone else was around.\" \"Someone watching you?\" Ryan asked \"Who? A member of the pack?\" \"More like my uncle\" Nikki said. \"Don't you think he would have attacked by now if he was watching?\" Ryan asked \"He hates me right?\" \"That is true\" Nikki said. \"Maybe your being paranoid?\" Ryan suggested \"Don't worry about the pack if they come they come, their not going to sneak up on us at least not one of them anyway.\" \"Who knows\" Nikki said \"and they always hunt in a pack but my dad or uncle.\" \"Exactly\" Ryan said \"I do have one question though, you don't seem comfortable in that get up\" Ryan indicated the tight night garments she was still wearing even though she had her mothers robe over them. \"No I am not comfortable in it\" Nikki said. \"No I am not comfortable in it\" Nikki said. \"My uncle made me wear it\" Nikki said. \"Here\" Ryan said \"He handed her one of her old nightgowns that she had left behind. \"Thank you for this\" Nikki said as she changed out of her outfit she had on and into the new one. \"No problem\" Ryan said Nikki noticed that he had kept his eyes to himself unlike the prying eyes of her uncle. \"Lets go home\" Nikki said \"I am tired.\" \"We are\" Ryan said smiling \"Remember this is where we are staying the night before we move on in the morning.\" \"True\" Nikki said as she laid down. Ryan gently laid down beside her and waited to see if she would fall asleep. Nikki had fallen asleep now and she was glad to be safe. Ryan smiled and went to sleep himself. When Nikki awoke she was not safe, she was tied to a chair in the middle of another cave her uncle staring her down \"It's about time you woke up\" He said sternly. \"Uncle I am sorry\" Nikki said. \"Yeah yeah yeah save it for someone who cares\" Her uncle said \"I plan on keeping you here for a long time.\" \"Whatever\" Nikki said as she spat at him. \"Well now you just grew a backbone\" Her uncle said \"Your in no position to be acting that way. You better take a closer look at yourself.\" Nikki looked around as best she could and realized that not only was she tied up but she was also stripped down. \"Why don't you and your traditions go to hell\" Nikki said \"I don't want to be the Alpha Female now.\" \"Too bad you should have thought of that before you made your choice\" her uncle said \"now I will have to force you to get my heir, I had hoped that you would warm up to me.\" \"Whatever\" Nikki said. \"I didn't want to have to show you this...\" Her uncle said \"Bring him in.\" Other members of the pack, Nikki noticed some were Garrison's old gang, brought in Ryan tied up and gagged as he had been before on the hunt. \"What do you say now?\" He asked. \"I will give you an heir just let him go please\" Nikki said. \"No no\" her uncle said \"He stays, you stay, I get an heir. You both go free.\" \"Ok whatever you want I will give you\" Nikki said. \"Now then\" Her uncle said a devilish smile on his face \"Leave us\" The others dropped Ryan to the floor and he grunted under the pain. He stripped before her and forced himself on her. Ryan could hear it all but do nothing to stop it. Nikki was screaming as this was going on. Ryan struggled but couldn't do nothing against it. Her uncle stopped and left her against the wall before shurging his shoulders and putting his clothes back on. \"Now we wait a week or so and see what happens\" He said. \"Yes Uncle\" Nikki said \"may I lay down now?\" \"Of course\" He said a little too gently before he cut the ropes that still bond her causing her to fall to the floor. \"There you are\" He said and left the room. \"Ouch\" Nikki said as she just laid on the floor. Nikki was free now and the room was bare other then her chair, the remains of the ropes that held her, and Ryan. She had no windows and the only door to the room was pad locked. With both a key and a combination lock it seemed. \"Ryan I am so sorry\" Nikki said \"I didn't want this to happen.\" She had gotten up finally and went over to untie him and take off his blindfold. When Nikki went to untie him she realized that it wasn't rope, this time, it was chains which had another lock. Ryan wasn't going anywhere. \"He hurt you\" Ryan said when he was finally able to see and talk \"He hurt you and I couldn't do anything.\" \"I don't blame you\" Nikki said \"it was my fault for even thinking I could get away with going to see you.\" Nikki wondered if she could use her wolf's claw to pick the lock. \"Don't say that\" Ryan said \"We will figure a way out of here. Somehow...\" As Nikki looked at the lock closer it was as big as her claws. Her plan might work... Nikki had shifted to her wolf form now and she used her claw to pick the lock. \"Careful\" Ryan said and soon he was actually released. And ran to the door, \"Damn this one has both a combination and a key hole. What do we do now?\" Nikki had decided to switch back to being a human again. A couple of minutes later she was human again. \"I don't know what to do\" Nikki said \"there is no way I can pick those locks.\" \"He said that he planned on keeping us here right?\" Ryan asked \"That means he's got to come feed us don't you think, we won't last long if he don't.\" \"Yes he did\" Nikki said \"and he must if he wants me to stay healthy.\" \"Well he also knows that mentally you wouldn't be ok if something happens to me\" Ryan said \"I also know that he is not the type to do the dirty work.\" \"True\" Nikki said \"and if I lose his heir who knows what would happen.\" \"Let's hope you don't got an heir\" Ryan said. \"If I know him he will keep trying until I do carry his heir\" Nikki said. \"Not if we get away before he is sure if he has one\" Ryan said. \"What do you have in mind on getting us out of here?\" Nikki asked. \"Well he is not going to come here to feed us\" Ryan said \"He will send someone else and we use that person to get us out. You said the pack still cares of me right?\" \"Yea\" Nikki said \"At least I know my mom does.\" \"He wouldn't send your mom\" Ryan said \"But he would send a female, He would be too scared of another male surcoming to temptation.\" \"True\" Nikki said \"plus my mom may already be in trouble for helping me out.\" \"That's true we will have to look for her when we get out\" Ryan said. \"We will\" Nikki said \"I am not leaving without my mom this time.\" \"Now here is the plan\" Ryan said \"We will wait for someone to come feed us then I will act hurt and you tell them that I am not used to being confined like this it would probably be a good idea to loosen my chains, when they come to do so I will grab them and we will run out the door, that is if they leave it open.\" \"Lets hope it works\" Nikki said as they waited for some one to come and feed them. Ryan got back into his chains but didn't lock them and waited as well. Soon enough a girl, one of Nikki's younger cousins. Dana, came in with food. \"Are you ok?\" She asked gently. \"I am but I don't know about Ryan\" Nikki said \"He is not used to being confined like this.\" Ryan coughed a bit and leaned his head towards the floor \"Is there anything I can do to help?\" Dana asked. \"Let us out for a bit\" Nikki said \"also how are you and everyone holding up?\" \"I can't let you out\" Dana said \"Uncle would kill me but maybe I could do something else?\" Dana seemed a little nervous now. \"Can you loosen his chain?\" Nikki asked. \"Maybe\" Dana said \"But I don't have the key\" Dana moved closer to Ryan before he jumped at her and threw the chains around her. \"I am sorry to do this child\" He said quickly as he tied her up \"But I am sure someone will come for you\" \"Nikki you can't do this\" Dana cried \"Uncle will kill you, maybe even kill us all.\" \"I have an idea\" Nikki said \"Dana are you up to helping me get rid of Uncle?\" Dana shook her head \"No no no\" She cried \"That won't work. He's too strong. And he does what he wants.\" Dana looked away and Ryan gasped gently \"He hurt you too, didn't he?\" He whispered \"Maybe not the same as Nikki but he hurt you too\" Dana didn't even look at him. \"Dana tell us did he hurt you?\" Nikki asked. Dana moved the chains from her arms as best she could, she wasn't strong and revealed her upper shoulder, there was a bruise in the shape of a hand, a large hand, there. \"How many others has he hurt?\" Nikki asked softly as she went and sat by her cousin. \"Most of them\" Dana said \"But only the girls. Nikki do you know how long you were out? Almost three full days. Auntie is worried about you. And uncle he said if I don't come in here and feed you and the man that he will hurt Dina.\" \"I have had it with him hurting my pack\" Nikki said \"he has hurt me for the last time.\" \"Dana go tell Auntie that I am fine please\" Nikki said \"I will figure out some way to bring him down.\" \"No\" Dana said quickly \"I can't do that. That was the biggest thing if Auntie figured out what really happened or if you guys got out. Then he would...he would...\" Dana laid down in the floor to cry. \"I'm sorry Dina\" She whispered \"I was too weak.\" \"Dana listen to me please your not weak\" Nikki said \"I am tired of him treating the pack like this I have to do something its my fault that Uncle is in charge and not dad.\" \"Just leave me\" Dana cried loudly \"Get out of here! If he finds me passed out on the floor then maybe he won't blame me, and then maybe...maybe Dina will be safe.\" \"Dana I can't just leave you here and take the blame\" Nikki said. \"Nikki go!\" Dana yelled \"Leave now!\" Nikki could hear footsteps with her keen ears coming closer \"Maybe we should leave\" Ryan said. Nikki and Ryan left. Nikki thought to herself she had to do something to save her family from this evil creep. \"Nikki\" Ryan said \"Go to wolf your faster and it would better then running through the forest naked.\" \"Right\" Nikki said as she began to switch. Ryan kept up as best he could but before long he was too tired and weak from lack of food to run anymore. Nikki waited for him she wanted to tell him he could ride her for a bit but she didn't know how. Ryan was soon close to her but leaned against the rocks. \"I...can't...run...anymore\" He said. Nikki knew if she got close enough he might lean against her. Nikki went over to him to see if he would lean on her. Ryan didn't at first but realizing that Nikki wasn't going a way he did lean and held on to her. Nikki had walked a little ways with him holding on to her. \"You can carry me?\" Ryan asked. Nikki couldn't say anything to him but she was able to carry him and once they made it to a safe place Nikki had switched back to human. \"Thank you\" Ryan said softly. \"No problem\" Nikki said now fully human. \"I have to find a way to save my family and my pack\" Nikki said. \"Nikki will you quit calling them that\" Ryan said \"There just as much people as wolves, I see that now. They are not \"your pack\" they should just be \"your family.\" \"Your right\" Nikki said \"I see that now.\" \"Now how do we get him\" Ryan said \"First we need energy to do it with and then we can beat him.\" \"Can you still hunt?\" Ryan asked. \"I should be able too\" Nikki said. \"Well I was a boy scout a long time ago I should be able to prepare it if you can catch it\" Ryan said \"Let's get some food in our bellies before we try to think of a plan to ruin your uncle.\" \"I will try and catch something for us to eat\" Nikki said \"Mind you I have never really caught and animal before.\" \"Well its always good to try\" Ryan said smiling \"It's not like we are counting on it or anything.\" \"Alright be back in a flash\" Nikki said as she took off to look for some deer or something they could eat. Ryan smiled and sat down in the grassy meadow that they had found and waited. Nikki soon came upon a small doe grazing peacefully. Nikki did what she had to do to catch it. Ryan kept watch and soon saw Nikki in wolf form with blood on her lips coming back to him with a doe in her mouth. \"Wow now that I didn't expect for a first catch\" Ryan said softly. Nikki had laid it down in front of him and she switched back. \"Neither did I\" She said \"but I did it.\" \"Well this is going to take a while to prepare\" Ryan said \"You will have to watch for danger because I doubt that they haven't started looking for us and with their senses it won't take long.\" \"I will keep an eye out for danger\" Nikki said. Ryan prepared it and Nikki didn't see any danger or hear any danger coming. It was strange she knew that they would be coming for them and yet she couldn't hear, see, or sense them in anyway.\"Maybe they gave up on us\" Nikki said. \"I wouldn't count on it\" Ryan said \"They are probably just waiting and biding their time. The food is done. Let's eat quickly and then come up with a plan of action.\" \"Ok\" Nikki said as she sat down and started to eat. Ryan ate and the two realized that Dana had been right they hadn't ate in a long time. \"At least this will keep our energy up\" Ryan said softly. \"That is true\" Nikki said \"So any ideas on what to do to get my family away from my Uncle?\" Ryan sighed \"We will find a way to defeat your uncle as we did your father and save your family \" Ryan said emphasizing family. \"We have to they are the only family I have until now\" Nikki said as she ate some more of the meat. \"I will do whatever it takes to save them\" Ryan said \"I know you care about them and won't be happy until they are safe.\" \"I just can't see them hurt anymore\" Nikki said \"and that is true.\" \"I know\" Ryan said moving closer to her to see if she would accept a hug. She accepted the hug. \"Thank you for always being there for me\" She said. \"Your welcome\" Ryan said \"And you know I love you and I hate to see you in pain or worried.\" \"I love you too\" Nikki said \"and at least you know how I feel.\" \"Well I am done eating and I got a plan\" Ryan said smiling. \"What is your plan?\" Nikki asked. \"You guys don't like fire or silver right?\" Ryan asked. \"Right\" Nikki said \"fire and silver weaken us and fire can most likely kill us.\" \"As can silver if you ingest it\" Ryan said \"Do you know what your uncle cares about the most? I know he's evil but there has got to be something he cares about. Nikki thought back to the times when she was with her uncle before her father died and realized that he actually loved artwork and paintings, or at least he did before he became leader. \"He used to like artwork and paintings\" Nikki said. \"Ok do you think he still cares about them?\" Ryan asked \"I mean can we use them as bait?\" \"I don't know\" Nikki said \"he might.\" \"What do you think he would do if you went back right now?\" Ryan asked. \"Kill us most likely\" Nikki said. \"No no he wouldn't kill you, he wants you to give him an heir remember?\" Ryan said \"I am saying if you go back and not me. In fact what if you go back and he thinks that you killed me?\" \"He most likely accept me back\" Nikki said. \"Alright how swift are you with those claws?\" Ryan asked \"Can you cut only what you want to cut easily?\" \"I am not sure\" Nikki said \"I can try.\" \"Here\" Ryan said \"Cut this slab of skin but try and leave the meat intact.\" Nikki had switched into her wolf form and she did as she was told. Nikki was able to do what Ryan wanted her to be able to do. \"Perfect\" He said \"Now then\" He laid down on the ground \"This time I want you to cut some of my hair and intentionally get it trapped in the claws.\" Nikki did so and she was able to get some of his hair trapped in her claws. \"Good job\" Ryan said then he ripped the sleeve of his shirt and handed it to her \"Go back to your pack like this..\" He said \"If anyone asks tell them that you and me did not agree and you defeated me.\" Nikki took off towards her family now just like Ryan told her. It didn't take her long before she found herself back home. She found her cousin the same one that had brought Ryan into the room with her at guard. \"You came back again?\" He asked \"Do you have a death wish?\" Nikki had laid the sleeve down on the ground and she also showed him her claws. \"What happened to you?\" He asked. Nikki switched now \"Ryan and I had a disagreement and I defeated him\" Nikki said. \"Really?\" He said \"Well uncle will like the sound of that. Just come on back to his room and we will see what happens. He wanted us to see what would happen, that is why we didn't come after you.\" \"Ok\" Nikki said as she followed her cousin. Nikki followed him back to her uncle's room. \"Well now you came back\" Her uncle said. \"Yes I did uncle\" Nikki said as she showed him her hands and the sleeve. \"Now what happened between you and your meat stack\" He asked \"That can't be too healthy for him.\" \"We had a disagreement and I defeated him\" Nikki said. \"Really now?\" He asked \"What will you do?\" \"I guess if you will allow me to come back to you\" Nikki said. \"Well as far as that goes you can come back for now.\" He said \"At least until I get my heir\" He handed her some clothing like the one he had for her before. \"Cover up some, your too tempting for the others.\" \"Yes Uncle\" Nikki said as she put the clothes on. Nikki's uncle smiled at her. And the pack rested up for an up and coming hunt later that day. The prey wasn't anyone Nikki knew. Nikki had rested now and she wondered how Ryan was doing. About three days later Ryan had things set for the trap. He carefully made his way into the caves again. To Nikki's place of rest when her uncle was not there. \"I think its ready\" Ryan said \"He just needs a reason to go into town now.\" \"Ok\" Nikki whispered \"but what do we do to get him into town?\" \"I wouldn't know\" Ryan said \"Perhaps talk him into going to get supplies?\" \"I will try\" Nikki said \"I will tell him I need more clothes that he likes.\" Ryan cringed but nodded \"Alright\" He said. \"Its the best I have\" Nikki said. \"Well I better get out of here\" Ryan said \"Who knows what he would say if he saw me\" He moved closer to hug her again gently. Nikki smiled as he hugged her. \"Be safe ok\" Ryan said softly \"I am going to make things right.\" \"I will be\" Nikki said \"you be careful.\" \"I will\" Ryan said and he kissed her on the cheek before running from the caves again. About an hour later her uncle came back in. \"Uncle can we go to town and get me some more of those outfits you like?\" Nikki asked. \"You want more?\" He asked. \"Yes please\" Nikki said \"at least in a different color than black please.\" \"Alright\" He said \"I will go into town today to get you some white and pink ones.\" \"Uncle may I please go with you?\" Nikki asked. \"What for?\" Her uncle asked \"It's not like I don't know your size, why would you want to go?\" \"I feel safer with you\" Nikki said \"please let me go.\" \"Well...\" He started \"It's against my better judgment but I want to at least look happy for appearences so ok you can go.\" \"Thank you uncle\" Nikki said \"I apprecate it.\" \"Uh huh whatever\" her uncle said \"Get yourself ready to go and we will head out.\" Nikki had put on one of her outfits that her uncle liked. \"Uncle how is this?\" Nikki asked. \"That's fine\" He said \"Let's go.\" \"Yes uncle\" Nikki said as she followed him. It didn't take long for them to make it into town and once there her uncle went straight to clothing store that would have those forms of outfits. But as he was walking through the other stores he saw a sign \"Free art gallery and show. Come to Warehouse nine\" He didn't say anything when they passed the sign. Nikki followed him into the store. \"Uncle thanks again for letting me come\" Nikki said as she went and found a lavender outfit. \"Here is an outfit I like uncle\" Nikki said as she held it up for him. \"Yes yes\" Her uncle said though he didn't even look at it. He merely picked up ones that he liked and let her have the one that she had found. \"Let us pay for these.\" He said \"I want to quickly check out that art gallery so I don't have to stay in town long.\" \"Yes uncle\" Nikki said as she followed him to the check out. Soon enough they had made their way out and towards the warehouse nine. Once there, Nikki saw many peices of art most of them she actually regonized they were some of the painting and photos that Ryan had made and kept. \"Wow this is cool\" Nikki said as she walked around the gallery. \"Yes it is\" He said not too long after he had walked in and the door shut behind him. Nikki caught the scent of something very familiar and dear to her. Ryan was here. \"So do you like this?\" Nikki asked as she tried not to be too suspicious now. \"The artwork is good but I don't recognize the photos\" He said \"Do you know who took them my mate?\" \"No I don't\" Nikki said. \"It was me\" Ryan called coming into view \"Nikki get out of here. Now!\" \"You!\" Her uncle shifted to wolf quickly and charged. Ryan was ready for that and dodged. Nikki did so. Nikki heard the crashes of their fight inside the warehouse. \"I need to save my family\" Nikki said. Nikki was still outside the warehouse now and she could still hear the crashes and cries of pain from both her uncle and her love from the fight going on inside. \"I need to do something\" Nikki said as she wanted to help now. She knew that Ryan wouldn't like it but she ran in anyway. She found that Ryan was still fighting her uncle. Ryan was blooded, his shirt torn. Nikki could see her uncle was fighting with one eye blind. It seemed Ryan had been packing silver. Neither had noticed her walk in. Nikki had went in for an attack on her uncle now. She made a hit and they both fell against some of the other paintings. Ryan was right behind them. \"What are you doing Nikki?\" He cried \"I told you to leave.\" \"I know but I couldn't let you fight him alone\" Nikki said. \"We don't have a choice\" Ryan said \"I am glad these painting are just replicas\" Ryan held a match and tossed a heavy tapestry over her uncle. \"So am I\" Nikki said as she got ready to leave. Ryan let the fire which followed all around them as they left the warehouse. Nikki's uncle had burned just as her father had. \"I hated to do that\" Ryan said \"Again.\" \"I know\" Nikki said \"but it was the only way to get rid of him now lets go to my family please.\" \"Maybe now we can figure out a way to make things right\" Ryan said and he followed her. \"I hope so\" Nikki said as she headed towards her family. Once they were there they found the guards again and as Nikki and Ryan walked up they looked at her. \"I thought you defeated him?\" Her cousin asked \"And where is uncle?\" \"Uncle is gone\" Nikki said \"and all of what we did was just an act.\" \"So would you please let me pass\" Nikki said. \"Who defeated uncle?\" The cousin asked softly. \"Ryan did\" Nikki said \"with a bit of help from me.\" \"The human beat him?\" The cousin asked softly. \"Yes he did\" Nikki said \"at least no one else will be getting hurt.\" \"We don't have an heir\" The cousin said. \"That means that...\" He trailed off. \"That means that the whoever defeated our old leader is the new one\" Her mother came in saying. \"Ryan and I did mother\" Nikki said \"I am sorry but I just couldn't stand seeing anyone else get hurt like me and Dana did.\" \"A human is our new leader?\" The cousin asked. \"It seems like that\" Nikki said \"so would you guys would be ok with it?\" \"What is he going to do on the hunts?\" The cousin asked \"He wouldn't hunt a member of his own kind\" \"Perhaps we will change the hunts\" Her mother said. \"How would we do that mom?\" Nikki asked. \"Do you not have any ideas?\" Her mom asked looking to Ryan \"Me? Um I guess you could just have days when you run rather then run after something just run to enjoy it?\" \"I have an idea what about chasing animals\" Nikki said. \"That would work I suppose\" The cousin said saddened but he knew that he couldn't do anything about the current situation in the pack. \"I won't have the same sort of rules as your uncle\" Ryan said \"Just two rules...\" \"What are the rules?\" Nikki asked. \"Just two\" Ryan said \"Just honor your family and remember that you are all just as much human as wolf.\" \"Those are good rules\" Nikki said \"at least we know no one will get hurt.\" \"Exactly\" Ryan said \"I guess we should rest now and could someone mend my wounds?\" He said the last with a slight smile on his face. He was glad to have a family now. \"Mom would you be willing to do the honor of mending his wounds?\" Nikki asked. \"I taught you how to mend wounds child\" Her mother said \"Why don't you?\" \"Alright I will\" Nikki said as she did as her mother had taught her. Soon after Ryan was bandaged up and ready his wounds were ready to heal he walked with Nikki to her uncle's old room. \"Ryan I love you\" Nikki said \"and at least your the alpha male.\" \"Doesn't that make you the alpha female?\" Ryan asked. \"Yes it does\" Nikki said \"that is if the family accepts it.\" \"It seems like some of them feel like they don't have any choice in the matter\" Ryan said as he prepared to lay down now though he didn't know what it was going to be like to lay down in the bed of a man he killed. \"That is true\" Nikki said \"but who knows what they will do.\" \"Most of the pack follows the rules that the alpha male gives due to tradition right?\" Ryan asked. \"It seems to me that tradition had been broke\" Nikki said \"also I wonder how Dana and Dina are doing?\" \"Go and look for them while I rest if you like\" Ryan said smiling. \"Ok\" Nikki said as she went to look for her little cousins. Ryan rested on the bed as she left. It didn't take Nikki long to find her little cousins both were in the room with her mother. \"Hey mom Dana and Dina\" Nikki said. \"How is Ryan doing?\" Her mother asked. \"He is doing fine just resting now\" Nikki said. \"Are you ok too?\" Dana asked softly moving closer to Nikki. \"I am fine\" Nikki said \"how are you holding up Dana?\" \"I'm fine and Dina is too\" Dana said softly. Dina nodded gently. \"That is good\" Nikki said \"so what do you think of Ryan?\" \"He seems nice\" Dina said softly \"But granddad never liked humans, so I don't know.\" \"I know neither did uncle\" Nikki said \"and you see what happened to them.\" Dina trembled \"Uh huh\" She said \"Is he going to do that to everyone that doesn't like him?\" \"No I won't let him\" Nikki said \"and the only reason he did that was because they tried to hurt me.\" \"But your a wolf why does he care about wolves?\" Dana said \"I thought humans were supposed to be scared of us? That's why we had to keep to ourselves and never show them our true face.\" \"He understands me\" Nikki said \"and he also knows a lot about us.\" \"Do you think he would protect the pack as an Alpha should?\" Dana asked \"I mean he's human he can't do that much.\" \"I think so\" Nikki said \"he has protected me all this time and where he don't I will.\" \"Ok\" Dana and Dina said at once as they hugged Nikki tightly. Nikki had hugged her cousins tightly. \"I love you both\" Nikki said \"and even though Ryan is human he almost seems like one of us.\" \"What do you mean?\" Dina asked. \"He knows so much about us and he knows how to protect the ones he loves\" Nikki said \"and he cares for you both.\" \"He cares for us?\" Dana asked \"He doesn't even know us.\" \"Yes\" Nikki said \"and trust me he loves you.\" \"How can you tell?\" Dana asked. \"I just know\" Nikki said \"trust me.\" \"I trust you\" Dana said hugging her tightly \"Me too\" Dina said doing the same.\" \"Thanks guys\" Nikki said as she hugged them \"Dana how is your shoulder doing?\" \"It's better\" Dana said \"Just a bruise.\" \"At least its all better\" Nikki said \"I guess tonight Ryan and I will address the pack as the Alphas.\" \"Yes\" Her mother said proud of her daughter and smiling. \"Thanks mom for your help\" She said. \"Well our new leader must address the pack\" Her mom said \"You better go and make sure he knows that he is needing to do that.\" \"Ok\" Nikki said as she went back to Ryan. Ryan was resting on his back on the bed as Nikki walked in. \"Ryan\" Nikki said. \"Hmm?\" Ryan muttered and opened his eyes to look at her. \"Something wrong?\" \"We will have to address ourselves as the Alphas tonight\" Nikki said. \"Really?\" Ryan said \"Well alright then what exactly should I do?\" \"All you have to do is introduce yourself and then ask if any one objects\" Nikki said. \"Sounds easy enough\" Ryan said \"Do you think it would lead to fighting?\" \"I hope not\" Nikki said. \"Well I guess we should get to it then\" Ryan said getting up. \"Ok\" Nikki said as she walked to the rock that the Alphas stand on. Ryan stood with her \"I am the new alpha male\" He said as loudly as he could \"And as such I only have two rules, one is to honor your family as your family and the other is to always remember that each and everyone of you are just as much human as wolf. Even though I am human, I see myself no different then you spiritually.\" \"I am Nikki the new Alpha Female and I agree with the Alpha Male\" Nikki said \"does any one object to us?\" \"We of course do not object and we know who you are Nikki you don't have to talk like that\" One of her other cousins said. \"Ok\" Nikki said \"and thanks for accepting us as your new Alphas.\" \"As long as we all agree how about we lay down to rest tonight\" Ryan said. \"Dismissed\" Nikki said as she left to go and get some rest. \"Will you please just act as you should honey?\" Ryan asked as they made their way back to the room \"There was no need to say that.\" \"Sorry\" Nikki said \"I just can't help it.\" \"And why is that?\" Ryan asked. \"I guess I am taking my position to seriously\" Nikki said. \"I'll say\" Ryan said smiling \"Its a no wonder your family is so easily corrupt with power. If I weren't here I could almost see it happening to you.\" \"I guess so\" Nikki said \"but I hope that I don't become like my uncle and my dad.\" \"You won't\" Ryan said \"Not if I can help it.\" \"I am scared\" Nikki said \"I may not be cut out for this.\"\"Ok first your all gunho about this family thing and now your scared\" Ryan said \"What is going on with you?\" \"I don't know\" Nikki said \"I am glad to be back but I am scared that I may end up like my dad and my uncle.\" \"I won't let that happen and as long as you actually agree with me when it comes to things you should be fine\" Ryan said smiling \"Now then get you a gown your comfortable with and come to bed honey.\" \"Ok\" Nikki said as she went to her closet and pulled out a more comfortable nightgown and put it on. Ryan smiled at her again and waited for her to climb in the bed next to him. Nikki laid down with Ryan now. \"I love you\" Ryan said softly trying to hug her gently. \"I love you too\" Nikki said \"and I am glad we are together and no one is trying to split us up now.\" \"I am too\" Ryan said \"And I'm sorry.\" \"Sorry for what?\" Nikki asked. \"I sometimes feel like I caused some of the pain that you feel\" Ryan said softly. \"How can you say that?\" Nikki asked \"all the pain I felt was for my family.\" \"Yes but you were torn between your family and me\" Ryan said \"If I wasn't here you wouldn't have anything to be torn by.\" \"True\" Nikki said \"I love you.\" \"Let's just rest we don't have to worry about that anymore\" Ryan said softly hugging her closer. \"Ok\" Nikki said as she fell asleep now. Ryan smiled and wondered how she was able to fall asleep so fast as he hugged her and went to sleep himself. The two of them slept all night. Ryan awoke the next morning and smiled at Nikki before gently waking her up as well. Nikki woke up now. \"Morning\" Nikki said \"how did you sleep?\" \"Just fine\" Ryan said softly \"Do you always go to sleep that quickly?\" \"Not usually\" Nikki said \"I guess I didn't realize how tired I was.\" \"But you have done it for the past two nights?\" Ryan said smiling. \"I don't know what is going on then\" Nikki said. \"Eh its alright\" Ryan said \"It's who you are I wouldn't want to change that.\" \"Thanks\" Nikki said \"so do you think its odd that I have fallen asleep too quickly?\" \"No\" Ryan said \"I just sometimes like to talk is all.\" \"I'm sorry\" Nikki said \"but I have a feeling something really strange is happening.\" \"Strange bad?\" Ryan asked \"Or strange good?\" \"I am not sure yet\" Nikki said \"It may be strange bad.\" \"If you think it could be your uncle's heir then don't worry\" Ryan said \"It's not strange bad.\" \"How can it not be strange bad?\" Nikki asked \"it was my uncle's.\" \"Well besides the fact that the child would realize that he or she is just as much part wolf as you\" Ryan said \"They could still know me as their father and as such wouldn't hurt anyone.\" \"True\" Nikki said \"and I have a feeling that is what is going on and why I fell asleep quickly.\" \"At any rate today we start the hunt of normal animals right?\" Ryan asked. \"Yes we do\" Nikki said as she got up and got prepared. Ryan watched her for a moment before he did the same and they went out to address the pack again for the hunt. \"For this hunt we hunt animals like Deer\" Nikki said. Ryan smiled at her \"That's correct and this will also be a test of each of you as indivdiuals\" He told the pack which nodded. \"Lets go then\" Nikki said as she took off. Ryan went back to the room and waited for them all to return. When he heard the howls and then footfalls he came back out and found the pack had anything from rabbits to deer for them to eat. \"That's what I like to see you each work just as well in small groups as you do in a pack\" He said \"I want you to be able to such a thing.\" \"I am glad to see you guys bring back food like this\" Nikki said coming into the crowd. \"And what did you get my dear?\" Ryan asked Nikki. \"A buck\" Nikki said pulling the animal behind her and showing it to the pack. \"Wow very nice that shall feed us and any that would like some of it as well\" Ryan said moving Nikki and the buck back towards the room. \"Yes it would\" Nikki said \"its probably the biggest thing here.\" \"Any of you are invited in to our room for a part of this buck\" Ryan said \"But keep in mind that you must also eat part of your own tonight to make sure you made a good catch\" The pack all agreed and then dispersed. Nikki had started tearing apart the buck. \"This might feed all of us\" Nikki said. Ryan watched and waited to see how she would prepare the meat before he dug into himself, the human way. Nikki had prepared the meat like she had been taught. The two ate and the family and pack grew closer. A little more then a week passed and Nikki realized that her fears were true she was going to have an heir and the months soon followed to prepare for the baby's arrival. \"This is not good\" Nikki said. \"Like I said months ago\" Ryan told her \"It's going to be ok. He will know me as his father.\" \"We only have so much time to prepare for the arrival and I don't even have a name for it or anything else\" Nikki said with saddness. \"Jamie if it is a boy and Jessica if it is a girl\" Ryan said softly smiling. \"What if it is twins?\" Nikki asked sadly. \"Those names are interechangable for girls and boys if you use Jessie as apposed to jessica\" Ryan said. \"True\" Nikki said sadly \"I am so scared.\" \"I am sure your mom will be able to help you through it\" Ryan said \"And I am here as well.\" \"I know\" Nikki said sadly \"but something don't feel right about this child.\" \"What do you mean?\" Ryan asked. \"It just don't feel like it has any wolf qualities at all\" Nikki said \"it just feels normal.\" \"Wouldn't that be a good thing?\" Ryan asked. \"Yes it would be good\" Nikki said \"but since me and my uncle were wolves I figured it would have at least a little bit of wolf in it.\" \"Strange yes\" Ryan said \"But not exactly bad.\" \"How do you figure that its not bad?\" Nikki asked. \"Makes it much easier for the baby not to suspect that I am not their father\" Ryan said smiling. \"That is true\" Nikki said \"I will be glad once I have had the child.\" \"Why do you say that?\" Ryan asked. \"This way I won't be so exausted\" Nikki said \"I feel so weak.\" \"Well if you just relax then you won't feel so weak\" Ryan said. \"Ok\" Nikki said \"and it seems like I will be out of communion for a while.\" \"That would be for the best anyway\" Ryan said \"I wouldn't want you to waste your energy.\" \"Can you lead our family in a hunt?\" Nikki asked \"since I can't do it.\"I won't have to\" Ryan said \"They haven't been led on a hunt in months you know that.\" \"I forgot\" Nikki said as she laid down. \"Would you please go get my mom?\" Nikki asked. \"Yes\" Ryan said leaving the room now as Nikki lay on the bed. Nikki's mom came into the room and Ryan left to get the pack ready for the hunt. \"Mom did you ever feel tired when you were pregnant?\" Nikki asked. \"At times\" Her mom said \"Why do you ask?\" \"I couldn't say it before but I am carrying the heir\" Nikki said \"it was uncle who raped me.\" \"I already knew that my daughter\" Her mom said. \"How did you know?\" Nikki asked. \"The twins knew\" Her mom said \"They didn't know what it meant of course but they over heard about it and told me. After he was defeated.\" \"Oh\" Nikki said \"I am scared and I don't know what to do.\" Her mom moved closer \"You have no reason to be scared\" She said \"Your family is here for you.\" \"Thanks\" Nikki said \"so did you stay tired the whole time or was it just on and off?\" \"As I said I was tired at times\" Her mother said \"So that would be on and off yes. But you really should save your strength.\" \"Ok\" Nikki said \"and would you check up on me once in a while please.\" \"Of course\" Her mom said smiling and nuzzling her closely \"I'd do that if you didn't ask me to\" At that point Ryan came back in. \"Thanks mom\" Nikki said as she laid down so that she could save her strength. Ryan smiled and looked at her. Nikki had laid down. \"How did the hunt go?\" Nikki asked before falling asleep. \"We shall find out when they return soon\" Ryan said \"I was only out long enough to send them on.\" \"Ok\" Nikki said falling asleep now. Ryan smiled at her and moved her hair from her face and waited for the pack to return before he went out to check on them and then came back to her. He didn't want to disturb her in her sleep so he just watched over her. Nikki was in a deep sleep now and it seemed like nothing could wake her but she could be woke up. Ryan smiled at her and moved her hair from her face again for she had moved to in front of her eyes again. \"Mom\" Nikki whispered in her sleep \"Tell the pack if they don't already know.\" \"Don't worry\" Her mom said softly touching her daughter's hand \"They will know\" She then got up to leave the room. \"Watch over her\" She said softly to Ryan. \"Always\" Ryan said sitting by her now. \"I love you\" Nikki said softly in her sleep \"and thanks for being there for me.\" \"I love you too\" Ryan said leaning to her cheek and forehead to kiss them both. Nikki had continued to sleep and she was also talking in it. \"Dana and Dina thanks for telling auntie\" Nikki said softly. Ryan smiled again and didn't like waking her but he didn't want her talking in her sleep too much. \"Honey...\" He said softly near her ear \"Your talking in your sleep my love.\" Nikki woke up now. \"Huh?\" Nikki asked \"I can't believe I did it again.\" \"Again?\" Ryan asked \"I haven't heard it that much honey.\" \"I used to do it all the time when I was younger\" Nikki said \"but I don't know why.\" Ryan smiled \"I found it cute but I decided to wake you speak to you myself\" He said \"And besides your still resting as long as you don't get up.\" \"True\" Nikki said \"so what do we talk about?\" \"How well do you think I am with family?\" Ryan asked softly. \"I think you do a great job\" Nikki said as she moved closer to him. Ryan smiled again \"So I make a good alpha male then?\" He said \"Even though I am not a wolf.\" \"Yes\" Nikki said \"is it just me or has it gotten colder in here?\" \"You want me to warm you up?\" Ryan asked softly. \"Yes please\" Nikki said as she tried everything to get warm. Ryan decided that that was his cue to warm up the love that he planned to always care for. He laid down next to her and wrapped his arm around her. \"That better?\" He asked from behind her hair. \"Yes it is\" Nikki said falling asleep now. Ryan smiled and hugged her close as he prepared to go to sleep himself. The two of them had slept all night and Nikki was glad to have him around because she stayed warm the whole night. The months passed much the same and as time went by Nikki grew closer to giving birth to the heir. It wasn't long that Ryan was waiting outside the cave to hear from Nikki's mother that both Nikki and the baby were ok. As the time came Nikki had started screaming because she was hurting and about ready to give birth. Ryan heard the screams but knew that they were the signals of the coming birth. Nikki's mother was there to help her, \"Just calm yourself and breathe my child\" She said, \"It will all be over soon.\" Nikki had calmed down and breathed as she pushed with the contractions. Soon Ryan heard the small cries of a child and knew that the event had finished. The child had been born. Nikki's mother smiled, \"My child you have yourself a beautiful baby girl\" She said. \"I think I will name her Cameryn\" Nikki said as she was glad that it was over. Nikki's mother cleaned the child and brought her to her mother. Nikki held the child so carefully. \"Hello my precious Cameryn\" Nikki said. Nikki had looked up to her mother and cried a bit. \"Mom something seems odd about her she don't seem to have any wolf in her\" Nikki said. \"What is it that makes you say that?\" Her mother asked, \"And why would you think it so?\" \"I don't know it just don't feel like it\" Nikki said. \"You may not be able to sense it because it is dorment, asleep right now\" Her mother said. \"When do you usually sense it or see it in a child?\" Nikki asked \"and was I the same way?\" \"Why are you so axious to see a wolf child?\" Ryan asked coming into the room, \"Remember what I said you are just as much human as wolf.\" \"I was just wondering\" Nikki said \" and I wanted to learn about my family and me.\" \"Didn't your family ever say anything concerning your history?\" Ryan asked. \"No\" Nikki said \"we never talked much about anything especially me and my dad.\" \"Why not?\" Ryan asked \"Was it just not said?\" \"Me and my dad never got along\" Nikki said \"and I just never asked anyone before.\" \"And why not?\" Ryan asked. \"I was just never interested before\" Nikki said. \"What changed to make you interested now?\" Ryan asked. \"This little one\" Nikki said \"and one thing was before I never liked who I was and I wanted to be normal but I figured out that I am not normal.\" Ryan smiled and shook his head \"There is no normal\" He said \"We are all different and special in our own way.\" \"I guess so\" Nikki said. \"You will learn about those things\" Her mother said. \"How mom?\" Nikki asked \"I don't know the first thing about who I am.\" \"You do know who you are\" Ryan and her mom said at once \"Plus I can tell you about the legends that you may not have read\" Ryan added \"As can I\" Her mother said. \"Ok\" Nikki said \"So what other legends are there?\" Ryan smiled again \"There aren't other legends just more to the ones you already know.\" \"Could you both tell them to me please?\" Nikki asked. \"From what I have read\" Ryan said \"Sometimes a wolf child is said to be merely human for the first few years of life\" \"And that is correct, they usually don't show their age until seven or nine years of age.\" \"Oh wow\" Nikki said \"I thought we showed it when we were born.\" \"Don't you remember that Dana and Dina never went on the hunt until after they hit ten years old?\" Her mother asked. \"I forgot that\" Nikki said \"When did I show mine?\" \"When you were about eight\" Her mother said \"Though just like your cousins you didn't hunt until age ten.\" \"Oh\" Nikki said \"When did you guys pick out my mate?\" \"That was much later\" Her mother said \"You should remember that just fine, its when you started to rebel.\" \"True\" Nikki said \"is it a good idea to pick a mate when a child is born?\" \"Well if you do that and they grow up together it would probably be better\" Her mother said. \"Who said we were going to choose mates?\" Ryan asked \"Why do you want your child to go through the same thing that you did?\" \"I am not I was just wondering\" Nikki said. \"We usually didn't do that\" Her mother said \"Though sometimes I wish we had.\" \"Why is that mom?\" Nikki asked. \"Like I said it would have probably been better for our couples\" She said. \"Who knows\" Nikki said. \"For now we should rest for the night and soon we will have that heir\" Ryan said smiling. \"Ok\" Nikki said. \"I will see you two in the morning\" Her mother said getting up to leave. \"Ok\" Nikki said as she laid down to sleep. Ryan smiled and laid down beside her. \"You feeling ok tonight?\" He asked gently. \"Yep\" Nikki said \"just tired.\" \"Let's hope that our baby girl sleeps well tonight\" Ryan said looking to the crib that was brought in a few moments before and the little girl. \"Lets hope so\" She said. Ryan rested close to her and hugged her close. Nikki went and laid Cameryn down and then she went and laid down and fell asleep. Ryan smiled \"I guess the baby is asleep\" Ryan said went to sleep as well. \"Yes\" Nikki said in her sleep. The years past and Cameryn grew. She soon reached the age that she would begin transforming and as such Nikki and Ryan kept a close eye on her. \"Wow Cameryn you are growing to be very lovely\" Nikki said. \"You keep telling me that\" Cameryn said smiling . \"I am sorry but you are\" Nikki said. \"But what makes you think so momma?\" She asked. \"I can see it in you\" Nikki said \"after all your my daughter.\" \"So what will I do today mom?\" She asked. \"Do you want to learn to transform?\" Nikki asked. \"Not yet momma\" She said. \"Ok\" Nikki said. \"What are you two talking about?\" Ryan asked smiling. \"I was just asking her if she was ready to learn how to transform\" Nikki said. \"And is she?\" Ryan asked. \"Not yet\" Nikki said. \"How come?\" Ryan asked. \"She just isn't ready I guess\" Nikki said. \"It's not that\" She said \"I just want to wait a while is all.\" \"Sorry I messed up\" Nikki said \"also let me know when you are ready.\" \"Can I not do it on my own a little too?\" She asked. \"Ok you can\" Nikki said \"just be careful when you do.\" \"I won't be anytime soon I was just asking\" She said. \"Ok\" Nikki said \"Cam be back before it gets dark we may have a hunt tonight.\" \"Alright mom\" She said as she went off. \"Our little girl has grown up\" Nikki said. Ryan smiled \"Your right but why did you mention the hunt?\" He asked. \"Because I don't want her out there while we are hunting\" Nikki said \"that is if we need to hunt.\" \"Oh ok\" Ryan said \"You know of course that she is not ready for the hunt herself yet.\" \"I know that\" Nikki said \"That is why I want her home before we go.\" \"Alright then\" Ryan said \"But now that she is off having fun what will you do?\" \"I am not sure\" Nikki said. \"The other members of the pack are simply doing family things now\" Ryan said \"Acting as humans would before night fall and hunting as wolves at night.\" \"So where does that leave us?\" Nikki asked. \"I guess we can just wait for Cam to come back\" Ryan said \"Unless you can think of something to do.\" \"Nothing comes to mind right now\" Nikki said. \"We can just wait for her I guess\" Ryan said and soon after she did return, before dark as her mom told her. \"I'm back\" She called to them as she entered the caves. \"I am glad you are home\" Nikki said \"did you have fun?\" \"Just went for a run and picked some berries\" She said showing the berries she had collected. \"Wasn't that what you did as a little girl?\" Ryan asked Nikki with a smile. \"Yes I did but it was with Dana and Dina\" Nikki said \"because they wanted my help.\" \"Well before them I am sure you did the same alone at least a little bit\" Ryan said \"And besides now Dana and Dina don't really deal with berries much, they are too busy wondering who they are going to be with, being seventeen now.\" \"No I didn't not alone\" Nikki said. \"Oh\" Ryan said smiling \"I wonder why they never let you go alone.\" \"My dad was the one that wouldn't let me go\" Nikki said \"he wanted to keep an eye on me so that I didn't do anything wrong.\" \"And yet you fell in love with a human\" Ryan said smiling. \"I know\" Nikki said smiling \"but think about this you helped me when no one else would.\" \"True\" Ryan said \"And I saw you as person too.\" \"True\" Nikki said \"and that is what made me fall in love with you.\" \"Is that so?\" Ryan asked. \"Yes its true\" Nikki said \"you were the only one that seemed to understand me.\" \"Well I think your mom understood you too\" Ryan said \"At least a little but I think she was too scared of your dad to say anything.\" \"Maybe\" Nikki said \"I think mom and I were the main ones scared of him.\" \"Most of the pack was\" Said the same cousin from before coming in \"It's the way he led us.\" \"Hello Sammy\" Nikki said \"was everyone scared when uncle took over after dad?\" \"Not at first but both ruled by fear so eventually they were\" He said. \"I know uncle hurt Dana\" Nikki said \"do you know if he hurt anyone else?\" \"He tried to hurt most of the girls\" Sam said. \"Did any of the attempts work?\" Nikki asked \"and also do you know if my dad hurt anyone when I wasn't around?\" \"Your dad was mean but not aggressive\" Sam said \"And not that I know of.\" \"Do you know of anyone that could tell me?\" Nikki asked. \"Tell you what?\" Sammy asked. \"Tell me if anyone was hurt when my dad was around\" Nikki said. \"I don't think he did\" Sammy said. \"Ok\" Nikki said. \"Are we ready to start the hunt?\" Sammy asked. \"Yes\" Nikki said. \"Can I go?\" Cam asked. \"Let me discuss it with your dad first\" Nikki said. \"I don't think she is ready\" Ryan said \"After all we haven't even seen her change yet.\" \"So not right now?\" Nikki asked Ryan. \"I don't think so\" Ryan said \"She should stay here.\" \"Ok\" Nikki said \"Sorry Cam not this time.\" \"Aww\" Cam said \"Ok then.\" \"Are we heading out now then?\" Sam said. \"Yes\" Nikki said \"I am sorry Cam.\" \"It's alright\" Cam said. \"Let's go then\" Sam said. \"Sure thing\" Nikki said. The group then left leaving Cam behind. \"Have fun hunting out there\" Ryan said smiling. \"We will\" Nikki said as she left. Nikki went out on the hunt and found a small deer to catch but before she could get to it it was caught by a smaller wolf, it was moving so quickly she couldn't catch which of the pack it was. Nikki then went to hunt for another animal. She found another deer this one she was able to get to. Nikki went back to the camp now. \"How did everything go?\" Ryan asked. \"It went well\" Nikki said. \"Anything interesting happen?\" Ryan asked. \"The only thing that happened was a small wolf came out of no where and caught a small deer that I was after\" Nikki said. \"Could you tell who it was?\" Ryan asked. \"No\" Nikki said \"it was too fast.\" \"What do you want to do about it?\" Ryan asked. \"There is nothing I can do about it\" Nikki said \"I don't know if it was even one from our pack.\" \"I would hope that it was\" Ryan said \"No one is supposed to know where we are.\" \"I know\" Nikki said \"you don't suppose that it could have been Cam?\" \"How?\" Ryan asked \"She can't change yet can she?\" \"I don't know\" Nikki said \"It came too fast so I couldn't tell who it was.\" \"Well we know that cam can't change yet\" Ryan said \"At least she said she couldn't.\" \"True\" Nikki said \"but I still wonder who it could be?\" \"We can't be sure\" Ryan said heading back inside the caves. \"No we can't\" Nikki said as she went into the cave. They found that Cam was still in the caves. \"Hey honey\" Nikki said. \"How did the hunt go?\" She asked. \"It went well\" Nikki said. \"What did you catch momma?\" She asked. \"I caught a deer\" Nikki said. \"Did you see anyone else in the pack?\" She asked. \"Not from the pack no\" Nikki said \"but I did spot a wolf that was too quick to see what pack it was from.\" \"But I thought that we were the only ones that knew about this place?\" Cam asked. \"We are\" Nikki said \"but when my dad ruled we had two packs Garrison's pack and my dad's.\" \"Didn't your two groups join when Garrison was killed?\" Ryan asked. \"Yea now we are united as one big family\" Nikki said. \"Which is a good thing\" Ryan said. \"What were things like before me?\" Cam asked. \"Very difficult\" Nikki said \"and it was also rough times because I was seeing Ryan and my dad nor uncle approved of it.\" \"Why not?\" Cam asked. \"Lycans are not suppose to date humans\" Nikki said \"we were only allowed to date within the pack.\" \"Oh\" Cam said \"But we can meet with humans now right?\" \"Yes\" Nikki said \"but we have to be careful with which humans we meet.\" \"Right of course\" Cam said \"I knew that.\" \"I was lucky to meet a nice guy like Ryan\" Nikki said. \"Yup\" Ryan said smiling, \"Maybe you will meet someone like that too, human or otherwise.\" \"I hope you will Cam\" Nikki said. \"Maybe\" Cam said \"Not anytime soon though.\" \"Ok\" Nikki said \"but what if you do?\" \"We will just have to see what happens\" Cam said. \"Yes we will\" Nikki said. \"So what are we going to do now?\" Cam asked. \"Eat\" Nikki said. \"Alright\" Cam said \"Though I am not that hungry right now, I think I filled up on the berries and other foods from before.\" \"Ok\" Nikki said \" we will save you some if you like.\" \"Ok\" Cam said smiling and moving on to her own part of the caves. Ryan sat down to start eating with Nikki. \"This reminds me of the time we ate together in your apartment\" Nikki said as she was eating. \"How do you mean?\" Ryan asked. \"That time it was just us in your apartment and when we watched the romance movie\" Nikki said. \"That was a long time ago\" Ryan said \"How do you remember that?\" \"I am not sure\" Nikki said \"I guess just us being together and alone like this.\" \"I don't even hardly remember the movie though\" Ryan said smiling. \"I only remember that it was a romance\" Nikki said \"but other than that I don't remember it.\" \"Same for me\" Ryan said with a smile. Nikki had finished what she could of the meat and she let Ryan finish his and what ever was left Nikki would put up for Cam. Ryan smiled and watched her \"You make a great mother\" Ryan said \"Have I told you that?\" \"Yes you have\" Nikki said \"everyday.\" \"Well its true honey\" Ryan said \"Don't you think?\" \"Yes I do\" Nikki said. \"Let's make sure that Cam is getting ready to lay down and then we will rest ourselves\" Ryan said \"Sound good?\" \"It sounds good to me\" Nikki said. Ryan finished eating and followed Nikki to Cam's room. \"Cam lights out\" Nikki said. When they went to Cam's room they found that her lights were out but as Nikki looked into the darkness she saw that she wasn't actually there. \"Ryan Cam isn't in here\" Nikki said. \"Where could she have went?\" Ryan asked. \"I don't know\" Nikki said \"I am going to get the pack together and see if we can find her.\" \"I will help you have half the pack go to wolf to try and sniff her out\" Ryan said following. \"Ok\" Nikki said as she ran out and and got the pack together. Ryan followed with the parts of the group that stayed humans. The pack that was wolves was trying to track her sent. Ryan looking with the human branch of the pack couldn't find anything. Nikki and the pack couldn't find her smell at all. Ryan ran towards were Nikki and the pack was as wolves. \"We couldn't find anything\" Ryan said. Nikki switched back. \"Neither could we\" Nikki said \"I am very worried about her.\" \"She couldn't have gotten far\" Ryan said \"She doesn't move that fast.\" \"I know\" Nikki said \"but I don't know what else to do.\" \"Send more of the pack out\" Ryan said \"Let's see if she went back home.\" \"Ok\" Nikki said as she told the pack to go out and see if they could find her. They then went back to check Cam's room. Nikki had turned on the light and she went over to the bed. \"Cameryn\" Nikki said. Yes?\" Cameryn asked sleepily. \"Where were you a minute ago?\" Nikki asked. \"I was here\" Cameryn said \"Wasn't I?\" \"I came in here and you were gone\" Nikki said. \"I don't remember leaving though\" Cameryn said \"I don't know what happened.\" \"I am just glad you are safe\" Nikki said \"Ryan can you call the rest of the pack back here.\" \"Or at least back home\" Ryan said. \"Yes it is\" Nikki said. \"Do you want to go to our room and rest now?\" Ryan asked. \"Sure\" Nikki said as she turned off Cam's light and left the room. \"That was strange\" Ryan said \"I wonder why she didn't remember leaving?\" \"I don't know\" Nikki said \"but something didn't seem right.\" \"I know what you mean\" Ryan said \"Do you think something is wrong?\" \"Yes something is very wrong\" Nikki said \" I could sense something different.\" \"We should wait to ask her though\" Ryan said. \"Ok\" Nikki said \"I just hope she will talk to us if she has problems.\" \"I would think so\" Ryan said \"We are her parents.\" \"I hope she does\" Nikki said. \"Why wouldn't she?\" Ryan asked getting things ready for them to lay down. \"I don't know\" Nikki said as she went to lay down. \"Let's sleep on it then\" Ryan said smiling. \"Ok\" Nikki said as she laid down. Ryan hugged her close and began to play with her gently. Nikki was falling asleep now and she was glad. \"You enjoy it when I do that don't you?\" Ryan asked. \"Yes I do\" Nikki said in her sleep. Ryan fell asleep himself soon after. Once the morning came he woke up first and waited for Nikki to wake up. Nikki woke up a minute later. \"Morning\" Nikki said. \"Did you sleep well?\" Ryan asked. \"Yes\" Nikki said \"did you sleep well?\" \"Yes\" Ryan said \"And as always it just made it easier to sleep knowing that I would wake up and see you.\" \"Aww how sweet\" Nikki said. \"Well it's true\" Ryan said smiling. \"I know\" Nikki said \"I love you.\" \"I love you too\" Ryan said smiling. \"So do you think we should talk to Cameryn now or wait?\" Nikki asked. \"It would probably be a good idea to talk to her now\" Ryan said. \"Alright\" Nikki said as they headed to Cameryn's room. Ryan followed and they found that Cameryn was just starting to wake up. Nikki had walked into the room now and went over to Cameryn. \"Hey sweetheart\" Nikki said. \"Hey momma\" She said sleepily \"Is everything ok?\" \"Cam do you remember anything of what happened last night between the time I left for the hunt and came back?\" \"Just that you left and I laid down to rest for a bit before getting ready for bed\" Cam said softly. \"So do you not remember anything else?\" Nikki asked. \"Nothing besides laying down, getting ready for bed, then starting to fall asleep when you came in.\" She said. \"Ok\" Nikki said. \"Why do you ask momma?\" Cam asked \"What happened?\" \"Because I have a feeling something is wrong\" Nikki said. \"What kind of something?\" Cam asked \"Something with me?\" \"Yes\" Nikki said \"have you been seeing anyone?\" \"Of course not\" Cam said \"Mom you know me better then that plus why would I do that without you knowing I'm only seven.\" \"I know\" Nikki said \"I was just asking.\" \"Besides I am not lying about leaving\" Cam said somewhat worriedly \"I don't understand why you and dad didn't see me in my room.\" \"Even with my heightened eyesite I just couldn't see you\" Nikki said. Cam placed her hand near her head and groaned softly \"I don't....remember leaving\" She said softly \"But.... maybe I did?\" \"Are you ok?\" Ryan asked \"I.... don't know\" Cam said. Nikki wondered if it was her mind becoming two. \"Honey does it feel like your mind is becoming two?\" Nikki asked. \"Becoming two?\" Cam asked not fully understanding \"What do you mean?\" \"Does it feel like you have an animal mind and a human mind?\" Nikki asked. \"I can't be sure\" She said \"What would an animal mind feel like?\" \"Just like an animal\" Nikki said \"it seems to want to take over some times.\" \"I...don't think so\" Cam said softly \"Perhaps this is too much for her right now honey\" Ryan said \"I know your worried, so am I, but I don't want to boggle her mind or stress her out.\" \"Ok\" Nikki said \"honey if you need us you know where we are.\" Nikki then went to find her mother. Ryan smiled and followed her to her mother. \"Is something wrong?\" Nikki's mom asked as they entered. \"Something is up with Cameryn\" Nikki said \"and I think it might be her wolf mind coming in.\" \"What makes you think that?\" Her mom asked. \"She seems to have a headache\" Nikki said \"and she don't remember anything much.\" \"And you think maybe her wolf mind is taking over and she is turning without remembering?\" Her mom questioned. \"Yes\" Nikki said \"when I was out on the hunt I seen a wolf run real fast past me and I couldn't tell who it was.\" \"Your thinking maybe that was her?\" Her mom asked \"It's possible but rare that a member of our kind becomes a wolf like that.\" \"Yea\" Nikki said \"but I can't prove it.\" \"Actually there is a way to test it\" Nikki's mom said \"But its risky and sometimes painful on the wolf in question.\" \"What way is that?\" Nikki asked. \"You can chain her up and/or watch her closely at night\" Her mom said \"But the problem is if she really does have that strong of a wolf in her, she may fight back and not even know who you are.\" \"I say we watch her closely\" Nikki said \"also mom did you have to do that to me?\" \"No\" She said \"Remember it's a rare thing to happen, and it might not even be true.\" \"If the two things don't work what else can we do?\" Nikki asked. \"Well if you watch her closely and never see her turn then you can try chaining her up and see if she still blacks out.\" Her mom said \"If she does black out there will be evidence that the wolf form of her was fighting the chains, if she doesn't black out or you don't see anything then I am sure she is ok and as normal as the rest of us. It may just be a phase she is going through or something wrong with her human side rather then wolf.\" \"Ok Nikki said \"we will do both things then just to see.\" Nikki got up to leave now and go get Cam and chain her up and watch her closely. \"I wonder how she will react to this?\" Ryan asked softly as he carried the chains while they walked to her room. \"She will probably hate it\" Nikki said \"but we have to do something.\" \"She wouldn't hate it so much as it will probably scare her\" Ryan said \"I mean what do we say? We think there is something wrong with you so we are going to chain you up and watch you like hawks?\" \"I don't know\" Nikki said \"I haven't thought that far.\" \"Just as spontaneous as ever\" Ryan said with a smile \"Even becoming a mother hasn't changed that\" They had now made inside her room and she looked at them with wide eyes \"What's wrong?\" She asked worried. \"This is for your own protection\" Nikki said. \"What are you going to do?\" She asked. Nikki didn't tell her she just did it. \"Chaining me up is for my protection?\" She asked \"Momma please...\" \"Please trust me\" Nikki said. \"Of course I trust you momma\" She said almost crying now \"But I should at least know what is going on.\" \"Don't cry sweetie its just for an experiment\" Nikki said. \"Bad choice of words\" Ryan said softly \"We are just worried about you honey\" He told Cameryn \"We want to make sure that you are ok\" Cameryn calmed down a little after that. \"I panicked\" Nikki said softly. \"You got to remember to choose your words carefully\" Ryan said \"We are talking to a small child here, and an important one\" \"Really?\" Cam asked \"I'm important?\" \"Yes you are sweetie\" Nikki said \"that is why we are worried about you.\" \"Ok\" She said \"I will be calm then\" She relaxed now \"There you go\" Ryan said. \"You know we love you sweetie\" Nikki said. \"I love you too momma\" She said smiling now. \"You won't leave me in here will you? Not like this?\" \"No I will stay with you\" Nikki said. \"That's good\" Cam said \"What about daddy?\" \"I will stay too\" Ryan said with a smile. \"Then its settled\" Nikki said as she went over to the bed. Ryan did the same and they waited. \"What if nothing happens?\" Ryan asked. \"If nothing happens we let her go\" Nikki said. \"And what do we do about her black outs?\" Ryan asked. \"I don't know\" Nikki said. The two waited for a few more moments and then noticed that Cameryn was starting to stir, restlessly, more so then she normally would. \"She must be transforming\" Nikki said softly. Nikki was right. Cameryn was transforming but it was much quicker and rougher then a normal transformation and Cameryn was getting leg musles much to large for a wolf her age. \"This is strange\" Nikki said \"She is transforming differently then I do.\" \"That might be that 'stronger wolf' your mom was talking about\" Ryan said \"What should we do?\" \"I don't know\" Nikki said as she called for her mom. The transformation was complete when her mother arrived and Cameryn was standing before them in wolf form growling, still chained up. \"It is true\" Nikki's mother said \"I didn't think the legend of this wolf form was true.\" \"Mom what do we do?\" Nikki asked in a worried voice. \"You have to get through to your little girl inside the beast\" She said \"At least that is what I have heard.\" \"Ok\" Nikki said \"Cameryn honey its me your mother I love you sweetiepie and I don't want to lose you.\" All the wolf before her did was growl and snap at her. \"I don't think just talking will do it\" Ryan said worried himself. \"What else is there to do?\" Nikki asked. \"Hug perhaps?\" Ryan asked. \"Its worth a shot\" Nikki said as she walked over to the wolf and hugged her. Ryan did the same and the wolf seemed to calm somewhat. \"Mom come and help please\" Nikki said. Nikki's mom did so as did Ryan. Soon they felt the wolf form begin to shrink. \"Its working\" Nikki said. \"Momma?\" Cameryn cried softly when the wolf before them became their little girl again. \"Cam are you ok?\" Nikki asked crying a bit. \"I think so...\" She said \"What happened?\" \"Your transforming without knowing it\" Nikki said. Nikki then turned to her mom \"is there anyway to bind the power?\" \"We don't want to bind it\" Her mother said \"We want her to control it.\" \"How can we help her control it?\" Nikki asked. \"She would need to practice going into it herself\" Her mother said, \"With us watching of course.\" \"Cameryn are you up for this?\" Nikki asked. \"I am not sure\" Cam said \"I guess we will just have to try.\" \"Ok\" Nikki said \"do you want to try now or later?\" \"Later please\" Cameryn said \"I want to rest.\" \"Ok\" Nikki said \"also would you like us to stay with you?\" \"I don't think you will have to\" Cameryn said \"Unless you want to.\" \"I will stay just in case you need me\" Nikki said. \"I guess I will go back to our room then?\" Ryan asked \"Or do you want me to stay too?\" \"You can stay too\" Nikki said as she laid down in Cam's floor. Ryan did the same and hugged her close. The three of them slept together in Cam's room. The night was peaceful and Cam didn't seem to have any problems. Nikki had awaken the next morning and she was well rested. Ryan woke up and was well rested though his back hurt from sleeping on the floor. \"Morning\" Nikki said as she looked at Ryan and Cam. \"Thanks for staying with me\" Cameryn said to both of them. \"I think that helped.\" \"Its no problem\" Nikki said \"if you like we can take turns staying with you or I can just stay alone.\" \"Why not you both always stay?\" Cam asked \"At least for a little while?\" \"That works too\" Nikki said \"How are you feeling today?\" \"Pretty good\" Cameryn said \"But what will we do today?\" \"Training\" Nikki said \"that is after we eat breakfast.\" \"We need to do that of course\" Ryan said \"But keep in mind we don't want to push her too much.\" \"I know\" Nikki said \"it was just a thought.\" \"What exactly will I be doing to train?\" Cam asked \"I would say the best way to start is for you to watch us change and see if you can't control your shifting first\" Nikki's mother said. \"Thanks mom\" Nikki said \"and that is a good idea.\" \"Won't that put you guys in danger?\" Ryan said \"I mean what if she loses control again? We can't keep her chained up all the time.\" \"Yes it would but its a risk we have to take\" Nikki said. \"Exactly\" Nikki's mother agreed \"But first...\" Ryan left for a moment and then returned smiling, \"We have breakfast.\" \"Good idea\" Nikki said. The family ate the breakfast that Ryan had brought in prepared for them then Nikki's mother stood up. \"I think this sort of training should be done outside in the woods away from the others of the pack for now\" She said \"It would be easier on the them that way.\" \"Yes it would\" Nikki said \"Ryan could watch the pack for now and if he needs help he can ask Dana Dina and Sammy.\" \"I wanted to help you guys but if that is the best way I can do that then it is what I will do\" Ryan said. \"I know you wanted to help but if she loses control I don't know what I would do if you got hurt\" Nikki said. \"Alright\" Ryan said understanding \"I will keep watch over the family then\" Nikki noticed how Ryan referred to the pack as family rather then pack as he always did. \"Thank you\" Nikki said as she finished eating. Everyone else had also finished and Nikki, her mother, and Cameryn moved on to the woods while Ryan stayed near the caves. Once a good distance away Nikki's mother looked at both Nikki and to Cameryn \"Ready?\" She asked. Cameryn nodded slowly, still unsure herself. \"I am too\" Nikki said as she was getting prepared. \"Just watch us\" Nikki's mother said. Cameryn nodded and did so as Nikki's mother began to shift slowly. Nikki also shifts slowly. Cameryn watched carefully and then once they were done she waited for them to shift back. Nikki was beginning to switch back now. As was her mother and soon both were in human form again. \"What exactly do I need to do to shift?\" Cam asked softly. \"Just think about transforming\" Nikki said \"and you should shift.\" \"Also make sure to keep your own self in mind, who you really are\" Nikki's mother said \"Otherwise the wolf mind may take over\" Cameryn nodded and so, slowly shifting herself. She growled at them and snapped her teeth. \"Concetrate on who you really are\" Nikki's mother said softly, trying to calm the wolf before her. \"Focus Cam on your human self\" Nikki said. The wolf calmed a little but was still growling at them. It suddenly shook it's head and charged for Nikki. Nikki dodged Cam. \"Cam remember who you are\" Nikki's mother said, dodging an attack herself. Nikki was also dodging Cam. \"Come on Cam remember\" Nikki said. The wolf stopped charging and started to change back. Soon Cam was before them, her clothes in shreds, and panting. \"Cam are you ok?\" Nikki asked. \"I can't be sure\" Cam said \"What happened?\" \"You shifted and then attacked me and my mom\" Nikki said. \"I did?\" Cam said holding her head and leaning against a tree. \"Yes\" Nikki said \"if we keep practicing then you may get control over it.\" \"But what if I hurt you?\" Cam asked. \"Its a risk that we have to take\" Nikki said. \"But I don't want to hurt you\" Cam said \"I don't want you to have to take that risk.\" \"I know you don't but its the best we got\" Nikki said \"we need to train you.\" \"And also you must remember child that this creature attacking us isn't the real you\" Nikki's mother said \"Your not the one trying to hurt us, it is.\" \"That's right\" Nikki said. \"Do you want me to try again?\" Cam asked looking gently at her mother. \"Not unless you want to\" Nikki said \"I won't make you.\" \"I want to rest for a bit before I do please\" Cam said softly. \"Go ahead\" Nikki said \"and if you want we will continue after you rest.\" \"Ok\" Cam said softly \"I know that it is hard on you child\" Nikki's mother said \"It's hard on all of us.\" \"Especially me\" Nikki said \"but I am willing to help you control it.\" \"What is wrong with me?\" Cam asked \"Why am I like this?\" Nikki's mother knew that it was because she was a special, powerful wolf but she wasn't sure what Nikki would want to tell her. \"Your a very rare and powerful wolf\" Nikki said \"and also very special.\" \"I am?\" She asked. \"Yes you are\" Nikki said. \"But how come?\" Cam asked. Nikki wondered if she should tell Cam who her true father was. Nikki's mother saw the look on her face and shook her head no. \"We don't really know why\" She told Cam, \"It is just a rare thing that happens to our kind.\" Nikki nodded to her mom that she understood. \"Your grandmother is right\" Nikki said \"its a one in a million chance that this would happen again.\" \"So it was just stroke of bad luck that it happened to me?\" Cam asked. \"I wouldn't say its bad luck\" Nikki said. \"What do you mean?\" Cam asked. \"Its just rare not really bad luck\" Nikki said \"look at it this way its more of a blessing then a curse.\" \"How is it a blessing to be like this?\" Cam asked. \"It just is\" Nikki said \"put it this way if we ran into a strong enemy then you being the strong one could most likely kill them.\" \"But I don't want to be a killer\" Cam said. \"I know you don't Cam\" Nikki said \"but we do what we have to.\" \"Let's try again\" Cam said standing up \"I want control because I don't want to be a killer.\" \"Ok\" Nikki said as she shifted again slowly. Nikki's mother did the same and Cam played close attention trying to understand exactly how they changed. Nikki was switching back again. Cam waited and as soon as they were back to normal she spoke \"Ok I am going to try again\" She said softly and she began to concentrate. Nikki and her mom watched Cam to make sure she was ok. This time she changed a bit smoother and didn't growl as much. Nikki had noticed the change went a little more smoothly. \"I think she is getting better\" Nikki's mom said \"What about you?\" \"Yes she is\" Nikki said. Cam's wolf form shook its head a bit but then she changed back \"It's hard...\" She said \"But I think...I am getting control.\" \"It will be until you get used to it\" Nikki said. \"It wasn't this hard for you though right?\" Cam asked \"It's harder for me since my wolf is strong?\" \"It was hard for me when I first started\" Nikki said. \"How long did it take you to get control of your shifting?\" Cam asked. \"A few days\" Nikki said. \"Do you think it will take longer for me?\" Cam asked. \"It may\" Nikki said \"but who knows.\" \"How long each day did you practice?\" Cam asked. \"Until it got dark\" Nikki said. \"Did you practice alone or with others of the pack?\" Cam asked. \"It was just me and mom\" Nikki said. The three of them continued to talk and practice for the rest of the day and by night fall were heading back to the caves. \"You are doing well\" Nikki's mom said \"Both of you, but it will take time for you to get full control.\" \"Yes it will\" Nikki said \"also mom how long did it take for me to get full control?\" \"About three days like you said\" She said. \"Ok\" Nikki said as they headed back to the cave. Once they arrived back Nikki found Ryan in their room getting things set for the hunt later that night. \"Hey honey\" Nikki said. \"How did things go?\" Ryan asked. \"It was a little rough at first\" Nikki said \"but after a while it went smoothly.\" \"So she is getting more control then?\" Ryan asked. Cam nodded to tell him so. \"That's good to hear\" Ryan said playing with her hair a little bit. \"I knew she could.\" \"I am glad she is getting the hang of it\" Nikki said. \"Me too\" Cam said moving towards her room \"I hope the hunt goes well for everyone\" She said leaving. \"Ryan do you think I should let her go on the hunt this time?\" Nikki asked. \"I would think if she wants to go on the hunt she will herself with that wolf form of hers\" Ryan said \"But I don't really want to get her close to the pack yet since she doesn't have full control of herself and I don't want to worry the family.\" \"Ok\" Nikki said as she helped out Ryan get everything ready for the hunt. \"Do you want me to go check on her while I wait for everyone to return?\" Ryan asked \"Or would you rather me let her be?\" \"You can go check on her\" Nikki said as she got the last of it finished. \"Alright\" Ryan said \"Have fun out there.\" \"I will\" Nikki said as she went out to get the pack ready. Ryan waited for her to return but moved on to Cam's room. As Nikki left the caves she found that the pack had in fact prepared for the next hunt. And Sammy came to her before they would start their run. \"Is Cameryn doing ok?\" He asked. \"She is doing real well\" Nikki said \"when we get back you can go and see her if you like.\" \"I was just kind of worried about her\" Sammy said \"I had heard rumors that something was going on with her.\" Sammy and Nikki both picked up the scent of the animals and the forest. \"We will see\" Sammy said before he shifted and charged into the woods. Nikki shifted and raced after Sammy. Nikki could keep pace with Sammy and saw that he was after a large buck. Nikki waited to see if Sammy would need help to chase it. It seemed like Sammy was slowing down to run next to her. He might need help taking it down. Nikki was willing to help Sammy take it down. The two charged at the buck and were able to get it down, working together. Nikki and Sammy carried the buck back to the cave now. Once there they saw that everyone else had made their own catches. Nikki and Sammy had laid the deer down now. Nikki had shifted back now. Sammy did the same \"Thank you\" He said. \"No problem\" Nikki said \"I am glad to help.\" \"That was quite the catch for us\" He said \"I wouldn't have been able to do it myself.\" \"Yes it was\" Nikki said \"also if you want to go see Cam you can.\" \"Alright\" Sam said. And he followed her to Cameryn's room. \"Cammy\" Nikki said \"you have a visitor.\" \"Huh?\" Cam said getting up \"Who?\" \"Sammy\" Nikki said \"my cousin.\" \"Hello\" Cam said \"Hi\" Sammy said looking at the little girl \"Your growing everyday I see.\" \"I will leave you two to talk\" Nikki said as she left the room. The two spoke for a few moments and then Sam came back out \"You are raising your daughter well\" He said \"She's a good kid.\" \"Thank you\" Nikki said \"so how did you like talking to her?\" \"She's a sweet girl\" Sam said \"But why did you leave us alone like that?\" \"I just thought it would be nice for you two to get to know each other\" Nikki said \"I don't want her to be like me and not know the whole pack.\" \"But you do know the pack\" Sam said \"And how is knowing me going to help her know the rest of them, we are a large family.\" \"I was wanting her to get used to others so I thought that if she got to know you she would be willing to know the others\" Nikki said. \"She's young Nikki\" Sam said \"She hasn't it your rebelous streak yet. It won't be hard for her to get to know other members of the pack.\" \"I know\" Nikki said \"but she don't seem to want to come out of her room and talk to the pack.\" \"Well she is still not a part of the hunts so that's understandable\" Sam said \"I was the same way, and you may not have stayed in your room but you stayed pretty much on your own when you were young too.\" \"True\" Nikki said \"but you know I used to escape after my dad went to bed.\" \"I had heard about that\" Sam said \"But because you were so close to the alpha of the pack it didn't really matter.\" \"True\" Nikki said. \"How about I introduce Cam to more of the pack once she can start hunting?\" Sam offered. \"That would be great\" Nikki said \"I am thankful.\" \"Well your part of the family is important to the pack\" Sam said \"I thought I should be willing to do that.\" \"I appreciate it\" Nikki said \"I think she would actually get along with the pack once she talks to all of them.\" \"Well talks to most of them\" Sam said smiling \"She can't talk to them all, that would take a while.\" \"Yea that is true\" Nikki said. Sam just laughed, \"You never change\" He said \"You've always been a woman of few words.\" \"Can you blame me?\" Nikki asked \"I never really had anyone to talk to.\" \"I know\" Sam said \"We were all afraid to talk to each other when your dad and uncle were leading.\" \"At least now we can all get along\" Nikki said \"also what do you think of having Ryan as the Alpha male?\" \"For a human he does a good job\" Sam said. \"I am glad\" Nikki said. \"Are you worried of what the rest of the pack will think of him?\" Sam asked. \"Yes\" Nikki said \"real worried that they won't like him as much now.\" \"Why do you think that?\" Sam asked. \"I just have that feeling\" Nikki said. \"Something in your gut huh?\" Sam asked. \"Yes\" Nikki said. \"Well maybe sometime tomorrow I can take you around to talk to those of the pack that I know and we will see ok?\" Sam offered. \"I would like to do that\" Nikki said \"thank you for your help.\" \"Call it payment for helping me with the buck\" Sam said smiling. Nikki had smiled now. Sam then walked on back to his part of the caves. Nikki had headed to her room now. She found that Ryan had returned to their room and was preparing for bed himself. \"Did things go well?\" He asked. \"Yea everything went real well\" Nikki said \"Sammy and I caught a big buck together.\" \"That's cool\" Ryan said as he got the bed made for the night. \"I am going to take a quick bath\" Nikki said as she grabbed the things she needed for her bath. \"Alright then if that's what you want\" Ryan said \"You ok?\" \"Yea I am fine\" Nikki said \"I just feel icky.\" \"Ok then\" Ryan said \"I will let you be then.\" Nikki took her a quick bath and then went to lay down with Ryan. \"Feel better?\" Ryan asked as he hugged her closer. \"Yes I do\" Nikki said. \"How is the family doing?\" Ryan asked moving his fingers through her hair gently. \"They are doing well\" Nikki said. Ryan moved her hair away from her neck and kissed it gently \"I love you\" He said softly. \"I love you too\" Nikki said softly. \"Your so beautiful\" Ryan whispered into her ear. \"Thank you\" Nikki said. \"I guess we should get some sleep huh?\" Ryan said. \"Yea I guess so\" Nikki said. \"Unless you got something else on your mind\" Ryan said \"Or your not sleepy.\" \"I don't have anything on my mind\" Nikki said as she was falling asleep. Ryan smiled \"Well I guess you are sleepy then\" He said and waited to see if she would fall asleep. \"Yes I am\" Nikki said now asleep. Ryan loved the way she looked when she was asleep she seemed so peaceful. He hugged her again and started to fall asleep himself. The two of them slept all night peacefully. When morning came Nikki woke first and found that Ryan was still hugging her. His face buried in her hair. Nikki didn't want to move because Ryan looked so handsome just laying there. Nikki heard Ryan gently stir but he didn't move much from where he was, he still had his arm around her. \"Morning sweetie\" Nikki said softly. \"Hmm?\" Ryan muttered from within in her hair as he woke up \"Is it morning already?\" \"Yes\" Nikki said. \"Aww darn\" Ryan said starting to move away from her \"I was so comfy too.\" \"I am sorry to wake you\" Nikki said. \"Well we got to get up I guess\" Ryan said softly. \"I guess so\" Nikki said. \"Do you not want to get up yet?\" Ryan asked \"We are the alphas we can do what we want after all.\" \"Yea I do want to get up\" Nikki said \"at least to go check on Cam.\" \"How about you let me do that?\" Ryan said \"You two did a lot yesterday, you should rest a bit.\" \"Ok\" Nikki said as she laid down again. Ryan smiled as he gave her a kiss and got up to leave the room for a moment to check on Cameryn. Nikki was resting now. Soon enough Ryan returned and climbed back into the bed next to her. \"She's still sleeping\" He said \"I think she needs a little bit of extra rest just like you do, not go to sleep exactly but at least rest a bit.\" \"Ok\" Nikki said \"I love you.\" \"I love you too\" He said hugging her close. \"I am glad that Cam didn't think that a father would have anything to do with how she is she wouldn't think of that yet and I don't know if she will ever have to know.\" \"I wanted to tell her but my mom wouldn't let me\" Nikki said. \"I really don't think she is ready for that\" Ryan said \"At least not yet I just wish we had a child ourselves, just to see what it would be like to have a hybrid before the rest of the family gets the idea though at the same time no matter what I will always think of Cam as my little girl.\" \"If you want we can make love\" Nikki said \"and have another child.\" \"I would like that but I want you to be ready for it\" Ryan said \"Not to mention I want you to experience a more passionate form of love then what happened before.\" \"That would be nice\" Nikki said \"I would love to experience the more passionate form of love.\" Ryan smiled \"Do you think you could get that with me?\" He asked \"Am I lucky enough to be that special?\" \"Yes I do\" Nikki said. \"Maybe tonight then?\" Ryan asked playing with her hair. \"Sounds like a plan\" Nikki said. At that point Cameryn walked into the room \"Momma? Daddy?\" She called rubbing her eyes. \"What is it Cam?\" Nikki asked. \"I don't think I will go to sleep but can I lay with you guys for a bit before we go training today?\" She asked. \"Sure\" Nikki said \"What made you come in here?\" \"A weird dream\" She said \"Not bad, but... strange.\" \"What was it about?\" Nikki asked. \"I was running through the woods and I kept going to wolf and back again\" She said softly \"I think I was running to a human town or something.\" \"That is strange\" Nikki said \"Do you remember why you were going into town?\" She shook her head \"I can't be sure\" She said \"It was almost as if I was running from something but I never saw anything.\" \"Weird\" Nikki said. \"Well nothing will chase you from here\" Ryan said hugging her close \"Not if we have anything to say about it right honey?\" \"That's right\" Nikki said. Cameryn smiled and hugged them both \"I love you\" She said to them both. \"We love you too sweetie\" Nikki said. \"Your mom's right about that one baby girl\" Ryan said kissing her forehead. Cameryn then cuddled up into a ball between them. The three of them laid together for a long time. Eventually Nikki's mom came to them \"Is everything ok?\" She asked. \"Yea Cam just had a strange dream\" Nikki said. \"Strange dream?\" Her mom asked looking at the little girl laying on the bed. \"Cam tell her about your dream\" Nikki said. Cam nodded and did so. \"Interesting\" She said \"You know sometimes dreams are just trying to tell you things, or help you understand something.\" \"So what do you think?\" Nikki asked. \"I can't be sure\" Nikki's mom said \"But maybe her wolf spirit is trying to tell her something?\" \"Ok\" Nikki said. \"Do we want to start training then?\" Nikki's mom asked. \"Sure\" Nikki said. Ryan smiled and watched them as they left. \"How are we going to do things this time?\" Cameryn said. \"We eat first\" Nikki said. \"Good Idea\" Cameryn said \"I am hungry.\" The four of them went to the kitchen to eat. Ryan was there and already eating. Nikki went to eat now. The others followed and did the same. Nikki had finished eating now. As did Cam and Nikki's mother. Nikki her mom and Cam had all went out to the woods and started training. The passed by much like the day before though Cam was better this time around and eventually it got close to night fall. \"Good work Cam\" Nikki said. \"I guess we should head in then?\" She asked. \"Yea\" Nikki said. The group went for the caves again \"You did well today\" Nikki's mom told Cam \"Thanks\" Cam said. \"Maybe in a couple more days you will be ready for the hunt\" Nikki said. \"You think so?\" Cam asked. \"Yes I do\" Nikki said \"you seem to get better control each time now.\" \"Maybe it will take me the same amount of time it took you after all\" Cameryn said. \"It seems that way\" Nikki said. \"I hope so\" Cam said \"And after will I be going on the hunts?\" \"Yes you will but you may have to stay with me at first\" Nikki said. \"Ok then\" Cam said. \"Cam you get some rest now\" Nikki said. \"I will momma\" She said \"You and daddy sleep well too.\" \"We will\" Nikki said as she went into her's and Ryan's room. She found Ryan in the room waiting for her, \"Does the family want to hunt tonight?\" He asked \"Or would they rather rest?\" \"I don't know yet\" Nikki said \"but our daughter is doing real well in her training.\" \"That's good to hear\" Ryan said smiling. \"She will soon be ready to go on the hunts with us\" Nikki said. \"That's great\" Ryan said \"And your sure that it would be safe? For both her and the family?\" \"Yea she is getting great control of the wolf\" Nikki said \"I also told her that she will have to stay with me on this first hunt so that I can make sure she is ready.\" \"That's a good idea\" Ryan said \"Speaking of which why don't we go out and see if the family wants to hunt tonight or would rather take a night of rest.\" \"Ok\" Nikki said as she went outside to talk to the pack. She found some members of the family were out of their cave homes but others were not. Nikki had talked to them and asked if they wanted to hunt or take a break. Most of the family agreed to take a break this time around. Some of them wanted a day of the rest others merely just wanted to stay in that night to do normal human things. Nikki was ok with taking a break because they had been hunting a lot. After she talked to them and she found out the answers she went back to her's and Ryan's room. \"So what did they say?\" Ryan asked. \"That they wanted to take a break\" Nikki said. \"Ok then\" Ryan said \"I guess I should just make the bed for us then.\" \"Yes\" Nikki said \"and we can make love if you want.\" \"I would like that\" Ryan said smiling as he finished making the bed. \"So would I\" Nikki said as she got in her nightgown. \"After you\" Ryan offered the bed to her. \"Thank you\" Nikki said as she laid down first. Ryan smiled and laid down next to her for a moment before turning to face her. \"I don't know what you would rather me do to pleasure you first\" Ryan said \"Or would you want to start it off?\" \"You start off\" Nikki said \"it don't matter what you do.\" Ryan smiled and gently moved his hand under her nightgown to her belly to tickle it a little before moving to her chest. She was so soft. Nikki was loving every minute of it. Ryan moved his other hand to do the same to her other breast and smiled at her. Nikki loved this and she moaned as he was massaging her breast. Ryan loved it too and kept it going as he got lost in her eyes though he to rest above her a specific way so that he could get under her gown to her breast but he didn't really care about that right now. Nikki continued to moan as he done this. Ryan felt her moans within himself and timdly went to take her gown away to make it easier for him to massage her. Nikki didn't mind this at all she loved it because it was with the one she loved. Once the gown was removed Ryan was able to see her bare body before but rather then just looking at it he was above it, loving on it, it was almost too much to take in. \"Your so beautiful\" He whispered as he placed his hand against her cheek before leaning to kiss her breasts if she allowed it. \"Thank you\" Nikki said as she looked at him. She nodded her head to let him know she was ok with what he had planned. Ryan smiled and began to kiss one breast as he massaged the other. After a time he even began to suck on it gently. Nikki just moaned as he done this. She was loving every bit of what he was doing. Ryan then gently swapped to do the same to the other breast as he felt her moans within his own body. Nikki continued moaning. Ryan stopped massaging and kissing her before he removed his own shirt to lay against her for a moment before looking into her eyes again. Nikki looked into his eyes and she got lost in them. \"I never knew how pretty your eyes are\" Nikki said. \"What do you mean?\" Ryan whispered. \"Your eyes are pretty that I could get lost in them\" Nikki said \"they look like gold gems.\" Ryan smiled and tickled her belly again before starting kiss her body once more, he wanted to kiss her all over but he wasn't sure what she would do. She didn't care what he did now she was just glad to be with him. Ryan saw how she didn't seem to care and loved every moment of it so he did began to kiss her whole body but he stopped when he made it to just above her lower body. He still wanted to make sure she was ready. Nikki nodded to him. \"Go for it\" She whispered. Ryan shyly removed her undergarments before him then massaged her gently. Nikki was moaning while he did this. Ryan laid down beside her and took her hand in one of his while his other massaged her. Nikki was holding Ryan's hand and she then decided to take her hand and massage his lower. Ryan was surprised by the move but let her do it. He didn't know what he would do about his shorts at this time but he didn't care right now. Nikki massaged his lower for a little longer. She wondered what to do now. Ryan moaned along with her while she massaged him. \"I love you\" He said softly. He wanted more. Nikki removed his shorts and she climbed on top of him and she laid on him and gave him a hug. \"What brought this about?\" Ryan asked smiling at her with surprise. \"Nothing\" Nikki said \"I just wanted to lay on you.\" \"Am I comfy?\" Ryan asked as he looked into her eyes. \"Yes very comfy\" Nikki said as she stared into his eyes. Ryan's body was shivering with pleasure waiting to see if she was ready to connect with him. Nikki was prepared and she connected with him. Ryan smiled and moved his hands to her shoulders as he began to bounce and make love to her. Nikki bounced and she moaned as they were doing this. Ryan moaned right along with her and soon his peak was met and with a deep moan flowed into her. Nikki had moaned and then relaxed as she released as well. Ryan relaxed under her and she could almost feel like he was letting her fall into him. Nikki had fallen asleep on him now. Ryan smiled and pulled the covers over them to let her sleep as he played with her hair a bit before going to sleep himself. The two of them slept all night. When morning came Nikki woke up first again and found herself still on top of Ryan and covered with the blanket that he had pulled over them. Nikki took off the blanket and she went into the bathroom to take a bath. Ryan still slept but he woke up when he heard the water run. \"You ok?\" He asked \"Or did I make you feel dirty or something?\" \"I am fine I just want to take a quick bath\" Nikki said. \"I guess I should just let you be then\" Ryan said softly as he yawned \"Though I know I would need one too sometime today, but I can just take me a shower later or something.\" \"Ok\" Nikki said as she cut the water off and climbed into the tub. \"Did you like what happened last night?\" Ryan asked. \"Yes I did\" Nikki said \"it was a lot better than what my uncle did.\" \"I would hope so\" Ryan said getting up and getting ready for the day himself. Nikki stayed in the tub for quite a while. After getting ready for the day Ryan moved to go to the restroom to both use it and check on Nikki. \"Everything ok?\" He asked her from behind the shower curtain. \"Yea\" Nikki said. \"I guess the water feels good huh?\" Ryan asked. \"The water is perfect\" Nikki said relaxing in the tub. Ryan finished using the restroom and sighed lovingly before he started to leave the bathroom. \"Well take your time\" He said \"I suppose it would be best that I leave you alone.\" \"Ok\" Nikki said. \"Of course at the same time I don't see you being to upset if I stay in here\" Ryan said jokingly \"I guess it's up to you.\" \"I don't care what you do\" Nikki said as she started washing up. Ryan moved the curtain a bit to see her face. \"I love you\" He said kissing her wet forehead. \"I love you too\" Nikki said. \"What if this time you don't get a child?\" Ryan asked. \"Then I don't get one\" Nikki said \"at least we can say we tried.\" \"Well tried at least once anyway\" Ryan said \"I wouldn't want to do anything more, or try anymore unless you wanted to.\" \"I understand\" Nikki said. \"Somehow I get the feeling you don't really want another child\" Ryan said softly. \"I do but who knows what will happen\" Nikki said. \"We will just have to wait and see\" Ryan said, and he got ready to leave the bathroom again so that she could get out when she was ready even though she knew and he knew that it wouldn't make a difference if he was in there or not considering the night before. \"Yea we will\" Nikki said as she let the water out and climbed out and dried off. Ryan was already gone when she got out to dry off but she saw that he had left her some clothes for the day. Nikki finished drying off and she then slid the clothes on that Ryan laid out for her. Once she was ready and returned to their room she found that he had already had the bed made for the day and it seemed he had went out to check on Cameryn. Nikki had left the room now and she went to find Ryan and the rest of the family. As Nikki had thought Ryan was with Cam and he was helping her get ready for her training for the day. \"You ready to get going momma?\" Cam asked. \"Yea\" Nikki said. \"Ok\" Cam said and with that the two went out to meet with Nikki's mother and start the training for today. \"Ok Cam\" Nikki said \"try and shift.\" \"You want me to go first today?\" Cam asked surprised. \"Yea\" Nikki said \"lets see if you can do it alone.\" Cam did so and was able to shift ok but she growled once again as she had many times before and seemed about to charge again. \"Cam remember who you are\" Nikki said. \"Concetrate on the real you\" Nikki's mother said trying to get through to the child as well. The wolf shook her head a bit but stopped and shifted back. \"That was harder then I thought it would be\" Cam said softly \"That wolf is stronger then me.\" \"It will be unless you can get control over it\" Nikki said. \"And you are stronger then it\" Nikki's mother said \"Always believe that. Right Nikki?\" \"Right\" Nikki said. \"I am?\" Cam questioned \"I am not so sure of that.\" \"Yes you are\" Nikki said. \"Do you want me to try again?\" Cam asked. \"Yes please\" Nikki said \"and this time focus.\" \"Right\" Cam said and she did so this time there was just a small growl and she didn't even look like she wanted to charge at them. \"Good job\" Nikki said as she continued to watch Cam. Cam then tried to change back and it seemed to take a little bit of effort but she returned to normal \"I...think I am getting it\" She said \"I know I'm close.\" \"You are doing great\" Nikki said. They kept trying for most of the day and it seemed that Cameryn finally had full control over the wolf form by the end of the day. Nikki smiled now. \"You know I think you may be ready to hunt soon\" Nikki said making their way back to the cave. \"I think so\" Cameryn said \"Though I would still like to sit this next one out if that is ok.\" \"Ok\" Nikki said \"that would be fine.\" They all made their way back to the caves again and Nikki saw that Ryan was once again preparing things for the hunt. She had realized that even though he didn't actually hunt he was always a big part of preparing things for it. \"Everything go good today?\" He asked as she walked in. \"Yes it did\" Nikki said \"she is almost ready to hunt with the family.\" \"You think so?\" Ryan asked. \"Yes\" Nikki said \"she has gotten control over the wolf part but she said that she wanted to sit this hunt out.\" \"Ok sounds like a plan then\" Ryan said \"And I am guessing you keep watch over her for the first few?\" \"Yes\" Nikki said \"I was planning on keeping an eye on her.\" \"I thought as much\" Ryan said \"Well everything is ready have fun out there.\" \"Thanks\" Nikki said as she got prepared to go for the hunt. \"Don't catch something to big to carry back ok\" Ryan said teasingly. \"Ok\" Nikki said \"we will try to make sure its not too big.\" Nikki left for the hunt and saw that most of the family had already started their runs since most of them had picked up the scent of something. Nikki shifted and followed the rest of the family. It didn't take long before she saw others coming back with their own kills and she soon got her own scent of a young doe. Nikki ran after it and she was able to make the kill and take it back to the cave. When she returned to the caves with the kill she didn't see Ryan anywhere in their room but she did hear the water running in the bathroom. Nikki laid the deer down and she shifted back. She figured that Ryan was taking his shower now. \"Is that you honey?\" Ryan called from the bathroom. \"Yes it is sweetie\" Nikki said. \"Ok just checking\" Ryan said. \"Alright\" Nikki said \"I got us a doe that we can eat.\" \"Sounds good\" Ryan said \"I'll be done in a bit unless you want to come in too.\" \"I will wait on you\" Nikki said. \"Alright then\" Ryan said and soon after he came out of the bathroom though he only had a towel around him. \"I didn't feel like getting my clothes before I went in\" Ryan said smiling. \"That is fine\" Nikki said \"its not like we haven't seen each other naked before.\" \"Very true\" Ryan said as he dried himself before getting his clothes. \"I love you sweetie\" Nikki said. \"I love you too\" Ryan said and he smiled once he was in his clothes for the night. \"How are you feeling?\" \"I feel fine right now\" Nikki said. \"I can say one thing\" Ryan said \"You look great.\" \"Why thank you\" Nikki said. \"How about me?\" Ryan asked \"You have been with me for quite sometime now. How do I look to you?\" \"You are very handsome\" Nikki said. \"Well thank you\" Ryan said smiling. \"Your welcome\" Nikki said. \"I guess we should just rest for the night and we will introduce Cam to more of the family tomorrow?\" Ryan asked. \"Sammy said he would introduce her to ones he knows\" Nikki said \"and sleeping would be good.\" \"I am guessing your tired then huh?\" Ryan asked as he waited for her to climb into the bed. \"Yes I am\" Nikki said as she laid down in the bed. Ryan smiled and hugged her close again. \"Let's hope everything goes well tomorrow\" He said softly. \"I hope so\" Nikki said falling asleep. Ryan ran his fingers through her hair again, he didn't know why he liked doing that but he did. Soon he was starting to fall asleep himself. Nikki slept all night and part of the day. Ryan was up before her of course but let her sleep. He just couldn't bring himself to wake her even when Cameryn came in to see them he still let her sleep and was about to tell Cameryn that she was going to spend some more time with Sammy today. Nikki started stirring and waking up. \"Morning\" She said. \"Good morning, you slept in a bit\" Ryan said \"Are you feeling ok this morning?\" \"I don't know\" Nikki said. \"You don't know?\" Ryan asked \"What do you mean?\" Ryan went ahead and told Cameryn that she could go on with Sammy and to be careful. \"I have a headache and I feel a little nauseous\" Nikki said. \"You wouldn't be getting signs of a child this quick would you?\" Ryan asked \"I mean its only been a few days according to your uncle it should take ten.\" \"It could be\" Nikki said \"but I am not sure.\" \"I guess we will just have to wait and see\" Ryan said. \"Yea I guess so\" Nikki said. \"So what now?\" Ryan asked. \"I am not sure\" Nikki said \"I really don't feel like doing anything.\" \"Well I guess Cam will be safe with Sammy?\" Ryan asked \"Or would you like me to send your mother with them or go myself?\" \"Cam would be fine with Sammy\" Nikki said. \"You think so?\" Ryan asked \"You trust him huh?\" \"Yea I trust him\" Nikki said \"she will be fine.\" \"So what would you like me to do then?\" Ryan asked not sure what he could do since he wanted to either help her or do something with her. At these caves he didn't really have much he could do on his own. \"I don't know\" Nikki said \"you can stay in here and lay with me if you like.\" \"I would like that\" Ryan said gently climbing into the bed next to her \"Though I hope neither one of us fall asleep or we won't tonight.\" \"I hope not\" Nikki said \"I love you.\" \"I love you too\" Ryan said laying behind her for the moment. Nikki and Ryan laid together for a long time. \"I wish we had something to talk about\" Ryan said after a time \"Or something to listen to, it's too quiet.\" \"So do I\" Nikki said. \"Maybe we should ask the pack for a radio or tv?\" Ryan offered. \"It sounds good to me\" Nikki said. \"You want me to do that now?\" Ryan asked. \"Sure\" Nikki said \"also could you get my mom please.\" \"Sure\" Ryan said \"If you want me to and he left to do just that.\" It didn't take him long and he returned with both a tv and Nikki's mom. \"Hey mom\" Nikki said \"could you train Cam for a bit alone please?\" \"But her training is more or less done isn't it?\" Her mom asked \"She has control now.\" \"Yea but I was thinking one more training lesson just to make sure she is ready for the hunt\" Nikki said. \"It would have to be after she gets back from hanging out with the family though\" Nikki's mom said \"But if that is what you want to do then that's fine.\" \"Mom I love you\" Nikki said. \"I love you too but why do you want me to be only one to do it?\" She asked \"Are you ok?\" \"No\" Nikki said \"I have a headache and I feel nauseous.\" Nikki's mom knew what that could mean and she looked at her daughter \"Ok then\" She said \"Just remember that as your mother you can tell me anything.\" \"I know mom\" Nikki said \"and thank you.\" \"Your welcome\" Nikki's mom said and then she left the room. Ryan was still standing before her, unsure if she still wanted to stay in the bed. Nikki tried to move but her head hurt so much that she laid back down. Ryan looked at her and could tell that she wasn't feeling well so he laid next to her again. Nikki was falling asleep now hoping that her headache would go away. Ryan petted her hair again hoping to help her relax the headache away he was going to try and not fall asleep himself so that at least one of them would be ok to sleep at night though at the same time he kind of wanted to rest with her too. Nikki slept the whole afternoon and all night. Ryan stayed awake with her and when anyone asked he made sure that they knew what was going on and didn't worry. Cameryn didn't go on the hunt as she didn't want to go without her mom so she went to bed a little bit early and soon the whole pack was asleep for the night. Once morning came none to surprisingly Nikki got up first. \"Morning\" Nikki said. Ryan was still sleeping but he did stir a little \"Well hello\" He said \"Do you feel better?\" \"Yea a little better\" Nikki said. \"Do you still think you could be having another child already or is it just nerves?\" Ryan asked. \"Who knows\" Nikki said. \"So what now?\" Ryan asked \"You slept for most of the day and all night I don't think you want to lay about anymore.\" \"I would like to get up and move\" Nikki said. \"That's what I wanted to hear\" Ryan said smiling \"I'd even run with you if you would like me to, but if you go wolf you know I won't be able to keep up.\" \"I don't want to run right now\" Nikki said \"I just want to walk around.\" \"Walk among the family?\" Ryan asked. \"Sure\" Nikki said as she got up for the first time in a while. \"Well you don't have to you know I just thought that that would be the best thing you could do for now\" Ryan said \"And we can even take Cam and she can introduce us to some of them that she met that we haven't.\" \"Sounds good\" Nikki said \"or we could even ask Sammy.\" \"Either way\" Ryan said \"Do you want to do that now?\" \"Yea\" Nikki said \"I am ready.\" \"Alright then\" Ryan said. And the two of them left their room and went to Cam's. She was already up and had just finished getting dressed for the day. \"Hey momma\" She said smiling \"What are we doing today?\" \"I was going to meet the other members that I don't know\" Nikki said. \"Like I did yesterday huh?\" Cam said smiling \"You want me to help? I talked to a bunch of people with Sammy.\" \"Sure\" Nikki said. Cameryn was soon ready to go and the three of them went out to talk with the family. Nikki was glad to be getting to know the family because she never could before. They spent the rest of the day going around the caves talking to other members of the pack. Nikki was glad to get to know the family. \"Will you be able to go on the hunt today momma?\" Cam asked as night began to fall. \"I will try but I am going to stay close to the caves if I do\" Nikki said. \"That's fine\" Cam said excitedly \"I wanted to stay close anyway. I just want to see what's its like to hunt but I don't want to try it without you.\" \"Ok we will stay close for now\" Nikki said. \"Alright\" Cam said \"I can't wait.\" \"Remember Cam you are to stay near me\" Nikki said. \"Right\" Cam said \"I know that.\" \"Ok\" Nikki said \"do you have a dress that you can wear?\" \"The one you got me\" Cam said smiling \"But why do we have to wear dresses?\" \"It makes it easier for us to transform and we're not having to tear good clothes\" Nikki said. \"Oh I see and I guess the guys just don't wear shirts then?\" Cam asked. \"Your right\" Nikki said. \"Let's hope my first hunt goes well\" Cam said \"What should I go after?\" \"A small deer\" Nikki said. \"You think I have the energy and strength for that?\" Cam asked. \"Yes you do\" Nikki said. \"How can you be so sure?\" Cam asked. \"Because your my daughter\" Nikki said \"and I have faith in you.\" \"I believe you momma\" Cam said \"I am ready when you are.\" \"I am ready\" Nikki said. \"Then let's do it\" Cam said smiling and moving to walk out of her parents room. Nikki had followed Cam now. Soon they were outside and everyone seemed ready for the hunts but they were of course waiting on their alpha female and her young daughter. \"Are we ready?\" Sam called to them as they appeared before the pack. \"Yes\" Nikki said as she began to shift. Cam did the same and she made sure to do it carefully so that she could keep control. The two of them stayed near the caves and seached for animals. It took them a bit but they soon found a small doe near their caves. Nikki and Cam chased it down together and soon they caught it. Once it was down Nikki was about to drag it back to the caves but she saw that Cam seemed to enjoy the taste of it more so then she should. Cam was losing control a little bit, Nikki could hear the growls. Nikki had switched back now. Nikki had nodded to Cam to let her know to switch back. Cam shook her head and kept biting at the doe's neck even though it was already down. Nikki knew that Cam had to turn back or the animal mind would take over. Cam shook her head again and started to back away from the doe and shift back slowly. \"The wolf liked the....meat...\" Cam said panting \"And....the hunt itself.\" \"Yea that is what happens when your a wolf\" Nikki said \" you did well for your first hunt.\" \"Thanks mom\" Cam said \"For everything.\" \"No problem\" Nikki said as she sat on the ground. \"Should we head back to the caves?\" Cam asked. \"Yes lets\" Nikki said as she got up off the ground and walked back to the cave with Cam. As they entered the Alpha room they both saw that Ryan was making up the bed and playing music on the radio that someone had brought in earlier. \"Hey sweetie\" Nikki said as she walked into the room. \"How did Cam's first hunt go?\" Ryan asked. \"It went real well\" Nikki said \"all but her wanting to eat in wolf form and not wanting to switch back.\" \"That's not good\" Ryan said \"But I guess you helped her get control again?\" \"Yes\" Nikki said. \"I am sure she will get better\" Ryan said playing with Cam's hair \"Get some rest honey\" \"Ok daddy\" Cam said as she left the room. Nikki laid down on the bed now. \"So you two caught a doe together I see\" Ryan said \"Did she do a good job tracking it?\" \"We both did it\" Nikki said. Ryan climbed in behind her. \"You feeling ok tonight?\" He asked softly. \"I feel completely drained\" Nikki said. The days passed and soon it was easy to notice that Nikki was going to have a hybrid child. The months passed as she was coming to term and her mother came to speak to her. \"It is Ryan's right?\" She asked \"I have no idea what a hybrid child is going to be like.\" \"Yes it is Ryan's\" Nikki said. \"This has not happened with us before\" Her mom said. \"There is a first time for everything\" Nikki said weakly. \"I am still worried as to how things will go\" Her mom said \"But I suppose hybrids will happen more often now that Ryan is our Alpha and allows us to hang around humans.\" \"It may\" Nikki said weakly. \"Let's get you rested up for the baby's arrival\" Her mom said \"From the way your acting it may be soon.\" \"Ok mom\" Nikki said weakly. \"You want me to stay here for a while?\" Her mom asked. \"Yes please\" Nikki said. \"I will then and I am sure that Ryan will too\" Her mom told her. \"That would be great\" Nikki said still weak. \"Just get some rest honey ok?\" Nikki's mom told her as Ryan and Cameryn came into the room. Nikki was falling asleep now. As she slept Nikki could hear the others around her \"Is momma alright?\" Cam asked \"She will be honey\" Ryan said \"She just has things going on right now, you are going to have your baby brother or sister soon.\" Nikki was sleeping now. \"Let's just let her rest now\" Her mother said \"Ok\" Cam said leaving the room as Ryan and Nikki's mom kept watch. Nikki slept all night and was awaken the next morning by the pain that she was having. Ryan beside her and Her mother on a fold out bed that they had brought in woke up quickly \"Are you ok?\" They both called at once. \"No the pain\" Nikki said. \"Do you think the child is coming now?\" Ryan asked Nikki's mom \"I will get her ready you get the other mothers of the family\" \"Right\" Ryan said running out to do so. Nikki's mother went to her side. \"Mom there is so much pain\" Nikki said. \"It is the same as before honey\" She said \"Just make sure to breathe clearly and things should be fine.\" The other female members of the pack came in to help. Nikki did as her mother told her. Ryan was waiting outside the caves again and soon heard the cries to indicate that the baby had been born and was just fine. At least right now. He ran in to be by Nikki's side \"You have a lovely baby boy\" Her mother told her. Nikki was glad that it was over now. \"You did great honey\" Ryan said holding her hand \"Our baby boy is beautiful.\" \"I am glad\" Nikki said in a weak voice. \"Are you ok now?\" Ryan asked. \"Yes I am\" Nikki said her voice getting stronger. Nikki's mother smiled and had wrapped their baby boy up to hand it to her. \"What will you name him?\" She asked. \"I will name him Garrett\" Nikki said. \"I like it\" Ryan said \"Garrett.\" \"I am glad everyone likes it\" Nikki said. \"Let's just hope that things go well with him\" Nikki's mom said \"We have never had a hybrid before.\" \"I hope I can raise him like I did Cam\" Nikki said. \"You mean you hope we can raise him\" Ryan said smiling \"Like we raised Cam. And I am sure he will grow up fine.\" \"Yea\" Nikki said \"also mom aren't we all concidered hybrids?\" \"What do you mean?\" She asked. \"Well we are all human and werewolf\" Nikki said \"so wouldn't that make us hybrids anyway?\" \"Well I could see how you would think that when talking to Ryan\" She said \"But honestly in our creature history we are beings that can assume a human form and have human emotions so we aren't exactly human but in some ways we are.\" \"So in other words we are more beast than human\" Nikki said. \"In the begining we were but not now\" She said \"Many of us have gotten used to being in human form more and acting like humans more so we are more human then beast, though genticly we are not even close to humans only able to breed with them because of our human forms.\" \"Oh\" Nikki said. \"So to simply answer your question...\" Her mom said \"No we are not exactly hybrids with wolves ourselves but even so a child with a human would still be called a hybrid.\" \"Ok\" Nikki said \"so would Cam be considered wolf or hybrid?\" \"Wolf\" Her mom said \"As we are, considering that your uncle was her father.\" \"So is that why I am wolf because of you and dad both being one?\" Nikki asked. \"That would be it\" Nikki's mom said \"You should have had more interest when you were growing up honey, I would have told you.\" \"I know mom but I was too scared of dad to even ask\" Nikki said. \"We all were scared of your father\" Her mom said \"I understand honey.\" \"Do you think our life is easier now than before?\" Nikki asked. \"Maybe not exactly any easier but it does feel safer\" Her mom said. \"I am glad that everyone is safe\" Nikki said \"and I am also glad that we can be a huge family instead of like we were before.\" Her mom smiled \"We were always a pack\" She said looking to Ryan \"But now thanks to our new alpha we are a family too\" Ryan didn't know what to say it was the first time she had actually come out and reffered to him as the alpha like that. Nikki had smiled at this. \"Mom I know we were a pack before but you know Garrison had family that I didn't know and his flankies with him and then we had the rest of the pack I knew and you me and dad.\" \"We have all always hunted together as a pack when the time arised\" Her mom said \"At least that is what your father and uncle did. But Ryan has brought us together as a family rather then just a pack. He is a good man.\" \"I agree that he is a good man\" Nikki said. Ryan looked at the two of them and smiled \"Let's hope that we can raise Garret to be the same way\" He said. \"I think we can\" Nikki said. Ryan smiled and hugged both Nikki and Garret who was still in her arms. \"Do you want me to go get Cameryn so she can see him?\" He asked. \"Yes please\" Nikki said. Ryan smiled again and left the room to bring Cam in. She walked in slowly and looked at the little baby in her mom's arms. \"He's so little\" She said softly. \"Cam come and sit with me\" Nikki said \"and I will let you hold him.\" \"Are you sure I should?\" Cam asked \"He's so little.\" \"I think you can handle it\" Nikki said \"I will help you hold him.\" \"Ok\" Cam said softly, she was still nervous but she sat beside her mom. Nikki and Cam sat together while Cam held Garrett. \"So what do you think of having a little brother?\" Nikki asked. \"He's cute but he's so little\" Cam said smiling \"Well he will grow\" Ryan said smiling \"And who knows one of these days he might be bigger then you\" \"No way\" Cam said \"I don't think so.\" \"Cammy you never know\" Nikki said. Cam just shook her head \"Nah, it won't happen\" Ryan just smiled and played with her hair again. \"You don't think he will be a different kind of wolf like I was do you?\" She asked. \"He is a wolf but not as strong as you\" Nikki said \"he is known as a hybrid and your full wolf.\" \"Huh?\" Cam asked \"What do you mean?\" \"He will most likely be a little more human than you\" Nikki said. \"How come?\" Cam asked \"Do you already know that there is something different about him?\" \"Yes he will be different\" Nikki said \"or at least that is what I figure.\" Cam still didn't quite understand but she was going to leave it alone for now hoping to understand it better when she was older. And she knew that she was going to help raise her little brother. \"What is his name?\" She asked softly as she gave him back to her mom. \"His name is Garrett\" Nikki said as she took him back. \"Garrett huh?\" Cam said \"I guess you want me to help take care of him too?\" \"Yes please\" Nikki said \"after all you're his big sister.\" \"Yup\" Cam said smiling and she got up off the bed \"I think they both need to rest now\" Nikki's mom said smiling. Nikki slept that night and she was glad to finally have two great kids. Again time seemed to just fly by as peaceful as it was among the pack and family and soon Garrett reached the age of eight and Cameryn was thinking that something was up as he hadn't had any form of a wolf to really deal with yet. Nikki was watching them play now and she was glad to have two special kids. Cameryn, now 15 walked over to her mom. \"Hey mom when will Garrett come in to his wolf powers?\" She asked \"I was able to change before now when I was his age, do you think something is wrong?\" \"No I don't think so\" Nikki said \"but like I told you before he is a little more human than you are.\" \"He still has some of the senses of a wolf though\" Cam said watching Garrett play kickball with one of the other members of the family had got him a couple years ago. \"I can tell that when we play things like hide and seek and keep away.\" \"He has them but not as much as you\" Nikki said \"your full wolf while he is half wolf.\" \"You keep telling me that\" Cam said \"Does it have anything to do with the fact that dad is human?\" \"Yes\" Nikki said \"its about time you knew something.\" \"Knew something?\" Cam asked \"What are you talking about?\" \"Your real dad was a wolf like me\" Nikki said \"it was my uncle and he raped me so that I could have his heir being you Cammy.\" \"Dad's not my real dad?\" Cam simply asked not knowing how to take what her mom said. \"That's right\" Nikki said \"I am sorry I didn't tell you before.\" \"Where is he?\" Cam asked \"Or is he the same uncle that everyone has told me about was killed because he was too corrupt?\" \"Yes he is the same one that was killed because he was corrupt\" Nikki said. \"So I will never meet my real dad\" Cam said sadly. \"No you won't sweetie\" Nikki said \"I am sorry about this.\" \"It's in the past now\" Cam said \"As the alpha always told me, you can't change the past\" Nikki noticed how she referred to Ryan as the Alpha. \"That's right\" Nikki said \"I love you.\" \"I love you too mom\" Cam said softly. \"Cam do you have trouble switching anymore?\" Nikki asked. \"No\" Cam said \"I haven't in a long time.\" \"Just making sure\" Nikki said \"so how are you and Sammy getting along?\" \"Same as before\" Cam said \"Don't try hooking us up mom, that's not happening.\" \"Ok\" Nikki said \"and I wouldn't dream of it.\" \"Good because I don't see Sammy that way\" Cam said smiling. \"Cam put it this way I was mated with a guy that I didn't even like\" Nikki said \"and I wouldn't want to do you and your brother like that.\" \"I heard about how things were when my uncle and grandfather were in power\" Cam said \"And somehow I am glad that the leader is a human and not another wolf.\" \"So am I\" Nikki said \"and it is a lot better now than before.\" \"Because of the new alpha?\" Cam asked, she was still watching Garrett. \"Yes because of Ryan the new alpha\" Nikki said. \"So Garrett is not really my full brother then\" Cam said \"Just my half-brother.\" \"Right\" Nikki said. Ryan walked out to join them now \"Is everything alright?\" He asked \"It's fine\" Cam said simply \"We are doing fine\" Cam walked back over to play with Garrett some more \"What were you two talking about?\" Ryan asked. \"I finally told her who her dad was\" Nikki said \"and we also talked about you a little.\" \"About me?\" Ryan asked \"What about me?\" \"Just how everything is better with you around\" Nikki said\" \"Really?\" Ryan said \"Does the family really think that? I didn't do much you know, only what I thought was right.\" \"Yes really\" Nikki said \"you have brought this family together and helped us.\" \"What do you think Cam thinks of me now?\" Ryan asked \"I mean she knows that I am not her father now.\" \"I figure she still likes you as her dad\" Nikki said \"even though your not.\" \"I hope she will still call me her dad\" Ryan said \"Because even though its not by blood I am her father, I did help raise her as her father.\" \"I hope so too\" Nikki said as she continued to watch them play. \"At least they are still getting along\" Ryan said \"And I think they always will, at least I hope so.\" \"I hope they will\" Nikki said. As they watched them play they saw some of the other kids of the family come by and start playing with them. Things seemed to be going fine they were all talking and playing as Ryan and Nikki watched. Soon though Garrett came running over to them \"Mommy\" He called \"They are picking on me, I am a wolf right? Just growing into it slow like you and dad always told me right?\" \"Yes Garrett your a wolf but your half wolf not full wolf like the rest of the family\" Nikki said. \"But I will still have a wolf form right?\" Garrett asked \"I just might be late getting it?\" \"Yes\" Nikki said \" because I am wolf so you should have it too.\" \"That's good\" Garrett said \"They are wrong then, they keep saying that since my daddy isn't a wolf I won't be but daddy isn't that different from the rest of us is he?\" \"No he is no different than us\" Nikki said \"we are all human in our own way.\" \"Ok then\" Garrett said \"When do you think my wolf powers will show up?\" \"I am not sure\" Nikki said \"with you being our first hybrid we don't know.\" Garrett didn't really understand all the words him mom was saying but he smiled anyway \"I will become a wolf though right?\" He asked. \"I hope so\" Nikki said \"but who knows.\" Garrett just shrugged \"Oh well\" He said as he ran back to the others to play. \"What do you think is going to happen?\" Ryan asked. \"I don't know\" Nikki said \"he is our first hybrid in this family.\" \"Let's just hope everything goes ok\" Ryan said softly. \"So do I\" Nikki said \"he may not even be a wolf.\" \"I am hoping that he has some form of a wolf\" Ryan said \"Even if it is just half.\" \"I do too\" Nikki said. \"Who knows when or how it will come out though\" Ryan said \"But it's getting late maybe we should get things set for the hunt.\" \"Ok\" Nikki said \"Cam Garrett lets go.\" \"We have to go in already?\" Garrett wined \"Come on\" Cam said \"It's time for the everyone to get ready for the hunt.\" The family went in and got ready for the hunt all but Ryan and Garrett. \"Why doesn't daddy ever go on the hunts?\" Garrett asked \"It can't just be because he has to watch me.\" \"Hunts are for wolves\" Nikki said \"that is why your dad stays here.\" \"What about me?\" Garrett asked \"What if I never become a wolf will I never go on the hunts either?\" \"If you don't become a wolf then yes you will have to stay behind\" Nikki said. \"But I still want to run in the hunt\" Garrett said \"I can feel that need to run.\" \"I know you need to run but right now your too little to go on the hunts\" Nikki said \"One day you may be able to go with us.\" \"I am not old enough for the hunts?\" Garrett asked \"Is that it?\" \"Ok you can go but you have to stay with me\" Nikki said. \"Ok\" Garrett said smiling \"Does it make you mad mommy?\" \"No\" Nikki said \"I am just worried.\" \"Worried?\" Garrett asked \"Why? If Cammy could do it when she was seven why can't I?\" \"Because I don't know if you have any wolf in you\" Nikki said \"and it can be dangerous in the woods.\" \"Mom it doesn't matter if I am in wolf form or not\" Garrett said loudly \"I am just as strong as anyone else, what is so important about having a wolf form?\" \"Some of the animals we chase are fast\" Nikki said. \"Well so?\" Garrett said \"It's not like I want to go on the hunt to actually catch something yet. I am going so I can run.\" \"Ok\" Nikki said \"stay near me.\" Nikki had helped Garrett get ready for the hunt. \"Am I just going to run with you then?\" Garrett asked. \"Yes\" Nikki said as she got ready to go. Garrett was ready and energized to go \"This is going to be fun\" He said softly. \"Yes it will\" Nikki said. The family started the hunt and Nikki and Garrett stayed together even when Nikki went to wolf form Garrett was able to keep up pretty well. It suprised even him how fast he could run when he really tried. Nikki was still keeping an eye on Garrett even in wolf form. She sensed a buck near them, a large one, and Nikki knew she couldn't take it down alone. Luckily she also heard that Cameryn was nearby as well. Nikki had went to chase down the buck. Nikki heard both Cameryn and Garrett coming closer as she neared the buck. The three of them chased the buck together and took it down. Once it was down Garrett backed off and let his mom and sister make the kill. \"I knew things would be ok and it was so great to run\" Garrett said softly. Nikki had started dragging the buck back to the cave. Cameryn came to help and Garrett just followed them quietly. The family made it back to the cave now. \"How did things go?\" Ryan asked when they came back. Nikki switched back now. \"It went real well\" Nikki said. \"Did you have fun Garrett?\" Ryan asked. Garrett nodded. \"The buck we caught we caught together\" Nikki said. \"That's good to hear\" Ryan said. \"So how was it here?\" Nikki asked. \"Things were calm as usual\" Ryan said. \"That is good\" Nikki said. \"At any rate\" Ryan said \"We should all get some rest.\" \"Ok\" Nikki said. \"Goodnight mommy, good night daddy\" Garrett said hugging them both before he went to his own room. \"Night\" Cameryn said hugging them both gently as well. \"Night kids\" Nikki said. Cameryn smiled to her mother and left. Ryan smiled to her it looks like the kids are doing ok. Nikki had went and laid down now. \"I love you Ryan\" Nikki said. \"I love you too\" Ryan said \"How did Garrett do on the hunt?\" \"He did good\" Nikki said \"he helped me take down the buck.\" \"Really?\" Ryan asked \"How did he do that?\" \"I am not exactly sure myself\" Nikki said. \"At least he stayed safe that is the main thing\" Ryan said hugging her close. \"Yes at least he stayed safe\" Nikki said. \"I am sure that it was you that kept him safe right?\" Ryan asked. \"Yes I kept him safe\" Nikki said \"even in wolf form I watched him. \"How well did he keep up?\" Ryan asked. \"He kept up real well\" Nikki said \"it surprised me.\" \"How so?\" Ryan asked. \"He was faster than I expected\" Nikki said. \"Maybe some of his wolf traits are showing when he is human form because he is more human?\" Ryan offered. \"It might\" Nikki said \"that is why he may be fast in human form.\" \"Didn't Cam say he had the different wolf senses too?\" Ryan asked. \"Yea\" Nikki said \"she did.\" \"I guess that makes things more interesting\" Ryan said \"Should we tell your mom?\" \"Sure\" Nikki said. \"Do you want me to go get her now\" Ryan asked \"Or worry about it tomorrow?\" \"Wait until tomorrow\" Nikki said. \"You just want to rest now huh?\" Ryan asked. \"Yes\" Nikki said as she was laying down now. Ryan just hugged her close again making sure his grip wasn't too tight as she started to fall asleep \"I love you honey\" He said softly. \"I love you too honey\" Nikki said. Ryan smiled and gently buried his face into her hair again before he started to fall asleep first this time. Nikki was also falling asleep now. The two slept peacefully as they always did. But in the middle of the night Nikki heard a small voice calling to her. \"Mommy?\" He called, It was Garrett. Nikki woke up and she went to Garrett. \"What is it Garrett?\" Nikki asked. \"I had a nightmare\" He said sniffling a little \"Can I sleep with you and daddy?\" \"Sure\" Nikki said \"I don't think daddy would mind.\" \"Don't think dad would mind what?\" Ryan asked a little groggily. \"If Garrett slept with us\" Nikki said. \"Did he have a bad dream?\" Ryan asked looking to the small boy. \"Yes he did\" Nikki said. \"Come on buddy\" Ryan said patting between him and Nikki \"Climb on in here\" Garrett smiled and did so. \"Night\" Nikki said to Ryan and Garrett. \"Nighty night mommy\" Garrett said happily as he went back to sleep between them. Ryan smiled and hugged them both before going back to sleep himself. Nikki had fallen back to sleep now. The three of them were soon back asleep and before long it was morning again. Nikki woke up first and saw that the boys were still sleeping behind her. Nikki had gotten up and she headed to the kitchen to make breakfast for them. Not long after she moved away Garrett got up \"What are you doing mommy?\" He called rubbing her eyes. \"I am making breakfast\" Nikki called from the kitchen. \"Oh ok\" Garrett said \"Do you want me to wake up daddy?\" \"Sure\" Nikki said as she got breakfast done. Garrett went and woke up his dad and smiled \"Mom has breakfast done\" He said happily. \"I'm up I'm up\" Ryan said groggily. \"Cameryn breakfast\" Nikki called. Cameryn was already on the way when she called it seemed. \"Wow Garrett got in here quick didn't he?\" She said teasing her little brother. \"Yes he is quick\" Nikki said. \"He actually did sleep in here because of that nightmare\" Ryan said playing with the little boys hair as he sat the plates out for everyone. \"He had a nightmare?\" Cameryn asked. \"Yes he did\" Nikki said as she put the food on each of the plates. Garrett started eating once the food was on his plate. \"It was scary\" He said softly \"A monster was trying to get me.\" \"You don't have to worry about monsters getting you\" Nikki said \"We will protect you.\" \"I know that\" Garrett said \"But in my dream none of you were around, I thought I smelled Cameryn but I couldn't see her anywhere.\" \"Strange\" Nikki said. \"I wonder what the dream means?\" Cam asked \"I mean why would he be able to smell me like that at least while he wasn't in wolf form, you didn't have a wolf form in your dream did you?\" Garrett shook his head. \"My mom might know\" Nikki said \"but I have no idea.\" \"We can go ask her today if you like\" Ryan said finishing up breakfast \"Would you like to know what it means Garrett?\" The little boy nodded slowly. \"I hope she will know\" Nikki said. Soon all of them were done eating and Ryan stood up \"Well I guess we should go see her then before you kids go out to play\" He said. \"That is a good idea\" Nikki said as they headed to her mom. When they entered her room they found Nikki's mother was just finishing up supper herself. \"Something wrong?\" She asked as they all walked in. \"Garrett had a nightmare and we were wondering if you could possibly tell us what it means\" Nikki said. \"What did he see?\" Her mom asked her. \"Garrett you tell her\" Nikki said \"since it was you who had the nightmare.\" Garrett then described the dream to his grandmother as best he could as Ryan stood behind him to comfort him. \"I can't be sure\" Her mother said \"But I do have one idea of what it could mean.\" \"What idea is that mom?\" Nikki asked. \"I think maybe the monster was a fear of that he will never be a wolf\" She said softly \"Do you worry about that?\" Garrett nodded slowly \"All my friends say that they don't think I will be a wolf.\" \"You never know\" Nikki said \"and even if your not you will always be my son.\" \"But I want to be a wolf\" Garrett said \"Just like everybody else\" \"But my wolf wasn't like everybody else\" Cam said softly \"Huh?\" Garrett asked \"What do you mean?\" Cam was silent. \"Garrett you may be human with wolf reflexes\" Nikki said \"You never know.\" \"I don't want to be different\" Garrett said sadly \"How come I am different?\" \"Because your dad is human\" Nikki said \"that maybe why your not showing wolf at all.\" \"So it's not possible for me to be a wolf at all?\" Garrett asked \"Ever?\" \"I don't know\" Nikki said. \"None of us really know what is in store in the future dear\" Nikki's mom said, speaking to her grandson. \"We just have to wait and see.\" \"Grandma's right\" Nikki said \"We will have to see.\" \"I really hope I am a wolf too\" Garrett said \"Can we go play now?\" \"Sure go play\" Nikki said \"just be careful.\" \"Be careful?\" Garrett asked \"Why do you say that? What do we have to be careful of?\" \"Yes\" Nikki said \"besides it a habit and there is really nothing to worry about.\" Cameryn smiled she already knew her mom was going to say that since she had heard it so many times growing up. She followed her little brother outside the cave to play for a while. Nikki went outside with them as well so she could watch them. Ryan and her mother followed. \"You are raising them well\" Nikki's mom told her \"They both seem to be good kids.\" \"Thanks mom\" Nikki said \"I couldn't have done it without you and Ryan.\" \"We can only hope that things go well with little Garrett\" Nikki's mother said watching the small boy. \"I hope that he does have wolf in him\" Nikki said. \"We can only hope\" Ryan said \"And there isn't a form of a legend that tells what a hybrid would be like?\" \"None of our kind every bred with a human\" Nikki's mom said, \"So there wouldn't be any legends or stories of it. Unless...\" \"Unless what mom?\" Nikki asked. \"There might be something\" She said \"It would just be in the part of library that your dad hid from all of us, back at the old den.\" \"If dad hid it from us is it possible to find it?\" Nikki asked. \"Perhaps\" Nikki's mom said \"But what will we do about going to get it?\" \"I guess me Sammy and Ryan could go back\" Nikki said \"that is if Sammy is willing to go.\" \"What would you want me to tell Garrett and Cameryn?\" Her mom asked. \"Just tell them we had to go get something from our old den\" Nikki said. \"But remember neither one of them even know of the old den\" Nikki's mother said. \"True\" Nikki said \"I don't know what to tell them then.\" \"I could always tell them that you are simply going on an errand\" Her mom said \"As alphas that would happen every now and then.\" \"Works for me\" Nikki said \"lets see if Sammy wants to go.\" \"Alright then\" Ryan said and he followed Nikki to Sammy's part of the caves. \"Sammy\" Nikki called. \"One moment\" Sammy called back and soon after he greeted them at the door \"Oh hello\" He said \"Is something wrong?\" \"Nothing is wrong\" Nikki said \"I was just wondering if you wanted to go with me and Ryan to the old den.\" \"To the old den?\" Sammy asked \"Why?\" \"Because mom thinks that there maybe something in dad's library that might help us\" Nikki said. \"Alright\" Sammy said \"Was there any real reason you wanted me to come?\" \"It would be good just to have another person along\" Nikki said \"also I was hoping you may be able to lead us back to the old den since it has been forever since I was there.\" Sammy smiled at her \"Same old Nikki\" He said \"You may be the alpha now but you haven't changed a bit.\" \"Is that a bad thing?\" Nikki asked \"also would you be willing to go?\" \"Sure\" Sammy said smiling \"And no its not, just makes you predictable.\" \"Is it bad that I am predictable?\" Nikki asked. \"Well since we don't have an enemy of the pack or in the pack right now no\" Sammy said. \"Ok\" Nikki said \"so lets go if you two are ready.\" \"Yup\" Sammy said smiling and stepping out to walk with them \"I guess I lead the way then?\" \"Sure\" Nikki said \"and thanks for coming along?\" \"Not a problem\" Sammy said leading the way now making sure not to move too fast for Ryan \"What exactly are we going to be looking for?\" \"My dad's old library\" Nikki said \"mom said she thinks there is something in there about hybrids.\" \"Your wondering how things will go with little Garrett aren't you?\" Sammy asked. \"That's right\" Nikki said. \"And what are you hoping to find out?\" Sammy asked. \"If he has any wolf in him\" Nikki said \"and what to expect from him.\" \"And what will do if there isn't wolf in him?\" Sammy asked. \"I don't know\" Nikki said. \"We will just have to tell him he doesn't have wolf in him\" Ryan said \"He will be upset but there is nothing we can do.\" \"True\" Nikki said. Eventually the group made it to the old den and Nikki's father's library. \"Lets see what we can find\" Nikki said as she looked. \"I am guessing there is going to be a hidden area considering that they are books that your father never wanted us to see\" Sammy said moving to look for a secret compartment rather then just a book. \"There would have to be\" Nikki said as she looked for a secret compartment. Ryan started to look as well and came across it which moved a bookcase around and opened up a hidden room. Nikki walked over to the room and she went into the room. Nikki found the room dusty and full of cobwebs. The room had a few things she knew that her father always liked but only one bookshelf in the far back. Sammy and Ryan followed her, \"I'd be careful\" Sammy said \"Who knows what kind of things could be hidden in here.\" \"Yea I know\" Nikki said as she went over to the bookshelf to see if she could find anything that would help. Most of the books were about humans and what Nikki's kin thought of them. As well as what humans thought of them. But one book caught Nikki's eye 'If they were to breed'. It talked about just what they were looking for. Nikki pulled the book off the shelf and took it with her. \"Did you find something?\" Ryan asked. \"Yep\" Nikki said \"the book we were looking for.\" Nikki held up the book she found that would help them. \"Sounds about right\" Ryan said reading the title, \"I guess we should head back then?\" \"Yea\" Nikki said. \"You going to read any of it on the way back?\" Sammy asked \"Or are just going to wait and read it with your mom?\" \"Read it with my mom\" Nikki said. \"Alright\" Sammy said \"Let's go then.\" \"Ok\" Nikki said as she headed outside. The group went on back to the cave den. \"At least we didn't have a hard time finding it\" Sammy said. \"That is a good thing\" Nikki said \"at least dad had what we needed.\" \"I still wonder what it will say\" Ryan said softly \"I hope Garrett will at least have a chance to have wolf in him.\" \"I hope so too\" Nikki said \"and I won't know until mom and I read it.\" The group eventually made it back to the cave den and found Nikki's mother in the same place they had left her considering they hadn't been gone long and the kids were still playing. \"Hey mom we found the book\" Nikki said \"and I was hoping you and I could read it together.\" \"Of course\" Her mom told her, \"Would you like to read inside?\" \"Yes please\" Nikki said. \"I will watch the kids the rest of the day\" Ryan said. \"It will soon be the evening anyway\" Nikki's mother said. \"Yea it will be\" Nikki said as she followed her mom inside. \"Alright then\" Nikki's mom said taking the book and sitting on her bed \"Let's see what we can find out.\" \"Good idea\" Nikki said as the two of them were reading. They read through a few paragraphs and found that it was possible that Garrett would have wolf in him but it wasn't going to be full wolf, when he shifted he was only going to be a more werewolf looking creature and because humans are emotional creatures he would only shift under extreme emotional stress. It was said to take him years if not be impossible for him to shift when he wanted to. \"That is interesting\" Nikki said. \"I guess that's better then not having any wolf at all\" Nikki's mother said softly. \"Yea it is\" Nikki said. \"What do you Ryan will do when hears about it?\" Her mom asked. \"He will jump for joy\" Nikki said. \"Well having a half-wolf form rather then a wolf form and not being able to shift when he wants to is going to be rough\" Her mom said. \"I know\" Nikki said \"I just don't know how to tell Garrett.\" \"All you can do is tell him the truth\" Her mom told her \"He might not take well to it but there is nothing we can do.\" \"Ok\" Nikki said. \"Let's put the book away for now\" Nikki's mom said \"And go back outside to watch the kids for now.\" \"Ok\" Nikki said as she went outside. They found the kids were still having fun and Ryan was just smiling as he watched them \"What did you find out?\" He asked when he saw them come out. \"Well we know that Garrett has part wolf in him\" Nikki said. \"Part wolf?\" Ryan asked \"What do you mean part?\" \"He will shift but he will look more werewolf than us\" Nikki said. \"I wonder how he will take to that\" Ryan said \"And will he still shift just like you guys do?\" \"No he will be shift only if he is under extreme stress\" Nikki said. \"It is almost impossible for him to shift like we do\" Nikki's mom said \"Almost doesn't mean he can't, it just means its hard\" Ryan said \"We have to try and see if we can't train him to shift like you did Cameryn.\" \"It will be hard\" Nikki said \"and besides it might not work even if I did train him.\" \"It is at least worth a try isn't it?\" Ryan asked \"I mean once he shifts for the first time he will probably want more control.\" \"I could try but I have a feeling that it won't help\" Nikki said. \"Why did you work so hard with Cam and your not going to with Garrett?\" Ryan asked \"Do you have too much pride to your own kind?\" \"Fine I will train him as hard I as I did Cam\" Nikki said. \"I only want to make sure that you treat them the same\" Ryan said \"That is all.\" \"I will treat them the same either way\" Nikki said. \"I just wanted to make sure\" Ryan said \"They are both our kids.\" \"I know\" Nikki said. \"How are we going to tell him though?\" Ryan asked. \"We will have to tell him the truth\" Nikki said \"I just don't know how now.\" \"I guess we just tell him what we found out\" Ryan said \"Just that he will be half-wolf.\" \"Yea that is right\" Nikki said. \"That's all we can do\" Ryan said. Soon after that night was about to fall and the kids came inside. Nikki didn't know how to tell Garrett the truth but she knew she had too. \"Are we going to hunt tonight?\" Cam asked. \"Yea\" Nikki said \"it would be best to.\" \"Can I come again tonight?\" Garrett asked. \"Yes\" Nikki said as she got ready to go. The kids then got ready to go as well. Everyone was getting ready for the hunt now. Once they were ready Cam and Garrett came to their mom's side. The three of them left the cave together and went to wait for the rest of the family to get finished. Everyone had gathered again to wait for the hunt to start. Nikki had took off into the woods along with Cam and Garrett. Nikki shifted to wolf form now. Cam did the same as they were running and just as before Garrett was able to keep up easily. Nikki picked up the scent of an animal nearby. Nikki followed the scent now. As she got closer she saw that she had the scent of a doe again but she wasn't the only one. Nikki and them went and tried to catch the doe now. As Nikki and her children got closer she saw that there was another wolf attacking the doe, it wasn't of her pack, nor of her kind it was just a normal lone wolf and as Nikki charged for the doe it charged at her. Nikki dodged the other wolf. Garrett saw the other wolf and wondered if they would be the ones to catch the doe or if it would. The wolf then charged for Cam who also dodged. It was eyeing Garrett now. Nikki went towards Garrett in hopes to protect him. The wolf charged at Garrett seeing him as the weakest of the three, growling harshly, Garrett didn't know what to do and made soft cries for his mother as he tried to back away. Nikki jumped in the way to fight off this other wolf. \"Mommy!\" Garrett called scared for his mom. Nikki and the other wolf wound up rolling in flurry of fur, fangs, and claws. It was biting and clawing at her muzzle. Nikki was trying to bite and claw its muzzle. Cam soon came into the mix to try and help her mother fight it off. Garrett it just watched in horror his young blues wide with fear. The wolf they were facing was able to fight against both Nikki and her daughter. He was strangely strong. Nikki didn't know what to do now because she wasn't sure if the two of them could beat it. \"I want to help...\" Garrett whispered to himself softly \"Why can't I shift?!\" He yelled with frustration. \"Please let me shift please!\" Garrett wanted so badly to shift to help his mother and sister. He willed it to happen and it did. He felt his body changing getting bigger, stronger. His form was shifting but not to a full wolf, Nikki could see him out of the corner of her eye growing in size. Nikki and Cam continued to fight this wolf. Soon Garrett's new form was compete and he charged in growling both like a boy and a wolf at once. He was able to pull the wolf away and with hands almost human he tossed him aside. The wolf slammed against a tree and yelped before running off. Nikki and Cam were left facing Garrett in a form neither wolf nor boy. Nikki was glad to see that her son finally changed to his wolf form. The beast before them growled deeply but didn't shift back. Cam did though, \"What is that?\" She asked no one specifically. Nikki had switched back now. \"Its Garrett\" Nikki said \"he was able to switch.\" \"I know that but that isn't a wolf\" Cam said. \"He is a werewolf\" Nikki said \"Garrett if you can hear me switch back to human please.\" Garrett just growled at her for a moment before starting to shift back slowly \"What...happened?\" He said before falling over and passing out. Nikki picked him up and carried him home. \"Will he be ok?\" Cam asked \"What was that about?\" \"He should\" Nikki said \"and I don't know.\" They soon made it back to the caves and Ryan saw that Nikki was carrying Garrett. \"What happened?\" Ryan asked worried and running to them. \"He shifted to his werewolf form and then when he switched back he passed out\" Nikki said. \"He made it into his werewolf form?\" Nikki's mother said coming in, \"What happened?\" \"I was attacked by another wolf that wasn't part of our family and Cam came in to help\" Nikki said \"and when the two of us couldn't beat it Garrett switched to his werewolf form and fought off the other wolf and then once he switched back he passed out.\" \"So did he get hurt in the fight?\" Nikki's mom asked. \"He didn't get hurt\" Nikki said \"but Cam and I did.\" \"Are you ok\" Ryan asked \"Do you need help?\" \"I am fine\" Nikki said \"and not right now.\" \"What about you Cam?\" Ryan asked \"I'll be alright\" Cam said \"What do you want to do with Garrett right now, lay him down or try to wake him?\" Nikki's mom asked. \"I will lay him down\" Nikki said as she took him to his room. Nikki's mom followed \"What will you tell him when he wakes up?\" She asked \"I am sure he will have questions.\" \"I will just tell him the truth\" Nikki said. \"That he is only a half wolf?\" She asked. \"Yes\" Nikki said. \"Let's hope he reacts to it ok\" She said. \"I hope so\" Nikki said. \"At any rate we should just let him rest now\" Her mom said. \"Ok\" Nikki said \"and thanks mom.\" Nikki's mom smiled and walked out of the room heading back to her own. Nikki had left the room now and she headed to hers to take a shower. Ryan smiled as she got ready for the shower \"You must want to get rid of all the dirt and grime from before don't you?\" He asked. \"Yes\" Nikki said. \"Would you want me to come in there too?\" Ryan asked. \"No thanks\" Nikki said. \"Aww\" Ryan said \"Well alright then, it was worth a try.\" \"Sorry\" Nikki said. \"It's ok\" Ryan said \"I understand, maybe some other time.\" \"I love you sweetheart\" Nikki said. \" I love you too\" Ryan said softly. Nikki had finished up her shower. She turned off the shower and she climbed out and dried off. Ryan just waited for her to come out. Nikki finished drying off and she came into the room to get her gown on. Ryan just watched her with loving eyes, he was already ready for the night himself. Nikki had gotten her gown on and she laid down with Ryan now. \"Night Sweetie\" Nikki said softly to Ryan. \"Night my love\" Ryan said hugging her close and waiting for her to fall asleep. It didn't take long for Nikki to fall asleep. Ryan smiled and petted her hair gently before starting to fall asleep himself. They slept peacefully that night and soon morning came. Nikki had awaken first to the light shining in the room. Ryan was still asleep and snoring peacefully behind her. Nikki had gotten up so that she could go and check on Garrett. When she went to his room she found that he was just starting to wake up slowly and sit up. \"Hey Garrett\" Nikki said \"how are you feeling?\" \"I am ok...I think\" Garrett said \"What happened to me?\" \"You switched into your wolf form to help your sister and me out\" Nikki said \"you passed out after you switched back to yourself.\" \"I had a wolf form?\" Garrett asked surprised \"Was it strong enough to fight?\" \"Yes it was\" Nikki said \"and your more werewolf than a regular wolf.\" \"What do you mean?\" Garrett asked. \"Your a half wolf\" Nikki said \"you can only change when you are under extreme emotional stress.\" \"So I am not a wolf like everyone else?\" Garrett asked. \"No\" Nikki said \"your a half wolf which is still a wolf.\" \"Is there anyway for me to learn to control it?\" Garrett asked \"To at least shift like everyone else does?\" \"I am not sure\" Nikki said \"I will train you to see if you can.\" \"Do you think I can do it?\" Garrett asked. \"I don't know\" Nikki said \"We will try and see.\" \"When will we try?\" Garrett asked. \"Soon\" Nikki said \"just try to get some rest right now.\" \"Alright\" Garrett said laying back down now. \"If you need anything come and find me\" Nikki said \"and if I can't help we will talk to your grandmother.\" \"Ok\" Garrett said covering back up to go to sleep now. Nikki kissed him and then left the room. When Nikki left she saw that Ryan was starting to wake up in their room. Nikki had walked into her room now. \"Is Garrett ok?\" Ryan asked. \"Yes he is fine\" Nikki said \"I just told him to rest for now.\" \"That should be good for him\" Ryan said. \"Yes it is\" Nikki said \"it took a lot out of him.\" \"Did you check on Cam too?\" Ryan asked. \"Not yet\" Nikki said \"I am going to go and check on her now.\" Nikki had walked to Cam's room to see if she was alright. Cam was already up and getting ready for the day. \"Morning Cam\" Nikki said \"how are you feeling?\" \"I am ok. I guess\" Cam said \"How's Garrett?\" \"He is fine just resting right now\" Nikki said. \"That's good\" Cam said \"Did you know that his wolf form was going to be like that?\" \"I didn't know until I read a book with grandma\" Nikki said. \"A book?\" Cam asked \"What kind of book?\" \"A book that your grandfather had hidden from us\" Nikki said \"Its called \" 'If they were to breed' it talks about what would happen if humans and wolves breed.\" \"And it told what a hybrid would be like?\" Cam asked. \"Yes it did\" Nikki said \"that is how I knew what Garrett would be like.\" \"What are you going to do after he is done resting?\" Cam asked \"Are you going to train him like you did me?\" \"Yes\" Nikki said. \"Do you want me to help?\" Cam asked. \"Sure\" Nikki said. \"Do you think he will be able to control it like I was?\" Cam asked. \"I am not sure\" Nikki said \"I hope so.\" \"Why do you say your not sure?\" Cam asked \"Did the book say anything about it?\" \"It really don't mention it\" Nikki said \"or at least I don't remember seeing anything about it in there.\" \"Do you think that it will be hard to train him?\" Cam asked. \"I hope not\" Nikki said \"but I don't really know.\" \"We are going to work as hard as we can\" Cam said \"No matter how long it takes though right?\" \"Right\" Nikki said. \"When do you want to start his training?\" Cam asked. \"Soon\" Nikki said \"but I want to wait to make sure he is ready for it.\" \"I guess I will just get ready for it as well\" Cam said \"I hope we can do something to help.\" \"So do I\" Nikki said as she got ready for it. Ryan was waiting for her in the room when she came back \"Do you still want me to stay away?\" He asked \"Like I did for Cam's?\" \"Yes please\" Nikki said \"I don't know how dangerous he will be.\" \"Alright\" Ryan said \"When he does get control though I am going to have to see him. I want to know what this werewolf form looks like.\" \"You will when he gets control\" Nikki said \"I promise.\" \"But what if he doesn't?\" Ryan asked \"I mean I know he will, but the book said it was near impossible.\" \"If he don't then I will hope that he won't go into it\" Nikki said. \"If he can't get to control the shifting at least get it to where he can control the form ok?\" Ryan asked \"Promise me that?\" \"I promise\" Nikki said as she went to go get Garrett and Cam. Garrett was actually getting up and getting ready now. Cam was already in his room. \"Are we ready to start now?\" Cam asked both Nikki and her brother. Garrett just looked at his mother. \"Yes we are\" Nikki said. \"I will do the best I can\" Garrett said softly \"I hope its enough.\" \"I hope so too\" Nikki said as the three of them went out and started training. \"What do I need to do first?\" Garrett asked. \"Focus on shifting\" Nikki said \"Like this.\" Nikki had showed him how she shifted. \"Just watch us\" Cam said softly doing the same. Garrett watched and he focused but nothing was happening. He thought as hard as he could about shifting but nothing was happening. Nikki shifted back to herself now. \"I don't get this\" Nikki said \"not unless you have to be under extreme emotional stress like it said in the book.\" \"The book?\" Garrett asked \"What do you mean in the book?\" \"Come inside and I will show you\" Nikki said as she led them back to the cave. Cam shifted back and followed her back into the caves. Nikki's mother was in the room with the book. \"Are you stopping his training already?\" She asked. \"I was going to show them the book\" Nikki said \"and then I will take them back out and train him.\" Her mother handed her the book. \"What in the book are you going to show him?\" She asked. \"I was going to show them the whole book\" Nikki said \"if that is ok?\" \"Well we didn't even really read it all\" Her mother said \"But if that is what you want to do.\" \"I know\" Nikki said as she showed the kids the book. \"I am the way I am because daddy was a human?\" Garrett asked. \"Yes\" Nikki said. \"If I am this way because of daddy shouldn't Cam?\" Garrett said \"Daddy's her daddy too right?\" \"No Ryan is not Cam's real dad\" Nikki said \"her real dad is dead.\" \"Dead?\" Garrett asked surprised now \"What happened to him?\" \"Ryan and I killed him\" Nikki said \"because he had hurt a lot of the pack including me.\" \"You were the one who killed my father?\" Cam asked \"I knew he was defeated because he was corrupt but I didn't know you were the one who did it, why?\" \"Because he had raped me and that is how I ended up with you Cam\" Nikki said \"you were his heir.\" \"That doesn't tell me anything\" Cam said \"I didn't ask how I got here I asked why you had to kill him. Why not just stop him or defeat him, get the better of him. Why did he have to die?\" \"The only way to stop him was to kill him\" Nikki said \"because he was too corrupt to do it any other way.\" \"I won't believe that\" Cam said \"There had to be another way, is it possible for me to learn about him?\" \"You can talk to your grandmother\" Nikki said \"She can tell you more than I can.\" \"Well first let's deal with Garrett\" Cam said \"I am not going to stop helping him just because we are having problems\" \"What should I do now?\" Garrett asked his mom. \"We are going to try shifting again\" Nikki said. They went back outside and Garrett looked to his mother and sister once more to watch them shift. Nikki shifted again to show him how to do it. Cam also shifted again and Garrett tried once more. But as before nothing happened he didn't even start to feel a change. Cam shifted back \"Perhaps we should scare him into it\" She said. Nikki shifted as well. \"Lets try it\" Nikki said \"got any ideas?\" \"I am not sure\" Cam said \"Should we charge him or something?\" \"I guess that could work\" Nikki said. \"Ready when you are\" Cam said. \"Lets do this\" Nikki said as she shifted to where she could charge at Garrett. Garrett gasped with surprise but was able to dodge. Cam did the same and charged too but Garrett was able to dodge him as well. He had great reflexes. Nikki continued to charge at Garrett. Garrett's reflexes were quick but eventually they hit him and knocked him down. \"What can I do to fight back...\" Garrett spoke knowing that they wouldn't be able to talk back to him. He tried to concentrate again. The two of them continued to attack him. Eventually the transformation started to happen out of nothing but his wanting to fight back. The family continued to train until it got to dark. Garrett was able to transform but only after they started charging and when he wanted to change back he seemed to be very drained. Nikki had shifted back now. \"It don't look like it is going to work well\" Nikki said. \"But it did\" Garrett said slowly still feeling drained \"I have gotten better. Just keep trying mom please. \"Honey its dark\" Nikki said \"we will continue tomorrow.\" \"Ok\" Garrett said \"But tomorrow, we keep trying?\" \"Yes we will keep trying\" Nikki said. \"Ok\" Garrett said \"And I guess we aren't going to hunt tonight?\" \"Ok\" Garrett said \"And I guess we aren't going to hunt tonight?\" \"Ok\" Garrett said and the three of them went back to the caves. \"How did things go?\" Ryan asked when they came back in. \"It went real well\" Nikki said. \"You didn't have any problems?\" Ryan asked. \"A little at first\" Nikki said \"we had to charge him before he had to shift.\" \"And was he able to shift when he wanted to?\" Ryan asked. \"Not yet\" Nikki said \"we have to get him to an extreme emotional stress before he shifts.\" \"How was he at controlling it once he was shifted?\" Ryan asked. \"He did a little better with it\" Nikki said \"but we still have to work on it.\" \"I am guessing your going to let him rest and not have the hunt tonight?\" Ryan asked. \"Yea\" Nikki said \"It would be better for him to rest tonight.\" \"Alright\" Ryan said. He had started to make up the bed for the night now and would soon be done with it. Nikki had went outside for now to think. Ryan had finished setting up the bed and went out to join her under the stars. \"You ok?\" He asked seeing that she seemed to be thinking. \"Yea I am fine\" Nikki said \"just thinking.\" \"Thinking?\" Ryan asked \"About Garrett?\" \"Yea\" Nikki said. \"Do you not think that he can get control?\" Ryan asked. \"I am not sure\" Nikki said \"he is a difficult one to train.\" \"He's only the second one you have trained\" Ryan said \"You talk like you have trained many people now.\" \"I just mean that he is going to be harder to train then Cam\" Nikki said. \"Well you knew that before you started training him didn't you?\" Ryan asked. \"Yea I know but its worth a try\" Nikki said. \"Right and like you promised you will at least get him to control his wolf form if not the shifting\" Ryan said \"Right?\" \"Right\" Nikki said. \"So what will you do now?\" Ryan asked \"Since they are resting.\" \"I am going to stay out here for a bit\" Nikki said \"you can go to bed if you want.\" \"I guess the pretty night sky helps you think doesn't it?\" Ryan asked. \"Yes it does\" Nikki said. \"Would you want me to go back inside?\" Ryan asked \"I wouldn't mind staying out here with you.\" \"I don't care\" Nikki said \"I just want to think.\" \"I will be quiet and let you do so\" Ryan said just looking at the stars with her. Nikki continued to think as she wondered about Garrett. Ryan stayed quiet for a little while longer before it started getting late. He put his hand on Nikki's shoulder \"We should go inside\" He said softly \"It's late.\" \"Ok\" Nikki said as she went inside with Ryan. Ryan sighed and took off his shirt to be ready for bed as he always did and looked back to Nikki. Nikki had switched into her nightgown now and laid down with him. Ryan petted her hair gently \"I'm sure things will work out\" He said softly into her ear. \"I hope your right\" Nikki said as she was falling asleep. \"Don't have to worry\" Ryan said still petting her hair as she fell asleep \"I will do what I can to help, even if its a risk for my life.\" Nikki was asleep now. Ryan smiled and fell asleep behind her. Sadly the night was not peaceful as Nikki began to have a strong nightmare. She was left in the woods and saw what appeared to be the wolf form of both of her children before her. They were acting as if they were about to fight. Nikki had woke up now. Ryan woke when he heard cry from her nightmare. \"What happened?\" He asked worried. \"I had a nightmare that Cameryn and Garrett were going to fight\" Nikki said. \"Really?\" Ryan asked \"They wouldn't do that would they? Aren't they still getting along?\" \"They are\" Nikki said \"That is the weird part.\" \"So do you remember anything happening between them at any time that could start up a fight?\" Ryan asked \"Anything at all?\" \"Nothing\" Nikki said. \"Maybe you could ask them when morning comes\" Ryan said petting her hair again \"For now you should try to get back to sleep.\" \"Ok\" Nikki said as she tried to go back to sleep. Ryan wanted to make sure she was calm and gently moved his hand up to massage her lower back softly. Nikki was falling asleep now. \"Does that feel good?\" Ryan asked making sure she was alright now. \"Yes it does\" Nikki said in her sleep. \"Good girl\" Ryan said softly and he kissed her neck before he went back to sleep himself. Nikki was asleep now. They both slept peacefully this time and morning soon came again. Nikki woke up but she didn't want to get out of bed. Ryan was still hugging her and sleeping behind her his arm against her belly now. Nikki just laid there not really worrying about anything. Ryan started to stir and his hand gently moved around her belly. \"Morning\" Nikki said softly. \"Morning\" Ryan said just as softly hugging her close. \"I love you\" Nikki said. \"I love you too\" Ryan said \"You ok now?\" \"Yes I am\" Nikki said. \"You going to get up or just lay here a while?\" Ryan asked. \"Just lay here a bit\" Nikki said. \"Mind if I do the same?\" Ryan asked softly. \"I don't mind\" Nikki said. \"I thought as much\" Ryan said smiling and he just laid there hugging her. Nikki just laid there with Ryan. \"Comfy enough huh?\" Ryan asked. \"Yes I am\" Nikki said. Ryan just laid there with her for a few more moments. After a bit he started to massage her belly gently hoping that she would be ok with it. \"That feels good\" Nikki said. Ryan smiled and smelled her hair softly \"Your so lovable you know that?\" He asked. \"I know that now\" Nikki said. \"Too bad were not able to just lay here all day\" Ryan said. \"Yes too bad\" Nikki said. \"Well we better get up\" Ryan said softly. \"Yes we better\" Nikki said. Ryan slowly started to get up now and got ready for the day as he waited for Nikki to do the same. Nikki had gotten up and gotten ready now. Ryan watched her for a moment and soon both were ready for the day \"You going to do more training today?\" Ryan asked. \"Yea if the kids are up to it\" Nikki said. \"I am sure they are up by now\" Ryan said smiling. \"Most likely\" Nikki said as she went to go check on the kids. Garrett was still sleeping when she looked in on him but Cameryn was already getting ready for the day in her room. Nikki then went back to Ryan. \"So how are they doing?\" Ryan asked. \"Cam was getting ready and Garrett was still sleeping\" Nikki said. \"So what are you going to do?\" Ryan asked. \"Just wait until Garrett gets up\" Nikki said. \"Alright\" Ryan said and soon Cam came in to see them \"What's the plan today mom?\" She asked. \"More training for Garrett\" Nikki said \"once he wakes up.\" \"Let's hope he can get the hang of it\" Cam said \"He would be a strong wolf once he gets control.\" \"I hope so too\" Nikki said \"he will possibly be the strongest one here.\" \"That is if he can get control\" Cam said \"I will get control\" Garrett said from entering the room \"Just give me time\" \"He got his determination from his mother\" Ryan said with a smile. \"I know he will\" Nikki said. \"I am ready if you are\" Garrett said proudly. \"Ok\" Nikki said \"I am ready.\" \"Me too\" Cam said and the three went outside the caves. The three of them started to train. This time Garrett tried to change without having to be under stress but it failed \"Darn it\" Garrett said. Nikki had shifted to her normal self now. \"I don't know what to tell you\" Nikki said. \"I wish I wasn't the only one that had to deal with this\" Garrett said angry \"I wish someone knew what to tell me to help me\" With the emotional anger he had he shifted into his werewolf form. \"Well that's one way to do it\" Cam said shifting herself. \"Great job\" Nikki said. Her words fell on deaf ears as Garrett started to run off into the woods. Cam chased after him in her own wolf form. Nikki shifted and then ran after them. Nikki came closer and saw that they had both stopped and were facing each other now, almost exactly like her dream had been. Nikki knew this would not be good. The two were facing each other but they weren't moving. Both were simply growling. Nikki had to stop this but she wasn't sure how. Something in her heart told her that her kids would not attack her not if she was in human form, maybe if she got between them... Nikki switched to human form and then gotten in between the kids. Both still growled but seemed a little startled when she stood between them. \"Don't do this\" Nikki said. Cam was able to switch back \"What are you doing mom?\" She asked \"What if he hurts you?\" \"Protecting both of you\" Nikki said \"I am willing to take that risk with him just like I did you.\" \"But he has no control at all\" Cam said \"He isn't even a true wolf, we don't know what he can do.\" \"I am willing to risk this\" Nikki said \"Garrett shift back now.\" Garrett just growled and charged at her. Cam went back to wolf and jumped in to protect her mother. Nikki switched to wolf form now in hopes to fight him or get him to switch back. Cam was about to charge at Garrett and bite at his legs but he ran off again. Nikki didn't know what to do now. Cam was still in wolf form and chased after him again. Nikki went to chase them as well. Again she found them in a clearing this time Garrett had his head in claws it seemed he was fighting what he was doing just as much as trying to wake up. Nikki wondered what she should do. Cam shifted back \"Come on Garrett wake up\" She said, she figured from his posture that her little brother was still in there somewhere. \"I know you can do this.\" Nikki had switched back as well. \"Come on Son wake up please\" Nikki said almost in a cry. Garrett roared in his werewolf form, a sound almost like a child's scream and he shifted back. Falling to his knees again. \"Garrett are you ok?\" Nikki asked. \"I think....so\" Garrett said \"Help me mommy.\" Nikki went over to Garrett and hugged him. \"I think we will quit with the training\" Nikki said \"everything seems to get worse each time you shift.\" \"No!\" Garrett said \"No! I only ran because I was afraid of what I would do, It was the only thing I could make myself do. But that is some control.\" \"Are you sure you want to keep going?\" Nikki asked. \"I am sure\" Garrett said \"I want to get better don't you want me to get better?\" \"Yes I do\" Nikki said \"alright we will keep trying but if you feel like you want to quit just let me know.\" \"I won't at least not entirely\" Garrett said \"Not until I get it before I get it. But I would like to stop now because I am tired and I want to be able to hunt tonight.\" \"Ok\" Nikki said \"lets head home so that you can rest.\" \"Alright\" Garrett said and the three of them went back home. As she entered the cave Nikki saw Ryan who seemed to just be sitting and thinking \"Your back a little early\" He said softly. \"I am going to give Garrett a little bit of rest before the hunt\" Nikki said \"plus he wanted to stop for now.\" \"How did things go this time around?\" Ryan asked. \"It started out just like the nightmare I had\" Nikki said \"but he has a little control of it because he ran off because he was afraid of what he would do.\" \"You mean they faced each other like in your dream?\" Ryan asked. \"Yes\" Nikki said. \"What did you do?\" Ryan asked. \"I shifted to human and stepped between them\" Nikki said. \"And that is when he ran off?\" Ryan asked still wanting to know what exactly happened \"I just wish I could help somehow.\" \"Yea that is when he ran off\" Nikki said \"and I know but I wouldn't want you hurt.\" \"But what about you?\" Ryan asked \"Your risked your life when you stepped in didn't you?\" \"True\" Nikki said \"but if I needed to dodge all I would have to do is do it.\" \"And you don't think I could do the same things?\" Ryan asked \"I mean remember all the fights I have had with wolves.\" \"True\" Nikki said. \"I know your worried about me and I understand that but I am also wanting to help the kids\" Ryan said \"Please let me at least try, just once.\" \"Alright\" Nikki said \"You can try just once.\" \"If I get hurt its my own fault not yours\" Ryan said \"Remember that.\" I will\" Nikki said. \"I guess you want to rest before the hunt too?\" Ryan asked \"Or are you going to do something else?\" \"Rest\" Nikki said. \"Well I have to meet as the alpha with other members of the family so I will leave you to that\" Ryan said \"I don't want to be in your way.\" \"Ok\" Nikki said as she went to rest for a bit. Ryan then left the cave to go talk to others of the pack. Nikki's mother came in soon after \"I saw you come in from training a little early is everything alright?\" She asked. \"We had a little bit of a problem\" Nikki said \"also Garrett wanted to quit training for now and rest for the hunt.\" \"Oh well that's understandable\" Her mom said \"He's growing into a fine boy my dear.\" \"That he is\" Nikki said \"I am just afraid that if I keep training him it will be too much.\" \"Too much how?\" She asked. \"Too much power\" Nikki said \"It just seems harder to train him than it was Cam.\" \"Well you knew that before you started honey\" Her mom told her coming to her side \"It's going to be difficult things aren't always easy.\" \"I know mom\" Nikki said \"but I just have a feeling that he won't be able to get full control over it.\" \"What makes you think that?\" Her mom asked \"He seems as determined to get control as you were growing up.\" \"I don't know\" Nikki said \"just a gut feeling.\" \"Don't give up on him so quickly honey\" Her mom told her \"I didn't on you.\" \"I will keep trying with him\" Nikki said \"and not give up on him.\" \"That's my girl\" Her mom said hugging her close. Nikki had hugged her mom now. \"I love you mom\" Nikki said. \"I love you too honey\" She said \"Do you feel better now?\" \"Yes I do\" Nikki said \"thanks.\" \"No problem\" Her mom said. \"I guess I have to get ready for the hunt\" Nikki said. \"Not if you don't want to\" Her mother said. \"Who will take my place if I don't go?\" Nikki asked. \"What place is there to take\" Her mother said \"We don't really hunt as a group anymore, we go on our own and I can even hunt along side the kids if you want someone to watch them.\" \"That is a good idea mom\" Nikki said \"at least it would give me a chance to rest.\" \"And from the looks of it you need it\" Her mom said \"I will watch the kids you do whatever it takes to relax you promise me that? Anything that would help you relax you do ok?\" \"Ok I will mom\" Nikki said \"and I promise to relax.\" \"No matter what it may be anything that will help you relax make sure you do it all\" Her mom said teasingly as she left the room as Ryan walked back in. \"What was that about?\" He asked. \"She is wanting me to relax\" Nikki said \"she said I need it.\" \"Oh\" Ryan said \"I guess that means you won't be going out to hunt?\" \"No\" Nikki said \"mom is going to be with the kids.\" \"I see\" Ryan said \"Leaving you to relax as needed.\" \"Yes\" Nikki said. \"Would you like me to help you relax?\" Ryan asked softly \"I have done it many times before and I know I have helped.\" \"Sure after I take a shower\" Nikki said. \"Alright\" Ryan said \"I will leave it up to you if you want me to come along, as I always do.\" \"Not this time\" Nikki said \"I just want to be by myself for now.\" \"Fair enough\" Ryan said \"I will just wait for you then I can understand that you want to be alone every so often.\" \"Thanks\" Nikki said as she went and took a relaxing shower. Ryan just simply waited for her. He wasn't about to disturb her in anyway. Nikki had finished a shower and she cut the water off and she climbed out and dried off. Once she dried off she headed into the room and she got dressed in her gown. Ryan just watched her calmly with loving eyes. \"Your so beautiful\" He said \"You know that don't you?\" \"Yes I know that\" Nikki said \"you have always told me that.\" \"Do you feel better after your shower?\" He asked. \"Yes I do\" Nikki said as she laid down. \"Is there anything that you would like me to do to help you relax?\" Ryan asked as he laid next to her. \"Belly rub like you did before\" Nikki said. Ryan smiled and complied rubbing her belly gently just as he had done before. Nikki liked it and she was falling asleep to it. \"Hey now your not supposed to fall asleep\" Ryan said playfully \"Just relax.\" \"Sleeping is still relaxing\" Nikki said. \"I guess\" Ryan said smiling \"But I would rather have you up to talk to.\" \"I won't go to sleep then\" Nikki said waking up. \"Your so compliant these days\" Ryan said still smiling \"It's a wonder you were able to rebel against your father in the first place.\" \"Is that a bad thing?\" Nikki asked. \"No\" Ryan said \"I don't guess so, just makes you predictable.\" \"I know I am just too predictable\" Nikki said. \"Would it be so wrong to surprise people every now and then?\" Ryan asked \"I know you have in you. I've known you for a long time now, might as well be forever.\" \"I guess not\" Nikki said \"Ryan how would you like to get married soon?\" \"What brought this idea?\" Ryan asked genuinely suprised \"We have been together for over 12 years. And I have no connections with any of my family and yours aren't really the church going type if you know what I mean. We can if that is what you want to do but in my eyes we already are.\" \"True\" Nikki said \"but could we at least get a ring to show our love?\" \"I could do that\" Ryan said \"I wouldn't mind it. We can even write our own vows if you would like.\" \"That works\" Nikki said \"I know I may need my mom's help.\" \"I love you\" Ryan said softly as he leaned in for a soft kiss \"My love in the moonlight.\" \"I love you too\" Nikki said as she leaned in for the kiss \"your my prince in the moonlight.\" Ryan kissed her softly and smiled at her watching her eyes. He loved them so much, they just seemed to pull him in. Nikki kissed him as well. \"How often have I told you that I love your eyes?\" Ryan asked softly. \"I believe this is the first time\" Nikki said. \"Really?\" Ryan asked \"Well I do I think they are magnetic.\" \"Thank you\" Nikki said \"I think your eyes are hypnotic.\" \"Why do you say that?\" Ryan asked. \"I just get sucked in and fall under their spell\" Nikki said. \"I think I like the sound of that\" Ryan said then he leaned closer to whisper in her ear \"If only I could hypnotize you\" He smiled and went back to laying beside her. \"You know that probably wouldn't work\" Nikki whispered as she laid there. \"Yeah I know\" Ryan said. \"When do you want to go into town to get the rings?\" Nikki asked. \"How about tomorrow after you train for a little bit?\" Ryan asked. \"Works for me\" Nikki said. \"What do you want to do now?\" Ryan asked. \"I guess just lay here\" Nikki said \"since my mom wants me to rest.\" \"Too bad if I do anything to relax you you would probably fall asleep\" Ryan said smiling and moving to lay beside her. \"What would be wrong with me falling asleep?\" Nikki asked. \"Because I'm not tired and if you fall asleep I got nothing to do\" Ryan said with a joking smile. \"True\" Nikki said \"I love you.\" \"I love you too\" Ryan said \"If you want a massage I will still give it to you.\" \"That sounds good\" Nikki said. \"Where would you like it?\" Ryan asked. \"Any where you want to give it to me\" Nikki said. \"They would all put you to sleep wouldn't they?\" Ryan asked. \"Yea so what about it\" Nikki said \"I like them just the same.\" \"I guess your right\" Ryan said placing his hands on her stomach so he could massage her there first. Nikki liked this and she moaned when he done started to gently move his hands up to her breasts feeling her soft skin under his finger tips. Nikki continued to moan. Ryan smiled and stopped to look into her eyes again. Nikki stopped moaning for now. Ryan kissed her cheek now gently moving her hair away as he kissed her neck as well. Nikki moaned as he kissed her neck. Ryan stopped for now and just laid beside her. \"I guess you enjoyed that huh?\" Ryan asked softly. \"Yes I did\" Nikki said. \"I think it would be best to leave you alone for now\" Ryan said \"I wouldn't want to get your body riled up.\" \"Ok\" Nikki said as she sat up. \"What are you doing?\" Ryan asked softly. \"Just sitting up\" Nikki said. \"Oh ok\" Ryan said just laying on his back beside her for now. Nikki sat up now because she couldn't lay down much longer. \"Are you ok?\" Ryan asked \"Does something hurt?\" \"I am fine\" Nikki said \"I just can't lay down.\" \"I just want to make sure you ok baby\" Ryan said \"You would tell me if something hurt right?\" \"Yes I would tell you if I was hurting\" Nikki said. \"I am always going to be here for you\" Ryan said placing his hand on her back gently. \"I know\" Nikki said \"and I am glad you are.\" Ryan sat up beside her now to hug her shoulders gently and at that point Nikki's mother and the kids came back in. Nikki was still sitting up on the bed. \"Did you rest like I wanted you to?\" Nikki's mom asked her. \"Yes I did\" Nikki said \"also how did the hunt go?\" \"Things went well\" Her mother said \"We caught a doe\" Cam said as she pulled it in. \"That's good\" Nikki said \"how did Garrett do?\" \"He kept up with us as expected\" Her mom said \"And he didn't shift and lose control this time.\" \"Good\" Nikki said \"at least he kept up with both of you.\" \"Well I am going to go back to my room and rest\" Her mom said \"It has been a long time since I was on the hunt and I am tired.\" \"Ok\" Nikki said \"also mom thanks for going with them.\" \"Not a problem\" She said as she left the room. \"I guess we need to get to bed too\" Cam said walking with Garrett to their rooms. \"Night kids\" Nikki said. \"Good night mommy\" Garrett called as he left his parents room. Nikki had laid back down now. \"I guess now I could give you that big massage if you want it\" Ryan said smiling \"It's time for bed now anyway.\" \"That would be fine\" Nikki said. Ryan looked into her eyes again before he did just that moving from her belly down to her lower body to give it a good massage to help her relax. Nikki was relaxing now and as he massaged her she was moaning. Ryan kept it going a little longer before he stopped and moved his hand back to her belly to hug her tight. \"I love you more then you will ever know\" He whispered into her ear softly as he kissed her neck. \"I love you too\" Nikki whispered as she moaned a small bit when he kissed her neck. \"I could just kiss you all over if you let me\" He said into her ear still \"Your that lovable.\" \"Go for it\" Nikki said. \"You would have to set yourself up for me to do that\" Ryan said with a smile \"Unless you want me to take everything off myself.\" \"I will\" Nikki said as she got up and took off her nightgown and her undergarments. Ryan just watched her as she did so and gently laid on top of her when she laid back down. \"You ready?\" He asked looking into her eyes. \"Yes I am\" Nikki said. Ryan first kissed her lips deeply and passionately making sure that she let him in and he didn't invite himself. He then ended that kiss and moved to her neck. Nikki was liking this and as he moved down to her body she moaned. Ryan moved on down to her chest and gently licked between her breasts before moving one hand up to massage one side as he kissed and suckled the other before switching and doing the same to the other side. With his free hand he tickled her belly before moving down to kiss it. Nikki had moaned as he done this. Ryan kissed her belly button before starting to move lower. He knew that she was really going to moan when he started to kiss her lower body and he was looking forward to it as he started. Nikki was moaning more now as he kissed her lower. Ryan gave it one last blow before moving back up to her face to look into her eyes again. Nikki moaned when he did that. \"I loved it\" Nikki said. \"Did you now?\" Ryan asked laying down beside her and grabbing her hand. \"Yes I did\" Nikki said as she held his hand. \"Somehow I could tell that\" Ryan said with a smile as he placed her hand on his belly for the moment. \"I think the moans were evidence of that.\" \"I guess so\" Nikki said. \"Do you want to go to sleep now?\" Ryan asked. \"Yea\" Nikki said \"it would be good.\" Ryan let go of her hand to let her move it and her arm to wherever she wanted. Nikki had gotten up and got her clothes back on and she laid down on her side with one arm under her pillow and the other one holding a teddy bear. \"That's my girl\" Ryan said wrapping his arm around her as he always did as she laid down with the bear. \"I wish I was as lucky as that bear\" He adding jokingly. \"Night\" Nikki said as she fell asleep. \"Night\" Ryan said softly petting her hair with his free hand as she went to sleep. Nikki was fast asleep now. Ryan smiled and went to sleep himself. The two slept peacefully that night and soon morning came again. Nikki woke up first as always and she got up and got changed into her clothes. Ryan was soon awake and did the same. Nikki finished and she went to the kitchen to make something to eat. Ryan was up soon and went with her. \"Morning\" Nikki said as he came into the kitchen. \"Morning honey\" Ryan said. \"How did you sleep?\" Nikki asked. \"Pretty good I guess\" He said as he waited for her to finish the food. \"Want me to go get the kids?\" \"Sure get the kids\" Nikki said \"and I am glad you slept good.\" Ryan left the kitchen to get the kids and soon returned so that they could all eat breakfast. Nikki had plated the food now so that everyone could eat. Ryan started eating soon after as did the kids. Nikki soon sat down at the table and started eating. \"So are we going to go train today mommy?\" Garrett asked. \"Not sure yet son\" Nikki said. \"Not sure?\" Garrett asked \"Why do you say that?\" \"I just think that you may need to rest\" Nikki said \"but if you want to we will train in a bit.\" \"You know best I guess mom\" Garrett said. \"Do you feel up to training?\" Nikki asked \"or do you want to rest?\" \"I can rest if you think that that is best\" Garrett said. \"Rest it is\" Nikki said. \"Ok then\" Garrett said \"But what will you do?\" \"Cook\" Nikki said \"besides I think I have an idea for a dessert that you will like.\" \"What is that?\" Garrett asked. \"You will have to see\" Nikki said \"Cam would you go gather the ingredients for the dessert please?\" \"What do you have in mind?\" Cam asked coming on the other side of the table so she could whisper it in your ear. Nikki whispered what she wanted to do to Cam. \"Alright\" Cam said smiling \"I will get right to it\" and she left the kitchen and the cave. \"Garrett go ahead and go play in your room please\" Nikki said. \"Alright then\" Garrett said leaving the room now. Nikki was getting everything set up for the dessert now. \"So what kind of dessert do you have in mind?\" Ryan asked coming beside her \"Do you want my help making it?\" \"I am going to make a berry pie\" Nikki said \"and I don't think I need help right now.\" \"Alright\" Ryan said \"If you say so.\" Nikki was working on the crust now trying to get it ready for the berries. Not too long afterwards Cam came back with the berries she was needing. Ryan just watched her for now. \"Thank you Cam\" Nikki said as she took the berries and washed them and cut them to fit in the pie. \"It already looks good\" Ryan said smiling. \"Smells good too\" Cam said \"I love those berries.\" \"I am glad you like them\" Nikki said as she finished with the berries and put the pie in the oven to cook. \"You want me to go and tell Garrett he can come back in since it's almost done?\" Cam asked. \"Sure\" Nikki said as she took the pie out of the oven and placed it on the stove to cool. Soon after Cam and Garrett came back in \"Something smells good\" Garrett said. \"I hope you like it\" Nikki said as she placed a piece of pie on each plate. Garrett tried it once and then kept eating it. He loved it. \"Wow I have never seen anyone chow down on a pie\" Nikki said laughing. \"At least you know he likes it\" Ryan said smiling. \"Yea at least we know that\" Nikki said. \"So we going to head out in a bit to go to town then?\" Ryan asked. \"Yes we will\" Nikki said. \"Alright then\" Ryan said. Nikki had finished her slice of pie and she went to the room to get changed. Ryan followed so that he could change too. \"Honey do you think we should take the kids?\" Nikki asked. \"We can if you like\" Ryan said \"Why do ask though?\" \"I was just making sure it would be ok\" Nikki said as she finished up changing. \"Well of course\" Ryan said \"They need to see town anyway.\" \"Cam Garrett get ready\" Nikki called. \"Where are we going?\" Garrett asked. \"We are going into town\" Nikki said. \"Town?\" Cam asked \"As in the human one?\" \"Yes\" Nikki said. \"We never went there before\" Cam said \"As much as interests me to go, why are we going now?\" \"Your dad and I are going to pick up something\" Nikki said. \"And do you know where this something would be in town?\" Cam asked \"I mean are we going to be there long?\" \"Yes we know where it is at\" Nikki said \"also we maybe there a while.\" \"And what about me\" Cam asked \"I mean I know Garrett is going to follow you around but from what I read human's my age don't hang around their parents all the time.\" \"If you like you can go to a store you like\" Nikki said \"or if you want you can just stay here and wait on us to get back.\" \"That's why I was asking\" Cam said getting hyper now \"I wanted to be able to explore.\" \"Ok you can explore\" Nikki said \"but meet us at the jewelry store when you get done please.\" \"I will\" Cam said happily getting ready now. Garrett was already ready. \"Thank you Cam\" Nikki said. \"Your welcome mom\" Cam said. \"Are we ready to go now?\" Ryan asked. \"Yes\" Nikki said. \"Let's head out then\" Ryan said and the family went towards town. \"Ok\" Nikki said \"mom we are heading out for a bit.\" \"Alright then\" She said waving goodbye to them and smiling \"Be careful its a regular forest out there.\" \"We will be\" Nikki said as they left. \"How far is it to 'town'?\" Garrett asked speaking of town as if it was a name. \"It is through the woods\" Nikki said. \"So we will be there soon then?\" Garrett asked \"I can't wait to see this place.\" \"If your good we may buy you something\" Nikki said \"that is if it is ok with your dad.\" \"Buy me something?\" Garrett asked \"Ok I will be good then.\" \"Ryan is that ok?\" Nikki asked \"after we get the rings of course.\" \"Fine by me\" Ryan said \"I should have enough money for much more then that in my bank account considering the interest over the years.\" \"Ok\" Nikki said \"It would be great to get him something.\" \"Let's get us some money first and then we will see what we can get\" Ryan said with a smile as they made it to the outer edge of town. \"Welcome to town\" Nikki said to Garrett and Cam. \"It looks interesting\" Garrett said \"But where are all the people\" \"Probably inside their homes right now\" Ryan said with a smile. He offered his hand to his son \"Let's go ok?\" \"Ok\" Garrett said taking his fathers hand to cross the road. Nikki was glad to be back in town again. Cam saw a nearby clothing store and other teenagers walking around \"Can I go mom?\" She asked pointing \"I promise not to say what I am.\" \"Alright just be careful\" Nikki said \"also remember meet us at the jewelry store.\" \"How long do I have?\" Cam asked. \"Three hours I would think\" Ryan said judging how long it would take at the bank. \"Sounds right\" Nikki said. \"Ok\" Cam said moving on to the clothing store. \"Are you sure she is going to be ok?\" Ryan asked. \"Yes she will be fine\" Nikki said \"besides I don't want her to have to sneak around like I did when my dad was around.\" \"That's a good point\" Ryan said \"Maybe she will make a friend right?\" \"I hope she will\" Nikki said \"it would be great for her to have a human friend.\" \"If she is anything like you it won't be hard\" Ryan said. They had made it closer to the bank \"Let's hope my account is still active after all these years. \"I hope so too\" Nikki said \"it would be bad if it was closed.\" The two walked into the bank to see if they could get the money they needed. Meanwhile back at the clothing store Cameryn was seeing what kinds of things the human teenagers were wearing and with her keen ears she could even tell what sort of things they were talking about. At first it seemed like she was just as alone as she was when she walked in but at some point a younger girl, also alone walked up to her. \"Hi\" She said \"I haven't seen you around before.\" \"Hi\" Cameryn said \"I am new here my name is Cameryn.\" The girl smiled \"I would have guessed you were new\" She said \"Your clothes give that away, no offense. My name's Jackie.\" \"It is nice to meet you Jackie\" Cameryn said. \"Same here\" Jackie said \"would you like me to help you get some new clothes?\" \"I am just looking right now\" Cameryn said \"but thanks anyway.\" \"Can I at least walk with you?\" Jackie asked \"I'm here alone too you know.\" \"I would like that\" Cameryn said. \"Alright then\" Jackie said \"I guess you haven't been in this store before huh?\" \"No\" Cameryn said \"I have never been to town before.\" \"Well its good you let me walk around with you\" Jackie said \"I could show you around if you like.\" \"That would be great\" Cameryn said \"I am grateful.\" \"Follow me then\" Jackie said leading her around the store. \"Are you going to be going to any of the schools around here?\" Jackie asked after a while.\" \"I am not sure\" Cameryn said. \"Well if you ever do find out and come to the local high school in this town look for me\" Jackie said \"I'd like to keep in touch\" She then smiled teasingly \"Just make sure that you get some clothes that are more 'in'.\" \"I will be sure to\" Cameryn said. \"You want to meet some of my other friends?\" Jackie asked \"They are back at the mall, none of us are popular but still, we are nice people. We don't bite at least.\" \"Sure\" Cameryn said. Jackie then lead Cameryn to the mall not too far away from the clothing store. Cameryn saw a clock nearby, the same one her dad had looked at before. She hadn't been gone even an hour yet she would have time to hang around this 'mall' for a while. Cameryn liked having a friend like Jackie. As they walked into the mall Cameryn saw lots of other teenagers around her age at the food court. \"Hey guys\" Jackie said waving to her friends, three other girls and two guys. Cameryn smiled at this. \"This place smells delicious\" Cameryn said. \"Smells delicious?\" Jackie said \"Odd comment... anyway these are my friends Joyce, Raven, and Dawn. The boys are Max and Tracy\" \"And she is...\" The darker haired of the boys asked his voice sounding strong. \"Chill out Max\" Jackie said \"She's a new girl, her name's Cameryn\" \"I can see she's a new girl, no sense of style\" The blond of the girls started \"Hush\" Jackie said \"I already talked to her about that Joy\" The brown haired boy, Cameryn guessed he was Tracy remained quiet but something about him almost attracted Cam. \"Its nice to meet all of you\" Cameryn said. \"I'm Raven\" Said the darkest haired of the girls, in a voice that would have scared Cameryn if she hadn't been raised around the people/wolves she had been around. Everyone else started talking as they ate about the different current events going on around town. Cameryn wasn't really interested but Tracy had still remained silent and Cameryn couldn't help be drawn to look at him every now and then. For the quiet one of the group he had really strong green eyes. \"Its nice to meet you Raven\" Cameryn said \"also does Tracy ever talk?\" \"He's shy\" Said the third girl, Dawn apparently. \"Yeah\" Max chimed in, \"Never trust the quiet one right Trace?\" He elbowed the green eyed boy who just simply nodded and said nothing. He eyed Cameryn now and as soon as their eyes met Cameryn was stuck, she would have to find a way to hear that boy's voice. \"That is strange\" Cameryn said \"why is he so shy?\" \"Well you CAN talk to him\" Jackie said \"But only one on one, he doesn't like talking to alot of people at once.\" \"Maybe I can talk to him\" Cameryn said \"also what time is it?\"\"We got about 11:30\" Dawn said looking at her watch. It had been an hour and a half now. Cam still had another hour left if she gave her self half an hour to find the jewlery store. \"Sure you can I guess\" Jackie said \"If he is ok with it\" Tracy nodded and got up to walk with her to a nearby bench. \"Ok I will try talking to him\" Cam said. Cam went to sit with Tracy now. \"Hey Tracy\" Cam said. \"Hi\" was all Tracy said in response, his voice soft. \"I am Cameryn but you can call me Cam\" Cameryn said. \"Ok...Cam\" Tracy said, the way he said her name almost sent chills down her spine. Something about this boy was very alluring to her even though he was so quiet. \"When did you...first move into town?\" He added after a time. \"I just moved here\" Cam said \"how long have you lived here?\" \"Most of my life\" Tracy said \"My parents moved here when I was very young. Have you got things set at a college yet?\" \"Not yet\" Cameryn said \"I don't know if I will be going yet.\" \"So you may not be staying in this town is it?\" Tracy said \"Your parents move around a lot?\" \"Yes we do\" Cameryn said. \"Let's hope that you make it to the school\" Tracy said smiling, \"Or at least don't move to far away that you can't come by every now and then.\" \"I hope not\" Cameryn said \"also I need to meet my parents at the jewelry store but I don't know where its at can you show me?\" \"When did you need to meet them?\" Tracy asked. He looked at his own watch it was 12:15. Cameryn had forty five mins now. \"Soon\" Cameryn said. Cameryn hoped that she could make it there before time. \"I will lead the way then\" Tracy said getting up and the two of them started to leave the mall. \"Hey now where are the two of you going?\" Max called to them. \"I have to meet my family\" Cameryn said \"and it was nice meeting all of you and thanks for a great time Jackie.\" \"No problem\" Jackie said waving \"Hope to see you around Cameryn.\" Tracy then walked on with her out of the mall. And move down the street towards where he knew the jewelry store to be. Cameryn stayed silent now. They made it to the jewelry store with about ten minutes to spare. Cameryn could see her parents waiting for her there. \"Thank you\" Cameryn said. \"No problem\" Tracy said starting to leave. Cameryn had walked into the store now. \"Did you have fun?\" Ryan asked. \"Yeah it was interesting to hang out with humans for a while\" Cam said. \"I am glad you had fun\" Nikki said \"also who was the guy with you?\" \"I met a girl in the clothing store and after walking around there for a while she invited me to go with her to the mall and once there introduced me to her friends\" Cam said \"That was one of them, his name is Tracy.\" \"That is good\" Nikki said \"he seems sweet.\" \"He's a nice guy\" Cam said \"He's so shy though, he won't talk to more then one person and even when he does talk its very soft.\" \"Maybe you can help him\" Nikki said. \"I would like to\" Cam said \"But I am not sure how.\" \"You will figure it out\" Nikki said \"maybe you could date him.\" \"Date him?\" Cam said \"I guess I could, I like that.\" \"I think it would be good for you\" Nikki said \"your old enough to date now.\" \"Thanks mom\" Cam said \"Did you guys get everything you need?\" \"Yup\" Ryan said \"We now need to find something for little Garrett. What are you thinking of getting him honey?\" \"No problem honey\" Nikki said \"also I think we could get him something he wants.\" \"I don't know what's here to get\" Garrett said smiling like little kids did \"I don't know what I would like\" Ryan looked to Nikki \"You want to go back to the mall that Cam saw and look around?\" He asked. \"That would be a good idea\" Nikki said. The family headed back to the mall. Cam thought maybe she would see her new friends there again but she couldn't be sure. The family had entered the mall now. \"Wow this place is nice\" Nikki said. Cam looked to the food court but couldn't see any of Jackie's friends, maybe they all left. \"So what do you think we should get for him?\" Ryan asked playing with Garrett's hair again. \"An action figure perhaps?\" \"That sounds good\" Nikki said \"Cam would you like something from the mall?\" \"Not really other then some new clothes\" She said smiling as she remembered what Jackie and them had said. \"If I am going to be coming by to see Tracy.\" \"I think we can do that\" Nikki said \"Ryan what do you say?\" \"Sounds fine by me\" Ryan said smiling \"I will go find Garrett his toy and you two go to ladies area.\" \"Ok\" Nikki said as her and Cam went to the clothes. \"Hey mom how much did you come to town when you were around my age?\" Cam asked \"I bet grandpa didn't like you doing it since he doesn't trust humans.\" \"I was always coming to town\" Nikki said \"Your grandfather never even knew that I was sneaking around that was until he followed me one day.\" \"What did he do?\" Cam asked \"Was he mad?\" \"He had attacked me Ryan and yes he was mad\" Nikki said \"but we got rid of him by burning him just like we did to your dad.\" \"Is that what you do to everyone that is 'corrupted'\" Cam asked softly \"Burn them and kill them?\" \"Yea\" Nikki said \"our kind are weak to fire and silver and Garrison was one that was killed by silver and your dad and my dad we killed with fire.\" \"Would you do that to anyone?\" Cam asked \"No matter who they were?\" \"Depends\" Nikki said. \"Depends on what?\" Cam asked. \"Depends on who they are and if they are very corrupt\" Nikki said. \"So you wouldn't just kill anyone right?\" Cam asked looking at some of the shirts now. \"No it wouldn't be just anyone\" Nikki said \"also do you see anything that you want to try on.\" \"I think so\" Cam said picking out a couple of the shirts and pants. \"Go ahead and try them then\" Nikki said. That's just what Cam went and did moving into the dressing room to try a few of the outfits on. Nikki waited for Cam. Soon after leaving Cam came back \"I like them all\" She said happily. \"Lets get you a couple of them now\" Nikki said \"and then we will came back for the rest.\" \"Sounds good to me\" Cam said \"Let's find dad and Garrett now.\" Nikki and Cam went to pay for the outfits and then they went to look for Garrett and Ryan. It didn't take them long to find them in the toys. Garrett had already picked quite a few action figures. \"Wow you really have a lot there\" Nikki said \"also we have few more outfits for Cam to pick up.\" \"We can come back and get them\" Ryan said \"Or she can on her next visit.\" \"Cam what do you say come back and get them or get them on your next trip?\" Nikki asked. \"I can get them if you guys give me the money\" Cam said \"I guess.\" \"Sure thing\" Nikki said. \"Well for now lets go back home\" Ryan said with a smile \"I think Garrett has enough toys to last a while.\" \"So do I\" Nikki said. With that the family went back to the woods towards their caves. \"I had a great time\" Nikki said \"today was fun.\" \"I had fun too\" Cam said \"And I hope to be able to come again and have just as much fun. The other kids asked me about school.\" \"Are you wanting to go?\" Nikki asked. \"Would I be able to?\" Cam asked. \"I think so\" Nikki said \"Ryan what do you think?\" \"I guess she could but since she has never been we would have to find a way to forge transcripts\" Ryan said. \"I don't we have to go that far\" Nikki said. \"Well how will we explain her not having any schooling?\" Ryan asked \"I mean I have been in school before but she never has.\" \"Just tell them that we never had a chance to put her in it\" Nikki said. \"Well I guess if that's what you want to do then that's fine\" Ryan said \"I am just being realistic and who knows what that will do to the classes she is eligible for, the school might treat her as a handicap.\" \"Who knows\" Nikki said. \"It's whatever you and her think is best\" Ryan said \"Though its her school life, if she wants it.\" \"I think we can just tell them that we didn't have any way to put her in school\" Nikki said. \"Fair enough\" Ryan said \"We will see how that works.\" \"I hope it will work\" Nikki said \"because that is partly the truth.\" \"Yes I know\" Ryan said \"And lying I guess is something we should try to avoid.\" \"Yes we do need to avoid that\" Nikki said. \"Alright then\" Ryan said nodding \"When do you want to enroll her?\" Cam just shrugged not really caring when they did it. \"Soon\" Nikki said \"but its up to Cam too.\" \"I say in a couple days would be good\" Cam said \"I would like to go by tomorrow to get some new clothes first.\" \"Sounds good to me\" Nikki said. The family had now made it home and it was just getting to the afternoon. \"Are we still going to train today?\" Garrett asked gently. \"For a little while\" Nikki said. \"Ok\" Garrett said quickly going to his room to put his new toys away before he came back out ready to train. \"Cam would you be willing to help even after you start school?\" Nikki asked as she stayed outside. \"When it didn't interfere\" Cam said \"I don't know when I would be going to school during the day.\" \"Ok\" Nikki said \"also if I need help I will ask your grandmother if you can't do it.\" \"That's ok by me\" Cam said. \"It works for me\" Nikki said as she waited for Garrett. \"I am ready to go\" Garrett said happily \"And I think I am going to better this time.\" \"We will see\" Nikki said as her and Garrett headed to the spot they trained. \"I will go to my wolf form first\" Garrett said. He set himself up and was soon starting to change. It seemed he had somehow gotten the ability to change on command now. Nikki was surprised to see this now and she was happy for him. He growled for a few moments but stopped soon enough. He just looked at them now. Nikki was speechless now and she was glad that Garrett was able to switch on command. \"Now we have to test his control right?\" Cam asked her mother. \"Right\" Nikki said. \"Should we shift and attack to test that?\" Cam asked \"Or do you have another way?\" \"Shift and attack\" Nikki said. Cam shifted and waited for her mother to do so before she would charge. Nikki shifted as well and charged. The two charged and Garrett just simply jumped out of the way. At first it looked like he was doing just fine but suddenly a growl came from deep in his throat, almost inhuman and he charged for Cam. Nikki had come in for another attack. The second attack from his mother had thrown Garrett off course and he didn't make contact with Cam. Garrett shock his head as he was struck by his mother and slowly began to shift back. Nikki had shifted back now. \"I'm sorry\" Garrett said a little out of breath when he was back in his human form. \"This wolf is so hard to keep under control.\" \"Its ok\" Nikki said \"hopefully you will get control over it.\" \"Maybe we should stop for today\" Garrett said. \"Ok that is fine\" Nikki said. \"Let's head back then\" Cam said. \"Works for me\" Nikki said. The three of them went back to their caves, the kids going to their own rooms and Nikki going to her and Ryan's. When she walked in she found the bed already made for the night, Ryan was no where to be seen but she heard the shower running. Nikki had switched into her nightgown now. Ryan could hear her moving around from in the shower after he turned the water off. \"That's you isn't it my love?\" He called as he began to dry himself off. \"Yes it is\" Nikki said. \"How did things go in training?\" Ryan asked coming out of the bathroom now with a towel around his waist as he went to gather his clothes. \"He did well in the shifting\" Nikki said \"but we had a little problem with his control.\" \"He's still having a hard time controlling his form?\" Ryan asked dropping the towel as he started to put his clothes on now \"I am sure he will get it eventually.\" \"I hope so\" Nikki said. Ryan had his night clothes on now which were just a pair of shorts and no shirt. He waited to see if Nikki was ready to lay down. Nikki laid down now ready to sleep. Ryan laid down beside her and wrapped his arm around her as he always did. \"We've had a busy day today don't you think?\" He asked. \"Yes we did\" Nikki said \"it was a great day.\" \"And thankfully I still had money for us to use too\" Ryan said smiling \"Do you really think its a good idea for Cam to go to the school?\" \"I think so\" Nikki said \"we can't keep her from an education.\" \"That's true\" Ryan said \"But what about the others from the family? Do you think they would want it too?\" \"I don't know\" Nikki said. \"I guess after we openly send Cam to school the others of the family will ask about it\" Ryan offered \"And if they do we can let them decide if they want it for their kids or not.\" \"That sounds good\" Nikki said. Ryan then started to massage her belly gently like he always did at this time. Nikki liked it and fell Ryan wished she didn't fall asleep so quickly. He enjoyed be able to talk and cuddle with her. But even in the long years that they had been together he had gotten few chances to do so. Ryan just smiled and began to fall asleep himself. Nikki slept all night and she was glad to finally get some rest. Morning came but Ryan woke up first this time. He got up out of bed hoping not to wake up Nikki just yet. Nikki was still sleeping. Ryan got ready for the day and went to make breakfast for everyone himself. Nikki continued to sleep a little longer. Once breakfast was done Ryan decided to wake up Nikki gently. Nikki woke up now. \"Morning\" She said. \"Morning\" Ryan said \"I got breakfast made.\" \"Ok\" Nikki said as she got up and got changed. Ryan had the food set out on the table and went to get the kids as Nikki came back in after changing. \"Thank you for doing this\" Nikki said. \"Hey I should make breakfast every now and then\" Ryan said \"It's no problem.\" \"True\" Nikki said. The kids came in at that point \"So what's the plan for today?\" Ryan asked. \"If Garrett is up for it we will try training again\" Nikki said. \"And I will take a trip back into town alone right?\" Cam asked. \"Yes\" Nikki said. \"Alright then\" Cam said \"I guess you can give me what I need for the clothes and I will be on my way then?\" Cam finished her food now. Nikki handed her the money. \"Be careful\" Nikki said. \"I will be\" Cam said moving on towards town. \"Are you going to train me alone today?\" Garrett asked seeing his sister leave. \"Oh ok\" Garrett said \"Just making sure\" He had finished his food now as well. Nikki had finished as well and went to find her mom. Her mom had been up a few hours and was relaxing in her own room. \"Hey mom\" Nikki said coming into her mom's room. \"Hello\" Her mom said \"Anything wrong?\" \"I was hoping that you would be willing to help me train Garrett\" Nikki said. \"Sure\" Nikki's mom said. \"Thanks mom\" Nikki said. \"Is Cameryn going to be with us?\" Her mom asked. \"She went to town\" Nikki said. \"She did?\" Her mom asked \"I guess she enjoyed it when you guys went there yesterday huh?\" \"Yes she did\" Nikki said \"also Ryan and I were thinking about sending her to school.\" \"To the human school?\" Her mom asked \"You sure about that?\" \"Yes\" Nikki said \"she is wanting to go.\" \"Well if you think everything will work out then sure\" Her mom said \"But what about the others of the family?\" \"We are going to let them decide on whether or not they want to send them\" Nikki said. \"You never went\" Her mom said \"What do you think of Cam going?\" \"I don't mind the idea\" Nikki said \"I want her to be happy and at least be able to have human friends.\" \"That's true\" Her mom said \"I am sorry you were never really able to have that.\" \"Its ok\" Nikki said \"I know dad would have never approved anyway.\" \"That's the only reason you didn't go\" Her mom said \"But shall we move on to train little Garrett then?\" \"Sure thing\" Nikki said \"and thanks again mom.\" \"It's part of what I am here for\" Her mom said smiling and walking with her to where they were going to train Garrett today. The family made it to the site they train at. Cam had made it to town now and made her way back to the clothing store. She had already planned on what outfits to get but she hoped to see some of her new friends while she was here. She was in luck and spotted Jackie and Raven getting some clothes of their own. \"Hey guys\" Cam said. \"Oh hello again Cameryn\" Jackie said \"How is it going?\" \"It's going \" Cam said \"also I will be going to school I think.\" \"You mean ours?\" Jackie asked. \"Yea I hope so\" Cam said. \"That's good to hear\" Raven said \"I guess we will see you there. And I hope your here for more clothes.\" \"Yea\" Cam said. \"We'll help you out then\" Jackie said \"What kind of clothes you thinking of getting, something form fitting and tight or loose and free?\" \"Something that would fit\" Cameryn said \"Probably form fitting.\" \"Sounds good\" Jackie said \"Something like that would look good on you.\" \"I think this is nice\" Cameryn said as she pulled an outfit off the shelf. \"That works\" Jackie said \"Wanna go try it on?\" \"Sure\" Cameryn said as she went to the dressing room to try on the outfit. Cam had come out of the dressing room with the outfit on to see what Jackie and Raven thought of it on her. \"It looks good\" Jackie said \"And much better then that other old school outfit you had before\" Raven added. Cam had went back to the dressing room and changed back to her other outfit. She come out of the dressing room now. She then went to get the other outfits she had looked at before and tried them on. \"Just how many of these are you going to buy?\" Jackie asked \"They have to cost a pretty penny I'm sure.\" \"Just these three\" Cam said \"I have two others at home that I bought yesterday.\" \"So what will you do after you get them?\" Jackie asked. \"Wear them to school or out to the movies or something like that\" Cameryn said \"also has Tracy said anything else about me?\" \"Not that I know of\" Jackie said \"What about you Raven?\" \"Nope\" Raven said \"I bet him and Max are still at the mall though.\" \"I hope so\" Cam said \"I want to tell them the news.\" Cam had paid for the outfits now . \"Lets go to the mall and see\" Cam said as she was leaving. \"Let's go then\" Jackie said as she and Raven followed her. \"I am glad to have friends like you guys\" Cameryn said. \"Yup\" Jackie said \"It was good meeting you\" They made it to the mall now and the boys were there in the food court again. \"Hey Guys\" Cameryn said waving. The two boys waved at her \"Good to see you again\" Max said \"What's up?\" \"Nothing much just shopping and its good to see you two again\" Cameryn said \"also I may be going to school with you guys.\" \"That will be fun\" Max said. Tracy smiled at her. Cam smiled at Tracy. \"Yes it will be\" Cameryn said. \"What are you going to be doing here?\" Max asked. \"Nothing much\" Cameryn said \"just wanted to come see you guys and tell you the news.\" \"Ok then\" Max said \"I bet you want to go off to talk to Tracy again huh?\" \"Yes\" Cam said \"Tracy come please.\" Tracy nodded and came closer to her. \"My mom and dad actually said let med ate you\" Cam said softly to Tracy. \"That's interesting\" Tracy said \"Do you want to?\" \"Sure\" Cameryn said \"are you willing to?\" \"If that is what you want\" Tracy said. \"I would like that\" Cam said. \"Why is that?\" Tracy asked \"I am not all that interesting you know.\" \"I think your handsome\" Cam said. Tracy actually blushed \"What makes you say that?\" He asked. \"I just do\" Cam said \"you may not think yourself handsome but I do.\" \"So what is the plan?\" Tracy asked \"If you want to go out somewhere, when and where?\" \"I am not sure yet\" Cam said. \"You just wanted to make sure it was ok with me first?\" Tracy asked \"Is that it?\" \"Yes\" Cam said. \"We will have to decide what we are going to do for that date but yes I accept\" Tracy said smiling. \"I am glad\" Cam said \"I am sorry but I have to go now.\" \"But where do you have to go?\" Tracy asked \"And why so soon?\" \"I guess I can stay a little longer\" Cam said \"my parents know I am in town.\" \"You live outside of town?\" Tracy asked. \"Yes I do\" Cam said \"so I was going to leave now and get there before nightfall.\" \"Would you like me to walk you home?\" Tracy asked. \"No thanks not yet anyway\" Cam said \"I am sorry.\" Cam had headed for the door and started to leave. \"O....K?\" Tracy was a little hurt but let her go and went back to the group. Cam made her way back home but she had to be thinking about Tracy along the way. She found that night was just about coming in and her mom, grandmother and Garrett were walking back into the caves themselves as she came back. Cam made it to her mom. \"Mom could I talk to you please?\" Cam asked. Garrett and her grandmother had already made it to their rooms now. \"What is it honey?\" Nikki asked. \"What would it be like to have a human come by here?\" Cam asked \"Tracy wanted to walk me home.\" \"I don't know\" Nikki said \"you would have to tell him who you really are and everything.\" \"I know\" Cam said \"Would that be a bad idea you think?\" \"I don't think so\" Nikki said \"look at me and your dad I am a wolf and your dad is human so if he can accept you then that would be good.\" \"But you said dad read about our kind first right?\" Cam asked \"What if Tracy never read anything about us?\" \"Right\" Nikki said \"also if he don't accept you then he is not a true boyfriend.\" \"I know one thing\" Cam said \"I bet he will never say anything about it to anyone else as quiet as he is.\" \"You can tell him\" Nikki said \"and see how he takes it.\" \"And what would be the best way to say it to him?\" Cam asked \"I mean do I come right out and say it?\" \"Get him in a place that is quite and tell him the truth\" Nikki said. \"That is not going to be hard\" Cam said smiling \"He always wants to talk alone anyway.\" \"Once he accepts that then you can bring him home\" Nikki said \"that is if he does.\" \"But I will have to do that tomorrow\" Cam said looking outside \"Its already getting dark.\" \"Ok\" Nikki said \"also if you want I will go with you.\" \"Do you think that that would be best?\" Cam asked. \"Yea I will go with you just in case\" Nikki said \"now lets go get some rest.\" \"Alright then\" Cam said leaving to her room. Nikki had went to her room now. Ryan was actually already in bed when she came in surprising enough . Nikki had switched into her clothes and put on her nightgown and she went to brush her teeth and then she laid down.\"Is everything ok?\" Ryan asked softly. \"Yea Cam just needed a little advice\" Nikki said. \"What about?\" Ryan asked as he wrapped his hand around her again. \"Tracy wanted to bring her home and she wouldn't let him\" Nikki said. \"And what will she do now?\" Ryan asked. \"She is going to tell him the truth\" Nikki said. \"It would be good to get another human in with this family\" Ryan said \"It would show the others that humans are not all so bad.\" \"True\" Nikki said. Ryan began to massage her stomach again now. Nikki was falling asleep. Ryan let her do so though he wished for one night that she fell asleep a little slower. He soon went to sleep himself, burying his face in her hair gently. Nikki was fast asleep now and she hoped nothing would wake her. The night was peaceful for them both and soon morning came again. Nikki was still sleeping. Ryan was starting to wake up but saw that Nikki was still sleeping so he stayed laying down. Nikki was stirring now. \"Is it morning already?\" Nikki asked slightly awake. \"Sadly yes\" Ryan said still awake. \"Ok\" Nikki said as she was getting up. \"I wish we could still lay down though\" Ryan said. \"I know\" Nikki said \"but we can't.\" \"Yes I know\" Ryan said getting up. Nikki got up and went to take a shower to wake herself up. Ryan would need one too, oddly enough to do the same but unless Nikki, randomly said she would want one with him he was just going to splash water in his face as she took hers. Nikki got in the shower now and she washed up. After she finished she dried off and went to get her clothes for the day. Ryan just admired when she walked by to get her clothes as he splashed water in his face to wake him up. Nikki got dressed now. \"Morning\" Nikki said. \"Uh huh\" Ryan said just smiling at her \"Morning to you too.\" Nikki went to get the kids up now. Ryan just shook his head and went to fix some form of breakfast while Nikki went to get the kids. \"Cam are you awake?\" Nikki asked as she made it to Cam's room. Cam had just gotten up \"Yeah\" She called \"I'm up, is breakfast ready?\" \"Not yet\" Nikki said. \"Dad's making it I guess?\" Cam asked. \"Yes he is\" Nikki said \"Now I am going to go get your brother up.\" Nikki had walked to Garrett's room \"Garrett time to get up\" Nikki said. \"Coming\" Garrett called. He was ready, he had woke up a little earlier and he made sure his toys weren't sitting in the middle of the room for someone to step on as he came out to greet his mother. \"Hey mommy\" He said. \"Hey sweetie\" Nikki said \"your up earlier than normal why?\" \"I don't really know.\" Garrett said \"I guess the trip to town wasn't as tiring as hunting and training.\" \"Oh ok\" Nikki said \"did you pick up your toys?\" \"Yup yup\" Garrett said smiling \"I always do.\" \"Ok just making sure\" Nikki said as her and Garrett made it to the kitchen. Ryan had things cooked and ready and smiled when they all walked back into the kitchen. \"Wow it smells delicious in here\" Nikki said. \"Think so?\" Ryan asked \"Just a simple breakfast.\" \"I know so\" Nikki said \"that's the best kind.\" \"You have a point\" Ryan said as everyone started to eat. \"So what's the plan today?\" Ryan asked after a while. \"Training\" Nikki said \"and a hunt.\" \"What about setting up my schooling today?\" Cam asked. \"We can do that too\" Nikki said. \"It would have to be first so that Garrett so can train till night fall\" Ryan said \"Unless you want to train him while I take Cam into town.\" \"We can all go\" Nikki said \"I can train Garrett when we get back.\" \"Even me Garrett asked?\" As he looked up from his food. \"Yes even you\" Nikki said. \"I won't be in the way?\" Garrett asked. \"I don't think so\" Nikki said \"Ryan what do you say?\" \"I wouldn't think so\" Ryan said \"He doesn't have the habit of getting under foot.\" Nikki had finished eating now and she went to the room to get changed. Ryan finished as well and set the dishes in the sink for all of them before he made sure the kids had some good clothes to put on and when back to his and Nikki's room. \"Honey do you think we can maybe go to the mall again?\" Nikki asked. \"Sure\" Ryan said \"What are you thinking of getting?\" \"I just want to look\" Nikki said \"and maybe get another outfit for Cam.\" \"You know there is nothing stopping us from getting stuff for us too you know\" Ryan said smiling. \"I know that but I got what I wanted a ring\" Nikki said \"the only other thing I may need is another nightgown.\" \"Speaking of which do you want to do something special for the vows or just say them together one night as we swap rings?\" Ryan asked. \"We can do something special for our vows\" Nikki said \"but I still haven't gotten them done yet.\" \"Fair enough\" Ryan said \"Take as long as you need to honey. We ready to go?\" \"Yes\" Nikki said. Ryan smiled and walked with her back out of the caves. And the whole family went back to town again. \"Do you want to go to the school first or to the mall?\" Ryan asked. \"The school first\" Nikki said. \"Let's do that then\" Ryan said leading the way \"Though I hope it is still in the same place.\" \"It should be\" Nikki said. \"We can only hope\" Ryan said and in fact it was. \"Looks just like I remember it before I ran off\" Ryan said with a smile. The family had went in now to see if they could get Cam signed up. They had a few difficulities it being her first enrollment in a school but after some much needed dilberation the head of the school said that she could have a day or so to study a paplet and would then have a entrance exam to see what grade she would fall in for her work. \"When will she have to do that?\" Nikki asked. \"After she has a day or two studying the paplet.\" The head of the school \"It's not everyday we have a girl her age come in who was home schooled their whole life.\" \"Ok\" Nikki said. \"Do you think you can do that Cameryn?\" The head master asked Cam. \"I think so\" She answered softly \"This shouldn't be too hard for you\" The head master said. \"Now is there anything else speical that she requires? Medication and things perhaps?\" \"No she doesn't\" Nikki said. \"Alright then\" The head master said \"I think things should work out fine. Welcome Cameryn\" The head master offered her hand and Cam took it to shake her hand. \"Just return in a few days and things should be fine\" The older woman told them all. \"Thank you\" Nikki said. \"Alright then that's done\" Ryan said as they left the school now. \"Be sure to study that Cam\" He said \"I will\" Cam said. \"Cam I will let you study that instead of you helping me with the training\" Nikki said \"I will see if Sammy or mom will do it.\" \"Alright\" Cam said \"What are we doing at the mall?\" \"I wanted to come here\" Nikki said \"and also I was going to see if you wanted another outfit.\" \"I guess so\" Cam said \"That gives me what five?\" \"You should have five now and this would make your sixth one\" Nikki said. \"Six new outfits to go with this day and age\" Cam said \"Sounds good.\" They had made it to the mall now. \"Ok\" Nikki said \"Garrett you and your dad can go where ever while us girls go to the clothes.\" \"Yup yup\" Ryan said playing with Garrett's hair and walking with him to the toys and other things. Nikki and Cam went to the clothing store and Nikki hoped to find her a wedding outfit or at least something special for her to wear when her and Ryan do the vows. Cam saw her looking at the prettier dresses \"What's up mom?\" She asked \"Is something going on?\" \"Ryan and I are going to do vows to show that we are married\" Nikki said. \"Vows?\" Cam asked \"You mean marry like humans do?\" \"Yes Cam\" Nikki said as she went and tried a dress on. When she came back Cam smiled \"It looks great on you mom\" She said softly. \"So you do you think your dad would like it?\" Nikki asked. \"I am sure he will\" Cam said smiling. \"I didn't want to go all out but I like this\" Nikki said as she went back into the dressing room to change into her other outfit so that she could pay for this one. \"I am sure dad isn't going to want to go all out either\" Cam said. \"Do you think it is going overboard getting this dress?\" Nikki asked. \"No\" Cam said \"Dad will like the dress\" then she smiled playfully \"of course he would have to get something dressy too and I don't know how much he would like that.\" \"True\" Nikki said. \"You want me to help him get a suit to match?\" Cam asked \"They are supposed to match right?\" \"Yes they are suppose to match\" Nikki said \"and I think that would be good if you helped him.\" \"Alright then\" Cam said \"Do you want to go get him then?\" \"Not really\" Nikki said \"because I don't want him to know that I bought this.\" \"Then how will he get one that matches?\" Cam asked. \"We can do it\" Nikki said \"but I don't want him to see it until we do the vows also you should remember the colors in it and that is all we really need.\" \"Ok that works\" Cam said \"He's going to love it mom.\" \"I hope so\" Nikki said \"so lets go find your dad.\" \"Ok then\" Cam said. And the girls walked on towards toys to try and friend the other guys. They found them looking at handheld video games. \"Ryan would you go with Cam for a bit please and I will stay with Garrett\" Nikki said. Nikki also whispered to Cam \"remember the colors.\" \"I guess I can\" Ryan said raising an eyebrow \"What are you girls up to?\" \"Nothing\" Nikki said. Ryan followed Cam back to the clothing part of the store \"What's going on?\" Ryan asked. \"Nothing\" Cameryn said. \"Then why did your mom decide to swap kids?\" Ryan asked \"I don't know anything more about clothes in this day and age then she does.\" \"Mom just wants you to have something special\" Cam said. \"Something special?\" Ryan asked \"Like what?\" \"Just trust me on this its something special and I don't want to spoil it\" Cameryn said. \"Alright then\" Ryan followed her to the section of clothes that had men's suits. \"Oh that suit looks perfect\" Cam said as she went over to it. \"Perfect suit?\" Ryan asked \"I see she wants us to dress special for the vows doesn't she?\" \"I won't tell you\" Cam said. \"Well then\" Ryan said holding the suit \"I guess I should go and try it on then.\" \"Yes you should\" Cam said. Ryan did so and soon came back with the suit on. \"Wow dad you look great\" Cam said. \"Think so?\" Ryan asked \"I have not worn a suit like this in a long time.\" \"Yes I do\" Cam said. \"Well let's pay for this and we can head back to your mom\" Ryan said. \"Ok\" Cam said. The two went back to her mother. \"Now why did you go and do that?\" Ryan asked \"You could have just asked about a dress you know.\" \"I wanted it to be a surprise\" Nikki said \"I am sorry.\" \"I'm not complaining\" Ryan said \"Just joking around, I guess you didn't want me to see your dress?\" \"No I didn't but since you know then I guess its ok\" Nikki said. \"Well of course I would know your getting a dress\" Ryan said \"That's obvious but I don't know what it looks like and that's the main thing that counts anyway.\" \"True\" Nikki said \"Lets go home now please.\" \"Of course\" Ryan said walking with the family out of the mall. Nikki was upset a bit that Ryan found out but she didn't mind now. The family made it home and Nikki went to her mom's room. \"Is something wrong?\" Nikki's mom asked as she entered. \"I need your help on making a vow and also I would like you to hide this in your room until the day me and Ryan share our vows and exchange rings\" Nikki said. \"Of course\" Her mother said smiling as she put the dress in her closet still in its bag. \"So what kind of vows we talking here?\" \"Marriage vows\" Nikki said. \"Well I know that\" Her mom said smiling \"What do you want it to say, what do you want the vow to be?\" \"Something short and sweet\" Nikki said \"but I don't really have any ideas on how to start it.\" \"Well what kinds of things would you promise him?\" Her mom asked \"That's all these really are you know.\" \"Ok\" Nikki said \"I promise to love him and care for him forever.\" \"Does that work mom?\" She asked. \"Just change promise to vow and that's pretty much all it takes\" Her mom said smiling \"Are you going to promise him anything else?\" \"I vow to give him my heart body and soul\" Nikki said \"and I vow to love and care for him.\" \"Well you already said the second part\" Her mom said \"What about trusting and understanding him?\" \"That would work\" Nikki said \"I vow to trust and understand him with all my heart.\" \"All right then\" Her mom said looking at the notes carefully \"You have 'I vow to forever love and care for him. I vow to forever trust and understand him. I vow to give him my heart and soul' sound good?\" \"It sounds good to me\" Nikki said \"thanks for your help mom.\" \"Not a problem\" She said \"I hope it goes well for you too.\" \"I want to do it on the Alpha Rock so that the whole family could see it\" Nikki said \"if that is ok?\" \"When are you thinking of doing it?\" She asked. \"Soon\" Nikki said \"In a couple of days maybe.\" \"Just let us all know the night before, at the start of the hunt and I am sure everyone will be happy to watch\" Her mom said. \"Ok\" Nikki said \"I have to clarify with Ryan as when we do it but I will let everyone know.\" \"Sounds like a plan then\" Her mom said smiling. \"I look forward to it, now get back to that loving man of yours.\" \"Ok mom\" Nikki said \"I love you and thanks.\" \"I love you too honey\" She said \"And be sure to love that man of yours just as much.\" \"I will mom\" Nikki said as she left the room now. Ryan was at the desk when she came back into the room. \"Hey honey\" Nikki said. Ryan looked up from the desk and smiled at her \"Hello\" He said simply. \"Honey when are we wanting to do the vows?\" Nikki asked \"because I want to let mom and everyone know also I want to do it on Alpha Rock.\" \"Maybe the day after tomorrow?\" Ryan offered \"That way I can get mine done and we can make sure that Cam gets in the school ok.\" \"Ok\" Nikki said \"what do you think of doing it on Alpha Rock?\" \"Fine by me\" Ryan said softly putting his paper back in the drawer and moving to change into his night clothes. Nikki had changed into her night clothes now. \"So we ready to lay down huh?\" Ryan asked looking at Nikki. \"Yes we are\" Nikki said. Ryan smiled and walked with her towards the bed. Nikki made it to the bed and laid down now. \"I love you sweetie\" Nikki said. \"I know you do\" Ryan said laying next to her. \"And I love you too.\" Nikki was laying down now and she was glad to have someone to truly love her for her. Nikki wasn't sure now on what to talk about. \"You look like you got something on your mind.\" Ryan said \"Everything ok?\" \"I just don't know what to talk about now\" Nikki said. \"Why do you want to talk?\" Ryan asked. \"I just would think it was too quite\" Nikki said \"and you usually want to do something before we fall asleep.\" \"I do that's true\" Ryan said softly \"But you usually don't.\" \"I know but for some reason I just can't go to sleep right now\" Nikki said. \"Well it would relax you\" Ryan said \"I could pleasure you a little if you like.\" \"That would be good\" Nikki said. Ryan just smiled and massaged her belly a little bit seeing if that was all she would really need. Nikki was relaxing now but it wasn't enough. \"I love you\" Ryan said and started to move up to her breasts gently. \"I love you too\" Nikki said as she was relaxing more now. The two spent the night loving on each other and relaxing and the days seemed to fly by as Cam made it into the college, got closer to Tracy, and Garrett even got full control. Ryan and Nikki said their vows and were offically married. Before long Cam was wanting to really tell Tracy who and what she was. She met him on a bench after class to speak to him. \"What do you need?\" He asked softly as always. \"I need to tell you something but you can't tell anyone else\" Cam said \"Do you believe in werewolves?\" \"Werewolves?\" Tracy asked \"Sure, they make good monster movies.\" \"Do you believe they exists?\" Cam asked. \"I guess they could\" Tracy said \"Though I don't think any of the legends about them are real. The whole wolf curse turning into a half wolf by moonlight. That never set well with me.\" \"I will show you something but you can't say anything to anyone\" Cam said as she began to shift. \"Woah now what the heck?\" Tracy started though it was a yell it wasn't loud. Tracy was a little scared but something told him that this was still Cam. He waited. Cam had switched back to her human form now. \"Tracy I am a werewolf\" Cam said \"but you can't say anything to anyone promise me that.\" \"Trust me I won't\" Tracy said \"Who would believe me?\" \"Probably no one\" Cam said \"and thanks for keeping this a secret.\" \"Is everyone in your family like this?\" Tracy asked softly. \"Yes they are\" Cam said. \"How did you all become like this?\" Tracy asked \"And please don't tell me it was like some curse put on your family or something.\" \"We are all born like this\" Cam said. \"So you are another race then right?\" Tracy asked \"How does your kind feel about humans?\" \"They like humans\" Cam said \"my dad Ryan is human and everyone loves him.\" \"I thought you said everyone in your family was the creature you are?\" Tracy asked \"And if your dad is human wouldn't that make you half?\" \"Ryan is my step dad\" Cam said \"my real dad was a werewolf so I am full werewolf but my brother Garrett is half.\" \"I guess your telling me all this means that we are finally ready for me to meet your family?\" Tracy asked. \"Yes\" Cam said as she was leading him to the family. \"I really do care about you\" Tracy said \"I am glad you trust me enough to do this.\" \"I care about you too\" Cam said as they made it to the cave. \"You live in caves?\" Tracy asked \"I guess that makes sense.\" \"This is my family's cave\" Cam said as she walked inside with Tracy. \"Hi there\" Ryan said waving to the boy \"Your mother is watching over Garrett right now is this him?\" \"Yes it is\" Cam said \"Ryan this is Tracy and Tracy this is my dad Ryan.\" Tracy was quiet now but he offered his hand. Ryan took it and shook it. \"I see that you are shy as my daughter said. Tracy nodded. Nikki was still with Garrett. \"Have you two gotten close?\" Ryan asked Tracy but looked towards Cam for the answer. \"Close as in what?\" Cam asked not sure what he meant. \"I want to make sure that you really do care about him\" Ryan said smiling \"And if you do does he know what you are?\" \"Yes dad he knows\" Cam said. \"And what does he seem to think of that?\" Ryan asked \"Does it interest or scare him?\" \"I think it scared him a bit but I think he is used to it\" Cam said. Tracy nodded \"That's good to know\" Ryan said. \"Your mother should be in soon.\" Nikki had come in as they were talking. \"Hey mom\" Cam called \"This is Tracy.\" \"Hey Tracy its nice to meet you\" Nikki said. Tracy smiled and nodded. Nikki shook his hand now. \"Did everything go ok with Garrett?\" Ryan asked. \"Yes it did\" Nikki said. \"So what are we going to do now?\" Ryan asked. \"I don't know\" Nikki said as she went to her's and Ryan's room. \"Cam if you want to you can take Tracy to your room for a while but I will come and check on you and he would have to leave after a time\" Ryan said to Cam as Nikki walked on into their room and Garrett went to his. \"Ok\" Cam said as her and Tracy went to her room. Nikki was getting dressed now for the hunt. \"So you are going on a hunt tonight then?\" Ryan asked. \"Yes I am\" Nikki said. \"Do you think Cam should?\" Ryan asked \"With her spending time with Tracy.\" \"Nah she can stay here since she has Tracy over here\" Nikki said. \"What did you think of him?\" Ryan asked. \"I like him\" Nikki said \"what do you think?\" \"Well he sure seems capable of keeping a secret.\" Ryan said \"He didn't even talk to me.\" \"Cam said that he was shy\" Nikki said \"he may just talk to her until he gets used to us.\" \"Of course\" Ryan said \"So you ready now?\" \"Yes I am ready\" Nikki said as she was heading out. Ryan just watched her for a moment and let her go. Nikki passed Garrett's room and he came out to her. \"I'm ready\" He said happily. \"Ok\" Nikki said \"lets go.\" \"What about sissy?\" Garrett asked. \"She has company here so I won't bother her\" Nikki said. \"Oh\" Garrett said \"Ok then\" The two then go off on the hunt. Nikki smells prey close. Nikki had caught the prey now. Cam was in her room now with Tracy. \"Have you ever read any books on werewolves?\" Cam asked. \"A little bit\" Tracy said softly \"Your parents seemed nice.\" \"They are real sweet\" Cam said. \"Do you have any of the books that would teach me about your kind?\" Tracy asked. \"My dad might\" Cam said \"but I don't have any.\" \"Do you think it would be ok to ask him for some?\" Tracy asked. \"I don't think it would hurt\" Cam said. \"Would you rather me be the one to ask him?\" Tracy asked \"I could do that right quick and then come back. Or we can wait and ask him before I leave.\" \"We can ask before you leave\" Cam said. \"So what should we do now?\" Tracy asked \"What do we have interesting in your room?\" \"Nothing really\" Cam said \"if you like we can go for a walk.\" \"That sounds like fun\" Tracy said. \"Dad\" Cam called. Ryan came to her room \"Yes?\" He asked. \"Tracy and I are going to go for a walk\" Cam said \"also do you have your books on werewolves?\" \"I do and you can just be careful out there\" Ryan said walking with them as they started to leave and handing her the book. \"We will\" Cam said \"I think we are going to head to the park.\" \"Remember your mom and everyone else is out there too\" Ryan said. The two then left. \"What are your other family members doing?\" Tracy asked. \"My family goes on hunts\" Cam said \"its how we get our food sometimes.\" \"Hunts?\" Tracy questioned \"As wolves?\" \"Yes but we only hunt animals now not humans\" Cam said. \"That's good to know\" Tracy said. \"We are glad that it is this way\" Cam said. \"Really?\" Tracy asked. \"Yes\" Cam said. \"So what does the book say\" Tracy asked. \"It mostly tells about the legends\" Cam said \"if you like you can read it.\" \"Could I take it home?\" Tracy asked. \"I don't know about that now\" Cam said. \"We could ask when we get back maybe?\" Tracy offered. \"Sure\" Cam said. Nikki and Garrett had come back from the hunt now. \"Do you want to head back in?\" Tracy asked \"We have walked around for a while.\" \"Sure\" Cam said. They walked back home afterwards. And found everyone home \"I guess I should head home too\" Tracy said softly. \"I thought you wanted to ask my dad if you could take the book with you?\" Cam asked. \"Oh right\" Tracy said as they came closer to the room \"Would you ask?\" \"Ok\" Cam said \"daddy.\" \"Hmm?\" Ryan asked turning to her. \"Tracy wants to know if he can take the book with him \" Cam said. \"As long as he keeps it safe\" Ryan said Tracy nodded and bowed to Cam before starting to leave the cave. Cam followed him out. \"Bye Tracy\" Cam said \"see you tomorrow.\" \"Alright then\" Tracy said walking away. Ryan had walked to watch him go. \"He's a good boy\" He said softly. \"Do you think he is a keeper?\" Cam asked. Ryan smiled at the choice of words \"Sure\" Ryan said \"If you like him.\" \"I do like him\" Cam said \"and I hope that he will stay with me.\" \"Well at least that book will help him learn about us\" Ryan said. \"It is a good thing\" Cam said \"I am glad that you had the book.\" \"Well you should get to bed now then honey\" Ryan said playing with her hair as he walked back to his own room where Nikki was. \"Night\" Cam said as she went to her room. \"Night honey\" Ryan said walking back in to the room Nikki was in. Nikki was laying down now. Ryan saw her on the bed and walked over to climb in next to her. \"Hey sweetie\" Nikki said looking up from her book. \"What are you reading?\" Ryan asked. \"A romance novel\" Nikki said. \"Really?\" Ryan asked \"What made you want to read that?\" \"Yea\" Nikki said \"I was just in the mood to read something different.\" \"That's good\" Ryan said \"I love you\" and he laid down on his side next to her to let her read in peace. He didn't think he would go to sleep quickly but he didn't care he could feel her warm legs behind him. \"I love you too\" Nikki said as she finished the chapter she was on. Ryan didn't know when she would stop reading but he wasn't going to bother her tonight though he wasn't that tired at them moment. Nikki finished reading and she laid down now. Once he was sure that she was done with the book Ryan turned back around and put his arm around her. \"So did you like the book?\" He asked softly wanting to make small coversation for a bit before they went to sleep. \"Yes the book is real good\" Nikki said. \"Ok A romance between heroes perhaps?\" He asked \"Or starcrossed lovers?\" \"Starcrossed Lovers\" Nikki said. \"Those are always the best\" Ryan said smiling as he smelled her hair around his face. \"I love you sweetie\" Nikki said. \"I love you too\" Ryan said wrapping his arm around her like always did. Nikki was falling asleep. Ryan placed his hand on hers and was just going to let her sleep even though he didn't know when he himself would go to sleep. He knew that he would be able to watch her for a few moments before falling asleep and that would be ok with him. Nikki was fast asleep now. Ryan just let her sleep and eventually he was able to fall asleep beside her like always did. Morning soon came and Nikki found that he was still asleep. Nikki didn't move because she wanted to be near him. If she were to turn around at this point Nikki would find that Ryan was postioned really close to her as always. His face still buried in her hair and arm on her hand and on her belly. Nikki had laid wide awake now. Ryan started to massage her belly again in his sleep. He seemed to love the touch of her skin against his own. Nikki loved this and so she moaned a bit. Ryan stopped moving his hand but still rested beside her. \"I love you\" Nikki said as she laid there. Ryan woke up now \"Hmm?\" Ryan asked. \"I said I love you\" Nikki said as they were laying there. \"I love you too\" Ryan said softly \"How long have you been awake?\" \"Not long\" Nikki said. \"What did you do all that time your still in the same place you fell asleep?\" Ryan asked. \"I just laid here because I didn't want to move\" Nikki said. \"You were comfy huh?\" Ryan asked. \"Yea\" Nikki said. \"And are you still comfy?\" Ryan asked. \"Yes I am comfy\" Nikki said. \"What made you want to read that book last night?\" Ryan asked \"You don't really worry about things like that.\" \"I know that but I was just wanting to read\" Nikki said \"and that was the first book I grabbed.\" \"So you had no special reason to read it then?\" Ryan asked. \"Not really\" Nikki said \"I just wanted something to read.\" \"Shall we make breakfast then?\" Ryan asked. \"That would be good\" Nikki said \"I am hungry.\" \"Alright\" Ryan said getting up \"Lead the way.\" Nikki got up and she led the way to the kitchen so that the two of them could make breakfast. Ryan followed and waited for her to start breakfast. Nikki got everything ready for breakfast and she started cooking. Ryan then went to get the kids for breakfast. Nikki had plated the food now and she waited for the family to come in and eat. Ryan was soon back with the kids. Nikki went to sit down now. The kids began to eat as Ryan took his seat next to Nikki. Nikki started eating now. Ryan was eating as well and as they were eating Sammy walked in. \"Hey Sammy\" Nikki said. \"How are things going?\" Sammy asked. \"Things are going real well\" Nikki said \"How is everything going with you?\" \"I am doing fine\" Sammy said \"I saw that little Cam had a friend over yesterday?\" Sammy looked to Cam who nodded. \"Yea\" Nikki said \"he was nice but shy.\" \"So you are starting to let humans into the caves?\" Sammy asked. \"Yes and he is also dating Cam\" Nikki said \"what is wrong with humans anyway?\" \"Ok and I am sorry\" Nikki said \"It just seemed like you didn't like humans?\" \"You say that like a question?\" Sammy asked \"At any rate I wanted to ask you guys from the pack if they could do the same thing. They see Cam going to school and hanging out with the boy and want to go as well.\" \"I think that would be a good idea\" Nikki said \"Ryan what do you say?\" \"Sure\" Ryan said \"If that is what they want to do\" \"Alright then\" Sammy said \"I will let them know\" Sammy then got ready to leave. \"I should get ready to head to school\" Cam said smiling. \"Cam I put your lunch money in your room\" Nikki said. \"Alright thanks mom\" Cam said moving to her room. \"No problem\" Nikki said as she finished eating. Cam then left. \"What are we going to do today mommy?\" Garrett asked. \"Not really sure\" Nikki said. \"Can I just play outside for now then?\" Garrett asked. \"Sure\" Nikki said as she put the plates in the sink. \"I guess we just spend time at home huh?\" Ryan asked. \"That is a good idea\" Nikki said. \"What would we even do?\" Ryan asked. \"I don't know\" Nikki said \"I guess we watch over our son and just rest for today.\" \"Sounds good to me\" Ryan said. Nikki and her family rested for the day. Soon the night came and Ryan thought they might go on the hunt. \"You plan on hunting tonight?\" He asked. \"Nah\" Nikki said. \"So what will we do before we sleep instead?\" Ryan asked \"I know Garrett is still playing with his toys in his room and Cam is doing homework.\" \"Just rest\" Nikki said. \"Alright then\" Ryan said going ahead and laying on their bed waiting for her or to see what she would do. Nikki had changed clothes and laid down on the bed and read some more of her book. Ryan just lay behind her, not reading over her shoulder, just enjoying his time with her. Nikki continued to read. Ryan just watched her for a moment his arm gently wrapped around her. \"I love you\" Nikki said as she was still reading. Ryan smiled and started to gently rub her belly as he whispered \"I love you too\" into her ear. Nikki finished the chapter she was on and she put the book on her night stand and laid down. \"So you learning anything about how we humans show love?\" Ryan asked teasingly. \"Maybe\" Nikki said teasingly \"What do you think?\" \"I would hope so but I can't be too sure\" Ryan said playing with her belly. \"Yes it is helping me a lot\" Nikki said. \"We will just have to see how lovable you are when you get further into it\" Ryan said letting his hand rest on her belly and his face bury into her hair like he always did. \"Yea we will see\" Nikki said. Nikki could feel his breath growing soft on the back of her neck as he relaxed. Nikki was relaxing now. \"We got to do something interesting or I am going to fall asleep and with it being early and the kids not asleep I don't want to do that\" Ryan said chuckling a little. \"Like what?\" Nikki asked. \"Could always tickle you\" Ryan said playfully putting his hands close to her sides again. \"Ok\" Nikki said \"you can tickle me.\" Ryan just looked at her. \"You don't want me to tickle you\" He said softly \"You just don't know what else to say, too bad you can't show me something you learned from that book.\" \"I don't mind you tickling me\" Nikki said. Nikki turned to face Ryan and she started massaging his lower. \"Hey now...\" Ryan said a little started by the sudden action down there \"What's up with that?\" \"That is one thing I have learned from the book\" Nikki said as she stopped with it. The night went on like that. The two of them teasing and playing with each other. Soon everyone around the family's caves seemed to be asleep. Morning came and Nikki woke up first again. Nikki woke up and she went to take a shower now. Ryan still slept as she showered. He seemed to want to rest for most of the morning. Nikki had finished showering and she went into and changed into her clothes now. She thought about waking Ryan up but then decide she should check on the kids and make breakfast first. He seemed too peaceful. She found Cam just about ready to get up and choosing her clothes but Garrett wasn't in his room. \"Garrett\" Nikki called. She called for his name on the outside of the caves but there was still no answer. Ryan was waking up now and came out to join her. \"What's going on?\" He asked. \"Garrett is missing\" Nikki said. \"I will ask around\" Ryan said \"You go see Sammy and see if you can't go out and look for him\" Cam came out \"I want to help too\" She said \"No\" Ryan said \"You stay here\" \"But...\" \"Stay here.\" \"Ok\" Nikki said as she went to look for Sammy. \"Sammy\" Nikki called. \"Yeah I am here\" Sammy said \"Something wrong?\" \"Garrett is missing\" Nikki said \"have you seen him?\" \"No I haven't\" Sammy said \"Do you want to go wolf and look around the woods?\" \"Lets go\" Nikki said as she shifted to wolf form. Sammy followed her and the two went looking for Garrett. When Nikki sniffed around she caught what could have been his scent and followed it. Before long she found him, his clothes in shreds and laying against a rock near the river. Nikki shifted back. \"Garrett are you ok?\" Nikki asked. \"I think I will be\" Garrett said softly \"Mom take me home\" Sammy was still in wolf form and came next to him willing to carry him so that he could speak with his mom as they went back. \"Ok\" Nikki said as she lifted him up and laid him on Sammy. \"What happened?\" She asked. \"I don't know\" Garrett said \"I was playing with the others of the pack and I got lost I think.\" Garrett grabbed his head in pain. \"When we get home I want you to rest please\" Nikki said. Garrett didn't say anything he simply nodded and waited to be home. Soon he was in his room and Sammy shifted back. \"Thanks for your help Sammy\" Nikki said. Sammy smiled and patted the small boy on the head. \"Of course\" He said \"I am just glad he's safe.\" \"So am I\" Nikki said \"also if you ever need any help just ask.\" \"Will do\" Sammy said leaving as Cam and Ryan came into the room \"Is he alright?\" Cam asked. \"He should be\" Nikki said. \"Do we know what happened?\" Ryan asked. \"All I know is he told me that he was playing with the others and got lost\" Nikki said. \"Well let's let him rest for the day\" Ryan said \"Cam you better get going you'll be late\" \"Right\" Cam said moving to her room. \"We will\" Nikki said. Cam was soon dressed and heading for school again. She barely made it in time for the bell for her first class. Cam sat down next in her first class and listened to the lecture before the bell rang for the first break. She met Jackie and Raven in the hall. \"How are things for you this morning?\" Jackie asked. \"It was ok\" Cam said \"my little brother had disappeared this morning.\" \"And that's ok?\" Raven asked worried \"How did you find him so easily?\" \"My mom and cousin found him\" Cam said. \"He must have not gotten very far\" Raven said \"Are you ready for our cooking class?\" \"Yea I am\" Cam said. \"I wonder what we will cook today\" Jackie said following them to the class. The teacher hadn't came in yet. \"Who knows\" Cam said. The day went on and soon it was about time for the last classes. This was when Cam would see Tracy. Cam loved this class. Tracy smiled at her as the class went on and soon it was time to chose to lab partners. Cam chose Tracy for her lab partner. Tracy smiled and they worked together on the project. Cam smiled too. \"So have you read the book?\" Cam asked quitely. \"A little bit of it\" He answered his voice soft as always. \"Ok\" Cam said softly. \"Does your dad want it back?\" He asked. \"No\" Cam said \"I was just asking if you had read it.\" \"Oh ok\" Tracy said \"What do you got planned later today?\" \"Not sure yet\" Cam said. \"Do you want to do something with me?\" Tracy asked as they finished up the project. \"Sure\" Cam said. \"Let's go and hang out at the mall\" Tracy said. \"Sure that would great\" Cam said. \"This is your last class too right?\" Tracy asked. \"Yes it is\" Cam said. \"You follow me out then?\" Tracy asked as the bell rang. Cam followed Tracy out of the door. The two walked on to the mall. \"Where do you want to go first?\" Tracy asked \"Clothing store or what?\" \"Food Court\" Cam said. \"Your hungry huh?\" Tracy asked smiling. \"Yes I am\" Cam said. \"So what do you want to eat?\" Tracy asked. \"Pizza\" Cam said. \"What sort of toppings?\" Tracy asked smiling. \"Pepperoni and Cheese\" Cam said. \"Sounds good to me\" Tracy said going to the pizza part of the food court to order it. Cam was sitting at the table now alone. Once the order was made Tracy came back to her. \"So things going ok at home?\" He asked. \"Yea everything is going good\" Cam said. \"I think we are getting pretty close don't you?\" Tracy asked softly. \"Yes we are\" Cam said. \"I really care about you\" Tracy said \"I just don't know how well the family pack will like me.\" \"They will\" Cam said \"I know it.\" \"What makes you seem so sure?\" Tracy asked. \"Because they are starting to trust humans\" Cam said \"look at Ryan and my mom.\" \"How large is your family anyway?\" Tracy asked \"I saw lots of people around those caves are they all your family in some way and wolves?\" \"Everyone you saw is my family yes\" Cam said \"they are all wolves.\" \"That is a lot of people\" Tracy said softly. \"Yes it is\" Cam said. \"And your sure that they all will accept me?\" Tracy asked \"I'm not all that special, you don't even know much about me.\" \"I hope so\" Cam said \"also tell me a little about your self please.\" \"There isn't much to tell\" Tracy said \"I was always shy, I am surprised I have the friends that I do.\" \"How did you meet Jackie and all of them?\" Cam asked. \"That was through Raven\" Tracy said \"She was the first one that talked to me, I guess she found me as mysterious as she was in middle school. \"That is cool\" Cam said. \"Her friends grew and I met them through her\" Tracy said \"As shy as I was I didn't say much until I was alone with them.\" \"Oh\" Cam said \"so is that why you only talk to me?\" \"Right\" Tracy said \"I don't know why I do that but I just can't speak loudly around many people.\" \"Its ok\" Cam said \"I am just glad to have someone to talk to.\" \"So what do we do now?\" Tracy asked \"We are done eating.\" \"I guess look around the mall now and then I have to head home\" Cam said. \"Sounds like a plan\" Tracy said \"I bet you don't have money do you?\" \"No but I can look\" Cam said \"if nothing else if I see something I like I can tell my parents.\" \"True enough\" Tracy said walking with her through the halls looking at the stores. They saw everything from clothing to gaming stores \"Which should we check out\" Tracy asked \"I don't have any money and no easy way to get it either.\" \"I am not sure\" Cam said \"There are too many shops.\" \"Let's go to a clothing store first\" Tracy said \"That's the easiest to find stuff in.\" \"Ok\" Cam said as she followed Tracy. Tracy walked into the clothing store and decided to look at the girls clothes with Cam first to see if she liked anything. Cam found a few dresses she liked and a few outfits. Tracy just watched her pick through them. He liked them all and he liked her. \"Alright\" Tracy said smiling a bit as they left. \"Do you want to go on home?\" \"Yea\" Cam said \"it would be best.\" \"Can I follow or do you want to go alone?\" Tracy asked. \"You can come with me\" Cam said. \"Alright\" Tracy said following her to the caves again. Cam and Tracy walked to the caves now. They soon made it to Cam's home and found Garrett outside playing \"Is that the little brother?\" Tracy asked. \"Yes\" Cam said. \"He's sweet looking\" Tracy said \"What's his name?\" \"Garrett\" Cam said \"and he is sweet.\" \"He's the half wolf right?\" Tracy asked. \"Yes\" Cam said \"would you like to say hey to him?\" \"Sure\" Tracy said walking with her towards her brother. \"Garrett come here please\" Cam said. Garrett walked over to them \"What's up sis?\" He asked her. \"Garrett I would like you to meet Tracy\" Cam said \"he is a friend of mine from school.\" \"Hello\" Garrett said \"Hi\" Was all Tracy said \"He's human like daddy right?\" Garrett asked. \"Yes he is\" Cam said. Tracy smiled at the little boy. \"He seems nice\" Garrett said happily. \"He is nice\" Cam said. \"Let's let him play\" Tracy said walking towards Cam's room. \"Sure\" Cam said as they walked in her room. Tracy smiled when they walked in. \"Even though this is a cave it feels like a human home\" He said \"I guess your dad helped with that?\" \"Yes\" Cam said. \"I won't stay that long just wanted to come in and relax a bit before the walk home.\" Tracy said \"I will finish that book as soon as I can.\" \"Ok\" Cam said. \"Do you want me to go ahead and leave now or do you have something else to talk about?\" Tracy asked. \"How do you like the book so far?\" Cam asked. \"Its interesting and surprising\" Tracy said smiling, \"I would have never thought a form of wolf people could have existed but here you are.\" \"I am glad you like it\" Cam said. \"I guess I should head home now\" Tracy said getting up. He was tempted to ask for a hug or say he really, really liked her but he didn't know how she would take it. \"Bye\" Cam said \"I guess I will see you tomorrow in school.\" Cam wanted to hug him but she wasn't sure if she should. Tracy's hands were in a position where they could hug if one of them moved closer but Tracy was moving away instead. Cam went closer to him and hugged him. Tracy was a little surprised by the hug but smiled and hugged her back. \"Thank you\" He said very softly. \"No problem\" Cam said \"I love you.\" Tracy was a little surprised to hear that but smiled \"I love you too\" He said. \"You are a very sweet and lovable guy\" Cam said. \"Even though I am shy and don't talk around many people?\" Tracy asked softly. \"Yes\" Cam said. \"I will see you at school tomorrow\" Tracy said still softly as he started to leave. \"See you tomorrow\" Cam said as she went and started on her homework. Ryan watched Tracy as he left and noticed how much longer he and stayed with Cam this time. He walked back into his room to Nikki \"I think they are getting closer\" He said with a smile. \"That is a good thing\" Nikki said \"she likes him and he likes her.\" \"You wanting to go hunting tonight?\" Ryan asked. \"Yea\" Nikki said. \"Well its just about to be that time\" Ryan said with a smile tossing her her hunting attire. \"Better get ready.\" \"Thanks honey\" Nikki said as she changed into her hunting attire. \"I love your look in that\" Ryan said \"Have fun.\" \"I will\" Nikki said \"Garrett you coming?\" \"Yup\" Garrett said coming out to them. Nikki and Garrett went outside the cave now. \"Is everyone ready?\" Nikki asked. Most of the family seemed ready and willing to go. Nikki noticed that a lot of the younger members of the family had backpacks now, and uniforms for Cam's school. Nikki and Garrett took off first. A few minutes into the hunt Nikki shifted now. Garrett was able to shift as well and soon they picked up the trail of what seemed to be a strong buck. The two of them took off after the buck now. They soon caught up to it and were able to bring it down. The two of them dragged the buck back to the cave now. Everyone else finished up their own hunts as well and Ryan was waiting for Nikki and Garrett when they came back into the room with the buck. Nikki shifted back now. \"I see that you got a big one there\" Ryan said smiling. \"Yes we did\" Nikki said. \"It will feed us for a while\" Garrett said shifting back now and moving to his room. Nikki nodded. After a while she was taking the meat out and she started making patties out of it. Ryan just smiled \"Looks good already\" he said. \"Thank you\" Nikki said. \"Is that dinner for tomorrow or what?\" Ryan asked smiling. \"Actually its for tonight\" Nikki said as she started frying the burgers. \"That works\" Ryan said \"Either way.\" Nikki continued to cook the patties and once they were done she placed them on buns and then on the plates. Ryan got up and went to the kids to tell them that the meal was ready and soon returned with them to start eating. Nikki started eating as well. \"Cam how would you and Garrett like to go and get the berries?\" Nikki asked. \"Sure\" Cam said \"For desert I guess?\" \"Yes\" Nikki said \"my special pie that you both like.\" \"That sounds good\" Garrett said smiling. \"I am glad\" Nikki said \"because that is what will be for dessert.\" \"Let's go\" Cam said and the two kids left to go pick the berries. \"At least things seem peaceful around here\" Ryan said after they left and as Nikki got things set for the pie. \"Yes it is peaceful\" Nikki said. \"You know I like that pie too\" Ryan said \"Did your mom show it to you?\" \"Yes she did\" Nikki said \"she was always the cook when I was younger.\" The kids eventually came back in with the berries. \"Here you go\" Garrett said smiling. \"Thank you\" Nikki said as she started getting everything ready. Soon the pie was done and the family all ate it as a group. \"Now then you get what work you have left done\" Ryan told Cam. \"Then it's lights out.\" Cam nodded and the kids went on out of the kitchen towards their rooms. Nikki was cleaning up now. Ryan helped her by doing the dishes to speed things up. \"Thanks\" Nikki said as they finished. Nikki then took a piece of the pie to her mom. While she did that Ryan went to their room and made sure that things were set on the bed for them to sleep that night. He was just finishing up when she walked back in and getting his clothes together for a shower. He smiled at her when she came back in time to catch him getting them. \"I love you\" Nikki said as she switched into her night clothes. Ryan smiled at her as she changed, \"I guess I will see you in bed when I get out\" He said a little sad \"Your already changed and everything.\" \"I am sorry honey but I needed to get out of the dress\" Nikki said. \"You could always take it off and take one with me anyway\" He said \"Its up to you.\" \"I guess I can\" Nikki said as she took off her night gown and followed him into the shower. Ryan just smiled and made sure the water was good for them both before climbing in after her. \"You go first\" Ryan said softly as he started to help lather up the soap on her hair and back. Nikki was glad to have time with him. Once that was done Ryan let her run the water down her body to rinse it off. Smiling at how her hair sparkled under the water. Nikki finished rinsing the soap off now and she climbed out and dried off. Ryan just let her do so has he lathered himself up and rinsed it off and came out to stand beside her. She finished drying off and she went into the bedroom to get into her night gowns. Ryan was soon done drying off and went back in the room to meet her. Nikki was laying down on the bed reading now. Ryan sneaked up behind her and tickled her from behind as she was reading. Being sure she didn't lose her place. \"Hey now that wasn't fair\" Nikki said laughing about it. She put her bookmark in the place she was at now. \"Why did you do that?\" \"Just wanted to.\" Ryan said smiling playfully. \"You were too cute to pass up.\" \"Ok\" Nikki said as he tired to get him back. Ryan quickly moved out of the way and smiled at her. \"Nope\" He said \"I am too quick for that.\" \"I am going to get you\" Nikki said. \"No you won't\" Ryan said \"Not unless you slow me down somehow.\" \"Or I speed up\" Nikki said as she tried to get him again. Ryan smiled but wasn't able to get out of the way the second time. He laughed as she tickled him. \"I stand corrected\" He said smiling still. \"Or sit as it were.\" Nikki was laughing as she was tickling him. Ryan smiled \"I love you\" He said smiling. \"I love you too\" Nikki said. Ryan smiled and kissed her on the lips softly to surprise her. Nikki kissed him. Ryan smiled against the kiss and hugged her tightly. \"Let's get some sleep honey\" He said softly. \"Ok\" Nikki said as she got up. Ryan laid next to her to get some sleep smiling as he put one hand on hers while he put the other on her belly. Nikki was laying down now. Ryan just waited for her to fall asleep as he smelt her hair softly. The shampoo from their shower smelling good in it. Nikki did fall asleep now. Ryan just smiled and let her sleep as he started to fall asleep himself. The morning came and Nikki was up first. Nikki then went into the kitchen to make breakfast and she made some berry pancakes. Ryan woke up soon after and followed to help her. Nikki was cutting the berries when Ryan came in. \"You want me to get the batter set up for you to put the berries in?\" Ryan asked. \"Sure\" Nikki said as she was still cutting the berries. Ryan did so as the kids came in smelling the food. \"Do I smell berries?\" Garrett asked. \"Yes you do\" Nikki said \"I am trying something different.\" \"Different?\" Cam asked \"Different how?\" \"Berry pancakes\" Nikki said. \"Interesting\" Cam said \"Should be pretty good.\" \"I hope so\" Nikki said as she was finished with the berries. Ryan also had the batter ready for the berries and brought to the side so Nikki could place as many berries as she wanted into it. Nikki put all the berries she cut into the batter and she started pouring it into the frying pan. \"Smells good already\" Ryan said \"Where did this idea come from anyway hon?\" \"From making the pie last night\" Nikki said \"and plus I had extra berries.\" \"Makes sense\" Ryan said smiling. Soon the pancakes were done and the smell of the berries traveled around the whole home. Nikki plated the pancakes now. The whole family ate the pancakes for breakfast. And soon Cam was heading out to school while Garrett went out to play. Nikki finished eating now. Ryan was also done. \"So what do you plan on doing today?\" He asked \"Relaxing again or going to see your mom or Sammy?\" \"Just relaxing\" Nikki said \"and maybe going to see my mom.\" \"I am here if you need some way to relax\" Ryan said with a smile \"And remember I have my movies too.\" \"I remember\" Nikki said \"I am going to take mom some pancakes.\" \"Alright\" Ryan said \"I bet she will like them.\" \"I hope so\" Nikki said as she took the pancakes to her mom. She found her mom rocking in the chair that they had got for her a few years \"What do you have for me now?\" Her mom asked as she looked up from the book she was reading. \"Some berry pancakes\" Nikki said. \"Sounds good\" Her mom said \"Are things going ok?\" \"Yea\" Nikki said \"its fine.\" \"Is Cam having fun in the school?\" Her mom asked. \"I am guessing so\" Nikki said \"she don't really talk about school and I guess its because we never ask her.\" \"What about that one friend she has?\" Her mom asked. \"Tracy\" Nikki said \"he is sweet but shy.\" \"Shy?\" Her mom asked \"Shy how?\" \"Shy as in he don't want to talk to a lot of people\" Nikki said. \"Is Cam trying to change that?\" Her mom asked. \"I think so\" Nikki said. \"Make sure she is\" Her mom said smiling teasingly \"If the boy is to become the next leader when Cam is female he will have to be less shy, at least around us.\" \"I will be sure to tell her\" Nikki said. \"Thank you for the pancakes my sweet daughter\" Her mom said \"And look after that boy.\" \"Your welcome\" Nikki said \"and I will.\" When Nikki left her mom's cave she ran into Sammy \"Oh hi\" He said softly \"How are you?\" \"Hi\" Nikki said \"I am fine how are you.\" \"I am doing good\" Sammy said \"I was wondering if I could spend some time with little Garrett today, I want to show the boy some moves.\" \"Sure just be careful\" Nikki said. \"Of course\" Sammy said \"I always am\" Sammy smiled and then followed her to her house to see Garrett who was playing with a ball in the front part of the cave. \"What's going on?\" He asked when his mom and Sammy walked up. \"Sammy wants to hang out with you\" Nikki said \"he said he wants to show you some moves.\" \"Sounds like fun cousin Sammy\" Garrett said \"Where are we going?\" \"Just follow me bud\" Sammy said \"I will show you.\" The two walked off. Nikki walked into the cave now. \"Where's Garrett off to?\" Ryan asked as she walked in. \"Sammy wanted to hang out with him\" Nikki said \"Sammy said he wanted to show Garrett some moves.\" \"That's should be interesting to find out about\" Ryan said \"So now what will you do?\" \"Rest\" Nikki said \"since both kids are gone.\" \"Sounds good to me\" Ryan said following her to the bedroom yet again. \"Honey if you want to do something else you can\" Nikki said. \"There isn't really much to do.\" Ryan said \"Unless we watch a movie or read together or something. The time we spend together is usually peaceful and sweet rather then romantic anyway. Besides we have two kids what need do we have to be romantic anymore?\" \"True\" Nikki said \"and a movie would be good.\" \"That couch is looking awefully comfy\" Ryan said smiling leading her to the living room now. \"Yes it is\" Nikki said as the two of them sat on the couch together and watched a movie. The movie was over quickly and the afternoon came. \"Looks like both kids won't be back until time for the hunt\" Ryan said smiling. \"Who knows\" Nikki said \"this is the first time I have ever let Garrett go with Sammy.\" \"True enough\" Ryan said \"But being as close as he is I don't think Sammy would hurt him.\" \"I know\" Nikki said. \"We might as well go read a book\" Ryan said smiling \"I don't think we have enough time to watch another movie unless you really want to.\" \"Lets watch another movie\" Nikki said. \"Fair enough\" Ryan put in another movie and once it was over it did in fact start to get dark and Garrett was coming back home. \"Hey Garrett\" Nikki said \"how was it with Sammy?\" \"It was.... fun\" Garrett said softly before he went to his room without another word. It didn't seem that Sammy had came with him. Nikki knew something was wrong so she went to see Garrett. \"Garrett honey what is wrong?\" Nikki asked. \"What do you mean?\" Garrett asked not looking up at her, he was playing with the new action figures they had got him. \"What happened with you and Sammy?\" Nikki asked \"you seem upset.\" \"He told me things\" Garrett said \"That's all.\" \"Like what?\" Nikki asked. \"He said their were things that you had kept from me\" Garrett said \"Things that I didn't need to talk to you about, only with him.\" \"Tell me please\" Nikki said. \"He didn't want me to\" Garrett said \"You always told me to listen to those above me. I don't know who to listen to now I'm only a little kid mom, this shouldn't be dropped on to me.\" \"Honey I am over Sammy\" Nikki said \"I am the Alpha Female so you should talk to me.\" \"I'm not a wolf mom!\" Garrett said loudly and suddenly \"Don't talk to me like I am!\" \"Garrett you are a hybrid which means your half human half wolf\" Nikki said as she left. \"What was that all about?\" Ryan asked worried about both his wife and son. \"What happened?\" \"Sammy told him things\" Nikki said \"and he told me that he wasn't a wolf and not to talk to him like one.\" \"And you just left him like that?\" Ryan asked. \"I told him that he was a hybrid which meant that he was half wolf half human\" Nikki said \"I don't know what else to do.\" \"You go talk to Sammy\" Ryan said \"I am human I will talk to our son.\" \"I don't know if I can\" Nikki said. \"Go see him\" Ryan said \"See what he says about it.\" \"Ok\" Nikki said as she went to go talk to Sammy. \"Ah yes\" Sammy said when she entered as if he expected \"To what do I owe this honor Cousin?\" \"What did you tell Garrett Cousin?\" Nikki asked. \"Just what he needed to know\" Sammy said \"I told him about you and his father's past. And I showed him what he is.\" \"You know he is half wolf and half human which makes him a hybrid\" Nikki said \"also I was trying to keep it from him because of the fact that I didn't want him hurt.\" Sammy just shook his head and gave her a smile, one that didn't seem to be from something nice. \"What do you have on your mind Cousin?\" Nikki asked. \"I know he's a hybrid but what he didn't know is what human's were like\" Sammy said \"I showed that to him, and now he knows he has to choose to be a wolf or a man. And when he does with his power and my combat skills things will change around here.\" \"I don't think so\" Nikki said \"Ryan and I are the Alphas so you can't do anything without telling me or him.\" \"Dear cousin your forgetting\" Sammy said \"I was second in command to Garrison, your uncle never denied me that rank, he didn't acknowledge it either, but he didn't deny it. The same goes for your oaf of a husband. The pack still sees me as second in command. I can control them just as well as you can.\" \"Dear Cousin you know I could always deny the rank\" Nikki said. \"You could try\" Sammy said \"you would have to do it in front of the whole family be my guest.\" \"If you want to be in command be my guest but you seen what happened to my dad uncle and Garrison\" Nikki said. \"And that right there is the whole reason you won't be able to deny my rank\" Sammy said. \"You will be killed eventually\" Nikki said \"trust me on that cousin.\" \"Exactly\" Sammy said \"If you decide to kill me how well do you think the family is going to take it?\" \"Probably not too well but you see how they took my dad's and uncle's and Garrison's deaths\" Nikki said. \"Well in order to deny me my place you are going to have to tell them that you have a reason to mistrust me and do you think that with all these wolves around and your biased view that will work out?\" Sammy asked. \"Probably not\" Nikki said. \"Exactly\" Sammy said \"Sorry Cousin but your hands are tied. I've covered all the angles you just have to hope your little son makes the right decision.\" \"I hope so\" Nikki said as she was getting ready to leave. \"Good luck cousin\" Sammy said a little bit too cheerfully. She made it back to her own cave and found that Ryan had calmed Garrett down and now Cam was home. \"What did you find out from Sammy?\" Ryan asked. \"I really don't trust him now\" Nikki said \"I am going to talk to my mom for a while.\" \"We will be alright\" Ryan said \"I have calmed Garrett down, you go ahead.\" \"Thank you\" Nikki said as she headed to her mom's room. She found her mom still sitting in the chair. \"Is something wrong honey?\" She asked noticing the look on her daughter's face. \"Mom its Sammy\" Nikki said \"he showed Garrett what I wanted to hide from him and I don't know what to do.\" \"What is he trying to accomplish from doing that?\" Her mom asked. \"I don't know\" Nikki said. \"What part does Garrett play?\" Her mom asked \"What is Sammy's plan for him?\" \"I am not sure\" Nikki said \"I am scared and worried that Sammy is wanting to over throw me.\" \"I hate to tell you this honey but do you know who you sound like?\" Her mom told her. \"Who?\" Nikki asked. \"Your uncle\" She said \"Why do you think he wanted an heir so badly? Bad enough to hurt you he didn't want to lose his crown, just as you don't.\" \"Is that a bad thing?\" Nikki asked. \"You don't need to be that way\" Her mom said getting up from her rocking chair and moving to her bookshelf and grabbed a book. \"Having time to think and reading these human novels has made me realize that pride is a horrible thing.\" \"You know mom technically Sammy was supposed to be the next in line\" Nikki said \"I may give him what he wants.\" \"No he was never the next in line, only second in command.\" Her mom said. \"Is there a way I can drop that?\" Nikki asked. \"Growing up you always took the easy way out\" Her mom said in thought, \"Are you sure you want to do it again?\" \"I am willing to this time\" Nikki said \"I don't want him to hurt Garrett.\" \"No you don't understand\" Her mom said \"The easy way isn't going to save Garrett from getting hurt, maybe physically but not emotionally.\" \"What do I do then?\" Nikki asked. \"Did Sammy give Garrett any form of a choice?\" Her mom asked \"Or was just trying to brainwash him?\" \"I think he told Garrett that he would have to choose being a wolf or being human\" Nikki said \"and I don't know about the brainwashing.\" \"Alright\" Her mom said \"I would say the best thing to do would be to keep it low profile and make sure that Garrett makes the right choice.\" \"Ok\" Nikki said \"thank you for helping me out.\" Nikki had gotten up to leave now. \"Be careful\" Her mom said as she walked out. Nikki made her way back to the den that she stayed at with her family \"So what did she say?\" Cam asked. \"Too keep a low profile and make sure Garrett makes the right choice\" Nikki said \"Ryan what did you get from Garrett?\" \"Only that Sammy had told him that even though he was a hybrid he would have to choose to follow the life of a man, or the life of a wolf. And that we couldn't lead him because being both we would get thoughts and ideas mixed.\" Ryan said. \"Did he tell you what he would choose?\" Nikki asked. \"He said he wasn't sure yet\" Ryan said \"And that Sammy had given him a few days to think.\" \"I don't want Sammy alone with him\" Nikki said \"so one of us is going to have to be with him.\" \"Not a problem\" Cam said quickly \"I'll go he won't expect me.\" \"Cam are you sure you are up to this task?\" Nikki asked. \"I have to at least try don't I?\" Cam asked \"Dad can't face him and he knows all your moves.\" \"Alright Cam\" Nikki said \"just be careful please.\" \"I will be mom\" Cam said \"Once he decides I will go with him when he goes to tell Sammy his choice.\" \"Ok\" Nikki said \"also make sure you tell us what he decides when you hear it and come back home please.\" \"I'm not leaving yet nor have I decided\" Garrett said coming out of his room now \"No matter what I will tell you guys first. Your my mom and dad.\" \"I thought you had to tell Sammy first\" Nikki said \"also if its ok with you Cam is going to be there just in case Sammy tries anything.\" \"He never said I had to tell him first\" Garrett said \"I just want to make sure that all of you know I have to have time to think.\" \"Ok\" Nikki said \"still Cam is going with you because I don't trust Sammy now.\" \"I understand\" Garrett said. \"Garrett you know you don't have to be afraid to talk to us\" Nikki said \"we love you even though you are a hybrid.\" \"Right mom I know\" Garrett said \"I am just confused right now.\" \"I will try to help if you like\" Nikki said. \"He wants an answer but I don't have one\" Garrett said \"Which is better human or wolf?\" \"I think both is better because in a way we are all human and wolf\" Nikki said \"Ryan what do you say?\" \"Well all of you are human and wolf\" Ryan said \"I don't have wolf in me.\" \"I think your wolf is better but its also better to be human\" Nikki said. \"That doesn't really help\" Garrett said softly. \"Just trust me both are good\" Nikki said \"without one you wouldn't be whole.\" \"So which should I act more like?\" Garrett asked \"If I had to choose.\" \"I don't know on that\" Nikki said \"that is your choice.\" \"I want to choose human but I am not sure\" Garrett said. \"If that is what you want\" Nikki said \"then it is ok with us.\" \"Are you sure?\" Garrett asked. \"Yes\" Nikki said \"your our son and I will always love you.\" \"So do you want me to go tell him I choose human then?\" Garrett asked. \"Sure if that is what you want\" Nikki said. \"Let's go Cam\" Garrett said, Ready to head for Sammy's house.\" \"Be careful\" Nikki said. The two made their way to Sammy's house. \"Have you made your desicon?\" Sammy asked as they entered. \"Yes\" Garrett said \"And why is she here?\" He asked indicating Cam. \"Just to be here\" Cam said \"Do you have a problem with me being here?\" \"Hey hey chill\" Sammy said \"Just wondering.\" Cam stayed quite for a bit now so that Garrett could tell Sammy his choice. Garrett stuttered a bit but spoke up. \"I choose human\" He said \"Human huh?\" Sammy asked \"What do you think of that Cam?\" \"Its his choice\" Cam said \"I will still love him no matter what.\" \"Yes but your a wolf and he chose human doesn't that make you just a little bit mad?\" Sammy asked. \"No\" Cam said \"why would you ask me that?\" \"Makes him different doesn't it?\" Sammy asked. \"He is different but he is still my little brother\" Cam said. \"Are you sure about that?\" Sammy asked \"You do know Ryan isn't your father right?\" \"I know this\" Cam said \"he is my step father and that just makes Garrett my half brother because we have the same mom.\" \"And now he is wanting to be human\" Sammy said \"Not the wolf that he is, denying your side of the family.\" \"He will still be my brother no matter what\" Cam said \"Garrett lets go please.\" \"Remember what I told you\" Sammy told Garrett as Garrett and Cam went back to their parents rooms. \"Garrett remember what mom and dad told you they they will love you no matter what\" Cam said \"and that goes the same for me.\" \"I know\" Garrett said they soon made it back home. \"Did anything happen?\" Ryan asked. \"How did it go?\" Nikki asked. \"He seemed ok with his choice\" Cam said. Garrett didn't say anything at the moment. \"Did Sammy try any thing?\" Nikki asked. \"No he didn't\" Cam said \"He just talked to us is all.\" \"Ok\" Nikki said \"did he try to brainwash you?\" \"If he did he must have done before I was there\" Cam said \"He didn't have any effect on me.\" \"Ok\" Nikki said \"I am just glad that you are both ok.\" \"Me too\" Cam said \"Are we going to hunt tonight?\" \"I don't know\" Nikki said \"but I need to talk to the other adults if they will listen to me.\" \"I guess you will have to go to them one at a time\" Ryan said \"If you hold a meeting Sammy will catch it.\" \"I know\" Nikki said \"that is what I am worried about even doing it alone with them.\" \"Do you want me to go with you?\" Ryan asked. \"No\" Nikki said \"but I would like Garrett to go with me.\" \"Me?\" Garrett asked \"Why me?\" \"Because you know whats going on\" Nikki said \"please Garrett you could save a lot of your family.\" \"Save them?\" Garrett asked \"Save them how?\" \"Keep them from following Sammy\" Nikki said \"are you willing to help?\" \"Why can't they follow Sammy?\" Garrett asked. \"He knows more of wolves then we do.\" \"Who knows what he will do\" Nikki said \"if I know Sammy he would try to turn them against me.\" \"What does it matter anymore?\" Garrett asked \"We live as humans now right? The only wolf thing we do is hunt.\" \"It does matter\" Nikki said \"one of these days this will be yours and your sister's pack.\" \"But we are leaving aren't we?\" Garrett asked \"We have to, to not live as wolves.\" \"Yea but I can't leave right now until I find the replacement Alphas\" Nikki said \"if Ryan still has his house we can live there.\" \"That is what Sammy is for right?\" Garrett asked. \"He is only second in command\" Nikki said \"and I don't trust him to run the pack.\" \"But he is most logical choice isn't he?\" Garrett asked. \"I don't trust him\" Nikki said \"but yes he would be along with others.\" \"What makes you not trust him?\" Garrett asked. \"I have a feeling that he is up to something\" Nikki said \"but I don't know what.\" \"So what are we going to do?\" Garrett asked. \"I want to stay\" Nikki said \"and I would like you all to stay as well.\" \"I guess we have to hope that the pack can accept us as humans\" Garrett said. \"They will\" Nikki said \"they accepted your dad.\" \"Why is it so hard to belong somewhere?\" Garrett asked. \"I don't know sweetie\" Nikki said. \"Do you think you belong?\" Garrett asked. \"I don't know\" Nikki said. Garrett was sad as they made it to one of the other family member's homes \"Yes?\" It was Dana and Dina's home. Nikki was glad to see her cousins. \"hey guys\" Nikki said. \"Is something wrong?\" Dana asked. \"I need to talk to all of you\" Nikki said \"where is Aunt Marge and Uncle Eric?\" \"They are here\" Dina said leading Nikki and Garrett inside. \"Thank you Dina\" Nikki said as she followed her. \"What's up?\" Eric asked when they walked on in. \"Its Sammy\" Nikki said as she told them what was going on. After a while she said to them \"I have a feeling he is up to something but I don't know what\" She said. \"So Garrett chose to be a human then?\" Eric asked. \"Yes\" Nikki said. \"What are you going to do?\" Marge asked. \"I don't know yet\" Nikki said \"I want to stay but Garrett is worried that no one will accept him as human so he wanted to leave.\" \"What do you mean?\" Marge asked \"I thought you were going to leave anyway?\" \"I don't know\" Nikki said \"the only thing is I don't want to leave this is my family and also I don't trust Sammy to be in charge.\" \"You didn't tell me you were planning on leaving anyway\" Garrett said softly. \"I was going to before\" Nikki said \"but I am going to stay if that is ok.\" \"Are you sure?\" Dana asked \"What about Sammy?\" \"That is why I want to stay\" Nikki said \"If Ryan wants he can take Cam and Garrett to his house while I stay here for now.\" \"What are you thinking of doing about Sammy?\" Dana asked. \"I want to strip him of his title but the pack has to be with me on it\" Nikki said \"I am just scared that the family will follow him more so than me.\" \"What do you plan to do if he doesn't let you strip the title?\" Marge asked. \"I haven't got that far\" Nikki said \"I just know I have to something or Sammy is going to ruin everything.\" \"You have to go in there with a plan\" Eric said \"If you don't you really will lose.\" \"Do any of you have ideas?\" Nikki asked. \"You were all ready to go in there until I said you needed a plan\" Eric said \"What were you going to do, as a leader you can't think like you are.\" \"I really never had a plan to begin with\" Nikki said \"I just can't stand to see any one hurt like Garrett was.\" \"But I wasn't hurt\" Garrett said \"Merely given a choice, one that I had to make eventually. This is all you mom, your worry, why don't we just leave?\" \"Alright fine\" Nikki said \"I guess I will leave it all to Sammy even though I don't want to.\" Garrett soon got ready to leave his cousins house waiting for his mom. Nikki followed him out now. \"Thank you mom\" Garrett said \"I'm sorry but everything is just too much right now.\" \"Your welcome\" Nikki said \"If your dad will I will have him take you guys out of here.\" \"What about you?\" Garrett asked. \"I need time alone\" Nikki said \"I am sorry.\" They had made it back to Ryan's part of the caves now. \"Do you think Dad will let you do that?\" Garrett asked \"Daddy let you do what?\" Ryan repeated since he was close enough to hear. \"Take him and Cam to your house\" Nikki said \"and let me stay here and have time alone.\" \"What are you thinking?\" Ryan asked \"Your not going to do anything rash are you?\" \"No\" Nikki said \"because there is really nothing I can do anymore.\" \"What do you mean nothing you can do?\" Ryan asked \"There is always something you can do. What do you think Sammy has planned?\" \"I don't know\" Nikki said \"That is what I have to think about.\" \"If you are sure that that is what you think is best I will do\" Ryan said \"Just be careful.\" \"I will\" Nikki said \"and I am sure.\" \"Alright then\" Ryan said \"I guess we will head back to my old home if I still have it.\" \"I hope so\" Nikki said \"also thank you.\" \"You don't have to thank me\" Ryan said \"Just make sure to stay safe until you come to meet me\" He then went inside to gather his things. \"I will\" Nikki said as she went to tell Garrett and Cam to get their things packed. The kids began to do so. \"Are you sure you will be ok?\" Cam asked and Garrett hugged her tightly. \"Don't leave us mom.\" \"Yes I will\" Nikki said \"I will meet up with you guys soon.\" \"I hope so\" Garrett said and Ryan came up to them. He smiled and offered a kiss to Nikki as he walked up. Nikki kissed all of them. \"See you soon right?\" Ryan said walking on through the forest. \"And if my apartment is taken by now I will send Cam back to tell you ok?\" \"Alright and see you soon\" Nikki said \"be careful all of you.\" \"We have no reason to be\" Ryan said \"But you do\" The three then began to walk away, Garrett kept looking back scared. Nikki went into the cave now and she went and sat on her bed to come up with a plan to see about taking Sammy's title away. She realized that Sammy was either tying to control Garrett or trying to lead the pack. And before Garrett he had watched Cam closely. He wasn't exactly wanting to overthrow her just deem her unfit to lead and then control her kids to pick up the slack. Nikki kept trying to figure out what to do but she wasn't come up with anything. \"Whatcha doin'?\" Sammy's voice was heard behind her. \"Nothing\" Nikki said \"Why are you here?\" \"I saw your family leave and thought that if you finally came to your senses I should come here and make myself at home\" Sammy said leaning against the door. \"What is your plan?\" Nikki asked \"to rule the pack?\" \"That's part of it but not the only thing I want\" Sammy said. \"What else do you want?\" Nikki asked. \"I want your life to be miserable\" Sammy said with a sneer \"I want you to feel worthless.\" \"Why?\" Nikki asked. \"Because you have done the same to me\" Sammy said. \"What have I done to you?\" Nikki asked. \"You changed this pack\" Sammy said \"You made it....human...all that I trained for growing up was a waste.\" \"I trained the same way too\" Nikki said \"and I didn't like how my dad and uncle had done everything and I thought I was making it better.\" \"No you didn't\" Sammy said \"You were sheltered, babied, you don't have the heart of a wolf. If you did you have never fell in love with a scrap of meat.\" \"He understood me\" Nikki said \"as to where no one else here did.\" \"Exactly\" Sammy said \"You felt like you were out of place right?\" \"Yea a little\" Nikki said \"so what you want me to break up with him and go with someone here?\" \"I want you to choose\" Sammy said \"Just as your little halfling boy did. Be a wolf, or be a human. No matter what you may think, being both is impossible.\" \"You know your impossible to deal with now I know why I never liked you\" Nikki said \"your too much like your brother Garrison.\" \"I will treat you the same as I did your son. I will give you time to decide now you can either do that and come to me with the right choice or run away to your new life as a human.\" Sammy said walking off. Nikki had to make the choice and she knew what ever she did it would hurt her and her family. Nikki sat in her room and sobbed. Nikki had been crying for some time now before she heard another voice. \"Mom?\" It was Cam \"Is everything ok?\" \"No\" Nikki said \"Sammy is giving me the choice to choose between human and wolf and what ever I do will hurt us.\" \"What makes you say that?\" Cam asked. \"Because if I choose wolf then that would tear Ryan up\" Nikki said \"and if I go human I won't be able to see anyone again so either way I am screwed.\" \"So you have to decide between the three of us and the entire pack?\" Cam asked. \"Yes\" Nikki said. \"Then why not come with us?\" Cam asked \"Is living as a human so bad? I've already gotten used to it at the school.\" \"I just don't know if I could get used to human life\" Nikki said. \"Are you not even willing to try?\" Cam asked. \"I have been raised as a wolf\" Nikki said \"and I have been in the human world and lived there for a while.\" \"You act like it's two different worlds\" Cam said \"I'm a wolf too mom, its not that hard.\" \"I guess so\" Nikki said \"I just don't want Sammy to take over.\" \"Mom I know you don't trust him but what has he really done to you?\" Cam asked. \"He has always out ranked me in everything\" Nikki said \"and now that I out rank him its hard to let it go.\" \"But didn't you tell me that you were the princess at one time? The next in line as alpha female?\" Cam asked \"How did he out rank you there?\" \"Hes always been better at everything\" Nikki said \"that part he didn't out rank me but he acted too much like a prince because he got everything he wanted and I didn't get much of nothing.\" \"Well if he wants to lead the pack now let him\" Cam said \"It's not worth it I know that some members of the pack will come by and see us no matter what he says.\" \"I guess its for the better but I know how he will run things and that is what I don't like\" Nikki said \"that is why I tried changing it.\" \"I know mom but if it comes into contact with us we will take it as it comes\" She said offering her hand \"Now come on let's go get grandma and get to our new home.\" \"Ok\" Nikki said \"lets go.\" Nikki took Cam's hand and went to get her mom. The two walked to her mom's room \"Grandma we have a new place to go and we are taking you\" Her mom stood up slowly and didn't say anything. \"Take her to the house please\" Nikki said \"I am going to go tell Dana and Dina right quick.\" \"Alright\" Cam said \"Follow me grandma\" Cam and Nikki's mom then left. Nikki then went to Dana's and Dina's house. Dana was the one that answered the door when she knocked \"Oh hello again\" She said \"I thought you left?\" \"I am but I wanted to come and say bye\" Nikki said \"also if you guys are in town look us up.\" \"We will when we can\" Marge said walking in \"And you be careful with all those humans around ok?\" \"I will Aunt Marge\" Nikki said \"and thank you also all of you be careful please.\" \"We will be\" Eric said coming and hugging her \"We will remember what you taught us and not let Sammy change us back into the wild wolves we were before.\" \"That is good to hear\" Nikki said as she hugged them \"also make sure everyone else tries to remember what I taught them please and I love all of you.\" \"We love you too\" Dana said smiling \"You never forget us alright?\" \"I won't\" Nikki said \"also don't forget us.\" \"Never\" Dina said also smiling just like her sister. \"See you later ok?\" \"Bye everyone\" Nikki said as she took off towards town. Nikki found Cam on the outskirts of the forest just before town. \"Come on mom I will lead you to our new place\" She said. \"Did you get grandma there ok?\" Nikki asked. \"Yup\" Cam said showing Nikki the new house. \"With all of the interest he collected over the years dad was able to buy this house with cash. It's all ours.\" \"Wow this place is nice\" Nikki said as her and Cam went in. \"Darn\" Nikki said \"I forgot to pack.\" \"No you didn't\" Ryan said \"I got that don't worry.\" \"Thanks honey\" Nikki said. \"No problem and lets hope that things are a lot calmer here then they were in the woods\" Ryan said. \"I hope it is\" Nikki said \"also Aunt Marge and Uncle Eric said they may try to visit us whenever they come to town.\" \"That's good to know\" Ryan said \"Since I am going to be staying here I need to go back to doing my job again if I can.\" \"I hope so\" Nikki said \"I guess its a good thing we are here in town now because it makes it better for Cam then.\" Nikki then smiled \"Cam don't you see some of your cousins in school?\" she asked. \"At times\" Cam said \"But they hardly ever talk to me. At least they didn't before, who knows about now.\" \"If they talk to you tell them to come and visit\" Nikki said \"and if they want to stay they can.\" \"We shall see what they say\" Cam said \"I will ask them tomorrow but for now I think we should get some sleep in our new beds.\" \"Good idea\" Nikki said as she headed to her's and Ryan's room. Ryan opened the door to show a bed that was plenty big enough for them both. \"Wow this room is nicer than the one in the cave\" Nikki said. \"Yeah\" Ryan said \"I would hope so\" He then got ready to lay down. Nikki then got ready for bed as well. \"I love you\" Ryan said as he climbed into the bed after changing. \"I love you too\" Nikki said as she laid down \"Honey did you get my book?\" \"Yup\" Ryan said \"It's right here\" He handed it to her still bookmarked. \"Thank you\" Nikki said as she started reading again. Ryan just handed it to her and smiled \"You learning anything from it or just reading it for fun?\" He asked. \"Just for fun\" Nikki said. \"Oh ok\" Ryan said just letting her read it for now as he placed one hand on her belly and the other played with her hair as she read. \"I missed all this\" Nikki said. \"Missed all what?\" Ryan asked softly. \"Missed having my own room\" Nikki said \"at least like this.\" \"Oh\" Ryan said \"So its something that you had as human that you missed huh?\" \"Well when we had the first cave I had my own room\" Nikki said. \"I know\" Ryan said. He still kept doing what he had started as she spoke and read. \"It feels great to finally have a room to ourselves\" Nikki said. \"Too bad we have no reason to do anything in it\" Ryan said playfully. \"Yea I know\" Nikki said \"but I really don't think I can handle another kid.\" \"Is it some wolf thing that says your going to get a kid every time?\" Ryan asked \"If so then what was your uncle worried about if he knew it would come anyway.\" \"No there is nothing like that\" Nikki said \"I just figure that it might happen.\" \"Well then if you don't want to risk it that's fine\" Ryan said \"I love you anyway\" He then laid down next to her to let her finish reading taking his hands away. \"I love you too\" Nikki said as she finished the chapter was on. Ryan just rested behind her waiting to see if she would fall asleep before him knowing that it was probably true. Nikki was falling asleep now. Ryan just let her do so and smiled when he heard her soft breathing as he went to sleep as well. Nikki was fast asleep now. The night was peaceful and Nikki woke up first to the sunlight coming in from the window. Nikki climbed off the bed and went over to the window. Nikki looked out and saw all the other people getting ready for their early jobs and heading away from homes. She saw the woods she used to live in in the distance. Nikki missed life in the woods now. All her family was still there her cousins and Aunt and Uncle were. \"You ok?\" Ryan asked waking up and standing behind her as she looked out the window. \"I miss my family\" Nikki said \"its so different.\" \"You have your family here\" Ryan said \"It's smaller but it's still here.\" \"I know\" Nikki said \"I meant my extended family my aunts and uncles and cousins.\" \"Your so used to being around them aren't you?\" Ryan asked placing his hands on her shoulders. \"Yes I am\" Nikki said \"I have always been around them so its hard to be away from them.\" \"I can understand that\" Ryan said \"Most of them are good people, but with that many minds you can't count on them all agreeing.\" \"True\" Nikki said. \"Which is better trying to control a family of four to five or a family fifteen to thirty?\" Ryan asked. \"I say the four to five\" Nikki said. \"There you go then\" Ryan said smiling. \"I am just glad to be home\" Nikki said. \"I am glad your home too\" Ryan said \"Now let's go downstairs for breakfast.\" \"Good idea\" Nikki said. They went downstairs and started work on breakfast. \"So what are we going to make today more pancakes?\" Ryan asked. \"Sure\" Nikki said as she was making pancakes. Ryan helped her mix the batter as her mom and the kids came down the stairs. Nikki and Ryan finished the batter and Nikki started frying the pancakes. \"It already smells good\" Her mom said smiling. \"Thank you mom\" Nikki said as she plated the pancakes. Soon enough they were all eating. \"I will need to go check my old studio today\" Ryan said softly as he ate. \"Ok\" Nikki said \"Why don't you take the kids?\" \"Probably wouldn't be a good idea\" Ryan said \"It is a building of mostly silver you know.\" \"True\" Nikki said \"I forgot about that if I am not mistaken its where we hid wasn't it?\" \"Yup\" Ryan said \"Though if they really want to go I guess I can cover their mouths so they don't inhale the silver like I did you.\" \"Kids would you like that?\" Nikki asked. \"What exactly is at this studio?\" Garrett asked \"All the pictures that I took many years ago.\" Ryan said \"Some of when your mom was younger\" \"That would be cool to see\" Cam said. \"Just remember to keep your mouths covered\" Nikki said. \"Alright\" Cam said \"Why?\" Garrett asked. \"Your dad's studio has silver in it and silver can kill us if we get too much into our system\" Nikki said. \"Oh\" Garrett said \"But what are you going to do while we are gone mom?\" \"Stay here and clean\" Nikki said \"I know what the studio is like and I want you to see it and the pictures your dad took.\" \"Ok\" Garrett said \"Let's go dad\" The three of them got ready and left with Ryan to the studio. It being a Saturday Cam didn't have to worry about school. Nikki was cleaning the house now. Ryan led the way to his old studio and was suprised to see that it was still standing and that none of his things had been moved. They were all covered with dust but they were still there. \"Dad this place is amazing\" Cam said \"How long have you had this studio?\" \"I had only had it for a few years before I met your mom\" Ryan said \"But I haven't been here in decades.\" \"How did you and mom meet?\" Cam asked. \"That's actually an interesting story\" Ryan said \"I was going to one of the large buildings in town to get an idea for my next movie and I came across your mom, she had went there to think.\" \"Wow that is interesting\" Cam said \"So where was it you two met?\" \"That one Palace in town\" Ryan said remembering the place. \"Let's go back to your mom with a few videos and see if she wants to head there for old time sake.\" \"Good idea\" Cam said \"it would be nice to see where you and mom met.\" \"Do you want to see it too Garrett?\" Ryan asked his son \"Sure\" Garrett said and the family then went back home to talk to Nikki. They found her just finishing up the cleaning. Ryan smiled at her. \"Welcome back\" Nikki said \"so what did you think of the studio?\" \"It was really cool\" Cam said \"And mom can we go to the place that you and dad first met? This Palace?\" \"That would be great\" Nikki said \"I would love to see the Palace again.\" \"Do you still remember where it is?\" Ryan asked \"It's been quite a while.\" \"Not right off the bat\" Nikki said. \"Do you think you will be able to find it?\" Ryan asked \"If we go out and look?\" \"It's possible\" Nikki said. \"Well let's give it a try\" Ryan said smiling and offering his hand to her. Nikki took his hand and the family went to go to the Palace. \"It shouldn't be too hard to find if it is still there\" Ryan said. Nikki looked towards the woods again and saw Tracy make his way there again. \"Cam didn't you tell Tracy we had moved?\" Nikki asked as she found the Palace. \"I hadn't got a chance\" Cam said seeing him and running to his side before he got too deep in the woods. Soon enough the two of them came back to the family's side \"That was close\" Cam said \"I don't know what would have happened if Tracy had went there.\" \"Hey Tracy\" Nikki said. Tracy was still really shy about talking with a bunch of people around but his curiostiy got the better of him \"Why did you guys move into town?\" He asked softly. \"We chose to be human\" Nikki said. \"And just leave your wolf lives behind?\" Tracy asked still soft. \"Yea\" Nikki said \" There is still some of my aunts and uncles that said they wouldn't go back to the wild wolves.\" \"That's good\" Tracy said \"At least you still get to talk to some of them.\" \"Yea some\" Nikki said \"a lot of Cam's Cousins are at your school.\" \"I didn't know that now\" Tracy said and then fell silent as they made it to the Palace after looking for it for a while. \"This is it\" Nikki said. \"It looks wonderful\" Cam said \"I see why you always came here to think mom.\" \"Its just as I remember\" Nikki said \"lets go in.\" \"Yeah\" Ryan said smiling as he walked on in with his kids and Tracy. Garrett was speechless as he looked up at how tall the Palace was. \"This is where I met your dad\" Nikki said \"He was a photographer and he was taking pictures here.\" \"And I ended up taking this wonderful picture of her instead\" Ryan said smiling bringing out the old picture. \"You kept that photo after all these years and you never told me\" Nikki said. \"I found it at the studio when I went back\" Ryan said \"Honest.\" \"That was a long time ago\" Nikki said \"I was still a child then.\" \"You weren't that young honey\" Ryan said playfully \"You were older then Cam is now.\" \"But you have to think my father was still around\" Nikki said \"That is why I said that I was a child.\" \"What does your father have to do with you being a child?\" Ryan asked. \"You remember how scared I was to face him\" Nikki said \"also remember I also had to sneak away just to see you because my dad didn't like humans.\" \"So you were a rebelling teen\" Ryan said smiling \"You were as beautiful to me then as you are now and you were far from a child when I first met you.\" \"I guess\" Nikki said \"but do you remember what we did to my dad when we were here?\" \"I do\" Ryan said \"You can't tell me you think a child would have been able to do that.\" \"I guess not\" Nikki said \"It was more grown up than anything.\" \"You got it\" Ryan said \"Now do you want to head back home?\" \"Not yet\" Nikki said \"lets see if that Diner is still there and have lunch.\" \"Good idea\" Ryan said. Nikki and the family went to the diner. Ryan smiled as they entered the diner it was just as they had left it. \"Lets see what we want\" Nikki said looking at the menu. \"It's the same as it was before\" Ryan said and he ordered the meal that he remembered getting for himself all the time. \"I think I will have a hamburger and a sprite\" Nikki said. The kids got the same kinds of sandwiches and they all went to sit down at a booth to wait on their meal. The family was glad to be spending time together. Once their meal was done an older woman came out to them. She looked about Ryan and Nikki's age and seemed almost familiar. \"Ryan doesn't that girl seem familiar?\" Nikki asked softly. \"A little bit\" Ryan said. The girl stopped and turned to them \"Did you say his name was Ryan?\" The girl asked softly. \"Yes I did\" Nikki said \"and I am Nikki.\" \"Where have you guys been?\" The girl asked Nikki realized it was the girl that Ryan had introduced her to before Marie. \"Its a long story\" Nikki said \"Also how have you been?\" \"I have been doing good I guess\" Marie said then she noticed the kids \"Are these...\" \"These are my kids my daughter Cam and my son Garrett\" Nikki said \"kids this is Marie.\" Tracy waved as well but said nothing. Marie smiled \"Are they yours too Ryan?\" She asked. Ryan smiled and nodded \"And the quiet one?\" \"No the quite one Tracy is Cam's boyfriend\" Nikki said. \"Wow lots has changed for you guys I guess\" Marie said. \"Yes it has \" Nikki said \"also Ryan and I are married if you could call it that.\" \"I figured that\" Marie said smiling \"And what do you mean if you could call it that?\" \"It wasn't an actual wedding\" Nikki said \"we just said vows.\" \"That still counts I think\" Marie said smiling. \"So do you have a boyfriend or any kids Marie?\" Nikki asked. \"Sadly no\" Marie said \"I could never get away from this simple job to do anything.\" \"That's sad\" Nikki said \"also if you ever get time we have a place in town and you can come visit.\" \"That's good to know\" Marie said \"I am glad that you guys were able to come back.\" \"So are we\" Nikki said \"here is the address.\" \"Thanks\" Marie said \"You guys take care I have to get back to work.\" \"We will\" Nikki said \"and you take care.\" Nikki finished her burger and drink. Ryan finished as well so they were just waiting for the kids. \"Now who was that?\" Cam asked. \"An old friend of ours\" Nikki said \"she is very sweet.\" \"Seems that way\" Cam said \"See mom\" Garrett said smiling. \"So what do you think of this diner?\" Nikki asked. \"It seems like a good place to hang out.\" Cam said \"It's old style though\" Tracy commented \"But I guess that's part of its appeal.\" \"That is what makes this place special\" Nikki said \"all of this is original right Ryan.\" \"I think so\" Ryan said as the kids finished their meals. \"We ready to go?\" \"I am\" Nikki said \"lets tell Marie bye before we go.\" \"Alright\" Ryan said moving towards the front desk to catch Marie. Nikki seen her now. \"See you later Marie\" Nikki said. \"Bye you guys\" She said from behind the counter \"Take care.\" \"We will\" Nikki said \"you take care of yourself too.\" The family then left the diner and headed back for home. \"That was a great lunch\" Nikki said \"and it was great to see an old friend.\" \"Your right about that\" Ryan said \"I guess the woods and the wolves weren't our whole life huh?\" \"I guess not\" Nikki said \"Ryan do you still have the video you made forever ago?\" \"The one of you\" Ryan asked \"It's probably in the studio why?\" \"Because I wanted the kids to see it and I also wanted to see it again\" Nikki said. \"You go ahead and head home and I will go get it ok\" Ryan said. \"Ok\" Nikki said \"kids lets go.\" \"Um...\" Tracy tried to speak up. \"Can he watch them too mom?\" Cam asked. \"Sure\" Nikki said \"if he likes he can stay at the house with us.\" Tracy shook his head. \"Not right yet mom\" Cam said blushing \"We are still kids and I am sure his parents will wonder where he's went if he does that.\" \"Ok\" Nikki said \"maybe another time.\" Tracy smiled to Nikki \"I am sure he thanks you for the offer though\" Cam said translating Tracy's non-existent speech. \"Its no problem\" Nikki said \"I see him as another son.\" Tracy looked to Cam \"She's pretty quick in her decisions\" She said smiling \"You get used to it.\" The family made it home now. They entered the house and found Nikki's mother still resting in her rocking chair by the window. \"Hello welcome home\" She said softly as they came in \"Where's Ryan?\" \"He went to his studio to get a movie\" Nikki said \"he should be here soon.\" \"What sort of movie?\" Her mom asked. \"A movie that he done with me in it\" Nikki said. \"That's right he is a filmmaker and photographer isn't he?\" Her mom asked. \"That's right mom\" Nikki said. \"I can't wait to see it\" Her mom said. At that moment Ryan came back in with the movie, \"I hope it still works\" He said softly \"It was covered with dust.\" \"I hope so too\" Nikki said as they gathered around the tv. Ryan put the tape into the player and carefully started things up. The movie was a little bit staticy due to its age but it still worked. Nikki liked the movie even now. It soon got to the scene that Nikki was in as a teenager. \"There she is\" Ryan said smiling as they saw young Nikki running through the woods. \"Wow Cam looks too much like me when I was her age\" Nikki said softly. \"You think so?\" Cam asked. \"Yes I do\" Nikki said. \"I guess your right\" Cam said. Tracy wanted to say something but stayed quiet. \"Tracy is there something you wanted to say?\" Nikki asked. \"Just that I know where Cam got her good looks from now\" Tracy said softly and shyly hiding his face a little as he did so. \"And her liking for humans\" Nikki said. \"Hey now\" Cam started \"Now your just picking on me.\" \"I am sorry\" Nikki said \"but your the only other one that has a boyfriend that is human.\" \"As far as you know\" Cam said \"There are many cousins going to the school remember?\" \"True\" Nikki said. The movie had finished now. \"What did you think of the movie?\" Nikki asked. \"I liked it\" Garrett said \"A little fuzzy but that's ok\" Cam said smiling \"At least mom was in it.\" \"Mom what did you think?\" Nikki asked. \"You did a good job honey\" Her mom said \"I am glad I got to see it.\" \"I am glad you got to see it too\" Nikki said. \"So what's the plan for the rest of the day?\" Cam asked. \"If you and Tracy want to go out then that is fine\" Nikki said. Tracy was a little surprised that Nikki had thought that up but he smiled \"Sure\" Cam said \"Let's go Tracy\" The two then got up to leave. \"Cam and Tracy you both be careful and be safe\" Nikki said. \"Always\" Cam said. With that the two made their way to the mall. \"Garrett are you going to go to your room and play with your toys?\" Nikki asked. \"Was just about to mom\" Garrett said smiling \"I just wanted to look at this old tape that your movie was on first.\" \"Why?\" Nikki asked. \"Just to see what it was like\" He said \"It looked interesting\" Garrett then left up to his room. \"Ok\" Nikki said as she watched him go to his room. \"Mom are you ok?\" Nikki asked. \"I will be\" She said \"Just need to rest in my chair.\" \"If you need me I will be in mine and Ryan's room\" Nikki said. \"I should be ok\" She said smiling to her daughter. \"You go ahead\" Ryan had already made his way up to the room to get some of his things that he still had packed in there set up. \"Ok\" Nikki said \"I love you.\" Nikki was getting ready to head up to her room now. Ryan was still getting things set up when she walked in. \"Sweetie do you think you could do a family photo?\" Nikki asked. \"Probably so\" He said \"You want one?\" \"Yes\" Nikki said \"I think it would be good to have it.\" \"Alright\" Ryan said \"I guess we will have to wait until Cam gets home to do it then.\" \"That works for me\" Nikki said. Ryan smiled at her at the idea of a family photo. Cam and Tracy had went to the mall first before they were going to go see a short movie. \"So what do you want this time?\" Tracy asked as they stood in the food court again. \"Just a burger with ketchup only and a mountain dew to drink\" Cam said. \"Sounds good to me\" Tracy said smiling \"I'll get the same.\" \"At least you have good taste in food\" Cam said. \"What do you mean by that?\" Tracy asked. \"Your starting to like the same foods as I do\" Cam said smiling. \"And that makes me have a good taste in food?\" Tracy asked teasingly \"Who says you do?\" \"I just know it\" Cam said. \"Uh huh\" Tracy said smiling \"At any rate the food is good anyway.\" \"Yes it is\" Cam said. \"So do you want to head for the movie now?\" Tracy asked. \"Sure\" Cam said. The two then walked on to the movies to get their seats before it started. Cam was glad to spend time with Tracy. \"This is the best day\" Cam said. \"What makes you say that?\" Tracy asked softly. \"It just is\" Cam said \"you got to watch the movie my dad made and now we went to see this one its been a great day.\" \"True\" Tracy said \"And now we don't have to worry about you going to the woods all the time and I can actually walk you home if I want to.\" \"That is so true\" Cam said \"and my mom and dad wouldn't care.\" \"Nope\" Tracy said chuckling \"They even said I could stay a while your parents are awesome.\" \"Which is a good thing\" Cam said \"and like my mom said she thanks of you as a son.\" \"Because you have been around me a while\" Cam said \"at least that is what I figure.\" \"True enough\" Tracy said as the movie ended\" Should I lead you home now.\" He offered his hand. \"Sure\" Cam said. The two then made their way to Ryan's new house. \"Thank you\" Cam said \"I had a great time today.\" \"Me too\" Tracy said as he smiled at her his face close to hers. Cam wasn't sure what to make of this. Tracy backed away quickly not wanting to bother her with it. \"I-I guess I will see you later\" He said starting to leave. \"Bye\" Cam said as she went inside. Cam found her dad waiting for her he wasn't mad or anything, he was actually smiling. \"What is so funny?\" Cam asked. \"Nothings funny\" Ryan said \"I just noticed what happened between you and Tracy out there.\" \"What?\" Cam asked. \"The boy wanted to kiss you but was too shy to ask you know\" Ryan said softly. \"Oh\" Cam said \"I didn't know.\" \"I know you didn't\" Ryan said \"It's why I am telling you. You can't pick up on human body language well yet. Would you want to kiss him?\" \"Yes\" Cam said. \"Well the next time something like that happens make sure you do\" Ryan said smiling \"You two are cute together anyway.\" \"I will try\" Cam said. \"That's a good girl\" Ryan said \"I'm not worried about him hurting you as much as I am worried about you hurting him, if you are anything like your mother...\" He let that trail off. \"What dad?\" Cam asked. \"Its easy for you wolf-girls to hurt us guys\" He said softly \"Without even trying, I just want you to be careful ok?\" \"I will dad\" Cam said \"also how did mom hurt you?\" \"She scared me\" Ryan said \"The pack attacked me for the hunt back when they hunted humans and I almost killed her.\" \"How?\" Cam asked. \"With silver\" Was all Ryan said and he started to make his way back to his and Nikki's room. Cam headed to her room now. Nikki was in the bath when Ryan walked in. Ryan walked in and didn't see Nikki at first but then realized she must be in the bathroom at the moment. He didn't hear any water so she must have been in there just to take a bath or use it. He got ready for bed and started to lay down. Nikki was getting out of the tub now and she dried off and went into the room to get her clothes. \"Hey Darling\" Nikki said when she entered. \"Why hello\" He said \"Since when do you call me that?\" \"I just now came up with it\" Nikki said as she put on her nightgown. \"Really?\" Ryan said \"Well I like it.\" \"I am glad\" Nikki said as she went to lay down beside Ryan. \"So what are we going to do tomorrow?\" Ryan asked as he petted her belly like he always did. \"I don't know\" Nikki said. Ryan smiled and started to play with her hair with his other hand. \"Wanna make another movie?\" He asked. \"Sure\" Nikki said \"also lets not forget the family picture.\" \"Of course not\" Ryan said \"Maybe everyone can be in the movie too.\" \"That would be good\" Nikki said. \"I love you\" Ryan said softly as he moved her hair away to kiss the back of her neck softly. \"I love you too\" Nikki said. \"You know what I found out today?\" Ryan asked softly going back to playing with her hair. \"What?\" Nikki asked. \"Our little girl is growing up\" Ryan said. \"She might get her first kiss soon.\" \"That is good\" Nikki said \"I hope she does get her first kiss.\" \"Tracy wanted to kiss her as he left but she didn't realize he wanted it\" Ryan said smiling at his daughters naivety. \"Just like me\" Nikki said. \"She is growing alot like you did\" Ryan said \"But at least she has no reason to rebel.\" \"True\" Nikki said \"and at least she is getting to do something that I didn't which is going to school.\" \"That's true\" Ryan said smiling \"Let's get some rest now ok?\" \"Ok\" Nikki said as she just laid there thinking about how she had missed out on a lot of things. \"Are you ok?\" Ryan asked noticing that she wasn't falling asleep right away. \"Yea I am fine just thinking about how much I had missed out on growing up\" Nikki said. \"Well now you can ask the kids all about it\" Ryan said smiling \"It will be ok.\" \"I know\" Nikki said \"I am just glad they can grow up better than I did.\" \"You grew up just fine honey\" Ryan said. \"True\" Nikki said as she was falling asleep now. Ryan smiled as she fell asleep and was soon asleep himself. The morning came and Nikki found herself waking up first again. Nikki got up and went to go get breakfast started now. Ryan was soon up and downstairs as she finished breakfast. Nikki was plating the breakfast now. \"Cam Garrett Breakfast\" Nikki called \"morning darling Ryan.\" Ryan smiled at the comment and sat down to eat as the kids came down as well. \"How did you all sleep?\" Nikki asked. \"We slept just fine\" Cam said sitting down \"Do we have any family plans today?\" \"Not that I know of\" Nikki said as she sat down to eat. \"Except for the photo that you didn't want me to forget\" Ryan said smiling \"And to make a family movie if everyone wants to.\" \"Right\" Nikki said \"would you be willing to do it?\" \"Sure\" Cam and Garrett said together \"Could Tracy do it too?\" Cam asked. \"Ryan what do you say?\" Nikki asked. \"If he wants to\" Ryan said smiling. \"I think it would be good\" Nikki said \"Cam go ask him please.\" \"I'll do that\" Cam said as she finished eating. \"Be careful and be safe\" Nikki said. \"Always\" Cam said as she went to see Tracy. Nikki went to see her mom now. \"Mom we are going to do a family photo and a family video are you up to it?\" \"I will do the photo but I think I will just watch the movie\" She said softly. \"Ok mom\" Nikki said as she went to tell Ryan about her mom. \"So what did your mom say?\" Ryan asked. \"She said that she would do the photo but she would watch the movie\" Nikki said. \"Alright\" Ryan said \"What sort of movie should we do?\" \"I am not sure\" Nikki said. \"I think a monster movie would hit home to much so how about we do like a drama\" Ryan said. \"That would work\" Nikki said. \"Do you want to be the heroine?\" Ryan asked smiling \"Or make one the kids play the lead role?\" \"Let Garrett take the lead role\" Nikki said \"he does play a lot with his action figures.\" \"I didn't think of that\" Ryan said smiling \"That would be funny, it be easiest to make it a silent film though so the parts aren't hard and its just for fun anyway.\" \"True\" Nikki said \"I like that idea.\" \"That way I don't have to have you guys memorize lines or anything and it would be easier to film\" Ryan said. \"Lets do the photo first\" Nikki said \"since it would be easier.\" \"I was going to\" Ryan said \"but first we have to wait for Cam you know.\" \"I know that\" Nikki said \"right now I am going to change.\" \"What sort of outfit you thinking of using?\" Ryan asked as he watchedv her pick through her clothes. \"Something comfortable\" Nikki said. As she was going through her clothes she found her dress. She laid it aside and then found out her outfit she was going to use. \"That looks like it will work pretty good\" Ryan said smiling at the soft outfit she had picked out. \"Thank you\" Nikki said as she was getting dressed. \"So you want to play the role of the bad guy?\" Ryan asked smiling. \"I don't know\" Nikki said \"are we going to have a princess or a damsel in distress?\" \"With Garrett being the hero why not he come to rescue a princess?\" Ryan said \"Cam would the be the best one for that, due to age and everything. And so that it doesn't look strange we can have Garrett in his wolf form the whole time.\" \"I will play the wicked mother\" Nikki said \"and what do we do for Tracy?\" \"We could make him a flunky I guess or maybe someone to help Garrett\" Ryan said. \"Lets have him with Garrett\" Nikki said. \"Alright\" Ryan said \"Sounds like a plan. All we are really going to film is a battle scene that way its short. But if everyone has fun we will make more.\" \"Ok\" Nikki said as she finished dressing. Ryan and Nikki then walked back downstairs to see Cam coming back with Tracy. \"Hello Tracy\" Nikki said \"Its good to see you again. \"Cam told me something about a movie?\" Tracy asked softly. \"Yes we are\" Nikki said \"would you also like to be in our family photo?\" \"Well I guess that wouldn't hurt\" Tracy said \"You said you considered me family.\" \"True but I was just making sure\" Nikki said as everyone was getting ready for the photo. \"After we do this we will talk about the video first before we do it.\" \"Good idea\" Ryan said setting up his camera as everyone else prepared to have their picture taken. Nikki had went to sit by her mom. Once everyone was in position and Ryan had the camera set to take the picture in a few seconds he went to lean next to Nikki. Everyone said cheese and the camera flashed as it took the picture. \"Thank you honey\" Nikki said \"now lets go over how we are going to do the movie.\" \"Right\" Ryan said describing that the movie was going to be a silent film and that Garrett in his wolf form was going to play the part of the hero. He was going to try to save Cam, playing the part of the damsel in distress from the evil queen's castle, the queen was going to be Nikki and Tracy was to be the young man helping The Beast, Garrett, save her. \"What do you guys think?\" Nikki asked. \"Sounds like it could be fun\" Garrett said smiling \"I get to be a hero.\" \"I like that\" Cam said \"I get to be a princess.\" \"Sounds like it could be fun\" Tracy said softly \"And at least we don't have to memorize lines.\" \"True\" Cam said as they all went to change. \"Cam would you come with me?\" Nikki asked. \"Sure\" Cam said following her mom. Nikki took Cam into her's and Ryan's room. \"Cam I would like you to wear this\" Nikki said handing Cam her wedding dress. \"Your wedding dress?\" Cam asked surprised as she remembered when her mom and her had picked it out \"I will but why?\" \"I think it would make a great princess dress\" Nikki said. \"Well it does work\" Cam said smiling \"Sure mom, if it fits.\" \"Lets try it on now please\" Nikki said. \"Alright\" Cam said as she slowly began to slip the dress on. It fit but just barely, Cam was a little bit smaller around the middle then her mom. Nikki looked around to see if she had some ribbon she could put on it as a belt. She found a small red ribbon that would work perfectly. \"Lets try this\" Nikki said as she had placed the ribbon on Cam and tied it. \"You look fabulous\" Nikki said admiring her daughter in her dress. \"Thanks mom\" Cam said smiling \"We ready?\" \"Not yet\" Nikki said as she pulled out her dress she was using. She slid the dress on now. \"How do I look?\" Nikki asked. \"Super evil mom\" Cam said smiling playfully. \"Thanks Cam\" Nikki said as her and Cam walked down the steps now. \"You two look great\" Ryan said as he showed them the kind of outfit that Tracy would be wearing. Cam wasn't going to say anything but she loved the way her father's dress clothes looked on Tracy. \"Wow Tracy you look amazing\" Nikki said \"also where do we want to do this movie?\" \"It would probably be good to do the first shots outside near the woods\" Ryan said \"And then the rest will be in the basement.\" \"That works\" Nikki said. \"Well Nikki hon you can watch from the sidelines for a while\" Ryan said \"You and Cam's scene will be in the basement. Right now the boys need to come with me outside.\" \"Ok\" Nikki said. Her and Cam had stayed inside and watched as the boys filmed outside. Nikki saw that Ryan had Garrett go into his wolf form before the shoot and the two did the moves that Ryan told them to do from the outside making motions and moving quickly. It wasn't long before Ryan stopped filming and came back to the house. \"On to the basement\" He said loudly as a director would. \"Ok\" Nikki said as her and Cam went first down the steps. They entered the basement. \"Alright\" Ryan said \"Now be gentle but make sure it doesn't look that way honey and pin little Cam against the wall.\" \"Ok\" Nikki said as she did so. Ryan filmed the scene and then made sure that it seemed like Garrett had busted through the wall with all the rubble he had placed to the side. Nikki continued to act. She even tried to stop Garrett from saving Cam. Ryan made sure that Nikki wasn't hurt when Garrett knocked her away and he seemed to pull Cam off of the wall even though she was never really stuck to it. Ryan had just made sure that it appeared that way. Tracy then came on the scene and got really close to Cam. Cam hugged both of the boys to thank them from saving her. Nikki was ok and she got up and went to grab Cam again trying to keep the boys from having her. Garrett knocked her away again. \"Your defeated hon\" Ryan said smiling at Nikki as the boys and Cam walked out of the basement 'Dungeon.' Nikki was happy now and she was glad that the family had fun. \"That was great guys\" Nikki said. \"You did a good job too mom\" Garrett said as he was shifted back now. \"Thank you Garrett\" Nikki said \"you made a great hero and so did you Tracy and Cam made a great princess.\" \"Now it will just take me some time to edit the tape as needed, add the text and whatnot and we should be good to go\" Ryan said smiling. \"I am glad we got to do that\" Nikki said. \"It should turn out good too\" Garrett said happily. \"I hope so\" Nikki said. It wasn't long before Ryan had the movie and photo both finished and he brought them to everyone for them to look at. \"Wow everything turned out amazing\" Nikki said \"especially the video.\" \"Looks like we got ourselves a hit silent film\" Ryan said smiling \"Even though the story was pretty simple.\" \"It looks that way\" Nikki said \"and I am glad we got it too.\" Nikki then looked at her mom \"What do you think of all this mom?\" She asked. \"You guys did a great job\" Nikki's mom said smiling. It was just starting to get dark outside now. \"I guess I need to head home now\" Tracy said softly \"That was a good movie though.\" \"How about I lead you out?\" Cam asked. \"If you want to\" Tracy said softly. Ryan smiled as they walked outside. \"Your family likes me don't they?\" Tracy asked softly turning to her now. \"Yes they do\" Cam said as she was leaning in for the kiss. Tracy was surprised that she was ready for the kiss now but smiled and took the offered kiss. Cam was glad to have her first real kiss. A few years later Cam and Tracy were married and Cam had used her mother's gown Garrett found him a girlfriend and Nikki's mom had passed away peacefully. ","Summary":" One day a girl named Nikki was out in the woods because that is where she lived because she was a L"},{"Movie":"Blood and Chocolate","Title":"Who You Are","Author":"LoveStoryMermaid","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7490058","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Disclaimer: I do not own any of the characters AN: This is based off the movie version. If you don't like the movie pairings/plot, don't read this. I have seen both the movie and read the book and are aware they are very different. I happen to have seen the movie first, though, and got the idea of Aiden and Vivian stuck in my mind with Gabriel as the bad guy. Once again, I know it's just about the opposite in the book, but this is off the movie. Hope you enjoy. Who You Are Aiden was smiling as he stared at her, chopping up cucumber for dinner's salad, her blond hair pulled up in a bun, some strands falling loose. Sometimes it seemed next to impossible to him that he was here with her, a loupguru. That itself would have been enough, but especially with everything they'd been through. They had been in Paris now for three weeks, away from her \"family,\" and completely, effortlessly, happy. He was supposed to be putting the homemade rolls in the oven, and was just about to boyishly toss flour at her. \"Dammit!\" That idea suddenly went out of his head. Vivian didn't usually curse unless something was really bothering her. He turned to her, the smile fading from his face, \"What's wrong?\" Vivian laughed wryly, probably remembering the previous times a couple weeks ago he'd asked the same question, but she still wouldn't look at him as she answered bitterly, \"I cut myself.\" So that was the problem, on top of the obvious, though their knives were steel, not silver. His expression softened as he slowly went over to her, and gently placed a hand on her shoulder, turned away from him, but she didn't pull away as he said, \"You know I trust you. Look at me.\" Slowly, she turned around, but still didn't say anything, only flickering a glance for a moment, ashamed and embarrassed. Aiden brought his hand to her face, looking at her yellow eyes, brushing the stray blonde hairs aside, \"These eyes are beautiful, and they're part of who you are.\" Slowly, he leaned toward her and she allowed her lips to meet his, pulling him close, wrapping her arms around his back. When she pulled back, her eyes were back to their normal soft brown. She looked at him with a weak smile. \"You control who you are,\" he told her, \"When are you going to stop being afraid of it?\" She looked at him sharply, \"When are you going to stop running? From your father. We all have things we don't want to face,\" she gentled, \"Eventually, we all have to. One day, I may have to go back and face what we've left.\" For a moment he was caught off guard, but thinking about, \"Maybe you're right.\" She smiled a bit and nodded to the abandoned tray of bread, \"Aren't you supposed to have put those rolls in?\" A short while later it was Vivian who was staring. She couldn't understand how he trusted her so completely; she certainly didn't, but she also wasn't complaining. He did understand when she really needed to be alone. And they had a perfect home here, surrounded by sparse woods, not too far from Montmartre, the art center of Paris. In fact, they were planning on going tomorrow, but for now she called, \"Dinner's ready,\" served herself some salad and bread, and went to steal his spot on the sofa. \"Hey,\" he called, laughing, as he came back over with his plate, \"That was my spot.\" Vivian just shrugged, smiling. She was up before him, the next day, as usual. She slipped quietly out of bed, looking out their window. It would be a gorgeous late summer day, the sun was already shining. She went to put on a pot of coffee before slipping on her favorite brown sundress and letting her hair fall down. By the time the coffee was ready, Aiden was up. \"Still going to Montmartre today?\" she asked. He looked out the window, \"And not take advantage of the gorgeous weather? Of course we're still going, as long as you still want to.\" She smiled in response. Within the hour, they were shopping in Montmarte, strolling the blue, white, and red umbrella lined streets, stopping frequently to look at the artwork. At one corner, though, their attentions were diverted. Vivian saw a clothing booth and a little farther down across the street Aiden saw a food shack. Vivian noticed, smiled, and suggested, \"Why don't you go pick something out to eat while I look at clothes.\" He laughed, \"Sounds good to me. Feel like anything in particular?\" \"Surprise me.\"[Chapter 2] \"Surprise me.\" She was just leaving the shop, a couple purchases in hand, when she turned around on instinct. Sure enough there was a group of guys approaching her. There were only two reasons people she didn't know came up to her: either they were hoping to flirt or they were loupguru. The first didn't happen often and she could tell this group was not loupguru. Without thinking, she had backed up and away from the shop. Unfortunately, that put her up against a black iron fence lining the walkway. Maybe she was just overreacting, but the same instincts that had made her turn around and back up, told her she wasn't. She wanted these men to leave her be. It was then that one of the guys advanced up to her, pulling her close and holding up a knife before she could react, \"Don't be like that. We just wanted to say hello.\" Aiden had just ordered a couple of hotdogs and was walking back over, wondering where Vivian had gone, when he found her, surrounded, \"Shit,\" he left the hotdogs where they were and hurried up to the group, \"You fellows have a problem?\" Not thinking, Vivian had been looking in the opposite direction for Aiden and turned her head when she heard him and took a sharp breath, falling back against the gate and shutting her eyes, frozen with fear. Aiden saw it and saw her shaking, she'd already been too worked up. Half of his initial anger changing and put aside, he yelled, \"Don't you know better than to corner people, and to show others respect!\" Among trying to gain control over the animal inside her, which had already been scared and cornered, was now injured, she could make out Aiden trying to help, but he didn't always think when it came to helping her and she whispered, strained, pleading, though not sure for what, \"Aiden.\" Between the surprise of actually having cut her and the change in her voice and the appearance of Aiden, the guys were surprised enough to lose their guard, backing up a bit only to let Aiden shove them apart, calling to her, \"Go!\" She didn't think twice as she ran out of the corner and out of the square. For a fleeting second she was worried for Aiden's safety, but the animal inside of her wouldn't let her focus on that. Apparently, they weren't as interested in Aiden as they were Vivian, as they man who'd been shoved, shoved Aiden back, but then made to run after Vivian. Trying to control his own temper, Aiden called, \"Unless you have a death wish, I'd leave her alone!\" At that they stopped, and the guy he'd shoved turned around, sneering, \"And who are you? Her little boyfriend?\" Maybe he should let them go, try and run into her now, by now she'd have changed, and get what they deserve. It was people like these that made her kind so hateful and afraid of the rest of humanity. Then, though, one of the others called, \"Gastov, elle est partie. L'amusement est fini. Il n'est rien et nous voulons éviter le problème.\" Knowing enough French to understand that one of them was saying to back off since she was gone and they didn't want trouble, Aiden was confused. First off, they had been the ones causing trouble and second, they didn't seem the type to back off. He followed their gaze and smirked. A police officer not too far away was starting to look interested. Gastov also followed the others' gaze and agreed, walking away, but not without calling, \"Better watch over that girl of yours, boy.\" Aiden balled up his fist, but let it go, shaking his head. It was then that he noticed the bags on the ground. If he had to guess, it was Vivian's. The purse definitely was hers, and he smiled a moment when he checked the shopping. The black top and green knit hat was just her style, along with a red sweater cut for a guy and there was the painting of wolves they had bought earlier. He looked around to see if she can tell where she'd gone, but it's impossible. Though, if he had to guess, she'd most likely acted on instinct, thus run to the woods and was more likely to be headed home than back to the square in either form, so he decided to head home, taking a back road through the woods. Sure enough, driving back Aiden stopped the car. He'd thought he'd seen a glimpse of white through the trees. Confirming his suspicions, the white form slowed down, and came a little closer to the car so that he could tell for certain it was a wolf. There was only one wolf in the world that would approach a car like that. It wasn't long to stop though, as she looked at him for a moment, before dipping her head once and then running off again. Aiden took a breath and nodded to himself at that. He knew what she was telling him, that she'd be okay and to head home. When he got home, he looked around, called, \"Vivian?\" She could have beaten him back to the house, but he wasn't all that surprised to find that she apparently hadn't tried to. He went to the counter, pulling the red sweater, green knit hat and and artwork out of it. The black top he left in, though and went to grab shoes and a pair of jeans that he put in with the top. He picked the bag up and went outside and looked around. He wasn't surprised to still not see her anywhere. Still haunted from her parents, whenever she went for a run, she never changes too close to the house, so he walked into the woods a distance until he couldn't see the house, but still knows his way back and left the bag on the ground. Vivian had heard a car coming and while she wasn't close enough to the road to be concerned, she didn't feel like she needed to be. In fact, she thought she might want this car to see her. She'd been right. She hadn't really had time to think how to let Aiden know where she'd go, but she'd figured he could guess and she'd been right. It was his grey car she saw coming up the road. She paused just long enough to let him know it was her, she was fine, and that he should go home. She'd be there soon enough. She'd had time to calm down now and could think again. She turned to look back the way she had come. She'd managed to get her dress off so it wouldn't be lost when she changed, but now it was lying abandoned at the edge of the woods. To get it, she'd have to go all the way back. As she didn't feel like walking that whole distance back on two feet, she'd have to carry the dress back between her teeth, which she also didn't find that appealing. Well, she figured, then, that not too many people would come across it, and those who did would leave it, so she'd go back for it in the car later. For now, she supposed she should head home. Aiden was probably worried. Having run primarily on pure instinct up until know, she let herself relax and truly enjoy and experience the world through wolf sense, the sharp smell of the fresh woods and the sound of all the animals running around, sensing her presence. She let herself enjoy the run, the power, the speed, the smoothness of it all, the cool dirt and soft pine needles beneath her paws. So that when she saw a bag in the distance she actually barked in laughter, surprise and thanks. It was the shopping and she had an idea of what was in it and who'd left it. After all, she was starting to get close to the house and he knew her. She smiled at the memory of the first time she'd ran out in a temper, not thinking and so changing in her clothes and coming back to the house later, trying to sneak in the back way so as not to surprise him. If they change in their clothes, the clothes disappear, not being part of the loupguru, so she'd come back to the house in the same non-attire as Aiden had found her a couple weeks back in Bucharest. The only thing was, he'd been out on the back porch! He'd made some surprised cry, run inside, and a moment later had tossed a robe out the window. Always the gentleman. After checking to be sure no one was around, she let herself change back and into the clothes Aiden had left her and walked back to the house. She paused a moment outside, before entering through the brown front door. She could tell he'd been waiting on the barstool, by the counter, when she walked in and he'd immediately turned around. He'd seen her coming through the glass windows, but had decided to let her come in on her own time; she could take care of herself and he thought it best at the moment. He turned around when he heard the door open and she walked in, not quite elated like she usually was after a run, but seeming to be alright, but he was still worried, \"Hey.\" She smiled gently, \"Thanks.\" He knew she meant more than just the clothes and answered, \"Sure. I know you don't like to change real close to the house and thought you might want them.\" \"Yeah, I'll have to go back for my dress later.\" He allowed himself a small smile before asking, \"You okay?\" She frowned as she looked at him, \"Gabriel would have had them killed,\" she paused a moment, \"I won't, of course, but, I, I don't know what I would have done if you hadn't showed up when you did. No matter what I want or try to think, you can't corner an animal. Instincts take over.\" Aiden just asked, \"I know. You're cut?\" She knew what he was really asking and shook her head, \"It's only critical when we're wolf. If anything, I'll just be a little more tired than usual today and tomorrow morning, but I'm alright.\" Aiden went up to hug her and she returned it, reveling in the security he brought to her life. Pulling away, she said, \"You know, I didn't just mean today when I said thanks. Also thanks for still trusting me and more.\" Aiden nodded, \"I know, but there's no need. I always have,\" he let himself smile, \"After all, loupguru aren't monsters, but the best of man, best of beast. Right?\" She laughed, \"Right\" and kissed him before settling down on the couch and turning on the television.

In fact, she was more than pretty. She was hot. With a capital H. He smirked as she danced with the other young men and patiently waited for his turn. The music pulsed through her body. She laughed with exhilaration. This place she had reached, this musical oblivion that shattered all worries for a few moments was heaven on earth. Scarlett moved away from the young man and slid into rhythm with the next one. She was slowly making her way across the dance floor and to the bar. Glancing up, she noticed that one more move would have her out of the crowd; and then she saw him. His pale skin was framed by his ragged pale brown hair but it was his eyes that – for a moment – rocked her composure. Silver. They were silver and Scarlett had seen silver eyes only once before – werewolves. Her sea green eyes finally noticed him and he smirked again. She moved easily away from her current dance partner and headed over towards him. He ran a casual hand through his wavy hair and heard the wolf-whistles from his friends behind him. The girl strolled over to him and then brushed past; but the heat of her breath warmed his ear as she whispered, \"Bar.\" He smiled to himself and then followed her, his friends tagged along. Scarlett knew that he had no idea who she was and that suited her perfectly; transformers and werewolves rarely got along at the best of times...rarely. \"Rafe.\" He said and Scarlett laughed. Her honey tones filled the air as she chuckled, \"Suits you. Sounds like a little dogs bark 'Rafe, Rafe'.\" A laugh behind her called her attention away from Rafe and to a girl behind her. One glance at the girl's long blonde hair and silver grey eyes triggered the reaction in Scarlett, \"Vivienne!\" She said warmly. \"Scarlett!\" They embraced like old friends as Scarlett remembered how Vivienne was the only lupe-garrou she actually liked. \"Ah-hem.\" Rafe cleared his throat and the girls turned to him, \"I see you know my cousin then...Scarlett.\" Scarlett smiled at the young, arrogant werewolf before her, \"Oh, I know a lot more than that.\"[Chapter 2] He was stunned. Gobsmacked. He then became angry – furious. \"What the HELL have you been telling her. How many others have you told? Just wait until Gabriel hears of this.\" Scarlett cleared her throat, \"Let's take this somewhere a little more...private, shall we?\" Rafe looked at her in shock; didn't she know she was the dinner at the next hunt? Stood in a dark alleyway, the heated air stifling her lungs and the werewolves surrounding her, Scarlett began to worry slightly. After all, Vivienne was the only wolf who got along with her. \"What do you know then, little girl.\" There he goes again. She thought, cocky as usual. \"You really have no idea who I am, do you?\" She asked. Vivenne's expression was a mixture of startled and smug; she knew what Scarlett would do but she hadn't expected Rafe to over-react so much. \"You, my dear, are a pretty young woman who knows far more than she should.\" Scarlett laughed, \"Pretty, yes, young, in a way. I am Scarlett Feigel, I am twenty years of age, I possess the knowledge of several centuries and I am a transformer.\" Silence greeted her statement and she looked directly at Rafe, \"Don't believe me puppy dog?\" Her sea green eyes flashed silver for a moment and then the young woman was gone and an eagle stood in her place. \"Holy Shit!\" Willem yelled, backing away. The eagle transformed back into Scarlett who looked at Willem with undisguised disgust, \"Watch your language young man! You may be a dog but even dogs don't swear unnecessarily.\" Rafe was looking at Scarlett with confusion; she didn't look like a transformer – she was too tidy, too neat they were always rather tatty – she didn't smell like a transformer, she smelt profoundly human and not like any animal she could spend her time as – and she certainly didn't sound like a transformer, she was too confident and eloquent. Rafe didn't know what to do, that much was obvious. \"Ah-hem, Scarlett Feigel – know the name?\" Rafe again looked frustratedly confused and Scarlett turned to her friend, \"Who's your alpha now then?\" \"Gabriel.\" Scarlett nodded, \"Make sense, that means I'm not offered your pretty protection then – different alpha – different pack – different rules.\" \"I should get going off your territory then. Besides, I need to hunt soon.\" She breezed up to the blonde friend who smiled. Rafe watched as Scarlett pressed her lips against those of his cousin and he knew there was more going on than anyone understood. Vivienne kissed back for a fleeting instant before Scarlett moved on. She stood before Rafe and smirked, knowing how she looked in the short red dress and long brown hair, \"Come on little doggy.\" Rafe growled – actually growled! She laughed, \"finally adjusting to the situation? There's a good boy.\" \"Get out of here – vermin!\" Scarlett laughed again before lowering her voice seductively, \"Bite me!\"[Chapter 3] And bite her he did. Or he tried to. Before his elongated canines could sink into the seductively pale flesh Scarlett shifted. Suddenly, an eagle was hovering three feet above his head. It called harshly and he shivered. A memory flashed into his mind; He was young. Three perhaps, four? He had just eaten his first ever kill. He was brimming with pride. He had killed a rabbit! A rabbit! All on his own. He howled with happiness. His young eyes spotted a golden eagle perched high on a branch above him. The eagle looked at him and he shivered, changed back into his human form. He turned to run, over-flowing with energy from his meal. There was an aura about that eagle that ordered him away. His instincts screamed at him. He took one step and stopped. A voice called to him from above. A girl's voice. \" You killed my sister.\" Was all she said and as he looked up the eagle took off and flew into the rising sun. Rafe looked at the eagle above him, \"I didn't know.\" He whispered. His friends looked at him in horror, wondering if their wanna be little alpha had gone crazy. \"I thought she was just a rabbit.\" Scarlett was on her feet again now, standing all fire and desire before him, \"Of course you did dear.\" She hissed, her voice raking through his mind like talons. \"I won't hurt you, little puppy.\" She smirked, \"not yet anyway. It would hurt someone I care for too much.\" She brushed a cold finger across his cheek, \"but watch your back little dog. One day the moon will not rise to save you and I will bring my revenge to your door.\" She turned and took Vivienne's hand smiling warmly. \"We\" she said seductively, \"have a lot of catching up to do.\" And Rafe watched sickly as his cousin smiled like a little girl when Scarlett's hand drifted from her wrist to the partition of her legs. \"My place or yours?\" The blonde girl asked. Scarlett paused, \"Mine...then away for a while; I really must leave your territory by morning.\" Viv laughed, \"Of course, your place it is.\" Rafe watched with a sickening dread of silence as a cloud of fearful anticipation of the day revenge would descend closed upon him. As the girls sashayed out of the alleyway and his friends made ridiculous comments, he tried not to imagine the sordid things his cousin would get up to that night...with a cursed filthy transformer!

He quietly reached for her forehead to feel if maybe a fever or such could be the cause of that. Kate's bright sapphire eyes suddenly opened into the shadows of the early Tuesday daylight, and even before he could say anything about it, she had already gotten up, having pushed the sheets aside hastily – and had run into the direction of their interconnected little bathroom. Harvey quietly raised. \"Kate?\" He voiced; nearly immediately getting a consecution of gagging, retching sounds in return… Maybe it could be an illness nonetheless? Wednesday Harvey could feel her writhe beside him again; uneasily tossing, and turning, much like the previous couple of nights. \"Kate? Sweetie?\" She hastily kicked aside her covers, not giving him much of a chance to respond, before running then disappearing into the bathroom. Harvey rather worriedly rose off the bed. He quietly listened to the sound of his companion throwing up again, worry rising even higher. Harvey intuitively moved to go check up on her, right when he could hear their toilet upstairs being flushed, soon followed by her weakly shuffling back into the bedroom. He could feel her shiver lightly when curling up in bed beside him again. Harvey's left hand moved to lay lovingly around her waist. She, however, pushed it away again. \"I'm sorry,\" she whispered, feebly wiping her tears off at the corner of her pillow. Harvey's brow furrowed in even deeper worry. \"Sweetie, maybe you could better take a day off tomorrow. You haven't been feeling that well for days.\" \"I can't,\" she whimpered, in that luscious but tired English utterance. \"Oonagh's been sick, too… I'm sure that it'll be over very soon.\" \"I hope,\" Harvey sighed. Kate's eyes meticulously ran over the piece of paper that had come with the test. She had done this only once before, and that actually had been thirty years ago. These tests had improved… She suddenly heard their door falling shut, and hastily gathered everything, getting up, and hiding it behind their Senseo only barely in time. \"Honey, I'm home!\" Harvey frowned, upon seeing her leaning against their grayish kitchen counter so awkwardly, as if hiding something behind her back. \"Sweetie…?\" He whispered, quietly nearing, eyes nearly immediately catching a little white and blue box with fuchsia behind the Senseo. He quietly reached for it, at once noticing her biting her lip. Harvey passively read what was upon the box. \"Sweetie, is this what I…?\" Kate nodded. \"You haven't…?\" Kate's head quietly nodded back and forth in denial. That's when she really couldn't contain her tears anymore. \"I easily recognized…\" she uttered. \"I have been here before already,\" she whimpered, in tears. \"I'm not really supposed to be having a baby anymore at this age…\" \"Shh…\" \"Kate? Sweetie?\" Harvey's concerned voice sounded through the locked bathroom door. Kate Walker's bright blue eyes remained upon the test, while unlocking, and quietly directing her gaze to Harvey's, only handing him the test to check for himself. Harvey carefully hugged her in happiness upon finding it positive. \"I surely wouldn't have guessed that I would be into diapers again at this age anymore, but… I would be happy to take care of you, and him or her, if you would be choosing to go through with this, though.\" Harvey's eyes connected with hers seriously. She didn't have to think about that much longer than that. She nodded, before tearing up of happiness.

The innumerous constant beeping noises around her made Kate feel as if something inside her head soon was going to explode – or maybe already had. Harvey was here now, though. She ignored all the discomfort and tried to smile up at him as he lovingly held her hand. He had gotten more wrinkly than the day that the two of them met. He had gotten old. So had she as well, though, for she wouldn't have been lying there in that abnormally white environment if she hadn't. It mostly resembled a hospital. It even smelled like one. Kate seemed to have gotten less wrinkly than him, but her not so young body seemed to have had more trouble with aging. Harvey and she had met at a moment in both their lives when the need to settle down had replaced the need to experiment and live wild. And today, after thirty-two years together with him, she could truthfully say that meeting him and giving him her trust and love must have been the best thing ever happened to her. Kate was about to be seventy-nine in December. Harvey had already swiftly passed ninety, but even though all of the hair that he still had left, had slowly gotten white and even though most of his skin had loosened more in wrinkles than before, he still hadn't lost his humor, nor his always good health. She had, and thus as a consequence they had both been forced into the local care center to mainly await the end of her days together. Maybe that sounded quite cruel, but it wasn't any less true. He couldn't take care of her. She would go before him. Kate could feel herself getting more unable to hold onto life each day; she could feel herself slip away. Harvey often enough told her that before she even realized, she would find herself cured, and would oh so easily reach hundred-fifty. She couldn't believe him on that, for she felt herself nearing the white, bright light more each day. It called for her, and she well understood that it wouldn't just let her go, but that it would call louder until she had joined it in the life after death. Kate had thought about life and death, and possible life after death very often. It had intrigued her in a way. Would you really quit thinking when you died? Would you be able to understand that you were no longer alive? Would you remember who you loved, and who loved you back in life? Would you really go to Heaven if you had been good, and instead go to Hell if you hadn't, like some thought to be true? Would you return in another form? Would you realize having lived already? Would you recall anything from that other life you had lead, but lost? Would anyone recall her after dying? Would her name still live after hundred years? Kate often thought about it, and at some moments, thinking and not understanding could make her start crying in frustration. It might seem really odd, but if she really started thinking about it so intensely, especially now she felt Death's breathing upon her. Death be not proud, though some have called thee , Kate often recited within herself; first line of one of the many metaphysical poems of John Donne. She must have heard it at least once in English Literature lectures, of which she had actually followed quite a lot. She couldn't rightly attribute either time or environment with it anymore, but found herself repeating it within nevertheless. Yet she never told him about it, or Susan, who often came to visit them both: her old white haired father and her, Harvey's second spouse. She never told Elinor either… their daughter and only child. The now old couple had gotten little Elinor when she had turned forty-three, fulfilling Kate's deepest wishes. She would no longer have to worry about that baby she hadn't had, when Elinor had come along. She would no longer have to guess about whether a child of hers would be funny or smart. Elinor had soon shown to be both, the obvious funny part most likely inherited from her father's side. And the smart part could have well come from both. Elinor's parents had tried for another child soon. Kate had found herself pregnant again when she had been just a few months old, but it had ended in miscarriage at eleven weeks. Harvey and she had tried again, but success hadn't occurred, and then menopause had come along at forty-six, confirming that Elinor would remain alone. Another child would have been very welcome, but that didn't mean that Harvey Shine's family would always feel unhappy and incomplete. \"How could I forget, ever?\" Harvey's voice sounded. \"I recall being very rude.\" She chuckled weakly, numerous plastic tubes running to and away from her preventing Kate from doing anything that included much movement or effort. Gentle raps came to the chalky white bedroom – by lack of another fitting word – door, and both seniors could hear their daughter's voice in the hallway. She soon walked in with little Whyatt half asleep on one hip, Arthur almost immediately running towards their grandfather and jumping on his lap, followed by twin sister Arielle. Kate secretly suspected Elinor having told both twins to please save their grandmother, who was so ill. Elinor swiftly leaned down to peck her father's forehead, then moved towards the bed to greet her mother. Kate smiled calmly, seeing Wyatt now completely asleep on his mother's shoulder. \"How are you doing, Mama?\" Elinor questioned, looking at the number of tubes suspiciously. Each time she visited, there seemed to be more. \"I'm fine, Ellie.\" \"Isn't Howard with you?\" Harvey suddenly questioned, looking up at his daughter. Elinor's head shook in denial. \"No. He would have surely liked to, but a Bob from work called him this morning. Apparently, Howard had to go immediately to solve some unforeseen trouble,\" she said, privately rolling her eyes. \"He does give you both his best, though.\" Kate of course enjoyed the visits of her daughter and grandchildren especially, but each time that Ellie and offspring left, she felt relieved as well. Kate slowly started feeling more exhausted after each visit, all hyperactivity bouncing off her granddaughter and grandsons – in particularly Arielle's twin – seeming to moderately decrease her well-being. Today hadn't been different at all. Harvey concernedly eyed her. Kate's breathing seemed to be more labored than usual. She hadn't really opened her eyes since they had fallen shut just a couple of minutes after Elinor had left. He understood. He tried hard to make her happy every day again, just like in the beginning of their marriage. It had surely become a bit harder now, though… and he truly understood how weak she had slowly become, and how the more harder Kate had to fight every single day again just to live; something that appeared so simple and even unconscious for others. She would quit breathing soon. Both Kate and he understood. He quietly looked at her frail, blank hand. It felt rather cold to him – much colder than usual. Kate's raspy breathing sounds slowly died away. Harvey looked up to see her eyelids flutter, then still. She must have left the living to go where he couldn't find her. His own brown eyes batted down without a word, and Harvey tenderly stroked her cold, lifeless hand against his cheek one last time, tears rolling down his cheek. \"I truly hope angels may sing you to eternal rest,\" he whispered. Without Kate, Harvey's tenacity to live had been drained. No food still appeared to have taste at all. No happiness would come across his lips anymore or shine within his eyes, until joining her in Heaven three days later, where no single sign of senescence would bother them anymore; where nothing could take them both so far away from one other ever again.

I would have loved to be there when you woke, but unfortunately I had to go down to the store. I'll be back by lunch. Love, Harvey He's such a dear man, thought Kate. She moved to the stove, putting the water on and feeling a mug with hot cocoa powder. Just as the kettle whistled, Harvey came bounding through the door. \"Kate! I'm back!\" He shouted. \"In the kitchen!\" She shouted back. Harvey walked in as she was pouring the water. He kissed her shoulder and wrapped his arms around her waist. Kate laughed. She twisted in his arms and kissed him, saying, \"Where've you been all day?\" Harvey smiled mischievously and said, \"Close your eyes and I'll show you.\" Kate closed her eyes, and the next thing she knew she was being blindfolded. She attempted to lift it, but Harvey stopped her hands. She sighed, but let her hands all to her side. Harvey led her out the door and down the steps to a waiting car. \"Where are we going?\" Kate said. \"You'll find out soon enough. Driver, could you take us here?\" Kate heard Harvey pull out a slip of paper. Soon the taxi was pulling away. Kate sighed. Harvey took her hand in his and squeezed it. She squeezed back. Kate was sure Harvey was smiling. Leaning her head on his shoulder, Kate smiled. Harvey kissed the top of her head and commented, \"You're certainly snuggly today.\" Kate hummed her agreement and said dreamily, \"Shut up, Harvey.\" Harvey laughed just as the cab pulled over. Kate could hear the sounds of children laughing, people talking, and though it all seemed dreadfully familiar, she couldn't quite place it. Harvey paid the driver and led Kate out of the car. Taking her arm in his, he led her along a walk. They seemed to go for a while before he had her sit down. There was a scraping as Harvey pulled a chair up next to her. \"Go ahead, then.\" He said. Kate whipped off the blindfold to find herself facing the fountains. Children sat on the streams of water, and people rushed back and forth. She looked over to Harvey to find a huge grin on his face. He whispered, \"Do you remember this place?\" The clock tower began to sound noon. Kate nodded, \"Of course. The fountains at noon.\" Harvey nodded. He pulled out a small velvet box. Kate gasped, already guessing what it held. \"Oh Harvey, I don't know if that's a good idea. I mean, I'm cruel and cantankerous and-\" Kate was speechless when Harvey opened it to reveal a ring. A silver band with a large sapphire in the middle, flanked by two smaller diamonds lay nestled in the velvet. \"Kate Walker. Cantankerous Kate Walker. Will you marry me?\" Kate flushed a deep red, and Harvey smiled. She gulped and said, \"Crazy Harvey Shine. Yes, I will marry you; I will be your wife.\" Harvey grinned at her and they kissed.

If I did, however, there'd already be a sequel to the movie. And possibly a book, too! Date Crashing Sitting at the children's table during the toast was a little odd for Kate. After all, she and Harvey were the only ones with drinks to toast with. The whole situation was a little awkward, really. When they first arrived, Kate could feel Jean's stare on her. But it didn't bother her. Not one bit. Now, as they were eating, Kate was attempting to make conversation with the children. They all scared her just a little, they stared at them as if they were crazy when they first sat down. \"You do know this is the children's table.\" The one little girl had said. And yes, they knew. They whole time Kate was talking to Harvey or Harvey to Kate, the same small girl was staring at the two of them, her eyes dancing between one and the other. Finally, she asked Harvey, \"Is she your date?\" And she nodded at Kate. Kate nodded, and Harvey answered, \"Technically, yes.\" \"Oh.\" She seemed satisfied with the answer, until she wondered, \"Are you his wife?\" Kate smiled, but shook her head, \"No. We're friends.\" \"Friends?\" A little boy jumped into the conversation. \"That's right.\" Kate answered. After they finished eating, and the music started playing, they still sat. Kate and Harvey, side by side. \"Aren't you going to ask her to dance?\" The little girl asked. Harvey's eyebrows went up, and he answered, \"As a matter of fact, I am.\" He turned to Kate, \"May I have this dance?\" He asked. She smiled and nodded, and he grabbed her hand and lead her to the dance floor. As they slowly danced, he noticed her glancing between him and the door. He pulled her in close, whispering, \"Don't go.\" And after a moment, he added, \"Please.\" He felt her nod, and continued to sway. Ten minutes later, as they still danced, he leaned into her and whispered, \"I believe every man in this room is staring at you.\" \"Why? Is there something in my teeth? Oh, why didn't you tell me, Harvey?\" She asked, misunderstanding his comment. He smiled, \"There's nothing wrong. You're just beautiful.\" She blushed, but then suddenly turned sad. \"What?\" He asked. She shook her head, \"Nothing.\" \"Something.\" He replied, \"You're upset.\" \"I just.... never mind.\" She shook her head again. \"C'mon.\" He stopped dancing, grabbing her hand and dragging her out of the room, and into the hall. When he stopped suddenly and turned around, she practically ran into him. \"What is it?\" He asked, searching her eyes for an answer. She shrugged, \"It's just... This isn't real , Harvey.\" His brow furrowed, \"What do you mean? It isn't real?\" She sighed. \"I mean, this.\" She waved her hands in the air and between them, \"It isn't real.\" \"It is real.\" She shook her head, \"It isn't. You taking me to your daughter's wedding, and dancing with me, and telling me I'm beautiful. It isn't real. \" Harvey nodded, \"It is real, Kate. It is.\" She sighed, still not believing him. He grabbed her hands in both of his own. \"You want me to prove it to you? That it's real?\" She shrugged. He cupped her face with his hands, and pressed his lips to her own. It lasted only a moment, and then he pulled away. His forehead rested against hers. \"It is real.\" He sighed. \"Would you like to play a game?\" He asked suddenly, pulling his head away from hers. She looked at him, confused. \"I'll tell you something that you don't know about me, and then you tell me something I don't know about you.\" He paused, \"Ready? I want to be with you.\" She shrugged, \"I don't like grapes.\" \"I tell you I want to be with you, and you tell me you don't like grapes?\" She shrugged, \"What do you want me to say, Harvey? Let's go get married?\" Her hands flew around. He was irritating her, \"I don't know what you want me to say!\" She sighed, and walked away from him, the tears making her eyes appear glossy. \"This is me.\" She told him, turning around to him, \"I'm mean. I'm hard to be with. Which is why it's better for me to say that I dislike grapes. It's easier than saying....\" She trailed off. \"Easier than saying what?\" He asked. \"Easier than admitting that I'm scared.\" She told him tearfully, \"Of being with you.\" \"Why?\" \"Because if we start it, then it ends, I...I don't think I'll be able to go on.\" She finally admitted fully, sighing. \"It won't end.\" He promised, \"Because I feel the same way.\" He let that sink in, and then, he told her, \"I think I'm falling in love with you.\" She looked confused, and he said, \"It was my turn.\" And she broke out into the biggest smile he'd ever seen.

In transition?\" She asked, already knowing the answer. He looked at her tenderly, \"I don't think I can be without you.\" She sighed, and looked back at him with a little smile. Suddenly, he asked, \"What's your Mother doing?\" \"I-I'm not sure, really. Why do you ask?\" He shrugged, \"I'd just like to meet her, that's all.\" She smiled brightly, \"Let me call her.\" Without an answer from him, she pulled out her phone and dialed. \"Yes, hello Mum.\" (Beat.) \"Yes, I was just wondering... Well, I want you to meet someone.\" (Beat.) Harvey watched as Kate's brow furrowed in confusion. \"Well,\" She glanced at Harvey, \"I suppose so. Why?\" (Beat.) \"Well, it isn't like we're getting married, Mum! I just want you to meet the man!\" (Beat.) She sighed. \"Mum...\" (Beat.) \"Wonderful!

Lightening shot through the sky. Harvey sat at his piano, music flowing from it like rain from the sky. Kate sat on the couch, reading her book. Her pregnant belly rested on her lap. As she read, she kept an eye on Harvey. It seemed that every time the thunder sounded, he flinched for just a split second before he continued playing. She put her book down and waddled over to Harvey. Sitting down beside him, she saw that she was right. He jumped whenever he heard thunder. As his piece came to an end, she said, \"Harvey, are you afraid of thunder?\" He turned to her, confused, \"Why would you think that?\" \"You jump every time thunder goes. You look scared even now.\" Harvey shrugged, looking down at the keys on the piano. Kate laughed and said, \"It's fine, love. Come `ere.\" Harvey leaned over onto her shoulder. Kate held him closer and said, \"Harvey! You're shaking like a leaf!\" He grinned sheepishly up at her and said, \"Sorry.\" She said, \"Harvey, don't worry about it. You're just fine being afraid of lightening.\" Harvey sighed and closed his eyes. They sat like that for a few minutes, just enjoying being close to one another. Each crack of thunder brought Harvey cuddling closer to Kate. Kate's eyes widened. She grinned, then silently took Harvey's hand and put it on her belly. The baby's kicking brought a smile to Harvey's face. He leaned over until his head was lying on top Kate's belly and his legs hung off the side of the piano bench. Kate kissed him and said, \"Harvey, I love you. But do you mind if we move over to the couch? Sitting without something to support my back is killing me.\" Harvey opened his eyes and grinned. He sat up and followed Kate over to the couch. She sat down with her book, and Harvey put his head back on her belly. She attempted to read, but Harvey's puppy eyes kept interrupting her, not to mention their offspring's insistent kung fu madness. She put her book back and said, \"So, how on earth did you get to be frightened of thunder?\" \"I don't know, and I don't care. I just don't like it.\" Kate smiled and lightly smacked his face. \"Let's just hope the new Shine child doesn't share your fear.\" Harvey chuckled and sat up to kiss Kate. Thunder crashed outside and Harvey scooted closer to her. She laughed and wrapped her arms around him.

The two of them continued walking like that; she on bare feet. \"That's better,\" she sighed. \"I think you're my kind of girl,\" Harvey laughed, producing another smile upon her lips again. Kate and he walked along in quiescence, just enjoying each other's presence, taking in the fresh London air provided by the large green trees rising up on each side of them. \"Why don't you ask me those questions?\" He suddenly suggested after a few reserved moments from either one of them. \"Which ones?\" She wondered. \"You know, at the airport when I boarded.\" \"Oh, the questionnaire?\" Kate recalled. \"Yes.\" \"Ah, okay,\" Kate said, momentarily finding herself a bit taken aback by this rather odd turn in their conversation. \"Name?\" \"Harvey Shine.\" \"Place of residence?\" \"I'm in transition.\" Kate smiled, looking up at him briefly, before gently leaning her heavy head on his shoulder as they slowly continued walking through London together; much like a long married pair that had known each other for nearly all their lives and had fallen in love somewhere along the years. In fact, this odd pair had only met one another a few days back; but even though always rational Kate often enough claimed that Harvey and she didn't know a thing about each other, they did. Actually, in more ways than one, it sometimes felt like the two of them had known each other for a life time. And still, deep inside, Kate couldn't help but worry about how this was all going to work. Harvey, however, seemed to be pretty confident about their relationship, and he seemed to brush it off on her now, too. Harvey was very good at making her thoughts drift off of pondering in one way or another. Kate had been hurt one too many times in the past. Too many guys had only cared to go with her because of her loveliness, and perhaps because of her credulity. None of them had ever seemed to really care about anything else but her appearance; not her feelings or thoughts… not her hopes or wishes. As a result of that, she had come to find herself in a position where she would run whenever things started to get complicated… before things could start to get intense enough to gain that capacity of hurting her. She would go take the easy way, because it would most likely be the less painful one as well. However, in this case she couldn't quite tell whether him going back would have saved her that much pain inside. She hadn't allowed herself to think about how she would feel if Harvey went back home to America. Watching Harvey go, would have stirred her pretty much up in either circumstances, whether after a relationship of unknown time or now. However, he had promised her that it would work, and, oddly enough, she had no trouble believing him; even though a lot of things went through her mind at once at that moment. Things had already been complicated for them from the first day, yet something invisible and undetectable, but powerful seemed to connect the two of them. They had something very strange together; their major differences perhaps gluing them to each other. \"Kate?\" \"Yes, Harvey?\" \"Where are we actually going?\" \"I honestly have no idea,\" she simply answered him with a smile, briefly looking up at him again and noticing him smiling brightly as well. He sure was one of a kind. Then, without warning, he suddenly picked her up as if she was only light as a feather, making her shriek with surprise. \"I don't want your feet to get more dirty than already is the case, while we are just senselessly walking around with no idea where to go. I thought I could perhaps save your feet until we at least have a destination,\" he said, continuing to walk through London with a smile on his lips and Kate being happy in his arms. She smiled. \"Would you put me down, you old fool. I'm way too heavy.\" \"No, you're not.\" \"I am,\" Kate argued, then sighed. \"Although I don't think arguing really helps with you. Anyways… So where are we going now then, since you have just heisted my ability to use my feet, too?\" \"I honestly have no idea,\" he answered, trying to sound like her. She laughed out loud this time. \"What would you think about having a cup of coffee, tea or something else at my place, Mr. Shine?\" \"Is that an undisguised invitation, Kate Walker?\" \"I believe so,\" she smiled. \"You are going to have to put me down then, though… otherwise I'm afraid you won't be having soles under your shoes anymore by the time we get there.\" He smiled, carefully putting her down on the pavement again. She carelessly threw her high heeled black pumps in front of her, smoothly putting her feet into them, before taking his arm again as they walked into the direction of Willesden Green together. \"Excuse me,\" Kate whispered, immediately after shutting the dark blue front door behind them. She quickly shed herself from her coat, cuing Harvey in doing the same, and hung it at the peg with her handbag. \"Please find yourself a seat while I just run upstairs to change into something else than this utterly uncomfortable working suit,\" she said, gesturing towards the living room. Without giving him any chance to put something in between, Kate had taken off towards the stairs. Once upstairs, she burst into her bedroom, immediately going for the wardrobe. She threw open its massive doors, and let her eyes go over its contents meticulously, searching for a dark brown skirt which she had always liked but never wore much because she thought she shouldn't wear it anymore at her age, and her favorite dark green V-neck top. She had found it almost immediately, laying at the top of the pile. The skirt, however… She hastily browsed through the hangers with clothes with one hand while holding her top with the other, finally noticing something of the same brown material as she was looking for during the second round. Kate threw both items carelessly on the bed before roughly closing her wardrobe again, balancing against it with one hand while taking off her high heeled shoes with the other. Gosh I'm acting like a teenage girl, she thought. Kate continued to strip herself from her clothes in the same haste, throwing them somewhere on the dark wooden floor of the bedroom. She turned around to pick up the skirt, getting herself into it and pulling it further upwards to zip it up, right when the door suddenly opened behind her to reveal Harvey. She hadn't heard him come up the stairs. She gasped, and turned to look at him in shock. He wasn't looking at her, though, for he had immediately shut his eyes and clasped a hand over them when realizing that this must have been the bedroom, and not the bathroom. She relaxed almost immediately again, and even allowed a small smile to creep up on her lips. \"I'm sorry, I was looking for the bathroom,\" he said, honestly, free hand stretched in front of him to prevent himself from hitting anything, not truly directing his attention to Kate herself, but something more to the right of where she stood. \"It's right across the hallway,\" Kate told him, smiling at the sight, while slowly taking her all time favorite top, pulling it over her head and down. \"Right. Thank you,\" he said, accidentally knocking his forehead against the doorway while turning around to leave her room. Kate couldn't help but chuckle, watching him with arms crossed. Her sky blue eyes followed him as he slowly walked forwards, trying not to hit anything again, quietly closing her bedroom door. She smiled, slowly shaking her head, before turning her attention towards the pieces of scattered clothes on the floor. She slowly gathered them one by one, before leaving her bedroom, walking down the stairs and turning left, blindly taking the door behind the stairs into the garage, where the washing and drying machine stood and where she usually did the ironing. She switched on the light, and carelessly dumped the clothes into the empty laundry basket with things to wash before turning back around, switching off the light and leaving the garage, neatly closing the door behind her. Kate had never learned how to drive, resulting positively in being able to use her garage as a laundry and supply room. A small freezer was kept there as well. Kate's average terraced house wasn't provided with a cellar. She could hear the sound of footsteps on the stairs as she walked back into the high ceiled hallway. She smiled up at Harvey, privately rolling her eyes, when suddenly that all too familiar ring tone filled their ears. Kate smiled more apologetically now, walking over towards the peg to search through her handbag for the angrily buzzing thing. Harvey stood at the foot of the stairs. \"Hello Mum. Yes. No, I'm at home. No, I'm fine. I was actually hoping to have a quiet night. No Mum, please don't be like that… Mum? Mum?\" Kate sighed, looking down at the screen to confirm that her always-so-easily-upset-mother had already ended the connection before she had been given a chance to say more. She looked up at Harvey with her sky blue eyes, phone still in hand. \"I didn't get much of an opportunity to explain, did I?\" \"Here,\" Kate whispered, handing him a washcloth with ice cubes. \"That should make the swelling go down. Just keep it on your head for a little while,\" she added, putting down a mug of steaming hot tea on the small, low table in front of him. \"That's cold!\" Harvey complained, lowering the ice almost immediately. \"It's supposed to be,\" Kate said, clasping her hand over his to keep the ice in place. He looked into her eyes, capturing them, trying to see through them, but that appeared impossible. Kate started blushing, and withdrew her hand calmly, going into the kitchen to get herself a cup of tea as well. She hadn't been able to carry the ice and both mugs. She returned soon with a pink and black dotted mug in her hands; damping with the warm, sweet liquid that it contained. She sat herself down on the couch next to him, allowing the steaming and ugly mug to warm her hands. She curled her legs up under herself, fixing her attention on the odd purple lamp sitting on the closet right next to her old television. It must have been one of the first color televisions, Kate sometimes thought by herself. It had been her mother's. She had won one last year with a local lottery thing, leaving her with two working televisions. Kate hadn't had a television up until then, so Maggie had given the old one to her daughter, keeping the new one. Kate didn't watch much television. She preferred reading at all times. From the corners of her eyes, Kate noticed him lowering the ice cubes again. She reached for it with one hand, keeping it on the right side of his head. Harvey simply lowered his hand further down, so that she was the only one still holding the ice. He smiled at her crookedly. \"Harvey Shine, I'm not going to keep holding that!\" She protested. \"I'm not telling you that you should.\" \"Hold it there, or I'm going to get you a huge white bandage and strap these ice cubes to your head with it!\" He didn't make any movement to go and hold the washcloth again. Thus, Kate slowly released the ice, dropping it next to him, and moved forward to set her mug down next to his on the table. She got up, but then Harvey's arm reached around her middle and pulled her down on his lap to prevent her from getting that large white bandage she had threatened him with. Kate slowly turned on his lap to look at him. She suddenly felt very nervous, something in her abdomen either contracting or exploding. She couldn't quite decide, but she felt like a teenage girl again, as Harvey leaned forward to kiss her. This time, it wasn't merely a brush of lips. His lips moved against hers slowly, slightly opening to capture her lips between his, repeating this movement a few times. Kate joined in, opening and closing her mouth at the same, slowly kissing his upper lip, while he settled on kissing her lower. The touch only started hesitantly and gently, then gradually became more passionately. Kate broke apart from him, looking into his eyes briefly. He smiled again, as she slowly returned in her previous position, sitting on his right on the comfortable dirty brown couch. \"Kate?\" Harvey wondered, picking up the ice cubes and holding them to his head again. \"Yes, Harvey.\" He slowly turned his upper body to be able to look at her with meaningful eyes. She could see that he was contemplating about something, opening his mouth a few times without speaking. He lowered the ice cubes again, leaning forward to place them on the table, where no more attention would be paid to them anymore from that moment. He picked up his mug and took a sip of the warm tea, that had now cooled down enough to drink. Kate leaned forward and instinctively followed his example. She, however, kept on holding her mug while he moved to put his down again. She looked at him briefly, waiting for him to speak. He vaguely noticed the movement, then asked, \"If you were given the chance of being pregnant again and carry and then have the child, would you take it?\" She looked at him over the rim of her mug, swallowed the sweet liquid down her throat, and quietly planted her mug down on the table again. The tea suddenly seemed to taste more bitter than it had before. In fact, she couldn't quite at all taste anything sweet in it anymore. Her lips uncontrollably quivered as she tried to compose herself enough to answer. She bit down on her lower lip to keep it from trembling more. She didn't quite understand why she had told him about the pregnancy in the first place. It was a very sensitive subject to her. \"I'm… I'm…\" she started, then took a deep breath. \"I have become a bit too old to discover, haven't I?\" Harvey smiled. \"No, you aren't. You are, what? Twenty-one?\" \"Oh, don' t be silly, Harvey Shine,\" she smiled. He always managed to cheer her up, no matter what situation. She sighed. \"I'm forty, going on forty-one. I'm long past twenty-one, believe me.\" \"Oh, and so you think that's old? I'm more than ten years older than you are. Then what am I? A fossil?\" Harvey smiled. She chuckled, looking into his eyes for a brief instant, then tucking her head into his shoulder as they sat on the couch. She slowly closed her eyes, drifting into some kind of happy cloud with the scent of Harvey Shine's shirt in her nostrils. Harvey's fingers slowly combed through her hair, eyes tracing every curve of her mouth and the rest of her. He wouldn't mind spending every evening for the rest of his life like this. He smiled. He could already tell that Kate and he were much better of a match than Jean and he would have ever been. \"Are you asleep?\" He asked, softly. \"No, I'm not,\" Kate whispered, not making any movement at all. \"Are you tired, then?\" \"A bit,\" she admitted, now raising her head from his shoulder and looking at him with a small smile. She quietly leaned in to touch lips with Harvey, then pulled back before getting up and gathering both empty mugs and the washcloth with ice cubes, that by now had left a little puddle of water upon her table. She retreated into the kitchen, and returned with a kitchen towel, drying away the mess of the ice cubes. Harvey's fingers slowly closed around her wrist when she moved past him to get back to the kitchen, making her look at him. \"I really didn't see anything,\" he assured. She smiled. \"I believe you. Otherwise, I don't think you would have still been here. I'm sure you would have fled.\" \"I'm sure not,\" he whispered, kissing the top of her warm hand, then rose from the couch. \"Harvey, where are you going?\" Kate asked in true surprise. \"It has turned quite late already. I should go back to the hotel.\" She looked at him in disappointment. \"Please... don't go,\" she whispered, lips lingering tantalizingly close to his as she did. She almost begged him with her clear blue eyes. \"My stuff–\" \"won't run,\" she interrupted. \"There's always tomorrow.\" He smiled. \"And tomorrow is going to be the first day of the rest of our lives... together.\" She nodded, smiling brighter than ever before.

Who would stop me? The humans? I'd driven them away years ago. I still went down the mountain to scavenge food from the abandoned village. A vampire? Unlikely. I try to make a point to kill every vampire I meet, if for no other reason than to send the message across that I'm sick and tired of Twilight. (The birds are constantly chirping to each other, \"Edward or Jacob? Edward or Jacob?\" It drives me insane even more than the Humans used to.) Another Lycan? I'd like to meet the idiot that would try to take me. I've held this territory for fifty years, and I'll hold it another hundred. Maybe a younger wolf could take me in a fair fight. That fits me just fine. I try to avoid fair fights whenever possible. There are too many ways a fair fight could turn against me. And yet, my nose twitched. The smell of fresh blood wafted from the east, near the heart of my territory, not far from the cave I made my home in. And that infuriated me. And yet, I smelled nothing that could have killed it, and that confused me. Which was why I was currently dashing for the blood, ready to rip the threat to shreds. And that's when I smelled it. Something flowery and sweet, hidden underneath the smells of the mountain forest. I saw a dead deer lying on the ground just ahead, between me and the sweet smell. And just as I reached it, something silver and gleaming fell all around me, burning my essence. I was dragged by something unseen, and then the silver was lifted from me as I was cast into a cage. Around me was a wooden box, apparently off of the ground, and a human female stood in the opening to the contraption. A pair of animals I dimly remembered as horses pranced nervously behind me, terrified at carrying a predator such as me. The female put some of her fingers into her mouth and made two sharp, shrill sounds that curled my tail. Moments later, a tall, heavily muscled male appeared next to the much younger female, and glared in at me, evaluating me as he made noises that sounded like he was saying \"Hmmm\" repeatedly. \"Looks like you caught the Alpha male.\" He said finally. \"How can you tell Papa?\" The female asked the male. \"This fellow is big and aggressive.\" The male pointed one of his fingers at my notched ear, just one of my many battle scars. \"He probably got this from a dominance fight. This is defiantly a Lycan!\" I snorted and rolled my eyes. I could have told him that. Still, the female jumped. \"It just rolled it's eyes! Can it speak?\" \"No, no.\" The human called \"Papa\" chuckled. \"They can understand us though. Lycans are smart, like a human, but they're mostly just plain ol' wolves.\" I took offence at that comment. So I decided to show the humans my thoughts in the most elegant way I know. I spat in their direction, and slammed the cage, causing my prison to roll, dumping me onto what used to be the wall of my prison, currently the floor. \"Violent fella, ain't you?\" Papa said, patting down his legs. Then, surprisingly, he reached into his skin and pulled out a white triangle, which seemed to be attached. He did the same thing to his other leg, then spat several words I didn't recognize (I believe one such word was muyafookingbich, or something along those lines. He said them so fast I couldn't tell how he pronounced them, but from the female's reaction, they were something unpleasant.) \"Damn it,\" He said in between bursts of the mysterious words, \"I lost my wallet. They won't let us back across the bridge if we don't have money to pay the toll!\" The female started. \"We have to find it Papa!\" She exclaimed. \"Where did you last have it?\" \"At the camp.\" \"Well, maybe you lost it when you were hiding?\" The male made a clicking sound with two of his fingers. \"I think I know where it is. Sera. watch the Lycan while I go look for it. Be careful. There might be more Lycans. They usually run in packs.\" The female, apparently named Sera, gulped nervously and nodded as Papa left my vision. I wrinkled my nose in distaste. The moment he left, the smell of fear began to poor off of her. She climbed into the contraption with me and sat near my cage, but unfortunately not near enough for me to bite at her. Furious that I should be locked up like this, I made myself as comfortable as I could and fell asleep. Unfortunately, I was woken up by the humans' laughter in the middle of what seemed to be the most pleasant dream. I dreamed that I was running after the female, Sera, and she was fleeing me, eyes wide in fear as she looked back over my shoulders as I quickly closed the gap. I had already overcome and eaten Papa. I unfortunately woke up to said individuals, laughing quietly. Papa noticed I was awake and smiled at me. \"Quite a nice dream you must have had there. You were running and chewing in your sleep.\" I snorted again. If only they knew.[Chapter 2] Lycan Story ch2 As Papa drove the contraption (I heard Papa call the thing a \"Wagon\") down the mountain and into the valley, night slowly creped on us. Finally, just when twilight was at it's peak, Papa got out of the wagon and led the horses to a small stream to the side, one I was unfamiliar with. Then again, this wasn't on my territory, and I generally avoided leaving for anything but the mating season, and even then I missed half of them. I sighed. Papa and Sera were talking, but they still hadn't even let me out of my cage, let alone the wagon. At this point, I would actually consider not killing them if they let me stretch my legs. Alright, that was a complete lie. I sighed again. And then Papa appeared in my vision with a net woven from silver and draped it over my cage. It was too far away to leave me senseless, but close enough to immobilize me. And so, thus secured, Papa took my cage down from the wagon and half carried, half threw me to a fire. Before the fire was Sera, and then the net was lifted from my cage. The first thing I did was try to get back from the fire. Unfortunately, that didn't turn out well, so I just sat down, forced to hunch down from the tiny size of my cage. I already had a serious knot in my neck that felt like it was never going away. I could only hope that they would hurry up and kill me or whatever they planned to do. Several minutes of silence passed before Sera broke it. \"Papa, if Lycans are as smart as us, can they use magic?\" I swiveled my ears into position. I had to hear this one, and if anybody knew, it would be the humans. I know it would definitely increase my ability to kill if I could spit fire or bark lightning. Papa looked warily at me before answering. \"Lycans can use Botanomancy and can use a little bit of Bregmancy.\" Sera jumped. \"So he can make us crazy?\" She asked nervously. I liked the sound of that, even if she didn't. Papa gave us a rich belly laugh. \"Nah, but some of them can use telepathy. That's 'bout all the Bregmancy these wolves can use.\" Hmmm… Disappointing. But at least I could still strangle them with tree branches. \"Can we teach him Papa?\" Sara chirped excitedly. \"No.\" he replied, silencing her with a stern glare. \"This guy is vicious. He probably wants to kill you, isn't that right?\" He asked, glaring at me now. I replied with a gesture I used to see on the humans before I drove them off. I think it shows indecision. Then again, I probably would kill them first chance I got, so right after I finished moving my shoulders I nodded my head up and down, something I assume is an affirmative gesture. He moved his hand at me and turned back to the fire. \"We should get some sleep.\" He said finally. He lay down and was snoring loudly within seconds. Sera crawled to my cage and cupped her hands around her mouth. \"Wait a minute.\" She grabbed the net from where it lie and draped it over my cage. She slipped a metal stick of some sort into a hole in the cage, twisted it, and opened the door. She tied something around my neck, and I growled in protest. She closed the door again, and there was a pressure on my neck, as if something was pulling. Then the silver was lifted from the cage, again. \"I know your smart, so how about we make a deal. I'll teach you Bregmancy at night when Papa goes to sleep, if you promise not to run away or kill anyone.\" Promise? What's a promise? Completely confused I decided to ignore her. She snapped her fingers in front of my cage. \"I know you can understand me!\" She whispered furiously. \"As long as you don't kill anyone or run away from us I'll teach you Bregmancy.\" That still doesn't answer my question, but what the hell. If it will get me out of this cage, I'll do it. And so I nodded. Sera opened the cage again. \"Do you have a name? Can I give you one?\" She asked me. I swear, this human needs to explain this stuff to me. How do you GIVE somebody a name? \"Com'on, you know, a name! Like my name is Sera, and Papa's name is Henry.\" Hold up a minute. Papa's named Henry? Well then why the hell does Sera call him \"Papa\" anyway? Sera laughed quietly. \"Well then I'll name you. How about Wolfy?\" She mulled it over for a minute. \"Nah, too friendly.\" She snapped her fingers together. \"I got it! Keda!\" I blinked. By now, you should damn well know what I'm thinking - What the hell is a Keda? \"Keda du Salienve! That's perfect! It means Violent Fang in Elvish!\" Sera's voice rose with excitement, and Papa, excuse me, Henry, jerked in a sleepily surprised motion as he woke up. Sera shoved me back into the cage, taking me by surprise. She locked it and held a finger to her mouth, a gesture I actually recognized as a gesture to be silent. At least, I hope that's what it means. Pa…Henry woke up and began to scold and question Sara about what she was doing, and I caught them saying my new name several times. I decided to ignore them, and focused instead on the various motions Papa made while speaking. You know what? I've decided that humans have too many ways of saying something simple. Maybe they're just too lazy to say the word, so they made the motion instead. Who knows? Damn humans are crazy.[Chapter 3] Lycan Story, ch 3 After Henry yelled at Sera for a while, they went to sleep. The large human positively reeked of anger, even as he slept, which made me wonder what exactly transpired during their conversation. Too bad I didn't really care. Unfortunately for me, Sera sleep with her back against my cage, and her flowery scent prevented me from sleeping. I pawed at the object Sera had put around my neck, and found she had tied a rope to my neck leading to the top of the cage. I pawed at it for a few minutes before I decided there was nothing I could do about it. I buried my snout in my paws and tried to fall asleep. Sera's scent apparently scared off sleep and lured animals. Sometime during the night, a deer wandered too close to my cage to sniff around Sera, tempted by the smell of flowers and trying desperately to find them. Even from inside the cage I managed to rip it's throat out. The deer never saw it coming, either. Warm blood splattered over Pa… Henry and Sera, and the later woke up shrieking. Henry bolted upright and looked at the blood soaked female. \"Sera!\" He cried out before flinging a knife at my cage. Luckily enough for me, it struck the bars and ended up cutting the rope instead of plunging into my eye. I glared at him and growled, before trying my hardest to get the deer close enough for me to eat. It had been much easier to kill the damn thing. \"I'm alright Papa. Keda just killed a deer.\" Sera said. Henry… Alright, screw it. It's too damn hard for me to keep track. If Sera is gonna call me Keda than I can damn well call Henry Papa. Papa looked around for several moments before letting out a relieved breath and slumping forward. He pulled Sera away from my cage(hallelujah!) and looked over at me. \"Stay away from the cage. He could have killed you even easier than he did that deer.\" I growled and pawed at the bars of my cage, hoping they would help me get my dinner. I tried to project my thoughts to them. I'm hungry dammit, give me my deer! I thought furiously, pawing at my cage. \"I think he wants me to stay with him.\" Sera said. I whined and tried projecting my thoughts again. \"Stay away from my daughter you furry bastard.\" Papa said calmly. I sighed and backed up as far as I could in my limited space, before dashing forward and knocking my cage over onto the deer. I stuck my muzzle between the bars and ripped into my meal with gusto. \"Or maybe he just wanted the deer.\" Papa said. Idiots. What else would I be trying to get to? Actually, stupid question. I'd rip out Papa's throat in a heartbeat, but even before that I'd dump my cage into a lake if it would get me a nice, cool drink of water. Drowning would be a small penalty. I considered my last thoughts. For some reason I wasn't actively hoping for a chance to kill Sera. I felt that I would just kill Papa and leave if I got free. Either way, with Sera huddled up with Papa ten feet away, I was certain I would finally be able to sleep. After I finished my deer, of course. I woke up at about dawn, when the humans began moving around and putting their things into the wagon. I was last, the silver cast over my cage as before. Papa took the time to toss a container of water at me, drenching my fur and washing the blood off of the bars of the cage. I growled at him angrily. We had been traveling for maybe half a day before the wagon stopped and muffled voices were heard outside. Then a human, maybe a little older than Sera, appeared in my vision. He had flowing black fur and wore several objects around his neck. In his hand he clutched a stick, with odd notches in it. Or maybe they were called calvings or some such shit as that. Whatever it is humans call it when they make notches in wood. On the top of the staff was the skull of some creature I had never seen before. \"You see, Master Wolfegang?\" Papa said, appearing around the corner of the wagon. Master Wolfegang gestured, and a heavyset figure walked around, fur concealing every part of it's body. Even stranger was that it had no scent whatsoever. \"Call me Alex.\" The small human said. He snapped, and the heavyset figure lifted it's arms, and freaking bones grabbed the bars of my cage. It easily lifted me, cage and all, and placed me on the ground. Alex's face twitched, which looked rather like an expression of anger, to me at least. \"I'm afraid that you're not looking for me. My colleague Chris is the one who is buying them.\" Sera walked around the wagon and leaned against my cage. \"Get away from there!\" Papa exclaimed, snatching her from the cage. Alex flicked his hand. \"He won't hurt her. She's obviously started bonding with him. So long as there isn't any outside interference, she should be able to domesticate the Lycan and begin training him. Uh oh. I didn't know what \"Domesticate\" meant, but I didn't quite like the sound of that. And I definitely did not like the sound of \"training\". Alex looked at me with a look of understanding and pity that I sometimes saw on pups, killing for the first time. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a number of small circular things, colored like the sun. \"I'll save you the trip and pay you thirty gold coins if you let him go, immediately.\" I inwardly cheered for this Alex guy. I swear, I'm gonna bring this guy a deer every night for the rest of my life until I have somehow repaid him for… \"The advertisement says a thousand gold for every live Lycan and five hundred for every dead one.\" Ouch. I may not know what a thousand is, but I know five hundred is more than thirty, and that's assuming I wanted to die. Alex rocked back as if the words had physically pushed him. \"What the fuck?\" He asked, his tone, body language, and scent becoming more angry. \"I've got fifty gold to my damn name and Christopher fucking Titlan can afford to give a thousand to any idiot with a god damn silver net?\" He shouted. Wisps of black smoke began to rise off of him, and the stench of foul magic, probably a dark magic, began to pour off of him as well. I shrunk as far back in my cage as I could. \"Why I'll fu…\" Alex cut off, and the magic disappeared. His anger vanished from his face and tone, if not his scent. \"Forgive me for that, no offense intended.\" He said. \"None taken.\" Papa replied, slowly backing away from Alex, hand protectively over Sera's chest. What the hell? This human can scare even Papa. Even when I killed the deer, he was more angry than afraid. For some reason, though, that made me feel better about cowering. Alex looked over at me, and against my will, I flinched, try though as I might. \"Sorry, big guy, I can't help you.\" Alex snapped, and Bone Arms picked me up and returned my to my place in the wagon. \"I'm not gonna make you release him, but don't keep him in the cage for the entire trip. And give him some water. Have the girl give it to him, he won't kill her.\" Alex said in a commanding tone of voice. \"If you plan to come into my lands for a profit, you will follow my orders.\" He said, before patting my cage and walking away. Several more beings, looking similar to Bone Arms, followed him away. Papa and Sera wordlessly returned to the wagon, and Sara sat next to my cage. She huddled against it, staring after Alex with an expression I wasn't all too familiar with. Adoration, maybe? Or possibly affection? Hell if I know. Damn humans have too many facial expressions.

Los personajes no me pertenecen a mí, sino a Joel Hopkins (Director y guionista). Blablabla.. ya saben! :D ENJOY IT! :) La gente, comúnmente, toma cosas a la ligera. Como cuando está deprimida creé que lo mejor es beber alcohol hasta \"ya no sentir más dolor\" Pero, la pregunta es, ¿Le aliviará? Realmente, ¡No lo sé! Tal vez si, \" como esa novela barata y la copa de chardonnay\"* . Se quiere dar un paso a la vez pero a veces... Simplemente, solo saltas al vacío esperando por... SUERTE. Estaban ellos dos, caminando por el parque. Aún realizando el cuestionario que Harvey le debía a Kate y que había pedido hacerlo en ese momento. Él ahora si tenía tiempo para responder, lo haría con todo gusto... para ella. De esta manera, siguieron por un mes, salían juntos a pasear por el parque. Él la acompañaba a las clases de escritura, él fingía que no leía los libros que ella leía pero lo hacía, y hablaban de esos libros mientras almorzaban. Sentía que no había fin en el camino si ella estaba con él*. Kate, considero la idea de presentarlo con su mamá, así que hoy almorzarían juntos en un restaurante del aeropuerto, si, en ese, donde se volvieron a ver, donde él pedía disculpas aún si ella le dijo que no lo hiciera porque le suele suceder eso de que los pasajeros \"no tengan tiempo\" para responder a ese cuestionario. Harvey, por su parte, estaba nervioso; incluso si ya había pasado por varias veces en esto. Es que, está vez, se sentía diferente, especial. Caminaba de un lado a otro por todo el departamento que rentaba, mientras encontraba un lugar más cómodo no se quejaba pero quería algo propio, como queriendo encontrar algo en alguna parte sabiendo que no había nada. Veía su reloj, literalmente, a cada 5 minutos. Y llego la hora, Kate le llamó para avisarle que salía en 10 minutos porque se retraso pero que estaría ahí lo más pronto posible. Se coloco su chaqueta larga gris y una bufanda porque hacia un poco de frío, salio del hotel, le hizo señas a un taxi y le dijo que lo llevara al aeropuerto, el conductor asintió y se fueron. Llego al aeropuerto, esperaba que su ¿suegra? no estuviera ahí porque si estaba, posiblemente haría un sin fin de preguntas, Kate ya le había dicho al respecto de que su mamá le gusta enterarse de todo COMPLETO y no a medias. Recorre casi todo el aeropuerto intentando encontrar a Kate, pero no le sirvió de nada porque su amada no andaba por ahí, sino en un lugar exclusivo para personal. Cabizbajo se fue al restaurante, iba 15 minutos retrasado, esperaba que la madre de Kate no estuviera ahí porque, antes que todo, la primera impresión cuenta, aún si dicen que no. Para su mala suerte, tal vez, no era la madre de Kate pero era ella, tal parece le habían confundido con otra, Kate, los de seguridad, ella le regaño que porque había tardado, ella no era una persona que se enfadaba pero le estaba esperando desde hace 20 minutos. Te estuve buscando. -se defendió- ¿Y tu madre? Hmm... Se ha retrasado, también. Tal parece que la única no nerviosa y puntual aquí... soy yo. -Dijo ella, con una sonrisa, seguido de un suspiro- Me encanta cuando eres sincera, ¿lo sabes? -dijo él dejando la distancia entre ellos a un lado, ella sonrío y sus labios rosaron, escuchando un tosido cerca de ellos, pero no ponen tanta atención y estaban apunto de besarse pero...- ¡Parece que ya quieren el postre! -afirmó la madre de Kate. Mientras ellos se separaban de una manera rápida, y se sentaron los tres.- -Harvey sonríe y Kate habla- Mamá. -Frunciendo- Si, hija. -responde Maggie, examinando a Harvey con los ojos- Él es Harvey, mi... -Kate pensó unos cuantos segundos antes de responder porque realmente aún no le había pedido ser su novia, pero Harvey respondió- Amigo. -Sonrío amablemente- Mucho gusto. El gusto es mío, mi nombre es Maggie. -Dijo ella, regresando la sonrisa- Y bien.. ¿no estamos aquí para comer? Si. -Respondió Kate, mientras él solo asintió. Llamaron al mesero y pidieron su orden, se las sirvieron y comenzaron a comer- Mamá. Y, ¿cómo han estado las cosas con tu vecino el \"jack 'el destripador' polaco\"? -Dijo Kate, llevándose un bocado de su comida a la boca y Harvey sonreía por la manera en que Kate había llamado al vecino de su madre, era lindo verla hacer bromas, dejar la \"frialdad británica\" a un lado, que ella dijo que se había acabado desde que murió Diana.- Pues, muy bien, Anita Harmon*. -Maggie sonrío y ellos, también lo hicieron. Hablaron un poco, sobre la vida de Harvey. Él la miraba con esos ojos de enamoradizo a Kate y Maggie lo notaba. Terminaron de comer, Harvey se levanto y fue al baño de caballeros. Ellas se quedaron solas. Maggie no había preguntado más de lo que él contaba.- ¿Alguna pregunta en esta loca cabecilla, madre? -pregunto Kate- ¿Estás embarazada? -lanzo la pregunta, Maggie, esperando por suerte- -Kate tomaba de su vino, y casi se ahogo- ¡MAMÁ! Por Dios, ¿de qué rayos estás hablando? -Dijo solo para ellas, en un tono bajo- Oh, bueno. ¿Es que ahora no se pueden hacer preguntas directas? Entonces, ¿solo era un almuerzo con tu novio? -Pregunto su madre, rodando los ojos- No es mi novio. -Dijo Kate, viendo la puerta del baño, suspiro- ¿Qué no son novios? -Pregunto Maggie, como que si el mundo se fuese a acabar por eso. Se paso la mano sobre su rostro y tirando su pelo hacía atrás, dramatizando por ello- Mamá.. Mamá.. -Decía Kate, agarrando la mano izquierda de Maggie- Tranquila. Mira, no queremos ir rápido, nosotros queremos darnos... ¡NO TE ATREVAS! -Dijo Maggie, casi ofendida por eso, viendo a su hija con ojos matadores- Ustedes ya no están para dar pasos de bebés. Solo saltas y ya. -Levantando sus manos al cielo, y tirándolas a la mesa provocando un pequeño ruido entre la mesa y los platos- -Kate se estaba enfadando por el humor de su madre- Ok, vale. Pero, hay cosas que no se toman a la ligera. Y, ¿si no funciona? Kate.. Kate.. Hija, te amo, lo sabes. Pero a veces, no entiendo de donde sale esa tontería tuya, eres inteligente pero... Él -señalando a la puerta del baño- te ama, y yo lo sé, porque se quedo en Inglaterra, con este frío ¡que vamos! -levantando ambas manos- y si lo digo yo, es porque realmente lo sé. En la forma que te mira, hablan, él se quedo... por ti. -Termino Maggie de hablar, agarro la mano de su hija y Kate sonrió. Un hombre se acercaba a la mesa, y desde lejos dijo ¡Hey, Kate! robando la atención de ambas mujeres. Era su ex novio, ese hombre apuesto de ojos azules, alto y escritor de novelas- -Se acerca más a ellas, Kate se levanta de su asiento- Hola, Hugh. ¿Cómo has estado? -Él, le dio un fuerte abrazo, sintiendo el aroma del otro, hace mucho no lo sentía, desde que habían terminado su relación hace mucho, no se volvieron a ver porque él se mudó. Éste, se separo un poco, solo para ver el rostro de Kate, cerró los ojos y se acerco a ella descaradamente, casi rozando sus labios; ella hizo lo mismo, pero reaccionó, sintió una mirada, abriendo rápidamente sus ojos y separando a Hugh de ella, volteó a ver al baño de caballeros y allí estaba Harvey, viéndola, cabizbajo. Se acerco, no dijo nada, solo agarro su chaqueta larga y se fue.- Harvey... -dijo ella, intentando caminar hacía él, pero Hugh le agarro el brazo.- Continuará... *Frase que dice Harvey a Kate, cuando realmente hablan por primera vez, en el restaurante. *Anita Harmon, es el libro que ella lee en la película, lamentablemente, solo es un ejemplo, es decir, el libro no existe. El director no quería problemas con los derechos de autor así que se invento uno. ESPERO ALGUIEN LO LEA... :/ :D Alguien lo leerá, venga la buena actitud! Les gusto? Di que si, aunque sea no! xD haha Saludos, xo[Chapter 2] Holaaaaaaaaaaa.. ¿Adivinen quién está de vuelta? THIS GIRL IS BACK!

Los personajes no me pertenecen a mí, sino a Joel Hopkins (Director y guionista). Blablabla.. ya saben! :D ENJOY IT! :) ¿Quién es él, Kate? -Pregunta Hugh, como si le debiera una respuesta.- Alguien. -Respondió rápido, intentando safarse, pero él la sostenía fuerte sin lastimarla, claro.- \"Si piensas que la aventura es peligrosa, prueba la rutina es mortal\" * y con ese tipo... -sonrío- -Kate voltea hacía su madre, ella solo estaba escuchando la conversación y viendo lo que sucedía.- Bueno... -Dijo Maggie, levantandose- No, madre.. -Dijo Kate- ¿Podemos comer algo? -Pregunto Hugh, como siempre amable.- No. Ya comimos. -Respondió Kate, desesperada por hablar con Harvey, ahora ella le debía una disculpa, ella sentía que se la debía. Aunque lo haría después, cuando él se calmara un poco, porque suposo que no le contestaría el celular.- ¿Qué tal a las 4pm? Para tomar el té. -Pregunto tímido, viendo a Kate, mientras la Maggie desaparecía del restaurante.- A-ah.. bu-bue... -Balbuceaba ella- ¿Puedes, verdad? -Preguntó nuevamente Hugh, acercándose más a ella intentando robarle un beso.- No. -Lo empujo con sus manos- Debo regresar a trabajar. -Mintió, ella tenía la tarde libre.- Lo siento, Hugh. -Agarro su chaleco, ya habían pagado la cuenta, y salió del lugar.- -Hugh la seguía y ella sabía que lo hacía. La abraza de espaldas y lentamente la voltea, con cariño y sutileza, características de él.- Te amo. -Fue lo único que dijo antes de robarle un apasionado beso, ella no se negó, recordaba esos tiempos con él y cómo la hacía sentir de bien, y le regresó el beso, hasta que se quedaron sin aire entonces se separaron, él se acerca para seguir besándose pero ella lo detuvo, tiro su pelo rubio hacía atrás, dio media vuelta y se marchó. Él solo la vio, sonrió- Que bella te ves. -Susurro- Nunca cambias. -Pensó que estaba loco porque habla solo, pero.. loco por ella.- \"Cuando el mundo se viene encima, ellos vienen. Para construir una pared entre nosotros.. Sabemos que ellos no ganarán.\"* Harvey tomo el primer bus que encontró, realmente no quería saber, en este momento, nada sobre Kate; sin embargo, el destino pensaba otra cosa. Porque en el bus empezó a sonar Lovers' Eyes de Mumford & Sons. Él escuchaba atento, solo pensaba en esos ojos azules de ella, que eran tan hermosos y que podría verlos todo el día sin cansancio. Veía las calles de Inglaterra, tan... melancólicas y bellas, al mismo tiempo, en el estado que andaba, esa lluvia que empezaba era perfecta para levantar sus ánimos, llevaba poco ahí pero ya se había acostumbrado a la lluvia, se había enamorado de ella, incluso. Esos pensamientos se fueron, porque una llamada estaba entrando y su móvil empezó a sonar, con un jingle que él compuso, era Kate, solo vio pero no le interesaba hablar con ella, no era justo lo que había hecho. Él había dejado su vida allá en New York, o lo poco que quedaba de ella, porque quería una oportunidad en el amor... con ella. ¡Vamos, Harvey! -Decía ella, en el taxi que la llevaba a su casa, iba a cambiarse y después visitaría el departamento de Harvey, tal vez estará ahí, fue lo que pensó.- No, ahora. -Él suspiro, el bus se detuvo y se bajo. Empezó a caminar, tanto que no se fijo de la hora. Eran las 10pm.- ¡Woow! Aquí si que se pierde la noción del tiempo. -Dijo, aún si sabía que nadie estaba con él.- -Ella lo esperaba fuera de su departamento, sentándose cerca de la puerta. Y ahí estaba, llamándolo pero él no contestaba. Lo entendía.- Dios, Harvey. ¿Dónde estás? -Colocando su cabeza hacía atrás, cerrando sus ojos.- No tan lejos. -Respondió Harvey, caminando hacía ella.- -Rápidamente se levanto, pero el se paro frente a la puerta, saco sus llaves y abrió la puerta.- ¡Te estoy esperando desde hace mucho tiempo! -Dijo ella casi exaltada- ¡¿Dónde andabas?! Por cualquier lugar. -Dijo él, viendo a esos hermosos ojos azules de ella. Él suspiró.- Bueno. -Dijo entrando.- Espera, Harvey. -Dijo ella deteniendo la puerta con su mano, para que el no cerrará.- ¡¿QUIÉN ERA ÉL?! -Reclamó él- Era un plan tuyo, para demostrarme que lo mejor es qué me regrese a New York, ¿Huh? -Viéndose. Él se volteo, y camino hacía el mini bar de su departamento.- Harvey, escucha. -Se defendió ella. Él se sirvió vodka.- Él FUE -resaltando esto último- mi novio. ¿Vale? ¡Ya no lo es! Ahora... ¿AHORA? -Pregunto él, tomando su vodka- No digas, ahora. Ni siquiera sabias que decirle a tu madre, Kate. Yo tuve que decir que somos amigos porque.. ¡PORQUE TU NO ME HAS DICHO QUE SEAMOS ALGO! -Dijo ella, por fin. Se vieron, ella con los ojos cristalinos, queriendo llorar- -Harvey dio un gran respiro, asintió.- Bien. -Pasando su lengua sobre sus labios, acercándose a la cama, donde se encontraba ella con lágrimas en sus mejillas. La agarro de su cadera, levantándola y acercándola a él. Harvey le dijo- Te amo. -No se sentía igual, como cuando Hugh le dijo lo mismo. Ahora, se sentía distinto, más... bonito. Coloco su mano en la nuca de ella, vio sus hermosos labios y acercandolos a los de él, sintiendo la respiración del otro- -Ella coloco su mano izquierda en la nuca de él.. susurrando- Te amo, Harvey. -FIN- *Líneas de la canción Don't dream it's over by Crowded House. *Frase de Paulo Coelho. \"Larga vida y prosperidad\". –Spock (Star Trek) Qué les pareció? :D Mal.. terrible..

Harvey slipped into the bathroom, two glasses of red wine in hand. Taking a seat on the toilet, he extended one to the woman covered in bubbles. She took an appreciative sip before easing back. \"So where are we going?\" \"Dinner.\" She resisted the urge to roll her eyes. \"Where?\" \"Jamison's.\" \"Ooh, flash.\" \"Mm,\" he agreed. \"Susan picked it.\" \"How long have I got?\" He checked his watch. \"About two hours still.\" \"Good,\" she said, struggling to hide a yawn. \"This water is heavenly.\" Taking another sip of her wine, she eyed him. \"You okay?\" \"Hm?\" he responded, distracted. She extended a leg to poke him in the shoulder. He clasped her wet limb as he smiled at her. \"I'm fine.\" Kissing her lower leg, he stroked it. \"Maybe just a little nervous?\" \"Is that a question or a statement?\" Kate asked with a grin. \"A statement?\" he posed. She laughed outright. \"We'll be fine.\" He rose and leaned down to kiss her. \"Thank you.\" \"What for?\" she replied happily. He paused. \"Everything.\" She was mortified when tears pooled in her eyes. \"I should also thank you.\" \"For helping you in your 'situation\"?\" he replied blandly. She whacked him on the shoulder then. Harvey left the bathroom grinning. Meeting Kate for lunch – noon on the dot – the next day, Harvey found her seated on the bench, contemplating the water fountains. Sitting beside her, he leaned in to kiss her, but stilled when he saw tears in her eyes. \"Hey,\" he said softly as she madly dashed them away. \"It's nothing,\" she reassured him. He clasped her cheek and brushed the offending tears away with his thumb. \"It's something.\" She sighed as she nestled her cheek into his palm. \"I'm just feeling a bit weepy. That time of the month and all.\" \"Right.\" He was far from convinced. Wrapping his arm around his shoulder, he pulled her in close to him. Pressing a kiss to her crown, he surveyed the scene before him as he allowed her to collect herself. There was silence for some time, and he started when Kate spoke suddenly. \"I want a child.\" He held his breath. He must have seemed tense, for Kate eased from his embrace and looked at him. \"I'm sorry to spring this on you. Forget I said it.\" She rose from her seat. \"Let's go have lunch.\" His fingers twined in hers, he found himself unable to move, even when she tugged. Looking up into her face, he came to a realisation. Tugging her into his lap, he ignored her protests that she was too heavy. Wrapping his arms around her, he looked her in the eye. \"If you want a child, I'll give you a child.\" She froze, looking at him incredulously. \"Are you serious?\" He brought his hand to rest on the blouse of her work outfit. \"Well, I can't make any guarantees, but if this is something that you want, then I'm there.\" Time seemed to hold still before Kate reached to cover his hand on her stomach. \"You're willing to be a father? Again?\" He swallowed. \"Not just any father. The father of your child.\" He could see the happiness blooming in her features, but wasn't prepared for when she leaned in and kissed him. He recovered swiftly though. Her eyes were aglow when they parted. \"Shall we go?\" \"Practice?\" he asked. He laughed when she flushed. \"No. Lunch.\" \"Lead the way madam.\" Arm in arm, they walked off together. More to come.[Chapter 2] Disclaimer: I own nothing, except my own creations. A year later, Jean just looked at her ex-husband. \"You're going to be a father ?\" she finally managed. \"Yep.\" \"Good Lord, I need a drink.\" Two whiskies later, she spoke again. \"You do realise that Susan is pregnant as well?\" \"Yes I know,\" he replied. \"She told me.\" \"Our grandchild is going to the same age as your lovechild.\" Harvey shrugged. \"It's not like it hasn't happened before.\" Jean laughed incredulously as Harvey continued to speak. \"And it's not just a child – it's two.\" She struggled to comprehend what her ex-husband was saying. \"Twins,\" he supplied helpfully. \"Oh.\" She plastered a smile on her face as the subject of their conversation approached them. Looking her ex's new wife over, she was surprised she hadn't seen it before – the rounded abdomen, the loose shirt... \"Congratulations Kate,\" she said as the tall woman stood next to her husband's bar chair. \"Thanks.\" \"And you too Harvey,\" she said as her ex-husband wrapped an arm around his wife's back. \"Thank you.\" \"Now, if you'll excuse me.\" Kate turned to her husband. \"That went well.\" He tugged her forward to stand between his legs, holding her hips. \"One down, one to go.\" \"Oh god,\" said Kate, lifting a hand to cover her face. \"How are we going to tell Susie that her child's aunt and uncle will be the same age as them.\" \"Easy,\" replied Harvey, tugging her hand away from her face. \"We'll just tell her.\" She snorted. \"That's so masculine of you.\" \"Why thank you.\" Tugging his wife in for a kiss, he smoothed his hands over her shirt, pulling it tight over her taut abdomen. Harvey wasn't sure what reaction he expected from his daughter, but it wasn't this. \"Aren't you too old?\" she laughed. \"Hey,\" he replied, affronted. \"I'm not dead and buried yet.\" \"I'm sorry Dad,\" she giggled. \"I just didn't think that you could even, well...\" His son-in-law thankfully stepped in then. \"Congrats. Glad our kids will have cousins to play with.\" \"Aunts and uncles actually,\" corrected Kate faintly. \"Oh yeah,\" said Scott as Susie looked at her stepmother. \"You're planning a few?\" \"Gods no,\" she replied. \"But I've already got a few.\" She covered the gentle swell of her belly. \"Twins,\" she said weakly. Scott slapped Harvey on the back. \"Good going old man.\" Susie grinned at them both. \"This is going to be awesome.\" \"Awesome,\" they echoed. Entering their apartment later that night, Kate snorted. \"I love how you seem to be getting all the congratulations – it's like you've done all the hard work.\" She tugged her shirt off. \"You're not the one puking up your guts every morning and discovering that half your wardrobe doesn't fit anymore.\" He approached her, throwing his jacket on the bed and loosening his tie. \"What can I say? The world ain't fair.\" She laughed as she pulled her pants off. \"Nice.\" Releasing a breath, she stretched. \"Now I can breathe properly.\" Turning to her husband, she opened her mouth to speak, but stilled. His eyes were on her swollen abdomen. Placing her hand on the taut skin, she reached out for his. Their gaze held as they shared in a moment. \"I love you,\" said Kate, mortified at the tears that accompanied her declaration. \"I love you too.\" Finito.

You're beautiful.\" She blushed for the fifth time in a few minutes, and just smiled. \"Thank you.\" \"You're welcome.\" He replied, \"And if you turn any redder I'm going to get concerned.\" \"If you stop flirting with me, Harvey, I wouldn't blush.\" \"Woah,\" He held his hands up in surrender. \"Sor-ry! I forgot I was talking to Ms. Straight forward!\" She smiled largely, \"Did you have anything specific planned?\" He shook his head guilty. \"Not really...I just wanted to see you again.\" She nodded. \"I'm sure you have better things to do than sit at fountains at noon with strange men.\" He told her, \"I know this is ridiculous...\" She nodded, \"It is. A little, anyway...\" She turned to him, \"Harvey... I'm from London, and you're from America. We met today-\" \"-Yesterday.\" He interrupted. She sighed, \"Fine, yesterday... I just don't understand what you expect to come of this...\" \"This?\" He questioned, \"What do you mean?\" \"This.\" She stressed, moving her hand back and forth between them. \"Us.\" \"Oh!\" He realized, \"Us... Well, I can tell you that you're beautiful...And that I...\" He sighed, and turned to her, \"I want to be with you.\" She shook her head, \"Harvey...\" \"I know,\" He told her, \"I know, Kate. You're cantankerous... I know.\" He paused, grabbing her hands, \"But the funny thing is that I don't care! I'm not saying we'd be together forever! I'm just-\" \"-Just shut up! Okay?\" She paused, tears filling her eyes. \"This is why I don't want this! Because there's no guarentee of forever! And some day there'll be it isn't working out, or I don't want you anymore, or there's...there's...someone else.\" She was becoming increasingly upset, and Harvey was concerned. He searched her eyes in silence for a moment as she tried to compose herself. \"There's something you're not telling me.\" He stated. She nodded, \"I can't confide everything in you...There's still a chance you'll disappear.\" He smiled slightly, and shook his head, reaching across the table to hold her hand. \"I'm not going anywhere...Kate? Look at me.\" She slowly turned, and with bloodshot eyes looked at him. \"I promise,\" He began softly, \"I'm not going to leave you...okay?I'm not. Now tell me your story.\" She swallowed, took a deep breath, and looked out into the fountains. \"The pregnancy? The one I told you about?\" She paused, \"Daniel was his name. We were together about a year before, and he was insistant on not having children.\" \"What about you?\" He tenderly interrupted. She smiled softly. \"Me? I couldn't wait for a bundle of joy... But I was far too young, and as soon as I told him...He admitted to cheating on me. Using me for my 'parts' as you might put it.\" Harvey gritted his teeth. How dare that man use Kate. She sighed and continued, the tears reappearing. \"...I just... He'd been with the other woman, Lisa, for ten out of the twelve months we'd been together. For ten months, Harvey the man I thought loved me was in another woman's bed.\" He held steady to her hand, giving it an affectionate squeeze. \"I told him about the baby, and right after he'd dumped the cheater story on me, he insisted I abort.\" \"Why?\" Harvey once again asked her gently. \"He said,\" She paused, a bitter grin on her face, \"He didn't want children with a woman he didn't love...And that they were a waste of time anyway.\" \"But you wanted children.\" He pointed out. She nodded, \"Yes. I did. But when someone degrades you like that, it degrades the child, too. And I didn't want my child growing up with that type of man for a father.\" \"But they'd have an excellent mother.\" He pointed out. She smiled slightly, \"Eventually, they'd ask about their father, and as he or she got older I'd have to tell the true story. I didn't want that... But the statistics? They're right. Abortion changes your life, and especially for the worse.\" She sighed, \"I still regret it, you know. Not keeping him or her.\" He nodded, \"I can tell.\" She sighed, standing up. \"But in all honesty, I'd rather not discuss that any further. And seeing as how you don't have any plans for us... Would you like to take a walk?\" He nodded, standing up as well. \"Sure, Kate Walker.\" She smiled, grabbing his arm. \"Wonderful, Harvey Shine.\" As they walked, they chatted about various things...her life, his life, their families... \"I love my mother dearly, really, I do. But...\" Kate sighed, \"Just as I mentioned before, she calls my being single a situation. It isn't a situation, it's just my life.\" Harvey smiled at her, \"I can change that.\" \"Harvey...\" She began warningly. \"Kate...\" He mocked, \"I'd like to meet your mother. Can I meet her?\" Kate smiled, \"I suppose. If you really want to. Although, I would consider this carefu-\" Kate sighed as her cell phone began to ring. \"I'm sorry.\" She told him, before flipping it open and answering. \"Hello, Mother... No, I'm out...Yes...Yes, the man from yesterday...Mother!...I understand you believe so, but that is not somethin you ask your daughter! ...No!...We're coming over...Yes, us... Yes, I know. I told him he was crazy...Alright, love you too...Bye.\" Kate sighed putting away her phone. \"C'mon, we're meeting my mother...\" And she grabbed his arm, pulling him to her mother's. \"What'd she ask you?\" Kate blushed. \"If we were sleeping together.\" Harvey answered jokingly, \"Not yet.\" \"Harvey Shine!\" She slapped his arm, and they continued walking.[Chapter 2] A/N: Here's chapter 2, more to come... Fountains at Noon Chapter 2 kateandharvey As they walked in the direction of Maggie's house, there was an odd silence between them. For a long while as they walked, the air was thick, as if something had happened. Finally, after the moments of silence, Harvey questioned her, \"What's wrong?\" She looked up at him, her eyes fluttering nervously, and shook her head. \"Nothing, I'm just tired.\" \"Well, we don't have to go to your mother's tonight, there's always tomorrow.\" \"Tomorrow?\" She questioned, her eyes looking into his questioningly. \"What do you mean there's tomorrow?\" He smirked at her, \"I'll be here tomorrow, and the next day, and the next day, and-\" Kate stopped in the middle of the walkway so abruptly that Harvey took a few steps after her. \"Yes, and what about after that?\" She questioned harshly, \"What about after all of the next days? After this week?\" Harvey shrugged, \"I'll be here.\" \"Yes, Harvey, you'll be here next week. But what about next month? Next year? Four years from now, where will you be?\" She answered the question for him, \"Chances are, not here.\" He sighed, \"What do I have to do to make you believe me?\" He questioned her with a smile, \"Hmm, Kate? Why won't you believe me?\" She shook her head, whispering, \"There's nothing you can do.\" He looked at her intensely for a minute or two before she raised her head to look at him. Silently, he stepped forward and cupped her cheek. \"Harvey...\" \"There's nothing I can do?\" He repeated quietly, his eyes fixed on her lips. \"Harvey, please...\" Kate tried to stop him, to get him to understand, but it was to no avail. She couldn't stop him, and she couldn't pull away. \"What about this?\" He whispered, and his lips hesitantly brushed hers. But unlike their previous kiss, this one didn't end there. He firmly pressed his lips to hers, and at her sharp intake of breath, kissed her passionately. Faintly, she responded. She pulled away, and they shared a look for a moment. She grabbed his arm, and they continued on their way. A few seconds down the path, she leaned over to him, \"You have lipstick on your mouth.\" Harvey had to admit, as they stood outside the door, he was a bit nervous. Kate noticed this and grabbed his hand, \"Come along.\" She whispered, and she pulled him through the open door. \"Mum?\" Kate called into the house. \"Kitchen.\" Was the reply, and that is where they entered. As soon as they did, Kate smiled at her mother, and then Maggie's eyes drifted immediately to their interlocked hands. \"Hello.\" Kate walked over to her mother, hugging her, and kissing her on the cheek. It didn't go unnoticed by Maggie that Kate's hand clasped Harvey's immediately after she finished her greeting. \"Mum, this is Harvey Sine. Harvey, Maggie Walker.\" Harvey smiled, and shook Maggie's hand. \"Hello.\" Maggie's eyes widened. \"Kate, you didn't tell me he was an American.\" Kate scolded her mother with her eyes, and squeezing Harvey's hand in reassurance, told her mother, \"Yes, well, it must've slipped my mind.\" Maggie nodded, looking over Harvey. \"You have my daughter's lipstick on your own mouth, Mr. Shine.\" Maggie smirked, to let him know she was only joking. \"Mother!\" Kate scolded, and turned toward Harvey. \"I told you.\" She whispered. Harvey shook his head, \"I thought I took care of it!\" He was extremely embarrassed. Kate shook her head, and swiftly grabbed a napkin from the counter, licked it, and wiped off his mouth. His face turned in disgust right before she reached his lips. \"Excuse me!\" He exclaimed, avoiding her napkin, \"You just licked that.\" Kate rolled her eyes, \"Need I remind you whose lipstick I'm removing?\" With raised eyebrows, she questioned. He stayed silent, and she removed the last of the lipstick. Maggie watched the display with glee. Her daughter and Harvey had clearly just had what they assumed was a private conversation, and were in fact bickering back and forth in her kitchen, forgetting she was there. \"I'm Maggie.\" She broke the silence, \"But you can call me Mum if you wish.\" She winked, and Kate stared at her usually proper mother, her mouth agape. \"Mother!\" \"Katelyn Margaret Walker, you use that tone with me one more time...\" She was merely joking, but Kate promptly shut her mouth. \"You didn't tell me your name was Katelyn.\" Harvey whispered in astonishment. Kate rolled her eyes, \"Well the reasons are obvious why I didn't! It sounds so juvenile...\" Harvey shook his head, \"I think it's cute.\" They shared a moment of eye contact as Kate blushed. Maggie nodded, \"I do believe, though, that Katelyn Shine sounds better than Kate Shine.\" Kate stared at her mother with wide eyes, but remembering her warning, said nothing. \"Mum, we can't stay long, we need to get going, I'm just going to visit the restroom before we leave.\" And she promptly headed up the stairs. Maggie looked at Harvey, \"You make her nervous.\" Harvey's brow furrowed, \"What do you mean?\" Maggie shrugged, \"It a good way, but you make her nervous, giddy.\" Harvey still looked very confused. Maggie smiled, \"It's a good thing, Harvey. And if it helps you any, I like you.\" Harvey smiled just as Kate entered the room. \"Why are you smiling?\" She questioned. \"I wasn't gone nearly long enough for childhood pictures, so what is it?\" Harvey shook his head as they walked to the door, \"Nothing.\" Kate shrugged it off, and kissed Maggie goodbye. Just as she was shutting the door, Maggie told her daughter, \"You can always bring him back.\" And Kate shut the door, a smile on her face. ","Summary":" AN: Just an idea...

This is a fan fiction based on characters owned by Universal Pictures. I DO NOT OWN THEM. This is just for fun. 2. This is a femslash story. If you don't like that sort of thing, you won't like this . She looked around her; everywhere was so familiar. The sand dunes. The pyramids. The stone carvings. It was all so familiar. But... no. It could not be. These surroundings were thousands of years in the past. They were gone. Elements of her previous life. Elements of when she was alive. She wandered aimlessly, the hot sand almost burning her bare feet. She knew this was not real - her experience locked away deep underwater made her very akin to the spiritual plane. But this was different. Her being here was no longer of her doing. Plus, the last time she saw herself here, she was... a different person. Felt different. Thought different. She had different goals. But things changed since. Previously, she was also not alone. She could once see the modern man in the distance, standing in the desert, looking as bewildered as she herself no doubt did now. Back then, she did not really feel anything for him, for 'Nick'. He was a means to an end. But now, a pang of guilt filled her. She continued walking, alone. Much to her annoyance, she found herself wishing for the one person who actually came to mean something in her undead life. She wanted nothing more than to be in the arms of her beloved... \"You cannot escape.\" She spun around at the voice, spoken like a gust of wind. A voice she knew so well, but no longer brought the, dare she say, comfort it once did. \"You are mine,\" it said. \"You will always be mine.\" Without thinking, she began shaking her head. \"No... no, you are wrong.\" Her eyes closed tight. \"I have changed. I can fight you. I will fight you... \" \"You will always be mine,\" the voice repeated. \"And all you hold dear will burn if you fight... \" At that, she saw, in the distance, a beautiful blonde woman walking towards her. She instantly felt relief, but when the woman halted, she blinked. The woman looked at her, pained... The woman then screamed silently, as her entire body lit up, as if caught ablaze from the searing sun above... \"No!\" she gasped. \"No, please!\" She indeed knew this was not real, but the sight before her overrode her common sense. She ran as fast as her legs could carry her, but unlike when she could reach Nick in just a few strides, this time the distance between her and her goal never shortened; if anything, it only lengthened. She could only watch as the woman singed before her, holding out her own hand and screaming her name noiselessly. \"All will burn... \" Ahmanet shot up in bed like lightning, gasping heavily. If if could do so, sweat would have poured down her forehead. She did not even feel the bed shift as the woman next to her sat up. \"Ahma?\" Ahmanet stayed silent as she tried calming herself; she barely registered the fact her body was shaking. \"Ahmanet, what's wrong?\" She felt a strong hand caress her hair. Eventually, the undead woman found her voice. \"F... forgive me,\" she husked. \"I had a... troubled vision.\" \"Do you want to talk about it?\" When Ahmanet just shook her head, the woman next to her spoke again, more assertively. \"Ahma, please.\" With that, the living mummy turned and looked at her companion. Jenny Halsey glared at her with loving worry. \"It is nothing to be concerned with, beloved. It was just a nightmare.\" \"Don't give me that bollocks,\" snapped the Brit. \"You said it was a vision . Tell me, Ahmanet. I need to know what you saw.\" The Egyptian frowned. \"So you can report to your insane employer.\" Jenny looked crushed. The expression of hurt on her face made Ahma almost wilt. \"No, I need to know beca... \" She stopped, and took a deep breath. \"I mean - yes , I need to report to Jekyll. You know I do.\" Indeed, Ahmanet did. That was the reason the undead woman was raised from her tomb in the Prodigium's HQ: to aid in finding Nick Morton. Jenny then looked at Ahmanet with pure conviction. \"But more importantly, I need to know because I love you, and I need to know you're alright.\" Ahmanet nearly chuckled. When the Set-infused Nick kissed and drained Ahmanet of energy, it had an unexpected side effect upon her second reawakening: she was now in possession of a conscience . So not only did the living mummy regret her actions towards her family in ancient Egypt, but she felt shame at leading Nick on the course to gain the power of Set. Though, at the same time, it also enabled Ahmanet to find real companionship: she was deeply in love with Jennifer Halsey. And she would do anything to protect her - even face Set himself, in whatever form he appeared in. \"Ahma, please talk to me.\" Jenny rested her forehead against Ahmamet's unmarked own. That was another thing her latest resurrection did: her black markings on her body were starting to fade. The top of her face was now completely clear. It was like Ahmanet was slowly being purged of evil; helped no less by the love of a 21st century woman. Her skin was still chalk-white, though. Ahmanet took a gulp - not of air, as she had no need to breathe - and stroked the cheek of her lover. There was no getting out of this. \"I was in the sand dunes.\" \"Was Nick there?\" The mummy almost felt agitated at Jenny's question, but knew it was only logical. It was Jenny's job to find Nick. Besides, Ahamet had no one to blame but herself: despite the terms of her reawakening, there was one aspect of her visions Ahmanet had yet to reveal. \"No, my love,\" she sighed. \"At least, not really.\" Looking at her, Jenny frowned. \"What's that supposed to mean?\" \"It was Set.\" \"But Nick is Set now... isn't he?\" Jenny's confusion was justified - Ahmanet found the situation so herself. \"Not fully,\" she explained. \"Set would never have resurrected you. Though he is one with Nick, Nick is still the dominant entity.\" The undead woman sighed. \"Set was in spirit form in my vision, unseen.\" Jenny's eyes widened in surprise, but she kept quiet. Ahmanet knew she was waiting for her to continue. \"He showed me something... something terrible.\" With that, Ahmanet actually choked in anguish. Not used to seeing such a reaction from her lover, Jenny's jaw dropped. \"What did you see?\" Ahmanet knew she had to say it. She had to tell her Jenny anything she saw in her visions. And while this did not pertain to Nick per se, it was still important. \"You,\" she whispered. \"Dying.\" She could feel Jenny's entire body freeze. \"I will not let that happen,\" the Egyptian quickly said. \"You will not come to harm again, I swear it.\" The Brit's face softened. \"Ahma... \" \"You will never again be hurt by this,\" declared Ahmanet. \"I will fight Set with every facet of my being to keep you safe. On this plane or any other, I will not have you hurt in anyway. Let alone have my visions of you be corrupted.\" \"Visions of... ?\" Jenny tilted her head. \"You've had visions of me before?\" Damn. So much for that little secret. \"Yes,\" relented Ahmanet. \"I... often do.\" For a few agonising moments, Jenny was silent. When she spoke, her voice was barely audible. \"You're wearing your regal gowns... and your skin is natural. Unmarked.\" Now it was Ahmanet's turn to be confused. \"Sometimes, we just hold hands,\" Jenny said wistfully. \"Overlooking your old kingdom, or just the horizon. But others... we make love endlessly in the... unending sunlight.\" Surprised, Ahmanet nodded. \"How do you... ?\" A tear actually trickled down Jenny's cheek. \"I've had them too,\" she choked. \"I... I just thought they were... wishful dreams... I... I don't have them everynight, but... \" Ahmanet could not believe it. She had such dreams herself, but thought they were hers alone. She promised when they began their coupling, she would never intrude into Jenny's mind the way she did Nick's. The Egyptian would let her beloved have her privacy. Sometimes, she wondered if that meant they lacked a real bond: that their relationship was purely physical. Though Ahmanet truly loved the 21st century woman, she did wonder if a lack of spiritual togetherness showed they were not meant to be. But it turned out that togetherness was there all along, without either realising it. Their feelings were so strong, their dreams were one regardless. If Ahmanet could do so, she might have cried at the revelation. That Jenny was sharing their visions, even unknowingly, warmed the mummy's unbeating heart immeasurably. \"What does this mean... ?\" Jenny asked, wide-eyed with wonder. Ahmanet smiled and stroked a cheek full of life. \"It means, my love, that we are soulmates.\" She kissed the Brit tenderly. When their lips separated, Jenny's curved up into a smile. \"I think I like the sound of that.\" After another kiss, her grin widened. \"Does that mean we can spend every moment together, waking or otherwise?\" Ahmanet could tell there was some mirth in her lover's tone. \"If you wish it,\" she chuckled back. \"I can think of worse things,\" smirked the Brit. \"So... what happens now?\" \"If you open keep your mind open, I can come to you when you sleep,\" explained the undead woman. While she could be with Jenny spiritually when awake, as she was multiple times with Nick, that involved a degree of invasion Ahmanet now felt remiss to do. Jenny rolled her eyes. \"Well, I'm kind of wide awake now.\" At that, something in Ahmanet awoke in a different way. \"Then maybe I can... exhaust you, my love.\" She moved forward and enveloped Jenny in another kiss, this one far deeper than the ones before. Jenny moaned in response, and wrapped her arms around Ahmanet as the Egyptian lowered her down... There were still things to worry about. Now they were able to be together in their dreams, what if Jenny saw the vision of herself burning? Would Set try and get to her spiritually? But such questions could wait - now, Ahmanet just wanted to celebrate the truth of the love she had for Jennifer Halsey. They strengthened that love throughout the night, both in the real world and astral plane. And when both awoke the following morning, they found a few more marks gone from Ahamet's face...

His tongue felt thick but his head felt light, and Troy thought numbly that this was a bizarre contradiction. He pushed the cheap plywood of his motel bathroom door back and staggered to the bed. All his limbs were heavy from the alcohol he'd ingested, and he flopped onto the bed with such leaden force that the wooden frame screeched in protest.

They knew each other better than anyone else, in many ways. They understood. Combat or no, soldiers were soldiers - and their bonds were always one-of-a-kind. He had been glad to see Fergus again…. If only it had been for a better reason. He hadn't known what to think when Fergus had first told him the news. He hadn't cried until now - when Troy was right here, in front of him. His friend looked clean - real clean. It wasn't right. Troy wasn't clean; he was a soldier. Swofford remembered him always as his right-hand man in the middle of a desert. The man had felt so at home - in the suck. And if they had been in 'Nam instead, or Europe, it wouldn't have mattered. Troy had loved the soldier's life, almost like Sykes. They had kept in touch after going home - Swoff and Troy. Swoff had needed to make sure Troy was okay. It had seemed like it, though Swoff knew Troy would never have the same joy as he did when he was in the suck. \"I just keep thinkin' of Sykes, man,\" he had said to Swoff. \"Doin' what he loves - livin' in the suck.

Fergus patted his shoulder. \"You should have them. No use puttin' it back in the dirt.\" He turned and left Swofford alone again, to think and mourn.

Every once in a while there will be a \"dear john\" letter, which means a \"Jody\" has made his way into said girls life, or a wife is asking for a divorce. Luckily there hasn't been a dear john letter in 4 months at least. I ignore the rowdy guys in my platoon as they raze on each other, and share pictures of their girls. I go back to reading my book when I hear my name. \"Yo Sarge you have a letter.\" Cortez said waving two white envelopes. I frown at him and said up. When he hands me the letters I look at the name on both. Staff Sgt Lex Winters. The senders address both read from my mother. Before we got deployed I asked her to not write me. I cut off all contact before we left for Afghanistan. Its just easier for me to do my job that way. Standing up I walked out of the the small barrack we call home. I walked to the night watch area and sat down with a sigh. I opened the envelope and started reading: Dear Lex, I hope this letter finds you well. We are having a bit of a drought here, but it will rain eventually. Other then that everything is pretty much the same since you left. You're dad has been very quiet as of late, but I'm sure he's fine. I know you told me not to write but I just had to write anyway. I can't wait to see you honey. Everyone will be so happy when you return. Anyway, tell the boys I send my love, and I hope ya'll are behaving and staying safe. All my love, Mom I fold the letter back up and slip it back in the envelope and grab the next. With a heavy sigh I open it and pull the letter out. My heart sank as I saw my fathers chicken scratch hand writing. I hadn't talked to him since the BBQ my family had before we shipped out. My dearest daughter, How are things? I hope you're doing well and staying safe. I didn't write for small talk, so lets get this over with. I'm sorry I haven't written to you at all these past few months. I finally realized that the other night. I haven't said this out loud, because I don't know if you will come home or not so I will say it now. I am so god damn proud of you. Come home soon. Everyone misses you. Love, Dad I frown at his letter. I wasn't sure how to feel. My fathers a stern, no nonsense kind of guy. He, himself was a lifer in the USMC. He retired as a Major. When I told him I re-enlisted to do 14 months in what the President says is the deadliest place in the world the Korengal Valley in Afghanistan he wasn't happy. I knew he'd never say it but he was terrified. I fold his letter and put it back in the envelope. Lost in my thoughts I didn't hear Cortez walk up. \"Hey Sarge, you have another one.\" Without looking at him I took the 3rd envelope. \"There's no return address.\" I say. Cortez sits on the ground beside me. His silent presents more of a comfort than a burden. With a sigh I open the envelope and pull out the letter. I know instantly who its from. Matt. Before I left we decided to put our relationship on hold. It was more my idea than his. Loyal as ever, he said he'd wait for me. With a sigh I opened the letter: My dearest G.I. Jane, I smiled despite myself. He always calls me G.I. Jane because of my role in the USMC. It's almost 4 am here and I've been laying here all night thinking about you, and where you might be and what you might be doing. I hope you're safe. I miss you terribly. Tonight on the news they did a piece about how the Korengal Valley is the deadliest place on earth. It made me anxious and it didn't help that my dad went on and on about how you shouldn't be there in the first place. Blah, Blah you know how he is. I couldn't sleep after that so I decided to write you even though you told me not too. Ha! I'll be alright. I'm just missing you. Anyway. I love you, and I hope you're doing okay. Always, Matt I could feel Cortez looking at me. I bit my lip to keep the tears at bay. I wasn't sure how I felt about this. Matts letter, my mom's letter, or my dad's. Lucky for me the Captain was calling for a patrol. I got up and went back to our small barracks and put the letter in my foot locker and got ready. Later that night I decided to write my dad back. It was my turn for night watch, so I brought a pad of paper and pen with me. With a sigh I started to write. Dear Dad, Thank you for writing to me. It means a lot even though I told you guys not to write. To hear I make you proud makes this shit a bit easier. Everything is okay here. Obviously I cant tell you more than that. But just know I'm safe. Love, Lex Meh….lol I'm not sure where to put this but Jarhead seemed like a good place. Just a one shot, song fic request. Reviews are welcome! Just don't be a dick.

Fine says Tigra. Alright i just need to pat you down real quick.\" Says the cop. He pats us down then we get in the back. The cop starts talking on his radio. How did he know? Asks Tigra. \"Maybe it's the way we're dressed!\" I reply. Tigra has a sleeveless hoodie and jeans on and i have a sweatshirt and cargo pants. \"Alright guys we didn't find anything i just need to do a background search. \" do you have to?\" Asks Tigra.

Another police car pulls up. The cop gets out grabs tigra and brings him to the back of his car. \"You can move to the front if you want miss. Says the cop.\" I crawl out of the back and into the passenger seat. The cop gets in the front seat. He starts driving. The AC feels nice cause it's a hot night. \"Why were you guys running?\" The cop asks. \"We were scared.\" I say. \" of what?\" Asks the cop. \"Of reality\" i say. hes silent for a bit. He pulls into the parking lot of a building. We get out and walk in the front. The cop go talks to the front desk. I fiddle with one of my ear rings. \"Amber come over here\" says the cop. I walk over to the counter. Your amber jackson right? Asks the girl at the counter. \" the hell you think\" i say. \"Yep this is her\". Says the lady. You're gonna have to go to a foster home in Arkansas tonight sweetie\" says the cop. Tonight? I ask. Yeah sorry says the cop. Zacky: Is this Zack kelly? asks the caller. \"yep who's this?\" \"this is Dora sanchez i'm with the mississippi foster system. We called you a while back about a 14 year old girl who need a place\" says the caller. \"Yeah i remember that why?\" \"well we just got here and were bringer her there.\" says the caller. \"cool thanks.\" i hang up the phone. i walk out the kitchen. \"who was that?\" asks Matthew. \"That was the MFS there bringing a 15 year old girl here.\" i say. \"Yes! finally!\" he hugs me. Matthew got a call about 7 months ago about a girl who lost her parents and needed a home. Before she could get driven here she ran away. I walk up the stairs. i open the door to the 3rd door in the hallway. \"hey Travis.\" i say and sit on a empty bed. \"hi\". he says. \" were going to have a girl come here tonight. We don't have any rooms besides this empty bed. Would you mind if she stayed in here till we find her a room?\" \"cool How old she?\" he asks. \"Shes 14 almost 15.\" i say. \"sure.\" he says. \"thanks so much.\" i say. I make the bed then walk down stairs. Dang! the doorbell rings. \" i ordered pizza\" says Matthew.\" \"cool i say\". He answers the door. \"Kids,dinner!\" i shout. Nicole gets down first wearing denim shorts and a Miami tank top. I don't think she's ever been to Miami. Then Kyle came wearing a Three days grace hoodie and jeans. Then Travis. Then lastly Doug wearing a NY jets hat, Zoo york shirt and khaki shorts. Matthew puts the pizza on the table. \" Want a slice Zacky?\" Asks Matthew. \"No thanks i ate at work.\" I go out the sliding door into the backyard. I light up a Cigarette. It's a beautiful friday night. The air's a little moist and a little cold. The way i like it. Can't wait for another girl. Just hope her criminal record doesn't do to much on us. I'm a Firefighter not a dame lawyer I put my cig out and head back inside. Ding! Rings the doorbell \"That must be her!\" says Matthew. I open the door. A teen girl gets out a taxi. She's wearing a sweatshirt and a hoodie. She also has 5 shiny earrings in her right ear. \"You must be Amber?\" i ask her. \"It's Ringer\". \" Ill show you to your room. Want me to take your bag?\" \"No Thanks i got it.\" she says. we walk up the stairs into Travis's room. \"you'll be staying with Travis.\" \"This is your bed here.\" This is the rooms bathroom here.\" i say pointing at the bathroom door.

I go downstairs. \"I think shes hiding somthing\". i say to Matthew.\" \" You think? he says. Ringer: I take all my clothes off. They haven't been washed in about three months. Covered in blood, dirt, and god knows what else. I turn the water on and hop in. Right when the water hits me it turns brown washing all the dirt off. OMG i can't believe that i'm here enjoying myself while Tigras in jail or somewhere. I hear the guy who showed me my room walk in and grab my clothes. \"travis? guy thats nice? anybody?\" Nobody responds. complete silence. The way i like it. I sit down in the shower and think about what i've been through. I can't take it anymore. After a long time i do it. I cry. I dont know whats tears or shower water but i know i'm crying. on the inside. I dry off when i get out. I go into the room my beds in with a towel on. \"that was quick says kyle.\" I nod at him. Your clothes arnt ready yet wanna borrow a shirt and pants?\" Travis asks. \" yeah\" i say. He hands me some gym shorts and a eminem muscle shirt. \"Thanks\" i say. I take the twel off and put the shirt on then the shorts. I look at Travis. He looks shocked. \"What\"? i ask. \"nothing\" he says. I check my phone. 1 text. Nathan: Dude WTF is going on. Me: A cop got us. Tigra got sent to the lockup. i'm in Arkansas Nathan: WTF arkansas?! Me: i'll explain sometime next week. A guy about twenty years old walks in. I put my phone away. \" Im Matthew.

I shut their door and head to my room. I unzip my hoodie and throw it on the side of my bed. Zacky comes in. He gets in bed next to me. \" this girl seems quiet.\" Zacky says \"i know\" i say. \"Everybody has their reasons\" says a voice. I turn and see kyle. \"oh shoot you scared us Ky\" says Zacky. \"Sorry didn't try too\" he says. \"it's good\" i say. Kyle leaves. \"how the hell did that kid sneak up so quietly?\" asks Zacky. \"Everybody has there reasons.\" i say. Zacky turns the light off. Ringer: *BAM!* Metal flys everywhere. \"Come on girl you can make it!\" shouts Tigra. I see a bright light. My mind starts moving towards it. I can't stop myself. Right when i hit the light my eyes open. I shoot up in my bed. \"Dame you alright fam?\" asks a kid playing cards with Travis. \" yeah i had a nightmare.\" i say. \" I have those to\" says Travis. I get out of bed and throw a shirt and denim shorts on. \"There's some Oj and pancakes on the counter downstairs\" says the kid with Travis. I go down the stairs. i grab a pancake and oj. The kid who was with Travis comes downstairs. \"I'm kyle by the way\" he says. \" I'm Ringer.\" i say Kyle grabs a bottle of pills and takes 2 pills. \" what meds are those?\" i ask. \" There Aspirins\". says kyle. \"Arnt aspirins a circle not a bean shape?' i ask. \"i don't know\" he says. I finish my breakfast and put my dishes in the sink. \"Wanna go for a walk with me and Kyle?\" asks Travis. \"sure\" i reply. I put my muddy shoes on and wait on the steps. \"hey\" says Travis. i nod my head at him. \"Did you sleep well last night i hope i'm a good roommate.\" \"You were alright.\" i Reply. \"So where are we going?\" i ask.\" Well Matthew wants us to bring you to the PD so you can meet your parole officer.

Its beautiful today, wish i could live forever. \"You know the goal of life isn't to live forever its to create something that will.\" Says kyle. We take a right turn then walk through the parking lot, to the front of the police building. We walk in and the AC hits us. Kyle: \"Come to the desk here.\" I say \"Hi\". i say. \"Hey kyle! Are you here for officer Jones?\" asks the lady behind the desk. \"No i'm just here with my friend whose meeting her new parole officer.\" I say \"What's her name?\" Its funny cause i barely know her name. \"Its amber i think?\" I say. She does some typing in her computer. \"Amber gates?\" She asks. I think… \"Yeah\" interrupts Amber. Alright officer Venendez will be here soon just wait on the benches over there. We sit down. I can't help but make a joke. \"Hey ms Gates!\" \"Shut up or i'll neuter you in your sleep!\" She threatens. \"Feisty!\" Says Travis. \"So whats up with this shit.\" She asks. \"Foster care parole says you have to have a meeting with your parole officer every two weeks. \"Fuck this shit\" Ringer says. \"Feisty!\" Says travis Ringer: I get up to leave when a cop walks over. \"Hey kyle\" \"Hi Cass This is Amber but we all call her Ringer.

The name plate outside says Jones/Venendez. \"Hi i'm Ansell Venendez.\" He says Shaking Kyle's hand. \"I don't do hand shakes\" i say. \"Oh\" he says. Officer jones pulls a laptop out. \"So how are are you liking Arkansas so far?\" Asks Venendez \"Its boring and hot here.\" i say. \"That's the same way i felt when i came here. Venendez says. He has a nice spanish tan skin color. A nice body build and he has the front of his black hair up in a slick. \"Alright i'm logged in.

He looks at a sheet. \" So we already know your name… Whens your birthday? \"July 4th, 1997.\" \"Have you been outside of the country in the last year?\" \"Yeah in Ciudad Juarez.\" \"Why were you there?\" \"I was on vacation.\" \"That's not the safest town for vacation\" \"Neither is arkansas\". \"Which Family members are still alive?\" \"My Older and younger brother.\" I say. \" Mom and dads\"? \"Nope\" i say. \"Alright\". \"Are you on medications?\" \" I was on RX\". \"You have charges for selling Firearms and assaulting a officer. Was there any reasoning for these crimes?\" I was bored and needed money and i didn't like the cop. \"Alright\". Officer jones is trying not to laugh. \"So you went to juvie for selling firearms for how long? \" A year.\" Alright. And one last question. Last night you were stopped by a cop? \"Yes\". \"He said you guys were nervous and running from where a Store was robbed a gunpoint.\" \"Were you involved in the robbery in anyway?\" \"No sir me and my friend Tigra where jogging. Dame just cause i dont have a apron on and in your kitchen am i a criminal?\" \" No\" Officer venendez says. \"Did you like that cop?\" Asks jones laughing. \"He was better than you guys.\" \"Oh damn\". Venendez says. \"Your friend Tigra said you guys where in the store but weren't robbing it.\" \"Just tell us the truth\". \"The truth here goes a long way.\" Says Jones \"We were in the store and made a run for it. \" i say. \"Why did you tell the cop and us you were jogging? \"I didn't want my friend Tigra to get in trouble.\" \"Why are you nervous right now?\" Asks Jones. \"Fuck you guys\". I say getting out of my seat to leave. Kyle: Travis follows after Amber. \"Dame\" says Venendez. \"Sometimes people can get mad.\" \"Fight or flight?\" I ask. \"If it was Fight or flight here me and Venendez would be getting our asses kicked\" Says Jones. We all laugh. Amber and travis come back in. \"Alright so we don't have any other questions.\" Venendez says. \"How it works is Venendez is your parole officer but i'm the Student resources officer at your school. If you ever need me just ask your teacher and i'll tell them to dismiss you whenever\" Jones says to Amber. \"Its how i get out of hard tests. I say. Jones and venedez laugh. \"So that's all you guys are free to go. Monday: Me and Amber are waiting for the bus. I have my headphones in listening to AC DC Thunderstruck. The yellow bus pulls around the corner. Ambers wearing a black hoodie and blue jeans. The bus stops in front of us. We go up the steps. Amber sits in the back. I sit next to Tobias. He's snapping his fingers to a beat. \"Hey bro\" he says. \"Hi\" Hows the drum solo coming along?\" I ask \"Good\" he says. Ringer: I sit in a seat by myself. \"Wassup i'm Diego says a kid across from me. He has double ear piercings and a lip peircing. Welcome to the shittiest school alive.\" If u want to sneak out hit me up he says handing me a piece of paper with his number on it. I shove it in my pocket. \"Thanks.\" I say. The bus stops outside of the school. Kyle's waiting for me when i get off the bus. \"Follow doug he's has the same classes as you for now alright?. Kyle says pointing at a kid with a LA kings shirt,jeans, and purple sneakers. \"Alright\" i say. \"Hey Amber\" he says. \"Its Ringer to you\". I say. \"Why do you only let some people call you amber and some Ringer?\" He asks. \"Some people i trust some i don't\" I say. \"Or is it you have a crush on some and some you don't? He says. \"Your lucky i'm letting that slide\" i say. \"Alright Ringer.\" We go down a staircase. \"If you ever get bored before class you can skip the start. Newbies don't get tardies for the first week and the people who help them.\" He says bringing his eyebrow up and down. \"Ha so funny\". I say in a stupid voice. \"Here's my locker.\" He says. He opens it. \"Yours is next to mine the codes 2- 47.\" he says looking at his sheet. I spin the lock left to two then right to 47 then back left. The lock stops and i open the locker. I throw my empty backpack in my locker and grab a pencil. \"Are first class is gym.\" Doug says. Doug leads me start walking towards the gym. When i'm walking down the hall i see group of girls looking at me. One girl whispers to the group and the group laughs. I walk over to the group. \"You got a problem?\" I ask to the girl who was whispering. \"No\" she says nervously. \"That's what i thought.\" I say \"Lets keep going Ringer.\" Doug says. We walk through some doors into a big gymnasium. \"Hey mr tyian!\" Shouts doug. A tall guy with a goatee in gym shorts and jogging shirt walks over to us. \"Hey Doug who's this? Asks the teacher. \"This is Ringer she's a new student\" he says. \"Pleased to meet you\" he says. He walks off. \"I have to go get dressed for gym i'll BRB\" he says leaving. Zacky: I wake up and get out of bed. All the kids are gone for school. I go downstairs. I put some bread in the toaster. I check my phone. Katelynn 6:37 AM: Heard there's a new addition! Katelynn 6:45 AM: I'll be there around 11 so we can talk Officer Vendendez: Hey I'm Ambers Parole officer. Katelynn invited me over so we can have a chat about her. See you soon she's a great girl :) I look at the phone time 11:03. Oh crap! Matthew wake up! I shout. I look out the window Katelynns car is pulling in. Oh no! Matthew comes running down the stairs. \"Whats wrong?! He asks. \"Katelynns going to be here at 11:00 for a meeting. \"What time is it right now? He asks. \"11:04.\" I say Oh crap! He shouts. The doorbell goes off. I answer it. \"Hey Kate i say. \" Hi nice boxers she says. I look down i have a Arkansas fire shirt and plaid boxers. \"Haha sorry i just woke up. I say. \"Its cool she says. Smiling. I run upstairs and throw a pair of jeans on and run back down stairs. Matthew and Kate are talking. I sit down next to them. Katelynn has a Falling angels sweatshirt and leggings on. I love the way how she died some white streaks into her black hair. \"So how was the first day? She asks. \"It was nice.\" I say. \"Better than i expected.\" Says Matthew. \"Good\" she says. Ringer: \"Last class of the day\" says Doug I don't have BOT. Doug says. Kyle walks out of Ms Tailors class. \"Right i'll take her up there. We walk up two stair cases. \"What's BOT?\" I ask. \"Back on track\" Kyle says. Its for us lucky Parole kids and others who are close to parole. Who else in the class is on parole? I ask. \"Nobody but us. Were the superiors.\" He says. We both laugh. \"The teacher is officer Jones.\" Kyle says. \"Hell yeah!\" I say. Kyle smiles. Jones is holding the door open for students when we walk in. \"Hey amb.. Ringer! I expect alot from you. \" Jones says. I laugh. Me and kyle put are books on our desks. I stand in the back. Diego comes in. he puts his books on his desk and stands in the back next to me. The bell rings. \"Alright kids we have a lot today!\" Jones says. \"Let's start by meeting our new student.\" He says. In the back is Ringer. She just moved here from Mississippi. She's on parole which is why she's here. Any questions? A kid raises his hand. \"Adam?\" Says jones. \"What are you on parole for? Adam asks\" \" Drugs i say strutting around the back. \"Most Parolees suffer from addiction.\" Jones says. \"I don't suffer from an addiction. I enjoy every second of it!\" I say. Kyle and Diego crack up laughing. Officer jones shakes his head and continues with class. \"So today everybody has to find a partner and i'm going to give you guys a scene. I want you guys to react it and find a negative solution the way you guys would and then choose a better option.\" Says jones. He gives kyle a paper. \" a popular kid wants you to come and smoke a pack with them. You know you can get caught but you'll look so cool.\" Kyle reads \"Positive and negative? He asks. Positive is to just like say no and get bullied and look like a mommas boy.. slightly negative is to not be a wuss and light it up with them. I say. \"Smart idea but not dialogue\". Says Jones scaring me. \"I'm trying my best. it's what you're expecting. I say. When the bell rings me and Kyle left the class quickly. He sits next to me on the bus. \"I'm so ready to go home\" i say. \"I agree\" kyle says. We get of the bus and walk up the driveway. When we walk in there's a girl with black and white hair. Sitting next to her is Officer Venendez. On the other side of the counter is Zacky and Matt. \"Hey guys. Go up and do your homework and when you're dong Amber come and join us.\" \"Am i in trouble?\" I ask looking at Venendez. \"No were just talking\". Matthew: \"So we have suspicion that she was involved in a robbery and she wont tell us anything.\" Says Office Venendez. \"Probably. She's been really nervous lately. I say. \"How do you know what she's really like?\" Asks Katlynn. \"Well most kids like Doug arent that nervous coming here.\" I say. \"Well doug's only here cause his mom can't fix her alcoholism problems. I think Amber's parents and her were in a car crash and her parents died. Also she's been on the streets since then and she hasn't been to a foster home before! Debates Katelynn. \"Yeah you're right but i mean we just have to be careful.\" \"She was pretty careful with what she was saying though when we talked.\" Says Officer Venendez. \"I think we all just need to give her some time and we can see who she really is.\" \"It's gonna be hard because of school! Says Katelynn. \"They get out for summer Wednesday.\" I respond. \"She's nice but after all she's been through she's seen the true life. If you, don't fight back life will knock you out.\" Says Officer Venendez. \"You're right.\" i say. \"I'm here now.\" Says Amber coming down the stairs. \"Cool, take a seat.\" I reply \"So for the rest of the week it's going to look like this. You're going to go to school then on wednesday i'm going to pick you and Kyle up cause you both have doctors appointments. I say Then it's summer! Shouts Kyle from the other room. \"And you guys also can come by the police station wednesday\". Says Officer Venendez. \"Cool\". Says kyle. Officer Venendez's radio goes off. \"I got to go\" says Officer venendez. Katelynn: Thanks for coming by Ansell. I say hugging him. He shakes Matthew and Zackys hand then leaves. \"I might go to soon.\" I say \"Whenever you'd like to.\" Says Matthew. Can i say bye to Trav? I ask. \"I think he's in his room.\" Zacky says. I go up the stairs. *Knock**Knock*. \"Come in!\" Says trav. Hey Cutie!\" I say to Trav. He purses his lips. \"Hey\" he says. \"I'm about to leave so give me a hug!\" I say. He hugs me and i kiss his cheek. \"Have a good week.\" I say. \"Bye love you Mom\" He replies. Amber: I get out of the shower and go into my room. \"Oh sorry we didn't know you were in the shower! \"Says Kyle looking away. I laugh. \"Don't be a wuss\" i say throwing some clothes on. Zacky comes in. \"It's time for bed guys.\" He says. I get into bed. Zacky leaves. \"Night\" kyle says leaving. \"Wait! I say. \"Whats up? He asks looking into my eyes. \"Good night.\" I say. 10:03 pm Diego: Ay Kyle gave me yo number. I'm to tired to reply to the text so i go to bed. *BAM* metal flys everywhere. Police lights all over. \"You can make it girl!\" shouts Tigra. I see a light i start to go towards it hoping it will wake me up. I hit the light. \"Wake up time for school! Matthew calls. I roll out of bed and get dressed. I go downstairs. \"Come get some breakfast\" says Zacky. \"I'm not hungry\" i say. Kyle puts his dishes away. \" can Me and her walk to school?\" Kyle asks. \"Sure\" Matthew says. We walk out the door with our backpacks over our shoulder. I feel swag. Kyle's wearing a flannel button up shirt and jeans. His hair is covering up his cute face… well his face. Kyle: I thought she would like to see the city's great \"Scenery\". \"So how's the town?\" i ask. \"Its boring here.\" says Amber. \"You'll get use to it.\" i reply. We get to school and we put our stuff in our lockers. I'll see you at the end of the day?\" i asks. \"Sure at the best class in the world.\" she says. I laugh. We get to the final class of the day. Ambers waiting for me outside. \"What's up\" i say. \"Hey\" she says. We go into the room. Jones is sitting at his desk with his legs up on the table. \" Hey guys\" he says. I put my books on my desks and isit in my chair. Diego is already in his seat talking to Amber. Officer Jones walks over \"Hows school?\" Asks jones. \"Its boring.\" i say. He laughs. \" I know the struggle.\" \"yeah\" i reply. \"So do you know anything about her?\" He asks. \"Her?\" i ask even though i know who he's talking about. \"Amber.\" he says. \"No not really, but i don't need to.\" I reply. \"Okay\". He replies. Officer Jones walks to the front of the room. Amber: \"Alright class. Today we're gonna learn about why school is important.\" \"Do we have to?\" i ask. \"No but you can go to detention if you'd like?\" \"No thanks\" i reply. I get out of school and Matthews waiting for me and Kyle. \"Who's ready for the doctor?\" says matthew. \"Not us\" Says Kyle. \"How was school?\" he asks. \"Boring\" i say. \"Yep\" says Kyle. \"Learn about anything?\" Matthew asks \"Why school is important.\" i say.

I feel his hand touch mine. I end up holding hands with him. \" Kyle and Amber\" Says a nurse. She has brown curly hair that goes to her shoulders. We walk up the hall with her. \"In here\" she saids. \"Take off your shoes we have to check your height and weight\" She says. I slide off my dirty sneakers. \"Kyle you can go first. \"Alright\" he says. \"You're height first.\" he steps on a platform and the doctor moves the scale bars down to his height. \"Five feet eight inches\" says the doctor. \"Now for weight.\" says the nurse. Kyle steps up on a weight. The doctor moves the small bars around. \"111 pounds\" says the nurse. \"Now it's your turn amber. Step over here with your back against the wall.\" says the nurse now for your weight please step on the scale. I take a deep breath in and step on the scale. \"You're weight is..\" She moves the bars around \"99 pounds dame\" says the nurse. \"Just wait in the room until the doctor comes.\" We go and sit down. \"How are you so damn light?\" asks Matthew. \"I don't know\" i say back.

She types something into the computer. Zacky: Matthew and I walk into Amber and travis's room. Here's her backpack says Matthew. I open it and dump the contents on the bed. There's a picture of amber and somebody smiling on a beach. There's also a picture of what looks like her and her family There's a few notes also I pick one up and read it Dear veotex How are things in iraq? I miss you so much. We haven't had much of rain.

Love you always- Amber I feel my eyes get watery. There's also a marine commendation and a purple heart medal. I put the contents back into the backpack and we leave there room. \"Hey there Ringer how's it going?\" asks Ansell. \"Cut to the chase\" i say \"Listen i need the truth about what happened that night when you robbed that store.\" \" I didn't rob the fucking store dumbass!\" i shout. \"Sorry\" he says. \"Anything else\" i ask. \"Tell me everything you did that night.\" he says. \"I went for a run with my homie and your dumbass friends stopped me. Officer jones \"One second\" i hear Ansell say walking out the room \"Have fun fucking yourself\" Ringer says. \"I didn't get anything yet\" He says. \" Kyle said he hasn't heard anything either.\" i say \"Now what are we gonna do\" Ansell asks. A idea pops up. \"Switch people\" i say. \"Wait what? Asks ansell \"I'm gonna identify what gang she's with by her tattoos its easy\" i say \"Alright.\" he replies I walk into the room. \"Hello Amber: i say. \"It's ringer fuck you\" she says sitting in a desk chair with her feet up on the desk. \"So where did you get these tattoos from Ringer\" i ask. She hides her arm tattoo. \"Hey just let me see.\" i say pulling her arm away. A snake wrapped around a sword. I pull a binder out from the desk. \"Hmm lets see here.\" i say I find a black snake wrapped around a sword. \"Hmm the CK same gang involved in the store robbery. \"Crew krew for life.\" says says \"Well would you like to say anything\" i ask. \" I have the right to remain silent\" she says giving me a double middle finger. Ringer I go to skippys. Nathan's standing in the shadow smoking a joint. He drops it and gives me a hug. \"Hey there Ringa\" he says in a country accent. \"Lets go\" i say. We get into a mercedes benz. \"Where's the porsche?\"\" i ask. \" I left it cause we're gonna have some fun\" he says laying rubber in front of a cop. He pulls us over. \"You go right i go left?\" i say. \"Yep.\" he says. We open the doors and run as fast as we can. The cop goes after me. I run into the forest the cop keeps following me. We run out the woods and Nathans waitin for me in the car he got back into and we speed away. We went back to Nathan's house. He passes me a bottle of whiskey. I take a swag and i feel the fire burn my throat hard. \"Like the good ol days? He asks. \"Yep\". i reply. I fall asleep. Were driving on a road and my dad's diving while also drinking. My mom's telling him to stop. BAM! Metal goes fly all over. I wake up in a hospital bed Tigras next to me. Come on Amber please wake up i need you. 2 weeks later It's around 7:00 pm and raining. I walk up behind the police station. Kyle's laying on the ground sleeping. I walk up to him.\"Hey dumbass this isn't your bed. I say. He's still asleep. I shake him \"hey wake up!\" i say louder still no response. Then i see the grass is covered in blood from his arms. Then i realize he's not sleeping. \"No wake up please. i shout knowing nothing will happen. I pick up his razor blade. I lay next to him. My wrist stinging with every swipe. Then i fall back. My dad's driving and drinking. My mom's telling him to stop. BAM! Metl goes fly all over.

Then the doctor telling me that my parents died. Then me running out the hospital to freedom to get away from reality. I wake up in my bed. Travis not next to me. I go down stairs. I walk out onto the patio. Zackys there smoking a cigarette. \"Can i get one\" i ask. He hands me a cigarette. I light it. I feel the smoke in my lungs but it doesnt take away the pain.

Why can't I just go out to the park for a bit of fun? I swear I am not going to attack someone! Geeze! You treat me like I am a child for goodness sake!\" I briskly stormed after my mother while holding my black trench coat in the crook of my left arm. \"Ithica, you know how temperamental you get if someone looks at you the wrong way. I will not have you put us in danger for your sake of fun! Now go to your room! I will call you down when I have supper on the table.\" My mom ordered as she turned to face me with a stern look. \"But-\" \"I said no. Now go to your room. Your father will be home shortly.\" I threw my hands up in the air and stormed out of the doorway of the kitchen and pushed passed my dad as he walked in the small apartment. \"I don't get a hello?\" He asked me as I stomped up the stair case to go to my room. \"Go choke on supper! The both of you!\" I spat down and slammed the door to my room. My dad sighed and shook his head as he set his stack of sketch books down on the living room couch. \"Vivian! What did you and Ithica get into now?\" He asked as he stepped into the kitchen to end up seeing his wife taking pasta off the stove and pouring it into a colander so that the water spilled through the many small holes in the metal bowl. \"Aiden, you know as well as I do that she is unstable like Rafe was.\" Vivian turned off the burners on the stove and set the pasta sauce on the counter; before pouring it into a bowl to be put on the table. \"Yes I know that. But what has gotten her all upset this time? Did she get in a fight? Arrested for being a disturbance? What?\" \"She wanted to go out. Aiden. It is 7:00 at night and she claims she wants to go out to the park for 5 hours! That is until midnight! Midnight! And tonight of all nights! It is going to be a full moon, Aiden. She is thinking on hunting. Did you know? She told me the other night. She is curious on what it is like to go on a hunt.\" Vivian put her hand on her mouth to try and hide the fact that she was upset and distraught. \"You know as well as I do she has Loup-garoux blood in her. You know that some day she will want to run free, back to my people.\" Tears now streamed down her face as she leaned into her husband's arms. \"Vivian. Everything is all right. How about I talk to her?\" Aiden whispered gently. \"I just don't want to lose her.\" She mumbled. I sighed as I plopped down onto my bed. I threw my coat on the floor and began to fiddle around with my hands. I was too upset to think about anything but having a shot glass filled with Absinthe. I closed my eyes and pictured the cool green liquid being poured down my throat. I could almost taste the beverage; this made me crave it even more. I opened my eyes and looked about my room. I got to my feet and then knelt down and reached under my bed. I grasped the smooth neck of a glass bottle; I smiled and pulled it out into the open. It was a liter of Absinthe. I opened the bottle and dropped the cap on the mattress. Then I slowly put the bottle to my lips and slowly poured a mouthful of the green beverage into my mouth. Before swallowing I capped the bottle and hid it back underneath my bed. Then knowing everything was in the clear and savoring the bitter taste; I swallowed. I sighed, now satisfied for the moment; everything was put on hold when I heard footsteps coming straight for my room. I quickly got to my feet and walked over to my window and looked out; I did this whenever I knew I was going to get a lecture about spouting off at mother. But this time, the footsteps told me that dad was going to wear the pants and ring me out for talking back at mom and spouting off at him. \"Ithica? Sweety? Can I come in?\" I heard the muffled voice of my dad at my bedroom door. I didn't answer. Then the sound of my door slowly swinging open came to hearing. \"Ithica? Honey, what happened between you and your mother?\" I heard my dad sit himself down on my bed. I closed my eyes and took a deep breath; then I slowly opened my eyes. My reflection showed that my eyes turned yellow. \"Nothing. Nothing happened.\" I spoke in a hushed tone. I kept my eyes out the window and focused on the eastern-horizon that was ready to present the night moon. I could feel my heart rate increase making me work harder in order to keep my breathing under control. \"Ithica. Don't lie to me. Something went on with you and your mother. Now speak up and tell me.\" \"I said Nothing happened!\" I slightly raised my voice to stress my point. \"Now can I go out to the park for a jog?\" I asked now showing my slight irritation. I turned around to face my dad with only one eye yellow and the other blue. My dad looked at me with some shock and then stood up and walked over to the doorway. \"Why are you looking at me as if I am some sort of beast?\" My dad didn't answer. \"Are you saying that I am a beast? Huh!\" I threw my hands up in the air. \"I didn't say that you were a beast-\" \"Then why are you acting like you are scared of me all of a sudden?\" I was now shouting and had stalked to the middle of the room. \"What is going on up here?\" my mom showed up and looked at her husband and then to me. \"Ithica? Darling? What is going on?\" \"Ask him! He is the one acting weird here! ASK HIM!\" I screamed some more while pointing at my father. Vivian stared at me with a concerned expression and then turned to her husband, Aiden. \"Aiden?\" She whispered. \"Vivian. There is something different about our daughter. Can't you sense it? Look at her! Her eyes!\" Aiden pointed back at me and spoke as if he was going to be late to some big event. Then I watched as my mother walked up to me and peered into my eyes as if searching for something. \"I don't - . Oh. A Loup-garoux as well.\" she murmured as she slowly touched her bottom lip with her index and middle fingers. \"Loup-garoux. Is that all you can say. MOTHER!\" I spat. \"I knew I was a Loup-garoux, ever since I was five. Where have you been?\" I chuckled. \"What have you been up to?\" Vivian began to sound irritated in her worried state. \"You are not yourself. What have you been taking?\" I didn't answer and just shrugged. \"Nothing. Nothing of any interest.\" I stretched my arms over my head before standing straight once more. \"Aiden.\" Vivian was quite short with her words at this point and needed to investigate on my on goings. I looked at my father with no interest what so ever and sighed. My father walked over to me and then walked over to my bed. I watched him with an emotionless expression; I didn't know what to think at this point. Then I watched as he bent down and looked under my bed. \"What's this?\" Aiden sounded surprised as he pulled out the opened liter bottle of Absinthe. \"Ithica?\" He turned and showed the bottle to the both of us. I didn't answer and refused to look at my astonished mother who now stood next to my father. \"Absinthe...\" Vivian whispered breathlessly. Her hands shook as she took the bottle from her husband and examined the half full glass container. \"Ithica, where did you get this?\" Her voice shook as if she was horrified to see the bitter liqueur. I remained silent. \"Where did you get this, Ithica?\" she rose her voice as if she was in a haste to get an answer. \"Why should I tell you? You never were interested in what I did before. This is no different.\" I growled as I spoke. \"Because this can kill you if you have too much!\" My mother shouted. \"Will you can it VIVIAN! I know how to use the stuff! How would you know about Absinthe if you claimed you never had it? Huh? You had it before. Otherwise you wouldn't have known what this is!\" I shouted. \"WATCH YOUR TONE WITH YOUR MOTHER!\" My father shouted and slapped me across the face. My head flew to the side from the blow. I hung my head low and tried to control my temper. \"You really are stupid. Aren't you MEAT!\" I lifted my head and showed that both of my eyes grew a deep yellow and looked wild. \"Look at what you did!\" At that moment; Aiden saw the memory of Rafe before he fought and died in Silestru Chapel in Romania flashed before his eyes. I had matched what my dead cousin's attitude toward humans. I was locked inside my room until I would calm down; but both of my parents knew full well that it would take a long time for me to get a grip on myself. I paced back and forth from wall to wall in my room; just the thought of knowing that I was stuck here and my parents were eating a nice warm dinner made my blood boil even more. I looked at my bedroom clock; it read 11:30pm. I had to get out of my room; my yearning to hunt turned my feeling from irritation to becoming savage. \"I refuse to be leashed and caged because of you, mother.\" I spat out my whispered thought and grabbed my long black trench coat. Then with a quick look around my room; I grabbed all of my money that was now stuffed into my wallet and into my coat pocket. I then opened up my backpack and dumped all its contents onto my bed and began stuffing an assortment of clothes into it as well as some jewelry and a spare bottle of Absinthe that my parents failed to find. I then zipped my pack closed and slung it on my back. I held my coat in my arms and walked over to the window. \"I'm bustin' outta here even if it means me dying trying.\" I gritted as I forced the old window open. Then with little effort I crawled out onto the porch roof. I looked around to make sure that no one I knew was going to rat out on me. I looked up at the full moon that was now high in the starless night sky and felt drawn to it. I then sucked in a deep breath and leapt down from my perch and climbed into my father's car. I locked the doors and dropped my bag on the passenger seat next to me. I looked out the tinted window of the car and saw that no one noticed that I was going to steal the car. I licked my lips and turned the key in the ignition and listened gleefully as the engine roared to life. Just then I noticed that the front lights in my house turned on and I saw my parents looking out the window. I felt my heart stop and I watched as my father opened the front door and began to approach the car; my mind froze and I quickly looked forward and slammed the car out of park and into drive and sped off down the road. I could hear my father shouting as well as my heart rapidly beating. Now that I had escaped my parents for the meantime, I had to figure out where to go. I had to find the rest of my kind; I knew they were somewhere; otherwise I would have been a regular teenaged girl. I sped off toward my mother's native country; Romania. Bucharest, Romania. That was South East from Paris and a long way. So I was planning on some pit-stops on the way.[Chapter 2] Nurnberg, Germany I parked the car in a parking lot that was located on the outside of a grocery store. I sighed and folded back several stray strands of hair and tucked them behind my ear. I turned the car off and looked out my window and settled my gaze on the small building which held my needed supplies. I yanked out the keys from the ignition and grabbed my trench coat and got out of the car. After locking the car; I shrugged into the heavy black coat and buttoned it up to stave off the night chill. I had driven non-stop from Paris and it took me a whole day to find my way this far. I exhaled allowing the white mist to fly away from my mouth. I walked briskly toward the entrance of the building; I opened the door and walked inside and looked around to see where I should start my search. It was quiet inside, and there were hardly any shoppers. I scanned through the many isles and found some supplies I needed: pears, bananas, peanut butter, a loaf of bread, several bottles of soda, and a raw five pound steak. I cradled my goods in my arms and brought them to the cashier. He glanced at me and then went to work scanning the items and bagging them. He didn't say a single word throughout the whole process. \"That will be 45 deutsche.\" He promptly said and waited for me to give him the proper amount of money. I looked down at my pocket and reached in and pulled out some money. I handed it to him and watched silently as counted and examined the currency I had to offer. \"This is the euro.\" He said flatly. \"That is the only money I have…\" \"We don't take the euro. You don't have the deutsche; you don't get your groceries.\" \"But-\" \"That is all miss. Now if you don't have the money then leave!\" He growled. I could feel my temper growing and adrenaline racing through my veins. I tried to control my breathing and grabbed my money and shoved it back into my pocket. Then without looking up at him; I grabbed my two bags of groceries and started walking away. Before I got anywhere near the door, a hand grasped my right wrist and held onto it with an iron grip. \"Hey ma'am; this does NOT belong to you! You didn't pay and now if you don't remove your grip from the bags, I will be forced to call the police.\" I kept my gaze on the floor and tightened my grip on the plastic grocery bags. Then before the young man could try and grab the bags out of my hands; I swung around and punched him hard in the face. On impact, he let go of my wrist and stumbled back a few paces. When he got his bearings, he looked back at me and saw that my eyes were yellow. He swallowed hard and tried to stutter out an apology. But it was too late. I dropped my bags and leapt at him; when I was in midair, I transformed into a wolf and landed a few paces away from the trembling cashier. I bared my teeth and growled low. I began to stalk toward him, as I got closer he began to back away slowly until he hit a shelf that contained candy bars. Then he stumbled and fell onto his backside. I watched silently as I steadily crept forward. Sweat beaded on his forehead; I sniffed the air inches from his face. He flinched and tried to move to the side; I saw this and growled and showed my teeth once more. He stopped what he was doing and kept still. I lowered my head and licked my lips and growled while I opened my mouth to show how serious I was about the fact of possibly killing him. \"I'm sorry. You can have everything. You don't have to pay. I won't tell anyone. Just don't kill me.\" He stuttered. I lifted my head and closed my mouth and stared at him. I perked my ears up and titled my head to the side; as if I was considering taking his offer. I watched him as he smiled out of fear and slight relief. Then thinking of the better of the two evils; I decided not to take the chance of him calling the police if I let him live. I straightened my head; showing that I had made my decision and that it was final. I growled and peeled back my lips to show my teeth. I pressed my ears back against my head and lowered it as I stalked back and forth in front of the cashier. \"What are you doing? Wait!\" Then without any hesitation, I pounced and started ripping and clawing at his flesh. His screams were surprisingly music to my ears, his blood tasted rich with iron and his flesh seemed to melt in my mouth like chocolate. After a couple minutes he lay dead on the floor next to the candy shelf surrounded by a huge pool of his own blood. I licked my lips and walked away; as I did, I transformed back into my human form. I was completely naked; I looked around and found my clothes. I picked up each article of clothing one by one and dressed myself. Once I was fully clothed; I shrugged back into my trench coat and picked up my bags of groceries. Before I left I looked back at the lifeless body of the cashier. I sighed and walked over to him; I looked down at him and then reached out and grabbed a huge handful of candy bars. Then stuffed them into the plastic bags and then turned and left the building. I unlocked my car and climbed in. I turned the key and the car once again came to life. I shifted into reverse and backed out before I shifted again into drive and sped off to continue my journey to Bucharest, Romania. Bucharest, Romania 2 days later \"Zion. It is time to get up. Your brother is waiting for you outside at the car.\" Astrid whispered to her younger son. Before the death of Gabriel, she had conceived twin boys; the last of Gabriel's line since Rafe was murdered by Aiden. She had named her twin sons: Chief, being the eldest of the twins and the first to be the new leader of the pack when he and his brother become of age. Then there was Zion; the youngest of the twins, though he was younger, he seemed to take more after his father in not only appearance, but in his actions and attitude. Chief resembled more of his mother and was more lax about things unless his opinion or authority was challenged. But nonetheless, Zion seemed to be his mother's favorite, she would fuss over him more than Chief; knowing that Zion would need more guidance since he would have to learn how to be a good leader when his time came. But for now he had to stay in his brother's shadow for a time; and be a part of the pack. Zion opened one eye and looked up at his mother; he smiled tiredly and sighed as he lifted his head off the pillow. \"What time is it?\" he yawned. \"8:00, honey. Chief is waiting for you. You need to go with him to the bar and discuss with each other who shall be the next human to be prey. Now hurry and get dressed.\" Astrid got to her feet and stroked her son's head once before leaving the room. Zion sighed and pulled the blankets off of him. He got into a sitting position and took a deep breath before exhaling. He got to his feet and walked over to his dresser, then opened a drawer and pulled out a black t-shirt. He shifted the shirt around in his hands before pulling it over his head and shrugging into it. Then he reached over to his desk chair and grabbed his pair of pants. Then he stepped into them and began to walk out of his room while fastening the button and zipping the zipper into its proper place. Zion didn't even bother to brush his dark brown hair; it never did what he wanted it to do. His hair was very rebellious in the way that it hung about his jaw line and was wavy with some curls toward the ends. Unlike his older brother Chief; who kept his hair neater and had it cut shorter. Chief's hair color was more of a sandy color, yet it managed to appear as a shade lighter than Zion's. Before Zion left he quickly strode over to his mother and hugged her while grabbing an orange. Then he gave her a peck on the cheek and wished her farewell before jogging out the door to meet his impatient brother, who was leaning on the side of the car with his arms crossed. \"What took you so long? You can be so slow when it comes to things that I have to do for the sake of the pack.\" Chief hastily climbed into the car and turned it on while his brother got in the passenger seat. When both brothers were inside the car; Chief shifted the car out of park and sped off toward the bar. \"What is your problem, Chief? Just because I got up later than you and had to get some breakfast, doesn't mean I hate being a part of the pack or don't care about them. I care about the pack as much as you do.\" Zion said while peeling the orange. Zion then peeled the meat of the fruit a part and then began to devour the tangy citrus fruit. Secretly Zion knew that Chief was jealous of him since he was Astrid's favorite and got the most attention from the females in the pack; all of them adored him, all except Charr. She was Chief's girlfriend. She was the opposite of Chief; she constantly had a fiery disposition toward anything that she didn't seem to agree with. \"Whatever, Zion. Let's just get this done and over with for tonight.\" Chief stopped the car outside this huge warehouse, which was actually a huge bar that the pack mostly inhabited when night fell on the city. Both Loup-garoux brothers stepped out of the car and were greeted by their hit men. The hit men knelt down onto their knees and showed their throats out of respect. Knowing that they were the children of their long passed leader, Gabriel. Both Zion and Chief didn't react to their notion and passed by them and walked inside the huge building. There inside, Chief started a one man game of billiards, while Zion sat down at the counter and poured himself a shot glass amount of Absinthe, then set a brown sugar cube on a metal absinthe spoon and then pouring a small amount of Absinthe onto it, then struck a match and set the sugar cube on fire. Once the cube was caramelized and melted, he then dunked the still flaming Absinthe spoon in the Absinthe. Suddenly the drink ignited and without hesitation, Zion poured a small amount of cold water into the green beverage before he removed the spoon. Zion sighed as he lifted the shot glass and then poured it into his mouth; he allowed the bitter-sweet flavor to enrich his taste buds. Then he swallowed and looked over his shoulder as their hit men entered with a middle aged man in tow. \"Where are we? Why am I here! I didn't do anything to you guys! Let me go, man!\" Chief straightened up and leaned on his pool stick. \"What do we have here? Is this the same piece of garbage that was messing with my girl?\" Chief walked up to the group of hit men and then pointed the pool stick at the man that was in their grip. \"Huh? That was your girl? Oh man! Hey, I'm sorry for that. Just let me go, man!\" The guy tried to wiggle in the iron grip of the two hit men. Chief walked up to the man and inhaled deeply through his nose; as if he had smelled something. \"Sorry. Will not cut it this time. I smell her on you. You laid your scummy hand on my girl. There is no going back now.\" He walked away and went to the counter where his younger twin sat, watching the whole scene play through. \"He will do nicely. Take him away.\" Chief ordered the hit men. Chief watched silently as his men dragged the human away, until tonight's hunt. \"Didn't waste any effort on that one; eh?\" Zion smiled as he prepared another round of Absinthe for himself and for his brother. Chief took the drink and lifted it toward his brother, making the silent gesture of thanks. \"Mmmm…cheers.\" Then they both took their swigs of the drink and enjoyed the bitter-sweet taste as it flowed down their throats. Zion sighed and set his glass on the counter and looked over at his brother. I yawned as I looked for a place to park the car for the afternoon and get some shut-eye; before going too far into the city and end up getting myself lost. I eventually pulled over into a parking spot that was located in this side alley that was placed between two apartment complexes. After turning the car off; I double checked to see that the car was locked. I sighed heavily and curled up in the driver's seat, before falling asleep. Astrid sat comfortably in her chair reading an interesting book; it was a romance novel she had read repeatedly throughout the year. It was her favorite out of her little collection of books. About six chapters into the book; she was forced away from her book due to her growling stomach. After grabbing an orange, she picked up her book and was about to sit back in the chair when she looked out the window that was next to her. She gasped in horror as she beheld the sight of Gabriel's car parked where he normally parked it when he was here visiting. She dropped her book and leaned further into the window. She could barely see that someone was in the vehicle. Her heart seemed to stop beating; she couldn't breathe or take her eyes off the car. Was Gabriel alive? Was it Vivian? If it was Vivian, was she here to come home? With a heavy sigh, she finally pulled herself away from the window. She then quickly put on a long sweater and sprinted down the stairs to see who was in the car. She felt like she had the right to know, so she could put her soul to ease. When she finally got outside and walked briskly toward the driver side of the car. She peered through the tinted window; she saw that there was definitely someone inside. But it was not Gabriel. She then walked to the hood of the car and leaned over the hood; she peered in through the windshield and gasped. There was a girl in the driver's seat curled up sleeping. This girl didn't look at all familiar; but yet she felt like she knew her, somehow she just knew. But how did she get a hold of Gabriel's car? \"Hey, Chief; I am going to go on home.\" Zion stretched his arms over his head before rising to his feet. \"Running again I am presuming?\" Chief asked as he followed his brother out of the bar. \"What else? I don't wanna get involved between you and Charr; especially when you bring her over before the hunt tonight.\" Zion watched as his brother got into the navy blue Chevy Camaro they both owned. Chief rolled his eyes as he shut the door; and rolled down the tinted windows of the two door car. \"Just make sure you show up with me tonight for the hunt.\" \"You know I will. I always show. Don't worry, bro. The only one you should worry about is Charr. See ya in a bit.\" Zion then jogged away, heading back to their apartment to get ready for the hunt. Astrid watched through the windshield; she stayed silent, as if she was almost afraid that I would wake. She seemed to be watching over me, as if she had to guard me from something. But she felt even more obligated about opening the car and having me live with her. She felt a strange connection to me and it was strong; as strong as if I was one of her own. \"Hey mom, why are you- … who's car is this?\" Zion walked over to his mother and looked over the vehicle. Then he looked over to his mother with a worried expression. \"Mom, is everything okay? Do you know whose car this belongs to?\" Astrid looked away from the windshield and smiled softly. \"Zion. My son…help me get her out. She needs me… I can't explain it… but she needs to get indoors.\" Astrid walked back over to the driver's side door and tried the door. It was locked; she looked over to her youngest son, she felt so helpless. Zion never changed his worried expression, but sighed and grabbed a hold of the door handle; then with a quick jerk on the handle, the door came open. Then Zion bent down and leaned inside the car. He handed his mother the car keys, before he grabbed me around the shoulders to pull me out slightly so he could get a grip and lift me out of the car. Now with me in his arms, Astrid closed the car and led him inside; making sure she held every door open for him. \"Here; set her in this room.\" Zion gently set me on the bed of an abandoned room in their apartment; it had belonged to Vivian. \"Chief! You're late!\" Charr yelled as she poked her head in the Camaro before she got in. \"Sorry, babe.\" Chief leaned over and kissed his girlfriend tenderly. \"Wanna get ready for the hunt tonight, darling?\" He smiled while shifting into gear and heading back to his home to help get prepared. \"So is it the one I told you about?\" Charr asked while rolling up her window. \"The one who tried to take me away from the pack?\" \"Yes. He will pay dearly for his crime. Like all the others before him. He will not live for very long.\" Chief smirked when he felt Charr lean her head on his shoulder. \"It's only a matter of time. Tonight I will become the leader of the pack.\" With that said, the conversation was ended for the rest of the trip. Zion walked out of his room, all clothed in black along with his ritual necklace that all of the Loup- garoux wore on the night there was a hunt. He sighed and walked down the hall to meet up with his mother and brother. On his way to the family room, he ran into Charr who was also clothed in black and bearing the same necklace. He bowed his head in a respectful welcoming gesture. From this night on, he was obligated to treat her as one of his blood and stature. He knew full well that his brother would pick her as his mate when he would become pack leader before the hunt. All the other hunts were lead by their mother since she was the closest one to their father and would give up her leadership to her eldest son tonight. Charr bowed back and walked with him to the family room where Astrid and Chief were talking. \"Ah! Zion, Charr! I am so glad you both are ready! Are we all prepared to go meet up with the pack?\" Astrid smiled and walked over to greet her youngest son and soon to be daughter-in-law. She kissed them both on the cheeks and cupped their faces in her hands as she did so. \"Charr, you look beautiful tonight. I pray you do well in your part, when the time comes.\" Astrid smiled and had to wipe away a tear that escaped her eye and slid down her cheek. \"Thank you…Mother.\" Charr smiled and hugged the elder female. When they parted, Astrid then walked over to Zion and looked up at him with still glossy eyes. \"Zion, you look so handsome. I pray you learn well under your brother and mind your place till it is your time to become leader of the pack.\" Zion smiled and wiped away his mother's tears. \"I will, Mother.\" Zion wrapped his arms around her and patted her back gently. \"Your father would be proud of you too; you know that don't you?\" Astrid whispered. \"Yes.\" Zion answered quietly and allowed his mother to grip onto his shirt and cry the last of her tears. The last time she did this was the moment Gabriel told her that their son had been killed by the human, Aiden. Astrid felt safe and comforted in the arms of her youngest, like she had so long ago with Gabriel. She had lost so much throughout her life, and it was all done by the hand of man. She had lost her sister, her son Rafe, and her lover Gabriel. She had to be so protective of both Chief and Zion; she couldn't take losing another son or family member. It would hurt too much. \"I am okay.\" She sighed as she pulled away from Zion and wiped the last tear away. \"Let's go meet the pack. I don't want to be late.\" Zion parked his black motorcycle next to a stone pillar that symbolized the gateway to their scared hunting grounds. He took off his helmet and held out his hand and took his second helmet from his mother. Then with everything ready the both of them walked through the gateway to join their fellow members of the pack. Zion walked next to his mother and looked around at all of the happy faces of his fellow Loup-garpoux, he watched as the teenaged males showed off their skills to the females while the younger children pranced about and danced to the music that was being played by a small band. The elder members chatted among themselves, watching the younger ones do their business. Lastly his gaze fell upon the mothers getting after their children and teaching them some helpful life skills; this was going to be their first time joining the pack in the hunt. They wouldn't be the ones to help kill the prey of course, but this would be their first time feasting among their brethren and kin. Zion could distinctly remember his first time joining the pack to go hunt; he smiled at the memory of both him and Chief as they tried to race one another to see who could keep up with the adults and get the first taste of human flesh. Everything suddenly became silent as the whole pack gathered to the center of the clearing and stared at the small cliff as both Charr and Chief walked to its edge. Chief looked out at the pack and then stopped his gaze on both his brother and mother; he watched as the both of them walked forward and up to where he now stood. Charr stepped back and bowed while showing her neck; the whole pack did the same before getting to their feet to watch the ceremony take place. Astrid stopped right in front of her elder son; she smiled and lifted her hands up to show him what she had. Chief looked down in her hands and beheld a new ritual necklace; it was similar to his but had more teeth on it. He watched as Zion walked up to him and lifted his necklace off of him and was replaced by Astrid placing the new ritual necklace around his neck. Then both Zion and Astrid stepped away from him and bowed low while showing their necks. The pack bowed once more and watched from their crouched positions as their new leader looked around while taking in his new responsibilities. Then without further thought; Chief stepped up to the edge and bowed back to the pack, everyone rose to their feet and kept their eyes on Chief. Chief sighed before he began his speech; \"My Lords and Ladies, I am proud to be your new leader. And as your new leader, I will hold my responsibilities with respect and honor. I will promise you that we will prosper and I will ensure your safety at all times; even if it means me sacrificing my own safety to protect you all.\" The pack whooped with approval and delight; Astrid smiled proudly as she watched off to the side with Zion. Chief looked over his shoulder and smiled at his mother, before turning his attention back to the pack. \"I am proud to announce that I have indeed made a choice on who shall be my mate; my mate shall be, Charr.\" The pack cheered and watched as their leader reached out to Charr; she gladly took his hand and walked up next to him. The pack grew silent and all bowed to their new leaders. \"Now my Lords and Ladies, tonight we have all gathered here for one purpose, and one purpose alone. To feast on those who do nothing but threaten us with their weapons, to give us harm and bring us nothing but pain, devastation and death. We are here on this glorious night to hunt; and hunt we shall. When we live, we live as one; we die as one and we hunt as one. That is what my father had said, and my mother has taught me this rule to live by as we all do.\" Chief then nodded to his hit men to come forth with the man he had chosen earlier. They brought the blindfolded man forward and dropped him on the ground. \"This being before you, is man. Man has done nothing but give us all pain and death. But not on this night; for tonight we shall show man that we are the stronger species. And that we will put him in his place.\" Then Chief and the rest of the pack stripped themselves of their coats, shirts or outer wear; to make it easier for the hunt. Chief then leapt down from his perch and took off the man's blindfold. \"There is a river in these woods. If you reach the river in time, you win your life. If not, the Loup-garoux shall take the victory of taking your life.\" Then with one swift move, Chief cut the man with a dagger his father had used before him. The man cried out in pain, and was set free of his bonds. Charr walked up to the man and kissed him farewell. \"Run free.\" She sassed, as her eyes turned yellow. The man gasped and looked around and saw that everyone around him had yellow eyes as well. The smell of blood hung in the air from the wound. The Loup-garoux held themselves back from attacking the human and parted a path way that lead to the forest. As the man walked down the path and watched them with fear; they kept their eyes on him and steadily drove him into the forest. When he got into the forest, he broke out into a run; everyone stayed in the clearing and waited a while to give their human prey a good running start. Chief and Charr walked in front of the group and stared at where the man had disappeared into the darkness. Both kept their eyes forward as did the pack; it was now time. Chief slowly walked into the forest with Charr at his side; the rest of the pack followed closely. Soon, their walking turned into trotting then into a full blown run. They could easily find the human by the scent trail of his blood. The scent was so intoxicating that all they knew was that they wanted to taste it and feed. The pack fanned out and ran as fast as they could; but then they couldn't hold off and gave in to their wolf instincts and transformed from human to wolf. Their chase ended when they caught up to the man; the first wolf that had cut the human off from his escape was Chief, he growled low and bared his teeth. Some of the other wolves surrounded the man, all growling and showing their teeth. Chief snapped his jaws and licked his lips, then without hesitation leapt onto the man and began tearing into him. Suddenly the others began to join in as well as the newer arrivals on the scene. The only ones that stood by were the young mothers and their charges or children that had come for their first hunting experience. Within a few minutes, the man was dead and everyone was feasting on his flesh. The hunt was now complete; the pack and their leaders rejoiced their successful night with a musical chorus of howls. Slowly everyone walked throughout the forest while clothing themselves as they made their way back to their cars and outerwear that was left back at the clearing. Zion waited outside the forest, waiting for his mother to appear. He was one of the last ones out of the forest; he knew full well that his brother and new mate wouldn't be joining the pack on their way home tonight. He smiled when Astrid came out and handed her, her coat; she smiled and thanked him as she wrapped herself in it and followed him to his motorcycle. Tonight was not only a memorable night for the pack having a new leader, but will be for both Chief and Charr. Astrid knew that there was a possibility that a new member might be brought into this world soon and it would be created tonight if all went well. As they rode home, Astrid was quiet and couldn't help the many thoughts racing through her mind. It was 20 years ago tonight that she had given birth to both Chief and Zion and it was not only her happiest night, but the saddest since her lover, Gabriel, wasn't there to share it with her. She sighed as she got off her son's bike and handed him the spare helmet. The both of them were silent as they walked inside the small apartment and made themselves comfortable in the family room. Astrid couldn't keep still and walked into the kitchen to get a drink for both her and Zion. When she came back into the family room; she saw Zion staring out the window. He was expressionless and seemed to be elsewhere than in his own body. The both of them knew that come tomorrow, Chief would move out to a place of his own and no longer live with his mother and brother. Astrid walked up to Zion and placed a hand on his shoulder; he snapped out of his trance and smiled up at her. She mirrored his smile and handed him a bottle of water. He took it gratefully and opened it. Astrid sighed and walked out of the family room and down the hall to the room where I was kept. She opened the door quietly and peered into the room; I was still fast asleep, dreaming of a place no one knew but me. Astrid looked down at the floor and then back at me, before she entered the room and sat at the edge of the bed. She watched me sleep peacefully and lifted her hand and then lowered it on my head and began to gently stroke my hair. Zion got to his feet and walked down the hall to go into his room when he stopped halfway, and looked at his mother stroking the hair of the girl that she had found and brought into their home. He wondered what was so significant about this girl that his mother felt obligated into taking this girl into their home. Zion drank from the plastic bottle and then capped it before leaving his mother alone and went to his room for the night.[Chapter 3] I woke to the smell of eggs being cooked with sausage. I blinked and looked around, only to find that I wasn't in my car but in someone's bedroom. I sat up and stretched, a yawn escaped my mouth as I tried to wake myself up. How long was I asleep? I thought, and where the heck am I? I saw that it was a simple room with nothing but a dresser, bed and desk. Otherwise it was empty; it must have been a spare bedroom that no one inhabited yet. I crawled out of bed and made my way to the door; I opened it slowly and peered out into the hall. No one was in sight, but there was definitely someone home. I slowly walked into the hall and followed my nose to where I believed the kitchen was located. With each step that I took; the closer I seemed to get to the kitchen, I could hear someone bustling about and pretty soon I could hear a conversation taking place. \"Do you honestly think she belongs with us?\" I heard a guy ask. \"I do. I am positive; I have this feeling that she is one of us.\" a woman answered. \"Well, if you're certain-\" the guy cut off his sentence; I heard a chair being pushed. I froze and held my breath. I could feel a presence behind me, I went to turn around; but was stopped when a pair of strong hands grabbed me around my waist and covered my mouth. \"Gotcha!\" I was then dragged backwards by my capturer into the dining room. I kept thrashing and trying to scream; but he held me tight against his body and my screams were muffled by his hand. \"Hey mother, look who finally decided to join us!\" the man called. I heard quick footsteps as a middle aged woman entered the room. I glanced at her and tried to wiggle some more. She seemed to be transfixed by the sight of me, but quickly snapped out of it. \"Zion. Please release her!\" I felt the man's hands release me; I gasped silently as I was able to breathe easier. \"Come my dear. You must be starving.\" The woman smiled. I hesitated for a moment; I was feeling a bit uneasy about this place. \"It's okay. We are here to help you.\" I held my breath as I slowly approached her and allowed her to lead me to the dining table where there was food set out. I sat at the table with an emptied plate; I licked my lips with the satisfaction of a full belly. I had eaten my meal quickly and was eagerly waiting for more. I had learned some information about the people who had helped me. The woman was named Astrid and the man was her 20 year old son, Zion. Apparently he is the younger of twins; but the older one was nowhere to be seen. \"So, how old are you, my dear?\" Astrid asked while setting a plate of short stacks at my spot. I dug into my second helping of breakfast and looked up at her. I swallowed and looked at Zion who was silently watching me from the other side of the table. \"I'm 19. Why?\" I looked back at Astrid who was now sitting next to me. I didn't dare eat anymore food on account of both Astrid and Zion staring at me with some interest. \"What?\" \"Nothing. You just look younger than that. I remember-\" All conversation was lost due to someone entering the room; I looked at both Astrid and Zion as they kept their gaze on whoever was standing behind me. \"Who's this?\" I heard a deep voice boom behind me. \"Why is she here?\" I could sense great tension in the room. I looked over at Zion who stood up from his seat and took a deep breath before he spoke up. \"Is that a way to greet your family, Chief?\" So this is Zion's older brother… I thought to myself. Zion walked around the table and stopped right next to me and kept his gaze on his brother. Chief was standing directly behind me and faced his brother with great irritation. \"I'll ask again, brother. Who is she and why is she here!\" Chief spoke louder; I looked at Astrid, who kept her gaze on the table, she seemed slightly afraid of her oldest son's anger. \"What does it matter to you? You no longer live with us, remember? You have moved out this morning.\" Zion interjected while inching closer to me; I could feel my heart race with anticipation on a fight brewing. \"She needs to leave this place. Better yet; leave the city.\" Chief growled as he leaned down and looked at my face. I glanced at him with no expression; he sneered as he stood back to his full height to face his brother. \"And I will trust you make sure of that, brother.\" Chief started to walk out of the room, when his brother spoke up once more. \"She's not going anywhere, Chief.\" Zion stood directly behind me to block his brother's view of me at the table. Astrid stood to stop her youngest, but it was too late. Chief turned around and looked at his brother with a threatening glare. \"What did you say?\" \"You heard me and I don't care if you are older and -\" Zion was cut off by his brother's punch in the face. Zion stumbled back and slumped on me. I froze and dared not move, I was almost afraid to have him end up touching me in places he shouldn't, even if it was by accident. Zion got up and looked at his brother with a new kind of hate. He had always hated his brother out of pure sibling rivalry; but this time it was different. He knew his mother wanted to care for this girl and he would make sure that his mother would have her way. \"You should have NEVER became leader!\" Zion growled as he pushed his brother away and wiped a spot of blood away from his lip. He looked at the small red spot on his hand before looking back at his brother with yellow eyes. \"Don't test me…\" Chief's eyes turned yellow as he went to advance another attack on his younger brother. Zion dodged Chief's swing and kicked him square in the stomach; Chief flew back into the hallway and landed against the wall. Astrid yelled for the boys to stop the fight and apologize, but no one would listen. \"Are you challenging my leadership?\" Chief growled low so that only the two of them could hear their conversation. \"Maybe…maybe not. Hard to tell, since this is your first day as leader. But remember this, brother; I will be watching you VERY closely. If there is one mistake, reckless or not, I WILL be challenging. Even if I have to battle my way through your men. I will see to the pack; if you give me reason to remotely question your authority.\" Zion hissed in his brother's ear. Then Zion pushed his brother down the hall, \"Now, Get out of our house.\" Zion glared and watched as Chief stalked out of the apartment. Zion sighed heavily as he rubbed the back of his neck; he walked back over to the table in the kitchen and sat heavily on his chair. Astrid slowly walked up to him and set her hands on his shoulders. \"Why did you do that? Stand up to your brother?\" she whispered. \"Because you want this girl to stay with us and I will not stand off to the side and watch my brother harass my mother and tell her what to do. Plus I see now what you mean about this girl needing to stay with us.\" Zion looked at me and smiled. \"I feel it too.\" I swallowed hard and tried to control my knees from knocking against one another. Zion stretched his arms over his head while he walked to the living room where he found his mother sitting reading a book with their guest. At the feeling of his presence, both Astrid and I looked up at him. He smiled and walked up to the nearest chair and rested his arms on the back of it. \"Is it all right mom if I bring her to the bar?\" Zion asked. Astrid smiled and looked at me for my opinion. \"It's okay with me, what do you think dear?\" I looked at Astrid with some shock. I hardly knew these people and have stayed with them only for a week. Out of the two of them, I seemed to feel most comfortable with Astrid. I looked back at Zion who was looking at me and waiting for an answer. I sighed heavily while closing my book and nodded. \"I guess I could go for a while.\" I forced a smile; I really didn't want to go with Zion, but I felt obligated on pleasing the both of them. Besides, I thought it wouldn't hurt and be some form of payback for what he had done. He didn't have to stand up to his brother, or allow me to stay with them. Over the week of me staying with them, I had learned so much about them and their heritage. I even secretly found out that they were Loup-garoux as well. \"I'll quick change into something else. I'll be quick.\" I got to my feet and walked into what was now my own room. Astrid had 'adopted' me into her family and even bought me all the clothes I needed. I opened my closet and looked over what it had to offer me for the night. I soon ended up putting on a knee length, strapless, black dress with slits on both sides of the skirt. I sighed as I tied it in the back and put on a pair of black earth sandals. I never was big on footwear. Then with one last look in my mirror; I walked out of my room and met Zion back in the living room. I also had a black bandanna tied around my head to act as a headband. The only jewelry I wore was an iron ring on my left middle finger in the shape of a wolf's head. When I re-entered the living room; everything was silent and I couldn't help but blush slightly at the fact that both Astrid and Zion were gaping at me. \"You look great.\" Zion breathed out, as he attempted to snap out of his trance. \"Um…thanks.\" I tried not to whisper my reply, out of fear of sounding like a childish school girl on her first date. Come to think of it, this was going to be like a date and it also was going to be my first one. I could feel my insides twist and cramp up with nervousness. My mind was racing with ideas on how to make any type of excuse on chickening out on going out with Zion; but I was too nervous to even croak out a word. \"Well, we will be home by 1 to 2ish. Okay mom.\" Zion smiled as he shrugged into his black leather coat. \"Sure thing. Hope you both have fun!\" Astrid waved as the both of us walked out. I was wearing my black trench coat and was grateful that it was covering more of my body than what the dress was covering underneath. We walked the entire way to the bar and our conversations were limited to only a couple words or statements. \"By the way, what is your name?\" Zion asked as we walked by a fountain; a cool autumn breeze whisked through causing our hair to fly. \"My name?\" I asked, almost dumbfounded by the simple question. I had almost forgot that I never told them my name. It kind of made me uneasy with Zion asking all this stuff from me as if he was a good friend; he seemed so casual and at ease with me and wasn't afraid of asking certain questions without any signs of hesitation. I looked up at him and saw that he was watching me as we walked further down the sidewalk. \"Yes. You have been with us for about a week now, and neither my mother or I know your name. You know ours along with some other information…I would like it a lot if you told me your name.\" he smiled down at me; and I could feel my chest ache. I swallowed hard and looked ahead as if trying to avoid his watchful gaze. \"My name is Ithica. Is there anything else you would like to know?\" I looked back at Zion who was staring at his feet momentarily before looking back up at the way ahead. \"So…Ithica; that is a pretty name.\" he chuckled to himself and looked over at me with his eyes beaming like when a child opens their first present on Christmas day and finds their toy they always wanted. \"What?\" I couldn't help but allow the question to slip out of my mouth. \"Nothing. Where are you from?\" he looked back ahead and directed us around a corner to steer us directly to the bar. \"Paris.\" I answered flatly. \"France?\" \"No, Spain. Of course France!\" I smiled and chuckled at my comeback. I quickly gasped and straightened my expression out of embarrassment. I had never allowed myself to smile or laugh with anyone else; it felt kind of odd and yet good, but I was scared and nervous on what could occur if I allowed my guard down too easily. I mentally slapped myself for letting myself get so distracted. \"No, it's okay. I like your smile; you are allowed to show it you know.\" I looked away and sighed, \"Ah! Here we are! We're here!\" Zion chirped as he grabbed my hand and pulled me to a lever in a small alley and pulled it down; triggering a hidden door to open which lead into the bar. I gaped slightly at the sight of the bar and crowed dance floor. Zion lead me over to a booth where he plopped down in a seat and watched as I sat across him. I looked across the room to see a girl singing this song which I had to guess that the title of the song was 'let yourself go wild'. The song was so hypnotic that I felt my conscious mind slip away to only have something else awake in my mind. Zion shrugged out of his jacket and stretched his arms over his head. He was dressed in his clothes that he normally wore to the hunts, which consisted of nothing but black; the only thing he lacked was the ritual necklace. \"Would you like to dance?\" Zion asked as he leaned on the table and smiled at me. My head snapped back toward his direction and my eyes widened with surprise. \"Umm… I guess I could try.\" I stuttered. \"You don't know how to dance?\" all I could do was blush to his surprised question. \"Here, I'll show you how. C'mon, let's go!\" Zion got up and held out his hand. I looked at it and sighed as I got to my feet and shrugged out of my trench coat and took his hand. I felt so naked without my coat; I was starting to wonder why I allowed Astrid to talk me into buying this sad thing that was a dress. It was far too short to be considered one; I personally thought. As much as I tried, I could not help the panicked thoughts about my appearance race through my mind. Zion came to a halt in the middle of the dance floor and turned to face me. I swallowed and almost choked; I felt so scared and for what? Not knowing how to dance. \"I…I don't think I can do this.\" I stammered out. \"Sure you can. Here, let me show you how it is done. But, uh…I need to use my hands to help guide you through it though. You know what I mean?\" Zion nervously rubbed the back of his neck with his right hand. \"O-okay.\" I stuttered and nodded. \"Okay. Just remember that I am teaching you dance moves, while I dance; okay?\" \"Sure…whatever you say.\" I took a shaky breath as I watched Zion show me how to move my body to the rhythm of the music and to his movements. As the music played on, I seemed to have been a little too nervous; since my body seemed to act clumsy. I blushed slightly as Zion stood behind me and put his hands on my hips and rolled them while rocking them to the proper beat. I could feel him dance behind me as he directed my body with his. Oh god! Why am I feeling like this! He is just helping me with dance moves, yet I feel like there is more to it than some moves on the dance floor. \"You seem a bit jittery.\" Zion whispered in my ear. I could feel my temperature rise and gather in my face. I felt one of his hands move to my torso and press me closer to him. Oh man, I wanna die! I screamed in my head. Just then, Zion looked over toward the bar and saw his older brother. He stopped dancing and stood still and tall. I looked up at him with a different kind of fear now. Something must have gone wrong to have him stop dead. Was my dancing that bad? Then I looked at the direction in where he was looking and saw Chief talking to some of his men. \"I'll be back in a minute. You stay here.\" Zion walked through the crowd toward his brother, leaving me alone in a sea of dancing people. \"Well hello there. Haven't seen you here before.\" I heard a woman speak behind me. I whipped around with surprise, to see a young woman about my age with long brown hair; she stood with her hands on her hips and awaited my explanation. \"What's your name?\" she asked and crossed her arms. I blinked and looked around before returning my gaze back to her. \"Yeah; I am talking to you, shrimp!\" She pushed me, causing me to stumble back a few paces. \"So how is the leader of the pack tonight?\" Zion leaned up against the counter next to his brother. \"Tender! A round of Absinthe!\" Zion then looked over at his brother who had stopped talking to his men and glared back. \"What do you want, brother? Don't you have some flirting to do or something?\" Chief sighed as he took his glass of Absinthe. The hit men laughed at the small joke while watching their leader tease his brother. \"Now is that a way to greet your loving younger brother, Chief? Surely mother has taught you the proper way to greet me.\" \"Just tell me what you want before I rip you apart.\" Chief slammed his drink on the counter and faced Zion. \"Now why would I have a reason to come over and say hi?\" Zion took up his glass and drank his swig of Absinthe. Chief growled low in his throat, warning his brother that he was in no mood for jokes; and still didn't forgive him or his actions earlier that week. \"By the way brother, how come you are here tonight? Shouldn't you be with Charr?\" Suddenly, the music stopped playing due to me flying into the drummer on stage. Everyone had stopped what they were doing to see the fight that had started in the middle of the dance floor which was now going to be on the stage. I got to my feet and bared my teeth and growled when Charr leaped onto the stage and stormed toward me. Zion and Chief looked to see what was happening and were stunned at what they saw. I tussled with Charr and we both stumbled and fell onto the stage due to the cords lying around. I rolled on top of her and shook her head by her long brown hair. She screamed and clawed at my arms. Chief ran through the crowd followed by Zion; they were intending on stopping the fight for two different reasons. I was suddenly tackled off of Charr and crashed against the far wall at the back of the open stage. I was stunned and had the wind knocked out of me; I tried to breathe and get control of my eye sight. I blinked and saw that I was not being held down by Zion; but by Chief. Zion reached Chief and slung his older brother off of me. \"WHAT IS SHE STILL DOING HERE?\" Chief bellowed as he tried to get at me. Zion blocked each and every move; to help give me time to recuperate. \"Why does she seem to be such a threat to you?\" Zion grabbed his brother by the shoulders and looked into his eyes and waited an answer. \"Get her out of here if you do not wish her or anyone else to get hurt.\" Chief growled and pushed his brother away. \"Make your decisions a bit wiser. Because next time I won't be so rational. Now get out.\" Chief then turned and grabbed Charr and led her away and they disappeared into the crowd. Zion turned around and helped me to my feet, and then we walked through the crowd. We put our coats on and then left the bar and headed back to our home. \"Are you all right?\" Zion knelt down in front of me. He had insisted on me sitting down on a park bench so he could inspect the wounds I earned in the tussle. \"I'm fine.\" I gasped slightly when he poked a blood blister that had formed on the side of my right ankle. I had earned several bruises and small cuts; but nothing bad or anything that could do extensive damage. \"I am so sorry. I shouldn't have brought you to the bar. After what had happened…. I am just so sorry.\" Zion put his head in his hands and sighed heavily. I looked down at him and felt my heart break. \"You have nothing to be sorry for. You helped me yet again. I owe you.\" I chuckled softly in an attempt to lighten the mood. I swallowed hard at the feeling of being lost in this situation. I laid my hand on his shoulder; when Zion looked up at me with a hurt expression, my heart seemed to have had stop beating. \"I don't blame you.\" I choked out. Zion tried to reply, but was at a loss for words. \"Can I … Can I carry you home? I would feel better if I did.\" Zion asked as he looked in my eyes. I smiled tiredly and nodded. \"Sure. I am tired anyway.\" The both of us chuckled at the simple hinting joke. Zion got to his feet and scooped me into his arms and walked solemnly back to the apartment. \"Welcome back…Oh my god!\" Astrid shrieked as she put her hands to her mouth. She watched as Zion walked into the apartment holding me. I was fast asleep in his arms; it had been a long walk and I was drowsy and had slipped into dream half way back. I didn't flinch when he had put me down on the sofa. He sighed as he plopped down in a recliner that stood next to the sofa. \"What happened?\" Astrid gasped as she went over to me and looked me over before settling her gaze on her son. \"Charr.\" Zion breathed out as he tried to gather himself from the journey. \"Apparently someone is not happy to see a new comer, besides Chief. I actually found out what has been causing the harshness with the family.\" Zion looked up at his mother. \"Is it?\" Astrid gasped. \"Yes. Charr is pregnant.\"[Chapter 4] I woke the next morning with a throbbing headache. I winched as I sat up on the sofa; I slowly looked around so that my head didn't spin from the pain. I saw that Zion was sprawled out asleep on the recliner next to the sofa; he slightly flinched as he slept. I would have smiled, but it hurt to do much of anything. I quickly turned my head at the sound of footsteps entering the room; I groaned and fell back onto the sofa and held my head. I saw black spots and felt like the world was spinning a million miles an hour. \"I see you are awake; are you all right, honey?\" Astrid asked as she knelt down in front of the sofa. I blinked to regain my vision. \"Yeah. I'll be fine when the place stops spinning.\" I grumbled as I slowly breathed in through my nose and out of my mouth. \"I feel like I got hit by a truck!\" \"You worried the both of us. Zion stayed awake all night; making sure you would be alright. By the way, since you will be staying with us; I got you a job at a chocolate shop. Your first day is tomorrow. So let's get you back on your feet by then.\" Astrid stroked my head and left to go into the kitchen to fetch me something to eat. After eating a small salad and some bread, I was able to stay in a sitting position without feeling like the world was going to throw me out into orbit with the stars. Zion had soon woke to the sound of someone outside parking their car. The Next Day The next morning, Astrid escorted me to the chocolate shop in which I would be working in. The owner was an elderly woman who spoke very little English; but she helped me get to work and told me what to do and what was expected of me. Astrid bid me a good day and left me to my work for the day. The entire day was spent making chocolates, putting them on display, selling them and learning my chocolate delivery route. By the time it was closing, I had learned everything I needed to know and was exhausted. I was grateful to see that Zion decided to be the one to walk me home. \"How was your day?\"Zion asked as he stretched his arms over his head. \"Exhausting, since my head is still a bit sore. But I think I will get the hang of everything and when I get better; might enjoy the job.\" I smirked and rolled up my hoodie sleeves. I looked over at Zion and noticed that he was wearing all black and with a certain necklace; curiosity overruled my mind and I had to ask the question. \"What's the occasion?\" Zion looked over at me and then down at his clothes. He sighed heavily before answering. \"Oh. Umm…my mother and I are going out for the night. I wish you could come but you need to stay home and rest for work tomorrow.\" Zion couldn't bring himself to look me in the eye. \"But I promise you will be safe alone at the apartment. Chief will not harm you while we are gone.\" I didn't respond to his comment; and for the rest of our journey, was filled with nothing but silence. \"We will be back in a couple hours. If you are hungry there are some leftovers in the fridge; or you can make something. Whatever you wish. Just promise me that you will not go outside tonight.\" Astrid held my hands while looking at me in the eye. I sighed and nodded solemnly while glancing at the floor like I was a little girl who was in trouble. Astrid smiled and kissed me on the forehead, before she got her coat and left with Zion. I looked around before plopping myself down on the couch and flipping through a book that was lying on the coffee table that stood in front of it. After about 200 pages into the book; I glanced at the clock and saw that it was midnight. I was still alone in the small apartment and sighed out of boredom. I sat up and stretched my arms over my head. I froze when I heard my stomach growl out of hunger. I sat still, puzzled by the fact that I was hungry at this time of night. I looked out the window and saw that it was a full moon; I cringed when my stomach complained once more, letting me know that I needed to be fed. I got to my feet and walked into the kitchen. I shielded my eyes from the bright light when I opened the refrigerator. I blinked once more to get used to the new lighting before I began rummaging through and not really finding anything to my fancy. I stood up and sighed helplessly as I glanced back inside the fridge; I reached inside and grabbed a package of rare ground beef before closing the door. I walked back inside the living room and plopped back down on the couch. I opened the plastic packaging and grabbed a gob of the ground up meat and stuffed it inside my mouth before grabbing my book once more. Once in a while I would stuff my mouth full of the uncooked, bloody meat while not taking my eyes off of the book. After eating half of the container of raw beef, I noticeably began to grimace and make a disgusted face, with every mouthful of the meat. The taste of the raw meat wasn't satisfying my deep hunger for flesh. No matter how I tried to convince myself that it was better than what I was craving; my instincts won in the end. I got to my feet and grabbed my coat. I was going outside, despite the fact that I had promised Astrid that I would stay inside no matter what. I stormed out of the building and began to jog down the sidewalk; not knowing where my feet were going to take me. Zion watched his older brother with hatred in his eyes. Chief was making his speech before starting the hunt. Zion could tell that his brother was going to make this certain hunt a little different this time, and it felt like it wasn't going to be for the better. But the biggest change there was the appearance of Charr; she had given birth to a healthy baby boy and was standing in the group of newer mothers and the baby sitters. Since the last hunt, the pack had gotten bigger by a dozen members and Zion knew that one human wasn't going to make a decent feast for the pack; because of its sheer size in members. That was the main reason on why Zion was in a bitter mood, the other was on how Chief was now treating the pack. Instead of treating them as equals or with some respect, he was treating them as slaves. He watched as Chief jumped down from his perch and strode over to where his hit men stalked into the clearing with two human men in tow. Zion lowered his head when his mother glanced over at him. He knew he would have to hold himself back until the right moment. He took off his coat and shirt like the rest of the pack began to do the same. The hunt was now going to begin. I began to quicken my pace as I began to exit the safety of the town. I grew eager and followed nothing more than the ever going scent of fear that wafted through the night air. For the very first time I was now experiencing a thirst for blood; human blood and my thirst now demanded to be quenched no matter how I do it. The entire pack now grew anxious waiting for Chief to allow them to chase after their prey that attempted to flee for their lives. Zion had more than his empty stomach on his mind, he stared at his elder brother with aggravation on why he was not allowing his pack members to go and sate their hunger. Chief just stood at the front of the pack and watched patiently into the forest. Zion had just about enough of Chief's games and bolted out of the group and ran toward the forest. He didn't make it very far, due to Chief slamming him into the ground. Zion cried out and grabbed at his brother. Astrid ran through the pack trying to stop the fight that was starting to occur. When she got to her sons, Chief was starting to strangle his younger sibling. Astrid grabbed her eldest son while screaming for him to stop. It took several tries till she got him off of Zion. Zion coughed as he sat up; Astrid stood in front of him shielding him while he recovered from the attack. Chief signaled for the pack to go start the hunt, as the pack headed deep into the forest; Chief walked in front of his mother and look over her shoulder. \"Don't interfere again brother, or next time, I won't stop till your dead!\" Then he looked into his mother's eyes before stalking into the forest to join the pack. Astrid helped her son to his feet and they slowly jogged into the forest to join the feast that was soon going to begin. I was now running as fast as my feet could carry me; I panted loudly as I made my way down the dirt road I had entered miles ago. I now could smell the stench of blood, fresh spilled blood. I jumped over the edge of the road and transformed into a white wolf. I landed lightly onto the ground and lifted my head. I sniffed the air trying to determine the location on where the scent was coming from. I soon got my answer and began running once more to where the flesh of a human being was waiting for me to satisfy my hunger. Within minutes I was just outside the spot where my food awaited me. But I wasn't alone; I could smell a huge pack of other wolves just ahead. By the sounds of them eating their fill, I was hopelessly out numbered. On a normal situation I probably would have turned around and headed back; but I was too drawn in by the scent of blood that I was about to try anything to get my own share. I crested the small hill I had climbed and was greeted by the sight of a pack of about roughly 45 wolves. I stood still while panting from over exerting myself. I looked about the pack to see if I could sneak in to get a share of food. I thought about the idea of crawling in, but thought it would be too obvious and I would be spotted easily; so I straightened out my stance and began to prance right into the pack as if I was one of them, but was late to the dinning occasion. Unfortunately, as soon as I got near a piece of flesh, I was chased away by a hungry mother wolf. That in turn attracted more attention and shortly I was being pushed and chased about by more and more members of the pack. While trying to escape, I was then tackled by a large grey wolf, whom was the alpha male of the pack. The large wolf growled low while bearing his fangs; I laid still while growling back while trying not to bear my teeth in return. For some odd reason this wolf smelled familiar; he smelled just like Zion's older brother, Chief. I was proved right when Chief flattened his ears and lowered his head mere inches from my face. Suddenly without warning, Chief grabbed a hold of my neck. I yelped loudly as I tried to squirm away. The whole pack was in an uproar as the barked, howled and snapped at me as their leader began to suffocate me. Zion, a semi-black wolf (like his father before him) pushed to the front of the action to see what was causing this odd frenzy. His yellow eyes beheld his brother over a young white wolf that must have strayed into the pack. There was blood now being drawn and began to stain the white fur of the mysterious wolf. The stranger smelled familiar, very familiar. Zion then saw who the strange wolf was; it was Ithica! He growled and ran right into the bloodshed. He tackled his brother off of me and stood over me while not taking his eyes off of his brother. Astrid, a grey and brown wolf pushed to the front of the group and stopped when she saw the horrific scene of Zion challenging Chief in front of the pack. Astrid lowered herself and crept to the strange wolf that was under Zion. She sniffed the wounded wolf's cheek and realized it was me. Chief suddenly charged at his mother and chased her back into the pack. Zion snapped at his brother's hind quarters as if he was telling Chief to leave her out of this. Chief snarled as he pulled back his lips revealing his fangs once more. Zion lowered his head and bared his fangs in return. Zion stood firm always keeping his gaze on his brother. Chief paced while growling; he refused to break his stare as he planned his attack. Astrid walked at the edge of the small circle with her ears down; she was at a loss and could do nothing about the situation. When she was behind Zion, she once again got on her belly and crawled toward me. When she got close enough to me, she sniffed my nose and nudged my muzzle with hers. Chief growled louder and licked his lips while pacing faster. Zion sneezed and licked his lips while still baring his fangs. Astrid whined a plea for everything to stop, but it was no use. Suddenly Chief made his move; he ran at his brother and jumped. Zion jumped to his hind feet and knocked his brother down. Chief landed on the ground, but not for long; right before Zion was back on all four paws, Chief pushed from the ground and snatched his younger brother's left front leg in his mouth. Zion howled and screamed as his older brother bit down harder and thrashed his leg about till Zion was forced down to the ground. Zion grabbed a hold of Chief's scruff and bit down hard while scratching his brother's face with his hind feet. Everyone in the pack was silent as they watched their leader and his brother fight. Astrid tried to help me to my feet but was too late. Chief noticed her and released his grip on Zion. He growled and barked a warning to Astrid, but she didn't seem to notice. He then charged her, growling and baring his teeth ready to attack. Zion forced himself up and ran after his brother with everything he had left in him. Astrid looked up and saw Chief seconds away from her. She cringed and lowered herself onto her stomach with her ears down as she whined. Before Chief had a chance at touching her with his fangs, Zion jumped in front of his mother and took the attack full force. Zion screamed loudly as his brother grabbed a hold of his back, right between his shoulders. Blood seeped through Zion's wounds and slowly ran down onto the ground. He wriggled as much as he could and after a short time he finally got loose from his brother's grasp. He reared up and smacked his brother in the face. Chief went to attack once more but was too slow. Zion grabbed his brother's scruff firmly in his mouth and pulled hard enough to slam the elder wolf to the ground. Chief landed with a loud yelp. No matter how much he wiggled; he couldn't release himself from his brother's grasp. Zion growled as he pulled his brother's scruff harder while standing on the elder wolf's side. Ever so slightly a small stream of blood began to appear on Chief's neck. Zion refused to release or ease up on his grasp and allowed himself to draw more blood from his brother. Before Zion could do anymore damage, two of Chief's henchmen who were smaller wolves jumped in and pushed Zion off of their pack leader and held him at bay, while Chief got to his feet. Zion panted as he stood before the three wolves, waiting and anticipating another attack. But nothing happened. Chief snarled once before he ushered the rest of the pack away. The hunt was over and there was nothing more to see or do, but to go home. Zion, Astrid and I were left alone in the clearing. Astrid slowly walked over to her son and sniffed the side of his muzzle with her ears still down with sadness and worry. Zion sniffed her muzzle back before returning his watchful gaze back to where Chief had disappeared with the pack. His ears were perked forward as if he was listening for someone to come back. With the assurance that no one was returning to the scene, Zion turned to still see me lying on the ground motionless. He then looked back at his mother and grunted; she nuzzled his neck briefly before trotting back to gather her clothes back at the ceremonial gathering area before the hunt. Zion turned to me and slowly began to walk to my side. I sighed helplessly as he stopped and sat down next to me. I couldn't seem to meet his gaze, Zion grunted softly trying to get me to look up at him; but I refused to look at him. I was ashamed at how I acted by walking right into a death trap like that and then having someone fight my own fight. Zion tried everything to have me look at him, but nothing would work. He looked over his shoulder when he heard someone approaching the clearing. He lightly thumped his tail seeing that it was his mother walking in carrying his clothes in her arms. Astrid dropped the black clothing next to a tree before walking back to my side. Zion looked back down at me before rising and trotting toward the pile of his clothes. I closed my eyes as Zion walked behind a tree and reappeared as a human when he got to the other side. He sighed as he reached down and picked up his pants; when he was done putting them on, he grabbed his shirt and walked back over to me. He knelt down and stroked my head gently. I whined softly from the slight attention. I burrowed my nose under Astrid's knee, trying to hide my face. Astrid stroked my head in reassurance and looked at Zion with tears in her eyes. Zion looked back down at me and saw me slowly change back into my human form. Blood pooled and spilled from the back of my neck, the crimson fluid flowed down my back and over my shoulders onto my chest and mixing itself in the dirt. I curled up into a fetal position, trying to cover myself from Zion. Without a word spoken, Zion draped his open shirt over my torso. Astrid brushed my hair out of my eyes and gathered it into a bunch off to the side away from my wound. I cried softly as both Zion and Astrid inspected the wound; it was clean but since it was open to the air, I was highly prone to getting a bad infection and possibly dying since we couldn't go to a hospital to get it treated. Zion then gathered me into his arms and got to his feet. Astrid stood up and followed him out of the forest. She helped him get me into her black car, before speeding back to their apartment.[Chapter 5] Zion set me down carefully onto the couch before stepping away to allow his mother to try and treat my wounds. He watched silently as Astrid cleaned my wounds with a highly concentrated rubbing alcohol. I cried and gritted my teeth while wiggling away from her. Cleaning the wound hurt too much to bear. Zion quietly walked over to me and grabbed a hold of me by my shoulders and held me down on the couch while pinning my legs with his. Astrid continued cleaning my wound on the back of my neck and the top of my shoulders; my cries were muffled due to the fact my head was pressed into the couch cushions. Zion sighed silently waiting for his mother to finish doctoring me up so he could get off of me. He couldn't bear to meet his mother's eyes when she would try to get his attention. After a couple of minutes, I was finished and was released from Zion's weight. The instant I was free, I ran off of the couch, down the hall and into my room. I was still only clothed in Zion's black dress shirt. I slammed the door shut and hid myself in the far corner of the room; and eventually fell asleep there. Zion sat down at the kitchen table; he was sitting in his chair with the back of the chair in front of him. He leaned on it allowing his mother to tend to his wounds. He didn't flinch when he felt the burning of the rubbing alcohol cleaning his wounds that covered his back and arm. His mind was set on one thing and one thing only, stripping Chief of his leadership. \"I wonder why Ithica didn't tell us that she was a Loup-garoux.\" Astrid broke the tense silence that hung throughout the apartment. Zion put his head down and buried it in the crook of his uninjured arm that was resting on the top of the chair he was sitting in. Astrid finished wrapping his wounds with gauze and stood up from her bent position. \"Zion are you going to be okay?\" she stroked his hair as she looked down at her son. Zion looked up at his mother with a tired expression and nodded solemnly. \"Yeah. I'll be fine.\" He got to his feet and walked to his room without another word spoken. Astrid sat down at the kitchen table and leaned on the table top. She rested her head on her hand and silently wept out of frustration and confusion. Where did she go wrong? What did she do to have the family now split into two sides. What will become of the pack now that Chief has been challenged and nonetheless became power hungry? Paris, France \"Are you sure you know what you are doing?\" Aiden asked as he got into his wife's car. Vivian shut her door and buckled up. She handed her husband the keys to the vehicle and nodded. \"I know that our daughter is there. Where else would she go? It's not like she liked it here in Paris.\" Vivian looked out the window as the green BMW cruised down the street heading out of the city. I woke the next morning on my bed. I slowly sat up so that the pain was reduced to a minimum. I brushed hair out of my face and looked over at my nightstand; there stood a small vase of red and black roses with a black ribbon tied neatly on the neck of the vase. I cocked my head to the side and was about to see if there was a card attached when there was a knock at my bedroom door. \"Who is it?\" I asked as I bustled about my room getting undergarments and sliding into a pair of blue jeans and buttoning Zion's black dress shirt. I had to try and quickly cover up just in case it was Zion. I didn't want him to see me in the buff again. \"It's Astrid.\" Came my muffled answer. I sighed, with relief washing through my features as I attempted to do something with my hair. \"Come in.\" I called back as I dropped my hair so that it just hung loose. I gave up on looking somewhat normal. I looked over as Astrid poked her head in the room before smiling slightly as she pushed open the door and walked in. She closed the door behind her and sat down on my bed; I nervously began to nip at my thumb nail. Astrid looked over at the roses next to her and fingered the ribbon. \"What lovely flowers. Zion must have brought them to you before he left this morning.\" She looked back at me with a now blank face. \"Ithica.\" I looked at her before glancing out the window to see a pigeon fly by. \"Why didn't you tell us?\" I looked regrettably back at Astrid and looked at my feet. I dropped my hand to my side before I answered her. \"Because I thought you would throw me out. I thought that if I kept it quiet I would be able to have a place to stay.\" I shifted my weight from one leg to the other. \"I thought that if I told you, you wouldn't have understood…like my mother.\" I glanced up and saw that Astrid sighed as she looked down at her hands. After a couple of seconds past for everything to sink in; Astrid spoke up. \"I do understand.\" She looked up at me and smiled, I sighed with relief and allowed several tears to show and begin to fall down my cheek. \"Oh honey.\" Astrid opened her hands and I slowly walked over to the bed and collapsed into her arms and cried. \"I would never have you thrown out. Never. It's okay.\" Astrid rubbed my back as she comforted me as I cried. After a short while, I stopped crying and was wiping my tears on Zion's shirt sleeve. \"Ithica, is it okay if I ask you a question?\" I sniffed and sighed as I nodded to try and clear my head. \"Who is your mother?\" I stopped what I was doing and looked her in the eye as I contemplated whether or not to tell her. \"I guess you have a right to know…\" I nervously laughed as I began to wring my hands. \"Umm… her name is Vivian.\" I watched as Astrid took in the information with a stunned expression. \"Hey are you okay? Why did you want to know? Astrid?\" she looked over at me with the slightest of panic in her movement. \"Is she a Loup-garoux as well?\" she asked as she grabbed my hand. \"Yeah…why?\" I asked while she looked out the window with alarm and held my hand while stroking it. \"Is something wrong?\" She looked at me before gently smiling back at me and patted my hand firmly before she got to her feet. \"No. Nothing is wrong.\" Then she turned to leave my room and stopped in her tracks. She looked back at me with a troubled expression before walking back to me and stroked my head while looking in my eyes. Then without much warning she wrapped her arms around me and began to cry. I was stunned as I slowly hugged her back while allowing her to cry out her troubles. Vivian waited in the car as Aiden pumped gas into the vehicle at a gas station in Bucharest, Romania. It had taken several days to finally reach their destination; now the hard part began of their search. Where would their daughter be staying? She knew no one that lived here since she spent her whole life in Paris. She guessed to search all available apartment buildings that were renting and possibly any hotels. Astrid walked me to work in the morning and hugged me before leaving to go back to the apartment. I sighed as I walked into the back room to help get some chocolates done and was stopped short when I saw there was a gift for me on the counter. I smiled as I picked the small card off of a stem of a rose that was tied with a black ribbon binding it to the rest of the dozen that stood in the clear vase that was carefully set on the counter where I worked on the chocolates. It was from Zion; and had a small poem on it that spoke his affections for me. I began to slightly blush as I set the card back into its place and moved the vase to the side so I could start my work before going on my chocolate run. Zion stalked throughout the city in search for his brother. He had unfinished business to deal with and he was going to finish it even if it meant him losing his life in the process. There was going to be a hunt in two nights and by then he planned on being the leader of the pack. Chief was getting way out of hand and knew that if he wasn't stopped that Chief might start targeting their mother and pin the pack against itself. Zion stopped outside of an apartment building and looked up at an open window. He sniffed the air, testing the scent that wafted through the slight breeze. It reeked of Chief. This was where he was living. Zion could smell his brother, knowing that he was there with Charr and their infant son, Bane. Zion looked around before jumping on some crates and climbing his way up to the open window. After steadying himself on the windowsill, Zion looked around the inside of the apartment while trying to verify where his brother's exact location was. Zion lightly jumped into the room and stalked through the apartment till he found Charr cradling Bane in her arms. He grabbed a hold of her arm and spun her around. She gasped at the surprise of her brother-in-law's presence and slight attack. \"Zion…\" she breathed out while looking around before looking back him. \"Where is he?\" Zion growled out. Charr gave a confused look and tried to find an answer. \"Where is my brother.\" Zion advanced closer to her causing her to slowly back up and eventually back into the wall. \"Zion. Leave her be!\" Zion turned around to find Chief standing in the doorway of the room. \"Hiding as usual dear brother?\" Zion smirked as he walked away from Charr and stood in front of his elder brother. \"Don't play games with me brother. The one who was always hiding was you! Always denying yourself of who you really were!\" Chief raised his voice. \"Why are you here?\" he growled. \"To end what we had started.\"Zion glared up at his brother and growled. Suddenly without warning Zion pushed his brother back and held him to the wall. Charr ran to the door and slammed it shut and locked it. Then she began to cower in the far corner on the floor while holding her son against her chest. Chief pushed Zion away from him and snarled and both brothers began to circle the other. Zion darted forward and slammed his brother into the coffee table that stood in the center of the living room. The table broke into two pieces under the sudden impact. Chief screamed and kicked Zion off which sent Zion flying into the far wall. Zion winced noticeably as pain shot through his wounds that were just starting to show slight signs of healing from the last escapade he and Chief had at the last hunt. Chief got to his feet and walked over to his fallen brother. He bent down and grabbed Zion by the shirt and lifted him to his feet. \"Face it Zion. You have always been the weaker of the two of us.\" Chief sneered as he held Zion now by the throat. Zion bared his teeth and kicked his brother off of him. Zion then leapt into the air and changed into a wolf. He stood before his brother and growled. Chief rolled out of the way, and climbed up onto his sofa and jumped at his brother as he too transformed into a wolf. Chief landed on top of Zion and grabbed his scruff. He threw his brother onto the floor and tried to get at Zion's throat. Zion swiped at his brother causing the elder wolf to throw his head to the side; Zion took this opportunity and lurched forward and attacked his brother by biting down hard on Chief's throat. Chief screamed and tried to get his brother off of him, but Zion held fast not letting up as he began to draw blood. Chief soon began to slow down and grow weak from both the lack of blood and oxygen. Zion growled while holding his brother's neck in his mouth and watched his sibling slowly slip into death's grasp. Zion dropped his brother's dead body on the floor and licked his lips. He stared down at the limp carcass before snarling and began to tear into his brother's flesh. He stopped when he heard Charr at the door to the bedroom she was shut in. Zion transformed back into his human form and strode over to the door and tested the door handle. It was locked and he listened to hear Charr scurry away crying. He scowled and broke the door open and stepped inside the room. He saw Charr holding his nephew while trying to climb out of the window. Zion stormed over and grabbed her by the arm and flung the both of them back inside. Charr flew back and landed against the far wall, while Bane landed on the floor five feet away from her. He screamed and cried from the pain of the impact against the hard wood floor. Charr went to crawl to him but was too late. Zion picked up the infant and went to walk back over to the window to end Chief's line. Charr screamed and pounced to her feet and grabbed Zion by the arm. With little effort, Zion threw Charr back and proceeded to approach the window. Charr cried in dismay that she couldn't seem to help defend her son. Zion looked down at the baby boy with a blank expression and held him out of the window. Bane opened his eyes and looked at his blood covered Uncle and whined before crying once more. Zion sighed heavily and brought the child close to him and gently patted the infant on the back. He couldn't seem to bring himself to kill the baby. Deep inside he knew that the child could possibly grow to be a threat to his new rule but figured he would give the child a second chance. If the boy grew up knowing to treat his leader with respect; he would make a good pack leader if or when his time came necessary. Zion turned around and walked back to Charr; he bent down and handed over the child. Charr cradled Bane and looked back at Zion with a new found respect and gratitude; he had spared her child's life even when there was a chance at a threat to his rule in the near future. This showed her that Zion was going to be a very forgiving and compassionate, yet stern leader. She bowed her head revealing her neck in thanks. Zion got to his feet and silently walked out of the room to get dressed. Once clothed, he grabbed his brother's body and left the apartment. I walked throughout the busy streets of Bucharest carrying several bags of chocolates that needed to be delivered. Today seemed pretty slow in the shop, so the owner sent me out on my deliveries early and had given me a few more stops than normal. I lightly jumped up a small set of stairs and knocked on the door to a small home. A young woman answered the door and gave me a small smile. I handed her a bag of chocolates and watched as her two young children pranced out to see what type of goodies their mother had received. I smiled and walked off of the porch to make my way to my next stop. I paused in front of a flower store and looked in through the front window and saw Zion at the front counter buying a bouquet of two dozen black and red roses. I smiled and snuck away from the store so he wouldn't notice me. Vivian walked inside the chocolate shop she used to work in and found Astrid standing in front of a glass showcase of chocolates. Astrid turned around thinking it was me, but was shocked speechless only to find her niece standing before her. Both women stood staring at the other for what seemed to be an eternity before Astrid snapped out of her trance and spoke to break the eerie silence that hung in the air. \"Vivian? Is that really you?\" Astrid asked as she slowly approached her niece. By the time she got to Vivian, both of them had tears in their eyes. \"Aunt Astrid.\" Vivian choked out and then all was silenced as they embraced each other in a tight hug. After several minutes, both of them parted and began to talk as they exited the store and headed over to Astrid's apartment accompanied by Aiden.[Chapter 6] I walked back into the chocolate store; I had finished with my chocolate runs and was getting ready for the final preparations before closing up shop for the day. I situated several trays of chocolates and pushed some truffles into their proper places before I heard the front door open and close. \"We are closed!\" I called over my shoulder while I tidied up another tray. I heard the person walk about the store and stop behind me. \"I said we are closed!\" I spun around to find Zion standing behind me with a truffle in his mouth. He smirked and swallowed the last of the treat before greeting me. \"Is that so; I thought that it was open anytime as long as it was me visiting.\" He smiled and tried to grab another truffle but his hand was swatted at by the owner of the store. She scolded him and bustled over to the front window to shift the chocolate stands about to her liking. \"I guess not.\" He chuckled. I smiled and went back to work while being followed by Zion. \"I am almost done. Then we can get going.\" I said as I pushed a chocolate candy in the center of the ring of white chocolate truffles. \"I have a gift for you.\" Zion said as he leaned over me and glanced at me. I looked over at my shoulder and smiled at him. I stepped away and turned to him. \"What is it?\" I untied my apron and hung it up and then was greeted by a bouquet of two dozen roses. \"Oh! Zion! They are beautiful!\" I grabbed the roses from him and smelled them. \"Thank you!\" I smiled and smelled them once more. \"I'll go get the other ones you gave me this morning. I'll be right back!\" I smiled and walked into the back room for the other dozen of roses. \"How is your back and arm?\" I asked as we exited the chocolate shop and headed back to the apartment. \"Sore, but getting better. How is your neck?\" Zion asked as he brushed my hair away to see for himself. I stopped in my tracks and allowed him to inspect the wound. \"Much better I think.\" I felt Zion poke at the edge of one of the bite marks. I gasped and flinched, the flesh was inflamed showing there was slight infection. \"Sorry. It looks good. I think you will be okay. There is very little swelling.\" Zion allowed me to put my hair back. And we began to continue our journey back to the apartment. \"So what brings you back here?\" Astrid asked while handing both Vivian and Aiden mugs of coffee. \"We are looking for our daughter.\" Aiden spoke as he looked over at Vivian with some concern. \"You have a daughter? How wonderful! What does she look like?\" Astrid asked. Aiden grabbed his wallet and dug out a picture of my school photo. Astrid took it and inspected the photo as both Vivian and Aiden explained what was going on. \"She ran away about a month or so ago and we were wondering if she had found her way here and if you have seen her.\" Aiden explained while watching Astrid look at the picture. \"Why did she run away? Surely you are good parents.\" Astrid asked while handing back the photo. \"Vivian?\" Vivian glanced at her aunt and looked back down at her mug and sighed. \"It was over a fight. You see, she is a Loup-garoux like you and me. And she wanted to go out hunting by herself… and…\" Vivian set her mug down on the coffee table and sighed while looking away. \"It was my fault. I was too hard on her. I left her in her room and she escaped and took our car.\" Vivian set her head in her hands and tried to control herself. \"I think we both were to blame.\" Aiden spoke up. \"She was right. I was treating her like she was a beast. I shouldn't have hit her.\" Aiden mumbled out the last of the sentence. Astrid sat in silence and shock. She didn't know what to say. \"Well, didn't you know she was a Loup-garoux?\" \"No. Not until we had the fight.\" Aiden wiped his mouth with his hand out of nervousness. Zion opened the door for me and allowed me to go up the stair case first. \"Do you think I will be accepted into the pack and be able to go on the hunts with you and your mother?\" I asked while ascending the stairs closely followed by Zion. He looked up at me and smiled fondly. \"Maybe. We shall see come the next hunt in a day or so.\" I smiled back as we reached the top of the stairs and walked into the living room. My head snapped forward and my smile faded away and a frown was replaced. \"Mother, who are these people?\" Zion said as he stepped forward. I said nothing as both my mother and father sat in front of me on the couch shocked and silent as stones. \"Zion, this is my Niece Vivian and her husband Aiden.\" Astrid looked at her son hesitantly. Zion stayed silent and stared at the new comers with suspicion. \"They're Ithica's parents.\" Zion's eyes grew wide as he slowly looked over his shoulder at me. I lowered my gaze as he walked over and slowly began to circle me. Vivian stood up and walked up to me; Zion now stood behind me and looked down at me with his head cocked to the side waiting for an explanation. I glared up at her with nothing short of hatred. \"What do you want with me?\" I growled. \"I…we want you to come home. Listen, if we could just…\" \"I'm not going.\" \"What?\" \"You heard me.\" I snapped and looked her in the eye. \"Honey…\" Aiden stood and walked up to both me and Vivian and went to touch my cheek. I stepped back without taking my eyes off of him. I bumped into Zion; I looked over my shoulder slowly and looked deep into his eyes. I could see nothing but disappointment in his gaze. I looked away ashamed that he had to be here to witness this. I looked back at my parents with an irritated and helpless air. I was being put on the spot in an awkward position and I hated it. \"No…not this time. I cannot forgive you…sorry will not work this time.\" I stormed out of the living room down the hall and into my room. Before I entered my room I threw my bouquet of roses onto the floor and slammed the door. Everyone was silent and still soaking up what had happened. Zion stood firm and was staring at the floor; his mind was blank of all thought. How could this happen? Why didn't she tell me? What will happen now? Astrid stood up from her seat and touched Vivian on the shoulder and bowed her head before looking back at her niece. \"I am sorry for not telling you. She came to me several months ago and she finally admitted that you were her mother just the other day. I wasn't planning on you showing up….\" Vivian touched Astrid's hand and walked down the hall and stood outside my door. She raised her hand to knock but hesitated on doing so. She pulled her hand away and walked back out to the living room and grabbed her coat. \"What are you doing?\" Aiden asked as he walked up to his wife. \"We are leaving.\" \"Without Ithica? I thought that is why we came here was to get her.\" \"Not tonight. She needs time to collect herself. We can wait until then. C'mon.\" Aiden sighed and grabbed his coat and followed her out the door. Zion silently glanced at his mother and went to leave the room to retire for the night. \"Zion?\" he stopped in his tracks and looked over his shoulder at his mother. \"I'm so sorry. I didn't know she was family. Otherwise I would have told you…\" he looked away and sighed heavily. Astrid lowered her head in shame and guilt. It was heartbreaking to even imagine what her son must be going through. \"It isn't that mother; though it somewhat is a small fraction. But why didn't you tell me sooner that she was the daughter of the man that killed my father and brother?\" Zion turned around and faced his mother with yellow eyes. \"What have you done?\" Astrid gasped. \"What I had to. For the packs sake. You know of the legends of the twins born in the line of the leaders… neither can keep living while the other breaths the same air and is a part of the same pack. The least suspected twin born of the pure line is the true and rightful leader while the other must be put back to his spot in which life is no longer an option. For the once proud leader will be overthrown by the rightful leader who will forever mate with the female born into the same line of leaders and both shall bring the pack into the age of hope and glory. Both will forever rule unharmed and all shall be prosperous.\" Astrid put her hand to her mouth in shock and dismay as a tear slid down her cheek. \"I will now be the pack leader come the next hunt. Chief's reign has ended.\" And with that said, Zion walked down the hall and into his room. Leaving Astrid alone in the living room to take in the fact that her elder son was now dead. And by the hands of his younger brother no less.[Chapter 7] Early The Next Morning Zion rose out of bed and stretched; he walked over to his bedroom window and looked out at the brightening sky. He sighed and walked toward his door while grabbing a black button up shirt. He shrugged into it as he stepped out into the hall. He stopped in front of my door and looked at it with some sympathy. He walked up to it and listened; nothing. He pressed his ear to the door and listened, still nothing. He knocked gently on the door. There came no reply. He sniffed the air and could tell I was still in the room. He grabbed the door handle and turned it; it was unlocked and he pushed the door open ever so slightly. He peaked in and saw me lying on my bed holding one of my pillows. He invited himself in and sat at the edge of the bed. I closed my eyes and allowed a single tear to escape and soak into the pillow. I could tell that my visitor was Zion. I was too afraid to look him in the eye. Last night left me the impression that he had nothing to do with me anymore and that whatever feelings he had for me were all washed away by the happenings between me and everyone else. I flinched when he touched my shoulder gently. \"What caused you and your family to become separated like this?\" I remained silent and buried my face into the pillow. Zion leaned forward so that his face was mere inches from mine. \"Why won't you answer me?\" I turned my head so that my head was lying on the pillow sideways. I remained still, shocked at how close he was to me. His right hand trapped me on the bed so that I couldn't roll away or move anywhere on the bed. I glanced down and saw that his shirt wasn't buttoned. I quickly looked away and slightly blushed. \"Well?\" \"Because they wouldn't allow me to be what I truly am. I am the only Loup-Garoux that has never tasted the flesh of a human being.\" I whispered and put my face back into the pillow. I lifted my head once more and glanced back at his piercing gaze, \"I thought that you wanted nothing more with me. Don't you wish me to leave?\" \"No.\" \"Huh? But I thought…\" \"I was shocked about yesterday yes; but I wasn't about to send you away. The only one who I would want away is your father.\" I gave a questioning expression and he reluctantly answered. \"You see; 20 years ago tomorrow night. My father, Gabriel, the leader of the pack was killed by a human; and that human was your father.\" He brushed my hair with his left hand while looking deep into my eyes. Then he leaned forward some more and kissed my forehead gently, before rising off of the bed and leaving me lying in my room speechless and confused. Zion got into his brother's navy blue camaro that now belonged to him and drove off to the warehouse. He picked up his cell phone and dialed Greggor; when the older Loup-Garoux answered, Zion instructed him to gather the other hit men and bring the man who killed his father to the warehouse. With that aside, Zion drove the rest of the remaining trip in silence. He smirked at the thought of finally avenging his father. Both him and his brother suffered their entire lives without knowing who their father was. It killed their mother to pretend everything was okay on special occasions or when the twins watched as the other Loup-Garoux children got to learn things from their father's and they couldn't since their father had been murdered before they were born. Everything was going to be decided tonight. Astrid sat down at the table with a mug of hot tea; I sat across from her eating a plate of scrambled eggs with a slice of toast. Neither of us dared speak to the other. Astrid cleared her throat before taking another sip of her tea. I grabbed my glass of orange juice and sipped it daintily. I glanced at her nervously; she returned the same glance before quickly looking away. She sighed heavily while rubbing her thumb on the rim of her mug. I watched her silently; I was almost afraid to ask what the matter was. We both jumped when the phone rang. Astrid glanced back at me before rising to get the phone. I swallowed my egg and went back to eating. I could hear Astrid talking on the phone and thought nothing of it until she came back in the kitchen and looked at me with a panicked expression on her face and spoke my name. I looked up at her with a mouthful of egg and toast. \"Your father has gone missing.\" Astrid spoke softly as she watched my swallow my food in silence. I looked down at my plate in thought in what could have happened. Then I remembered why my parents had arrived in the area and went back to eating. \"That's all? That's all you are going to do?\" Astrid asked showing her anger. \"Look, it isn't my problem! Okay!\" I spat back and slammed my fork down on the table. \"We are talking about your father here!\" Astrid leaned on the table and glared into my eyes. \"I don't care! After what him and my mother did to me I don't care anymore!\" I yelled and pushed away from the table and stormed out of the kitchen and slammed my bedroom door behind me. I slipped into the same black dress that I had worn the night Zion took me to the bar on. I tied on my black bandanna on the top of my head once more. I looked in the mirror before sighing heavily. I nearly jumped out of my skin when I hear someone knock on my bedroom door. \"Who is it?\" I questioned as I slipped my black earth sandals on. \"It's me. Are you decent for me to enter?\" Astrid asked. \"I need to talk to you.\" I walked up to my door and opened it for her. She looked sadly at me before entering my room. I shut the door behind her and watched as she sat on the edge of my bed. She too was clad in a black skin tight dress, ready for the hunt. She held out her arms for me to come over to her. I sat next to her and she held my hands in hers. \"I want to apologize for this morning. I don't want you mad at me for something I don't belong in. Will you forgive me?\" she had tears pooling up in her eyes as she spoke. I wiped away a stray tear from her cheek and nodded gently. \"I do forgive you. I am sorry for yelling at you.\" I hugged her as we both wept in each other's arms. Astrid pulled away and wiped her tears away; I did the same as we smiled at the other. \"Here; this is for you. For your first hunt with the pack.\" Astrid held out a necklace of black beads to me. I bent my head down, allowing her to place it around my neck. \"This is a ritual necklace you will wear to the hunts. Every time you kill a human, you place the human's tooth on the necklace like mine.\" Astrid touched her necklace, showing me that she had several human teeth on it as charms. \"Thank you so much!\" I gave Astrid one more hug before admiring my new necklace. \"Excuse me ladies, am I interrupting anything?\" Zion knocked on the door while peeking in. \"No. Everything is fine. Is it time to go already?\" Astrid got to her feet and walked out of the door. \"You coming?\" Zion smirked at me. I smiled and bowed my head before rising. \"Yes. I am coming.\" I grabbed my trench coat and walked out of my room, and headed out of the door closely followed by Zion. He mounted his motorcycle while Astrid and I got in my car and drove off to the hunting grounds. Vivian paced back and forth in her hotel room with her cell phone to her ear. She could hear the line she was calling ring but no one was picking up. \"Oh GREAT! Astrid and the others went to the hunt didn't they?\" Vivian thought while hanging up and throwing the cell phone on the table. She bit her lower lip in thought while pacing in a small circle on where her husband could possibly be. Suddenly the memory of Zion's expression when they had first met earlier the other day came into mind. \"Oh god.\" She bowed her head before looking up at the ceiling and shaking her head when looking outside her window at the full moon. She then grabbed her car keys and stormed out of the building, heading for the hunting grounds. Deep inside she was hoping that her assumption was wrong as she sped off. Music played as Astrid and I exited her car and walked through the stone archway to see the entire pack bustling about. I licked my lips nervously as I followed Astrid down the stone stairs and stop next to a bolder off to the side. There she spoke to me about joining the pack and told me about the members. I watched them all; I watched the children laugh as they danced and chased their friends around, the teenagers laugh as they talked and some prancing about showing off, the elders talking about the past hunts, the young parents instructing their young to do as their told. I soaked it all in; what each member was to the pack. How precious they all were in their own way. I smiled at the thought of finally being one of them, someone who was needed and appreciated. Someone that could be looked up to for help and guidance. Suddenly all was silent when Zion came into view followed by Charr. All eyes were on him as he stood before them with a grim expression as looked deeply into everyone's eyes, as if reading their souls. \"My Lords and Ladies, I give you distressing news about your leader, Chief.\" Everyone shifted nervously as they kept their gaze on Zion, hanging onto his every word. \"My brother is dead.\" There was a slight murmur in the crowd after hearing of their loss. \"He was murdered. He came from a very proud line of leaders, and yet his good intentions were corrupted by the knowledge of great power and knowing that we both share the pain and loss of our sire.\" Zion looked at his mother as if searching for something hidden. \"But tonight all our suffering shall come to an end. I will now gladly take the place of my brother and father before me and become leader of the pack.\" Charr walked up to Zion and replaced his necklace with his brother's and father before them. He looked down at the necklace before nodding Charr away. She backed away and bowed low before him. Everyone else bowed before him, including me. He bowed back and looked back out at the crowd with his head held high as he took in a deep breath. \"We gather tonight as our ancestors did for all time. The first night of the full moon when we gather as one – for we are one. And we hunt as one.\" He looked at me with an animalistic yearning in his eyes before he went back to his speech. \"We have survived for 5,000 years by hiding who we are. We have been chased from everywhere, England, France, America, but not here. Never here.\" He looked over his shoulder signaling his hit men to come out with three men in tow. One in question was my father, Aiden. I looked over at Astrid with a surprised look in my eyes. She too mirrored my expression and shook her head slightly, telling me that she too had no idea what was going on. Both of our heads snapped forward looking at Zion as he spoke up once more. \"These things before you is called men. But I call it menace. The race of man is corrupt at its core. The only thing it is good at is destruction! And so, once in a while, we must make an example to show this menace that we may be outnumbered, but we will never be outhunted.\" Zion looked as the hit men threw all three men onto the floor. I kept my eyes on my father; my mind kept racing on what to do. Should I hunt him? Should I save him? Everything was so confusing to me. I didn't know if I had forgiven him or not. \"So on this night, let nature grace us to return to who we truly are in the wild where we once lived.\" Zion slid out of his trench coat, and everyone followed his lead in removing what clothes were necessary. Then without a single word spoken, Zion leapt down from his perch and unsheathed the knife his father and brother used and cut all of the men's arms. Their screams caught my untamed attention, their blood smelled sweet, like chocolate. I soon forgot my troubles with my father and shifted anxiously, ready for attack. Zion then removed their blindfolds and cut them lose. \"There is a river within these woods; if you reach the other side you win your life. If not, the Loup-garoux has the victory of taking your lives.\" Zion smirked and allowed the pack to close in around the men to herd them into the forest. Vivian parked her car and raced out of it not bothering to lock the doors as she ran to the ritual hunting area. She could smell blood, it was fresh but faint. This could only mean one of two things; that they either started the hunt, or that the hunt was over and she was too late. She was hoping that the first choice was the right one. She prayed with all her might that she was in time. I raced in the forest with the rest of the pack. I needed to sate my hunger for human flesh. I followed the tantalizing scent of blood, leading deeper into the forest. Zion ran ahead of us, ready to lead in taking down our first victim. After running a little longer, I catapulted myself into the air off of a rock and stretched out. I transformed into my white wolf form and landed on my feet and took off running once more. Charr ran beside me and we had to try and run into each other as we ran as fast as our bodies let us. My ears perked up when the first of the screams pierced through the night air; signaling that the first human was being attacked. I picked up the pace and ran past the first group of wolves that were devouring the human alive. Suddenly a second human screamed as he was being attacked by the other half of the pack. I still continued running past them and headed for my father that was being pursued by Zion. Vivian transformed into a white wolf and headed deeper into the forest, following nothing but the scent of her husband's spilled blood. She had to hurry or it would be too late. She feared for the worst as she strained her body to its limit. Zion leapt into the air and tackled Aiden to the ground. Zion bit at his hands and arms trying to get at Aiden's neck. I caught up to the scene and pushed Zion off of my father. I stood over him and watched as Zion got back onto his feet and growled. I growled back showing that I wasn't afraid in standing up to him. Zion stalked forward and licked his lips as he pulled them back revealing his teeth. I lowered my head and growled while refusing to show my teeth. I was ready to stand my ground and fight if need be. But I didn't want to. Aiden laid still while trying to keep his breathing under control thinking he was safe being guarded by his wife that stood over him. But he was proved wrong when a slightly larger white wolf appeared on the scene. I got tackled off of my father by an unknown force. I landed on my side and looked up to see Zion walk over to me and sniff my face, asking if I was okay. I sniffed his muzzle letting him know I was alright and wasn't hurt. I got to my feet and looked over to where my father was lying to see a larger white wolf standing in front of him with her back hunched and bearing her teeth. Zion stood in front of me and barked at the stranger. He had forgiven me and was now trying to ward off the intruder. This wolf was not a part of the pack; I trotted around the threatening scene to reach my father to try and usher him to safety. Suddenly I was flipped over the other wolf's head, from a very forceful head butt and ended up landing on my back. I squirmed back onto my feet and growled menacingly at the stranger who attacked me for no reason. Suddenly the strange wolf charged and I reared onto my hind feet and we both collided. I snapped at her face trying to get her away from me. She scratched at my sides and tried to get at my scruff. I pushed her away and slammed her off of her feet. This wolf smelled familiar. It hit me like a ton of bricks; it made all too much sense; it was my mother. I lifted my head, showing that I wasn't about to fight anymore and knew who she was. She cocked her head to the side and stalked over to me, while keeping a close eye on Zion who now walked to my side. Vivian stood before me, towering a head higher than me and looked down into my eyes. I lowered my ears and whined. She sniffed my muzzle and nuzzled the top of my head as she whined back. Zion sat next to me and watched the whole touching scene play out. Aiden sat up and watched in amazement as the two white wolves slowly transformed into humans. Vivian hugged me tightly while we both cried in each other's arms. \"I'm so sorry mom.\" I mumbled out around my tears. \"I'm sorry too sweetie.\" She cried out as she stroked my hair. Aiden quickly shrugged out of his jacket and draped it over his wife and daughter. Zion sat silently watching the family bonding together once more. His ears perked up when he heard the sound of a member of the pack heading in our direction. He stood up and walked toward the sound, he sniffed the air and sneezed before testing the growing scent of the member as they approached. He wagged his tail slightly as his mother appeared out of the brush. Astrid looked past her son and wagged her tail when she saw both Vivian and I hugging. Pretty shortly we heard the rest of the pack howling, signaling that the hunt was officially over. Zion looked over at me and sighed and trotted slowly away. I looked over my shoulder in time to see Zion disappear in the shadows. I sighed while still in my mother's arms and closed my eyes, allowing a single tear slid down my cheek for Zion. Zion walked through the forest in search for his clothes. He was alone and seemed to be in a melancholy mood. It had been a rough day, and quite an interesting hunt despite the fact that he didn't get to feast on any human flesh. He knew that I would have eventually defended my father; he had planned it that way. Now that his plan had worked, there was nothing to do. The pack now expected him to find a wife; but he didn't want anyone in the pack. He wanted me. Knowing the fact that was going back to Paris broke his heart. He wouldn't leave the pack; but losing me hurt worse than anything he had been put through. He figured that I wanted to be with my family, and if that made me happy; then he would be happy for me. \"ZION! WAIT!\" he stopped in his tracks and looked over his shoulder and was shocked speechless as I trotted up to him in my father's shirt. I was closely followed by my parents and Astrid. My mother was clad in my father's jacket and Astrid had found her clothing. I grabbed his arm, still standing behind him. I looked into his eyes, desperately searching on how he felt. \"I-I-\" tears welled up in my eyes and I hugged his arm while crying silently. He looked down at me with a heavy heart and took me in his arms. I cried against his chest as he held me gently. He looked up at my parents, seeing them standing next to each other gently smiling at what they saw. He then looked to his mother and saw her wearing a wide smile while wiping a tear from her eye. He then looked down at me and gently laid his head on mine and comforted me as I cried the rest of my confusion. I sat on my bed with my coat resting in my arms. I was returning to Paris with my parents. It was best for me to leave Bucharest; I was no longer needed it seemed. Since the hunt, Zion had made himself scarce and Astrid was trying her hardest to distance herself from me so that when I left it didn't hurt so badly. I looked down at my hands and bit my lower lip; I was trying to feel happy about being with my parents. But I couldn't help but feel heartache about leaving the city since I had gotten attached to the city and the people in it, especially Zion. \"Are you ready to go?\" Vivian popped her head in my room. I looked up at her and smiled softly while nodding. I sniffed and tucked a hair behind my ear before rising to my feet. \"Everything is packed in the car.\" Vivian wrapped her arm around my shoulders as we walked down the hall. I nodded and paused when I felt watched. I looked to my right, and inside the living room stood Zion leaning against the wall with his arms crossed at his chest. His eyes seemed to have pierced my soul as he stared right into my eyes. My mother pulled at my arms and lead me down the stair case that lead outside where my father was waiting at their car. Zion bowed his head after seeing me disappear out of sight in the building. \"Oh, honey! We're going to miss you!\" Astrid walked up to me and hugged me tightly. I hugged her back and cried several tears knowing that I would never see her again. \"I'm going to miss you too, Astrid.\" I choked out. I sighed as I tried to make the hug last longer. We pulled away and I went to get into my parents' car but was stopped by Astrid. \"What about your car, dear?\" she asked with a worried look. \"You can keep it as a gift to remember me by.\" I smiled over my shoulder before getting into the vehicle. With one last look at the place, the car sped off back to Paris; never to be seen again. Astrid covered her mouth and tried her hardest not to cry; but it was inevitable. She bowed her head and slowly walked back inside the apartment building while trying to control her tears. By the time she reached the top of the stairs, she was tired from the struggle of fighting away the rest of her sorrow; that she burst out into huge fits of crying. She stumbled her way into her room and shut the door behind her and cried out her sadness on her bed. Zion remained standing alone in the living room. He opened his eyes and allowed a single solitary tear to fall from his eye. It fell silently onto the wood floor; Zion pushed away from the wall and swallowed his feelings before storming into his room for the rest of the day. One Month Later Astrid stood next to the kitchen counter in her robe drinking a mug of coffee. Her thoughts were pushed aside when Zion stalked into the room looking like he didn't have a wink of sleep and that he had gotten into a wrestling match with a bear. He looked around the kitchen as if he was searching for something. \"Would you like me to get you something, sweet heart?\" Astrid asked trying to sound somewhat cheerful. Zion stopped next to the kitchen table and looked down at it. He grimaced and flipped it over with a single hand before storming out of the room and building. He climbed into the camaro and sped off to the bar. Astrid sipped on her coffee quietly and shook her head sadly. \"You're just like your father. I hope you know that. I know you miss her.\" She spoke out loud to herself, before finishing the last of her coffee before calling a repair man for the table. Zion sat at the counter of the bar, huddled over a shot glass of Absinthe. He had been drinking a hefty amount of it. He knew full well that if he drank too much of it, it could kill him. He was attempting to drown out the music and the memory of me. The singer was singing the same song that he dance with me the night he found out that Charr was carrying Chief's child; 'Let yourself go wild'. \"Maybe you should slow it down a little on the drinks.\" Drago the bartender suggested as he grabbed several empty Absinthe glasses off of the counter to be washed. Zion glared at him tiredly and shrugged before downing his fourth glass. \"I'm just at a loss in what to think or do anymore.\" Zion sighed as he slid the glass away for Drago to snatch before it could slide right off of the counter. \"Why not go out on the dance floor and see who could catch your fancy. You know that always worked before.\" Drago leaned on the counter and cocked his head out to the dance floor behind the pack leader. \"I can't do that anymore. No one catches my attention anymore. They all are the same to me.\" Zion laid his head on the counter and sighed heavily. \"What are you sick or something? What is so different about you, that you no longer want to go girl chasing anymore?\" Drago lowered his head and looked into Zion's eyes. Zion looked away sadly and buried his head in his arms. \"You already found someone and she left you is that it?\" Zion's head shot up and he stared darkly at the bartender; warning him to not venture further on the subject. Drago straightened up and shrugged as he poured Zion one last glass of Absinthe. Zion took it willingly and downed it in a second. \"She didn't leave me. I let her go.\" Zion sighed and slid the glass away. \"What do you mean by letting her go?\" \"She wasn't one of the pack. She was one of us true enough but wasn't accepted into the pack yet. I let her go back to where she came from with her family.\" Zion crossed his arms and looked down at them while reclining in his stool. \"Man why did I let her go!\" Zion slammed his head down on the counter top and let it stay there. Drago sighed and shook his head and reached over and patted the young leader on the back. \"There there. I'm sure she misses you too….\" Drago comforted before going back to his duties of cleaning off the counter and serving others Absinthe or whatever they wished. Zion rolled his head so that he was having the side of his face resting on the smooth counter top. One last heavy sigh escaped him, before he eventually rose and decided to leave the bar and go back to the apartment. I sulked in my bedroom. I was back in Paris and didn't seem to feel happy of being back home with my parents. They seemed happy to have me back, but I seemed to feel incomplete; like something was missing. I hugged my pillow and buried my face into it and sighed heavily into it. I didn't flinch when there was a sudden knock on my bedroom door. I picked my head up slightly to respond. \"Come in.\" I muttered and slammed my head back down into the pillow as the door swung open revealing both of my parents. They walked into my room and stopped in front of my bed. Vivian inched to the side of the bed and sat down next to me with a worried expression. She touched the top of my head, I refused to move my head as she began to stroke my hair gently. \"Ithica? Is everything alright? Do you need to talk to us about something?\" Vivian asked gently. I moved my head so that I was looking at her in the eye. \"No. I'm fine.\" I then stuffed my face back into pillow. \"Why are you doing that?\" Aiden asked as he leaned on the foot of my bed. I muffled my reply into the pillow. \"What was that again?\" I raised my head and took a deep breath. \"I am trying to suffocate myself. But you keep interrupting me.\" I spat back and shoved my head back into the pillow once more. \"Oh! Come on honey, things aren't that bad here. What is wrong?\" Vivian took away my pillow and had me sit up. I sighed and fixed my hair. \"I miss Romania. Ok; there I said it.\" I crossed my arms and waited for a reply. \"Don't you like it here?\" Aiden asked as he seated himself at the end of the bed. I looked down at my lap and tried to fight some tears that threatened to surface. \"Yeah I guess, but I miss him. I miss him, so much.\" I choked out and allowed my mother to hug me close to her. After a while of crying, I fell fast asleep in my mother's arms. Vivian allowed Aiden to take me from her and resituate me properly on my bed. They then left my room and began to talk about what to do. Eventually they ended up in agreeing to allow me to go back to Romania if I wished. I woke to the sound of birds flapping their wings against the glass of my window. I raised my head inches from my pillow and looked at my window to see the birds panic and fly away. I rubbed my eyes and looked around my room to see that I was completely alone. I sat up and stretched my arms over my head. I fixed my hair and slid off of my bed. I fixed my clothes and trudged out of my room and headed down stairs, heading into the kitchen. I paused before entering when I heard my parents talking to each other about something. I then walked into the kitchen and saw them sitting at the table, both with a mug of coffee in their hands. \"Hey.\" I yawned and watched as they looked at me with grim expressions. \"Is something wrong?\" I asked now fully awake with a twinge of fear creeping throughout my body. \"Honey, we have to talk to you about something. Something important.\" Vivian spoke up and couldn't seem to keep direct eye contact with me. I slowly walked over to the table and seated myself across from them where I always sat when we had any meals together as a family. \"Okay, what is it?\" I asked as I glance nervously at my father who looked down at his mug. He sighed heavily before speaking. \"Ithica, your mother and I have done some talking and some soul searching and we couldn't think of anything that could help you…\" he looked at me with a sad expression, I shifted nervously in my seat waiting to hear what was coming next. \"The only thing that we could come up with is that if you wish, you could go back to Bucharest.\" My father looked at me waiting to see what my reaction was. I sat still in my chair, speechless on the subject; I couldn't move I was so stunned. He rubbed the back of his neck and looked up to the ceiling before looking back at me once more. \"So, what do you think?\" I looked at my mother wondering if this was a joke or a test on what I should do. But to my surprise she looked down at her hands and glanced up at me and nodded toward my father, encouraging me to answer. I looked back at my father with a shocked and clueless expression. \"Are you serious? Or is this some kind of joke or something?\" I exasperated and looked around for an answer. I had finally found my voice, despite the fact it was slightly shaky. \"We're serious, honey. We thought it all through and if it makes you happy to go back to Bucharest. Then we will be more than happy to let you go.\" My mother smiled. \"Really?\" I smiled slightly. They both nodded in agreement. \"And hey, we'll come by every so often to visit you so you don't go missing us. How does that sound?\" my dad piped up and set his mug down. I smiled and got to my feet and walked over to them and hugged them tightly, and began to cry several tears. \"Thank you so much!\" I sobbed and pulled away. \"Well, I better go get packing.\" I chuckled slightly and jogged back up to my room. Aiden and Vivian smiled and looked at each other with a sigh of relief. \"You think we are doing the right thing?\" Vivian asked looking back over her shoulder. \"I have no idea.\" Aiden answered and stretched in his chair. \"But I am going to miss her.\" \"I am going to miss her too.\" Vivian smiled and wiped away a single tear before rising to take away the mug to the sink. I was slightly tired from the trip back to Bucharest; I had taken a train the whole way and was now stuck in a cab. I was on my way back to Astrid's apartment. I glanced out of the window and watched the surroundings become more familiar. I smiled as I passed a huge statue of an angel spreading its wings. And soon I passed a building that had statues of wolves as décor; I couldn't help but feel relieved about returning back to where I felt I belonged the most. I lost all track of time, and within a short time the cab came to a screeching halt in front of a very familiar apartment building. I opened my door and stepped out and waited for the cabdriver to unpack my things from the trunk and receive the fare for driving me. Once everything was in order, the cab sped off leaving me alone. I picked up my bags and walked inside the building and headed up the stairs. \"Hello?\" I called out as I reached the top, \"Anyone home?\" I called out once more. Suddenly Astrid poked her head out of the kitchen and peeked around the corner to see me standing in the hall. I turned around and saw Astrid standing at the end of the hall just outside of the kitchen. I smiled and dropped my bags. \"I'm back.\" I smiled breathlessly, while taking in Astrid's shocked expression. \"Oh….god…honey!\" Astrid sighed out and jogged over to me. We embraced and cried out of joy. \"Oh…how we missed you!\" Astrid cried into my hair. I clung to her almost afraid to let her go out of slight fear that she would disappear. \"I am so happy to see you.\" She wept on and stroked my hair gently. \"I missed you so much! I had to come back!\" I gasped and tried to control my tears and breathing. We eventually pulled away from the hug, both wiping tears away and fixing our hair. \"Where is Zion?\" I asked and looked around to see that we were alone. Astrid helped me with my bags and walked with me to my room. \"He is getting things prepared for another hunt. He is I believe at the distillery, but I can't say for sure.\" Astrid walked into my room closely followed by me. I stopped next to the closest window and dropped my bags. Astrid set the other bags on my bed and spun on her heels to face me once more. \"Now that you are one of the pack; you will be attending. Since he won't show for the rest of the day, you have plenty of time to get things organized and get ready for tonight.\" Astrid then left me alone in the room to unpack my belongings and get cleaned up for the hunt. It was nightfall and I walked silently out of my room and stopped in the living room where Astrid sat on the couch. She looked up at me and smiled gently and asked me to spin around for her. I did what I was told and watched her gaze at me like a proud mother seeing her daughter going off on her first date or the prom. \"You look beautiful.\" Astrid smiled as she rose to her feet. \"Let's get going before we are late.\" She drove us in my car, the whole way we talked about how my parents gave into allowing me to stay here in Bucharest, while they stayed in Paris. We finally arrived at the hunting grounds and parked the car. After climbing out, we walked down into the small clearing just outside of the forest. The music played as children giggled and teased the older teens. I watched them with a full heart knowing I was finally where I belonged; with them. \"In fear I hurried this way and that. I had the taste of blood and chocolate in my mouth, the one as hateful as the other. Remember this; Steppenwolf. Astrid smiled when I looked at her before nodding. \"I told that to your mother years ago on a night like this one before a hunt. It was before she left with your father and lived out in Paris.\" Astrid was cut off by the sound of Zion approaching the area. The music halted and the crowd's conversations murmured down as they beheld their leader. They all bowed down, I bowed next to Astrid and we all waited for Zion to respond. He bowed and stood watching us all rise and gaze up at him with anticipation. He looked out into the crowd and sighed before starting his speech. \"My Lords and Ladies, tonight we gather together on the night of the full moon to hunt. I am also aware that as leader I am to choose a wife to have for seven years…\" Zion stopped talking when his gaze landed hear his mother. She smiled happily and moved to the side to reveal me standing, watching him with a smile. He seemed frozen on the spot and at a loss for words. Zion leaped off of the bolder he was standing on and walked up to me. I looked up into his eyes as he did the same to me. \"How is this possible…\" he whispered. \"I'm here to stay.\" I swallowed hard trying to not get too emotional. I was suddenly pulled into his arms and was stunned speechless when he kissed me. The pack members whispered and looked about one and other in shock and awe at what they were witnessing. Zion broke the kiss and leaned his forehead against mine and smiled. I breathed out a giggle and smiled back. \"I love you.\" I whispered. \"I love you too.\" Zion then looked out at the pack and wrapped one arm about my waist. \"I have chosen my wife!\" he announced. The pack applauded and cheered in approval. \"Further more; I abolish the law of having a wife for seven years and now establish the law of the leader of the pack having one wife, and keeping her for life!\" Zion spoke out to the pack; they cheered even louder in agreement. Astrid was so happy that she was failing the losing battle of fighting away more tears. Zion lead me back to the top of the boulder and went on with his speech. After the victims were brought out, he allowed the pack to lead the hunt. Within a short time, we all were running through the forest after our prey. This hunt was special compared to all the others; we were hunting as one, and being free. We all turned into our wolf forms and sped through the dark forest. Once the hunt was over, the night was filled with our soulful chorus that was filled with the sense of hope for the future of the pack. And thus beginning a new chapter in mine and Zion's lives. I nuzzled the side of his neck with my head sighed as we stood among the pack. We were all truly one and all had the same goal in our bright future to come. Zion stood proud and licked the top of my head and wagged his tail slightly as he did so. There was no going back now; both Zion and I now had great responsibilities to fulfill and expectations to live up to. And as leaders of the pack, we vowed to see it done. We all stood together one last time and howled into the night one last time; before the dawn of a new day. The end[Chapter 8] This is to all the readers and people who commented.

","Summary":" Blood and Roses Sequel of Blood and Chocolate / When we are children, we believe the world is full "},{"Movie":"Mummy, 2017","Title":"What you Deserve","Author":"Accidental-Ducky","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12912706","Passage":"[Chapter 1] When a then eighteen year old Samantha Blake told her parents that she was planning to go into the military, she'd actually thought it was a good idea. She had a background that involved a lot of physical training and handling guns of all shapes and sizes, she was stubborn enough to survive basic training, and she had a pretty calm nature that would help her in times of crises. Her mother had rolled with the news and gave a bright, beaming smile that always made Sammi feel loved. Eva Blake was kind and optimistic above all else, which made her a fantastic preschool teacher. Jared, on the other hand, was a completely different story. He had disapproved of Samantha's decision only because he didn't like to think of his only child in mortal danger. He came around, of course, and by the time Samantha was twenty, he even owned a camouflage shirt with My daughter can kick your honor student's ass printed in yellow on it. He was very proud. At the beginning, even with the intensive training and yelling of the higher-ups, Samantha was determined to prove herself as a decent enough soldier. The only real problem she seemed to have was her ability to sniff out trouble like a bloodhound sniffed out a deer carcass. Promotions and demotions seemed to go hand-in-hand for her, not that she really cared about what rank she was. And now, a year shy of forty, she was seriously starting to wonder if she had made the right choice twenty-one years ago. If she had just kept her head down, she'd probably be in Dallas working at Blake's Antiquities, far from Iraq and the insurgents currently firing round after round into some old statues. \"I could've had a dog,\" she mutters. \"What,\" Chris asks, looking over at her. All but his eyes were covered by a heavy scarf to protect his face from the sand and heat, but she could see his curiosity just the same. \"I'm just thinking out loud again.\" She waves it off and focuses back on the group of men gathered below, none of them aware of the three people on the ridge. \"Is that guy seriously standing half a foot from the crossfire and beating at the statues with a sledgehammer?\" \"Looks like it. You know, we used to have smart guys that we stole stuff from, but now it's just…\" He gestures at the group of men, giving a disappointed sigh. \"They're like Disney villains or something.\" Kneeling between the pair, Nick doesn't say anything as he continues to watch the on-going stupidity. \"Do you seriously want a dog?\" \"What?\" \"Earlier, you said something about getting a dog. Do you want one?\" \"Not particularly. I was just musing on what might've been different if I'd stayed home all those years ago.\" Back in the clinging humidity of a Texas summer, cousins always nearby due to how close their families were, grandparents bickering about their glory days. It was appealing, but it would've been boring as all hell. \"I think I'd rather be here.\" \"Seriously? Were you dropped on your head as child or something?\" \"Yeah, but my uncle said it was an accident,\" she teases with a smile he couldn't see. Like the other two, she had a headscarf wrapped around her to serve as protection from the heat as well as to hide the tangled mess of her black hair. She'd learned that she got more respect from locals when they thought she was a teenaged boy than when they learned she was actually a woman. Not that she was complaining, she got to wear pants this way, though Greenway was always berating her for not being in uniform. \"Maybe one day we'll have long enough off to go and visit the Blake clan. You and my great-uncle could compare yellow streaks.\" \"I'm not a coward, I just have a little instinct called self-preservation . Unlike you two, I'd like to be old and gray before I kick the bucket.\" She grins and sends a wink his way, Chris shaking his head. \"Think about it, though, we could be that clichéd old couple that sits in rocking chairs on the front porch and drinks iced tea.\" \"Watching the grandkids play in the yard with the dog?\" \"And we'd have a croquet set near the pink flamingo thingies.\" \"That sounds perfect right about now.\" \"Do you two mind,\" Nick asks, talking for the first time since he crouched in the sand ten minutes ago. \"One of us is trying to work.\" \"More like you're trying to get us court marshalled again. I gotta tell ya, Nick, that last time was no fun.\" \"Don't get dramatic on me, Sammi. I got us out of that easy. If it wasn't for me, you two wouldn't be planning your retirement right now.\" \"If it wasn't for you, we wouldn't have gotten court marshalled in the first place,\" Chris returns dryly. Nick stands up, still staring through the crusty lenses of the binoculars he refused to share. \"Back to the matter at hand, it looks like we're shit outta luck this time around.\" \"Nah, we can do this.\" Chris and Samantha share a look for a moment, realizing Nick's plan a second later and following after him to the horses. The terrain under their feet was rocky but became sand closer to the bottom of the slope, making running a difficult task. \"Hell no! Command thinks we're doing advanced recon a hundred miles from here and I know Greenway would mount our heads on his wall if we die doing something so stupid as rushing head-first at a bunch of armed insurgents .\" \"Chris is right,\" Samantha adds, angrily shedding the robes that were trying to tangle around her ankles,\" this is beyond idiotic!\" Nick sends her a quick glance over his shoulder, only half paying attention to the stolen papers he was stuffing in his saddlebag. \"Don't give me that look, I don't like that look, Nick. That look usually means some kind of cut scene and then nearly getting my goddamn head blown off.\" \"I don't know about you, but I kind of like her head where it is. I've had some good conversations with her head still on her shoulders.\" Nick doesn't slow down, continuing the prep that had become more than familiar over the past fifteen years. With a sigh, Samantha joins in and moves to check her kit—medical supplies, army-issued knife, pistol. \"Oh, not you, too.\" \"Can't let him go down there by himself.\" \"Then we're at least calling in an air strike.\" \"An air strike,\" Nick repeats incredulously. \"That's a horrible idea, Vail.\" \"Just a tiny one, okay? Just a small boom that'll have the insurgents running away!\" \"And command will know where we are.\" \"And we'll do twenty years in Leavenworth for looting.\" Chris seemed resigned now, scarf dangling loosely around his neck from the headpiece of it. Samantha yanks her own scarf off and drops it to the ground, wisps of her hair falling out of the braided bun she'd put it up in that morning. \"We're not looters, we're liberators of precious antiquities.\" Chris and Samantha finished the last part of the sentence with him, the mantra intimately familiar. It was supposed to make them feel less shitty about stealing antiques and selling them to the highest bidder, but mostly it just felt as old and tired as Samantha did sometimes. \"That's great and everything, but we still have no clue what's down there. For all I know, we could be risking our necks for a medieval toaster oven.\" \"Medieval toaster ovens are rocks, babe,\" Samantha comments, looking up from securing the strap of her bag. \"We got those all over the place.\" \"You know what I mean. Stop being such a smartass when I'm trying to drill some common sense into our fearless leader.\" \"Let me know how that goes for ya.\" Nick brings a piece of printer paper out of his bag again, tapping it almost angrily. \"Sarge, chill out with all the pointing.\" \"What's that say, Sammi,\" Nick asks, thrusting the paper out for her to see. Haram was written in bold strokes in the center of the paper, probably with some kind of fountain pen that had been modified to hold ink better since there were no splotches. Below the word was coordinates, the same ones that she knew would match up with the village below them. \"Do you really want me to answer or would you prefer to wow us with your theatrics?\" \"It says Haram , and we all know that means treasure.\" \"It doesn't actually.\" \"It means forbidden knowledge,\" Chris snaps, looking dangerously close to stamping his foot. \"You'd know that if you'd paid any attention to our translator! Around here, forbidden knowledge can usually be translated into ancient mummies will kill you slowly! I don't know about you all, but I wouldn't put it past ancient Mesopotamians to curse an entire village!\" \"Or there could be a room filled with treasure down there somewhere that this Henry guy wants as badly as you two want plastic flamingos in your front yard.\" \"I don't actually want flamingos,\" Samantha interjects, raising her hand. \"I'm more of a lawn gnome kind of gal.\" Nick and Chris send her unimpressed looks and she waves the rambling off again. \"You're right, we can talk about lawn decorations later.\" \"My point is if we get the treasure, then we can probably get the dude that wrote this letter to pay double.\" He swings gracefully into his saddle and Samantha would stake her thumbs on the fact that he was part elf or something. \"Mount up.\" Knowing she'd get yelled at for at least four hours if she allowed a superior officer to run into danger alone—she already had the Colonel's command tent memorized from past incidents—she follows suit and takes up the reins in one hand. \"Nah, it's not happening,\" Chris argues. \"We're stayin' here this time.\" \"She's already on her horse, Vail.\" \"Good, then she and I can head back the way we came towards civilization and gun-toting maniacs we can trust.\" \"Vail, don't make me do this.\" Nick brings out his knife, the metal edge winking in the sunlight. Samantha liked when metal did that, the flash of light reminding her of a camera flair and summer afternoons with her family. \"You gonna stab me? I'd like to see you try because we all know I'm faster than you.\" He wasn't, but Samantha didn't burst his bubble. \"Come on, man, do it.\" He holds out his arms, baring his chest beneath the olive-green tee. But Nick had another idea in mind, the sharp blade of his knife cutting through the leather canteen that held their only scrap of water. \"What the fuck? It's gonna take us a whole day to get more water now!\" \"There's a well in that village with clean water. Where's your sense of adventure?\" \"I must have left it in my other pants!\" He really did stamp his foot this time, throwing his scarf to the ground in his temper tantrum. \"You're such a dick!\" \"Would you relax? We'll just slip in and slip out before they even realize someone's there.\" Samantha bites her lip, urging her horse up next to his so that she could look down the slope again. The village was empty apart from the troublemakers, the gunfire echoing like fireworks. Maybe it's possible . Except her gut was saying the opposite, intuition telling her that it would be safer to wait it out until the men below them grew bored and moved on. Too bad Nick's intuition had shriveled up and died in infancy. Twenty minutes, two empty magazines, and a fracture later, Samantha realized this was definitely not a slip-in-slip-out type of job. She also decided the best way to kill Nick would be with some clothespins and a whole lot of lemon juice. \"We make it out of this alive, Morton, and I'll kill you with my bare hands,\" she screams as they continue in a dead sprint through the village. \"Love you too, Sammi!\" Another sharp turn and a hail of gunfire had them dropping to the ground and sliding over the rough floor, her fractured ankle throbbing when it hits a wall. She bites back a scream of pain, forcing herself back to her feet to stumble after the other two. Neither of them seemed able to stay up, all three of them tripping over each other in a mad dash to get away from the gunmen coming up behind them. Another sharp turn and then the three of them were tumbling inside an abandoned shop, Nick kicking the door shut behind them. \"Slip in, slip out,\" Chris screams shrilly, shooting at some of the men coming up behind them. \"This isn't that, Nick! This isn't what we always do!\" \"Get to the stairs!\" Samantha grabs the back of Chris' shirt and hauls him up before taking off again up some stairs that led out onto a veranda on the second floor. Out of ammo and running low on patience, Samantha throws her useless pistol at one of the men, managing to bring him to his knees as she started up a second set of stairs. Chris was waiting for her on the roof, jutting his hip out for her to take the spare pistol he'd brought along. \"Grenade!\" \"Goddammit,\" Samantha shrieks as she's launched onto the next roof by the force of the blast. She rolls onto her back with a grunt of pain, quickly snuffing out the small flames trying to eat through her Pink Floyd top. \"I hate you,\" Chris roars, kicking his legs against the roof. \"I didn't even wanna come to this country!\" The three of them huddle up against the side of the roof where they had some decent cover, Samantha's hands shaking as she attempts to turn off the safety. \"Just let me think for a second,\" Nick yells back, panicked. With a growl of frustration, she attempts to fight off the effects of her adrenaline, forcing her hands to steady so she could flick the safety off and chamber a round. \"If anyone is listening, this is L-26, urgent, hot!\" She looks over her shoulder, finding Chris yelling into the walkie. She doesn't focus on that for long, turning to face a crumbling wall that would probably reach her thighs had she been standing, using it as cover as she begins firing round after round at the men on the ground. Even in her panicked state, she's able to hit a few of them as she relies on the years of training she's had. \"Did you just call in an air strike?!\" \"Yes, 'cause I'm gonna take these bastards down with me if I have to die here!\" Samantha drags the men to the ground with her seconds before a rifle shot clipped the top of the wall, knocking more rubble down on them. \"Son of a bitch! This is not how I wanted to spend my Saturday afternoon!\" \"Come on,\" Samantha growls, yanking him after her. They keep low as they run, dropping down onto a lower roof and then up onto another one after that as the bullets zipped past them through the air. \"Where do they keep comin' from?\" They attempt a third jump only to be driven back by more men. Are they popping out of the fucking desert or what , she thinks irritably as she dives down once more. On top of her swelling ankle, she's got minor burns along her shoulders and now she's pretty fucking sure her ribs are bruised. \"We're gonna die!\" \"Shut up and let me think,\" Nick yells again, pinching the bridge of his nose. \"We're gonna die and it's gonna be all your fault!\" \"Let me think!\" \"Are you sure your capable of that,\" Samantha retorts, punching his arm as hard as she could. \"Because it seems like the only part of you that does any thinking is your dick! I'm never gonna own a gnome now and it's all your fault!\" Each word was punctuated by another hard punch to his arm until he squirmed out of her way. \"I'm thinking!\" \"What are you thinking,\" Chris demands, the vein in his forehead bulging out. \"Huh, genius?\" \"I'm thinking… We're probably gonna die here.\" The muscle in Chris' jaw was twitching as he pounded his fist against the roof with a growl. There was a high whistle and a massive explosion when Chris' fist made contact a second time, then men were shouting and getting the hell out of dodge. After sharing a shocked look, they crawl over to the edge of the roof and peer down at the crater left behind, the sand scorched black from the flames. \"You see? My air strike came in handy! What did you do that was actually useful today?!\" Samantha lets her head fall down onto her arms, heaving out a sigh of relief at the fact that she still had a pulse. \"Oh, thank fuck,\" she breathes. They were given second of peace to gather their wits, Chris and Samantha latching onto each other in a tight hug. The moment didn't last long, however, the building giving a rough jolt that had them straightening up again to look at the stone beneath their knees. \"That's not good, that's not good!\" The front of the building caves in underneath them, sending them tumbling down with the other rubble. The sand seemed to suck her in, drawing her further and further from the remains of the shop until she was in freefall, flailing arms catching on rough stone and instinct having her cling to it for all she was worth. She lets out a pained groan, blinking the sand out of her eyes so she can see what exactly she was holding onto. \"What in the hell?\" Looking up, she could see part of an eye, the bridge of the nose she was clinging to, and a high sloping forehead carved from dark stone that had degraded over time. Beneath her was an opened mouth and a yawning hole that went too far down into the earth for her to make out. \"Guys, get me out of here!\" \"Babe, look at me,\" Chris says. Samantha tilts her head back in order to make him out, the dusty cellphone in his head making a faint clicking sound as he snapped a picture. \"Why?\" It was a simple question and she didn't feel like she could manage anything more sophisticated than that at the moment. The muscles in her shoulders were screaming at her to just let go and let gravity do its job, but she adjusts her grip and holds on tighter to the rock. \"You look like a booger.\"[Chapter 2] Samantha was just beginning to wonder how much worse her day could get when she heard the booming voice of Colonel Greenway somewhere above her. Suddenly letting herself fall into the black pit of possible death and scorpions was much more appealing than it had been an hour ago. \"And just what the hell do you think you're doin' down there, Blake,\" he yells, looking down at her in the crater. She had settled herself into the statue's opened mouth, feet dangling over the edge and one hand holding onto the smooth stone. \"Just hanging out, sir,\" she calls up to him, squinting behind the lenses of her cracked sunglasses. \"How's your day been treatin' you?\" Greenway doesn't respond, scowling down at her like she was a misbehaving child. Come to think of it, that wasn't too far off the mark. \"Why the hell aren't you in uniform?\" \"I didn't expect to get dragged all the way out here this morning, sir. I had the day off before Tweedledee and Tweedledum screwed it up.\" \"I find it hard to believe you had nothing to do with that scenario. How about I run one by you all that even Blake can understand: Three assholes from long-range reconnaissance, that's y'all, traipse all over Iraq in search of valuables that they can sell on the black market in order to pad their retirement funds. All the while, you got the idiot insurgents that don't even know they're covering up your tracks by just doin' what they do best. That sound familiar to any of you?\" Samantha keeps quiet, focusing more intently on her boots than the angry superior above. If I look up, he might bite my head off . \"Sergeant Morton!\" There's a loud smacking sound that drew her attention to the top of the crater, craning her head back to see the new woman that was talking. \"Where is it, you cretin?\" \"What's going on up there,\" she yells. \"Nick just got slapped so hard I felt it,\" Chris calls down to her with a crooked grin. \"Where are my papers,\" the woman demands, louder this time around. And all of a sudden, Samantha realized what had went down almost a week ago. All of them had gathered in a local bar since they knew they had some downtime coming up the next day, drinking a little more than was wise at their age. Nick had wandered off with an archeologist of the blonde variety at some point, though Samantha had been more focused on getting Chris' belt undone. What was her name again? Jane, Jess? \"I don't know what you're talking about,\" Nick says a little too quickly. \"I don't even know your name.\" \"Really, you wanna go that route? I had sex with Morton three nights ago and then he stole my map and letter while I was sleeping. I feel I should congratulate you on acting like a human being for fifteen seconds, I'm sure it was a record.\" Samantha lets out a snort of laughter, covering her mouth with her free hand to muffle the sound. \"Well, that's just rude.\" \"Where's the goddamn map,\" Greenway demands, anger still simmering in his voice. Nick launches into a long explanation, one of many he'd practiced over the years, as the blonde woman comes to stand at the lip of the crater and look down. Jenny, that's her name! And she was pretty, too, but not really the type that would stand out in a crowded bar unless someone had a specific type. Or , she adds mentally , papers they wanted to steal . \"Hey,\" Samantha greets with a pleasant smile, swinging her feet back and forth. \"Exciting day, huh?\" \"Why are you sitting in the mouth of an Egyptian statue,\" she asks, brows furrowed. \"Well, I was hanging from the nose, but then Chris kept calling me a booger. I figured the mouth was a safer choice anyway.\" Samantha and Jenny share eye contact for a moment, the latter looking on in disbelief while the former seemed completely at ease with the situation. \"Nice scarf.\" \"Uh, thanks. I got it at Target.\" \"Would someone get Lieutenant Blake out of that damn hole,\" Greenway shouts. \"I have a hard enough time takin' her seriously, but I can't do it at all while she's just sittin' in that mouth like it's normal.\" \"Wait a second, this is actually Egyptian. This shouldn't be here at all, unless…\" Jenny's eyes widen and then she's sprinting away, beginning to shout out orders. \"Is this thing really Egyptian,\" Chris asks, squinting in the harsh sunlight. Samantha shrugs and runs her hand over the bottom lip of the statue, smooth and cracking in places. \"How can she tell?\" \"It's really not that hard,\" Samantha tells him. \"All the ancient civilizations had their own distinct styles, and anyone trained to spot the differences would be able to tell. I'd guesstimate that it's at least five thousand years old, give or take.\" \"How do you know that? You barely ever paid attention in your classes.\" \"Some things just stick, Chris.\" There's some more talking aboveground, too low for Samantha to make out properly. \"Now what's goin' on?\" Chris holds up a finger to signal patience, but hers was in short supply these days. A moment later, Greenway's head appeared with that scowl still in place. Samantha was almost certain he came out of the womb with a scowl and a cigar. \"Are you gonna tell me what's happening up there or should I just start throwin' out guesses?\" \"You three are gonna help Halsey check out that pit,\" he calls down to her, the smugness in his voice making her regret ever saying hello to Chris all those years ago. \"Looks like you're stayin' down there a while longer, Blake.\" \"Wonderful.\" It was another five minutes before the other three began to rappel down the steep wall, Chris holding an extra rig that Samantha carefully slid into. The vinyl straps and heavy pack were preferable to the hard stone she'd been sitting on, the steady release of the cord lowering them down without a hitch into an enormous chamber below. There was barely any sand to be found, which led Samantha to believe the domed stone overhead used to be part of a ceiling before the air strike blew it to pieces, some clumps of dark stone spread across the floor like toys a giant had discarded. Like the statue she had become intimately familiar with, the structures in the cavern were made of a smooth black stone that was slick beneath her gloved hands. \"I'm in a large antechamber of some kind,\" Jenny says into a tape recorder, looking around her in a state of wonderment. It was like a kid at Christmas, seeing the presents Santa left under the tree for the first time and wondering if the Red Ryder BB gun was hidden amongst them. \"If this is just the antechamber, can you imagine how big the other rooms must be,\" Samantha mumbles, letting her pack drop to the ground. \"Can you imagine the curse that must've been put on this place,\" Chris returns, looking around with the beam of his flashlight passing over the statues that nearly resembled jackals. The features were too pointed and distorted to really be meant for Anubis' likeness, though, meaning they probably belonged to a sibling god or a parent. A cloud of loose debris rained down on them, no bigger than a few pebbles and some dirt. \"Goddamn it, I'm gonna have to wash my hair again when we get back to base.\" \"You were gonna do that anyway,\" Nick points out, dusting off his shirt with a grimace. \"You're obsessed with having nice hair.\" \"In my defense, Sammi fell in love with me because of my hair.\" \"Not entirely inaccurate,\" Samantha admits with a nod. \"It's just long enough to tangle my fingers in when we have se—\" \"Lalala,\" Nick says loudly, plugging his ears with his fingers. \"I don't want to hear this. You're too much like a sister.\" Chris and Samantha share a look, both of them letting out identical snorts of disbelief. \"Oh, gross! What the hell?\" \"What's wrong with you?\" \"I don't— Something wet just hit the back of my neck.\" Nick rubs his hand along the nape of his neck, but it comes away clean. \"Are you sure you're not hallucinating? Maybe you hit your head harder than we thought.\" But then something wet collided with her shoulder and slid right off. \"What the hell?\" \"You see? It feels weird.\" Another drop of it lands on his arm, glowing silver in the beam of his flashlight as it slides off to the floor. The three of them glance up at the ceiling, noticing the stalactites that had the same silver substance dripping from them like normal ones dripped water. Some of it lands in the palm of Nick's hand, cupped there and rippling as it refused to absorb. \"Is that mercury,\" Chris asks, looking stumped. \"Looks like it.\" \"But what's it doing dripping from the ceiling? That doesn't seem like a normal thing to find in caves.\" \"It's not,\" Jenny assures, coming over to take a look. \"Ancient Egyptians believed it weakened evil spirits.\" \"Pretty sure it'd weaken anyone.\" \"Yeah,\" Nick nods,\" drive you crazy and then kill you off.\" \"Mad as a hatter,\" Samantha adds. \"Which explains why so many rulers back then went bonkers. You know, aside from all the incest.\" Chris arches a brow and she purses her lips in response. \"I know, not the time to discuss obscure subjects.\" Jenny clicks her tape recorder back on, focusing her light on the small lines carved into the floor that guided the mercury to holes the size of a penny. \"There is mercury dripping from the ceiling into holes in the ground,\" she says into the speaker as she walks. \"I believe that it forms some sort of canal system that leads to….\" Samantha looks up when the blonde trails off, squinting to make out what had caught her interest. As far as she could tell, it was just more darkness that blended in with everything else. Seems to be a common theme with these people . \"Get the lights!\" \"Aw man, they're all the way back there.\" She sends Samantha a sharp look and the other woman holds up her hands in surrender. \"Fine, but I blame you if the mercury exposure sends me to the nut house.\" The lights turned out to be what was in the bags Chris and Nick had brought down with them, giant things that flooded the entire antechamber with a bright yellow glow. \"That's good enough, let's go.\" Samantha grumbles under her breath, boots scuffing against the stone as she and the others move back to where they'd been standing moments ago. With the big lights trained on the spot, she was able to see that part of the wall had caved in at some point, revealing a set of steps and a larger chamber on the other side. \"Y'all think this'll count as our calisthenics for the day?\" \"I'm pretty sure Greenway will consider all this stretching,\" Chris remarks sourly as they follow Jenny into the hole. \"Holy hell. You guys seein' this?\" Samantha was already staring, taking in the six statues of Set that were standing guard around a pool of mercury, covered in years of dust and cobwebs. A thick cable ran in a circle outside of the statues, wrapped three times around the hefty columns that poked out of the ground, and three thicker cables that were holding something beneath the glittering surface of the mercury. \"My great-grandparents would've had a field day down here.\" Nick steps up next to Chris, aiming his flashlight at the decimated bones piled near one of the columns, gold jewelry flashing temptingly. The three nod in unison when they look at each other, smiles replacing the gobsmacked expressions they'd been sporting. Looks like they won't be going home empty-handed after all. Jenny turns on her heel sharply, the focus of her stare making Samantha jump guiltily. \"Get everything out of the bags,\" she commands. \"Bring it in here and we'll get to work.\" The soldiers react to the orders without thinking, an action that had been drilled into their heads since they were kids in basic training. \"Blake, stay here and help me document some of this.\" She brings a digital camera out of her satchel and hands it over to Samantha, nodding towards the statues. \"You got it.\" She powers the camera up and waits for the screen to clear before beginning to play photographer, snapping picture after picture of the statues and even the bones, the flash only highlighting the silvery strands of spiderwebs that dulled the bones' sheen. \"How old do you think this place is?\" \"At least five thousand years. Careful with that, you idiot! That video recorder costs more than you make in a week.\" Samantha glances over her shoulder and finds Chris fumbling with a small camcorder, scowling down at it. \"Then you're spending way too much money on your tech,\" he complains. \"I can go down to Walmart and pick up a camera just like this one and spend no more than twenty bucks.\" Jenny makes a noise of disgust, shaking her head. \"Americans.\" \"I'm just sayin', you don't have to spend a crap ton of money just to have good stuff.\" \"Do you think you can point the camera at me and not screw it all up or should I have someone else do it?\" He frowns but holds the camera up all the same, grumbling under his breath as Jenny begins to walk down the steps carved into the rock. Nick and Samantha follow behind them, Nick carrying the camera stand easily. \"Work while she's distracted,\" he whispers, keeping his voice too low for anyone else to hear. \"We'll get some of that gold and you can take it to our fence in Baghdad.\" Samantha gives a curt nod, shooting a glance over at Jenny before easing her way towards one of the jewel-clad skeletons. \"Pleated skirts, scarab signet rings,\" Jenny was saying,\" means this man was a High Priest of Amun from the temple in Thebes. There is a ritual burial chain that surrounds the well…\" She takes the camcorder from Chris and begins to wander off, never noticing as the others set to work removing jewelry. Samantha was careful not to disturb the bones too much, gently tugging on a golden cuff until it popped off in her hand so she could store it in her bag. \"Nick!\" Samantha freezes and looks up, making sure Jenny's attention wasn't focused on her before beginning to work on a necklace. \"Hands to yourself!\" \"Lima 2-6, come in,\" came Greenway's voice over the walkie, cracking with static. \"Copy, sir,\" Chris answers. \"Get out now. We got reports of bogeys inbound. We gotta take off before we all become a ghost story for tourists to laugh at.\" \"Tell Greenway we have to notify the DTRA,\" Jenny says from where she's crouching in front of the scaled chain. \"I'm gonna need some specialists from Cairo to confirm my theory on what this place is.\" \"Are you insane,\" Chris demands. \"What, is the mercury finally getting to you or is it the godawful heat?\" Samantha straightens up with her satchel bulging, training her gaze on Nick as he looked at the counter weight hanging above their heads. She didn't have to be a mind-reader to know what he was thinking. Whatever's in that pool will be worth a fortune to the right buyer, so why not bring it up? Her stomach gave a nasty lurch at the thought, neck itching as Nick unholstered his pistol. \"No,\" she shouts, grabbing for his wrist a second too late. The bullet ripped through the metal chain like it was paper, a loud groan starting up as the columns turn and the chains suspended in the air begin to rise. The mysterious object turns out to be a massive sarcophagus, gold and etched into the likeness of some kind of horrific demon wearing a halo of spikes. \"What the fuck did you just do?\" \"I got it out,\" he says defensively. She lets out a hoarse scream as camel spiders the size of her hand begin to creep out of the rock walls, an entire swarm that seemed to have no qualms about crawling over the humans in the chamber. Samantha uses the camera as a bat, swinging it around by its strap to knock the creepy-crawlies off her in a near panic. \"Oh, Jesus, get them off! Get them off!\" Angry soldiers she could handle, gunfire was tolerable, but fucking spiders treating her like their personal scratch post? Fucking nope times infinity, this shit wasn't happening! As if the spiders weren't bad enough, bullets began ricocheting through the room, Nick dragging her to the ground as Chris shoots at the arachnids wildly. \"Vail, cease fire! Cease fire! You're gonna kills us all!\" Chris was screaming as loudly as Samantha, looking terrified as he fired his rifle over and over. \"They're just camel spiders, for God's sake! Stop it!\" He only stops when he runs out of ammo, the rifle shaking in his hand as he turns to yell at the others. \"Can we go now?! I've been shot at, I've nearly fallen in a giant hole of murder liquid, and I just got bit by a damn spider! I wanna get out of here before something else goes all to hell!\" But Nick wasn't paying any attention to his partner, his gaze was unfocused and cloudy, like his mind was far away from here. Samantha waves her hand in front of his face, Jenny saying his name a couple of times with no response. \"Let me handle this,\" the brunette says, planting her feet firmly on the ground and drawing her fist back. Jenny grabs her before she could swing, Nick coming back to himself directly afterwards. \"You okay?\" \"I'm fine,\" he says with a nod, then furrows his brows as he looks at her fist. \"Were you gonna punch me?\" \"I still might before today's over with.\"[Chapter 3] The plane ride started off nicely, Samantha and Chris sitting as far from Nick as they could get without sitting on the wings. She looks over at her boyfriend, noting how red his bite mark was on the back of his neck. \"You okay over there,\" she asks, nudging him with her arm. \"I'll be fine,\" he mumbles, rubbing the bite with a wince. \"Why don't you get some rest? I think you've earned it after all the shit we've gone through today.\" He looked ready to protest, but must've decided against it as he laid down with his head in her lap. She runs her fingers through his hair, smiling a little as he relaxes further and further until he was fast asleep. \"You guys alright,\" Nick calls from the left. She waves to show they're fine before settling back in the hard seat and popping in her earbuds. She's found the best way to pass a flight was with some music to drown out the occasional misogynistic comment that spewed out of Nick's mouth. He was the classic white guy that thought he had to be the protector, though it mainly came across as douche-y. Take the time just to listen, M. Shadows sang, muffling all other sounds, when the voices screaming are much too loud. Take a look in the distance, try and see it all. Chances are that you might find that we share a common discomfort now . She smiles, remembering the way Chris had sang this very song as they walked into their first apartment. It had made Samantha laugh back then, considering they were surrounded by a sea of boxes that their parents had sent over. It seemed like forever ago that they met, a hot summer day in Lawton, Oklahoma when they were still kids that had a rebellious streak and no real idea of what life had in store for them. Samantha met Chris Vail during their basic training, both eighteen and both known troublemakers. They followed instructions to a tee on work assignments and the like, but it was their free time that got them in trouble more often than naught. For example, Staff Sergeant Ezell didn't take kindly to finding his boots filled with shaving cream and would've had them doing push-ups until their arms fell off if he had any actual proof it was them beyond the giggles they couldn't quite contain. It really didn't help matters that they were assigned as battle buddies, stuck together whenever moving around the base was required. Fort Sill wasn't as large as some of the others, but it was one of Samantha's favorite places since it boasted a forest they could walk through on days off (or go boulder-hopping if the urge arises). It became a well-known truth that if one did something, the other was probably involved in some way or another. The pair grew close, decided to take a somewhat similar path in the army (they didn't realize they'd actually be teamed up as a balance of sorts to an adrenaline junky named Nick Morton three years later). By their fourth year, Chris decided to head to Dallas for a long weekend to meet the nice woman that sent boxes of cookies every Saturday like clockwork. The Blake family gave him a warm welcome and the Hendersons did the same when they arrived for the Fourth of July barbeque that usually ended with no less than three trees on fire, one drunken accident, and minor burns from Charles trying to feel younger than he actually was (and Uncle Tuck comforting him when the attempt backfires). It was three hours after her cousin was carted off to the ER that Chris and Samantha found themselves alone in the backyard, the bon fire little more than a few flames licking at the logs, marshmallows forgotten. He was dressed in a simple tee and jeans, brown hair tousled after he got conned into playing tag by the littler kids. Samantha, at least, looked slightly more put together with her black and green skirt and her favorite tee showing old 80's horror icons in the Mystery Machine. \"That was some party,\" he commented after a while, cheeks flushed from laughter and the humidity. \"I don't think I've ever seen a man in his nineties shoot a pistol that well before.\" \"Uncle Tucker's great,\" she nodded with a laugh. \"He used to read me all these myths about ancient Egypt when I was a kid. He and Charles live in Cairo since they have jobs at the museum there, they got married last year.\" That had been a proud day for everyone involved considering the men had been together since they were fourteen, sneaking kisses and studying old artifacts found during the digging season. \"Man, all my uncle does is take out his teeth at Christmas dinner.\" She laughed even harder at that, Chris wrapping an arm loosely around her when she leaned against his shoulder. \"It traumatized me when I was kid.\" \"I'm sorry, it's just…\" She trailed off for a moment, still laughing. \"…That's nowhere near as bad as my great-grandpa forgetting his pants one year.\" Chris shook his head with a smile, looking down at her. He was handsome and kind compared to some of the soldiers she's met, even-tempered for the most part, though the bump on the bridge of his nose suggested at least one bad fight in his past that led to a broken nose that didn't heal right. \"What? Do I have something on my face?\" \"No, it's nothing.\" She could feel a blush heating up her cheeks when she realized she was staring, gaze seeking out her worn sneakers. Suddenly the metal studs on them was far more interesting than the man beside her. When she chanced a glance back up, it's his turn to be caught staring. \"What?\" \"You, uh, you look….\" He struggled for a moment, like he was waging the argument of all arguments in his head before letting out a heavy sigh. \"Fuck it.\" She was just about to ask him what was going on when his lips dropped to hers, warm and tasting of s'mores. The hand at her back traveled slowly up into her hair and the other cupped her cheek, hers following the same pattern up his toned chest and to his shoulders as the kiss deepened. She wanted to stay like that forever, breathing be damned because she didn't need to as long as he was pressed tightly against her. \"Shit, maybe Alex had a point.\" The pair jumped apart like they were on springs, Chris tumbling off the bench as Samantha's grandma came into view. Even at ninety-three years old, Clem was just as spry as she used to be, and her snow white hair was done up in a style that was all the rage back in the forties. \"I just thought you could use a jacket since it's getting cold out here, but I see Chris is warming you up just fine.\" \"It's not what you think,\" Chris said, panic clear in his eyes as he looked up at her. \"I'm old, not blind, dear.\" She set the jean jacket beside Samantha on the bench and patted her shoulder with a suggestive wink. \"Make me proud, baby girl.\" \"Yeah, your family's way cooler than mine is.\" Just five days after that, they'd had their first date and her family didn't even threaten to shoot off his toes if he broke her heart. She was pretty sure that was because she'd threatened them that she'd burn all the junk food in the neighborhood if they so much as glared at Chris. It's not until she feels Chris sitting up that she bothers to open her eyes again, watching with a vague fascination as he stumbles over to the sarcophagus. The hieroglyphics on the front were clean and clear now, Samantha able to make out a couple that formed a familiar phrase from the family histories. Hom Dai , they said, practically bolded and underlined to the trained eye. The worst of all Egyptian curses . \"Corporal,\" Greenway asks, annoyance in his tone,\" what in the name of all that's holy do you think you're doing?\" Her eyes flick to the army issued knife Chris was using to cut through one of the ratchet straps, her tired brain not really catching up at first. He's gonna make that thing slide all around the plane , she thinks absently. It'll be like Dracula's coffin in that old Leslie Nielsen flick . \"Baby,\" Samantha tries, fumbling with her seatbelt. \"You need to come sit down.\" When she finally gets it undone, she starts for him only to freeze up halfway through the motion. Greenway had had the same idea, but it had ended with Chris plunging the steel into his chest just as smoothly as a hot knife through butter. \"Chris, what the fuck?\" Chris stabs the Colonel again, the older man going down with a wet gurgling noise that Samantha knew meant a punctured lung. \"Vail,\" Nick screams, jumping up out of his seat as Chris finally turned away from the sarcophagus. Samantha swallows hard when she catches sight of his face, dark lines following the small veins and one eye completely rolled up in his head. The other soldiers and Jenny get to their feet when they notice what had happened, Nick attempting to hold them off as they drew their pistols. \"Chris, you gotta put the knife down!\" He swings and barely grazes her stomach, drawing blood that began soaking into her jeans and top. \"Chris, it's me! It's your Sammi!\" But it was like he was in a trance, features slack as though he were still lost in a deep sleep. \"Vail, stop it! Drop the knif— Jesus!\" He'd swung again and would've cut Samantha wide open if she hadn't leaped back. Nick caught her when her knees buckled and quickly put her behind him. He pushed her just hard enough that she collided with one of the soldiers, Nick taking advantage and stealing the pistol. \"Put down your weapon! Put it down!\" \"Are you an idiot,\" Jenny yells, stepping between the soldiers and Nick. \"This is a pressurized aircraft and one small hole could deprive us all of oxygen!\" With wide eyes, Samantha grabs the front of Nick's shirt and yanks him out of the way of Chris' knife just in time. \"Vail, put it down. Please, just put it down and we'll talk this through!\" \"He can't hear,\" Samantha tells them, shaking her head. \"It's not getting through to him, he's not in there anymore.\" The group backed up further and further as Chris got closer with the knife, the blade about to sink into Jenny's stomach when a loud bang had Samantha's ears ringing. She wasn't sure what had happened at first, but then she saw a dark stain blooming across the olive drab of Chris' shirt. A second shot brought him down, the wheezing breaths ceasing along with the movement of his chest. \"Oh God…\" With his hands shaking beyond control, the trigger's squeezed and a third bullet lodges itself into Chris' abdomen. The body jerks automatically and Samantha's air leaves her lungs in the same moment. He was gone, the man she'd thought she'd spend the rest of her life with was nothing more than a lifeless corpse just three feet away. She drops to the ground as the plane gives a sudden jerk to the right. \"No, no, not yet.\" She crawls forward, cradling him against her with an arm wrapped securely around his middle. \"We're supposed to go gnome shopping, remember?\" Her throat was tight as tears gathered in her eyes, blurring Chris' face as she bent over him. \"I would've even let you have those stupid flamingoes. Please, God, just give him back.\" \"Watch out!\" Nick's shout made her look up seconds before a murder of crows flew inside, smashing against walls and seating. Feathers rained down in bloody handfuls, gathering in her hair and on Chris' body until suddenly they were all floating up towards the roof the carrier. Her back hits it hard before her body actually began to float off, Chris wrenched out of her hold when she's tossed to the side. She lets out a scream when a seatbelt slaps at her fractured ankle, the metal only adding to her aches and pains. Looking back, it was no wonder that Samantha was currently in a plane that was doing a steep nosedive towards England. In fact, most would claim it as inevitable if they bothered to dig into her family history. 'Yes, Miss Blake was insane, but it seemed to be genetic.' And they could quote her on that if they wanted. None of that changed the fact that wind was screaming in her ears—or was that still her? She wasn't sure anymore—and her body was colliding hard with the ceiling of the plane, metal ridges snapping fragile bone and drawing blood to the surface. Her thoughts jolted around in her head much like her body was doing, bouncing from one thing to the next as pain spread through her like fire in dry scrub brush. Through the tangled mess of her hair, she could make out Nick and Jenny, the pair struggling to grab one of the parachutes being thrown around with them. I feel like a fucking ragdoll . And it was all because of a lack of water that this mess was happening, not to mention a spider infestation and the cursed remains of a world-class bitch secured in the sarcophagus just a few feet away from where Samantha was currently bumping around. So yeah, she felt she had the right to be a little bit testy and, yeah, she really should've seen this one coming. She lets out a grunt as her back slams into one of the walls, grabbing a ratchet strap before she could leave the floor again. It held her for a moment, the relief a palpable thing that she latched onto just as tightly, but then she heard it, the noise that defined everything left in her little bubble of safety. Ripping nylon and the screeching of metal on metal, then the strap was coming up and so was she and so was the goddamn sarcophagus. And just once she wished she could tell Nick to go fuck himself because this was so not how she wanted to die. And yet there was that voice again, the family historian from years down the road—probably the cousin that was always so ready to spout out information. Blond hair, blue eyes, though the smooth cocoa of his skin put his Egyptian heritage on display for all to marvel at. Dottie's grandbaby , she recalls vaguely, witty and studious just like Uncle Tuck . 'Here lies the remains of my dear cousin, a sweet girl if a little looney. I'd like to say we got all of her, but there may have been a finger or two left back in England when they scraped her up like roadkill.' Or maybe they wouldn't be able to identify her, and her parents would be left wondering what happened to their only kid. That thought more than anything had spite burning in her belly, the wildfire pain receding as adrenaline flooded her system and her heart beat faster in her chest to compensate. Everything seemed to slow down and become clear for the first time since Chris pulled out his knife and set to work on that damn ratchet strap, the wind turning to a dull roar as she snarled down at the golden façade of the sarcophagus. \"I ain't leavin' yet,\" she swears in her downhome Texan drawl. \"I ain't leavin' till I'm good and ready!\" For a moment, she thought she'd be okay, that she'd be able to hold on until the plane went down. The hope was back, the adrenaline leaving a foul taste in her mouth, but she didn't mind it as long as she was still here. But then the strap broke free and she found herself viewing the next two seconds in a series of snap shots. Jenny's parachute exploding open, the white fabric catching the breeze and carrying her safely out. The metal of the ratchet strap seeming to wink as it went out next, flipping ass over teakettle. Nick's gaze landing on her as gravity began to work again.The bright sunlight as she tumbled out of the plane next.The greens and browns of a field as she collided like some kind of asteroid meant to do maximum damage. The wildfire catching again and tearing through her before blessed darkness swept her away. And then Samantha Blake was waking up.[Chapter 4] Sammi gets to her feet gingerly, wincing whenever she put pressure on her foot. Still, a broken ankle was something she'd take in stride if it meant she survived a plane crash. Aching all over, she presses a hand to the right side of her face and makes a noise low in her throat when she feels the bones shifting. \"That's not good,\" she mumbles as she feels her eye bulging in the socket. She turns, trying to find a heading and instead finding a body not even half a foot away. It was a woman, she realized, dark hair matted with blood to a face with the upper right side completely caved in, left arm lying a few feet away in a mud puddle. The next thing she realized was the dead woman was her . \"Okay, well, that's worse.\" \"You look like shit, babe.\" Samantha spins around and launches herself forward into the man's arms, pulling him into a tight hug as she swallowed a sob. \"Whoa, I've only been dead two seconds.\" He wraps his arms around her waist all the same, cheek pressed against the top of her head. \"Two seconds too long, Chris. How are we still here? I thought we were supposed to crossover or go to the light or somethin'.\" \"Ya got me. As far as I'm concerned, my preacher lied his ass off about the afterlife.\" They pull apart and look around them at the field they'd landed in. \"My body's about a mile back that way.\" He points to the east, a forest starting up around there with skeletal trees marking the new season. It had been winter for about a month now, though they hadn't felt any change in Iraq. She couldn't feel the change now either as the crisp wind blew around her, not even moving the stands of her hair. \"Hey, do you hear that?\" \"What?\" \"That whispering sound.\" She strains to pick it up over the howling wind but can't quite make anything out. \"It's a woman calling for help. Come on!\" He grasps her wrist in his hand and gives a hard tug, forcing her to follow after him towards the dense woods. Samantha casts one last look at her body over her shoulder before facing front again and focusing on the trees dead ahead. \"Chris, I don't hear anything.\" \"It's clear as day!\" They get about halfway there before a strange tugging sensation began in the center of her chest, the world melting away and reappearing a moment later, a blur of colors like a picture behind broken glass. When the pieces were glued back together, she found herself in front of a dilapidated pier. \"That was weird.\" \"So fucking weird,\" Chris agrees, staring around in wide-eyed shock. \"Was that- Do we have ghost powers now?\" \"Looks like it.\" \"It's night now, too.\" She really wished he was wrong, but the late afternoon sunlight had vanished and only the cold glow of the moon lit their surroundings, glinting off parts of the plane and reflecting in the water. Samantha moves over to one of the small fires, sticking her hand through the flames and unable to feel the warmth. \"Hey, babe, check this out.\" She waits until Chris is looking at her to do it again, laughing a little. \"I'm a Firebender.\" \"That's awesome and slightly unnerving.\" \"Right? I can't wait to show Nick.\" Chris snorts, gazing around the wreckage and only paying the vaguest amount of attention to the two cops making their way through the wreckage. They were documenting what they found and clearly couldn't see the ghosts, so Sammi decided to focus on trying to touch things without her hand going through it. \"Do you think Nick's still alive?\" \"Maybe.\" \"I hope he is because I'm gonna haunt his ass so hard.\" \"We should totally move all the furniture in his tent an inch to the right and watch him bump into things.\" \"And we could cut holes in all of his socks.\" \"I hear the voice again.\" Samantha looks at him over her shoulder, watching as he wanders closer to the glint of gold and one of the cops beneath the wooden planks of the pier. \"She sounds like she's hurt.\" \"I can't hear shit.\" She turns fully and follows after him towards the inner layer of the sarcophagus that had been tipped upside down during the crash, a trail of bandages leading up to it. Every instinct was screaming for her to grab Chris and magic them the fuck out of dodge, but curiosity was a real bitch and she was determined to at least kick the desecrated corpse. She might be just the tiniest bit bitter about the whole thing. The cop pushes the sarcophagus to the side and kneels next to the corpse, allowing Samantha to take in the molding bandages and leathery bits of skin clinging to petrified ligament and fragile bones. It was wrong, though, she's seen mummies up close before and none of them were this…. Juicy. Oh, son of a bitch! The mummy's torso snaps up and sideways, latching onto the poor rent-a-cop and pinning him to the muddy ground, letting out a shriek that made Samantha cover her ear on instinct. Chris just stood a few feet away, swaying in time with the breeze with a glazed stare; he looked like he had on the plane, unaware of his surroundings even as something horrific is happening. \"Fucking white people and raising the dead,\" she curses, shaking her head. And granted, her dad was white, but her instincts favored the Egyptian heritage passed down to her through her mother. Samantha closes the last few feet between her and the mummy, trying to grab at the remains, but her hand simply passed right through. It was like something out of a nightmare, forced to watch as bits of skin and a swirling lifeforce are sucked from the man and absorbed by the corpse. Looks like Uncle Larry wasn't lying all those years ago when he told us that scary story about Hamunaptra . The other cop follows the noise, tripping over his feet when he discovers the remains of his partner and whacking his head on a fallen piece of timber. He barely has time to get to his knees before the bitch is sucking the life out of him as well, looking slightly less disgusting when she stumbles to her feet. Because now it's pretty clear that the creature's a woman as her bones snap back into place and a fringe of lashes cover the eyeless sockets. The woman says something, a single word in ancient Egyptian—wow, Sammi's really regretting not taking her great-grandma up on that offer to learn the language now—and then the cops were reanimating, twitching violently before rising to their feet. They follow her as she crawls towards the water like some kind of demented crab, struggling until she was standing and stooped like an old woman with back problems. \"Hey, bitch,\" Samantha yells, stomping over to her with all traces of horror vanished. \"You either take your little curse off my boyfriend or I find a way to stomp your ass into the dirt.\" The creature's head tilts to the right, the motion fast and sharp like a predator assessing prey. Samantha doesn't back down, doesn't even flinch, just glares until she feels like she's vibrating with pure rage. \" He is mine to control ,\" the creature says without ever opening her mouth. The voice in Sammi's head is strong, decidedly feminine, and goes straight up the list of annoying sounds to number one. \" He will bring me my king .\" \"King? Hate to break it to you, but the only King around here is old as dirt.\" \" The one who freed me. He will rule at my side as we take over this broken world .\" \"Wouldn't you rather have someone with more than two braincells to rub together? I gotta tell you, Nick isn't really good for anything except causing trouble and screwing up simple plans.\" The creature lets out a low hiss, saying something in Egyptian that had Chris jerking behind them, disappearing a moment later. \"Where the fuck did he just go?\" \" To retrieve my king .\" \"Nick,\" Samantha gasps,\" closing her eyes and focusing on wanting to find him,\" Nick, Nick, Nick! I want to see—\" The world around her shifts and then she's stumbling into an alley filled with screeching mice and a man trying to fight them off. \"Nick!\" She surges forward, putting all of her strength into grabbing the front of his shirt and transporting him to the sidewalk in front of a bar. \"Sammi,\" he asks, nearly tripping as he stumbles backwards. \"What level of stupid do you have to be to wander into a dark alley when a reanimated talking corpse is after your ass? I mean, honestly, did your last remaining braincell die in that plane crash?\" \"You're alive!\" \"If I was alive I'd be able to do this.\" She attempts to slap him as hard as she can, letting out a surprised sound when she actually makes contact with his cheek. \"Oh, damn.\" \"Ow! What the hell?\" She does it again, letting out a delighted laugh when his head rocks to the side from the force behind the blow. \"Lieutenant Blake,\" Jenny asks, coming to stand outside. \"This isn't possible, I saw your body in the morgue.\" Going for the trifecta, Sammi slaps the archeologist too, but her hand goes straight through without even a red mark left behind. She frowns down at her hand, taking in the fact that it was a dark gray instead of the light brown it had been when she was still alive. \"Would one of you tell me what the fuck is going on here?\" Nick's still rubbing at the red mark Sammi had left on his cheek, looking too offended for words that Jenny had escaped unscathed. \"I mean, Vail just popped up in the bathroom and gave me this big you're cursed speech and then I had a bunch of rats attacking me, and then my dead best friend is popping up like some kind of anti-hero.\" \"You saw Chris,\" Samantha demands, stepping closer to Nick. \"How'd he look?\" \"Well, I'll be honest with you, Sammi, he looked pretty dead.\" \"Were his eyes kind of glazed over? Maybe swaying a little bit like he'd just been brainwashed by Imhotep Jr.?\" \"Uh… No? Who's Imhotep?\" \"That's not the point here, Nick!\" She lets out a short breath before turning to face the blonde, hand on her hip. \"This isn't possible,\" Jenny says, gaze focused on the ruined half of Samantha's face. \"This must be a hallucination from all of that mercury down in the tomb. You can't actually be here.\" \"A lot of impossible things have happened today, sweetie, try to keep up. I just watched a five thousand year old mummy snap crackle and pop so much that I thought I was stuck in a Rice Krispies commercial, so how about you tell me what the fuck is goin' on and what we can expect from this one.\" \"This one?\" \"Yeah, the cheesy knock-off of ol' toilet paper breath.\" \"Ahmanet?\" \"Sounds good, we'll go with that.\" \"Wait, there was writing on that coffin we found her in,\" Nick adds, looking about ready to lock himself in the loony bin. \"Sarcophagus,\" Jenny corrects. He pauses a moment and looks to Samantha with raised brows, the ghost rolling her eyes in response. Honestly, how'd he get so good at treasure hunting if he didn't even know what rich Egyptians were buried in ? \"The box of shame and bad decisions that you just had to have,\" she informs him. \"And that writing said something about the Hom Dai, which usually translates to leave this bitch alone or she'll cause an apocalypse .\" \"I've seen your file, Blake, you failed history. How the hell do you know about things like that? And while we're on the subject, how do you know about Imhotep? He was basically erased from all but the most obscure histories.\" \"It's a long story and doesn't really matter right now.\" \"You know what? This isn't actually happening because you're dead.\" Jenny turns her back on Samantha, facing Nick again just as his eyes began to clear up. \"The pair of us suffered a traumatic event on top of toxic exposure, so I think we should head to London to see a specialist that I know.\" \"That's great, but I'd rather see the five thousand year old prune,\" Nick states. \"Come on, I know where she's hiding out.\" Jenny's mouth opens and closes a couple of times, looking like a fish out of water as she watches Nick's retreating back. \"What the hell just happened?\" \"Get your asses in gear! It's a long drive to Waverley Abbey!\"[Chapter 5] Waverley Abbey looks as creepy as most churches do in the dark, cordoned off in police tape as the search of the wreckage continues. Samantha weaves her way through the overgrown weeds towards the front doors, wrapping her remaining arm tightly around Chris' waist. \"This day has been so fucked up,\" she mutters, relaxing a little when she feels his hand cradling the back of her head. \"Tell me about it,\" Chris grunts in return. \"It was bad enough when I felt forced to help Nick steal stuff that could have us court marshalled, but doing the bidding of Leatherface? Not my ideal job.\" \"I don't even have a job. I've just been attempting to slap people and it only works when I do it to Nick.\" \"Makes sense, it's his fault we died in a plane crash.\" \"True.\" It's the sound of crunching gravel that made them turn, spotting Nick was he shuffles their way. His eyes were glazed much like Chris' had been a few hours ago, mumbling something under his breath as he passed the ghosts and entered the church. The inside was just as imposing as its exterior, stained glass and dark stone soaking up the moonlight so that only a faint trickle of it entered through the doors. \"Yo, Nick!\" He blinks a couple of times, looking surprised when he sees Samantha. \"How'd I get in here,\" he asks, more unnerved than Sammi's ever seen him before. \"I was just…. And I saw—\" \"Yeah, it's like one big acid trip.\" \"Oh my God, I have to fight a mummy, don't I?\" \"You know, my great-grandparents kicked a mummy's ass on two different occasions.\" \"Yeah? How'd that work out for their relationship?\" \"Made 'em closer than ever. You might have even heard of them.\" She pauses with a smile, watching as Nick and Chris both raised their brows. \"Rick and Evelyn O'Connell.\" There's a moment of quiet where the men seemed to process that, then Nick was shaking his head. \"Nope, doesn't ring a bell.\" \"I should've waited for Jenny. She probably would've known who they were.\" \"Vail, please go back to being the sane one out of the three of us. Sammi's not good at it.\" \"Says the guy that cursed us,\" Chris grumbles. There's a faint skittering sound off to the left that has Nick spinning around on his heel, trying to follow it with no real luck. Either mummies that suffer the Hom Dai are born assholes or they just get salty about the whole buried alive thing at one point during the five thousand years they were underground. \"Nick, just get out of here,\" Samantha advises. \"The best thing you can do is run while you still have your soul.\" He takes a couple stumbling steps backwards, almost within reach of the doors, and then Ahmanet is tackling him to the ground with superhuman speed. Now that she's munched on a few cops, she's looking a little more humanoid than she was earlier. \"Damn, that bitch is faster than Tom Brady.\" \"Yeah, and she probably cheats as much as he does, too.\" Samantha scowls and punches at his arm, protective of her Patriots. \"At least my guy has a normal forehead.\" \"You're just jealous— Oh, the zombies are still up and kicking.\" The four cops each had one of Nick's limbs and carried him through to a table, dropping him onto it with little care of his well-being. Samantha couldn't blame them either, she'd probably drop him on things if she was able to. \"So, do you think we should be useful and help Ahmanet out?\" \"Nah, I'm not doin' anything to help her.\" Sammi pats her boyfriend's cheek and give him an unamused smile. \"I tend to feel hostile towards ancient mummies that brainwash the guy I love.\" \"Yeah, I get that.\" Proving the old saying about talking about devils right, Ahmanet leapt out of the darkness and landed on the table with her feet on either side of Nick's hips, turning his face this way and that and checking his teeth. It reminded Samantha of all the physicals she's had when the doctor was a little too handsy, invasive and uncomfortable as sin. She shoves Nick's shirt upwards, running blackened nails—more like claws the longer Samantha watches—down his flat stomach to his belt. \"Okay, that is basically the definition of Bad Touch.\" Samantha strides forward and pushes hard against Ahmanet, managing to get her attention away from Nick for a moment. \"Why don't you pick on somebody your own size?\" Ahmanet's head tilts to the side as she studies the other woman, one claw tapping over Nick's heart in a considering manner. \" You are Egyptian ?\" Ahmanet's voice was smooth and soft in Samantha's mind, one of those voices that she would normally love to listen to had it not belonged to a rejected cast member from The Walking Dead. \"Why do you care?\" \" I will need a servant when I rule, you will do nicely .\" \"I'll poison your tea is what I'll do. Now how about you get off my friend before he gets anymore screwed up? I mean, the guy's already a therapist's wet dream.\" \"Hey,\" Nick objects, raising his head off the table. \"I am not!\" \"Oh please, you'd give Will Graham a run for his money.\" While Nick and Samantha argued, Ahmanet raised a hand and struck a statue of an angel, bits of porcelain raining down over Nick's head as she pulled out a curved dagger. She brings the knife down without warning, Samantha covering her mouth with a muted shout, staring in shock as the tip of the blade pauses less than an inch over her friend's chest. \"A little help would be nice.\" \"I can't move yet.\" Ultimately, it's the sound of the church door opening that helps with the shock, everyone looking over at the blonde woman that was standing frozen a few feet away. Jenny seemed just as shocked as Nick and Samantha, looking on with wide eyes and a slack mouth. Ahmanet lets out a low growl, stabbing the knife down into the table a couple inches from Nick's ear. \"Run!\" Jenny didn't have to be told twice, sprinting out of the church without a word. \"Sammi, go!\" \"In case you forgot, Nick, I'm already dead. I'd like to see the bitch top that.\" Samantha's bowled right over when the mummy jumps off the table, her world seeming to shatter again as the creature goes right through her in pursuit of the blonde. For a moment, everything is just a thick blackness that surrounds her like fog but then color starts filtering back in, like dust motes swirling in sunlight until they slowly formed into a new sight. She rubs at her eyes until the blurriness goes away, staring around at the shelves of books she's surrounded by. \"What the actual fuck,\" she mumbles, making her way to the end of the aisle. There's an archway to the right, so she takes it and finds herself in an open room. Nick and another man are standing in the center of it, surrounded by old medical equipment behind glass cases and a gurney at the far end near a heavy metal door. \"Nick, what's goin' on?\" \"Pretty much what I'm wondering,\" he replies, looking relieved to see her. \"Did you change clothes after you disappeared?\" She looks down, finding jean shorts and a Freddy Kruger tank top instead of the singed clothes she'd had on when she died. \"Looks like it, yeah.\" She looks to the other man; slightly overweight with dark, graying hair, and half-moon spectacles that reminded her of a middle-aged Dumbledore. \"Who's your friend?\" \"A doctor and a lawyer, apparently.\" \"My name is Henry Jekyll,\" the new man fills in. \"And you must be Miss Blake.\" He moves over to the desk and picks up a file, flipping through it with vague interest before setting it back down and crossing the room as he continued to speak. \"I see that the only interesting thing about you is your unique heritage.\" \"She's unique because she's Egyptian?\" \"No, she's unique because of her family's legacy.\" Nick raises an eyebrow, but Samantha ignores him as she strides across the room. \"What the hell do you know about my family,\" she demands. \"Quite a bit, actually. I did my thesis over one particular artifact that your great-grandparents are responsible for acquiring.\" It took her a moment to sort through all the things Nana Evy had picked up during her frequent trips out of London and the States, finally landing on the one thing that would spark someone's interest enough to write an entire thesis about. \"The golden book.\" \"Indeed.\" \"Are you the dickwad responsible for stealing it? Because that's not cool, dude. You nearly made my mom croak.\" \"I do apologize, but I felt it would be safer in a private collection.\" \"Safer than in a locked vault in the biggest museum in all of Great Britain?\" She gives him a wholly unimpressed look, already making plans to find the book and bury it under a mountain of cement. It was bad enough when someone stole the Book of the Dead —Imhotep was a family horror story worthy of three bowls of popcorn and sixty years of therapy—but the Book of Amun-Ra? Fuck all of that. \"I will admit that stealing it wasn't my finest hour, Lieutenant.\" \"Just be happy my grandma Clem didn't track you down.\" He lets out a huff that might have been a laugh, picking something up off a table before crossing the room again to add other pieces to the metal instrument in his hand. \"Nick, how'd you get here?\" \"I got shot with a tranquilizer dart,\" he says, rubbing at a spot on his chest,\" then I woke up to a pair of goons dragging me in here. You remember that mission we had in Italy? It was kind of like that except I didn't end up modeling for a portrait and you aren't wearing a fruit hat.\" \"I think I'd prefer the fruit hat to being dead.\" \"You're never going to let that one go, are you? You die one time and you just keep complaining about it.\" \"Well, it kind of hurts my feelings, Nick. Not that you'd know what those were since you have the emotional range of a concussed goldfish .\" Jekyll clears his throat loudly and both soldiers snap their heads in his direction. \"What,\" they demand in unison, frustration beginning to bubble over. If she didn't end up in Heaven after all of this bullshit, then she was haunting the ever living fuck out of her old Sunday school teacher. \"Do not snap at me,\" he growls at them, accent changing and voice deepening. It was like a total transformation was happening in seconds, blue veins running along Jekyll's face as his eyes turned a murky green color that reminded Samantha of pond scum. He uses the instrument as a three-pronged needle, injecting a yellow serum into the scarred flesh of his left hand that had the transformation reversing just as quickly. \"I apologize, sometimes I forget my doses when something interesting crops up.\" \"Maybe set a timer on your phone,\" Nick advises. \"That's what Sammi has to do so she remembers her insulin.\" \"Thank you for the suggestion, Mister Morton.\" Jekyll takes a deep breath as he adjusts his leather glove over his hand, hiding away the rough patch of pink scarring. \"I believe I have something the two of you may find interesting. Follow me, please.\" He strides back across the room to the iron door, pressing his bare palm against a scanner for his fingerprints to be taken before the latches slide back and allow him to open then door. The room waiting for them looks more run down than the last, all exposed metal and cement with a rusted grating set in the direct middle. Ahmanet was in a forced crouch there, arms chained so they were straight out behind her and a pair of thick chains leading from the floor to the collar around her throat. \"Welcome, both of you, to Prodigium. Please forgive the state of things, we had very little warning to prepare for our newest guest and only the vaguest information Jennifer could provide while recovering from being choked. \"You guys reached out to my mother when you were first getting started,\" Sammi murmurs, recalling an afternoon when she was small when her mother's side of the family took over the living room and forced all of the kids outside to play. She remembers crouching under the window seal and pretending she was Harry Potter as he hid from the Dursleys, overhearing scraps of conversation about a fairly new corporation in the business of capturing monsters. \"Yes, but Eva and her siblings turned us down rather quickly. Imagine my surprise to find her daughter in my office.\" \"Imagine my surprise to find the Willy Wonka of evil nasties kidnapping my friend. What exactly do you guys do here?\" \"Simple really; we capture evil, study it, and then we dispose of it in whatever the best way to do it is. Ahmanet is the oldest one we've obtained so far.\" \"What are you doing to her,\" Nick asks, looking half-awake. \"Why- what are those tubes?\" Samantha has to squint past the steam coming in through the grating, but then she can make out the clear tubes inserted along the mummy's neck and arms. \"Embalming her with mercury so that we can perform a dissection.\" That had Nick, Jenny, and Samantha all attempting to talk over each other, all of them trying to be louder than the other. \"No, you can't—\" \"But we could learn so much—\" \"You need to put that bitch in the ground—\" \"The decision has already been made,\" he cuts in, gazing at the archeologist with something like disappointment. \"As soon as the mercury has solidified, we are going to dissect her and see what makes her tick in case Miss Blake's family decides to raise yet another mummy from the dead.\" \"In our defense,\" she says, waving her hand a little,\" we only raised a mummy once. It was other people that kept the family tradition of putting mummies down like rabid dogs going, okay? Case in point.\" She gestures over at Nick and Jenny, ignoring their sounds of offense. \"If it were up to me, Ahmanet never would have left Iraq and I'd probably be doing push-ups until I lost feeling in my arms right about now.\" She stares down at the bloody stump of her left arm. \"I'd also have both arms, probably.\" \"Probably?\" \"The Colonel was a very angry man,\" Nick fills in solemnly. \"Now, if we could get back to the problem at hand. I'd love to let you cut Ahmanet open like she's a frog and you're an overeager biology student, but how about you tell us how the hell all of this will affect me?\" \"You're cursed.\" \"Yeah, I got that much from Vail. Why am I cursed?\" \"Because you were the one that pulled her out of the pool,\" Jennifer says, looking as though she was having an epiphany. \"You were the one to help her and now she thinks she's helping you by…. Oh, that's not going to end well for mankind.\" Nick arches a brow and a hint of pink adds color to Jenny's cheeks as she blushes. \"She's chosen you to be the vessel for Set. You will rule at her side as she conquers the earth.\" Samantha frowns and switches her gaze between her friend and Ahmanet before just settling the full force of it on Nick. \"Why the hell would she choose your ugly ass as her King,\" Samantha asks bluntly. \"Rude,\" he snaps. \"I died in a plane crash, so I'm allowed to be rude.\" He looked about ready to argue, but then Ahmanet began to talk, her voice soft and echoing in the chamber. Nick's attention slides to her, blue eyes beginning to cloud over as though he'd taken an Oxy and it was finally kicking into high gear. \"Nick?\" \"Let him go,\" Jekyll orders, watching with avid attention as Nick moves to stand on the very edge of the grating. \"Give him a chance to break free of her hold by himself.\" Nick begins to speak then, his ancient Egyptian coming out halting instead of the smooth slide of Ahmanet's. She's really in his head, she's taking him away . \"Nick, that's not funny.\" \"Nick,\" Jenny calls,\" you need to come back now.\" Samantha doesn't take her eyes off the exchange, unable to follow it as Vail appears on her right. His hand is warm where it grasps her wrist, keeping her from shaking Nick awake. She looks to him, hoping to find concern but only seeing the glazed expression that didn't belong to her boyfriend. This isn't the man she was going to build a collection of gnomes with, this was Ahmanet's slave. \"Chris, stop this.\" \"Have to help Ahmanet,\" he tells her, breath hot against her ear as he leans in close. \"We have to help our queen.\" \"The only thing we have to do is pay taxes and die, and I'm pretty sure we can check both those things off our bucket list.\" She tried to jerk her arm free, but Chris tightened his hold and jerked her further away. \"Nick! Fight her, Nick! She's just a bully!\" \"Don't you dare say that about her!\" He switches his hold to the front of her shirt, shaking her hard enough that she accidentally bites her tongue. With a shout, Samantha kicks Chris away from her, delivering a sharp slap to his cheek that had his head snapping to the side. When he looks up again, his eyes are clear. \"Sammi?\" \"Don't.\" She holds up a hand when he tries to take a step towards her, shaking her head as she tried to fight back tears. It's bad enough that she has to deal with a five thousand year old roll of moldy toilet paper, but she doesn't have a clue how to deal with a brainwashed, abusive boyfriend on top of that. \"I know what you just did isn't your fault, but I need time to process that.\" A loud shriek tears her concentration to pieces, even Vail covering his ears until the noise had died down to a pained whimper. The spell seems to splinter enough for Nick to come back to himself, rubbing over his chest and then scratching at his neck as though he was trying to brush off something irritating. \"Stop it,\" he shouts, jerking towards Jekyll and then back towards the creature. \"You have to stop, you're hurting her! Don't you see how much pain she's in? Don't you—\" He cuts himself off with a choked sob, hands shaking where they gripped the edge of his blue button-up. \"You can't… Vail, please help.\" He looks around for any sign of an ally in the room, eyes wide and pleading in a way that Samantha's never seen before. Nick Morton doesn't beg for anything, he demands and he manipulates until he gets what he wants. \"Sammi?\" \"Maybe we should all take a break,\" she suggests when no one else spoke up. \"Work on some deep breathing and then get back to the brain storming.\" Her gaze lingers on Ahmanet, seeing the anger that burned in her eyes as she struggled against the chains. \"Nick, what do you think?\" \"I think I need a drink.\" Samantha paces back and forth between the aisles of bookcases, tugging at her hair until it came free of the chignon she'd had it in. Chris stayed leaning against the window that allowed them to see into Jekyll's office, his arms crossed over his chest as he watched her move. She felt too full of energy to stay still like he was, her nerves driving her to move and rearrange a few books on one of the tables. \"Babe, why don't we just talk and get it out of your system?\" \"I don't want to talk,\" she mumbles around the thumbnail she was worrying. \"You always want to talk.\" She stops long enough to shoot him an unamused look, Chris holding up his hands in surrender. \"So, what do you want to do?\" She shrugs, moving her hand back to her hair and pulling until her scalp ached. \"We haven't had sex against a bookshelf since college, so we could always try that.\" \"Our lunatic of a best friend is literally the vessel for Satan, which my gran will be ecstatic about since she totally called that, and you want to have sex?\" \"I just figured it'd be a nice distraction while these guys attempt to kill Nick to break the curse.\" Samantha freezes for a moment, staring dead ahead of her before spinning on her heel to look at Chris. \"What? Do I have something on my face?\" \"Those guys are gonna do what?\" He seemed confused until she flung her hand out at the glass, then he made a noise of understanding. \"Yeah, they're gonna cut his throat or somethin' because they think that'll stop Ahmanet. Honestly, she'll just switch her focus to Jenny since she's the smartest choice anyway. Think about it, Jenny's smart and pretty and she knows more about ancient Egypt than Nick could ever hope to learn.\" But Samantha was already pushing past him, stalking through the glass and dropping to the ground in the same instant that Jenny barged in through the door. \"What the fuck, Jekyll?\" \"You're going to kill him,\" Jenny demands, hot on her heels. \"Nick may be the dumbest man on the planet, but that's not enough of a reason to shank him!\" \"Well, he did break the barrier chain and bring Ahmanet back to life so she could slaughter us all violently,\" Jekyll says, voice remaining calm throughout it all. \"And do either of you know why he did that? Because he's just the sort of man needed to bring Set into this world—a thieving, fit, deviously soulless mess of a human being.\" \"Whoa,\" Chris says, appearing at Samantha's elbow,\" you really hit the nail on the head with that one. Do me next. What am I?\" Jekyll barely spares him a glance, left hand twitching at his side as blue lines started to snake their way up his wrist. \"You're a mindless follower, Mister Vail, a sheep in the grand scheme of things.\" \"Ouch.\" \"Don't worry, Nick, this won't hurt a bit. We'll simply allow Set to enter your body and then destroy it to ensure the continuation of mankind.\" \"By stabbing me with that knife thing,\" he asks incredulously. \"On purpose?\" He looks to Samantha with wide eyes and she rolls her shoulders, bringing her fist down only to have it go right through Jekyll's cheek. \"That's real helpful, Sammi, thank you.\" \"If there was any other way to handle this situation, then we'd do it.\" Jekyll's voice shifted, the accent sounding more like it belonged in an episode of Misfits rather than Downton Abbey. \"The Book of the Dead could be of some use in dealing with the Hom Dai aspect of…\" He trails off breathlessly, stumbling over to his desk and forcing the briefcase open with unsteady hands. \"Of this.\" \"The black book was shattered during the last fight with Imhotep,\" Samantha admits, shifting from one foot to the other under the harsh scrutiny of Jenny's gaze. \"Papa made sure it couldn't be pieced back together and my gran buried the pieces all across the globe back in the forties.\" Clem and Alex O'Connell had told that story more as a warning than anything, trying to keep their grandchildren from messing with cursed objects even if it meant nightmares for weeks afterwards. \"Then this is truly the only way to go.\" The metal injector falls from Jekyll's hand when he hunches forward with a pained groan, Nick catching it before it could topple to the ground. \"Give that to me!\" \"Not until you come up with a plan that doesn't end in me being dead,\" Nick states, taking a deliberate step away. \"How does that sound?\" \"It sounds,\" Jekyll 2.0 says as he straightens up into a relaxed slouch,\" like I've got a new best friend to play with for a while. Dear me, aren't you an evil little thing?\" Nick tosses the injector onto the desk and jumps back at the sudden change, finally realizing that the serum was the only thing keeping Henry Jekyll from falling to pieces. \"On second thought, I'll just leave and get out of your hair.\" But Jekyll was advancing around the desk already, too cocky and self-assured to be the real doctor as he rolls his head on his shoulders. \"Time to go,\" Chris decides, grabbing the back of Sammi's top and dragging her through one of the walls. They end up in some sort of storage room, shelves lining the walls filled with specimen jars and old knickknacks. \"We can't just leave Nick behind,\" Samantha yells, trying to pull free even as Chris continues walking towards the next wall. \"Why not? He's a soulless deviant like Clem said three years ago.\" \"Because he's our friend!\" \"Ahmanet won't let him be killed when she's so close to getting everything she's ever wanted.\" \"Tell that to the last guy she chose for Set to wear to prom! I'm pretty sure the Medjai didn't exactly let him waltz out and start a family in Luxor.\" \"She didn't have the extra powers given to her by the Hom Dai back then either.\" Chris finally stops to turn and face her, one hand cupping her cheek and the other squeezing her shoulder. \"She's not going to let some psychotic doctor do more than bruise Nick a little, okay? He'll be fine and the ritual will be completed, then we can spend the rest of our afterlives together. We'll build an army of plastic flamingos if that's what you want.\" \"Garden gnomes, I wanted garden gnomes! And, no, that's not even the fucking point of this argument. I'm not leaving him behind.\" She pushes at Chris' wrist and lets out a surprised shout when he slams her down on one of the tables, head throbbing where it collided with the oak. \"Mother of Christ,\" she groans, flipping onto her back. \"I'm really sorry, honey, but I don't have a choice in all of this like you do. I gotta keep you from interfering too much.\" He lunges at her and looks genuinely surprised when she delivers a hard kick to his solar plexus, stumbling backwards long enough for her to roll onto her feet. \"Sammi, just stay out of this.\" \"When hell freezes over.\" \"Don't make me hurt you.\" He was advancing on her like some kind of predator, graceful where he'd never been before. \"Just go visit your parents, I'm sure they're upset.\" She shakes her head, grabbing a specimen jar off one of the shelves as she passed it. Chris lets out a rumbling growl and lunges again, thrown off balance when she dodges to the right and brings the jar down on the base of his skull. He hits the floor and doesn't get back up, glass glinting dully around him in the dim lighting. \"I'm never gonna hear the end of this,\" she sighs. Samantha runs back the way they'd come, the office trashed and empty apart from Jekyll lying prone in front of a low set of cabinets. \"Nick?!\" \"Sammi!\" She heads through the observation window and spots Nick and Jenny halfway up a set of iron stairs. \"Where's Chris?\" \"Taking a nap.\" \"Ghosts take naps? Never mind, just meet us in the lobby in ten minutes. If we're not out by then, maybe come make sure I haven't been stabbed by somebody.\" \"You got it, Sarge.\" She was just about to start walking through walls until she found the room she wants, but a glint of gold has her looking to the left and letting out a bark of laughter. \"Twenty bucks says I can get my family to stop crying if I show them the gold book.\" When no one laughs with her, she lets her shoulders sag. \"Oh yeah, I knocked out the only funny man in the group.\" With a sigh, she grabs the gold book and starts walking, the soles of her sneakers scuffing against the floor.[Chapter 6] Of all the things Samantha thought she'd do in London during her first visit in ten years, outrunning a fucking sandstorm wasn't on the list. In fact, she was calling bullshit on the past sixty-two hours of her afterlife. Every window they passed broke outward and turned to sand, joining the colossal wave of it right behind them. \"Did your great-grandparents have to deal with this,\" Nick yells over the sound of shattering glass and wind. \"More than once,\" Samantha yells back to him. \"Once, a giant wave of water took down the dirigible they were riding in!\" \"What the hell were they doing in a dirigible?\" \"It's a long story!\" They make a right turn and Nick's forced to tackle Jenny to the ground as a car flipped over them, going right through Samantha and making her world shimmer for a moment. \"I fucking hate it when that happens!\" \"Well, I hate when my girlfriend knocks me out with jars,\" Chris shouts from across the street, his scowl barely visible through the sand and debris. \"Do you really wanna fight about that right now? Because I distinctly remember you trying to stab me on that plane before it was brought down!\" \"I'm cursed! What's your excuse?!\" \"I'm dealing with two cursed idiots that want to shack up with a Boris Karloff wannabe! And on top of that, I've got half of my face smashed in and it was my good side!\" A bus is the next thing to hit her, rolling and bouncing on the asphalt, leaving a trail of busted metal behind until it came to a shuddering halt against a bank. \"You just got hit by a double decker bus!\" He seemed more excited than angry as he yelled that, and Samantha could feel hysterical laughter building in her throat. This is definitely an adventure to put in the family history book. \"I know! It was kinda awesome!\" \"Let's get off the street before those two die horribly!\" She looks behind her at the pair huddled together on the sidewalk, Jenny watching the display with interest while Nick looked about ready to murder every ghost within walking distance. \"Probably a good idea!\" He crosses the street in a flash, pressing a lingering kiss against Samantha's lips. \"I'll be glad when this is over with and you can stop being an unimaginable tool.\" \"Aw, babe, me too.\" \"Do you two mind,\" Jenny snaps,\" we're kind of on a time limit here!\" She and Nick stand up warily, shoulders hunched against the driving force of the wind. Samantha still couldn't feel the cold of it or the granules of sand that whipped right through her, her clothes and hair remaining untouched by it all. \"We need to find the quickest route into the Crusader burial chamber.\" \"You should probably just stay here since Ahmanet's thinkin' about using your guts for garters.\" Both women arch a brow at that and Chris holds up his hands in surrender. \"Alright, but it's your funeral. C'mon, there's an entrance just past that alley.\" \"Why should we trust you?\" \"Because I want you guys to find the stone so that Ahmanet can complete the ritual. Also, I'm pretty whipped.\" \"It's true,\" Nick says. \"He'd make waffles at three in the morning if Sammi asked him.\" \"It's a mutual thing though. I came home drunk one night and she didn't even mind cooking me the greasiest eggs in Iraq.\" \"Maybe just lead the way,\" Samantha interrupts. \"We can discuss our relationship when an apocalypse isn't in the making.\" Chris gives a curt nod and leads the way across the street, heading into an abandoned train depot and straight over to a doorway that had been taped off from the public. \"An ancient burial site stuck underneath modern architecture. Nice to know us Americans aren't the only ones that tempt disgruntled spirits.\" \"At least our spirits are more refined,\" Jenny quips. \"Your spirits are about as refined as a squirrel in church.\" She rolls her eyes and follows Nick down the stairs towards a platform, the ghosts allowing themselves to topple through the floor and land smoothly on a concrete platform below. Chris leads them out onto the tracks without hesitation, the others dropping down after him and taking in the gloomy surroundings. \"Did y'all know that London's first underground railway was made in 1863?\" \"Are you just ninety-nine percent random factoids?\" \"About thirty percent factoids and seventy percent Kushary.\" The lights lining the tunnel flicker a couple of times and then begin to burst one by one, throwing the tunnel into pitch blackness. \"Welp, that doesn't bode well.\" \"At least the glass isn't turning into sand. I hate that.\" \"Yeah, it's coarse, irritating and it gets everywhere.\" There's a heavy sigh somewhere on Samantha's left and she guesses now isn't really the time to quote certain Sith Lords. \"Chris, how much father do we need to go?\" The lights flicker on again, their glass casings shattered but the bulbs intact, just in time for the group to witness a mob of the undead heading right for them. \"Does that answer your question,\" Chris asks as the hoard past them. \"No, it just makes me want to punch someone.\" Samantha turns and lands a solid punch against Nick's arm, her friend flinching and rubbing his bicep with a frown. \"What the fuck, Sammi,\" he grumbles. \"You were closer than Chris.\" \"Hey, guys,\" Jenny asks,\" why are my feet vibrating?\" \"Probably because this is an active line and there's a train coming.\" \"And you didn't think to share that information?\" \"Well, I'm already dead so….\" She trails off with a shrug, scratching at the back of her neck. \"Move off to the side and don't touch the metal rails, you'll be fine.\" The living half of their group presses up against the far wall and then the train was slamming into the ghosts, the world scattering and piecing back together a second later. \"I really hate these time jumps,\" Chris complains, glancing around them. They're still far underground if the crumbling arches and lack of screaming is any indication, the tunnel replaced by a vaulted room filled with high tech equipment and crumbling crypts. \"You okay over there?\" \"I'll be okay when Ahmanet is back to being fully dead instead of just mostly dead.\" She lets out a gusty sigh, giving the Princess a long look. \"I swear to Allah, those Medjai need better methods of punishment other than live burial and ancient curses.\" \"I'm with ya there.\" She moves over to one of the empty coffins, running her hand over the cold bone of the dagger, fingers lingering over the red stone that was fitted into the end of the hilt. It was pulsing and warm like a heart, a steady rhythm that made Samantha's mind wander to nights spent with her ear over Chris' chest. \"Sammi?\" \"I want to watch her die, Chris. I want it to hurt after what she did to us.\" \"If anyone can make that happen, it'll be Nick.\" As though summoned, Nick comes shooting up out of the water with an unconscious Jennifer Halsey in his arms, both of them soaked through to the bone. \"That does not look comfortable.\" \"Nope.\" The undead Crusaders pull them the rest of the way out of the water, tugging Jenny away from Nick and depositing her in the shallow end of the pool. Chris and Samantha move closer, dread curling in Sammi's belly when she sees that Jenny's chest isn't moving. Jesus, she's really dead . Nick looks wrecked where he kneels, blue eyes cloudy with tears for the first time since Samantha's known him. \"Don't blame yourself,\" Ahmanet says, her English perfect even if it was accented. \"She was always doomed just as your friends were.\" The creature is whole as she descends the steps further into the chamber, her tattoos clearer than ever against the ashy gray of her skin. The knights dissolve into dust as Ahmanet draws closer, blowing away on an impossible breeze. \"There are worse fates than death.\" \"Are you speaking from experience,\" he remarks, voice hoarse. \"Regretting that little deal you made with Set?\" He nods towards the dagger in her hand and his gaze snaps to Sammi before meeting Ahmanet's stare again. \"Come to me.\" He staggers to his feet, taking a couple of slow steps before sprinting at Ahmanet, getting slapped down before he could reach her. \"I can take your pain away.\" \"Right now, you're the biggest pain.\" She lets out a yowl of rage and tosses him through the air, Nick's body bouncing and sliding off one of the crypts. He manages to get back to his feet and do another run, but she just slaps him back to the ground like it was nothing. \"Hasn't anyone ever told you that you can catch more flies with honey than vinegar,\" Chris asks, striding forward and kicking Ahmanet in her kidneys. She stumbles forward a step and lets out a low grunt, elbowing Chris in the nose hard enough to make him drop to his knees. \"Maybe you should see a therapist for your anger problems.\" \"Yeah, they did wonders with me.\" Samantha picks up a rusted sconce from the ground, testing the weight before adjusting her grip and joining the rest of her team. \"I can recommend a good one if you—\" Ahmanet kicks Nick in the chest, sending him skidding ass over tea kettle across the ground. \"You know, there was always one reliable thing about our team.\" Chris is still bent over with his broken nose, but he meets her gaze steadily as Samantha advances. \"You can always know that if one of us is around, the other two are close by.\" \"And why should I care about that,\" Ahmanet questions. Samantha draws the sconce back like a bat, ready to swing at a moment's notice. \"Because, while Nick and I are annoyances, Samantha's the real bitch in the group when you get her angry.\" \"And you know what they say about scorned women, right,\" Samantha asks. Ahmanet turns just in time for Samantha to bring her weapon down, the iron colliding with the mummy's face and smashing the fragile bones in her cheek. \"Hell ain't got nothing on me.\" \"I've done a lot of weird shit since I turned eighteen, but fighting a mummy is definitely the one I'll brag about most.\" Chris grabs the dagger while Ahmanet's distracted, throwing it to Nick and letting out a soft sigh when the other man catches it. Ahmanet lurches forward, but the ghosts grab onto her ankles like a pair of Velcro teddy bears with abandonment issues. \"I really am sorry about this, sweetheart,\" Nick rasps as he regains his footing,\" but this relationship was never going to work out. It's not me, it's you.\" He gazes over towards the ghosts and then Jenny's prone body several feet away, his features softening. \"But I think I'll take you up on part of your offer. See, if I get superpowers, then I can bring my friends back to life.\" \"Is he gonna do what I think he's gonna do?\" \"I wouldn't want to disappoint you this far along, Vail.\" \"Nick, wait—\" The bone of the dagger slides easily between Nick's ribs, sending him flat to his back in a twitching and writhing fit. \"Nick,\" Samantha screams. She releases the hold she had on Ahmanet and crawls over to him as the convulsions grow worse. \"Nick!\" He's completely still when she reaches him, breaths deep and even as though he was in REM sleep. \"Come on, buddy, you need to open your eyes.\" \"Is he… Is he dead?\" \"I don't think so.\" The small veins along his forehead and right cheek turn black, slow crawling lines like tar spilling over the cracks in sidewalk. His eyes open gradually, his pupils and irises splitting and moving until they're doubles in the sclera. Nick pulls the dagger out of his chest and tosses it carelessly to the side, the blackened stone shattering when it hits the ground. \"Sammi,\" Chris hisses, gesturing violently for her to move away. Nick doesn't even seem to notice the ghost as he stands up, his posture all wrong for the man Samantha's fought beside for the past fifteen years. He moves gracefully around debris until there was less than a foot of space between him and the mummy, one of his hands cupping Ahmanet's chin. \" Setepa-i ,\" he murmurs, voice a low rumble in his chest. \"Samantha, get over here.\" Nick's head snaps to the left and Samantha throws herself between him and her boyfriend, ready to scratch his eyes out should he try to hurt Chris. Instead of attacking, Nick doubles over in pain as his eyes shift between their normal form and Set's. \"Sarge, you gotta fight this.\" \"We didn't come this far just for you to screw up a plan again,\" Samantha adds, squaring her shoulders. \"We still got some gold to sell, remember?\" He lets out a low keening sound and then he's straightening up sharply, throwing Ahmanet against a wall clear on the other side of the room. He's in front of her in a flash, pinning her there by her neck. She slaps at him again, but Nick's stronger and he slams her down on top of a crypt, sealing his mouth over hers in a mockery of a kiss. Ahmanet's body seems to shrivel in a matter of seconds, bones and ligament drying and petrifying until she's back to the husk she'd started out as before those cops fed her. Nick pushes her corpse away from him in disgust, stumbling over to where Jenny was still laid out in the pool of water. He hunches protectively over her body, mumbling and crying, face transforming into something that belonged in a Supernatural episode; his teeth turn to jagged points and black ink raises up along his forehead and cheeks, his howl echoing off the stone eerily. \"Nick, that's enough,\" Samantha yells, not backing down when he glares up at her. Jenny arches beneath him in response, Nick darting off into the shadows as she turns onto her side and coughs up the water in her lungs. \"Come on, Chris, let them have some privacy for this.\" \"Yeah,\" Chris nods,\" okay.\" He gets to his feet and heads back into the tunnel, lacing his fingers with Samantha's. They walk for a few minutes in silence, just leaning against each other and reveling in a curse-free afterlife that Chris had been denied from the start. \"You think they got pizza in Heaven?\" Chris lets out a bark of laughter, the corners of his eyes crinkling as he turns to face her. \"I mean, I'm not gonna complain if they don't, but I think we've earned it after what we just went through.\" \"I'm sure the big guy can arrange something for us.\" He makes a face as he stares down at his blood-stained clothes, using his free hand to adjust his shirt collar. \"Hopefully that'll include a wardrobe upgrade.\" \"Just close your eyes and picture yourself wearing something different.\" They squeeze their eyes shut at the same time, Samantha not looking up again until the tank top and shorts changed to a halter top dress and a pair of red pumps. \"See? Easy-peasy.\" When her eyes flutter open again, Chris is wearing a pair of jeans and an old Darth Vader tee, all of him blood free even if his eye was still a little wonky. \"If you guys are finished being clichéd, how about we bring you back to life,\" Nick remarks as he sidles up to them. \"Sammi, you can be first.\" \"Because you love me or because I make a better guinea pig than Chris does?\" He pauses as he thinks that over, then gives an easy shrug. \"I'm gonna go with both.\" He cups her face before she could argue, pressing his lips over hers and blowing into her mouth. The taste was surprising considering the fact that Nick hasn't brushed his teeth in going on three days now, sweet as candy floss with a bitter after taste like molasses that made her cheeks feel warm and her lungs burn. She jerks back and sucks in a lungful of air, pressing her hand over her heart and laughing when she feels the steady beating under her palm. He does the same thing to Chris, the gray complexion gaining color back until he was a healthy tan again even under the bad light of the tunnel. \"We're alive,\" Chris breathes, pressing his hand over Samantha's where it covered her heart. \"Oh my God, we're back.\" She throws herself into Chris' arms, not wanting to let him go for anything in the world. \"We're gonna have a hell of a time explaining this to my mother.\" \"Just give your families a call and tell them that the army did what it's best at.\" \"Screwing up the simplest of things?\" \"Exactly.\" Samantha pulls back from her boyfriend, sending Nick a teary smile. He may be the world's biggest asshole at the best of times, but she still loved him. He was one of her best friends and their team wouldn't work without the hot-headed adrenaline junky. \"Sorry that I couldn't bring your left arm back, Sammi.\" \"That's alright,\" she shrugs,\" I'm ambidextrous.\" The next afternoon finds them back in the hustle and bustle of London, Samantha wanting one last good memory of the place before they ship out to Egypt to start Nick's training. It was strange to be back in her own body after spending so long as a ghost, but her face wasn't caved in anymore and she considered that a win. They've just come out of a diner when Samantha spots something across the way, a smile making the corners of her mouth twitch up. \"Hey, you still feel guilty about getting me killed, right,\" she asks, brown eyes trained on the little store over Nick's shoulder. The window display boasted lawn decorations with green construction paper taped to the glass to look like grass and a papier-mâché sun hanging from a ceiling tile. \"I brought you back,\" Nick frowns. \"What more do you want from me?\" \"Twenty bucks and we'll call it even.\" He rolls his eyes, but hands the money over all the same, him and Chris watching in confusion as she runs into the store. \"I'm not gonna regret this, am I?\" Sammi doesn't answer, more focused on the object that had caught her eye. She didn't say another word as she came back out of the shop, grinning when Chris' eyes light up. \"Seriously? A fucking lawn gnome?\" \"It was either this or a puppy.\" \"Well, you can't kill a lawn gnome.\" \"We should totally name it,\" Chris laughs, taking the hunk of clay carefully. It was painted in cheery pinks, yellows, and blues, and it would probably look great sitting outside some little suburban house, but it would never see that lifestyle. In all likelihood, it'll probably spend most of its time in a saddlebag while they helped Nick control his Mighty Morphin Zombie powers. \"Gnorm the Gnome, silent G's all around.\" \"I can't believe I brought you two back to life for this.\" \"It's the closest thing you'll ever have to a godson.\" \"Fine, but we're buying another gnome so Gnorm isn't lonely. It can be called Gned.\" Kushary plate is a mix of rice, pasta, tomato sauce, onions, lentils, chickpeas and garlic.

In ancient Egypt, Pharaoh sat watching his people with a straight back and a furrowed brow. He watched them bring in the waters of the Nile and the children of the workers play. They laughed and sung; some ran and kicked the ball. Each child was happy with round bellies and clean skin. He wondered then of his own child, the one still inside his wife. She sat in the courtyard with the children watching them with gentle eyes. Her belly swelled with life and her hand cradled it rubbing lazy circles. 'There lies my son,' he thought. 'Safe in his mother and in moons, out to fullfill my legacy.' He wanted to be remembered. Pharoah watched his wife with a keen eye, but his thoughts were miles away. When his son was born, he'd inherit Upper and Loyal Egypt. He would have to endure the long hours planning their survival, communing with the the Gods for guidance and fighting to protect his home from enemies. What of the enemies in Egypt? The Church of Amun grew strong and favored by the people: a risk to their dynasty. So it was decided then, his son would marry a girl from the Church of Amun born to be his bride and daughter of the Highest Priest. Pharaoh looked away then from his wife calling for his advisors. It took much out of him. Some argued his son must decide his own bride for he would rule with her by his side. Another argued sending the message was a sign of weakness. \"A plea,\" the man said with a head high and perhaps too big. There were more who saw reason. To unite the two further would lessen the danger. Both high born offspring would marry once they were mature. If he did not like his wife, he could take another or a concubine. The message was sent, a reply sent back first and his plan seemed to come to fruition. It was not meant to be. On the birthing table his wife laid dead and gone. The child alive and strong but not a son. The son, Ahmen, that he pictured for months did not exist. A daughter who he named Ahmanet, the feminine after the wife of the God, was what he had. Pharaoh notified the church without a care grieving for his wife and the future he'd seen with his son. The deal survived because of a clause. The High Priest's wife was pregnant with the one day Pharaoh's bride. The deal was for their daughter to marry a child of Pharaoh, and there were years to have a son. They gave Pharaoh their daughter who was aptly named Meritamen: beloved of Amun. The two girls were to be companions until a birth of a son would divide them. Meritamen was raised to be a queen with the people, palace and Pharaoh-to-be on her side. Ahmanet trained to be a Pharaoh as her father failed time and time again to provide a son. It was hard for both with many hours spent with tutors and Ahmanet learning to defend her country. In the spaces between, the girls looked to one another playing together when allowed and sneaking to each other's bed to talk when they could not play. The years were kind to them both. Meritamen grew wise and beautiful with eyes the color of copper that haunted Ahmanet when she closed hers. Ahmanet grew strong: a talented fighter, a head for math and beautiful. Meritamen smiled at the mention of her name and found comfort in the nights they shared each other's bed. It was a badly kept secret. One night with the Pharaoh, he proclaimed to Ahmanet when was Pharaoh she could choose a consort male or female. Immediately, she thought of her Merita with copper eyes and each curl that bounced with her every step. Ahmanet looked straight into her father's eyes proclaiming she would marry Meritamen when she became Pharaoh clearing him of his deal. He would never understand. The birth of Pharaoh's son spelt the end for everything Ahmanet held dear. Her future as Pharaoh was as good as dead. Her father had the son he wished and grew cold. Her love, her Meritamen, betrothed to the infant boy who'd she marry once he came to age. It was too much. Meritamen thought for hours on how to get out of it. She did not want to marry a child. She wanted Ahmanet who warmed her bed and took care of her heart. No long term solution could be found without a death. She couldn't kill an innocent child and could not fathom how to get the Pharaoh without being caught. She was doomed. She would be Queen with the wrong child of Pharaoh. Ahmanet had no such misgivings. In the dead of night while Meritamen slept, she made a deal that changed it all. She prayed naked and vulnerable in the cold of her table. She was still strong and proud until he heard her call. Then she shook cringing as the contract tore her skin and Set hoarsely breathed down her neck. Set answered her plea for her rightful birthright with power beyond her imagination. She killed that night: the Pharaoh for his cold heart, the concubine and the crying son in the next room. There was still a price: a human body for Set. A loyal servant offered. He laid flat as the Princess moved for the Dagger of Set. He imagined immortality and perhaps Ahmanet by his side. If not, he saw the titles and the potential to rule both the Princess and her consort. He saw the gold and the power but not the arrow that would end his life. Amahnet was found before the dagger could touch his heart. Paralyzing darts ended her fight. She could only watch as they wrapped her in linen and covered her coffin heedless of her screams. They buried her where she'd never be found. Entombed deep in the earth alive, she wasted away for killing the royal family. Meritamen was never seen again. From there was a curse. Whoever freed her, would bring Set into this world. Amahnet would return her heart black and ready to fight for her throne denied. She would return angry and broken haunted by copper eyes that cried in the darkness. Ahmanet was trapped there for a millenia. Then she was not.[Chapter 2] If anyone asks Dr. Lelah Fidelis Rene, there is no such thing as coincidences. She believes in facts.

Don't leave a one night stand, especially her friend, the morning after without so much as a note after n their shared suite. Check. Don't take her belongings without permission. Hmmm. Stealing their lives' work that Lelah sacrificed her whole life for? He's asking to die. As always, Lelah comes early and prepared to northern Iraq just moments before her colleague. She stomps through the sand unseen; her five feet hiding her from the busy soldiers' gaze. The area is surrounded by them, and she knows exactly why. The men march in unison leaving her unseen and unheard easily drowned hers out. She continues to creep through the sand, watching them all with a hawk's focus, until she notices his face. Nick Morton. Thanks to having a younger big sister, she gives him the uppercut of his life. (She ignores the dream of a bronzed woman she's never met curling her fingers into a perfect fist.) Her fist connects with his jaw with a solid crack. His jaw rattled with the impact as he left the sand to crash into it only seconds later. He rose with a crack of his jaw and a perfect imprint of her knuckles blooming near his chin. \"I deserve that,\" he said moving his jaw sideways and back to ensure it wasn't popped out of place. The men cringed in sympathy rubbing their jaws in unison. \"That is the least I owe you,\" she finished primly before looking at the approaching Dr. Jennifer Halsey. The statuesque blonde walked over with each step surprising graceful despite the unsteady landscape. She kept her head high and her shoulders back as she stared at the scene. Two men, one black and obviously of a higher rank, the other not, wearing what could pass as civilian clothes. Both drop their hands from their chin at her attention. The last is the Nick Morton, the thief, on his ass rubbing his tender face. \"Pity, Lelah found you first.\" Jenny held out her hand. He didn't question it and was on his feet fast enough. With one hand, she studied the growing mark. \"That'll sting,\" she clicks to herself softly. The same hand that checked his face let go only to connect harshly to the skin of his cheek. The sound of the rushing air between her fingertips created a satisfying loud whack. She smiles as a matching bruise, albeit lighter than the punch, starts to rise to the surface. \"I hope that stung too,\" she finishes dryly. Lelah smirks at Jenny's side holding in a snicker. \"Now where is it?\" Moron grasps his cheek hissing at the forming mark. He looks between both women shocked. \"Where is it?\" Lelah repeats Jenny stepping closer to him. He flinches. \"Don't play dumb. We're in the middle of the desert and your boss isn't protecting you right now. Do you want to go home in casts or walking on two feet?\" \"What? Where is what?\" Lelah sighs, exasperated. She walks into Moron's face rolling her eyes at his rookie mistake. \"You know exactly what we're talking about,\" Lelah says gritting it through her teeth. \"You already admitted I punched you for a reason. Just say it so we can move on.\" Nick stays silent eyes jumping between the two women. The blonde Jenny, slender and tall, waited for his response with a hand on her hip. The brunette Lelah waits stone-faced her crossed over her chest. He keeps his eyes firmly on theirs still sore from the punch about a comment, not an action. \"The letter,\" she scowls deeper. \"The map you stole from me.\" Nick fake gasps. \"Map? I have no idea what you're talking about.\" His eyebrows raise, and Lelah tilts her head giving Jenny the universal can-you-believe-this-shit side eye women share. \"I've never even had the opportunity to steal anything from you, Miss...?\" Both women chuckle, incredulous. \"It's 2017, Sergeant Moron. No will cares if a woman has casual sex,\" Lelah says giving the men around her a pointed glare. Jenny sarcastically smiles at the man in camo. \"Sergeant Nick is under the impression I would be embarrassed to tell you I had him in my hotel room three nights ago in Baghdad. While I was in the bathroom, he hit on my roommate-\" \"It was a bad joke,\" he says eyeing Lelah warily. Jenny continues as if he never spoke. \"And whilst I was sleeping, he went through my things,\" Jenny glares at Nick. \"I'm not embarrassed, Nick. Disgusted? Yes. Regretful? Yes,\" She scoffs. \"But mainly just amazed, at your ability to mimic all the qualities of genuine human intimacy if only for...\" Jenny glances down meaningfully to the men's laughs. \"Fifteen seconds?\" \"Ten,\" Lelah corrected. \"To think, I was in the next room and you could've had more fun with me.\" Jenny winked as everyone laughed. The Colonel coughed loudly. \"Where is the map, Moron-Morton?\" he corrects himself. Nick looks up at the Colonel voice higher than usual. \"Sir, I admit that Miss Halsey and I spent an amazing evening together in Baghdad,\" he says emphasizing the next sentence loudly. \"A long and satisfying evening,\" He ignored Lelah as she made a v with her pointer and middle finger licking the space in between. Jenny bit her cheek as they both straightened their faces. \"-if her reactions are to be considered sincere. But sir, I left with nothing more than fond memories.\" He looks between the Colonel and Jenny. \"Now, perhaps I may have neglected to say goodbye to her the next morning only because she was exhausted and I didn't want to wake her.\" Jenny walked away finished with the whole conversation. \"And the reward for my gracious consideration?\" he says loudly in her direction. \"Sir, 'Hell hath no fury.'\" A sudden weight hits his back leg. He collapses with the last word as he falls into the ground. A small puff of dust rises. Lelah looks away biting her tongue and escaping to Jenny. Nick stays there half kneeling in the sand. \"Get up,\" Lelah calls out. \"You're embarrassing yourself.\" He starts to get up but continues watching them walk farther away. No one tells him about the dusty footprint on the back of his calf. \"Stop watching my ass!\"[Chapter 3] The stone face silently screams in the dark of the crater. The underground leaves a lasting impression on the face. Earth clings to the black stone after millennia underground. Its eyes are dark and chain Lelah to the sand. She stands at the mouth of the hole: brown eyes trained on the scream. Muted shrieks echo through her ears and a voice choked with tears whispers: \"Meritamen.\" Lela shivers at the halted name. Her heart aches deep in her chest as she struggles to breathe through it. The voice sounds so familiar: husky yet sweet. Again, the name echoes through her ears until someone misses a step behind her. She blinks. The voice is gone and soon so will her friend. Lelah grabs Jenny's arm roughly right before she can hit the sand and possibly slide down. It happens so quickly few catch the misstep Jenny comes to her feet quickly, unshaken and smiling widely. Jenny hits Lelah's arm repeatedly, excited. \"Oh my God! Lela, don't you see it?!\" Lelah nods still coming back to herself. Chris, the man wearing the same uniform as Nick, approaches. He looks anything but scary. Chris awkwardly rubs his neck staring into the dark of the tunnel. Lelah sees him and grins when he flinches at the depth of the hole. Jenny notices his attention. \"It's Egyptian,\" She says half explaining half thinking out loud. \"Why is that-?\" \"We're not in Egypt,\" Lelah says interrupting. \"Yeah, we're on the Fertile Crescent, but this is Mesopotamia.\" \"We're on the Persian Gulf, Chris.\" Jenny nods without looking at anyone. \"Right. Egypt is a thousand miles away, so it's pretty unusual,\" Chris surmises shaking his head. Both archaeologists race to the Colonel. As Jenny grabs the supplies, Lelah begins to talk. \"Colonel, my partner and I are here to save ancient relics from being destroyed. There is no reason an Egyptian work should be underground unless it's leading to a room. That room is probably filled with countless treasures that are now exposed because of that air strike. You need to protect this area until we get as much out as possible.\" Lelah waited for him to meet her eyes. \"I want in there and you're letting me,\" Lelah says gesturing towards him. \"Name your price.\" As Lelah scales down the tunnel, she eyes the men behind her in suspicion. Nick's friend apparently named Chris shrinks back when her eyes meet his. Good. Lelah stares down Nick from head to toe as they start to reach the middle. She gives one last meaningful glare at his eyes and hands before looking down to see their progress. The hole is larger than Lelah thought. A pit forms in her stomach. The farther they go, the darker it becomes. She refuses to give into it. At a certain point, Lelah reaches for her flashlight glaring at the rocky walls. She bites her cheek as they continue down. At a snail's pace, they gradually reach the ground. Lelah is the first to remove herself from the safety harness, and her hair stands up as she feels someone watching her. She points her flashlight almost dropping at what she sees. Behind her was the gigantean figure: all man except for his birdlike head. A single eye stared down Lelah, and she held in a chill. The Set statue would've hidden Lelah in his shadow if sunlight reached that deep. It was an otherworldly green under her flashlight. She swallowed harshly as she took in his stance. Set, the god of violence, desert, storms, and chaos knelt on one knee. What would possess a god to bow to another? There's an audible click as the video camera starts rolling. \"I am in a large antechamber of some kind,\" Jenny says walking further in and Lelah follows behind. \"There's an inscription on the northern wall.\" Lelah steps closer trying to make sense of the hieroglyphs. Her neck turns swiftly as she hears a mass of dirt and rock fall on the men behind. Lelah walks closer to them studying the silver metallic liquid in Nick's hands. \"What is that? Mercury?\" Chris and Lelah lean into watching drops of the liquids fall into Nick's hands. \"Jenny, it's mercury,\" Lelah marveled. Jenny took a closer look. \"The ancient Egyptians believed it weakened evil spirits,\" she thought aloud. Lelah looked down seeing the narrow trail of mercury. \"Kills you too.\" \"Makes you crazy,\" Chris added. \"There's a canal system,\" Lelah says quietly following the silver road. With each step, she leaves the group to themselves walking deeper into the antechamber. The archaeologist turns on her own camera. She taking in the writings on the walls and the mercury stream. She passes numerous statues: each in a fighting stance or bowing. \"Someone important was put in here,\" she says aloud. \"I'm not seeing evidence that supports this, however. They must have done something unforgivable.\" \"-big lights!\" Abruptly, the antechamber is bathed in light, but she can't stop now. There in the center of the room is a deep power of glowing silver. Lelah stumbles over almost leaning on one of the protective statues. She looks down cringing. A skull stares back at her an unbroken bracelet still around his wrist. She takes a deep breath to calm herself as the others catch up. \"The people here could have been priests or followers of this person. Perhaps guards,\" she narrates for the recorder ignoring the pairs of eyes watching her. \" will confirm.\" Lelah walks around the pool ignoring Jenny's own recording attempts. She studies the chains around the big pillars. \"Meant to keep in not out,\" she mutters aloud. Out of the corner of her eye, she sees a dirty hand reach for a necklace glowing dully under the muted flares of flashlights. \"DON'T!\" Nick jumps at the sudden sound and barely stops himself from falling. \"We both steal things from the dead,\" he retorts throwing his hands in the air. \"Stop acting all high and mighty because you're paid to.\" She watches him, impassive. \"Every man has a price. Not everyone makes theirs off stealing from the dead.\" Lelah turns her back to him. \"There is a canal at the center of them,\" Jenny speaks into her recorder. \"that feeds a ritual well at the base, filled with mercury. Beads of scarabs, scarab signal rings. This is a high priest of Ammon from the temple of the Thebes. There is a ritual barrier chain that's around the well as a warning to intruders.\" Jenny takes a breath. \"To keep people out.\" \"There isn't a single provision made for someone's journey into the underworld. No Canopic jars, no Shabtis.\" Lelah's face falls. \"This is a fate worse than death in Ancient Egypt,\" Lelah finishes. Jenny nods distracted walking around the pool. \"There are six watchers around the well facing inward instead of out. Whatever is in there,\" Jenny takes a breath.\"Those chains aren't for bringing it up. They are for holding it down. This is not a tomb. It's a prison. Lelah takes a breath staring at the chains coming from the water. Her eyes follow as they wind across the wide pillars and go towards the ceiling. She can't voice what she's searching for until she finds it. \"Meritamen...\". She couldn't hear the harsh whispers behind her. \"I'm not leaving until I see what's in that pool.,\" Jenny shouts. It pulls Lelah out of her daze. \"It's staying,\" she hears Chris say stubbornly. Lelah feels behind her back sighing at the cool feel of metal. She raises it and aims for that peculiar chain that connects to them all. \"Having a cop sister better pay off,\" she mutters to herself. Lelah shoots. The chain snaps. Something moves in the pool. Lelah's neck whips in that direction. A sarcophagus raises with a bronzed scream. The face is feminine with a full mouth shrieking and vomiting mercury. Lelah holds in a chill. The eyes are unseeing but the empty sockets glue Lelah's feet to the ground. \"It's going with us,\" Lelah answers not looking behind her. Why bother? She can already feel them watching her. Then they start screaming. Camel spiders. Colonies of them run at the group. 'Brown amazon-legged creatures with furry legs and many eyes,' Lelah thinks and immediately regrets She can hear Chris's shrieks but closes her eyes holding her breath. Gunshots. They ricochet off the stone walls but Lelah is frozen. \"Cease fire!\" Nick screams. \"They are not poisonous! They are camel spiders, Vail! Camel spiders! Are you out of your mind?\" \"It bit me!\" Chris shrieks back but the gunshots stop. All noise stops. Lelah opens her eyes. She took a deep breathtaking in the warm rays and glittering sands. Lelah looks around her. Mountains of the golden sand stretch as far as she can dipping into hills and valleys. Lelah takes in the peace of this desert enjoying the heat against her skin. \"Meritamen...\" She turns her head at the whisper. A long white train dances in the breeze. Turquoise dipped fingers trailing down her spine. Lelah is speechless. Across the burning sands, she sees a woman. This woman is...Lelah can't think. She sees the bronze skin shining in the sun. She sees lean thighs and bare feet: forgotten moments of them wrapped around her. Raven black hair curling in the heat, 'always smelling like her favorite oils', a voice reminds her. Fiery dark eyes keep Lelah rooted to her spot lined in fierce cold and sapphire blue paint. Lelah looks down. Blue, 'turquoise', a voice corrects covers the tips of her toes. Gently, a slender hand raises her head from the ground. The woman leans in their noses touched. Sure hands grasp Lelah's waist. \"I hoped you would find me.\" she almost whispers nosing Lelah's jawline. \"I missed you.\" She trails kisses from her jaw to her full lips. Those dark eyes make Lelah's heartbeat out her chest. \"My chosen.\" She leans in impossibly close breathing against Lelah's lips. \"My one.\" Lelah shuts her eyes as at the gentle pressure of her kiss. \"Lelah!\" She jumps. \"Are you okay?\" Both Jenny and Nick speak but only Jenny runs over. She lays her hand across Lelah's forehead. \"You're burning up,\" she says, worried.\"Nick get a team to get the sarcophagus so we can leave.\" \"We have company coming. We need to leave like yesterday,\" he rebuts. \"I speak for both of us when I say we're not leaving without that sarcophagus.\" Everything goes by in a rush. In a daze, she watches as they lift the sarcophagus from its jail. Crows, a hundred at least, fly by and settle near them. Out of it, she drops a couple crackers for them. She races to the plane with Jenny urging the men to be careful, she's priceless, she's ancient until the sarcophagus is safely locked down in its ropes. Jenny leads Lelah to a seat pushing cold water bottles into her lap before running to read the sarcophagus. An awkward silence builds between the nearby Nick and Lelah. \"I'm sorry for the threesome comment,\" Nick said scratching his head. \"I had a couple drinks but that's no excuse. I'm not against lesbians or anything. Honest.\" \"Pansexual,\" Lelah corrects him. \"Just because I'm attracted to girls too doesn't make me a lesbian.\" \"Yeah, that,\" he finishes lamely. \"I have nothing against you or anything.\" Lelah nods along shutting her eyes briefly. A warm hand grasps the back of her neck- \"You're welcome, by the way.\" His voice shatters the illusion. Lelah watches him, silent. \"Without me, it'd never be found otherwise.\" Lelah closed her eyes again touching her forehead. \"You stole it from Jenny after having sex with her.\" Nick's smile wanes. \"I still found it.\" \"5,000 years it sat there,\" she reminded him. \"Without me,' he emphasizes. Lelah exhales loudly. \"You're absolutely right,\" she said her voice sweet as sugar. \"I should thank you.\" \"It was noth-\" \"Thank you for leading me to the find of my career. Thank you for trying to fetishize my sexuality. Thank you for TRYING TO STEAL EVERYTHING I'VE WORKED AS A CHILD FOR A PAYROLL!\" The men jump at the sudden shout. One rises to reprimand her. Lelah holds up a single finger pointing to the other side of the plane. The soldier follows the instruction while the others try to whisper. She ignores them all focusing on Nick's quickly reddening face. She leans forward close to his ear. She breathes and he shivers at the contact. \"I'm not forgetting the fact you used my friend.\" Nick opens his mouth, and Lelah shushes him. \"So you need to talk to her about that.\" Lelah shakes her head. \"The next time you steal from me it's on sight,\" she finishes almost mouthing the words. \"I study mummies for a living. Don't think for a second I don't know how to make one.\" She rises slowly wiping imaginary sand off her khaki shorts before making her way to the sarcophagus. \"This is Dr. Jennifer Halsey,\" Jenny pushes up her glasses as she speaks. \"Conducting a preliminary analysis of an Egyptian sarcophagus discovered in the Nineveh province, northern Iraq. The hieroglyphs are definitely the New Kingdom. It appears that the wife of King Menehptre died in childbirth leaving a sole heir to the throne a girl called Ahmanet.\" Lelah tilts her head as she hears the dull thuds of staffs hitting one another. She caresses the sarcophagus amazed at its warmth. \"I can take over from here, Jenny,\" Lelah says her eyes not leaving the screaming face. She blinks as the beautiful woman from before dodges a hit smoothly, eyes never wavering from her male opponent. 'Ahmanet,' a husky voice whispers. The bronze woman bows to a man; a heart-stopping smirk on her face. They lay in a room with soft sheets and translucent curtains. Her soft hands' trails from Lelah's lips to the honeyed skin of her belly. \"Setap'i,' Ahmanet whispers on Lelah's thighs. \"We will meet again.\" Ahmanet kisses her and Lelah gasps as the dagger breaks skin... Lelah blinks, and the world has changed. The corporal's body makes an odd sound as it hits the ground. She gasps stumbling away. \"Chris put the knife down!\" 'It isn't him,' Lelah thought as she scrambled away from him. He was the walking dead. His left eye, a milky white orb, blind and open. His skin a rotting light gray that turned Lelah's stomach and his veins... Black. Marred. Dead. They all huddle together against the end of the plane. Three gunshots and what used to be Chris Vail is dead. Hundreds of ravens so the pilots are dead. As Lelah is airborne, she thinks of the parachutes on the nearby wall. She slams into the unrelenting metal headfirst with the taste of metal on her tongue and something warm trailing down her cheek. \"PARACHUTE!\" \"PARACHUTE!\" Nick clicks Jenny's on in seconds sending her flying out the broken wall safe and sound. There's only one parachute left. Lelah makes her choice. The click of the belt sounds like her death bell. She hugs the man who wasn't as careless as she thought. She pushes him out with the same ferocity she punched him before. There, leaning against the wall, Lelah waits to die with her eyes fully closed and screaming at the pressure as the plane meets the ground.[Chapter 4] Lelah chokes on her screams. Her eyes are wide as vainly clutches at her throat. She digs into the hand she finds: tearing skin and breaking nails. He doesn't let up. He stands over her with one hand around her neck and the other in her hair. He wraps his fist around her hair pushing her deeper into the murky Nile. She opens her eyes, desperate, kicking her legs at the black ones in front of her. \"Give in.\" It takes her a moment to realize it's not English. \"Die, Meritamen,\" he says impassively. Lelah's vision starts to blur. She takes in the black cloth tied around his neck and the dark eyes that emptily gaze at her. \"Don't make this harder on herself.\" Her lungs burn. Her body won't move. She feels her eyes roll back. Lelah bursts out of the body bag wet and silently screaming. She tears at the bag ripping the clear plastic from her skin. Lelah pulls at her arms, at her legs, and holds herself in the dark of the morgue. She trembles on the cold metal slab huddled in a ball. Lelah closes her eyes burying her face in her arms. She stays there, quiet and small, under the fluorescent lights. The lights flicker. Lelah opens her eyes slowly. She takes in the dull gray of the morgue. The room is bleak: all metals and whites. She ignores the white sheets on the tables like hers. She makes it out heads, arms, feet... Lelah bites her cheek until she tastes metal. She tugs on the little strip of paper on her big toe making out 'UNKNOWN' in all caps. The hair on the back of her neck stands up. Like a chill, it travels up her spine gnawing at her senses. Her fingers tremble slightly as she feels for something sharp. She grabs the scalpel holding it tight. Lelah stills before looking behind her. Nothing. Still paranoid, she turns forward. Lelah throws the scalpel, eyes the size of planets, as it passes through him. Chris Vail. Her stomach rolls at what's left of Nick's best friend. He is a mottled gray. There is dark bruising on his temples and arms like someone threw him. Already, one eye is a milky ball but it focuses on Lelah. The other eye, still brown, stares into Lelah intently. She tries to ignore the three bloodstains on the white tee. She still remembers those gunshots. \"You were with Nick Morton,\" Lelah says stammering.\"I watched you die.\" The creature in front of her watches her impassive. \"We need to talk.\" Lelah scoffs tucking her hair behind her ears. \"We don't have much to talk about at all. We've met once,\" she struggles for words. \"You shouldn't even be here. What is even going on?\" \"You know what's going on,\" he says leaning forward. Lelah recoiling. \"We died on the plane, didn't we?\" Chris Vail laughs. It's dark and twisted: a mockery of a laugh. He walks closer to Lelah holding onto the metal slab. He's still smiling, the teeth surprisingly still white, when he answers. \"Dead?\" Chris Vail loses his smile. \"No. But you are gonna wish you were.\" Lelah's eyes widened, and the door opens with an audible click. She turns swiftly, speechless. She makes out the dark shadows behind the warped glass. Lelah grabs the discarded plastic and pulls it tight across her body. \"Come on this way, please.\" They walk in and freeze at the sight of Lelah. Lelah clutches the plastic tighter. It's silent for a moment. \"I-I-I-,\" Nicks says stammering. \"Can someone get her some damn clothes?\" Jenny stumbles forward before breaking into a dead run. Her red eyes shine in the lights. The blonde hair waves behind her as she collides with Lelah. The two hug each other tight ignoring the men in the room. \"Lelah,\" Jenny almost sighs the words from her place at Lelah's throat. She doesn't let go of Jenny but looks up from the blonde waves. \"I'd like a shower and a change of clothes.\" The men don't move. She sighs, exasperated. \"In that order, please.\" Nick laughs and wipes his face. \"Guess I owe you a drink after this.\" Lelah has to admit that Nick Morton could've chosen a worse pub. There are just enough people for background noise and not to scream their orders at the bar. The wooden floors and tables are so clean they sparkle in the light. Lelah takes in the red woods, the plush seats and the flat screen hooked to the top of the bar. The three of them can't look away from the screen. Lelah pales at the plane crash site. It's all crumbled metal, smoke and dying flames. The field ruined. The green grass is now burnt soil with smoke still rising. She takes in the still burning flames and the pieces of metal scattered everywhere. The whole area is a dead zone, and Lelah struggles to breathe for a moment. Jenny looks away to study Lelah's face. Lelah stares back. \"How did you get out of that plane?\" Nick leans forward raising his eyebrows. \"I didn't,\" Lelah muttered before stealing Nick's shot. \"Hey!\" Lelah ignores him making a face at the harsh burn. Nick chuckles slapping her back and pouring her another. \"I'm so happy you're alive,\" Jenny says reaching for Lelah's hand. She squeezes. \"I just don't see how. There's not a single scratch on your body.\" Lelah squeezes back. From behind Jenny, she sees the rotting Chris wink at her before disappearing. 'I don't think I am.' \"Can you get Lelah one of those fruity foo-foo drinks?\" Nick said shaking his empty glass. \"She can't handle whiskey.\" Jenny raises an eyebrow but Lelah nods her head quickly asking for some peanuts too. As she gets up, she gives Nick and Lelah a parting glare. Behave. They smile. It drops as soon as she's out of sight. Nick takes his last shot before playing with the empty glass. \"Why did you give the last parachute?\" Lelah stares back, impassive. \"You don't like me,\" he gives her a moment to speak. She doesn't. \"Why give me a chance to live? We argued all that day. You even said it was 'on sight'.\" Lelah's lips twitch. \"So why?\" She breathes. \"You saved her life,\" Lelah said nodding towards her best friend. \"Let's lie and say you would have done the same for me.\" She crosses her arms. Nick huffs. \"I was going to,\" he says looking at the table. \"The last time I saw you, you hugged me and threw me out of a plane.\" Lelah bites her cheek. \"I wanted to do that earlier,\" she says finally smiling. \"Whiskey and a Sex On The Beach,\" Jenny says sliding Lelah her drink. Lelah takes a sip almost choking when Chris Vail tips a hat to her and disappears. She can't possibly do this sober, so she doesn't. Every time Lelah sees Chris Vail, she drinks. Too soon, her drink is empty so she takes Nick's shots. They hit her quickly. She hiccups as she studies the bottom of the shot glass before gesturing to the bartender once more. Jenny shakes her head at the bartender. She moves her hand near her own neck waving it fingertips first. The bartenders nods. Lelah didn't even notice. Lelah hiccups staring unseeingly as Nick fills her glass with amber liquid. \"You wanna know why I do what I do?\" \"I've been having dreams about this girl since I was small,\" Lelah says with a toothy grin. \"I would shut my eyes and open them to a golden room with rich colors and precious metals. She is so beautiful in her white dresses. She teaches me how to throw a punch or mathematic. Sometimes we lay in bed talking for hours. It's not English but the language feels so natural. When I got older, I had dreams of us doing things in that bed,\" she finishes blushing. \"You're very gay,\" Nick deadpans. \"It's why I became an archaeologist,\" she stumbles over the word, laughing. \"The dreams appear to be Ancient Egyptian.\" Jenny interrupts, concerned. \"That's why we started to work together in university,\" she says looking at Lelah briefly who blinks. \"Listen, Nick. I think you should know what's going on. You know I work with a group of archaeologists including Lelah.\" Nick nods. \"Yeah.\" \"Well,\" Jenny looks at Lelah, \"We developed a theory that Ancient Egypt. Its people erased an Egyptian princess from the history books deliberately. We've been searching for something called 'The Dagger of Set'. A ceremonial knife with a large jewel at the hilt.\" Jenny turns toward Nick. \"Set is the Egyptian God of death,\" she pauses to take a breath.\" And legend has it that the dagger and the stone, together, had the power to give Set physical form. We're convinced it's here, hidden in Europe. Stolen by Crusaders centuries ago. Lelah found a manuscript that references it. A crusader knight wrote it, and it suggests someone broke the dagger and the stone apart. The stone, we believe, they buried with this knight somewhere here in England.\" \" A massive crusader tomb was recently discovered under London. We believe that the stone is down there. That tomb is what led us to Ahmanet.\" She pauses. \"I think she is the princess in the legend,\" Jenny hurries through. \"The hieroglyphics said that she murdered her father.\" \"Murdered?\" Jenny nods. \"Along with his child. She made some sort of pact with the God of death. And then, when I saw those birds... and that sandstorm...\" She trails off. \"Whatever. I mean something is happening,\" Nick agrees. \"She should be dead,\" Jenny says quietly glancing at Lelah still smiling at nothing. Nick looks at Lelah. \"I-I...\" Jenny touches his hand looking into his eyes. \"I'm sorry, Nick. I think we angered the Gods.\" She bites her lip. \"Lelah is not safe.\" Lelah blinks looking in their direction at the sound of her name. Chris's graying face and white eye sneer at Lelah before pointing to the girls' bathroom. Lelah jumps, stumbling to her feet. \"I have to go.\" Jenny watches her go, concerned. She pulls out her phone. \"It's Jennifer. Get me Henry.\" Lelah half runs into the bathroom slamming the door behind her. She turns on the faucet throwing ice cold water on her face. \"Are you done yet?\" Lelah jumps stumbling to dry her face. \"Listen, already,\" he sighs heavily. \"There's fates worse than death. We're that.\" Lelah stares at him in the mirror. \"We're cursed, Lelah.\" Lelah sighs itching her forehead with her middle finger. \"I get that I uncover ancient artifacts, but I don't believe in curses.\" Chris chuckles; his face is varying shades of gray some with parts almost purple. \"How do you think you survived the crash?\" He grins. \"Is it Setepai or Meritamen?\" Lelah bites her cheek. He smirks. \"We're cursed,\" he almost spits the word. \"And there is only one way to break it. You're going to do exactly what she wants or this is gonna get a lot worse for both of us.\" \"How can it get any worse for you? You're dead,\" she says pointing at him lazily, but the finger trembles. \"She wants you, Lelah.\" Lelah exhales through her nose. \"You can't run.\" \"You can't escape.\" \"I'd rather not do this alright,\" she says throwing her hands up before walking out the bathroom. Chris Vail shakes his head before disappearing. Lelah takes out her phone as she walks dialing the number by heart. It rings as she goes out the back-door Lelah looks both ways. She can't see anyone outside. She hears a police siren pass by and cautiously steps into the alley. The phone rings once more before going to voice mail. \"This is Dr. Jennifer Halsey. Please leave a message and I will reach you as possible.\" The voice mail begins, so Lelah speaks quickly. \"Jenny, I got to leave. Things are happening right now that I can't explain, and I think I've had too much to drink. I'm just going to your place to crash. I'll call an Uber or your British substitute. See you at home.\" She hangs up at the beep. Lelah chews her tongue a moment before she begins walking. 'It must be later than I thought,' she thinks vaguely. She steps hurriedly with the click of her heels echoing against the stone. Lelah looks around her as she walks. Lelah takes out her keys but keeps moving. She places the keys in the spaces between her fingers until it looks more Wolverine than an ordinary human. A low growl echoes from the dark of the alley. She turns her head squinting to make it out. A couple rats squeal racing along the asphalt. Lelah takes a few steps back. Whatever is there, growls deeper...harder. Lelah's mouth drops as she makes out the creature snarling low on the ground. It rises from a crouch. She makes out one leg...two. Its torso leans to one side as if the spine is broken. Another deep snarl vibrates it's chest causing the dirty layers around it. Five long bony fingers raise slowly to point at Lelah. She sprints in the opposite direction. Rats, leagues of rats in a perfect V formation give chase, as the creature's screeches follow. Lelah can't make a sound. She pounds on the doors so hard it sounds like thunder. No one answers so she keeps running. She runs until the ground beneath her moves. Lelah slams into the hard ground feeling tiny nails cling to her clothes...her skin. Lelah shrieks wildly punching with her Wolverine fist. Her shrill screams almost drown out the rats. The rats are too many but she keeps swinging...keeps stabbing...but she can't get up. Lelah fights to keep her eyes open. A dry brown face stares back at her. Empty sockets where eyes once more. It reaches out to her with loose bandages hanging from her arm. A bony finger trails down Lelah's face. \"My chosen,\" the words seem to tear it's throat as it speaks. \"My Meritamen.\" Lelah screams.[Chapter 5] Lelah shrieks. It rings through their ears like a death knell. Two bright lights race towards Lelah: never stopping. Jenny and Nick yank her to the safe side of the road. \"Get out of the road, wanker!\" The car barely dodges Lelah continuing to speed pass. \"Fuck off, motherfucker!\" Nick retorts not letting go of her shoulders. They stumble to the center to a circular field. Lelah shakes in Nick's arms: eyes glazed over. She can't breathe...can't stop moving. Jenny touches Lelah's forehead and her cheeks. Lelah doesn't react. \"What the hell do you think you are doing?!\" Lelah blinks breathing heavily. \"I-I-\" Lelah looks at Jenny then back to Nick. She's speechless. \"You gotta say something,\" Nick says and points at the road. \"Cause I need to know why I just saved your ass.\" Lelah sighs heavily. \"The curse,\" she says haltingly. \"It's real. It's so fucking real.\" Jenny draws back, biting her lip and shutting her eyes for a moment. \"The mummy...Ahmanet...she wants me and she's been sending Nick's friend to get me.\" Nick bites his cheek. \"You're telling me, Chris Vail, my best friend who I shot three times and killed, is working for the cursed mummy?\" \"I know I sound crazy,\" Lelah says staring right into Nick's eyes. \"But I woke up in the morgue with his white eye staring right at me.\" Nick narrows his eyes and stands up taller. \"How does he look?\" \"Dead,\" she says curtly. Jenny intervenes stepping between the two. She looks at Nick warily before turning back to Lelah. \"The doctor said you have a low-grade concussion,\" she says but Jenny won't look Lelah in her eyes. \"We've survived a plane crash. We saw many people die in front of us. We were exposed to liquid mercury. It's entirely possible you're hallucinating from such things. I know a doctor in London who can help-\" \"Don't switch up on her now,\" Nick retorts stepping closer. \"I'm not saying I believe she's seeing Chris. I think your 'angering the gods' comment,\" he says making quotation marks with his hands. \"-has her fucked up.\" \"I'm cursed,\" Lelah insists before saying quietly. \"I've seen Ahmanet. She calls me her chosen: setepai.\" Jenny pales. Nick swears quietly kicking the ground. \"You really need to see that doctor in London,\" Jenny says giving Lelah a concerned look. \"He can help you.\" Nick shakes his hand. \"She doesn't need a quack. She needs to see the mummy coffin herself.\" \"Sarcophagus.\" \"You two read the writing on the damn box. Wasn't there a curse?\" \"Sarcophagus,\" Jenny corrects loudly. \"The hieroglyphs did mention a curse. It said if Princess Ahmanet was removed from her prison, she'd take over the world with the power of Set: god of death.\" A warm hand trails down her spine. \"Come to me ,\" the feminine voice whispers behind her. Lelah closes her eyes, and dark eyes lined in black kohl and blue paint stare back. \"Nick is right,\" Lelah says opening her eyes. \"Jenny, you don't have to come. I need to see her, so I know this isn't real.\" Jenny gnaws her cheek before steeling herself. \"Then I'm going with you.\" The morning sky is still dark when they arrive near the crash site. The land is mostly green fields with an array of animals roaming freely. There are few buildings and even fewer homes. The fence's aged wood travels for miles on the dirt road. The country echoes with faint moose and distant helicopters. The three of them sink into the mud as soon as they step out the car. Cows loudly moo behind them, and their ride gives them no time to reconsider. The black cab pulls off in a hurry spitting mud in its wake. A helicopter flies by and smoke rises in the distance. Both Nick and Jenny look to one another: hesitant. Lelah wanders forward. \"Where the hell are you going? The crash is in the other direction.\" Jenny has to grab her arm for Lelah to stop moving. \"It's this way,\" Lelah says shaking off Jenny's grip. She continues going deeper into the dark. They wander under the ruins before someone speaks again. \"I'm not doing this with you,\" Jenny whispers. \"This isn't where the plane crashed.\" \"She crashed with the plane. I think she knows where she's going.\" Nick walks side by side with Jenny occasionally knocking her shoulders. \"This isn't where my artifact is,\" she contradicts harshly. \"The plane didn't crash here and I'm going after my artifact. If you still have any sense, you'll follow.\" Jenny goes left, and Nick follows with a guilty shrug before he leaves. \" Meritamen...Meritamen... .\" Lelah stills at the chorus of whispers. An odd growl echoes through space. Lelah looks up but there's nothing there. Her eyes dart from the ceilings to the floors in the rocky remains. She finds nothing but soil and pebbles. A light goes by as the helicopter searches for more bodies. A door loudly creaks behind her. Swiftly, Lelah turns. A body stands in the doorway. Dusty bandages hang limply from their slender frame. She makes out an arm raising: fingers pointed directly at her. The head tilts, calling her near, and Lelah can make out a ponytail moving with the motion. The ruins melt into the Egyptian desert. Ahmanet reaches for Lelah slightly crooking her fingers. Her almost black eyes pin Lelah to the floor. Lelah swallows as Ahmanet's pink lips linger on the word: \" Setepai ,\" she whispers. Lelah blinks and takes a step back, stunned. She stands in the aisle with wide eyes. Moonlight paints the whole room in blacks and grays. On either side, pews line on each side. An altar lays only a few feet in front of her: stone covered in aged cloth. An angel watches over the altar with her hands folded in prayer. 'This isn't good.' Lelah turns toward the door. It slams shut. Lelah blinks and turns her back to the pews. \"This is not happening.\" She can hear something moving inside. \"No,\" she says softly. \"No. Nope. Not happening.\" Lelah studies the room for any exits. There is a dark hallway guarded by Grecian arches. 'I'm not that stupid.' She races to the door slamming into it back first. She winces keeping her back unexposed. \"This isn't happening.\" Something scrapes against the floor. Lelah pulls on the door. It won't open. Something moves again, and Lelah turns toward the sound. \"Nick?\" Something shuffles along the floor. \"Jenny?\" Something drags heavily. She whispers the last closing her eyes and heart racing. \"Ahmanet.\" She opens her eyes. Lelah stills. Even undead, Ahmanet is beautiful. Her skin is gray almost blue in this light. Her high cheekbones are still missing skin in some places. Even her nose, a proud nose missing half its side, still didn't take away from her face. Words raised like scars line her forehead and her cheeks traveling low down her neck. Four irises, four pupils: 'pupila duplex' Lelah surmises. \" Setepai .\" Her stare glues Lela to the floor. Her face is impassive almost empty if she didn't study Lelah so earnestly. Ahmanet smiles slowly dipping her head. Her long fingers clutch at the flesh of Lelah's waist. Lelah gasps, her chest rising to meet Ahmanet's. Ahmanet's grin only widens before she jumps. Lelah loses her breath with the movement. She clutches Ahmanet's broad shoulders as they almost fly across the room. Ahmanet never looks away from Lelah. 'Her holding me should not feel so familiar...' They land on the altar. 'She's stronger than she looks...\" Ahmanet softly pushes her body to lay on the altar. Still, Lelah's head thuds slightly on the stone. Ahmanet stays on Lelah, a leg on each side of her hips and a devilish grin on her lips. She takes Lelah's limp arms and presses them above Lelah's head with little effort. Lelah's breathing picks up. Ahmanet turns her head before leaning down further. \" Meritamen, I have missed you so ,\" she murmurs against Lelah's cheek almost mouthing the tan skin. Ahmanet lets go of Lelah's wrists. Something dry latches on instead. Lelah looks up: eyes blown. The zombie yells in Lelah's face; its leathered skin cracking with the movement. Lelah screams. Slim fingers rub against the length of her cheek. Lelah looks back to Ahmanet. \" They won't hurt you, my Chosen. I won't allow it .\" Her hands drift from Lelah's cheek to the soft her neck, the swell of her chest, and the flat of her belly. Swiftly, Ahmanet pushed Lelah's tee over her chest. She caresses the soft curve of Lelah's belly even tracing the faint scars. She grips Lelah's hips for a split moment before rising to Lelah's chest. Ahmanet moans softly at the exposed skin before nuzzling her face in Lelah's chest. 'Second base!' her mind screams.'That's second base!' Her face is cold where it touches Lelah's skin. \" Your heart calls for me still ,\" Ahmanet says settling deeper into her chest pressing hard. \" Meritamen ,\" Ahmanet murmurs. \" I have missed you much my Queen .\" Lelah struggles to breathe. \"I-I-don't understand.\" Lelah's eyes widen as Ahmanet comes closer. \" You will. This will hurt for a moment ,\" Ahmanet says mouthing a last kiss on her cheek. Ahmanet sits up straight in a fluid motion. She squeezes the angel's head leaving small puffs of white dust in the air. Minuscule bits of dried clay miss Lelah's face. Her skeletal fingers grasp the hilt slowly moving the dagger from its resting place. Lelah bucks. Ahmanet only rolls her hips into the motion as the undead tighten their grip on her wrists and ankles. \" God of Death ,\" she cries out. \" Mighty Set. I welcome you in this mortal body you gifted me. She will bear you into this world ,\" Ahmanet raises the dagger slowly. \" Join me at last .\" There is a gust of air as the dagger strikes. Lelah shuts her eyes tight. Nothing happens. She opens her eyes. Ahmanet hovers over her, silent and focused. The point of the dagger is centimeters from breaking skin. Lelah lays very still. She sees Ahmanet stare at the hilt, incredulous. Her thumb...it's in a hole. Ahmanet seethes steadily as a silent snarl forms on her lips. The gasp echoes through the room. \"Oh shi-\" All heads all turn to the church door. Jenny and Nick stand at the entrance open mouthed. Jenny's mouth opens, closes and opens again as she struggles for words. Her eyes dart from the woman on top of Lelah, the creatures holding her down and the dagger close to her belly. Nick's fingers betray him as the flash of his phone brightens the room before dying. Ahmanet glares at the couple before turning back to Lelah. Her skin tingles from Ahmanet's stare. Lelah looks away from the two to stare back at Ahmanet. She swallows harshly stuck in place by her amber eyes. \"Idiots?\" She calls out softly. Nick sounds breathless when he answers. \"Sup?\" \"Run,\" she croaks. . Ahmanet's face darkens. She stabs the alter inches away from Lelah's hand before leaping in front of Jenny and Nick. The zombie loosens his grip. Without missing a beat, Lelah bucks her hips kicking wildly at the mummy rescue workers at her feet. One loses his head stumbling blind. She grabs the zombie near her hand by the neck slamming him into the altar until the head breaks. Lelah coughs gagging to herself. She takes the dagger stabbing the one on her right. Its high pitched squeals ring through her ears as she struggles to break it a part. A pair of arms tightly grasps her wrist pulling her off the table. She shrieks, dropping the knife and clawing at the bark-like arms surrounding her. Something heavy and screaming flies into her back. It sends her sprawled across the altar. Lelah coughs before looking behind her. Nick lays there, stunned, legs spread open. Sluggishly, a cute along his forehead bleeds. He looks back at her eyes screaming 'Did you see that shit?' Lelah nods her head numbly. 'He was at the door a second ago. How the hell-' Something moves out of the corner of her eye. Lelah turns to see it. Ahmanet stands there with a proud back and a fond smirk pulling at her lips. Her eyes dart around the altar. The creature with a head hanging by a thread walks in place continually hitting the wall. At the foot of the altar, a body grasps wildly at the air with the head a couple feet away. Lelah follows her eyes silently counting. Her eyes widen. Nick sees one before she does. He rises to his feet. Already, she hears his disgusted groans as a mummy breaks. Punches...kicks...whatever, they weren't built to last. Tough fingers grab her skirt. Lelah turns with the motion pushing him into the altar. She fists the back of his shirt ramming and kicking him into the stone. The creature can't make a sound but echoes through her ears. Ahmanet watches silently. Her stare warms Lelah's skin. She doesn't look behind her amid the kicks and pushes. She doesn't have to. She feels Ahmanet's fixation like a hot flame. Head turned, she can almost see her lips curl, and knows that Ahmanet is coming closer like a magnet. An odd feeling spreads in her chest: warm, natural even, but wholly unfamiliar. \"Run!\" Lelah stops at the ear-splitting scream. She turns just in time to see Ahmanet stumble a single step. She scowls before looking behind her. Jenny stands there white and speechless. In a single move, Ahmanet snatches Jenny pushing her hard against a pillar. Jenny's white sneakers kick vainly weakening with each second. She squeezes Jenny's throat just enough to leave her breathless and leans in for a deadly kiss. \"Ahmanet!\" She jerks away at her name. Instinctively, she turns to Lelah. The double irises burn gold in the cold of the room. Lelah shakes her head wildly hair waving goodbye with the motion. Ahmanet's fingers loosen slightly on Jenny's throat. Abruptly, her body curls. Ahmanet's inhuman screech echoes off the walls. The black hilt sticks out her back. Nick stands behind her and pushes her roughly to the side. Lelah's eyes follow the moment. \"RUN!\" His shout brings her back. Jenny yanks out the dagger ignoring her screams, and they head for the door. Lelah looks back. Ahmanet stares back breathing harshly. She half lays on the floor with an arm clutching her back. Her face is cold, but her eyes hurt. She watches Lelah: her eyes brimming with betrayal and hurt. A part of Lelah breaks at the sight. As her run slows, Jenny literally pushes her to go faster. Nick heads for the ambulance. Like an Olympian, he jumps the fence easily and sprints inside. He doesn't wait for them. Instead, he steadily speeds up forcing them to catch up. Jenny screams his name. Lelah doesn't. She waits until they're close enough before throwing Jenny inside. Last, Lelah leaps inside banging into hard plastics and metal. \"Were you just gonna leave us there?\" Jenny shouts. Nick glanced at her before looking back at the road. \"I didn't race off,\" he justifies. \"She saved you from certain death on that plane, and you were still going to leave.\" \"Did you not see me get thrown into a mummy holding her hostage? You saw that, right?\" \"You were gonna leave us!\" \"You saw it, right?\" Nick repeats. \"I can't unsee it!\" \"There's a highway near here,\" Lelah speaks up. \"Don't ask how but there is.\" As Nick drives, Lelah looks at the Dagger of Set in Jenny's lap. \"Do you realize what this is?\" Jenny asks gesturing to the dagger. \"It's the knife that almost killed your friend.\" \"Go here and take a right, \" Lelah quietly says. \"How was it in a statue?\" Nick says following her instructions. \"That statue was a reliquary. Crusaders would use them to hide holy relics.\" Lelah interrupts. \"Ahmanet knew it was there,\" she says an odd dream-like quality to her voice. \"You're saying she brought the plane down on purpose?\" Jenny gasps. \"That's why she wanted you to come to the church.\" \"We,\" Nick emphasizes. \"wanted to go to see where the mummy was. Not the church.\" \"It still brought us to her,\" Lelah concludes. \"We wanted to see her corpse.\" \"I needed to see her corpse.\" The word sickens her. \"Lelah, she's in your head.\" Nick chuckles sarcastically. \"That's funny. I could've sworn she told us that after I saved her ass from getting ran over.\" The car suddenly stops. All three heads shoot up. A heavy fog weighs heavily on the ground. It almost masks the church standing dark and dead in the back. In the middle, Ahmanet stalks toward them with all the time in the world. Her braid still lays over her shoulder, bandaged unruffled. Ahmanet grins smugly. Her eyes never move from Lelah's. 'I really shouldn't find this attractive. She just tried to kill me and I'm trying not to drool. This is so messed up.' No one moves for a long moment. \"You drove us back to her.\" \"I don't drive,\" Lelah excuses herself. \"You're American! How can you not drive?!\" \"Something about my body being thrown out of a vehicle takes the fun out of driving. Can we talk about this later?\" Ahmanet takes a relaxed step toward the car still smirking. Lelah's heart misses a beat. \"Fuck.\" The tires squeal as they peel away. Jenny screams. Lelah screams. The corpses scream. One bursts through the passenger door hovering on Jenny's lap. Its' fingers stretch to Lelah's seat in the middle. Another hurls itself into the front window shrieking in Lelah's face. She grabs it digging into the dry cords of its neck. Lelah smashes the head against the dashboard. Once. Twice. The third time it explodes into dry dirt, and Lelah throws the rest of his body out the window. \"LELAH! NICK!\" She turns her head. Jenny leans away from the creature failing to push it out the window. Lelah grabs its shoulders. Wildly, she headbutts it. Lelah punches it repeatedly. \"Not my face, Lelah!\" \"Push, Jenny!\" The car swerves to the left. It's bottom half smashes off The ambulance veers right. They scream. It rolls. Something pulls Lelah out. She hovers in the air. Jenny and Lelah lock eyes. Nick is speechless. Her body sucks out the window and rolls to the side of the crash. One. Two. Three. When her body stops, the ambulance keeps going. Jenny's screams and Nick's curses echo through the forest. The thuds stop. \"Guys?\" Lelah calls out her head spinning. She pats herself down: no bruises and no blood. Moist soil clings to her jeans. There's a tear on her thigh and a couple rips in her tee. She stomps through the forest. \"Shitfuck!\" Nick's voice echoes in the wood. Lelah jumps off the small ledge. She crouches to check on them. Nick glares at the dashboard. He struggles with his seatbelt before it gives way. Lelah quickly reaches out dulling the approaching face plant. She lets go quickly wiping her bloody fingers on her jeans. \"Are you seriously hurt?\" \"We're fine,\" Jenny says. She goes to the other side. Lelah looks in watching Jenny unclick herself and land in a crouch. \"I'm so glad your-\" Familiar warmth travels down her spine. A mist starts to settle on the ground. \"Jenny, take Nick and get out of here,\" Lelah says tersely staring at the far away figure. \"Where are we supposed to go? What about the dagger?\" Lelah gives Jenny a look. \"Away from the creature trying to kill you.\" She rises taking long strides to meet her. Ahmanet saunters. Her long legs are precise with their every step. No movement is wasted. Head high and brow tight in focus, the mist is her cape: the world her throne. She stops at Lelah's feet. Ahmanet's fingers trail Lelah's cheek. Lelah closes her eyes. 'Run,' she silently pleads wishing she could look back. 'Run.' \" I will always find you ,\" Ahmanet says firmly. Her hand cups Lelah's cheek. She smiles smugly. \" You cannot hide...can not run from me, Meritamen .\" Someone's footsteps break twigs and leaves. Lelah starts to look behind her. Abruptly, Ahmanet stops her. Instead, she leans in close to Lelah's ear. Her cool breath makes Lelah shiver. \" You were mine then ,\" she whispers and takes Lelah waist with one hand. \" You are mine now. Not hers, not his...mine ,\" Ahmanet briefly nips at her earlobe. Lelah jumps, eyes closed and knees suddenly weak. Something cracks. Something flies. It lands in a pained wheeze. Lelah's eyes shoot open. She turns her head. Nick lays on the ground staring blankly at something. Jenny. Lelah starts to run. Ahmanet is already there. She leans in close. Amber eyes study the woman in front of her. Long wavy blonde hair, wide blue eyes in terror, and Jenny's skin pale from the recent accident. Ahmanet's eyes narrow. She tilts her head eyes gleaming- A sharp pain brings Lelah to her knees. Their shrieks echo through the wood. Lelah watches the barbs crying out as each one settles deeper into Ahmanet's skins. Their screeches stop hearts. Lelah's stops. Ahmanet's doesn't. Author's Note: Thank you for the reviews, follows and favorites! I appreciate it all and those who sent ideas![Chapter 6] The lights flicker in the dead of night casting shadows against the golden walls. Two figures fight on the walls with their hair fanning around them at every turn. One is tall and slender: her moves sure as she swiftly bends away from a dagger's strike or lunges with her own. The smaller shadow meets each exchange edging away from its sharp pierce. She never lunges but defends matching each lunge with barely seconds to spare. There is no competition. The taller figure hits her wrist with a flat hand. The dagger thuds to the ground. In the middle of the room, Meritamen stays in place. A bronze dagger scarcely a shade darker than her skin presses against her throat. Meritamen looks down briefly; she stops as the cold metal digs slightly in. A smile slowly grows across her face. Dark eyes dart to the soft of Meritamen's neck, the red lips parted in a smile, and her heaving chest. Ahmanet drops the dagger roughly pulling Meritamen into a kiss. Her hands dig into Meritamen's hair not pulling but holding. While one hand loses itself in Meritamen's hair, the other grabs wildly: the thin material of her dress, the hot of her skin, and the addictive moans that vibrate Meritamen's throat. Ahmanet can't stay still, can't let go of her Meritamen, and Meritamen hugs her just as close. With a wistful sigh, Meritamen draws back, lips red as wine and struggling for breath. Ahmanet turns her attention to the bronze of her neck. She nips at the pulse that jumps for her attention. She sucks at the salt of her skin. Meritamen eyes flutter closed at the attention. She turns her head exposing more skin. Meritamen grins softly as she feels Ahmanet's lips spread. The soft lips drag against her skin so sweetly. Meritamen allows the action keeping a hand on the nape of Ahmanet's neck. Her eyes stay closed when Meritamen speaks. \"Perhaps he will have another daughter.\" Sharply, Ahmanet withdraws. The movement is oddly fluid even as she tenses. Brown eyes, nearly black, never move away from Meritamen's form. Her cheekbones stand out in stark relief from the sneer that cages them. Ahmanet doesn't blink and barely appears to breathe. She glowers: a burning look promising death and destruction to all in her way. Her Meritamen could never feel the flames. Meritamen opens her eyes smiling brightly. She ignores Ahmanet's scowl instead softly touching her cheeks. Immediately, Ahmanet's sneer fades. Her jaw unclenches lips settling into a small pout. Meritamen rubs the soft skin of her cheek with her thumb, and she can't help leaning into the comfort of Meritamen's touch. Slowly the black in Ahmanet's fiery brown eyes fades like a fire drawn back to its hearth. \"You are Pharaoh,\" Meritamen promises. Her hands still hold Ahmanet's cheeks. Yet as she kisses the corner of Ahmanet's mouth, Ahmanet pushes herself closer. \"I will enjoy raising her with us,\" Meritamen continues. She moves a hand to press a second, deeper kiss, to Ahmanet's skin. \"It'll be like raising another you. The Pharaoh is old and never sired sons before. Think of this as an opportunity. When he falls, your sister will be your heir...our heir,\" Meritamen's smile crinkles her eyes until they almost disappear. \"No male needed.\" Ahmanet closes her eyes for a moment. She opens them: the warrior is gone, princess hid, but Ahmanet's softness. \"I am so tired of waiting,\" she whispers. She leans close to Meritamen past her eyes to nip her earlobe. \"I want Egypt,\" her voice deepens.\" I want you.\" Ahmanet nuzzles into Meritamen's neck. \"I want my queen,\" Ahmanet rasps. She mouths her neck...her clavicle. Meritamen exhales shakily pulling Ahmanet closer as the shoulders of her dress fall to the floor. Lelah comes to slowly: eyes fluttering open. She opens her eyes to a new world of metal. Blurry eyed, Lelah blinks once, twice and again waiting for the slate grey walls to go back to gold. They don't. Instead the van's metal walls rattle through her ears, and her body trembles as the vehicle races on the road. Even as Lelah's body shakes, she never falls off her prison. Thick black material wraps tightly around Lelah's frame securing her to the metal pallet built in the van. Lelah tries and fails to calm down. ' Is this how Ahmanet felt stuck in that sarcophagus?' the thought crosses Lelah's mind, unbidden. ' Worse ,' a voice similar to her own answers. Lelah shuts her eyes to think. There Lelah sees...Lelah. She is lighter: more olive than tan with a body thinner from a world of no labor. Two thick straps curved over her shoulders exposing her décolletage as the thin material dropped to her ankles. Wine red lips watched Lelah warmly as her blood-red fingertips caressed Lelah's face. Meritamen smiles at her reincarnation. \"We could not save her in the last life,\" she says staring earnestly into new copper brown eyes. \"Save her in this one.\" She leans into Lelah pressing soft lips against her cheek before disappearing as Lelah's eyes open. Chris Vail's glossy white eye stares back at her. Lelah chokes on her own scream. His skin is fading rotting darker shades of grey and black. In some places, his face is already peeling revealing the muscle underneath. A single dark brown eye watches Lelah almost sadly as she gags. \"I'm aging like milk. I get it,\" Vail says quickly stepping away from her frame. \"Some of us aren't so lucky when we get brought back. Some of us aren't dead but aren't alive. This is what happens.\" He gestures to his decaying body. Lelah stops herself from doing just that. She stares at the floor instead. \"Do us both a favor. Stop running. Would it be so bad to live for eternity with your soulmate? To be the queen of the planet? To fulfill your last life's dying wish?\" The grey light from the window disappears. Her world blackens. She can't see him at all but still feels both of his eyes focus on her. Lelah shivers. \"Time's up.\" He leaves as a wisp of smoke as the van doors open. Four men covered neck to toe in black rush into the van. They storm in; their stomps echo on metal with clangs ringing through Lelah's ears. The men swarm around her with a man at each corner of her prison. They move as a single unit. One moment, each stand silently watching her. In the next moment, a mass of arms push and pull at her body. The restraints give in seconds clanging to the ground. She wastes no time. Lelah kicks wildly: the navy of her jeans black in the dark of the van. Her long legs are near invisible in the air missing men by centimeters. Where her legs fail, Lelah's arms do not. She grabs one smashing his face into the hard metal slab and pushing another just as quickly into the cage behind her. Lelah slams it shut. Another pair of hands grabs her waist tightly and lifts. For a moment, Lelah just dangles in the air like a kitten in its mother's grasp. Then, Lelah loses it. She swings her head, frenzied, and it smashes into his nose. Once. Twice. Then something cracks. The man behind her screams dropping her instinctively to grab his bleeding nose. Lelah's body thuds when it hits the ground. Her head bounces on the ground once...twice. She lays there stunned. Limp, Lelah is pulled over a Goliath's shoulder. She hangs like a child's rag doll: denim a stark contrast to the black armor. The men pull a black bag over her face and start to move. They march in unison. Single file, one man guards the front and two at the back. The two others drag Nick out in a hold with a matching black cloth over his face. Like a funeral procession, they carry Lelah and Meritamen to their final resting place. Dazed, Lelah's body bounces with Goliath's every step. She can't think; Her head aches beating in time with her heart. Lelah's whole body hurts. Lelah can't explain it, but in some places it feels like she was shot... Like something ripped right through her. Adrenaline gone, Lelah feels it all and moans. Unbidden, a dangerous purr echoes through her ears low and deadly. Lelah's eyes open. Lightning swift, she raises her arm. Goliath doesn't notice; he steadily marches in sync with his peers. She flexes her arm aiming it at the back of his skull. He falls. Hard. Midfall, Lelah reaches out. One of the men takes her by the wrists like a makeshift chain. She wiggles her fingers before digging them into his eyelids: deep but without fingernails. He screams, and the other guard drops Nick. He pulls Lelah off tugging harshly at her middle until his comrade's head finally drops. Nick sucker punches the guard shaking his hand as the body falls to the ground. The room is a mess of groans and cries. For a single moment, Nick and Lelah stare at one another. His forehead is bruising an ugly violet with a break in the skin scabbed mid-ooze. His lip is split, yet Nick's eyes check Lelah for wounds. Her body is bloody and bruised. Various parts of her skin are darkening a sickening purple from the restraints. A couple parts of her shirt are bloody: random bleeding points though she can't remember being shot. They nod to another and run. Within the hour, guards carry their bodies. She's surrounded. Two guards hold her this time; each man holds an arm. Easily, she hovers a couple feet above the ground. Her legs kick the air wildly: too short to touch the ground. Lelah can't even see Nick at this point. The men all walk in a state of disarray. Some have black eyes, some bleeding, but all of them have ripped suits. Eventually, the brigade stops. They enter a study or office of sorts. Bookcases filled to the brim align almost every wall in reds and browns. There is a dark almost black desk waiting at the other end of the room. It's spacious with thick beige columns and floor to roof length windows with reinforced glass. There is only one obvious way in or out. She is sufficiently trapped. The men lower Lelah and Nick to the ground limping and locking the door with a final click. A middle-aged man waits in the center of the room holding two folders. His arms are in front of himself tightly entwined. He's dressed in a black business suit that's almost blue under the lights. He readjusts his gold-framed glasses before speaking. \"I'm sorry you received such a welcome. We weren't expecting such a violent greeting.\" You kidnap someone and expect gratitude? \"Perhaps you should send an invitation next time,\" Lelah replies blandly before settling in a small chair nearby. She grabs a bottle of chilled wine off the table beside her. Lelah holds the bottle to her aching head unamused. \"Who are you?\" The man turns to Nick. He jumps between the two biting his cheek. \"I'm a doctor,\" he continues despite Nick's snort. \"Chemical pathology, neurosurgery. Fellow of the Royal Society.\" The doctor stops for a breath. \"I'm also a lawyer.\" Lelah snickers but when he turns to her, her face smooths. \"My name is Jekyll. Dr. Henry Jekyll.\" Henry glances at Lelah pointedly. \"Make yourself comfortable.\" Hard to do that when my head has a heartbeat. Henry walks over to Lelah's seat. He kneels to look her in the eyes. Fingernails digging into the soft cloth, her face has no reaction to his proximity. Instead, she holds the bottle ever tighter. Henry gives her a brief smile. \"In theory, I know all about you.\" Lelah stares blankly at him. \"Lelah Fidelis Rene.\" At that, Nick snickers but quickly hushes when she turns her head in his direction. \"American. Egyptologist, archeologist. Jennifer raved about your study on the linguistics of Ancient Egypt for your Master's qualification.\" Lelah's mouth twitches. \"I found your thesis on same-sex relationships in Ancient Egypt very enlightening.\" He tilts his head raising an eyebrow still grinning. Henry stops when Lelah doesn't react turning to Nick instead. \"And you,\" he continues less than enthused. \"Army reconnaissance, a decorated soldier,\" Nick drops the files on his desk. \"and page after page indicating a deep and troubling moral turpitude.\" He looks between the two quickly. \"But, you see, this file contains nothing of any real value to me.\" Henry walks back to Lelah's seat. \"Miss Rene,\" he says offering an arm to Lelah. She takes it warily eyeing it in distrust. \"Mr. Morton,\" he nods at Nick to follow. As they get closer, Lelah's body tenses further. She ignores the thuds of their footsteps and Henry's grip on her arm. Lelah can only focus on pain. Its dull pangs trudge through her body: unfamiliar. Lelah's stomach curdles as stifled groans start to echo though her ears. They're high-pitched: almost palpable in its agony. Lelah and the others enter quietly. The room is near empty; computers to the right and multiple stairways that lead to other levels. The entire room is metal and concrete with harsh greys and black. In the center of it all is Ahmanet. The heir is forced to her knees; her arms are held together tightly behind her back and raised by a chain. The chains link to a collar around her throat, night against the dust of her skin, and silver tubes connect to the collar. The inky ponytail graces the floor as Ahmanet's body shivers holding in her cries. Her head suddenly lifts; the amber eyes glow. Her hitched breaths cease as she takes in Lelah. She takes in the blooming bruises in thick symmetrical lines along her arms. Lelah's forehead is a mottled mess of reds and blacks: an adept cloud of fire. The once light denim jacket is stained with blood, her blood, and a rusty maroon.. One..two..three holes at least are rusty with slight trails of blood as if someone shot Lelah through and through. A harsh growl echoed through the room: low and deadly. They don't say a word. They don't have to. The two cannot look away from each other. Lelah runs from Henry's side tearing her arm out of his grasp. She goes to Ahmanet automatically sinking to her knees. Her eyes frantically dart along Ahmanet's body.. 'There's no blood,' Lelah reminds herself examining the ancient cloth. 'There's holes but no wounds...nothing.' A low moan escapes Ahmanet's lips as she leans toward Lelah. Her eyes are a odd combination: furious and full of unspoken fear. Her eyes never stray from the holes on the bloody jacket as if she could burn the fabric through her stare alone. Lelah tilts her head, hair swinging with the movement, before unbuttoning the ruined fabric. The jacket takes forever to drop. The room quiets. There on the dingy fabric is her clotted blood but no wounds. There are circular rips in the undershirt as if something with barbs tore through skin and muscle before ripping out her back. There are thin trails almost purple now in color. Through the holes, all anyone can see is smooth tan skin. Ahmanet's head drops as she nuzzles into Lelah ignoring the witnesses behind them. Her whole body shivers harshly before abruptly stilling. Lelah's body trembles, yet she doesn't move away. One hand caresses Ahmanet's hair removing old bandages and webs while the other creates designs along Ahmanet's back. Ahmanet relaxes in the show of comfort, but her eyes... They stare behind Lelah's shoulder smoldering with a dark promise. You will pay for this. A large hand digs into Lelah's shoulder almost dragging her away. Chains rattling,Ahmanet follows the movement but until she's forced back. She seethes as Henry gently forces Lelah to her feet, and Nick stands there waiting with a protective grip around her waist. Ahmanet growls low, but it ends in a keen as the mercury travels turns to run to her, but Nick only holds Lelah tighter. Henry quirks his head at their reaction before he steps firmly in front of Ahmanet blocking Lelah's view. There Henry stands tall in his three-piece suit with a grave look in his cold eyes. \"Welcome to Prodigium.\" \"From the Latin monstrum vel prodigium ,\" he pauses sweeping the room with a cursory glance. His blue eyes linger on Lelah's. \" A Warning to Monsters.\" Over Henry's shoulders, Nick flinches at Ahmanet's tortured form. She does not scream...refuses to beg. Instead, her lithe frame convulses with her silent shrieks. Her muscles tremble in the metal's grip. Ahmanet's eyes never leave Lelah despite the piercing pain within them. \"What are you doing to her?\" Nick ambles past Ahmanet opening her to Lelah's sight. \"We're embalming her with mercury. At minus thirty-eight degrees, the mercury in her veins will solidify. She will be safe for dissection then.\" The three are silent in their horror. \"I apologize for our lack of decorum,\" Henry rambles on. \"We had very little time to prepare for our guest and only the information Jenny could provide for us.\" He moves behind Jenny tucking her hair in an almost paternal gesture. \"In truth, she works for us. It's not an exact science, this business.\" Nick bites his cheek crossing his arms. \"Business?\" Henry doesn't react yet clarifies. \"Evil.\" Jenny turns to Henry. Her body is relaxed, but her lip trembles in an almost plea. Her blue eyes stay glued on his: wide and beseeching. Her brow wrinkles deeply at his plan of action. \"Henry, this isn't the way I wanted us to study her. She is witness to a world we barely even know. To do that is not a dissection. Ahmanet is alive; that is vivisection.\" Henry's tone gentles seeing Jenny in such duress. \"It's for the greater good, Jenny. I am sorry. She is the most ancient evil we have and will ever witness. We cannot allow her or her God to destroy this world.\" This hypocritical piece of shit. Lelah's body stiffens in Nick's grasp. \"Cut the bulshit,\" Lela interrupts. \"Can we not ignore how unethical this really is?\" Henry turns dramatically face tensing in righteous wonder and anger. \"You believe evil should destroy this world?\" Lelah straightens, back rod straight. In an instant, the air becomes heavy...static. Something powerful races through her veins...familiar yet not. Her lips curl, copper colored eyes wild, and in that instant she is no longer an archaeologist. She is a queen. \"I believe in the Geneva Conventions,\" she says seething. \"You remember that, don't you? Or, do you only remember the laws that benefit you? You can't preach to me about monsters when I'm staring at one down right now. Dissection? DISSECTION?!\" Lelah turns to Jenny. Her countenance remains unchanged, but there's a seething betrayal that lights Jenny on fire from the inside out. The blonde avoids Lelah's eyes staring at the cold concrete instead. It doesn't save her. \"I can't believe you,\" Lelah almost spits. \"You used my work to do this?\" Henry walks into Lelah's space. His face is smooth and almost plastically calm. He takes her by the shoulders in an attempt to force them into eye to eye contact. She doesn't budge forcing him to crouch to meet her eyes. There's an odd pain in his face from the movement, but Lelah remains unmoved. His voice is gentle almost paternal in his attempt to guide Lelah. \"Come with us. Allow me to explain.\" Lelah looks back at him. \"People in hell want ice water. Do you see me getting them something to drink?\" She storms past him returning to Ahmanet's side. \" Furious, he clears the floor stomping back to his own office. Lelah hears everyone get back to work and silently waits under Ahmanet's eyes. When she hears Nick and Jenny leave, she makes her move. Lelah crouches moving closer to Ahmanet's body until her face is hidden from the camera. Her thick curly hair falls into her face hiding both Ahmanet and Lelah from view. Their foreheads touch, waves and tendrils meeting again after centuries apart, and Lelah closes her eyes in remembrance. Ahmanet feels different, frozen, but somehow the fire inside is the same. The two stay there eye closed. \" I hate seeing you in pain ,\" Ahmanet whispers to her chosen. \" They will pay for this, I promise you .\" \" Ahmanet, I promise you he will pay for this ,\" Lelah turns allowing their noses to touch. They both open their eyes: one sincere and the other troubled. \" I won't let you stay in here. I promise .\" ","Summary":" I sing a tale that begins in the eons past in a time of kings, queens and gods.

This is the story of a determined princess, a lost sergeant, and a curious archaeologist. The princess, the sergeant, and the archaeologist. Brought together by a quest at least five-thousand years in the making... When she receives word of the location of an antiquity long searched for, Doctor Elerie Taylor doesn't expect to be reunited with her ex-husband, the arrogant and stubborn Nick Morton. Nor does she expect that they'll unleash an ancient mummified princess on a quest, or that the mummy will possess Nick. Elerie always believed in myth, magic, and the supernatural, but never did she think she would be caught right at the centre of it... Hello everyone! :) welcome to my latest story, based off of 'The Mummy' 2017! I hope you enjoy! I do not own 'The Mummy' - all rights to Universal and the creators! I only own my character, Elerie. She kind of takes Jenny's place as Nick's companion throughout the story, though Jenny will still be present and I'll try to make Elerie different and not just Jenny's 'replacement'. I've given her and Nick more of a backstory/past connection, which maybe will help justify his end sacrifice a little more (I was kind of confused about the extent of his and Jenny's past relationship in the movie). Thanks![Chapter 2] Ahmanet's Threat \"You stand between My Chosen and me.\" \"How?\" \"You know how... You have curiosity. You wish to know what lies beyond the veil of death? The secrets of what I have seen?\" \"Yes.\" \"And you will find out - when I kill you. You stand between My Chosen One and me, and you must go...\"[Chapter 3] Hello! Here's the first chapter, hope you enjoy! :) I. Elerie Doctor Elerie Taylor had always been drawn to the 'otherworldly' the beyond, had always felt its pull. She believed wholeheartedly in the supernatural and had been searching for answers her whole life. A couple-hundred years ago she would have probably been called a witch and burned at the stake for her doings, investigating spells and rituals, visiting mystical sights. Her ex-husband, when they were still together, used to jokingly call her a witch as she 'meddled with magic'. She'd always had this strange sensation when visiting places of the past - a strong feeling of presence other than the life around her. Who then, was it she sensed? What was it? The dead? Perhaps. Either way she had always felt a strong connection to the ancients. It was hard to explain, but basically she summarized it as having some sort of reassurance that there was something more, something beyond. Could she speak with ghosts? No, but she could sense them, their presence. That of civilizations and worlds long since passed. But despite possessing this 'gift', she still had many questions and not enough answers. Following her divorce she hadn't gone out into the field much, leaving that to her colleagues, who would go conduct the excavations and digs and then bring the findings back to the museum to be examined - besides, she had always been a bit against removing the items from their hiding or burial places. They had been put there for a reason, why disrupt it? She worked as an archaeologist through the Natural History Museum in London. Some may think that someone like her, so deeply engaged in the supernatural, myths, and magic, wouldn't be working at a museum of natural history, a place of scientific fact. But it was from there that she could conduct her investigations, alongside her friend and colleague Doctor Halsey. The strange 'gift' of hers had helped lead them to some of the greatest findings of their careers - ancient manuscripts covered in spells and symbols, slabs of broken stone bearing carved rituals. All with connections to something beyond, and once fully examined Jenny would take them to her department of 'special collections'. Now here they were, all the way in Iraq, searching for what could be their greatest find yet. Finding the lost tomb of an ancient cursed princess whose existence had tried to be erased would prove everything she believed, prove there really was something else. Below them stretched seemingly endless desert. As the helicopter neared the golden ground, the uneasy feeling deep within the pit of Elerie's stomach swelled, something that always happened when she was following the trail of some supposedly enchanted antiquity. With it was the feeling that they were about to discover something truly great, but she had yet to discover what. \"Just think El,\" Jenny called over the roaring of the helicopter propeller. \"This could be it.\" At last they touched down by an abandoned, ransacked village, and the archaeologists emerged into the beating sun. The village had been surrounded by United States military personnel. She and Jenny approached the man who looked like he was in charge, standing with two of his soldiers. When she saw them, Elerie stopped and stared. Her first thought was, shit . Suddenly, the uneasy feeling just got a lot worse. I hope you enjoyed this first chapter and introduction to my character! Thanks so much for reading! :)[Chapter 4] Hello and welcome back! We get to meet Tom Cruise in this chapter, yay! ;) II. Elerie \"What the hell are you doing here?\" she demanded. There was silence before the colonel said, \"what's going on Sergeant?\" \"Uh, nothing Sir,\" stuttered Nick. Then he regained composure. \"I assure you there must be some mistake because I have not yet had the pleasure of meeting this woman, Miss...\" She smiled smugly. \"Ah I see.\" She turned to the superior officer. \"It seems that your sergeant here is too embarrassed to admit that we were married, once upon a time. Until I divorced him. Well I'm not too embarrassed, Nicolas.\" She turned on him again. \"Disgusted? Yes. Regretful of our time together? Oh certainly. Embarrassed? No. But really just amazed at your ability to mimic all the qualities of genuine human intimacy, if only for, oh-\" She paused to shrug. \"-Fifteen seconds.\" Even he didn't have anything to say to that. Vail snorted with laughter behind his hand and Jenny tried to stifle a laugh. The Colonel just shook his head at Nick. Elerie smiled at her success. \"And you want to know what I regret most? Ever falling for your so-called 'charm'.\" Nick stared back at her for a moment before recovering and turning back to the colonel. \"Alright, you got me. Sir, I admit, Ms. Morton-\" \"That's Taylor to you, Doctor Taylor. Did you really think I was going to keep your name?\" \"-Is right, we did spend many years happily married-\" \"Oh shut up-\" \"-Many long, satisfying years, including very long, satisfying, exhausting nights-\" \"Oh spare us,\" she snapped. \"-And I assure you Sir I have only fond memories and a broken heart. As you can see Sir, Hell hath no fury.\" He gave her a smug smile. She glared up at him. Oh, if looks could kill... SMACK! The sound it made when her hand contacted with his cheek was so loud that Jenny, Vail, and the Colonel all nearly jumped back. Nick himself stumbled back, holding his now red and stinging cheek, jaw agape, again taken aback. \"Well what the hell are you doing here?\" he shot back, still holding his cheek. \"Doing my job.\" \"Colonel,\" stepped in Jenny, momentarily breaking up their bickering. \"We're archaeologists from the Natural History Museum in London, and we have been instructed to conduct a dig for a tomb around here.\" \"Well you're in luck. These boys here just dropped an explosive on it.\" \"What?!\" Nick pointed to Vail. \"He called in the airstrike.\" When his friend shot him a death glare, he continued. \"Well what a coincidence! We're looking for a tomb too.\" \"Oh really? Another one you can raid?\" \"Excuse me?\" \"You're a tomb raider Nick.\" \"Well, with all due respect, so are you.\" \"Yes but I was trained and it's my actual job. And I do it so that we can further our understanding of human history and evolution, not so I can steal precious antiquities and sell them on the black market for profit.\" Vail was nodding as she spoke. When Nick shot him a glare, he stopped. \"Well you know as good as I do that to find treasure, you need a map. We just happen to have found a map-\" \"You stole a map.\" \"What, no. We found a map-\" \"You're a thief Nick. Finding is your way of saying stealing.\" \"Now that is a great overstatement-\" \"Well we have our own map.\" Heaving a sigh she turned away from Nick and to Vail, her face breaking out into a smile. \"Chris, how are you?\" She hugged him. \"Hey El. Well, I almost died, but I didn't, so I'm feeling pretty good.\" \"Good.\" She turned to the other young woman. \"This is my partner, Doctor Jenny Halsey,\" she introduced. Chris turned to the pretty blonde. \"Hi, I'm Corporal Chris Vail-\" While he continued to flirt with Jenny, Elerie and Nick continued to bicker. \"Great,\" muttered Chris. \"Oh my God-\" The bickering was finally broken apart by Jenny's gasp. \"Elerie come look at this.\" Elerie, more than happy to turn her back on Nick, hurried to Jenny's side, peering down into the pit. \"It's Egyptian,\" she cried. \"Yes.\" Jenny nodded excitedly. \"Oh, is that unusual?\" asked Chris. \"We're in the Persian Gulf,\" Nick reminded him. \"Egypt's miles away, so it's unusual.\" \"Oh you're so smart,\" sneered Elerie. He just smiled smugly. \"Colonel, this is a significant find. I need your men to secure this village,\" Jenny said, marching towards one of the supplies bags. \"We're not even supposed to be here,\" the colonel protested. \"It's our job to make sure anything of value stays out of enemy hands. We have no idea what could be down there. The contents of Tutankhamun's tomb alone were valued at six-hundred-and-fifty million pounds sterling.\" At this, Nick and Chris exchanged a glance. \"Don't even think about it,\" threatened Elerie. The colonel sighed. \"Fine. You've got two hours, then we're moving out.\" He turned to Nick. \"You're getting in the hole with them.\" \"Him?\" cried Elerie, horror-struck. \"Me?\" cried Nick. \"But Sir, I-\" \"Oh no,\" protested Elerie, stepping forward. \"I will not have him ruin this excavation.\" \"Sergeant Morton you gear up, that's an order.\" Elerie cursed under her breath. \"I'll be right here holding the rope Sarge,\" said Chris. \"Get in the damn hole Vail,\" ordered the Colonel. Elerie sighed heavily. Great. Just Great. Fantastic. Brilliant. Wonderful. It couldn't get worse than this, right? Worse than unexpectedly being reunited with your ex-husband who you hadn't seen in years in the most unlikely of places, and now being forced to work with him on what may be your biggest find yet. Nope, nothing could be worse. Nothing. Well, we'll see, especially once you find what's in that tomb ;) Haha! So, thoughts so far? Anybody else a huge fan of archaeology and Ancient Egypt? I hope you enjoyed, thanks so much for reading! :)[Chapter 5] Happy Halloween everyone! In celebration, here's another chapter of my 'The Mummy' story! Hope you enjoy! III. Nick A couple of hours ago he'd been staring down at the photograph, trying to drown out Vail's complaining. Now here she was before him, in the flesh. Chris had been complaining as usual, about the heat, about Nick dragging him on another treasure hunt when they weren't even supposed to be here. Having had enough of his friend's constant complaints, Nick had taken the photo from his jacket pocket, unfolded it, and stared down at it, as he often did. It always brought a smile to his face, seeing their smiling faces together. They looked so happy there, and it felt like a lifetime ago. It made him wonder what had ever gone wrong. Now here she was, light red hair, freckled cheeks, Scottish accent and all. A sunhat shielded her face from the intense sun, and a pair of sunglasses hid her blue-green eyes. Her freckled face was a bright shade of pink, as it always was when she was upset. And evidently she was. He had to admit, he was just as shocked by their reunion and the circumstances of it as she was. And now she was yelling at him. Scoffing at him. It stung when she said she'd changed her name back. His thoughts flickered back to the photo, tucked in the front of his jacket, folded against his chest, almost weightless like any other photo, but also carrying with it an almost unbearable weight at the same time. They had been in Mexico. It had been a vacation, while he was on leave from army duty. Naturally, she had wanted to go investigate some Aztec ruins. He had awoken early in the morning to her bustling about the hotel room, all ready to go, gathering a few last-minute supplies. He'd groaned. \"What time is it?\" \"Time to get up.\" He could sense the excitement in her voice. God she was adorable when she was excited. \"But it's so early,\" he whined. \"I warned you last night that we'd be getting up early, and told you to go to bed early. But you continued to watch TV.\" \"They were playing a Mission Impossible marathon!\" \"Excuses excuses.\" She chuckled. \"Come on Nicky, don't make me come and drag you out of bed.\" \"But it's so early,\" he repeated. He pulled the blankets up over his head. He shrieked moments later when she came over and pulled the sheets off him. This caused her to burst out laughing. \"Time to get up.\" She giggled and threw his clothes at him, trying to prompt him to get out of his pajamas and dressed. Her eyes had had that adorable excitement shining in them. \"Oh come on Nick! Where's your sense of adventure?\" Ellie and Nicky was written on the back corner of the photo. \"Come on Vail. Where's your sense of adventure?\" he'd said, cutting his friend off mid-complaint, refolding the photo and putting it back in his pocket. Where's your sense of adventure... And it had led straight to her. Haha see what I did there? ;) There's Nick's side of the reunion, hope you liked it! Thanks so much for reading![Chapter 6] Hello everyone and welcome back! Here's chapter four! IV. Elerie \"So,\" Nick said as they readied the equipment for the descent into the pit. \"Still meddling with magic?\" \"Oh stop mocking me.\" He held up his hands in a 'have mercy' kind of way. \"I just asked a question.\" \"Well in answer to your question, yes, I am. So watch out.\" Then she addressed both him and Vail. \"Now gentlemen, minimal damage please. And don't, touch, anything. With that the group began the descent. A face that had been carved into the wall silently screamed at them. A warning perhaps? Nick grinned at Elerie as they lowered themselves down into the pit. \"Just like old times.\" \"Sod off.\" When they touched down and released the harnesses, Jenny clicked on a voice recorder. \"This is Doctor Jennifer Halsey, and Doctor Elerie Taylor. We're in a large antechamber of some kind.\" \"Hey, is that mercury?\" Chris's comment caught the ladies' attention. Elerie peered into Nick's gloved hand where a small pool of silver formed from where it dripped from the ceiling. \"The Ancient Egyptians believed it weakened evil spirits.\" \"Well now we know better. The stuff kills you.\" \"Yeah after it makes you crazy,\" added Chris. \"This is definitely a tomb,\" Jenny recorded, continuing onward. \"There is mercury dripping from the ceiling into holes in the ground. Possibly interconnected - wait, it's a canal system, leading all the way to-\" She hurried ahead until she drew to a sudden halt. The others caught up and stared. \"Oh wow,\" breathed Elerie. Ahead was a large pool of silver mercury, surrounded by Anubis statues, chains holding something within the pool. Jenny switched from voice recording to video recording. \"Doctor Halsey here. We are in a large, man-made cavern adjoining the antechamber. Chiseled stairs lead down from a ledge, and there is a canal running between them, feeding a large ritual well at the base filled with mercury. There is a ritual barrier chain that surrounds the well, with a warning to intruders. To keep people out.\" Elerie ran the beam of her flashlight across the well. \"It's strange, there's no sign of any provisions made for someone's journey into the underworld.\" She flicked out her pocket knife and used it to chip away at the grime caking the hieroglyphs on the wall. \"It is strange,\" agreed Jenny, circling the well for a closer look. \"Very strange. No canopic jars, no shabtis... To be buried in a place like this would be a fate worse than death.\" She held up the voice recorder again. \"There are six watchers surrounding the well, all facing inward instead of out. Whatever's in there, those chains aren't for bringing it up-\" \"They're for holding it down,\" finished Elerie. She swallowed hard. She'd had a strange feeling about this. \"This isn't a tomb,\" she shook her head. \"It's a prison.\" I love that last line! So chilling! :) Hope you enjoyed thanks so much for reading![Chapter 7] Hello! :) Thank you for the reviews! Here's the next chapter! V. Elerie \"This place is really starting to creep me out,\" mumbled Vail. Jenny turned to the soldiers. \"Notify the Colonel: we need to call in a team and extra equipment.\" \"Hey, whoa, whoa, he said two hours-\" \"I know, but that's hardly enough. This is significant, there's so much to study here. We need a team with the proper equipment to conduct an excavation.\" \"Jenny,\" Elerie said, sounding distant. \"I don't think that's such a good idea...\" \"We don't have time,\" argued Vail. \"Do you know how long it's going to take to fly a team all the way out here?\" \"I'm not leaving until I've seen what's down there-\" The three jumped and Jenny and Vail's arguing ceased then when a gunshot rang out through the chamber - Nick. The bullet had severed the chains' holding, and with a creak they began to move. \"Nick!\" cried Elerie, storming towards him. \"I told you not to touch anything-\" She stopped and stared, they all did. The chains were drawing something large and dark out of the pool. Everyone gasped. A sarcophagus. Black, with a screaming carved face. Mercury dribbled off it's gruesome surface, like tears. \"Oh my God,\" gasped Jenny as the sarcophagus fully emerged. \"Problem solved,\" Nick said smugly, returning his gun to his belt. A skittering sound caught their ears then, drawing their attention to the hundreds of spiders which had begun scurrying about the tomb. Suddenly, Vail took his gun and started firing it at the spiders. The ladies cried out and ducked down for cover. \"Whoa, whoa! Cease fire Vail! Cease fire!\" ordered Nick. \"One of them bit me!\" screamed Vail. \"They're not even poisonous!\" \"You don't know that!\" \"Come on Vail-\" \"CAN WE PLEASE LEAVE!?\" But Nick wasn't paying attention anymore. He was suddenly too entranced by the sarcophagus. \"What is wrong with you two?!\" Elerie was yelling. \"You two,\" Jenny interjected, turning to the soldiers. \"Tell the Colonel that we need to remove this now. Or you can tell him that he will have to explain why you left us behind.\" Although Nick still seemed suddenly enamored by the sarcophagus, and Vail was too preoccupied with his spider bite, they did call in a helicopter which fully freed the sarcophagus from it's prison. The two soldiers and two archaeologists rode in another helicopter. Elerie could feel Nick staring at her for most of the journey, but she focused on the golden landscape stretching around them. From there the sarcophagus was carried to an airbase and loaded onto a military plane. \"Where the hell did this come from?\" remarked another soldier of the heavy sandstorm moving in. The wind whipped the sand around them, making the air heavy with it. \"Oh careful! Careful please!\" Jenny called to the men loading the sarcophagus onto the plane. \"This is five-thousand years old.\" The sarcophagus was secured - carefully under Jenny's watchful eye - and everyone took a seat. Just as the mysterious sandstorm reached and engulfed them, they took flight. They were off. Maybe Chris will turn into Spider-Man now that he got bitten by a spider ;) sorry, I had to! Kind of a brief chapter, but we learn more about Elerie and Nick in the next one :) Thanks so much for reading - hope you enjoyed![Chapter 8] Hey guys, welcome back! Thank you for the reviews! Glad to see you're enjoying this story so far! :) We learn more about Elerie and Nick's relationship in this chapter - enjoy! VI. Nick They were off, leaving the desert behind. Well, they'd gotten the treasure, not in the way he thought they would, but they'd gotten it. Sort of... Across the plane Vail was lying down, and a few seats from him sat the blonde - Jamie? No, no that wasn't it. Jane? Nope, not that either. J... Jenny, Jenny! Jenny sat with a computer and headphones. Elerie stood up on the seat to reach something from one of the upper compartments. As she was doing so her shirt rode up a little, revealing the intricate tattoo she had on her side. An old Celtic pagan symbol, she'd said. He used to like tracing the intricate likes gently with the tip of his finger, making her giggle. He recalled one such time where she was lying on the bed on her side, notes spread around her, reading through them. He'd come to lay beside her, pushing up her shirt where it had ridden up some to reveal her tattoo. He'd begun to trace the swirling, interconnecting lines. \"Nick.\" \"Hmm?\" \"I'm trying to work.\" \"Yeah?\" \"Yeah. You're being distracting...\" She was trying to sound serious, but he could tell she had a smile on her lips, shaping her words. \"Am I?\" He continued to trace the lines, adding some kisses to her neck. \"Yes - ah, stop that! It tickles!\" She giggled and smacked his hand away, pushing her shirt back down to conceal the marking. He'd chuckled at her blushing. He smiled at the memory. \"Need some help?\" he offered. \"Oh aren't you the gentleman.\" She retrieved what she needed and sat back down. \"No.\" \"You're welcome by the way.\" \"Oh, how's that?\" \"I saved your, whatever it is.\" \"Well it was safely hidden for five-thousand years before you dropped a Hellfire missile on it.\" \"Well you may have never found it otherwise. Again, you're welcome.\" She scoffed and shook her head. \"Do you have any idea what this is?\" She gestured to the sarcophagus. \"The significance of it? An Egyptian sarcophagus imprisoned in a tomb in Mesopotamia. Whoever it is, someone went to great lengths to keep it hidden.\" \"Why'd you tell Greenway and the others fifteen seconds? It was not fifteen seconds - it was never fifteen seconds.\" There was a brief pause before she spoke. \"Because, whatever 'it' was, and however long 'it' lasted, it wasn't real, in the end.\" \"I think you're being a bit harsh-\" \"Well what was I supposed to tell them? That I'm the proud ex-wife of a thief? A con-man? A liar?\" \"Ellie, I never lied to you about my feelings-\" She ignored the use of his nickname for her. \"You stole from me. You used me.\" Now it was his turn to scoff. \"I did not 'use' you.\" \"You did, you used my skills to find precious antiquities and then you would take them and sell them.\" There was another pause before he said, \"but I didn't lie.\" She shook her head. \"Do you ever think of anyone but yourself?\" \"Come on Ellie-\" \"Stop calling me that.\" \"Come on. We used to have fun together, we were a team.\" She scoffed sharply. \"A team? Really? We were never a team.\" Again she looked to the sarcophagus. \"This is my life's work, and you wanted to steal it. How much do you think that's worth on the black market?\" With that, she got up and stalked over to the other side of the plane to sit with Jenny. There's some more backstory for them, hope you like it! As always, thanks so much for reading! :)[Chapter 9] Hey! Thank you for the reviews! :) Hope you enjoy this chapter! VII. Elerie \"Hey Jen, you want to start that preliminary analysis?\" She peered down at the screaming face of the sarcophagus. She felt like screaming herself right now. Three years. Three years and no word, nothing. Why now, of all times, did he have to show up again? And right in the middle of their biggest find yet? A team he'd called them, a team! She felt like snorting at this. A team, really? What the hell Nick? Jenny agreed and the ladies readied the equipment. Good, something to take her mind off of the unbelievably infuriating man sitting just a few seats away, watching her. Jenny turned on the voice recorder again, just like in the tomb, and they knelt before the grand, gruesome sarcophagus. \"This is Doctor Jennifer Halsey and Doctor Elerie Taylor, conducting a preliminary analysis of an Egyptian sarcophagus discovered in the Nineveh province, norther Iraq. The hieroglyphs on the outside of the sarcophagus are definitely New Kingdom. It appears that the wife of King Menehptre died in childbirth, leaving a sole heir to the throne. A girl, called Ahmanet.\" The archaeologists exchanged an excited glance. When the preliminary analysis was complete, Jenny returned to her computer. Elerie sat in between her and Chris, who had been surprisingly quiet throughout this whole trip. She looked over at him and frowned. He seemed to be shaking, trembling. \"Chris?\" She scooted closer to him. \"Chris are you alright-\" He didn't look so good, his skin pale and sweaty. She reached out to gently touch his arm. The next thing she knew, he shot up and grabbed her throat in an iron grip. It's super short I know, but I thought that was a good place to end - the next one will be longer! Thanks so much for reading! :)[Chapter 10] Hello there! Here's the next chapter - there's some action in this one! VIII. Nick \"...It appears that the wife of King Menehptre died in childbirth, leaving a sole heir to the throne. A girl, called Ahmanet.\" Ahmanet ... Suddenly, Nick gasped and lurched forward. No one other than him seemed to notice though. What was up with him? With Vail asleep and Ellie making it clear that she did not want to talk with him, he'd tried talking with Jenny. \"We haven't really met yet,\" he said, sitting down beside her. \"I'm Nick.\" \"Oh I know all about you Mr. Morton.\" The blonde didn't look up from her laptop. \"Oh, so she did talk about me?\" \"Oh yes.\" \"All the good stuff?\" Now she looked at him. \"Oh yes.\" She didn't try to hide any sarcasm. Their conversation hadn't lasted long, and ended in him retreating back to his lone seat across the plane. Now there he sat, staring at the coffin again. Why was he so interested in it all of a sudden? There was something about it... Everything that happened next was a blur. Elerie gave a sort of gasp-whimper/stifled-scream when Chris shot to his feet and seized her by the throat. This action caused her feet to lift off the ground. \"Oh my God-\" Jenny practically threw down her equipment and jumped to her feet as well. \"Whoa - Vail, what the hell are you doing?\" Nick cried, watching his ex-wife dangle by the neck in the grasp of his friend. \"C-Chris,\" Elerie choked out. She kicked her legs and squirmed, but it was no use. \"Corporal Vail what in the living hell do you think you're doing?\" The colonel stormed towards Vail, who, just as he reached him, took the knife from his belt, and stabbed the colonel. Once. Twice. Elerie screamed as she watched the Colonel's now lifeless body collapse to the ground, or the best she could scream with a hand clamped around her throat. Now the other soldiers on the plane, seeing their commander dead, drew their weapons, pointing them at Vail, and consequently Elerie. \"Hey! Hey! Don't shoot! Don't shoot!\" yelled Nick, jumping within the line of fire, defending his friend and ex-wife. \"Please wait!\" As a soldier came closer, Nick snatched his gun from him. \"Okay back off!\" \"Stop! Do not shoot!\" yelled Jenny, now standing in between him and the soldiers. \"This is a pressurized aircraft!\" Now Vail held Elerie's neck in one hand, and the blood-soakedknife in the other. If anyone would be his next target for using the knife, it would be her. Nick found that he really didn't have a choice. Bang! The gunshot rang throughout the confined space, the bullet burying itself in Vail's shoulder. This caused him to drop Elerie, who screamed, because of both being dropped and the gunshot. As Vail recovered Elerie scrambled away, Nick helping her to her feet and drawing her close to him with an arm around her waist, she being too shocked to protest. Now her own hand held her neck where it still felt as though she were being choked. \"Whoa, hey-\" Nick stepped away just as Vail swiped at him with the knife. \"Vail, what are you doing?\" But Vail only continued to approach, zombie-like, holding the knife out. His gaze was distant and his breathing was a heavy wheezing. \"Vail? Vail stop. Stop! Put the knife down.\" \"Chris?\" Now he headed for Elerie again, the knife level with her chest. The group had backed up as far as they could go. Bang! Both Elerie and Jenny jumped and cried out as another bullet from Nick's gun hit Vail in the shoulder again. This didn't seem to faze him though, and he continued to advance. Nick fired again, this one in the chest, and Vail fell to the floor, dead. Silence. Bang! Nick shot him once more. Elerie let out a whimper and clung to his arm. He looked pale and dazed himself. He'd just shot his best friend. \"Oh Chris,\" she whispered shakily. \"I-I'm sorry,\" Nick managed, passing the gun back to the soldier. One episode of chaos led to the next. They barely had time to recover from that whole ordeal and Nick didn't even get the chance to check to make sure Ellie was alright before the plane gave a great lurch. Peering out the window, Nick saw that the wing was damaged. He burst into the cockpit. \"What's happening?\" he demanded. \"We don't know. Take a seat,\" one of the pilots ordered as they tried to regain control of the plane. That was when Nick noticed something ahead of them in the sky, drawing closer. A great, dark cloud... Birds! The great flock came smashing through the windshield, attacking the pilots. Nick stumbled back into the main cabin to avoid being hit himself just as everyone's feet were swept out from beneath them - gravity within the plane was gone, leaving everyone floating around the cabin. He heard a familiar cry and caught Ellie as she flew towards him. She gripped his jacket tightly and the two clung to each other amidst the ensuing chaos. Nick searched frantically but finally located the parachutes. And good thing too, for the plane gave a lurch as one of the wings ripped off, tearing a giant hole in the side which sucked everything that wasn't held down out. \"Parachutes!\" he hollered. \"Jenny go!\" screamed Elerie. Her colleague obeyed and took the first parachute, managing to escape the chaos. Finally, Nick managed to grab hold of the other parachute. The only remaining parachute. \"Take it!\" He shoved it into Ellie's hands. \"No you take it!\" She shoved it back. \"No, you-\" He shoved it back to her and helped secure it on her back. \"Uh, ah! I don't know how to do this!\" \"Hey, hey, Ellie, you can do this, you can do this! You're going to be fine!\" She grasped his arm, never wanting to let go, as the plane continued to nose-dive spiral down. His hand clasped tightly over hers holding the string. She stared at him, wide-eyed. He gave a nod, letting go of her hand. Gripping the string tightly she gave a tug, and the chute opened, sending her flying out of the plane. She was safe. Thank God she was safe. Nick grasped the plane wall and closed his eyes, waiting for the crash. Cliffhanger - sort of! ;) Haha thanks so much for reading, hope you enjoyed![Chapter 11] Hello! Here's the post-crash chapter! And thank you so much for the reviews! :) IX. Elerie What happened on that plane? She had been checked over by a doctor - a few bumps and bruises, but nothing serious. No serious physical injuries. She stared down at the photograph in her hand. It was folded, and a little torn around the edges - well-loved. \"Ms. Taylor,\" the doctor had said, holding out a little piece of paper. \"I found this tucked in the inner pocket of Sergeant Morton's jacket.\" Taking and unfolding it she had found their smiling faces in a photograph from their trip to Mexico when Nick had been on leave. Ellie and Nicky was written on the back. Nick's writing. Oh Nick... She didn't know whether to laugh or smile or burst into tears at the photo itself, the memories it revived, ones she'd tried to trap away, or the knowledge that he'd carried this close to him . What happened on that plane? It had all happened so fast. First she had nearly been strangled by her friend, then she had watched her friend be shot dead by her ex-husband, his best friend, and then the whole plane had gone crashing down, and Nick had given her the last parachute... Saved her life. Nick. Oh Nick... \"You okay?\" Jenny appeared and sat beside her, breaking into her thoughts. She nodded distantly. \"Oh El, I'm so sorry.\" Jenny put a comforting arm around her friend and colleague. \"Thanks Jen. I'm just - shaken, that's all.\" She shook her head. Physically she may be fine, but mentally - the whole event on the plane seemed to be seared into her mind, leaving her unable to stop witnessing it. \"Maybe I should see someone, you know, like a therapist...\" \"I know a specialist, in London...\" \"I don't know Jen, I think I'm just saying things, you know?\" Her words trailed off and she rubbed her eyes. What happened on that plane? \"The doctor's asking for our help identifying the bodies. Do you think you're up to it?\" Elerie slowly nodded. \"El, you don't have to, I can do it.\" \"N-no, I-I can do it.\" Holding tightly onto Jenny's hand, the two archaeologists entered the morgue, accompanied by the doctor and nurse. \"Oh my God-\" \"Oh!\" Both Jenny and the nurse turned away, covering their eyes. The doctor turned away as well. Elerie only stared, eyes wide and jaw dropped. At first she thought she must just be hallucinating. After everything, it would make sense. But no. There, in the centre of the morgue, stood Nick, very much alive. \"N-Nick?\" she managed to squeak. \"Ellie!\" He appeared just as startled. \"What's happening?\" \"Y-you're alive.\" She spoke in a voice barely above a whisper. \"Yeah. What's-\" \"You're here...\" \"W-what's going on?\" \"You're naked-\" Her own blurting of it made her realize that she was still staring, and finally pulled her gaze away from the very much exposed Nick. \"What - oh!\" Suddenly realizing this too, Nick covered himself with his hands the best he could and scooted behind a table, his bare feet squeaking on the morgue floor. \"What's happening? Where am I?\" he asked, looking around. \"Who's in charge here?\" But everyone was too shocked to answer. Finally, all eyes turned to the doctor who slowly raised his hand, looking terribly embarrassed. \"I, um, I-I'm afraid there's been a horrible mistake...\" Haha! Yay, he's alive! Also, we'll get some more flashbacks of Ellie and Nick soon! Thanks so much for reading, hope you enjoyed! :)[Chapter 12] Hello! Thank you for the reviews! :) Here's the next chapter! X. Elerie Nick was downing drink after drink, Elerie sitting across from him in a bustling pub, staring at him, too shocked to tell him to slow down. \"What?\" he asked, as if he had not just woken up in a morgue after being confirmed dead. \"How did you get out of that plane?\" Elerie demanded, not blinking. \"There's not a single scratch on your body Nick, and you should be dead, no one could have survived that crash.\" Nick shrugged, holding a drink in each hand, looking impressed with himself. Of course he would take it as a compliment. Although she tried to contain it, she couldn't, and embarrassingly enough, a sob escaped her lips, one that had been threatening to break free ever since the crash. It was a mix of shock, relief, sadness, anger, confusion... Now he looked startled. \"Sorry,\" she said, desperately wiping away at her tears. \"It's just, you're alive, and I don't know how. I don't know what's going on.\" She wiped at her eyes again and swallowed back another sob. \"Hey-\" He reached out and placed his hand over hers on the table. She stared down at their hands for a moment before sliding hers away. She sighed. \"Thank you.\" \"For what?\" \"Saving my life back there.\" \"You would have done the same for me. Hell, you almost did.\" \"Yeah.\" \"But I couldn't let you do that.\" \"And now here we are.\" She nodded a little. There was a pause as she reached into her jacket pocket and withdrew something. \"Nick, they found this in the pocket of your jacket and gave it to me. But since you're here now-\" She trailed off and instead slid the item across the table. The photograph. He stared down at it. \"I thought I lost it in the crash.\" He reached out to slide it closer to himself, ensuring their fingers brushed. She quickly drew her hand away. Again, she sighed. \"Listen, Nick. I think you should know something. As you know, I dabble a little in ancient rituals and magic. I became an archaeologist to try and discover more about the beyond if you will and how the ancients saw it - some say ancient civilizations were more developed than we are today. So I search for antiquities with supposed supernatural powers or a connection to them. I had a bad feeling going into that tomb-\" \"I thought that's cause I was with you.\" \"Just listen!\" She paused to shake her head. \"Jenny and I work with a group of archaeologists, and well we've developed this theory: that an Egyptian princess had been erased from the history books - deliberately. We've been searching for something called the Dagger of Set, a ceremonial knife with a large jewel at the hilt. Now Set is the Egyptian God of-\" \"God of Death,\" he finished. She paused, surprised. \"Yes. How did you-\" \"You were always studying this stuff. You were always working.\" \"I wasn't always working,\" she defended. He shrugged. She sighed and continued. \"Legend has it that the dagger and stone, together, have the power to give Set physical form. We're convinced it was hidden here in Europe, stolen by Crusaders centuries ago. Jenny and I found reference to it in a manuscript written by a Crusader knight himself, and he suggested that the dagger was broken apart, separated from the stone, and we believe that the stone was buried with this knight, somewhere here in England. A massive Crusader tomb was recently discovered under London, and that tomb is what led us to Ahmanet.\" \"Ahmanet,\" he repeated in a whisper. \"Yes.\" \"You think the stone is buried somewhere in that tomb.\" She nodded. \"We believe that she's the princess in the legend. The hieroglyphs said she was destined to be Egypt's next queen, but then her birthright was taken from her. This led her down a dark path, one that had to be stopped.\" \"What'd she do?\" \"She murdered her father, along with his wife and child, and made some sort of pact with Set. And then when the tomb turned out to be a prison, and then with the spiders, and birds, and sandstorm - something's happening, and I think it's all connected. And you're alive, and I don't know how.\" She trailed off, shaking her head. \"I think that, somehow, we've angered the gods.\" He stared back at her for a moment before smirking a little. She'd seen that look from him many times before, usually whenever she would babble on about this sort of thing. He used to do it jokingly to tease her. \"Oh don't look at me like that! This is serious!\" \"Would you excuse me, I'll be right back.\" Nick slid out of his seat and disappeared into the restroom. She sighed. Jenny came over from where she had been sitting at the counter. \"He won't speak to me, no surprise though, for he never did, even when we were at our closest.\" Elerie scoffed. \"If we even were close. He was always secretive.\" \"It's so strange,\" marveled Jenny. Elerie took one of Nick's still half-full drinks and swirled it around. \"Yeah. It doesn't make any sense. For him to have survived that crash-\" She shook her head. \"It's impossible.\" She looked to her partner. \"Right?\" Haha I like that scene in the pub :) Hope you guys enjoyed thanks so much for reading! And sorry for the delay - I didn't realize how long it had been since I updated this story! Thanks for sticking with me! Oh and there's another Ellie and Nick flashback in the next chapter :)[Chapter 13] Thank you so much for the reviews! :) So glad you guys are enjoying this story! XI. Elerie Jenny excused herself, saying she had to make a phone call. With that she too disappeared, leaving Elerie alone. She sighed. Maybe Nick was right, and she was just crazy. He hadn't said it, but the look he'd given her was enough. No, no why was she thinking that, and why did she care at all what he thought? It was kind of funny, in a way, they'd met at a pub not unlike this one, but in London. She didn't know what made her think of this suddenly, but she did. That had been ten years ago - they'd met, gotten married three years later, were married for four years, and now divorced for three. A lot had happened in those ten years. The pub had actually been surprisingly quiet for a Saturday night, especially considering the downpour outside. She had been in the middle of working towards her Ph.D., and her cousin had somehow managed to convince her to take a break from her studies and join her and her fiancé at a local pub. An hour later she'd had enough, but now felt responsible for her now drunken friends, so she went up to the bar and took a seat on one of the stools. \"One special please,\" she told the bartender. Then she buried her face in her hands and exhaled a heavy sigh. \"Long day?\" She looked up at the sudden voice to find that whoever it was had definitely been speaking to her. A man sat a couple of stools down from her, drink in hand. He was American. She nodded over to the booth she had been sitting at. \"See the couple over there snogging in the corner? That's my cousin and her fiancé.\" \"Ah.\" He nodded and took a sip of his drink. \"Third-wheel?\" \"I guess so. It was supposed to be a double date - her idea, not mine - but he never showed. I could be back home studying myths and magic in Medieval Europe and instead I'm stuck here waiting for some asshole and keeping an eye on my drunken friends.\" \"Sounds great.\" \"You have no idea.\" The bartender placed her drink down before her. \"Thank you.\" \"Cheers.\" The man held up his drink. She touched her glass to his. There was a pause as both took a drink. \"How about you?\" she asked. \"What brings you here to this English pub on a blustery night?\" \"I'm in the U.S. military, and I have a few days here before being shipped out the rest of the way. This is my first night. Know any good stuff to do?\" \"Well there's always the classics, like Tower of London, The Globe Theatre, Buckingham Palace. But I also know a whole list of castles and supposedly haunted and/or magical places, if that's of any interest.\" \"Huh, interesting. So you're into that stuff, huh?\" \"Yeah it's always been an interest of mine. I'm actually studying it - well, sort of, on top of being an archaeologist.\" \"Oh, so you're Doctor...\" She chuckled. \"You flatter me Sir. Not Doctor yet, not until I get my Ph.D., which I'm actually working on right now. What, you don't believe in that sort of thing?\" \"Well...\" He gave a little shrug. \"Oh come on, where's your sense of adventure?\" The first of many times she would say that to him, unbeknownst to them at the time. She had then launched into explaining her love for all that stuff. It was when she'd been talking for almost ten solid minutes that she realized she was blabbing. She cut herself off and smiled sheepishly. \"Sorry, don't get me started. I could talk about this for hours.\" \"No, no, please continue,\" he said. \"I like your enthusiasm.\" They ended up talking for hours. She learned that his name was Nick Morton and that he was hoping to soon be promoted to Sergeant. They even ended up splitting a dessert. By the end of the night, she was glad that what's-his-name hadn't shown up for the double-date. And the best part? He had actually listened to every word she said, really listened. \"Will I ever see you again?\" She had to ask. He smiled and nodded. \"Yeah.\" Six months later she was finally Doctor Taylor, and was giving a talk in Glasgow at the university about old Celtic myths and magic. She had been surprised to say the least when after the talk one of the audience members waited around until she was about to leave to come talk to her. He'd had a bouquet of flowers with him. \"Congratulations, Doctor Taylor.\" He was on leave back in the UK and had heard about a talk being given by a certain Doctor Taylor. She had been very touched to say the least and they'd gone out in celebration afterwards, of her becoming Doctor, and he becoming Sergeant. The start of something special. Funny how something like that could end so quickly, there one moment, gone the next. Love was funny that way. I feel like that's a good note to end on :) thanks so much for reading, hope you enjoyed and hope you liked this flashback! And don't worry, we'll get to see Ahmanet herself very soon![Chapter 14] Hello! Here's the next chapter for you - hope you enjoy! Thanks! XII. Nick and Elerie He stumbled into the restroom, peering around corners. It couldn't really be Vail's ghost he kept seeing, could it? His friend back from the dead to haunt him? But there he was, his skin colourless, his eyes lifeless. \"El looks good,\" he said. Nick shook his head. \"This can't be happening...\" \"I mean really great.\" \"Okay, just stop-\" \"Do you think I ever had a chance with her friend?\" \"What?\" \"I mean how did you ever manage to mess that up?\" \"T-this is all in my head, it's all in my head...\" \"No, it's not,\" Vail insisted. \"I'm here, you're here. You shot me Nick. Four times!\" \"You scared me and I panicked!\" \"Four times!\" \"You stabbed Colonel Greenway! Then you came after me! You even went after Ellie - you were strangling her!\" \"You told her yet?\" \"What?\" \"That you're still crazy for her? Dude, it's so obvious.\" Nick was still baffled. \"Okay, I'm sorry, okay?\" \"Not okay. I'm cursed Nick, and so are you.\" \"Cursed? W-what do you mean cursed?\" Meanwhile, Elerie still sat at their table, pondering, well, everything. A waitress came by. \"Finished with those?\" She nodded to the assortment of half-full, full, and empty drink glasses. \"Oh, they're not mine,\" she insisted. \"But yes, I think you'd better take them away. Thank you.\" A few minutes later Elerie herself headed to the washroom. \"Gah!\" She jumped and gave a startled cry as soon as she opened the door. \"What are you doing in here?! This is the ladies' room!\" Nick scurried over. \"Just a second, just give me a minute, thanks.\" He slammed the door closed. \"Oi!\" She pounded on the door but he must have been holding it closed. \"Nick! Go to your own bloody loo!\" A few moments later the door opened and he left, brushing right past her and out of the pub into the alley. He didn't look well. She followed him outside into the night, jumping when he spun around to face her. \"You're right!\" he cried, pointing at her. \"You're right-\" \"Nick, what-\" \"We have angered the gods-\" \"Nick, calm down-\" \"I saw her, the chick, in the box-\" \"Ahmanet.\" \"That one. He said-\" \"Who said what?\" \"Vail.\" \"Vail?\" \"Yeah Vail. The coffin we found-\" \"Sarcophagus,\" she corrected. \"Whatever. There was that writing on it-\" \"Hieroglyphics-\" \"Ellie, with all due respect, cute as I may find it, I'm not interested in your archaeological jargon right now. The writing on the box that we took out of the hole-\" She just couldn't help herself. \"You mean the hieroglyphs on the sarcophagus that we excavated from the tomb.\" \"Damn it Ellie! There was something about a curse, wasn't there? Wasn't there?\" he pressed. \"Okay, Nick, you've got to calm down. You've had a concussion, and toxic exposure, and you just had a shit ton to drink. I say you need to rest-\" \"But how does that explain that I know that 'Setepa-i' means 'my chosen'?\" She stared at him. \"Setepa-i? That's Ancient Egyptian-\" \"Ancient Egyptian.\" Their words overlapped. \"So how do I know that?\" \"Uh, you... You've been in the Middle East for years. Maybe you heard it and forgot. Or maybe you recalled it from my work...\" \"Why are you backing off from this? You were just talking a few minutes ago about angering the gods. I am telling you, she is real.\" \"Nick, you're starting to scare me-\" There was a pause. \"You know, I-I think you're right, I think this is all in my head. It's ridiculous.\" He gave a short laugh. \"I think we should find the box-coffin thing, open it up, look inside, and when I see a three-thousand-year-old prune in there, no more curse.\" \"Nick, you don't need a sarcophagus, you need a doctor-\" \"Oh come on Ellie, don't tell me you don't want to see it too. You're life's work. Come on, where's your sense of adventure?\" Thanks so much for all the reads! You guys are awesome! :)[Chapter 15] Hello! Here's the next chapter for you - it's really short but I'll also post the next one :) XIII. Jenny The phone line rang once. Twice. Three times. Four... The line clicked in from the other end. \"Identify,\" came the voice from the other end. \"It's Jenny, get me Henry,\" she ordered in a low voice. There was a brief pause as the phone line shifted. \"Jennifer,\" came Henry's calm voice moments later. It always surprised her how calm he always seemed to be. She kept her voice low, hoping he could hear her over the background pub noise. \"This may be a far more significant problem than we imagined. Something's definitely wrong with him.\" \"Hmm.\" He sounded thoughtful. \"Bring the soldier to London. And what about Ms. Taylor?\" \"She's worried about him.\" \"Does she suspect anything?\" \"No.\" \"Good. Make sure she comes to London as well. Do not discuss anything further with them.\" Jenny sighed. \"Will do.\" The line went dead. Jenny hung up the phone as well and sighed. She hated lying to her friend but... Elerie would know the truth soon enough. With that Jenny headed back over to the table where the once-couple had been sitting, almost expecting to find them yelling at each other in an argument. But Elerie and Nick were gone. Haha now Jenny's like \"I turn my back for one second and they're gone!\" Really short chapter I know, but I wanted to have something from Jenny's perspective. We'll have something from Ahmanet's perspective later too :) thanks so much for reading, hope you enjoyed![Chapter 16] Here it is, just as promised! :) Enjoy! XIV. Elerie They hailed a cab and both climbed into the back seat. \"Waverley Abbey please,\" Elerie told the driver. \"Isn't that where that big plane crash just happened?\" he questioned. \"Uh, we work there, part of the clean-up crew,\" she quickly answered. He shrugged and started driving. The drive began in silence, both Elerie and Nick staring out their respective windows. He broke the silence. \"So, you seeing anyone?\" A pause. \"Maybe.\" \"Oh.\" He nodded. \"So you are?\" \"Maybe.\" \"So you're not?\" \" Maybe . Why, does it matter either way?\" \"No... I'm just curious. I just asked.\" Another pause. \"No, I'm not. There, happy? You have someone you're seeing?\" \"Maybe.\" She rolled her eyes. \"No, actually, I don't. Haven't for the past three years.\" \"Implying?\" He didn't answer, and they spent the rest of the drive in silence. \"Oh God.\" Elerie finally said. Looking out the window, they could see the crash site up ahead. What a mess. The driver dropped them off in front of the Abbey and pulled away, leaving them there. \"You know I really don't think we're supposed to be here,\" she said. Tape surrounded the perimeter of the church and there were searchlights up ahead. A distant radio could be heard. She hesitated when Nick climbed under the tape before reluctantly following. He headed in the direction of the church. \"Nick, it's this way,\" she hissed, nodding to the crash site. \"Nick-\" \"We're in the right place,\" was all he said. \"Nick - Nick!\" But he didn't listen and instead headed into the church. Of course he didn't listen to her - he never did. Why did she even try? Stupid Nick . She trudged through the wreckage alone, hugging her arms tightly around herself - it was pretty eerie out here. Suddenly, she jumped when she heard a cut-of- cry, that sounded like Nick. It was coming from inside the Abbey. She cautiously made her way inside. Six heads turned to look at her. She stood still as a statue. You would too if you walked into a room to see your ex-husband being held down by zombie-like creatures, his shirt pushed up, and being straddled by a young woman who was a mix of both decaying and alive with grey skin and black markings all over her face, dressed in torn cloth. Well, it had certainly been a day of walking in on the unexpected. First it had been walking into the dig site to find her ex-husband already there, then it had been the morgue only to find her dead ex-husband very much alive and completely naked. Now this. She wasn't sure which was stranger. \"Ellie!\" cried Nick. \"Run! Run!\" Finally she snapped from her trace, just as the young woman - Princess Ahmanet - came charging towards her. She grabbed Elerie by the neck in an iron grip, slamming her against the wall before leaning her face close to hers, aiming to - kiss her? The princess gave an un-human wail when Elerie took her pocket knife and stabbed her. She had barely realized she had pulled it out of her pocket and flicked it open and was almost just as surprised as Ahmanet. Now enraged, Ahmanet struck Elerie across the face, sending her crashing into the pews just as Nick came at her from behind, stabbing her in the back with a dagger of some sort. He helped Elerie scramble to her feet. \"I think she was going to kiss me,\" she cried. \"More like kiss-kill you. Come on!\" Haha I love that scene when she (Jenny in the movie) walks in on him, too good! Thanks so much for reading, hope you enjoyed! :)[Chapter 17] Hello! Thank you so much for the reviews, they mean a lot and are always much appreciated! :) Here's the next chapter - enjoy! XV. Elerie They sprinted out of the church. As soon as they reached the church yard, both took off in different directions. She headed for the crash site - maybe there was a cleanup crew who could help - while he headed for an abandoned ambulance. She realized this just as he climbed in the truck and started it. \"Hey! Hey! Wait!\" But he was already speeding away. \"Nick! Nick! You son of a bitch!\" So he was going to drag her all the way here and now just leave her? What a jackass. She turned and started running for the crash site - only to be stopped by the mummy herself. Ahmanet stood a ways in front of her, amber eyes narrowed, slowly making her way towards Elerie, who quickly began stumbling back. Vroom! Screech! Crash! The next thing she knew was the ambulance was back - and had driven right into Ahmanet, knocking the un-dead woman back into the stone wall of the church. \"Get in!\" Nick shouted, breaking Elerie's stunned moment. This time she just managed to haul herself inside the ambulance as he sped away again. \"We're you just going to leave me?!\" \"You saw that, right?\" \"You were, weren't you?!\" \"You saw it right?!\" \"I can't un-see it! You were going to leave me!\" \"Oh like you left me?\" \"What?\" \" You divorced me ?\" She gawked at him. \"Really Nick, seriously?! You want to do this now, now of all times? Are you serious!? You're unbelievable - AH!\" She was cut off then when in his hasty driving he lurched the ambulance forward sharply, and she slammed against her seat. \"You bastard!\" They sped along a forest road. \"Where are we going?\" she demanded. \"Away. From. Here. There's a highway up ahead.\" \"How do you know?\" \"I just know! Here-\" He tossed something into her lap. A dark dagger with a long, curved blade. \"Oh my God, oh my God - do you know what this is?\" she gasped. \"The Dagger of Set.\" \"Yes-\" \"She was gonna drive that thing right through me.\" \"The stone, it is missing.\" \"Yeah that seemed to really piss her off.\" A hand flew to her mouth. \"Oh my God, it's real! We were right!\" She was practically bouncing in her seat. \"Ellie could you please celebrate later!\" \"This is my life's work!\" \"You didn't almost die cause of it! How was it in that statue?\" \"What do you mean?\" \"She smashed off the head of one of the statues and the dagger was inside.\" \"It could have been a reliquary. Crusaders would use them to hide holy relics. But she knew it was there.\" \"Wait - are you saying she brought the plane down there on purpose?\" \"That's why she wanted you to come to the church.\" \"I told you I wanted to go to the church. I wanted to see, see her-\" \"See her corpse.\" There was a pause. \"Oh God - Nick, she's in your head.\" \"What?\" he scoffed. \"That's ridiculous. She is not in my-\" SCREECH! This time, she was almost given whiplash again as he slammed on the breaks. \"Bloody hell...\" But when she looked to see what that was all about, she found that they were right back where they started: the church. And there was Ahmanet, not even baring a scratch. \"I drove right back to her,\" Nick whispered. \"Oh God she's in my head.\" \"Back! Back! Back!\" Elerie practically screamed as the mummy started making her way towards them. Nick threw the ambulance in reverse, only to crash into the stone wall surrounding the church before speeding off. Soon they were back on the dirt road racing through the trees. \"She's in my head, she's in my head. Oh my God, she's in my head,\" Nick kept mumbling. \"Move over-\" Elerie began to climb over Nick, shoving him out of the way. \"Wh-what are you doing?!\" \"She's in your head, I'm not letting you drive us back to her again!\" She shoved him over into the passenger side and took the wheel herself. Both began frantically screaming then when one of the mummy-zombie things smashed through the windshield, it's snarling face close to hers. The other smashed through the passenger window, clawing at Nick. She kicked her leg out and felt her foot come in contact with something. She kept kicking. \"Ah that's my face! That's my face! That's MY FACE!\" Nick yelled. \"Sorry!\" \"Ah - a little help here!\" Nick cried, trying to get rid of both attacking creatures. \"I'm driving! Get rid of them! AH!\" One of the creatures grabbed her arm and tried to drag her out the smashed windshield. She grabbed onto the seat belt before being wrenched free of the ambulance and managed to kick off the zombie-mummy, but it tried clawing its way back up the front of the truck. \"Buckle up.\" Nick clicked her seat belt into place. He didn't do the same for himself though so when the creatures attacked again and she lost control of the ambulance, sending it rolling off the road, Nick went flying as the truck flipped and turned off the road and down a hill. Elerie, as she was buckled in, stayed inside, but was no less thrashed around. At last, the ambulance stopped rolling. Both groaned as they tried to recover from that ordeal. \"Ellie!\" Nick stumbled to his feet, rushing over to her. The ambulance had landed upside down. She managed to unbuckle herself so she was no longer dangling upside down herself. Then they saw her, emerging through the trees: Ahmanet. She had found them again. Haha! Hope you enjoyed, thanks so much for reading! (and yay, we finally got to meet Ahmanet :)[Chapter 18] Hello! Here's the next chapter - enjoy! XVI. Elerie Now pissed off himself, Nick grabbed a large branch and approached the mummy. \"Get her Nick!\" Elerie cheered him on. \"Kick her ass!\" Before he could barely take a swing at her, Ahmanet smashed the branch from his hands and hit him, sending him flying up, up, up through the trees. He landed in front of Elerie hard on his stomach. Everything that happened next was a blur: Ahmanet went for Elerie again, only to be struck through by - a harpoon? That's what it looked like anyway. People dressed in black and armed with similar weapons poured through the trees, all led by Jenny. Elerie was pulled gently from the ambulance by some of the newcomers while the rest surrounded and restrained the mummy. \"Elerie!\" Jenny rushed over. \"Don't worry, you're safe now.\" The people in black took them in trucks to London. \"Are you a spy?\" Elerie asked from the back seat of one of the trucks. Jenny had changed into all black, including a leather jacket and tall boots, and had pulled her hair back in a ponytail. \"We'll explain when we get there,\" Jenny assured her. \"Where's, 'there'?\" Jenny didn't respond but Elerie was answered a few minutes later when they pulled up behind the Natural History Museum. \"Work?\" Still, she received no response but was guided inside and into an elevator. One of the agents pressed the button, and they went down, down, down the shaft. Would they ever stop? How far did it go? Finally the doors slid open to reveal some sort of lab housing a bunch of well, strange artifacts. She looked around her. \"Where are we, what is this place?\" \"Prodigium.\" \"'Prodigium'?\" \"Yes, from Latin.\" Suddenly, something clicked. \"This is your department of 'special collections'?\" Jenny nodded. \"Yes.\" Another agent came over to them then. \"Henry will see her now.\" \"Thank you, Malik.\" Jenny nodded. Then she gestured for Elerie to follow them down a long, dark hall. \"So now where are we going?\" \"To meet with my boss, Dr. Jekyll. Don't worry, he has everything sorted out. \" \"Jekyll?\" Elerie scoffed. \"Yeah, Jekyll, I'm sure.\" She was led into a wide, bright, neatly-kept office, already occupied by a man in a suit. \"Ah, Ms. Taylor.\" The man approached her and smiled. \"A pleasure to finally meet you. Jennifer has told me much about you.\" \"Apparently...\" She shook his hand. \"Welcome to Prodigium. I am Doctor Henry Jekyll.\" \"Jekyll? Like the book?\" To this, he chuckled. \"Perhaps. Can we get you anything? Are you hungry, thirsty?\" \"I'm fine, but thanks. Just still a little shaken from being attacked by a mummy.\" \"Ah yes, we will get to that.\" He crossed the room to stand by his desk. \"Ms. Taylor, do you know much about your ancestry?\" A strange question. She shrugged. \"We're from the lowlands, our clan. Don't know much else.\" He arranged something on his desk, not looking at her as he spoke. \"And how about the trials?\" \"I'm sorry?\" \"The witch trials, and hunts.\" \"Uh, um...\" \"Did you know that Scotland had some of the worst witch panics?\" \"I do, yes.\" \"Well, we have evidence to believe that you are a descendant of a very prominent coven of witches from Scotland, dating back to the seventeenth century.\" \"You have evidence... To believe?\" \"Yes.\" He nodded and gave her a small smile. \"You have evidence - evidence of my ancestry?\" What the hell? \"I-I'm sorry, what does this have to do with anything?\" \"Yes, of course, you're right. Forgive me for jumping ahead.\" He spread his arms out, looking around the room, almost in awe. \"This is Prodigium, Ms. Taylor. From the Latin, monstrum vel prodigium. ' A Warning of Monsters.'\" \"Okay...\" \"We deal with items and arifacts of the supernatural, myth, legend, magic. Now back to your ancestors - makes sense, though. Jennifer tells me that you have a great interest in magic and the supernatural, yes?\" She crossed her arms. \"What else has Jennifer told you?\" \"Just about your search for Princess Ahmanet. And your connection to Mr. Morton.\" \"Connection.\" To this, she chuckled. \"That's one way of putting it.\" \"Yes. I understand that you were married?\" \"Divorced now.\" Wait, Nick... \"Nick - where is he?\" \"He is here as well.\" \"Where?\" \"Here, safe...\" So vague. What the actual hell was going on? \"Ms. Taylor, I'm afraid that Sergeant Morton has been - well, cursed.\" \"Cursed?\" \"Yes, cursed.\" Silence, she waiting for a further explanation, one which she did not receive. \"Okay... And? How? Why?\" she prompted. \"Please have a seat, Ms. Taylor.\" He sat at his desk, gesturing to the chair in front of it, Jenny and Malik standing, almost guard-like, off to the side. Elerie remained standing, arms crossed, and faced the man before her, this Dr. Jekyll fellow. \"As you are aware, it was him who severed the barrier chain in the tomb, him who freed Princess Ahmanet and unleashed her powers.\" \"Yeah. I told him not to touch anything, but does he listen? 'Course not.\" \"Stubborn fellow?\" \"You have no idea.\" \"Well, continuing, as he was the one who freed her, Ahmanet formed some sort of connection with him, cursing him.\" She thought for a moment. \"He has been acting rather strangely - and I mean more than usual. And back at the church, she was in his head - she made him come right back to her.\" Jekyll nodded. \"Exactly.\" Now she sat down. \"So he's cursed by a five-thousand-year-old mummy?\" \"I'm afraid so, Ms. Taylor. But do not worry,\" he quickly added. \"We are doing everything we can to figure out a way to lift this curse.\" \"You are?\" \"Yes. So do not worry about your former husband. He will be well taken care of.\" She shook her head. \"And what have I got to do with all this?\" \"Well aside from your connection to the now unfortunately cursed Mr. Morton - we were actually hoping to have this meeting sooner, but then the opportunity for the tomb excavation arose, and now all this. So I am afraid it is all happening at once.\" \"You wanted to meet with me before?\" \"Yes.\" \"Why? About what?\" \"Ah and you see, Ms. Taylor, that is what brings us right back to your family, your bloodline: that of witches, powerful ones. Many burned at the stake for their actions, but some able to escape and survive. And that powerful bloodline continued through the centuries, the generations, and therefore to you.\" He gestured to her. \"You have always held a belief in magic and the unknown beyond, Ms. Taylor. Where do you think that belief comes from?\" \"H-how do you know all this?\" \"Well, I asked Jennifer, as your friend and collegue to-\" \"You've been monitoring me?\" She turned on her friend. \"What the hell?!\" \"Elerie I-\" \"Please Jennifer-\" Jekyll held up a hand to silence her. \"There will be time for further explanation later.\" He turned back to a now fuming Elerie. \"Now Ms. Taylor I realize that this will be a lot for you to take at once-\" To this, she scoffed. \"-On top of this whole curse business. But I'm here to offer you a place amongst us here at Prodigium, a safe place for you to learn and study.\" \"Wait, are you offering me a job?\" \"You could say that, yes, Ms. Taylor.\" She gawked at him. \"So let me get this straight: you're offering me a job at this 'magic lab' of yours.\" \"Yes.\" \"Casue I'm a witch.\" \"Yes.\" \"And my ex-husband's been cursed by a mummy.\" \"Precisely.\" There was a moment of silence before she jumped to her feet and stormed from the room. Wow time sure flies! Sorry guys! Hope this longer chapter with some revealed secrets made up for the delay :) Thanks so much for reading![Chapter 19] Sorry for the wait, thank you for your patience! Onto the chapter! XVII. Elerie \"Elerie wait, please, let me explain - El-\" Jenny followed her friend and colleague as she stormed out of Jekyll's office. \"Yeah an explanation would be nice.\" She stopped so abruptly that Jenny almost crashed into her. They were cut off as two agents brought Nick through, who was wrapped up in a straitjacket. He and Elerie met eyes. \"Where are they taking him?\" she asked once the agents and Nick had disappeared. \"To see Henry. He'll be safe, I promise.\" Elerie only scoffed. \"Look, when Henry came to me I took the job because we had a common interest,\" Jenny tried to explain. \"So you're using each other.\" \"And now she's using him,\" Jenny mumbled. \"Oh don't look at me like that. What was I supposed to say? Would you have even believed me?\" \"Jenny, I've been searching for proof of this stuff my whole life, only to have everyone tell me I'm loony, including my husband, and now it's been going on right below my feet.\" A few minutes later, Nick emerged from the office, no longer in the straitjacket, followed closely by Jekyll and Malik. \"Ellie,\" he cried. \"Are you okay?\" She looked pretty shaken. \"Yeah, I-I'm alright,\" she said softly. \"You?\" \"Okay.\" Jekyll led them into a large labratory. At the centre was Ahmanet, chained up. \"My God,\" Elerie gasped. \"Forgive the state of things,\" Jekyll said. \"We had very little time to prepare for our guest.\" He gestured to Ahmanet. \"And only the information Jennifer provided to go on. It's not an exact science, this business.\" Nick looked around in utter confusion. \"A-and the business being?\" \"Yes, and a straight answer this time would be nice,\" added Elerie. \"Evil, Mr. Morton, Ms. Taylor. Recognize, contain, examine, destroy.\" He turned to look back at the mummy in awe. \"She is by far the most ancient we have ever encountered.\" The princess only stared back, shivering violently. \"What are you doing to her?\" \"Embalming her with mercury,\" Jekyll replied simply. \"At minus thirty-eight degrees the mercury in her veins will solidify and she should be safe for dissection then.\" At this, Jenny looked up. \"Dissection? You said that we'd study her.\" \"Yes, by dissection.\" \"But she's a living witness to a history that we barely know.\" \"Perhaps, but she's also a threat, Jennifer.\" \"Wait, wait, hold on, hold on. So where does that leave me?\" Nick asked. \"Cursed, Mr. Morton,\" Jekyll said, also lightly, as though it were the most common thing in the world. \"You have been selected as the vessel for the ultimate evil. And we are the only ones who can rectify that.\" Ahmanet began speaking then, in Ancient Egyptian. \" You cannot change your fate .\" Now all eyes were on her. \" The curse will never be broken .\" Now Nick, trance-like almost, slowly made his way towards her. \" My chosen was murdered. You will take his place.\" Nick shocked them all then by answering in the same language. \" But if you chose him, why were you going to kill him ?\" Elerie's eyebrows shot up into her hairline. She could speak some Ancient Egyptian, having studied it for a long time, and could understand the basis of their conversation. Now hearing Nick speak it with ease, she was impressed, even if it was just in his cursed state. She found it... Well, to be perfectly honest, sexy. Oh God. Must be this whole curse thing messing with her too. \" I was not going to kill him ,\" Ahmanet explained. \"I was going to give him eternal life. Make him a living god.\" Now she finished in English. Nick shook his head and now spoke in English too. \"You murdered your father.\" \"I loved my father, with all my heart. I only wanted his love in return.\" \"You killed his wife. Their child.\" Her jaw tightened. \"They were - different times.\" Her captivating voice filled the cold chamber. As she spoke, the world around them faded away to a desert scene. It were as though her voice was casting the vision. \"The Day of Awakening will soon be upon us... You will become Set... The world will fall to your desire... You will have power over life, over death... And you will have me... I will be your queen... Just give in...\" The scene now changed to Nick and Ahmanet in bed together, Elerie, Jenny, and Jekyll still standing off to the side. \"Nick,\" hissed Elerie. \"Nick, she's in your head again, she's using you - don't give in-\" He turned his head to look at her, but Ahmanet reached out and turned it back to look at her. \"They will kill you, just as they killed my chosen before you,\" she whispered. Elerie made to move forward, but was held back by Jekyll. Suddenly, Ahmanet let out an agonizing scream that shook the whole chamber. Everyone buckled over, hands pressed firmly over their ears to try and drown out the sound. \"Stop it! Stop it! Just stop!\" Nick yelled at the agents, seeing how they were harming her. She collapsed back in a crumpled ball on the cold iron floor. Even he seemed hurt by it, feeling her pain through their connection from the curse. Jekyll only stared. \"Fascinating,\" he breathed. \"What the hell - what kind of sick experiment are you running?\" cried Elerie. \"She's a human!\" \"But she is not, Ms. Taylor. Not anymore. She's a monster.\" Haha, it could be the curse Ellie, that or you're still in love with him ;) Sorry again for the late update - time has just been flying by and I didn't realize how long it had been since I last updated! Here you are - we're getting close to the chase scene in London, which is one of my favourite scenes in the movie! Thanks so much for reading, hope you enjoyed! :) ","Summary":" \"The past cannot remain buried forever...\" Somehow, it always finds a way of resurfacing... This "}]
